Vol. 167 
WASHINGTON, TUESDAY, AUGUST 24, 2021 
No. 150 
House of Representatives 
The House met at noon and was 
called to order by the Speaker pro tem-
pore (Ms. SEWELL).

DESIGNATION OF THE SPEAKER 
PRO TEMPORE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore laid be-
fore the House the following commu-
nication from the Speaker: 
WASHINGTON, DC, 
August 24, 2021. 
I hereby appoint the Honorable TERRI A. 
SEWELL to act as Speaker pro tempore on 
this day. 
NANCY PELOSI, 
Speaker of the House of Representatives. 
f 
PRAYER 
The Chaplain, the Reverend Margaret 
Grun Kibben, offered the following 
prayer: 
Holy God, we appeal to You this 
afternoon, that by Your blessing, this 
day would prove fruitful. 
Nothing this day is as we planned it. 
Not only have our schedules been up-
ended; but the world itself has turned 
upside down. We scramble to get things 
done and make things right, but with 
so much at stake, and the issues so 
complex, our efforts seem desperate 
and futile. 
We pray, therefore, that You who 
know our wanderings through this 
great wilderness would bless Your peo-
ple with Your guidance on this day. 
Provide rescue, shelter, and peace to 
those whose very lives are endangered 
by anarchy and violence. 
Provide wisdom, opportunity, and 
courage to those whose actions and de-
cisions have influence on the outcome 
of the chaos within our own country 
and the unrest across the globe. 
We pray Your benediction over our 
labor, equanimity in our thoughts, and 
purpose for our actions, that the extra 
measures we take, and the weighty de-
cisions we make today would not be in 
vain. 
We pray in the abiding love of Your 
holy name. 
Amen.

THE JOURNAL 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to section 11(a) of House Resolu-
tion 188, the Journal of the last day’s 
proceedings is approved. 
f 
PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Will the 
gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. GARCIA) 
come forward and lead the House in the 
Pledge of Allegiance. 
Ms. GARCIA of Texas led the Pledge 
of Allegiance as follows: 
I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the 
United States of America, and to the Repub-
lic for which it stands, one nation under God, 
indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. 
f 
ANNOUNCEMENT BY THE SPEAKER 
PRO TEMPORE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair will entertain up to five requests 
for 1-minute speeches on each side of 
the aisle. 
f 
REMEMBERING MIKE HONG 
(Mr. TAKANO asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. TAKANO. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to remember the life of a gen-
erous and fearless leader, Chairman 
Mike Hong. 
Chairman Hong was a beloved mem-
ber of the AAPI community, who had a 
sincere devotion to serving a variety of 
communities and causes. He mentored 
countless young people and believed in 
the importance of Asian Americans 
being politically engaged. 
He exemplified the immigrant who, 
by dint of talent, persistence, and 
faith, blazed a trail to success and then 
ensured many others would share in his 
blessings, and they did. 
I am especially proud that he helped 
finance a memorial of Dosan Ahn 
Chang Ho, a revered Korean independ-
ence freedom fighter, in the downtown 
mall of my hometown of Riverside, 
California. 
Chairman Hong dedicated his life to 
the service of others, and that will 
never be forgotten. To the Hong family 
and all those who knew, loved, and re-
spected him, I offer my deepest condo-
lences. 
f 
HONORING STEVE WALSH 
(Mrs. HARTZLER asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Mrs. HARTZLER. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to honor the memory of my 
dear friend and the longest serving 
member of my staff, Steve Walsh. 
Steve spent many years as a jour-
nalist covering politics in Washington, 
D.C. and Jefferson City, Missouri. He 
was one of my earliest supporters and 
spent the past decade serving the peo-
ple of Missouri’s Fourth Congressional 
District until his passing last week. 
Steve leaves behind his beloved wife, 
State Representative Sara Walsh, and 
numerous friends throughout Missouri 
and our Nation. 
He was always fun and full of sense of 
humor, love of major league baseball, 
the Beatles, and his faith. 
Steve not only loved history, he lived 
history. He once took a selfie in France 
with Speaker PELOSI on the 75th anni-
versary of D-day. In 1985, while dining 
in Midtown Manhattan, Steve was 
asked by his editor to cover the assas-
sination of Gambino crime boss Paul 
Castellano, where he incredibly en-
countered him deceased on the side-
walk. His life was truly filled with re-
markable experiences. 
Missouri has not only lost a true pub-
lic servant, but a wonderful friend to so

many. Today we mourn the passing of 
Steve Walsh, but we also rejoice that 
he resides with his Creator now. 
May his spirit live on throughout our 
work in Congress and in the hearts of 
all who were blessed to know him. 
f 
AMERICANS SHOULD HAVE EQUAL 
ACCESS TO THE BALLOT BOX 
(Ms. GARCIA of Texas asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
her remarks.) 
Ms. GARCIA of Texas. Madam Speak-
er, I rise to call attention to the impor-
tance of passing the John Lewis Voting 
Rights Advancement Act. 
Every American should have equal 
access to the ballot box. Our democ-
racy is stronger when everyone can 
participate. This should not be con-
troversial or politicized, it is about en-
suring a very basic right of every 
American. 
Sadly, in my home State of Texas, 
the GOP has been trying again and 
again and again to strip our right to 
vote. After three attempts to pass a 
dangerous anti-voting bill, the Texas 
GOP has made it absolutely clear that 
they do not really want communities 
of color, seniors, and Latinos to vote. 
The original Voting Rights Act was 
designed to stop this very kind of be-
havior. Voter suppression was wrong 
then and it is wrong now. 
Madam Speaker, I call upon my col-
leagues to vote for H.R. 4 so that we 
can strengthen our democracy and 
build on the Voting Rights Act. This 
bill will ensure that everyone has an 
equal right to vote. 
f 
RECOGNIZING MARTY REISER 
(Mr. SCALISE asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. 
SCALISE. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
today I rise to recognize Marty Reiser, 
a man of immense character and integ-
rity who selflessly served the American 
people for over 20 years. 
After graduating from the College of 
the Holy Cross, Marty started at the 
Department of Commerce as an ap-
pointee 
under 
President 
Ronald 
Reagan. 
In the 1990s, Marty came to the 
House of Representatives, where he 
worked for Congressman Dan Miller in 
a variety of roles, ultimately finishing 
up as his chief of staff. After leaving 
Capitol Hill, he went on to a think 
tank and taught high school before 
managing Xerox’s governmental affairs 
team. 
In 2011, Marty came back to the 
House, joining the Ways and Means 
Committee’s 
Health 
Subcommittee, 
where he was instrumental in crafting 
legislation that would provide quality 
healthcare for millions of Americans. 
On August 18, 2014, Marty joined my 
team and has been a vital part of it 
ever since. With a servant’s heart and 
attention to detail, Marty is an expert 
not only on House procedure, but on all 
issues passing through the whip’s of-
fice, and is relied upon in all other 
leadership offices as well. 
Thank you, Marty, for your faithful 
service to the House of Representa-
tives, and best of luck in your future. 
You will be missed. 
f 
PRESIDENT BIDEN’S BUILD BACK 
BETTER AGENDA 
(Ms. PLASKETT asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.) 
Ms. PLASKETT. Madam Speaker, I 
understand the importance of passing 
legislation that will make much-need-
ed investment in our Nation’s infra-
structure. And as the representative of 
the Virgin Islands, a place where mod-
ern infrastructure resilience to climate 
change is needed, I am committed to 
making that happen. 
President Biden’s Build Back Better 
agenda is not just about fixing our Na-
tion’s crumbling infrastructure, it is 
also about strengthening the economy, 
creating jobs, helping Americans afford 
the rising cost of living. These critical 
investments will not be possible with-
out passage of a budget resolution. 
Passage of a budget resolution gives 
House Democrats the opportunity to 
make sure we are not just investing in 
infrastructure, but also reducing car-
bon emission, restoring transit fund-
ing, reconnecting neighborhoods, and 
ensuring climate-resilient and afford-
able 
investment 
in 
our 
crumbling 
wastewater infrastructure, all of which 
are needed in my home. 
Ensuring a bicameral reconciliation 
process, with input from the people’s 
House prior to the passage of the bipar-
tisan infrastructure legislation, is es-
sential to advancing critical American 
priorities on infrastructure and so 
much more. That is why I know Demo-
crats will work together and take the 
first step to enact a budget resolution 
this week. 
f 
AFGHANISTAN DEBACLE 
(Mr. LAMALFA asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. LAMALFA. Madam Speaker, first 
of all, to all those who served in Af-
ghanistan, we thank you. God bless 
you. You did everything you were 
asked to do. You did your duty with 
honor. But like most Americans, I 
watched with disgust as the Taliban 
retook Kabul last Sunday. 
Any shame of that operation lies 
here in D.C. with the suits, not with 
the boots, who allowed this to happen. 
Yet, what are we hearing? Rhetoric. 
White House communications director 
Jen Psaki says: Now, it is irresponsible 
for those to be talking about Ameri-
cans that are stranded in Afghanistan. 
We see the word ‘‘stranded’’ on the 
front page of the newspaper. We see the 
word ‘‘hostage.’’ We see the words—all 
sorts of things—showing what a deba-
cle this has been, including ‘‘debacle’’ 
right on the front page. So what do we 
get from the White House? We are not 
getting transparency, as promised by 
the Biden administration, unless you 
want to define ‘‘transparency’’ as invis-
ible, which they have been. 
We have to do much better to get our 
people out of this country, and all that 
material that was left behind is now in 
the hands of our enemies. 
f 
BUILD BACK BETTER AGENDA 
(Mr. COHEN asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. COHEN. Madam Speaker, we 
were here until about 12:15 this morn-
ing trying to work out the votes for a 
rule to move America forward. I hope 
we have them. We will find out soon. 
We are trying to get the Build Back 
Better bill passed, the resolution to 
provide the opportunity for us to have 
that bill come forward, and the infra-
structure bill as well. They will provide 
for needed infrastructure for American 
companies, businesses, and families; 
child care tax credits to be made per-
manent; prescription drug costs to be 
reduced; water lines improved and cor-
rected; wastewater, which was so inad-
equate in Tennessee, where we had doz-
ens die from floods. 
Hopefully, we will get this passed, it 
is important business. I thank Speaker 
PELOSI and Leader HOYER for their long 
hours and their work in trying to build 
back America better. 
f 
AMERICANS STRANDED IN 
AFGHANISTAN 
(Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania asked 
and was given permission to address 
the House for 1 minute and to revise 
and extend his remarks.) 
Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania. Madam 
Speaker, President Biden’s failure to 
safely withdraw our troops from Af-
ghanistan has resulted in American ci-
vilians being attacked in broad day-
light on the streets of Kabul as they 
attempt to reach the airport. 
As I speak today, Americans are 
being stranded behind enemy lines. Our 
top priority must be to bring them 
home safely. Now is not the time for 
taking vacations or giving canned re-
marks from the west wing. 
Now is the time for American leader-
ship, and President Biden has failed us 
in this regard. The evidence is clear, 
the fall of Afghanistan is Joe Biden’s 
Saigon. 
Today, my prayers are with the mili-
tary that they have redeployed and are 
working to end this crisis. They are 
also with the American citizens who 
remain today stranded in Afghanistan.

PRESIDENT BIDEN IS DESTROYING 
THIS COUNTRY’S CREDIBILITY 
(Ms. FOXX asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.) 
Ms. FOXX. Madam Speaker, Presi-
dent Biden has barely been in office for 
8 months, and he has already done ir-
reparable damage to the United States’ 
standing within the international com-
munity, not to mention our national 
security. 
Rather than enacting a calculated 
and comprehensive plan to protect and 
evacuate 
the 
remaining 
Americans 
stuck in Afghanistan, he continues to 
point fingers and push falsehoods that 
have been refuted by his own adminis-
tration. 
President Biden is destroying this 
great 
country’s 
credibility 
on 
the 
world stage with this inept planning, 
failed executions, and inability to cali-
brate in this crisis. 
After listening to administration top 
officials, it is clear that there was 
never a plan to evacuate Americans 
safely from Afghanistan. Any expla-
nations of efforts that are underway 
are insufficient. 
The arbitrary deadline to leave by 
August 31 is ridiculous. The evacuation 
will be complete only when every 
American has exited Afghanistan. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Mem-
bers are reminded to refrain from en-
gaging in personalities toward the 
President.

Minnesota 
(Mrs.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4360 
August 24, 2021 
The rule also provides for consider-
ation of the Senate amendment to H.R. 
3684. The rule makes in order a motion 
offered by the chair of the Committee 
on Transportation and Infrastructure 
that the House concur in the Senate 
amendment to H.R. 3684. The rule pro-
vides for 1 hour of debate on the mo-
tion equally divided and controlled by 
the chair and the ranking minority 
member of the Committee on Trans-
portation and Infrastructure or their 
designees. 
Finally, the rule provides that S. 
Con. Res. 14 is adopted under adoption 
of the rule. 
Madam Speaker, today is an impor-
tant day. The underlying bills before us 
today are critical pieces of legislation 
to enact President Biden’s Build Back 
Better agenda. This plan will create 
good-paying jobs, put money in the 
pockets of American families, lower 
healthcare and childcare costs, and in-
vest in our Nation’s infrastructure paid 
for by ensuring that the wealthiest 
Americans are paying their fair share 
in taxes. We also take important crit-
ical steps today to secure the right to 
vote and safeguard our democracy. 
S. Con. Res. 14 begins the process to 
enact this important legislative agen-
da. In short, the resolution sets out 
President Biden’s Build Back Better 
plan, which includes critical invest-
ments that we can and must make now 
to provide a better future for our coun-
try. 
This is a plan to create jobs, to cut 
taxes, and to lower costs for working 
families. 
Our plan will make things affordable 
for the middle class and working fami-
lies and reduce healthcare costs. 
The Build Back Better plan will help 
prepare our Nation for the impacts of 
climate change: Through historic in-
vestments in a reimagined Climate 
Conservation Corps, investments that 
will put people to work to protect and 
conserve our public lands and open 
spaces, invest in the electrification of 
our infrastructure, and ensure that we 
can prepare for and mitigate the im-
pacts of climate change. 
We will provide for wildfire preven-
tion and mitigation, resources that are 
desperately needed, Madam Speaker, 
across the western United States as we 
continue 
to 
experience 
devastating 
wildfires year after year. My State of 
Colorado, along with many other west-
ern States, are in the midst of a ter-
rible drought which, combined with ex-
treme heat, is continuing to wreak 
havoc on our communities. 
As a father of a 3-year-old daughter 
who will be starting preschool just 
next week, we will invest in our chil-
dren through the Build Back Better 
plan by ensuring universal pre-K for 
every 3-year-old and 4-year-old in our 
country, provide tuition-free commu-
nity college, childcare for working 
families, upgrading school infrastruc-
ture, and strengthening our education 
workforce. 
We will fund investments in child nu-
trition programs, expand Medicare, 
Madam Speaker, for the first time in 
its 55-year history to include dental 
benefits, vision benefits, hearing cov-
erage, critical coverage that will help 
our seniors access the care that they 
need. 
The Build Back Better plan will be 
transformational for the American peo-
ple, reaching every aspect of their lives 
and making investments in resources 
that they can rely on. Madam Speaker, 
we will lower costs for the American 
people, we will cut taxes, and we will 
create jobs. This resolution is a first 
step toward making those critical in-
vestments a reality. 
I now turn to a bill that I know, 
Madam 
Speaker, 
you 
care 
deeply 
about, as you are the sponsor of the 
legislation, and that is the John R. 
Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act, 
H.R. 4. Voting is a sacred right 
foundational to our democracy and to 
our Republic. It is a right that many 
have fought and died to secure and that 
the late civil rights hero, our dear 
friend 
and 
colleague, 
John 
Lewis, 
fought to protect, despite being har-
assed, 
jailed, 
and 
beaten. 
Madam 
Speaker, as you know, Mr. Lewis often 
told us that the vote is the most pow-
erful nonviolent tool that we have. 
Unfortunately, it is a right that is 
once again under attack, and we see it, 
Madam Speaker, in the laws that are 
being passed in Georgia and in Florida 
and in Iowa. In State after State after 
State, and in the glaring absence of 
Federal standards and enforcement, 
partisan legislatures are making it 
harder for those who are legally eligi-
ble to vote to do so. 
We cannot stand by, Madam Speaker, 
as discriminatory measures run ramp-
ant, blocking Americans from partici-
pating in our democracy. 
Voting is a constitutional right. It is 
ingrained at the very core of who we 
are as Americans, Madam Speaker. As 
a Congress, protecting that right is 
foundational; it really is the heart of 
our duty. 
The vote can only truly represent the 
people’s voice if they have the ability 
to execute it freely and easily. That is 
why Congress needs to take clear, deci-
sive action today to protect voting 
rights by passing the John R. Lewis 
Voting Rights Advancement Act. This 
bill would strengthen the VRA and re-
spond to recent Supreme Court cases 
striking critical provisions of the bill, 
while making clear that Congress has 
the power to create a new formula. 
The VRA has been reauthorized, 
Madam Speaker, as you know, on a bi-
partisan basis for decades, most re-
cently in 2006 when the reauthorization 
on the VRA passed this Chamber 390–33, 
and in the Senate 98 votes for it, zero 
votes against it. This should not be a 
partisan issue. 
Our democracy is safeguarded only 
when every eligible voter has the op-
portunity to participate, and that is 
what we will ensure today by passing 
this bill out of the House. 
Finally, Madam Speaker, as you 
know, the rule provides for consider-
ation of the Infrastructure Investment 
and Jobs Act. This bipartisan bill is an 
important down payment toward meet-
ing the critical infrastructure needs of 
our communities. We all know that our 
Nation’s infrastructure is in desperate 
need of repair, and this bipartisan bill 
seeks to make those much-needed in-
vestments. 
The bill invests in our roads, our 
highways, our bridges, focusing on 
making infrastructure resilient to the 
impacts of climate change and natural 
disasters. 
It has become particularly clear over 
the course of this last year that access 
to affordable, reliable broadband is ab-
solutely critical for Americans to be 
able to do their jobs and to participate 
equally in remote learning, to access 
healthcare, to stay connected. This In-
frastructure Investment and Jobs Act 
provides 
$65 
billion 
to 
expand 
broadband coverage to areas most in 
need across the United States, and it 
also takes steps to make sure that that 
coverage is more affordable for individ-
uals for whom those costs might be 
prohibitive. 
The bill makes critical investments 
in our drinking water infrastructure, 
ensuring that clean, safe drinking 
water is a right in all communities. 
Lastly, I would be remiss, Madam 
Speaker, if I didn’t mention that there 
are several priorities that I have been 
working on with many of my col-
leagues from the western United States 
that are part of this bill, the Joint 
Chiefs Landscape Restoration Partner-
ship Program, my bill to help restore 
our forests and respond to wildfire 
risks; the reauthorization of the Secure 
Rural Schools Program; and, of course, 
the Disaster Safe Power Grid Act, 
which ensures a safer and more resil-
ient power grid in the face of emer-
gencies. 
b 1330 
The Senate has already passed this 
bill and shown the desire to invest in 
our infrastructure, and the House must 
now do the same. 
Madam Speaker, these three under-
lying bills that we are considering 
today make essential investments in 
American families and communities, 
and we have to meet this moment for 
the American people. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mrs. FISCHBACH. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman from Colorado for 
yielding me the customary 30 minutes. 
I will just say, it has been a long and 
bumpy road to get here so I am happy 
to finally be here on the floor with the 
rule. 
Madam Speaker, I yield myself such 
time as I may consume. 
Madam Speaker, House Resolution 
601 provides for the consideration of 
two controversial partisan bills and 
deems the $3.5 trillion reconciliation 
resolution adopted that strips away 
local control and adds trillions to the 
national debt.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4361 
August 24, 2021 
The bill deemed adopted under this 
rule is S. Con. Res. 14, the $3.5 trillion 
tax-and-spending binge that passed the 
Senate earlier this month. 
Madam Speaker, prices are at a 13- 
year high, and inflation is rising. Presi-
dent Biden has already spent $1.9 tril-
lion and is now looking to spend an ad-
ditional $3.5 trillion, all while his ad-
ministration pays Americans not to 
work and stifles our robust economy. 
Not only does this budget call for the 
highest 
sustained Federal spending 
level in American history, but it also 
amounts to a whopping $68 trillion over 
the next decade. It raises taxes on the 
American people, shifts jobs overseas, 
and taxes American employers at one 
of the highest rates in the world. It 
eliminates ‘‘right to work’’ protection 
and does nothing to address the his-
toric flow of illegal immigration at the 
southern border. 
Democrats know their proposals are 
unpopular. They can’t even get their 
own conference to agree. Instead, they 
are resorting to smoke and mirrors to 
push it through and hoping the Amer-
ican people aren’t paying attention. 
Where is the transparency? 
If Democrats truly want to serve and 
help the American people, they need 
far more transparency and input from 
everyone, not just a few. This is no way 
to build a budget. 
Madam Speaker, then there is H.R. 4, 
which would make changes to the Vot-
ing Rights Act and strips State and 
local governments of their ability to 
manage their own elections. The Con-
stitution places the responsibility for 
elections at the State level, and we 
have a long history of letting each 
State run their own elections. But H.R. 
4 grants the Federal Government un-
precedented control over State and 
local elections. It empowers the Attor-
ney General to bully States and forces 
those States to seek Federal approval 
before making changes to their own 
voting laws. 
H.R. 4 also provides incentives for ad-
vocacy groups to file as many objec-
tions as possible to manufacture litiga-
tion in the hope of triggering coverage 
under the Voting Rights Act. We need 
safeguards that make it easy to vote 
and hard to cheat. H.R. 4 is not the so-
lution. 
Madam Speaker, finally, the final 
bill in this resolution is the Senate 
amendment to H.R. 3684, which pro-
vides for $1.2 trillion in new infrastruc-
ture spending. 
Madam Speaker, I hate to say it, but 
my Democrat colleagues are using the 
bipartisan infrastructure framework to 
force their Members to also push 
through trillions more in their out-
landish spending resolution. Our con-
stituents are tired of Washington play-
ing games with their livelihoods. 
To be sure, investing in our Nation’s 
infrastructure 
is 
critical. 
However, 
only a fraction of this $1 trillion-plus 
bill is for roads, bridges, and other 
projects the American people would 
consider 
traditional 
infrastructure. 
With tens of billions for electric vehi-
cle plug-ins, Amtrak, and light rail, if 
you live in a deep blue city, this bill is 
for you. But if you are one of the mil-
lions of Americans in a more rural 
area, this bill leaves you behind. 
Madam Speaker, our country’s infra-
structure should not be tied to the 
Democrats’ partisan spending spree, es-
pecially during a pandemic. But here 
we are. Until Democrats stop playing 
games and work with their colleagues 
on a truly bipartisan compromise, I 
urge my colleagues to oppose this rule 
and the underlying bills. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. NEGUSE. Madam Speaker, I 
must say with great respect for my col-
league from Minnesota, I think the Re-
publican minority leader of the United 
States 
Senate, 
MITCH
MCCONNELL, 
would disagree with the gentlewoman’s 
characterization of the bipartisan in-
frastructure bill being for—I think she 
said—urban cities or blue cities. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
19 
Republicans 
voted for that bill in the United States 
Senate, including the Senate minority 
leader. So I think that it is important 
for us to recognize that the invest-
ments made in that bill, as well as the 
investments made in the resolution, 
the Build Back Better plan that we are 
also considering over the coming weeks 
are incredibly important for the future 
of our country. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to 
the gentlewoman from North Carolina 
(Ms. ROSS), a distinguished member of 
both the Committee on Rules and the 
Committee on the Judiciary. 
Ms. ROSS. Madam Speaker, the rule 
before us provides for consideration of 
three landmark pieces of legislation. 
First and foremost, we are here to as-
sume our duty to protect our American 
democracy. Just this year alone, 18 
States have enacted 30 voter suppres-
sion laws. In response, the John R. 
Lewis Voting Rights Act would rein-
vigorate section 2 of the Voting Rights 
Act, restore geographic preclearance 
requirements eliminated in the Shelby 
decision, and take other steps to block 
discriminatory voting measures before 
they are implemented. 
The history of the fight for voting 
rights in America is long and painful. 
But at crucial forks on that difficult 
path, Members of this body from both 
parties have set politics aside and done 
the right thing. 
We are meeting here today at an-
other pivotal juncture in the struggle 
for voting rights, and it is up to us to 
meet the urgency of the moment, live 
up to our constitutional responsibil-
ities, and pass this critical legislation. 
Madam Speaker, I also rise in sup-
port of our $3.5 trillion Build Back Bet-
ter budget resolution. By taking real 
action on climate change, expanding 
the child tax credit, and supporting 
universal pre-K and free community 
college, this budget represents an in-
vestment in all of our people, espe-
cially our children and grandchildren. 
For the sake of our constituents and 
our country, let’s approve this vital 
funding. 
Madam Speaker, lastly, the rule be-
fore us provides for future consider-
ation of the Senate’s bipartisan infra-
structure package. From expanding 
broadband to rebuilding roads, bridges, 
airports, rail, and water systems, this 
historic bill will help bring America’s 
aging infrastructure into the 21st cen-
tury and create jobs. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to support the rule and this 
legislation. 
Mrs. FISCHBACH. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from 
Missouri (Mr. SMITH), ranking member 
of the Budget Committee. 
Mr. 
SMITH 
of 
Missouri. 
Madam 
Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman 
from Minnesota for yielding. 
The last 24 hours, we need to just 
step back and look at it. And I need to 
remind my colleagues and remind the 
folks across the aisle that what we just 
witnessed is a circus; and also remind 
them that this is the people’s House. 
This is not PELOSI’s palace, this is the 
people’s House. 
Madam Speaker, the middle of July, 
we were supposed to mark up a budget 
in the House Budget Committee, but 
the Democrats did not have the votes. 
Madam Speaker, before the August 
recess, we were suppose to pass the 
House budget. The Democrats did not 
have the votes. Yesterday—up until 
about 1 a.m. this morning, in fact—we 
were going to pass the House budget, 
but the Democrats did not have the 
votes. So now they have a scheme be-
fore us, a scheme that they are putting 
BERNIE’S
budget with the transpor-
tation bill, which is not even going to 
be voted on today, not even going to be 
voted on this week, not even going to 
be voted on this month, along with a 
voting rights bill, because they can’t 
pass BERNIE’S budget. You know why 
they can’t pass BERNIE’S budget? Be-
cause the American people are fed up 
with the Democrats’ reckless spending. 
Right now, we are facing the Biden 
inflation crisis. We are facing the 
Biden border crisis. We are facing the 
Biden energy crisis. And we are facing 
the Biden Afghanistan crisis. Yet, they 
bring forth a budget resolution that 
only makes those crises worse, $68 tril-
lion in new spending, the most spend-
ing in the history of this country; $17 
trillion of debt, the largest increase of 
debt, in fact, more debt than the entire 
economies of every country in the 
world, except for the United States. 
BERNIE SANDERS may have lost the 
Presidential primary, but his policies 
have won. BERNIE
SANDERS
controls 
this Chamber, along with the liberal 
squad. But the American people are 
watching, and they are fed up. And 
they are letting the American people 
know whenever this Chamber changes 
and we actually bring order back to the 
House of Representatives.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4362 
August 24, 2021 
Mr. NEGUSE. Madam Speaker, you 
know what is interesting? I don’t re-
member the ranking member com-
plaining about the deficit 3 years ago 
when they passed tax cuts for billion-
aires across our country to the tune of 
$2 trillion in terms of adding it to the 
deficit. I don’t remember them com-
plaining about process when they had 
to do three rules within a time period 
of 6 weeks to try to repeal the Afford-
able Care Act back in 2017. 
I heard much today by way of proc-
ess, but very little in terms of sub-
stance. Why? Because they know that 
the plan we have put forward today 
will lower costs, will cut taxes, and 
will create jobs. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to 
the gentlewoman from California (Ms. 
PELOSI), the distinguished Speaker of 
this House. 
Ms. 
PELOSI. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
I 
thank the gentleman for yielding and 
for his distinguished role on the Com-
mittee on Rules. 
Now, let us praise the Committee on 
Rules for the important work that they 
do making sure that legislation comes 
to the floor in a way that is consistent 
with the rules of the House, and in this 
case, a budget that is consistent with 
the values of our country. 
I thank the gentleman from Colorado 
and the chairman, JIM MCGOVERN, for 
his leadership as well. And to each and 
every member of the Committee on 
Rules, we have to salute them, on both 
sides of the aisle, for the time they put 
in and how they facilitate the work of 
the House. 
Madam Speaker, today is a great day 
of pride for our country and for Demo-
crats. We have a President with a big, 
bold vision for our country and unprec-
edented opportunity to keep our prom-
ises for the people. We promised ‘‘for 
the people’’ that we would lower 
healthcare costs by lowering the cost 
of prescription drugs; we would in-
crease paychecks by building the infra-
structure of America; and we would 
have cleaner government by passing 
legislation. 
This rule does all three of those 
things and much more, enabling the 
Congress to vote on some of that legis-
lation today; some of it in the bill, and 
some of it for later. 
When the President spoke about the 
infrastructure bill which is provided 
for in this rule, he said to our Repub-
lican friends, I want to find our com-
mon ground on infrastructure, but I 
will not confine my vision to what is in 
the bill that we can do in a bipartisan 
way unless you want to help us build 
back better. I like to say build back 
better for women, because that is what 
this budget will do; that is in this rule. 
So I salute the President, not only 
for his vision and his determination to 
get the job done, but for the priorities 
that will be contained here in this 
budget as we go forward. 
The Build Back Better budget agenda 
is one that is liberating for families, 
not just women, moms and dads, with 
childcare, with a child tax credit, with 
universal pre-K, with home healthcare, 
with workforce development. So that 
not only are we building the physical 
infrastructure 
of 
America, 
we 
are 
building the human infrastructure of 
America to enable many more people 
to participate in the success of our 
economy and the growth of our society. 
It does so with equity, a 40 percent jus-
tice provision that will be in there. 
b 1345 
Now, it remains for us to work to-
gether, work with the Senate, to write 
a bill that preserves the privilege of 51 
votes in the Senate. So we must work 
together to do that in a way that 
passes the House and passes the Sen-
ate, and we must do so expeditiously. 
Expeditiously. 
The authorizations for highway, et 
cetera, will expire September 30. By 
October 1, we hope to have in place, 
that is the plan, to have in place the 
legislation for infrastructure. That is 
bipartisan, and I salute that, but it is 
not inclusive of all of the values we 
need to build back at a time when we 
have a climate crisis. 
So I salute our distinguished chair of 
the Committee on Transportation and 
Infrastructure, Mr. DEFAZIO, for the 
knowledge that he brings, the value 
system and the knowledge that he 
brings to looking at how we do a rec-
onciliation bill, a build back better bill 
in a way that is preserving of our plan-
et for the children. For the children. 
Exciting in all of this is the fact that 
we will have the John R. Lewis Voting 
Rights Advancement Act. This is pret-
ty exciting. And I commend you, 
Madam Speaker, for your leadership in 
making this possible; for you to be the 
author of it. But when you are the au-
thor, though, you will no longer be able 
to preside, you have to come down and 
manage us on the floor. So it is appro-
priate that during the rule that will 
enable this to come to the floor, you 
are presiding, so we can all congratu-
late you in a highly visible way. 
This legislation is so important. I 
was very much a part of passing the 
previous bill, that was in 2007, we wrote 
it in 2006, it became effective in 2007 
when President Bush was President. 
We had Republican majorities in the 
House and Senate, and we passed the 
legislation overwhelmingly. Over near-
ly 400 votes in the House, unanimous in 
the Senate; signed by President Bush, 
as bipartisan as anything that has 
come to the floor. 
We walked down the steps of the Cap-
itol in a bipartisan way, saluting the 
fact that we had extended the Voting 
Rights Act and President Bush signed 
it. And with great pride, he came to 
your neck of the woods, to Selma, on 
the 50th anniversary of the Selma 
march. But he came as the person who 
had signed the Voting Rights Act. And 
even more important than that, Laura 
Bush came, too, so their hearts are in 
this legislation. 
I would hope that there would be 
some level of bipartisanship on that as 
well. We will talk more about that as 
we go into the debate on that bill in a 
little while. 
But I do, again, want to thank Con-
gresswoman DELAURO for her relent-
less, persistent, dissatisfied until now, 
I hope satisfied to a certain extent, 
more to come, of the child tax credit. 
For 10 Congresses she has introduced 
that bill, and now it is being advanced. 
And Mr. YARMUTH, the chair of the 
Budget Committee, will lead us now as 
we prepare in our individual commit-
tees, our work for the Budget Com-
mittee to put together a package. 
Madam Speaker, as you know, a na-
tional budget should be a statement of 
our national values. What is important 
to us as a Nation should be reflected in 
our budget. And this will be the case. 
And under the leadership of Mr. YAR-
MUTH, who is not only values-based, but 
eloquent in conveying that message, 
we are very excited about how we go 
forward. 
Again, I mentioned PETER DEFAZIO. 
In terms of the Voting Rights Act, the 
very distinguished chair of the Judici-
ary Committee, Mr. NADLER; and ZOE 
LOFGREN for her work as chair on the 
Committee on House Administration; 
Mr. BUTTERFIELD, and so many people; 
and our distinguished whip, Mr. CLY-
BURN, who has made this his life work. 
Passing this rule paves the way for 
the Build Back Better plan, which will 
forge legislative progress unseen in 50 
years that will stand for generations 
alongside the New Deal and the Great 
Society. This legislation will be the 
biggest and perhaps most consequen-
tial initiatives that any of us have ever 
undertaken in our official lives. 
Everything we do is about the chil-
dren. As you have heard me say when 
people ask me, what are the three most 
important issues facing the Congress? I 
always say the same thing: Our chil-
dren, our children, our children; their 
health, their education, and the eco-
nomic security of their families, a safe 
environment in which they can thrive, 
and a world at peace in which they can 
reach their fulfillment. 
When children come here to the Cap-
itol, it is such an invigoration for us 
and an inspiration to us to see them 
because we are here for them. And as I 
say to them, as you see the statues and 
the monuments to those who went be-
fore, it is appropriate that we honor 
them, but they want us to honor you, 
the future of our country, to make it 
better for the children. 
Again, any delay in passing the rule 
threatens the Build Back Better plan, 
as well as voting rights reform, as well 
as the bipartisan infrastructure bill. 
We cannot surrender our leverage for 
the children. For the first time, I don’t 
remember a time as historic as this, for 
the children. 
President Biden has given children 
leverage in his visionary proposal. The 
children have the leverage, not those 
at the high end who benefitted from 
the Republican tax bill, and I wouldn’t 
even have brought it up except you are

acting as if you don’t even know, when 
you added $2 trillion, or more, to the 
budget to give 83 percent of the bene-
fits to the wealthiest people in our 
country. 
Leverage for the rich, no. We don’t 
begrudge them their success, but this 
is about leverage for the children, for 
them, for their families for the future. 
And guess what? It would be our at-
tempt to pay for this bill so it is not a 
burden to those children as we go for-
ward. And that means that some of the 
people that benefitted from that tax 
bill, that tax scam in 2017, are now 
going to have to pay their fair share, 
fair share, pay their fair share, and 
that we may have to address other 
ways to pay for the legislation by put-
ting the responsibility on the high end, 
both whether it is corporate or indi-
vidual, so that we can again make 
progress for the children without bur-
dening them with the debt, some of 
which they got in 2017. 
So it is a pretty exciting day. I con-
gratulate all on the Rules Committee 
for going in time and again as we 
sought clarification on how we go for-
ward. I thank Mr. MCGOVERN, Mr. 
NEGUSE, and so many other members of 
that committee. 
I thank all of our colleagues for their 
involvement in all of this. And I would 
hope that as we proceed, we could do so 
in the most transparent, bipartisan, 
and fair way for the children. 
Mrs. FISCHBACH. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, if we defeat the pre-
vious question, I will offer an amend-
ment to the rule to provide for addi-
tional consideration of H.R. 5071, au-
thored by Representative GALLAGHER. 
Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous 
consent to insert the text of my 
amendment into the RECORD, along 
with extraneous material, immediately 
prior to the vote on the previous ques-
tion. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from Minnesota? 
There was no objection. 
Mrs. FISCHBACH. Madam Speaker, 
President Biden’s failure to lead has re-
sulted in a national security and hu-
manitarian crisis in Afghanistan that 
we cannot ignore. 
Now the Taliban is back and the 
United States is less safe. The Presi-
dent has offered no specific plan for 
getting those Americans out of Afghan-
istan safely. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to 
the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. 
GALLAGHER), from Wisconsin’s Eighth 
Congressional District. 
Mr. GALLAGHER. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to urge defeat of the pre-
vious question so that we can consider 
my bill, H.R. 5071, to ensure no Ameri-
cans are left behind in Afghanistan. 
Over the past week, we have all seen 
the horrifying images coming out of 
Kabul: babies being passed over barbed 
wire, 2-year-olds trampled to death, 
bodies falling from C–17s. These pic-
tures are now forever painted onto 
American history. They don’t depict 
the orderly withdrawal that the Presi-
dent promised. These are, instead, por-
traits of chaos, tragedy, and dishonor. 
And, yet, the administration assures 
us a plan for every contingency. Was 
the plan for America to give billions of 
dollars worth of U.S. military equip-
ment to the Taliban? Was the plan to 
put terrorists, effectively, in charge of 
security around the Kabul airport? Was 
the plan to leave over 10,000 American 
citizens stranded behind enemy lines? 
Madam Speaker, if this was the plan, 
a plan to surrender so incompetently 
and on such ignominious terms, then 
our country can’t withstand any more 
of this administration’s plans. It is 
time for this body, this Congress, to 
act, to hold the administration ac-
countable and save lives. This bill 
would do that by requiring daily re-
porting to Congress on the number of 
Americans left in the country and the 
number of Afghan allies that are seek-
ing refuge. 
The bill also critically prohibits the 
President from withdrawing our forces 
until all Americans, who want out, are 
safely out of the country. Right now, it 
seems, the President is doubling down 
on this August 31 withdraw date, de-
spite strong bipartisan opposition and 
push back. 
Make no mistake, if we get out on 
August 31, we are going to condemn 
thousands to death. I don’t care what 
secret side deal was struck with the 
Taliban, this is America, we don’t 
leave anybody behind. A great country, 
such as ours, takes care of our citizens 
and our allies. 
Our enemies are mocking our sur-
render right now. We have all seen the 
images. The Taliban, for example, just 
mocked the iconic image of Marines 
raising the flag over Iwo Jima. It may 
be too late to save face because of this 
debacle, but it is not too late to save 
lives. This isn’t a news cycle that will 
blow over. This isn’t a narrative that 
you can spin. We are talking about 
American lives, and we are talking 
about America’s honor. 
Madam Speaker, let’s act now, before 
this crisis, and with it, America’s 
standing in the world deteriorates even 
further. 
Mr. NEGUSE. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, I certainly under-
stand where my colleague is coming 
from and have great reverence and re-
spect for him and his service to our 
country, and I certainly look forward 
to continuing to work with him on the 
important issues that he described. 
But defeating the previous question 
would hand over the floor to the Re-
publican 
Conference. 
And, 
as 
you 
know, Madam Speaker, we have incred-
ibly important pieces of legislation 
that we are considering, specifically, 
the John Lewis Voting Rights Act, and 
the bipartisan infrastructure budget, 
and the President’s Build Back Better 
plan today. 
Madam Speaker, I look forward to 
voting for the rule, and would encour-
age all Members in the House to vote 
for the rule, to vote for the previous 
question so that we can proceed with 
the business of the House. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to 
the gentlewoman from Pennsylvania 
(Ms. SCANLON), a distinguished member 
of the Rules Committee. 
Ms. SCANLON. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today in enthusiastic support of 
this rule and the underlying legisla-
tion. 
H.R. 4, the John R. Lewis Voting 
Rights Advancement Act, is essential 
to ensuring that every American voter 
has equal access to the ballot box, and 
the freedom to make his or her voice 
heard. 
Ever since the Supreme Court’s deci-
sion in Shelby v. Holder opened the 
door, we have seen State legislatures 
pass hundreds of laws to restrict voter 
access while claiming, falsely, to pro-
tect our elections from voter fraud 
that doesn’t even exist. 
Now, the unjustified attacks on the 
2020 election results by the former 
President and his supporters have pro-
duced a wave of anti-democratic bills. 
But it doesn’t have to be this way. In 
Shelby, the Supreme Court invited 
Congress to amend the Voting Rights 
Act to address its concerns. 
For 8 years, our Republican col-
leagues refused the Court’s invitation 
to reinvigorate the Voting Rights Act, 
while 
extremist 
politicians 
worked 
overtime to close polling locations, 
limit voting hours, purge voter rolls, 
and erect barriers to the ballot box. 
b 1400 
We can’t continue down this path if 
we want America to remain a func-
tional democracy. Congress needs to do 
its job. I urge all of my colleagues and 
all Americans to support this bill. 
I would also like to speak briefly 
about the bipartisan infrastructure bill 
and the Build Back Better Act, which 
today’s vote will move forward. To-
gether, they are the key to helping 
Americans and American businesses 
succeed in the 21st century. 
Our country is facing multiple, inter-
connected crises: the COVID pandemic, 
a deeply unequal economy, long-ne-
glected infrastructure needs, under-
funded public services that often fail to 
serve those most in need, and climate 
disasters that are impacting our com-
munities more often. 
The Build Back Better agenda is sim-
ple: make major investments in phys-
ical infrastructure and working fami-
lies to create a fairer, more productive, 
and sustainable economy. 
We need the bipartisan infrastructure 
deal to enable America to compete in 
the 21st century, but we also need the 
Build Back Better Act to create jobs 
and lower costs and taxes for working 
families. These bills have the power to 
improve the lives of millions of Ameri-
cans.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4364 
August 24, 2021 
Madam Speaker, I urge all of my col-
leagues to support the rule. 
Mrs. FISCHBACH. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from 
Florida (Mr. MAST). 
Mr. MAST. Madam Speaker, let’s be 
bipartisanly honest here for a moment. 
We just walked out of probably the 
most bipartisan moment in the last 
couple of years, a classified briefing 
with the Joint Chiefs, the Secretary, 
the Secretary of State, and others. 
There are things that, real-world, 
need to be done where Americans are 
at risk. They are cut off, and they are 
stranded. They are now in the situa-
tion where they are the hostages of Af-
ghanistan because of everything that 
has been allowed to transpire under 
President Biden. And in this body, we 
are going to walk out of that classified 
briefing concerned behind closed doors 
but do nothing—do absolutely noth-
ing—on the floor of the House. 
I am going to say the same thing I 
just said a few minutes ago: What the 
hell are we doing? 
Let’s say that again: There are 
Americans cut off who need our help, 
and there are Special Immigrant Visa 
applicants cut off who need our help 
right now who will be killed. We heard 
the descriptions of the dangers in the 
briefing we just got out of. 
Defeat the previous question and 
bring up the only thing that this body 
will do in this entire week that has 
anything to do with what is going on in 
Afghanistan. This is the only oppor-
tunity, the only thing that is going on 
related to Afghanistan in this body. 
That is unconscionable. How in the 
world is that the case? 
Every time somebody tries to do 
something different in here, like take 
the ability of States to determine their 
own voting rights or other things, ev-
erybody needs to say: Stop. What the 
hell are you doing? Get focused back on 
Afghanistan and saving Americans. 
Mr. NEGUSE. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from 
New Jersey (Mr. PALLONE), who is the 
distinguished chairman of the Com-
mittee on Energy and Commerce. 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, this 
budget resolution allows us to imple-
ment President Biden’s Build Back 
Better agenda to revitalize our econ-
omy by creating millions of good-pay-
ing jobs, and it allows us to aggres-
sively combat the climate crisis. The 
goal of the Energy and Commerce Com-
mittee with this budget resolution is to 
make healthcare more affordable and 
accessible for all Americans. We can 
help accomplish that by closing the 
Medicaid coverage gap to provide qual-
ity comprehensive coverage to an esti-
mated 4 million Americans who qualify 
for Medicaid but who have been denied 
access to care in their State. 
It will also continue subsidies under 
the Affordable Care Act to reduce 
health insurance costs. The Energy and 
Commerce Committee plans to lower 
the price of out-of-control and sky-
rocketing prescription drug prices by 
giving the Federal Government the 
ability to negotiate lower prices and 
will use the savings to expand Medicare 
benefits. Our plan is to provide invest-
ments in our public health infrastruc-
ture to help us respond to the ongoing 
COVID–19 pandemic and better respond 
to future public health emergencies. 
The Build Back Better agenda will 
allow us to create millions of new, 
homegrown jobs and combat the cli-
mate crisis by aggressively investing in 
clean energy and clean technology. The 
moment is here to invest in a more ad-
vanced and resilient economy and to-
ward a 100 percent clean economy. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to support this budget resolu-
tion that allows us to carry out Presi-
dent Biden’s bold vision and deliver on 
the Build Back Better agenda for the 
people. 
Mrs. FISCHBACH. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentleman from 
California (Mr. MCCARTHY). 
Mr. MCCARTHY. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentlewoman for yielding 
time. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in opposition 
to today’s rule. 
Madam Speaker, before I came here, 
I was listening to the debate. I listened 
to Congressman GALLAGHER, a veteran, 
come to the floor and talk about an 
idea that he has, an idea that here we 
are, Afghanistan is collapsing, and 
thousands of Americans in Afghanistan 
are trying to get out. 
Here we are, called back for a special 
session. 
All 
his 
previous 
question 
would say is that we would have to 
have a report every day on those Amer-
icans, that we wouldn’t pick a timeline 
until the mission is finished, and that 
people would be able to be brought 
back. 
As I listened to his impassioned 
speech, I waited for the response. I lis-
tened to my friend on the other side. 
He respects Mr. GALLAGHER, but he 
could not turn the floor over because if 
the floor were turned over to Repub-
licans, instead of changing the election 
law and spending $5 trillion, they 
would put the American public first. 
God forbid we would do that. 
Madam Speaker, I heard the Demo-
crat on the other side say we could not 
turn the floor over to the Republicans 
to let the American public know how 
many Americans were there. It would 
be devastating—devastating—to allow 
that to happen. 
This week, the House is in session for 
the first time since Kabul fell to the 
Taliban. What is happening in Afghani-
stan is a disaster for America’s secu-
rity and credibility, not for just today 
and not for next week, but for decades 
to come. Other countries are ques-
tioning whether we have the resolve to 
honor our word because of the bungled 
withdrawal. 
President Biden magnified this dam-
age over the past week by hiding at 
Camp 
David, 
delivering 
incoherent 
speeches, and is reported as failing to 
contact a single foreign leader for 36 
hours. Today, he signaled an uncondi-
tional surrender to the Taliban, prom-
ising to leave in just 7 days. 
We just had a classified briefing for 
all the Members. I don’t believe any 
Member walking out of there believes 
that in 7 days we could get the thou-
sands of Americans out. That is why we 
can’t relinquish the floor to the Repub-
licans to actually get a report on it. 
Madam Speaker, the President’s ac-
tions gave the impression of incom-
petency and a declining power. This 
week, we learned that the Taliban 
seized millions in U.S. weapons, mak-
ing them stronger than they were 20 
years ago. 
Madam Speaker, it is reported the 
Taliban now has more Black Hawk hel-
icopters than Australia. Military mis-
sions should be dictated by our Na-
tion’s interests, not by our enemies or 
by arbitrary timelines. 
Right now, there is no greater na-
tional priority than getting our people 
home. But I just heard from the Demo-
crat on the other side that we could 
not relinquish the floor to allow Mr. 
GALLAGHER’s, 
a 
veteran’s, 
previous 
question to come up because that 
would be dealing with the Nation’s in-
terests right now. No. We need to deal 
with the Democrats’ priorities right 
now. 
As I look around, I see our allies re-
sponding to this crisis with the serious-
ness it deserves. Madam Speaker, the 
Speaker called us back here. We are 
not the only body of power that has 
been called back. 
In Britain, Parliament returned from 
its summer recess. Do you know what 
they are doing, though, Madam Speak-
er? They are working in an emergency 
session on this current situation to get 
their citizens home. 
In France, President Macron is try-
ing to rally the U.N. Security Council. 
This House should be correcting this 
disastrous record left by this Com-
mander in Chief and proving that 
America never abandons her people or 
shrinks from defending our interests. 
Madam Speaker, that is not what I 
heard on this floor. I heard a direction, 
Madam Speaker, by the Democrat lead-
ing and in charge of this right now that 
we could not relinquish the floor sim-
ply to Mr. GALLAGHER’s request of let-
ting America know how many Ameri-
cans are there and to not put a 
timeline until every American comes 
home. 
We should be doing nothing else on 
the floor until every single American is 
home. Democrats called us back for an 
emergency session, the first session 
since Kabul fell to the Taliban. But 
faced with a national security and 
credibility crisis in Afghanistan, they 
have done nothing to plan to address 
it. 
We were allotted 90 minutes, and, oh 
my God, we went over 15 minutes. But 
we made sure that then the Democrats 
had to shut that meeting down, that 
Members of Congress could ask no 
more longer questions because we need-
ed to get back to the floor right now.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4365 
August 24, 2021 
When history writes about this day, 
they will talk about the entire week. 
They will talk about last night, how 
Congress worked late into the night, 
actually ordered food to come in, was 
in the Speaker’s Office for late hours, 
spent their day calling other Members 
and twisting votes. We had reports that 
the 
President 
called 
people, 
that 
former Presidents called people, and 
that people were threatened and that 
their spouses were threatened about 
jobs. We heard that they were threat-
ened even in their own campaign. 
But 
what 
were 
they 
threatened 
about? Was it anything to deal with 
Americans coming home? No. It was 
about this rule. It was about what we 
are bringing up right now. The reason 
we had to stop our briefing was because 
we had to come to the floor to deal 
with this. 
So, what are we talking about? $5 
trillion of hard-earned taxpayer money 
being spent on more Big Government, 
changing election law to benefit one 
party over another, outlawing IDs even 
though the majority of America wants 
it, and nothing about how that $5 tril-
lion will spend $1 bringing Americans 
home or making us safer. 
What is the definition of a public 
servant? I would say doing something 
for the good of the others. 
Madam Speaker, the party today of 
the majority, the Democrats here, 
their interest is themselves, to stay up 
late into the night while other nations 
are working to bring their citizens 
home. 
Madam Speaker, as people walk onto 
this floor and vote on this bill that 
they worked late into the night on, I 
want them to think about one thing. I 
want them to think about those Amer-
ican families in Afghanistan who late 
into the night were not knowing if 
they could even make it to the airport, 
not knowing if they will even get out, 
and wondering if the public servants 
were thinking of them. The sad answer 
is the majority was not. They were 
thinking of themselves, that it is too 
important to deal with anything else. 
Madam Speaker, there are allies who 
are sitting in Afghanistan. Why did 
they go? They went to defend America 
because America was attacked and out 
of the respect and character of who we 
are. 
This body, elected and respected 
around the world, in a time of crisis 
doesn’t speak of it and doesn’t act on it 
but only acts for themselves and, in a 
moment of time of using the rules to 
allow the opportunity to change its 
course and to correct them when they 
were wrong, the voice of the other side 
says: No, we could not turn the floor 
over to allow America to know how 
many Americans are there or to get a 
report on it. 
b 1415 
Just as they bang the gavel down, the 
90 minutes have come. You have asked 
enough questions. You can ask no more 
because we must get to the floor to 
pass $5 trillion and change election law 
so the Democrats believe they can buy 
and change an election. 
Madam Speaker, if there is any mo-
ment in time to put an election aside, 
if there is any moment in time to put 
politics aside, I would have thought 
today was the day. I would have 
thought we were being called back so 
that we could focus on what the rest of 
the world is focused on. 
So when the Speaker came to the 
floor to speak, I turned my volume up. 
Surely, she was going to speak of this 
day. Surely, she was going to talk 
about the Gold Star families. Surely, 
she was going to thank those veterans 
and those who have served here know-
ing what they are going through and 
what they are watching. 
And you know what she said? Speak-
er PELOSI actually said: Today is a 
great day of pride for our country and 
Democrats. Today is a great day of 
pride for our country and our Demo-
crats. 
Let me be very clear. It is not. It is 
an embarrassing day for our Nation. 
We are 3 weeks away from the twen-
tieth anniversary of 9/11, and this is 
what history will write. This is what 
you did with your majority. This is 
what you controlled. This is how you 
made sure you would not release the 
floor for the idea that Americans can 
find out how many are stuck in Af-
ghanistan or how they are going to get 
home. 
I hope you are proud of that because 
this is what your leadership has done. 
This is what your leadership worked 
on. This is what the power of the twist-
ing of the arm has delivered. The 
United States of America is not going 
to let terrorists dictate when and how 
we get Americans out. 
I firmly believe what has been said 
many times and especially by Abraham 
Lincoln, ‘‘ . . . government of the peo-
ple, by the people, for the people, shall 
not perish from the Earth.’’ If you be-
lieve that too and you are watching, I 
ask that you pick up your phones and 
you call, especially if you are a Demo-
crat because I do not think the leader-
ship here represents you with what 
they are asking for. I know your love 
of this country. 
I know the thousands upon thousands 
of Democrats who served their Nation, 
who served in Afghanistan, and I know 
those Americans who are in Afghani-
stan are not just of one party. I would 
like to see both parties work on the 
issue, what is really before us. 
Can you not put politics aside? Can 
you not care for one moment that you 
could rig an election to get elected? 
Can you not care about making govern-
ment so large that you are going to 
bring more inflation and trillions of 
dollars? 
That is what you spent last night on. 
That is what you spent the whole time 
on. That is what you brought us in for. 
That is what you closed the briefing 
on, but we couldn’t ask any more ques-
tions. Time is up. That is what you are 
fighting so hard for that a veteran who 
has served his country asked for a pre-
vious question to simply say: Can we 
get a report of how many Americans 
are still there? And asked that we do 
not pick a date when we get out until 
every American is out. 
But I heard the leadership on the 
other side say that we could not do 
that. We have to change the election 
law. We have to spend $5 trillion. This 
is what we came back for in a special 
session. This is what our mission is. 
Everyone who votes for this rule 
today, that is what you are voting for. 
That is what you are championing. 
That is what history will write. And, 
no, it is not a good day. Maybe in your 
caucus you think it is a great day for 
you and the Democrats. It is an embar-
rassing day for America. It is an em-
barrassing day for this floor, and it is 
embarrassing that you would even 
move forward with it. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Mem-
bers are reminded to direct their re-
marks to the Chair, and not to each 
other in the second person or to a per-
ceived viewing audience. 
Mr. NEGUSE. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, I want to thank my 
colleague on the Rules Committee for 
the respectful way in which she has en-
gaged in today’s debate. I wish I could 
say the same for all of the speeches 
that Members have delivered today. 
I think it is unfortunate to have 
deeply partisan speeches made on the 
floor on matters of such great signifi-
cance. I have great respect and rev-
erence for Democratic and Republican 
Members of this body who have served 
so honorably in our Nation’s Armed 
Forces and who have been working to-
gether to do everything they can, in 
concert with the administration, to 
evacuate Americans and our Afghan 
partners out of Afghanistan. 
I think it is unfortunate, as I said, to 
hear folks politicize that particular 
issue. I didn’t hear much, Madam 
Speaker, regarding the bipartisan in-
frastructure deal that we are consid-
ering today. I didn’t hear much by way 
of specifics in terms of the voting 
rights advancement act that we are 
considering today. Why? Because my 
friends on the other side of the aisle 
know that both the Build Back Better 
plan and the bipartisan infrastructure 
deal will create jobs, will lower costs, 
and will cut taxes. 
I wish we could have a reasonable de-
bate on the merits of these particular 
policies, but it is clear that some would 
prefer to avoid that debate entirely. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to 
the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. 
JACKSON LEE), my distinguished col-
league on the Judiciary Committee. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, 
I am very proud to be able to stand 
here today remembering the Constitu-
tion and saying to my good friends 
that this floor belongs to the American 
people. This floor is a floor, as John

Lewis has often challenged us, that 
calls upon us to be courageous. 
I am also here to say to you that I 
have no doubt that the United States 
military, with the will of the American 
people, will ensure that all Americans 
come out of Afghanistan and our allies. 
But at the same time, I am grateful for 
the idea of a build back America act 
that will have Texas get universal pre- 
K childcare, tuition-free community 
college. And then, of course, the invest 
act that will see us get $537 million for 
bridges, $100 million for broadband, $3.3 
billion for public transit so that our 
climate can improve. 
I know that the Texas delegation, 
State representatives who sacrificed 
and came to this Nation’s Capital to 
cry out for justice, Texas Democratic 
representatives who are here in this 
place now, that H.R. 4 is going to save 
the day, not partisan, but it is going to 
make us a democratic Republic. And 
we need to pass H.R. 4 because John 
Lewis said: Do you have any courage? 
Madam Speaker, as a senior member of the 
Judiciary Committee and an original cospon-
sor, I rise today in strong support of the Rule 
governing debate of Senate Amendment to 
H.R. 3684, Infrastructure Investment and Jobs 
Act; S. Con. Res. 14, Budget Resolution For 
Build Back Better Plan; and H.R. 4, the John 
Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act. 
Madam Speaker, as a senior member of the 
Committees on the Judiciary, on Homeland 
Security, and on the Budget, I rise in strong 
support of the Rule governing debate of Sen-
ate Amendment to H.R. 3684, the Infrastruc-
ture Investment and Jobs Act, which rep-
resents the most significant long-term invest-
ment in the United States’ infrastructure and 
competitiveness in nearly a century. 
This legislation will make life better for 
Americans across the country, create a gen-
eration of good-paying union jobs, grow our 
economy, invest in communities that have too 
often been left behind, and better position the 
United States to compete globally and win in 
the 21st century. 
The United States is the wealthiest country 
in the world, yet after decades of underinvest-
ment, the country’s roads, bridges, and water 
systems are crumbling, and our electric grid is 
vulnerable to catastrophic outages. 
Too many families lack access to affordable, 
high-speed internet, clean drinking water, and 
public transportation, and too often, past infra-
structure investments have disproportionately 
and negatively impacted low-income neighbor-
hoods and communities of color. 
Investing in our infrastructure—and investing 
in communities across the country—can cre-
ate millions of good-paying jobs in under-
served areas and lay the groundwork for not 
only a full economic recovery from the pan-
demic, but also usher in a new era of Amer-
ican innovation and prosperity. 
The historic Infrastructure Investment and 
Jobs Act invests $550 billion in new federal in-
vestment to make an array of transformational 
investments in our country’s infrastructure in-
cluding: 
$121 billion to repair and rebuild our roads 
and bridges with a focus on climate change 
mitigation, resilience, equity, and safety for all 
users, including cyclists and pedestrians. 
$89.9 billion to modernize America’s public 
transit, by increasing routes, reducing the tran-
sit maintenance backlog, and providing more 
frequent service, resulting in better options for 
riders, improved environmental outcomes, and 
increased access to jobs and essential des-
tinations. 
$66 billion to modernize and expand pas-
senger and freight rail networks across the 
country, to position our railways to play a cen-
tral role in our transportation and economic fu-
ture. 
$15 billion in zero emission and clean buses 
and ferries and to build the first-ever national 
network of electric vehicle chargers in the 
United States, in order to address the adop-
tion of electric vehicles and support domestic 
manufacturing jobs. 
$42 billion to modernize our airports, ports, 
and waterways; 
$50 billion to weatherize our infrastructure 
and insulate it against the threats of droughts, 
floods, and wildfires. 
$55 billion to drinking water infrastructure, 
including eliminating the Nation’s lead service 
lines and pipes, thereby delivering clean drink-
ing water to up to ten million American fami-
lies and more than 400,000 schools and child 
care facilities that currently do not have it, in-
cluding in Tribal nations and disadvantaged 
communities. 
$65 billion to upgrade our power infrastruc-
ture to facilitate the expansion of renewable 
energy. 
$21 billion in environmental remediation, 
making it the largest investment in addressing 
the legacy pollution that harms the public 
health of communities and neighborhoods in 
American history. 
$65 billion to connect every American to re-
liable high-speed internet, building on the bil-
lions of dollars for broadband deployment in 
the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021. 
Across this country, far too many commu-
nities are struggling with crumbling roads and 
structurally unsound bridges, outrageous con-
gestion, lead-coated pipes and no broadband 
access. 
The Senate Amendment to H.R. 3684 ad-
dresses economic disparities in our economy 
and the consequences of decades of dis-
investment in America’s infrastructure that 
have fallen most heavily on communities of 
color. 
Through critical investments, the legislation 
increases access to good-paying jobs, afford-
able high-speed internet, reliable public transit, 
clean drinking water and other resources to 
ensure communities of color get a fair shot at 
the American dream. 
These critical investments are first steps in 
advancing equity and racial justice throughout 
our economy. 
Additional investments are needed in our 
nation’s caregiving infrastructure, housing sup-
ply, regional development, and workforce de-
velopment programs to ensure that commu-
nities of color and other underserved commu-
nities can access economic opportunity and 
justice. 
This bill will address these challenges, and 
will also deliver much-needed investment to 
my home state of Texas, making life better for 
millions of Texas residents. 
Specifically, under the bill, Texas is ex-
pected to receive: 
$26.9 billion for federal-aid highway appor-
tioned programs and $537 million for bridge 
replacement and repairs with a focus on cli-
mate change mitigation, resilience, equity, and 
safety for all users, including cyclists and pe-
destrians; 
$3.3 billion over five years to improve public 
transportation options across the state through 
healthy, sustainable transportation options for 
millions of Americans; 
$408 million over five years to support the 
expansion of an EV charging network in the 
state; and 
Texas will also have the opportunity to apply 
for the $2.5 billion in grant funding dedicated 
to EV charging in the bill; 
A minimum allocation of $100 million to help 
provide broadband coverage across the state, 
including 
providing 
access 
to 
at 
least 
1,058,000 Texans who currently lack it. 
In addition, 8,381,000 or 29% of people in 
Texas will be eligible for the Affordability 
Connectivity Benefit, which will help low-in-
come families afford internet access. 
Madam Speaker, in sum, I encourage all 
members to support the Rule governing de-
bate of Senate Amendment to H.R. 3684 In-
frastructure Investment and Jobs Act, so that 
we can invest in strengthening our infrastruc-
ture and competitiveness, and do so in a way 
that creates the good-paying union jobs of the 
future, addresses long-standing racial and 
economic injustice, and helps to fight the cli-
mate crisis. 
Madam Speaker, as a senior member of the 
Committees on the Judiciary, on Homeland 
Security, and on the Budget, I rise in strong 
support of the Rule governing debate of S. 
Con. Res. 14, which reorders budgetary prior-
ities to provide $3.5 trillion investments to 
build back better and provides reconciliation 
instructions to 13 House and 12 Senate com-
mittees to support visionary and transformative 
investments in the health, well-being, and fi-
nancial security of America’s workers and fam-
ilies. 
It is often said that the federal budget is an 
expression of the nation’s values and the 
budget resolution before us is a clear declara-
tion of congressional Democrats’ commitment 
to ensuring that our government, our econ-
omy, and our systems work For The People. 
Madam Speaker, these long-overdue invest-
ments in America’s future will be felt in every 
corner of the country and across every sector 
of American life, building on the success of 
the American Rescue Plan, accommodating 
historic infrastructure investments in the legis-
lative pipeline, and addressing long-standing 
deficits in our communities by ending an era 
of chronic underinvestment so we can emerge 
from our current crises a stronger, more equi-
table nation. 
Should our friends across the aisle join us 
in this endeavor, it would send a powerful sig-
nal to the American people if our colleagues 
across the aisle would join us in this effort be-
cause nothing would better show them that 
their elected representatives can set partisan-
ship aside and put America first. 
And that bipartisan achievement would por-
tend success for similar initiatives in the area 
of strengthening the infrastructure of democ-
racy in which every American has a vital inter-
est, national and homeland security, and crimi-
nal justice and immigration reform. 
I would urge my Republican colleagues to 
heed the words of Republican Governor Jim 
Justice of West Virginia who said colorfully 
several months ago, ‘‘At this point in time in 
this nation, we need to go big. We need to 
quit counting the egg-sucking legs on the

cows and count the cows and just move. And 
move forward and move right now.’’ 
The same sentiment was expressed more 
eloquently by Abraham Lincoln in 1862 when 
he memorably wrote: 
‘‘The dogmas of the quiet past are inad-
equate to the stormy present. The occasion is 
piled high with difficulty, and we must rise with 
the occasion. As our case is new, so we must 
think anew and act anew. We must disenthrall 
ourselves, and then we shall save our coun-
try.’’ 
Madam Speaker, the bipartisan action we 
took in February 2021 when we passed the 
American Rescue Plan was a giant step in the 
right direction, but it was a targeted response 
to the immediate and urgent public health and 
economic crises; it was not a long-term solu-
tion to many of the pressing challenges facing 
our nation that have built up over decades of 
disinvestment in our nation and its people in 
every region and sector of the country. 
We simply can no longer afford the costs of 
neglect and inaction; the time to act is now. 
The Build Back Better Plan makes the 
transformative investments that we need to 
continue growing our economy, lower costs for 
working families, and position the United 
States as a global leader in innovation and the 
jobs of the future. 
This $3.5 trillion gross investment will build 
on the successes of the American Rescue 
Plan and set our nation on a path of fiscal re-
sponsibility and broadly shared prosperity for 
generations to come. 
The Build Back Better Plan will provide re-
sources to improve our education, health, and 
child care systems, invest in clean energy and 
sustainability, address the housing crisis, and 
more; all while setting America up to compete 
and win in the decades ahead. 
The Build Back Better Plan is paid for by 
ensuring that the wealthy and big corporations 
are paying their fair share and Americans 
making less than $400,000 a year will not see 
their taxes increase by a penny. 
Let me repeat that: No American making 
less than $400,000 a year will not see their 
taxes increase by a penny. 
In sum, Madam Speaker, the investments 
made by the Build Back Better Plan will ex-
pand opportunity for all and build an economy 
powered by shared prosperity and inclusive 
growth. 
Madam Speaker, while I am proud to 
strongly support this Rule and underlying bill, 
I would be remiss if I did not express my dis-
appointment at the Rules Committee’s deci-
sion to not include my amendments to this bill. 
Jackson Lee Amendments #6, #7, and #8 
are easy to understand and vitally important— 
they simply protect state legislators who, in 
keeping with their sacred oath to uphold the 
Constitution of the United States, refuse to 
perform unconstitutional acts under the guise 
of legislative process. 
Specifically: 
Jackson Lee Amendment #6 allows for fed-
eral judicial review of any warrants issued for 
the arrest of a state legislator where said state 
legislator refuses to engage in the state legis-
lative process due to a reasonably held belief 
that doing so would infringe on the right to 
vote. 
Jackson Lee Amendment #7 inserts a 
Sense of the Congress stating that a state’s 
power to arrest a duly elected representative 
of a constituency for refusal to engage in a 
state’s legislative process should be subject to 
federal judicial review where such elected rep-
resentative’s refusal is premised upon a rea-
sonable belief that participation would result in 
the suppression of voting rights or other viola-
tions of the Constitution of the United States 
of America. 
Jackson Lee Amendment #8 privileges 
against arrest any member of a state legisla-
ture for any reason except treason or murder 
while the legislature of that state is debating or 
voting on legislation relating to redistricting or 
election practices or legislation relating to the 
right to vote in federal, state, or municipal 
elections. 
These amendments would have critically 
strengthened H.R. 4 because state legisla-
tures across the country are utilizing every 
weapon in their arsenal to curtail voting rights; 
and no one should fear arrest due to fighting 
for the Constitutional rights of their constitu-
ents. 
This includes my home state of Texas, 
where earlier this month officers of the Texas 
House of Representatives delivered civil arrest 
warrants, signed by the Texas state Speaker 
of the House, for more than 50 absent Demo-
crats in an attempt force a vote on the naked 
attempt at voter suppression known as Texas 
S.B. 7. 
This is the latest Republican attack on these 
brave state legislators, which began on May 
30, where after a night of impassioned debate 
and procedural objections, these Democratic 
lawmakers in Texas took action to block pas-
sage of this massive overhaul of the state’s 
election laws. 
Since the arrest warrants were issued, it is 
my understanding that mass intimidation of the 
Texas House Democrats has occurred. 
State officials came to their homes with the 
purpose of dragging them back to eviscerate 
the voting rights of thousands of Texans. 
These elected Texas Representatives have 
had to hide away from their friends, their fami-
lies, and their loved ones, all to ensure that 
Texans retain their most sacred of rights. 
They are risking their freedom to ensure 
every Texan has full access to their constitu-
tional right to vote. 
Texas Republicans seek to pass voting reg-
ulation laws focused on diverse, urban areas, 
by setting rules for the distribution of polling 
places in only the handful of counties with a 
population of at least 1 million—most of which 
are either under Democratic control or won by 
Democrats in recent national and statewide 
elections. 
Standing between all of this and the voting 
rights of thousands of Texans are those brave 
state legislators who currently have a warrant 
out for their arrest. 
No elected representative in this great na-
tion should fear that he or she will be locked 
away for simply standing up for justice and en-
suring that America’s citizens have the right to 
vote. 
For this reason, I believe that H.R. 4 would 
have been greatly strengthened by the inclu-
sion of my amendments in the Rule. 
I strongly encourage all Members of Con-
gress to support this Rule and the underlying 
bill, because it is the responsibility and sacred 
duty of all members of Congress who revere 
democracy to preserve, protect, and expand 
the precious right to vote of all Americans by 
passing H.R. 4, the John Lewis Voting Rights 
Advancement Act. 
Madam Speaker, I am here today to remind 
the nation that the need to pass this legislation 
is urgent because the right to vote—that ‘‘pow-
erful instrument that can break down the walls 
of injustice’’—faces grave threats. 
The threat stems from the decision issued in 
June 2013 by the Supreme Court in Shelby 
County v Holder, 570 U.S. 193 (2013), which 
invalidated Section 4(b) of the VRA, and para-
lyzed the application of the VRA’s Section 5 
preclearance requirements. 
Not to be content with the monument to dis-
grace that is the Shelby County decision, the 
activist right-wing conservative majority on the 
Roberts Court, on July 1, 2021, issued its evil 
twin, the decision in Brnovich v. DNC, 594 
U.S. ll, No. 19–1257 and 19–1258 (July 1, 
2021), which engrafts on Section 2 of the Vot-
ing Rights Act onerous burdens that Congress 
never 
intended 
and 
explicitly 
legislated 
against. 
Madam Speaker, were it not for the 24th 
Amendment, I venture to say that this con-
servative majority on the Court would subject 
poll taxes and literacy tests to the review 
standard enunciated in Brnovich v. DNC. 
According to the Supreme Court majority, 
the reason for striking down Section 4(b) of 
the Voting Rights Act was that ‘‘times 
change.’’ 
Now, the Court was right; times have 
changed. 
But what the Court did not fully appreciate 
is that the positive changes it cited are due al-
most entirely to the existence and vigorous 
enforcement of the Voting Rights Act. 
And that is why the Voting Rights Act is still 
needed and that is why we must pass H.R. 4, 
the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement 
Act. 
Let me put it this way: in the same way that 
the vaccine invented by Dr. Jonas Salk in 
1953 eradicated the crippling effects but did 
not eliminate the cause of polio, the Voting 
Rights Act succeeded in stymieing the prac-
tices that resulted in the wholesale disenfran-
chisement of African Americans and language 
minorities but did not eliminate them entirely. 
The Voting Rights Act is needed as much 
today to prevent another epidemic of voting 
disenfranchisement as Dr. Salk’s vaccine is 
still needed to prevent another polio epidemic. 
As Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg stated in 
Shelby County v. Holder, ‘‘[t]hrowing out 
preclearance when it has worked and is con-
tinuing to work to stop discriminatory changes 
is like throwing away your umbrella in a rain-
storm because you are not getting wet.’’ 
For millions of Americans, the right to vote 
protected by the Voting Rights Act of 1965 is 
a sacred treasure, earned by the sweat and 
toil and tears and blood of ordinary Americans 
who showed the world it was possible to ac-
complish extraordinary things. 
I strongly encourage all Members of Con-
gress to support this bill, because it is the re-
sponsibility and sacred duty of all members of 
Congress who revere democracy to preserve, 
protect, and expand the precious right to vote 
of all Americans by passing H.R. 4, the John 
Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act. 
Mrs. FISCHBACH. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from 
Louisiana (Mr. SCALISE), the minority 
whip. 
Mr. SCALISE. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentlewoman from Min-
nesota for yielding.

August 24, 2021 
Madam Speaker, I rise to object to 
this whole process. What we are doing 
here today, this is an example of the 
misplaced priorities of this Democrat 
majority. 
Let’s start with the bill at hand, this 
package of bills that includes a budget 
that I am sure very few people in this 
Chamber have read, that authorizes the 
taxing and spending of trillions more 
dollars. 
Now, what does that mean? They call 
it the for the children act. It really 
should be called the mountains of debt 
for the children act because that is 
what it does. If you look at inflation 
today, every family in America is fac-
ing inflation. They are paying over 40 
percent more for gasoline, for cars, for 
things that they buy at the grocery 
store. 
Families know that if you add tril-
lions more in debt, trillions more in 
spending, trillions more in taxes, infla-
tion will only go up and you know who 
is going to pay for it. It is not anybody 
in this Chamber, Madam Speaker. 
Under their own budget—it says it—it 
is the children. That is who is going to 
pay for it. 
Right here. Just go to page 7 where it 
authorizes up to $45 trillion in debt— 
we are at about $28.6 trillion right 
now—$45 trillion in debt with taxes and 
spending through the roof that will hit 
every 
family 
in 
America, 
Madam 
Speaker. 
Then let’s get back to those prior-
ities. Now, you would think with the 
backdrop of everything that we have 
been dealing with in Afghanistan, as 
we here in this Chamber, with so many 
of our veterans who served in Afghani-
stan honorably, have been calling on 
the President to ensure and commit 
that he will get all Americans out. Yet, 
what is our President doing? I will tell 
you what he has been doing. He has 
been working the phones pressuring 
Members of Congress this week. 
I wish, Madam Speaker, I could say 
he was pressuring Members of Congress 
to help get Americans out. That is not 
what he was doing. He was working the 
phones this week pressuring Members 
of Congress to vote for this trillions of 
dollars in spending and tax package. 
That has been President Biden’s pri-
ority. 
He just said today he is going to bow 
to the Taliban’s deadline of August 31 
even if we don’t get all Americans out. 
President Biden should be the Presi-
dent of the United States; not bowing 
to terrorists; not bowing to anybody 
except committing that he will get all 
Americans out instead of living by 
some artificial deadline. 
Every ounce of his energy ought to 
be focused between now and next Tues-
day, the date he set and the date the 
Taliban set, every minute he ought to 
be spending between now and next 
Tuesday should be focused on getting 
all Americans out. But if he fails to do 
it, people will look back and say: What 
was he doing instead? What were the 
President of the United States’ prior-
ities? He was pressuring Members of 
Congress to vote for this garbage: tril-
lions of dollars in debt and spending, 
rather than focus on getting Americans 
out of harm’s way that he left behind. 
It is a national and international dis-
grace. Our priorities ought to be with 
the American people. That is what we 
will fight for. That is why we oppose 
this whole process. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Mem-
bers are reminded to refrain from en-
gaging in personalities toward the 
President. 
Mr. NEGUSE. Madam Speaker, while 
I would relish the opportunity to re-
spond to the points made by my col-
league, we have a lot of enthusiasm on 
our side to speak in support of this 
rule. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to 
the gentlewoman from Connecticut 
(Ms. 
DELAURO), 
the 
distinguished 
chairwoman of the Committee on Ap-
propriations, who has led on the child 
tax cut for decades. 
Ms. DELAURO. Madam Speaker, this 
rule allows us to move forward on re-
building our Nation’s crumbling infra-
structure, restoring the power of the 
Voting Rights Act, and an historic 
budget resolution that advances our 
priorities by making critical invest-
ments to expand our Nation’s social 
safety net to continue to build back 
better. 
For far too long, the deck has been 
stacked for the wealthy and the well- 
connected, while middle-class hard-
working families and the vulnerable 
have been left behind. 
After decades of disinvestment, we 
have an opportunity today to make 
history, to deliver on a promise we 
made to the American people: to build 
a stronger, fairer future for our kids; a 
once-in-a-lifetime 
moment, 
creating 
more jobs, cutting middle-class taxes, 
while simply asking the biggest cor-
porations and the top 1 percent to pay 
their fair share of taxes. 
What are the transformative issues 
in this bill: expanding to improve the 
child tax credit already acclaimed to 
cut child poverty and hunger with only 
one payment; guaranteeing affordable 
high-quality childcare; tackling the 
long-term healthcare crisis; access to 
long-term services and supports for 
aging loved ones and those with dis-
abilities; universal pre-K; 2 years of 
tuition-free community college; maxi-
mizing the Pell grant award; launching 
the first-of-its-kind paid family and 
medical leave benefits; historic invest-
ments ranking alongside the New Deal 
and the Great Society, standing the 
test of time and strengthening our so-
ciety. 
President Roosevelt didn’t just re-
build America. He created Social Secu-
rity, and when it came to infrastruc-
ture and human needs, he did both. So 
to meet today’s moment, we must and 
we can do both. We have that oppor-
tunity not to throw money at a prob-
lem but to build the architecture for 
the future. 
Today, we must advance this rule 
and 
the 
budget 
resolution, 
dem-
onstrating our commitment to our val-
ues, making a difference in the lives of 
so many Americans. This is a moral 
imperative. And to paraphrase Presi-
dent Franklin Roosevelt: This is our 
rendezvous with destiny, a watershed 
moment. Don’t let the moment pass. It 
will not come back again. Let’s seize it 
with action, with hope and unity of 
purpose for a better, stronger America.

Mrs. FISCHBACH. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman 
from California (Mrs. KIM). 
Mrs. KIM of CALIFORNIA. Madam 
Speaker, I would like to thank the gen-
tlewoman from Minnesota for yielding. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today in oppo-
sition to the rule that is being debated 
as we consider the $3.5 trillion budget 
reconciliation. 
I rise today in support of workers, 
families, and businesses in commu-
nities I represent in California’s 39th 
Congressional District. 
Now is the time for Congress to show 
it can work together for the American 
people. 
As our economy recovers during the 
COVID–19 pandemic and Americans 
across the country pay more every-
where from the grocery store to the gas 
pump, Democrats are once again by-
passing bipartisanship and moving for-
ward with a partisan $3.5 trillion budg-
et. 
According to Tax Foundation, this 
budget reconciliation would also raise 
taxes for people I represent in Califor-
nia’s 39th District by an average of 
over $600. My constituents have been 
burdened enough by some of the high-
est State taxes in the country. 
Now, our Nation is scrambling to 
keep promises we made in Afghanistan 
to Americans and Afghan partners. The 
last thing we need is trillions more in 
spending on unrelated priorities and 
more taxes. This makes no sense. 
The majority’s budget will increase 
prices, raise taxes, and take even more 
money out of taxpayers’ pockets. I 
urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘no’’ on 
this reconciliation. 
Mr. NEGUSE. Madam Speaker, my 
colleague from California is certainly 
right about one thing, the Build Back 
Better plan would raise taxes on bil-
lionaires. The tax cuts that ultimately 
were approved by my colleagues on the 
other side of the aisle several years ago 
for the richest Americans in our coun-
try, we do not pursue that in our bill. 
Instead, we pursue tax cuts for working 
families, for middle-class Americans. 
Madam Speaker, I would like to yield 
2 minutes to the gentlewoman from 
California (Ms. WATERS), the distin-
guished chairwoman of the Committee 
on Financial Services, whose leader-
ship has kept millions of Americans in 
their homes over the course of the last 
year. 
Ms. WATERS. Madam Speaker, I rise 
in support of the rule, which would

August 24, 2021 
pass the House’s budget resolution. The 
budget resolution will make historic 
investments in housing in this country. 
We are in the middle of a housing cri-
sis. As chairwoman of the Financial 
Services Committee, it is not lost on 
me that more than 580,000 people expe-
rience 
homelessness 
on 
any 
given 
night, while millions of families are, at 
this moment, paying the bulk of their 
income toward rent. 
The bottom line is that housing is in-
frastructure. This is why I introduced 
groundbreaking legislation, the Hous-
ing Is Infrastructure Act of 2021, to pro-
vide more than $600 billion to address 
our country’s affordable housing crisis, 
increase first-generation homeowner-
ship, and end homelessness. 
While the budget resolution only al-
locates $339 billion to the Financial 
Services Committee, this funding is 
still historic and will transform the 
lives of millions of families. However, 
we must first pass the budget resolu-
tion so that we can then pass the Presi-
dent’s Build Back Better agenda, in-
cluding this historic funding for hous-
ing programs. 
This rule also brings us one step clos-
er to the critical House passage of H.R. 
4, the John R. Lewis Voting Rights Ad-
vancement Act. 
This President is going to bring all of 
the Americans who want to come 
home, home. 
Mrs. FISCHBACH. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from 
Florida (Mr. WALTZ). 
Mr. WALTZ. Madam Speaker, I rise 
in support of Representative GALLA-
GHER’s bill, to get us some simple facts: 
How many Americans are stranded and 
are we going to get them home. 
Yes, these issues are important. We 
should debate these issues. Infrastruc-
ture, healthcare, all of these issues are 
critical to our country. 
But the number one job of the Fed-
eral Government is to keep Americans 
safe. Today, America is less safe. 
Americans are stranded behind enemy 
lines, and they are not all going to get 
out by August 31. 
Colleagues, what happens in Afghani-
stan does not stay in Afghanistan. It 
will follow us home. Terrorism is a 
cancer that once again will threaten 
the United States. 
I want everyone to see this picture 
and remember it: Osama bin Laden—by 
the way, then-Vice President Biden op-
posed the raid to bring this man to jus-
tice. His deputy, Ayman al-Zawahiri— 
know that name—who is now leading 
al-Qaida, now has a terrorism play-
ground from which to plot and plan at-
tacks on the United States once again. 
The intelligence has been clear. Al- 
Qaida 3.0 will come roaring back. The 
Taliban equals al-Qaida. As we head 
into the 20th anniversary of 9/11, we 
once again are going to face the pros-
pect of more Pulse nightclubs, San 
Bernardinos, and, God forbid, another 
9/11. 
What has me so upset, so flaming 
mad, as a veteran, as a Green Beret 
that has had to fight this fight, is fu-
ture soldiers are now going to have to 
go back and deal with this again, but 
now with no bases, no local allies, and 
a Taliban that is armed to the teeth 
with our own equipment. That is un-
conscionable. It is unacceptable. If the 
White House won’t lead, then Congress 
will. 
Mr. NEGUSE. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman 
from Alabama (Ms. SEWELL). 
Ms. SEWELL. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today in full support of H.R. 4, the 
John R. Lewis Voting Rights Advance-
ment Act. 
Madam Speaker, I have the great 
privilege of not only representing Bir-
mingham, Montgomery, and my home-
town of Selma, Alabama, but growing 
up, literally, at the foot of the Edmund 
Pettus Bridge, I had an opportunity 
time and time again to see John Lewis 
in action. 
John 
would 
come 
to 
my 
home 
church, Brown Chapel AME Church, to 
remind us all that what happened on 
that bridge 56 years ago was that 
Americans, ordinary Americans, dared 
to stand up to this country and to 
make sure that it lived up to its ideals 
of justice and equality for all. 
I am proud to say that I get to walk 
in the footsteps of John Lewis, but I 
am more proud of the fact that so 
many of us in this Chamber walked 
with him. 
The best way that we can live up to 
the legacy of John Lewis is to remem-
ber that he fought for every American 
to have the equal right to vote, equal 
access to the ballot box. 
I get that the Voting Rights Act of 
1965 is reserved for the most egregious 
State actors. But what it says is that 
Federal 
oversight 
is 
needed 
when 
States go amok. 
Since the Shelby v. Holder decision, I 
have introduced, in four successive 
Congresses, the Voting Rights Ad-
vancement Act, and we renamed it the 
John R. Lewis Voting Rights Advance-
ment Act. 
We must live up to John’s ideals of 
equality and justice for all in voting 
rights. What we have seen in States 
like Georgia and Texas, and around 
this country, has been State legisla-
tures making it harder for people to 
vote. 
I just want to say that we must get 
into good trouble, necessary trouble. 
John reminded us that we must be cou-
rageous in the face of adversity and in 
the face of inequity. I ask for you to 
please vote for H.R. 4 and vote for the 
rule that would get it to the floor. 
Mrs. FISCHBACH. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from 
Alabama (Mr. ROGERS), the ranking 
member of the Armed Services Com-
mittee. 
Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Madam 
Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to 
this rule. 
For 4 months, Republicans have de-
manded to know the President’s plan 
to evacuate Americans and Afghan al-
lies and conduct counterterrorism op-
erations in Afghanistan. For 4 months, 
they have told us: ‘‘We are working on 
it.’’ 
Well, now it is clear they never had a 
plan. The President’s abject failure to 
plan is endangering the lives of thou-
sands of American civilians and our al-
lies in Afghanistan. 
Reports have been rolling in for over 
a week of Americans being assaulted or 
having to hide from Taliban thugs 
while they wait for a rescue. Afghan al-
lies are being brutalized and killed by 
these terrorists as they desperately try 
to get inside the gates of the Kabul air-
port. 
And that is just those lucky enough 
to be in Kabul. Thousands of Ameri-
cans and Afghan allies are still strand-
ed hundreds of miles away from Kabul 
with little hope of rescue. 
Now comes an ultimatum from the 
terrorists that if our forces don’t with-
draw by next Tuesday, they will start 
shooting. 
What is the response from the major-
ity? Well, Speaker PELOSI brought us 
back to Washington, but not to deal 
with this dire situation in Afghanistan. 
No, we are here today to vote on a par-
tisan, $4 trillion giveaway to the rad-
ical left; a bill that doesn’t include a 
single dollar to rescue Americans or 
our allies from Afghanistan or even a 
single penny on national security. 
I have to wonder what the majority 
is thinking. Instead of this partisan ex-
ercise, I urge the majority to work 
with us to hold the President account-
able and save Americans and allies still 
in Afghanistan. 
Mr. NEGUSE. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 30 seconds to the gentleman from 
Ohio (Mr. RYAN). 
Mr. RYAN. Madam Speaker, we see 
our Republican friends are very upset. 
They said: This is embarrassing. What 
are we doing? What have we done? 
What you are mad about is that we 
are delivering for the American people. 
We saved pensions; we cut taxes for 
working-class people; we invested in 
the communities, and we invested in 
the schools. Now, universal preschool; 
everyone can go to community college; 
vision, dental, hearing for Medicare re-
cipients; and paid family leave. 
If you think for one second I am 
going to apologize for what we are 
doing, you are wrong. 
Once again, we should have done this 
30 or 40 years ago. And, obviously, once 
again, the Republican Party is MIA. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Ms. SE-
WELL). Members are reminded to ad-
dress their remarks to the Chair. 
Mrs. FISCHBACH. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from 
Texas (Mr. ELLZEY). 
Mr. ELLZEY. Madam Speaker, I rise 
to urge defeat of the previous question 
so that we can immediately consider 
H.R. 5071. 
Operations Enduring Freedom and 
Freedom’s Sentinel are coming to a 
conclusion in a way that no American 
should be willing to tolerate nor ac-
cept. This conflict began nearly 20

August 24, 2021 
years ago. There have been 2,443 U.S. 
military killed in action, 3,800 con-
tractor and DOD civilians killed in ac-
tion, 1,144 allied troops killed in action, 
and over 30,000 veteran suicides since 
9/11; the victims of their internal and 
unseen wounds. 
In Texas District 6, we lost Staff Ser-
geant Jeremy S. on April 6, 2011, and 
Private First Class Joel R. on April 16, 
2011. Brothers in arms, killed 10 days 
apart. 
In Texas, we have lost 193 of our sons 
and daughters, all of whom, like Luke 
Bushatz would say: ‘‘Not one ounce of 
sweat or blood in the defense of others 
is a waste.’’ But last week, this admin-
istration handed over 600,000 weapons, 
75,000 vehicles, and 200 aircraft to the 
enemy. 
What we have now is September 10, 
2001, with a well-armed enemy. 
For those who have stood the watch 
and those who have died standing that 
watch, duty, honor, and country is not 
an academic study; it is a way of life 
and sometimes death. 
So I call on our Commander in Chief, 
Madam Speaker, to take those words 
as seriously as we do and to do his duty 
to honor our servicemembers and their 
families by informing this body, and 
the Americans we represent, every day 
on what is happening on the ground in 
Afghanistan and what this administra-
tion is doing to bring American citi-
zens, and the Afghans who helped us, to 
safety. 
Infrastructure needs did not leave 
10,000 to 15,000 Americans stranded. Cli-
mate change did not cause this catas-
trophe. Combat is a not a PowerPoint 
briefing. American lives are at stake. 
Get our countrymen out of Afghani-
stan. The mission is only complete 
when they are out, not one minute be-
fore. 
Mr. NEGUSE. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
b 1445 
Mrs. FISCHBACH. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 11⁄2
minutes to the gentleman 
from Texas (Mr. ARRINGTON). 
Mr. ARRINGTON. Madam Speaker, 
with respect to the rule and bills, if 
someone were to devise a plan to inten-
tionally destroy the great State of 
Texas, they would do the following: 
They 
would 
sabotage 
their 
sov-
ereignty by opening its borders and 
granting amnesty and citizenship. 
They would steal the right to safe-
guard the integrity of their elections. 
They would strip the freedoms of 
both employees and employers by forc-
ing unionization of the workforce. 
They would destroy its agriculture 
and energy economy by abusing their 
regulatory authority and weaponizing 
the tax code in the name of a politi-
cally manufactured climate crisis. 
They would crush the most pros-
perous economy in the Nation under 
the weight of the highest tax rates in 
the world. 
They would quench the spirit of self- 
reliance. 
They would diminish the dignity of 
work by trapping their citizens in an 
endless cycle of government depend-
ence and poverty. 
And they would permanently plunder 
the freedom and independence of the 
Lone Star State by saddling future 
generations with a debt they could 
never repay. 
While this legislation, Madam Speak-
er, may not have been written with the 
intention of destroying the State of 
Texas, it is clear that should these bills 
pass, that is exactly what it would do, 
and not only to my great State but to 
the entire Nation. 
Mr. NEGUSE. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mrs. FISCHBACH. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentleman from 
Arizona (Mr. SCHWEIKERT). 
Mr. SCHWEIKERT. Madam Speaker, 
this is a moment where I am hoping 
our friends on the left will keep a cer-
tain promise that many of you have 
made, Madam Speaker, because we 
have a long list of the promises from 
the President to leadership and to oth-
ers promising that this spending will 
be 100 percent paid for. 
You already know we are going to 
have probably a continuing resolution 
with the omnibus. There is a trillion 
dollars of structural debt there. Okay. 
And the $1.2 trillion so-called bipar-
tisan—bipartisan in the Senate. 
Okay, when we actually do the hon-
est math, it is not a quarter trillion of 
borrowing; it is about $500 billion of 
borrowing because a bunch of the pay- 
fors are fake. 
When we start looking at what Sen-
ate Finance and others—where are you 
getting the other $1.7 trillion on your 
$3.5 trillion of spending? 
Look, I am just asking you to keep a 
promise because when you add up all 
the new revenues, all the new receipts, 
all the new tax hikes, the corporate tax 
hikes that unemployed some million 
Americans in 24 months, the capital 
gains tax that loses money, where are 
you going to get all this cash that you 
have promised will be 100 percent paid 
for? 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair again reminds Members to ad-
dress their remarks to the Chair. 
Mr. NEGUSE. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentleman from 
Maryland (Mr. HOYER), the distin-
guished majority leader. 
Mr. HOYER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
in support of this rule. This rule allows 
the Congress of the United States to do 
the people’s business in two critical 
areas—actually, three. 
Number one, it provides for us to re-
ceive from the Senate the budget and 
to do what the Republicans did on their 
tax bill: act on a budget reconciliation 
bill. 
You did that. You, of course, didn’t 
pay for it. We are going to pay for this. 
Secondly, this rule allows us to pro-
ceed on a piece of legislation which 
seeks to make sure that the Voting 
Rights Act, protecting the most impor-
tant asset a citizen has, and that is 
their right to vote or, as our Speaker 
has said, the voice of those not empow-
ered. That is not exactly what it was, 
Madam Speaker. 
Two of these items are critical, and 
when we talk about saving lives, the 
reconciliation bill and the budget, the 
Build Back Better Act is going to save 
lives and enrich the quality of lives of 
our people. 
Thirdly, this rule will allow us to 
proceed to adopt the bipartisan—69 
Senators voting for it—infrastructure 
bill. It is not a perfect bill. It is not our 
bill, and it is limited in some respects 
in terms of its addressing one of our 
most important challenges and en-
emies, and that is climate change. It 
nevertheless is a very, very substantial 
investment in America, its growth, 
people, and jobs. 
Vote for this rule. It is a good bill for 
the people. 
Mrs. FISCHBACH. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume to close. 
Madam Speaker, Democrats continue 
to ram through controversial policies 
and reckless spending with a complete 
disregard for the rules and with no con-
sideration of what those decisions will 
mean for future generations and what 
they have to pay back. 
President Biden took office saying he 
would be President for everybody, but 
he certainly isn’t acting like that. The 
legislation before us today that is in-
cluded in this rule would leave rural 
communities behind, concentrate even 
more power at the Federal level, and 
tax and spend recklessly. 
The President is too busy pressuring 
Members of his own party to support $5 
trillion in spending to even address the 
crisis in Afghanistan. 
Madam Speaker, I oppose the rule 
and the underlying bills, and I ask 
Members to do the same. I yield back 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. NEGUSE. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself the balance of my time to 
close. 
We have heard a lot about partisan-
ship during the course of today’s de-
bate. 
What are the three bills that we are 
considering within the rule today? 
The John R. Lewis Voting Rights Ad-
vancement Act, a reauthorization of 
the Voting Rights Act. VRA has been 
reauthorized 
by 
Republicans 
and 
Democrats in the United States Con-
gress for decades. The last time it was 
signed by George W. Bush, a Repub-
lican. 
A bipartisan infrastructure deal that 
earned the votes of 69 Senators, 19 Re-
publicans, 
including 
MITCH
MCCON-
NELL, but apparently, that proposal is 
too radical for the House Republican 
Conference. 
And a Build Back Better plan that 
would invest in American families, 
that would lower costs, that would cut 
taxes for working families. 
Americans are worth investing in. 
Our families, our students, our teach-
ers, our firefighters, our communities

are worth investing in. And we have a 
chance to do that today. 
The late Congressman John Lewis 
once said that every generation leaves 
behind a legacy. What that legacy will 
be is determined by the people of that 
generation. Madam Speaker, I would 
say that our legacy must be one of 
progress, of courage, and of action. 
I urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘yes’’ 
on this rule and on the previous ques-
tion. 
The material previously referred to 
by Mrs. FISCHBACH is as follows: 
AMENDMENT TO HOUSE RESOLUTION 601 
At the end of the resolution, add the fol-
lowing: 
SEC. 7. Immediately upon adoption of this 
resolution, the House shall proceed to the 
consideration in the House of the bill (H.R. 
5071) to direct the Secretary of Defense to 
submit to Congress daily reports on the 
evacuation of citizens and permanent resi-
dents of the United States from Afghanistan, 
and for other purposes. All points of order 
against consideration of the bill are waived. 
The bill shall be considered as read. All 
points of order against provisions in the bill 
are waived. The previous question shall be 
considered as ordered on the bill and on any 
amendment thereto to final passage without 
intervening motion except: (1) one hour of 
debate equally divided and controlled by the 
chair and ranking minority member of the 
Committee on Armed Services; and (2) one 
motion to recommit. 
SEC. 8. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not 
apply to the consideration of H.R. 5071. 
Mr. NEGUSE. Madam Speaker, I 
yield back the balance of my time, and 
I move the previous question on the 
resolution. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on ordering the previous 
question. 
The question was taken; and the 
Speaker pro tempore announced that 
the ayes appeared to have it. 
Mrs. FISCHBACH. Madam Speaker, 
on that I demand the yeas and nays. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to section 3(s) of House Resolution 
8, the yeas and nays are ordered. 
The vote was taken by electronic de-
vice, and there were—yeas 220, nays 
212, not voting 0, as follows:

JOHN R. LEWIS VOTING RIGHTS 
ADVANCEMENT ACT OF 2021 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, pur-
suant to House Resolution 601, I call up

Rights Act of 1965 to revise the criteria 
for determining which States and polit-
ical subdivisions are subject to section 
4 of the Act, and for other purposes, 
and ask for its immediate consider-
ation. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mrs. 
BEATTY). Pursuant to House Resolution 
601, the amendment printed in House 
Report 117–117 is adopted and the bill, 
as amended, is considered read. 
The text of the bill, as amended, is as 
follows: 
H.R. 4 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘John R. Lewis 
Voting Rights Advancement Act of 2021’’. 
SEC. 2. VOTE DILUTION, DENIAL, AND ABRIDG-
MENT CLAIMS. 
(a) IN GENERAL.—Section 2(a) of the Voting 
Rights Act of 1965 (52 U.S.C. 10301(a)) is amend-
ed— 
(1) by inserting after ‘‘applied by any State or 
political subdivision’’ the following: ‘‘for the 
purpose of, or’’; and 
(2) by striking ‘‘as provided in subsection (b)’’ 
and inserting ‘‘as provided in subsection (b), (c), 
(d), or (f)’’. 
(b) VOTE DILUTION.—Section 2(b) of such Act 
(52 U.S.C. 10301(b)) is amended— 
(1) by inserting after ‘‘A violation of sub-
section (a)’’ the following: ‘‘for vote dilution’’; 
(2) by inserting after the period at the end the 
following: ‘‘For the purposes of this sub-
section:’’; 
(3) by adding at the end the following new 
paragraphs: 
‘‘(1) To prevail, in demonstrating that a rep-
resentational, 
districting, 
or 
apportionment 
scheme results in vote dilution, a plaintiff shall, 
as a threshold matter, establish that— 
‘‘(A) the members of the protected class are 
sufficiently numerous and geographically com-
pact to constitute a majority in a single-member 
district; 
‘‘(B) the members of the protected class are 
politically cohesive; and 
‘‘(C) the residents of that district who are not 
the members of the protected class usually vote 
sufficiently as a bloc to enable them to defeat 
the preferred candidates of the members of the 
protected class. 
‘‘(2) Upon a plaintiff establishing the required 
threshold showing under paragraph (1), a court 
shall conduct a totality of the circumstances 
analysis with respect to a claim of vote dilution 
to determine whether there was a violation of 
subsection (a), which shall include the following 
factors: 
‘‘(A) The extent of any history of official vot-
ing discrimination in the State or political sub-
division that affected the right of members of 
the protected class to register, to vote, or other-
wise to participate in the political process. 
‘‘(B) The extent to which voting in the elec-
tions of the State or political subdivision is ra-
cially polarized. 
‘‘(C) The extent to which the State or political 
subdivision has used voting practices or proce-
dures that tend to enhance the opportunity for 
discrimination against the members of the pro-
tected class, such as unusually large election 
districts, majority vote requirements, anti-single 
shot provisions, or other qualifications, pre-
requisites, standards, practices, or procedures 
that may enhance the opportunity for discrimi-
nation against the members of the protected 
class. 
‘‘(D) If there is a candidate slating process, 
whether the members of the protected class have 
been denied access to that process. 
‘‘(E) The extent to which members of the pro-
tected class in the State or political subdivision 
bear the effects of discrimination both public or 
private, in such areas as education, employ-
ment, health, housing, and transportation, 
which hinder their ability to participate effec-
tively in the political process. 
‘‘(F) Whether political campaigns have been 
characterized by overt or subtle racial appeals. 
‘‘(G) The extent to which members of the pro-
tected class have been elected to public office in 
the jurisdiction. 
‘‘(3) In conducting a totality of the cir-
cumstances analysis under paragraph (2), a 
court may consider such other factors as the 
court may determine to be relevant, including— 
‘‘(A) whether there is a significant lack of re-
sponsiveness on the part of elected officials to 
the particularized needs of the members of the 
protected class, including a lack of concern for 
or responsiveness to the requests and proposals 
of the members of the protected class, except 
that compliance with a court order may not be 
considered evidence of responsiveness on the 
part of the jurisdiction; and 
‘‘(B) whether the policy underlying the State 
or political subdivision’s use of such voting 
qualification, prerequisite to voting, or stand-
ard, practice or procedure is tenuous. 
‘‘In making this determination, a court shall 
consider whether the qualification, prerequisite, 
standard, practice, or procedure in question was 
designed to advance and materially advances a 
valid and substantiated State insterest.’’. 
‘‘(4) A class of citizens protected by subsection 
(a) may include a cohesive coalition of members 
of 
different 
racial 
or 
language 
minority 
groups.’’; and 
(4) VOTE DENIAL OR ABRIDGEMENT.—Section 2 
of such Act (52 U.S.C. 10301), as amended by 
subsections (a) and (b), is further amended by 
adding at the end the following: 
‘‘(c)(1) A violation of subsection (a) resulting 
in vote denial or abridgement is established if 
the 
challenged 
qualification, 
prerequisite, 
standard, practice, or procedure— 
‘‘(A) results or will result in members of a pro-
tected class facing greater costs or burdens in 
participating in the political process than other 
voters; and’’. 
‘‘(B) the greater costs or burdens are, at least 
in part, caused by or linked to social and histor-
ical conditions that have produced or produce

on the date of such challenge discrimination 
against members of the protected class. 
‘‘In determining the existence of a burden for 
purposes of subparagraph (A), the absolute 
number or the percent of voters affected or the 
presence of voters who are not members of a pro-
tected class in the affected area shall not be dis-
positive, and the affected area may be smaller 
than the jurisdiction to which the qualification, 
prerequisite, standard, practice, or procedure 
applies.’’ 
‘‘(2) 
The 
challenged 
qualification, 
pre-
requisite, standard, practice, or procedure need 
only be a but-for cause of the discriminatory re-
sult described in paragraph (1) or perpetuate 
pre-existing burdens or costs. 
‘‘(3)(A) The factors that are relevant to a to-
tality of the circumstances analysis with respect 
to a claim of vote denial or abridgement pursu-
ant to this subsection include the following: 
‘‘(i) The extent of any history of official vot-
ing-related discrimination in the State or polit-
ical subdivision that affected the right of mem-
bers of the protected class to register, to vote, or 
otherwise to participate in the political process. 
‘‘(ii) The extent to which voting in the elec-
tions of the State or political subdivision is ra-
cially polarized. 
‘‘(iii) The extent to which the State or polit-
ical subdivision has used photographic voter 
identification requirements, documentary proof 
of citizenship requirements, documentary proof 
of residence requirements, or other voting prac-
tices or procedures, beyond those required by 
Federal law, that may impair the ability of 
members of the minority group to participate 
fully in the political process. 
‘‘(iv) The extent to which minority group 
members bear the effects of discrimination, both 
public and private, in areas such as education, 
employment, health, housing, and transpor-
tation, which hinder their ability to participate 
effectively in the political process. 
‘‘(v) The use of overt or subtle racial appeals 
either in political campaigns or surrounding 
adoption or maintenance of the challenged 
practice. 
‘‘(vi) The extent to which members of the mi-
nority group have been elected to public office 
in the jurisdiction, provided that the fact that 
the minority group is too small to elect can-
didates of its choice shall not defeat a claim of 
vote denial or abridgment. 
‘‘(vii) Whether there is a lack of responsive-
ness on the part of elected officials to the par-
ticularized needs of minority group members, in-
cluding a lack of concern for or responsiveness 
to the requests and proposals of the group, ex-
cept that compliance with a court order may not 
be considered evidence of responsiveness on the 
part of the jurisdiction. 
‘‘(viii) Whether the policy underlying the 
State or political subdivision’s use of the chal-
lenged qualification, prerequisite, standard, 
practice, or procedure is tenuous. In making a 
determination under this clause, a court shall 
consider whether the qualification, prerequisite, 
standard, practice, or procedure in question was 
designed to advance and materially advances a 
valid and substantiated State interest. 
‘‘(ix) Subject to paragraph (4), such other fac-
tors as the court may determine to be relevant. 
‘‘(B) The factors described in subparagraph 
(A), individually and collectively, shall be con-
sidered as a means of establishing that a voting 
practice amplifies the effects of past or present 
discrimination in violation in subsection (a). 
‘‘(C) A plaintiff need not show any particular 
combination or number of factors to establish a 
violation of subsection (a). 
‘‘(4) The factors that are relevant to a totality 
of the circumstances analysis with respect to a 
claim of vote denial or abridgement do not in-
clude the following: 
‘‘(A) The degree to which the challenged qual-
ification, prerequisite, standard, practice, or 
procedure has a long pedigree or was in wide-
spread use at some earlier date. 
‘‘(B) The use of an identical or similar quali-
fication, prerequisite, standard, practice, or pro-
cedure in other States or jurisdictions. 
‘‘(C) The availability of other forms of voting 
unimpacted by the challenged qualification, 
prerequisite, standard, practice, or procedure to 
all members of the electorate, including members 
of the protected class, unless the jurisdiction is 
simultaneously expanding such other practices 
to eliminate any disproportionate burden im-
posed by the challenged qualification, pre-
requisite, standard, practice, or procedure. 
‘‘(D) Unsubstantiated defenses that the quali-
fication, prerequisite, standard, practice, or pro-
cedure is necessary to address criminal activity. 
‘‘(d)(1) A violation of subsection (a) for the 
purpose of vote denial or abridgement is estab-
lished if the challenged qualification, pre-
requisite, standard, practice, or procedure is in-
tended, at least in part, to dilute minority vot-
ing strength or to deny or abridge the right of 
any citizen of the United States to vote on ac-
count of race, color, or in contravention of the 
guarantees set forth in section 4(f)(2). 
‘‘(2) Discrimination on account of race, color, 
or in contravention of the guarantees set forth 
in section 4(f)(2) need only be one purpose of a 
qualification, prerequisite, standard, practice, 
or procedure to demonstrate a violation of sub-
section (a). 
‘‘(3) A qualification, prerequisite, standard, 
practice, or procedure intended to dilute minor-
ity voting strength or to make it more difficult 
for minority voters to cast a ballot that will be 
counted violates this subsection even if an addi-
tional purpose of the qualification, prerequisite, 
standard, practice, or procedure is to benefit a 
particular political party or group. 
‘‘(4) The context for the adoption of the chal-
lenged qualification, prerequisite, standard, 
practice, or procedure, including actions by offi-
cial decisionmakers before the challenged quali-
fication, prerequisite, standard, practice, or pro-
cedure, may be relevant to a violation of this 
subsection. 
‘‘(5) Claims under this subsection require 
proof of a discriminatory impact but do not re-
quire proof of a violation pursuant to subsection 
(b) or (c).’’. 
‘‘(e) For purposes of this section, the term ‘af-
fected area’ means any geographic area, in 
which members of a protected class are affected 
by a qualification, prerequisite, standard, prac-
tice, or procedure allegedly in violation of this 
section, within a State (including any Indian 
lands).’’. 
SEC. 3. RETROGRESSION. 
Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 (52 
U.S.C. 10301 et seq.), as amended by section 2 of 
this Act, is further amended by adding at the 
end the following: 
‘‘(f) A violation of subsection (a) is established 
when a State or political subdivision enacts or 
seeks to administer any qualification or pre-
requisite to voting or standard, practice, or pro-
cedure with respect to voting in any election 
that has the purpose of or will have the effect 
of diminishing the ability of any citizens of the 
United States on account of race or color, or in 
contravention of the guarantees set forth in sec-
tion 4(f)(2), to participate in the electoral proc-
ess or elect their preferred candidates of choice. 
This subsection applies to any action taken on 
or after January 1, 2021, by a State or political 
subdivision to enact or seek to administer any 
such qualification or prerequisite to voting or 
standard, practice or procedure. 
‘‘(g) Notwithstanding the provisions of sub-
section (f), final decisions of the United States 
District Court of the District of Columbia on ap-
plications or petitions by States or political sub-
divisions for preclearance under section 5 of any 
changes in voting prerequisites, standards, prac-
tices, or procedures, supersede the provisions of 
subsection (f).’’. 
SEC. 4. VIOLATIONS TRIGGERING AUTHORITY OF 
COURT TO RETAIN JURISDICTION. 
(a) TYPES OF VIOLATIONS.—Section 3(c) of the 
Voting Rights Act of 1965 (52 U.S.C. 10302(c)) is 
amended by striking ‘‘violations of the four-
teenth or fifteenth amendment’’ and inserting 
‘‘violations of the 14th or 15th Amendment, vio-
lations of this Act, or violations of any Federal 
law that prohibits discrimination in voting on 
the basis of race, color, or membership in a lan-
guage minority group,’’. 
(b) CONFORMING AMENDMENT.—Section 3(a) of 
such Act (52 U.S.C. 10302(a)) is amended by 
striking ‘‘violations of the fourteenth or fif-
teenth amendment’’ and inserting ‘‘violations of 
the 14th or 15th Amendment, violations of this 
Act, or violations of any Federal law that pro-
hibits discrimination in voting on the basis of 
race, color, or membership in a language minor-
ity group,’’. 
SEC. 5. CRITERIA FOR COVERAGE OF STATES AND 
POLITICAL SUBDIVISIONS. 
(a) DETERMINATION OF STATES AND POLITICAL 
SUBDIVISIONS SUBJECT TO SECTION 4(a).— 
(1) IN GENERAL.—Section 4(b) of the Voting

‘‘(iii) three or more voting rights violations oc-

endar years and the State itself administers the

DIVISIONS.—Subsection (a) applies with respect

lief (that was not reversed on appeal), in which 
the plaintiff prevailed or a court of the United 
States found that the plaintiff demonstrated a 
likelihood of success on the merits or raised a se-

tion, in which any court of the United States 
determined that a denial or abridgement of the 
right of any citizen of the United States to vote 
on account of race, color, or membership in a 
language minority group occurred, or that a 
voting qualification or prerequisite to voting or 
standard, practice, or procedure with respect to

vote in connection with a claim that the law un-
duly burdened voters of a particular race, color, 
or language minority group, in violation of the 
14th or 15th Amendment, anywhere within the 
State or subdivision. 
‘‘(B) JUDICIAL
RELIEF; VIOLATIONS
OF
THIS 
ACT.—Any final judgment, or any preliminary,

prevented a voting qualification or prerequisite 
to voting or standard, practice, or procedure 
with respect to voting from being enforced any-
where within the State or subdivision. A viola-
tion per this subsection has not occurred where 
an objection has been withdrawn by the Attor-
ney General, unless the withdrawal was in re-
sponse to a change in the law or practice that 
served as the basis of the objection. A violation 
under this subsection has not occurred where 
the objection is based solely on a State or polit-
ical subdivision’s failure to comply with a proce-
dural process that would not otherwise con-
stitute an independent violation of this act. 
‘‘(E) CONSENT DECREE, SETTLEMENT, OR OTHER 
AGREEMENT.—A consent decree, settlement, or 
other agreement was adopted or entered by a 
court of the United States or contained an ad-
mission of liability by the defendants, which re-
sulted in the alteration or abandonment of a 
voting practice anywhere in the territory of 
such State or subdivision that was challenged 
on the ground that the practice denied or 
abridged the right of any citizen of the United 
States to vote on account of race, color, or mem-
bership in a language minority group in viola-
tion of subsection 4(e) or 4(f) or section 2, 201, 
or 203 of this Act, or the 14th or 15th Amend-
ment. An extension or modification of an agree-
ment as defined by this subsection that has been 
in place for ten years or longer shall count as 
an independent violation. If a court of the 
United States finds that an agreement itself as 
defined by this subsection denied or abridged 
the right of any citizen of the United States to 
vote on account of race, color, or membership in 
a language minority group, violated subsection 
4(e) or 4(f) or section 2, 201, or 203 of this Act, 
or created an undue burden on the right to vote 
in connection with a claim that the consent de-
cree, settlement, or other agreement unduly bur-
dened voters of a particular race, color, or lan-
guage minority group, that finding shall count 
as an independent violation. 
‘‘(F) MULTIPLE
VIOLATIONS.—Each voting 
qualification or prerequisite to voting or stand-
ard, practice, or procedure with respect to vot-
ing, including each redistricting plan, found to 
be a violation by a court of the United States 
pursuant to subsection (a) or (b), or prevented 
from enforcement pursuant to subsection (c) or 
(d), or altered or abandoned pursuant to sub-
section (e) shall count as an independent viola-
tion. Within a redistricting plan, each violation 
found to discriminate against any group of vot-
ers based on race, color, or language minority 
group shall count as an independent violation.
‘‘(4) TIMING OF DETERMINATIONS.— 
‘‘(A) DETERMINATIONS OF VOTING RIGHTS VIO-
LATIONS.—As early as practicable during each 
calendar year, the Attorney General shall make 
the determinations required by this subsection, 
including updating the list of voting rights vio-
lations occurring in each State and political 
subdivision for the previous calendar year. 
‘‘(B) EFFECTIVE
UPON
PUBLICATION
IN
FED-
ERAL
REGISTER.—A determination or certifi-
cation of the Attorney General under this sec-
tion or under section 8 or 13 shall be effective 
upon publication in the Federal Register.’’. 
(2) CONFORMING
AMENDMENTS.—Section 4(a) 
of such Act (52 U.S.C. 10303(a)) is amended— 
(A) in paragraph (1), in the first sentence of 
the matter preceding subparagraph (A), by 
striking ‘‘any State with respect to which’’ and 
all that follows through ‘‘unless’’ and inserting 
‘‘any State to which this subsection applies dur-
ing a calendar year pursuant to determinations 
made under subsection (b), or in any political 
subdivision of such State (as such subdivision 
existed on the date such determinations were 
made with respect to such State), though such 
determinations were not made with respect to 
such subdivision as a separate unit, or in any 
political subdivision with respect to which this 
subsection applies during a calendar year pur-
suant to determinations made with respect to 
such subdivision as a separate unit under sub-
section (b), unless’’; 
(B) in paragraph (1) in the matter preceding 
subparagraph (A), by striking the second sen-
tence; 
(C) in paragraph (1)(A), by striking ‘‘(in the 
case of a State or subdivision seeking a declara-
tory judgment under the second sentence of this 
subsection)’’; 
(D) in paragraph (1)(B), by striking ‘‘(in the 
case of a State or subdivision seeking a declara-
tory judgment under the second sentence of this 
subsection)’’; 
(E) in paragraph (3), by striking ‘‘(in the case 
of a State or subdivision seeking a declaratory 
judgment under the second sentence of this sub-
section)’’; 
(F) in paragraph (5), by striking ‘‘(in the case 
of a State or subdivision which sought a declar-
atory judgment under the second sentence of 
this subsection)’’; 
(G) by striking paragraphs (7) and (8); and 
(H) by redesignating paragraph (9) as para-
graph (7). 
(b) CLARIFICATION
OF TREATMENT
OF MEM-
BERS OF LANGUAGE MINORITY GROUPS.—Section 
4(a)(1) of such Act (52 U.S.C. 10303(a)(1)) is 
amended by striking ‘‘race or color,’’ and insert-
ing ‘‘race, color, or in contravention of the 
guarantees of subsection (f)(2),’’.

(1) IN
GENERAL.—Section 4 of the Voting 
Rights Act of 1965 (52 U.S.C. 10303) is amended 
by adding at the end the following: 
‘‘(g) ADMINISTRATIVE BAILOUT.— 
‘‘(1) DETERMINATION OF ELIGIBILITY.— 
‘‘(A) IN GENERAL.—After making a determina-
tion under subsection (b)(1)(A) that the provi-
sions of subsection (a) apply with respect to a 
State and all political subdivisions within the 
State, the Attorney General shall determine if 
any political subdivision of the State is eligible 
for an exemption under this subsection, and 
shall publish, in the Federal Register, a list of 
all such political subdivisions. Any political 
subdivision included on such list is not subject 
to any requirement under section 5 until the 
date on which any application under this sec-
tion has been finally disposed of or no such ap-
plication may be made. 
‘‘(B) RULE OF CONSTRUCTION.—Nothing in this 
subsection may be construed to provide— 
‘‘(i) that the determinations made pursuant to 
the creation of the list shall have any binding or 
preclusive effect; or 
‘‘(ii) that inclusion on the list— 
‘‘(I) constitutes a final determination by the 
Attorney General that the listee is eligible for an 
exemption pursuant to this subsection or that, 
in the case of the listee, the provisions of sub-
paragraphs (A) through (F) of subsection (a)(1) 
are satisfied; or 
‘‘(II) entitles the listee to any exemption pur-
suant to this subsection. 
‘‘(2) ELIGIBILITY.—A political subdivision that 
submits an application under paragraph (3) 
shall be eligible for an exemption under this 
subsection only if, during the ten years pre-
ceding the filing of the application, and during

division for the purpose or with the effect of de-
nying or abridging the right to vote on account 
of race or color or in contravention of the guar-
antees of subsection (f)(2); 
‘‘(B) no final judgment of any court of the 
United States, other than the denial of declara-
tory judgment under this section, has deter-
mined that denials or abridgements of the right 
to vote on account of race or color have oc-
curred anywhere in the territory of such polit-
ical subdivision or that denials or abridgements 
of the right to vote in contravention of the guar-
antees of subsection (f)(2) have occurred any-
where in the territory of such subdivision and 
no consent decree, settlement, or agreement has 
been entered into resulting in any abandonment 
of a voting practice challenged on such grounds; 
and no declaratory judgment under this section 
shall be entered during the pendency of an ac-
tion commenced before the filing of an action 
under this section and alleging such denials or 
abridgements of the right to vote; 
‘‘(C) no Federal examiners or observers under 
this Act have been assigned to such political 
subdivision; 
‘‘(D) such political subdivision and all govern-
mental units within its territory have complied 
with section 5 of this Act, including compliance 
with the requirement that no change covered by 
section 
5 
has 
been 
enforced 
without 
preclearance under section 5, and have repealed 
all changes covered by section 5 to which the 
Attorney General has successfully objected or as 
to which the United States District Court for the 
District of Columbia has denied a declaratory 
judgment; 
‘‘(E) the Attorney General has not interposed 
any objection (that has not been overturned by 
a final judgment of a court) and no declaratory 
judgment has been denied under section 5, with 
respect to any submission by or on behalf of the 
plaintiff or any governmental unit within its 
territory under section 5, and no such submis-
sions or declaratory judgment actions are pend-
ing; and

mental units within its territory—

forts, such as expanded opportunity for conven-
ient registration and voting for every person of

sons as election officials throughout the juris-
diction and at all stages of the election and reg-
istration process. 
‘‘(3) APPLICATION PERIOD.—Not later than 90 
days after the publication of the list under 
paragraph (1), a political subdivision included 
on such list may submit an application, con-
taining such information as the Attorney Gen-
eral may require, for an exemption under this 
subsection. The Attorney General shall provide 
notice in the Federal Register of such applica-
tion. 
‘‘(4) COMMENT
PERIOD.—During the 90-day 
period beginning on the date that notice is pub-
lished under paragraph (3), the Attorney Gen-
eral shall give interested persons an opportunity 
to submit objections to the issuance of an ex-
emption under this subsection to a political sub-
division on the basis that the political subdivi-
sion is not eligible under paragraph (2) to the 
Attorney General. During the 1 year period be-
ginning on the effective date of this subsection, 
such 90-day period shall be extended by an ad-
ditional 30 days. The Attorney General shall no-
tify the political subdivision of each objection 
submitted and afford the political subdivision 
an opportunity to respond. 
‘‘(5) DETERMINATION
AS
TO
OBJECTIONS.—In 
the case of a political subdivision with respect to 
which an objection has been submitted under 
paragraph (4), the following shall apply: 
‘‘(A) CONSIDERATION OF OBJECTIONS.—The At-
torney General shall consider and respond to 
each such objection (and any response of the 
political subdivision thereto) during the 60 day 
period beginning on the day after the comment 
period under paragraph (4) concludes. 
‘‘(B) JUSTIFIED OBJECTIONS.—If the Attorney 
General determines that any such objection is 
justified, the Attorney General shall publish no-
tice in the Federal Register denying the applica-
tion for an exemption under this subsection. 
‘‘(C) UNJUSTIFIED OBJECTIONS.—If the Attor-
ney General determines that no objection sub-
mitted is justified, each person that submitted

the District of Columbia, an action for judicial 
review of such determination in accordance with

‘‘(6) EXEMPTION.—The Attorney General may 
issue an exemption, by publication in the Fed-
eral Register, from the application of the provi-
sions of subsection (a) with respect to a political

was submitted under paragraph (4) or deter-
mined to be justified under paragraph (5). 
‘‘(7) JUDICIAL
REVIEW.—Except as otherwise 
explicitly provided in this subsection, no deter-
mination under this subsection shall be subject 
to review by any court, and all determinations 
under this subsection are committed to the dis-
cretion of the Attorney General. 
‘‘(8) SAVINGS CLAUSE.—If a political subdivi-
sion was not subject to the application of the 
provisions of subsection (a) by reason of a de-
claratory judgment entered prior to the effective 
date of this subsection, and such political sub-
division has not violated any eligibility require-
ment set forth in paragraph (2) at any time 
thereafter, then that political subdivision shall 
not be subject to the requirements of subsection 
(a).’’. 
(2) CONFORMING AMENDMENT.—

torney General issues an exemption under sub-
section (g)’’.

qualification or prerequisite to voting, or a 
standard, practice, or procedure with respect to 
voting, that is a covered practice described in 
subsection (b); and 
‘‘(B) ensure that no such covered practice is 
implemented unless or until the State or political 
subdivision, as the case may be, complies with 
subsection (c). 
‘‘(2) DETERMINATIONS OF CHARACTERISTICS OF 
VOTING-AGE POPULATION.— 
‘‘(A) IN
GENERAL.—As early as practicable 
during each calendar year, the Attorney Gen-
eral, in consultation with the Director of the

garding voting-age populations and the charac-
teristics of such populations, and shall publish

which a voting-age population characteristic de-
scribed in subsection (b) applies. 
‘‘(B) PUBLICATION

ards, practices, or procedures with respect to 
voting newly adopted in a State or political sub-
division, the following shall be covered practices

resents 20 percent or more of the voting-age pop-
ulation on Indian lands located in whole or in 
part in the political subdivision; or

a single-member district to one or more at-large 
seats or seats from a multi-member district in a

lation; or

ulation on Indian lands located in whole or in 
part in the political subdivision.

a State or political subdivision where any racial 
group or language minority group that is not 
the largest racial group or language minority 
group in the jurisdiction and that represents 15 
percent or more of the State or political subdivi-
sion’s voting-age population experiences a popu-
lation increase of at least 20 percent of its vot-
ing-age population, over the preceding decade 
(as calculated by the Bureau of the Census 
under the most recent decennial census), in the 
jurisdiction. 
‘‘(4) CHANGES IN DOCUMENTATION OR QUALI-
FICATIONS
TO
VOTE.—Any change to require-
ments for documentation or proof of identity to

vancement Act of 2021; and further, if a State 
has in effect a requirement that an individual 
present identification as a condition of receiving

penalty of perjury, attesting to the individual’s

‘‘(7) NEW
LIST
MAINTENANCE
PROCESS.—Any 
change to the maintenance of voter registration 
lists that adds a new basis for removal from the 
list of active registered voters or that incor-
porates new sources of information in deter-
mining a voter’s eligibility to vote, wherein such 
a change would have a statistically significant 
disparate impact on the removal from voter rolls 
of members of racial groups or language minor-
ity groups that constitute greater than 5 percent 
of the voting-age population— 
‘‘(A) in the case of a political subdivision im-
posing such change if— 
‘‘(i) two or more racial groups or language mi-
nority groups each represent 20 percent or more 
of the voting-age population of the political sub-
division; or 
‘‘(ii) a single language minority group rep-
resents 20 percent or more of the voting-age pop-
ulation on Indian lands located in whole or in 
part in the political subdivision; or 
‘‘(B) in the case of a State imposing such 
change, if two or more racial groups or lan-
guage minority groups each represent 20 percent 
or more of the voting-age population of— 
‘‘(i) the State; or 
‘‘(ii) a political subdivision in the State, ex-
cept that the requirements under subsections (a) 
and (c) shall apply only with respect to each 
such political subdivision. 
‘‘(c) PRECLEARANCE.— 
‘‘(1) IN GENERAL.—Whenever a State or polit-
ical subdivision with respect to which the re-
quirements set forth in subsection (a) are in ef-
fect shall enact, adopt, or seek to implement any 
covered practice described under subsection (b), 
such State or subdivision may institute an ac-
tion in the United States District Court for the 
District of Columbia for a declaratory judgment 
that such covered practice neither has the pur-
pose nor will have the effect of denying or 
abridging the right to vote on account of race, 
color, or membership in a language minority 
group, and unless and until the court enters 
such judgment such covered practice shall not 
be implemented. Notwithstanding the previous 
sentence, such covered practice may be imple-
mented without such proceeding if the covered 
practice has been submitted by the chief legal 
officer or other appropriate official of such 
State or subdivision to the Attorney General and 
the Attorney General has not interposed an ob-
jection within 60 days after such submission, or 
upon good cause shown, to facilitate an expe-
dited approval within 60 days after such submis-
sion, the Attorney General has affirmatively in-
dicated that such objection will not be made. 
Neither an affirmative indication by the Attor-
ney General that no objection will be made, nor 
the Attorney General’s failure to object, nor a 
declaratory judgment entered under this section 
shall bar a subsequent action to enjoin imple-
mentation of such covered practice. In the event 
the Attorney General affirmatively indicates 
that no objection will be made within the 60-day 
period following receipt of a submission, the At-
torney General may reserve the right to reexam-
ine the submission if additional information 
comes to the Attorney General’s attention dur-
ing the remainder of the 60-day period which 
would otherwise require objection in accordance 
with this section. Any action under this section 
shall be heard and determined by a court of 
three judges in accordance with the provisions 
of section 2284 of title 28, United States Code, 
and any appeal shall lie to the Supreme Court. 
‘‘(2) DENYING
OR
ABRIDGING
THE
RIGHT
TO 
VOTE.—Any covered practice described in sub-
section (b) that has the purpose of or will have 
the effect of diminishing the ability of any citi-
zens of the United States on account of race, 
color, or membership in a language minority 
group, to elect their preferred candidates of 
choice denies or abridges the right to vote with-
in the meaning of paragraph (1) of this sub-
section. 
‘‘(3) PURPOSE DEFINED.—The term ‘purpose’ in 
paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subsection shall 
include any discriminatory purpose. 
‘‘(4) PURPOSE OF PARAGRAPH (2).—The purpose 
of paragraph (2) of this subsection is to protect 
the ability of such citizens to elect their pre-
ferred candidates of choice. 
‘‘(d) ENFORCEMENT.—The Attorney General or 
any aggrieved citizen may file an action in a 
Federal district court to compel any State or po-
litical subdivision to satisfy the obligations set 
forth in this section. Such actions shall be heard 
and determined by a court of three judges under 
section 2284 of title 28, United States Code. In 
any such action, the court shall provide as a 
remedy that any voting qualification or pre-
requisite to voting, or standard, practice, or pro-
cedure with respect to voting, that is the subject 
of the action under this subsection be enjoined 
unless the court determines that— 
‘‘(1) the voting qualification or prerequisite to 
voting, or standard, practice, or procedure with 
respect to voting, is not a covered practice de-
scribed in subsection (b); or 
‘‘(2) the State or political subdivision has com-
plied with subsection (c) with respect to the cov-
ered practice at issue. 
‘‘(e) COUNTING OF RACIAL GROUPS AND LAN-
GUAGE MINORITY GROUPS.—For purposes of this 
section, the calculation of the population of a 
racial group or a language minority group shall 
be carried out using the methodology in the 
guidance promulgated in the Federal Register 
on February 9, 2011 (76 Fed. Reg. 7470). 
‘‘(f) SPECIAL RULE.—For purposes of deter-
minations under this section, any data provided 
by the Bureau of the Census, whether based on 
estimation from sample or actual enumeration, 
shall not be subject to challenge or review in 
any court. 
‘‘(g) MULTILINGUAL VOTING MATERIALS.—In 
this section, the term ‘multilingual voting mate-
rials’ means registration or voting notices, 
forms, instructions, assistance, or other mate-
rials or information relating to the electoral 
process, including ballots, provided in the lan-
guage or languages of one or more language mi-
nority groups.’’. 
SEC. 7. PROMOTING TRANSPARENCY TO EN-
FORCE THE VOTING RIGHTS ACT. 
(a) TRANSPARENCY.— 
(1) IN
GENERAL.—The Voting Rights Act of 
1965 (52 U.S.C. 10301 et seq.) is amended by in-
serting after section 5 the following new section: 
‘‘SEC. 6. TRANSPARENCY REGARDING CHANGES 
TO PROTECT VOTING RIGHTS. 
‘‘(a) NOTICE OF ENACTED CHANGES.— 
‘‘(1) NOTICE OF CHANGES.—If a State or polit-
ical subdivision makes any change in any quali-
fication or prerequisite to voting or standard, 
practice, or procedure with respect to voting in 
any election for Federal office that will result in 
the qualification or prerequisite, standard, prac-
tice, or procedure being different from that 
which was in effect as of 180 days before the

the relief if the court determines that the com-
plainant has raised a serious question as to 
whether the challenged voting qualification or 
prerequisite to voting or standard, practice, or 
procedure violates this Act or the Constitution 
and, on balance, the hardship imposed on the 
defendant by the grant of the relief will be less 
than the hardship which would be imposed on 
the plaintiff if the relief were not granted. 
‘‘(B) In making its determination under this 
paragraph with respect to a change in any vot-
ing qualification, prerequisite to voting, or 
standard, practice, or procedure with respect to

color in violation of the 14th or 15th Amend-
ment; 
‘‘(II) a violation of the 19th, 24th, or 26th

redistricting plans, standing alone, shall not be 
deemed to constitute irreparable harm to the 
public interest or to the interests of a defendant 
in an action arising under the Constitution or 
any Federal law that prohibits discrimination 
on the basis of race, color, or membership in a 
language minority group in the voting process, 
for the purposes of determining whether a stay 
of a court’s order or an interlocutory appeal 
under section 1253 of title 28, United States 
Code, is warranted.’’. 
SEC. 11. RELIEF FOR VIOLATIONS OF VOTING 
RIGHTS LAWS. 
(a) IN GENERAL.— 
(1) RELIEF FOR VIOLATIONS OF VOTING RIGHTS 
LAWS.—In this section, the term ‘‘prohibited act 
or practice’’ means— 
(A) any act or practice— 
(i) that creates an undue burden on the fun-
damental right to vote in violation of the 14th 
Amendment to the Constitution of the United 
States or violates the Equal Protection Clause of 
the 14th Amendment to the Constitution of the 
United States; or 
(ii) that is prohibited by the 15th, 19th, 24th, 
or 26th Amendment to the Constitution of the 
United States, section 2004 of the Revised Stat-
utes (52 U.S.C. 10101), the Voting Rights Act of 
1965 (52 U.S.C. 10301 et seq.), the National Voter 
Registration Act of 1993 (52 U.S.C. 20501 et seq.), 
the Uniformed and Overseas Citizens Absentee 
Voting Act (52 U.S.C. 20301 et seq.), the Help 
America Vote Act of 2002 (52 U.S.C. 20901 et 
seq.), the Voting Accessibility for the Elderly 
and Handicapped Act (52 U.S.C. 20101 et seq.), 
or section 2003 of the Revised Statutes (52 U.S.C. 
10102); and 
(B) any act or practice in violation of any 
Federal law that prohibits discrimination with 
respect to voting, including the Americans with 
Disabilities Act of 1990 (42 U.S.C. 12101 et seq.). 
(2) RULE OF CONSTRUCTION.—Nothing in this 
section shall be construed to diminish the au-
thority or scope of authority of any person to 
bring an action under any Federal law. 
(3) ATTORNEY’S
FEES.—Section 722(b) of the 
Revised Statutes (42 U.S.C. 1988(b)) is amended 
by inserting ‘‘a provision described in section 
2(a) of the John R. Lewis Voting Rights Ad-
vancement Act of 2021,’’ after ‘‘title VI of the 
Civil Rights Act of 1964,’’. 
(b) GROUNDS FOR EQUITABLE RELIEF.—In any 
action for equitable relief pursuant to a law list-
ed under subsection (a), proximity of the action 
to an election shall not be a valid reason to 
deny such relief, or stay the operation of or va-
cate the issuance of such relief, unless the party 
opposing the issuance or continued operation of 
relief meets the burden of proving by clear and 
convincing evidence that the issuance of the re-
lief would be so close in time to the election as 
to cause irreparable harm to the public interest 
or that compliance with such relief would im-
pose serious burdens on the party opposing re-
lief. 
(1) IN
GENERAL.—In considering whether to 
grant, deny, stay, or vacate any order of equi-
table relief, the court shall give substantial 
weight to the public’s interest in expanding ac-
cess to the right to vote. A State’s generalized 
interest in enforcing its enacted laws shall not 
be a relevant consideration in determining 
whether equitable relief is warranted. 
(2) PRESUMPTIVE SAFE HARBOR.—Where equi-
table relief is sought either within 30 days of the 
adoption or reasonable public notice of the chal-
lenged policy or practice, or more than 45 days 
before the date of an election to which the relief 
being sought will apply, proximity to the elec-
tion will be presumed not to constitute a harm 
to the public interest or a burden on the party 
opposing relief. 
(c) GROUNDS FOR STAY OR VACATUR IN FED-
ERAL CLAIMS INVOLVING VOTING RIGHTS.— 
(1) PROSPECTIVE EFFECT.—In reviewing an ap-
plication for a stay or vacatur of equitable relief 
granted pursuant to a law listed in subsection 
(a), a court shall give substantial weight to the 
reliance interests of citizens who acted pursuant 
to such order under review. In fashioning a stay 
or vacatur, a reviewing court shall not order re-
lief that has the effect of denying or abridging 
the right to vote of any citizen who has acted in 
reliance on the order. 
(2) 
WRITTEN
EXPLANATION.—No 
stay 
or 
vacatur under this subsection shall issue unless 
the reviewing court makes specific findings that 
the public interest, including the public’s inter-
est in expanding access to the ballot, will be 
harmed by the continuing operation of the equi-
table relief or that compliance with such relief 
will impose serious burdens on the party seeking 
such a stay or vacatur such that those burdens 
substantially outweigh the benefits to the public 
interest. In reviewing an application for a stay 
or vacatur of equitable relief, findings of fact 
made in issuing the order under review shall not 
be set aside unless clearly erroneous. 
SEC. 12. ENFORCEMENT OF VOTING RIGHTS BY 
ATTORNEY GENERAL. 
Section 12 of the Voting Rights Act (52 U.S.C. 
10308), as amended by this Act, is further 
amended by adding at the end the following: 
‘‘(g) VOTING RIGHTS ENFORCEMENT BY ATTOR-
NEY GENERAL.— 
‘‘(1) IN GENERAL.—In order to fulfill the Attor-
ney General’s responsibility to enforce the Vot-
ing Rights Act and other Federal civil rights 
statutes that protect the right to vote, the Attor-
ney General (or upon designation by the Attor-
ney General, the Assistant Attorney General for 
Civil Rights) is authorized, before commencing a 
civil action, to issue a demand for inspection 
and information in writing to any State or polit-
ical subdivision, or other governmental rep-
resentative or agent, with respect to any rel-
evant documentary material that he has reason 
to believe is within their possession, custody, or 
control. A demand by the Attorney General 
under this section may require— 
‘‘(A) the production of such documentary ma-
terial for inspection and copying; 
‘‘(B) answers in writing to written questions 
with respect to such documentary material; or 
‘‘(C) both. 
‘‘(2) CONTENTS OF AN ATTORNEY GENERAL DE-
MAND.— 
‘‘(A) IN GENERAL.—Any demand issued under 
paragraph (1), shall include a sworn certificate 
to identify the voting qualification or pre-
requisite to voting or standard, practice, or pro-
cedure with respect to voting, or other voting re-
lated matter or issue, whose lawfulness the At-
torney General is investigating and to identify 
the civil provisions of the Federal civil rights 
statute that protects the right to vote under 
which the investigation is being conducted. The 
demand shall be reasonably calculated to lead 
to the discovery of documentary material and 
information relevant to such civil rights inves-
tigation. Documentary material includes any 
material upon which relevant information is re-
corded, and includes written or printed mate-
rials, photographs, tapes, or materials upon 
which information is electronically or magneti-
cally recorded. Such demands are aimed at the 
Attorney General having the ability to inspect 
and obtain copies of relevant materials (as well 
as obtain information) related to voting and are 
not aimed at the Attorney General taking pos-
session of original records, particularly those 
that are required to be retained by State and 
local election officials under Federal or State 
law. 
‘‘(B) NO REQUIREMENT FOR PRODUCTION.—Any 
demand issued under paragraph (1) may not re-
quire the production of any documentary mate-
rial or the submission of any answers in writing 
to written questions if such material or answers 
would be protected from disclosure under the 
standards applicable to discovery requests under 
the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure in an ac-
tion in which the Attorney General or the 
United States is a party. 
‘‘(C) DOCUMENTARY
MATERIAL.—If the de-
mand issued under paragraph (1) requires the 
production of documentary material, it shall— 
‘‘(i) identify the class of documentary material 
to be produced with such definiteness and cer-
tainty as to permit such material to be fairly 
identified; and 
‘‘(ii) prescribe a return date for production of 
the documentary material at least twenty days 
after issuance of the demand to give the State or 
political subdivision, or other governmental rep-
resentative or agent, a reasonable period of time 
for assembling the documentary material and 
making it available for inspection and copying. 
‘‘(D) ANSWERS TO WRITTEN QUESTIONS.—If the 
demand issued under paragraph (1) requires an-
swers in writing to written questions, it shall— 
‘‘(i) set forth with specificity the written ques-
tion to be answered; and 
‘‘(ii) prescribe a date at least twenty days 
after the issuance of the demand for submitting 
answers in writing to the written questions. 
‘‘(E) SERVICE.—A demand issued under para-
graph (1) may be served by a United States mar-
shal or a deputy marshal, or by certified mail, at 
any place within the territorial jurisdiction of 
any court of the United States. 
‘‘(3) RESPONSES TO AN ATTORNEY GENERAL DE-
MAND.—A State or political subdivision, or other 
governmental representative or agent, must, 
with respect to any documentary material or 
any answer in writing produced under this sub-
section, provide a sworn certificate, in such 
form as the demand issued under paragraph (1) 
designates, by a person having knowledge of the 
facts and circumstances relating to such produc-
tion or written answer, authorized to act on be-
half of the State or political subdivision, or 
other governmental representative or agent, 
upon which the demand was served. The certifi-
cate— 
‘‘(A) shall state that— 
‘‘(i) all of the documentary material required 
by the demand and in the possession, custody,

GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days in which to 
revise and extend their remarks and in-
sert extraneous material on H.R. 4. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from New York? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself 2 minutes. 
Madam Speaker, H.R. 4, the John R. 
Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act 
of 2021, would revitalize and strengthen 
the Voting Rights Act of 1965 to con-
front the onslaught of discriminatory 
voting laws and practices that have 
emerged in recent years across the 
country. 
In 2013, the Supreme Court, in Shelby 
County v. Holder, gutted the Voting 
Rights Act’s most important enforce-
ment 
mechanism, 
the 
Section 
5 
preclearance regime, which required 
jurisdictions with a history of discrimi-
nation against racial and ethnic minor-
ity voters to seek approval of any 
changes to their voting laws before 
they could go into effect. 
Almost immediately after the deci-
sion, many of these jurisdictions un-
leashed a raft of voter suppression 
measures, knowing that these laws now 
could only be challenged after the fact 
and only through a costly and time- 
consuming process that made such 
challenges unlikely and when people’s 
votes had already been improperly in-
validated. 
When the Court struck down the cov-
erage formula that determined which 
jurisdictions 
were 
subject 
to 
preclearance, it explicitly invited Con-
gress to devise a new formula to meet 
the current need to remedy voting dis-
crimination. 
H.R. 4 answers that call. 
This legislation would create a new 
geographic coverage formula that is 
fine-tuned to capture only those places 
with longstanding and persistent dis-
crimination. At the same time, it tar-
gets only recent discrimination and 
does not leave jurisdictions frozen in 
time. 
The bill also requires preclearance of 
certain practices that are historically 
associated with voting discrimination; 
it responds to the recent Supreme 
Court decision in Brnovich v. DNC, 
which severely limited enforcement of 
Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act; and 
it provides other important tools to 
strengthen enforcement of the VRA. 
H.R. 4 rests on a substantial record 
that documents the myriad ways that

the right to vote, the most funda-
mental right in a democracy, remains 
under threat for too many Americans. 
I want to thank TERRI SEWELL for in-
troducing this bill, STEVE COHEN for 
the 13 hearings he held on voting rights 
in the Constitution Subcommittee, as 
well as our colleagues on the Sub-
committee on Elections and the Com-
mittee on House Administration for 
their work. 
I urge all Members to join me in hon-
oring the legacy of our beloved col-
league, the late John Lewis, who shed 
his blood to secure passage of the Vot-
ing Rights Act, by supporting this vital 
legislation. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from 
Illinois (Mr. RODNEY DAVIS), the rank-
ing member of the House Administra-
tion Committee. 
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
recently, 
another 
friend of ours and our colleague, Con-
gressman BURGESS OWENS, who grew up 
in the Jim Crow South, testified before 
my committee, and I want to highlight 
two very important points he made: 
Not only is our country not facing a 
new era of Jim Crow voting laws, as 
many of my Democrat colleagues have 
falsely claimed, but it is incredibly of-
fensive to lie to the American people to 
further a political agenda. 
Our country has come a long way 
since the Jim Crow era, and it is in 
part because of the Voting Rights Act 
of 1965. 
More Americans voted in the last two 
elections than in any midterm or Pres-
idential election in our Nation’s his-
tory. This includes historic turnouts 
among African Americans and other 
minority voters. 
We should celebrate this progress, 
not ignore it. 
Using Georgia as an example, since 
my friends on the other side of the 
aisle were so quick to condemn new 
election integrity laws in this State; in 
Georgia, which was once covered under 
the VRA’s preclearance formula, Afri-
can-American turnout in the last elec-
tion was 64 percent, compared to 27 
percent in 1965. And an amazing 95 per-
cent of the total eligible voting-age 
population in Georgia is registered to 
vote. 
That is incredible. It is easier to vote 
in Georgia than it is in Democrat-run 
States like New York and Delaware 
and even others. 
Democrats on the Committee on 
House Administration held hearing 
after hearing on election issues where 
they produced zero evidence of voter 
suppression, likely due to the fact that 
voter discrimination and suppression 
remain against the law in this country. 
Yet, the bill before us goes far be-
yond the original VRA and would sub-
ject every State to preclearance, an ex-
traordinary measure established in 1965 
to prevent Democratic-led Southern 
States, with a history of discrimina-
tion, from intimidating and preventing 
African Americans from voting. 
If you vote for this legislation, you 
are voting for a Federal takeover of 
elections; you are removing the people 
elected at the State and local level to 
run elections from making decisions 
about how elections are run, including 
voter ID laws, and putting an unac-
countable, unelected election czar at 
the DOJ, the Attorney General, in 
charge of all election decisions in this 
country. 
Members of this body and the Amer-
ican people should be asking the simple 
question: If it is easier to vote today 
than at any time in our history and 
more Americans are voting than ever 
before, then why are Democrats going 
to such extreme measures to ensure a 
Federal takeover of elections? 
I hope my colleagues and the Amer-
ican people will see this bill for what it 
is, a partisan power grab which cir-
cumvents the people to ensure a one- 
party rule. 
I urge a ‘‘no’’ vote on the underlying 
legislation. 
Madam Speaker, I include in the 
RECORD a report I released as ranking 
member of the House Administration 
Committee earlier this month titled 
‘‘The Elections Clause: States’ Primary 
Constitutional Authority Over Elec-
tions.’’ 
[From Representative Rodney Davis (IL–13), 
Ranking Member, House of Representa-
tives, Committee on House Administra-
tion, Aug. 12, 2021] 
REPORT—THE
ELECTIONS
CLAUSE: STATES’ 
PRIMARY CONSTITUTIONAL AUTHORITY OVER 
ELECTIONS 
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
Republicans believe that every eligible 
voter who wants to vote must be able to do 
so, and all lawful votes must be counted ac-
cording to state law. Through an examina-
tion of history, precedent, the Framers’ 
words, debates concerning ratification, the 
Supreme Court, and the Constitution itself, 
this document explains the constitutional di-
vision of power envisioned by the Framers 
between the States and the federal govern-
ment with respect to election administra-
tion. Article 1, Section 4 of the Constitution 
explains that the States have the primary 
authority over election administration, the 
‘‘times, places, and manner of holding elec-
tions’’. Conversely, the Constitution grants 
the Congress a purely secondary role to alter 
or create election laws only in the extreme 
cases of invasion, legislative neglect, or ob-
stinate refusal to pass election laws. As do 
other aspects of our federal system, this divi-
sion of sovereignty continues to serve to pro-
tect one of Americans’ most precious free-
doms, the right to vote. 
The Constitution reserves to the States 
the primary authority to set election legisla-
tion and administer elections—the ‘‘times, 
places, and manner of holding of elections’’— 
and Congress’ power in this space is purely 
secondary to the States’ power. Congress’ 
power is to be employed only in the direst of 
circumstances. Despite Democrats’ insist-
ence that Congress’ power over elections is 
unfettered and permits Congress to enact 
sweeping legislation like H.R. 1, it is simply 
not true. History, precedent, the Framers’ 
words, debates concerning ratification, the 
Supreme Court, and the Constitution itself 
make this exceedingly clear. 
The Framing Generation grappled with the 
failure of the Articles of Confederation, 
which provided for only a weak national gov-
ernment incapable of preserving the Union. 
Under the Articles, the States had exclusive 
authority over federal elections held within 
their territory; but, given the difficulties the 
national government had experienced with 
State cooperation (e.g., the failure of Rhode 
Island to send delegates to the Confederation 
Congress), the Federalists, including Alex-
ander Hamilton, were concerned with the 
possibility that the States, in an effort to de-
stroy the federal government, simply might 
not hold elections or that an emergency, 
such as an invasion or insurrection, might 
prevent the operation of a State’s govern-
ment, leaving the Congress without Members 
and the federal government unable to re-
spond. Indeed, as counsel for the Democrat 
Members of our Committee so keenly ob-
served: 
For the Founders, particularly during the 
Federal Constitutional Convention, the pri-
mary concern was informing the discussions 
of federal elections in Article I was the risk 
of uncooperative states. For example, Alex-
ander Hamilton noted that by providing 
states the authority to run congressional 
elections, 
under 
Article 
I, 
Section 
4, 
‘‘risk[ed] ‘leaving the existence of the Union 
entirely at their mercy.’ ’’ Following the 
failings of the Articles of Confederation, the 
Founders looked for processes that would in-
sulate Congress from recalcitrant states. In-
deed, ‘‘[t]he dominant purpose of the Elec-
tions Clause, the historical record bears out, 
was to empower Congress to override state 
election rules, not to restrict the way States 
enact legislation[,]’’ and that ‘‘the Clause 
‘was the Framers’ insurance against the pos-
sibility that a State would refuse to provide 
for the election of representatives to the 
Federal Congress.’ ’’ 
Quite plainly, Alexander Hamilton, a lead-
ing Federalist and proponent of our Con-
stitution, understood the Elections Clause as 
serving only as a sort of emergency fail-safe, 
not as a cudgel used to nationalize our elec-
tions process. Writing as Publius to the peo-
ple of New York, Hamilton further expounds 
on the correct understanding of the Elec-
tions Clause: ‘‘T[he] natural order of the sub-
ject leads us to consider, in this place, that 
provision of the Constitution which author-
izes the national legislature to regulate, in 
the last resort, the election of its own mem-
bers.’’ 
When questioned at the States’ constitu-
tional ratifying conventions with respect to 
this provision, the Federalists confirmed this 
understanding of a constitutionally limited, 
secondary congressional power under Article 
1, Section 4: 
Maryland: ‘‘[C]onvention delegate James 
McHenry added that the risk to the federal 
government [without a fail-safe provision] 
might not arise from state malice: An insur-
rection or rebellion might prevent a state 
legislature from administering an election.’’ 
N. Carolina: ‘‘An occasion may arise when 
the exercise of this ultimate power of Con-
gress may be necessary . . . if a state should 
be involved in war, and its legislature could 
not assemble, (as was the case of South Caro-
lina and occasionally of some other states, 
during the [Revolutionary] war).’’ 
Pennsylvania: ‘‘Sir, let it be remembered 
that this power can only operate in a case of 
necessity, after the factious or listless dis-
position of a particular state has rendered an 
interference essential to the salvation of the 
general government.’’ 
John Jay made similar claims in New 
York. And, as constitutional scholar Robert 
Natelson, notes in his invaluable article, The 
Original Scope of the Congressional Power to

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4393 
August 24, 2021 
Regulate Elections, Alexander Contee Han-
son, a member of Congress whose pamphlet 
supporting the Constitution proved popular, 
stated flatly that Congress would exercise its 
times, places, and manner authority only in 
cases of invasion, legislative neglect or ob-
stinate refusal to pass election laws [pro-
viding for the election of Members of Con-
gress], or if a state crafted its election laws 
with a ‘sinister purpose’ or to injure the gen-
eral government.’’ 
Cementing his point, Hanson goes further 
to decree, ‘‘The exercise of this power must 
at all times be so very invidious, that con-
gress will not venture upon it without some 
very cogent and substantial reason.’’ In 
Floor debate during the 117th Congress con-
cerning H.R. 1, the Democrats’ intended na-
tionalization of elections, Ranking Member 
Davis argued, as he has many other times, 
that: 
According to Article 1, Section 4 of the 
Constitution, States have the primary role 
in establishing ‘‘[t]he Times, Places and 
Manner of holding Elections for Senators 
and Representatives.’’ Under the Constitu-
tion, Congress has a purely secondary role in 
this space and must restrain itself from act-
ing improperly and unconstitutionally. Fed-
eral election legislation should never be the 
first step and must never impose burden-
some, unfunded federal mandates on state 
and local elections officials. When Congress 
does speak, it must devote its efforts only to 
resolving highly significant and substantial 
deficiencies. State legislatures are the pri-
mary venues to correct most issues. 
In fact, had the Democrats’ view of the 
Elections Clause been accepted at the time 
of the Constitution’s drafting—that is, that 
it offers Congress unfettered power over fed-
eral elections—it is likely that the Constitu-
tion would not have been ratified or that an 
amendment to this language would have 
been required. Indeed, at least seven of the 
original 13 states—over half and enough to 
prevent the Constitution from being rati-
fied—expressed specific concerns with the 
language of the Elections Clause. However, 
‘‘[l]eading Federalists . . .’’ assured them, 
‘‘. . . that, even without amendment, the 
[Elections] Clause should be construed as 
limited to emergencies.’’ 
Three states, New York, North Carolina, 
and Rhode Island, specifically made their 
ratification 
contingent 
on 
this 
under-
standing being made express: 
New York: ‘‘Under these impressions and 
declaring that the rights aforesaid cannot be 
abridged or violated, and the Explanations 
aforesaid are consistent with the said Con-
stitution, And in confidence that the Amend-
ments which have been proposed to the said 
Constitution will receive early and mature 
Consideration: We the said Delegates, in the 
Name and in [sic] the behalf of the People of 
the State of New York Do by these presents 
Assent to and Ratify the said Constitution. 
In full Confidence . . . that the Congress will 
not make or alter any Regulation in this 
State respecting the times places and man-
ner of holding Elections for Senators or Rep-
resentatives unless the Legislature of this 
State shall neglect or refuse to make laws or 
regulations for the purpose, or from any cir-
cumstance be incapable of making the same, 
and that in those cases such power will only 
be exercised until the Legislature of this 
State 
shall 
make 
provision 
in 
the 
Premises[.]’’ 
N. Carolina: ‘‘That Congress shall not 
alter, modify, or interfere in the times, 
places, or manner of holding elections for 
senators and representatives, or either of 
them, except when the legislature of any 
state shall neglect, refuse or be disabled by 
invasion or rebellion, to prescribe the same.’’ 
Rhode Island: ‘‘Under these impressions, 
and declaring, that the rights aforesaid can-
not be abridged or violated, and that the ex-
planations aforesaid, are consistent with the 
said constitution, and in confidence that the 
amendments hereafter mentioned, will re-
ceive an early and mature consideration, and 
conformably to the fifth article of said con-
stitution, speedily become a part thereof; We 
the said delegates, in the name, and in [sic] 
the behalf of the People, of the State of 
Rhode-Island and Providence-Plantations, do 
by these Presents, assent to, and ratify the 
said Constitution. In full confidence . . . 
That the Congress will not make or alter any 
regulation in this State, respecting the 
times, places and manner of holding elec-
tions for senators and representatives, unless 
the legislature of this state shall neglect, or 
refuse to make laws or regulations for the 
purpose, or from any circumstance be in-
capable of making the same; and that [i]n 
those cases, such power will only be exer-
cised, until the legislature of this State shall 
make provision in the Premises[.] 
This clearly demonstrates that the Fram-
ers designed and the ratifying States under-
stood the Elections Clause to serve solely as 
a protective backstop to ensure the preserva-
tion of the Federal Government, not as a 
font of limitless power for Congress to wrest 
control of federal elections from the States. 
This understanding was also reinforced by 
debate during the first Congress that con-
vened under the Constitution. ‘‘During the 
first session of the First Congress . . . Rep-
resentative Aedanus Burke unsuccessfully 
proposed a constitutional amendment to 
limit the Times, Places and Manner Clause 
to emergencies.’’ But those on both sides of 
the Burke amendment debate already under-
stood the Elections Clause to limit Federal 
elections power to emergencies. 
For example, the recorded description of 
opponent Representative Goodhue’s com-
ments notes that he believed the Elections 
Clause as written was intended to prevent 
‘‘. . . 
the 
State 
Governments 
[from] 
oppos[ing] and thwart[ing] the general one to 
such a degree as finally to overturn it. Now, 
to guard against this evil, he wished the Fed-
eral Government to possess every power nec-
essary to its existence.’’ With any change to 
the original text therefore unnecessary to 
achieve Burke’s desired goal, Mr. Goodhue 
voted against the proposed amendment. 
Similarly, 
proponent 
Representative 
Smith of South Carolina also believed the 
original text of the Elections Clause already 
limited the Federal Government’s power 
over federal elections to emergencies and so 
thought there would be no harm in sup-
porting an amendment to make that lan-
guage express. So, even the records of the 
First Congress reflect a recognition of the 
emergency nature of congressional power 
over federal elections. 
Similarly, the Supreme Court has sup-
ported this understanding. In Smiley v. 
Holm, the Court held that Article 1, Section 
4 of the Constitution reserved to the States 
the primary 
‘‘. . . authority to provide a complete code 
for congressional elections, not only as to 
times and places, but in relation to notices, 
registration, supervision of voting, protec-
tion of voters, prevention of fraud and cor-
rupt practices, counting of votes, duties of 
inspectors and canvassers, and making and 
publication of election returns; in short, to 
enact the numerous requirements as to pro-
cedure and safeguards which experience 
shows are necessary in order to enforce the 
fundamental right involved. And these re-
quirements would be nugatory if they did 
not have appropriate sanctions in the defini-
tion of offenses and punishments. All this is 
comprised in the subject of ‘‘times, places 
and manner of holding elections,’’ and in-
volves lawmaking in its essential features 
and most important aspect.’’ 
This holding, of course, is consistent with 
the understanding of the Elections Clause 
since the framing of the Constitution. The 
Smiley Court also held that while Congress 
maintains the authority to ‘‘. . . supplement 
these state regulations or [to] substitute its 
own[ ]’’, such authority remains merely ‘‘a 
general supervisory power over the whole 
subject.’’ More recently, the Court noted in 
Arizona v. Inter-Tribal Council of Ariz., Inc. 
that ‘‘[t]his grant of congressional power 
[that is, the fail-safe provision in the Elec-
tions Clause] was the Framers’ insurance 
against the possibility that a State would 
refuse to provide for the election of rep-
resentatives to the Federal Congress.’’ The 
Court explained that the Elections Clause 
‘‘. . . imposes [upon the States] the duty . . . 
to prescribe the time, place, and manner of 
electing Representatives and Senators[.]’’ 
And, while, as the Court noted, ‘‘[t]he power 
of Congress over the ‘Times, Places and Man-
ner’ of congressional elections ‘is para-
mount, and may be exercised at any time, 
and to any extent which it deems expedient; 
and so far as it is exercised, and no farther, 
the regulations effected supersede those of 
the 
State 
which 
are 
inconsistent 
therewith[ ]’’, the Inter-Tribal Court ex-
plained, quoting extensively from The Fed-
eralist no. 59, that it was clear that the con-
gressional fail-safe included in the Elections 
Clause was intended for the sorts of govern-
mental self-preservation discussed in this 
Report: ‘‘[E]very government ought to con-
tain 
in 
itself 
the 
means 
of 
its 
own 
preservation[.]’’; ‘‘[A]n exclusive power of 
regulating elections for the national govern-
ment, in the hands of the State legislatures, 
would leave the existence of the Union en-
tirely at their mercy. They could at any mo-
ment annihilate it by neglecting to provide 
for the choice of persons to administer its af-
fairs.’’ 
CONCLUSION 
It is clear in every respect that the con-
gressional fail-safe described in the Elections 
Clause vests purely secondary authority over 
federal elections in the federal legislative 
branch and that the primary authority rests 
with the States. Congressional authority is 
intended to be, and as a matter of constitu-
tional fact is, limited to addressing the 
worst imaginable issues, such as invasion or 
other matters that might lead to a State not 
electing representatives to constitute the 
two Houses of Congress.’’ Our authority has 
never extended to the day-to-day authority 
over the ‘‘Times, Places and Manner of Elec-
tion’’ that the Constitution clearly reserves 
to the States. Unfortunately for Democrats, 
this clear restriction on congressional au-
thority means that we do not have the power 
to implement the overwhelming majority—if 
not the entirety—of their biggest legislative 
priority, H.R. 1 and related legislation, 
which would purport to nationalize our elec-
tions and centralize their administration in 
Washington, D.C. Thankfully, the Framers 
had the foresight to write our Constitution 
so as to prevent those bad policies from 
going into effect and preserve the health of 
our republic. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman 
from Alabama (Ms. SEWELL), the chief 
sponsor of this legislation. 
Ms. SEWELL. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today in full support of H.R. 4, the 
John R. Lewis Voting Rights Advance-
ment Act. 
Nothing is more fundamental to our 
democracy than the right to vote.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4394 
August 24, 2021 
Nothing is more precious to my dis-
trict, Alabama’s 7th Congressional Dis-
trict, the home of Birmingham, Mont-
gomery, and my hometown of Selma, 
Alabama, than the fight to protect the 
right to vote for all Americans. 
It was in my district that ordinary 
Americans peacefully protested for the 
equal right to vote for all Americans. 
Nothing is more personal to me, 
nothing 
more 
represents 
America’s 
civil rights district than to be able to 
stand here, as so many of us have, with 
John Lewis at the foot of the Edmund 
Pettus Bridge, as I announced with 
glee that we have reintroduced H.R. 4, 
the John R. Lewis Voting Rights Ad-
vancement Act. 
It was on that same bridge in Selma, 
Alabama, 
that 
a 
26-year-old 
John 
Lewis was bludgeoned by State troop-
ers with billy clubs in the name of jus-
tice. 
Their efforts led to the passage of the 
Voting Rights Act of 1965, the seminal 
piece of legislation in Congress to pro-
tect the right of all Americans to vote. 
Those protections were gutted in 2013 
by the Supreme Court’s decision in 
Shelby v. Holder, and Section 2 was 
also affected by the most recent deci-
sion in Brnovich. 
Today, 8 years after Shelby, Congress 
is 
finally 
answering 
the 
Supreme 
Court’s call to action by passing H.R. 4. 
H.R. 4 will create a new coverage for-
mula to determine which States have 
been the most egregious actors and 
subject them to preclearance that is 
based on current evidence of voter dis-
crimination. 
Madam Speaker, old battles have in-
deed become new again. While literacy 
tests and poll taxes no longer exist, 
certain States and local jurisdictions 
have passed laws that are modern-day 
barriers to voting. As long as voter 
suppression exists, the need for the full 
protections of VRA will continue. We 
must fully restore the VRA. 
Why? Because as John Lewis would 
say: When you hear something or see 
something that is not right, that is not 
just, that is not fair, we have a moral 
obligation to do something about it. 
We, the Members of the House of 
Representatives, can today do some-
thing about it. Let’s pass H.R. 4. Let’s 
do so not just in the name of John 
Lewis; let’s do so for the people, the 
American people. We must secure the 
right to vote. 
Madam Speaker, I include in the 
RECORD 14 letters of support and state-
ments of support from all across this 
Nation, from civil rights groups, from 
labor groups, from amazing folks who 
are fighting every day on the front 
lines for the right to vote. 
STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY 
H.R. 4—JOHN R. LEWIS VOTING RIGHTS ADVANCE-
MENT ACT OF 2021—REP. SEWELL, D–AL, AND 
218 COSPONSORS 
The 
Administration 
strongly 
supports 
House passage of H.R. 4, the John R. Lewis 
Voting Rights Advancement Act of 2021 
(VRAA). 
The right to vote freely, the right to vote 
fairly, the right to have your vote counted is 
fundamental. In the last election, all told, 
more than 150 million Americans of every 
age, of every race, of every background exer-
cised their right to vote. 
This historic level of participation in the 
face of a once-in-a-century pandemic should 
have been celebrated by everyone. Instead, 
some have sought to delegitimize the elec-
tion and make it harder to vote, in many 
cases by targeting the methods of voting 
that made it possible for many voters to par-
ticipate. These efforts violate the most basic 
ideals of America. 
Yet another massive wave of discrimina-
tory action may be imminent as we enter a 
new legislative redistricting cycle. Unfortu-
nately, incumbents too often cling to power 
by drawing district lines to favor their own 
prospects at the expense of minority commu-
nities, choosing their voters instead of the 
other way around. 
While anti-voter action undermines democ-
racy for all Americans, we know that com-
munities of color often suffer the worst ef-
fects of these measures—and all too often, 
that is not by accident. 
The sacred right to vote is under attack 
across the country. 
The VRAA will strengthen vital legal pro-
tections to ensure that all Americans have a 
fair opportunity to participate in our democ-
racy. Among other things, it would create a 
new framework for allowing DOJ to review 
voting changes in jurisdictions with a his-
tory of discrimination to ensure that they do 
not discriminate based on race. It would also 
clarify the scope of legal tools designed to 
challenge discriminatory voting laws in 
court, ensuring that the Voting Rights Act 
offers protection against modern forms of 
voter suppression. 
In an essay published shortly after he died, 
Congressman John Lewis wrote, ‘‘Democracy 
is not a state. It is an act[.]’’ This bill not 
only bears his name, it heeds his call. The 
Administration looks forward to working 
with Congress as the VRAA proceeds through 
the legislative process to ensure that the bill 
achieves lasting reform consistent with Con-
gress’ broad constitutional authority to pro-
tect voting rights and to strengthen our de-
mocracy. 
AUGUST 18, 2021. 
DEAR REPRESENTATIVE: On behalf of the 
Southern Poverty Law Center Action Fund, 
we write to urge you to support H.R. 4, the 
John R. Lewis Voting Rights Advancement 
Act, when the House considers this essential 
legislation next week. When enacted into 
law, this legislation will restore Section 5 of 
the Voting Rights Act of 1965 (VRA) and re-
quire states and localities with recent his-
tories of racial discrimination to seek fed-
eral approval before implementing any vot-
ing changes; would require any state or ju-
risdiction to seek federal approval before im-
plementing any voting practice known to 
have racially discriminatory impact; and 
would strengthen Section 2 of the VRA, 
which gives the Department of Justice and 
voters the ability to challenge discrimina-
tory voting laws and practices. 
Through our collaborative, intersectional 
work with community partners around the 
Deep South, the SPLC has witnessed first- 
hand continued efforts to suppress the vote 
and undermine the democratic process—par-
ticularly for communities of color—since the 
Supreme Court’s Shelby County v. Holder de-
cision in 2013. Earlier this week, during an 
oversight hearing held by the U.S. House of 
Representatives Judiciary Subcommittee on 
the Constitution, Civil Rights, and Civil Lib-
erties on the need for federal voting rights 
protection legislation, SPLC submitted a se-
ries of detailed reports revealing current, 
consistent, and well-documented racial dis-
crimination in voting in Alabama, Lou-
isiana, and Mississippi for the legislative 
record. The reports highlight a range of re-
cent and persistent efforts to make it more 
difficult to vote, from reducing early voting 
to closing polling places in majority-Black 
communities and banning Sunday voting 
that has the effect—and often the intent—of 
blocking Black voters and other voters of 
color from voting. The United States claims 
to be the world’s oldest democracy, but from 
its founding to today it has never fully se-
cured and defended the right to vote for all 
Americans, particularly Black Americans 
and other voters of color. 
For generations, legislators of both parties 
and Americans across all ideologies have 
supported the VRA—because they have un-
derstood that for our democracy to be 
healthy, every voter in the country must 
have safe, easy, and equitable access to their 
fundamental right to vote. The VRA has ex-
traordinary bipartisan roots. Passed in 1965, 
Congress has reauthorized the VRA four 
times since then, with four Republican Presi-
dents signing the legislation into law: Presi-
dent Nixon in 1970, President Ford in 1975, 
President Reagan in 1982, and President 
George W. Bush in 2006. In 2006, after more 
than twenty hearings, with over 90 wit-
nesses, and over 15,000 pages of evidence of 
ongoing voter suppression and discrimina-
tion, Congress approved a 25-year extension 
of the VRA by a vote of 98–0 in the Senate 
and 390–33 in the House. More than ninety 
current Members of Congress voted for that 
legislation. Yet, notwithstanding well-docu-
mented findings and overwhelming congres-
sional support, just seven years later, in the 
Shelby County decision, a 5–4 majority of the 
Supreme Court held that Section 5’s cov-
erage formula was not based on ‘‘current 
conditions,’’ and we lost a critical tool in the 
fight for equal voting rights—the Justice De-
partment’s opportunity to review and reject 
discriminatory voting changes in jurisdic-
tions with a history of racial discrimination 
in voting. 
Enactment of the John R. Lewis Voting 
Rights Advancement Act will enable the fed-
eral government to once again act as a bar-
rier to prevent racially discriminatory vot-
ing changes and help protect a democracy 
that works for all of us—no matter where we 
live. Congress should utilize every legislative 
tool in its capacity to get this done; democ-
racy is too important to be subject to a mi-
nority veto. 
Last month, Justice Elena Kagan wrote 
eloquently about the Voting Rights Act in 
her stirring dissent in another Supreme 
Court refusal to recognize and enforce broad 
voting 
rights, 
the 
deeply 
disappointing 
Brnovich v. Democratic National Committee 
decision: 
‘‘If a single statute represents the best of 
America, it is the Voting Rights Act. It mar-
ries two great ideals: democracy and racial 
equality . . . . If a single statute reminds us 
of the worst of America, it is the Voting 
Rights Act. Because it was—and remains—so 
necessary.’’ 
We could not agree more. 
In the wake of Supreme Court decisions 
that have significantly weakened the VRA, 
and a proliferation of state anti-voter laws— 
primarily in the South—Congress must act 
to restore the Voting Rights Act to its full 
vigor and promise and ensure that citizens in 
every state have broad opportunities to exer-
cise their constitutional right to vote. 
Respectfully, 
LASHAWN Y. WARREN, 
Chief Policy Officer.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4395 
August 24, 2021 
& Deputy Legal Di-
rector 
for 
Voting 
Rights. 
AUGUST 23, 2021. 
FRIENDS: This week, the House is scheduled 
to take up the FY22 Budget Resolution (S. 
Con. Res. 14) and the John Lewis Voting 
Rights Advancement Act (H.R. 4), as well as 
the rule to consider these bills. The Human 
Rights Campaign urges Members to vote in 
favor of the rule, the budget resolution, and 
the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement 
Act. We will consider these key votes. 
The FY22 Budget Resolution (S. Con. Res. 
14) will pave the way for reconciliation. The 
provisions of that package will include paid 
leave, a long-needed benefit particularly for 
the 40% LGBTQ+ adults working in res-
taurants and food service, who often lack the 
ability to take leave care for a family mem-
ber. It will also provide a pathway to citizen-
ship for the approximately 75,000 LGBTQ+ 
Dreamers living in the United States, as well 
as the millions of TPS holders, many of 
whom are essential workers that have helped 
keep our country running during the pan-
demic. 
The John Lewis Voting Rights Advance-
ment Act (H.R. 4) would restore key voting 
rights protections that the Supreme Court 
gutted in the 2013 Shelby County v. Holder 
decision. Since the Supreme Court’s deci-
sion, states and localities have brazenly 
pushed forward discriminatory changes to 
voting practices, such as changing district 
boundaries to disadvantage select voters, in-
stituting more onerous voter identification 
laws, and changing polling locations with lit-
tle notice. These laws especially disenfran-
chise people of color, the elderly, low-income 
people, transgender people and people with 
disabilities. 
Transgender people are particularly vul-
nerable to voting discrimination and dis-
enfranchisement due primarily to challenges 
around valid identification documents. Many 
transgender people do not have forms of ID 
that reflect their true gender identity, either 
because they are in the process of changing 
their documents or because they face finan-
cial or legal barriers to doing so. In addition, 
many LGBTQ+ people face compounded dis-
crimination based on other characteristics, 
including race, age, disability, and economic 
status. These vulnerabilities weaken our en-
tire community’s voting power. 
Again, we urge Members to vote in favor of 
the rule, S. Con. Res. 14, and H.R. 4. 
Best, 
DAVID STACY, 
Government Affairs Director, 
Human Rights Campaign. 
HI HILLARY: J Street, along with over 100 
other organizations, is proud to share our 
support for the newly reintroduced John 
Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act of 
2021 (H.R. 4). The bill would restore the 
preclearance protections stripped from the 
Voting Rights Act and strengthen voting 
rights across the country. 
With voting rights under threat, the pas-
sage of H.R. 4 would be a critical step toward 
protecting the future of our democracy and 
functioning governance. 
J Street urges both co-sponsorship and a 
YES vote when the bill comes to the floor 
next week. 
As always, please do not hesitate to let me 
know if you have any questions. 
All the best, 
HANNAH MORRIS, 
Deputy Director of Government Affairs, 
J Street. 
TUESDAY, AUGUST 17, 2021. 
LDF Media 
For Immediate Release 
LDF ISSUES STATEMENT ON INTRODUCTION OF 
H.R. 4, THE JOHN LEWIS VOTING RIGHTS AD-
VANCEMENT ACT, BY THE U.S. HOUSE OF REP-
RESENTATIVES 
Today, the U.S. House of Representatives 
introduced H.R. 4, the John Lewis Voting 
Rights Advancement Act, a much needed 
piece of legislation aimed at protecting the 
right to vote. In response, Sherrilyn Ifill, 
President 
and 
Director-Counsel 
of 
the 
NAACP 
Legal 
Defense 
and 
Educational 
Fund, Inc. (LDF) issued the following state-
ment: 
‘‘We commend the House of Representa-
tives for taking this critically important 
step in protecting the right to vote with its 
introduction today of the John Lewis Voting 
Rights Advancement Act, H.R. 4. This legis-
lation provides the building blocks for Con-
gress to fully engage in its duty to protect 
citizens from any efforts to restrict or 
abridge their most fundamental right—the 
right to vote. 
‘‘H.R. 4 includes provisions that would re-
quire states and localities with recent 
records of discrimination in voting to have 
their proposed voting changes reviewed be-
fore they are implemented to ensure they are 
not discriminatory. These provisions are cru-
cial 
to 
ensure 
that 
people 
are 
not 
disenfranchised and able to freely partici-
pate in the political process. If these provi-
sions had been in effect this year—as was the 
case prior to the Shelby County decision— 
the restrictive voting bills that were re-
cently enacted in states, such as Georgia, 
Florida, and Arizona, would not have been 
able to go into effect unless and until the 
states proved that those laws would not dis-
criminate against racial, ethnic, or language 
minorities. 
‘‘Time is of the essence. Today’s introduc-
tion of H.R. 4 is the beginning of the process 
that ultimately must end in the passage of 
this critically important piece of legislation. 
With the fall election season nearly upon us 
and nation-wide midterm elections a year 
away, Congress must ensure that every 
voter—especially Black voters and other vot-
ers of color—can exercise their right to par-
ticipate in the political process without bar-
riers to having their votes cast and count-
ed.’’ 
AUGUST 20, 2021. 
DEAR REPRESENTATIVE: As President and 
CEO of the National Urban League, and on 
behalf of its 91 affiliates in 37 states and the 
District of Columbia, I am writing to express 
our strong support for H.R. 4, the John Lewis 
Voting Rights Advancement Act as it is con-
sidered on the House floor this week. As a 
historic civil rights organization dedicated 
to ensuring that all people are able to exer-
cise their fundamental right to vote, we 
stand with our fellow racial justice organiza-
tions in supporting this bill. 
The John Lewis Voting Rights Advance-
ment Act reauthorizes the Voting Rights 
Act, while putting in place ‘‘fixes’’ in re-
sponse to the Shelby County v. Holder (2013) 
and Brnovich v. Democratic National Com-
mittee (2021) decisions. After the Shelby 
County decision, the number of discrimina-
tory voting laws and practices have dras-
tically increased across the country. The bill 
is in response to the current needs of this na-
tion in the fight for voting rights, which 
have been presented in months-long congres-
sional investigations and hearings. The Vot-
ing Rights Act has a long history of bipar-
tisan support that must continue to prevent 
future inequitable bills and manipulative re-
districting 
efforts 
from 
discriminating 
against voters of color. 
Specifically, this legislation updates the 
‘‘preclearance formula’’ that blocks dis-
criminatory voting laws from being imple-
mented by establishing a new review cri-
terion that accounts for current conditions 
and requires federal review of specific voting 
practices known to impact voters of color. 
Additionally, the bill mandates greater na-
tionwide transparency of voting laws and 
policy changes, expands and updates the 
frameworks that allow courts to ‘‘bail in’’ 
and ‘‘bail out’’ judicial review of jurisdic-
tional practices, and restores voters’ ability 
to legally challenge racially discriminatory 
changes in voting laws and policies. Lastly, 
the bill allows the Justice Department to 
compel documents to investigate voting 
rights violations, expands the federal ob-
server program, and pauses discriminatory 
voting changes during judicial review. 
This bill is a concrete way to advance the 
nation’s fight against discriminatory voting 
laws which specifically target people of 
color. We will continue to support the John 
Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act and 
other proposals that advance the fight for 
the rights, safety, and empowerment of all 
people in our nation. 
For more information, please contact 
Yvette Badu-Nimako, Senior Director for Ju-
diciary, Civil Rights and Social Justice at 
ybadu@nul.org. 
Sincerely, 
MARC H. MORIAL, 
President and Chief Executive Officer, 
National Urban League. 
PASS THE JOHN R. LEWIS VOTING RIGHTS 
ADVANCEMENT ACT 
THE
BILL
WOULD
RESTORE
CRUCIAL
PROTEC-
TIONS THAT HAVE BEEN REMOVED FROM THE 
VOTING RIGHTS ACT OF 1965. 
On Tuesday afternoon, Democratic law-
makers stood on consecrated ground—the 
foot of the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma, 
Alabama. 
The members of Congress weren’t there 
simply to honor the sacrifices of the late 
civil rights icon John Lewis and the hun-
dreds of other marchers who braved police 
tear gas and clubs for the right to vote, as 
they’ve done in the past. They were gathered 
to announce the introduction of the John R. 
Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act (H. 
R. 4), transformative legislation that would 
restore the protections of the Voting Rights 
Act that Lewis fought so hard to enact as a 
civil rights activist. 
In 2013, the Supreme Court’s infamous 
Shelby County v. Holder decision invalidated 
the 1965 law’s Section 5 ‘‘preclearance’’ re-
quirements. which prevented jurisdictions 
with a history of racial discrimination from 
changing voting rules without permission 
from the Justice Department or a federal 
court. In the ruling gutting the landmark 
civil rights law, Chief Justice John Roberts 
waved away concerns of new voting restric-
tions, claiming that ‘‘nearly 50 years later, 
things have changed dramatically.’’ 
Unfortunately, things have changed dra-
matically—just not how Roberts thought. 
The danger of new voting restrictions is no 
longer theoretical. It’s a grim reality. After 
record voter turnout in 2020, Republican 
state legislators around the country have re-
sponded by cracking down on the right to 
vote. Brennan Center research shows that 
this year, 49 states have introduced over 400 
bills with provisions that make it harder to 
vote, 30 of which have become law in 18 
states. Just last month, the Supreme Court’s 
decision in Brnovich v. Democratic National 
Committee weakened Section 2 of the Voting 
Rights Act, degrading citizens’ ability to 
challenge policies that lead to voting dis-
crimination.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4396 
August 24, 2021 
This all paints a bleak picture as the na-
tion’s first redistricting cycle since the 
Shelby County decision looms, potentially 
redefining the balance of power in Congress 
and state legislatures for the next decade. 
As my colleague Wendy Weiser told Con-
gress yesterday, the bill named for Lewis is 
an essential step in turning the tide in this 
war on voting rights. Restoring preclearance 
and strengthening Section 2 of the original 
Voting Rights Act would undo much of the 
damage from the Brnovich and the Shelby 
County rulings. 
President Biden has placed his full support 
behind it, and his Justice Department has 
told Congress that the bill must be passed so 
that the federal government can properly 
protect Americans’ voting rights nationwide 
as the midterms quickly approach. The legis-
lation would provide a desperately needed 
bulwark against continuing state voter sup-
pression efforts. 
Congress must pass the John R. Lewis Vot-
ing Rights Advancement Act without delay. 
Re: NHLA Urges Support of the John Lewis 
Voting Rights Advancement Act, H.R. 4 
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, 
Washington, DC. 
DEAR REPRESENTATIVE: We write on behalf 
of the National Hispanic Leadership Agenda 
(NHLA), a coalition of the nation’s leading 
Latino nonpartisan civil rights and advocacy 
organizations, to urge you to vote ‘‘yes’’ on 
the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement 
Act of 2021 (VRAA), H.R. 4. This legislation 
restores necessary voting protections to en-
sure 
that 
discriminatory 
voting-related 
changes are blocked before they are imple-
mented. There is no right more fundamental 
to our democracy than the right to vote, and 
for more than 50 years the Voting Rights Act 
(VRA) provided voters with one of the most 
effective mechanisms for protecting that 
right. H.R. 4 would provide Latino voters and 
other voters of color new and forward-look-
ing protections against voter discrimination. 
NHLA will closely monitor all votes related 
to this legislation for inclusion in future 
NHLA scorecards evaluating Member sup-
port for the Latino community. 
The VRA is regarded as one of the most 
important and effective pieces of civil rights 
legislation in our country’s history because 
it protected voters of color from discrimina-
tory voting practices before they occurred. 
In 2013, the Supreme Court, in its decision in 
Shelby County v. Holder, struck down the 
formula that determined which states and 
political subdivisions were required to seek 
federal pre-approval of their voting-related 
changes to ensure they did not discriminate 
against minority voters. After Supreme 
Court’s decision, states or political subdivi-
sions were no longer required to seek 
preclearance unless ordered by a federal 
court in the course of litigation. The Su-
preme Court put the onus on Congress to 
enact a new formula better tailored to cur-
rent conditions. 
H.R. 4 includes both a new geographic cov-
erage formula to identify those jurisdictions 
that will have to ‘‘preclear’’ their voting-re-
lated changes and a new provision requiring 
practice-based 
preclearance, 
or 
‘‘known- 
practices coverage.’’ Known-practices cov-
erage would focus administrative or judicial 
review narrowly on suspect practices that 
are most likely to be tainted by discrimina-
tory intent or to have discriminatory effects, 
as demonstrated by a broad historical 
record. Any jurisdiction in the U.S. that is 
home to a racially, ethnically, or linguis-
tically diverse population and that seeks to 
adopt a covered practice will be required to 
preclear the change before implementation. 
The known practices covered under the bill 
include: (1) changes in method of election to 
change a single-member district to an at- 
large seat or to add an at-large seat to a gov-
erning body; (2) certain redistricting plans 
where there is significant minority popu-
lation growth in the previous decade; (3) an-
nexations or deannexations that would sig-
nificantly alter the composition of the juris-
diction’s electorate; (4) certain identification 
and proof of citizenship requirements; (5) 
certain polling place closures, realignments, 
or efforts to deny sustenance to voters wait-
ing in line; (6) the withdrawal of multi-
lingual 
materials 
and 
assistance 
not 
matched by the reduction of those services 
in English; and (7) certain voter registration 
list maintenance changes. Preclearance is an 
efficient and effective form of alternative 
dispute resolution that prevents the imple-
mentation of voting-related changes that 
would deny voters of color a voice in our 
elections. Preclearance saves taxpayers in 
covered jurisdictions a considerable amount 
of money because the jurisdiction can obtain 
quick decisions without having to pay attor-
neys. expert witnesses, or prevailing plain-
tiffs fees and costs that are incurred in com-
plex and expensive litigation. 
Across the U.S., racial, ethnic, and lan-
guage-minority 
communities 
are 
rapidly 
growing-the country’s total population is 
projected to become majority-minority by 
2044. Between 2007 and 2014, five of the ten 
U.S. counties with the most rapid rates of 
Latino population growth were in North Da-
kota or South Dakota, two states whose 
overall Latino populations still account for 
less than ten percent of their residents, and 
are dwarfed by Latino communities in states 
like New Mexico, Texas, and California. It is 
precisely this rapid growth of different racial 
or ethnic populations that results in the per-
ception that emerging communities of color 
are a threat to those in political power. H.R. 
4 identifies different voting changes most 
likely to discriminatorily affect access to 
the vote in increasingly diverse jurisdictions 
whose minority populations are attaining 
visibility and influence. The approach is tai-
lored to the current needs of voters today 
and is supported by a large body of evidence 
that shows that certain practices are used 
routinely to discriminate against voters of 
color. 
Congress must protect the access to the 
polls, and it must include a known-practices 
coverage formula. H.R. 4 is a critical piece of 
legislation, including to the Latino commu-
nity, that will restore voter protections that 
were lost after the Shelby County decision. 
NHLA urges you to stand with voters and to 
vote ‘‘yes’’ on H.R. 4.

Re: MALDEF Support for the John Lewis 
Voting Rights Advancement Act of 2021, H.R. 
4 
DEAR
CONGRESSMEMBER: 
On 
behalf 
of 
MALDEF (Mexican American Legal Defense 
and Educational Fund), I write to strongly 
urge you to support the John Lewis Voting 
Rights Advancement Act of 2021, H.R. 4. Fol-
lowing the 2013 Shelby County v. Holder de-
cision, which effectively ended pre-clearance 
review under Section 5 of the Voting Rights 
Act of 1965 (VRA), states and localities 
moved to implement discriminatory voting 
practices that would previously have been 
blocked by the VRA. What we have seen 
post-Shelby County confirms what we have 
long-known—that voter discrimination lives 
on. Congress must act to restore the pre- 
clearance coverage formula in the VRA, leg-
islation that has long-enjoyed bipartisan 
support. 
Founded in 1968, MALDEF is the nation’s 
leading Latino legal civil rights organiza-
tion. Commonly known as the ‘‘law firm of 
the Latino community,’’ MALDEF promotes 
social change in the areas of voting rights, 
immigrants’ rights, education, employment, 
and access to justice. Since its founding, 
MALDEF has worked diligently to secure 
equal voting rights for Latinos and to pro-
mote increased civic engagement and par-
ticipation within the Latino community. 
MALDEF played a leading role in securing 
the full protection of the VRA for the Latino 
community through the 1975 congressional 
reauthorization of the 1965 VRA. In court, 
MALDEF has, over the years, litigated nu-
merous cases under Section 2, Section 5, and 
Section 203 of the VRA, challenging at-large 
systems, discriminatory redistricting, ballot 
access barriers, undue voter registration re-
quirements, voter assistance restrictions, 
and failure to provide bilingual ballot mate-
rials. 
Discrimination 
in 
voting, 
including 
against Latino voters, continues to be a seri-
ous and persistent threat to our democracy 
today. This is demonstrated in the compara-
tive rates of voter registration and voter 
participation among racial groups, including 
Latinos. The 2020 presidential general elec-
tion showed unprecedented numbers of vot-
ers participating and rates of eligible par-
ticipation unseen in a century, but instead of 
celebrating this work to reduce voter sup-
pression and continue a trend toward ex-
panding the franchise, the election has been 
used to justify increased efforts to reduce 
minority voter participation in future elec-
tions. This is a continuation of a recent pat-
tern of increasing voter suppression efforts, 
which stems from ongoing demographic 
changes, including in particular the unprece-
dented growth of the Latino voting commu-
nity. 
In 
the 
aftermath 
of 
Shelby 
County, 
MALDEF originated the idea of practice- 
based pre-clearance coverage as a limited 
complement to a geographic, history-based 
formula for broader pre-clearance coverage. 
Practice-based coverage would address the 
increasing introduction and enactment of 
voter suppression measures precisely in re-
sponse to the growth of the local Latino 
community to a level viewed as a threat to 
the political establishment. Practice-based 
pre-clearance would focus administrative or 
judicial review narrowly on suspect practices 
that are most likely to be tainted by dis-
criminatory intent or to have discriminatory 
effects, as demonstrated by a broad histor-
ical record. This coverage would extend to 
any jurisdiction in the U.S. that is home to 
a racially, ethnically, or linguistically di-
verse population and that seeks to adopt a 
covered practice, despite that practice’s 
known likelihood of being discriminatory 
when used in a diverse population. 
While litigation, by private parties and by 
the Department of Justice, under Section 2 
of the VRA remains a powerful means to 
stop voter suppression, such litigation is not 
sufficient to address all the current and fu-
ture potential for elections changes tied to 
voter suppression. Pre-clearance review ben-
efits jurisdictions by reducing their costs in

defending potential elections changes, and 
benefits voting rights by yielding more time-
ly resolution of voting rights disputes. 
Congress must protect access to the polls 
and pass H.R. 4, including provisions for 
practice-based preclearance. This legislation 
is critical to restore voter protections that 
were lost due to Shelby County. We cannot 
allow any more time to pass without ensur-
ing that every voter can register and cast a 
meaningful ballot. MALDEF urges you to 
stand with all voters and to vote ‘‘yes’’ on 
H.R. 4. 
Thank you for your time and consider-

AUGUST 24, 2021. 
DEAR
REPRESENTATIVE: 
Democracy 
21 
strongly urges you to vote for passage of 
H.R. 4, the John Lewis Voting Rights Ad-
vancement Act, when it comes to the floor 
for a vote. 
H.R. 4 is a vitally important—and urgently 
needed—step forward in the work to protect 
the sacred right to vote for all eligible citi-
zens. 
Today, millions of Black, brown, other mi-
norities, the disabled, elderly, and young, are 
at risk of losing their ability to vote due to 
voter suppression laws being passed in nu-
merous states. 
These efforts, if not overridden, will rep-
resent the greatest voter suppression in the 
United States since the Jim Crow era. 
H.R. 4 will restore the preclearance provi-
sion of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 and 
would modernize the formula for deter-
mining which states have a pattern of dis-
crimination 
and 
would 
fall 
under 
the 
preclearance provision. 
Voting is not a privilege, it is a right. It is 
incumbent that Congress act now as the 
right to vote is being severely threatened in 
states around the country. 
The passage of H.R. 4 and H.R. 1, the For 
the People Act, which the House passed in 
March, are essential if we are to protect the 
right to vote in federal elections for all eligi-
ble citizens. The two bills protect the right 
to vote in complementary ways and both 
must be enacted. 
‘‘The vote is precious. It is almost sacred,’’ 
the late Representative John Lewis, the civil 
rights champion, once said. ‘‘It is the most 
powerful non-violent tool we have in a de-
mocracy.’’ 
Democracy 21 strongly urges you to vote 
for H.R. 4. 
Our democracy deserves nothing less. 
Sincerely, 
FRED WERTHEIMER, 
President.

LEASED THE FOLLOWING STATEMENT ON THE 
U.S. HOUSE
INTRODUCING
THE
JOHN
LEWIS 
VOTING RIGHTS ADVANCEMENT ACT: 
‘‘In 1965, President Lyndon B. Johnson 
signed the landmark Voting Rights Act of 
1965 during a critical moment in our nation 
when Jim Crow laws were being used to pre-
vent Black Americans from exercising their 
fundamental right to vote. Since then, the 
Voting Rights Act has been gutted by a 
right-wing Supreme Court and partisan Re-
publican-led legislatures have moved once 
again to take away that right. We’ve seen 400 
bills introduced nationwide that include re-
strictive voting proposals with 30 of these 
bills becoming law in 18 states just this year 
alone. 
‘‘The John Lewis Voting Rights Advance-
ment Act is a fundamental step in protecting 
our freedom to vote by fully restoring the 
power of the 1965 Voting Rights Act and en-
suring that any changes to voting rules 
could not discriminate against voters based 
on race and that we all have an equal voice 
in our democracy. 
‘‘From his historic march across the Ed-
mund Pettus Bridge, to his decades of fight-
ing for voting rights and social justice, Con-
gressman John Lewis never gave up in the 
pursuit of America adhering to its core val-
ues and principles—that every American cit-
izen should be heard and have a voice. Con-
gress must honor his legacy by passing the 
John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act 
and the For the People Act to protect access 
to the ballot and ensure that our democracy 
is truly representative of the American peo-
ple.’’ 
DEAR HILLARY: As you prepare to consider 
H.R. 4, the John Lewis Voting Rights Ad-
vancement Act, Foreign Policy for America 
encourages you to uphold the principles of 
democracy and efforts to protect the right to 
vote. Foreign Policy for America urges mem-
bers of the House of Representatives to sup-
port H.R. 4 to restore democracy and safe-
guard the right to vote. We will consider 
scoring final passage in our 117th Congres-
sional Scorecard. 
Foreign Policy for America (FP4A) is a 
non-partisan 501c4 organization founded to 
promote principled American engagement in 
the world. Each Congress, we convene a 
group of experts from across the foreign pol-
icy community to advise on the development 
of our Policy Agenda and our biennial Con-
gressional Scorecard. The FP4A Scorecard 
offers our members, concerned voters nation-
wide, and the media a way to quickly and 
easily understand the degree to which Mem-
bers of Congress support strong, principled 
American foreign policy. 
America’s 
commitment 
to 
pluralism, 
equality, and non-partisan election adminis-
tration are the hallmarks of our democracy 
and have inspired transitions to democracy 
in every region of the world. The United 
States is able to rally allies and mobilize ac-
tion on the biggest global challenges because 
of who we are as a pluralistic, democratic 
country that for generations has inspired the 
world. H.R. 4 is needed to safeguard our de-
mocracy—the beating heart of our prosperity 
and strength. 
Our democracy is at risk today. The John 
Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act re-
stores and expands key ballot access provi-
sions enshrined in the Voting Rights Act of 
1965 that were dramatically weakened by 
2013 Supreme Court decision in Shelby Coun-
ty v. Holder. The right to vote is one of the 
most critical pillars of American Democ-
racy. We must protect it. 
We urge all Members of the House of Rep-
resentatives to support the John Lewis Vot-
ing Rights Act (H.R. 4) to help strengthen 
our democracy and protect the right to vote. 
Please don’t hesitate to reach out if we can 
answer any questions about our position. 
Sincerely, 
CASSANDRA VARANKA, 
Advocacy Director,

VANCEMENT ACT NOW 
WASHINGTON, D.C.—Today at 1pm ET, 
standing on the Edmund Pettus Bridge, Rep. 
Terri Sewell will introduce H.R. 4, the John 
R. Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act, a 
bill to restore the pre-clearance protections 
stripped from the Voting Rights Act, and 
strengthen voting rights across the country. 
The bill is expected to be voted on in the 
House next week. 
Stephany 
Spaulding, 
Just 
Democracy 
Spokesperson and Founder of Truth and Con-
ciliation, issued the following statement: 
‘‘H.R. 4 is essential legislation to ensure 
that the over 400 state-level voter suppres-
sion laws proposed around the country will 
be countered by federal law. But this bill can 
only stop the bleeding—it cannot repeal the 
dangerous suppression laws already passed in 
Georgia, Florida, and more. We need Con-
gress to take comprehensive action to pro-
tect our country’s voting rights and pass the 
For the People Act, the John Lewis Voting 
Rights Act, and the Washington, D.C. Admis-
sions Act—and we have to eliminate the Jim 
Crow filibuster to get it done. 
This fight for voting rights won’t be easy, 
but it is an existential turning point for the 
fate of our democracy—that’s why we’re 
marching in cities around the country in the 
March On for Voting Rights on August 28, to 
raise our voices and demand Congress take 
action. We’re marching in the spirit of Con-
gressman John Lewis, Martin Luther King 
Jr., Rosa Parks, and countless civil rights 
leaders who never gave up on the fight for 
voting rights—and neither will we.’’ 
About Just Democracy. Just Democracy is 
an intersectional coalition with racial jus-
tice at its core—uplifting voices from all 
walks of American life that are too often left 
out of the conversation. The coalition is 
made up of over 40 Black and Brown-led or-
ganizations working across issue areas. It 
mobilizes thousands who know that advanc-

WASHINGTON, D.C.—Today, standing on the

Congresswoman 
Terri Sewell (D–AL) introduced the John 
Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act, 
which will restore critical provisions of the 
Voting Rights Act gutted by the Supreme 
Court. Expected to receive a vote in the 
House of Representatives next week, the bill 
will help stem the rush of attacks on voting 
rights across the country by ensuring that 
states with a recent history of voter dis-
crimination are once again subject to federal 
oversight. 
March On for Voting Rights will call on 
the Senate to pass the John Lewis Voting 
Rights Advancement Act and the For the 
People Act on Saturday, August 28, when 
millions join the March On for Voting Rights 
in D.C., Phoenix, Atlanta, Houston, Miami 
and more than 40 other cities across the 
country to make their voices heard. March-
ers will also call for the Senate to remove 
the filibuster as a roadblock to critical vot-
ing rights legislation. 
Rev. Al Sharpton, President and Founder 
of National Action Network, commented in 
response: ‘‘If you want to understand why 
the vote is so important, look at the last 4 
years, the last 10 years, and the last 100 
years. Freedom fighter and Congressman 
John Lewis knew it was essential that every 
vote must count in order to assure every

through federal voter suppression and gerry-
mandering, that hasn’t been the case. Today, 
Members of Congress continue to fight for 
the rights of the voiceless with the introduc-
tion of H.R. 4, the first step to right the 
wrongs done to the Voting Rights Act and 
reassert our Constitutional authority over 
democracy. Whether in Congress, in the 
streets, or during our March On for Voting 
Rights, this is the summer of activism.’’ 
Martin Luther King III, Chairman of the 
Drum Major Institute, commented in re-
sponse: ‘‘Both John Lewis and my father 
agreed that there is no right more central to 
democracy than our right to vote. It is the 
cornerstone of democracy, the way we have 
our voices heard. Congress must pass the 
John Lewis Voting Rights Restoration Act. 
Our nation is being put to the test, and we 
must remember my father’s words about the 
fierce urgency of now. 
Arndrea Waters King, President of the 
Drum Major Institute, commented in re-
sponse: ‘‘Coretta Scott King told us, ‘Free-
dom is never really won, you earn it and win 
it in every generation.’ Now is the time to 
earn and win our sacred right to vote. It is 
up to us to remind Congress they represent 
the people, and the people demand the pas-
sage of the John Lewis Voting Rights Res-
toration Act.’’ 
Andi Pringle, Political and Strategic Cam-
paigns Director at March On, commented in 
response: ‘‘Voting rights in America hang by 
a thread, and we are grateful to our leaders 
in Congress who understand the gravity of 
this moment. But some of those in Congress 
act as though voting rights are debatable. 
They are not—voting rights are a funda-
mental requirement of democracy. Without 
legislation like the John R. Lewis Voting 
Rights Advancement Act and the For the 
People Act to protect both voters and elec-
tions, millions will be disenfranchised and 
America will cease to be the democracy we 
claim to be. This is why millions will take to 
the streets on August 28 to demand passage 
of this legislation before it’s too late.’’ 
Stasha Rhodes, Campaign Manager of 51 
for 51, commented in response: ‘‘We are re-
solved to march on August 28 to make sure 
Congress does everything in its power to pass 
the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement 
Act, the For the People Act and the Wash-
ington D.C. Admissions Act. We can no 
longer allow states with long histories of 
disenfranchising our communities to strip 
away voting rights for Black and Brown peo-
ple. After it passes the House, the Senate 
must remove the Jim Crow filibuster as a 
roadblock. Millions will march to make that 
call crystal clear.’’ 
Sopia Woodrow, Community Manager of 
Future Coalition commented in response: 
‘‘As a young advocate, it is fundamental that 
our voting rights be protected. This act, 
combined with the action imminent with 
March On For Voting Rights, demonstrates a 
renewed commitment to protecting the 
voices of every American. Congress must 
pass the John Lewis Voting Rights Act to 
ensure the voices of Americans and youth for 
generations 
to 
come 
are 
heard. 
Disenfranchised communities have waited 
far too long for the voting rights necessary 
to justice.’’ 
Ms. SEWELL. Madam Speaker, in 
conclusion, I want to thank the chair-
man of this committee, Chairman NAD-
LER; 
the 
chairman 
of 
the 
sub-
committee, STEVE COHEN; the chair-
woman of the House Administration 
Committee, Representative ZOE LOF-
GREN; as well as G.K. BUTTERFIELD, for 
the countless hours of testimony and 
the reams of documents that show that 
voter suppression is still alive and well. 
The price of freedom is not free. Let’s 
pay for it by passing the John R. Lewis 
Voting Rights Advancement Act. 
Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Thousands of Americans are stranded 
in Afghanistan, fearing for their lives, 
and Democrats are focused on passing 
legislation to make sure States can’t 
require a photo ID to vote. 
Thousands of Americans are stranded 
in Afghanistan, while hundreds of 
thousands of illegal immigrants cross 
our 
southern 
border 
every 
single 
month. March was the largest month 
on record for illegal crossings until 
April; April was the largest month of 
illegal crossings until May; May was 
the largest month until June; and June 
was the largest month until July; and 
Democrats are focused on passing legis-
lation which says: States who want to 
go back to the election law they had 
just a year ago before the virus, you 
can’t do that unless you come get per-
mission from the Department of Jus-
tice. 
As Mr. DAVIS said, in 1965, Congress 
passed the Voting Rights Act, a good 
piece of legislation that did things that 
needed to be done, put things in place 
that needed to be put in place. But we 
are a long way from that and so much 
better. 
In 2013, in the Shelby County v. Hold-
er Supreme Court decision, the Court 
said there is no need to continue 
preclearance requirements. Here’s a 
quote from the Chief Justice: ‘‘The 
conditions that originally justified’’ 
these measures ‘‘no longer characterize 
voting in the covered jurisdictions,’’ 
Justice Roberts stated. African-Amer-
ican turnout today exceeds White voter 
turnout in five of the six originally 
covered States. During the past elec-
tion, voter turnout was higher across 
all racial groups as compared to prior 
presidential elections. 
The United States of America is the 
greatest country in the history of the 
world. There is no question that our 
country has done more to advance the 
cause of liberty and democracy than 
any other Nation. But, unfortunately, 
it seems the Democrats do not want to 
acknowledge 
all 
of 
that 
amazing 
progress that has been made and where 
we are at today. 
H.R. 4 would subject States and lo-
calities to the whims of partisan bu-
reaucrats within President Biden’s De-
partment of Justice. They get to de-
cide—not States, as our Constitution 
says—no, no, no, you have to go get 
permission from the big Federal Gov-
ernment, do what they say, when it 
comes to your election laws, even if, as 
I said before, you just want to go back 
to where you were a year before 
COVID. 
Republican States that Democrats 
always want to target actually do bet-
ter than Democrat States, like Presi-
dent Biden’s home State of Delaware. 
But for some reason, you don’t hear 
Democrats raising alarms about Dela-
ware, and you don’t see the Biden ad-
ministration bringing lawsuits against 
Delaware. 
Democrats want to focus on this 
manufactured crisis, because they have 
no plans to deal with the real crises 
that are facing our country: inflation; 
crime; the border; and, of course, what 
is going on in Afghanistan as we speak. 
Don’t be fooled. Today, it is easier to 
vote than ever in our country. We need 
to applaud the strides this Nation has 
taken. We need to embrace the great-
ness of our country. This bill is not 
about expanding voting rights; it is 
about Democrats consolidating their 
political power. That is why they are 
focused on this. At a time when there 
are so many critical issues and crises 
facing our Nation, they are focused on 
consolidating their power and, I think, 
taking it away from the States. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman 
from California (Ms. LOFGREN). 
Ms. LOFGREN. Madam Speaker, I 
support the John R. Lewis Voting 
Rights Advancement Act. 
Congress first passed the Voting 
Rights Act while Martin Luther King, 
Jr. led for civil rights and John Lewis 
stood by his side. The law made a dif-
ference, defeating racial discrimination 
in voting. 
But the Court, in the Shelby and 
Brnovich cases, destroyed important 
parts of the law. This bill fixes that. 
With an updated coverage formula, 
practice-based preclearance, and ra-
tional standards to challenge racial 
discrimination, this bill is essential. 
Representatives 
BUTTERFIELD
and 
FUDGE both chaired the Subcommittee 
on Elections, whose hearings estab-
lished the factual bases for this bill. 
All the members of the Subcommittee 
on Elections worked hard holding hear-
ings around America. I thank them, 
and I thank my colleagues on the Judi-
ciary Committee for their work. 
As we vote to restore the Voting 
Rights Act, to protect the rights of 
Americans from being denied the right 
to vote because of their race, we should 
remember, honor, and thank those who 
came before us, and especially our late 
colleague, John Lewis. 
I urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote. 
Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from 
California (Mr. ISSA).

Mr. ISSA. Madam Speaker, our col-
league Rahm Emanuel famously said: 
‘‘You never let a serious crisis go to 
waste.’’ Today, my Democratic col-
leagues are not letting a serious crisis 
go to waste. 
While America is focused on the trag-
edy halfway around the world in Af-
ghanistan, a plan to fail that now has 
successfully failed, the reality is, here, 
instead of holding real hearings, look-
ing at the causes, and maybe, in fact, 
being more helpful in preventing fur-
ther suffering of the 37 million people

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE

August 24, 2021 
in Afghanistan, what are we doing? We 
are codifying a permanent majority of 
the Democratic Party everywhere they 
can. We are making changes to elec-
tion law that pull into Washington and 
into the Attorney General’s office con-
trol of elections that the Constitution 
clearly gave to legislatures. 
What we are doing, by the state-
ments of my own colleagues on the 
other side of the aisle, is we are clearly 
saying we don’t like the Supreme 
Court’s decisions, so we are going to 
find a way to do what we want to do 
even though, in fact, the time and the 
success of the Civil Rights Act has, in 
fact, mostly passed. 
Why can’t you take success? Because 
it no longer benefits the goals of a per-
manent Democratic majority. I am 
sorry for my Democratic colleagues 
that, in fact, the people of America do 
not at times approve of things like the 
tragedy in Afghanistan or, in fact, are 
not willing to accept a permanent 
smear of we can never have elections 
without Federal intervention. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the distinguished 
gentleman 
from 
Tennessee 
(Mr. 
COHEN). 
Mr. COHEN. Madam Speaker, the Re-
publicans say we don’t need this voting 
rights bill, that we should leave the 
power 
with 
the 
States. 
My 
sub-
committee had 13 hearings over 2 
years, and the professors and the attor-
neys told us that every time Black and 
Brown people gain in population and 
start to take power, there start to be 
changes in the laws to stop them from 
having power. 
Just this year, 18 States have en-
acted 30 laws restricting the ability to 
vote. There were at least 495 voter sup-
pression bills pending in the States as 
of yesterday. 
For them to say we don’t need a bill 
in the year that this Capitol faced an 
insurrection, when they tried to over-
turn the electoral college and overturn 
a free and fair election, and after that 
happened, two-thirds of the Repub-
licans voted to overturn the election 
by throwing out the results in Arizona 
and Pennsylvania. And then we wanted 
to study that insurrection, and a very 
thin number of Republicans even voted 
to study it. 
Democracy is on the line. The right 
to vote is on the line. What we learned 
from our hearings is that we need to 
pass the Voting Rights Act and protect 
people’s rights to vote because that is 
what America is about. I support this 
John R. Lewis Voting Rights Act. 
Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, I 
would just remind the gentleman that 
Democrats have objected to the elec-
tors for every Republican President 
this century—every single one. 
I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished 
gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. STEIL). 
Mr. STEIL. Madam Speaker, this 
House just passed a spending frame-
work for $3.5 trillion in new govern-
ment spending. And immediately fol-
lowing, what is next? A plan for a Fed-
eral Government takeover of elections. 
H.R. 4 is focused on overturning the 
Supreme Court decision in Shelby 
County v. Holder and reinstituting 
Federal power over State election laws. 
Preclearance was established in 1965 
because there were blatant attempts to 
disenfranchise African Americans. We 
are not debating that today. We have 
made great progress since 1965. 
What is the purpose of H.R. 4? H.R. 4 
is a Federal power grab. This bill would 
gut voter ID laws across the country. 
The bill would allow the Biden Depart-
ment of Justice to veto State voter ID 
laws. 
In my home State of Wisconsin, some 
said commonsense voter ID laws would 
lower turnout. They were wrong. In 
2020, Wisconsin had the fourth highest 
voter turnout in the country. 
This bill would make it harder for 
States to maintain accurate voter 
rolls. Accurate voter rolls are essential 
for local election officials to accu-
rately administer elections. 
This bill is a Federal overreach. In-
stead of Federal overreach, let’s get to 
work and make it easier to vote and 
hard to cheat. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the distinguished 
gentleman from Rhode Island (Mr. 
CICILLINE). 
Mr. CICILLINE. Madam Speaker, I 
rise in strong support of H.R. 4, the 
John R. Lewis Voting Rights Advance-
ment Act. I am proud to be an original 
cosponsor of this vital legislation. This 
is one of the most important bills we 
will consider this Congress. 
Voting rights are the foundation of 
our democracy, ensuring that every 
American gets a fair say in who rep-
resents them and who makes the laws 
governing their lives. 
Voting rights have been under attack 
all across this country. This year 
alone, 30 new discriminatory voting re-
striction laws have targeted commu-
nities of color, young people, and work-
ing people across 18 States. We cannot 
allow this in America. 
This critical legislation will restore 
voting rights protections and provide 
the tools necessary to ensure discrimi-
natory voting laws cannot stand. There 
is nothing more American than pro-
tecting the right to vote. 
I want to thank my colleague, Con-
gresswoman SEWELL, for her leader-
ship. 
I 
thank 
Chairman 
NADLER, 
Speaker PELOSI, and all the leadership 
for the important work they are doing 
to ensure that voting rights are pro-
tected for all Americans. 
I want to end by taking a moment to 
recognize and remember the late Con-
gressman John Lewis, our colleague 
and friend, one of history’s greatest 
fighters for equality and voting rights, 
after whom this legislation is so appro-
priately named. 
Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the distinguished 
gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. JOHN-
SON). 
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Madam 
Speaker, we have to be clear about 
what is happening here. 
Congress passed the Voting Rights 
Act in 1965 to overcome shameful State 
resistance and barriers that prevented 
minorities from exercising their right. 
But in 2013, the U.S. Supreme Court 
held that continuing to require States 
to preclear election law changes based 
upon conduct from a half century ago 
was an unconstitutional invasion of 
State sovereignty. 
The truth is, as JIM said a moment 
ago, it is easier today for Americans to 
vote than it has ever been before in our 
Nation’s history. The VRA worked. 
Thank the Lord that it did. We over-
came those problems. 
In fact, voter registration disparities 
between minority and nonminority 
voters in States like Texas, Florida, 
North Carolina, Mississippi, and my 
home State of Louisiana, all previously 
covered under the old VRA provisions, 
are now below the national average 
and, get this, they are lower than Dem-
ocrat-run States like New York, Cali-
fornia, and President Biden’s home 
State of Delaware. 
H.R. 4 is a radical, unprecedented 
Federal power grab by unaccountable 
bureaucrats in Washington that every 
conscientious American ought to op-
pose. I urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘no’’ 
on this. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the distinguished 
gentlewoman 
from 
Florida 
(Mrs. 
DEMINGS). 
Mrs. DEMINGS. Madam Speaker, my 
mother was a maid and my father a 
janitor, but they were good, decent, 
honest people who saw voting as their 
duty and knew their vote mattered re-
gardless of who they were and where 
they lived. 
When did some of us, as elected offi-
cials, start believing it is okay to no 
longer protect basic rights but to lie if 
you have to, cheat if you have to, sup-
press the vote if you have to, and then 
stand up and claim victory? 
John Lewis called the right to vote 
‘‘precious, almost sacred,’’ and he was 
willing to risk his life to protect it. 
We reject the politically motivated 
lies that seek to undermine faith in our 
elections. We are the United States of 
America. Yes, we are the greatest Na-
tion in the world. 
Let’s live up to America’s promise 
once again by protecting the precious, 
almost sacred right to vote. 
Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the distinguished 
gentleman 
from 
California 
(Mr. 
MCCLINTOCK). 
Mr. MCCLINTOCK. Madam Speaker, 
not long ago, our elections worked 
well. We maintained accurate voter 
registration rolls and routinely re-
moved people who moved or died. 
After all the candidates had their 
say, on election day, we went to our 
local polling place. We brought our 
children to watch the process and 
taught them to respect it. 
Our neighbors on the precinct board 
handed us our ballot after we identified 
ourselves and signed the roll. We took

it into a curtained booth where no one 
could pressure us to vote a certain 
way. We then handed that ballot back 
to our neighbor, who placed it in a 
locked box. 
It was very hard to cheat because 
every ballot had a simple chain of cus-
tody. 
The woke left seeks to destroy that 
process. Where they control the law, 
registration is instant, and outdated 
registrations are rarely removed. Bal-
lots are sent to every name, followed 
by partisan harvesters to collect them. 
In fact, over 300 mail-in recall ballots 
were just found in the possession of a 
felon passed out in his car in Torrance, 
California. 
Back in California, you can print bal-
lots on your home printer and then 
send them in. Ballots are no longer se-
cret. Family members, spouses, care-
givers, or party hacks can cajole or 
pressure you as you cast your vote. 
Every 
fraudulent 
vote 
disenfran-
chises a legitimate voter. That is the 
ultimate in voter suppression. 
This bill effectively makes it impos-
sible for States to restore integrity 
measures like in-person election day 
voting or voter ID. It ensures that the 
chaos and turmoil of recent elections is 
magnified and institutionalized. 
In every election, somebody wins and 
somebody loses. Democracy depends on 
both sides having the confidence that 
an election was fair and accurately re-
flects the will of the majority. How can 
anyone have that confidence under 
such a system as the left would im-
pose? The answer is we can’t. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the distinguished 
gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. JACKSON 
LEE). 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, 
I include in the RECORD an article with 
breaking news: The Texas Speaker of 
the House signs arrest warrants for ab-
sent Democrats in bid to end chamber’s 
weekslong stalemate to fight against 
suppression and oppression in S.B. 7. 
[From the Texas Tribune, Aug. 10, 2021] 
TEXAS HOUSE SPEAKER DADE PHELAN SIGNS 
ARREST WARRANTS FOR ABSENT DEMOCRATS 
IN
BID
TO
END
CHAMBER’S
WEEKSLONG 
STALEMATE 
(By Cassandra Pollock and Patrick Svitek) 
House Speaker Dade Phelan signed arrest 
warrants Tuesday evening for Democrats 
who broke quorum to block a controversial 
GOP elections bill. The warrants will be de-
livered 
to 
the 
House 
Sergeant-at-Arms 
Wednesday. Credit: Jordan Vonderhaar for 
The Texas Tribune. Sign up for The Brief, 
our daily newsletter that keeps readers up to 
speed on the most essential Texas news. 
Texas House Speaker Dade Phelan on 
Tuesday evening signed civil arrest warrants 
for 52 House Democrats still missing from 
the state Capitol as he aimed to regain the 
quorum needed for the chamber to begin 
moving legislation during the second special 
session. 
The move was confirmed by Phelan spokes-
person Enrique Marquez, who said the war-
rants ‘‘will be delivered to the House Ser-
geant-at-Arms tomorrow morning for serv-
ice.’’ 
The warrants were first reported by The 
Dallas Morning News. Democrats who may 
be arrested would not face criminal charges 
or fines and could only be brought to the 
House chamber. Dozens of minority party 
members fled to Washington, D.C., during 
the first special session to block a GOP vot-
ing restrictions bill. 
The 52 warrants represent all but 15 Demo-
crats in the lower chamber. There were at 
least 11 present Tuesday. There were no addi-
tional new Democrats on the floor Tuesday 
after four returned a day earlier—and drew 
the wrath of some Democratic colleagues 
still in Washington, and prompted a renewed 
push inside the party to hold the line. 
Earlier Tuesday, the House voted over-
whelmingly to authorize law enforcement to 
track down lawmakers absent from the 
chamber. 
That 80–12 vote came hours after the Texas 
Supreme Court ordered that those missing 
Democrats could soon be detained by state 
authorities. The order by the all-GOP court 
came at the request of Gov. Greg Abbott and 
Phelan, both of whom had asked the court 
Monday to overturn a ruling from a state 
district judge that blocked those leaders 
from ordering the arrest of the quorum- 
breaking Democrats. 
In a statement after the warrants were 
signed Tuesday evening, state Rep. Chris 
Turner of Grand Prairie, who chairs the 
House Democratic Caucus, said it is ‘‘fully 
within our rights as legislators to break 
quorum to protect our constituents’’ and re-
iterated Democrats’ commitment ‘‘to fight-
ing with everything we have against Repub-
licans’ attacks on our freedom to vote.’’ 
Since the Legislature gaveled in Saturday 
for its second special session ordered by Ab-
bott, the House has been unable to make a 
quorum as dozens of Democrats have re-
mained absent from the chamber. 
When the House was unable to meet its 100- 
member threshold to conduct business Mon-
day, members adopted a procedural move 
known as a ‘‘call of the House’’ in an effort 
to secure a quorum. That move locks doors 
to the chamber and prevents members on the 
floor from leaving unless they have permis-
sion in writing from the speaker. 
That vote earlier Tuesday marks the sec-
ond time in recent weeks that the chamber 
has voted to send law enforcement after 
Democrats still missing from the House. 
During the first special session in July, 
and after more than 50 House Democrats flew 
to D.C., members present authorized state 
authorities to track down their colleagues— 
but the move carried little weight since 
Texas law enforcement lacks jurisdiction 
outside the state. 
By the time that first 30-day stretch ended 
last week, Phelan had signed only one civil 
arrest warrant, for Rep. Philip Cortez, a San 
Antonio Democrat. But that move came too 
late since Cortez, who had briefly returned 
to Austin, had already gone back to the na-
tion’s capital. 
Intraparty pressure has been mounting on 
House Democrats since the second special 
session started. After at least four of them 
returned to the floor Monday, bringing the 
chamber within five members of a quorum, 
some of their Democratic colleagues who 
were still in Washington unleashed on them. 
Rep. 
Ana-Maria 
Ramos 
of 
Richardson 
tweeted at the returning Democrats that 
they ‘‘all threw us under the bus today.’’ 
Pressure ramped up Tuesday morning, 
when a coalition of Democratic-aligned 
groups released a statement urging House 
Democrats to hold firm and continue break-
ing quorum. The 21 groups included Planned 
Parenthood Texas Votes, the state’s Sierra 
Club chapter, the Texas Organizing Project, 
Progress Texas, the Communications Work-
ers of America and several groups that advo-
cate for Latino Texans. 
‘‘To every pro-democracy Texas lawmaker: 
the only way to preserve our right to vote 
and the best way to fight is to stay off the 
House floor,’’ the coalition’s statement said. 
The group also released a four-page memo 
arguing that far more was at stake in the 
second special session than just the elections 
bill, citing a ‘‘host of radical conservative 
priorities’’ 
throughout 
the 
agenda. 
The 
memo was particularly emphatic about a 
new proposal for the second special session— 
dropping the quorum threshold to a simple 
majority—calling it an ‘‘ominous allusion to 
reducing or eliminating minority rights in 
the Legislature, breaking centuries of Texas 
bipartisanship.’’ 
Meanwhile, a number of House Democrats 
have returned to Texas but have not come to 
the House floor to help provide quorum. 
One of them is state Rep. Evelina ‘‘Lina’’ 
Ortega, who says she is home in El Paso but 
not showing up on the House floor until 
there is already a quorum or a majority of 
the Democratic caucus decides to be there. 
‘‘I pretty much feel that it’s a shame that 
the governor and Republicans . . . are really 
using the dirtiest tactic available to them,’’ 
Ortega told the Tribune on Tuesday evening 
after the House’s vote to send law enforce-
ment after the absentee Democrats. ‘‘To me 
it’s all about a power grab. I’m glad to stay 
away and continue to fight them.’’ 
As for whether she is concerned about ar-
rest, Ortega said she believes it would be a 
‘‘big mistake’’ by Republicans. 
‘‘We’ll see what happens,’’ she said. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. This is John 
Lewis, and he says: ‘‘We will stand up 
for what is right, for what is fair, and 
what is just,’’ and we will ensure that 
we have courage, the kind of courage 
that is ‘‘raw courage.’’ 
Today, I ask my Republican col-
leagues to reject the big lie, to reject 
the insurrection, and to reject the idea 
that there is not voter suppression. 
I stand with H.R. 4, a bill that is the 
continuation of the reauthorization 
that I have done over the years as a 
member of the Judiciary Committee. I 
thank Chairman NADLER, Chairman 
COHEN, TERRI SEWELL, all those who 
are part of this great effort, and our 
whip. 
But the real important point is that 
we give the vote back to the American 
people, to the disabled, to young peo-
ple, to senior citizens, and we reject 
that unfortunate statement. The State 
of Texas attorney general, the sec-
retary of state, never found any fraud 
in the election, in particular in 2020. 
I am very glad that this will particu-
larly have the look-back. It will pro-
tect us against such dilution and dimi-
nution. 
This is a bill that has to pass, and the 
Senate has to pass it. Give the vote 
back to the American people. Have raw 
courage. 
Madam Speaker, as a senior member of the 
Judiciary Committee and an original cospon-
sor, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 4, 
the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement 
Act, which corrects the damage done in recent 
years to the Voting Rights Act of 1965 and 
commits the national government to protecting 
the right of all Americans to vote free from dis-
crimination and without injustices that pre-
viously prevented them from exercising this 
most fundamental right of citizenship. 
I thank my colleague, Congresswoman 
TERRI SEWELL of Alabama for introducing this

legislation, to Speaker PELOSI, Chairman NAD-
LER, and the Democratic leadership, and to 
the many colleagues and countless number of 
ordinary Americans who never stopped agi-
tating and working to protect the precious right 
to vote. 
Madam Speaker, in response to the Su-
preme Court’s invitation in Shelby County v. 
Holder, 570 U.S. 193 (2013), H.R. 4 provides 
a new coverage formula based on ‘‘current 
conditions’’ and creates a new coverage for-
mula that hinges on a finding of repeated vot-
ing rights violations in the preceding 25 years. 
It is significant that this 25-year period is 
measured on a rolling basis to keep up with 
‘‘current conditions,’’ so only states and polit-
ical subdivisions that have a recent record of 
racial discrimination in voting are covered. 
States and political subdivisions that qualify 
for preclearance will be covered for a period of 
10 years, but if they have a clean record dur-
ing that time period, they can be extracted 
from coverage. 
H.R. 4 also establishes ‘‘practice-based 
preclearance,’’ which would focus administra-
tive or judicial review narrowly on suspect 
practices that are most likely to be tainted by 
discriminatory intent or to have discriminatory 
effects, as demonstrated by a broad historical 
record. 
Under the bill, this process of reviewing 
changes in voting is limited to a set of specific 
practices, including such things as: 
1. Changes to the methods of elections (to 
or from at-large elections) in areas that are ra-
cially, ethnically, or linguistically diverse. 
2. Redistricting in areas that are racially, 
ethnically, or linguistically diverse. 
3. Reducing, consolidating, or relocating 
polling in areas that are racially, ethnically, or 
linguistically diverse; and 
4. Changes in documentation or require-
ments to vote or to register. 
Madam Speaker, while I am proud to 
strongly support this bill, I would be remiss if 
I did not express my disappointment at the de-
cision to not include my amendments to this 
bill. 
Jackson Lee Amendments #6, #7, and #8 
are easy to understand and vitally important— 
they simply protect state legislators who, in 
keeping with their sacred oath to uphold the 
Constitution of the United States, refuse to 
perform unconstitutional acts under the guise 
of legislative process. 
Specifically: 
Jackson Lee Amendment #6 allows for fed-
eral judicial review of any warrants issued for 
the arrest of a state legislator where said state 
legislator refuses to engage in the state legis-
lative process due to a reasonably held belief 
that doing so would infringe on the right to 
vote. 
Jackson Lee Amendment #7 inserts a 
Sense of the Congress stating that a state’s 
power to arrest a duly elected representative 
of a constituency for refusal to engage in a 
state’s legislative process should be subject to 
federal judicial review where such elected rep-
resentative’s refusal is premised upon a rea-
sonable belief that participation would result in 
the suppression of voting rights or other viola-
tions of the Constitution of the United States 
of America. 
Jackson Lee Amendment #8 privileges 
against arrest any member of a state legisla-
ture for any reason except treason or murder 
while the legislature of that state is debating or 
voting on legislation relating to redistricting or 
election practices or legislation relating to the 
right to vote in federal, state, or municipal 
elections. 
These amendments would have critically 
strengthened H.R. 4 because state legisla-
tures across the country are utilizing every 
weapon in their arsenal to curtail voting rights; 
and no one should fear arrest due to fighting 
for the Constitutional rights of their constitu-
ents. 
This includes my home state of Texas, 
where earlier this month officers of the Texas 
House of Representatives delivered civil arrest 
warrants, signed by the Texas state Speaker 
of the House, for more than 50 absent Demo-
crats in an attempt force a vote on the naked 
attempt at voter suppression known as Texas 
S.B. 7. 
This is the latest Republican attack on these 
brave state legislators, which began on May 
30, where after a night of impassioned debate 
and procedural objections, these Democratic 
lawmakers in Texas took action to block pas-
sage of this massive overhaul of the state’s 
election laws. 
With little more than an hour before the vot-
ing deadline, these Democrats staged a walk-
out, depriving their Republican colleagues of 
the 100-member quorum needed to pass the 
measure. 
And when Governor Abbot called a special 
session in Texas for the purpose of passing 
horrific voter suppression legislation, those 
brave Texas Democrats rose to the challenge 
again and broke quorum. 
Under the threat of arrest, those heroes 
fighting for voting rights have escaped to 
Washington, D.C. 
Since the arrest warrants were issued, it is 
my understanding that mass intimidation of the 
Texas House Democrats has occurred. 
State officials came to their homes with the 
purpose of dragging them back to eviscerate 
the voting rights of thousands of Texas. 
These elected Texas Representatives have 
had to hide away from their friends, their fami-
lies, and their loved ones, all to ensure that 
Texans retain their most sacred of rights. 
They are risking their freedom to ensure 
every Texan has full access to their constitu-
tional right to vote. 
Although the Republicans have tried to spin 
this in many different ways, let’s be clear— 
Texas Democrats are taking a righteous stand 
for our democracy. 
Breaking quorum isn’t an easy choice—leg-
islators must leave family, friends, constitu-
ents, and their important work for days or 
weeks. 
But by making this choice, these Texas 
Democrats are fighting for all of us, because 
voting is not a partisan issue. 
Access to the ballot is a sacred cornerstone 
of our democracy, and we must protect it at all 
costs. 
Last month marked one year since we lost 
a champion for voting rights, and the name-
sake of H.R. 4, Congressman John Lewis. 
In his final words, he reminded us that, ‘‘the 
vote is the most powerful nonviolent change 
agent [we] have in a democratic society,’’ and 
that ‘‘Though I may not be here with you, I 
urge you to answer the highest calling of your 
heart and stand up for what you truly believe.’’ 
We may no longer have John Lewis with us, 
but in his absence, the Texas Democrats are 
following his example, and stirring up good 
trouble, necessary trouble, for our right to 
vote. 
They have followed the truth in his words 
and have sacrificed much to follow the highest 
calling of their hearts. 
Texas Republicans seek to pass voting reg-
ulation laws focused on diverse, urban areas, 
by setting rules for the distribution of polling 
places in only the handful of counties with a 
population of at least 1 million—most of which 
are either under Democratic control or won by 
Democrats in recent national and statewide 
elections. 
These bills would limit extended early voting 
hours, prohibits drive-thru voting and makes it 
illegal for local election officials to proactively 
send applications to vote by mail to voters, 
even if they qualify. 
These bills are at the forefront of Texas Re-
publicans’ crusade to further restrict voting in 
Texas, which saw the highest turnout in dec-
ades in 2020, with Democrats continuing to 
drive up their vote counts in the state’s urban 
centers and diversifying suburban commu-
nities. 
Standing between all of this and the voting 
rights of thousands of Texans are those brave 
state legislators who currently have a warrant 
out for their arrest. 
No elected representative in this great na-
tion should fear that he or she will be locked 
away for simply standing up for justice and en-
suring that America’s citizens have the right to 
vote. 
For this reason, I believe that H.R. 4 would 
have been greatly strengthened by the inclu-
sion of my amendments in the Rule. 
Madam Speaker, I strongly encourage all 
Members of Congress to support this bill, be-
cause it is the responsibility and sacred duty 
of all members of Congress who revere de-
mocracy to preserve, protect, and expand the 
precious right to vote of all Americans by 
passing H.R. 4, the John Lewis Voting Rights 
Advancement Act. 
It is useful, Madam Speaker, to recount how 
we arrived at this day. Madam Speaker, fifty- 
six years ago, in Selma, Alabama, hundreds 
of heroic souls risked their lives for freedom 
and to secure the right to vote for all Ameri-
cans by their participation in marches for vot-
ing rights on ‘‘Bloody Sunday,’’ ‘‘Turnaround 
Tuesday,’’ or the final, completed march from 
Selma to Montgomery. 
Those ‘‘foot soldiers’’ of Selma, brave and 
determined men and women, boys and girls, 
persons of all races and creeds, loved their 
country so much that they were willing to risk 
their lives to make it better, to bring it even 
closer to its founding ideals. 
The foot soldiers marched because they be-
lieved that all persons have dignity and the 
right to equal treatment under the law, and in 
the making of the laws, which is the funda-
mental essence of the right to vote. 
On that day, Sunday, March 7, 1965, more 
than 600 civil rights demonstrators, including 
our beloved colleague, Congressman John 
Lewis of Georgia for whom this important leg-
islation is named, were brutally attacked by 
state and local police at the Edmund Pettus 
Bridge as they marched from Selma to Mont-
gomery in support of the right to vote. 
‘‘Bloody Sunday’’ was a defining moment in 
American history because it crystallized for the 
nation the necessity of enacting a strong and 
effective federal law to protect the right to vote 
of every American.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4402 
August 24, 2021 
No one who witnessed the violence and 
brutally suffered by the foot soldiers for justice 
who gathered at the Edmund Pettus Bridge 
will never forget it; the images are deeply 
seared in the American memory and experi-
ence. 
On August 6, 1965, in the Rotunda of the 
Capitol President Johnson addressed the na-
tion before signing the Voting Rights Act: 
The vote is the most powerful instrument 
ever devised by man for breaking down injus-
tice and destroying the terrible walls which 
imprison men because they are different 
from other men. 
The Voting Rights Act of 1965 was critical to 
preventing brazen voter discrimination viola-
tions that historically left millions of African 
Americans disenfranchised. 
In 1940, for example, there were less than 
30,000 African Americans registered to vote in 
Texas and only about 3 percent of African 
Americans living in the South were registered 
to vote. 
Poll taxes, literacy tests, and threats of vio-
lence were the major causes of these racially 
discriminatory results. 
After passage of the Voting Rights Act in 
1965, which prohibited these discriminatory 
practices, registration and electoral participa-
tion steadily increased to the point that by 
2012, more than 1.2 million African Americans 
living in Texas were registered to vote. 
In 1964, the year before the Voting Rights 
Act became law, there were approximately 
300 African-Americans in public office, includ-
ing just three in Congress. 
Few, if any, African Americans held elective 
office anywhere in the South. 
Because of the Voting Rights Act, in 2007 
there were more than 9,100 black elected offi-
cials, including 46 members of Congress, the 
largest number ever. 
Madam Speaker, the Voting Rights Act 
opened the political process for many of the 
approximately 6,000 Hispanic public officials 
that have been elected and appointed nation-
wide, including more than 275 at the state or 
federal level, 32 of whom serve in Congress. 
Native Americans, Asians and others who 
have historically encountered harsh barriers to 
full political participation also have benefited 
greatly. 
The crown jewel of the Voting Rights Act of 
1965 is Section 5, which requires that states 
and localities with a chronic record of discrimi-
nation in voting practices secure federal ap-
proval before making any changes to voting 
processes. 
The preclearance requirement of Section 5 
protects minority voting rights where voter dis-
crimination has historically been the worst. 
Between 1982 and 2006, Section 5 stopped 
more than 1,000 discriminatory voting changes 
in their tracks, including 107 discriminatory 
changes right here in Texas. 
Passed in 1965 with the extraordinary lead-
ership of President Lyndon Johnson, the 
greatest legislative genius of our lifetime, the 
Voting Rights Act of 1965 was bringing dra-
matic change in many states across the 
South. 
But in 1972, change was not coming fast 
enough or in many places in Texas. 
In fact, Texas, which had never elected a 
woman to Congress or an African American to 
the Texas State Senate, was not covered by 
Section 5 of the 1965 Voting Rights Act and 
the language minorities living in South Texas 
were not protected at all. 
But thanks to the Voting Rights Act of 1965, 
Barbara Jordan was elected to Congress, giv-
ing meaning to the promise of the Voting 
Rights Act that all citizens would at long last 
have the right to cast a vote for person of their 
community, from their community, for their 
community. 
Madam Speaker, it is a source of eternal 
pride to all of us in Houston that in pursuit of 
extending the full measure of citizenship to all 
Americans, in 1975 Congresswoman Barbara 
Jordan, who also represented this historic 18th 
Congressional District of Texas, introduced, 
and the Congress adopted, what are now Sec-
tions 4(f)(3) and 4(f)(4) of the Voting Rights 
Act, which extended the protections of Section 
4(a) and Section 5 to language minorities. 
We must remain ever vigilant and oppose 
all schemes that will abridge or dilute the pre-
cious right to vote. 
Madam Speaker, I am here today to remind 
the nation that the need to pass this legislation 
is urgent because the right to vote—that ‘‘pow-
erful instrument that can break down the walls 
of injustice’’—faces grave threats. 
The threats stem from the decision issued in 
June 2013 by the Supreme Court in Shelby 
County v. Holder, 570 U.S. 193 (2013), which 
invalidated Section 4(b) of the VRA, and para-
lyzed the application of the VRA’s Section 5 
preclearance requirements. 
Not to be content with the monument to dis-
grace that is the Shelby County decision, the 
activist right-wing conservative majority on the 
Roberts Court, on July 1, 2021, issued its evil 
twin, the decision in Brnovich v. DNC, 594 
U.S. ll, No. 19–1257 and 19–1258 (July 1, 
2021), which engrafts on Section 2 of the Vot-
ing Rights Act onerous burdens that Congress 
never 
intended 
and 
explicitly 
legislated 
against. 
Madam Speaker, were it not for the 24th 
Amendment, I venture to say that this con-
servative majority on the Court would subject 
poll taxes and literacy tests to the review 
standard enunciated in Brnovich v. DNC. 
According to the Supreme Court majority, 
the reason for striking down Section 4(b) of 
the Voting Rights Act was that ‘‘times 
change.’’ 
Now, the Court was right; times have 
changed. 
But what the Court did not fully appreciate 
is that the positive changes it cited are due al-
most entirely to the existence and vigorous 
enforcement of the Voting Rights Act. 
And that is why the Voting Rights Act is still 
needed and that is why we must pass H.R. 4, 
the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement 
Act. 
Let me put it this way: in the same way that 
the vaccine invented by Dr. Jonas Salk in 
1953 eradicated the crippling effects but did 
not eliminate the cause of polio, the Voting 
Rights Act succeeded in stymieing the prac-
tices that resulted in the wholesale disenfran-
chisement of African Americans and language 
minorities but did not eliminate them entirely. 
The Voting Rights Act is needed as much 
today to prevent another epidemic of voting 
disenfranchisement as Dr. Salk’s vaccine is 
still needed to prevent another polio epidemic. 
As Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg stated in 
Shelby County v. Holder, ‘‘[t]hrowing out 
preclearance when it has worked and is con-
tinuing to work to stop discriminatory changes 
is like throwing away your umbrella in a rain-
storm because you are not getting wet.’’ 
Madam Speaker, in many ways my home 
state of Texas is ground-zero for testing and 
perfecting schemes to deprive communities of 
color and language minorities of the right to 
vote and to have their votes counted. 
Consider what has transpired in Texas in re-
cent past, let alone the noxious voter suppres-
sion bill, SB7, it is currently trying to ramrod 
through the legislature. 
Only 68 percent of eligible voters are reg-
istered in Texas and state restrictions on third 
party registration, such as the Volunteer Dep-
uty Registrar program, exacerbate the sys-
temic disenfranchisement of minority commu-
nities. 
These types of programs are often aimed at 
minority and underserved communities that, 
for many, many other reasons (like demoniza-
tion by the president, for example) or mistrust 
of law enforcement are afraid to live as openly 
as they should. 
In Harris County, we had a system where 
voters were getting purged from the rolls, ef-
fectively requiring people to keep active their 
registrations and hundreds of polling locations 
closed in Texas, significantly more in number 
and percentage than any other state. 
In addition, the Texas Election Code only 
requires a 72-hour notice of polling location 
changes. 
Next, take what happened here in Texas in 
2019 when the Texas Secretary of State 
claimed that his office had identified 95,000 
possible noncitizens on the voter rolls and 
gave the list to the Texas State Attorney Gen-
eral for possible prosecution—leading to a 
claim from President Trump about widespread 
voter fraud and outrage from Democrats and 
activist groups. 
The only problem was that list was not ac-
curate. 
At least 20,000 names turned out to be 
there by mistake, leading to chaos, confusion, 
and concern that people’s eligibility vote was 
being questioned based on flawed data. 
The list was made through state records 
going back to 1996 that show which Texas 
residents were not citizens when they got a 
driver’s license or other state ID. 
But many of the persons who may have had 
green cards or work visas at the time they got 
a Texas ID are on the secretary of state’s of-
fice’s list, and many have become citizens 
since then since nearly 50,000 people become 
naturalized U.S. citizens in Texas annually. 
Latinos made up a big portion of the 
95,000-person list. 
Texas Republicans adopted racial and par-
tisan gerrymandered congressional, State leg-
islative redistricting plans that federal courts 
have ruled violate the Voting Rights Act and 
were drawn with discriminatory intent. 
Even after changes were demanded by the 
courts, much of the damage was already 
done. 
Reversing the position by the Obama ad-
ministration, 
the 
Trump 
Department 
of 
[in]Justice represented to a federal court that 
it no longer believed past discrimination by 
Texas officials should require the state to get 
outside approval for redistricting maps that will 
be drawn in 2021. 
In addition to affirmative ways to making it 
harder to vote, we also know face other odi-
ous impediments in Texas. 
Those of us who cherish the right to vote 
justifiably are skeptical of voter ID laws be-
cause we understand how these laws, like poll

taxes and literacy tests, can be used to im-
pede or negate the ability of seniors, racial 
and language minorities, and young people to 
cast their votes. 
This is the harm that can be done without 
preclearance, so on a federal level, there is an 
impetus to act. 
Consider the demographic groups who lack 
a government issued ID: 
1. African Americans: 25 percent 
2. Asian Americans: 20 percent 
3. Hispanic Americans: 19 percent 
4. Young people, aged 18–24: 18 percent 
5. Persons with incomes less than $35,000: 
15 percent 
And there are other ways abridging or sup-
pressing the right to vote, including: 
1. Curtailing or eliminating early voting. 
2. Ending same-day registration. 
3. Not counting provisional ballots cast in 
the wrong precinct on Election Day will not 
count. 
4. Eliminating adolescent pre-registration. 
5. Shortening poll hours. 
6. Lessening the standards governing voter 
challenges thus allowing self-proclaimed ‘‘bal-
lot security vigilantes’’ like the King Street Pa-
triots to cause trouble at the polls. 
The malevolent practice of voter purging is 
not limited to Texas; we saw it in 2018 in 
Georgia, where then Secretary of State and 
now Governor Brian Kemp purged more than 
53,000 persons from the voter, nearly the 
exact margin of his narrow win over his oppo-
nent, Stacy Abrams in the 2018 gubernatorial 
election. 
Voter purging is a sinister and malevolent 
practice visited on voters, who are dispropor-
tionately members of communities of color, by 
state and local election officials. 
This practice, which would have not passed 
muster under section 5 of the Voting Rights 
Act, has proliferated in the years since the Su-
preme Court neutralized the preclearance pro-
vision, or as Justice Ginsburg observed in 
Shelby County v. Holder, ‘‘threw out the um-
brella’’ of protection. 
Madam Speaker, citizens in my congres-
sional district and elsewhere know and have 
experienced the pain and heartbreak of receiv-
ing a letter from state or local election officials 
that they have been removed from the election 
rolls, or worse, learn this fact on Election Day. 
That is why I am very pleased that H.R. 4 
includes language that I worked hard to in-
clude in the Manager’s Amendment to the Vot-
ing Rights Advancement Act of 2019 that 
strengthens 
the 
bill’s 
‘‘practice-based 
preclearance’’ provisions by adding specifically 
to the preclearance provision, voting practices 
that add a new basis or process for removing 
a name from the list of active registered voters 
and the practice of reducing the days or hours 
of in-person voting on Sundays during an 
early voting period. 
For millions of Americans, the right to vote 
protected by the Voting Rights Act of 1965 is 
a sacred treasure, earned by the sweat and 
toil and tears and blood of ordinary Americans 
who showed the world it was possible to ac-
complish extraordinary things. 
Madam Speaker, it is the responsibility and 
sacred duty of all members of Congress who 
revere democracy to preserve, protect, and 
expand the precious right to vote of all Ameri-
cans by passing H.R. 4, the John Lewis Vot-
ing Rights Advancement Act. 
Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, was it 
a big lie when the Democrats for 4 
years questioned the 2016 election, 
when in October of 2020 Secretary Clin-
ton said the election was stolen from 
her in 2016? Was that the big lie that 
the 
previous 
speaker 
was 
talking 
about? 
I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished 
gentleman from Oregon (Mr. BENTZ). 
Mr. BENTZ. Madam Speaker, this 
bill would operate to freeze in place, to 
substantially chill, changes to the elec-
tion processes of some of the 90,126 
State 
and 
local 
government 
units 
found in this United States. 
Madam Speaker, I assure you, the 
election processes of many of these 
State and local units are not perfect, 
but this bill would chill necessary cor-
rections and updating of such election 
processes. Why? Because the bill cre-
ates a private enforcement cause of ac-
tion, with attorney fees to the pre-
vailing party, and establishes a clear 
risk to these 90,126 government units of 
incurring tens if not hundreds of thou-
sands of dollars of attorney fees if the 
government unit gets it wrong and vio-
lates the subjective standards, such as 
the undefined term ‘‘diminishes’’ found 
in section 4A(c)(2) in the bill. 
Madam Speaker, after what we have 
been through in the last election, we 
should be working to encourage cer-
tainty and clarity in our election proc-
esses. This bill does not do that. It does 
the opposite. 
b 1645 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the distinguished 
gentleman 
from 
New 
York 
(Mr. 
JEFFRIES). 
Mr. JEFFRIES. Madam Speaker, how 
dare Republicans come to this floor 
and lecture America about masks and 
liberty over and over again while at 
the same time undermining the pre-
cious right to vote? 
Free and fair elections are central to 
our liberty, and we are not going to let 
anyone take that away from us. 
Those who worship at the altar of 
voter suppression will fail. Those who 
worship at the altar of Jim Crow-like 
oppression will fail. Those who worship 
at the altar of turning back the clock 
to make America hate again will fail. 
We are not going backward. 
The 
John 
Robert 
Lewis 
Voting 
Rights Advancement Act will become 
law, and when it is all said and done, 
democracy will prevail, and good trou-
ble will win the day. 
Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from 
Texas (Mr. GOHMERT). 
Mr. GOHMERT. Madam Speaker, as 
has been said earlier by DARRELL ISSA, 
it was Rahm Emanuel that pointed 
out, don’t let a good crisis go to waste. 
So here we have a crisis on our 
southern border and Afghanistan, and 
what do we do? The majority comes in 
here and says, we don’t want our Mem-
bers to have to vote on a $3.5 trillion 
spending bill, so we will just pass a rule 
that says without anybody voting on it 
we pass a $3.5 trillion spending bill. 
And then we will immediately jump 
over to a noble man with a great name 
that did such great work for America 
along with Dr. King, John Lewis, the 
John Lewis Voting Rights Act bill. 
Well, I was here when that was reau-
thorized, when that was redone, and I 
begged, after talking to some liberal 
constitutional professors of law, I 
begged Jim Sensenbrenner and John 
Conyers not to go forward with section 
4(b) the way it was and section 5. Let’s 
do this right so that it won’t be struck 
down. Mr. Sensenbrenner was not open 
to that whatsoever; John Conyers, to 
his credit, was. I said, please talk to 
some professors, let them tell you, it is 
at risk of being struck down. And he 
said, well, they say there is a decent 
chance of that, but let’s see what hap-
pens. 
What happens now? We come in here, 
and we are going to disenfranchise 
American voters by taking over the 
voting across America. The Constitu-
tion reserves those provisions to the 
State legislature. We shouldn’t be 
doing this. 
Back after the 2000 election when 
there were some people in Florida that 
were not as smart as fifth graders be-
cause they couldn’t figure out the but-
terfly ballots, this body jumped in, 
took over, and said everybody go to 
electronic ballots and electronic vot-
ing, and they have caused us misery 
ever since. 
Let’s let States and local government 
do the job the Constitution gave them. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the distinguished 
gentleman 
from 
California 
(Mr. 
CORREA). 
Mr. CORREA. Madam Speaker, today 
I rise in strong support of the John 
Lewis Voting Rights Act. 
Today across the Nation, States are 
eliminating same-day voter registra-
tion, reducing voting times, and lim-
iting the availability of polling places. 
These changes essentially make it 
harder for our friends and neighbors to 
vote. 
This bill is a simple bill. It ensures 
that all legally cast ballots are count-
ed. It ensures that the voices of Ameri-
cans are louder than those of special 
interests. 
I urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘yes’’ 
on the John Lewis Voting Rights Act. 
Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentleman from 
Georgia (Mr. CARTER). 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Madam 
Speaker, I thank the gentleman for 
yielding. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today in 
strong opposition to H.R. 4. 
This legislation is named after a good 
man and a fellow Georgian, John 
Lewis, whom I was honored to call 
friend while we served together in this 
body. 
And let me remind my colleagues on 
the other side of the aisle and the 
Speaker that I was the only Republican 
to join you in San Diego for the chris-
tening of the USNS John Lewis, and I

did it because he was my friend. I did it 
because he should be honored. 
While he was a good man, this legis-
lation does nothing to advance the 
rights of our citizens to vote as my 
friends on the other side of the aisle 
would claim. 
H.R. 4 is a radical and unprecedented 
Federal power grab over State-admin-
istered elections under the guise of up-
dating the Voting Rights Act of 1965. 
At the time, the extraordinary meas-
ures employed by the Voting Rights 
Act were important, however, thank-
fully, as the U.S. Supreme Court recog-
nized in a 2013 decision, things have 
changed dramatically in the U.S. since 
1965. 
In fact, elections in 2018 and 2020 saw 
record turnout among Americans from 
minority communities. 
Madam Speaker, H.R. 4 must be re-
jected to ensure that the Federal take-
over of our elections stops right here. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman 
from California (Ms. PELOSI), the dis-
tinguished Speaker of the House. 
Ms. 
PELOSI. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
I 
thank the gentleman for the recogni-
tion, and I acknowledge his tremen-
dous leadership over time, including 
right now on the issue of voting rights 
in our country. I thank him for bring-
ing this important legislation to the 
floor and to do so under the name of 
Congresswoman TERRI SEWELL, the au-
thor of the bill, who has been working 
on this for a long time, since the as-
sault on the legislation, on these laws 
by the Supreme Court. 
I also thank Mr. CLYBURN, a cham-
pion from the civil rights era to now, 
always fighting for all of this; and ZOE 
LOFGREN, the chair of the Committee 
on House Administration. 
We have so many people to acknowl-
edge; Mr. BUTTERFIELD for his work in 
establishing the constitutional record, 
as well as Marcia Fudge, now Secretary 
Fudge, for her work. So many people 
worked to build a constitutional basis 
to make it ironclad so that the Su-
preme Court of the United States can-
not once again do violence as it did in 
Shelby County v. Holder and the most 
recent assault on section 2. 
Madam Speaker, I think my col-
leagues will all agree that many won-
derful honors are afforded us as Mem-
bers of Congress. I can think of none 
that is more poignant than being here 
today to be able to speak on this im-
portant issue named for John Lewis. It 
is almost a religious experience be-
cause of the sanctity of the vote, which 
is greatly at risk. 
Our colleagues have mentioned some 
of the assaults on voting that have 
taken place to undermine what we are, 
a democracy. We talk about the pre-
amble where 230 years ago our Found-
ers gave us guidance in the words, ‘‘we 
the people’’ establishing a government 
in which the people, not a king, would 
shape their own destiny. 
Ever since, Americans have fought to 
make real that promise for all citizens 
while enshrining in the Constitution 
the 13th and 15th amendments and the 
19th amendment, which we are cele-
brating this week to expand voting 
rights to women and to passing land-
mark civil and voting rights protec-
tions, including the Voting Rights Act. 
Right here in this very Chamber the 
Voting Rights Act was passed. Presi-
dent Lyndon Johnson spoke in a beau-
tiful speech, the ‘‘We Shall Overcome’’ 
speech, in which he called the VRA’s 
passage, ‘‘The history of this country, 
in large measure, is the history of the 
expansion of that right to all of our 
people.’’ 
We all know that the story of Amer-
ica is a story of ever-expanding free-
doms, yet today, that story and those 
rights are under threat from a tar-
geted, brazen, and partisan campaign 
to deny Americans the ballot. 
This campaign is anti-democratic, it 
is dangerous, and it demands action. 
Today, the House will pass H.R. 4, the 
John R. Lewis Voting Rights Advance-
ment Act to combat this anti-demo-
cratic tide. This bill restores the power 
of the Voting Rights Act, as President 
Johnson said, ‘‘ . . . one of the most 
monumental laws in the entire history 
of American freedom.’’ 
Any diminishment of the Voting 
Rights Act is a diminishment of our de-
mocracy. In America, the right to vote 
must never be compromised. 
Again, I thank Representatives SE-
WELL, Mr. BUTTERFIELD, Marcia Fudge, 
JERRY NADLER, ZOE LOFGREN, Mr. CLY-
BURN, and so many who made this day 
possible. 
And let me pause to salute our be-
loved conscience of the Congress, the 
late John Lewis, whose words guide us. 
‘‘The vote is precious,’’ he said. ‘‘It is 
almost sacred. It is the most powerful, 
nonviolent tool we have in a democ-
racy.’’ 
The previous speaker mentioned that 
he had been at the christening of the 
USNS John Lewis. We were all to-
gether in San Diego, and we were hon-
ored that the Congressman was there 
with us. 
As he was saying those words, I was 
remembering that day. We were all 
very excited. It was the largest contin-
gent of Members of Congress to go to 
the christening of a ship—and I have 
been to several, so I know—and what it 
was reminding me of is when we had 
gone a couple years ago in 2019 to 
Ghana; John Lewis led us there. It was 
the 400th anniversary. You were there, 
Madam Speaker. Mr. CLYBURN and so 
many others were there. We were there 
with John Lewis, and we went to the 
door of no return, which now is the 
door of return as they were welcoming 
people back. 
I have on this bracelet that I got 
from the President of Ghana when we 
were there as a remembrance of that 
trip, and I have it on now because what 
John Lewis said then, and apropos of 
the christening of a ship, We may have 
all come to this country on different 
ships, but now we’re all in the same 
boat. That is what John Lewis said. He 
said it in Ghana. He said it many 
times. 
We are all in the same boat. We all 
should have the right to vote. And that 
should not be diminished by anyone. It 
is unpatriotic to undermine the ability 
of people who have a right to vote to 
have access to the polls. 
As John knew, this precious pillar of 
our democracy is under attack from 
what is the worst voter suppression 
campaign in America since Jim Crow. 
Unleashed by the dangerous Shelby v. 
Holder in 2013 and 2021, State law-
makers have introduced over 400 sup-
pression bills. 
I am very honored today, Madam 
Speaker, that we have legislators from 
the State of Texas who are fighting the 
fight for voting rights for people in 
their State and in our country. They 
are patriotic Americans. And let us 
hear applause for those Texans who 
have done so much. 
Much 
has 
been 
said 
about 
preclearance and thousands of dis-
criminatory voting changes. But let us 
just say that in the Shelby decision, 
the dissent was written by Justice 
Ginsburg, and she noted in her dissent 
the Court’s reasoning in Shelby was 
nonsensical. 
‘‘Throwing 
out 
preclearance when it has worked and is 
continuing to work to stop discrimina-
tory changes is like throwing away 
your umbrella in a rainstorm because 
you are not getting wet.’’ 
Sadly, the Court has since continued 
that assault on the ballot. 
So H.R. 4, the John R. Lewis Voting 
Rights Advancement Act, would be a 
remedy to this assault and to restore 
the preclearance provisions. 
I have said earlier today on the rule 
on this vote, in 2006 we all came to-
gether in a bipartisan way to pass the 
Voting Rights Act. Nearly 400 votes in 
the House, unanimous in the Senate. 
We came together in the center of the 
Capitol, marched down the Capitol 
steps celebrating that. 
The bill was signed by President 
George Bush proudly. He joined us in 
Selma, hosted by Congresswoman SE-
WELL. He and President Obama joined 
us in Selma, and he came and spoke as 
the President who had signed the Vot-
ing Rights Act. As I say, more impor-
tantly, Mrs. Laura Bush was there, so 
their hearts were in all of this. It was 
bipartisan. I wish it could be today. 
In our work to protect the ballot, let 
us recall John Lewis’ final message 
published after his passing. ‘‘Democ-
racy is not a state. It is an act.’’ With 
H.R. 4, his namesake, the Congress 
takes this action to build a future in 
which we all have equitable access to 
the ballot and to our democracy. 
In memory of our beloved John, for 
whom this legislation is named, and in 
the interest of passing it and H.R. 1, of 
which he wrote the first 300 pages, let 
us honor our patriotic duty and make 
justice and equality there for everyone 
to vote.

H4405 
August 24, 2021 
b 1700 
Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, the 
Speaker of the United States House of 
Representatives just applauded Texas 
legislators for not showing up to work, 
for not doing their job. I mean, the 
things we see today, it is truly amazing 
to me. 
Madam Speaker, I yield the balance 
of my time to the gentleman from Lou-
isiana (Mr. JOHNSON). 
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Madam 
Speaker, I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the distinguished 
gentlewoman from Pennsylvania (Ms. 
SCANLON). 
Ms. 
SCANLON. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
since the founding of our country, our 
quest for a more perfect union has fea-
tured measures to expand, not con-
tract, the right to vote. 
In 1965, activists, including a young 
John Lewis, put their lives on the line 
to pass the original Voting Rights Act. 
For decades, that law enjoyed broad 
bipartisan support, but in recent years, 
State legislatures have passed hun-
dreds of laws to restrict voter access. 
In 2020, our system held. It held be-
cause 
voters 
turned 
out 
in 
over-
whelming numbers. It held because 
election officials did their jobs faith-
fully, regardless of party. It held be-
cause brave officers of the U.S. Capitol 
and Metro Police defended our Con-
stitution. 
But let’s be clear, the assault on vot-
ing rights continues, inspired by cor-
rupt and cynical efforts to hold power 
at all costs. We must do our job to pro-
tect and reinforce our democratic sys-
tem against these new threats because 
it won’t hold indefinitely. 
Madam Speaker, I urge all Ameri-
cans to hold the line to protect and de-
fend our democracy. I urge swift pas-
sage of the John R. Lewis Voting 
Rights Advancement Act by the House 
and the Senate. 
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Madam 
Speaker, I reserve the balance of my 
time once more. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the distinguished 
gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. GARCIA). 
Ms. GARCIA of Texas. Madam Speak-
er, I rise today in support of H.R. 4 and 
its efforts to protect access to the bal-
lot box and advance justice and democ-
racy for all, including Latinos, which 
represent 77 percent of my district. 
We are all equal under the law and 
should be treated equally at the ballot 
box. Recent attempts by the GOP-led 
legislatures in States like my home 
State of Texas, demonstrate how ur-
gent it is to protect our democracy. 
These attempts could disenfranchise 
nearly 8 in every 10 of my constituents. 
Our country has one of the strongest 
democracies in the world, and it is sim-
ply un-American to disenfranchise vot-
ers. I urge my colleagues to pass H.R. 
4, which would maintain elections free, 
fair, and accessible to all eligible vot-
ers. Let’s make our democracy strong-
er. 
Si se puede. Yes, we can. 
I urge my colleagues to join me in 
support of H.R. 4. 
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Madam 
Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentle-
woman from New York (Ms. TENNEY). 
Ms. TENNEY. Madam Speaker, I am 
strongly opposed to H.R. 4. When our 
Founders created this self-governing 
constitutional republic, they vested 
the power to administer time, place, 
and manner of elections with our State 
legislatures. They knew the sacred 
right to vote would be better preserved 
by democratically elected, accountable 
State and local officials rather than 
unelected Federal bureaucrats. This 
principle has endured for two cen-
turies. However, this principle is now 
under attack here in the people’s 
House. 
My colleagues on the other side of 
the aisle argue that democracy is 
somehow in peril. And their solution to 
this problem is to relinquish total con-
trol of our elections, again, to Federal, 
unelected bureaucrats—a complete op-
posite of democratic concepts; bureau-
crats with the power to prosecute 
based on political views and party af-
filiations. 
These are the same officials who were 
absent 
when 
now-disgraced 
former 
Democrat Governor Cuomo unilater-
ally altered New York election laws 
last year in violation of New York’s 
constitution, which chaotically over-
stressed the system and compromised 
the guarantee of a free, secure, and fair 
election. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to vote against this legislation. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the distinguished 
gentlewoman 
from 
Georgia 
(Mrs. 
MCBATH). 
Mrs. MCBATH. Madam Speaker, I 
rise in support of H.R. 4, the John R. 
Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act. 
During the Civil Rights Movement, I 
was a child in the stroller at the March 
on Washington. And my father, who 
was the president of the Illinois branch 
of the NAACP for over 20 years, he 
raised me to always fight for what is 
right and what is just; to stand up for 
those who don’t always have a voice. 
John Lewis embodied the spirit of 
justice, and he inspired so many to 
fight for voting rights. John did say, 
‘‘Freedom is not a state, it is an act.’’ 
Freedom is the continuous action we 
all must take, and each generation 
must do its part to create an even more 
fair and more just society. 
Today, we do our part. We stand up 
for the right to vote; freedoms this Na-
tion was founded upon and freedoms 
which must long endure. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues 
to join me today in the act of fighting 
for freedom, fighting for democracy, 
and supporting the John R. Lewis Vot-
ing Rights Advancement Act. 
Madam Speaker, I include in the 
RECORD letters of support for the Ad-
vancement Act. 
[From the New Democrat Coalition, Aug. 23, 
2021] 
NEW DEMOCRAT COALITION ENDORSES H.R. 4 
The New Democrat Coalition (NDC) an-
nounced its endorsement of H.R. 4, the John 
R. Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act. 
The bill, introduced by NDC Member Terri 
Sewell (AL–07), seeks to address the most 
egregious forms of recent voter suppression 
by restoring the protections of the 1965 Vot-
ing Rights Act and determining which states 
and localities with a recent history of voting 
rights violations must pre-clear election 
changes with the U.S. Department of Jus-
tice. 
‘‘Our responsibility as members of Con-
gress is to ensure that the American people 
have trust in our democratic process and eq-
uitable access to the ballot box,’’ said New 
Democrat Coalition Chair Suzan DelBene. 
‘‘Congresswoman Sewell is continuing Con-
gressman John Lewis’ legacy by reintro-
ducing this crucial legislation all to keep 
our elections fair and open. The Coalition en-
dorsed this bill because the right to vote is 
the most sacred and fundamental right our 
nation offers. We urge our colleagues on both 
sides of the aisle to join us in passing this 
historic piece of legislation.’’ 
I’m so proud that the John R. Lewis Vot-
ing Rights Advancement Act has earned the 
endorsement of the New Democrat Coali-
tion,’’ said New Democrat Member Rep. 
Terri Sewell. ‘‘The right to vote is the most 
sacred and fundamental right we enjoy as 
American citizens and one that the Foot Sol-
diers fought, bled, and died for in my home-
town of Selma, Alabama. Today, old battles 
have become new again as we face the most 
pernicious assault on the right to vote in 
generations. By restoring federal oversight 
and preventing states with a recent history 
of voter discrimination from restricting the 
right to vote, this bill keeps the promise of 
our democracy alive for all Americans and 
advances the legacy of those brave Foot Sol-
diers like John Lewis who dedicated their 
lives to preserving the sacred right to vote. 
The Coalition has long been an advocate 
for promoting voting rights and protecting 
American elections and endorsed H.R. 4 last 
Congress. Earlier this year, the Coalition 
also endorsed H.R. 1. the For the People Act, 
earlier this year. With the endorsement and 
expected House action on H.R. 4, the Coali-
tion remains committed to advancing voting 
and campaign reform legislation through the 
Senate and to the President as soon as pos-
sible. 
SIERRA CLUB, 
August, 24, 2021. 
DEAR REPRESENTATIVE: On behalf of the Si-
erra Club’s 4 million members and volun-
teers, we are writing to urge a YES vote on 
the rule for the upcoming budget resolution 
and H.R. 4, the John Lewis Voting Rights 
Advancement Act, and the Senate Amend-
ment to H.R. 3684. 
Vote yes on the Rule containing S. Con 14/ 
H.R. 3684 and H.R. 4. 
The vote on this rule will deem the budget 
resolution that would initiate the reconcili-
ation process to tackle the ongoing climate 
crisis, one of our nation’s greatest threats. 
Today’s vote comes just days after the 
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change 
(IPCC) warned that the changing climate and 
extreme weather events we’re already expe-
riencing will continue to rapidly worsen. For 
many states this includes sea level rise, 
coastal flooding, more frequent storms, and 
extreme weather conditions, all of which 
threaten infrastructure and the abundant 
natural resources critical for the local econ-
omy. The growing local impacts of climate 
change are clear, but so too is the fact that

climate inaction will have severe costs for 
the nation’s economy. 
The Sierra Club strongly urges you to con-
sider the enormous significance of this mo-
ment and, VOTE YES on the budget resolu-
tion, so we can begin the necessary process 
through budget Reconciliation to address the 
climate crisis. 
Vote yes on H.R. 4 The John Lewis Voting 
Rights Advancement Act. 
In addition to addressing our nation’s cli-
mate crisis, it is imperative that we also pro-
tect our nation’s democracy. The same com-
munities most vulnerable to climate impacts 
are those disproportionately impacted and 
have been harmed by the dilution of the Vot-
ing Rights Act by the Supreme Court in 2013 
and 2021. 
Since then we have seen a rise in discrimi-
natory voter laws, from cuts to early voting 
days to restrictive voter identification re-
quirements. The John Lewis Voting Rights 
Advancement 
Act 
would 
restore 
preclearance coverage for state, localities, 
and political subdivisions with a history of 
voter discrimination, and would increase 
transparency 
and 
public 
awareness 
for 
changes to voting and polling practices that 
can be confusing and deter American voters. 
For these reasons we urge a yes vote on the 
rule for the budget resolution, and for de-
mocracy and the John Lewis Voting Rights 
Advancement Act. 
Sincerely, 
DAN CHU, 
Acting Executive Director.
AFT, 
August 23, 2021. 
U.S. House of Representatives, 
Washington, DC. 
DEAR REPRESENTATIVE: On behalf of the 1.7 
million members of the American Federation 
of Teachers, I strongly urge you to support 
the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement 
Act (H.R. 4). The need to strengthen and re- 
establish the protections of the Voting 
Rights Act of 1965, the crowning achieve-
ment of the civil rights movement, is more 
pressing now than ever before. 
The late Rep. John Lewis once said, ‘‘The 
vote is precious. It is almost sacred. It is the 
most powerful non-violent tool we have in 
our democracy.’’ The bedrock of American 
democracy is participation at the ballot box 
for all, no matter their religion, their race, 
their income, their gender, their age, where 
they come from, what state they reside in or 
their ZIP code. Everything relies on voting 
rights, from the ability of local communities 
to run their schools and manage local serv-
ices to the peaceful transfer of presidential 
power. 
In the wake of two U.S. Supreme Court de-
cisions—Shelby 
County 
v. 
Holder 
and 
Brnovich v. Democratic National Committee 
that gutted the Voting Rights Act, states 
have considered and enacted a rush of new 
laws making the right to vote harder to ex-
ercise, especially for communities of color. 
According to the Brennan Center for Justice, 
more than 400 voter suppression bills have 
been taken up by state legislatures since 
January of this year, and 18 states have al-
ready enacted 30 laws restricting the right to 
vote. Recent voter suppression measures em-
brace a variety of tactics including reducing 
early voting, eliminating polling places, giv-
ing local judges the ability to overturn elec-
tions, and making it a crime to deliver water 
or food to voters standing in line. While com-
panion legislation with comprehensive na-
tional voting standards and reforms, such as 
the For the People Act, is needed to address 
the state laws already enacted, passing the 
John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act 
is essential to prevent new state voter sup-
pression measures from being enacted. 
The latest actions of state legislatures 
show that the protections of the Voting 
Rights Act are still woefully needed. They 
prove that the late Supreme Court Justice 
Ruth Bader Ginsburg was right in her Shelby 
County dissent when she wrote that to use 
the success of the Voting Rights Act as proof 
that it is unneeded is as wise as not using an 
umbrella in a storm because you don’t feel 
the rain. Most of the states that have re-
cently enacted, or are currently debating, 
laws restricting the right to vote have a his-
tory of having their efforts blocked when the 
Voting Rights Act’s preclearance require-
ments were in full effect. H.R. 4 would estab-
lish new preclearance formulas that would 
prevent states with a history of voter dis-
crimination from enacting new laws that 
would suppress the vote. It would also ensure 
that last-minute voting changes do not ad-
versely affect voters by requiring officials to 
publicly announce all voting changes at least 
180 days before an election, and it would ex-
pand the government’s authority to send fed-
eral observers to any jurisdiction where 
there may be a substantial risk of discrimi-
nation at the polls on Election Day or during 
an early voting period. 
John Lewis reminded us, ‘‘Each of us has a 
moral obligation to stand up, speak up and 
speak out. When you see something that is 
not right, you must say something. You 
must do something.’’ This is your chance. 
We urge you to defend voting rights 
throughout the country by supporting the 
John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act 
and renewing the fight for the comprehen-
sive voting rights legislation that must ac-
company it. 
Thank you for considering our views on 
this critical legislation. 
Sincerely, 
RANDI WEINGARTEN, 
President. 
SEIU, 
August 20, 2021. 
DEAR REPRESENTATIVE: On behalf of the 2 
million members of the Service Employees 
International Union (SEIU), I write in sup-
port of the Infrastructure Investment and 
Jobs Act (IIJA) as well as the Federal Fiscal 
Year 2022 Budget Resolution, and the John 
R. Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act. 
Taken together, these critical bills will help 
strengthen our democracy and deliver on the 
full promise of President Biden’s Build Back 
Better agenda. 
After years of inaction, the IIJA advances 
important programs in public transpor-
tation, clean water, broadband and climate 
resilience. These public investments would 
give our communities a much-needed boost 
and help support safer roadways and schools, 
cleaner water, and more available and af-
fordable Internet. But much more has to be 
done to build our country back better and 
ensure that workers have unions and a voice 
in their own futures. 
By advancing the infrastructure bill along 
with the Build Back Better reconciliation 
package, with its commitments to living- 
wage care jobs with the opportunity to join 
together in a union—a path to citizenship 
and climate justice, Congress can take bold 
measures needed to meet essential workers’ 
demands 
for 
common-sense 
and 
trans-
formative policy solutions. 
The budget resolution is the key to cre-
ating the pathway we need for both the IIJA 
and the reconciliation bill. We call on you to 
act immediately to pass the FY 2022 budget 
resolution to move forward on President 
Biden’s Build Back Better full vision. In ad-
dition, we strongly urge you to support the 
John R. Lewis Voting Rights Advancement 
Act. This crucial legislation will help pro-
tect our democracy against the widespread 
attacks on our freedom to vote that are 
being mounted across our country—so that 
we all have an equal say in our future and 
our rights are protected. 
For these reasons, we urge you to support 
the IIJA, the FY2022 budget resolution, and 
the John R. Lewis Voting Rights Advance-
ment Act. We will add votes on each of these 
bills to our legislative scorecard for the 117th 
Congress. 
Sincerely, 
MARY KAY HENRY, 
International President. 
LIUNA!, 
August 23, 2021. 
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, 
Washington, DC. 
DEAR REPRESENTATIVE: On behalf of the 
500,000 members of the Laborers’ Inter-
national Union of North America (LIUNA), I 
want to express our strong support for H.R. 
4, the John R. Lewis Voting Rights Advance-
ment Act of 2021. 
Since the 2013 Supreme Court Shelby Coun-
ty v. Holder decision, which challenged por-
tions of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, many 
states have enacted laws that restrict access 
to the polls by shortening early voting 
hours, enacting strict voter ID requirements, 
and decreasing the number of polling loca-
tions. 
These 
changes 
to 
the 
law 
disproportionally 
effect 
minority 
and 
disenfranchised 
communities. 
Just 
last 
month, in Brnovich v. Democratic National 
Committee, the Supreme Court decided that 
rules that impacted different populations un-
equally were not unfair. This decision opened 
the door even more broadly to different 
forms of voter suppression. 
H.R. 4 is critically needed to help to re-
verse the negative effects of these restrictive 
state laws by requiring states and localities 
with a history of voting rights violations to 
pre-clear any changes to election laws with 
the Department of Justice. This important 
legislation will ensure that elections across 
this country remain fair and will restore the 
portions of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 
that recent Supreme Court decisions have 
eliminated. In addition, this legislation will 
ensure that multilingual voting materials 
are more widely available and that polling 
places do not disproportionally serve privi-
leged communities over communities of 
color. 
For decades LIUNA has stood side by side 
with civil rights activists, including the late 
Congressman John Lewis, as they marched 
and took to the streets to fight for the crit-
ical issue of voting rights—one of the corner-
stones of our democracy. LIUNA will con-
tinue to speak out against discriminatory 
laws and practices that attempt to dis-
enfranchise voters. Ensuring all Americans 
have equal access to their constitutionally 
enshrined right to vote is a top priority. 
LIUNA supports H.R. 4, the John R. Lewis 
Voting Rights Advancement Act of 2021, 
which passed the U.S. House of Representa-
tives with a bipartisan vote in the last Con-
gress and urges you to vote for this much- 
needed legislation. 
With kind regards, I am 
Sincerely yours, 
TERRY O’SULLIVAN, 
General President.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4407 
August 24, 2021 
Rights Advancement Act of 2021 (H.R. 4) be-
cause it will protect our most fundamental 
right as citizens and safeguard the integrity 
of our democracy. Votes on this issue may be 
included in NEA’s Report Card for the 117th 
Congress. 
NEA members help prepare students for 
the privileges and responsibilities of citizen-
ship. They want students to understand how 
our government works and their role in mak-
ing it work—especially through voting. Yet, 
accessing the vote has become more difficult 
in recent years, particularly for African 
Americans and other people of color, people 
with disabilities, students, and senior citi-
zens. In fact, from January through mid- 
July of this year, nearly 400 bills were intro-
duced in 49 states that would make voting 
more difficult, according to the Brennan 
Center for Justice. At least 18 of those states 
have enacted 30 new laws that restrict our 
freedom to vote. 
The U.S. Supreme Court in the 2013 Shelby 
v. Holder decision invalidated a crucial pro-
vision in the Voting Rights Act of 1965 (VRA) 
that prevented states with a history of dis-
criminating against voters from changing 
their voting laws and practices without 
preclearance by federal officials. This federal 
review was an important feature of the Vot-
ing Rights Act; doing away with it has vir-
tually annulled the federal oversight that 
was—and remains—crucial to ensuring that 
millions of people have equal access to the 
ballot box. Since the Shelby decision, several 
states have changed their voting practices in 
ways that have created barriers for people of 
color, low-income people, transgender peo-
ple, college students, the elderly, and those 
with disabilities. 
Furthermore, just last month, the Su-
preme Court ruled in Brnovich v. Democratic 
National Committee that two discriminatory 
Arizona voting laws did not violate Section 2 
of the Voting Rights Act. In its opinion in 
Brnovich, the Court disregards the congres-
sional purpose of Section 2, which is to pro-
vide a powerful means to combat race dis-
crimination in voting and representation. 
The decision relies on a limited interpreta-
tion of the Voting Rights Act that will make 
it more difficult to challenge discriminatory 
voting laws. This decision underscores the 
need for Congress to pass the John Lewis 
Voting Rights Advancement Act to restore 
the legislative purpose of Section 2. 
The John Lewis Voting Rights Advance-
ment Act fills a distinct and critical role in 
protecting the freedom to vote and ensuring 
elections are safe and accessible by reversing 
these dangerous, undemocratic trends by 
taking several steps that include: 
Updating the criteria used for identifying 
states and political subdivisions required to 
obtain federal review and approval of voting 
changes to ensure those changes do not in-
fringe upon the freedom to vote for people of 
color; 
Requiring that every state and locality na-
tionwide that is sufficiently diverse obtain 
federal review before enacting specific types 
of voting changes that are known to be dis-
criminatory in their use to silence the grow-
ing political power of voters of color; 
Requiring all states and localities to pub-
licly disclose, 180 days before an election, all 
voting changes, such as reductions in lan-
guage assistance and changes in require-
ments to vote or register; 
Authorizing the Attorney General to send 
federal observers to any jurisdiction where 
there is a substantial risk of racial discrimi-
nation at the polls; 
Addressing the Brnovich decision by clari-
fying factors that voters of color can use to 
prove a vote dilution or vote denial claim 
under Section 2 of the VRA and restoring 
voters’ full ability to challenge racial dis-
crimination in voting in court; 
Allowing the Department of Justice and 
voters of color to challenge changes in a vot-
ing rule that would make voters of color 
worse off in terms of their voting rights than 
the status quo; 
Expanding authority for courts to ‘‘bail- 
in’’ jurisdictions to the preclearance process 
and updating the ability of jurisdictions to 
‘‘bail-out’’ of the preclearance process once 
they demonstrate a record of not harming 
voters of color; and 
Providing voters with additional protec-
tion by easing the standard for when courts 
can temporarily block certain types of vot-
ing changes while the change is under review 
in court. This is important because once a 
voter is discriminated against in an election, 
it cannot be undone. 
NEA members live, work, and vote in every 
precinct, county, and congressional district 
in the United States. They take their obliga-
tion to vote seriously, viewing it as essential 
to protecting the opportunities that they be-
lieve all students should have. Educators 
teach students that voting is a responsibility 
of citizenship, a privilege people have died to 
protect, and a right we must dedicate our-
selves to upholding. We urge you to vote 
YES on the John Lewis Voting Rights Ad-
vancement Act so that all may participate in 
the electoral process and have a voice in our 
democracy.

Hon. TERRI SEWELL, 
Washington, DC. 
DEAR REPRESENTATIVE SEWELL: AARP, on 
behalf of our nearly 38 million members and 
all older Americans, is proud to support H.R. 
4, the John R. Lewis Voting Rights Advance-
ment Act of 2021. The right to vote is the 
most fundamental of all political rights, and 
all Americans must be able to exercise their 
vote freely, easily, and safely. 
The Voting Rights Act of 1965 (VRA) has 
been our nation’s preeminent law protecting 
the voting rights of all Americans. But re-
cent Supreme Court decisions have weak-
ened several provisions of the law. H.R. 4 
would help restore the law and ensure the 
protections contained in the 14th and 15th 
Amendments to the Constitution are en-
forced, by: 
Creating a new coverage formula for all 
states and political subdivisions that takes 
into consideration repeated voting rights 
violations in the preceding 25 years; 
Establishing a process for reviewing voting 
changes, focusing on measures that have his-
torically been used to discriminate, includ-
ing voter ID laws, the reduction of multi-
lingual voting materials, changes to voting 
districts, and reductions in the number of 
polling locations; 
Increasing transparency through public no-
tice when voting changes are made; Expand-
ing voting accessibility for Native American 
and Alaska Native voters; Allowing the At-
torney General authority to request federal 
observers where there is a threat of racial 
discrimination in voting; 
Allowing a federal court to order states or 
jurisdictions to be covered for results-based 
violations, 
Clarifying that a voting change or practice 
is discriminatory even if other forms of vot-
ing are available to a protected class and; 
Directing the Judicial Branch to discount 
a state or locality’s claims of fraud as a rea-
son to pass harmful voting laws if no evi-
dence is presented of such fraud. 
AARP looks forward to working with Con-
gress and the Administration to ensure every 
citizen’s right to vote. 
Sincerely, 
NANCY A. LEAMOND, 
Executive Vice Presi-
dent and Chief Ad-
vocacy & Engage-

AMERICAN PUBLIC HEALTH, 
ASSOCIATION, 
August 23, 2021. 
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, 
Washington, DC. 
DEAR REPRESENTATIVE: On behalf of the 
American Public Health Association, a di-
verse community of public health profes-
sionals that champions the health of all peo-
ple and communities, I write in strong sup-
port of H.R. 4, the John R. Lewis Voting 
Rights Advancement Act of 2021. 
Over the past decade, U.S. Supreme Court 
decisions such as Shelby County v. Holder 
and Brnovich v. Democratic National Com-
mittee have unfortunately eroded key pro-
tections provided by the Voting Rights Act 
that protect against racial discrimination in 
the voting process, giving many states the 
ability to suppress and discriminate against 
voters. This year alone, state lawmakers 
have introduced 400 bills and enacted 30 laws 
restricting access to voting in 48 states. The 
John R. Lewis Voting Rights Advancement 
Act of 2021 would restore VRA protections by 
establishing a federal review process of 
changes to state voting laws. Potentially 
discriminatory changes would be paused 
until 
federal 
review 
is 
completed, 
and 
changes found to be discriminatory would be 
blocked entirely. Furthermore, strict over-
sight would be applied to states with his-
tories of voter discrimination and policy 
changes known to be used to discriminate 
against voters of color. 
Decades ago, the Institute of Medicine es-
tablished in a report that voting is a public 
health issue because it helps shape ‘‘the con-
ditions in which people can be healthy.’’ The 
ballot box is where community members can 
come together to decide on key issues that 
shape our response to today’s public health 
emergencies: police brutality, gun violence, 
climate change and the ongoing COVID–19 
pandemic. 
We 
commend 
Congresswoman 
TERRI SEWELL and the other sponsors for in-
troducing this landmark legislation and the 
House for bringing it up for a vote. I write in 
strong support of H.R. 4 and urge you to vote 
yes on the bill. The provisions in this bill 
would support the advancement of racial and 
health equity, a key APHA priority and a 
crucial step toward achieving the healthiest 
nation in one generation. 
Sincerely, 
GEORGES C. BENJAMIN, MD, 
Executive Director. 
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Madam 
Speaker, I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentleman from 
Maryland (Mr. HOYER), the distin-
guished majority leader of the House. 
Mr. HOYER. Madam Speaker, how 
pleased our friend would be that 
NIKEMA WILLIAMS is presiding, his suc-
cessor. He was one of her mentors. 
Madam Speaker, how proud you must 
be to preside at this critical time in 
our history. 
Madam Speaker, I thank the gentle-
woman from Selma, Alabama, TERRI 
SEWELL. I have been with Terri and her 
church, worshipped with her, prayed

H4408 
August 24, 2021 
with John Lewis in her church, walked 
down the streets of her town and over 
a bridge called the Edmund Pettus 
Bridge. And unlike John Lewis, when 
we walked across it, there were Ala-
bama troopers to protect us rather 
than prevent us from voting. 
Madam Speaker, I have heard a lot of 
discussion on the floor today about 
how there is no problem in America; 
people have full access. Too many peo-
ple that I talk to throughout the coun-
try have told me that is not the case. 
The Supreme Court passed a ruling 
and said, Oh, everything was fine. And 
as soon as they did, as soon as they 
took this preclearance off, State after 
State after State enacted legislation to 
make it more difficult to vote; like 
that. 
Justice Ginsburg made an analogy in 
Shelby that the Supreme Court was 
saying, Oh, well, there is no problem 
left. She said it was like the man with 
the umbrella who had the umbrella up; 
wasn’t getting wet. It was raining, but 
he wasn’t getting wet. So he gave the 
umbrella away and said, I’m okay. I am 
dry. And then immediately, of course, 
he got all wet. 
Madam Speaker, I am proud to join 
my sister, TERRI SEWELL; John’s sister. 
John called me brother, and he called 
all of us brothers and sisters, in this, 
the beloved community that he envi-
sioned. That was King’s vision, as John 
was his disciple. 
Today, we are honoring the legacy of 
a historic Member of this House. In my 
view, I have served with two historic 
Members of the Congress of the United 
States and the Senate and the House. 
There were a lot of famous, but two 
historic figures: One was John Lewis. 
And the other is NANCY PELOSI, the 
first woman Speaker and, in my view, 
the most effective Speaker with whom 
I have served in the 40 years that I 
have been here. 
John Lewis was my dear friend, and 
he was your dear friend. I called him 
the most Christlike person I have ever 
seen, 
our 
dear 
Saint 
John, 
who 
preached to us the gospel of getting 
into ‘‘good trouble’’ and creating a be-
loved community; the gospel of John 
Robert Lewis. 
He would be proud of us today for 
bringing this bill to the floor. He 
worked hard on this bill. I can remem-
ber sitting— JIM CLYBURN and I, and 
John Lewis and others—sitting in my 
whip’s conference room, working on 
voting rights’ legislation. 
So let us honor his memory today 
with strong support for its voting 
rights’ protection, for its reversal of 
the damage wrought by the 2013 Shelby 
v. Holder ruling, and for its recognition 
that our democracy is imperfect if it is 
not open to all eligible to vote. 
In that ruling, Shelby v. Holder, the 
Supreme Court erred in its assessment 
of how necessary the Voting Rights 
Act’s preclearance section was for pro-
tecting Americans’ right to vote. You 
are not protecting Americans’ right to 
vote if the relief that you can seek is 
after the fact, after the governor or the 
President or the Senator or the House 
of Delegates or representative, Member 
has been elected. It is too late. That is 
why preclearance was so critically im-
portant to reform and to protection of 
voters’ rights. 
In her powerful dissent, as I said, 
Justice Ginsburg pointed out that 
throwing out preclearance when it has 
worked and has continued to work to 
stop discriminatory changes is like 
that gentleman giving away his um-
brella. 
Indeed, since 2013, we have seen a 
veritable downpour of discriminatory 
and 
exclusionary 
voter 
suppression 
measures. I hear people arguing—I 
heard a Texan argue on this floor about 
how it is so easy to vote in Texas. Yet, 
we see them fighting for legislation, 
which half of their body—or not quite 
half, unfortunately—but a big number 
of their body who represents minority 
citizens says, No, you are wrong. You 
ought to walk in our shoes and find 
that they are making it more difficult 
for me to vote. 
Since 2013, we have seen a veritable 
downpour, as I said. The John R. Lewis 
Voting Rights Advancement Act, spon-
sored by TERRI SEWELL, would confront 
this tempest head on. We have seen a 
campaign of voter suppression efforts 
in Republican-led jurisdictions that 
have changed their laws and voting 
rules to make it harder for eligible 
Americans to vote. 
Their leader, Donald Trump, says 
there was fraud, there was theft. The 
problem is the Republican judges to 
which they appealed said no. The prob-
lem is Attorney General Barr, who cov-
ered up almost everything that Donald 
Trump said, even he couldn’t say that 
there was fraud. 
b 1715 
And so they justify these laws by 
somehow there is fraud out there, they 
are stealing our elections. That is balo-
ney. It is the same kind of lie that 
Donald Trump continues to parrot. 
And if you say, like LIZ CHENEY did, he 
is lying, you are kicked out of your 
party. 
We have seen a campaign of voter 
suppression over and over and over 
again, making it harder for eligible 
Americans to vote, disproportionately 
targeting African Americans. I am not 
an African American. It is hard for me 
to walk in those shoes. 
I try to empathize, but I know if I am 
not Black, I can’t really be as knowl-
edgeable as I would be if I were Black, 
and I was every day subjected to dis-
crimination, or if I were another per-
son of color. 
They have reduced early voting op-
portunities that help working people 
cast ballots. They want to eliminate— 
they haven’t in every place—mail bal-
loting, because they feel somehow if I 
don’t see them when they fill out that 
form and attest that they are who they 
are under penalties of perjury that 
somehow—— 
Now, I can understand, from a party 
that in the last seven elections, in the 
last quarter of a century, have elected 
a number of Presidents, only one got a 
majority; only one, but they won the 
electoral college vote. That is why 
some Republicans said: Are you crazy? 
You confirm the electoral college, be-
cause it is what is protecting us 
against the majority. 
They purged voter rolls so that peo-
ple who believed themselves to be reg-
istered because they had registered and 
voted in the past, showed up to vote 
but were turned away. 
I sponsored the Help America Vote 
Act with a guy named Bob Ney, who 
was from Ohio and a Republican, and a 
dear friend of mine. Unfortunately, he 
got in trouble, but he is a good man, 
still a good man. And we provided for 
provisional ballots, which simply said, 
if you made a mistake and came to the 
wrong precinct, fill out the ballot, we 
are going to check it tomorrow or the 
next day and make sure you are eligi-
ble to vote, and if you are, we will 
count it. That made sense; efforts to 
eliminate those. 
These are real and pressing chal-
lenges facing our elections and our de-
mocracy; not imaginary fraud, but ac-
tive and visible voter suppression. We 
have a duty, my colleagues, Democrat 
and Republican colleagues, we have a 
duty, a responsibility, a moral respon-
sibility to make sure that people can 
vote and that we facilitate their vote, 
not impede it. Not make it more dif-
ficult. Facilitate it. Encourage them. 
Lift them up and let them vote. 
And we owe it to John Lewis and the 
other heroes of Selma, and all the 
other small towns and byways and big 
cities and big States, where people 
fought, demonstrated, were bruised, 
battered, beaten, and yes, some died, so 
that their brothers and sisters could 
have the vote. 
My colleagues, it falls to us now, 
today, to continue their march for-
ward, and to carry on their work. 
There are no Alabama troopers waiting 
on the other side that are going to beat 
us or batter us or prevent us. We are 
not at risk. Whatever way we vote, we 
are going to walk out of there today 
and we are going to be fine. 
But we have a moral responsibility to 
those who fought here and around the 
world to protect the vote, to protect 
democracy. 
I urge my colleagues, Madam Speak-
er, to join you, to join me, to join our 
fellow colleagues in voting for H.R. 4, 
and for the protection of voting rights 
in our country. H.R. 4 the people. 
PARLIAMENTARY INQUIRY 
Mr. BUCK. Madam Speaker, I have a

Mr. BUCK. Madam Speaker, my in-
quiry is, if it is appropriate to call the 
previous President a liar, is it appro-
priate that we can refer to the current 
President as a liar also?

The SPEAKER pro tempore. As re-
corded in section 370 of the House 
Rules and Manual, the prohibition 
against engaging in personalities does 
not apply to former Presidents. 
Mr. BUCK. Does not apply to past 
Presidents? 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. That is 
correct. 
Mr. BUCK. Understood. I thank the 
Speaker. 
PARLIAMENTARY INQUIRY 
Mr. HOYER. Madam Speaker, par-
liamentary inquiry. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman will state his parliamentary in-
quiry. 
Mr. HOYER. Madam Speaker, is it 
appropriate on the floor of the House 
to tell the truth? 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman is not stating a proper par-
liamentary inquiry. 
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Madam 
Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gen-
tleman from California (Mr. LAMALFA). 
Mr. LAMALFA. Madam Speaker, it is 
interesting when President Trump was 
in office that the name-calling in this 
place about him occurred often during 
the President’s time in office. 
In California, we currently have a 
special election about to be underway 
here. Just the other day, 300 mail-in 
ballots were found in the car of a guy 
passed out in a 7–Eleven parking lot, 
300 ballots. And we don’t think there is 
an issue sometimes with the way mail- 
in ballots are distributed. 
I get anecdotes all the time from 
folks like this current special election. 
Oh, I received three ballots for people 
that haven’t lived at my apartment for 
a long time, or relatives that have long 
since passed away, because you just 
mail them out willy-nilly everywhere. 
H.R. 4 is not about voting rights, it is 
about election control and manipula-
tion. It is about political appointees at 
the Department of Justice overturning 
State and legislative process, and con-
trolling from D.C. local election deci-
sions. 
We know that Americans of the right 
age and legal status have the right to 
vote, and no one here is trying to take 
that away from them. Voter suppres-
sion hype is just a big lie. It is absurd 
what is trying to be perpetrated in this 
legislation. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the distinguished 
gentleman from New York (Mr. JONES). 
Mr. JONES. Madam Speaker, 8 years 
ago the Supreme Court demolished the 
Voting Rights Act, in the deluded, dan-
gerous belief that we had somehow 
overcome white supremacy and no 
longer needed the greatest achieve-
ment of the Civil Rights Movement. 
The next day, States began making it 
harder for Black and Brown Americans 
to vote, initiating the biggest wave of 
racist voter suppression since Jim 
Crow. But today, we act to restore the 
Voting Rights Act. We also act to re-
verse the Supreme Court’s recent as-
sault on the right to vote by passing 
my bill with Representative RUBEN 
GALLEGO, the Inclusive Elections Act, 
which is part of this package. 
Having said that, let us be clear-eyed 
about how we got here and the threat 
that remains. The John R. Lewis Vot-
ing Rights Act will not be safe so long 
as six far-right justices of the Supreme 
Court stand ready to destroy our de-
mocracy. 
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Madam 
Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gen-
tleman from Wisconsin (Mr. FITZ-
GERALD). 
Mr. FITZGERALD. Madam Speaker, 
I want to just remind everybody, no 
matter what side of the bill you are on, 
there is a huge trust issue going on in 
America right now. People do not trust 
the system, and that is everyone’s 
problem. If you think a centralized 
election bill to move the power to 
Washington, D.C., and put it in the 
hands of Congress and the courts is 
going to help, you are wrong. They 
don’t trust us and they don’t trust the 
courts. 
A decentralized system is what has 
worked in America. So make sure that 
after you support this legislation, you 
go back and you meet with the town 
clerk that runs the elections, the coun-
ty clerks, the parish clerks, the munic-
ipal clerks, and yes, the State legisla-
tures. I notice the State legislatures 
are taking a real beating here today. 
Pre-clearance expansion. Is that a 
can of worms that this body really 
wants to open up? Printed ballots. 
Photo ID. Now we are going to man-
date polling places, election timelines, 
primary mechanics, who can be a poll 
worker. These are all things that are 
included in H.R. 4. I just want to make 
sure the public is aware of that. 
We are now taking the power away 
from the people and placing it right 
here in Washington, D.C., in Congress 
and in the courts exclusively. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the distinguished 
gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. 
BUTTERFIELD). 
Mr. BUTTERFIELD. Madam Speak-
er, for years I have said that the 1965 
Voting Rights Act was written between 
Selma and Montgomery. The Voting 
Rights Act leveled the playing field 
and transformed southern electoral 
politics. 
Since the Shelby decision, the right 
to vote and access to the ballot box are 
being compromised. The Subcommittee 
on Elections, which I chair, held five 
hearings, we called over 35 witnesses, 
produced a report detailing clear evi-
dence of ongoing voter discrimination 
all across the country. 
I thank Chairman NADLER, Chairman 
COHEN, and Ms. SEWELL for a good bill. 
The Voting Rights Act is as important 
today as ever. Passage of H.R. 4 will 
protect the right to vote and fully en-
force the 15th Amendment. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to vote ‘‘yes.’’ 
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Madam 
Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gen-
tleman 
from 
North 
Carolina 
(Mr. 
BISHOP). 
Mr. 
BISHOP 
of 
North 
Carolina. 
Madam Speaker, to come to the cor-
rect conclusion, a law professor used to 
say, ‘‘You’ve got to know the facts.’’ 
And that is what the American people 
need here: the facts, not emotion. 
This 
bill 
would 
comprehensively 
transfer the power to govern elections 
in this country from the sovereign 
States to the Federal Government per-
manently and everywhere. 
So what is the factual premise for so 
fundamentally 
concentrating 
the 
power here in Washington and dimin-
ishing the States? What has happened 
to justify making pervasive and perma-
nent what Chief Justice Roberts ex-
plained was ‘‘a drastic departure from 
basic principles of freedom’’ when it 
was necessarily undertaken in the 
1960s, temporarily and in limited parts 
of the country? 
Well, Democrats offer lurid claims, 
but the American people are catching 
on. Like earlier this year, Stacey 
Abrams claimed that a simple voter ID 
law would be Jim Crow 2.0, but once 
the absurdity of that caught up to her, 
she looked so ridiculous that she tried 
to deny ever having claimed it. 
Nothing epitomizes this better than 
the slur repeated in the Rules Com-
mittee yesterday by my law school 
classmate 
and 
colleague, 
Congress-
woman 
ROSS. 
She 
quoted 
three 
ultraliberal judges in the Fourth Cir-
cuit who said that when the North 
Carolina legislature enacted voter ID 
and other reforms in 2013, it ‘‘targeted 
African Americans with almost sur-
gical precision.’’ 
Activists and media have quoted that 
phrase over 7,500 times, according to 
Google. But few know that the three 
judges who stated that finding of fact 
were appellate judges who were sup-
posed to be bound by the trial judge’s 
finding of fact; or that the trial judge 
found in a painstaking 400-page anal-
ysis that the legislature’s bill was not 
discriminatory. So the three appellate 
judges abused their power. 
Few know how the three liberal ap-
pellate judges became the final word, 
that a Democrat State Attorney Gen-
eral 
intentionally 
sabotaged 
the 
State’s appeal to prevent an upcoming 
review by the Supreme Court. That AG 
abused his power. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentleman has expired. 
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. I yield 
an additional 30 seconds to the gen-
tleman from North Carolina. 
Mr. 
BISHOP 
of 
North 
Carolina. 
Madam Speaker, when the details are 
known, the absence of factual basis be-
comes plain. Nobody is getting wet. A 
University 
of 
Oregon 
economist 
showed, just in February, that the 
Shelby County decision to which this 
bill purports to respond, has not im-
paired Black voter turnout at all. 
There is no Jim Crow 2.0. This bill is 
about abuse of power. 
Democrats wish to entrench them-
selves in power and to use the Federal

Government to obliterate the States in 
order to achieve it. You have to know 
the facts. 
b 1730 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 45 seconds to the distinguished 
gentleman from Rhode Island (Mr. 
LANGEVIN). 
Mr. LANGEVIN. Madam Speaker, I 
rise in strong support of the John R. 
Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act. 
As Rhode Island’s former secretary of 
state, I know the importance of access 
to the ballot box. 
That is why I was devastated when 
the Supreme Court gutted one of our 
most momentous civil rights bills, 
opening the door to a litany of voter 
suppression laws. 
Our dearly departed John Lewis was 
bloodied on the bridge at Selma while 
peacefully urging passage of the Voting 
Rights Act of 1965. The scars he carried 
were not in vain, as decades of progress 
have shown us. But it is abundantly 
clear that we have not yet achieved 
equality of access. There are forces at 
work in this country trying to undo 
what we have so painstakingly earned. 
That is why it is so important that 
we pass this bill to restore the Voting 
Rights Act and ensure that every 
American, regardless of race, can have 
his or her voice heard in our democ-
racy. 
Let’s vote in favor of this bill and 
send a clear message that we want to 
protect every vote in America. 
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Madam 
Speaker, I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the distinguished 
gentlewoman from Ohio (Mrs. BEATTY). 
Mrs. BEATTY. Madam Speaker, I am 
not sure what John Lewis my Repub-
lican colleagues are talking about 
when they say he was their friend and 
what he would have wanted. He helped 
write this bill. 
Let me just say that, on behalf of 
millions of Black voters who stood in 
lines across this country, including in 
my home State of Ohio, and leaders 
like our beloved John Lewis, who 
risked his life as he crossed the Ed-
mund Pettus Bridge, I rise in strong 
support of H.R. 4, the John R. Lewis 
Voting Rights Advancement Act of 
2021. 
On behalf of the Congressional Black 
Caucus, we say we step into history 
today as we tread the same path when, 
56 years ago, President Johnson signed 
the Voting Rights Act into law calling 
the day ‘‘a triumph for freedom as huge 
as any victory won on any battlefield.’’ 
So to all of my colleagues, I say: Sup-
port this bill. Our power, our message, 
the Congressional Black Caucus. 
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Madam 
Speaker, I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 45 seconds to the distinguished 
gentlewoman 
from 
Georgia 
(Ms. 
BOURDEAUX). 
Ms. BOURDEAUX. Madam Speaker, 
Georgia was one of the first States in 
the country to pass a voter suppression 
bill after the 2020 general election, but 
S.B. 202 is just our State’s latest at-
tempt to disenfranchise minority com-
munities. 
Georgia has a long history of under-
mining the right to vote, from the Jim 
Crow era to recent tactics like voter 
roll purges and exact match policies. 
It is time for Congress to fix what 
the Supreme Court broke in their 2013 
ruling, which effectively gutted the 
Voting Rights Act. 
When I came to Congress, I vowed to 
support the John R. Lewis Voting 
Rights Advancement Act, and I am 
proud to keep that commitment today. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to support H.R. 4 and protect 
the sacred right to vote. 
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Madam 
Speaker, I yield 11⁄2 minutes to the gen-
tleman from Colorado (Mr. BUCK). 
Mr. BUCK. Madam Speaker, I appre-
ciate the gentleman yielding. 
Madam Speaker, we have weak lead-
ership now and a crisis in Afghanistan. 
We have a crisis at our border because 
of weak leadership. We have an infla-
tion crisis because of weak leadership. 
And we have a crime issue in our cities 
as a result of weak leadership. 
Now, we debate preclearance require-
ments that are unnecessary and uncon-
stitutional. We hear that they are nec-
essary because of voter ID laws. 
It takes identification to buy liquor 
in this country, to buy marijuana in 
this country, and to drive a car in this 
country. To enter this building, it 
takes identification. 
Yet, it is such a burden that we need 
to have preclearance with the Depart-
ment of Justice because of that heavy 
burden that is being placed on citizens, 
preclearance from an administration 
that 
has 
screwed 
up 
Afghanistan, 
screwed up the border, screwed up in-
flation. We are supposed to go to them 
and ask them for permission because 
voter ID is such a burden. 
If there weren’t people streaming 
across this border who could poten-
tially vote, we wouldn’t be asking for 
voter ID laws across this country, but 
we are. 
Madam Speaker, you can’t screw 
things up on the one hand and, on the 
other 
hand, 
try 
to 
require 
preclearance. 
It is wrong, and I ask my colleagues 
to vote ‘‘no.’’ 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 45 seconds to the distinguished 
gentlewoman 
from 
Florida 
(Ms. 
WASSERMAN SCHULTZ). 
Ms. 
WASSERMAN 
SCHULTZ. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in strong sup-
port of H.R. 4, critical legislation that 
confronts the crisis facing our democ-
racy. 
In Florida, we witnessed a Repub-
lican legislature attempting to cling to 
power through voter suppression, tak-
ing special aim at Black and Brown 
voices. The blatantly antidemocratic 
legislation 
signed 
by 
Governor 
DeSantis this year makes voter reg-
istration harder, limits voting by mail, 
and curbs the use of secure ballot drop 
boxes. Similar suppression tactics took 
root across the Nation, with at least 18 
States making it harder to vote this 
year. 
To honor our dear friend and col-
league, Congressman Lewis, we must 
stand up to this assault on our con-
stitutional rights. This bill would stop 
those who want to shape the electorate 
to help them win elections because 
they can’t win on their losing agenda. 
At this moment in history, bold ac-
tion is necessary to protect the right 
to vote. After we pass this bill, we 
must ensure it moves through the Sen-
ate. Our very democracy depends on it. 
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Madam 
Speaker, I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 45 seconds to the distinguished 
gentleman 
from 
Arizona 
(Mr. 
GALLEGO). 
Mr. GALLEGO. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today in support of the John R. 
Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act. 
It is because of the courage and sac-
rifices of civil rights leaders like Con-
gressman John Lewis that we were able 
to pass the Voting Rights Act of 1965. 
But for over a decade, we have wit-
nessed a new era of voter suppression 
and Jim Crow laws pursued by Repub-
lican State legislatures, including in 
my State of Arizona. 
These attacks on our right to vote 
are nothing new. For too long, Black, 
Latino, and Native American voters 
have overcome incredible barriers to 
cast their votes. 
That is not how American democracy 
should work. That is why Representa-
tive MONDAIRE JONES and I were proud 
to add a provision to this bill today 
that bans discriminatory voting laws 
that harm voters of color. 
I strongly urge my colleagues to pass 
this bill and this provision with it. 
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Madam 
Speaker, I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 45 seconds to the distinguished 
gentleman from Illinois (Mr. QUIGLEY). 
Mr. QUIGLEY. Madam Speaker, 66 
years ago this week, Emmett Till was 
brutally lynched by two white su-
premacists. 
When his body was returned to his 
mother, Mamie Till, in Chicago, she 
held an open casket funeral because, in 
her words: ‘‘I wanted the world to see 
what they did to my baby.’’ 
This was a galvanizing moment for 
the civil rights movement, but it was 
not the end of Mamie Till-Mobley’s ac-
tivism. She spent the rest of her life 
touring the country, speaking out 
about the injustice of her son’s murder 
and the vital importance of elimi-
nating 
racial 
discrimination, 
dis-
enfranchisement, and segregation.

She also spent 23 years teaching in 
the Chicago public school system, con-
tinuing to speak to students in the Chi-
cago area about civil rights as late as 
the year 2000. 
Today, we are witnessing the reemer-
gence of the kinds of voting discrimi-
nation that she spoke out against. We 
must pass the John R. Lewis Voting 
Rights Act for Mamie Till, for John 
Lewis, and for every hero who fought 
for civil rights. 
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Madam 
Speaker, I yield such time as he may 
consume to the gentleman from Illi-
nois (Mr. RODNEY DAVIS). 
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. 
Madam Speaker, I have a joint report 
from the Committee on House Admin-
istration and the Committee on the Ju-
diciary Republicans titled ‘‘An Unprec-
edented and Unconstitutional Power 
Grab: How Democrats are Abusing the 
Constitution to Nationalize Elections.’’ 
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Madam 
Speaker, I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 45 seconds to the distinguished 
gentlewoman from North Carolina (Ms. 
ADAMS). 
Ms. ADAMS. Madam Speaker, Con-
gressman John Lewis earned his rep-
utation as the conscience of this body 
because of his leadership during the 
long march for equal rights at the bal-
lot box. 
John and so many people of con-
science and courage were arrested, 
beaten, bruised, and even murdered. 
The memory of being denied the right 
to vote still dwells in the minds of 
countless Americans. Many of those 
minds, like John’s, survived crushing 
blows to the skull to earn that right. 
John fought and bled for voting 
rights. He led the charge for voting 
rights. He should be honored by passing 
this bill drafted in his name. 
We have had the promise of one man, 
one vote since the birth of this coun-
try, and we can’t backslide on this 
progress. 
The John R. Lewis Voting Rights Ad-
vancement Act will help us get to the 
promised land where every person has 
the right to vote. 
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Madam 
Speaker, I yield such time as he may 
consume to the gentleman from Illi-
nois (Mr. RODNEY DAVIS). 
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. 
Madam Speaker, I have the Census Bu-
reau report detailing record turnout in 
2020; the Election Integrity Network 
H.R. 4 fact sheet; the Honest Election 
Project analysis titled ‘‘H.R. 4 Legal 
and Constitutional Challenges’’; the

titled ‘‘D.C. Bureaucrats and Judges 
Will Steal the Pen in Drawing Voting

Government Accountability analysis 
titled ‘‘H.R. 4 Isn’t Voting Progress. It 
is a Power Grab.’’ 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 45 seconds to the distinguished 
gentleman from Texas (Mr. GREEN). 
Mr. GREEN of Texas. Madam Speak-
er, and still I rise to announce that I 
will not only vote for H.R. 4 but I will 
also vote for those who are making it 
possible and who have made it possible 
for me to vote for H.R. 4. 
I will vote for Medgar Evers, who was 
assassinated trying to secure the right 
to vote. 
I will vote for Schwerner and Good-
man, two Jews who died in Mississippi 
trying to secure the right to vote. 
I will vote for all of those who suf-
fered on the Edmund Pettus Bridge on 
Bloody Sunday to secure the right to 
vote. 
I will do so because although it was 
signed in ink by a courageous Presi-
dent, it was written in blood. 
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Madam

consume to the gentleman from Illi-
nois (RODNEY DAVIS). 
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. 
Madam Speaker, I have the following

Madam

I 
thank 
Congresswoman 
TERRI SEWELL, Speaker NANCY PELOSI, 
Whip CLYBURN, and so many Members 
for their leadership in keeping our eyes 
on the prize. 
Now, the Supreme Court gutted crit-
ical protections of the Voting Rights 
Act of 1965. Today, we are restoring 
that constitutional right that so many 
States are taking away from Black and 
Brown people, rural people, people of 
color—everyone. Sooner or later, it 
will be all of us who will be subject to 
these voter restrictions acts. 
So make no mistake, these are ef-
forts to turn the clock back to the days 
of Jim Crow. That is not something I 
am imagining. Madam Speaker, I viv-
idly remember, as one who was born 
and raised in El Paso, Texas. So I, too, 
salute our Texas legislators for their 
boldness in protecting the right to 
vote. 
H.R. 4 can restore these crucial pro-
tections that our beloved John Lewis 
and so many others fought for. John 
said that the right to vote is ‘‘precious, 
almost sacred.’’ In honor of his legacy 
as a paragon of democracy, let us vote 
to pass the John R. Lewis Voting 
Rights Advancement Act. 
I thank Congresswoman TERRI SE-
WELL, G. K. BUTTERFIELD, our Speaker, 
everyone who has brought this bill to 
the floor. 
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Madam 
Speaker, I reserve the balance of my

Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 45 seconds to the distinguished 
gentlewoman 
from 
Michigan 
(Mrs. 
LAWRENCE). 
Mrs. LAWRENCE. Madam Speaker, 
like in many States, Republicans in 
Michigan’s legislature have introduced 
legislation to suppress the right to 
vote. Make no mistake about it, the 
fundamental right to vote in this coun-
try is under assault. That is why my 
dear friend, John Lewis, once said: Vot-
ing is the most powerful, nonviolent 
tool we have in our democracy. 
Today, we fight back. Today, we have 
an opportunity to restore the power of 
the vote. I urge my colleagues to sup-
port the John R. Lewis Voting Rights 
Advancement Act. 
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Madam 
Speaker, I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 45 seconds to the gentlewoman 
from Illinois (Ms. SCHAKOWSKY). 
Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Madam Speaker, 
one of the greatest honors and privi-
leges of my life has been to serve with 
John Lewis whom I had the privilege of 
calling a precious friend. 
In August, 58 years ago, the young 
John Lewis led a march to Washington 
with Martin Luther King and on Au-
gust 16 of 1965, the momentous Voting 
Rights Act was signed into law, thanks 
to John Lewis. 
Today, on August 25, 2021, we are 
here to vote for the John R. Lewis Vot-
ing Rights Advancement Act. A bill 
that he almost gave his life to pass all 
of those years ago will now restore the 
power of the Voting Rights Act, the 
right to vote, in the new legislation 
named for our dear friend and the con-
science of this Congress. Let’s vote 
‘‘yes.’’ 
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Madam 
Speaker, I yield 11⁄2 minutes to the gen-
tleman from Texas (Mr. ARRINGTON). 
Mr. ARRINGTON. Madam Speaker, I 
thank my friend from Louisiana for 
yielding. 
Madam Speaker, COVID was the ex-
cuse to bail out blue States poorly 
managed and union pensions poorly 
managed. Our current recession has 
been the excuse to pay people more to 
be on unemployment than to be at 
work or to permanently expand the so-
cial welfare programs that were sup-
posed to be temporary and targeted. 
The supposed climate crisis is the ex-
cuse for destroying our energy inde-
pendence. And if you listen to my col-
leagues’ comments today, you would 
think there was rampant voter sup-
pression and a rise of racial discrimina-
tion in voting. That is not true. That is

simply not true. It is divisive, and I 
would suggest that it is dangerous for 
our country. 
The real crisis, Madam Speaker, is 
America’s confidence in the integrity 
of our elections because elections are 
the backbone of our democracy, and so 
we need to make sure we do everything 
to ensure a free and fair process and an 
accurate outcome. 
That is the responsibility, according 
to the Constitution, of the States. We 
don’t need Federal Government law-
yers or the DOJ to be weaponized 
against States’ efforts to make these 
reforms with respect to voter ID, mail- 
in ballot eligibility, and other integ-
rity reform measures. 
Madam Speaker, let’s stick to the 
Constitution. Let’s uphold it. Let’s 
protect the States’ right to secure and 
improve election integrity for our citi-
zens and our electoral process in this 
great country. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 45 seconds to the gentlewoman 
from Florida (Ms. CASTOR). 
Ms. CASTOR of Florida. Madam 
Speaker, over the past decades when 
officials in Florida tried to restrict ac-
cess to the ballot box, the Voting 
Rights Act provided protections for all 
Floridians to cast their vote. 
Maybe they limited hours of voting, 
or didn’t provide timely notice to 
changes in polling places, or didn’t pro-
vide clear ballot language, but the Vot-
ing Rights Act was there. But, unfortu-
nately, the U.S. Supreme Court gutted 
the Voting Rights Act and after that 
State officials moved to enact other 
discriminatory practices to keep cer-
tain people and people of color from 
casting ballots. 
It is wrong. So it is vitally important 
that the Congress adopt the John R. 
Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act 
to make sure voting is fair, especially 
in places where voting discrimination 
has been historically prevalent. 
As John Lewis said: When you see 
something that is not right and not 
fair, you have to speak up. You have to 
say something. You have to do some-
thing. And that is what we are going to 
do today. I say to Representative SE-
WELL, We are going to cast a reinvigo-
rated Voting Rights Act. And I urge 
my colleagues to vote ‘‘yes.’’ 
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Madam 
Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gen-
tleman 
from 
Illinois 
(Mr. 
RODNEY 
DAVIS). 
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. 
Madam Speaker, a foundational de-
pendency of any democracy sustaining 
is its citizens having confidence in the 
outcome of its elections. Simply put, if 
people don’t have faith in elections, de-
mocracy doesn’t work. 
According to a recent Gallup poll, 
America’s confidence in our elections 
has decreased by 20 percent since 2009. 
Ensuring that our elections are run in 
a way that makes it easy to vote and 
hard to cheat increases confidence. A 
common best practice to ensure elec-
tion integrity are voter IDs, a way for 
people to prove they are who they say 
they are. 
For Democrats to equate this with 
the poll taxes of the early 20th century 
is a ludicrous, false equivalency. Ac-
cording 
to 
the 
Honest 
Elections 
Project, 77 percent of all Americans 
support voter ID requirements, includ-
ing 75 percent of independents, 64 per-
cent of African Americans, and 76 per-
cent of low-income voters. 
Knowing that, what does the major-
ity do? They include language in H.R. 4 
that would restrict commonsense voter 
ID requirements and require the judi-
cial branch to consider voter ID laws as 
evidence of voter suppression, and by 
extension, racism. That doesn’t restore 
faith in elections. 
H.R. 4, as introduced, would require 
preapproval by an unaccountable elec-
tion czar in the Biden DOJ before any 
State or locality under preclearance 
could 
enact 
popular, 
commonsense 
voter ID laws. H.R. 4 goes even further, 
requiring almost a dozen States to 
have their existing voter ID laws exam-
ined by the Biden DOJ before they can 
continue to be enforced. 
These are the same election integrity 
laws that have been in place for years. 
This is a partisan power grab of main-
taining control. 
Madam Speaker, if we adopt the mo-
tion to recommit, we will instruct the 
Committee on the Judiciary to con-
sider my amendment to H.R. 4 to 
strike from the bill the provisions that 
penalize State and local governments 
who implement commonsense voter ID 
requirements. 
Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous 
consent to insert the text of my 
amendment 
in 
the 
RECORD
imme-
diately prior to the vote on the motion 
to recommit. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Ms. 
BLUNT ROCHESTER). Is there objection 
to the request of the gentleman from 
Illinois? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 45 seconds to the distinguished 
gentlewoman from Georgia (Ms. WIL-
LIAMS). 
Ms. WILLIAMS of Georgia. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today in the spirit of 
my predecessor, Congressman John 
Lewis. 
Congressman Lewis taught us that 
when you see something that is not 
fair, not just, not right, you have a 
moral obligation to find a way to get in 
the way. 
The voter suppression laws that have 
been enacted across the country and 
what is happening in my home State of 
Georgia is the very definition of the 
good trouble that John Lewis taught us 
to get into, to push back against. 
We might not be counting jelly beans 
in a jar but make no mistake, they 
seek the same purpose: to stop people 
who look like me from accessing their 
right to vote. 
We all have an opportunity to get in 
the way today by voting ‘‘yes’’ on the 
John R. Lewis Voting Rights Advance-
ment Act. 
If my colleagues ever wondered what 
they would have done during the civil 
rights movement, this is your oppor-
tunity to find out. Our democracy is on 
the line. 
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Madam 
Speaker, I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, we 
have one final Speaker who will close 
for us, so I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Madam 
Speaker, I yield myself the balance of 
my time. 
The American people can see clearly 
what is happening here. Democrats in 
the Congress are more focused on tak-
ing Federal control over the election 
processes 
in 
Republican-led 
States 
than addressing the ongoing catas-
trophe that the Biden administration 
has created in Afghanistan, at our 
southern border, with inflation, and 
the ongoing pandemic. There are so 
many things that should be occupying 
our time and, yet, they are using it for 
this. 
The cry of voter suppression is not 
only untrue, but as Mr. ARRINGTON said 
so well here just a few moments ago, it 
is also divisive and dangerous. We need 
to speak truth, as Mr. HOYER said a lit-
tle while ago, and we are. 
We had six hearings in the Constitu-
tion, Civil Rights, and Civil Liberties 
Subcommittee since January on this. I 
am the ranking Republican there. Not 
a scintilla of evidence was presented 
that said that voters are being sup-
pressed, that the election integrity 
laws that are being passed by the 
States, pursuant to their constitu-
tional authority, are in any way inap-
propriate. To the contrary, they are ex-
panding access to the ballot. As we 
have said so many times, as I close, it 
has never been easier in America to 
vote. 
I yield back the balance of my time. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield the balance of my time to the 
gentleman from South Carolina (Mr. 
CLYBURN), the distinguished majority 
whip. 
Mr. CLYBURN. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman for yielding me 
the time. 
Madam Speaker, I want to take this 
time to thank my colleagues in this 
august body for the civility that we 
have demonstrated here as we approach 
this final vote. 
I want to thank the Democrats, 
every single one of whom cosponsored 
this legislation. I am hopeful that this 
can be a bipartisan result. I think all of 
us know that our country has a history 
of voter suppression and voter denial. I 
think all of us are quite aware of re-
cent efforts being made in many 
States. Forty-nine have passed laws 
that are called restrictive by objective 
analyses that have been made. These 
laws are not needed. These laws are 
very creative instruments that will be 
used if not checked to suppress the 
vote.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4413 
August 24, 2021 
We all heard a recent candidate hav-
ing lost an election call upon election 
officials to: Just find me the number of 
votes that I need to win this election. 
If that is not voter suppression, I would 
like to know how we would define it. 
So I want to thank all of us for what 
we have done here today, and I hope 
that this result can be a bipartisan 
one. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield back the balance of my time. 
Ms. JOHNSON of Texas. Madam Speaker, 
it is my honor to rise today in support of H.R. 
4, the John R. Lewis Voting Rights Advance-
ment Act. I’d like to thank Congresswoman 
SEWELL, a daughter of Selma, for introducing 
this bill and for being a fierce and relentless 
advocate of the right to vote. 
How wonderful is it, Madam Speaker, that 
this bill bears the name of our late colleague, 
one of the greatest Americans to ever walk 
these halls, Congressman John Lewis. His 
legacy—and the legacies of other civil rights 
leaders who dedicated their lives to ensuring 
free, fair, and equitable access to the polls— 
lives on through this legislation. 
For Texans, this fight for voting rights is per-
sonal. We have witnessed, over the past sev-
eral months, a systematic and antiquated ef-
fort to strip the right to vote away from millions 
across the state. This effort is built upon the 
decades and decades of unfair voting prac-
tices in the history of Texas. In fact, I remem-
ber having to pay a poll tax when I voted in 
my first election in Dallas. And although these 
new efforts are not as blatant as a poll tax, 
they are equally as obstructive. 
Texas is Just one of many states battling 
waves of restrictive voting legislation spurred 
by Republican majorities at the local level. 
These attempts at our rights are not new—and 
neither is the vigorous, concerted opposition to 
them. From Martin Luther King, Jr. and John 
Lewis’s march on Bloody Sunday to the Texas 
Democrats risking arrest to filibuster the pas-
sage of these laws, there are always people 
who are willing to fight. And as long as there 
are generations of people who are willing to 
fight, our cause will never perish. 
But now, Madam Speaker, it’s time for Con-
gress to meet the moment. We must pass 
H.R. 4—not only because it would prohibit the 
implementation of strict voter requirements 
and reductions in polling locations and hours; 
not only because it would restore the originals 
provisions and intent of the Voting Rights Act; 
but because it is also fundamentally the right 
thing to do in our democracy. 
As a proud cosponsor of H.R. 4, I would 
urge all of my colleagues, Democrat and Re-
publican, to support this legislation and, in 
doing so, express your support of the right to 
vote for all Americans. 
Mr. ESPAILLAT. Madam Speaker, we are 
living through a 21st century assault on the 
right to vote—the likes of which we haven’t 
seen since Jim Crow. 
Without a doubt, it’s the most significant test 
of our democracy since the Civil War—and fu-
ture generations will never forgive us if we 
don’t meet this moment. 
Meeting this moment requires us to act— 
and we need the John Lewis Voting Rights 
Act. 
The right to vote is sacred, the cornerstone 
of our Republic. But like Franklin Roosevelt 
warned—our Republic, if we can keep it.

RECOGNIZING THE SERVICE OF 
RICHARD ‘‘DICK’’ LAMM 
(Mr. PERLMUTTER asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
his remarks.) 
Mr. PERLMUTTER. Madam Speaker, 
on behalf of Congressman CROW, Con-
gressman NEGUSE, and myself, I rise 
today to recognize and honor Richard 
‘‘Dick’’ Lamm, the former Governor of 
Colorado from 1975 to 1987. 
Governor Lamm was a tremendous 
leader and public servant for our great 
State of Colorado. He passed away on 
July 29, 2021. As a three-term Governor, 
he was one of the longest-serving Gov-
ernors in Colorado history. 
Governor Lamm was born in Wis-
consin and moved to Denver in 1962. He 
served as a State representative from 
1966 to 1974, where he rose to the posi-
tion of assistant minority leader. Dur-
ing that time, he sponsored and helped 
pass several pieces of noteworthy legis-
lation, including the Nation’s first 
abortion law in 1967, ensuring women 
access to critical healthcare, including 
abortion services in cases of rape or in-
cest. 
In 1987, he began his first term as 
Governor of Colorado and went on to 
serve for 12 years, earning support from 
people across the State with his no- 
nonsense attitude and strong commit-
ment to equality, education, and the 
environment. 
Before 
holding 
office, 
Governor 
Lamm served as a first lieutenant in 
the United States Army and worked as 
an attorney and a certified public ac-
countant. After leaving office, he co-
ordinated and co-directed the Univer-
sity of Denver Institute for Public Pol-
icy Studies. 
Above all else, Dick Lamm was a de-
voted husband and loving father. He 
stayed active in politics and kept up 
with Colorado news until his death. 
While Colorado has been blessed with 
many great leaders throughout its his-
tory, few rise to the caliber and reputa-
tion of Dick Lamm. 
f 
SOCIALISM IN AMERICA 
(Mr. CAWTHORN asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Mr. CAWTHORN. Madam Speaker, 
you have squandered the inheritance of 
a generation today. You have governed 
with abandon and exchanged financial 
assurance for instant gratification. 
Today, you didn’t pass a budget plan. 
You passed a death wish for America. 
It is easy for you to sit up there and 
authorize $68 trillion over the next 10 
years because you will never have to 
shoulder the financial burden of your 
actions. 
Your road map for our future is a 
highway to hell. You have exchanged 
the American Dream for a socialist 
nightmare. 
To the American people: You have 
been lied to. Your taxes will be raised 
because of the actions of Democrats 
today. 
I shudder to think of what our coun-
try, our city on a hill, our beacon of 
freedom, will look like in a generation 
when we deliver a Nation devoid of 
treasure to our children. 
We will give account one day for our 
actions 
in 
this 
Congress. 
Madam 
Speaker, if we hand over a bankrupt 
legacy to our children, your actions 
today will be indicted, and you will be 
without excuse. Madam Speaker, you 
are walking around with my genera-
tion’s checkbook, and we want it back. 
f 
BUILDING BACK BETTER 
(Mr. SOTO asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. SOTO. Madam Speaker, the 
American people have spoken. It is 
time to build back better. 
Today’s historic vote shows that 
President Biden and the Democratic 
Congress are united and that we are 
keeping our promises to the American 
people who put us in office. 
Today, we move forward on the bi-
partisan infrastructure package to re-
build our Nation. Today, we move for-
ward on the Build Back Better rec-
onciliation bill to invest in American 
families. And today, we move forward 
on restoring the Voting Rights Act to 
protect our democracy. 
It is not a moment too soon. Flor-
ida’s Ninth Congressional District is 
the fastest growing district in the Na-
tion, 40 percent growth, as I represent 
955,000 constituents. 
Whether it is central Florida or 
across the Nation, it is time to upgrade 
America’s roads, bridges, ports, air-
ports, rural broadband, clean water, 
and resilient and renewable energy. It 
is time to make childcare costs and

HONORING MICHAEL K. 
DEMICHAEL 
(Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois 
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend his remarks.) 
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today in honor 
of Michael DeMichael of my hometown 
of Taylorville, Illinois, who passed 
away on August 17 at the age of 69. 
Mike was a true lover of sports, espe-
cially when it came to coaching. He 
began as the coach of the seventh grade 
Terriers basketball team. His coaching 
career lasted over 20 years, taking 
teams to the State tournament on four 
occasions. He loved the game, but his 
true passion was caring for the kids he 
coached throughout the years. 
Mike gave back to our community in 
many ways. He was a member of St. 
Mary’s Catholic Church, the Knights of 
Columbus, and the Moose Lodge. He 
was a founding member of the Sertoma 
Club, the Taylorville Public Schools 
Foundation, and the Lakeshore Golf 
Course improvement committee. He 
was also a member of the Taylorville 
Junior High Terriers Sports Boosters, 
the High School Band Boosters, and 
the Tornado Open. 
His 
passing 
is 
a 
loss 
for 
our 
Taylorville community and everyone 
who had the pleasure of knowing him. 
Shannon and I send our thoughts and 
prayers to his wife, Karen; his children, 
Brent and Susie; his grandchildren, 
Hudson, Hayden, Peyton, and Brayden; 
his brother, Tony; his sister, Patricia; 
and the rest of his family. 
May my friend Mike rest in peace. 
f 
ATROCITY IN AFGHANISTAN 
(Mr. GOHMERT asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. GOHMERT. Mr. Speaker, we got 
a couple of calls at the office today. We 
got numerous calls. But two veterans 
fighting in Afghanistan wept in the 
calls about the sacrifices that they 
made, the friends they had lost fight-
ing in Afghanistan, and the Afghan 
people. 
I have been meeting with Northern 
Alliance leaders for a decade or so. 
They have asked not that we stay for-
ever. We couldn’t do that, and they 
didn’t want us to do that. But they 
said: Whatever you do, leave us in a po-
sition to fight the Taliban when you 
are gone because if you don’t, they will 
kill every one of us who fought for you 
and with you, and then there will be 
nobody to fight them after you are hit 
worse than you were on 9/11. 
This is an atrocity. Let’s leave the 
Northern Alliance the weapons that 
the Taliban should never have, and 
let’s get the Americans out. 
CELEBRATING THE LIFE OF 
WANDA RIDDLE 
(Ms. VAN DUYNE asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Ms. VAN DUYNE. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to celebrate the life of Wanda 
Riddle of Irving, Texas, who passed on 
August 5, 2021. She was a great friend 
and faithful supporter of our commu-
nity for over 35 years. 
Wanda was known as the mayor of 
south Irving and had a heart for public 
service. We have been fortunate to hear 
stories from her family over the past 
few weeks, which painted a picture of 
her life. 
Wanda and her late husband, Jim, 
started a family and raised their sons 
Rick, Ron, and Rod in Irving. They left 
a lasting impact on their community 
through the Jim and Wanda Riddle Me-
morial Scholarship, which is set to 
award a student-athlete from Nimitz 
High School a $1,000 scholarship annu-
ally. 
Wanda’s passing was a great loss for 
Irving and everyone who had the pleas-
ure of knowing her. Our community 
would not be the same without Wan-
da’s guidance, friendship, and support. 
May God continue to bless the com-
munity and the Riddle family at this 
difficult time.

REMEMBERING FRANK KOHLER 
PEEPLES 
(Mr. CARTER of Georgia asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and 
extend his remarks.) 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, I rise today to remember and honor 
Frank Peeples of Savannah, Georgia, 
who passed away on August 18 at the 
age of 93. 
Frank’s accomplishments in life are 
nothing less than remarkable. He grad-
uated from the Georgia Institute of 
Technology and earned a degree in in-
dustrial engineering. Under the leader-
ship of Coach Bobby Dodd, Frank made 
history as the first sophomore to be-
come head manager of the football 
team. He was inducted into the Georgia 
Tech School of Engineering Hall of 
Fame and the Athletic Hall of Fame 
for his remarkable achievements. 
Following graduation, he served this 
country in the Korean war in the 
United States Army. After the war, 
Frank achieved a global reputation as 
an entrepreneur, inventor, and busi-
nessman. Frank’s pride in his service 
to his country and community is re-
markable, and I am honored to recog-
nize him today. 
My thoughts and prayers are with his 
family, friends, and all who knew him 
during this most difficult time. 
f 
UPHOLDING THE LEGACY OF THE 
HONORABLE JOHN LEWIS 
(Mr. PANETTA asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. PANETTA. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
with pride and in support of tonight’s 
passage of the John Lewis Voting 
Rights Act. 
As we know, the right to vote is fun-
damental to our Nation. That is why 
we should be doing everything possible 
not to make it more difficult to vote 
but to enhance voting rights. 
H.R. 4 does that by modifying the 
Voting Rights Act to restore and 
strengthen its antidiscrimination en-
forcement authorities. 
Now, in my district, prior to the 
Shelby decision, we had a voting rights 
county. But, clearly, the threats to our 
ability to vote are not limited to my 
district as this year alone 18 States 
across the country have passed 30 laws 
making it harder to vote. 
That is why I voted for this bill. That 
is why John Lewis served and sac-
rificed, and that is why he crossed the 
Edmund Pettus Bridge in 1965 and in 
2020 when I was honored to cross it 
with him, hand in hand. 
Tonight, we not only upheld the leg-
acy of John Lewis but, by passing H.R. 
4, we were able to eventually provide 
citizens with more opportunity to vote 
in our democracy. 
f 
RECOGNIZING ALLYSON RENEAU 
(Mrs. BICE of Oklahoma asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and 
extend her remarks.) 
Mrs. BICE of Oklahoma. Mr. Speaker, 
I rise today to recognize an American 
helping our Afghan allies. 
The situation unfolding in Afghani-
stan is dire, but in the midst of crisis, 
there is always light to be found. In 
Oklahoma’s Fifth Congressional Dis-
trict, that light is Allyson Reneau. 
She took matters into her own hands 
to help 10 members of an Afghan girls 
robotics team escape. She has nine 
daughters of her own and met the girls 
at a 2019 robotics competition. As the 
Taliban took over the country, she 
could not stop thinking about their 
safety. 
Reneau reached out to a friend who 
worked in the U.S. Embassy in Qatar. 
They completed the necessary paper-
work, the Government of Qatar sent a 
plane, and the girls were flown to safe-
ty. 
It is women like Allyson Reneau who 
remind us that there is always a light 
in the dark, even if it shines from one 
lone candle.

been putting in in the last several 
weeks. 
The individuals that work in our 
Washington, D.C. and our Ogden, Utah, 
district offices are truly the unsung he-
roes in our world. 
I often get the credit by having my 
name on a bill or my name on an inter-
view, but the work that they have been 
doing to help our American citizens in 
Afghanistan and our partners is un-
precedented. 
All summer we have been dealing 
with State Department backlogs to get 
their passports so they can go to Costa 
Rica or something like that, and they 
have been doing a very good job. It all 
turned very real as we have been work-
ing around the clock and taking an 
enormous amount of stress and anguish 
to do our part. 
I hope that the First District of Utah 
knows that our team is working to do 
everything we can to help out those 
families who are directly affected by 
this. 
Our thoughts and prayers are going 
to a better outcome as we come out of 
this.

SECTION-BY-SECTION
ANALYSIS
OF
JOHN
R. 
LEWIS VOTING RIGHTS ADVANCEMENT ACT 
OF 2021 FOR THE 117TH CONGRESS AS AMEND-
ED 
Section 1. Short Title. Section 1 sets forth 
the short title of the bill as the ‘‘John R. 
Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act of 
2021’’ (‘‘VRAA’’). 
Section 2. Vote Dilution, Denial, and 
Abridgement Claims. Section 2 of the bill 
would amend Section 2 of the Voting Rights 
Act of 1965 (‘‘VRA’’) in response to the Su-
preme Court’s decision in Brnovich v. Demo-
cratic National Committee. VRA Section 
2(a) prohibits states and localities from im-
posing a voting rule that has the purpose or 
effect of denying or abridging citizens’ right 
to vote because of race, color, or language 
minority status. VRA Section 2(b) currently 
lays out a test for determining when such a 
violation has occurred, providing that a vio-
lation is established if, ‘‘based on the total-
ity of the circumstances, it is shown that the 
political processes leading to nomination or 
election in the State or political subdivision 
are not equally open to participation by 
members of a class of citizens protected by 
subsection (a) in that its members have less 
opportunity than other members of the elec-
torate to participate in the political process 
and to elect representatives of their choice.’’ 
In response to the Brnovich Court’s nar-
rowing of Section 2(b) in vote denial cases 
(and with potential risk for vote dilution 
cases), the bill creates a bifurcated test, one 
that would apply to vote dilution claims 
(e.g., challenges to redistricting or changes 
in district or jurisdictional boundaries) and 
vote 
denial 
claims 
(e.g., 
challenges 
to 
changes in voting rules). 
Section 2(a) of the bill would amend Sec-
tion 2(a) of the VRA by making technical 
amendments to clarify that subsection (b) 
and new subsections (c), (d), or (e) apply 
when determining a violation under Section 
2(a) of the VRA. 
Section 2(b) of the bill amends Section 2(b) 
of the VRA to preserve the existing ‘‘totality 
of the circumstances’’ test, and expressly 
adopt the list of non-exhaustive factors ap-
plied by federal courts considering Section 2 
vote dilution claims that were outlined in 
the Supreme Court’s 1986 decision in Thorn-
burg v. Gingles. Section 2(b) of the bill re-
quires a plaintiff to establish as a threshold 
matter that 1) the members of the protected 
are sufficiently numerous and geographi-
cally compact to constitute a majority in a 
single member district; 2) the members of 
the protected class are politically cohesive; 
and 3) the residents of that district who are 
not the members of the protected class usu-
ally vote sufficiently as a bloc to enable 
them to defeat the preferred candidates of 
the members of the protected class. 
Section 2(b) of the bill also provides that 
once the plaintiff establishes the required 
threshold showing, a court must consider a 
totality of the circumstances analysis with 
respect to a claim of vote dilution to deter-
mine whether there has been a violation of 
Section 2(A) of the VRA, which must include 
consideration of the following factors: 
(1) The extent of any history of official 
voting discrimination in the state or polit-
ical subdivision that affected the right of 
members of the protected class to register, 
to vote, or otherwise to participate in the 
political process. 
(2) The extent to which voting in the elec-
tions of the state or political subdivision is 
racially polarized. 
(3) The extent to which the state or polit-
ical subdivision has used voting practices or 
procedures that tend to enhance the oppor-
tunity for discrimination against the mem-
bers of the protected class, such as unusually 
large elections districts, majority vote re-
quirements, anti-single shot provisions, or 
other qualifications, prerequisites, stand-
ards, practices, or procedures that may en-
hance the opportunity for discrimination 
against the members of the protected class. 
(4) If there is a candidate slating process, 
whether the members of the protected class 
have been denied access to that process. 
(5) The extent to which members of the 
protected class in the state or political sub-
division bear the effects of discrimination, 
both public or private, in such areas as edu-
cation, employment, health, housing, and 
transportation which hinder their ability to 
participate effectively in the political proc-
ess. 
(6) Whether political campaigns have been 
characterized by over or subtle racial ap-
peals. 
(7) The extent to which members of the 
protected class have been elected to public 
office in the jurisdiction. 
Section 2(b) also provides that in con-
ducting a totality of the circumstances anal-
ysis under this subsection a court may con-
sider such other factors as the court may de-
termine to be relevant, including 1) whether 
there is a significant lack of responsiveness 
on the part of elected officials to the par-
ticularized needs of the members of the pro-
tected class, including a lack of concern for 
or responsiveness to the requests and pro-
posals of the members of the protected class, 
except that compliance with a court order 
may not be considered evidence of respon-
siveness on the part of the jurisdiction; and 
2) whether the policy underlying the state or 
political subdivision’s use of such voting 
practices is tenuous. In making this second 
determination, Section 2(b) further requires 
a court to consider whether the qualifica-
tion, prerequisite, standard, practice, or pro-
cedure in question was designed to advance 
and materially advances a valid and substan-
tiated state interest. 
Section 2(b) of the bill also amends Section 
2 of the VRA to create a new subsection 2(c) 
to govern claims of vote denial. Under new 
subsection 2(c) , a violation of Section 2(a) is 
established if a voting standard, practice, or 
procedure 1) results or will result in mem-
bers of a protected class facing greater costs 
or burdens in participating in the political 
process than other voters and 2) that the 
greater costs or burdens are, at least in part, 
caused by or linked to social and historical 
conditions that have or currently produce on 
the date of such challenge discrimination on 
the basis of race, color, or language minority 
status. Section 2(b) further states that in de-
termining the existence of a burden, the ab-
solute number or the percent of voters af-
fected or the presence of voters who are not

members of a protected class in the affected 
area is not be dispositive, and the affected 
area may be smaller than the jurisdiction to 
which the qualification, prerequisite, stand-
ard, practice, or procedure applies. Addition-
ally, Section 2(b) provides that the chal-
lenged voting rule need only be one ‘‘but- 
for’’ cause of the discriminatory result. 
Section 2(b) also expressly outlines for 
courts the factors that are relevant to the 
totality of the circumstances analysis in a 
vote denial claim under new subsection 2(c). 
The factors that are relevant include the fol-
lowing: 
(1) The extent of any history of official 
voting-related discrimination in the state or 
political subdivision that affected the right 
of members of the protected class to register, 
to vote, or otherwise to participate in the 
political process. 
(2) The extent to which voting in the elec-
tions of the state or political subdivision is 
racially polarized. 
(3) The extent to which the state or polit-
ical subdivision has used photo ID require-
ments, documentary proof of citizenship re-
quirements, documentary proof of residence 
requirements, or other voting practices or 
procedure beyond those required by federal 
law that impair the ability of members of 
the minority group to participate fully in 
the political process. 
(4) The extent to which minority group 
members bear the effects of discrimination 
both public or private, in areas such as edu-
cation, employment, health, housing, and 
transportation, which hinder their ability to 
participate effectively in the political proc-
ess. 
(5) The use of overt or subtle racial appeals 
either in political campaigns or surrounding 
adoption or maintenance of the challenge 
practice. 
(6) The extent to which members of the mi-
nority group have been elected to public of-
fice in the jurisdiction, provided that the fat 
that the minority group is too small to elect 
candidates of its choice shall not defeat a 
vote denial claims. 
(7) Whether there is a lack of responsive-
ness on the part of elected officials to the 
particularized needs of minority group mem-
bers including a lack of concern for or re-
sponsiveness to the requests and proposals of 
the group, except that compliance with a 
court order may not be considered evidence 
of responsiveness on the part of the jurisdic-
tion. 
(8) Whether the policy underlying the state 
or political subdivision’s use of the chal-
lenged voting practice is tenuous. In making 
a determination under this clause, a court 
shall consider whether the qualification, pre-
requisite, standard, practice, or procedure in 
question was designed to advance and mate-
rially advances a valid and substantiated 
State interest. 
(9) Such other factors as the court may de-
termine to be relevant subject to the limita-
tions set forth in this subsection. 
Section 2(b) also outlines the factors that 
are not relevant to the ‘‘totality of the cir-
cumstances’’ in a vote denial claim under 
new subsection 2(c). The factors that are not 
relevant include the following: 
(1) The degree to which the challenged vot-
ing practice has a long pedigree or was in 
widespread use at some earlier date. 
(2) The use of an identical or similar voting 
practice in other states or jurisdictions. 
(3) The availability of other forms of vot-
ing unimpacted by the challenged voting 
practice to all members of the electorate, in-
cluding members of the protected class, un-
less the jurisdiction is simultaneously ex-
panding such other practices to eliminate 
any disproportionate burden imposed by the 
challenged voting practice. 
(4) Unsubstantiated defenses that the qual-
ification, prerequisite, standard, practice, or 
procedure is necessary to address criminal 
activity. 
Section 2(b) creates new subsection 2(d) 
which clarifies that 1) a violation of Section 
2(a) of the VRA for the purpose of a vote de-
nial or abridgement is established if the 
challenged voting practice is intended, at 
least in part, to dilute minority voting 
strength or to deny the right of any citizen 
to vote on account of race, color, or member-
ship in a language minority group; 2) that 
racial discrimination need only be one pur-
pose behind the challenged voting rule in 
order to establish a violation of Section 2(a) 
of the VRA; 3) that a voting practice in-
tended to dilute minority voting strength or 
make it more difficult for minority voters to 
cast a ballot that will be counted violates 
this subsection even if an additional purpose 
of the voting practice is to benefit a par-
ticular political party or group; 4) that the 
context for the adoption of the challenged 
voting practices, including actions by offi-
cial decisionmakers, may be relevant to a 
violation of this subsection; and 5) that 
claims under this subsection require proof of 
a discriminatory impact but do not require 
proof of a violation of new subsection 2(b) or 
new subsection 2(c). 
Lastly, Section 2(b) creates new subsection 
2(e) which for the purposes of Section 2 de-
fines the term ‘affected area’ to mean any 
geographic area in which members of a pro-
tected class are affected by a qualification, 
prerequisite, standard, practice, or procedure 
allegedly in violation of this section, within 
a State (including any Indian lands). 
Section 3. Retrogression. Section 3 of the 
bill would add after Section 2 of the VRA as 
amended by the Act a new Section 2(f). Sec-
tion 2(f) effectively imports Section 5’s ret-
rogression standard into Section 2 by estab-
lishing that a violation of Section 2(a) occurs 
where a r voting law or rule makes minority 
citizens worse off than the status quo in 
terms of their ability to vote. Specifically, 
such a voting rule would violate Section 2(a) 
if it had the purpose or will have the effect 
of diminishing the ability of any citizen to 
participate in the electoral process or elect a 
candidate of their choice on account of their 
race, color, or membership in a language mi-
nority group. The subsection applies retro-
actively to any action taken on or after Jan-
uary 1, 2021. 
Section 3 also creates a new subsection 2(g) 
which clarifies that the decisions of the 
United States District Court for the District 
of Columbia preclearing any state or polit-
ical subdivision’s change to a voting law or 
practice supersedes new subsection 2(f). 
Section 4. Violations Triggering Authority 
of Court to Retain Jurisdiction. Section 4(a) 
amends Section 3(c) of the VRA to strength-
en the ‘‘bail-in’’ provision by permitting 
courts to bail in jurisdictions where there 
have been violations of the VRA and other 
federal prohibitions against discrimination 
in voting, in addition to instances where 
there have been violations of the Fourteenth 
or Fifteenth Amendments. Section 3(c) of the 
VRA, known as the ‘‘bail-in’’ provision, cur-
rently allows courts to retain jurisdiction to 
supervise further voting changes in jurisdic-
tions where the court has found violations of 
the Fourteenth or Fifteenth Amendments. If 
a jurisdiction is ‘‘bailed in,’’ it must submit 
any changes to its voting procedures for ap-
proval either to a U.S. district court or to 
the Attorney General. Section 4(a) strikes 
‘‘violations of the Fourteenth and Fifteenth 
amendment’’ and inserts ‘‘violations of the 
Fourteenth or Fifteenth Amendments, viola-
tions of this Act, or violations of any Fed-
eral law that prohibits discrimination in vot-
ing on the basis of race, color, or member-
ship in a language minority group.’’ 
Lastly, Section 4(b) of the bill also makes 
technical and conforming amendments to 
Section 3(a) of the VRA. 
Section 5. Criteria for Coverage of States 
and Political Subdivisions. Section 5(a)(1) of 
the bill amends Section 4(b) of the VRA by 
inserting a new coverage formula intended to 
meet the requirements set out in Shelby 
County. Formerly, Section 4(b) provided the 
coverage formula for determining which ju-
risdictions were subject to the Section 5 
preclearance requirement. The coverage for-
mula was triggered if a state or political sub-
division, as of various points in the 1960s or 
early 1970s, (1) employed prohibited ‘‘tests or 
devices’’ used to limit voting and (2) had 
fewer than 50 percent voter registration or 
turnout among its voting-age population. In 
Shelby County, the Court held that Section 
4(b) was unconstitutional because it imposed 
current burdens that were no longer respon-
sive to the current conditions in the voting 
districts in question. 
Under the new coverage formula in Section 
5(a)(1), ‘‘a State and all political subdivisions 
within the State’’ during a calendar year 
would be covered if, during the previous 25 
calendar years, there were 1) 15 or more vot-
ing rights violations occurred in the state; 2) 
ten or more voting rights violations occurred 
in the state and at least one violation was 
committed by the state itself, rather than a 
political subdivision (e.g., county, town, 
school district); or (3) three or more voting 
rights violations occurred in the state and 
the state itself administers elections in the 
state or in political subdivisions in which 
the voting rights violations occurred. In ad-
dition, Section 5(a)(1) provides that a polit-
ical subdivision would be covered if three or 
more voting rights violations occurred in 
that subdivision during the past 25 years. 
Section 5(a)(1) specifies that the 25-year cov-
erage period ends 10 years after a jurisdic-
tion is covered. 
Section 5(a)(1) provides that if a state or 
political 
subdivision 
obtains 
declaratory 
judgment and the judgment remains in ef-
fect, coverage under preclearance shall no 
longer apply unless voting rights violations 
occur after the issuance of a declaratory 
judgment. 
Section 5(a)(1) defines several types of 
events or incidents as ‘‘voting rights viola-
tions.’’ The definition includes: 
(1) a final judgment or any preliminary, 
temporary, or declaratory relief that was not 
reversed on appeal in which the plaintiff pre-
vailed or a federal court found that the 
plaintiff demonstrated a likelihood of suc-
cess on the merits or raised a serious ques-
tion with regard to race discrimination, in 
which any federal court determined that a 
state or political subdivision denied or 
abridged the right to vote on account of 
race, color, or membership in a language mi-
nority group, or that a voting qualification 
or prerequisite to voting, or standard, prac-
tice, or procedure with respect to voting, 
created an ‘‘undue burden’’ in connection 
with a claim that the challenged rule unduly 
burdened minority citizens in violation of 
the Fourteenth or Fifteenth Amendment 
anywhere in the state or subdivision; 
(2) a final judgment or any preliminary, 
temporary, or declaratory relief that was not 
reversed on appeal in which the plaintiff pre-
vailed or a federal court found that the 
plaintiff demonstrated a likelihood of suc-
cess on the merits or raised a serious ques-
tion with regard to race discrimination, in 
which any federal court determined that a 
voting qualification or prerequisite to voting 
or standard, practice, or procedure with re-
spect to voting was imposed or applied or

would have been imposed or applied any-
where in the state or subdivision in a man-
ner that denied or abridged or would have de-
nied or abridged minority citizens’ right to 
vote, in violation of various VRA provisions; 
(3) a final judgment, that is not reversed 
on appeal, by a federal court denying a state 
or political subdivision’s lawsuit seeking a 
declaratory judgment under Section 3(c) or 
Section 5 of the VRA that its proposed 
change does not have the purpose or effect of 
denying citizens the right to vote on account 
of race, color, or language-minority status 
and thereby prevented a voting practice from 
being enforced anywhere within the state or 
subdivision; 
(4) an objection by the Attorney General 
under Section 3(c) or Section 5 of the VRA, 
which thereby prevent a voting practice to 
be enforced anywhere within the state or 
subdivision. A violation does not occur if the 
Attorney General has withdrawn an objec-
tion unless the withdrawal was in response 
to a change in the law or practice that 
served as the basis of the objection. A viola-
tion also does not occur where the objection 
is based solely on a state or political subdivi-
sions’ failure to comply with a procedural 
process that would not otherwise constitute 
an independent violation of this act; or 
(5) a consent decree, settlement, or other 
agreement that was adopted or entered by a 
federal court or contained an admission of li-
ability by the defendants, which resulted in 
the alteration or abandonment of a voting 
practice anywhere within the territory of 
the state or subdivision that had been chal-
lenged as discriminatory under the VRA. An 
extension or modification of such consent 
decree, settlement, or other agreement that 
has been in place for 10 years or longer con-
stitutes an independent violation. If a court 
finds that an agreement itself defined by this 
subsection denied or abridged the right to 
vote of any citizen on account of race, color, 
or membership in a language minority 
group, violated the provisions of the VRA, or 
created an undue burden on minority citi-
zens’ right to vote in connection with a 
claim that the consent decree, settlement, or 
other agreement unduly burdened voters of a 
particular race, color, or language minority 
group, that finding shall count as an inde-
pendent violation. 
(6) in the case of multiple violations com-
mitted by a jurisdiction, each violation is to 
count as an independent violation, and with-
in a redistricting plan, each violation found 
to discriminate against any group of voters 
based on race, color, or language minority 
group shall count as an independent viola-
tion. 
Section 5(a)(1) sets forth the timing of de-
terminations of voting rights violations by 
the Attorney General and requires that the 
determinations are made ‘‘[a]s early as prac-
ticable during each calendar year . . . in-
cluding updating the list of voting rights 
violations occurring in each State and polit-
ical subdivision for the previous calendar 
year.’’ This section also provides that the de-
termination or certification of the Attorney 
General shall be effective upon publication 
in the Federal Register. 
Section 5(a)(2) of the bill makes con-
forming amendments to Section 4(a) of the 
VRA. Section 4(a) of the VRA provides the 
mechanism by which a covered jurisdiction 
can ‘‘bail out’’ of the preclearance require-
ment. Essentially, a jurisdiction must dem-
onstrate to a court that it has not engaged 
in discriminatory practices and has complied 
with the preclearance process in the pre-
ceding 10 years. 
Section 5(b) of the bill amends Section 
4(a)(1) by striking ‘‘race or color,’’ and in-
serting ‘‘race, color, or in contravention of 
the guarantees of subsection (f)(2),’’ which 
protects the voting rights of a member of a 
language minority. 
Section 5(c)(1) of the bill amends Section 4 
of the VRA by adding a new subsection (g), 
New subsection (g) provides an administra-
tive bailout process for local jurisdictions 
without a history of discrimination that 
might 
be 
captured 
by 
geographic 
preclearance coverage. 
New subsection (g)(1)(A) requires the At-
torney General after making the determina-
tion as to which states are subject to geo-
graphic 
preclearance 
to 
also 
determine 
which political subdivisions of those states 
are eligible for an exemption under sub-
section (g) and to publish the list of any such 
political subdivisions in the Federal Reg-
ister. Furthermore, any political subdivision 
so listed is not subject to any requirement 
under Section 5 until the date on which any 
application under this section has been fi-
nally disposed of or no such application may 
be made. 
New subsection (g)(1)(B) creates a rule of 
construction that states that determinations 
made pursuant to inclusion on the published 
list under subsection (g)(1)(A) does not have 
any binding or preclusive effect nor does in-
clusion constitute a final determination by 
the Attorney General that a listee is eligible 
for an exemption; that a listee has satisfied 
eligibility requirements (A) through (F) pro-
vided under new subsection (g)(2); or that the 
listee is entitled to an exemption under new 
subsection (g). 
New subsection (g)(2) sets forth the eligi-
bility requirements for an exemption under 
this new subsection. New subsection (g)(2) 
states that a political subdivision that 
makes an application under new subsection 
(g)(3) is eligible for an exemption under this 
subsection provided that during the ten 
years preceding the filing of the application, 
and during the pendency of such application: 
(A) no test or device referred to in sub-
section 4(a)(1) of the VRA has been used 
within the political subdivision with the pur-
pose or effect of denying or abridging the 
right to vote on account of race, color, or 
membership in a language minority group; 
(B) no final judgement of any court of the 
United States, other than the denial of de-
claratory judgment under this section, has 
determined that denials or abridgements of 
the right to vote on account of race, color, or 
membership in a language minority group 
have occurred anywhere in the territory of 
such political subdivision and no consent de-
cree, settlement, or agreement has been en-
tered into resulting in any abandonment of a 
voting law or practice challenged on such 
grounds; and no declaratory judgment under 
this section has been entered during the 
pendency of an action commenced before the 
filing of an action under this section and al-
leging such denials or abridgements of the 
right to vote; 
(C) no federal examiners or observers under 
the VRA have been assigned to such political 
subdivision; 
(D) such political subdivision and all gov-
ernmental units within its territory have 
complied with Section 5 of the VRA, includ-
ing compliance with the requirement that no 
change covered by Section 5 has been en-
forced without preclearance under Section 5, 
and have repealed all changes covered by 
Section 5 to which the Attorney General has 
successfully objected or as to which the 
United States District Court for the District 
of Columbia has denied declaratory judg-
ment; 
(E) the Attorney General has not inter-
posed any objection (that has not been over-
turned by a final judgment of a court) and no 
declaratory judgment has been denied under 
Section 5, with respect to any submission or 
by or on behalf of the plaintiff or any gov-
ernmental unit within its territory under 
Section 5, and no such submissions or declar-
atory judgment actions are pending; and 
(F) such political subdivisions and all gov-
ernmental units within its territory have 
eliminated voting procedures and methods of 
election which inhibit or dilute equal access 
to the electoral process; engaged in construc-
tive efforts to eliminate intimidation and 
harassment of persons exercising rights pro-
tected under the VRA; and engaged in other 
constructive efforts, such as expanded oppor-
tunity for convenient registration and vot-
ing for every person of voting age and the ap-
pointment of minority persons as election 
officials throughout the jurisdiction and at 
all stages of the election and registration 
process. 
New subsection (g)(3) establishes the appli-
cation period for the exemption provided 
under new subsection (g). Not later than 90 
days after the publication of the list under 
new subsection (g)(1)(A), a political subdivi-
sion included under such a list may submit 
an application containing such information 
that the Attorney General may require, and 
the Attorney General must provide notice in 
the Federal Register of such an application. 
New subsection (g)(4) requires the Attor-
ney General to establish a comment period 
during the 90 days beginning on the date that 
notice is published under new subsection 
(g)(3) to give interested persons an oppor-
tunity to submit objections to the Attorney 
General regarding the issuance of an exemp-
tion under this subsection to a political sub-
division on the basis that it may not meet 
the eligibility requirements under new sub-
section (g)(2). New subsection (g)(4) also re-
quires the 90–day period to be extended for 
an additional 30 days during the 1–year pe-
riod beginning on the effective date of this 
subsection. Additionally, the Attorney Gen-
eral must notify the political subdivision of 
each submitted objection and afford the po-
litical subdivision the opportunity to re-
spond. 
New subsection (g)(5) sets forth require-
ments for the Attorney General when mak-
ing a determination as to the objections sub-
mitted during the 90–day comment period es-
tablished under new subsection (g)(4). Under 
this subsection, the Attorney General must 
consider and respond to each objection (and 
any response of the political subdivision) 
during the 60–day period beginning on the 
day after the comment period under new sub-
section (g)(4) concludes. If the Attorney Gen-
eral determines that any objection is justi-
fied, the Attorney General must publish no-
tice in the Federal Register denying the ap-
plication for an exemption. If the Attorney 
General determines that no objection sub-
mitted is justified, no later than 90 days 
after the 60-day comment period established 
under this subsection concludes, each person 
that submitted an objection may filed in the 
District Court of the District of Columbia, 
an action for judicial review of such deter-
mination in according with 5 U.S.C. Ch. 7. 
New subsection (g)(6) provides the Attor-
ney General the authority to issue an exemp-
tion under this subsection by publication in 
the Federal Register from the application of 
the preclearance formula in Section 4(a) 
with respect to a political subdivision that is 
eligible under new subsection (g)(2) and to 
which no objection submitted under new sub-
section (g)(4) or determined justified under 
new subsection (g)(5). 
New subsection (g)(7) states that, unless 
explicitly provided in this subsection, no de-
termination under this subsection shall be 
subject to judicial review, and that all deter-
minations under this subsection are com-
mitted to the discretion of the Attorney 
General. 
New subsection (g)(8) exempts a political 
subdivision from geographic preclearance

subdivision obtained a declaratory judgment 
entered prior to the effective date of this 
subsection ‘‘bailing out’’ the political sub-
division and the political subdivision has not 
violated any of the eligibility requirements 
set forth in new subsection (g)(2) any time 
thereafter. 
Section 5(c)(2)(A) of the bill makes several 
technical and conforming amendments to 
Section 4(a)(1) of the VRA. 
Section 5(c)(2)(B) of the bill creates a self- 
executing amendment to the VRA, estab-
lishing that 1 year following the effective 
date of new subsection (g), Section 4(g)(3) of 
the VRA (new subsection (g)(3) in this docu-
ment) is amended by striking ‘‘During the 1 
year period beginning on the effective date 
of this subsection, such 90-day period shall 
be extended by an additional 30 days.’’ Sec-
tion 5(c)(2)(B) also provides that for the pur-
poses of any periods under such section com-
menced as of such date, the 90-day period 
shall remain extended by an additional 30 
days. 
Section 6. Determination of States and Po-
litical Subdivisions Subject to Preclearance 
for Covered Practices. Section 6 of the bill 
would add after Section 4 of the VRA a new 
‘‘Section 4A’’ that would provide a new 
‘‘practice-based preclearance’’ formula for 
known practices that would apply nation-
wide and cover voting law changes that have 
historically 
been 
used 
to 
discriminate 
against voters. 
New Section 4A(a)(1) provides that each 
state and political subdivision must identify 
all new laws, regulations, or policies that in-
clude voting qualifications or prerequisites 
to voting covered by subsection (b) and en-
sure that no covered practice is implemented 
unless it has been precleared. 
New Section 4A(a)(2)(A) provides that the 
Attorney General, in consultation with the 
Director of the Bureau of Census and the 
heads of other relevant governmental offices, 
must determine as early as possible each cal-
endar year the voting-age populations and 
characteristics of those populations, and 
publish a list of the states and subdivisions 
to which a voting-age population char-
acteristic described in the ‘‘Covered Prac-
tices’’ section. Section 4A(a)(2(B) of the bill 
sets forth that a ‘‘determination or certifi-
cation of the Attorney General under this 
paragraph shall be effective upon publication 
in the Federal Register.’’ 
New Section 4A(b) defines the following as 
‘‘covered practices’’ and includes additional 
protections for Native American voters: 
(1) any change to the method of election to 
(a) add seats elected at-large or (b) convert 
one or more seats elected from a single- 
member district to one or more at-large 
seats or seats from a multi-member district 
in a state or subdivision where ‘‘2 or more 
racial groups or language minority groups 
each represent 20 percent or more of the po-
litical subdivision’s voting-age population’’ 
or ‘‘a single language minority group rep-
resents 20 percent or more of the voting-age 
population on Indian lands located in whole 
or in part in the political subdivision’’; 
(2) any change or series of changes within 
a year to the boundaries of jurisdictions that 
reduces by 3 or more percentage points the 
proportion of the jurisdiction’s voting-age 
population that is comprised of members of a 
single racial group or language minority 
group in a state or subdivision where ‘‘2 or 
more racial groups or language minority 
groups each represent 20 percent or more of 
the political subdivision’s voting-age popu-
lation’’ or ‘‘a single language minority group 
represents 20 percent or more of the voting- 
age population on Indian lands located in 
whole or in part in the political subdivi-
sion’’; 
(3) any change to redistricting in a state or 
subdivision where any racial group or minor-
ity language group that is not the largest ra-
cial group or language minority group in the 
jurisdiction and that represents 15 percent or 
more of the jurisdiction’s voting age popu-
lation experiences a population increase over 
the preceding decade of at least 20 percent of 
its voting-age population in the jurisdiction; 
(4) any change to requirements for docu-
mentation or proof of identity to vote or to 
register to vote such that the requirements 
will exceed or be more stringent than those 
under state law on the day before the date of 
enactment of the John R. Lewis Voting 
Rights Advancement Act of 2021, and, where 
a state imposes an identification require-
ment for receiving and casting a ballot in a 
federal election, if the State does not permit 
the individual to meet the requirement and 
cast a ballot in the election in the same 
manner as an individual who presents identi-
fication by permitting the in-person or vote 
by mail voters to submit a sworn statement 
attesting to their identity and eligibility to 
vote in lieu of identification; 
(5) any change that reduces multilingual 
voting materials or alters the manner in 
which such materials are provided or distrib-
uted, where no similar reduction or alter-
ation 
occurs 
in 
materials 
provided 
in 
English; or 
(6) any change that reduces, consolidates, 
or relocates voting locations, including 
early, absentee, and election-day voting lo-
cations, including early, absentee, and elec-
tion-day voting locations, or reduces days or 
hours of in person voting on any Sunday dur-
ing a period occurring prior to the date of an 
election during which voters may cast bal-
lots in such election, or prohibits the provi-
sion of food or non-alcoholic drink to persons 
waiting to vote in an election except where 
the provision would violate prohibitions on 
expenditures to influence voting: (a) in one 
or more census tracts wherein two or more 
language minority groups or racial groups 
represent 20 percent or more of the voting- 
age population of the political subdivision; 
or 
(b) on Indian lands wherein at least 20 per-
cent of the voting-age population belongs to 
a single language minority group. 
(7) any change to the maintenance of voter 
registration lists that adds a new basis for 
removal from the list of active registered 
voters or that incorporates new sources of 
information in determining a voter’s eligi-
bility to vote, wherein such a change would 
have a statistically significant disparate im-
pact on the removal from voter rolls of mem-
bers of racial groups or language minority 
groups that constitute greater than 5 per-
cent of the voting-age population. This 
would apply only to political subdivisions 
where (a) two or more racial groups or lan-
guage minority groups comprise 20 percent 
each of the voting age population or (b) on 
Indian lands, a single language minority 
group comprises at least 20 percent of the 
voting age population located within the 
subdivision. With respect to states, this pro-
vision would apply to those states with 
where at least 20 percent of the voting age 
population of the state or of a political sub-
division within a state is composed of two or 
more racial groups or language minority 
groups, except the preclearance requirement 
apply only with respect to each such polit-
ical subdivision. 
New 
Section 
4A(c)(1) 
sets 
forth 
a 
preclearance process for the covered prac-
tices described above. A state or political 
subdivision may institute an action in the 
United States District Court for the District 
of Columbia for a declaratory judgment that 
the covered practice ‘‘neither has the pur-
pose nor will have the effect of denying or 
abridging the right to vote on account of 
race, color, or membership in a language mi-
nority group.’’ The covered practice cannot 
be implemented unless and until the court 
enters such judgment. A state or subdivision 
can forego pursuing the described court ac-
tion and implement the covered practice if 
the Attorney General has not interposed an 
objection within 60 days. Section 4A(c)(1) 
provides that the Attorney General or any 
aggrieved citizen may file an action in a U.S. 
district court to compel any state or polit-
ical subdivision to satisfy the preclearance 
requirements. The court must provide in-
junctive relief as a remedy unless the ‘‘vot-
ing qualification or prerequisite to voting, or 
standard, practice, or procedure with respect 
to voting’’ is not a covered practice or the 
State or political subdivision has complied 
with the preclearance requirements. 
New Section 4A(c)(2) provides that any 
covered practice defined in New Section 
4A(b) that has the purpose of effect of dimin-
ishing the ability of citizens to elect their 
preferred candidates of choice on account of 
race, color, or language minority status is 
considered a denial or abridgement of the 
right to vote for purposes of this practice- 
based preclearance provision. 
New Section 4A(c)(3) defines ‘‘purpose’’ as 
used in Section 4A to include any discrimi-
natory purpose. 
New Section 4A(c)(4) defines the purpose of 
Section 4A(c)(2) to protect the ability of citi-
zens to elect their candidate of choice. 
New Section 4A(d) grants authority to the 
Attorney General or a private party to file a 
civil action in federal district court to com-
pel any state or locality to comply with this 
section. Such actions are to be heard before 
a three-judge panel. This subsection requires 
such a court to enjoin the challenged voting 
practice unless the challenged practice is not 
a covered practice or the jurisdiction has 
precleared the challenged practice. 
New Section 4A(e) specifies that the cal-
culation of the population of a racial or lan-
guage minority group must be carried out 
using the methodology outlined in regu-
latory guidance. 
New Section 4A(f) provides that Census Bu-
reau data, whether estimates or actual enu-
merations, cannot be subject to challenge or 
review in court for purposes of any deter-
minations under this section. 
New Section 4A(g) defines ‘‘multilingual 
voting materials’’ as used in this section to 
mean ‘‘registration or voting notices, forms, 
instructions, assistance, or other materials 
or information relating to the electoral proc-
ess, including ballots, provided in the lan-
guage or languages of one or more language 
minority groups.’’ 
Section 7. Promoting Transparency to En-
force the Voting Rights Act. Section 7 adds 
after Section 5 of the VRA a new Section 6. 
New Section 6 imposes new notice and disclo-
sure by states and political subdivisions for 
three voting-related matters, including: (1) 
late breaking voting changes involving fed-
eral elections (e.g., changes in voting stand-
ards or procedures enacted 180 days before a 
federal election); (2) polling resources involv-
ing federal elections (e.g., information con-
cerning precincts/polling places, number of 
voting age and registered voters, voting ma-
chines, and poll workers); and (3) redis-
tricting, reapportionment, and other changes 
in voting districts involving federal, state, 
and local elections. Section 7 of the bill pro-
vides that public notice for each of these 
matters must be in a format that is acces-
sible to voters with disabilities, including 
persons who have low vision or who are 
blind. Section 7 also provides that the right 
to vote of any person shall not be abridged or 
denied because that person failed to comply 
with any voting law change if the state or

political subdivision involved did not meet 
the applicable requirements of this section 
with respect to that change. 
Section 8. Authority to Assign Observers. 
Section 8 of the bill amends Section 8 of the 
VRA. Section 8 of the VRA currently allows 
the Attorney General to certify the need for 
federal election observers in jurisdictions 
covered by the VRA’s coverage formula 
where the Attorney General has received 
‘‘meritorious complaints’’ from residents, 
local officials, or organizations that voting 
violations are likely to occur, or where the 
Attorney General determines that assign-
ment of observers is ‘‘otherwise necessary’’ 
to enforce the Fourteenth or Fifteenth 
Amendment. These observers must be au-
thorized to enter polling places to observe 
whether people who are entitled to vote are 
being permitted to do so, and to observe the 
processes in which votes are tabulated. VRA 
Section 8 gives the Director of the Office of 
Personnel Management the authority to des-
ignate and assign individuals to be observers. 
Section 8 of the bill would expand the set 
of circumstances under which the Attorney 
General may seek to assign election observ-
ers and would transfer control of the ob-
server program from OPM to DOJ. Section 
8(a) of the bill would amend Section 8(a)(2)(b) 
of the VRA to allow the Attorney General to 
certify the need for observers in instances 
where doing so is considered necessary to en-
force statutory provisions of the VRA and 
other federal law protecting citizens’ voting 
rights, rather than solely to enforce the 
Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments. Sec-
tion 8(b) would amend Section 8(a) of the 
VRA to permit the Attorney General to as-
sign election observers in response to writ-
ten meritorious complaints by residents, 
elected officials, or civic participation orga-
nizations that bilingual election require-
ments are likely to occur and if in the Attor-
ney General’s judgment, it is necessary to 
enforce those requirements. Finally, Section 
8(c) of the bill would amend Section 3(a) of 
the Voting Rights Act to transfer the au-
thority to assign and terminate election ob-
servers from OPM to DOJ. 
Section 9. Clarification of Authority to 
Seek Relief. Section 9 amends several provi-
sions of the VRA to add an explicit private 
right of action. Section 9(a) of the bill 
amends Section 10(b) of the VRA. Section 
10(b) currently provides that the Attorney 
General may institute a civil action to en-
force Section 10’s prohibition on the enforced 
payment of poll taxes as a device to impair 
voting rights. Section 9(a) amends this provi-
sion to provide that, in addition to the At-
torney General, there is a private right of ac-
tion for anyone who has been injured by a 
violation of Section 10. 
Section 9(b) of the bill amends Section 
12(d) of the VRA. Section 9(b) of the bill adds 
a new section 12(d)(1) that provides, in addi-
tion to the Attorney General, for an ag-
grieved person to file an action for preven-
tive relief, ‘‘[w]henever there are reasonable 
grounds to believe that any person has im-
plemented or will implement any voting 
qualification or perquisite to voting or 
standard, practice, or procedure that would 
deny any citizen the right to vote’’ in viola-
tion of the 14th, 15th, 19th, 24th, or 26th 
Amendments, the VRA (except for Section 
4A), or another federal law that prohibits 
discrimination in the voting process on the 
basis of race or membership in a minority. 
Section 9(c) of the bill amends Section 204 
of the VRA to provide an explicit private 
right of action whenever ‘‘[t]here are reason-
able grounds to believe that a State or polit-
ical subdivision has engaged in or is about to 
engage in any act or practice’’ prohibited by 
the VRA’s provisions prohibiting the denial 
of the right to vote because of failure to 
comply with any test or device, durational 
residency requirements, or language-minor-
ity status. 
Section 9(d) of the bill amends Section 
301(a)(1) of the VRA to provide an explicit 
private right of action to enforce the 26th 
Amendment, which prohibits states and the 
federal government from denying the right 
to vote to anyone aged 18 and older. 
Section 10. Preventive Relief. Section 10 of 
the bill amends Section 12(d) of the VRA to 
provide a new standard for preliminary relief 
in any action for preventive relief described 
in this subsection. 
Specifically, Section 10 adds new section 
12(d)(2)(A) would require that a court grant 
relief if it determines that the complainant 
has raised a serious question as to whether 
the challenged voting practice violations the 
VRA or the Constitution and, on balance, the 
hardship imposed on the defendant by the 
grant of the relief will be less than the hard-
ship which would be imposed on the plaintiff 
if the relief where not granted. 
Section 10 also adds new Section 12(d)(2)(B) 
would require the court to examine a number 
of factors in making the determination 
under new section 12(d)(2)(A), including (1) 
whether the voting act or practice in effect 
prior to the change was adopted as a remedy 
for a federal court judgment, consent decree, 
or admission regarding race discrimination 
in violation of the 14th or 15th Amendment, 
a violation of the 19th, 24th, or 26th Amend-
ments, a violation of the VRA, or voting dis-
crimination on the basis of race, color, or 
language-minority status in violation of any 
other federal or state law; (2) whether the 
voting act or practice in effect prior to the 
change served as a ground for dismissal or 
settlement of such a claim; (3) whether the 
change was adopted fewer than 180 days be-
fore the date of the election with respect to 
which the change is to take effect; and (4) 
whether the defendant failed to provide 
timely or adequate notice of the adoption of 
the change as required by federal or state 
law. 
Finally, section 10 would also amend sec-
tion 12(d) by adding new section 12(d)(3) 
which deems that a jurisdiction’s inability 
to enforce its voting or elections laws, regu-
lations, policies, or restricting plans, stand-
ing alone, shall not constitute irreparable 
harm to the public interest or to the interest 
of a defendant in an action arising under the 
Constitution or any federal law that pro-
hibits discrimination in the voting process 
on the basis of race or membership in a lan-
guage minority group, for the purposes of de-
termining whether a stay of court or an in-
terlocutory appeal is warranted. 
Section 11. Relief for Violation of Voting 
Rights Laws. Section 11 provides a fix for 
federal courts’ misapplication of the Purcell 
doctrine. 
Under that doctrine, federal courts are 
cautioned not to issue decisions that would 
change election rules ‘‘too close’’ to an elec-
tion. In practice, federal courts have applied 
that doctrine to consistently deny prelimi-
nary injunctions for voting rights plaintiffs 
even when they may have enough evidence 
to demonstrate a substantial likelihood of 
success on the merits. 
Section 11(a)(1) of the bill defines a ‘‘pro-
hibited act or practice’’ as one that violates 
1) the 14th Amendment by creating an undue 
burden on the fundamental right to vote or 
by violating the 14th Amendment’s Equal 
Protection Clause; 2) violates the 15th, 19th, 
24th, or 26th Amendment or a number of 
specified federal voting statutes; 3) or one 
that violates any federal law prohibiting vot-
ing discrimination, including the Americans 
with Disabilities Act. 
Section 11(a)(2) of the bill provides a rule 
of construction stating that noting in this 
section shall be construed to diminish the 
authority of any person to bring an action 
under any federal law. 
Section 11(a)(3) of the bill provides for the 
attorneys’ fees pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1988. 
Section 11(b) prohibits courts from deny-
ing, granting, staying, or vacating the issue 
of equitable relief sought pursuant to an ac-
tion brought under any law listed in sub-
section 11(a) because of proximity of the ac-
tion to an election. Under Section 11(b), the 
exception to this default rule is when the 
party opposing relief demonstrates, through 
clear and convincing evidence, that issuance 
of the relief would be so close in time to the 
election that it would cause irreparable 
harm to the public interest or impose serious 
burdens on the party opposing relief. 
Section 11(b)(1) requires a court to give 
substantial weight to the public interest in 
expanding access to the ballot when review-
ing whether to issue, stay, or vacate the 
grant of equitable relief and provides that 
state’s generalized interest in enforcing its 
enacted laws is not a relevant consideration 
in determining whether relief is warranted. 
Section 11(b)(2) also creates the presump-
tion that the grant of equitable relief close 
to an election would not harm the public in-
terest or burden an opposing party if such re-
lief is sought within 30 days of the adoption 
or reasonable public notice of the challenged 
voting policy or practice, or more than 45 
days before an election. 
Section 11(c)(1) requires a court, when re-
viewing an application for a stay or vacatur 
of equitable relief sought pursuant to a law 
listed in subsection 11(a), to give substantial 
weight to the reliance interests of citizens 
who acted pursuant to the order for equi-
table relief under review. It would also pro-
hibit a court from issuing a stay or vacatur 
order that has the effect of denying or 
abridging the right to vote of any citizen 
who acted in reliance on the underlying 
order being stayed or vacated. 
Section 11(c)(2) prohibits a court from 
issuing a stay or vacatur unless it finds that 
the public intertest will be harmed by the 
continuing operation of the equitable relief 
that has been granted or that compliance 
with such relief will impose serious burdens 
on the party seeking a stay or vacatur such 
that the burdens substantially outweigh the 
benefits to the public interest. In issuing a 
stay or vacatur of equitable relief, a court 
can set aside any factual findings in support 
of such relief only for clear error. 
Section 12. Enforcement of Voting Rights 
By Attorney General. Section 12 of the bill 
amends Section 12 of the VRA by adding at 
the end a new subsection (g). New Subsection 
12(g)(1) provides that whenever the Attorney 
General or a designee has reason to believe 
that any person may be in possession, cus-
tody, or control of any documents relevant 
to an investigation under the VRA or other 
federal voting rights statute, he or she may, 
prior to commencing an action, issue in writ-
ing and serve on such person an order requir-
ing the production of such information. 
New subsection 12(g)(2) set forth the con-
tents of any order issued by the Attorney 
General under new subsection 12(g)(1). 
New subsection 12(g)(3) sets forth the con-
tents of any response to an order issued by 
the Attorney General under new subsection 
12(g)(1). 
New subsection 12(g)(4) sets forth judicial 
proceedings related to an order issued by the 
Attorney General under new subsection 
12(g)(1). 
Section 13. Definitions. Section 13 of the 
bill amends Title I of the VRA by clarifying 
several definitions related to the Native 
American voting population. The defined 
terms include ‘‘Indian,’’ ‘‘Indian Lands,’’ 
‘‘Indian Tribe,’’ ‘‘Tribal Government,’’ and

‘‘Voting-Age Population,’’ which are referred 
to in amended Section 4 of the VRA. 
Section 14. Attorneys’ Fees. Section 14 of 
the bill adds at the end of Section 14(c) of the 
VRA, which provides definitions for the 
Act’s attorneys’ fee provision, a definition 
for ‘‘prevailing party’’ to mean ‘‘a party to 
an action that receives at least some of the 
benefit sought by such action, states a 
colorable claim, and can establish that the 
action was a significant cause of a change to 
the status quo.’’ 
Section 15. Other Technical and Con-
firming Amendments. Section 15 of the bill 
makes technical and conforming amend-
ments to Sections 3(c), 4(f), and 5 of the 
VRA. 
Section 16. Severability. Section 16 adds a 
severability to clause to the bill, providing 
that if any part of the VRAA or any amend-
ments made by the Act, or any application of 
any part of the Act or amendments made by 
the Act, is held to be unconstitutional or is 
otherwise enjoined or unenforceable, the rest 
of the VRAA, and the remainder of the Act 
and any amendments made by this Act, and 
the application of the provisions and amend-
ment to any person or circumstance, and any 
remaining provisions of the VRA, shall not 
be affected by the holding. 
Section 17. Grants to Assist with Notice 
Requirements Under the Voting Rights Act 
of 1965. Section 17(a) requires the Attorney 
General to make grants each fiscal year to 
small jurisdictions who submit applications 
for financial assistance to comply with the 
VRA’s notice requirements. 
Section 17(b) requires a small jurisdiction 
seeking such a grant to file an application to 
the Attorney General containing such infor-
mation as the Attorney General requires. 
Section 17(c) defines a small jurisdiction to 
mean any political subdivisions with a popu-
lation of 10,000 or less. 
MEMORANDUM REGARDING
THE INCLUSION
OF 
CERTAIN PROVISIONS IN H.R. 4, THE ‘‘JOHN 
R. LEWIS VOTING RIGHTS ADVANCEMENT ACT 
OF 2021’’—AUGUST 24, 2021 
I. INTRODUCTION 
The following is an analysis of key provi-
sions included in H.R. 4, the ‘‘John R. Lewis 
Voting Rights Advancement Act of 2021.’’ 
This legislation will strengthen and revi-
talize the Voting Rights Act of 1965 (VRA) in 
the wake of the Supreme Court’s decisions in 
Shelby County v. Holder and Brnovich v. 
Democratic National Committee in light of 
the record developed before the House Judi-
ciary Committee’s Subcommittee on the 
Constitution, Civil Rights, and Civil Lib-
erties (Constitution Subcommittee) over the 
course of six hearings this year and seven 
hearings in the 116th Congress as well as the 
Committee on House Administration’s Elec-
tions Subcommittee. 
H.R. 4 includes provisions addressing the 
following: (1) a geographic coverage formula 
to determine which jurisdictions should be 
subject to the VRA’s preclearance require-
ment that is broad enough to accurately cap-
ture the full extent of contemporary voting 
discrimination while accounting for the fed-
eralism and state sovereignty concerns ex-
pressed by the Court in Shelby County; (2) a 
practice-based coverage formula to com-
plement the geographic coverage formula in 
order to cover jurisdictions where, because of 
demographic changes, the risk of voting dis-
crimination is heightened even in the ab-
sence of a history of voting discrimination 
and to cover practices that are historically 
associated with voting discrimination; (3) a 
statutory standard for vote denial claims 
under Section 2 of the VRA in light of the 
Supreme Court’s recent decision in Brnovich; 
(4) the inclusion of a non-retrogression 
standard in Section 2; (5) the creation of an 
explicit private right of action under the 
VRA; (6) the expansion of the causes of ac-
tion available under the VRA to include vio-
lations of a broader spectrum of voting dis-
crimination-related constitutional and stat-
utory provisions; (7) a revision of the pre-
liminary injunction standard applicable to 
actions under the VRA to make it easier for 
plaintiffs to obtain such relief; (8) a fix for 
federal courts’ misapplication of the Purcell 
doctrine, which counsels courts against 
granting preliminary injunctions or making 
other changes to election rules too close to 
an election; (9) greater notice and trans-
parency requirements; (10) expanded bases 
for the assignment of federal election observ-
ers; and (11) expanded bail-in preclearance 
jurisdiction for federal courts. Congress’s 
constitutional authority to adopt these pro-
visions remains broad even when accounting 
for the terms of the Supreme Court’s deci-
sions in Shelby County and Brnovich. 
II. THE VOTING RIGHTS ACT: A BRIEF SUMMARY 
OF KEY PROVISIONS 
Below is a brief summary of the VRA’s key 
provisions to provide context for under-
standing the legislation’s provisions de-
scribed later in this memorandum. 
Section 2(a) of the VRA applies nationwide 
and prohibits any state or political subdivi-
sion from enacting any ‘‘voting qualification 
or prerequisite to voting or standard, prac-
tice, or procedure . . . in a manner which re-
sults in a denial or abridgement of the right 
of any citizen of the United States to vote on 
account of race or color,’’ or on account of 
‘‘member[ship] [in] a language minority 
group.’’ Section 2 thus prohibits measures 
that are discriminatory in purpose or in ef-
fect. Prohibited measures can include prac-
tices that affect the ability to cast a vote 
(such as through photo ID laws or by closing 
polling places) as well as redistricting that 
dilutes the voting power of minority citi-
zens. 
Section 2(b) of the VRA clarifies how to de-
termine when there is a violation of Section 
2(a) by providing that: ‘‘A violation of sub-
section (a) is established if, based on the to-
tality of the circumstances, it is shown that 
the political processes leading to nomination 
or election in the State or political subdivi-
sion are not equally open to participation by 
members of a class of citizens protected by 
subsection (a) in that its members have less 
opportunity than other members of the elec-
torate to participate in the political process 
and to elect representatives of their choice.’’ 
Section 3(a) of the VRA provides that a 
federal court may authorize the appointment 
of federal election observers by the Director 
of the Office of Personnel Management 
(OPM) to enforce the voting guarantees of 
the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments 
in the context of an enforcement proceeding. 
Section 3(c) of the VRA, known as the 
‘‘bail-in’’ provision, allows courts to retain 
jurisdiction 
to 
supervise 
further 
voting 
changes in jurisdictions where the court has 
found violations of the Fourteenth or Fif-
teenth Amendments. If a jurisdiction is 
‘‘bailed in,’’ it must submit any changes to 
its voting rules and procedures for approval 
either to the court or to DOJ. 
Section 203 was added to the VRA by Con-
gress in 1975 and contains a number of pro-
tections for members of ‘‘language minori-
ties’’ (i.e., non-English speakers). It supple-
ments Section 2 to prohibit voting discrimi-
nation against language minorities, includ-
ing by requiring provision of language assist-
ance to voters. It also added to the 
preclearance coverage formula to include ju-
risdictions that provided English-only voting 
materials where 5% or more of voting-age 
citizens were from a single language minor-
ity. 
Section 4(b) of the VRA, known the ‘‘cov-
erage formula,’’ determined which states or 
political subdivisions are required to submit 
changes to any voting laws for preclearance 
under Section 5 prior to their implementa-
tion. If a state is subject to preclearance, all 
of its political subdivisions are as well. As 
described in detail below, in 2013 the Su-
preme Court invalidated the coverage for-
mula as unconstitutional in Shelby County 
v. Holder. 
Section 
5 
of 
the 
VRA, 
known 
the 
‘‘preclearance provision,’’ requires prior ap-
proval or preclearance of a proposed change 
to any voting law in any states or political 
subdivisions covered under Section 4(b). The 
Supreme Court’s decision in Shelby County 
effectively rendered Section 5 inoperative. A 
covered jurisdiction can comply with Sec-
tion 5 by preclearing a proposed voting law 
change via two methods: administrative or 
judicial review. 
Under administrative review, a covered ju-
risdiction can submit a proposed voting 
change to DOJ. If DOJ affirmatively indi-
cates no objection to the proposed change, or 
if after 60 days DOJ has interposed no objec-
tion, the covered jurisdiction can implement 
the change. 
Under judicial review, a covered jurisdic-
tion can file suit against the United States 
or the Attorney General in the U.S. District 
Court for the District of Columbia for declar-
atory judgment, whereby a three-judge panel 
must be convened to hear the case (and with 
direct appeals to the Supreme Court). Unlike 
in a Section 2 case, in an action brought 
under Section 5, the burden is on the covered 
jurisdiction to establish that it does not vio-
late the substantive prohibition in the 
preclearance provision. 
Section 5 prohibits covered jurisdictions 
from implementing any changes to voting 
rules that have the purpose or effect of deny-
ing or abridging the right to vote on account 
of race, color, or membership in a language 
minority group. This standard is referred to 
as the ‘‘retrogression standard.’’ The Su-
preme Court has interpreted this substantive 
prohibition to mean that a proposed voting 
rule change cannot place minority citizens 
in a worse position to participate in the elec-
toral process or elect a candidate of their 
choice than under the status quo. In this 
way, the standard for establishing whether a 
proposed change must be precleared differs 
from the standard for establishing a viola-
tion under Section 2 of the Act, even though 
the wording appears similar. Under the ret-
rogression 
standard, 
a 
proposed 
voting 
change is entitled to preclearance, even if 
the current electoral system is potentially 
discriminatory under Section 2, so long as 
the change does not further increase the de-
gree of discrimination against minority vot-
ers. 
Sections 4(b) and 5 were originally set to 
expire after 5 years, but Congress reauthor-
ized them several times since the VRA’s 
original enactment in 1965. Congress last re-
authorized the VRA in 2006, when it extended 
these provisions for an additional 25 years. 
Section 8 of the VRA allows DOJ to certify 
the need for federal election observers in 
covered jurisdictions where the Attorney 
General has received ‘‘meritorious com-
plaints’’ from residents, local officials, or or-
ganizations that violations of the VRA are 
likely to occur, or where the Attorney Gen-
eral determines that assignment of observers 
is ‘‘otherwise necessary’’ to enforce the 
Fourteenth or Fifteenth Amendment. These 
observers must be authorized to enter poll-
ing places to observe whether people who are 
entitled to vote are being permitted to do so, 
and to observe the processes in which votes 
are tabulated.

August 24, 2021 
Section 12(d) of the VRA provides the At-
torney General with the authority to insti-
tute a legal action for preventive relief, in-
cluding temporary or permanent injunctions, 
restraining orders, or other relief, whenever 
any person has engaged in, or there are rea-
sonable grounds to believe that any person is 
about to engage in, any violation of the 
VRA. This provision has also been inter-
preted to provide an implied right of action 
for private plaintiffs. 
III. CONGRESS’S CONSTITUTIONAL AUTHORITY TO 
DEVISE
PROTECTIONS
AGAINST
RACIAL
DIS-
CRIMINATION IN VOTING 
Congress has broad constitutional author-
ity to protect voting rights. Specifically, 
this authority is derived from its powers to 
enforce the guarantees of the Fourteenth 
and Fifteenth Amendments. Additionally, 
Congress has the authority to ultimately de-
termine the time, place, or manner of con-
gressional elections under the Elections 
Clause. 
The Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amend-
ments to the Constitution confer authority 
on the Congress to pass laws that regulate 
federal, state, and local elections to protect 
voting rights. Section 1 of the Fourteenth 
Amendment provides that ‘‘[a]ll persons born 
or naturalized in the United States, and sub-
ject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens 
of the United States and of the state wherein 
they reside. No state shall . . . deny to any 
person within its jurisdiction the equal pro-
tection of the laws.’’ Section 2 requires mem-
bers of Congress to be apportioned among 
the states ‘‘according to their respective 
numbers, counting the whole number of per-
sons in each state, excluding Indians not 
taxed.’’ Section 5 vests Congress with the 
‘‘power to enforce, by appropriate legisla-
tion, the provisions of this article.’’ 
The Fifteenth Amendment prohibits racial 
discrimination in the right to vote. Section 
1 of the Amendment provides that ‘‘[t]he 
right of citizens of the United States to vote 
shall not be denied or abridged by the United 
States or by any state on account of race, 
color, or previous condition of servitude.’’ 
Like the Fourteenth Amendment, Section 2 
of the Fifteenth Amendment provides Con-
gress with the ‘‘power to enforce this article 
by appropriate legislation.’’ 
The Elections Clause also provides Con-
gress additional authority to adopt voting 
rights protections. Article I, Section 4, 
Clause 1 of the Constitution provides that 
‘‘[t]he Times, Places and Manner of holding 
Elections for Senators and Representatives, 
shall be prescribed in each State by the Leg-
islature thereof; but the Congress may at 
any time by Law make or alter such Regula-
tions, except as to the Places of chusing Sen-
ators.’’ While the Elections Clause grants 
the States the authority to regulate the 
time, place, and manner for holding elec-
tions for Representatives and Senators, it 
vests Congress with the ultimate authority 
to determine the election ‘‘Regulations’’ for 
those offices, with only one explicit textual 
exception. As the Supreme Court, in an opin-
ion by Justice Antonin Scalia, noted, the 
‘‘Clause’s substantive scope is broad. ‘Time, 
Places, and Manner,’ we have written, are 
‘comprehensive words,’ which ‘embrace au-
thority to provide a complete code for con-
gressional elections.’ ’’ 
The Supreme Court’s earlier decisions up-
holding the constitutionality of the VRA ap-
pear to have understood Congress’s constitu-
tional authority to protect voting rights in 
broad terms. In South Carolina v. Katzen-
bach, the first case to uphold the VRA and 
its preclearance regime, the Court appeared 
to apply a ‘‘rationality’’ test for measures 
enacted to enforce the Fifteenth Amend-
ment, noting that Congress need only show 
that it had a legitimate end in adopting that 
law and that the means to achieve that ‘‘are 
plainly adapted to that end.’’ The Supreme 
Court decided Katzenbach in 1966 and main-
tained the same standard of review for the 
VRA’s preclearance provisions, despite sev-
eral challenges, and, at least as to the scope 
of Congress’s Fifteenth Amendment author-
ity, Katzenbach remains in effect. 
One caveat as to the scope of congressional 
authority over voting rights legislation has 
arisen due to Supreme Court interpretations 
of Congress’s authority under the Four-
teenth Amendment. In a series of cases 
starting in the late 1990’s that were unre-
lated to voting rights, the Court began to 
place limits on Congress’s ability to adopt 
legislation enforcing the Fourteenth Amend-
ment’s guarantees. In City of Boerne v. Flo-
res, the Court struck down as unconstitu-
tional as applied to states the Religious 
Freedom Restoration Act, a statute that 
Congress passed to enhance protections for 
religious minorities and other minority 
groups. It did so based on an interpretation 
of Section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment 
that viewed Congress’s authority to enact 
legislation as primarily remedial in nature. 
Given this remedial nature, the Court con-
cluded that congressional action in this area 
had to be congruent and proportional to the 
injury being addressed. The ‘‘congruence and 
proportionality’’ test adopted by the Court 
has raised some question as to the scope of 
Congress’s authority to adapt voting rights 
legislation—particularly with respect to lan-
guage minorities—given the similarities in 
wording between Section 5 of the Fourteenth 
Amendment and Section 2 of the Fifteenth 
Amendment. 
Nonetheless, existing precedent continues 
to establish Congress’s broad authority to 
adopt legislation to protect voters against 
racial discrimination. As noted, the Court 
has not overturned Katzenbach or related 
cases upholding the VRA’s preclearance 
scheme and the substantial deference that 
the Court gave to Congress’s exercise of its 
authority to pass legislation enforcing the 
Fifteenth Amendment. Thus, Congress can 
continue to adopt legislation that is ration-
ally related to its authority to protect 
against voter discrimination. 
The Elections Clause also remains an oft- 
overlooked source of congressional authority 
to prescribe voting rights protections— 
though its reach is limited to federal elec-
tions. Professor Franita Tolson previously 
testified twice on the subject of Congress’s 
authority to protect voting rights under the 
Elections Clause. In her testimony, Professor 
Tolson argued that enacting protections pur-
suant to the Elections Clause provides sev-
eral benefits as it ‘‘avoids many of the traps 
that have constrained congressional power 
under the Reconstruction Amendments.’’ 
She observed that because it ‘‘depriv[es] 
states of the final policymaking authority 
that is the hallmark of sovereignty, the 
[Elections] Clause is impervious to the fed-
eralism concerns that have constrained con-
gressional action under the Fourteenth and 
Fifteenth 
Amendments.’’ 
Moreover, 
Pro-
fessor Tolson noted that the Elections 
Clause is further distinguished from the Re-
construction Amendments because it ‘‘does 
not require any evidence of discriminatory 
intent in order for Congress to intervene, 
providing further justification for a legisla-
tive record that shows that states acted with 
discriminatory effect or in ways that other-
wise abridge or deny the right to vote.’’ 
Finally, Article IV’s Guarantee Clause 
may provide Congress additional authority 
to protect minority voting rights as a means 
of ensuring the guarantee that every state 
has a republican form of government. That 
Clause requires that the ‘‘United States shall 
guarantee to every State in this Union a Re-
publican Form of Government, and shall pro-
tect each of them against Invasion; and on 
Application of the Legislature, or of the Ex-
ecutive (when the Legislature cannot be con-
vened) against domestic Violence.’’ 
IV. KEY ISSUES ADDRESSED BY H.R. 4 
A. New Geographic Coverage Formula to Revi-
talize Section 5 Preclearance Post-Shelby 
County 
On June 25, 2013, in Shelby County v. Hold-
er, the Supreme Court struck down as uncon-
stitutional the coverage formula in Section 
4(b) of the VRA, effectively neutering the 
Act’s Section 5 preclearance provision. Cit-
ing its decision in an earlier case called 
Northwest Austin Municipal Utility District 
One v. Holder, the Supreme Court held that 
Congress must justify the unequal burdens 
placed on state sovereignty by the VRA’s 
preclearance 
regime 
based 
on 
‘‘current 
needs’’ and that it had to demonstrate that 
the coverage formula was ‘‘sufficiently re-
lated to the problem that it targets.’’ The 
Court emphasized the principle of ‘‘equal 
sovereignty’’ of the states, highlighting that 
‘‘a departure from the fundamental principle 
of equal sovereignty requires a showing that 
a statute’s disparate geographic coverage is 
sufficiently related to the problem that it 
targets.’’ In other words, the Court believed 
that Congress was required to further justify 
the coverage formula because it applied the 
burden of the VRA’s preclearance require-
ment to some states but not others. 
The Court struck down the VRA’s coverage 
formula based on its conclusion that Con-
gress had failed to demonstrate that the cov-
erage formula—first enacted in 1965—was 
sufficiently connected to the present condi-
tion of voting rights in the covered states, 
and because Congress could not justify the 
disparate 
burdens 
placed 
by 
VRA’s 
preclearance provision on the sovereignty of 
some states and not others. 
Significantly, the Court invited Congress 
to ‘‘draft another formula based on current 
conditions.’’ The Court went on to note that, 
‘‘[o]ur country has changed, and while any 
racial discrimination in voting is too much, 
Congress must ensure that the legislation it 
passes to remedy that problem speaks to cur-
rent conditions.’’ 
To that end, H.R. 4 includes a geographic 
coverage formula that would cover jurisdic-
tions as follows. A state and all political sub-
divisions in that state would be covered for 
10 years if, looking back 25 years, there were 
15 or more violations in that state, or if 
there were 10 or more violations in that 
state if at least one of those violations was 
committed by the state itself (as opposed to 
a political subdivision). A state is also cov-
ered if there are 3 or more violations in that 
state when the state itself controls elections 
in the state or its political subdivisions. Sep-
arately, a political subdivision could be cov-
ered for 10 years if it committed 3 or more 
violations in the preceding 25 years. Drawing 
from Shelby County, any coverage formula 
must reflect current needs, though the Court 
left unanswered the question of how ‘‘cur-
rent’’ is sufficiently ‘‘current.’’ The formula 
in H.R. 4 reasonably meets this test because 
it is a dynamic and self-updating formula, 
and preclearance coverage would only last 
for 10 years for any given jurisdiction, there-
by always reflecting contemporary condi-
tions. Moreover, the 25–year lookback period 
reflects two redistricting cycles and six pres-
idential elections, enough to ensure that the 
coverage formula only captures jurisdictions 
that have engaged in a pattern of voting dis-
crimination, rather than those that may 
have committed a ‘‘one-off’’ violation. 
B. Practice-Based Coverage 
‘‘Known practices coverage,’’ also known 
as practice-based preclearance, is a form of

preclearance coverage formula that applies 
to certain voting law changes that have his-
torically been associated with racial dis-
crimination. This is distinct from geo-
graphic-based preclearance, under which cov-
erage is determined based on a jurisdiction’s 
history of voting rights violations. One po-
tential drawback of a geographic-based cov-
erage formula is that it does not cover juris-
dictions with significant emerging minority 
populations, where the risk of voter suppres-
sion efforts against such populations is 
heightened but there is no documented his-
tory of voting rights violations. 
This has proven to be problematic as juris-
dictions that do not have a documented his-
tory of voting rights violations have none-
theless responded to surges in the minority 
population by turning to practices histori-
cally utilized to discriminate against or dis-
enfranchise minority voters. Practice-based 
preclearance addresses this gap in coverage 
by subjecting certain specific practices with 
a proven historical association with dis-
crimination to preclearance. Moreover, such 
a practice-based coverage formula could be 
limited in some instances to those jurisdic-
tions that, based on demographic changes, 
are most likely to engage in voter suppres-
sion efforts. Unlike the VRA’s currently 
defunct preclearance coverage formula, prac-
tice-based 
preclearance 
would 
apply 
to 
states and localities nationwide and not just 
to certain states and political subdivisions. 
As such, H.R. 4 includes a practice-based 
preclearance regime to supplement geo-
graphic-based 
preclearance. 
Specifically, 
H.R. 4 includes a practice-based preclearance 
provision that covered jurisdictions engaged 
in one of several categories of practices, in-
cluding changes to voter ID requirements to 
be more stringent and changes to multi-
lingual voting materials when no such simi-
lar change occurs in materials provided in 
English. Other categories of voting proce-
dures 
and 
practices 
are 
subject 
to 
preclearance only in political subdivisions 
where certain demographic thresholds are 
met. For instance, changing from single 
member districts to at-large elections, redis-
tricting, and the consolidation or relocation 
of polling places could be covered practices 
subject 
to 
preclearance 
in 
jurisdictions 
where two or more racial groups or language 
minority groups make up 20 percent or more 
of a political subdivision’s voting-age popu-
lation. 
C. Clarifying Section 2 In Response to Brnovich 
v. Democratic National Committee 
Prior to 2013, Section 2 had largely been 
used to challenge state and local efforts that 
resulted in the dilution of the effectiveness 
of minority citizens’ votes, rather than in 
the outright denial of the ability to vote. 
These ‘‘vote dilution’’ cases mostly concern 
challenges to the drawing of legislative dis-
tricts or at-large voting systems. In Thorn-
burg v. Gingles, the Supreme Court outlined 
a non-exhaustive list of factors that a court 
should consider in determining whether, 
under the totality of the circumstances, a 
challenged voting rule violated Section 2’s 
‘‘results test’’ as established under sub-
section 2(b). In evaluating these ‘‘vote dilu-
tion’’ claims, courts were required to apply 
the Gingles factors, which were geared to-
ward consideration of such ‘‘vote dilution’’ 
claims. 
Since 2013, in the effective absence of 
preclearance in the wake of Shelby County, 
voting rights plaintiffs have been forced to 
rely on Section 2 litigation to challenge dis-
criminatory voting rules after they had been 
implemented. These kinds of claims were 
‘‘vote denial’’ claims—i.e., those claims al-
leging that the discriminatory effect of a 
voting rule or practice was such that it effec-
tively denied minority citizens the equal op-
portunity to vote compared to non-minority 
citizens. Until the Brnovich decision, the Su-
preme Court had never addressed how a 
court should assess ‘‘vote denial’’ claims 
under Section 2’s results test, partly because 
there were relatively few such cases while 
preclearance was in effect. 
In the absence of Supreme Court guidance, 
a number of federal appeals courts had at-
tempted to articulate how the results test 
would apply to vote denial claims under Sec-
tion 2. For example, the Fourth, Fifth, Sixth 
and Ninth Circuits articulated a two-part 
test: (1) the challenged voting rule must im-
pose a discriminatory burden on members of 
the protected class, meaning that they have 
less opportunity than other members of the 
electorate to participate in the political 
process and to elect representatives of their 
choice; and (2) the burden must in part be 
caused by or linked to social and historical 
conditions that have or currently produce 
discrimination against members of the pro-
tected class. 
On July 1, 2021, the Supreme Court decided 
the consolidated case of Brnovich v. Demo-
cratic National Committee and Arizona Re-
publican Party v. Democratic National Com-
mittee. In a divided 6–3 opinion authored by 
Justice Samuel Alito and joined by Chief 
Justice John Roberts and Justices Clarence 
Thomas, Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh, 
and Amy Coney Barrett, the Court upheld 
two Arizona measures challenged under Sec-
tion 2 of the VRA. One challenged measure 
required that voters cast their ballots in 
their assigned precinct, and any ballots cast 
out of precinct had to be discarded. The 
other measure at issue was a criminal stat-
ute making it a felony for a third party to 
collect early ballots from voters (described 
by some as ‘‘ballot harvesting’’). Plaintiffs 
had alleged that these voting rules violated 
Section 2’s results test and that the third- 
party ballot collection statute also was mo-
tivated by a discriminatory purpose. 
At issue in the case was not just the legal-
ity of the two challenged Arizona measures, 
but the impact that the Court’s decision may 
have on future Section 2 vote denial claims 
alleging that a facially neutral voting prac-
tice governing the time, place, or manner of 
an election denied the right of minority citi-
zens to vote. The full impact of the Court’s 
decision on these types of Section 2 vote de-
nial claims remains to be seen, but it ap-
pears from initial analyses that the Brnovich 
decision will significantly curtail plaintiffs’ 
ability to bring or prove such claims, which 
could be especially problematic in the effec-
tive absence of preclearance. 
Although the majority in Brnovich ex-
pressly disclaimed the notion that it was 
creating a new and narrow results test for 
assessing Section 2 vote denial claims, it set 
forth what it characterized as ‘‘guideposts’’ 
for considering such claims, all of which, in-
dividually and taken together, significantly 
narrowed the scope of Section 2 for vote de-
nial claims and will make it harder for fu-
ture Section 2 vote denial claims to prevail 
using the existing results test. In the major-
ity’s view, the interpretive touchstone for 
Section 2’s statutory language is the term 
‘‘equally open’’ as used in Section 2 and that 
in evaluating whether a plaintiff has estab-
lished a violation under Section 2 (i.e., that 
the challenged practice ‘‘results in’’ dis-
crimination), a court must examine the ju-
risdiction’s entire election system from a ho-
listic perspective to determine whether vot-
ing is ‘‘equally open’’ to minorities. 
In her dissent, Justice Elena Kagan, joined 
by Justices Stephen Breyer and Sonia 
Sotomayor, sharply criticized the majority 
opinion, writing that ‘‘Section 2 of the 
[VRA] remains, as written, as expansive as 
ever’’ and accusing the Court of crafting ‘‘its 
own set of rules, limiting Section 2 from 
multiple directions’’ and giving ‘‘a cramped 
reading to broad language.’’ Justice Kagan 
further found it ‘‘tragic . . . that the Court 
has (yet again) rewritten—in order to weak-
en—a statute that stands as a monument to 
America’s greatness, and protects against its 
basest impulses.’’ 
In Justice Kagan’s reading, Section 2: (1) 
applies to any voting rule; (2) prohibits both 
denial and abridgement of a citizen’s voting 
rights based on race; (3) requires a court to 
focus its inquiry on the effects of a chal-
lenged voting rule and whether that rule re-
sults in racial discrimination, not on the 
reasons why public officials enacted that 
rule; (4) concerns itself with discrimination 
that results in inequality of the opportunity 
to vote, which can arise from facially neu-
tral rules and not just targeted ones; (5) is 
violated when an election rule, operating 
against the backdrop of historical, social, 
and economic conditions, makes it harder for 
minority citizens to vote than for others; 
and (6) requires the state or locality impos-
ing the challenged rule to show that any 
strong governmental interest justifying the 
challenged rule is the least discriminatory 
rule necessary to satisfy the state interest. 
In short, Justice Kagan wrote, Section 2 di-
rects courts ‘‘to eliminate facially neutral 
(as well as targeted) electoral rules that un-
necessarily create inequalities of access to 
the political process.’’ 
Although Brnovich is a deeply troubling 
decision, one silver lining to the decision is 
that it left Congress with the authority to 
respond with a legislative fix for the damage 
that the Court has inflicted on Section 2. Be-
cause the Court’s decision is based on its in-
terpretation of a statute drafted by Con-
gress, rather than on constitutional prin-
ciples restricting Congress’s authority to 
legislate, Congress can amend Section 2 to 
reverse the Court’s decision in Brnovich. 
There were at least three potential ap-
proaches to ‘‘fixing’’ the issues created by 
the Brnovich decision that were considered. 
All three would essentially create a separate 
standard for courts to apply when evaluating 
vote denial (the situation in Brnovich) and 
vote dilution claims under Section 2. 
Under the approach ultimately included in 
H.R. 4, Congress clarifies that as to vote di-
lution claims, courts must continue to apply 
the framework of the Gingles decision to 
such claims. The legislation then creates a 
separate test for courts to apply to vote de-
nial claims that would require a plaintiff to 
prove a violation of Section 2(a) by estab-
lishing that the challenged voting practice 
imposes a discriminatory burden on mem-
bers of a class of citizens protected by Sec-
tion 2(a). Under this standard, the bill codi-
fies a separate set of detailed factors that 
courts 
must 
consider 
when 
evaluating 
whether, under the totality of the cir-
cumstances, the challenged voting practice 
‘‘results in’’ a discriminatory burden—while 
also precluding courts from considering the 
‘‘guideposts’’ described by the court in 
Brnovich. 
Other possible approaches that were con-
sidered but not ultimately included would 
have involved creating a burden-shifting test 
for vote denial claims under Section 2. Like 
the previous approach, this approach would 
have largely preserved Section 2(b) as ap-
plied to vote dilution claims, which were not 
at issue in Brnovich. Under one potential 
burden-shifting approach for vote denial 
claims, a plaintiff could establish a prima 
facie case by demonstrating that a chal-
lenged voting rule or practice interacts with 
historical and socioeconomic factors to ‘‘re-
sult in’’ a disparate burden on the opportuni-
ties enjoyed by members of a class of citizens

protected by Section 2(a) to participate in 
the political process relative to other mem-
bers of the electorate. The burden then shifts 
to the defendant jurisdiction to demonstrate 
by clear and convincing evidence that the 
challenged rule is specifically tailored to 
materially advance an important and par-
ticularized government interest. If the state 
or political subdivision meets its burden, the 
burden would then shift to the plaintiff to 
show by a preponderance of the evidence 
that the state or political subdivision could 
have 
implemented 
a 
procedure 
that 
furthered the government’s interest through 
a less burdensome means. 
Similarly, a third potential approach that 
was considered but not ultimately included 
was suggested by Professor Nick Stephan-
opoulos, who appeared before the Constitu-
tion Subcommittee at its hearing held on 
July 16, 2021. His proposal would import the 
disparate impact standard used in other 
areas of civil rights law for vote denial 
claims. Under his proposed standard for vote 
denial claims, a plaintiff would have to show 
that an electoral practice causes a statis-
tically significant racial disparity. If the 
plaintiff meets that burden, then the burden 
would shift to the jurisdiction that imposed 
the challenged practice to demonstrate that 
the practice is necessary to achieve a strong 
state interest. The burden would then shift 
back to the plaintiff to demonstrate that the 
interest could be achieved through less dis-
criminatory means, suggesting that the 
state’s asserted interest was pretextual. 
D. Section 2 Retrogression Standard 
As noted earlier, the substantive standard 
applied when assessing a proposed voting 
change under the Section 5 preclearance re-
gime is the retrogression standard—i.e., 
whether the proposed voting change makes 
minority citizens worse off than the status 
quo in terms of their ability to vote. If the 
proposed change is retrogressive, then it can-
not be precleared. 
H.R. 4 imports this substantive standard 
into Section 2 to apply to cases where an al-
ready-enacted voting law or rule has a retro-
gressive effect. In such cases, a Section 2 ret-
rogression standard would help to prevent 
the harm of retrogression in the absence of 
preclearance in non-covered jurisdictions. 
This measure also provides an additional 
basis for finding a Section 2 violation. 
E. Enhancing Section 3(c) Bail-in Jurisdiction 
Section 3(c) of the VRA, known as the 
‘‘bail-in’’ provision, allows courts to retain 
jurisdiction 
to 
supervise 
further 
voting 
changes in jurisdictions where the court has 
found violations of the Fourteenth or Fif-
teenth Amendments. If a jurisdiction is 
‘‘bailed in,’’ it must submit any changes to 
its voting procedures for approval either to 
the court or to the DOJ. In practice, how-
ever, plaintiffs face a high, perhaps insur-
mountable, burden in proving violations as 
federal courts have determined that Section 
3(c) requires a finding of intentional dis-
crimination. Thus, a jurisdiction may have a 
history of VRA violations due to imple-
menting voting laws with a discriminatory 
effect, but because there may not have been 
a constitutional violation, which requires a 
showing of discriminatory intent, courts 
cannot invoke Section 3(c) to subject a juris-
diction to preclearance as a remedy. Addi-
tionally, even when there is substantial evi-
dence that government officials were moti-
vated by discriminatory intent, courts have 
proven reluctant to find that such officials 
engaged in purposeful discrimination. More-
over, since the Shelby County decision, some 
courts have suggested that not all violations 
of the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amend-
ments support Section 3(c) bail-in coverage. 
For these reasons, courts have rarely in-
voked their authority under Section 3(c) to 
impose bail-in preclearance on a jurisdiction. 
As a result, H.R. 4 enhances the ‘‘bail-in’’’ 
provision in Section 3(c) of the VRA by per-
mitting courts to impose a preclearance re-
quirement on a case-by-case basis on juris-
dictions where there have been violations of 
the VRA and other federal statutory prohibi-
tions against discrimination in voting—in 
addition to instances where there have been 
violations of the Fourteenth or Fifteenth 
Amendment. This gives federal courts more 
flexibility and opportunity to impose bail-in 
preclearance on a jurisdiction while avoiding 
the federalism concerns that the Supreme 
Court articulated in Shelby County, given 
the remedial and case-by-case nature of bail- 
in coverage. 
F. Promoting Transparency to Enforce the Vot-
ing Rights Act 
Beyond effectively gutting the VRA’s 
preclearance mechanism, the Shelby County 
decision also undermined the ability of DOJ 
and the general public to have notice of any 
changes to voting laws, policies, or proce-
dures. In addition to being an effective en-
forcement 
mechanism, 
preclearance 
had 
functioned as an effective notice regime. To 
address this lack of transparency post- 
Shelby County, the legislation imposes a no-
tice and disclosure requirement on states 
and political subdivisions for three voting- 
related matters, including: (1) late breaking 
voting changes involving federal elections 
(e.g., changes in voting standards or proce-
dures enacted 180 days before a federal elec-
tion); (2) polling resources involving federal 
elections (e.g., information concerning pre-
cincts/polling places, number of voting age 
and registered voters, voting machines, and 
poll workers); and (3) redistricting, reappor-
tionment, and other changes in voting dis-
tricts involving federal, state, and local elec-
tions. The legislation also ensures that pub-
lic notice for each of these matters must be 
in a format that is accessible to voters with 
disabilities such as those who have low vi-
sion or who are blind. This type of reporting 
requirement imposes a low burden on states 
and plainly bears a logical relation to facili-
tating Congress’s ability to ensure proper en-
forcement of the law. 
G. Expanding the Authority to Assign Federal 
Elections Observers 
Under Section 8, the Attorney General can 
certify the need for OPM to assign federal 
observers to jurisdictions covered by Section 
5 of the VRA when the Attorney General ‘‘re-
ceived written meritorious complaints . . . 
that efforts to deny or abridge the right to 
vote . . . on account of race or color . . . are 
likely to occur’’ or when the Attorney Gen-
eral considered the assignment of observers 
‘‘necessary to enforce the guarantees of the 
14th or 15th amendment.’’ These observers 
are authorized to ‘‘(1) enter and attend at 
any place for holding an election in such sub-
division for the purpose of observing whether 
persons who are entitled to vote are being 
permitted to vote; and (2) enter and attend 
at any place for tabulating the votes cast at 
any election held in such subdivision for the 
purpose of observing whether votes cast by 
persons entitled to vote are being properly 
tabulated.’’ They are also authorized to con-
duct investigations and report to the Attor-
ney General. Additionally, under Section 3(a) 
of the VRA, federal courts are also currently 
empowered to authorize the appointment of 
federal observers by OPM to enforce the vot-
ing guarantees of the Fourteenth and Fif-
teenth Amendments. 
As Jon Greenbaum, Chief Counsel for the 
Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights Under 
Law, noted in his testimony before the Con-
stitution Subcommittee at a hearing in May 
2021, an oft overlooked side effect of the 
Shelby County decision is the reduced num-
ber of federal observer appointments under 
Section 8 of the VRA. DOJ has interpreted 
the Shelby County decision as barring the 
use of the coverage formula to send observ-
ers under Section 8 of the VRA. In place of 
full-fledged observers, DOJ has relied on 
‘‘monitors’’ to ensure that jurisdictions with 
a history of discriminatory voting practices 
hold elections in a fair manner that does not 
disenfranchise 
minority 
voters. 
Unfortu-
nately, these monitors do not possess the 
same authority as an observer, and as such 
jurisdictions are not required to provide 
them the same access to the voting process 
as observers. Moreover, when operating as 
intended, the authority of the Attorney Gen-
eral and federal courts to appoint observers 
under the VRA is generally limited to cir-
cumstances where such observers are nec-
essary to enforce the Fourteenth and Fif-
teenth Amendments. 
In order to address this problem, H.R. 4 ex-
pands the circumstances under which both 
federal courts and the Attorney General 
could certify the need for federal election ob-
servers under Sections 3(a) and 8 of the VRA, 
respectively. Section 3(a) is amended to per-
mit federal courts to have observers assigned 
where there are violations of the VRA or any 
other federal law prohibiting discrimination 
in voting on the basis of race, color, or lan-
guage minority status, supplementing its au-
thority to do so to enforce the voting guar-
antees of the Fourteenth and Fifteenth 
Amendments. Similarly, the Attorney Gen-
eral’s authority to certify the need for ob-
servers is expanded to include instances 
when they are considered necessary to en-
force statutory provisions prohibiting race, 
color, or language-minority discrimination 
in voting and for the purpose of enforcing bi-
lingual election requirements. 
The legislation also amends the VRA so 
that the Attorney General, rather than OPM, 
is authorized to control the appointment and 
termination of federal election observers. 
This is intended to ease administrative bur-
dens on OPM and improve the appointment 
process, given that DOJ possesses the voting 
rights expertise necessary to evaluate can-
didates’ suitability to act as observers 
H. Strengthening the Effectiveness of VRA En-
forcement Actions 
As noted by many Majority witnesses at 
most of the hearings before the Constitution 
Subcommittee regarding the VRA, Section 2 
litigation has many drawbacks, including 
the time, expense, and drain on resources 
that such litigation entails. Most signifi-
cantly, these witnesses noted that the big-
gest drawback to Section 2 litigation is that 
it is difficult, if not impossible, to stop the 
harm to voters that a discriminatory voting 
law, policy, or practice can inflict before 
such a measure is implemented. Being able 
to stop harm to voters before a discrimina-
tory voting measure took effect was one of 
the primary benefits of preclearance. 
Part of the problem for those seeking to 
vindicate their rights under the VRA using 
Section 2 litigation is that because courts 
are reluctant to grant a preliminary injunc-
tion and voting rights litigation is often 
lengthy, several elections for federal, state, 
and local offices could occur under voting 
laws or procedures that are later found by 
the court to be discriminatory. Thus, thou-
sands of minority voters often remain 
disenfranchised before a court renders a deci-
sion on the merits of a case brought under 
Section 2. 
For example, one witness testified during 
the 116th Congress that ‘‘Section 2 cases 
take a substantial amount of time to liti-
gate, leaving discriminatory voting practices 
in place for months or years before they are

August 24, 2021 
ultimately blocked or rescinded,’’ with the 
average time to fully litigate a case to reso-
lution being more than a year and a half. 
Furthermore, he testified that because elec-
tions take place during the time that Sec-
tion 2 litigation is pending, ‘‘government of-
ficials are often elected under election re-
gimes that are later found to be discrimina-
tory—and there is no way to adequately 
compensate victims of voting discrimination 
after-the-fact.’’ As an example, he cited the 
ACLU’s litigation challenging a sprawling 
North Carolina voter suppression law, which 
took 34 months to litigate from filing the 
complaint to a ruling by the U.S. Court of 
Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, with the 2014 
general election taking place in the interim. 
As he noted, ‘‘almost 200 federal and state of-
ficials in North Carolina were elected under 
a discriminatory regime that the Fourth Cir-
cuit found ‘target[ed] African Americans 
with almost surgical precision’ ’’ and that al-
though the law was ultimately struck down, 
‘‘there is no way to now compensate the Af-
rican-American voters of North Carolina—or 
our democracy itself—for that gross injus-
tice.’’ 
To address these drawbacks inherent to 
Section 2 litigation, H.R. 4 strengthens the 
ability of Attorney General and private par-
ties to bring enforcement actions by amend-
ing the VRA to enhance the standard for pre-
liminary injunctions; to address federal 
courts undue reliance on the Purcell prin-
ciple when considering whether to grant eq-
uitable relief; to expand the scope of the ex-
isting cause of action available under the 
VRA; and to grant private parties an explicit 
private right of action to obtain equitable 
relief. 
1. Enhancing the Standard for Preliminary 
Injunctions 
The legislation amends the VRA to en-
hance the standard for preliminary injunc-
tions by requiring a court considering a pre-
liminary injunction motion in Section 2 
cases to grant injunctive relief to the plain-
tiff if the court determines that the plaintiff 
has raised a ‘‘serious question’’ regarding the 
lawfulness of the challenged voting rule or 
practice, and if the court determines that 
the balance of interests and hardships favors 
the plaintiff. 
This standard departs from the traditional 
standard for obtaining a preliminary injunc-
tion, under which a plaintiff must show that 
he or she ‘‘is likely to succeed on the mer-
its’’ and is likely to suffer ‘‘irreparable 
harm’’ absent an injunction and must dem-
onstrate that the overall balance of interests 
tilts in his or her favor. The Supreme Court, 
however, has repeatedly held that Congress 
may alter common-law standards for seeking 
equitable relief so long as the ‘‘alternative 
comports with constitutional due process,’’ 
particularly in cases presenting issues of 
public interest. 
2. Addressing the Purcell Principle 
Compounding the difficulties and relative 
ineffectiveness of relying solely on Section 2 
litigation are some federal courts’ undue re-
liance on what is known as the Purcell prin-
ciple, named for the Supreme Court decision 
in which it was articulated, Purcell v. Gon-
zalez. Briefly stated, the Purcell principle 
holds that courts should not change election 
rules in the time period close to an election 
because it could cause voter confusion or 
problems for election administration offi-
cials. 
As Professor Justin Levitt noted in his 
September 2019 testimony, ‘‘[r]esponsive liti-
gation often features substantial discovery 
battles and extended motion practice, all of 
which often precedes the awarding of even 
preliminary relief. Such preliminary relief, 
according to experienced litigators, is itself 
quite rare in affirmative voting rights litiga-
tion, under the existing standard.’’ Professor 
Levitt further noted that the rarity of pre-
liminary injunctive relief ‘‘only increases in 
the period shortly before an election—when 
immediate rulings are most necessary to 
prevent harm—based in part on the Supreme 
Court’s admonishment that the judiciary 
should be particularly wary of enjoining en-
acted electoral rules under traditional equi-
table standards when there is ‘inadequate 
time to resolve . . . factual disputes’ before 
the election proceeds.’’ 
The legislation addresses this problem by 
amending the VRA to require a court evalu-
ating any action for equitable relief under 
Section 2 to shift the burden on to the juris-
dictions opposing the requested relief to 
prove that compliance with such relief would 
be too burdensome. Courts are required to 
not consider the proximity of the action to 
an election to be a valid reason to grant or 
deny such relief, unless the party opposing 
the relief—typically a State or political sub-
division thereof—meets the burden of prov-
ing by clear and convincing evidence that 
the issuance of the relief would be so close in 
time to the election as to cause irreparable 
harm to the public interest or that compli-
ance with such relief would impose serious 
burdens on the opposing party. 
3. Empowering Private Parties by Providing 
an Explicit Cause of Action 
Currently, the VRA expressly authorizes 
only the Attorney General to seek preven-
tive relief, including preliminary injunc-
tions. Although federal courts have inter-
preted the VRA to provide private parties 
the ability to seek such preventive relief, 
some courts have begun to express doubt 
about whether such a cause of action exists, 
including Justice Gorsuch in a concurring 
opinion in the Brnovich case. To address this 
problem, the legislation explicitly provides 
for a private right of action under the VRA, 
as H.R. 4 from the 116th Congress did. 
V. THE CONTINUING NEED FOR A REVITALIZED 
VOTING RIGHTS ACT 
A. Congressional Consideration of Voter Sup-
pression Efforts Post-Shelby County 
During the 116th Congress, two subcommit-
tees, the Committee on the Judiciary’s Sub-
committee on the Constitution, Civil Rights, 
and Civil Liberties and the Committee on 
House Administration’s Subcommittee on 
Elections, conducted a series of hearings to 
examine the landscape of voting in America 
following the Supreme Court’s decision in 
Shelby County v. Holder, current barriers to 
voting, and potential remedies. During these 
hearings, Congress heard testimony from 
leading civil rights advocates and organiza-
tions that described a process akin to evo-
lution whereby State and local efforts to dis-
criminate against minority voters have 
changed over time in response to federal ef-
forts to provide a remedy. Accordingly, wit-
ness testimony described these barriers to 
voting in terms of ‘‘generations’’ to best cap-
ture the fact that voter discrimination con-
tinues to persist over time despite changing 
form. 
‘‘First generation’’ barriers: These barriers 
include poll taxes, literacy tests, and other 
devices meant to overtly disenfranchise ra-
cial minorities by preventing them from reg-
istering and voting. States and localities en-
acted them following the end of the Recon-
struction Era. The VRA was initially passed 
to address these barriers. 
‘‘Second generation’’ barriers: These bar-
riers include racially gerrymandering elec-
toral districts, adopting at-large election 
districts instead of smaller, single-member 
individual electoral districts, and annexing 
another political subdivision. States and lo-
calities enacted these barriers to blunt the 
impact of minority voters on the outcome of 
an election by diluting or underrepresenting 
the strength of minority voters. The VRA 
was amended by Congress to forbid these 
practices, though they remain a threat to 
voting rights today. 
‘‘Third generation’’ barriers: These bar-
riers include adopting procedures to make 
registering to vote more difficult for lan-
guage minorities, placing burdensome re-
strictions on third-party voter registration 
activities, moving or closing down polling 
places to increase the difficulty for minori-
ties to vote, and enacting voter ID laws. 
These barriers are designed to make voting 
more onerous for minority voters. 
Over the course of these hearings, the wit-
nesses presented extensive evidence sup-
porting the conclusion that voter discrimi-
nation remains a persistent problem. Fur-
thermore, the Constitution Subcommittee 
heard testimony that the Supreme Court’s 
decision in Shelby County has allowed these 
evolving barriers to minority voting to pro-
liferate further. 
At the time of the hearings, at least 23 
states had enacted restrictive voter laws 
since the Shelby County decision including 
strict voter ID laws; barriers to voter reg-
istration, such as requiring proof of citizen-
ship documents, allowing challenges of vot-
ers on the voter rolls, and unfairly purging 
voters from the voter rolls; reductions in 
early voting; and the moving or elimination 
of polling places. Witness testimony particu-
larly highlighted ongoing efforts at voter 
discrimination in several states that were 
previously 
covered 
by 
the 
VRA’s 
preclearance formula: Texas, Georgia, North 
Carolina, and Alabama. 
In Texas, within just hours of the Shelby 
County decision, the state announced it 
would implement its voter ID law despite a 
federal court having ruled that the same law 
could not receive preclearance due to its ef-
fects on minority voters. Other examples of 
voting barriers in Texas included the rein-
statement of at-large voting districts; crimi-
nal and civil penalties for so-called ‘‘voter 
fraud,’’ including for errors on voter reg-
istration forms; widespread purging of voters 
from the rolls, including a policy targeting 
naturalized citizens; a failure to comply with 
the National Voter Registration Act; elec-
tion judges and polling officials engaging in 
discrimination against and hostility toward 
minority voters; not processing voter reg-
istration of minority voters; last-minute 
changes to polling sites and assigning incon-
venient polling sites to minority voters; long 
lines; 
nonfunctioning 
voting 
equipment; 
elimination of straight-ticket voting; and in-
timidation by state troopers and harassment 
of African American voters by vigilante 
groups. 
In Georgia, following Shelby County, dis-
criminatory barriers to voting included at-
tacks on third party registration; restrictive 
voter ID laws; the closure of hundreds of pre-
cincts; database challenges that impacted le-
gitimate registrations; voter purges of more 
than a million voters; a flawed process of 
‘‘exact match’’ that impacted 53,000 people’s 
registrations; 
undertrained 
and 
under- 
resourced election staff who could not meet 
the needs of voters; long lines; policies that 
resulted in naturalized citizens having to go 
to court for their voting rights; lack of bal-
lots in languages other than English for lan-
guage minority voters; broken voting ma-
chines; inadequate distribution of voting ma-
chines; disparate application of state laws 
between counties and inconsistent applica-
tion of the provisional ballot system; mis-
applied or miscommunicated district lines

candidates who would have otherwise been

eligible); and high rates of rejecting absentee 
ballots. 
In North Carolina, after the Shelby County 
decision, the legislature passed an omnibus 
voter restriction law that the U.S. Court of 
Appeals for the Fourth Circuit would later 
describe as ‘‘the most restrictive voting law 
North Carolina has seen since the era of Jim 
Crow’’ with ‘‘provisions [that] target African 
Americans with almost surgical precision.’’ 
It included a ban on paid voter registration 
drives, the elimination of same-day voter 
registration, a reduction of early voting by a 
week, the elimination of the option of early 
voting sites at different hours, and the re-
duction of satellite polling sites for voters 
with disabilities and elderly voters. Other 
examples of barriers to voting included ger-
rymandering, voter roll purges, a voter ID 
constitutional amendment, reductions to 
early voting, long lines, issues with voting 
machines and curbside voting, and poll work-
er misconduct. 
In Alabama, after the Shelby County deci-
sion, discriminatory barriers to voting in-
cluded a photo ID law, the closure of DMV 
offices—which were needed to acquire the 
necessary photo ID—in areas with the high-
est proportions of Black Americans, restric-
tive absentee ballot rules, the requirement of 
documents to prove citizenship to register to 
vote, polling site closures, untrained poll 
workers, 
and 
felon 
re-enfranchisement 
issues. 
In describing these voting barriers in spe-
cific states, the witnesses’ testimony pointed 
to a pattern demonstrating that certain vot-
ing practices, enacted across multiple states 
in the post-Shelby County era, consistently 
resulted in minority voter disenfranchise-
ment, including: 
Restrictions on voter registration, early 
voting, and voting by mail; 
Restrictive voter ID laws; 
Voter roll purges; 
Issues with polling sites, such as the clo-
sure and relocation of polling sites, long 
lines, intimidation of voters primarily in 
communities of color, locating polling places 
extremely far from where a resident lives— 
especially in Native American communities, 
and denying limited English proficient vot-
ers the right to language assistance; 
Vote dilution through redistricting plans, 
transitions to at-large voting systems, and 
by other means; and 
Obstacles to restoring the right to vote for 
formerly incarcerated individuals 
One witness summarized the numerous im-
pacts of Shelby County on voting rights as 
including the following: 
A resurgence of discriminatory voting 
practices, including practices motivated by 
intentional discrimination, especially in ju-
risdictions that were once covered by Sec-
tion 5 of the VRA; 
The institution and re-institution of dis-
criminatory voting policies with impunity 
by recalcitrant and hostile elected officials; 
The lack of notification to the public of 
voting policy changes that could have a dis-
criminatory effect, which is especially sig-
nificant considering most of these actions 
occur in small towns where constant over-
sight would be difficult; 
The inability of the public to participate in 
reviewing practices before they take effect; 
The elimination of the preclearance proc-
ess’ deterrent effect; 
An unsustainable status quo where civil 
rights organizations are attempting to fill 
the gaps created by the Shelby County deci-
sion at huge expense; and 
The first redistricting cycle in decades 
without the full protections of the Voting 
Rights Act. 
The record accumulated during the 116th 
Congress clearly established that voter dis-
crimination persists and continues to evolve 
more than five decades after the passing of 
the VRA. The Supreme Court’s decision in 
Shelby County has effectively permitted 
these laws to flourish across the states 
unimpeded. The evidence highlights the need 
for the Voting Rights Act’s preclearance re-
gime—both in areas where voting discrimi-
nation has been substantial and persistent 
and based on particular voting practices that 
are likely to result in unconstitutional dis-
crimination—and to update and clarify other 
provisions of the VRA. 
During the 117th Congress, the Constitu-
tion Subcommittee built upon the record 
from the previous Congress, holding six addi-
tional hearings during which witnesses again 
presented documented evidence of wide-
spread discrimination in the voting process. 
As one witness described at a hearing held in 
May 2021, these ‘‘direct burdens on the right 
to 
vote’’ 
include 
discriminatory 
voter 
purges; significantly longer wait times at 
the polls for minority voters as compared to 
white voters, disparities ‘‘that discrimina-
tory state and local practices are at least 
partially responsible for’’; new strict voter 
ID laws; restrictions on voter registration 
such as ‘‘exact match’’ laws ‘‘mandating 
that voters’ names on registration records 
must perfectly match their names on ap-
proved forms of identification’’; cutbacks to 
early voting; and new laws restricting access 
to mail in voting and absentee ballots. 
The record compiled over the past two 
Congresses indicates that states and polit-
ical subdivisions have intensified their ef-
forts to suppress minority voters through 
the enactment of facially neutral yet dis-
criminatory voting practices and procedures 
in the eight years since the Supreme Court’s 
Shelby County decision. As discussed in 
greater detail below, President Trump and 
his allies’ campaign to spread the falsehood 
that his loss in the 2020 presidential election 
was due to widespread fraud has further 
catalyzed state and local efforts to enact dis-
criminatory changes to voting laws under 
the guise of ‘‘election integrity protections.’’ 
B. Changes to State Voting Laws Since the 2020 
Election 
Particularly salient to demonstrating the 
current need to revitalize the VRA is the re-
newed effort by many states to enact addi-
tional voting restrictions following former 
President Trump’s efforts to discredit the 
2020 election results by publicly promoting 
baseless claims that the vote was marred by 
fraud and irregularities. As previously noted, 
even before the 2020 election, states formerly 
subject to the VRA’s preclearance require-
ment enacted a series of new voting restric-
tions in the wake of the Supreme Court’s de-
cision in Shelby County. Taking cues from 
the baseless allegations promoted by Presi-
dent Trump and his allies, several state leg-
islatures have proposed or enacted restric-
tive voting laws in the name of protecting 
so-called ‘‘election integrity protection’’, in-
cluding in states previously subject to the 
VRA’s preclearance regime. 
According to a July 22, 2021 Brennan Cen-
ter for Justice report, as of July 14, 18 states 
have enacted 30 laws that restrict the right 
to vote. The Brennan Center report also ob-
serves that these restrictive voting laws tar-
get mail in and absentee voting, ‘‘make 
faulty voter purges more likely’’, and impose 
stricter voter ID requirements. As of August 
23, 2021, the non-partisan organization Vot-
ing Rights Lab was tracking 495 anti-voter 
bills in the states. 
The recent voting law changes enacted by 
Georgia exemplify many of the most restric-
tive voting measures adopted following the 
2020 election. Notably, the entire state of 
Georgia was subject to preclearance under 
the VRA at the time of the Shelby County 
decision. Signed into law by Governor Brian 
Kemp (R–GA) on March 25, 2021, SB 202 incor-
porated several restrictive voting proposals 
into a single omnibus elections law. Several 
of SB 202’s provisions are designed to limit 
absentee voting. It requires absentee voters 
to provide a Georgia driver’s license or state 
identification card number or photocopy of 
another identifying document with their ab-
sentee ballot application; prohibits election 
officials from providing ballot applications 
unless requested by the voter; and reduces 
the time period in which a voter can apply 
for an absentee ballot. Instead of allowing 
municipalities and counties some discretion 
to set the hours and days for early voting as 
was permitted previously, SB 202 standard-
izes early voting periods, effectively reduc-
ing many voters’ opportunities to vote early. 
One particularly notorious provision of SB 
202 criminalizes as a prohibited ‘‘gift’’ the 
giving food or water to those standing in line 
at a polling place. 
There is evidence in the public domain to 
suggest that Georgia’s recent changes to its 
election laws are more about preserving par-
tisan political advantage by burdening mi-
nority communities’ exercise of the right to 
vote than protecting the integrity of elec-
tions. For example, a Gwinnett County Re-
publican official was quoted saying ‘‘I was on 
a Zoom call the other day and I said, ‘I’m 
like a dog with a bone. I will not let them 
end this session without changing some of 
these laws.’ They don’t have to change all of 
them, but they’ve got to change the major 
parts of them so that we at least have a shot 
at winning.’’ 
Other states that have enacted restrictive 
voter laws include Florida and Arizona. On 
May 6, Florida’s Republican Governor, Ron 
DeSantis, signed into law an omnibus voter 
suppression bill that makes voter registra-
tion and vote by mail more difficult, changes 
rules for observers in ways that could dis-
rupt election administration, and restricts 
the ability to give water and food to people 
waiting in line to vote. On May 11, Arizona’s 
Republican Governor, Doug Ducey, signed 
into law a bill to make it harder for Arizo-
nans to vote by mail by purging voters who 
do not regularly vote from Arizona’s early 
voting list (which, before enactment of the 
law, had previously been known as the 
state’s permanent early voting list). 
In July 2021, the Texas Legislature began a 
special session to pass a new restrictive vot-
ing omnibus measure. Texas Senate Bill 1 
and House Bill 3 each would create new ID 
requirements for voting by mail and clamp 
down on new voting rules instituted by Har-
ris County—the state’s most populous coun-
ty and one of its most diverse—designed to 
increase voter access, including banning 
drive-thru voting, and new regulations for 
early voting hours. Senate Bill 1 passed on 
August 12, 2021.

Rights, a coalition of more than 220 national 
organizations working to build an America 
as good as its ideals. 
The Leadership Conference was founded in 
1950 and has coordinated national advocacy 
efforts on behalf of every major civil rights 
law since 1957, including the Voting Rights 
Act of 1965 and subsequent reauthorizations. 
Much of our work today focuses on making 
sure that every voter has a voice in key deci-
sions like pandemic relief, access to afford-
able health care, and policing account-
ability. At The Leadership Conference, we 
aim to ensure that every voter can cast a 
vote and have it counted. We are deeply 
grateful to this subcommittee for its work to 
restore the Voting Rights Act and for intro-
ducing voluminous evidence of racial dis-
crimination into the record with integrity, 
deliberation, and due diligence. 
In 1965, Congress passed the Voting Rights 
Act to outlaw racial discrimination in vot-
ing. Previously, many states barred Black 
voters from participating in the political 
system through literacy tests, poll taxes, 
voter intimidation, and violence. In the mid- 
1950s, only 25 percent of African Americans 
were registered to vote, and the registration 
rate was even lower in some states. In Mis-
sissippi, for example, fewer than 5 percent of 
African Americans were registered to vote. 
Those rates soared after Congress enacted 
the Voting Rights Act. By 1970, almost as 
many African Americans registered to vote 
in Alabama, Mississippi, Georgia, Louisiana, 
North Carolina, and South Carolina as had 
registered in the century before 1965. The 
Voting Rights Act became the nation’s most 
effective defense against racially discrimina-
tory voting policies. 
Only 15 years ago, this body reauthorized 
the Voting Rights Act for the fourth time 
with sweeping bipartisan support. The House 
of Representatives reauthorized this legisla-
tion by a 390–33 vote and the Senate passed it 
unanimously, 98–0. Given the importance of 
the Voting Rights Act, Congress undertook 
that reauthorization with care and delibera-
tion—holding 21 hearings, hearing from more 
than 90 witnesses, and compiling a record of 
more than 15,000 pages of evidence of con-
tinuing racial discrimination in voting. 
Then, in 2013, the U.S. Supreme Court in 
Shelby County v. Holder eviscerated the 
most powerful provision of the Voting Rights 
Act: the Section 5 preclearance system. This 
provision applied to nine states and local-
ities in another six states. These jurisdic-
tions with histories of voting discrimination 
were required to obtain preclearance from 
the U.S. District Court for the District of Co-
lumbia or the U.S. Department of Justice be-
fore implementing any change in a voting 
practice or procedure. As discussed herein, 
Section 5 was incredibly successful in block-
ing proposed voting restrictions in certain 
states and localities with histories of racial 
discrimination. It also ensured that changes 
to voting rules were public, transparent, and 
evaluated to protect voters against discrimi-
nation based on race and language. But, in 
Shelby County, Chief Justice John Roberts, 
on behalf of the majority, declared that ‘‘Our 
country has changed.’’ The Court held that 
the formula that decided which jurisdictions 
were subject to preclearance was based on 
‘‘decades-old data and eradicated practices.’’ 
It instructed Congress to assess ‘‘current 
conditions’’ in order to require states and po-
litical 
jurisdictions 
to 
preclear 
voting 
changes. Now that this assessment has been 
conducted, there can be no question of the 
persistent racial discrimination at the ballot 
box. Congress must act. 
Despite the best efforts of The Leadership 
Conference and its many member organiza-
tions to protect voting rights and promote 
civic participation, the eight-year impact of 
the Shelby County ruling has been dev-
astating to our democracy. The Supreme 
Court’s invalidation of the preclearance for-
mula released an immediate and sustained 
flood of new voting restrictions in formerly 
covered jurisdictions. Without the Voting 
Rights Act’s tools to fight the most blatant 
forms of discrimination, people of color con-
tinue to face barriers to exercising their 
most important civil right, including voter 
intimidation, disenfranchisement laws built 
on top of a system of mass incarceration, 
burdensome and costly voter ID require-
ments, and purges from the voter rolls. 
States have also cut back early voting op-
portunities, eliminated same-day voter reg-
istration, and shuttered polling places. The 
pattern is familiar: Gains in participation in 
voting among communities of color are met 
with concerted efforts to impose new bar-
riers in the path of those voters. 
Attached to this testimony are reports 
covering several states which document the 
‘‘current conditions’’ surrounding voting dis-
crimination, the same conditions required by 
the Supreme Court in Shelby County as the 
basis for Congress to update a coverage for-
mula. Additional reports will be submitted 
into the congressional record. These reports 
highlight the pervasiveness and persistence 
of voting discrimination in its modern-day 
form. They demonstrate the importance of 
reinstating Section 5 preclearance to stop 
discriminatory voting changes from going 
into effect and thereby ensuring that voters 
of color can fully participate in the political 
process and have their voices heard. 
Alabama 
In reviewing the current state of voting 
discrimination, it is only appropriate to 
begin with the State of Alabama, the birth-
place of the Voting Rights Act of 1965. From 
Selma to Shelby County, Alabama has 
served as ground zero for the struggle by 
Black voters to exercise the franchise. In 
1982, Congress had to explicitly add a results 
test to Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act 
after the Supreme Court required proof of in-
tent in a Section 2 case challenging the City 
of Mobile’s at-large voting districts as a di-
lution of Black voting power in City of Mo-
bile v. Bolden. As the report written by the 
NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund 
indicates, ‘‘racial discrimination in voting 
remains a persistent and significant problem 
in Alabama today.’’ The Southern Poverty 
Law Center states in its report, also at-
tached to this testimony: ‘‘The State of Ala-
bama has never rested in its efforts to under-
mine its Black citizens’ right to vote.’’ 
Since the Shelby County decision, Ala-
bama is the only state in the nation where 
federal courts have ordered more than one 
jurisdiction to submit to preclearance under 
Section 3(c) of the Voting Rights Act. Plain-
tiffs in a longstanding school desegregation 
case, Stout v. Jefferson County Board of 
Education, challenged the hybrid system of 
electing school board members in Jefferson 
County under which four were elected at- 
large from a ‘‘multi-member’’ district and a 
fifth was elected from a single-member dis-
trict. No Black person had ever been elected 
to an at-large seat. A federal court ruled 
that at-large districts violated Section 2 of 
the Voting Rights Act, finding that the state 
legislature created the districts ‘‘for the pur-
pose of limiting the influence of Black vot-
ers.’’ It ordered that multi-member districts 
be divided into four single-member districts 
and the county to submit future voting 
changes 
for 
Section 
3(c) 
preclearance 
through 2031. 
The City of Evergreen became the first ju-
risdiction in the nation to be subjected to 
preclearance after Shelby County. A lawsuit 
by Black voters challenged Evergreen’s post- 
2010 Census redistricting plan for five single- 
member districts, which retained three dis-
tricts with white majorities even though 62 
percent of Evergreen’s population is Black. 
The lawsuit also challenged the city’s sys-
tem for determining voter eligibility, which 
removed registered voters if their names did 
not also appear on the list of utility cus-
tomers, a practice which disproportionately 
removed Black voters from the voter list. 
Evergreen failed to obtain preclearance for 
these changes before the Shelby County rul-
ing, and a federal court issued a preliminary 
injunction against the redistricting plan. 
After Shelby County, the court granted the 
plaintiffs’ motion for summary judgment on 
their intentional discrimination claims and 
ordered Evergreen to submit future voting 
changes relating to redistricting and voter 
eligibility for preclearance until December 
2020. 
The Alabama report reveals additional 
‘‘stunning evidence’’ of intentional racial 
discrimination against Black voters by the 
Alabama state legislature and local jurisdic-
tions. African-American state legislators 
filed a lawsuit alleging that the Republican- 
led legislature intentionally sought to dilute 
the Black vote in violation of the Voting 
Rights Act and the Fourteenth Amendment 
by redrawing the state’s legislative districts 
to pack Black voters into majority-Black 
districts, thereby reducing their influence in 
other districts. The legislators also claimed 
that the redistricting plan was an unconsti-
tutional ‘‘racial gerrymander,’’ where it de-
liberately segregated voters into districts 
based on their race without adequate legal 
justification. A three-judge district rejected 
the claims, and the case was appealed to the 
Supreme Court, which vacated the lower 
court ruling and remanded the case for re-
consideration. The Court concluded that the 
fact that the legislature ‘‘expressly adopted 
and applied a policy of prioritizing mechan-
ical racial targets above all other districting 
criteria (save one-person, one-vote) provides 
evidence that race motivated the drawing of 
particular lines in multiple districts in the 
State.’’ On remand, one of the Eleventh Cir-
cuit’s most conservative judges, William 
Pryor, authored an opinion for the three- 
judge court, ruling that 12 of the majority- 
minority districts were unconstitutional be-
cause the legislature relied too heavily on 
race in drawing their boundaries. 
Another glaring example of intentional 
discrimination by Alabama arose in a federal 
bribery investigation in which recordings by 
White Alabama legislators revealed a plot by 
legislators to stop a gambling referendum 
from appearing on the ballot because it 
would increase Black voter turnout. The leg-
islators were overheard calling Black voters 
‘‘Aborigines’’ and predicting that the ref-
erendum would lead ‘‘’[e]very black, every il-
literate to be ‘‘bussed [to the polls] on HUD 
financed busses.’’ A district court judge pre-
siding over the bribery trial ruled that these 
legislators were not credible because they 
tried to ‘‘increase Republican political for-
tunes by reducing African American voter 
turnout’’ and because ‘‘the record establishes 
their purposeful, racist intent.’’ The court 
concluded that the ‘‘recordings represent 
compelling evidence that political exclusion 
through racism remains a real and enduring 
problem’’ in Alabama, and that overt racism 
‘‘remain[s] regrettably entrenched in the 
high echelons of state government.’’ 
Finally, Alabama’s efforts to enact photo 
ID laws, which disproportionately burden 
voters of color, dates back several decades. 
Although Alabama was required to seek 
preclearance before enforcing a 2011 law en-
acted prior to the Shelby County ruling, it 
did not. Instead, it waited until the ruling 
and then allowed the law to go into effect.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4429 
August 24, 2021 
The photo ID law was the subject of multiple 
lawsuits, recounted by both the NAACP 
Legal Defense Fund and the Southern Pov-
erty Law Center in their reports. A key issue 
in the litigation was the limited ability of 
Black voters to obtain photo ID. In 2015, the 
Alabama governor and a state agency an-
nounced the closure of 31 driver’s license of-
fices, many in majority Black counties. The 
U.S. Department of Transportation opened a 
civil rights investigation under Title VI of 
the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and concluded 
that the closures had a disparate impact on 
Black Alabamians in violation of the law. 
Alaska 
There is a well-developed record of Alas-
ka’s discrimination against the state’s indig-
enous peoples, Alaska Natives, which con-
tinues to this day and which was outlined in 
a 2017 article attached to the testimony. In 
1975, the Section 4(b) coverage formula was 
amended to address the ‘‘pervasive’’ problem 
of ‘‘voting discrimination against citizens of 
language minorities.’’ Congress identified 
what it described as ‘‘substantial’’ evidence 
of discriminatory practices against Alaska 
Natives. That evidence came in four forms: 
(1) Alaska Natives suffered from severe and 
systemic 
educational 
discrimination. 
(2) 
Alaska Natives suffered from illiteracy rates 
rivaling and even exceeding rates of Black 
voters in the South. (3) The illiteracy of 
Alaska Natives was exacerbated by their 
high limited-English proficiency (LEP) rates 
and need for interpreters to understand even 
the most basic voting materials written in 
English. (4) Congress considered evidence of 
Alaska’s constitutional literacy test and its 
impact on Alaska Native voters. 
When Section 4(b) was reauthorized in 2006, 
Congress considered substantial evidence of 
the impact of past and present educational 
discrimination on Native voters. Court deci-
sions found ‘‘degraded educational opportu-
nities’’ for Alaska Natives, resulting in grad-
uation rates that lagged far behind non-Na-
tives. Alaska’s continued failure to provide 
equal educational opportunities profoundly 
affected the ability of Native voters to read 
registration and voting materials. Congress 
determined that because of Alaska’s dis-
crimination, Native voters continued ‘‘to ex-
perience hardships and barriers to voting and 
casting ballots because of their limited abili-
ties to speak English and high illiteracy 
rates . . . particularly among the elders.’’ 
The sad legacy of education discrimination 
remains. According to the most recent cen-
sus data from the 2016 language coverage de-
terminations under Section 203, approxi-
mately one in five adult citizens of voting 
age in the Bethel Census Area is Limited 
English Proficient in the Yup’ik language. 
Alaska’s record of voting discrimination 
has exacerbated the continuing effects of its 
educational discrimination against Alaska 
Natives. While Shelby County was being liti-
gated, Alaska was under a settlement agree-
ment for violating the language assistance 
provisions in Section 203 of the Voting 
Rights Act and the voter assistance provi-
sions in Section 208 of the Act. In 2009, a fed-
eral court issued a preliminary injunction in 
Nick v. Bethel finding that the State of Alas-
ka had engaged in a wholesale failure to pro-
vide language assistance to Yup’ik-speaking 
voters in the Bethel Census Area. The court 
noted that ‘‘State officials became aware of 
potential problems with their language-as-
sistance program in the spring of 2006,’’ but 
their ‘‘efforts to overhaul the language as-
sistance program did not begin in earnest 
until after this litigation.’’ At that time, 
Alaska had been covered under Section 5 for 
Alaska Natives since 1975. However, state of-
ficials had taken no steps ‘‘to ensure that 
Yup’ik-speaking voters have the means to 
fully participate in the upcoming State-run 
elections’’ in 2008, a third of a century later. 
Alaska Native villages outside of the Beth-
el region expected that the fruits of the 
hard-fought victory in the Nick litigation 
would be applied to other regions of Alaska 
where language coverage was mandated. 
However, Alaska officials made a ‘‘policy de-
cision’’ not to do so. The state directed its 
bilingual coordinator to deny language as-
sistance to other areas. The bilingual coordi-
nator’s last day of employment was on De-
cember 31, 2012, the very day that the Nick 
agreement ended. That led Alaska Native 
voters and villages from three covered re-
gions, the Dillingham and Wade Hampton 
Census Areas for Yup’ik and the Yukon- 
Koyukuk Census Area for the Athabascan 
language of Gwich’in, to file suit just a 
month after Shelby County was decided. In 
Toyukak v. Treadwell, Alaska Natives sued 
the state for again violating Section 203 and 
for intentional discrimination in violation of 
the U.S. Constitution because election offi-
cials deliberately chose to deny language as-
sistance to other regions of Alaska even 
while the Nick settlement was in effect. 
Alaska’s recalcitrance to comply with the 
Voting Rights Act is particularly note-
worthy because it was the first Section 203 
case fully litigated to a decision in 35 years. 
In defending the latter claim, Alaska ar-
gued that the Fifteenth Amendment was in-
applicable to Alaska Native voters. State of-
ficials argued that Alaska Natives were enti-
tled to less voting information than English- 
speaking voters. The Alaska Native voters 
prevailed, but only after nearly two million 
dollars in attorneys’ fees and costs, the pas-
sage of 14 months for the ‘‘expedited’’ litiga-
tion, and a two-week trial in federal court. 
The court concluded that ‘‘based upon the 
considerable evidence,’’ the plaintiffs had es-
tablished that Alaska’s actions in the three 
census areas were ‘‘not designed to transmit 
substantially equivalent information in the 
applicable minority . . . languages.’’ The 
Toyukak decision came just 14 months after 
Shelby County, which refutes the majority’s 
conclusion that ‘‘things have changed dra-
matically’’ and ‘‘[b]latantly discriminatory 
evasions of federal decrees are rare.’’ The 
norm in many areas like Alaska in a post- 
Shelby world is defiance and deliberate vio-
lations of federal voting rights law to sup-
press registration and voting by American 
Indians and Alaska Natives. 
Florida 
The combination of a large and racially di-
verse electorate, two different time zones, 
and a history of razor-thin, contested elec-
tions would be enough basis for any state to 
become a focal point in an examination of 
voting rights. Florida’s place in the ongoing 
conversation about the need for a renewed 
Voting Rights Act is well-deserved. Since 
situating itself at the epicenter of a modern 
meltdown in the 2000 presidential election, 
the leaders who run the state’s government 
have been on the wrong side of policy reform 
opportunities that would protect the right to 
vote. As a result, communities of color, who 
comprise nearly half of Florida’s population 
in excess of 21 million voters, remain unable 
to enjoy the franchise by participating fully 
in deciding who represents them. 
Since the entire nation witnessed its ballot 
counting meltdown during a presidential 
election more than two decades ago, Florida 
has not ceased to find its way into voting 
rights controversy. The Florida report pre-
pared by the Advancement Project and sub-
mitted with this testimony outlines a series 
of issues that have required careful federal 
oversight and intervention in support of vot-
ing rights. Prior to the Shelby County deci-
sion, the state had crafted several policies 
that 
elicited 
multiple 
inquiries 
and 
preclearance objections from the Justice De-
partment. For instance, the department 
interposed objections to Florida’s state leg-
islative maps along with subsequence poli-
cies purporting to ‘‘reform’’ its election ad-
ministration system. All of these objections 
demonstrated threats to voters’ ability to 
access the ballot due to the state’s inatten-
tion to the effect of language accessibility. 
Since Shelby County, however, the scope of 
the loss of voting rights has been exceed-
ingly apparent. Florida has moved quickly to 
adopt changes in its election system, and 
challengers now must resort to court chal-
lenges in place of the preclearance adminis-
trative review process. For example, Flor-
ida’s secretary of state was enjoined by the 
Northern District of Florida from employing 
a ballot review process based on a flawed sig-
nature mismatch examination due to a lack 
of notice for people to cure perceived issues 
with their signatures. At the same time, it 
should be noted that certain policy decisions 
that had not reached disposition under the 
preclearance regime slipped through the 
cracks, like Florida’s 2012 voter purge policy 
where the challenge was dismissed due to the 
Shelby County decision in Mi Familia Voter 
Education Fund v. Detzner. 
Florida has sustained its habit of under-
mining the will of the people, even when it 
was expressed clearly in a public ballot 
measure. In 2018, more than 60 percent of 
Florida voters approved a constitutional 
mandate to restore the rights of its return-
ing citizens. After moving slowly to even re-
view applications for pardons and clemency 
before Amendment Four, state officials dou-
bled down by severely curtailing eligibility 
for rights restoration. Florida Senate Bill 
7066, signed into law in 2019, created a new 
barrier between these citizens and the fran-
chise: a modern-day poll tax. The new rules 
require these citizens to resolve all fees and 
costs associated with their prior convictions 
before becoming eligible to register. 
In practice, this policy is arguably worse 
than the classic poll tax, because Florida ac-
knowledges that it does not keep reliable 
documentation to allow a person to pay out-
standing costs. Further, the impact of this 
law shows significant racial effects in sev-
eral counties, meaning that people of color 
will be less likely than others to pursue the 
restoration of their rights. While the federal 
challenge to the law was not successful, the 
fact that the state still did not understand 
the likely impact of its fines and fees policy 
makes clear the work that preclearance re-
view would address; this provision would be 
more carefully researched and either revised 
or eliminated due to the significant limits 
on the franchise. 
In multiple ways, Florida impeded efforts 
to enhance voter accessibility during the 
2020 election. Amidst a global pandemic, 
where voters could not cast ballots in person 
without risking life and health, the state did 
precious little to provide more opportunities 
to vote from home. To the extent the state 
took affirmative steps, officials made the 
problems for voters worse, not better. Even 
though Florida has an established record of 
allowing citizens to vote by mail, the state 
limited the number of drop boxes and loca-
tions to drop off ballots, and also curtailed 
the period in which early voting would 
occur. These policies were compounded by 
the troubling policy of signature matching 
for ballots, an arbitrary methodology which 
placed doubts on many cast ballots. All of 
this occurred against the backdrop of a well- 
documented fiasco with delivery times in the 
U.S. Postal Service. The results placed un-
necessary pressures on participation rates in 
low-income areas of the state, as well as in 
communities of color.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4430 
August 24, 2021 
Finally, Florida adopted S.B. 90 this year, 
following efforts elsewhere to push back on 
many of the activities and third party orga-
nizations working to address the above prob-
lems with voting practices. The new law 
places restrictions on the ability of organiza-
tions to assist with voter registration, a bed-
rock activity for many groups whose mission 
is to enhance participation among voters of 
color. Additionally, the bill directs these or-
ganizations to warn citizens who register 
through their systems that their applica-
tions might not arrive in time, which sows 
doubt and uncertainty into these private ef-
forts to expand the franchise. And focusing 
on election management by local officials, 
the bill eliminates ballot drop-offs on Sun-
days, which is widely used by churches in 
Souls to the Polls programs. It is difficult to 
see these changes by Florida’s leadership as 
motivated by anything more than a hostile 
move against threats to their power. 
Georgia 
Georgia is home to history. In 2021, Black 
voters in Georgia turned out in record num-
bers, electing the state’s first Black U.S. 
senator, Reverend Raphael Warnock. These 
voters were able to make their voices heard 
despite tremendous obstacles enacted by the 
state to limit Black Georgians’ participa-
tion. Their ability to not just overcome, but 
to triumph, is yet another example of Black 
Georgians’ achievements, including those of 
storied civil rights leaders like Martin Lu-
ther King Jr. and the late Congressman John 
Lewis. Black and Brown Georgians deserve a 
democracy that allows for and encourages 
their full participation. Sadly, the state re-
mains relentless in its pursuit of racial dis-
crimination in voting. 
The state has a long and sordid history of 
relentless efforts to disenfranchise voters of 
color, beginning with prohibitions against 
Black voting enshrined in the state’s first 
Constitution in 1777. As Fair Fight Action 
demonstrates in its report, ‘‘Georgia’s En-
during Racial Discrimination in Voting and 
the Urgent Need to Modernize the Voting 
Rights Act,’’ which is attached to this testi-
mony, there is ‘‘an urgent and overwhelming 
need for Congress to bring the preclearance 
formula found in the Voting Rights Act 
(‘‘VRA’’) of 1965 . . . into the modern era, to 
reinstate robust federal oversight over dis-
criminatory 
voting 
practices, 
and 
to 
strengthen and protect voting rights—for all 
eligible voters in Georgia and nationwide.’’ 
The glaring examples of current disenfran-
chisement take many forms and are re-
counted, chapter and verse, in the Fair Fight 
Action report. For example, the two recent 
objections interposed directly against the 
State of Georgia arose in the five years pre-
ceding the Shelby County ruling. In both 
cases, the Department of Justice found that 
Georgia had attempted to implement new 
laws that would have a retrogressive and dis-
proportionate impact on voters of color. 
Most recently, in 2012, Georgia submitted for 
preclearance an amendment to the Georgia 
election code that required all nonpartisan 
elections for members of consolidated gov-
ernments to be held in conjunction with the 
July primary, rather than in November. The 
Department of Justice objected, finding the 
change 
would 
affect 
Augusta-Richmond 
County, in which Black voters had just be-
come a majority. Because Black voters were 
less likely to vote in July, the Department 
determined the change depressed turnout for 
voters of color and further, that the state 
had not sustained its burden of showing a 
lack of discriminatory purpose or effect. 
Three years earlier, in 2009, the Depart-
ment of Justice lodged an objection to a 
version of Georgia’s voter verification pro-
gram. It found that the ‘‘seriously flawed’’ 
program, which improperly removed voters 
from the rolls, disproportionately affected 
voters of color. It made this finding based on 
the ‘‘actual results of the state’s verification 
process’’ because Georgia had violated Sec-
tion 5 of the Voting Rights Act by not seek-
ing preclearance before implementing the 
program. 
Fair Fight Action has collected the stories 
of thousands of voters across the state who 
faced incredible barriers to voting in the 2018 
general election and the 2020–21 election 
cycle. For example, a DeKalb County physi-
cian, one of the country’s leading infectious 
disease specialists, was challenged at his 
polling location because there was a slight 
discrepancy with the spelling of his last 
name on his driver’s license as compared 
with his registration information. A Fulton 
County voter was initially refused a ballot 
because he was classified as a non-citizen, 
despite presenting his U.S. passport. Voters 
across the state expressed frustration at the 
closing and moving of polling locations, in-
cluding a voter from Clay County, who was 
forced to drive an hour to a new polling loca-
tion because her old polling location down 
the street closed. 
Voter purges have also disenfranchised eli-
gible and properly registered voters whose 
only 
mistake 
was 
not 
voting 
recently 
enough, like a voter in Warner Robins who 
has lived at the same address for 50 years but 
did not vote in recent elections. In 2019, he 
was 
placed 
on 
the 
state’s 
purge 
list 
impermissibly, with no notice. Georgia vot-
ers also experienced unacceptably long lines 
when trying to vote, such that many voters 
were forced to leave without voting or expe-
rienced other adverse consequences. For ex-
ample, a voter from Cobb County left her 
home at 6:30 a.m. to vote on Election Day in 
2018. The line was too long, so she left and 
came back on her lunch break at 2:20 p.m. 
She was not able to cast her ballot until 5:30 
p.m., and lost two hours of pay. In the Fair 
Fight Action report, there are also powerful 
examples of how the state abdicated its re-
sponsibility to adequately train local offi-
cials and poll workers about provisional bal-
lots, which in turn, has resulted in con-
flicting and incorrect information given to 
voters. 
Despite the high standards applied to voter 
discrimination claims by federal courts, at 
least two cases have resulted in a final judg-
ment that a practice within the State of 
Georgia violated the Voting Rights Act. In a 
2018 ruling, a federal court found that Sum-
ter County’s redrawn school board district 
map, which reduced the number of single- 
member districts and added two new at-large 
districts, violated Section 2. The plaintiff 
claimed the new map diluted the voting 
strength of Black voters. The court agreed, 
finding that the ‘‘infringement of black vot-
ers’ right to vote in Sumter County is se-
vere.’’ The court specifically found there was 
a ‘‘glaring lack of success for African Amer-
ican candidates running for county-wide of-
fice, both historically and recently, despite 
their plurality in voting-age population.’’ 
And the low rate of Black turnout was at-
tributable to the indisputable history of dis-
crimination in Sumter County and in Geor-
gia. A court made a similar finding in 1997 
after a bench trial on claims challenging the 
City of LaGrange’s at-large city council dis-
trict plan. Noting that LaGrange and Geor-
gia had a long history of discrimination, the 
court found the plan violated Section 2 of 
the Voting Rights Act because it deprived 
citizens of color of the opportunity to elect 
candidates of their choice. 
For further proof that attacks on voting 
represent an escalating threat to the rights 
of Georgians of color, one need look no fur-
ther than the state’s recently enacted Sen-
ate Bill 202. Georgia’s Republican-led Gen-
eral Assembly hastily passed S.B. 202 after a 
historic turnout for the 2020 election and the 
2021 Senate runoff, in which record participa-
tion among Black and Brown voters led to 
the election of Senator Warnock, and in re-
sponse to conspiracy theory-fueled, ground-
less allegations of voter fraud. Provisions 
such as the photo ID requirement, reduced 
minimum early voting for runoff elections, 
limited access to drop boxes, and prohibition 
of most out-of-precinct voting will dispar-
ately impact voters of color, particularly 
those with limited resources and time to 
navigate the complex requirements. Private 
parties have filed seven suits against Geor-
gia’s governor, the secretary of state, the 
State Election Board and its members, and 
various county election officials for declara-
tory and injunctive relief challenging var-
ious provisions of S.B. 202. On June 25, 2021, 
the Department of Justice sued the state, 
the secretary of state, and the State Elec-
tion Board, bringing the number of pending 
lawsuits challenging S.B. 202 to eight. 
Louisiana 
Louisiana’s record of racial discrimination 
in voting is ever present and well-docu-
mented. As the Southern Poverty Law Cen-
ter demonstrates in its report attached to 
this testimony, Louisiana officials have con-
sistently developed methods of denying or 
diluting the votes of Black Louisianans. The 
tactics may have changed over time, but the 
outcome is the same: Black voters dispropor-
tionately bear the impact and are less able 
to participate in the political process. 
Louisiana’s population is nearly one-third 
Black. Since Reconstruction, however, the 
state has not elected a Black candidate to 
statewide office. Louisiana lawmakers con-
tinue to reduce the power of Black commu-
nities through at-large elections, proposed 
annexations, incorporation, and redistricting 
plans. Louisiana currently unnecessarily re-
stricts registration, purges eligible voters 
from the rolls, and makes registration oner-
ous for people with felony convictions. Since 
Shelby County, Louisiana has also elimi-
nated dozens of polling places, mostly in 
Black communities. And while the state pro-
vides early voting, it limits the number of 
sites, creating incredibly long lines in the 
most populous parishes, including those with 
the most Black residents. The state also 
banned early voting on Sundays in 2016, 
which is a well-known tool for increasing 
Black voter turnout. The state narrowly re-
stricts access to absentee ballots, erects bar-
riers to ensuring that votes are counted, and 
engages in voter intimidation. Despite myr-
iad barriers to voting placed in their path, 
Louisiana voters persevere. Southern Pov-
erty Law Center’s report recounts more than 
70 Louisiana voters’ stories demonstrating 
the personal side of voter suppression. 
In 2000, the Department of Justice sued 
Morgan City, alleging that the at-large sys-
tem for electing members to the city council 
violated Section 2. After five private plain-
tiffs filed a similar action, the cases were 
consolidated and the parties settled. The 
court entered a consent judgment, finding ‘‘a 
reasonable factual and legal basis to con-
clude that under the at-large system for 
election of City Council in Morgan City, mi-
nority voters have less opportunity than 
other members of the electorate to partici-
pate in the political process and to elect rep-
resentatives of their choice.’’ As a condition 
of the settlement, the parties agreed that all 
future elections for the city council would 
proceed according to a single-member elec-
tion system. 
In 2002, a residents’ association sued the 
St. Bernard Parish School Board under Sec-
tion 2 to prevent it from adopting a redis-
tricting plan that reduced the board’s size

and created two at-large seats. The redis-
tricting plan arose from Act No. 173, which 
required St. Bernard Parish, upon the collec-
tion of a sufficient number of petitions, to 
hold a referendum to transform the parish 
school board from a body composed of 11 
members elected from single-member dis-
tricts to one composed of seven members, 
five elected from single-member districts 
and two elected at-large. Parish voters ap-
proved the ‘‘5–2’’ plan. Under the 11-member 
single-district plan, it had been possible to 
create a majority-Black district; indeed, 
prior to the referendum, the school board 
had tentatively approved doing just that. 
But the 5–2 plan made a majority-Black dis-
trict impossible. The court invalidated the 
plan, finding that it diluted the voting 
strength of the parish’s Black voters in vio-
lation of Section 2. 
In 2007, Black residents of Jefferson Parish 
filed suit against the State of Louisiana, al-
leging that the method for electing judges on 
an at-large basis to the First District of the 
Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals diluted Black 
voting strength. On July 6, 2007, the Lou-
isiana governor signed Act 261, dividing the 
First District into two single-member ‘‘elec-
tion sections.’’ The court entered a consent 
judgement, confirming that Act 261 provided 
a framework for resolving the litigation. The 
court ordered that the action be dismissed, 
subject to preclearance and implementation 
of Act 261. 
In 2021, the Department of Justice filed 
suit against the City of West Monroe under 
Section 2, challenging the at-large method of 
electing representatives to the West Monroe 
Board of Aldermen. Although Black resi-
dents comprised nearly 30 percent of the vot-
ing-age population in West Monroe, no Black 
candidate had ever been elected to the board. 
The court entered a consent judgment adopt-
ing a ‘‘mixed’’ election method that provided 
for three single-member districts and two at- 
large seats. 
As a harbinger of what is to come, in the 
latest legislative session, state lawmakers 
passed five bills that would have further re-
stricted voting rights, including a bill that 
would unnecessarily purge registered voters, 
a bill that would add additional identifica-
tion requirements to absentee ballots, and a 
bill that would ban absentee ballot drop 
boxes. Only fierce and persistent advocacy 
from dedicated organizers and a veto from 
the governor prevented these bills from be-
coming law. Louisiana’s current conditions 
of racial discrimination in voting are un-
equivocal. Without federal preclearance, the 
promise of the Fifteenth Amendment and the 
Voting Rights Act to guarantee equal voting 
rights will slip further away. 
Mississippi 
Home to voting rights heroes like Fannie 
Lou Hamer and Medgar Evers and the site of 
Freedom Summer, Mississippi is notorious 
for its exclusion and suppression of Black 
voters throughout history. Mississippi en-
forced white supremacy through explicit 
legal impediments to Black voting as well as 
state-sanctioned murder, including more 
than 650 lynchings from Reconstruction 
through 1950—the most of any state in the 
country. Mississippi was the first state sued 
by the Department of Justice after the Vot-
ing Rights Act was passed. Between 1965 and 
2006, the department objected to more than 
169 proposed voting changes in Mississippi 
that disenfranchised voters of color, includ-
ing redistricting plans, at-large election 
schemes, polling place changes, candidate 
qualification requirements, and open pri-
mary laws. The state has the highest per-
centage of Black residents in the country—38 
percent—yet no Black candidate has been 
elected to statewide office since Reconstruc-
tion. 
As documented in the Southern Poverty 
Law Center’s report, ‘‘Freedom Summer, 
Shelby County, & Beyond: Mississippi’s Con-
tinued Record of Racial Discrimination in 
Voting, the Tireless Mississippians Who 
Push Forward, & the Critical Need to Re-
store the Voting Rights Act,’’ the state and 
many of its jurisdictions have made strident 
and continuous efforts to prevent Black Mis-
sissippians from participating in the polit-
ical process. For example, instead of paying 
a ‘‘poll tax’’ to vote, Black Mississippians 
are now required to incur the burdensome 
expense of having certain absentee ballots 
and applications notarized. Additionally, in-
stead of being asked to interpret complex 
legal provisions under the guise of literacy 
tests, Black Mississippians are now subject 
to unevenly applied voter ID requirements. 
Voting rights litigation during the last 25 
years demonstrates the ongoing struggle of 
voters of color. In 1993, a nonprofit group 
sued the City of Quitman, Mississippi, argu-
ing that the city violated Section 2 of the 
Voting Rights Act by electing its five alder-
men from at-large districts, thus diluting 
the voting strength of the city’s Black vot-
ers. A federal court granted a preliminary in-
junction, enjoining the upcoming 1993 alder-
man elections. The court later entered a 
final judgment, concluding that the city’s 
system of electing its aldermen from at- 
large districts violated Section 2. In 1996, 
Black voters challenged Calhoun County’s 
redistricting plan. Rather than drawing a 
‘‘geographically compact black majority dis-
trict,’’ the county created a plan that di-
vided Black residents between five districts, 
where the Black population ranged from 19 
percent to 42 percent. A federal appellate 
court held that the plan ‘‘dilute[d] minority 
voting strength’’ and therefore violated Sec-
tion 2 of the Voting Rights Act. In 1997, a 
federal court found that Chickasaw County’s 
redistricting plan for its justice court judge 
and constable elections violated Section 2 of 
the Voting Rights Act. The court concluded 
that ‘‘the lingering effect of the past history 
of discrimination, the racially polarized vot-
ing patterns, the substantial socio-economic 
differences between black and white citizens, 
and the lack of success of black candidates 
in country-wide, county district and city- 
wide elections in Chickasaw County causes 
black voters to ‘have less opportunity than 
other members of the electorate in the polit-
ical process and to elect candidates of their 
choice.’ ’’ 
It is harder to vote in Mississippi than in 
almost any other state. Mississippi ranked 47 
out of 50 in the 2020 Cost of Voting Index— 
which considers election system features 
that impact voting access, including reg-
istration deadlines, availability of pre-reg-
istration and early voting, number of polling 
places, poll hours, and voter ID laws. It was 
a modest improvement from 2016 when it 
ranked dead last. There is no online voter 
registration. No automatic or same-day reg-
istration. No early voting. Mississippi has a 
strict photo ID law for voting in person. One 
can only vote absentee by qualifying for one 
of a narrow set of excuses. Even those who 
qualify to vote absentee must have their ab-
sentee ballot application and their absentee 
ballot notarized. During the 2020 election 
season, the state refused to lift these burden-
some requirements even amid a global pan-
demic, endangering Mississippians wishing 
to avail themselves of their rights and make 
their voices heard while keeping themselves 
and their families safe. 
In its report, the Southern Poverty Law 
Center documented Mississippians’ obstacles 
to cast their votes. On Election Day 2012, a 
Hinds County resident arrived at the polling 
location at which she had voted for years, 
only to be told that her name was not in the 
register, and she was not able to vote. After 
the election, she took time off from work to 
go to the courthouse and ask why her name 
had been removed from the rolls. She was 
eventually informed that her name had been 
removed as part of a redistricting—the first 
time she had ever been notified of this fact. 
In the 2016 presidential election, a Grenada 
County resident and Ole Miss student at-
tempted to vote absentee but was charged 
$10 for each document she needed to get no-
tarized, for a total of $20. She had to spend 
her last $20 on the notary and points out 
that this notarization requirement is ‘‘equiv-
alent to charging a poll tax.’’ A Harrison 
County resident moved in fall 2020 and 
promptly re-registered to vote at her new ad-
dress. On Election Day 2020, she was turned 
away from her nearest polling place and was 
told she needed to vote at another location 
30 minutes away. Once there, however, she 
was required to vote using a provisional bal-
lot and later received a letter indicating her 
ballot had not been counted. It ultimately 
took her three attempts to update her ad-
dress before she was finally able to receive 
her voter card. In the 2020 election, a Hinds 
County resident encountered delays and 
overcrowding at her polling location, which 
was located on the corner of two roads with 
no sidewalks. She and other voters had to 
wait in line on the side of the road for about 
an hour, which was difficult for many dis-
abled and elderly voters, including the voter 
in front of her in line, whose wheelchair 
broke while waiting in line due to the poor 
road conditions. 
Mississippi officials are relentless in cur-
tailing the right to vote for their constitu-
ents of color. Earlier this year, House Bill 
586 proposed that Mississippi direct its voter 
registration system to identify registered 
voters who may not be U.S. citizens by 
checking other unspecified ‘‘identification 
databases.’’ Voters flagged as ‘‘potential 
non-citizens’’ would have faced an imme-
diate challenge to their registrations: The 
bill ‘‘mandated a 30-day period in which 
flagged voters would have had to provide a 
birth certificate, passport, or naturalization 
documents to the relevant authority.’’ Fail-
ure to do so would result in an immediate 
purge from the registered voter roll. Under 
threat of litigation by advocates, the bill ul-
timately failed, but it demonstrates that 
many Mississippi lawmakers remain deter-
mined to make it even more difficult to vote. 
North Carolina 
North Carolina’s shameful history of rac-
ism in voting includes the only successful 
violent municipal coup d‘e´tat in our nation’s 
history in the Wilmington massacre of 1898; 
enactment of a literacy test, poll tax, and 
felony-based 
disenfranchisement; 
prohibi-
tions on single-shot voting; and discrimina-
tory multi-member districts of 1982 that led 
to the landmark Thornburg v. Gingles deci-
sion. Yet, as documented in Forward Jus-
tice’s report, ‘‘The Struggle for Voting 
Rights in North Carolina: 2006–2021,’’ North 
Carolina’s recent history demonstrates the 
effectiveness of the Voting Rights Act prior 
to Shelby County and the urgent need for its 
reinvigoration. 
In the two decades before Shelby County, 
the Voting Rights Act was working in North 
Carolina. Prior to 2013, 40 out of 100 counties 
were covered by Section 5, primarily located 
in Eastern North Carolina. As the report de-
scribes, ‘‘[w]hile the impact of Section 2 liti-
gation since 1965 cannot be underestimated, 
Section 5 was the critical legal protection 
undergirding the fragile, but notable, gains 
by Black voters in the state.’’ From 1982 to 
2013, more than 49 Section 5 objection letters 
were issued by the Department of Justice to 
North Carolina and its local jurisdictions. By

2012, African Americans were ‘‘poised to act 
as a major electoral force.’’ 
After Shelby County, North Carolina be-
came ‘‘a national testing ground for modern 
manifestations of Jim Crow-era voter sup-
pression strategies and epicenter for a re-
newed voting rights movement to prevent 
discrimination at the ballot box.’’ In just a 
matter of hours after Shelby County was 
handed down, leadership of the North Caro-
lina General Assembly announced that be-
cause the decision had rid them of the ‘‘head-
ache’’ 
of 
the 
Voting 
Rights 
Act’s 
preclearance protections, they could now 
move forward with the ‘‘full bill.’’ H.B. 589 
became known as the ‘‘monster’’ voter sup-
pression law—and was more restrictive than 
bills seen in any other state. Among other 
changes, the law eliminated same-day reg-
istration, pre-registration for 16- and 17- 
year-olds, out-of-precinct ballots, and the 
first week of early voting, and instituted one 
of the nation’s most stringent voter ID re-
quirements. 
More than three years after H.B. 589’s pas-
sage, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 
Fourth Circuit invalidated the omnibus sup-
pression legislation, holding that the State 
of North Carolina illegally and intentionally 
targeted the right to vote of African Ameri-
cans ‘‘with almost surgical precision’’ in vio-
lation of Section 2 and the Fourteenth and 
Fifteenth Amendments. The Court concluded 
‘‘in sum, relying on . . . racial data, the Gen-
eral Assembly enacted legislation restricting 
all—and only—practices disproportionately 
used by African Americans’’ and ‘‘that, be-
cause of race, the legislature enacted one of 
the largest restrictions of the franchise in 
modern North Carolina.’’ 
As described in Forward Justice’s report, 
North Carolinians have labored for close to a 
decade defending against an all-out attack 
on voting rights. On top of the ‘‘surgical pre-
cision’’ of the omnibus voter suppression leg-
islation, North Carolina’s racially discrimi-
natory redistricting following the 2010 decen-
nial census represents some of the most egre-
gious gerrymandering violations in the coun-
try to dilute and suppress the power of vot-
ers of color. Two federal decisions, Covington 
v. North Carolina and Cooper v. Harris, held 
that, in drawing the state legislative dis-
tricts, the state manufactured one of the 
‘‘largest racial gerrymanders ever encoun-
tered by a Federal Court’’ and, in con-
structing both Congressional District 1 and 
12, the General Assembly illegally used a 
‘‘racial target that subordinated other dis-
tricting criteria and produced boundaries 
amplifying divisions between blacks and 
whites.’’ These cases are among the most 
prominent of the state’s complex web of vot-
ing rights violations since 2013, many docu-
mented in state and federal court challenges, 
which dominated the past decade. 
Voting rights litigation, voter outreach 
and education, and voter protection work 
over the last decade yielded a detailed body 
of evidence summarized in the Forward Jus-
tice report, including in the form of coordi-
nated third-party challenges to voter eligi-
bility, significant reductions to polling loca-
tions and hours available in formerly cov-
ered counties, and county-level efforts to 
change methods of elections from single- 
member to at-large. As North Carolina’s 
elections developed into a federal battle-
ground the state also experienced continued 
racial appeals in campaigning, and incidents 
of harassment and voter intimidation by 
both third-party groups and partisan actors, 
particularly heightened in the 2020 election 
cycle. One shocking incident took place on 
the last day of early voting on October 31, 
2020, when a peaceful ‘‘Souls to the Polls’’ 
march in Graham, North Carolina, organized 
by Black clergy, ended with those gathered, 
including the elderly and children, being 
pepper-sprayed and prevented from com-
pleting their walk to the early voting site in 
Alamance County. 
Without the preventative umbrella of Sec-
tion 5, North Carolinians were left working 
overtime to seek after-the-fact remedies, and 
equal democracy in the state suffered. North 
Carolina’s General Assembly remains in leg-
islative session today, with legislation pend-
ing that threatens the right to vote. Fol-
lowing the census data release, the 2021 re-
districting process is officially underway. 
The state produced remarkable leaders in 
the modern struggle for voting rights, in-
cluding elders Mother Rosa Eaton and Moth-
er Grace Hardison, who represent the best of 
America, as they fought under the banner of 
the Forward Together Moral Mondays Move-
ment to realize the full promise of our de-
mocracy. But, as Rev. Dr. William Barber, II, 
a leading architect of that movement de-
scribed, ‘‘these battles should never have oc-
curred at all.’’ Without urgent congressional 
action, North Carolinians are bracing for an-
other decade of struggle for the equal ballot, 
recognizing that the state’s past is a har-
binger of the scope and scale of voter sup-
pression to come. 
South Carolina 
South Carolina, where Black residents rep-
resent more than one quarter of the state’s 
population, has a long and deep history of ra-
cial discrimination in voting. It was the first 
state to challenge the constitutionality of 
the Voting Rights Act, in South Carolina v. 
Katzenbach, almost immediately after its 
passage in 1965. As the South Carolina report 
by veteran voting rights lawyer Mark Posner 
makes clear, that legacy of discrimination 
continues today, both in how the state runs 
elections and in structural election prac-
tices. The state has one of the most restric-
tive voter registration deadlines in the coun-
try; one of the most restrictive systems re-
garding the opportunity for voters to cast 
their ballot ahead of Election Day, either by 
mail or in person; and one of the worst re-
cent records for wait times at the polls. 
While some advances have been made in 
safeguarding the freedom to vote, particu-
larly for Black Americans, they have largely 
been the result of Section 5 objections and 
litigation. Between 1996 and the Shelby 
County ruling, the Department of Justice 
issued 14 objections to voting changes which 
jurisdictions, including the state itself, were 
seeking to implement. The glaring example 
of the challenge to the state’s restrictive 
photo ID law is a case in point. It illustrates 
the power and the efficacy of the Voting 
Rights Act to block discriminatory voting 
changes and to deter jurisdictions from seek-
ing to implement such changes. 
In 2011, South Carolina adopted an exceed-
ingly onerous photo ID law for voting in per-
son and for in-person absentee voting. It rec-
ognized only five limited forms of ID: a 
South Carolina driver’s license, another form 
of photo ID issued by the South Carolina De-
partment of Motor Vehicles, a voter registra-
tion card with a photograph (issued only by 
visiting a local board of registration office); 
a federal military photo ID; and a passport. 
Voters without ID could cast a provisional 
ballot by presenting a non-photo voter reg-
istration card and signing an affidavit that 
‘‘the elector suffers from a reasonable im-
pediment that prevents him from obtaining a 
photo ID.’’ 
The Department of Justice blocked the 
new requirement from being implemented on 
the basis that it would disenfranchise tens of 
thousands of voters of color. It concluded 
that ‘‘[n]on-white voters were . . . dispropor-
tionately represented . . . in the group of 
registered voters who . . . would be rendered 
ineligible to go to the polls and participate 
in the election.’’ The state filed a Section 5 
declaratory judgement seeking preclearance 
from a three-judge court but failed to dem-
onstrate that the limited roster of accept-
able IDs would not have a discriminatory ef-
fect. 
Facing a likely denial of preclearance, 
South Carolina reinterpreted the law to lib-
erally construe the ‘‘reasonable impedi-
ment’’ exception to the photo ID require-
ment in an effort to neutralize the discrimi-
natory effect. Under this new subjective test, 
the reasonableness of the impediment was 
‘‘to be determined by the individual voter, 
not by a poll manager or county board.’’ 
Based on this interpretation, the district 
court precleared the revised photo ID provi-
sion for elections after 2012 but denied 
preclearance for the 2012 general election on 
the ground that there was too little time to 
properly implement the new provision. 
In a concurring opinion, U.S. Judge John 
Bates famously emphasized the key role Sec-
tion 5 had played in South Carolina ulti-
mately putting forth a nondiscriminatory 
photo ID provision: ‘‘[O]ne cannot doubt the 
vital function that Section 5 of the Voting 
Rights Act has played here . . . . Congress 
has recognized the importance of such a de-
terrent effect. 
. . . Rather, the history of 
[the new law] demonstrates the continuing 
utility of Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act 
in deterring problematic, and hence encour-
aging nondiscriminatory, changes in state 
and local voting laws.’’ 
Texas 
They say that everything’s bigger in 
Texas. The battle for voting rights is no ex-
ception, as documented in the Texas report 
submitted with this testimony. Last week’s 
census results illustrate that Texas gained 
more residents than any other state since 
2010, with people of color accounting for over 
95 percent of this growth. Non-Hispanic 
White Texans now make up just 39.8 percent 
of the state’s population—down from 45 per-
cent in 2010. Meanwhile, the share of His-
panic Texans has grown to 39.3 percent. The 
state’s growth of Black and Asian popu-
lations also significantly outpaced that of 
the White population since 2010. These 
changes will no doubt affect the electorate 
for decades to come. Nearly half of all Tex-
ans under age 18 are Latino, and two million 
more will become eligible to vote in the next 
decade. Not surprisingly, Texas added a 
record number of new voters between last 
two presidential elections. 
These dramatic demographic shifts in the 
electorate coincide with continuing and 
harmful attacks on voting rights in the 
state. At the end of last year, researchers ex-
amining the time and effort required to vote 
in different states ranked Texas as the worst 
for voting.The creation of—in their words— 
‘‘the state with the most restrictive elec-
toral climate’’ in light of unparalleled ex-
pansion and diversification of the electorate 
reflects the state’s past and foreshadows its 
future without federal oversight. Indeed, the 
pattern here is familiar one: Gains in minor-
ity participation in voting are met with con-
certed efforts to impose new barriers in the 
path of those voters. As Justice Kennedy ob-
served in LULAC v. Perry, 
‘‘Texas has a long, well-documented his-
tory of discrimination that has touched upon 
the rights of African-Americans and His-
panics to register, to vote, or to participate 
otherwise in the electoral process. Devices 
such as the poll tax, an all-white primary 
system, and restrictive voter registration 
time periods are an unfortunate part of this 
State’s minority voting rights history. . . .

may well ‘hinder their ability to participate 
effectively in the political process.’ ’’ 
Tory Gavito, a minority politics movement 
builder and founder of the Texas Futures 
Project and Way To Win, described that: 
‘‘Texas is where the South meets the West. 
We have a legacy of slavery in the state. We 
have a legacy of stealing lands and killing 
Mexican landowners who lived here from be-
fore the state was part of the United States 
of 
America.’’ 
Its 
shared 
history 
dem-
onstrates how the expansion or restriction of 
voting rights in Texas has implications 
across the country. In 1944, Thurgood Mar-
shall 
successfully 
argued 
in 
Smith 
v. 
Allwright that the Texas Democratic Party’s 
policy of prohibiting Black people from vot-
ing in primary elections violated the Four-
teenth and Fifteenth Amendments. Black 
voter registration markedly improved imme-
diately following the Court’s ruling in 
Smith, causing Marshall to recognize the 
case as ‘‘a giant milestone in the progress of 
Negro Americans toward full citizenship.’’ 
Though the white primary was struck down, 
several 
features 
of 
vote 
denial 
and 
abridgement in Texas remain: redistricting, 
the imposition of additional candidate quali-
fications, new at-large voting arrangements, 
photo ID laws, onerous voter registration 
procedures, voter roll purges, relocation, clo-
sures and overcrowded polling sites, and hur-
dles related to mail-in voting. 
The wave of new voters of color in Texas 
have been met with the ‘‘most restrictive 
pre-registration law in the country.’’ In par-
ticular, Texas has an in-person voter reg-
istration deadline 30 days prior to Election 
Day and prohibits online voter registration. 
Voters must print their registration and 
bring it to the county voter registrar. Texas 
also does not offer simultaneous registration 
for the 1.5 million Texans who renew or up-
date their driver’s licenses online. In con-
trast, other states permit an automatic 
voter registration process, same-day reg-
istration during early voting, and online reg-
istration options. 
These same voters may need to journey to 
polling places that are distant from minority 
neighborhoods. A report by The Leadership 
Conference Education Fund recently noted 
that Texas ‘‘stands out for the volume, scale, 
and breadth of its polling place closures 
since Shelby County.’’ This study shows that 
Texas has closed more polling places since 
Shelby County than any other state. The 750 
polls closed constituted approximately 50 
percent of the state’s total polling places, 
and 590 were closed before the 2016 presi-
dential election—the first presidential elec-
tion after Shelby County. Furthermore, five 
of the six largest county closers of polling 
places are in Texas. Unsurprisingly, these 
counties—Dallas, 
Harris, 
Brazoria, 
and 
Nueces—are all majority-minority jurisdic-
tions with significant Latino and Black pop-
ulation. 
Courts have previously found Texas’ voting 
restrictions to bear racial animus and hinder 
the ability of minorities to effectively par-
ticipate in the political process. One recent 
example is from Texas’ photo ID law. In 2011, 
Texas adopted a voter ID law that courts 
later found to have been passed with dis-
criminatory intent. Senate Bill 14 required 
voters to present one of the specified types of 
photo ID when voting at the polls. The Jus-
tice Department successfully blocked the 
implementation of the law in 2012 under its 
Section 5 preclearance authority. However, 
Texas began enforcing S.B. 14 shortly after 
the Shelby County decision. Although the 
bill’s proponents asserted that the law was 
necessary, both the district court and Fifth 
Circuit held that it violated Section 2 of the 
Voting Rights Act by intentionally discrimi-
nating against Black and Hispanic voters 
who were less likely to hold a required photo 
ID. 
The Texas House just passed what must be 
regarded as a voter suppression bill, after 
Texas Republicans issued civil arrest war-
rants for 52 of their Democratic colleagues 
who refused to show up to legislative votes 
because they oppose the legislation. If en-
acted, the bill would create stricter vote-by- 
mail rules, add new requirements to the vot-
ing process, ban drive-thru and 24–hour vot-
ing, bolster access for partisan poll watchers, 
and curb local voting options that would 
make voting easier. These requirements only 
build on some of the most restrictive voting 
laws in the nation from the last election 
cycle. That election night, Jolt Action, a 
group aimed at building political momentum 
among Latinos in Texas, held a get together 
at its headquarters. Artwork of youth of 
color adorned the walls of the office. One 
painting showed children holding hands be-
fore a wall, with the caption ‘‘They tried to 
bury us. They didn’t know we were seeds.’’ 
The question remains: Will voting restric-
tions scorch the earth upon which these 
seeds seek to grow, or will we see a garden of 
vibrant democracy, one tended to by federal 
and state protections, over decades to come? 
Virginia 
The post-Shelby County landscape in Vir-
ginia is devastated by rollbacks of protec-
tions for the right to vote. The Virginia re-
port prepared by Campaign Legal Center de-
tails 
ongoing 
discrimination 
exposed 
through litigation, as well as anti-voter 
laws, voter intimidation and disinformation 
campaigns, and other tactics that dispropor-
tionately burden and disenfranchise voters of 
color. 
Very recent litigation in Virginia Beach 
powerfully demonstrates the toll that dis-
crimination in voting takes on communities 
of color in the state. In March 2021, a federal 
court held that Virginia Beach’s at-large 
system for electing city council members 
violates Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act 
because it dilutes the voting strength of 
Black, Latino, and Asian American voters. 
The state’s largest city had an 11–member 
city council, composed of the mayor and 10 
councilmembers, each elected at-large for 
four-year staggered terms. The city had re-
lied upon an at-large system since 1966, but 
in 50 years, the city’s racial composition had 
changed dramatically: People of color now 
constitute 31.6 percent of the city’s popu-
lation. Despite sizable communities of color, 
only six candidates of color have ever been 
elected to Virginia Beach’s city council, and 
barring special circumstances triggered by 
the pendency of litigation under the Voting 
Rights Act, no Black candidate has ever been 
re-elected to serve a second term. 
In enjoining the at-large system, the fed-
eral court recognized that its discriminatory 
effects reflect a broader culture of racial dis-
crimination in the city and the state that 
continues to impact residents of color today: 
‘‘[t]he Commonwealth of Virginia and the 
City have histories of voter discrimination 
as it pertains to registration, voter suppres-
sion, gerrymandering, and other forms of dis-
crimination.’’ The Campaign Legal Center 
powerfully documents the many facets of 
this discrimination and concludes: ‘‘The vast 
evidence of racial discrimination this case 
has uncovered alone demonstrates the need 
for preclearance and other means of federal 
oversight to protect the right of all Ameri-
cans to vote.’’ 
The Campaign Legal Center’s report also 
sets forth discriminatory barriers to in-per-
son voting, such as the closing, consoli-
dating, and relocating of polling places docu-
mented in The Leadership Conference Edu-
cation Fund’s reports in 2016 and 2019. These 
changes no longer require preclearance and 
disproportionately impact communities of 
color. Because Virginia law caps the number 
of registered voters each precinct can serve, 
localities must create new precincts. But 
more precincts do not necessarily mean more 
polling locations in communities of color. 
Some localities opt for one polling location 
to serve multiple precincts, increasing the 
voters assigned to a single polling place. 
This increases poll wait times and transpor-
tation burdens to and from the polls. During 
the November 2020 election, Henrico Coun-
ty—30.9 percent of which is Black—consoli-
dated four polling places into existing sites. 
Because state law allows multiple precincts 
to be assigned to the same polling place, the 
county maintained separate precincts in the 
same building: each had their own poll work-
ers and entrances, heightening voter confu-
sion. 
THE TIME IS NOW TO PASS THE JOHN LEWIS 
VOTING RIGHTS ADVANCEMENT ACT 
When President Lyndon Johnson signed 
the Voting Rights Act of 1965, he declared 
the law a triumph and said, ‘‘Today we 
strike away the last major shackle of . . . 
fierce and ancient bonds.’’ But 56 years later, 
the shackles of white supremacy still re-
strict the full exercise of our rights and free-
dom to vote. 
For democracy to work for all of us, it 
must include us all. When certain commu-
nities cannot access the ballot and when 
they are not represented in the ranks of 
power, our democracy is in peril. The coordi-
nated, anti-democratic campaign to restrict 
the vote targets the heart of the nation’s 
promise: that every voice and every eligible 
vote count. Congress must meet the urgency 
of this moment and pass the John Lewis Vot-
ing Rights Advancement Act. This bill will 
restore the essential portion of the Voting 
Rights Act that blocks discriminatory vot-
ing policies before they go into effect, put-
ting a transparent process in place for pro-
tecting the right to vote. It will also bring 
down the barriers erected to silence Black, 
Indigenous, young, and new Americans and 
ensure everyone has a voice in the decisions 
impacting our lives. 
On March 7, 1965, just a few months before 
President Johnson would sign the Voting 
Rights Act into law, then 25–year-old John 
Lewis led more than 600 people across the 
Edmund Pettus Bridge to demand equal vot-
ing rights. State troopers unleashed brutal 
violence against the marchers. Lewis himself 
was beaten and bloodied. But he never gave 
up the fight. For decades, the congressman 
implored his colleagues in Congress to real-
ize the promise of equal opportunity for all 
in our democratic process. Before his death, 
he wrote: ‘‘Time is of the essence to preserve 
the integrity and promises of our democ-
racy.’’ Members of this body must now heed 
his call with all the force they can muster. 
Thank you for inviting me to testify 
today. I am pleased to answer any questions 
you may have, and I look forward to working 
with you to ensure all of us, no matter race 
or place, have an equal say in our democ-
racy.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4434 
August 24, 2021 
My name is Peyton McCrary. Although I 
have retired from 20 years of full-time uni-
versity teaching and 26 years of government 
service in the U.S. Department of Justice, I 
still co-teach a course on voting rights law 
each fall at the George Washington Univer-
sity Law School, where adjunct faculty bear 
the title Professorial Lecturer in Law. My 
testimony today is offered in my personal 
capacity as a historian, not as a representa-
tive of any organization. 
The focus of my testimony is evidence re-
garding the jurisdictions that would be cov-
ered by a new form of federal preclearance of 
voting changes, which I understand is being 
contemplated by this chamber. Representa-
tives of the Brennan Center for Justice and 
the Leadership Conference Education Fund 
asked me some months ago to investigate 
the preclearance coverage formula that is 
being considered for inclusion in the John 
Lewis 
Voting 
Rights 
Advancement 
Act 
(VRAA). An earlier version of the VRAA 
passed the House of Representatives Decem-
ber 6, 2019, as H.R. 4 and is now under consid-
eration in a new Congress. The VRAA is de-
signed to restore the preclearance provisions 
of the 1965 Voting Rights Act by revising the 
coverage formula invalidated by the Su-
preme Court in its 2013 decision in Shelby 
County v. Holder. Preclearance refers to the 
process of receiving prior federal approval 
from the Department of Justice or the U.S. 
District Court for the District of Columbia 
before implementing any change affecting 
voting. My task was to identify the jurisdic-
tions that would be subject to preclearance 
should the VRAA become law. This task re-
quired the use of research methods I have 
employed—both in my scholarly publications 
and in expert witness testimony—over the 
last four decades. For example, it calls 
among other things for methodology I ap-
plied in my sworn Declaration filed by the 
United States in Shelby County v. Holder in 
2010. 
The new formula for determining the juris-
dictions 
that 
would 
be 
subject 
to 
preclearance under the VRAA would be trig-
gered by the record of voting rights enforce-
ment. My analysis generally focuses on the 
last 25 years, currently from 1996 through 
2020, although the conclusions would change 
if the review period changed. Under some cir-
cumstances entire states would be covered; 
even if the entire state is not subject to 
preclearance, any individual political sub-
division within a state could be covered if 
the record of voting rights violations in that 
subdivision meets the criteria of the VRAA. 
My analysis derives from the last VRAA, 
which contained a coverage formula in which 
an 
entire 
state 
would 
be 
subject 
to 
preclearance if either of two patterns of vio-
lations applied: a) if 15 or more voting rights 
violations occurred within the state during 
the previous 25 years; or b) if 10 or more vio-
lations occurred in the state during the last 
25 years, at least one of which was com-
mitted by the state itself, rather than by 
local subdivisions within the state. I also un-
derstand that even if an entire state were 
not subject to preclearance, any political 
subdivision would be covered if it had three 
or more violations during the previous 25 
years. Relying on that understanding, my 
count of violations includes: a) final judg-
ments of a voting rights violation by the fed-
eral courts; b) objections to voting changes 
by the Attorney General; and c) a consent 
decree or other settlement causing a change 
favorable to minority voting rights. 
I understand that Congress may consider 
other specifics for the coverage formula. 
While I am not testifying as to any approach 
Congress should take, I note that changes to 
the formula could lead to different conclu-
sions than those I have reached. 
QUALIFICATIONS 
I am an historian by training and taught 
history at the university level from 1969 
until 1990. During the 1980s I served as an ex-
pert witness in numerous voting rights cases 
in the South. I was employed as a social 
science analyst by the Voting Section, Civil 
Rights Division, of the U.S. Department of 
Justice, from 1990 until my retirement in De-
cember 2016. My responsibilities in the Civil 
Rights Division included the planning, direc-
tion, coordination, and performance of his-
torical research and empirical analysis for 
voting rights litigation, including the identi-
fication of appropriate expert witnesses to 
appear for the government at trial. In some 
instances, I was asked to provide written or 
courtroom testimony on behalf of the United 
States. Since retiring from government serv-
ice, I have served as an expert in several vot-
ing rights cases brought by private plain-
tiffs. 
I received B.A. and M.A. degrees from the 
University of Virginia in 1965 and 1966, re-
spectively, and obtained my Ph.D. from 
Princeton University in 1972. My primary 
training was in the history of the United 
States, with a specialization in the history 
of the South during the 19th and 20th cen-
turies. For 20 years I taught courses in my 
specialization at the University of Min-
nesota, Vanderbilt University, and the Uni-
versity of South Alabama. In 1998–99 I took 
leave from the Department of Justice to 
serve as the Eugene Lang Professor of Social 
Change in the Department of Political 
Science at Swarthmore College. For the last 
fourteen years, both during government 
service and since retiring from the Depart-
ment of Justice, I have co-taught a course on 
voting rights law as an adjunct professor at 
the George Washington University Law 
School. 
I have published a prize-winning book, 
Abraham Lincoln and Reconstruction: The 
Louisiana 
Experiment 
(Princeton, 
N.J., 
Princeton University Press, 1978), six law re-
view articles, seven articles in refereed jour-
nals, and seven chapters in refereed books. 
Over the last three and a half decades my 
published work has focused on the history of 
discriminatory election laws in the South, 
evidence concerning discriminatory intent 
or racially polarized voting presented in the 
context of voting rights litigation, and the 
impact of the Voting Rights Act in the 
South. One of these studies was made part of 
the record before Congress regarding the 
adoption of the 2006 Voting Rights Reauthor-
ization Act. I continued to publish scholarly 
work in my areas of expertise while em-
ployed by the Department of Justice and ex-
pect to continue my scholarly writing now 
that I have retired from government service. 
A detailed record of my professional quali-
fications is set forth in the attached cur-
riculum vitae (Attachment 1), which I pre-
pared and know to be accurate. 
Although I write about the history of vot-
ing rights law in my scholarly publications 
and teach in a law school, I am not an attor-
ney. However, the findings reflected in court 
opinions often provide valuable evidence for 
investigations by experts. I routinely utilize 
the factual evidence provided by court deci-
sions in my scholarly writing. As I observed 
in a recent journal article: ‘‘The factual evi-
dence presented in court proceedings—in vot-
ing rights cases key evidence often comes in 
through expert witness testimony by polit-
ical scientists or historians—is an invaluable 
resource for historical and social science re-
search.’’ 
THE METHODOLOGY I HAVE EMPLOYED IN THIS 
INVESTIGATION 
Identifying final judgments in reported 
cases—and Section 5 objections interposed 
by the Attorney General—was my first task. 
In my files I already had both hard copies 
and electronic copies of many of the Section 
2 cases from 1982 to the present, and of the 
voting rights cases decided under the 14th 
Amendment before the amendment of Sec-
tion 2 in 1982. I utilized the detailed study by 
Professor Ellen Katz and her students at the 
University of Michigan Law School, which 
became part of the record before Congress for 
the 2006 Reauthorization Act (and subse-
quently published as a law review article). 
The website of the Civil Rights Division’s 
Voting Section—where I worked for 26 
years—gave ready access to the large num-
ber of final judgments and settlement docu-
ments in cases involving the United States 
(under Section 2, Section 4(e), Section 5, Sec-
tion 11(b), and Section 203). Access to 
Westlaw through GW Law School facilitated 
identification of other reported decisions 
brought on behalf of private plaintiffs that I 
counted as violations. The Voting Section’s 
website also included links to all the Attor-
ney General’s Section 5 objections from the 
1960s through the Shelby County decision in 
2013. 
Identifying consent decrees and other set-
tlements in voting rights cases was perhaps 
the most time-consuming part of the inves-
tigation. The library resources of GW Law 
School gave me access to LexisNexis Court 
Link, a database with a comprehensive col-
lection of dockets from voting rights litiga-
tion. This was the same database I had used 
to identify settlement documents in my 2010 
declaration in Shelby County v. Holder 
(cited in Note 2 above). Many Court Link 
dockets included links to electronic copies of 
consent decrees, consent orders, and other 
settlement documents. Where no links were 
available through Court Link, I had to pur-
sue further research to locate the needed evi-
dence of violations (for which the internet 
proved invaluable). Numerous publicly avail-
able reports and scholarly publications also 
helped document court-ordered settlements 
of voting rights lawsuits. 
I expect to finalize a more detailed report 
to the Brennan Center and the Leadership 
Conference soon. In my testimony today, 
however, I will summarize my findings and 
attach a listing of each violation. I hope the 
subcommittee finds this testimony useful in 
considering how to proceed with the VRAA. 
FINDINGS 
Let me begin by focusing on the eight 
states that—according to my analysis—are 
most likely to be subject to preclearance of 
voting changes. Recall that under my work-
ing understanding of the coverage formula, 
an 
entire 
state 
would 
be 
subject 
to 
preclearance if either of two patterns of vio-
lations applied: a) if 15 or more voting rights 
violations occurred within the state during 
the previous 25 years; or b) if 10 or more vio-
lations occurred in the state, at least one of 
which was committed by the state itself, 
rather than by local political subdivisions 
within the state. I treated as a violation, 
based on the last VRAA: a) a final judgment 
that a jurisdiction has violated the 14th or 
15th Amendments, violated a provision of the 
Voting 
Rights 
Act, 
or 
been 
denied 
preclearance by a three-judge federal district 
court in the District of Columbia; b) an ob-
jection to voting changes by the Attorney 
General; or c) a consent decree or other set-
tlement in a lawsuit where the defendants 
agreed to change the challenged election 
practice at issue in a manner that was favor-
able to minority plaintiffs. The exhibits 
summarize the number and type of viola-
tions that in my analysis would require fed-
eral preclearance of states if the current 
version of the coverage formula were enacted 
into law. Those states are Alabama, Florida,

H4435 
August 24, 2021 
Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Caro-
lina, South Carolina, and Texas. Exhibit 1 
identifies the violations in each of these 
states that I counted. 
Although I believe they are likely to be 
covered, there are several states that could 
drop out of coverage depending on how Con-
gress drafts the bill. Alabama, Florida, 
North Carolina, and South Carolina are the 
closest 
to 
the 
minimum 
threshold, 
so 
changes that limit what counts as a viola-
tion could drop them below 10 violations. Ad-
ditionally, shortening the review period 
would cause many states to drop out. For ex-
ample, if the review period is shortened to 20 
years, I calculate that only Georgia, Lou-
isiana, and Texas would likely be covered. At 
15 years, only Georgia and Texas would like-
ly qualify. This is not because the other 
states are covered only by virtue of ancient 
violations. To the contrary, most states I 
list here would still have numerous viola-
tions in recent years but would not meet the 
high numerical threshold under a shorter 
time period. This high numerical threshold 
ensures only states with established patterns 
of discrimination are covered, patterns that 
require a sufficient review period to capture. 
On the other hand, barring wholesale 
changes to the coverage formula or review 
period, I have concluded that Georgia, Lou-
isiana, Mississippi, and Texas are highly 
likely to be covered. 
There are also several states that I do not 
think will be covered—but they could be, de-
pending on subsequent changes in the for-
mula. Virginia could meet the threshold of 10 
violations where at least one was committed 
by the state, for example, if multiple find-
ings of independent violations within one 
case are counted as multiple violations, al-
though I currently calculate that Virginia 
has only 8 violations. New York and Cali-
fornia are each between 10–15 violations, but 
none were committed by the state. If either 
state were to commit new violations, it 
would likely bring the state into coverage. 
As I understand the current formula, even 
if an entire state would not be subject to 
preclearance, any political subdivision of 
that state in which three or more violations 
occurred in the preceding 25 years would be 
covered. The relevant political subdivision 
under this provision is the governmental 
unit responsible for voter registration—in 
most instances a county. Five political sub-
divisions in non-covered states which have 
three or more violations—which would there-
fore need to preclear voting changes—are 
itemized in Exhibit 3. The five counties are: 
Los Angeles County, California; Cook Coun-
ty, Illinois; Westchester County, New York; 
Cuyahoga County, Ohio; and Northampton 
County, Virginia. 
CONCLUSION 
I hope my analysis of the proposed cov-
erage formula is helpful to the subcommit-
tee’s current deliberations. My testimony 
today has focused on empirical analysis of 
court decisions, Section 5 objections, and 
consent decrees favorable to minority voters. 
For a moment, however, I want to emphasize 
the importance of the challenge Congress 
currently 
faces. 
When 
the 
Section 
5 
preclearance process was still functional— 
before June 2013—it was a powerful tool for 
protecting minority voting rights. The bill 
you are considering can play a key role in 
confronting current efforts to limit voter 
registration and voting by minority citizens, 
as well as diluting minority voting strength. 
Based on my 41 years of experience in voting 
rights litigation, I believe firmly that 
strengthening enforcement of the Voting 
Rights Act is a critical need for our democ-
racy.

WRITTEN STATEMENT
OF SOPHIA LIN LAKIN, 
DEPUTY DIRECTOR, VOTING RIGHTS PROJECT, 
AMERICAN CIVIL LIBERTIES UNION 
HEARING ON OVERSIGHT OF THE VOTING RIGHTS 
ACT: POTENTIAL LEGISLATIVE REFORMS—AU-
GUST 16, 2021 
Submitted to the Subcommittee on the Con-
stitution, Civil Rights, and Civil Liberties 
of the U.S. House Committee on the Judi-
ciary, August 14, 2021 
INTRODUCTION 
Chairman Cohen, Ranking Member John-
son, and Members of the Committee, thank 
you for the opportunity to testify before you 
on the critical issue of legislative reforms to 
restore and strengthen the Voting Rights 
Act. 
The ACLU Voting Rights Project was es-
tablished in 1965—the same year that the his-
toric Voting Rights Act (VRA) was enacted— 
and has litigated more than 350 cases since 
that time. Its mission is to build and defend 
an accessible, inclusive, and equitable de-
mocracy free from racial discrimination. The 
Voting Rights Project’s recent docket has 
included more than 30 lawsuits last year 
alone to protect voters during the 2020 elec-
tion; a pair of recent cases in the Supreme 
Court challenging the last administration’s 
discriminatory census policies: Department 
of Commerce v. New York (successfully chal-
lenging an attempt to add a citizenship ques-
tion to the 2020 Census), and Trump v. New 
York (challenging the exclusion of undocu-
mented immigrants from the population 
count used to apportion the House of Rep-
resentatives); challenges to voter purges and 
documentary proof of citizenship laws; and 
challenges to other new omnibus legislation 
restricting voting rights in states like Geor-
gia and Montana. 
In my capacity as Deputy Directory of the 
ACLU Voting Rights Project, I assist in the 
planning, strategy, and supervision of the 
ACLU’s voting rights litigation nationwide, 
which focuses on ensuring that all Ameri-
cans have access to the franchise, and that 
everyone is equally represented in our polit-
ical processes. I recently argued successfully 
before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sev-
enth Circuit in League of Women Voters of 
Indiana v. Sullivan, a case that challenged 
an Indiana purge program that failed to fol-
low the procedural safeguards mandated by 
the National Voter Registration Act. I am 
currently litigating or have litigated numer-
ous cases challenging racially discrimina-
tory laws under Section 2 of the Voting 
Rights Act, including Sixth District of the 
African 
Methodist 
Episcopal 
Church 
v. 
Kemp, a challenge to Georgia’s sweeping 
voter suppression law enacted in the wake of 
the 2020 elections; Thomas v. Andino, a chal-
lenge to South Carolina’s absentee ballot 
witness requirement and required ‘‘excuse’’ 
for absentee voting during the COVID–19 
pandemic; MOVE Texas v. Whitley, a chal-
lenge to a discriminatory purge program in 
Texas; Missouri State Conference of the 
NAACP v. Ferguson-Florissant School Dis-
trict, a challenge to the discriminatory at- 
large method of electing school board mem-
bers; Frank v. Walker, a challenge to Wis-
consin’s voter ID law; and North Carolina 
State Conference of the NAACP v. McCrory, 
a challenge to North Carolina’s monster 
voter suppression law passed in the imme-
diate aftermath of Shelby County v. Holder. 
More than a century ago, the Supreme 
Court famously described the right to vote 
as the one right that is preservative of all 
others. As Chief Justice John Roberts has 
explained, ‘‘[t]here is no right more basic in 
our democracy than the right to participate 
in electing our political leaders.’’ We are not 
truly free without self-government, which 
requires a vibrant participatory democracy, 
in which everyone is treated fairly in the 
process and equally represented. Unfortu-
nately, our nation has a long and well-docu-
mented record of fencing out certain voters— 
Black voters and other voters of color, in 
particular—and today that racial discrimina-
tion in voting remains a persistent and wide-
spread problem. 
The landmark Voting Rights Act (‘‘VRA’’), 
one of the signature achievements of the 
Civil Rights Movement, has been critical in 
the efforts to combat this enduring blight. 
Passed initially in 1965, and reauthorized and 
amended (with bipartisan support) in 1970, 
1975, 1982, 1992, and 2006, it is one of the most 
effective pieces of federal civil rights legisla-
tion. But eight years ago, in Shelby County 
v. Holder, the Supreme Court struck down 
the formula used to determine which juris-
dictions 
were 
covered 
by 
a 
federal 
preclearance regime. This meant that the 
heart of the VRA—the requirement that ju-
risdictions with a long record of voter sup-
pression submit proposed changes to election 
laws to federal officials before they went 
into effect—functionally ended. After Shelby 
County, the main protection afforded by the 
VRA is Section 2, which imposes a nation-
wide ban on the use of any ‘‘voting qualifica-
tion or prerequisite to voting . . . which re-
sults in a denial of abridgment of the right of 
any citizen of the United States to vote on 
account of race or color.’’ Section 2 provides 
only post-enactment relief, i.e., it authorizes 
challenges that can be brought only after a 
law has been passed or a policy implemented. 
The inadequacy of Section 2 post-enact-
ment relief as the principal means to protect 
against discrimination in voting cannot be 
overstated, and the ACLU and other civil 
rights organizations have discussed the need 
for the restoration of the prophylactic 
preclearance 
regime 
innumerable 
times. 
Even if not sufficient on its own, however, 
Section 2 remains an important and nec-
essary tool to protect voting rights, and its 
continuing vitality is critical. My written 
testimony will focus on three issues that 
have substantially weakened the force of 
post-enactment relief as a bulwark against 
discrimination: the standard for obtaining 
preliminary injunctive relief in voting rights 
cases, the use of the so-called Purcell prin-
ciple as an additional barrier to relief, and 
the Supreme Court’s recent decision in 
Brnovich 
v. 
Democratic 
National 
Com-
mittee. 
The Supreme Court’s reasoning in Shelby 
County in dismantling preclearance was pre-
mised in part on the idea that plaintiffs 
could still challenge discriminatory voting 
laws under Section 2 and win relief, includ-
ing preliminary relief, before an election oc-
curs with a discriminatory practice in effect. 
Unfortunately, this premise was deeply mis-
taken. Section 2 cases are expensive, dif-
ficult to bring, and frequently take years to 
litigate to completion—to say nothing of the 
meritorious cases that are never brought at 
all due to these costs. Theoretically, plain-
tiffs can win preliminary relief while a case 
is being litigated—freezing the status quo, 
while the court determines whether an elec-
tion practice violates federal law—but this 
too works better in theory. In practice, the 
standard for winning a preliminary injunc-
tion, which includes proving a substantial 
likelihood of success on the merits, poses a 
particularly high bar to relief in voting 
rights cases, due to their complexity and 
fact-intensive nature. This means that elec-
tions proceed under regimes ultimately 
found to be discriminatory, with no way to 
compensate voters for that harm, and with 
the victors of those tainted elections enact-
ing policy and accruing the benefits of in-
cumbency. 
Compounding 
the 
problem 
is 
the 
metastasization of the so-called Purcell prin-
ciple. Named after a short, unsigned Su-
preme Court order from 2006, which reminded 
courts to consider the potential confusion 
that may ensue if court orders, especially 
conflicting ones, issue close to an election, 
this restatement of common sense has grown 
into an almost per se bar used to deny relief 
in voting cases. Over the past decade, federal 
courts have applied Purcell ever more ag-
gressively, even when the putative concerns 
of voter confusion or administrative burden 
on elections officials that originally ani-
mated the doctrine are wholly absent, and in 
a way that tends to work in one direction: 
against 
voters 
and 
voting 
rights. 
Compounding the issue is the frequent lack 
of explanation of a court’s reasoning: appli-
cations of Purcell often appear in the form of 
unsigned orders, leaving the parties and the 
voting public with little clarity. In short, 
the expansion of Purcell has made the al-
ready difficult task of halting a discrimina-
tory regime before it can taint an election 
even harder, blocking relief even where vot-
ing rights plaintiffs are ultimately success-
ful—and even when they have demonstrated 
as much early in their case. 
Finally, the Supreme Court’s recent deci-
sion in Brnovich v. Democratic National 
Committee will make it significantly more 
difficult for voters to bring successful law-
suits to block discriminatory voting laws 
under Section 2. Under the guise of inter-
preting the statute, the Supreme Court ar-
ticulated five ‘‘guideposts’’ that will inevi-
tably make showing a discriminatory burden 
more difficult for Plaintiffs, while putting a 
thumb on the scale for government defend-
ants by allowing for the mere specter of 
voter fraud—without any evidence—to jus-
tify discriminatory practices. 
Fortunately, for all three of these issues, 
Congress has the power to act to protect vot-
ing rights. It has the clear authority to set 
standards for the issuance of preliminary re-
lief and injunctions in voting rights cases, 
and the clear ability to correct the misinter-
pretation of the VRA contained within 
Brnovich. Not only does Congress have the 
power to do so, it also has the responsibility. 
Under both the Fourteenth and Fifteenth 
Amendments, which promise equal protec-
tion under the law and the right to vote free 
of racial discrimination, respectively, Con-
gress is expressly authorized—and given the 
duty—to make these guarantees real. The 
John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act 
(‘‘JLVRAA’’), which passed the House of 
Representatives in the 116th Congress, with 
additions to address the explosive growth of 
Purcell in the 2020 election cycle and repair 
the damage to Section 2 wrought by the re-
cent Brnovich decision, would fight the seri-
ous threats to voting rights that we see 
today. 
I. The Standard for Obtaining Preliminary In-
junctive Relief 
Following Shelby County, Section 2 of the 
VRA is the heart of federal protections for 
the 
right 
to 
vote. 
Unlike 
the 
VRA’s 
preclearance regime, which applies before a 
law goes into effect, a Section 2 claim can 
only be brought after a law is already en-
acted or a policy announced. In the paradigm 
course of civil litigation, plaintiffs will file a 
lawsuit, and then after a trial on the merits, 
a court will impose money damages or issue

an injunction, i.e., an order to take or fore-
bear from taking some action. Commonly in 
civil rights litigation, these injunctions bar 
a government actor from enforcing a law 
found to violate civil rights law or the U.S. 
Constitution. Thus, under Section 2 plain-
tiffs must go to court and litigate their 
claims—a process that costs hundreds of 
thousands, if not millions, of dollars and 
often takes years—before a judge will strike 
down the law or order the practice stopped. 
In the interim, the law or practice remains 
in effect. In the context of voting rights liti-
gation, this means multiple elections involv-
ing hundreds of elected officials may be ir-
revocably tainted by taking place under a 
discriminatory regime. 
In some circumstances, however, plaintiffs 
can move for a preliminary injunction, 
which is an order that preserves the status 
quo while the lawsuit plays out. But these 
are particularly difficult to win in voting 
rights cases. One prong of the standard for 
the issuance of a preliminary injunction is a 
showing of substantial likelihood of success 
on the merits. This standard makes sense in 
many contexts: before a court acts, prior to 
a full hearing of the evidence at trial or a 
settlement, it should be confident that it has 
a good basis to do so. But the difficulties in 
obtaining 
preliminary 
relief 
under 
this 
standard in the voting rights context have 
imperiled the ability to protect voters from 
being irrevocably harmed by discriminatory 
electoral regimes. 
Voting rights cases are extremely complex 
and fact intensive, which is reflected in the 
significant expense in money and time re-
quired to litigate these cases successfully. 
And courts have required voting rights plain-
tiffs to make a substantial showing of this 
full panoply of proof in order to meet the 
likelihood of success on the merits standard 
before it will grant preliminary relief. This 
is incredibly difficult to do in a truncated 
time period, not least because voting rights 
cases frequently involve extensive statistical 
analysis of voting patterns and practices and 
plaintiffs have limited access to the informa-
tion necessary to meet this showing. As a re-
sult, regimes that are ultimately found to be 
discriminatory can irrevocably taint an elec-
tion even where plaintiffs do whatever they 
can to prevent that from happening. 
My prior written testimony before this 
subcommittee identifies 15 Section 2 cases, 
brought after the Shelby County decision, 
where plaintiffs sought a preliminary injunc-
tion unsuccessfully—only to go on to win at 
trial or reach a favorable settlement. On av-
erage, those cases took 27 months to litigate 
to the grant of relief (to say nothing of un-
successful appeals and disputes over attor-
neys’ fees). In the interim, multiple elections 
took place, millions of voters cast ballots, 
and hundreds of elected officials took office, 
under regimes courts ultimately found were 
discriminatory or that were abandoned. For 
example, in a case the ACLU and partners 
brought challenging an omnibus voter sup-
pression bill, North Carolina NAACP v. 
McCrory, despite plaintiffs moving as quick-
ly as possible and seeking a preliminary in-
junction, voters in North Carolina chose 188 
federal and state elected officials under elec-
tion rules that would be subsequently struck 
down. 
The deficiencies of litigation, with the dif-
ficulty of securing preliminary relief, are 
particularly acute in the voting rights con-
text because voting is different than other 
civil rights litigation. In cases of employ-
ment or housing discrimination based on 
membership in a protected class, at least in 
theory, going through the legal process can 
restore that person’s job or apartment, or 
make them whole through backpay or money 
damages. Elections are different: once an 
election transpires under a discriminatory 
regime, it is impossible to compensate the 
victims of voting discrimination. Their vot-
ing rights have been compromised irrev-
ocably because the election has already hap-
pened and cannot be re-run. While those vot-
ers may be able to freely vote in future elec-
tions, winners of the elections conducted 
under unlawful practices gain the benefits of 
incumbency, making it harder to dislodge 
them from office. Those elected officials will 
make policy while in office, and courts can-
not (and should not) dislodge those decisions, 
even if the mechanism under which they 
took office is later found to be unconstitu-
tional or to violate the VRA. 
The 
JLVRAA 
appropriately 
addresses 
these particular challenges by creating a 
standard for the issuance of preliminary re-
lief in voting rights cases. First, plaintiffs 
must ‘‘raise[] a serious question’’ as to 
whether the challenged practice violates the 
VRA or the U.S. Constitution. This standard 
appropriately seeks to balance the needed 
prophylactic measures to protect the right 
to vote without inviting frivolous litigation. 
Then, the court must find that the hardship 
imposed on the defendant (generally a gov-
ernment actor) is less than the hardship im-
posed on the plaintiff (the voter), giving 
‘‘due weight to the fundamental right to cast 
an effective ballot.’’ This further ensures 
that courts are not compelled to issue in-
junctions at the drop of the hat: they must 
keep in mind, in addition to whether the 
claims are meritorious, whether the relief 
would be burdensome on the defendant. 
Congress has the clear power to act here. 
The general standard for issuing preliminary 
injunctions is a judicial creation, which over 
time has developed from equitable principles 
into a four-pronged test familiar to lawyers 
and judges. However, the Supreme Court has 
made it clear—repeatedly and unequivo-
cally—that Congress has the authority to 
alter the considerations for granting equi-
table relief, which includes the issuance of 
injunctions. The Court has further explicitly 
recognized that this reasoning covers pre-
liminary relief, and that Congress can even 
make the issuance of certain injunctions 
automatic—an extreme measure compared 
to the much more modest one contained in 
the JLVRAA. In other words, ‘‘Congress may 
intervene and guide or control the exercise 
of the courts’ discretion’’—as long as it does 
so clearly. This reasoning has been applied in 
federal court cases acknowledging—and up-
holding—the legislatively modified standard 
for the issuance of preliminary injunctions. 
These cases interpret federal laws such as 
the Petroleum Marketing Practices Act, En-
dangered Species Act, National Labor Rela-
tions Act, Federal Trade Commission Act, 
and the Securities Exchange Acts of 1933 and 
1934. All of which is to say: there is a long- 
running history and unambiguous precedent 
blessing Congress’ ability to specify the con-
ditions under which a preliminary injunction 
issues. 
II. The Purcell Principle 
The current standard for obtaining a pre-
liminary 
injunction 
makes 
it 
difficult 
enough for plaintiffs to ensure that discrimi-
natory regimes are blocked before they can 
taint an election. But the problem has wors-
ened due to the expansion of the so-called 
‘‘Purcell principle.’’ As described in more de-
tail in my prior testimony, the Purcell prin-
ciple stood at one point for the commonsense 
idea that courts should be cautious in 
issuing orders which change election rules in 
the period right before an election. In recent 
years, however, the use of Purcell to block 
relief has skyrocketed and the doctrine has 
become something much broader, bearing 
little resemblance to the guidance given in 
the brief, unsigned order that is its name-
sake. The Purcell of today displaces the 
case-specific analysis required for injunc-
tions and operates as an almost per se bar on 
granting relief in voting rights cases, in 
some (nebulously defined) period before an 
election. This has real effects: as outlined in 
my prior testimony, injunctions are fre-
quently blocked by Purcell, even in cases 
where plaintiffs ultimately to go on—after 
the lengthy process of litigation—to win re-
lief. The use of Purcell is only expanding, 
and left unchecked, it threatens to kneecap 
voting rights litigation nationwide. 
First, Purcell today is invoked even when 
there is no risk of voter confusion, zero or 
minimal administrative burden, and where 
plaintiffs have acted quickly. An illustrative 
example is Republican National Committee 
v. Democratic National Committee. As the 
COVID–19 pandemic spread, Wisconsin saw a 
last-minute deluge of absentee ballot appli-
cations for primary elections held April 7, 
2020, and elections officials struggled to proc-
ess them quickly. Finding that the require-
ment for a witness signature as applied to a 
subset of voters and the absentee ballot re-
ceipt deadline were likely unconstitutional 
under the circumstances, the court prelimi-
narily enjoined the witness requirement for 
those voters and extended the absentee bal-
lot receipt deadline by six days, requiring 
the state to count ballots so long as they 
were received by April 13th (even if post-
marked after Election Day). Although elec-
tions officials did not contest the injunction, 
private intervenors won partial stays of the 
injunction at the Seventh Circuit (as to the 
witness signature) and the Supreme Court 
(as to the postmark requirement), with both 
courts relying on Purcell. There was, how-
ever, no risk of voter confusion: voters were 
merely waiting to receive their ballot, and 
the district court’s order would merely allow 
it to be counted. Nor was there risk of ad-
ministrative burden: instead, elections offi-
cials had a few extra days to process an un-
precedented number of absentee ballot appli-
cations. Indeed, the two applications of Pur-
cell themselves imposed additional burdens 
on elections officials—during the first weeks 
of an unprecedented, deadly pandemic—and 
created the chaotic, confusing dynamic that 
Purcell theoretically counsels against. My 
prior written testimony includes several 
other examples that, taken together, show 
how the Purcell principle has been used to 
block relief frequently in cases where the 
stated concerns of the Purcell decision 
itself—the need to avoid confusing voters 
and imposing burdens on election officials 
and the election system—are not present. 
Second, the use of the Purcell principle ap-
pears to apply primarily in one direction 
only: to bar efforts to expand access to the 
ballot. Here, the cases in which Purcell does 
not apply can be just as revealing as the sit-
uations in which it does. For example, in 
Minnesota in the lead-up to the 2020 general 
election, voting rights plaintiffs and state of-
ficials entered into a consent decree in state 
court that allowed all ballots postmarked on 
or before Election Day, and received within 
seven days after, to be counted. In Carson v. 
Simon, a new set of plaintiffs sued, seeking 
a preliminary injunction blocking implemen-
tation of the consent decree on September 
24—almost eight weeks after the decree was 
entered—which was denied on October 12. On 
appeal, the Eighth Circuit reversed, enjoin-
ing the state court order and therefore mov-
ing up the absentee ballot deadline, in an 
opinion issued five days before the general 
election. It is hard to imagine a situation 
where Purcell is more applicable: here, the 
requested order came at the eleventh hour, 
risked a great deal of voter confusion, and 
imposed serious administrative burdens as

state officials subsequently struggled to 
comply with the new ballot receipt deadline. 
Nevertheless, the court declined to apply 
Purcell. Other examples demonstrating this 
one-directional application are described in 
my prior written testimony. 
Third, in some instances, too, appeals 
courts invoking Purcell to stay relief grant-
ed by a district court (and the increasing 
regularity of such stays) create the very 
voter confusion and administrative burdens 
that the Purcell principle in theory aims to 
avoid. For example, in Frank v. Walker, the 
district court issued a preliminary injunc-
tion against Wisconsin’s voter ID law, and 
nearly 12,000 absentee ballots were mailed to 
voters without instructions on providing 
identification, hundreds of which were cast 
without the required documents. The Sev-
enth Circuit stayed this order, without any 
mention of the voters who were merely fol-
lowing instructions given to them by the 
state; fortunately, the Supreme Court lifted 
the stay. But as elections have become in-
creasingly litigated, and Purcell has become 
an increasingly prominent doctrine, these 
situations will reoccur. Most concerningly, 
in a 2020 challenge to South Carolina’s ab-
sentee ballot witness requirement, the Su-
preme Court stayed an injunction that had 
been affirmed by the en banc Fourth Circuit, 
with three members of the Supreme Court 
expressing the view that any votes that had 
already been cast in reliance on the injunc-
tion should not be counted. It should be be-
yond debate that voters who merely relied in 
good faith on instructions from elections of-
ficials in casting their ballots should not be 
disenfranchised due to Purcell. 
Finally, all these problems are exacerbated 
by the fact that in Purcell-based orders, 
courts have frequently failed to explain their 
decisions; instead, the parties and the public 
are made to guess at basic parameters of the 
doctrine, such as how long the relevant pe-
riod is, what counts as an election rule, and 
how to factor in voters’ reliance interests. 
Typically, orders in federal courts follow full 
briefing, oral argument (as need be), and ju-
dicial research and drafting, a process which 
can often take months. The product of this is 
a reasoned opinion that assures the parties 
that their arguments got a fair hearing and 
provides guidance as to the rules of the road 
going forward. Purcell departs sharply from 
this practice, and in fact, the development of 
the principle occurred almost entirely in a 
series of four unsigned orders in the 2014 
election. These brief orders provide little 
guidance to voters or litigations—and feed 
speculation that decisions are based on polit-
ical concerns. While the exigent nature of 
election cases may sometimes leave courts 
with little time to craft a lengthy opinion, 
courts can always issue an order and follow 
up with an opinion explaining their rea-
soning. Instead, the lack of written opinions 
means there is no way to ensure the Purcell 
principle is being applied consistently—or 
even define what the Purcell principle is. 
As with the preliminary injunction stand-
ard, Congress’ ability to act here is clear. 
The manner under which injunctions issue, 
the concerns courts should take into consid-
eration (and those they should not), and the 
way to weigh competing interests are all 
matters within Congress’ power to define. In 
the context of Purcell, this could look like 
defining a specific, measurable period in 
which changes are disfavored, for legitimate 
reasons—to avoid the Purcell window grow-
ing ever larger and even more unmoored 
from its foundations. Congress could also 
clearly state the public’s interest in ensuring 
free and fair access to the ballot, and how 
that interest should be weighed against ad-
ministrative concerns. It could specify ex-
actly what forms of voter confusion courts 
should keep in mind and how to best mini-
mize that confusion. Finally, it could pro-
vide guidance to courts reflecting the reality 
that sometimes, unforeseen events—whether 
an unprecedented pandemic or the actions of 
elections officials—occur and that this is no 
reason to abdicate their responsibility to 
safeguard the constitutional right to vote. 
III. Brnovich v. Democratic National Committee 
and Potential Fixes 
On July 1, 2021, the Supreme Court released 
its decision in Brnovich v. Democratic Na-
tional Committee, and in doing so, weakened 
federal protections for voting rights even 
further. The case concerned two Arizona re-
strictions that had a disproportionate im-
pact on Native American and other commu-
nities of color, and which the plaintiffs chal-
lenged as violating Section 2: a ban on the 
collection of early ballots and a rule man-
dating that ballots cast in person at the 
wrong precinct be discarded entirely, rather 
than counted for the offices for which that 
voter is eligible to vote. In the decision, re-
versing an en banc panel of the Ninth Circuit 
striking down the two requirements under 
Section 2, the Supreme Court set out five so- 
called ‘‘guideposts’’—untethered to the ac-
tual text of the statute—in assessing Section 
2 claims. The decision and these guideposts 
will make it harder to bring successful Sec-
tion 2 claims. 
The Court’s decision in Brnovich under-
mines the purpose of Section 2 to provide a 
powerful tool to root out discrimination in 
voting—no matter how blunt or subtle—in 
numerous ways. But broadly speaking, the 
Court’s decision did two things to make it 
harder to bring successful Section 2 claims. 
First, the Court ratcheted up the bar for 
plaintiffs to establish a discriminatory bur-
den on the right to vote. Section 2 calls for 
an inquiry based on ‘‘the totality of the cir-
cumstances,’’ into whether ‘‘political proc-
esses . . . are not equally open’’ to people of 
color—or, in other words, whether a practice 
imposes 
a 
burden 
on 
voters 
of 
color. 
Brnovich introduced into this inquiry wheth-
er the burden imposed by a challenged prac-
tice is, in a court’s view, akin to the ‘‘usual 
burdens of voting,’’ finding those to be essen-
tially per se permissible under Section 2. Ab-
sent from the analysis is a discussion of 
whether the so-called ‘‘usual’’ burdens of 
voting are equally burdensome to all voters, 
particularly to voters of different racial 
groups. Though the decision refers to ‘‘mere 
inconvenience,’’ the difficulty of, say, driv-
ing to a mail box is very different on a re-
mote Native American reservation where 
residents do not receive postal service at 
their doors, and are also much less likely to 
have access to cars than it is for other vot-
ers. The Court also found relevant ‘‘the de-
gree to which a voting rule departs from 
what was standard practice . . . in 1982.’’ But 
this ignores that the reauthorization of the 
VRA in 1982, just as in 1965, was motivated 
by a desire to change state election rules and 
eradicate the racially discriminatory meas-
ures that remained—not grandfather them 
into law. By introducing these irrelevant 
considerations into the Section 2 analysis, 
Brnovich will make it more difficult for 
plaintiffs to prove their cases. 
Second, the Court also ratcheted down the 
bar for jurisdictions to defend restrictions on 
voting with a disparate impact. In par-
ticular, Brnovich imports into this inquiry— 
without any grounding in text or history—a 
state’s asserted interest in preventing elec-
tion fraud, even when wholly unsubstan-
tiated with actual evidence, which it gratu-
itously referred to as ‘‘strong and entirely 
legitimate,’’ before concluding that rules 
justified with reference to these interests are 
‘‘less likely to violate § 2.’’ The lower court 
in Brnovich found the offered justification of 
voter fraud for the ban on ballot collection— 
particularly important to Native American 
communities, who often lack adequate trans-
portation or regular postal service—to be 
tenuous, due to the utter absence of voter 
fraud in Arizona. On this point, the Supreme 
Court again disagreed, and went further: 
holding that states are under no obligation 
to provide any evidence of an actual history 
or risk of fraud within their borders, or to 
show how a challenged rule actually would 
prevent election fraud. 
Fortunately, Brnovich was a decision 
based on a statutory interpretation, rather 
than a constitutional holding. This means 
Congress can correct the Court’s misinter-
pretation of Section 2 and restore the VRA’s 
full protections against discrimination in 
voting. We urge Congress to add such a legis-
lative response to the JLVRAA. 
At a minimum, any efforts to respond to 
Brnovich should make clear that any voting 
practice that interacts with historical and 
socioeconomic factors to result in discrimi-
nation against voters of color runs afoul of 
Section 2. This is the case whether or not the 
practice existed or was widespread in 1982, or 
any other year. Further, whether or not a 
court finds a burden to be one of the so- 
called ‘‘usual’’ burdens of voting should not 
factor into the analysis. A voting practice 
could well be a mere inconvenience for some 
voters, but a serious burden for others, to 
the point where they cannot meet it and are 
thus disenfranchised. 
Any 
statutory 
language 
addressing 
Brnovich should also directly give courts 
guidance on how to weigh racially discrimi-
natory burdens against state arguments that 
a measure is necessary to protect election 
integrity. Congress must establish that ju-
risdictions must do more than simply articu-
late unsubstantiated fears to justify dis-
criminatory restrictions on voting. If a law 
imposes a discriminatory burden on voters of 
color, jurisdictions should, at a minimum, be 
required to submit evidence that the restric-
tion actually advances a particular and im-
portant governmental interest. But the anal-
ysis should not end there: voters should also 
be allowed to prove how the challenged 
measure is pretextual or how there are alter-
native means to get at the same goal—with-
out imposing the same racially discrimina-
tory burden. 
There are different ways Congress can do 
this. Congress could, for example, adopt an 
approach that codifies the relevant factors 
(e.g., the practice’s interaction with histor-
ical and socioeconomic factors), and non-rel-
evant factors (e.g., whether the practice ex-
isted in 1982). It could also adopt a burden- 
shifting approach modeled on the frame-
works for addressing employment discrimi-
nation in Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 
1965 or housing discrimination in the Fair 
Housing Act, which could give guidance to 
courts as to what evidence a state needs to 
support an asserted interest, and how to 
weigh that interest against evidence of a dis-
criminatory result. But Congress should act 
to restore Section 2 to the powerful weapon 
to combat discrimination that it was in-
tended to be. 
CONCLUSION 
For each of these three issues—the dif-
ficulty winning preliminary relief, the ag-
gressive expansion of Purcell, and the mis-
interpretation of Section 2 in Brnovich— 
there is a common thread: Congress has the 
power to act. Congress has clear authority to 
set the standards for the issuance of prelimi-
nary relief and has repeatedly done so in nu-
merous federal statutes to address different 
contexts. The JLVRAA would make prelimi-
nary injunctions available if plaintiffs raise

‘‘a serious question’’ as to the merits, which 
would act as a prophylactic to safeguard the 
right to vote, and is appropriate given the 
impossibility of remedying voting discrimi-
nation after the fact. Congress further has 
the power to define the public interest to in-
clude the public’s interest in representative 
government, elected by the broadest swath 
of eligible voters possible, and to provide 
guidance to federal courts on the period in 
which election-related injunctions can be 
issued. And finally, Congress has the unques-
tioned authority to clarify its intent and fix 
erroneous interpretations of its laws, such as 
the recent Brnovich decision. In fact, the 
current version of Section 2 was enacted by 
Congress in 1982 to respond directly to a Su-
preme Court case that similarly misgauged 
Congress’ meaning. The 1982 amendments to 
Section 2 thus provides a model for Congress 
to act again to ensure that voting rights are 
subject to robust protections consistent with 
this body’s intent. 
These amendments to the VRA are not 
merely within Congress’ power—they are its 
responsibility. The Fourteenth and Fifteenth 
Amendments, which respectively guarantee 
the right to due process and equal protection 
under the law and the right to vote without 
discrimination based on race, expressly give 
Congress the power to enforce their guaran-
tees. This is no accident: the Reconstruction 
Amendments were passed in the wake of a 
Civil War which was in part precipitated by 
a Supreme Court decision. The drafters of 
the amendments were well aware that the re-
sponsibility to protect voting rights could 
not be left entirely with the court system, 
and therefore purposely gave this duty to 
Congress. Although this country has made 
incredible progress since the enactment of 
those amendments, this obligation is ongo-
ing. When other institutions tasked with 
protecting constitutional rights, such as 
courts and state governments, fail to do so, 
this body has the responsibility to intervene. 
I thank you again for the opportunity to 
testify in front of this subcommittee on 
these issues.

HOUSE
OF
REPRESENTA-
TIVES—AUGUST 16, 2021 
Thank you for the opportunity to testify in 
support of strengthening the Voting Rights 
Act (‘‘VRA’’), a law that has played a crit-
ical role in safeguarding American democ-
racy against pernicious, persistent threats of 
discrimination in the election system. The 
Brennan Center for Justice at NYU School of 
Law strongly supports this Committee’s ef-
forts to restore and revitalize the VRA, 
through the John Lewis Voting Rights Ad-
vancement Act (‘‘VRAA’’). 
The VRA is widely considered the most 
successful civil rights legislation in our na-
tion’s history. Unfortunately, the Supreme 
Court has seriously hampered its effective-
ness. First, in Shelby County v. Holder, the 
Court 
rendered 
inoperable 
the 
law’s 
preclearance provisions, which had stopped 
many discriminatory voting practices from 
ever going into effect in selected jurisdic-
tions with a history of discrimination. More 
recently, in Brnovich v. DNC, the Court 
sharply limited voters’ ability to challenge 
discriminatory practices under the nation-
wide protections against voting discrimina-
tion in Section 2 of the law. Although these 
decisions have seriously wounded the VRA, 
they also make clear that Congress has the 
power to restore and bolster the law. 
The need to strengthen the VRA is espe-
cially urgent now, as a decade’s worth of ef-
forts to restrict voting rights have reached a 
fever pitch. As I previously testified, states 
across the country are rapidly passing new 
laws rolling back voting access—many of 
them targeting voters of color. These new 
laws are being implemented on top of a host 
of other discriminatory voting practices that 
have been put in place or attempted in re-
cent years. We are also headed into a redis-
tricting cycle, following last week’s release 
of Census data, that is expected to be charac-
terized by racial discrimination and severe 
gerrymandering targeting communities of 
color. 
The VRAA is designed to address these cur-
rent problems and meet current needs, while 
taking account of the concerns the Supreme 
Court identified with the 2006 reauthoriza-
tion of the law. I submit this testimony to 
supplement the record of persistent race dis-
crimination in voting that creates the need 
for the VRAA, and to explain how the VRAA 
is an appropriate, carefully tailored exercise 
of congressional authority to combat that 
discrimination. 
I. New Evidence that Race Discrimination in 
Voting, and its Effects, Persist 
Despite the progress made in the decades 
following the VRA’s initial enactment, race 
discrimination in voting is still a very real— 
and in some places a growing—problem. The 
record this Committee has amassed in recent 
months, including evidence submitted by the 
Brennan Center, shows overwhelming evi-
dence of contemporary voting discrimina-
tion. While the evidence shows that race dis-
crimination in voting is widespread, it also 
shows that it is especially powerful and per-
sistent in certain geographic areas, includ-
ing in a number of states that were pre-
viously covered by Section 5 of the VRA be-
cause of their past histories of discrimina-
tion in voting. 
Our recent and forthcoming research pro-
vides even more evidence of the impact and 
persistence of discrimination in voting, un-
derscoring the acute need for the VRAA. 
A. Persistent Racial Turnout Gaps 
A recently published analysis by the Bren-
nan Center’s Kevin Morris and Coryn Grange 
demonstrates that turnout among nonwhite 
voters remains significantly lower than that 
among white voters. Even with record over-
all turnout in the 2020 election, there was a 
significant turnout gap between white and 
nonwhite voters. Overall, 70.9 percent of eli-
gible white voters cast ballots in the 2020 
election, compared to only 58.4 percent of 
nonwhite voters. In fact, as the graph 
below—reproduced from the Brennan Cen-
ter’s published analysis—demonstrates, the 
turnout gap between white and nonwhite 
voters has gone virtually unchanged since 
2014, and it has grown since its modern-era 
lows in 2008 and 2012. And even when the gap 
between Black and white voters was clos-
ing—a trend that has sadly reversed course 
in recent years—Latino and Asian American 
voters lagged far behind their white counter-
parts in participation. (This is true of Native 
American voters as well, though their num-
bers are too small for inclusion in the census 
data.) 
While our research does not examine 
whether or the extent to which voter sup-
pression efforts caused this gap to persist— 
and at some points, widen—it does dem-
onstrate that the temporary closure of the 
Black-white voting gap in 2008 and 2012 was 
anomalous. This is particularly significant 
in light of the Shelby County Court’s reli-
ance on evidence that this gap had sup-
posedly closed by 2013 to question Congress’s 
justification for preclearance. 
B. Larger Turnout Gaps in Previously Cov-
ered Jurisdictions 
According to more recent census data, de-
scribed in a forthcoming Brennan Center 
analysis by Coryn Grange, Peter Miller, and 
Kevin Morris, the racial turnout gaps are 
even starker in the states likely to be sub-
ject to preclearance under the VRAA. In re-
cent years, white voter turnout has vastly 
exceeded nonwhite turnout in virtually 
every 
state 
previously 
subject 
to 
preclearance, and in some areas, the progress 
made in the decades leading up to Shelby 
County has all but vanished. 
Our analysis finds that, after hitting his-
toric lows immediately before Shelby Coun-
ty in 2012, the white-Black turnout gap has 
significantly grown in almost every state 
previously covered by the VRA. In South 
Carolina, for example, the white-Black turn-
out gap has grown by 21 percentage points 
since 2012, to 15 percent. In Texas and Vir-
ginia, the gap has grown by 13 percentage 
points, to 11 percent and 13 percent, respec-
tively. In Louisiana, the gap has grown by 11 
percentage points, to 7 percent. And in North 
Carolina, which was not covered in its en-
tirety but had a number of covered political 
subdivisions, the gap has grown by 17 per-
centage points, to 3 percent. These are dra-
matic shifts in only eight years. In most of 
the states mentioned here, the turnout gap 
between Black and white voters grew from a 
slight gap in favor of Black voters to a sig-
nificant gap in favor of white voters. 
The data also indicates that the post- 
Shelby County racial turnout gaps are more 
than a Black and white issue. The total 
white-nonwhite turnout gap has grown since 
2012 in five of the eight states likely to be 
covered under the VRAA. And the racial 
turnout gap is especially large for Hispanics. 
In Georgia and Virginia, for example, the 
non-Hispanic white-Hispanic turnout gap 
was 26 percentage points in 2020. In Texas, it 
was 19 percentage points. 
C. Discriminatory Voting Barriers in 2020 
In addition to a growing turnout gap 
among white and nonwhite voters, the 2020 
election saw a proliferation of discrimina-
tory voting barriers. A forthcoming report 
by the Brennan Center’s Will Wilder catalogs 
the wide range of barriers, disparate burdens, 
and discrimination voters of color faced dur-
ing the 2020 election cycle. These included 
new restrictive voting laws, racially dis-
criminatory voter roll purges, disparities in 
mail delivery and in mail ballot processing 
times that were exacerbated by the Covid–19 
pandemic, long lines and closed polling 
places, racially-targeted voter intimidation, 
and targeted misinformation campaigns. 
Perhaps more than in any other year in re-
cent history, elected officials and political 
operatives were direct about their intentions 
to shrink the electorate in 2020, at times 
with explicit or thinly-veiled references to 
race. These statements of discriminatory in-
tent are important context for the range of 
discriminatory results seen in 2020. 
As we have previously testified, the push 
to disenfranchise voters of color continued 
after the election, as the Trump campaign 
and others filed frivolous lawsuits aimed at 
tossing out the votes of Black voters in 
urban centers and other voters of color. This 
litigation and the lies used to justify it 
helped spur on violent attacks on the Cap-
itol. The same lies laid the rhetorical 
groundwork for a new wave of restrictive 
voting legislation this year unlike anything 
we have seen since the VRA’s enactment in 
1965. Our most up-to-date research shows

that 18 states enacted 30 new laws restricting 
access to voting between January 1 and July 
14, 2021. 
D. Discriminatory Plans to Reduce Represen-
tation 
The Brennan Center’s recent report, ‘‘Rep-
resentation for Some,’’ authored by Yurij 
Rudensky et al., offers additional evidence of 
the growing risk of race discrimination in 
voting. This study analyzes the impact of a 
voting change that is being pushed in a num-
ber of states—namely, the exclusion of non- 
citizens and children under 18 from the popu-
lation base used to draw electoral districts. 
Using data from Texas, Georgia, and Mis-
souri, the report finds that adopting an adult 
citizen redistricting base would have a sub-
stantial and disparate effect on communities 
of color, particular Latino communities. 
While to date no state has adopted an 
adult citizen redistricting base, these find-
ings are relevant to Congress’s inquiry be-
cause there is an ongoing effort to adopt 
such a change, including in states that were 
previously subject to preclearance and would 
likely be covered under the VRAA. This 
change is being pursued with the express 
knowledge that its principal impact would 
be to disadvantage communities and voters 
of color. For example, Thomas Hofeller, a 
prominent conservative redistricting strate-
gist who helped draw maps after the 2010 cen-
sus in Alabama, Florida, North Carolina, and 
Texas that were later struck down by courts 
as discriminatory, indicated in a memo 
shared with conservative strategists that 
changing the apportionment base would be 
‘‘advantageous to Republicans and non-His-
panic Whites.’’ The substantial risk that 
states and localities will adopt a discrimina-
tory adult citizen redistricting base further 
underscores the need for robust protections 
under the Voting Rights Act. 
II. The VRAA’s Preclearance Provisions Effec-
tively Target the Problem of Voting Dis-
crimination 
The VRAA’s preclearance provisions are 
well designed to target the persistent prob-
lem of voting discrimination in a manner 
consistent with constitutional requirements. 
The bill includes a coverage formula that 
will effectively remedy and deter illegal dis-
crimination without casting the net so wide-
ly that it imposes burdens on jurisdictions 
where ordinary litigation is sufficient to 
stop discrimination. It does so by carefully 
targeting coverage to jurisdictions and con-
duct where discrimination is most prevalent, 
reflecting current conditions and recent his-
torical experience, as the original formula 
did in 1965. It introduces a geographic cov-
erage formula that triggers only in jurisdic-
tions with recent histories of verifiable vot-
ing discrimination. It also establishes lim-
ited nationwide preclearance for certain 
practices that have been used frequently to 
discriminate against voters of color. 
A. The VRA’s Preclearance Provisions Are 
Necessary and Warranted 
These preclearance provisions are well jus-
tified by the extensive record before Con-
gress. 
First, the record before Congress makes 
clear that preclearance is, unfortunately, 
still necessary to root out persistent dis-
crimination. As we have previously testified 
(and as the Supreme Court previously recog-
nized), litigation is emphatically not enough 
to prevent discrimination where it is re-
peated; preclearance is necessary. Litigation 
is costly, slow, and often allows discrimina-
tory rules to govern pending a decision. In 
some cases, like our recently completed law-
suit challenging Texas’s strict voter ID law, 
multiple elections occur under discrimina-
tory practices before a judicial resolution al-
ters or eliminates them. A favorable decision 
in such a case cannot un-suppress lost votes, 
reallocate spent resources, or restore con-
fidence in citizens whose efforts to register 
and 
vote 
were 
wrongfully 
denied. 
Preclearance, by comparison, is a fast proc-
ess that prevents certain discriminatory 
measures from taking effect in the first 
place. The pre-Shelby regime showed the ef-
fectiveness of cutting off discriminatory 
laws and practices at the pass rather than 
leaving citizens to pick up the burden of 
challenging them. The last eight years have 
shown the harm that can be done without 
the specter of preclearance deterring and 
blocking harmful laws. Indeed, in many ju-
risdictions, as soon as a discriminatory law 
or practice was successfully challenged, the 
legislature or other public officials took 
steps to put another voting restriction in its 
place. As voting barriers have proliferated, 
so have voting rights lawsuits, reaching un-
precedented highs in recent years. Without 
congressional action, this trend shows no 
signs of abating. 
Second, the record before Congress shows 
the importance of applying preclearance to 
elections at the federal, state, and local lev-
els. Discriminatory laws and practices do not 
just plague federal elections. They also exist 
in school board, county commission, and 
state house elections, as the extensive testi-
mony compiled by Professor Peyton McCrary 
shows. These elections have significant con-
sequences; they can determine issues ranging 
from the educational resources provided to 
minority voters’ children to whether rep-
resentatives of minority communities are 
present at the redistricting table. Unless all 
eligible voters are able to participate in all 
elections free from discrimination, our soci-
ety is not achieving the promise of equal jus-
tice for all. 
Third, as discussed below, the record before 
Congress supports the application of a geo-
graphic coverage formula to target jurisdic-
tions where voting discrimination is most 
rampant. And while I do not cover this in my 
testimony, I believe that the record also sup-
ports a practice-based trigger to target prac-
tices that are frequently applied to discrimi-
nate against minority voters. Requiring 
preclearance for certain voting practices 
that are known to be inherently discrimina-
tory is an effective way to target the VRAA 
as efficiently as possible at the worst forms 
of discrimination. 
B. The VRAA’s Geographic Coverage Formula 
Is Well Designed to Target and Root Out 
Rampant Discrimination 
While discrimination in voting is wide-
spread overall, the record before this Com-
mittee shows that certain jurisdictions tend 
to perpetrate voting discrimination much 
more than others. It is therefore appropriate 
for Congress to include a geographic-based 
trigger for preclearance so as to focus reme-
dial attention on the places where discrimi-
nation is persistent and pervasive. 
The VRAA’s geographic coverage formula 
is effectively designed to target places where 
discrimination is recent, widespread, and 
persistent. 
i. The formula relies on the best evidence 
of discrimination. The formula identifies 
those jurisdictions where the problem of dis-
crimination is the greatest by focusing on 
the best evidence for determining where 
there is a problem to remedy: a jurisdiction’s 
recent violations of laws prohibiting race 
discrimination. 
Specifically, 
the 
VRAA 
looks to law violations reflected in court or-
ders, DOJ objection letters, or settlements 
that were either entered by a court or con-
tained an admission of liability and lead to a 
change in voting practices. The volume of 
litigation in and of itself is a probative way 
to identify where persistent discrimination 
is taking place; where a jurisdiction is re-
peatedly discriminating against its citizens, 
one would expect those citizens to file re-
peated lawsuits. 
But the mere filing of a lawsuit is not 
enough to trigger coverage under the VRAA; 
there must also be formal findings that a 
violation occurred. In other words, the bill 
looks to objective indicia that discrimina-
tion actually occurred. Not surprisingly, 
legal findings of voting discrimination are 
more common in jurisdictions that were pre-
viously 
covered 
under 
the 
VRA’s 
preclearance regime. As Professors Morgan 
Kousser and William Kenan testified, more 
than five out of every six successful voting 
rights lawsuits between 1957 and 2019 oc-
curred in places that were previously cov-
ered, even though for most of that time 
preclearance prevented the implementation 
of discriminatory laws in those jurisdictions. 
ii. The formula’s high numeric threshold 
for violations over a 25-year review period 
identifies persistent patterns of discrimina-
tion. The VRAA sets numeric thresholds to 
capture only those states with an established 
pattern of discriminatory conduct. Specifi-
cally, as previously introduced, the bill 
would capture only those states with 10 vio-
lations, at least one of which was statewide, 
or 15 total violations, over the prior 25 years. 
These high numeric thresholds mean that 
the 
VRAA’s 
geographic 
coverage 
for 
preclearance will apply only to those juris-
dictions that continue to exhibit discrimina-
tion despite successful litigation. In other 
words, the preclearance coverage formula is 
specifically tailored to remedy race discrimi-
nation where case-by-case litigation has 
proven ineffective or inefficient. (While the 
bill’s requirement of 10 separate, inde-
pendent findings of discrimination is helpful 
to identify the states where the problem has 
been most difficult to root out, it also means 
that some states with quite a bit of discrimi-
nation will not be covered unless the dis-
crimination continues over time. In those 
states, voters will have to rely on the other 
remedies in the VRA.) 
The geographic coverage formula’s 25-year 
review period is necessary to assess which of 
those jurisdictions with current records of 
discrimination also exhibit a persistent, 
longstanding pattern of discrimination justi-
fying preclearance. This time period encom-
passes two redistricting cycles and a suffi-
cient number of electoral cycles to identify 
patterns of discrimination. The length of the 
review period justifies the high numeric 
threshold for violations, and vice versa. 
iii. The formula limits coverage to states 
with recent discrimination. The geographic 
coverage formula is also designed to ensure 
that only those states with a continuing, 
current problem of discrimination are cov-
ered. As discussed further below, the 25-year 
review period works in tandem with other 
provisions of the bill to ensure that jurisdic-
tions will only be covered if they have com-
mitted violations recently. First, states that 
meet the coverage threshold are only subject 
to preclearance for 10 years, after which 
older violations will no longer be considered. 
Second, as also discussed below, states that 
do not have any violations within the past 10 
years can easily bail out of preclearance, and 
Congress can streamline the bail-out process 
even further. 
As a factual matter, the formula will not 
cover jurisdictions that only committed vio-
lations a long time ago, nor will it cover ju-
risdictions that only committed a small 
number of violations over a short period of 
time.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4443 
August 24, 2021 
Based on Peyton McCrary’s testimony sub-
mitted for this hearing, the VRAA will like-
ly cover eight states, all of which were cov-
ered under the VRA pre-Shelby County: Ala-
bama, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Mis-
sissippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, and 
Texas. Assuming Congress also authorizes 
coverage of political subdivisions with at 
least three of their own violations, the fol-
lowing local jurisdictions would also be cov-
ered, only one of which was previously cov-
ered (because it was within a covered state): 
Los Angeles County, California, Cook Coun-
ty, Illinois, Westchester County, New York, 
Cuyahoga County, Ohio, and Northampton 
County, Virginia. Each of these states and 
political subdivisions has large minority 
populations. (Mr. McCrary’s testimony also 
concludes that California, New York, and 
Virginia are close to coverage. Were Cali-
fornia or New York to have one statewide 
violation, it would bring either state into 
coverage. While Virginia only has eight vio-
lations by Mr. McCrary’s count, two state-
wide, that number could rise to 10 if Con-
gress drafts the bill to count independent 
findings of violations within one case or ob-
jection letter as independent violations.) 
Each of the covered states has at least one 
violation within the past decade, and most 
have multiple violations. In addition, each 
covered state has seen violations spread over 
a long time period; in no state are the viola-
tions concentrated in a time period shorter 
than 14 years. Each state is treated equally, 
and each has an equal opportunity to roll out 
of preclearance if it stops engaging in a pat-
tern of discrimination. 
iv. The formula appropriately targets local 
jurisdictions where discrimination is preva-
lent. The VRAA’s geographic coverage for-
mula is designed to cover states with con-
sistent patterns of discrimination. Some 
have argued that subjecting political sub-
divisions within states to preclearance based 
on violations committed by the state itself 
and by other subdivisions is not fair. How-
ever, as I explain here, doing so is both rea-
sonable on principle and consistent with past 
practice. 
Local jurisdictions do not exist in isola-
tion. They are embedded within larger com-
munities and larger jurisdictions, including 
states. From a legal standpoint, as I discuss 
further below, political subdivisions are 
‘‘mere creatures of the State’’; as one court 
noted, ‘‘no legal distinction exists between 
State and local officials’’ for the purpose of 
preclearance. Our electoral system distrib-
utes election administration responsibility 
between local and state election officials. 
When a person votes, their selections for 
local, state, and federal offices are often re-
corded on the same ballot, and they are sub-
ject to the same policies and burdens when 
casting each of these votes. Perhaps more 
importantly, when a voter casts their ballot, 
they are participating in and affected by a 
political culture that does not necessarily 
stop at their town or county’s borders. When 
this political culture has a demonstrated 
record of discrimination, it is not unreason-
able to presume that all jurisdictions within 
it should be subject to preclearance. Indeed, 
state officeholders that engage in discrimi-
natory practices are elected by people within 
each of the state’s political subdivisions. 
Past practice under the VRA demonstrates 
that state coverage is a reasonable way to 
identify local jurisdictions where discrimina-
tion is prevalent. The VRA previously sub-
jected states and all their political subdivi-
sions to preclearance based on statewide 
turnout figures and the use of tests and de-
vices, regardless of the specific figures and 
practices within each subdivision. In prac-
tice, this successfully identified those juris-
dictions where discrimination was most like-
ly to occur. A quick review of the Justice 
Department’s objections to voting policies 
demonstrates that the vast majority of ob-
jections were to local-level policies in cov-
ered states. For example, the Department of 
Justice objected to at least 104 voting 
changes in Alabama while preclearance was 
in effect in that state; all but 18 of these ob-
jections were to local- and county-level poli-
cies spread across a wide variety of political 
subdivisions. 
Peyton McCrary’s analysis of the states 
likely to be covered under the VRAA shows 
that it is fair to conclude that discrimina-
tion pervades the local jurisdictions in those 
states as well. According to his testimony, 
every jurisdiction likely to be covered by the 
VRAA has at least one statewide violation, 
violations across at least five local jurisdic-
tions in a broad geographic area, and viola-
tions distributed across the entire 25-year 
period. Take Georgia for example. Professor 
McCrary estimates that Georgia has 25 total 
violations over the 25-year period. These in-
clude four statewide violations and viola-
tions involving 19 different cities, counties, 
and school boards. In other words, the for-
mula captures geographic areas where dis-
crimination is widespread, persistent, and 
continues to the present day, regardless of 
the political subdivisions. 
v. The VRA’s bail-out provisions prevent 
over-inclusion. The bail-out provisions in 
Section 4(a) of the VRA ensure that local ju-
risdictions where discrimination is not prev-
alent will not be unfairly subject to cov-
erage. Political subdivisions that have not 
engaged in discriminatory conduct for ten 
years can petition for relief from the 
preclearance process even if the state as a 
whole and its other subdivisions are still 
covered. 
The VRA’s bail-out process is easy and effi-
cient. Since 1997, 50 jurisdictions across 
seven states have successfully bailed out of 
preclearance, according to the Department 
of Justice. All but one of these jurisdictions 
(the Northwest Austin Municipal Water Dis-
trict No. 1) did so via a consent decree with 
the Department of Justice, without con-
tested litigation. Since the 1982 amendments 
to the VRA, every jurisdiction that re-
quested bailout succeeded. According to elec-
tion law expert Gerry Hebert, who rep-
resented the majority of jurisdictions that 
bailed out between the implementation of 
the 1982 amendments and Shelby County, the 
bailout process became more efficient over 
time as more jurisdictions used it. 
Congress has an opportunity to make the 
bailout process even more efficient by cre-
ating an administrative bailout process that 
largely circumvents judicial review. We rec-
ommend that Congress create an administra-
tive process for jurisdictions to seek bailout 
without having to file an action in court. Po-
litical subdivisions without recent violations 
could file requests directly with the Depart-
ment of Justice. If the Department of Jus-
tice agrees that the jurisdiction qualifies for 
bailout under the VRA’s criteria, the Attor-
ney General could publish a Federal Register 
Notice that the jurisdiction is eligible for ad-
ministrative bailout. If there are no objec-
tions within a specified time period, the ju-
risdiction could be bailed out automatically 
via a second Federal Register Notice, with-
out any judicial action. Jurisdictions that 
are denied or face local opposition to bailout 
would still be able to use the existing bailout 
mechanism by filing an action in the Dis-
trict Court for the District of Columbia. Be-
cause the objective bailout criteria from the 
1982 
amendments 
closely 
mirror 
the 
preclearance criteria in the VRAA, Congress 
could also automatically ‘‘grandfather in’’ 
all jurisdictions that bailed out under the 
1982 amendments pre-Shelby County out of 
coverage, unless they commit the requisite 
number of new violations to subject them to 
future coverage. 
III. The VRAA’s Geographic Coverage Formula 
Is a Constitutional Exercise of Congress’s 
Powers 
The VRAA’s geographic coverage formula, 
updating Section 4(b) of the VRA, is con-
stitutional under Supreme Court precedent. 
As an initial matter, the Supreme Court has 
repeatedly held that the preclearance regime 
in Section 5 of the VRA is constitutional— 
and it remains constitutional today. The 
Court has upheld preclearance under the 
Fourteenth 
and 
Fifteenth 
amendments, 
which give Congress significant leeway to 
craft broad remedial legislation to protect 
against racial discrimination in voting. 
These amendments permit Congress to rem-
edy and to deter voting rights violations by 
prohibiting conduct that is not itself strictly 
unconstitutional. Although the Court has 
recognized that preclearance is an extraor-
dinary legislative approach that stretches 
ordinary principles of federalism, it has also 
affirmed that such ‘‘strong medicine’’ is nec-
essary and constitutionally justified to ad-
dress pervasive and persistent race discrimi-
nation in voting. 
As I discuss above and as the record before 
Congress makes clear, such discrimination 
remains pervasive today, especially in the 
jurisdictions that would likely be covered 
under the VRAA. In expressing doubt about 
the continued need for preclearance roughly 
a decade ago, the Supreme Court observed 
that ‘‘[v]oter turnout and registration rates 
now approach parity,’’ ‘‘[b]latantly discrimi-
natory evasions of federal decrees are rare,’’ 
and ‘‘minority candidates hold office at un-
precedented levels.’’ Simply put, these obser-
vations no longer hold true. Today, the reg-
istration and turnout gaps between white 
voters and voters of color are substantial 
and persistent, especially in jurisdictions 
likely to be covered. Indeed, the gaps be-
tween Hispanic and Non-Hispanic white vot-
ers rivals the registration and turnout gaps 
between Black and white voters from 1965. It 
is not rare to see states pile voting restric-
tion after voting restriction, even as earlier 
restrictions are struck down by the courts in 
what amounts to judicial whack-a-mole. And 
while there are more minority candidates 
than ever before, minorities are still dra-
matically underrepresented relative to their 
population in the halls of congress, state leg-
islatures, and state courts, with some states 
trending toward less, not more, minority 
representation. In short, the justification for 
preclearance remains powerful. 
The VRAA’s primary mode of imposing 
preclearance—its geographic coverage for-
mula—is likewise constitutional. In Shelby 
County, the Supreme Court explained that 
there are constraints on when and how Con-
gress can adopt preclearance. Most signifi-
cantly, the Court said that any attempt to 
target 
states 
for 
preclearance 
coverage 
‘‘must be justified by current needs’’ and the 
formula rationally related to the problem it 
is trying to address. Relying on this prin-
ciple, the Shelby County Court struck down 
the prior geographic coverage formula, find-
ing that it was improper for Congress to rely 
on obsolete practices, such as literacy tests, 
along with outdated information, such as 
1960s- and 1970s-era voter registration rates, 
rather than current conditions and voting 
rights violations. The old coverage formula, 
the Court observed, bore no ‘‘no logical rela-
tion to the present day.’’ And the record of 
voting discrimination before Congress, ac-
cording to the Court, ‘‘played no role in 
shaping’’ the coverage formula. But even as 
the Court struck down the prior coverage 
formula, it invited Congress to craft an up-
dated coverage formula responding to these

concerns. Under the Court’s recent prece-
dents, therefore, a formula that is justified 
by current needs and is sufficiently related 
to the problem it targets should pass con-
stitutional muster. 
The VRAA’s updated coverage formula 
clearly meets that test. It is ‘‘rational in 
both practice and theory,’’ as the Shelby 
County Court explained was required, and its 
remedies are ‘‘aimed at areas where voting 
discrimination has been most flagrant.’’ The 
VRAA’s preclearance regime draws on recent 
history of racial discrimination in voting. 
The updated formula looks to voting dis-
crimination over the past 25 years, and it en-
sures that only states that have violations in 
the past 10 years will be covered. This 25- 
year time period, which covers two redis-
tricting cycles and up to five presidential 
elections, is tailored to identify those juris-
dictions with a persistent record of discrimi-
nation—precisely what the Court requires to 
justify disparate geographic coverage. A 
shorter period of review would not be long 
enough to identify a sustained pattern of 
misconduct and could risk subjecting to 
preclearance states and jurisdictions with 
only sporadic violations. Indeed, as discussed 
above, all the potentially covered jurisdic-
tions have a steady and consistent stream of 
violations, showing that the formula is in 
fact well-tailored. 
Critical features of the coverage formula, 
moreover, ensure that the VRAA captures 
only current violators, not just jurisdictions 
that had problems 25 years ago. Two par-
ticular features of the VRAA make that so. 
First, the VRAA covers jurisdictions for only 
ten years at a time. After ten years of cov-
erage, jurisdictions are automatically freed 
from preclearance, unless their continuing 
violations merit renewed coverage. So, juris-
dictions that improve their recent records of 
discrimination will systematically drop out 
of coverage, while jurisdictions that have in-
creased instances of discrimination will 
enter it. Thus, the VRAA has an implicit 
sunset provision: when a jurisdiction no 
longer engages in a pattern of discrimination 
in voting, it will no longer be subject to cov-
erage. And should the day come when voting 
discrimination no longer plagues our coun-
try, the VRAA will become dead letter, no 
longer subjecting any states or localities to 
preclearance. In addition to the ten-year 
coverage period, the VRAA’s bail-out regime 
ensures that any jurisdiction without viola-
tions over the past decade will be able to 
quickly and efficiently escape preclearance. 
And the proposed modifications to the bail- 
out regime that I discuss above would fur-
ther ensure that the coverage formula is 
laser-focused on present-day discrimination. 
This responsive focus on current conditions 
is exactly what the Court asked for in 
Shelby County. 
The VRAA modernizes the coverage for-
mula and, as the Shelby Court requested, 
uses a ‘‘narrowed scope’’ to reflect both cur-
rent problems and progress made to date. 
While the states that are likely to be covered 
under the VRAA’s updated formula were all 
previously covered, some states that were 
previously covered—Alaska, for example— 
will likely not be covered. And it is not sur-
prising that the list of states with a past his-
tory of discrimination overlaps substantially 
with the list of states with current problems 
of persistent discrimination. On the other 
hand, the local jurisdictions that will be cap-
tured by this formula are largely jurisdic-
tions that were not previously covered. They 
are all jurisdictions with large and growing 
minority populations. This shows that Con-
gress has indeed updated the law to be dy-
namic and responsive to modern conditions. 
Clearly, the record before this Congress is 
playing a substantial ‘‘role in shaping the 
statutory formula’’ that will be included in 
the VRAA. 
The VRAA also tracks discrimination 
more directly than the coverage formula 
struck down in Shelby County. The VRAA’s 
coverage formula ‘‘limit[s] its attention to 
the geographic areas where immediate ac-
tion seem[s] necessary’’—specifically, areas 
where there is actual ‘‘evidence of actual 
voting discrimination,’’ that are ‘‘character-
ized by voting discrimination ‘on a pervasive 
scale.’ ’’ To that end, the VRAA’s touchstone 
is not registration and turnout numbers—it 
is actual, proven acts of discrimination. 
Such acts are self-evidently ‘‘relevant to vot-
ing discrimination.’’ By linking coverage to 
objective findings of discrimination, the 
VRAA targets only those places where prov-
en discrimination against voters of color 
persists. In this regard, the VRAA’s coverage 
formula is similar to the uncontroversial 
bail-in provision found in Section 4 of the 
VRA: covering those states and localities 
where there are, in the words of the 1965 
House Report, ‘‘pockets of discrimination.’’ 
Concerns regarding the coverage formula’s 
potential overbreadth are misplaced. As 
noted above, the coverage formula effec-
tively targets geographic areas where dis-
crimination is prevalent, and the bail-out re-
gime would enable any political subdivision 
without 
discrimination 
to 
escape 
preclearance. The prior geographic coverage 
formula that the Supreme Court repeatedly 
upheld subjected all political subdivisions to 
preclearance based on a statewide inquiry. In 
any event, the Supreme Court has made 
clear time and again that the benefits of 
state sovereignty do not extend to its polit-
ical subdivisions. This is because ‘‘the law 
ordinarily treats municipalities as creatures 
of the State.’’ On this basis, one district 
court held it reasonable to bring all subdivi-
sions and a state itself into preclearance 
based on a pattern of violations by some of 
its subdivisions. In reviewing a request to 
bail the state of Arkansas and all its subdivi-
sions into coverage for certain electoral 
processes, that court found that because 
‘‘[c]ities, counties, and other local subdivi-
sions are mere creatures of the State’’ that 
the State may ‘‘create or abolish . . . at 
will,’’ ‘‘no legal distinction exists between 
State and local officials’’ for the purpose of 
preclearance. The court also found that be-
cause the use of the relevant voting practice 
was clearly a ‘‘pattern’’ and a ‘‘systematic 
and deliberate attempt to reduce black polit-
ical opportunity,’’ it was reasonable to hold 
all other jurisdictions in the state to the 
preclearance 
requirement. 
The 
Supreme 
Court has never questioned this approach to 
sub-state preclearance. 
Although not the focus of my testimony, 
there are two other points relevant to the 
VRAA’s constitutionality. First, in addition 
to the geographic coverage formula, the 
VRAA 
also 
features 
a 
practice-based 
preclearance regime with nationwide appli-
cation. This practice-based preclearance re-
gime singles out often discriminatory prac-
tices—such as changes in methods of elec-
tion, annexations, polling place relocations, 
and interference with language assistance— 
for federal oversight. Because it has no spe-
cific geographic scope and does not impose 
continuing coverage, it does not implicate, 
much less offend, the principle of equal sov-
ereignty articulated in the Shelby County 
opinion. 
Second, separate and apart from the Four-
teenth and Fifteenth Amendments, Congress 
has extremely strong powers under the Elec-
tions Clause to set the ‘‘times, places and 
manner’’ of federal elections—powers the Su-
preme Court has said include ‘‘authority to 
provide a complete code for congressional 
elections.’’ Congress has invoked those pow-
ers to enact voting legislation like the Na-
tional Voter Registration Act, which the Su-
preme Court has determined permissibly 
overlays a ‘‘superstructure of federal regula-
tion atop state voter-registration systems.’’ 
And just a few years ago, the Supreme Court 
approvingly discussed how Congress has used 
the Elections Clause to ‘‘enact[] a series of 
laws to protect the right to vote through 
measures such as the suspension of literacy 
tests and the prohibition of English-only 
elections.’’ The Elections Clause, therefore, 
independently justifies the VRAA to the ex-
tent that it regulates federal elections. The 
Supreme Court’s concerns in Shelby Coun-
ty—which were based on Court’s interpreta-
tion of the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amend-
ments—have no bearing on the constitu-
tionality of the VRAA as it pertains to fed-

IV. Congress Should Restore and Strengthen 
Section 2 of the VRA in the Wake of the Su-
preme Court’s Recent Brnovich Decision 
As my colleague Sean Morales-Doyle re-
cently testified at length, we also strongly 
urge Congress to use this opportunity to re-
store Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act in 
the wake of the Supreme Court’s recent deci-
sion in Brnovich v. Democratic National 
Committee. Section 2 is critical for fighting 
voting discrimination in jurisdictions not 
subject to preclearance (and for fighting cer-
tain forms of voting discrimination in cov-
ered jurisdictions as well). The Brnovich de-
cision 
seriously 
diminished 
Section 
2’s 
strength, making it much less effective a 
tool for rooting out modern discriminatory 
voting laws and practices. In doing so, it un-
dermined Congress’s clear intent in 1982 to 
create a powerful remedy to attack electoral 
laws and practices that interact with the on-
going effects of discrimination to produce 
discriminatory results in the voting process. 
There are a number of approaches to re-
storing Section 2 to its full strength, but 
they all share two basic features. First, they 
would codify the so-called ‘‘Senate Factors’’ 
that courts have long used to assess whether 
a voting law or practice results in unlawful 
discrimination under Section 2, and make 
clear that courts should consider those fac-
tors in both vote dilution (redistricting) and 
vote denial (vote suppression) cases. Second, 
they would disclaim the artificial limita-
tions the Brnovich opinion placed on courts 
considering Section 2 claims—such as the 
suggestion that voting practices that were in 
place in 1982 should be treated as presump-
tively valid under Section 2, and the sugges-
tion that unequal access to one method of 
voting can be excused if other methods of 
voting are freely available. These two fixes 
would ensure that Section 2 comports with 
both Congress’s original intent in amending 
Section 2 in 1982 and with prior practice in 
federal courts. The Supreme Court was clear 
in Brnovich that its ruling was based in stat-
utory interpretation. Congress can therefore 
easily correct the Court’s misinterpretation 
and restore Section 2 to its intended 
strength. 
While the Brnovich decision applies only 
to ‘‘vote denial’’ claims, it is important that 
any statutory fix address ‘‘vote dilution’’ or 
redistricting claims as well. Section 2 has 
long been a vital tool for ensuring fair elec-
toral maps. According to a recent Brennan 
Center analysis, Section 2 has played a crit-
ical role in addressing discrimination in re-
districting, as evidenced by the more than 20 
successful redistricting cases since the 2006 
reauthorization of the VRA. 
The VRAA would work in tandem with an-
other piece of legislation, the For the People 
Act (H.R. 1). H.R. 1 sets national standards 
for fair, secure, and accessible elections; the 
VRAA targets jurisdictions and practices

with a history of discrimination. H.R. 1 
would override existing discriminatory state 
laws and practices and replace them with a 
fair alternative; the VRAA would establish 
preclearance for future such laws and prac-
tices. Both are vitally needed to strengthen 
our democracy. 
V. Conclusion 
As the record before this Committee 
shows, the scourge of voting discrimination 
has exploded across the country, and it is es-
pecially acute and pervasive in selected ju-
risdictions. The John Lewis Voting Rights 
Advancement Act is carefully crafted to tar-
get and root out that discrimination where 
it 
is 
most 
persistent. 
The 
VRAA’s 
preclearance provisions are not only emi-
nently reasonable, justified, and consistent 
with the Constitution; they are also nec-
essary to stem the relentless rise of discrimi-
natory voting changes. Those preclearance 
provisions, coupled with new provisions to 
strengthen Section 2 of the VRA, would re-
store the VRA to its full strength before the 
Supreme Court dramatically weakened the 
law in Shelby County and Brnovich. That 
strength is badly needed now. We strongly 
urge Congress to enact the VRAA, as well as 
the For the People Act, into law. 
STATEMENT OF JON GREENBAUM, CHIEF COUN-
SEL, 
LAWYERS’ 
COMMITTEE
FOR
CIVIL 
RIGHTS UNDER LAW 
U.S. HOUSE COMMITTEE ON THE JUDICIARY 
SUBCOMMITTEE ON THE CONSTITUTION, CIVIL 
RIGHTS AND CIVIL LIBERTIES 
Hearing on ‘‘Oversight of the Voting Rights 
Act: Potential Legislative Reforms’’—Au-
gust 16, 2021 
INTRODUCTION 
Chairman Cohen, Ranking Member John-
son, and Members of the Subcommittee on 
the Constitution, Civil Rights and Civil Lib-
erties of the U.S. House of Representatives 
Committee on the Judiciary, my name is Jon 
Greenbaum and I serve as the Chief Counsel 
for the Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights 
Under Law (‘‘Lawyers’ Committee’’). Thank 
you for the opportunity to testify today on 
ways in which Congress can remedy the dam-
age to racial equality in voting caused by 
the Supreme Court’s decisions in Shelby 
County v. Holder, and Brnovich v. Demo-
cratic National Committee. 
In 2013, the Shelby County decision effec-
tively immobilized the preclearance provi-
sions of Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act 
by finding its underlying coverage formula 
unconstitutional. The more recent Brnovich 
decision, while not gutting Section 2, makes 
it unnecessarily more difficult for plaintiffs 
to bring Section 2 vote denial ‘‘results’’ 
cases, running directly counter to Congress’ 
intent in first enacting the Voting Rights 
Act in 1965, and then in broadening the scope 
of Section 2 of the Act in 1982. The weak-
ening of Section 2 protections by the Court 
in Brnovich is particularly and sadly ironic, 
as the Court in Shelby County had pointed to 
the continued existence of Section 2’s ‘‘per-
manent, nation-wide ban on racial discrimi-
nation’’ when it eviscerated the Section 5 
protections. 
The harm caused by Shelby County has 
been 
well-documented. 
The 
effects 
of 
Brnovich remain to be seen. However, it is 
not too late for Congress to act. The full pro-
tections of the Voting Rights Act are des-
perately needed today, particularly given the 
steps already taken—or about to be taken— 
by legislatures in states such as Georgia, 
Florida, and Texas in the aftermath of the 
2020 election to raise additional barriers to 
the vote that will impact voters of color 
more severely than white voters. Moreover, 
there is a legitimate concern that some state 
legislatures will be emboldened by their 
reading of Brnovich, as they were by the de-
cision in Shelby, and view it as a signal from 
the Court to take even more suppressive ac-
tion. Congress should immediately reassert 
its intention to fully protect the voting 
rights of voters of color in Sections 2 and 5 
of the Voting Rights Act. 
I come to this conclusion based on twenty- 
four years of working on voting rights issues 
nationally. From 1997 to 2003, I served as a 
Senior Trial Attorney in the Voting Section 
at the United States Department of Justice, 
where I enforced various provisions of the 
Voting Rights Act, including Section 5, on 
behalf of the United States. In the eighteen 
years since, I have continued to work on vot-
ing rights issues at the Lawyers’ Committee 
for Civil Rights Under Law as Chief Counsel, 
where I oversee our Voting Rights Project, 
and prior to that, when I served as Director 
of the Voting Rights Project. 
The Lawyers’ Committee is a national civil 
rights organization created at the request of 
President John F. Kennedy in 1963 to pursue 
racial justice through mobilization of the 
private bar. Voting rights has been an orga-
nizational core area since the inception of 
the organization. During my time at the 
Lawyers’ Committee, among other things, I 
was intimately involved in the constitu-
tional defense of Section 5 and its coverage 
formula in Shelby County and its prede-
cessor case Northwest Austin Municipal 
Utility District No. 1 v. Holder. I also staffed 
the National Commission on the Voting 
Rights Act, which issued a report entitled 
The National Commission on the Voting 
Rights Act, Protecting Minority Voters: The 
Voting Rights Act at Work 1982–2005 (2006). 
The report and record of the National Com-
mission on the Voting Rights Act, which was 
submitted to the House Judiciary Committee 
at the Committee’s request, was the largest 
single piece of the record supporting the 
Fannie Lou Hamer, Rosa Parks, and Coretta 
Scott King Voting Rights Act Reauthoriza-
tion and Amendments Act of 2006 (‘‘2006 VRA 
Reauthorization’’). 
Our recommended responses to the Shelby 
County and Brnovich decisions stem from 
the different scope and rationales of the de-
cisions themselves. The complete eviscera-
tion of Section 5 wrought by the Shelby 
County decision necessitates a comprehen-
sive remedy, but one that is instructed by 
the reasoning of that decision and therefore 
considers both the unfortunate history of 
discrimination in voting in particular states 
and the current need for prophylactic meas-
ures to ensure that no state or sub-jurisdic-
tion can implement a change in voting prac-
tices that discriminates against voters of 
color. The more limited impact of the 
Brnovich decision calls for a correspondingly 
focused response, one that zeroes in on the 
specific deviations of the Court from the 
clear intent of Congress in its 1982 amend-
ments to Section 2. 
Thus, our recommended response to the 
Shelby County decision starts with our sup-
port for provisions similar to those in the 
bill passed by the U.S. House of Representa-
tives in the previous session of Congress: 
H.R. 4, 116th Congress, the John Lewis Vot-
ing Rights Advancement Act, i.e., a replace-
ment coverage formula that would be applied 
to the preclearance provisions of Section 5 
and the federal observer provisions of Sec-
tion 8, and a transparency provision that re-
quires all jurisdictions—irrespective of any 
coverage formula—to provide public notice 
of changes in voting practices. But, we have 
an additional recommendation, tied to the 
transparency provision: the creation of a 
‘‘retrogression cause of action,’’ that allows 
the Attorney General or private parties an 
opportunity to stop changes in voting prac-
tices anywhere in the country before they di-
minish the voting rights of voters of color. 
As I will discuss more fully in my testimony, 
the retrogression cause of action would meet 
the current need to stop suppressive laws 
that discriminate against voters of color, 
using a tried and true standard, with limited 
interference with state sovereignty, and 
without implicating issues relating to dif-
ferentiation among the states. 
Our recommended congressional response 
to Brnovich is more limited, as Congress 
does not have to completely rewrite Section 
2. It simply has to remove any ambiguity in 
the statute caused by the Brnovich opinion, 
which gave short shrift to a substantial leg-
islative record and decades of jurisprudence 
which run counter to the Brnovich major-
ity’s constricted view of this remedial stat-
ute. Congress originally enacted and later 
amended Section 2 to stymie not only bla-
tant, 
explicit 
discrimination, 
but 
also 
facially neutral voting laws that, through in-
genious, sophisticated methods, had a sig-
nificant impact on minority citizens’ right 
to vote. Consistent with this purpose, prior 
to Brnovich, the Supreme Court and several 
of the Circuit Courts of Appeal had adopted 
a standard to ensure the effective implemen-
tation of those protections. That standard 
recognized not only that the Act applies 
broadly to all voting procedures and policies 
that abridge the right to vote—whether ex-
pressly or subtly—but also that a challenged 
law cannot be viewed in isolation, because a 
seemingly innocuous voting practice can 
interact with underlying social conditions to 
result in pernicious discrimination. 
Under that standard, Section 2 has worked 
for decades as a judicially manageable mech-
anism to stop voting discrimination. There 
has been no flood of questionable Section 2 
vote denial ‘‘results’’ cases, and no wide-
spread invalidation of voting regulations. In-
deed, Brnovich marked the first time since 
the 1982 amendments to the Act that the Su-
preme Court reviewed a pure vote-denial 
claim. The reason is clear: The lower courts 
have taken seriously the Court’s guidance, 
and carefully assessed the effects of chal-
lenged voting policies or procedures within 
each specific jurisdiction, based on the total-
ity of the circumstances. 
Brnovich compels an immediate response 
from this Congress, before some state legis-
lators—intent on creating obstacles that dis-
proportionately result in a negative impact 
on the rights of voters of color—hear it as a 
dog whistle to do just that, and before lower 
courts apply the opinion in ways that ele-
vate unsubstantiated and untrue justifica-
tions for new burdensome voting practices 
over genuine and proved claims of racially 
discriminatory results. 
I. Why and How Congress Must Respond to 
Shelby County 
A. The State of Affairs Prior to the Shelby 
County decision 
Prior to the Shelby County decision, the 
combination of Section 2 and Section 5 of the 
Voting Rights Act provided an effective 
means of preventing and remedying minority 
voting discrimination. Section 2, which is 
discussed more fully below, remains as the 
general provision enabling the Department 
of Justice and private plaintiffs to challenge 
voting practices or procedures that have a 
discriminatory purpose or result. Section 2 is 
in effect nationwide. Section 5 required ju-
risdictions with a history of discrimination, 
based on a formula set forth in Section 4(b), 
to obtain preclearance of any voting changes 
from the Department of Justice or the Dis-
trict Court in the District of Columbia be-
fore implementing the voting change. From 
its inception, there was a sunset provision 
for the formula, and the sunset provision for 
the 2006 Reauthorization was 25 years.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4446 
August 24, 2021 
Section 5 covered jurisdictions had to show 
federal authorities that the voting change 
did not have a discriminatory purpose or ef-
fect. Discriminatory purpose under Section 5 
was the same as the Fourteenth and Fif-
teenth Amendment prohibitions against in-
tentional discrimination against minority 
voters. Effect was defined as a change which 
would have the effect of diminishing the 
ability of minority voters to vote or to elect 
their preferred candidates of choice. This 
was also known as retrogression, and in most 
instances was easy to measure and admin-
ister. For example, if a proposed redis-
tricting plan maintained a majority black 
district that elected a black preferred can-
didate at the same black population percent-
age as the plan in effect, it would be highly 
unlikely to be found retrogressive. If, how-
ever, the proposed plan significantly dimin-
ished the black population percentage in the 
same district, it would invite serious ques-
tions that it was retrogressive. 
Except in rare circumstances, covered ju-
risdictions would first submit their voting 
changes to the Department of Justice. DOJ 
had sixty days to make a determination on a 
change, and if DOJ precleared the change or 
did not act in 60 days, the covered jurisdic-
tion could implement the change. The sub-
mission of additional information by the ju-
risdiction, which often happened because 
DOJ requested such information orally, 
would extend the 60 day period once by send-
ing a written request for information to the 
jurisdiction. This often signaled to the juris-
diction that DOJ had serious concerns that 
the change violated Section 5. If DOJ ob-
jected to a change, it was blocked, but juris-
dictions had various options, including re-
questing reconsideration from DOJ using 
Section 5 Procedures, seeking preclearance 
from the federal court and modifying the 
change and resubmitting it. 
In the nearly seven years I worked at DOJ, 
I witnessed first-hand how effective Section 
5 was at preventing voting discrimination 
and how efficiently DOJ administered the 
process to minimize the burdens to its own 
staff of attorneys and analysts, and to the 
covered jurisdictions. The Section 5 Proce-
dures cited above provided transparency as 
to DOJ’s procedures and gave covered juris-
dictions guidance on how to proceed through 
the Section 5 process. Internal procedures 
enabled 
DOJ 
staff 
to 
preclear 
unobjectionable voting changes with mini-
mal effort and to devote the bulk of their 
time to those changes that required close 
scrutiny. 
The benefits of Section 5 were numerous 
and tangible. The 2014 National Commission 
Report provided the following statistics and 
information regarding DOJ objections: 
‘‘By any measure, Section 5 was respon-
sible for preventing a very large amount of 
voting discrimination. From 1965 to 2013, 
DOJ issued approximately 1,000 determina-
tion letters denying preclearance for over 
3,000 voting changes. This included objec-
tions to over 500 redistricting plans and 
nearly 800 election method changes (such as 
the adoption of at-large election systems and 
the addition of majority-vote and numbered- 
post requirements to existing at-large sys-
tems). Much of this activity occurred be-
tween 1982 (when Congress enacted the pe-
nultimate reauthorization of Section 5) and 
2006 (when the last reauthorization oc-
curred); in that time period approximately 
700 separate objections were interposed in-
volving over 2,000 voting changes, including 
objections to approximately 400 redistricting 
plans and another 400 election method 
changes.’’ 
‘‘Each objection, by itself, typically bene-
fited thousands of minority voters, and 
many objections affected tens of thousands, 
hundreds of thousands, or even (for objec-
tions to statewide changes) millions of mi-
nority voters. It would have required an im-
mense investment of public and private re-
sources to have accomplished this through 
the filing of individual lawsuits.’’ 
In addition to the changes that were for-
mally blocked, Section 5’s effect on deter-
ring discrimination cannot be understated. 
Covered jurisdictions knew that their voting 
changes would be reviewed by an inde-
pendent body and they had the burden of 
demonstrating that they were non-discrimi-
natory. By the time I began working at DOJ, 
Section 5 had been in effect for several dec-
ades and most jurisdictions knew better than 
to enact changes which would raise obvious 
concerns that they were discriminatory— 
like moving a polling place in a majority 
black precinct to a sheriff’s office. In the 
post-Shelby County world, a jurisdiction is 
likely to get away with implementing a dis-
criminatory change for one election (or 
more) before a plaintiff receives relief from a 
court, as the Hancock County, Georgia voter 
purge and Texas voter identification cases 
detailed later illustrate. 
The Section 5 process also brought notice 
and transparency to voting changes. Most 
voting changes are made without public 
awareness. DOJ would produce a weekly list 
of voting changes that had been submitted, 
which individuals and groups could subscribe 
to in order to receive this weekly list from 
DOJ. For submissions of particular interest, 
DOJ would provide public notice of the 
change if it believed the jurisdiction had not 
provided adequate notice of the change. But 
even more important, the Section 5 process 
incentivized jurisdictions to involve the mi-
nority community in voting changes. DOJ’s 
Section 5 Procedures requested that jurisdic-
tions with a significant minority population 
provide the names of minority community 
members who could speak to the change, and 
DOJ’s routine practice was to call at least 
one local minority contact and to ask the in-
dividual whether she or he was aware of the 
voting change and had an opinion on it. 
Moreover, involved members of the commu-
nity could affirmatively contact DOJ and 
provide relevant information and data. 
B. The Shelby County Decision 
In the Shelby County case, the Supreme 
Court decided in a 5–4 vote that the Section 
4(b) coverage formula was unconstitutional. 
The majority held that because the Voting 
Rights Act ‘‘ ‘impose[d] current burdens,’ ’’ it 
‘‘ ‘must be justified by current needs.’ ’’ The 
majority went on to rule that because the 
formula was comprised of data from the 1960s 
and 1970s, it could not be rationally related 
to determining what jurisdictions, if any, 
should be covered under Section 5 decades 
later. The four dissenting justices found that 
Congress had demonstrated that regardless 
of what data was used to determine the for-
mula, voting discrimination had persisted in 
the covered jurisdictions. The majority made 
clear that ‘‘[w]e issue no holding on § 5 itself, 
only on the coverage formula. Congress may 
draft another formula based on current con-
ditions.’’ 
The effect of the Shelby County decision is 
that Section 5 is effectively immobilized as, 
for now, preclearance is limited only to 
those jurisdictions where it is imposed by a 
court after a court previously made a finding 
of intentional voting discrimination. This 
special preclearance coverage is authorized 
by Section 3(c) of the Act. Courts have rarely 
ordered Section 3(c) coverage, and when they 
do, it is typically quite limited. Indeed, the 
only jurisdictions I am aware of that have 
been subject to Section 3(c) coverage since 
the Shelby County decision are Pasadena, 
Texas and Evergreen, Alabama. 
As a result, Section 5 is essentially dead 
until Congress takes up the Supreme Court’s 
invitation to craft another coverage formula. 
There are compelling reasons for Congress to 
do so because voting discrimination has in-
creased in the absence of Section 5, and Sec-
tion 2 cannot adequately substitute for Sec-
tion 5. 
C. The Effect of the Shelby County Decision 
The year after the Shelby County decision 
was issued, the Executive Summary and 
Chapter 3 of the 2014 National Commission 
Report discussed what was lost in the Shelby 
County decision. We identified the following 
impacts: 
Voting rights discrimination would pro-
liferate, particularly in the areas formerly 
covered by Section 5; 
Section 2 would not serve as an adequate 
substitute for Section 5 for numerous rea-
sons: 
The statutes are not identical but were in-
stead intended to complement one another; 
Section 5 prevents a discriminatory voting 
change from ever going into effect whereas 
discrimination can affect voters in a Section 
2 case prior to a court decision or a settle-
ment; 
Section 2 litigation is time-consuming and 
expensive compared to Section 5 which is ef-
ficient and less-resource intensive; 
Section 2 is less likely to prevent discrimi-
nation than Section 5 because: 
Under Section 2 plaintiffs have the burden 
whereas under Section 5, jurisdictions have 
the burden of proof; 
Section 2 has a complicated multi-factor 
test that provides numerous defenses for ju-
risdictions, whereas Section 5 has a simple 
retrogression test. 
The Shelby County decision, and DOJ’s in-
terpretation that it also bars use of the cov-
erage formula for sending federal observers, 
has left voting processes vulnerable to dis-
crimination. 
The subsequent years have demonstrated 
that all of the negative impacts we antici-
pated have come to pass. 
D. Voting Rights Discrimination has Pro-
liferated Since Shelby County, Particu-
larly in the Areas Formerly Covered by 
Section 5 
The Lawyers’ Committee’s Voting Rights 
Project has never been busier than in the 
post-Shelby County years, where we have 
participated as a counsel to a party or as 
amici in more than 100 voting rights cases. 
Because the Lawyers’ Committee has a spe-
cific racial justice mission, all of the cases 
we have participated in implicate race in 
some fashion in our view, even if there are 
no race claims in the case. 
In my 2019 testimony before this Sub-
committee, I did a deeper dive into the 41 
post-Shelby County voting rights cases the 
Lawyers’ Committee had filed up to that 
time. My testimony reflected that voting 
discrimination remains alive and well, par-
ticularly in the states formerly covered by 
Section 5. The findings included the fol-
lowing: 
In the thirty-seven cases where we sued 
state or local governments, twenty-nine (78.3 
percent) involved jurisdictions that were 
covered by Section 5, even though far less 
than half the country was covered by Sec-
tion 5. Moreover, we sued seven of the nine 
states that were covered by Section 5 (Ala-
bama, Arizona, Georgia, Louisiana, Mis-
sissippi, Texas, Virginia), as well as the two 
states that had were not covered but had a 
substantial percentage of the population cov-
ered locally (North Carolina and New York). 
We achieved substantial success. Of the 
thirty-three cases where there had been 
some result at the time, we achieved a posi-
tive result in 26 of 33 (78.8 percent). In most

of the seven cases where we were not suc-
cessful, we had filed emergent litigation—ei-
ther on Election Day or shortly before— 
where achieving success is most difficult. 
This data tells us that voting discrimina-
tion remains substantial, especially consid-
ering that the Lawyers’ Committee is but 
one organization, and particularly in the 
areas previously covered by Section 5. 
In 2019, the Lawyers’ Committee did a 25 
year look back on the number of times that 
an official entity made a finding of voter dis-
crimination. This analysis of administrative 
actions and court proceedings identified 340 
instances between 1994 and 2019 where the 
U.S. Attorney General or a court made a 
finding of voting discrimination or where a 
jurisdiction changed its laws or practices 
based on litigation alleging voting discrimi-
nation. We found that the successful court 
cases occurred in disproportionally greater 
numbers in jurisdictions that were pre-
viously covered under Section 5. 
E. Why Section 2 is an inadequate substitute 
for Section 5 
Prior to the Shelby County decision, crit-
ics of Section 5 frequently minimized the 
negative impact its absence would have by 
pointing out that DOJ and private parties 
could 
still 
stop 
discriminatory 
voting 
changes by bringing affirmative cases under 
Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act. Indeed, 
in the same paragraph of Shelby County 
where the Supreme Court majority states 
that Congress could adopt a new formula for 
Section 5, it also notes that its ‘‘decision in 
no way affects the permanent, nation-wide 
ban on racial discrimination in voting found 
in § 2.’’ 
During the Shelby County litigation and 
the reauthorization process preceding it, de-
fenders of Section 5 repeatedly pointed out 
why Section 2 was an inadequate substitute. 
Eight years of experience demonstrate this. 
This is hardly a surprise given that Sec-
tion 5 and Section 2 were designed by Con-
gress to complement one another as part of 
a comprehensive set of tools to combat vot-
ing discrimination. Section 5 was designed to 
prevent a specific problem—to prevent juris-
dictions with a history of discrimination 
from enacting new measures that would un-
dermine the gains minority voters were able 
to secure through other voting protections, 
including 
Section 
2. 
The 
Section 
5 
preclearance process was potent, but also ef-
ficient and surgical in its limited geographic 
focus and sunset provisions. It was also rel-
atively easy to evaluate because the retro-
gressive effect standard—whether minority 
voters are made worse off by the proposed 
change—is simple to determine in all but the 
closest cases. Section 5 is designed to protect 
against discriminatory changes to the status 
quo. 
Section 2 is quite different. It evaluates 
whether the status quo is discriminatory and 
thus must be changed. The test for liability 
should be, and is, rigorous because it is a 
court-ordered change. Although Section 2 
(results) and Section 5 (retrogression) both 
have discriminatory impact tests, they are 
distinct. As discussed above, the Section 5 
retrogression test is quite straightforward in 
determining whether a jurisdictional-gen-
erated change should be blocked—will mi-
nority voters be worse off because of the 
change? 
In contrast, the Section 2 results inquiry is 
complex and resource intensive to litigate. 
As will be discussed in greater detail below 
in the context of the Brnovich decision, the 
‘‘totality of circumstances’’ test set forth in 
the statute is fact-intensive by its own defi-
nition. The Senate Report supporting the 
1982 amendment to Section 2 lists factors 
that courts have used as a starting point in 
applying the totality of circumstances test 
to include seven such factors (along with two 
factors plaintiffs have the option to raise). 
On top of the Senate factors, courts have in-
troduced additional requirements. For exam-
ple, in vote dilution cases, which typically 
involve challenges to redistricting plans or 
to a method of election, the plaintiff must 
first satisfy the three preconditions set forth 
by the Supreme Court in Thornburg v. 
Gingles, before even getting to the Senate 
factors. These Gingles preconditions require 
plaintiffs to show that a minority group is 
compact and numerous enough to constitute 
a majority of eligible voters in an illus-
trative redistricting plan and whether there 
is racially polarized voting (minority voters 
are cohered in large number to support cer-
tain candidates and those candidates are 
usually defeated because of white bloc vot-
ing) and are necessarily proven by expert 
testimony. In vote denial cases, which in-
volve challenges to practices such as voter 
identification laws, courts have also added 
an additional test, with the developing ma-
jority view requiring that plaintiffs dem-
onstrate that the challenged law imposes a 
discriminatory burden on members of a pro-
tected class and that this ‘‘burden must be in 
part caused by or linked to social conditions 
that have or currently produce discrimina-
tion against members of the protected class. 
The result is that Section 2 cases are ex-
tremely time-consuming and resource-inten-
sive, particularly when defendants mount a 
vigorous defense. For example, United States 
v. Charleston County, which I litigated at 
the Department of Justice, was a successful 
challenge to the at-large method of electing 
the Charleston (South Carolina) County 
Council. The litigation took four years, and 
it involved more than seventy witness depo-
sitions and a four-week trial, even though we 
had prevailed on the Gingles preconditions 
on summary judgment, and needed to liti-
gate only the totality of circumstances in 
the district court. 
Four specific examples from the Lawyers’ 
Committee’s litigation record illustrate why 
Section 2 is an inadequate substitute for Sec-
tion 5. The first and most prominent exam-
ple is the Texas voter identification law, 
which illustrates the time and expense of 
litigating a voting change under Section 2 
that both DOJ and the federal district court 
found violated Section 5 prior to the Shelby 
County decision. The afternoon that Shelby 
County was decided, then-Texas Attorney 
General Greg Abbott announced that the 
State would immediately implement the ID 
law. Several civil rights groups, including 
the Lawyers’ Committee, filed suit in Texas 
federal court, challenging SB 14 under sev-
eral theories, including Section 2, and DOJ 
filed its own suit under Section 2, and ulti-
mately all of the cases were consolidated. 
The parties then embarked on months of dis-
covery, leading to a two-week trial in Sep-
tember 2014, where dozens of witnesses, in-
cluding 16 experts—half of whom were paid 
for by the civil rights groups—testified. 
Prior to the November 2014 election, the Dis-
trict Court ruled that SB 14 violated the ‘‘re-
sults’’ prong of Section 2 of the Voting 
Rights Act, because it had a discriminatory 
result in that Black and Hispanic voters 
were two to three times less likely to possess 
the SB 14 IDs and that it would be two to 
three times more burdensome for them to 
get the IDs than for white voters. The Dis-
trict Court’s injunction against SB 14, how-
ever, was stayed pending appeal by the Fifth 
Circuit, so the law—now deemed to be dis-
criminatory—remained 
in 
effect. 
Subse-
quently, a three-judge panel and later an en 
banc panel of the Fifth Circuit Court of Ap-
peals, affirmed the District Court’s finding. 
As a result, elections that took place from 
June 25, 2013 until the Fifth Circuit en banc 
opinion on July 20, 2016 took place under the 
discriminatory voter ID law. Had Section 5 
been enforceable, enormous expense and ef-
fort would have been spared. The district 
court awarded private plaintiffs $5,851,388.28 
in attorneys’ fees and $938,945.03 in expenses, 
for a total of $6,790,333.31. The fee award is 
currently on appeal. As of June 2016, Texas 
had spent $3.5 million in defending the case. 
Even with no published information from 
DOJ, more than $10 million in time and ex-
penses were expended in that one case. 
Second, in Gallardo v. State, the Arizona 
legislature passed a law that applied only to 
the Maricopa County Community College 
District and added two at-large members to 
what was previously a five-member single 
district board. The legislature had submitted 
the change for Section 5 preclearance. The 
Department of Justice issued a more infor-
mation letter based on concerns that the ad-
dition of two at-large members, in light of 
racially polarized voting in Maricopa Coun-
ty, would weaken the electoral power of mi-
nority voters on the board. After receiving 
the more information letter, Arizona offi-
cials did not seek to implement the change. 
Only after the Shelby County decision did 
they move forward, precipitating the lawsuit 
brought by the Lawyers’ Committee and its 
partners. We could not challenge the change 
under Section 2, especially because we would 
not have been able to meet the first Gingles 
precondition. Instead we made a claim in 
state court alleging that the new law vio-
lated Arizona’s constitutional prohibition 
against special laws because the board com-
position of less populous counties was not 
changed. Reversing the intermediate court of 
appeal, the Arizona Supreme Court rejected 
our argument, holding that the special laws 
provision of the state constitution was not 
violated. Unsurprisingly, the Latino can-
didate who ran for the at-large seat in the 
first election lost and the two at-large mem-
bers are white. 
Third, in 2015, the Board of Elections and 
Registration, in Hancock County, Georgia, 
changed its process so as to initiate a series 
of ‘‘challenge proceedings’’ to voters, all but 
two of whom were African American. This 
resulted in the removal of 53 voters from the 
register. Later that year, the Lawyers’ Com-
mittee, representing the Georgia State Con-
ference of the NAACP and the Georgia Coali-
tion for the Peoples’ Agenda and individual 
voters, challenged this conduct as violating 
the Voting Rights Act and the National 
Voter Registration Act, and obtained relief 
which resulted in the placement of unlaw-
fully-removed voters back on the register. 
Ultimately, 
plaintiffs 
and 
the 
Hancock 
County Board agreed to the terms of a Con-
sent Decree that would remedy the viola-
tions, and required the county’s policies to 
be monitored for five years. But after the 
purge and prior to the court order, Sparta, a 
predominantly black city in Hancock Coun-
ty, elected its first white mayor in four dec-
ades. And before the case was settled, and 
the wrongly-purged voters placed back on 
the rolls, at least one of them had died. 
The fourth matter is ongoing and reflects 
the significant present-day impact of the 
Shelby County decision and the loss of Sec-
tion 5. It involves a law that Georgia, a pre-
viously covered jurisdiction, enacted this 
year, SB 202, a 53 section, 98-page law that 
changes many aspects of Georgia elections. 
It has spawned several federal lawsuits, most 
of 
which 
include 
voting 
discrimination 
claims. The Lawyers’ Committee is counsel 
in the one of these suits. 
The litigation will unquestionably be re-
source intensive even if the various cases are 
fully or partially consolidated and the Plain-
tiffs engage in substantial coordination. It

will require numerous experts and extensive 
fact discovery. There will be elections—and 
possibly multiple cycles of elections—that 
will occur before Plaintiffs will have the evi-
dence needed to establish a constitutional or 
Section 2 violation and the court will set 
aside the time to hear and decide the claims. 
If Plaintiffs prevail, Georgia will undoubt-
edly appeal and even more time will pass. 
But for the Shelby County decision, there 
would be no SB 202, at least not in its cur-
rent form, because at least some aspects of 
SB 202 appear to be clearly retrogressive and 
probably would not have been proposed in 
the first place. This is perhaps most clearly 
demonstrated by Georgia introducing several 
restrictions focused on voting by mail: 
The new absentee ballot ID requirements 
mandate that voters include a Georgia Driv-
er’s license number or Georgia State ID 
number on their absentee ballot application. 
If they have neither, voters are required to 
copy another form of acceptable voter ID and 
attach the copies of ID documents along 
with other identifying information to both 
their absentee ballot applications and inside 
the absentee ballot envelope when returning 
the voted ballot. 
The bill also prohibits public employees 
and agencies from sending unsolicited absen-
tee ballot applications to voters, yet threat-
ens private individuals and organizations 
who are not so prohibited with a substantial 
risk of incurring hefty fines for every appli-
cation they send to an individual who has 
not yet registered to vote or who has already 
requested a ballot or voted absentee. 
SB 202 significantly limits the accessi-
bility of absentee ballot drop boxes to voters. 
While all counties would be required to have 
at least one, the placement of drop boxes is 
limited to early voting locations and drop 
boxes are available only to voters who can 
enter the early voting location during early 
voting hours to deposit their ballot inside 
the box. Thus, drop boxes are essentially use-
less to voters who can vote early in-person 
or who cannot access early voting hours at 
all due to work or other commitments dur-
ing early voting hours. 
The bill also mandates an earlier deadline 
of 11 days before an election to request an 
absentee ballot, leaving some voters who be-
come ill or have to travel out of the area in 
the lurch if they cannot vote during early 
voting and are unable to meet the earlier 
deadline to apply for a ballot. 
These restrictions were adopted right after 
the November 2020 election, where voters of 
color used absentee ballots to an unprece-
dented degree, and in the cases of Black (29.4 
percent) and Asian (40.3 percent) voters, at 
higher rates than white (25.3 percent) voters. 
Given this seemingly disproportionate im-
pact on voters of color, I believe that if Geor-
gia were subject to Section 5, these provi-
sions would have been found retrogressive, 
and never would have been in effect. Instead, 
these provisions will be contested through 
time and resource intensive litigation under 
complex legal standards. 
F. The Impact of Shelby County on the Loss 
of Observer Coverage 
A less discussed impact of the Shelby 
County decision is on the loss of federal ob-
server coverage. Under Section 8 of the Vot-
ing Rights Act, the federal government had 
the authority to send federal observers to 
monitor any component of the election proc-
ess in any Section 4(b) jurisdiction provided 
that the Attorney General determined that 
the appointment of observers was necessary 
to enforce the guarantees of the 14th and 
15th Amendments. A federal district court 
can also authorize the use of observers when 
the court deems it necessary to enforce the 
guarantees of the 14th or 15th Amendments 
as part of a proceeding challenging a voting 
law or practice under any statute to enforce 
the voting guarantees under the 14th or 15th 
Amendment. 
In the 2014 National Commission report, we 
determined that the Attorney General had 
certified 153 jurisdictions in eleven states for 
observer coverage and that the Department 
of Justice had sent several thousand observ-
ers to observe several hundred elections from 
1995 to 2012. 
While officially not stating this, the prac-
tice of the Department of Justice has been to 
apply the Supreme Court’s finding that the 
Section 4(b) coverage formula is unconstitu-
tional not just to preclearance, but to ob-
server coverage. The Shelby County decision 
has reduced observer coverage to a trickle. 
The Department of Justice has instead em-
ployed what it calls ‘‘monitors.’’ 
The difference between federal observers 
and monitors is dramatic. Under the Voting 
Rights Act, ‘‘Observers shall be authorized 
to—(1) enter and attend at any place for 
holding an election in such subdivision for 
the purpose of observing whether persons 
who are entitled to vote are being permitted 
to vote; and (2) enter and attend at any place 
for tabulating the votes cast at any election 
held in such subdivision for the purpose of 
observing whether votes cast by persons en-
titled to vote are being properly tabulated.’’ 
Monitors have no such rights: a jurisdiction 
does not need to provide any access to the 
voting process to any monitor. 
It is not difficult to see the difference in 
how this plays out in practice. In a year 
where legislatures in formerly covered states 
like Arizona and Texas are conducting audits 
of election results or considering restricting 
the ability of election officials to limit the 
conduct of partisan poll watchers, it becomes 
vitally important for the federal government 
to have discretion to send observers to places 
with a history of voting discrimination for 
the purpose of ensuring that processes are 
fair and that voters of color are not 
disenfranchised. 
G. Proposed Congressional Response to Shelby 
County 
In 2019, the House passed H.R. 4, also 
known as the John Lewis Voting Rights Ad-
vancement Act, named after one of the true 
giants of our lifetimes, a person who lit-
erally put his life on the line so that others 
could vote free of discrimination on the basis 
of the color of their skin. Now is the time for 
Congress to honor his memory with passage 
of a bill that resuscitates Section 5. 
H.R. 4 contains many beneficial provisions. 
It creates a new formula that determines 
which states would be subject to the 
preclearance provisions of Section 5, based 
on clearly defined incidents of voting rights 
violations; 
it 
creates 
a 
practice-based 
preclearance process applicable nationwide, 
based on clearly defined covered practices 
that have been shown to be particularly sus-
ceptible to use in a discriminatory fashion; 
it clarifies the authority of the Attorney 
General to assign observers to enforce con-
stitutional and statutory protections of the 
right to vote; and it creates a ‘‘trans-
parency’’ requirement for all states and po-
litical subdivisions to provide public notice 
of any change in voting practices or proce-
dures. 
We respectfully suggest that more is need-
ed, and that the ‘‘transparency’’ requirement 
provides the appropriate vehicle for our rec-
ommendation. The ‘‘transparency’’ provision 
in the prior H.R. 4, requires that any State 
or political subdivision that makes any 
change in a voting practice or procedure in 
any election for Federal office that results in 
a difference with that which has been in 
place 180 days before the date of the Federal 
election must provide reasonable and de-
tailed public notice of the change within 48 
hours. Additional, specific requirements for 
notice are provided as for polling place 
changes for Federal elections and for the 
changes in the constituency that will par-
ticipate in any election through redistricting 
or reapportionment. 
We agree that notice by any state or polit-
ical subdivision of changes in voting prac-
tices or procedures and to any prerequisite 
to voting is essential to any effective re-
sponse to the Shelby County decision, but we 
see no reason to limit the notice require-
ment to changes affecting Federal elections. 
Second, while notice is of overarching im-
portance, more is needed. There must be an 
opportunity for voters, and those statutorily 
charged with protecting the civil rights of 
voters, to analyze the proposed change, and, 
if necessary, seek judicial relief if it appears 
that the change will be discriminatory. 
Thus, we propose a relatively modest waiting 
period of 30 days after notice is given before 
the change may be implemented. This leads 
to our third, and most important, rec-
ommendation. As is implicit in the creation 
of a waiting period before a change in voting 
practices may take effect, there must be the 
concomitant creation of a cause of action 
that allows for a determination as to wheth-
er the change may be implemented. For that, 
we recommend consideration of a standard 
that has been time-tested in the context of 
the pre-Shelby County Section 5 litigation: 
the retrogression standard. We recommend 
that the United States or an aggrieved party 
be granted the right to bring an action if the 
voting change would have the effect of di-
minishing the ability to vote of any citizens 
of the United States on account of race or 
color on in contravention of the guarantees 
set forth in the language minority provisions 
of the Voting Rights Act. It has long been 
settled that ‘‘ ‘the purpose of § 5 has always 
been to insure that no voting-procedure 
changes would be made that would lead to a 
retrogression in the position of racial mi-
norities with respect to their effective exer-
cise of the electoral [process].’ ’’ However, 
compared with Section 5, which requires the 
state to prove a lack of discriminatory pur-
pose or effect, the cause of action we rec-
ommend would require the Attorney General 
or an aggrieved party to prove retrogression. 
The ‘‘retrogression cause of action’’ pro-
vides an additional, reasonable, and nec-
essary weapon in the fight against suppres-
sive and discriminatory voting practices. 
First, and most important, it responds to 
current needs, which are not limited to those 
states and political sub-divisions that may 
be subject to geographic coverage or which 
attempt to implement practices known to be 
susceptible to discriminatory applications. 
As of July 14, 2021, at least 18 states had en-
acted laws this year that made it harder to 
vote. These laws were passed not only in 
states like Georgia and Arizona, that were 
previously covered by Section 4 of the Vot-
ing Rights Act, but also by states not pre-
viously covered, such as Indiana, Idaho, Kan-
sas, Montana, Nevada, Oklahoma, Utah, and 
Wyoming, and included provisions not cap-
tured in the ‘‘known practices’’ category, in-
cluding those that make mail voting and 
early voting more difficult. 
We believe that these amendments, indi-
vidually and collectively, are constitutional 
under the current constitutional framework 
under the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amend-
ments. These amendments would respond to 
the current problems of jurisdictions enact-
ing retrogressive voting changes that may be 
difficult to challenge under other provisions. 
In comparison to the needs addressed under 
this proposal, the burdens created under this 
proposal are relatively modest. The require-
ment of providing notice of changes provides

almost no burden, as it would take little ef-
fort to provide notice. The concept of a 
stand-still period before a jurisdiction can 
implement a change is not unknown in our 
laws, and is required when interests that 
have less or no constitutional protection as 
compared with the right to vote, are at 
stake. Given that most voting changes are 
not instituted—and should not be insti-
tuted—too close to an election, the 30-day 
stand-still would have limited adverse im-
pact on states and political subdivisions, but 
would provide the substantial benefit of al-
lowing voters time to assess the potential ef-
fect of the change. 
Furthermore, the burden of creating a 
cause of action prohibiting retrogressive vot-
ing changes is constitutionally acceptable 
under the circumstances. The Supreme Court 
has stated that Congress has the enforce-
ment authority to address voting changes 
that have a discriminatory effect. In addi-
tion, because numerous other civil rights 
laws allow for discriminatory effect causes 
of action, including Title VII of the Civil 
Rights Act of 1964, involving employment 
discrimination, and the Fair Housing Act of 
1968, permitting such a cause of action is 
hardly unusual. 
Finally, creating a cause of action for ret-
rogression nationally does not implicate the 
concerns about the equal sovereignty of the 
States, expressed by the majority in the 
Shelby County decision. The retrogression 
cause of action should not be a threat to 
those jurisdictions whose proposed voting 
practices changes are intended to make it 
easier for voters to vote, because a party 
would have to successfully bring suit in 
order to stop the change, which seems im-
plausible under the circumstances. The bur-
den is placed on the party challenging the 
change. Proving retrogression is not as com-
plicated as proving discriminatory results 
under Section 2, but it is a high standard, 
and history has taught us that it is perfectly 
suitable to assess the discriminatory effects 
of proposed changes in voting practices. 
Why and How Congress Must Respond to 
Brnovich 
A. Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act 
From the ratification of the Fifteenth 
Amendment in 1870 through the 1960s, the 
federal government tried—and failed—to de-
feat the ‘‘insidious and pervasive evil’’ of 
‘‘racial discrimination in voting,’’ which had 
been ‘‘perpetuated . . . through unremitting 
and ingenious defiance of the Constitution.’’ 
Although Justice Frankfurter wrote long 
ago that the Fifteenth Amendment targeted 
‘‘contrivances by a state to thwart equality 
in the enjoyment of the right to vote’’ and 
‘‘nullifie[d] sophisticated as well as simple- 
minded modes of discrimination[,]’’ prior to 
the VRA’s passage, this language proved 
largely aspirational. 
Responding to the states’ tenacious ‘‘abil-
ity . . . to stay one step ahead of federal 
law,’’ Congress passed the VRA to provide a 
‘‘new weapon[] against discrimination.’’ The 
Act ‘‘reflect[ed] Congress’ firm intention to 
rid the country of racial discrimination in 
voting.’’ The essence of the VRA’s protec-
tions was exemplified in Section 2, which 
provided: ‘‘No voting qualification or pre-
requisite to voting, or standard, practice, or 
procedure shall be imposed or applied by any 
State or political subdivision to deny or 
abridge the right of any citizen of the United 
States to vote on account of race or color.’’ 
Notwithstanding Section 2’s broad lan-
guage, jurisdictions sought to evade its 
reach 
by 
placing 
‘‘heavy 
emphasis 
on 
facially neutral techniques.’’ These ‘‘tech-
niques’’ included everything from ‘‘setting 
elections at inconvenient times’’ to ‘‘causing 
. . . election day irregularities’’ to ‘‘moving 
polling places or establishing them in incon-
venient . . . locations.’’ In one Mississippi 
county, voters were forced to ‘‘travel 100 
miles roundtrip to register to vote.’’ In one 
Alabama county, ‘‘the only registration of-
fice in the county [was] closed weekends, 
evenings and lunch hours.’’ These regula-
tions ostensibly governed the time, place, 
and manner of voting in a neutral way, but 
they ‘‘particularly handicap[ped] minori-
ties.’’ 
Against this backdrop, and responding to 
this Court’s plurality decision in City of Mo-
bile v. Bolden, which had read into Section 2 
a ‘‘discriminatory purpose’’ element, Con-
gress expressly expanded Section 2, now codi-
fied at 52 U.S.C. § 10301. As amended, Section 
2 prohibits any ‘‘voting qualification or pre-
requisite to voting or standard, practice, or 
procedure . . . which results in a denial or 
abridgement of the right of any citizen of the 
United States to vote on account of race or 
color.’’Congress further specified that, under 
Section 2, a violation is established if, 
‘‘based 
on 
the 
totality 
of 
[the] 
cir-
cumstances,’’ the political processes leading 
to an election are not ‘‘equally open to par-
ticipation’’ by minority voters so that they 
have less opportunity than white voters ‘‘to 
particpate in the political process and to 
elect representatives of their choice.’’ By 
adopting this ‘‘results test,’’ Congress cap-
tured the ‘‘complex and subtle’’ practices 
which ‘‘may seem part of the everyday 
rough-and-tumble of American politics’’ but 
are ‘‘clearly the latest in a direct line of re-
peated efforts to perpetuate the results of 
past voting discrimination.’’ 
Section 2 provides relief for both vote dilu-
tion—schemes that reduce the weight of mi-
nority votes—and vote denial—standards, 
practices, or procedures that impede minor-
ity citizens from casting votes or having 
their votes counted. Vote-denial cases were 
the paradigmatic, ‘‘first generation’’ cases 
brought under Section 2. Only later did the 
Supreme Court ‘‘determine[] that the Act ap-
plies to ‘vote dilution’ as well.’’ 
Thirty-five years ago, in Gingles v. Thorn-
burg, the Court recognized that Congress in-
serted the words ‘‘results in’’ to frame the 
Section 2 inquiry. Instead of asking whether, 
in a vacuum, a voting practice facially 
sounds as if it denies or abridges the rights 
of minority voters, the question is: in con-
text, does the practice ‘‘interact’’ with pre- 
existing social and historical conditions to 
result in that burden? Answering this ques-
tion requires courts to examine the chal-
lenged practice not as a theoretical postu-
late, but as a law or regulation that inter-
acts with real-world conditions and must be 
evaluated through a fact-heavy, ‘‘intensely 
local appraisal,’’ that accounts for the ‘‘to-
tality of [the] circumstances.’’ 
In Gingles, the Court explained the ‘‘es-
sence of a § 2 claim is that a certain elec-
toral law, practice, or structure interacts 
with social and historical conditions to 
cause an inequality in the [voting] opportu-
nities enjoyed by black and white voters.’’80 
Recognizing 
Section 
2’s 
command 
that 
courts 
consider 
the 
‘‘totality 
of 
cir-
cumstances,’’ the Gingles Court looked to 
the Senate Report accompanying the 1982 
amendments to compile a list of relevant 
‘‘circumstances.’’ These nine social and his-
torical conditions—the ‘‘Senate Factors’’— 
include considerations such as the history of 
official discrimination in the jurisdiction 
(Factor One); the extent of discrimination in 
the jurisdiction’s education, employment, 
and health systems (Factor Five); and 
whether the challenged practice has a ten-
uous justification (Factor Nine). 
Since Gingles, four different Circuits ad-
dressing vote-denial cases have used the 
foundation laid in Gingles to analyze these 
matters. This formulation distills Section 2 
liability into a two-part test: (1) there must 
be a disparate burden on the voting rights of 
minority voters (‘‘an inequality in the oppor-
tunities enjoyed’’); and (2) that burden must 
be caused by the challenged voting practice 
(‘‘a certain electoral law, practice, or struc-
ture . . . cause[s] an inequality’’) because the 
practice ‘‘interacts with social and historical 
conditions’’ of racial discrimination. No 
other Circuit has put forth an alternative 
formulation. 
B. The Facts of Brnovich 
That was the situation until Brnovich. In 
Brnovich, the Supreme Court reviewed two 
Arizona voting practices: one mandated that 
votes cast out of the voter’s precinct 
(‘‘OOP’’) not be counted; the other prohibited 
the collection of mail-in ballots by anyone 
other than an election official, a mail car-
rier, or a voter’s family member, household 
member or caregiver. Plaintiffs had claimed 
that these practices violated Section 2 of the 
Voting Rights Act. 
The United States District Court for the 
District of Arizona had ruled against the 
plaintiffs on both claims, but, applying the 
settled standards described above, the United 
States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit 
had reversed, en banc, finding that the out- 
of-precinct policy violated the ‘‘results’’ 
prong of Section 2 and that the limitations 
on collections of absentee ballots violated 
both the ‘‘results’’ and ‘‘intent’’ prongs of 
Section 2. 
As to the out-of-precinct policy, the Ninth 
Circuit identified several factors, acknowl-
edged by the district court, leading to a 
higher rate of OOP voting by voters of color 
than by white voters: frequent changes in 
polling locations (polling places of voters of 
color experienced stability at a rate 30 per-
cent lower than the rate for whites); con-
fusing placement of polling locations (indige-
nous populations in particular lived farther 
from their assigned polling places than did 
white voters,); and high rates of residential 
mobility. As a result, 1 in every 100 Black 
voters, 1 in every 100 Latinx voter, and 1 in 
every 100 indigenous peoples voter cast an 
OOP ballot, compared to 1 in every 200 white 
voters. 
As to the absentee-ballot collection limita-
tion, the Ninth Circuit relied on the district 
court’s finding that voters of color were 
more likely than white voters to return their 
early ballots with the assistance of third 
parties. The disparity was the result of the 
special challenges experienced by commu-
nities that lack easy access to outgoing mail 
services, socioeconomically disadvantaged 
voters who lacked reliable transportation, 
and voters who had trouble finding time to 
return mail because they worked multiple 
jobs or lacked childcare services, all burdens 
that disproportionately fall on Arizona’s mi-
nority voters. 
Applying the ‘‘totality of circumstances’’ 
test, with primary reliance on the Senate 
factors that demonstrated a history of dis-
crimination in Arizona that persists to this 
day, the Ninth Circuit found that both the 
OOP policy and the absentee-ballot collec-
tion law violated the ‘‘results’’ prong of Sec-
tion 2 of the VRA. The court also found that 
the absentee ballot law had been enacted 
with discriminatory intent, based on state-
ments of the sponsor and a racist video used 
to promote passage of the law. 
C. The Brnovich Decision: Its Meaning, and 
Its Consequences 
In Brnovich, a 6–3 Court reversed the Ninth 
Circuit’s decision. Had it done so by applying 
the settled standards, we may not be here 
today. But, in writing for the Court’s major-
ity, Justice Alito provided guidelines for fu-
ture treatment of Section 2 vote denial ‘‘re-
sults’’ cases that were not only new, but also

August 24, 2021 
contrary—or at least dilutive of—the dec-
ades-long accepted standards. 
I emphasize Brnovich does not spell the 
end of Section 2 cases. Rather, it unneces-
sarily and unreasonably makes it more dif-
ficult for civil rights plaintiffs to win Sec-
tion 2 actions, when they already were dif-
ficult to prevail. And it does so in a way that 
flies in the face of congressional intent. Fur-
ther, it raises too many ambiguities in too 
many important areas to leave it to the 
courts to fill in the blanks. The greater dif-
ficulty and ambiguity threaten to undermine 
the core purpose of the Voting Rights Act. 
1. Brnovich is a solution in search of a 
problem 
First, Brnovich purports to cure a non-ex-
istent problem. One of the premises of 
Brnovich is that ‘‘[i]n recent years, [Section 
2 vote denial claims] have proliferated in the 
lower courts.’’ In support of this statement, 
the Court relies on the amicus curiae briefs 
of Sen. Ted Cruz, the State of Ohio, and the 
Liberty 
Justice 
Center. 
However, 
those 
briefs describe a total of perhaps 16 cases, 
dating back over 7 years, and only 3 of them 
led to a finding of Section 2 liability. 
The fact is that since Congress amended 
Section 2 in 1982 and since the Supreme 
Court supplied its test for adjudicating Sec-
tion 2 violations, the Supreme Court has 
never deemed it necessary to review a single 
Section 2 vote-denial case. At the same time, 
there was absolutely no evidence that courts 
were being overwhelmed by Section 2 vote 
denial cases. And when such cases are 
brought, courts have had no trouble applying 
the standard to separate discriminatory vot-
ing practices from benign election regula-
tions. In short, the pre-existing standard had 
worked well. 
2. Brnovich reads a remedial statute nar-
rowly 
One of the most important canons of statu-
tory construction—and one that gives the 
greatest deference to congressional intent— 
is that remedial statutes are to be broadly 
construed, and there are few statutes in this 
Nation’s history more remedial than the 
Voting Rights Act of 1965. Yet, rather than 
read the Act expansively, the Court created 
new stringent ‘‘guideposts,’’ most promi-
nently suggesting higher standards for both 
the size of the burden and the size of the dis-
parity, and a lower standard for the State to 
meet to justify the burdens it is placing on 
the right to vote. 
The purported touchstone of the Brnovich 
opinion is the Court’s construction of the re-
quirement in Section 2(b) that the political 
process be ‘‘equally open’’ as the ‘‘core’’ re-
quirement of the law. The concept of equal 
‘‘opportunity’’ as used in the same statute, 
the Court acknowledged somewhat grudg-
ingly, ‘‘may stretch that concept to some de-
gree to include consideration of a person’s 
ability to use the means that are equally 
open.’’ In that context, the Court turned to 
the ‘‘totality of the circumstances’’ test, and 
said that ‘‘any circumstance that has a log-
ical bearing on whether voting is ‘equally 
open’ and afford equal ‘opportunity’ may be 
considered,’’ and proceeded to list five ‘‘im-
portant circumstances’’ that were relevant. 
Some of these ‘‘important circumstances’’ 
seem fairly innocuous on their face: e.g., the 
size of the burden, the size of the disparity. 
Others not so much: e.g., the degree of depar-
ture of the challenged practice from prac-
tices standard when Section 2 was amended 
in 1982 or which are widespread today, and 
the opportunities provided by the electoral 
process as a whole. Another has never been 
deemed relevant to Section 2 analysis: the 
strength of the state’s justification for the 
practice—except in connection with assess-
ment of the tenuousness of that justifica-
tion. Overall, however, the devil is in the de-
tails, and in the ambiguities created by the 
Court’s specific choice of language that may 
pave the way for state legislatures to enact 
additional discriminatory laws and for lower 
courts to apply Section 2 parsimoniously in 
vote denial ‘‘results’’ cases. 
3. The size of the burden should include 
factors specific to the affected commu-
nity resulting from discrimination 
The first factor that Justice Alito high-
lighted was the ‘‘size of the burden,’’ empha-
sizing that voters ‘‘must tolerate the usual 
burden of voting.’’ The application of this 
‘‘guidepost’’ by legislatures and lower courts 
might be colored by a footnote at the end of 
the paragraph on burden, where Justice 
Alito expounded on what ‘‘openness’’ and 
‘‘opportunity’’ might mean (as, say, with 
museums or school courses that are open to 
all) as compared to the ‘‘absence of incon-
venience’’ (such as lack of adequate trans-
portation or conflicting obligations). The 
vagueness with which the Court left this 
issue, and its relegation to a footnote, may 
limit its precedential impact, but its prac-
tical impact may be substantial. 
What Justice Alito does not acknowledge 
is that some of these indicia of what he calls 
‘‘inconvenience’’ are themselves not simply 
subjective to an individual, but, are reflec-
tive 
of 
a 
group’s 
socio-economic 
cir-
cumstances, that are themselves the product 
of a history of discrimination. In the Texas 
Photo ID case, for example, we were able to 
demonstrate that not only were Black and 
Latinx voters more likely than white voters 
not to possess the required photo ID, but 
that they were more likely than white voters 
not to be able to get the ID because of, 
among other reasons, lack of access to trans-
portation. 
The same logic might apply to polling 
place location and closure decisions that 
might make it just that much more burden-
some for voters of color than for white vot-
ers to vote. Or, as in the new Georgia stat-
ute, SB 202, prohibiting line relief—the pro-
vision of food and water to those waiting in 
line to vote—particularly when voters of 
color are much more often confronted with 
long wait-times than are white voters. 
Mandating additional voter ID require-
ments in order to submit an application for 
an absentee ballot or to return a voted ab-
sentee ballot is another new hurdle voters 
will now face in Georgia under its new omni-
bus bill. Under this provision, voters request-
ing an absentee ballot must submit with 
their application their driver’s license num-
ber, their personal identification number on 
a state-issued personal identification card, 
or a photocopy of other specified forms of 
identification. For voters who do not have a 
Georgia’s driver license or state ID card 
number, voting absentee will now require ac-
cess to photocopy technology. Voters with-
out such access to technology will face a 
higher burden in complying with these ID re-
quirements. Recent data shows that Black 
Georgians are 58 percent more likely and 
Latinx Georgians are 74 percent more likely 
to lack computer access in their homes as 
compared to their white counterparts. Thus, 
we can expect voters of color to face a sig-
nificantly higher burden than white voters 
in complying with the ID requirements for 
requesting and returning absentee ballots. 
If Brnovich is construed by state legisla-
tures as permitting them to impose barriers 
that affect different racial or ethnic groups 
differently because of their relative wealth— 
particularly 
when 
those 
differences 
are 
themselves the product of historic discrimi-
natory practices—it will have a serious im-
pact on the voting rights of persons of color. 
4. 1982 Standards and Widespread Practice 
Are Not Important 
Second, Justice Alito said that other rel-
evant factors included the degree of depar-
ture of the challenged practice from the 
‘‘standard practice when § 2 was amended in 
1982,’’ a choice which is largely left unex-
plained, other than in rebuttal to Justice 
Kagan’s dissent, in which he writes, some-
what tautologically, that ‘‘rules that were 
and are commonplace are useful comparators 
when considering the totality of the cir-
cumstances.’’ Although the Court acknowl-
edges that this would not apply to practices 
that themselves were discriminatory in 1982, 
the fact is that such benchmarks are neither 
necessary nor productive. If the history of 
voter discrimination in this country has 
taught us anything, it is that those who 
want to stop voters of color from voting 
change their methods with the times, and 
with the change in the ways voters of color 
are voting. 
Again, Georgia is illustrative. In Georgia, 
state legislators responded to the record- 
shattering turnout of 2020 by passing omni-
bus legislation that restricts the right to 
vote at nearly every step of the process and 
disproportionately affects voters of color. 
Among its provisions, the law requires voter 
identification in order to request an absentee 
ballot and vote absentee; severely limits ac-
cess to absentee ballot drop boxes; and sig-
nificantly shortens the period in which vot-
ers can apply for and cast absentee ballots. 
These restrictions were adopted right after 
the November 2020 election where voters of 
color used absentee ballots to an unprece-
dented degree, and in the cases of Black (29.4 
percent) and Asian (40.3 percent) voters, at 
higher rates than white (25.3 percent per-
cent) voters. But, Justice Alito’s reasoning 
may be construed as supporting the propo-
sition that, if in 1982, Georgia did not make 
absentee ballots universally available, that 
could be a ‘‘highly important’’ consideration, 
even if voters of color are more heavily im-
pacted than white voters by these changes. 
State legislatures should not be led to be-
lieve that they can get away with erecting 
new barriers to vote based on what they did 
40 years ago. 
Further, Justice Alito also observed that 
the ‘‘widespread’’ present day acceptance of 
the voting practice could justify its use. But 
it was precisely because certain discrimina-
tory practices were ‘‘widespread’’ that the 
Voting Rights Act was necessary. It seems 
incongruous, if not irrational, to justify dis-
crimination by the majority population 
against minority populations on the basis of 
‘‘widespread’’ acceptance. 
5. So-called ‘‘small differences’’ can be im-
portant 
Third, in explaining the importance of the 
size of the disparities, Justice Alito indi-
cates that ‘‘small differences should not be 
artificially magnified,’’ again dealing ob-
liquely with the consequences of the dif-
ferences being caused by differences in 
wealth—which may themselves be the result 
of historic racial discrimination. Specifi-
cally, the Court criticized the Ninth Circuit 
for finding disproportionate impact based on 
a relative comparison of the percentage of 
voters whose votes were rejected because 
they were cast out of precinct. In the case of 
Indigenous, Black, and Latinx voters, the 
percentage was 1% for each group; in the 
case of white voters, the percentage was .05. 
The Court neglected to note that the dis-
criminatory out of precinct practice meant 
that almost 4,000 votes cast by voters of 
color had been rejected—and that if their cir-
cumstances were equivalent to those of 
white voters, 2,000 of their votes would have 
counted.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4451 
August 24, 2021 
The Texas Photo ID case is illustrative. 
There, the court found that, even though 
over 90 percent of all groups had the required 
ID, Black voters were twice as likely as 
white voters not to have the ID, and Latinx 
voters were about three times as likely. In 
fact, the court found that 608,470 Texas vot-
ers lacked the ID. Obviously, the Texas num-
bers are meaningful no matter how viewed. 
But the point is that smaller numbers may 
be too. Legislatures and lower courts should 
not be led to believe that they can chip away 
at electoral margins by reducing the likeli-
hood of voters of color being able to cast 
their votes, no matter how small the effect. 
We need not dwell on the closeness of the 
2020 presidential election in Arizona, Geor-
gia, and Wisconsin to underscore the impor-
tance of even small differentials in impact. 
6. Other opportunities to vote do not nec-
essarily ameliorate discrimination in 
particular methods of voting 
Fourth, Justice Alito explained that the 
opportunities provided by the entire elec-
toral system should be factored into the 
equation, implying that, for example, access 
to absentee ballots may be curtailed, as long 
as the voter can still vote in person. But, if 
an advantageous means of voting is curtailed 
as to one group more than it is to another, 
what difference does it make that there may 
be other methods of voting? If all methods of 
voting made voting equally accessible, there 
would have to be only one method. Obvi-
ously, expanding methods of voting makes it 
more likely that people will vote. And, 
equally obviously, contracting them makes 
it less likely that people will vote. Con-
tracting them in a way that affects some ra-
cial or ethnic groups more than others is in-
consistent with the language and Congres-
sional intent of Section 2. States should not 
be led to believe that they have carte 
blanche to target specific voting practices, 
when the effect is discriminatory, and try to 
justify it by the availability of other means 
of voting. 
7. Justification for discriminatory prac-
tices must be based on reality 
And, fifth, in explaining the state justifica-
tion factor, the Court seemed to open the 
door to a state’s justifying virtually any dis-
criminatory action simply by parroting the 
words ‘‘fraud prevention.’’ Again, while the 
Court did not say so explicitly, the fear is 
that lower courts—and, worse, state legisla-
tures—may so interpret the Court’s opinion. 
The incongruity of the Court’s approach is 
seen in comparing the hundreds of thousands 
of voters who were potentially deprived from 
voting under Texas’s prior Photo ID law, 
with the infinitesimally small number of 
persons even accused of fraudulently voting. 
A state’s choice to prevent non-existent 
fraud at the expense of thousands of votes, 
disproportionately of person of color, is not 
legitimate. Again, permitting such choice, is 
inconsistent with the language of Section 2 
and Congressional intent. 
8. The Senate Factors are relevant 
The Brnovich majority went on to raise 
questions as to whether the Senate Factors 
are relevant to a Section 2 vote denial case, 
implying they are not, but leaving ambig-
uous precisely what the Court means as to 
how the few Factors the Court deems poten-
tially relevant fit in, other than super-
ficially. 
Although Gingles involved vote dilution, 
the decision addressed Section 2 writ large, 
recognizing that ‘‘Section 2 prohibits all 
forms of voting discrimination, not just vote 
dilution.’’ Further, Gingles recognized the 
applicability of the various Senate Factors 
would naturally turn on the type of Section 
2 claim at issue. The Gingles Court’s state-
ment that the Senate Factors will ‘‘often be 
pertinent to certain types of § 2 violations,’’ 
such as dilution, cannot be reconciled with a 
conclusion that the Factors ‘‘only’’ inform 
one specific type of Section 2 claim. 
D. The Growing Present Need 
As with the need for the resuscitation of 
Section 5, recent events reflect the signifi-
cant present-day need for an immediate re-
sponse to Brnovich. As detailed throughout 
this testimony, for example, the recently en-
acted Georgia voter suppression law, SB 202 
increases the burdens for virtually every as-
pect of voting from voting by mail through 
voting in person. At least some aspects of SB 
202 appear to be clearly retrogressive and 
probably would not have been proposed in 
the first place were it not for the decision in 
Shelby County. The effect of the Brnovich 
decision on the challenge to SB 202 remains 
to be seen, but already defendants have 
moved to dismiss the complaints on the basis 
of Brnovich. Although, we strongly believe 
that the complaints as drafted fully and ade-
quately plead a ‘‘results’’ claim under Sec-
tion 2 even post-Brnovich, the very making 
of these arguments demonstrates how those 
who support the erection of barriers to vote 
intend on using that opinion. 
Georgia, of course, is not the only state 
that is considering or has passed laws with 
new barriers to voting that disproportion-
ately affect voters of color. Florida did so 
with SB 90, a law that—similar to Geor-
gia’s—imposes new and unnecessary restric-
tions on absentee ballots, the use of drop- 
boxes, and line-warming. And Texas appears 
poised at this writing to pass an omnibus 
voting bill that would, among other things, 
empower partisan poll watchers with vir-
tually unfettered access in polling places, 
while at the same time tying the hands of 
election officials to stop the poll watchers 
from engaging in intimidating conduct. 
Texas has a well-documented history of 
voter intimidation by poll watchers that has 
disproportionately affected voters of color. 
The courts have acknowledged this pattern 
before—in 2014, a federal district court de-
scribed this very issue: ‘‘Minorities continue 
to have to overcome fear and intimidation 
when they vote. . . . [T]here are still Anglos 
at the polls who demand that minority vot-
ers identify themselves, telling them that if 
they have ever gone to jail, they will go to 
prison if they vote. Additionally, there are 
poll watchers who dress in law enforcement- 
style clothing for an intimidating effect to 
which voters of color are often the target.’’ 
As with Georgia’s SB 202, some of these 
provisions might have been stopped by an ef-
fective Section 5 and challenges to some of 
them may be hampered by the effect of the 
Brnovich decision. The bottom line, however, 
is that recent events have only underscored 
the need for a robust Voting Rights Act. 
E. The Appropriate Congressional Response 
The impact of Brnovich has yet to be 
measured, but common sense and history in-
struct us that those who wish to target vot-
ers of color will undoubtedly feel emboldened 
by a decision that can be read as making it 
more difficult for plaintiffs to prove a Sec-
tion 2 violation, giving state legislatures a 
‘‘Get Out of Jail’’ card to pass voter suppres-
sive legislation and justify it simply by 
claiming ‘‘voter fraud.’’ Although we firmly 
believe that the courts should not apply 
Brnovich in such a manner, the threat is 
there. Continued commitment to the core 
purpose of the Voting Rights Act should not 
be left in the uncertainty created by the am-
biguous 
and 
problematic 
language 
of 
Brnovich. We identify here a number of 
issues for consideration and would be pleased 
to work with the Committee on legislative 
text.: 
Clarify that the ‘‘totality of the cir-
cumstances’’ to support a Section 2 violation 
entails an intensely local appraisal. 
Clarify 
that 
‘‘totality 
of 
the 
cir-
cumstances’’ may include any or all of the 
factors deemed relevant by Gingles, includ-
ing the Senate Factors, and that no factors 
are exclusively pertinent to ‘‘results’’ claims 
or ‘‘dilution’’ claims. These include Factors 1 
and 5, which are important, not for the back- 
of-the-hand reading given them by Justice 
Alito, but because they go to the core issue 
of the interaction between historic socio- 
economic discrimination and the voting 
practice in question. 
Clarify that, in determining the extent to 
which a challenged voting rule burdens mi-
nority voters, the absolute number or the 
percent of voters affected or the presence of 
non-minority voters in the affected area will 
not be dispositive. 
Clarify that in determining whether the 
policy underlying the use of a voting rule is 
tenuous—one of the Senate factors—the 
court should consider whether the voting 
rule in question was actually designed to ad-
vance and in fact materially advances a 
valid and substantiated state interest. That 
preventing voter fraud may be a valid state 
interest should not lead to a determination 
that any voting practice alleged to have been 
enacted to protect fraud is valid, particu-
larly if the instances of voter fraud are rare, 
if not virtually non-existent, and the means 
chosen to combat the alleged fraud scarcely 
further that aim, and, further, do so at the 
expense of preventing eligible voters from 
voting. 
Clarify that a discriminatory law cannot 
be justified on the basis that it was a stand-
ard practice at a particular date, such as 
1982, or is widespread today, but must be 
judged solely on the totality of the cir-
cumstances in the particular jurisdiction, as 
viewed at the time the action under Section 
2 is brought. 
Clarify that the availability of other meth-
ods of voting not impacted by the voting rule 
at issue cannot weigh against finding a vio-
lation. 
Put an end to any doubt, as raised by the 
concurring opinion of Justices Gorsuch and 
Thomas in Brnovich, that there is a private 
cause of action for a Section 2 violation, as 
every Circuit Court of Appeals has held. 
I am not in favor of employing a burden- 
shifting approach because I believe that Sec-
tion 2 vote denial claims should be restored 
to their pre-Brnovich state and burden-shift-
ing has not been part of the Section 2 in-
quiry. In addition, burden-shifting places the 
state’s interest at the center of the inquiry 
in the second and third prongs in the three- 
prong analysis, whereas the focus should be 
on the impact on voters. 
III. Conclusion 
The eight years since the Supreme Court’s 
decision in Shelby County v. Holder have left 
voters of color the most vulnerable to voting 
discrimination they have been in decades. 
The record since the Shelby County decision 
demonstrates what voting rights advocates 
feared—that without Section 5, voting dis-
crimination would increase substantially. 
The Brnovich decision—by creating new hur-
dles for Section 2 claimants to overcome— 
raises the stakes appreciably. Congress must 
act.

TESTIMONY
OF
PROFESSOR
BERNARD
L. 
FRAGA, EMORY UNIVERSITY, ATLANTA, GA, 
BEFORE
THE SUBCOMMITTEE
ON
THE CON-
STITUTION, CIVIL RIGHTS, AND CIVIL LIB-
ERTIES OF THE U.S. HOUSE COMMITTEE ON 
THE JUDICIARY 
THE NEED TO ENHANCE THE VOTING RIGHTS ACT: 
PRACTICE—BASED COVERAGE JULY 27, 2021 
Chair Cohen, Ranking Member Johnson, 
and distinguished members of the com-
mittee, it is an honor to testify before you 
today. My name is Bernard L. Fraga, and I 
am 
an 
associate 
professor 
of 
political 
science, with tenure, at Emory University in 
Atlanta, Georgia. My research focuses on the 
quantitative analysis of elections in the 
United States, with particular attention to 
the causes and consequences of disparities in 
voter turnout. I received my B.A. in Polit-
ical Science and Linguistics from Stanford 
University and my Ph.D. in Government and 
Social Policy from Harvard University. 
The right to vote is the cornerstone of rep-
resentative democracy. In the majority opin-
ion for Reynolds v. Sims, Chief Justice Earl 
Warren noted that as ‘‘the right to exercise 
the franchise in a free and unimpaired man-
ner is preservative of other basic civil and 
political rights, any alleged infringement of 
the right of citizens to vote must be care-
fully and meticulously scrutinized.’’ The 
same year Reynolds v. Sims was argued, 
however, John Lewis was arrested for car-
rying a ‘‘One Man, One Vote’’ sign in Selma, 
Alabama and Fannie Lou Hamer was beaten 
nearly to death by state troopers in Mont-
gomery County, Mississippi for her voting 
rights activism. Less than a week after Chief 
Justice Warren read the Reynolds v. Sims 
decision, Freedom Summer activists James 
Chaney, Andrew Goodman, and Michael 
Schwerner were murdered while trying to or-
ganize a voter registration drive. Thus, at 
the same time voting can be recognized as 
central to our system of government, the 
vote can be denied in places where resistance 
to changing the existing power structure is 
entrenched and unyielding. 
It took federal action through the Voting 
Rights Act of 1965 to change this pattern. 
However, a powerful tool of the act for com-
batting efforts to restrict the right to vote 
was rendered inactive after Shelby County v. 
Holder. In that decision, the preclearance 
provisions of the Voting Rights Act, which 
mandated federal oversight for election law 
changes in a set of states and counties, were 
ruled inoperable as the coverage formula was 
deemed unconstitutional. Noting that while 
‘‘voting discrimination still exists; no one 
doubts that,’’ Chief Justice Roberts called on 
Congress to ‘‘draft another formula based on 
current conditions.’’ 
In the attached report, I outline a flexible, 
forward-looking formula for practice-based 
preclearance that can secure our rights far 
into the future. Drawing on a database of 
over 3,500 legal cases or proceedings related 
to minority voting rights, along with histor-
ical, theoretical, and empirical evidence re-
garding where voting rights violations are 
likely to occur, I show a strong relationship 
between the racial/ethnic composition of a 
state or county and the likelihood that that 
the jurisdiction will see a violation. This 
pattern appears across racial/ethnic minor-
ity groups and over time. Specifically, I find 
the following: 
1. Historical evidence indicates a clear re-
lationship between attempts to restrict the 
franchise and the size of the racial/ethnic mi-
nority population in the jurisdiction. In 
states and counties with a larger minority 
population, efforts to limit the participation 
of racial/ethnic minority citizens are sub-
stantial and persist absent federal interven-
tion to protect the right to vote. (Pgs. 2–7 of 
the report) 
2. In recent years, voting rights-related 
litigation is vastly more common in states 
and counties with sizeable racial/ethnic mi-
nority populations. This pattern persists 
even when isolating the analysis to litiga-
tion resulting in successful prosecution of a 
voting rights case. (Pgs. 8–19 of the report) 
3. Combined with a practice-based ap-
proach to preclearance, a population-limited 
trigger for preclearance coverage can ensure 
an appropriate balance between protecting 
voting rights and creating additional re-
quirements for election officials. The thresh-
old that best balances this tradeoff is 20%, 
such that practice-based preclearance would 
be required for states or counties where at 
least two racial/ethnic groups each make up 
at least 20% of the jurisdiction’s population. 
(Pgs. 19–23 of the report) 
I invite members of the committee to read 
the attached report and the conclusions 
therein, and ask that the report be officially 
entered into the record. In closing, I urge the 
committee to reinvigorate the Voting Rights 
Act and renew the promise of voting rights 
for all Americans. Indeed, no single action 
taken by the members of this Congress may 
be more consequential. It is up to you, and 
the other members of the House and Senate, 
to heed the call. 
A POPULATION-LIMITED TRIGGER
FOR PRAC-
TICE-BASED PRECLEARANCE UNDER THE VOT-
ING RIGHTS ACT 
(By Bernard L. Fraga, Ph.D., Associate Pro-
fessor of Political Science, Emory Univer-
sity, Atlanta, GA) 
I. INTRODUCTION 
In 2013, the Shelby v. Holder decision in-
validated the key formula used to determine 
which jurisdictions would be subject to the 
Section 5 ‘‘preclearance’’ provisions of the 
Voting Rights Act. Writing for the 5–4 ma-
jority, Chief Justice Roberts stated ‘‘a stat-
ute’s current burdens must be justified by 
current needs, and any disparate geographic 
coverage must be sufficiently related to the 
problem that it targets. The coverage for-
mula met that test in 1965, but no longer 
does so.’’ Instead, the Court indicates ‘‘Con-
gress may draft another formula based on 
current conditions . . . Our country has 
changed, and while any racial discrimination 
in voting is too much, Congress must ensure 
that the legislation it passes to remedy that 
problem speaks to current conditions.’’ 
In this report, I outline the rationale for a 
current population-limited trigger for addi-
tional scrutiny of election practices that 
could be used to violate the voting rights of 
Black, Hispanic, Asian American, Pacific Is-
lander, and American Indian/Alaska Native 
(AIAN) populations. I first demonstrate that 
there is strong historical, theoretical, and 
empirical evidence for a relationship be-
tween the share of the electorate that is mi-
nority and potential violations of minority 
voting rights. Using a detailed database of 
recent voting rights act-related litigation, I 
then show that in counties and states where 
two racial/ethnic groups separately compose 
at least 20% of the voting-age population, 
‘‘current conditions’’ justify additional scru-
tiny of covered election practices via the 
Voting Rights Act. 
By constructing a formula for coverage of 
specific election practices based on contem-
porary demographics, I provide a flexible 
trigger that both meets current needs and 
can adapt to the changing conditions of the 
future. Combined with a cogent analysis of 
which election practices should be subject to 
additional scrutiny, and any further triggers 
based on established, recent discriminatory 
practices, this formula could be one part of a 
strengthened Voting Rights Act that pro-
tects the voting rights of all Americans. 
II. HISTORICAL AND THEORETICAL BASIS FOR A 
POPULATION-LIMITED TRIGGER 
In this section, I discuss why a population- 
limited trigger is justifiable based on the ex-
tant record of where minority voting rights 
violations have occurred. I first begin by 
outlining the history of federal oversight to 
protect racial/ethnic minority voting rights. 
Then, drawing on theoretical understandings 
of elections and extant empirical evidence, I 
discuss the circumstances where federal 
oversight may be most necessary to safe-
guard voting rights. 
a. Reconstruction, Jim Crow, and the Role of 
Federal Oversight in Ensuring Minority 
Voting Rights 
For most of U.S. history, the voting rights 
of racial/ethnic minority groups were cur-
tailed by statutes and laws restricting access 
to the franchise. At the start of the Civil 
War, de jure exclusion of the African-Amer-
ican population was nearly complete, as a 
handful of northern states permitted African 
Americans to vote by law, but whether 
enslaved or free, the much larger Black pop-
ulation of the South was excluded from the 
franchise. Native Americans on Indian lands 
and Asian Americans were de jure barred 
from voting as they were ineligible for citi-
zenship or naturalization. Latinos held ten-
uous, but at times electorally relevant vot-
ing rights, especially in the former Mexican 
territories where nearly all Latinos resided 
prior to 1900. 
After the Civil War, the historical record 
of minority voting rights indicates periods of 
expansion, contraction, and then expansion 
that directly coincides with federal action to 
prevent states from de jure or de facto racial/ 
ethnic discrimination in voting. The first no-
table expansion of voting rights to African- 
Americans occurred with the Reconstruction 
Acts of 1867 and 1868, which granted the vote 
to formerly enslaved Black men and placed 
voter registration under the control of Union 
(Northern) 
military 
commanders. 
Over 
700,000 African Americans registered to vote, 
outnumbering White registrants in multiple 
Southern states and ensuring election of a 
Congress and state legislatures conducive to 
the 14th and 15th Amendments. However, the 
14th Amendment’s de facto application to Af-
rican-Americans alone meant that most Na-
tive Americans, Latinos, and Asian Ameri-
cans remained barred from voting. 
White resistance to enfranchisement of 
Black men was immediate, severe, and con-
centrated in the South where the relatively 
high proportion of Black voters relative to 
white voters meant that Black men could 
exert significant influence on election out-
comes. The ‘‘Redeemer’’ movement, as it was 
called, viewed ending Black suffrage as the 
proximate goal to regain political power for 
former Confederates and sympathizers, re-
sorting first to violence and then de facto 
disenfranchising policies implemented by 
local election officials. These policies, in-
cluding poll taxes, literacy tests, and resi-
dency requirements, were administered in a 
racially discriminatory manner but were 
ruled as beyond federal oversight by the Su-
preme Court in U.S. v. Reese. The removal of 
remaining federal troops from the South in 
1877, and Congress’s failure to pass legisla-
tion designed to counter U.S. v. Reese, di-
rectly resulted in heavily-Black Southern 
states passing new constitutions between 
1890 and 1910 with the specific, intentional 
goal of disenfranchising African Americans. 
The second period of expansion again indi-
cates the important role of federal oversight 
in places where racial/ethnic minorities are a 
significant share of the population. Through 
Supreme Court rulings outlawing Grand-
father Clauses (1915) and the final iteration 
of the White Primary (1944), heavily-Black

and heavily-Latino (in particular, Texas) 
states of the South were no longer able to de 
jure prevent African-Americans and Latinos 
from voting statewide. However, the poll tax 
and literacy test were still administered in a 
discriminatory fashion by local officials in 
heavily-Black and Latino counties, just as 
resistance to ending the White Primary was 
strongest in heavily-Black parts of Southern 
states. Indeed, by the 1950s, Black voter reg-
istration rates were relatively high in North-
ern cities and rapidly increasing Southern 
counties with smaller Black concentrations. 
In ending the ban on naturalization for re-
maining Asian and Latin American origin 
groups, the 1952 McCarran-Walter Act opened 
the door to naturalization (and voting 
rights) for any legal resident of the United 
States. Thus, by the mid-1950s federal action 
had eliminated the explicit racially discrimi-
natory barriers to voting outside of heavily- 
minority counties. 
Stronger federal action was necessary to 
ensure voting rights in places with a large 
share of racial/ethnic minority citizens. The 
Civil Rights Acts of 1957, 1960, and 1964 
sought to eliminate discriminatory voter 
registration practices in the South by tar-
geting the methods used by local election of-
ficials to curb Black voter registration. Yet 
resistance continued, culminating in the vio-
lent, ‘‘Bloody Sunday’’ attacks by local offi-
cials in heavily-Black Selma, Alabama. This 
spurred passage of the Voting Rights Act of 
1965, mandating two key forms of federal 
oversight for jurisdictions with a recent his-
tory of discriminatory election practices: 
federal voting registrars and a requirement 
that election law changes are ‘‘precleared’’ 
by federal officials prior to implementation. 
While not explicitly defining states and 
counties subject to federal supervision on 
the basis of population size, each of the 7 
states covered in whole or in part by the cov-
erage formula outlined in Section 4 were at 
least 20% African-American and were the top 
7 states in Black population percentage as of 
the 1970 Census. 
The Voting Rights Act of 1965 was amended 
and expanded to include American Indian/ 
Alaska Native, Hispanic, and Asian Amer-
ican/Pacific Islander populations through 
amendments in 1970 and 1975. Mirroring the 
situation for African-Americans in the Deep 
South, discrimination was most severe in 
states and localities with relatively large 
numbers of Latino and Native American vot-
ers. For instance, testimony in favor of the 
1975 VRA Amendments by Latino witnesses 
focused on voting rights violations in coun-
ties in Texas and California with large 
shares of Latino citizens. Disenfranchise-
ment of Native American voters appeared in 
states and counties with tribal lands and res-
ervations concentrating potential Native 
American voting strength. 
b. Minority Population Size is Associated with 
Attempts to Restrict Voting Rights 
The history of minority voting rights 
briefly outlined above indicates a generaliz-
able relationship between minority popu-
lation size and attempts to restrict voting 
rights. While at various times limitations on 
the franchise were quite widespread (and im-
peded participation for non racial/ethnic mi-
nority groups as well), the pockets of most 
determined efforts to restrict minority vot-
ing rights were areas of the country where 
racial/ethnic groups made up a larger than 
average share of the population. Attempts to 
counter 
continued 
disenfranchisement 
through federal intervention thus also fo-
cused on these areas, during both the Recon-
struction Era and Civil Rights Era. The cre-
ation, preservation, and reinstatement of mi-
nority voting rights across the United States 
thus hinges on the actions of the federal gov-
ernment. 
This historical evidence aligns with theo-
retical expectations about where incentives 
to disenfranchise should be most acute. In an 
often-quoted section of the canonical text 
Southern Politics in State and Nation (1949), 
political scientist V.O. Key noted that ‘‘in 
grand outline the politics of the South re-
volves around the position of the Negro,’’ 
and due to the substantial size of the Black 
population in the historic ‘‘black belt’’ re-
gion, ‘‘the whites of the black belt have the 
most pressing and most intimate concern 
with the maintenance of the established pat-
tern of racial and economic relations.’’ By 
the 1960s, disenfranchisement came with sig-
nificant costs to Southern states and coun-
ties, including threat of sustained protests 
and federal action; in theory, this cost 
should be borne only when white dominance 
on election day would be threatened with 
Black enfranchisement. Indeed, empirical 
evidence indicates that the immediate im-
pact of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 on 
Black enfranchisement was greatest in the 
heavily-Black counties of the Deep South, 
precisely where electoral incentives to dis-
enfranchise were strongest. Thus, while the 
legacy of slavery and Jim Crow may be asso-
ciated with efforts to disenfranchise, the key 
differentiator within the South was minority 
population size. Where minority groups 
could influence politics, even if only as sig-
nificant members of coalitions with White 
voters, efforts to restrict voting rights fol-
lowed. 
These incentives remain most powerful in 
states and counties with significant racial/ 
ethnic minority populations today. Just as 
in the past, where a racial/ethnic group is a 
larger share of the population, they will be 
more likely to have substantial influence on 
election 
outcomes. 
Different 
from 
past 
trends, and speaking to the success of the 
Voting Rights Act in eliminating the most 
egregious forms of disenfranchisement, cam-
paigns, candidates, and voters themselves 
now seek to leverage the power that large 
and/or growing racial/ethnic minority popu-
lations have when given the opportunity to 
vote. Indeed, voter turnout for racial/ethnic 
minority groups is now significantly higher 
in states and counties where minority citi-
zens make up a larger than average share of 
the population. Officeseeking by candidates 
from minority groups is also far more com-
mon in heavily-minority states and legisla-
tive districts, as are opposing efforts to di-
lute minority voting strength via manipula-
tion of electoral systems and district bound-
aries. 
Further discussion of recent trends in po-
tential voting rights violations is provided in 
Section III of this report, but in short, the 
relationship between a state or county’s mi-
nority population size and efforts to dis-
enfranchise minority voters has a solid his-
torical, theoretical, and empirical basis. 
Thus, there is a clear need for federal over-
sight to protect minority voting rights in ju-
risdictions with large shares of minority vot-
ers today, and to provide a flexible coverage 
formula that can account for growing racial/ 
ethnic minority populations in the future. 
This need is most acute in the protection of 
Latino and Asian American/Pacific Islander 
voting rights, whose population growth often 
occurs in areas that did not have a history of 
repressing African-American voting rights. 
III. DETERMINING AN APPROPRIATE 
POPULATION–LIMITED TRIGGER 
If a population size-based trigger is to be 
used to determine which jurisdictions war-
rant additional scrutiny in the application of 
certain election practices, what population 
threshold or thresholds should trigger cov-
erage? Again we must turn to the patterns of 
past voting rights violations, but be cog-
nizant of the need to ‘‘draft another formula 
based on current conditions.’’ In this section, 
I demonstrate that the pattern of potential 
and actual VRA violations from 1982 to the 
present indicates that a racial/ethnic group 
population size threshold of 20% is justifi-
able, that such a formula would provide 
flexibility to address both current and future 
needs as racial/ethnic group populations 
change over time, and that specifying two 
racial/ethnic groups must each meet the 
threshold 
appropriately 
considers 
where 
policies could reasonably impede the voting 
rights of racial/ethnic minority groups. 
a. Tracking Potential Violations of Minority 
Voting Rights 
To track previous potential violations of 
minority voting rights, I rely on a database 
constructed by Dr. J. Morgan Kousser. Dr. 
Kousser is professor emeritus of history and 
social science at the California Institute of 
Technology, and a leading expert on voting 
rights. Dr. Kousser’s research, and specifi-
cally a previous version of the database I 
use, were discussed by Dr. Kousser in testi-
mony to the Subcommittee on the Constitu-
tion, Civil Rights and Civil Liberties of the 
U.S. House Committee on the Judiciary in 
October 2019. In that testimony, Dr. Kousser 
remarked that his effort to ‘‘create a data-
base of all voting rights actions under any 
federal or state statutes or constitutional 
provisions’’ was designed to allow ‘‘evalua-
tions of the adequacy of past and potential 
coverage schemes if Congress wishes to re-
place Section 4 of the VRA.’’ It is in this ca-
pacity that I use his database. 
Dr. Kousser’s database has approximately 
3,540 legal cases or proceedings related to mi-
nority voting rights from 1965 to 2018. Of 
these cases, 2,510 focus on potential viola-
tions of Black voting rights, 801 with poten-
tial violations of Hispanic/Latino voting 
rights, 32 with potential violations of Asian 
American voting rights, and 135 with Amer-
ican Indian or Alaska Native voting rights. 
Table 1 shows the number of cases by group 
and by decade from 1965 to 2018, the most re-
cent year with comprehensive data in Dr. 
Kousser’s database. In Table 1 we see that 
the total number of cases per decade peaked 
in the 1980s and 1990s. Cases where Black and 
Native American voters were the primary 
groups of interest peaked in the 1980s, while 
cases where Hispanic or Asian American citi-
zens were principal groups peaked in the 
1990s. 
Table 1 also provides separate statistics for 
cases involving counties or towns subject to 
the Voting Rights Act Section 5 preclearance 
provisions from 1965 to 2013. A similar pat-
tern of cases by decade and by race appears 
for these jurisdictions in isolation, as prior 
to the invalidation of Section 5 coverage in 
Shelby v. Holder the vast majority of cases 
were in preclearance-covered jurisdictions. 
Of course, the nature of Section 5 coverage 
pre-Shelby meant that the strongest pre-
dictor of a lawsuit or other action being 
taken on behalf of minority plaintiffs was 
whether or not the county was subject to 
preclearance. However, in every decade after 
the 1970s at least 100 cases were filed outside 
of Section 5 preclearance jurisdictions. 
In the more detailed analyses below, I 
focus on the period from 1982 forward, as the 
1982 amendments to the Voting Rights Act 
and Gingles decision clarified the intent of 
the VRA of 1965 with an eye to policies with 
discriminatory effect, not just discrimina-
tory intent. The post–1982 period is also when 
the vast majority of ‘‘successful’’ voting 
rights actions occurred, and the bulk of po-
tential violations of minority voting rights 
overall, constituting 74% of cases in all juris-
dictions and 70% of cases in jurisdictions 
covered by Section 5 from 1965–2013. Finally,

August 24, 2021 
I examine all cases of potential minority 
voting rights violations, not just cases that 
resulted in an outcome favorable to minority 
plaintiffs. Given the different legal standards 
used to make judgements about vote dilution 
versus vote denial, Section 5 versus Section 
2 claims, and voting rights violations more 
broadly over time, the more complete pic-
ture of where plaintiffs indicated a voting 
rights violation may have occurred is one ap-
propriate metric for determining where, e.g., 
U.S Department of Justice resources would 
need to be deployed. 
Finally, this report focuses on counties 
and states as units of analysis, as Dr. 
Kousser’s database is organized at the state 
and county level. American Indian lands are 
also important political units from the per-
spective of American Indian voting rights, 
and a key part of both the Voting Rights Act 
Section 203 language assistance formula and 
the proposed coverage formula. However, 
violations of voting rights occurring in or for 
those with residence in Indian reservations 
are generally directed to the state or county 
whose territory overlaps with those reserva-
tions. 
b. Geographic Pattern of Potential Voting 
Rights Violations 
Compiling Dr. Kousser’s data, we see wide 
dispersion in potential voting rights viola-
tions when examining state-level suits and 
legal actions. Figure 1 shows states with a 
statewide potential voting rights violation 
during the period from 1982–2018. Color indi-
cates which racial/ethnic group’s voting 
rights were most clearly impacted in the 
first alleged statewide violation. Broadly 
speaking, the distribution of first cases by 
race/ethnicity often coincides with which 
groups make up the largest share of the ra-
cial/ethnic minority population in each 
state. In the Deep South, African-American 
plaintiffs were the first to allege a statewide 
violation. In most of the Southwest, Latino 
plaintiffs were first. In Alaska and Arizona, 
both 
of 
which 
came 
under 
Section 
5 
preclearance as a result of historical dis-
crimination 
against 
Alaska 
Native 
and 
American Indian populations, respectively, 
these groups were first to allege a statewide 
violation of their voting rights. 
Figure 2 documents which counties that 
have ever had a violation or potential viola-
tion via litigation. Again, this does not in-
clude the DOJ’s More Information Request 
process, which may mask additional poten-
tial violations that were averted in Section 5 
covered counties. As with the statewide map 
in Figure 1, Figure 2 shows only counties 
with potential voting rights violations oc-
curring between 1982 and 2018. Shading indi-
cates the first group to bring a suit at the 
county level, and counties in white did not 
have a county-level suit. Again, we see a pat-
tern broadly consistent with the known dis-
tribution of racial/ethnic groups in the 
United States, though the map makes it 
more clear that potential voting rights vio-
lations are concentrated in the Deep South, 
heavily-minority 
urban 
counties 
of 
the 
North and Midwest, and some heavily— 
Latino and Native American areas of the 
Southwest and West. 
c. Data on Racial/Ethnic Group Population Size 
Figures 1 and 2 are suggestive of a pattern 
of recent potential voting rights violations 
similar to the historical record I discuss in 
Section II of this report. To provide more 
firm evidence on this dimension, I rely on 
data from the U.S. Census Bureau that is 
contemporaneous to each potential violation 
in Dr. Kousser’s database. Specifically, I rely 
on yearly Intercensal estimates of the vot-
ing-age population by race/ethnicity from 
1982 to the present at both the state and 
county level. Yearly intercensal estimates 
for racial groups other than Whites and Afri-
can-Americans are not available at the coun-
ty level until 1990. Thus, for years from 1982– 
1990, I interpolated the 1980 to 1990 state or 
county-level change in the voting-age popu-
lation by race and ethnicity, providing 
trends in the non-Hispanic White, Black, 
Hispanic, and Asian American/Pacific is-
lander voting-age populations. For years 
from 2010–2018, I rely on data from the U.S. 
Census Bureau’s Population Estimates Pro-
gram (PEP), which is broadly similar to the 
Intercensal estimates. 
As the above indicates, one advantage of a 
coverage trigger based on racial/ethnic popu-
lation size is the fact that all data necessary 
to enact the formula is already collected, 
compiled, and analyzed by the U.S. Census 
Bureau. A determinations file, similar to 
that provided every five years for estab-
lishing coverage under the population-based 
formula for language assistance in Section 
203 of the Voting Rights Act, could be con-
structed by the Census Bureau and provided 
to the Department of Justice for publication 
in the Federal Register. 
d. Correlating Potential Violations with Popu-
lation Size 
A descriptive analysis of the relationship 
between racial/ethnic minority group popu-
lation share and potential voting rights vio-
lations confirms the patterns suggested by 
Figures 1 and 2, and validates the historical 
and theoretical foundations for a population- 
limited trigger for coverage as outlined in 
Section II of this report. 
Dr. Kousser’s database indicates that a 
majority of states have had at least one po-
tential minority voting rights violation 
since 1982. In the 12 states that have not, no 
single racial/ethnic group was 10% or more of 
the state’s voting-age population at any 
point in time between 1982 and 2018. How-
ever, in every state where a single racial/eth-
nic group has been at least 10% of the state’s 
voting-age population, at least one suit or 
action has been brought at the statewide 
level. On average, the first statewide poten-
tial violation in a state occurred when the 
group in question was 12% of the voting-age 
population. For states that have never had a 
statewide violation, the average size of the 
single largest racial/ethnic minority group is 
only 5.2%. 
A county-level analysis provides additional 
insights. As with states, counties that have 
had a violation or potential violation of mi-
nority voting rights since 1982 had larger mi-
nority populations at the time of their first 
potential violation, on average. Since 1982, 
at least 804 counties have had at least one 
potential violation of minority voting rights 
occur in their jurisdiction. 61% of counties 
with violations had their first violations 
happen when a single racial/ethnic minority 
group was 20% or more of the jurisdiction 
voting-age population. Furthermore, only 321 
counties where a single racial/ethnic minor-
ity group makes up more than 20% of the 
population have not had a voting rights-re-
lated lawsuit, approximately one-third of the 
counties with a minority population reach-
ing this threshold. 
Table 2 also indicates that the likelihood 
of a violation increases sharply as the coun-
ty population shifts from having a single ra-
cial/ethnic group making up less than 10% of 
the county’s voting-age population, to 10– 
20%, to 20–30%. Beyond the 20–30% category, 
increases in the percentage of counties with 
a violation are significantly smaller. Indeed, 
once a single non-white racial/ethnic group 
makes up a majority of the county (the final 
row in Table 2), the likelihood of a voting 
rights violation decreases relative to juris-
dictions where a single racial/ethnic group is 
nearly a majority of the voting-age popu-
lation, dropping to roughly the rate we see 
in the 20–30% category. 
Another way of visualizing this pattern is 
presented in Figure 3. Figure 3 plots the 
share of counties with a potential violation 
as a function of the size of the racial/ethnic 
group at the time the violation occurred (or 
the size of the largest racial/ethnic group in 
the county today, if no potential violation 
occurred between 1982 and 2018). The blue 
line is the moving average of the share of 
counties with a potential violation (left side 
of chart) given the racial/ethnic group size 
specified (bottom of the chart). The red line 
in the middle of the chart denotes the point 
where a county has even (50% yes, 50% no) 
odds of a potential violation. 
Figure 3 again shows a very strong rela-
tionship between the size of the racial/ethnic 
minority population and the likelihood of a 
potential voting rights violation. We see a 
roughly linear increase in the likelihood of a 
violation 
as 
the 
population 
approaches 
roughly 20%, with diminishing returns to 
further increases in single minority group 
population size before the probability begins 
to decrease after 50% minority. Further-
more, the point of equal likelihood of having 
a potential violation versus not occurs when 
the racial/ethnic group whose rights may 
have been violated is approximately 20% of 
the overall voting-age population in the ju-
risdiction. Beyond 20%, counties have better- 
than-even chances of having had a potential 
violation, until roughly 75% when the likeli-
hood of a violation drops below 50–50 once 
again. 
A similar pattern is present for counties 
with successful cases, where courts deter-
mined (or appeared set to determine accord-
ing to defendants, as they were settled out of 
court) that a violation of a group’s voting 
rights had occurred. Figure 4 shows these 
patterns at the county level. In Figure 4, we 
see almost exactly the same rate of success-
ful cases as a function of minority group 
population share as we do for the number of 
cases overall (successful or not). The chance 
of a successful voting rights case is better 
than 50–50 when a minority group is about 
25% of the voting-age population in a coun-
ty. Of course, not all voting rights-related 
actions result in an outcome in favor of 
plaintiffs. However, Figure 4’s close match 
with Figure 3 indicates that the relationship 
between voting rights suits and minority 
group size is not attributable to an increased 
number of unsuccessful cases brought by mi-
nority plaintiffs in heavily-minority coun-
ties. 
e. Ensuring equal treatment of counties based 
on probability of a violation 
The analyses above demonstrate that once 
a racial/ethnic minority group grows large 
enough to make up 20% of a county’s voting- 
age population, the probability of at least 
one potential voting rights-related legal ac-
tion reaches 50%. Given the nature of the 
election practices that would be subject to 
preclearance, in that these are commonly 
used practices that are often tarnished by 
those seeking to discriminate against minor-
ity voters, this threshold may be an appro-
priate benchmark for determining where ad-
ditional scrutiny is warranted. However, it is 
important to consider how various popu-
lation thresholds balance the need to protect 
voting rights with the potential to add an 
additional layer of review of state and coun-
ty election practices. 
In any process where some jurisdictions 
are going to be subject to additional scru-
tiny, while others are subject to conven-
tional review, there will be instances where 
after the fact we see that the additional 
scrutiny did not result in finding a violation 
or the conventional review revealed a viola-
tion on its own. Therefore while the goal is

to minimize such instances, it is not real-
istic to eliminate them entirely. With this in 
mind, Table 3 examines the suitability of 
various single-group relative population size 
thresholds in terms of the recent history of 
potential voting rights violations in counties 
nationwide. Under the population thresholds 
listed in the first column of Table 3, a coun-
ty would gain practice-based preclearance if 
it had a single non-white racial/ethnic 
group’s population making up the indicated 
percentage of the voting-age population in 
the county. The ‘‘False Negative Rate’’, also 
called Type I error, indicates the percent of 
counties that would not be covered via the 
indicated population threshold formula, but 
did have a potential violation. The false neg-
ative rates in Table 3 indicate that with all 
population thresholds higher than 20%, more 
than half of counties having potential viola-
tions would not have triggered practice- 
based preclearance based on the population 
at the time of their first potential violation. 
The ‘‘False Positive Rate,’’ also called 
Type II error, indicates the percent of coun-
ties that are covered via the listed popu-
lation threshold-based trigger, but have 
never had a potential violation in Dr. 
Kousser’s database. While generally lower 
than the false negative rate, we do see that 
at both the high end of the potential thresh-
olds and low end of potential thresholds, a 
larger share of jurisdictions would be subject 
to preclearance despite never having a vot-
ing rights suit filed against the jurisdiction. 
The final column of Table 3, titled ‘‘Over-
all Error Rate’’ aggregates Type I and Type 
II error and shows the percent of counties 
nationwide that are either incorrectly ex-
cluded (not covered despite having had a vio-
lation) or incorrectly included (covered de-
spite never having a violation). While dif-
ferences between coverage thresholds are rel-
atively small, we do see that the 20% thresh-
old for coverage minimizes the overall num-
ber of counties with violations that are 
missed and covered counties that have not 
had suits filed against them in the past. 
At the highest racial/ethnic minority popu-
lation percentages, Figure 3 shows that the 
rate of potential violations decreases dras-
tically. Table 3 also indicates that the num-
ber of false positives begins to increase with 
thresholds beyond 30%, as in recent decades 
heavily-minority counties have not had po-
tential voting rights violations despite many 
of 
these 
counties 
being 
subject 
to 
preclearance under Section 5 of the Voting 
Rights Act. From a theoretical perspective, 
this is logical: in such places contemporary 
methods used to violate minority voting 
rights are unlikely to change the underlying 
dynamic of which racial/ethnic group holds 
power, so attempts to disenfranchise are 
rare. Therefore, in places where a single mi-
nority group is more than 80% of the popu-
lation, and therefore (numerical) minority 
racial/ethnic group is less than 20%, dis-
enfranchisement 
is 
similarly 
unlikely. 
Crafting a two-group formula as such also 
accords with the reality that 15th Amend-
ment protections apply to all Americans, not 
just members of specific racial/ethnic minor-
ity groups. 
Table 4 documents the effect of using a 
two-group threshold on false negative, false 
positive, and overall error rates. Error rates 
are little changed from Table 3, as today, few 
counties have a single racial/ethnic minority 
group at or exceeding 80% of the county’s 
population. However, the small number of 
counties that do have such a high minority 
population have no recent history of voting 
rights violations, and with future demo-
graphic shifts more counties will likely fall 
into this category in the future. Requiring 
that two racial/ethnic groups are at least 
20% of the voting-age population in a juris-
diction thus both recognizes the ‘‘current 
conditions’’ cited by C.J. Roberts in the 
Shelby decision, and acknowledges how our 
country will ‘‘change’’ in the future. 
The 20% threshold proposed above also 
serves to allocate legal resources as effi-
ciently as possible. Due to the nature of the 
election procedures that would be subject to 
preclearance, where policies may be facially 
race-neutral but used to discriminate under 
certain circumstances, it may be useful to 
concentrate 
additional 
effort 
on 
places 
where discriminatory effect is more likely to 
occur. Counties unlikely to have a violation 
may not need extra scrutiny for these com-
monplace practices. Of course, jurisdictions 
under the threshold could still be subject to 
litigation under Section 2 of the Voting 
Rights Act, as they are today. These juris-
dictions may also fall into coverage as their 
racial/ethnic minority population grows. 
IV. CONCLUSION 
For over 150 years, the federal government 
has played a key role in preserving the vot-
ing rights of racial/ethnic minorities. After 
the Civil War, the erosion of minority voting 
rights was most severe in states of the 
former Confederacy with large African- 
American populations; the Voting Rights 
Act of 1965 targeted these states and counties 
and secured the right to vote for all Ameri-
cans. In the words of C.J. Roberts, ‘‘there is 
no denying that, due to the Voting Rights 
Act, our Nation has made great strides,’’ but 
the changing demographic and political pro-
file of the country persuaded the Court to 
call for a formula based on ‘‘current condi-
tions’’ of racial discrimination in voting that 
‘‘no one doubts’’ still exist. 
In this report, I provided the rationale for 
one such formula. Tracking thousands of 
voting rights-related judicial actions in re-
cent decades, and buttressed by historical, 
theoretical, and empirical evidence regard-
ing where voting rights violations are likely 
to occur, I show a strong relationship be-
tween the racial/ethnic composition of a 
state or jurisdiction and the likelihood that 
the jurisdiction will see a violation of racial/ 
ethnic minority voting rights. Evaluating 
tradeoffs between various population size- 
based thresholds, I also demonstrate that 
one threshold in particular, 20%, ensures 
fairness in which jurisdictions are subject to 
the added scrutiny of a tailored preclearance 
provision. 
The Voting Rights Act of 1965’s special pro-
visions were a key tool in the federal govern-
ment’s arsenal to ensure all Americans could 
participate in the electoral process. A flexi-
ble, forward-looking formula will ensure 
that the Act can continue to secure our 
rights far into the future. No other action of 
the current Congress may be more con-
sequential than the reinvigoration of this 
commitment to the American people. 
AUGUST 23, 2021. 
Please Support H.R. 4, John Lewis Voting 
Rights Advancement Act 
DEAR REPRESENTATIVE: On behalf of The 
Leadership Conference on Civil and Human 
Rights, a coalition of more than 220 national 
organizations committed to promoting and 
protecting the civil and human rights of all 
persons in the United States, and the 96 un-
dersigned organizations, we write in strong 
support of H.R. 4, the John Lewis Voting 
Rights Advancement Act. 
In 1965, Congress passed the Voting Rights 
Act to outlaw racial discrimination in vot-
ing, and it became our nation’s most success-
ful and consequential civil rights law. Pre-
viously, many states barred Black voters 
from participating in the political system 
through literacy tests, poll taxes, voter in-
timidation, and violence. By outlawing the 
tests and devices that prevented people of 
color from voting, the Voting Rights Act and 
its prophylactic preclearance formula put 
teeth into the 15th Amendment’s guarantee 
that no citizen can be denied the right to 
vote because of the color of their skin. 
Only 15 years ago, Congress reauthorized 
the Voting Rights Act for the fourth time 
with sweeping bipartisan support. The House 
of Representatives reauthorized the legisla-
tion by a 390–33 vote and the Senate passed it 
unanimously, 98–0. Given the importance of 
the Voting Rights Act, Congress undertook 
that reauthorization with care and delibera-
tion—holding 21 hearings, hearing from more 
than 90 witnesses, and compiling a record of 
more than 15,000 pages of evidence of con-
tinuing racial discrimination in voting. 
SHELBY COUNTY V. HOLDER 
In 2013, the U.S. Supreme Court’s ruling in 
Shelby County v. Holder eviscerated the 
most powerful provision of the Voting Rights 
Act: the Section 5 preclearance system. This 
provision applied to nine states and local-
ities in another six states. These jurisdic-
tions were required to obtain preclearance 
from the Justice Department or the U.S. Dis-
trict Court for the District of Columbia be-
fore implementing any change in a voting 
practice or procedure. 
Section 5 was immensely successful in 
blocking proposed voting restrictions in 
states and localities with histories of racial 
discrimination. It also ensured that changes 
to voting rules were public, transparent, and 
evaluated to protect voters against discrimi-
nation based on race and language. But, in 
Shelby County, Chief Justice John Roberts 
on behalf of the majority, declared that ‘‘Our 
country has changed.’’ The Court held that 
the formula identifying jurisdictions subject 
to preclearance was decades-old and out-
dated, functionally halting the preclearance 
requirement. However, the Court invited 
Congress to assess ‘‘current conditions’’ to 
update the formula for deciding which juris-
dictions should be covered by preclearance. 
Despite the best efforts of The Leadership 
Conference and its many member organiza-
tions to protect voting rights and promote 
civic participation, the impact of eight years 
of overt and covert anti-voter tactics has 
had a lasting impact. The Supreme Court’s 
invalidation of the preclearance formula re-
leased an immediate and sustained flood of 
new voting restrictions in formerly covered 
states. Without the Voting Rights Act’s 
tools to fight the most blatant forms of dis-
crimination, people of color continue to face 
barriers to exercising their most important 
civil right, including voter intimidation, 
felon disenfranchisement laws built on top of 
a system of mass incarceration, burdensome 
and costly voter ID requirements, and purges 
from the voter rolls. States have also cut 
back early voting opportunities, eliminated 
same-day voter registration, and shuttered 
polling places. 
The Leadership Conference commissioned 
several state reports that were prepared by 
our partner civil rights organizations and al-
lies to document the breadth and depth of re-
cent voting discrimination in ten states 
across the country. These reports powerfully 
demonstrate that Congress has an urgent im-
perative to restore the Voting Rights Act. 
Individually and collectively, they reveal 
that voting discrimination after Shelby 
County is pervasive, persistent, and adapt-
ive, sometimes taking new forms but no less 
pernicious. The reports document voter re-
strictions passed this year and cite the re-
cent history of voting discrimination in 
these states. This is the ‘‘current discrimina-
tion’’ on which Congress must update the 
preclearance formula and make several addi-
tional amendments to the Voting Rights Act

so voters of color everywhere can fully par-
ticipate in the political process. All of the 
state reports have or will be introduced into 
the congressional record of the August 16, 
2021, House Judiciary hearing on Oversight 
of the Voting Rights Act: Potential Legisla-
tive Reforms. 
BRNOVICH V. DEMOCRATIC NATIONAL COMMITTEE 
Furthermore, just last month, the Su-
preme Court ruled in Brnovich v. Democratic 
National Committee that two discriminatory 
Arizona voting laws did not violate Section 2 
of the Voting Rights Act. In its opinion in 
Brnovich, the Court disregards the congres-
sional purpose of Section 2, which is to pro-
vide a powerful means to combat race dis-
crimination in voting and representation. 
The majority departs from decades of prece-
dent enforcing Section 2 according to Con-
gress’ intent, and it creates new ‘‘guide-
posts’’ that will ineffectively identify and 
eradicate discriminatory policies and prac-
tices. The decision relies on a limited inter-
pretation of the Voting Rights Act that will 
make it more difficult to challenge discrimi-
natory voting laws. This decision reiterates 
the need for Congress to pass the John Lewis 
Voting Rights Advancement Act to restore 
the legislative purpose of Section 2. 
EVIDENCE OF THE NEED FOR THE JOHN LEWIS 
VOTING RIGHTS ADVANCEMENT ACT 
Discriminatory voting practices are not 
merely the province of those states with a 
long history of discrimination. Pernicious 
practices such as voter purging and restric-
tive identification requirements—which dis-
proportionately affect voters of color—occur 
in states throughout the nation. As we com-
memorated the 56th anniversary of the Vot-
ing Rights Act earlier this month, it is im-
portant to note that between January 1 and 
July 14, 2021, at least 18 states enacted 30 
new laws that restrict our freedom to vote, 
and more than 400 bills with restrictive pro-
visions have been introduced in 49 states in 
the 2021 legislative sessions. 
During the 117th Congress, the Senate 
Committee on the Judiciary, House Com-
mittee on the Judiciary, and the Committee 
on House Administration have held a total of 
14 hearings and found significant evidence 
that barriers to voter participation remain 
for people of color and language-minority 
voters. 
The Senate Committee on the Judiciary 
has held three hearings on voting rights: 
Restoring the Voting Rights Act after 
Brnovich and Shelby County (July 14, 2021); 
Supreme Court Fact-Finding and the Distor-
tion of American Democracy (April 27, 2021); 
Jim Crow 2021: The Latest Assault on the 
Right to Vote (April 20, 2021). 
The House Judiciary Committee, Sub-
committee on the Constitution, Civil Rights, 
and Civil Liberties has held six hearings on 
voting rights: 
Oversight of the Voting Rights Act: Poten-
tial Legislative Reforms (August 16, 2021); 
The Need to Enhance the Voting Rights Act: 
Practice-Based Coverage (July 27, 2021); The 
Implications of Brnovich v. Democratic Na-
tional Committee and Potential Legislative 
Responses (July 16, 2021); The Need to En-
hance the Voting Rights Act: Preliminary 
Injunctions, Bail-in Coverage, Election Ob-
servers, and Notice (June 29, 2021); Oversight

Record of Discrimination (May 27, 2021); 
Oversight of the Voting Rights Act: The 
Evolving Landscape of Voting Discrimina-
tion (April 22, 2021). 
The House Administration’s Subcommittee 
on Elections has held five investigatory 
hearings with 35 witnesses, collected numer-
ous reports and documents, and released a 
comprehensive report.

THE JOHN LEWIS VOTING RIGHTS ADVANCEMENT 
ACT RESTORES AND MODERNIZES THE VOTING 
RIGHTS ACT 
The Voting Rights Act of 1965 was passed 
with leadership from both the Republican 
and Democratic parties, and the reauthoriza-
tions of its enforcement provisions were 
signed into law each time by Republican 
presidents: President Nixon in 1970, Presi-
dent Ford in 1975, President Reagan in 1982, 
and President Bush in 2006. For more than 
half a century, protecting citizens from ra-
cial discrimination in voting has been bipar-
tisan work. 
The John Lewis Voting Rights Advance-
ment Act fills a distinct and critical role in 
protecting the freedom to vote and ensuring 
elections are safe and accessible. When it 
comes to our elections, we all want an open 
and transparent process we can trust, where 
Americans have equal freedom to vote, 
whether we live in a small town or big city, 
or the coasts or the Midwest. Passage of the 
John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act 
will fulfill part of that promise of a democ-
racy that works for—and includes—us all. 
The John Lewis Voting Rights Advance-
ment Act would restore the VRA in the fol-
lowing ways: 
The Act would update criteria under the 
‘‘geographic trigger’’ for identifying states 
and localities required to obtain federal re-
view of voting changes before they are im-
plemented. 
Under the ‘‘practice-based’’ trigger, every 
state and locality nationwide that is suffi-
ciently diverse would be required to obtain 
federal review before enacting specific types 
of voting changes that are known to be dis-
criminatory in their use to silence the grow-
ing political power of voters of color. 
The Act would require all states and local-
ities to provide public notice to all voters of 
certain voting changes. 
The Act would address the Brnovich deci-
sion by clarifying factors that voters of color 
can use to prove a vote dilution or vote de-
nial claim under Section 2 of the VRA and 
restoring voters’ full ability to challenge ra-
cial discrimination in voting in court. 
The Act would allow the Department of 
Justice and voters of color to challenge 
changes in a voting rule that would make 
voters of color worse off in terms of their 
voting rights than the status quo. 
The Act would expand authority for courts 
to ‘‘bail-in’’ jurisdictions to the preclearance 
process and would update the ability of juris-
dictions to ‘‘bail-out’’ of the preclearance 
process once they demonstrate a record of 
not harming voters of color. 
The Act would grant the Department of 
Justice authority to compel the production 
of documents relevant to investigations of 
potential voting rights violations prior to 
filing an enforcement action. 
The U.S. Attorney General would have au-
thority to request federal observers any-
where there is a serious threat of racial dis-
crimination in voting. 
The Act would provide voters with addi-
tional protection by easing the standard for 
when courts can temporarily block certain 
types of voting changes while the change is 
under review in court. This is important be-
cause once a voter is discriminated against 
in an election, it cannot be undone. 
CONCLUSION 
When President Lyndon Johnson signed 
the Voting Rights Act of 1965, he declared 
the law a triumph and said, ‘‘Today we 
strike away the last major shackle of . . .
fierce and ancient bonds.’’ But 56 years later, 
the shackles of white supremacy still re-
strict the full exercise of our rights and free-
dom to vote. 
For democracy to work for all of us, it 
must include us all. When certain commu-
nities cannot access the ballot and when 
they are not represented in the ranks of 
power, our democracy is in peril. The coordi-
nated, anti-democratic campaign to restrict 
the vote targets the heart of the nation’s 
promise: that every voice and every eligible 
vote count. Congress must meet the urgency 
of this moment and pass the John Lewis Vot-
ing Rights Advancement Act. This bill will 
restore the essential provision of the Voting 
Rights Act that blocks discriminatory vot-
ing practices before they go into effect, put-
ting a transparent process in place for pro-
tecting the right to vote. It will also restore 
other provisions to help bring down the bar-
riers erected to silence Black, Brown, Na-
tive, young, and new Americans and ensure 
everyone has a voice in the decisions impact-
ing our lives. 
On March 7, 1965, just a few months before 
President Johnson would sign the Voting 
Rights Act into law, then 25-year-old John 
Lewis led more than 600 people across the 
Edmund Pettus Bridge to demand equal vot-
ing rights. State troopers unleashed brutal 
violence against the marchers. Lewis himself 
was beaten and bloodied. But he never gave 
up the fight. For decades, the congressman 
implored his colleagues in Congress to real-
ize the promise of equal opportunity for all 
in our democratic process. Before his death, 
he wrote: ‘‘Time is of the essence to preserve 
the integrity and promises of our democ-
racy.’’ Members of this body must now heed 
his call with all the force they can muster 
and support the John Lewis Voting Rights 
Advancement Act.

STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY 
H.R. 4—JOHN R. LEWIS VOTING RIGHTS ADVANCE-
MENT ACT OF 2021—REP. SEWELL, D–AL, AND 
218 COSPONSORS 
The 
Administration 
strongly 
supports 
House passage of H.R. 4, the John R. Lewis 
Voting Rights Advancement Act of 2021 
(VRAA). 
The right to vote freely, the right to vote 
fairly, the right to have your vote counted is 
fundamental. In the last election, all told, 
more than 150 million Americans of every 
age, of every race, of every background exer-
cised their right to vote. 
This historic level of participation in the 
face of a once-in-a-century pandemic should 
have been celebrated by everyone. Instead, 
some have sought to delegitimize the elec-
tion and make it harder to vote, in many 
cases by targeting the methods of voting 
that made it possible for many voters to par-
ticipate. These efforts violate the most basic 
ideals of America. 
Yet another massive wave of discrimina-
tory action may be imminent as we enter a 
new legislative redistricting cycle. Unfortu-
nately, incumbents too often cling to power 
by drawing district lines to favor their own 
prospects at the expense of minority commu-
nities, choosing their voters instead of the 
other way around. 
While anti-voter action undermines democ-
racy for all Americans, we know that com-
munities of color often suffer the worst ef-
fects of these measures—and all too often, 
that is not by accident. 
The sacred right to vote is under attack 
across the country. 
The VRAA will strengthen vital legal pro-
tections to ensure that all Americans have a 
fair opportunity to participate in our democ-
racy. Among other things, it would create a 
new framework for allowing DOJ to review 
voting changes in jurisdictions with a his-
tory of discrimination to ensure that they do 
not discriminate based on race. It would also 
clarify the scope of legal tools designed to 
challenge discriminatory voting laws in 
court, ensuring that the Voting Rights Act 
offers protection against modern forms of 
voter suppression. 
In an essay published shortly after he died, 
Congressman John Lewis wrote, ‘‘Democracy 
is not a state. It is an act[.]’’ This bill not 
only bears his name, it heeds his call. The 
Administration looks forward to working 
with Congress as the VRAA proceeds through 
the legislative process to ensure that the bill 
achieves lasting reform consistent with Con-
gress’ broad constitutional authority to pro-
tect voting rights and to strengthen our de-
mocracy.

VOTER SUPPRESSION IN 2020 
(By William Wilder) 
I. INTRODUCTION 
In key respects, the 2020 elections dem-
onstrated the strength and resilience of 
America’s electoral system. Voter turnout 
smashed records in almost every state, and 
despite unprecedented challenges from the 
pandemic, we did not suffer an election ad-
ministration catastrophe. Opponents of vot-
ing rights suggest that these successes mean 
that voting barriers are no longer a signifi-
cant concern and that our country has 
moved past the era of voter suppression. 
However, a closer look into turnout numbers 
reveals persistent and troubling racial dis-
parities that are due in part to racial dis-
crimination in the voting process. And in the 
2020 election cycle, voter suppression was 
alive and well. 
Overall, 70.9 percent of eligible white vot-
ers cast ballots in the 2020 elections, com-
pared with only 58.4 percent of non-white 
voters. Despite significant gains in overall 
voter participation, the turnout gap between 
white and non-white voters has gone vir-
tually unchanged since 2014 and has in fact 
grown since its modern-era lows in 2008 and 
2012, according to a recent Brennan Center 
analysis. 
During the same period, racially discrimi-
natory voter suppression entered a new age. 
After the 2010 elections, for the first time 
since the peak of the Jim Crow era, states 
across the country began to enact laws mak-
ing it more difficult to vote. This wave of 
voter suppression was intertwined with race 
and the nation’s changing racial demo-
graphics and was, at least in part, a backlash 
against rising turnout among communities 
of color contributing to the election of the 
nation’s first Black president. Efforts to sup-
press the votes of communities of color ac-
celerated in 2013, when the Supreme Court 
gutted a key part of the Voting Rights Act 
in Shelby County v. Holder. In the eight 
years since, and especially in 2020, these 
trends continued. 
Racial discrimination in voting takes 
many forms, ranging from blatant and open 
attempts to restrict access to voting among 
communities of color to more subtle policies 
that place heavier burdens on certain com-
munities. In 2020, voters of color faced the 
full spectrum of racial voter suppression. 
This report provides an overview of the var-
ious forms of racially discriminatory voter 
suppression that took place in the 2020 elec-
tions and their aftermath. 
The purpose of this report is to catalog in-
stances of discriminatory voting changes and 
practices occurring in and since 2020 and pro-
vide context for the broader political move-
ment behind many of these changes. In 
terms of voter suppression, 2020 was a banner 
year, and not just because of the volume of 
racially discriminatory changes and inci-
dents. Increasingly, the public officials and 
political operatives behind these voting 
changes are acknowledging that the intent 
of their new laws and policies is to exclude 
certain people from the electorate and bring 
about particular outcomes. 
For example, as Arizona legislators were 
debating new restrictive voting bills, State 
Rep. John Kavanagh stated that Arizona Re-
publicans 
‘‘don’t 
mind 
putting 
security 
measures in that won’t let everybody vote’’ 
and that he was more concerned with the 
‘‘quality of votes’’ than with overall voter 
turnout. When defending two of Arizona’s re-
strictive voting laws before the Supreme 
Court in March 2021, the attorney for the Re-
publican National Committee admitted that 
the party’s interest in the laws was to avoid 
being at ‘‘a competitive disadvantage rel-
ative to Democrats.’’ And when discussing 
proposals to expand access to mail voting, 
President Trump stated that an expansion of 
early and mail voting would lead to ‘‘levels 
of voting that if you agreed to it, you’d 
never have a Republican elected in this 
country again.’’ 
These statements do not represent judicial 
findings of intentional discrimination. But 
when viewed alongside the long list of in-
stances of discrimination and racial dispari-
ties in the 2020 election cycle, these state-
ments offer a window into discriminatory in-
tent playing out in real time. This public 
rhetoric provides important context for un-
derstanding the full spectrum of discrimina-
tory effects discussed in this report. 
Examples of discriminatory voting prac-
tices—including new restrictive legislation, 
discriminatory voter roll purges, long lines 
and closed polling places, voter intimidation 
and misinformation, and efforts to over-
throw elections through litigation or by in-
validating ballots cast by mail—must all be 
viewed in the context of these obvious state-
ments of intent. All of these instances are 
evidence of the same underlying problem: 
the persistence and evolution of unconstitu-
tional racial discrimination in our election 
system.

REPRESENTATION FOR SOME 
THE DISCRIMINATORY NATURE OF LIMITING 
REPRESENTATION TO ADULT CITIZENS 
(By Yurij Rudensky, Ethan Herenstein, 
Peter Miller, Gabriella Limo´n, and Annie 
Lo) 
INTRODUCTION 
Every 10 years, political districts at all 
levels of government are redrawn to make 
sure they are equal in population as required 
by the U.S. Constitution. Currently every 
state apportions representatives and draws 
congressional and state legislative districts 
on the basis of a state’s total population. 
That is, when districts are drawn, all people 
living in the state, including children and 
noncitizens, are counted for the purposes of 
representation. 
However, 
some 
Republican 
political 
operatives and elected officials aim to unset-
tle this long-standing practice by excluding 
children and noncitizens from the population 
figures used to draw state legislative dis-
tricts. Rather than count everyone, states 
would draw districts based only on the adult 
citizen population. This approach is rooted 
in an explicitly discriminatory plan to dis-
advantage growing Latino (and, to a lesser 
extent, Asian American and Black) commu-
nities. It would enable states to pack chil-
dren and noncitizens, who are disproportion-
ately Latino, Asian American, and Black,

into sprawling, supersized legislative dis-
tricts. Residents of these districts would re-
ceive less representation than they do under 
the total population approach that states 
currently use, and this could have tremen-
dous consequences for the funding of crucial 
public goods—including schools and trans-
portation—that are used by everyone in a 
community regardless of age or citizenship 
status. 
Making such a break with current practice 
and precedent would be of dubious legality 
and would leave states vulnerable to a host 
of legal challenges. It also would have major 
practical implications for redistricting. This 
study looks at what such a change would 
mean for representation and the allocation 
of political power in the United States by fo-
cusing on its impact three demographically 
distinct states: Texas, Georgia, and Missouri. 
Our findings include the following: 
Citizen children, not noncitizens, would ac-
count for the overwhelming majority of 
those excluded in adult citizen–based dis-
tricts. Citizen children make up more than 
70 percent of those who would be excluded in 
Texas, 80 percent in Georgia, and 90 percent 
in Missouri. 
Large portions of the population in all 
three states would no longer be counted in 
adult citizen–based districts. Nearly 36 per-
cent of the total population in Texas, 30 per-
cent in Georgia, and 25 percent in Missouri 
would be excluded from the apportionment 
of legislative seats. 
Communities of color would be dispropor-
tionately impacted. Latino and Asian Amer-
ican communities in particular would suffer 
substantially greater exclusion than their 
white counterparts. While only about 20 per-
cent of the white population across the three 
states would be left uncounted, nearly 30 per-
cent of the Black population and more than 
50 percent of the Latino and Asian American 
populations would be excluded from legisla-
tive districts. The situation in Georgia 
would be particularly stark, with nearly 70 
percent of Latino residents, most of whom 
are children, excluded. 
Diverse metropolitan areas that support 
majority-minority districts would cede rep-
resentation to whiter, more rural regions. 
The Houston, Dallas, and Rio Grande Valley 
regions of Texas would see sharp reductions 
in representation. In Georgia, the apportion-
ment shift would hit metro Atlanta. And in 
Missouri, the representational losses would 
flow from areas around Kansas City and St. 
Louis. In all three states, many of the cur-
rent districts that provide Latino and Black 
communities an opportunity to secure rep-
resentatives of their choice would no longer 
be viable or would need to be significantly 
reconfigured. 
Many of the areas that would be most im-
pacted by an apportionment shift face deep 
inequities and new challenges, underscoring 
their urgent need for full representation. In 
Missouri, losses in representation would be 
borne primarily by Black neighborhoods in 
Kansas City and St. Louis that were for-
mally segregated during the Jim Crow era 
and that continue to suffer from disinvest-
ment. In Texas, under-populated districts, 
which would need to expand to bring in addi-
tional adult citizens, include much of his-
torically Black Houston as well as over-
whelmingly Latino areas, including colonias 
near the U.S.–Mexico border that increas-
ingly face infrastructural and climate-re-
lated environmental dangers. In Georgia, 
representational 
losses 
would 
be 
con-
centrated in the rapidly diversifying suburbs 
of Atlanta, where communities of color are 
taking on historically white political estab-
lishments to address urgent political needs 
around education and policing.

RACIAL TURNOUT GAP GREW IN JURISDICTIONS 
PREVIOUSLY
COVERED
BY
THE
VOTING 
RIGHTS ACT 
(By Kevin Morris, Peter Miller, and Coryn 
Grange) 
In 2013, when Chief Justice John Roberts 
delivered the Supreme Court’s majority 
opinion in Shelby County v. Holder, he ar-
gued that the Voting Rights Act of 1965’s 
preclearance requirement under Section 5 
was no longer needed because ‘‘African- 
American voter turnout has come to exceed 
white voter turnout in five of the six States 
[Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, 
and South Carolina] originally covered by § 5 
with a gap in the sixth State of less than one 
half of one percent [Virginia].’’ Although 
this was true in 2012—and only 2012—the 
white-Black turnout gap in these states re-
opened in subsequent years, and by 2020, 
white turnout exceeded Black turnout in five 
of the six states. 
REPLICATING THE SHELBY COUNTY OPINION 
METHODS 
Using the same source of census data that 
was used in the Shelby County opinion, we 
show that the racial turnout gap has in-
creased in most jurisdictions that were pre-
viously covered by preclearance. Racial 
turnout rates are calculated by dividing the 
number of ballots cast by the estimated cit-
izen population above the age of 18. This 
analysis was compiled from the past 24 years 
of general-election voter data from eight 
states. The states used are based on the eight 
states the Voting Rights Advancement Act 
(VRAA), as introduced in 2019, will likely 
cover, according to recent congressional tes-
timony by George Washington University 
law professor Peyton McCrary. Those states 
are Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, 
Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, 
and Texas—all of which were covered in 
whole or in part by the preclearance provi-
sions of the Voting Rights Act before Shelby 
County. 
Broad conclusions made about the turnout 
of eligible Latino and Asian voters in states 
where they are underrepresented can be im-
precise due to the small sample size provided 
by census data. We controlled for this defi-
ciency in data by only analyzing states’ 
Latino and Asian American turnout for 
years that had at least 30 Latino and Asian 
American eligible voters accounted for. 
Overall, we found that the larger the Latino 
and Asian American population of states, the 
closer the size the white-nonwhite turnout 
gap mirrored the results of the Brennan Cen-
ter’s examination of the same gap at a na-
tionwide level, due to the greater representa-
tion of these undercounted groups. When this 
wasn’t the case, the white-nonwhite gap 
more closely mirrored the white-Black gap. 
We also believe the white-nonwhite gap 
may be underestimated, as the census data 
we use for analysis fails to provide informa-
tion on Native American voter turnout, a 
group that is significantly impacted by dis-
criminatory voting laws. However, we do 
know from the National Congress of Amer-
ican Indians that registered voters in this 
group have a lower turnout rate than other 
racial groups, which provides the basis for 
our assumption. 
RACIAL TURNOUT GAPS IN JURISDICTIONS TO BE 
COVERED
BY
THE
VOTING
RIGHTS
ADVANCE-
MENT ACT 
While in 2012, just before the Shelby Coun-
ty decision, the white-Black turnout gap was 
shrinking in the states we analyzed, and in 
many instances even briefly closed, this 
trend has reversed in the years since. In 2012, 
seven out of the eight states had Black voter 
turnout higher than that of white voters. In 
2020, the reverse is true—in only one of the 
eight states was Black turnout higher than 
white turnout. 
In a few states, this reversal is especially 
alarming. Louisiana, South Carolina, and 
Texas had higher turnout gaps in 2020 than 
at any point in the past 24 years. South 
Carolina’s white-Black turnout gap widened 
the most, expanding by a staggering 20.9 per-
centage points within the eight years since 
Shelby County. While Black turnout exceed-
ed white turnout in 2012, white turnout was 
more than 15 percentage points higher than 
Black turnout in 2020. 
A similar trend can be seen in the gap be-
tween white voters and all nonwhite voters. 
The total white-nonwhite turnout gap has 
grown since 2012 in all of the eight states 
likely to be covered under the VRAA. There 
is sufficient data to conclude that the gap 
has increased for Blacks, Hispanics, and 
Asians in Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, 
South Carolina, and Texas. In Alabama, Lou-
isiana, and Mississippi, the sample sizes in 
the available 2020 census data are too small 
for Hispanic and Asian voters to make much 
of a difference in an overall white-nonwhite 
turnout gap estimation that is distinct from 
the white-Black turnout gap in those states. 
Notably, North Carolina went from having a 
larger share of nonwhite voters represented 
in 2012 with a white-nonwhite gap of ¥9.3 
percentage points to having a gap of 5.4 per-
centage points, a jump of 14.7 percentage 
points, far greater than the national average 
of 4.6 percentage points. 
Overall, we see that the growth in the ra-
cial turnout gaps between 2012 and 2020 were 
even starker in the states likely to be sub-
ject to preclearance under the VRAA than 
those seen nationwide. Seven out of the 
eight states had white-nonwhite turnout 
gaps that grew more than the national rate 
of 4.6 percentage points between 2012 and 
2020. And in four out of the eight states to be 
subject to preclearance under the VRAA, the 
white-Black turnout gap grew more than the 
national rate of 10.3 percentage points from 
2012 to 2020. 
Expanding the analysis to other nonwhite 
groups also reveals that, even in 2012, 
progress on closing racial turnout gaps was 
not as significant as the Shelby County deci-
sion suggested. The Court only examined the 
white-Black turnout gap, which did tempo-
rarily close in many states in 2012, likely due 
to Barack Obama being on the ballot and 
Black voter turnout subsequently surging. 
But with the exception of Latino voter turn-
out briefly surpassing white turnout in Flor-
ida in 2012 and Louisiana in 2012 and 2016, 
Latino voter turnout has lagged behind 
white voter turnout for the last 24 years in 
every state where those rates are measur-
able. 
SHELBY COUNTY’S AFTERMATH 
In 2013, the Supreme Court suggested that 
the closing of the racial turnout gap sup-
ported the conclusion that the need for 
preclearance was over. As this analysis 
shows, in the years following the Shelby 
County decision, these racial turnout gaps 
widened once again. The reopening of the ra-
cial turnout gap likely has many causes, and 
it is possible that the ending of the 
preclearance condition has played a role. 
What is clear, however, is that the trends 
identified by the Supreme Court have re-
versed themselves with alarming speed.

August 24, 2021 
presidential election in a century, despite a 
global pandemic. This was true for the entire 
electorate as well as for each racial group— 
more Black Americans voted in 2020 than 
any presidential election since 2012, and 
Latino Americans and Asian Americans also 
surpassed their previous turnout records. 
(Unfortunately, we don’t have comparable 
figures for Native Americans.) 
These successes have been and should be 
celebrated. However, they must not be mis-
taken for signs that racial discrimination in 
voting is no longer an enormous problem, 
one that continues to advantage white vot-
ers to a degree that must be remedied. 
The 2020 election must also be remembered 
for another turnout statistic: 70.9 percent of 
white voters cast ballots while only 58.4 per-
cent of nonwhite voters did. As the graph 
below shows, 62.6 percent of Black American 
voters, 53.7 percent of Latino American vot-
ers, and 59.7 percent of Asian American vot-
ers cast ballots in 2020. 
There is ample evidence that the sorts of 
barriers being introduced this year dis-
proportionately reduce turnout for voters of 
color. The gaps between white and nonwhite 
voters are bound to get worse. That’s why 
it’s necessary to reverse these new voting re-
strictions. 
NARROWING THE GAP, BUT ONLY TEMPORARILY 
The difference between white and nonwhite 
voter turnout has remained relatively un-
changed over the last six presidential elec-
tions, with a few notable fluctuations. In 
2008 and 2012, Barack Obama was on the bal-
lot, and turnout among Black voters in those 
elections was higher than at any point since 
1996. And in 2012, the gap between white and 
nonwhite voter turnout narrowed to 8 per-
centage points, the lowest since 1996. 
The graph below shows that after reaching 
that record low in 2012, the turnout gap ex-
panded once again between white voters and 
nonwhite voters, reaching 12.6 percentage 
points in the 2016 presidential election and 
12.5 in 2020. 
The graph also shows a decrease in 
nonwhite voter turnout between the 2008 and 
2012 elections. After the record turnout in 
2008, many state legislatures reacted by 
quickly passing a spate of new restrictive 
voting laws that made it disproportionately 
difficult for voters of color to cast ballots. 
In 2013, the Supreme Court used the nar-
rowing of the turnout gap between white and 
Black voters in 2008 and 2012, as seen in the 
following graph, to justify gutting key pro-
tections against racial discrimination in the 
Voting Rights Act of 1965. That ruling in 
Shelby County v. Holder made it easier for 
states to enact restrictive policies. 
THE GAPS BETWEEN WHITE VOTERS AND 
INDIVIDUAL RACIAL GROUPS 
2021 looks like 2009 in that high nonwhite 
voter turnout in the presidential election 
has been followed by restrictive voting laws, 
but there’s a crucial difference. As the graph 
above indicates, the racial turnout gap nar-
rowed between 2004 and 2008, but not between 
2016 and 2020. The 2021 backlash is coming at 
a point when the disparities in turnout be-
tween racial groups are significantly larger 
than they were in 2008 and 2012. 
While the gap between nonwhite voters and 
white voters has stayed about the same in 
the 2016 and 2020 elections, the gaps between 
white voters and voters of specific racial 
groups have varied. As the graph below dem-
onstrates, the white-Asian gap narrowed sig-
nificantly, from 16.3 percentage points in 
2016 to 11.3 points last year, even as the 
white-Black turnout gap widened relative to 
2016, going from 5.9 percentage points to 8.3 
points. This is not to say that the white- 
Asian gap closed. As the graph makes clear, 
the white-Asian gap had previously been 
very large, and although the white-Asian 
turnout gap reached its lowest level in at 
least two decades in 2020, white voter turn-
out was still more than 10 percentage points 
higher than that of Asian Americans. 
This narrowing of the white-Asian gap was 
offset by an increase in the white-Black 
turnout gap from 2016 to 2020. As the graph 
shows, the white-Black gap has consistently 
grown since 2012. In 2020, it reached the high-
est point in a presidential election since at 
least 1996. 
The white-Latino turnout gap has pre-
viously been very large, and the same was 
true in 2020. At 17.2 percentage points, the 
2020 white-Latino turnout gap was larger 
than the gaps between white voters and 
other racial groups, and it remained vir-
tually unchanged from 2016. 
As noted earlier, the Census Bureau data 
we draw on for this analysis fails to give us 
insight into the relative turnout of another 
group regularly impacted by discriminatory 
voting laws: Native Americans. However, we 
do know from the National Congress of 
American Indians that registered voters in 
this group have a lower turnout rate than 
other racial groups and face unique difficul-
ties accessing the ballot box along with the 
ones faced by other nonwhite Americans. 
2008 BACKLASH VERSUS TODAY 
Like the backlash after high turnout in 
2008, we are now experiencing another wave 
of 
restrictive 
voting 
laws, 
along 
with 
Brnovich 
v. 
Democratic 
National 
Com-
mittee, another Supreme Court ruling that 
weakens the Voting Rights Act and will 
make challenging racially discriminatory 
voting laws even harder. This backlash, how-
ever, does not come on the heels of the nar-
rowest racial turnout gap in a generation. 
This time, it follows a racial turnout gap 
that remained steady and even grew for 
Black Americans. 
Across the United States, political orga-
nizers successfully mobilized communities of 
color in 2020. But the record-breaking overall 
turnout was not enough to close the racial 
turnout gap. And in the aftermath of the Su-
preme Court’s Brnovich decision in, the Vot-
ing Rights Act’s protections for racial mi-
norities are weaker than ever. It is impera-
tive to stop the new restrictive voting laws 
and provide tools to fight race discrimina-
tion in voting.

Executive Summary 
Since our founding, Americans have not 
enjoyed equal access to the ballot. Indeed, 
only a small fraction of the population cast 
ballots in the election elevating George 
Washington as our first president. Through-
out our history, the country has made 
strides forward, but that progress was nei-
ther linear nor uncontested, and access to 
the ballot remains unequal. Following nearly 
100 years of suppression and discrimination 
in the post-Civil War United States, and a 
decades-long fight for equality and access to 
the vote, on August 6, 1965, President Lyndon 
B. Johnson signed the Voting Rights Act of 
1965 into law. The purpose of the Voting 
Rights Act was to, ‘‘banish the blight of ra-
cial discrimination in voting.’’ And for near-
ly 50 years it served this purpose. 
However, in 2013, the Supreme Court un-
dercut a key provision of the Voting Rights 
Act in Shelby County v. Holder. In finding

changes without oversight, and with only the

election administration laws that dispropor-
tionately and discriminatorily impact mi-
nority voters. 
On July 1, 2021, the Supreme Court under-
mined the Voting Rights Act yet again in 
Brnovich v. DNC. Writing for the majority, 
Justice Samuel Alito weakened the protec-
tions Congress explicitly wrote into the stat-
ute in 1982 and reauthorized in 2006, and in-
stead set forth a new set of guideposts that 
will arguably make it harder to combat dis-
criminatory restrictions on voting. In her 
dissent, Justice Elena Kagan wrote, ‘‘the 
majority writes its own set of rules, limiting 
Section 2 from multiple directions. Wherever 
it can, the majority gives a cramped reading 
to broad language.’’ 
Time and again, in courtrooms across the 
country, it has been proven that racially po-
larized voting has existed at the ballot box 
since 1870, when the Fifteenth Amendment 
was ratified, and it persists today. Millions 
of Black, Latino, Asian American, Native 
American, and other minority voters have 
again become the targets of voter suppres-
sion. 
COMMITTEE ON HOUSE ADMINISTRATION AND 
SUBCOMMITTEE ON ELECTIONS 
The Committee on House Administration 
was established in 1947. Oversight of federal 
elections became one of the Committee’s 
chief tasks at its inception. After more than 
70 years, the Committee’s principal functions 
still include oversight of federal elections. 
Under Rule X of the Rules of the House, the 
Committee on House Administration has ju-
risdiction over ‘‘Election of the President, 
Vice President, Members, Senators, Dele-
gates, or the Resident Commissioner; . . . 
and federal elections generally.’’ Since its 
creation, the Committee on House Adminis-
tration has had a hand in shaping legislation 
that touches on any and all aspects of fed-
eral elections. 
In exercising those powers, throughout the 
116th 
and 
117th 
Congresses, 
the 
Sub-
committee on Elections of the Committee on 
House Administration has reviewed the state 
of voting in America, collecting thousands of 
pages of testimony and evidence—and the 
conclusion is clear: minority voters in Amer-
ica face ongoing discrimination in voting 
and barriers to the ballot box. 
In writing for the majority in Shelby 
County, Chief Justice John Roberts wrote 
that ‘‘[t]he Fifteenth Amendment is not de-
signed to punish for the past; its purpose is 
to ensure a better future.’’ Moreover, the 
Chief Justice wrote that Congress must craft 
a remedy that, ‘‘makes sense in light of cur-
rent conditions.’’ The Subcommittee endeav-
ored to learn and gather the most contem-
poraneous evidence available and to identify 
the voting and election administration prac-
tices that cause discriminatory harm to vot-
ers—that evidence is summarized in the re-
port that follows. 
To 
collect 
this 
evidence, 
the 
Sub-
committee on Elections held eight hearings 
and a listening session in the 116th Congress, 
calling more than 60 witnesses, gathering 
several thousand pages of written testimony, 
documents, and transcripts, and hearing 
hours of oral testimony. To begin the proc-
ess, the Subcommittee cast a broad reach, 
examining all manner of voting rights and 
election administration barriers. That proc-
ess resulted in a report detailing a wide 
range of issues in voting and election admin-
istration laws implemented by states in the 
years following the Shelby County decision. 
Building upon the record gathered during 
the prior Congress and continuing the collec-
tion of contemporaneous evidence to estab-
lish the state of ‘‘current conditions,’’ during 
the 117th Congress the Subcommittee em-
barked on a series of five investigatory hear-
ings. Under the Chairmanship of Congress-
man G. K. Butterfield (D–N.C.), the Sub-
committee identified those voting and elec-
tion administration practices that the Sub-
committee observed previously, including 
those which exhibited the most significant 
evidence of discriminatory impact, and in-
vestigated further. In doing so, the Sub-
committee determined that a number of spe-
cific practices warranted a more in-depth ex-
amination, specifically: (1) voter list mainte-
nance and discriminatory voter purges; (2) 
voter identification (‘‘voter ID’’) and docu-
mentary proof of citizenship requirements; 
(3) lack of access to multi-lingual voting ma-
terials and language assistance; (4) polling 
place closures, consolidations, reductions, 
and long wait times; (5) restrictions on addi-
tional opportunities to vote; and (6) changes 
to methods of election, jurisdictional bound-
aries, and redistricting. 
The Subcommittee heard hours of testi-
mony from more than 35 witnesses and col-
lected numerous reports and documents. The 
testimony and data show definitively that 
the voting and election administration prac-
tices examined can and do have a discrimina-
tory impact on minority voters and can im-
pede access to the vote. 
Key findings of the Subcommittee include: 
(1) Purging voters from voter rolls can dis-
proportionately flag for removal, mark as in-
active, or ultimately remove otherwise eligi-
ble minority voters from the rolls. Although 
voter list maintenance, when conducted cor-
rectly, is appropriate and necessary, mis-
conceived, overzealous list maintenance ef-
forts have erroneously sought to remove 
hundreds of thousands of properly registered 
voters and, in doing so, disproportionately 
burden minority voters. In the years fol-
lowing the Shelby decision, millions of vot-
ers have been removed from the voting 
rolls—and states once subject to the Voting 
Rights Act saw purges at a 40 percent higher 
rate than the rest of the country. As Sophia 
Lin Lakin of the ACLU testified before the 
Subcommittee: 
‘‘Some of these troubling purge practices 
are based on unreliable data and/or proce-
dures or dubious proxies that disproportion-
ately sweep in, and ultimately disenfran-
chise, voters of color. Oftentimes, such 
purges have occurred too close to an election 
to permit corrective action, with voters ar-
riving at the polls only to discover they have 
been removed from the rolls and unable to 
cast a ballot that will count.’’ 
For example, mailers initiating a Wis-
consin voter purge effort were disproportion-
ately sent to counties with disproportion-
ately large Black and Latino populations— 
over one-third of mailers were sent to areas 
that are home to the largest Black voting 
populations, while the Black voting popu-
lation comprises only 5.7 percent of the total 
electorate. Additionally, Dr. Marc Meredith 
of the University of Pennsylvania testified 
that research, ‘‘demonstrates that minority 
registrants are more likely than White reg-
istrants to be incorrectly identified as no 
longer eligible to vote at their address of 
registration.’’ 
(2) Voter identification and documentary 
proof-of-citizenship requirements dispropor-
tionately burden minority voters. Discrimi-
natory strict voter ID laws were some of the 
first voting laws implemented in the wake of 
Shelby County—in 2013, at least six states 
implemented or began to enforce strict voter 
ID laws, some of which had been previously 
blocked by the Department of Justice under 
Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act. Studies 
have consistently demonstrated that minor-
ity voters are disproportionately likely to 
lack the forms of ID required by voter ID 
laws and are disproportionately burdened by 
the time and expense of acquiring the under-
lying documents and IDs. The consequence is 
a negative impact on turnout amongst mi-
nority voters. A recent study found that 
Latinos, for example, are 10 percent less 
likely to turnout in general elections in 
states with strict ID laws than in states 
without such laws. Even when states offer 
‘‘free’’ IDs, the actual cost of obtaining a 
qualifying photo ID ranged from $75 to $368 
due to indirect costs associated with travel 
time, waiting time, and obtaining necessary 
supporting documentation. The documents 
required to establish proof-of-citizenship are 
also particularly expensive to obtain for nat-
uralized and derivative citizens, sometimes 
costing in excess of $1,000. 
The burden of these requirements dis-
proportionately fall on Black, Latino, Asian 
American, and Native American voters, and 
newly naturalized citizens. Recent studies 
have demonstrated that Black and Latino 
voters are less likely to have access to birth 
certificates and passports—documents often 
required to establish proof of citizenship— 
than White voters. For example, Asian 
Americans will face greater barriers to reg-
istration than White voters under proof-of- 
citizenship laws. As Terry Ao Minnis, Senior 
Director of Census and Voting Programs for 
Asian Americans Advancing Justice, testi-
fied, ‘‘76.7 [percent] of Asian American adults 
are foreign-born and 39.5 [percent] of Asian 
American adults have naturalized nation-
wide, compared to 4.6 [percent] of White 
adults who are foreign-born and 3.8 [percent] 
who have naturalized.’’ Numerous studies 
also have demonstrated that strict voter ID 
laws disproportionately decrease registra-
tion and turnout of minority voters relative 
to White voters. Dr. Nazita Lajevardi of the 
University of Michigan testified that, ‘‘strict 
voter identification laws are racially dis-
criminatory and have real consequences for 
impacting the racial makeup of the voting 
population.’’ 
(3) Access to multi-lingual voting mate-
rials and assistance is critical to ensuring 
equal access to the ballot—failure to do so 
can negatively impact millions of potential 
voters, a disproportionate number of whom 
are minority voters. The demographics of 
America are shifting, with millions of new 
Latino and Asian American voters, for exam-
ple, joining the rolls every election. The 
number of eligible Asian Americans grew by 
almost 150 percent from almost 5 million in 
2000 to over 11.5 million in 2020—this com-
pared to a growth rate of 24 percent for the 
total population over the same period. Fur-
thermore, 
American 
Community 
Survey 
(ACS) data estimate show that Latinos ac-
counted for just over half the nation’s popu-
lation growth between 2010 and 2019, and ACS 
data estimate shows that Latinos made up 
over 44 percent of the entire nation’s growth 
in citizen, voting-age population, between 
2009 and 2019. 
According to 2017 data, more than 85 per-
cent of the voters who likely require lan-
guage assistance in voting were voters of 
color. As of 2019, approximately 4.82 percent 
of the citizen voting-age population needs to 
cast a ballot in a language other than 
English. For example, over a quarter of all 
single-race American Indian and Alaska Na-
tives speak a language other than English at 
home, almost three out of every four Asian 
Americans speak a language other than 
English at home, and almost one in three 
Asian Americans has limited English pro-
ficiency. When limited-English proficient 
(LEP) voters are provided with voting mate-
rials in their native language the likelihood 
they will participate in the political process 
increases. Dr. Matt Barreto of the UCLA 
Latino Policy and Politics Initiative testi-
fied that studies have found, ‘‘between a 7 
and 11 point increase in voter turnout given

access to Spanish materials.’’ Conversely, 
failure to provide the proper non-English 
voting materials has, ‘‘a tremendously nega-
tive impact on those communities’ ability to 
understand and participate in our elections.’’ 
(4) Polling place closures, consolidations, 
reductions, and long wait times at the polls 
all disproportionately burden minority vot-
ers and can be implemented in a discrimina-
tory manner. Issues related to polling place 
locations, quality, accessibility, and the en-
suing long wait times to vote are pervasive. 
Over the past decade, it has been well docu-
mented that racial minorities wait longer to 
vote on election day than White voters. Ad-
ditionally, disparities in polling place acces-
sibility and wait times are compounded by 
the disparate impact of other discriminatory 
practices such as voter ID laws, voter purges, 
and cuts to alternative opportunities to 
vote. A lack of available polling place loca-
tions necessitates traveling long distances to 
vote, which also disproportionately burdens 
minority voters, in particular Native Amer-
ican voters. A 2019 report by The Leadership 
Education Fund found that between 2012 and 
2018 a total of 1,688 polling places had been 
closed in the previously covered jurisdictions 
examined, almost double the rate identified 
in 2016. Polling place closures and long wait 
times have been shown to reduce the likeli-
hood a voter will vote in a subsequent elec-
tion, decreasing turnout. Minority voters 
not only wait longer on average, but they are 
also more likely to experience wait times ex-
ceeding 60 minutes, a wait time largely rec-
ognized 
as 
unacceptable. 
Dr. 
Stephen 
Pettigrew of the University of Pennsylvania 
testified that, ‘‘[a] voter’s race is one of the 
strongest predictors of how long they wait in 
line to vote: non-white voters are three 
times more likely than White voters to wait 
longer than 30 minutes and six times as like-
ly to wait more than 60 minutes.’’ Addition-
ally, long lines negatively impact voters’ 
confidence in the electoral system. Dr. 
Pettigrew testified that, ‘‘[v]oters who wait 
in a long line are less likely to believe that 
their vote choices would be kept a secret, 
and less likely to be confident that their 
vote was counted correctly’’ and that, 
‘‘[b]ecause voters’ experiences at the polling 
place have downstream consequences on 
their future turnout behavior and their con-
fidence in the electoral system, policies that 
widen the wait time gap between White and 
non-white voters have the potential to put a 
thumb on the electoral scale by reshaping 
the electorate.’’ 
(5) Restricting access to opportunities to 
vote outside of traditional Election Day vot-
ing 
has 
a 
disproportionate 
and 
disenfranchising impact on minority voters. 
Early voting, and especially weekend early 
voting, is a critical tool to ensuring access 
to the ballot and reducing wait times at the 
polls. Specifically, Dr. Michael Herron of 
Dartmouth College testified that, ‘‘changes 
to early voting hours that reduce pre-Elec-
tion 
Day, 
Sunday 
voting 
opportunities 
should be expected to disproportionately af-
fect Black voters’’ and that, if a state were 
to eliminate Sunday early voting, ‘‘the cost 
of voting for Black voters would dispropor-
tionately increase compared to White voters 
given the relatively heavy use of Sunday 
early voting by Black voters.’’ However, per-
mitting early voting opportunities without 
providing 
meaningful 
access 
to 
them 
amounts to essentially no access. In dis-
cussing access for Native American voters, 
Professor Patty Ferguson-Bohnee, Director 
of the Indian Legal Clinic at the Sandra Day 
O’Connor College of Law testified that, 
‘‘[e]arly voting opportunities located hours 
away effectively amount to no access to in- 
person early voting in light of the practical 
effects of requiring voters to travel such dis-
tances.’’ Opportunities to vote such as in- 
person early voting, mail-in voting, curbside 
and drive-thru voting, or the ability to re-
turn a voted mail-in ballot at a drop box 
have all been used with increasing frequency 
by minority voters, making them a target 
for suppressive cutbacks and restrictions by 
state legislatures that will disproportion-
ately burden those same minority voters. 
(6) Changes to methods of election, juris-
dictional boundaries, and redistricting im-
pact whether voters can elect candidates 
that reflect their voices and communities. 
Discriminatory redistricting, vote dilution, 
changing of jurisdictional boundaries, and 
changes to methods of election have all been 
utilized throughout American elections— 
from local school board contests to Congres-
sional races—to dilute growing voting power 
in minority communities. The country is en-
tering the first redistricting cycle without 
the protections of the Voting Rights Act in 
more than a half century. According to a 
2018 U.S. Commission on Civil Rights report 
on minority voting rights access, ‘‘overall 
data show that there have been over 3,000 
changes submitted due to redistricting in 
every 10-year cycle since the 1965 VRA was 
enacted.’’ Without VRA protections, it can 
take years of expensive, time consuming liti-
gation to rectify these discriminatory prac-
tices, all while elections are conducted under 
district maps and voting structures that are 
later found to be unlawful. Evidence and tes-
timony presented to the Subcommittee 
clearly illustrated that these practices are 
enacted with discriminatory effect and in-
tent. 
Each of the chapters that follows details 
the evidence gathered by the Subcommittee 
on each of these practices—clearly dem-
onstrating the findings of the Subcommittee 
that each warrants a heightened level of 
scrutiny and attention from Congress to en-
sure every American has equal, equitable ac-
cess to the ballot. 
The increase in voter turnout in both the 
2018 and 2020 elections has not been met with 
celebration in statehouses across the coun-
try but has instead been met with backlash 
and false claims of fraud—claims that are 
being used to justify voter suppression and 
the passage of laws that will disenfranchise 
minority voters. Investigations have repeat-
edly found no evidence of widespread fraud in 
American elections. Fraud in American elec-
tions is vanishingly rare. A person is more 
likely to be struck by lightning than to com-
mit voter-impersonation fraud. Other anal-
yses found just 31 credible instances of im-
personation fraud from 2000 to 2014, out of 
more than one billion ballots cast. 
In 2021, our democracy is under attack. Ac-
cording to the Brennan Center for Justice, as 
of July 14, 2021, lawmakers had introduced 
more than 400 bills in 49 states to restrict the 
vote—at least four times the number of re-
strictive bills introduced just two years 
prior. To date, at least 18 states have en-
acted new laws containing provisions that 
restrict access to voting. 
June 2021 marked the eighth anniversary 
of the Shelby County decision. That decision 
unleashed a torrent of voter suppression 
bills, many in previously covered jurisdic-
tions, which continues today. Congress has 
the power—a power the U.S. Supreme Court 
has called ‘‘paramount’’ for 142 years—and 
duty to act. As detailed in this report, there 
is much work to be done. 
CHAPTER ONE—INTRODUCTION AND THE 
HISTORY OF DISCRIMINATION IN VOTING 
AMERICA’S LONG HISTORY OF DISCRIMINATING IN 
VOTING 
Since the Founding, Americans have not 
enjoyed equal access to the ballot. At her 
opening, the Declaration of Independence 
said 
‘‘all 
men 
are 
created 
equal’’—yet 
enslaved persons, indentured servants, Na-
tive Americans, and women were all denied 
the right to vote. 
The Thirteenth, Fourteenth, Fifteenth, 
Nineteenth, Twenty-third, Twenty-fourth, 
and Twenty-sixth Amendments all expanded 
access to the franchise not previously experi-
enced by millions of Americans despite the 
promise of equality. This expansion did not 
come without bitter divides and opposition. 
The Thirteenth, Fourteenth, and Fifteenth 
Amendments—known collectively as the Re-
construction Amendments—expanded access 
to the ballot for millions of Black Americans 
in the post-Civil War era, and gave Congress 
the power to enforce the rights granted in 
these Amendments through appropriate leg-
islation. 
Yet, while the immediate post-Civil War 
era brought about greater political represen-
tation for Black Americans, following the 
electoral crisis of 1876, former Confederates 
and their sympathizers seized control of 
southern state governments by brutally sup-
pressing Black voters and eliminating the 
power of the Reconstruction Republican 
Party. By the 1890s, suppression tactics led 
to most African Americans having either 
been barred from or abandoned electoral pol-
itics as violence and economic reprisals be-
came a constant threat to political partici-
pation and segregation was legalized. South-
ern legislators passed laws such as poll 
taxes, grandfather clauses, literacy tests, 
and felon disenfranchisement, with the ex-
plicit intent of removing Black voters from 
the rolls. 
Indeed, the same barriers existed for Na-
tive Americans. In 1884, the Supreme Court 
held in Elk v. Wilkins that the Fourteenth 
Amendment did not provide citizenship to 
Native Americans. Not until passage of the 
Indian Citizenship Act in 1924 did most Na-
tive Americans gain full citizenship and vot-
ing rights without undermining or negating 
their right to remain a member of their 
tribe. Despite passage of the Act and subse-
quent passage of the Nationality Act of 1940, 
many states continued to deny Native Amer-
icans equal access to the ballot, claiming 
they were ineligible to vote because they 
were not residents of that state. Not until 
1957 and 1958 did Utah and North Dakota, re-
spectively, become the last states to afford 
on-reservation Native Americans the right 
to vote. 
The 
Nineteenth 
Amendment 
granted 
women the right to vote when it was ratified 
in 1920. The Twenty-third Amendment al-
lowed residents of the District of Columbia 
to vote for President and Vice President 
(1961). The Twenty-fourth Amendment out-
lawed poll taxes or any other tax to vote 
(1964), and the Twenty-sixth Amendment 
lowered the voting age to 18 and banned the 
denial or abridgement of the vote based on 
age (1971). 
The U.S. government also systematically 
denied citizenship and voting rights to Asian 
Americans. Not until the repeal of the Chi-
nese Exclusion Act in 1943 and the passage of 
the McCarran-Walter Act in 1952 were all 
Asian Americans granted the right to be-
come citizens and therefore eligible to vote. 
A CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT TO VOTE 
To this day, scholars argue that the Con-
stitution does not guarantee the right to 
vote as a positive right—that the amend-
ments do not provide an affirmative grant 
but disallow the government from restrict-
ing the franchise based on protected cri-
teria—race, sex, paying a poll tax, and age. 
However, while the text of the Constitution 
does not explicitly provide for and protect 
the vote as a fundamental right, the Su-
preme Court has long recognized that voting 
is a fundamental right. 
Voting and equal, equitable access to the 
ballot are cornerstones of creating a true de-
mocracy. Justice Hugo Black, in Wesberry v. 
Sanders, stated that: 
‘‘No right is more precious in a free coun-
try than that of having a voice in the elec-
tion of those who make the laws under 
which, as good citizens, we must live. Other 
rights, even the most basic, are illusory if 
the right to vote is undermined.’’

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4462 
August 24, 2021 
Professor Guy-Uriel Charles of Duke Law 
School noted in his testimony before the 
Committee that, ‘‘since at least 1886, in Yick 
Wo v. Hopkins, the Supreme Court has recog-
nized that voting is a fundamental right of 
citizens and that its availability is critical 
to sustaining representative government.’’ 
In 1964, Chief Justice Earl Warren wrote, 
‘‘[t]he right to vote freely for the candidate 
of one’s choice is of the essence of a demo-
cratic society, and any restrictions on that 
right strike at the heart of the representa-
tive government.’’ More recently, Chief Jus-
tice John Roberts noted, ‘‘[t]here is no right 
more basic in our democracy than the right 
to participate in electing our political lead-
ers.’’ 
THE VOTING RIGHTS ACT, PRECEDENT, AND 
SHELBY COUNTY V. HOLDER 
Despite the protections from racial dis-
crimination in voting afforded in theory 
under the Reconstruction Amendments, for 
nearly 100 years after their passage, Black 
Americans 
were 
‘‘systematically 
disenfranchised by poll taxes, literacy tests, 
property requirements, threats, and lynch-
ing.’’ To address the systemic discrimination 
and barriers in voting, on August 6, 1965, 
President Lyndon B. Johnson signed the Vot-
ing Rights Act of 1965 into law. 
One of the pillars of the Civil Rights laws 
of the 1960s, the Voting Rights Act of 1965 
(‘‘VRA’’) was enacted to address election 
laws and practices that discriminated on the 
basis of race and ethnicity. In the decades 
following its enactment, the VRA went a 
long way to addressing the widespread racial 
discrimination in voting. The VRA was de-
signed to fight, ‘‘an insidious and pervasive 
evil which had been perpetuated in certain 
parts of our country through unremitting 
and ingenious defiance of the Constitution.’’ 
Prior to the passage of the VRA, when the 
U.S. Department of Justice obtained favor-
able decisions striking down suppressive, dis-
criminatory voting practices, states would 
merely enact new schemes to restrict access 
to the ballot for Black voters. 
The VRA placed a nationwide prohibition 
on states, or political subdivisions, from im-
plementing voting qualifications or pre-
requisites, standards, practices, or proce-
dures to, ‘‘deny or abridge the right of any 
citizen to vote on the basis of race or color.’’ 
Originally set to expire five years after en-
actment, the VRA was subsequently amend-
ed and extended by Congress on a bipartisan 
basis several times. Congress continued to 
support the underlying policy of the Voting 
Rights Act while voting to amend, expand, 
and extend the law five times: in 1970, 1975, 
1982, 1992, and 2006. 
Each time, the law was reauthorized with 
overwhelming, bipartisan support. Moreover, 
all of the multiple reauthorizations were 
signed into law by Republican Presidents. 
The 2006 reauthorization, the Fannie Lou 
Hamer, Rosa Parks, and Coretta Scott King 
Voting Rights Act Reauthorization and 
Amendments Act of 2006 passed the House of 
Representatives overwhelmingly following 
introduction by Representative James Sen-
senbrenner, Jr. (R–Wisc.), passed the Senate 
unanimously, and was signed into law by 
President George W. Bush. 
Since the VRA’s initial passage, and 
through the subsequent amendments and re-
authorizations, the Supreme Court repeat-
edly affirmed Congress’s authority to enact 
statutes that prohibit states and localities 
from imposing voting laws that inten-
tionally discriminate on the basis of race or 
ethnicity. In South Carolina v. Katzenbach, 
the Court held that the Voting Rights Act 
was, ‘‘a valid means for carrying out the 
commands of the Fifteenth Amendment.’’ 
The Court would later uphold the Voting 
Rights Act again in cases such as City of 
Rome v. United States (1980) and Lopez v. 
Monterey County (1999). Furthermore, the 
Court has long upheld Congress’s broad au-
thority under the Constitution to pass laws 
and regulations governing federal elections. 
The Supreme Court has long affirmed the 
breadth of Congress’s power to enact laws 
regulating elections. As Professor Guy-Uriel 
Charles noted in his testimony before the 
Committee, as early as 1880, the Supreme 
Court noted in Ex parte Siebold that 
Congress’s Elections Clause power to regu-
late Congressional elections, ‘‘may be exer-
cised as and when Congress sees fit to exer-
cise it,’’ and, ‘‘necessarily supersedes,’’ con-
flicting state regulations. Professor Charles 
further testified that, ‘‘[t]hus, although the 
Supreme Court has at times interpreted fed-
eralism as a constraint on Congressional 
power derived from the Fourteenth and Fif-
teenth Amendments, Congress’ power to reg-
ulate 
federal 
elections 
is 
uniquely 
unencumbered by federalism constraints.’’ 
Professor Franita Tolson of the University 
of Southern California Gould School of Law 
testified before the Committee that, despite 
the view by some that exercises of federal 
authority under the Elections Clause as a 
somewhat 
unwelcome 
intrusion 
on 
the 
states’ authority to legislate with respect to 
federal elections, ‘‘Congress can disregard 
state sovereignty in enacting and enforcing 
legislation passed pursuant to the Elections 
Clause.’’ Additionally, Professor Daniel P. 
Tokaji of the University of Wisconsin Law 
School testified that the Court’s, ‘‘most re-
cent—and arguably most important—expli-
cations,’’ of Congress’s power came in Ari-
zona v. ITCA, in which the Court noted that, 
‘‘the usual presumption against federal pre- 
emption of state law does not apply to legis-
lation enacted under the Elections Clause 
. . . While states historically enjoyed broad 
police powers over other matters, their regu-
lation of congressional elections has always 
been subject to congressional revision or re-
versal.’’ 
The Supreme Court has also long held that 
Congress’s power to enforce the Fourteenth 
and Fifteenth Amendments extends beyond 
intentional discrimination. In City of Rome 
v. United States, the Court considered a mu-
nicipality’s 
challenge 
to 
the 
constitu-
tionality of Section 5 of the VRA, to the ex-
tent that it authorized invalidation of a 
state or local election law based solely on 
evidence that the law had a discriminatory 
effect. The Court rejected the municipality’s 
constitutional 
challenge, 
holding 
that 
Congress’s power to enforce the Reconstruc-
tion Amendments extended beyond prohib-
iting intentionally discriminatory voting 
laws. The Court reasoned that Congress’s au-
thority 
to 
enforce 
the 
Reconstruction 
Amendments is coextensive with its author-
ity under the Necessary and Proper Clause, 
which empowers Congress to enact any law 
that is, ‘‘appropriate,’’ ‘‘adapted to carry out 
the objects,’’ of the Fourteenth or Fifteenth 
Amendment, and not prohibited by another 
provision in the Constitution. 
Applying that test, City of Rome made 
clear that, ‘‘under the Fifteenth Amend-
ment, Congress may prohibit voting prac-
tices that have only a discriminatory ef-
fect.’’ In particular, ‘‘under § 2 of the Fif-
teenth Amendment Congress may prohibit 
practices that in and of themselves do not 
violate § 1 of the Amendment [in that they 
are intentionally discriminatory], so long as 
the prohibitions attacking racial discrimina-
tion are ‘appropriate,’ as that term is defined 
in McCulloch v. Maryland and Ex parte Vir-
ginia.’’ 
Despite decades of precedent that uphold 
Congressional power and the VRA, in 2013, 
the Supreme Court struck down portions of 
the 2006 VRA reauthorization in Shelby 
County v. Holder (‘‘Shelby County’’ or 
‘‘Shelby’’), leaving American voters vulner-
able to tactics of suppression and discrimi-
nation. In its ruling, the Court struck down 
Section 4(b) as outdated and not ‘‘grounded 
in current conditions.’’ The Supreme Court 
ruled that Section 4(b)’s coverage formula 
violated implicit equal sovereignty prin-
ciples in the Constitution because it treated 
states differently—requiring certain states 
and localities, but not others, to obtain 
preclearance—but relied on sometimes dec-
ades old data to justify that differential 
treatment. 
The Court found the data upon which Con-
gress relied in reauthorizing the VRA—evi-
dence dating to the 1960s and 1970s of dif-
ferential registration rates between White 
and Black voters and the use of literacy 
tests to depress minority voting, for exam-
ple—to be insufficient to meet that standard, 
particularly in light of documented improve-
ments in minority voter registration rates 
and turnout. By invalidating the coverage 
formula, Shelby County essentially rendered 
Section 5 inoperable, allowing previously 
covered 
states 
and 
localities 
to 
make 
changes to their voting laws without seeking 
preclearance from the Department of Jus-
tice. 
At the same time the Court upended the 
VRA, Chief Justice Roberts conceded that 
discrimination in voting still exists, writing, 
‘‘[a]t the same time, voting discrimination 
still exists; no one doubts that.’’ Despite 
this, Chief Justice Roberts’ majority opinion 
declared that the data before the Court un-
dergirding the reauthorization of the VRA 
was outdated: 
‘‘The question is whether the Act’s ex-
traordinary measures, including its dis-
parate treatment of the States, continue to 
satisfy constitutional requirements. As we 
put it a short time ago, ‘‘the Act imposes 
current burdens and must be justified by cur-
rent needs.’’ 
The Chief Justice did, however, expressly 
suggest that Congress may remedy this and 
restore the effect of the preclearance regime 
by updating the coverage formula, providing 
a roadmap for Congressional action: 
‘‘Striking down an Act of Congress ‘is the 
gravest and most delicate duty that this 
Court is called on to perform.’ Blodgett v. 
Holden, 275 U. S. 142, 148 (1927) (Holmes, J., 
concurring). We do not do so lightly. That is 
why, in 2009, we took care to avoid ruling on 
the constitutionality of the Voting Rights 
Act when asked to do so, and instead re-
solved the case then before us on statutory 
grounds. But in issuing that decision, we ex-
pressed our broader concerns about the con-
stitutionality of the Act. Congress could 
have updated the coverage formula at that 
time, but did not do so. Its failure to act 
leaves us today with no choice but to declare 
§ 4(b) unconstitutional. The formula in that 
section can no longer be used as a basis for 
subjecting jurisdictions to preclearance.’’ 
‘‘Our decision in no way affects the perma-
nent, nationwide ban on racial discrimina-
tion in voting found in § 2. We issue no hold-
ing on § 5 itself, only on the coverage for-
mula. Congress may draft another formula 
based on current conditions. Such a formula 
is an initial prerequisite to a determination 
that exceptional conditions still exist justi-
fying such an ‘extraordinary departure from 
the traditional course of relations between 
the States and the Federal Government.’ 
Presley, 502 U.S., at 500–501. Our country has 
changed, and while any racial discrimination 
in voting is too much, Congress must ensure 
that the legislation it passes to remedy that 
problem speaks to current conditions.’’ 
Without the full protections of the VRA, 
states are free to implement discriminatory

voting laws without preemptive Justice De-
partment oversight. While Section 2 of the 
VRA remains an avenue for combatting dis-
criminatory voting laws in the courts, Sec-
tion 2 lawsuits are reactive, filed only after 
laws have been enacted, often take years and 
extensive resources to litigate, and all while 
elections may be conducted under restric-
tions later found to be unlawful. Prior to the 
Supreme Court’s decision in Shelby County, 
nine 
states 
were 
covered 
by 
statewide 
preclearance requirements under the VRA’s 
coverage formula in Section 4(b) and the 
preclearance 
regime 
of 
Section 
5. 
Preclearance required the states and local-
ities captured under the coverage formula to 
seek and receive administrative approval 
from the U.S. Department of Justice (‘‘DOJ’’ 
or ‘‘Justice Department’’) or judicial review 
by the U.S. District Court for the District of 
Columbia prior to making changes to their 
voting laws. At the time Shelby County was 
decided, Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, Georgia, 
Louisiana, 
Mississippi, 
South 
Carolina, 
Texas, and Virginia were the states covered 
as a whole. Additionally, counties in Cali-
fornia, Florida, New York, North Carolina, 
South Dakota, and townships in Michigan, 
were previously covered under Section 5 
though each state itself was not covered as a 
whole. Throughout the history of the VRA, 
counties have also ‘‘bailed out’’ of coverage— 
meaning they were once subject to the 
preclearance regime of Section 5, but suc-
cessfully obtained a declaratory judgment 
under Section 4 and thus were no longer sub-
ject to preclearance. 
Hours after Shelby County was decided, 
states moved to enact restrictive voting 
laws. Texas revived a previously blocked 
voter ID law. Within days, Alabama an-
nounced it would move to enforce a photo ID 
law it had previously refused to submit to 
the DOJ for preclearance. Within months, 
New York broke from past practices and de-
clined to hold special elections to fill 12 leg-
islative vacancies, denying representation to 
800,000 voters of color. 
Less than two months after the Supreme 
Court struck down the preclearance provi-
sions, North Carolina state legislators wast-
ed no time passing an omnibus ‘‘monster 
law.’’ State Senator Tom Apodaca (then- 
Chairman of the North Carolina Senate 
Rules Committee) said the State did not 
want the ‘‘legal headaches’’ of having to go 
through preclearance if it was not necessary 
to determine which portions of the proposal 
would be subject to federal scrutiny, ‘‘so, 
now we can go with the full bill,’’ he added. 
He predicted at the time that an omnibus 
voting bill would surface in the Senate the 
next week that could go beyond voter ID to 
include issues such as reducing early voting, 
eliminating Sunday voting, and barring 
same-day voter registration. 
This pattern continued, and in 2016, 14 
states had enacted new voting restrictions 
for the first time in a presidential election, 
including previously covered states such as 
Alabama, Arizona, Mississippi, South Caro-
lina, Texas, and Virginia. In 2017, two addi-
tional states, Arkansas and North Dakota, 
enacted voter ID laws. In 2018, Arkansas, In-
diana, Montana, New Hampshire, North 
Carolina, and Wisconsin enacted new restric-
tions on voting, ranging from restrictions on 
who can collect absentee ballots, to cuts to 
early voting, restrictions on college stu-
dents, and enshrining voter ID requirements 
in a state constitution. In 2019, Arizona, 
Florida, Indiana, Tennessee, and Texas en-
acted new restrictions. As of the end of 2019, 
the Brennan Center for Justice (‘‘Brennan 
Center’’) reported that, since 2010, 25 states 
had enacted new voting restrictions, includ-
ing strict photo ID requirements, early vot-
ing cutbacks, and registration restrictions. 
A new wave of voter suppression bills has 
emerged in the wake of the 2020 general elec-
tion, with restrictive voting bills being 
signed into law in at least 18 states at the 
time of this writing. 
Despite the Court’s decision, several key 
provisions of the VRA remain in place. For 
example, the language access requirements 
contained in Sections 4(e), 4(f)(4), 203, and 208 
remain intact. Section 2 is also a key en-
forcement mechanism for the DOJ and out-
side litigators to protect voting rights na-
tionwide. Section 2 of the VRA applies a na-
tionwide prohibition against the denial or 
abridgment of the right to vote on the basis 
of race or color and was later amended to in-
clude language minorities. 
Since the Shelby County decision invali-
dated the coverage formula for preclearance, 
voting rights groups, litigators, and the De-
partment of Justice are left to file lawsuits 
arguing 
that 
voting 
changes 
would 
discriminatorily reduce minority citizens’ 
ability to cast a ballot or elect candidates of 
their choice—a remedy that is in many ways 
inadequate to fully protect the right to vote. 
Voters and advocates are forced to reactively 
fight to protect the right to vote, rather 
than states and localities having to prove 
prior to implementation that their laws will 
not discriminate against protected classes of 
voters. 
On July 1, 2021, the Supreme Court held in 
Brnovich v. DNC that Arizona’s laws re-
stricting third-party ballot return and out- 
of-precinct voting were lawful and did not 
violate Section 2’s ban on discriminatory ef-
fect in voting, nor were they enacted with 
discriminatory purpose. In doing so, Justice 
Samuel Alito, writing for the majority, ar-
ticulated an entirely new standard for re-
viewing Section 2 vote denial claims, weak-
ening one of the last pillars of the VRA and 
fail-safes 
against 
discriminatory 
voting 
laws. Justice Alito held that, ‘‘the mere fact 
that there is some disparity in impact,’’ is 
now no longer dispositive, but rather, ‘‘the 
size of the disparity matters.’’ Further, Jus-
tice Alito provided that, ‘‘courts must con-
sider the opportunities provided by a State’s 
entire system of voting when assessing the 
burden imposed by a challenged provision’’— 
rather than evaluating the provision on its 
individual merits. Finally, Justice Alito 
went a step further, stating that, ‘‘preven-
tion of fraud’’ is a ‘‘strong and entirely le-
gitimate state interest,’’ even if there is no 
evidence of fraud having ever occurred, and 
that rules that are supported by strong state 
interests are, ‘‘less likely to violate’’ Section 
2. 
In writing for the dissent in Brnovich, Jus-
tice Elena Kagan admonished the majority 
for weakening a seminal statute and cre-
ating its own standard and set of guideposts 
where one did not exist in the statute. Jus-
tice Kagan stated: 
‘‘Today, the Court undermines Section 2 
and the right it provides. The majority fears 
that the statute Congress wrote is too ‘‘rad-
ical’’—that it will invalidate too many state 
voting laws. So the majority writes its own 
set of rules, limiting Section 2 from multiple 
directions. Wherever it can, the majority 
gives a cramped reading to broad language. 
And then it uses that reading to uphold two 
election laws from Arizona that discriminate 
against minority voters . . . What is tragic 
here is that the Court has (yet again) rewrit-
ten—in order to weaken—a statute that 
stands as a monument to America’s great-
ness, and protects against its basest im-
pulses.’’ 
Justice Kagan argued that the majority 
had strayed far from the text of Section 2 in 
its ruling, its analysis permitting, ‘‘exactly 
the kind of vote suppression that Section 2, 
by its terms, rules out of bounds.’’ 
THE SUBCOMMITTEE ON ELECTIONS INVESTIGA-
TION OF CURRENT DISCRIMINATION IN VOTING 
In exercising Congress’s authority and ju-
risdiction over federal elections, the Com-
mittee on House Administration (‘‘Com-
mittee’’) has broad jurisdiction under Rule X 
of the Rules of the House to oversee the ad-
ministration of federal elections. In exer-
cising that jurisdiction, Speaker of the 
House Nancy Pelosi (D–Calif.) and Com-
mittee Chair Zoe Lofgren (D–Calif.) reconsti-
tuted the Committee on House Administra-
tion’s Subcommittee on Elections (‘‘Sub-
committee’’) at the outset of the 116th Con-
gress. 
Subsequently, spanning the leadership of 
then-Subcommittee Chair Marcia L. Fudge 
(D–Ohio) and current Chair G. K. Butterfield 
(D–N.C.), the Subcommittee embarked dur-
ing the 116th and 117th Congresses to hold 
more than a dozen hearings to collect the 
contemporaneous evidence and data called 
for by Chief Justice Roberts and the Court’s 
majority in Shelby. 
In building upon investigatory hearings 
conducted in the 116th Congress, in the 117th 
Congress the Subcommittee identified the 
practices with what appeared to be the most 
abundant evidence of discriminatory impact 
on minority voters and endeavored to exam-
ine those practices in greater detail. 
Across the Subcommittee’s five hearings, 
the Subcommittee received testimony from 
more than 35 witnesses, gathering and exam-
ining evidence of ongoing discrimination in 
the election practices of: (1) voter list main-
tenance and voter purges; (2) voter identi-
fication and documentary proof-of-citizen-
ship laws; (3) lack of access to multi-lingual 
voting materials and assistance; (4) polling 
place closures, consolidations, relocations, 
and long wait times; (5) restrictions on op-
portunities to vote; and (6) changes to meth-
od of elections, jurisdictional boundaries, 
and redistricting. Furthermore, the Sub-
committee examined the state of voting 
rights enforcement and protection in the 
post-Shelby County era. 
The practices examined are perennial bar-
riers faced by voters. According to testimony 
from Marcia Johnson-Blanco of the Lawyers’ 
Committee for Civil Rights Under Law 
(‘‘Lawyers’’ Committee’’), during the 2020 
General Election cycle, the top issues raised 
through the organization’s nationwide, non- 
partisan voter protection program included, 
‘‘questions and concerns about mail-in and 
absentee ballots, as well as voter ID and reg-
istration . . . Election Day also brought 
calls of polling place accessibility issues, and 
concerning calls complaining of voter in-
timidation and electioneering.’’ The Sub-
committee’s lengthy proceedings and exam-
ination revealed that each of the practices 
identified impose significant, discriminatory 
burdens on minority voters. 
The evidence before the Subcommittee in-
cludes locality-and state-specific, as well as 
nationwide, studies demonstrating that the 
election practices examined impose a variety 
of discriminatory burdens, ranging from dis-
proportionately decreased registration and 
turnout among minority voters, dispropor-
tionately high costs to register and cast a 
ballot, 
disproportionately 
increased 
risk 
that a ballot will be thrown out, and a dis-
proportionate dilution of voting power. The 
record also includes extensive testimony 
from litigators and voting rights practi-
tioners who confront these discriminatory 
voting laws and practices on a regular and 
increasingly frequent basis in courtrooms, 
governmental proceedings, and on voting 
days.

August 24, 2021 
the Subcommittee, the expansion of the 
franchise has routinely been met with resist-
ance: 
‘‘We currently stand at an inflection point, 
but it is not unprecedented. The Fifteenth 
Amendment’s expansion of the right to vote 
was met with the creation of poll taxes and 
literacy tests. The rise of minority voting 
power after the Voting Rights Act was met 
with the expansion of at-large elections. The 
National Voter Registration Act (i.e., the 
Motor Voter Law) and the narrow margin of 
the 2000 presidential election were answered 
by a wave of spurious voter ID laws. Now, 
record voter turnout, despite a pandemic, is 
almost predictably sparking renewed efforts 
to make it even harder to vote.’’ 
While states have been enacting discrimi-
natory, restrictive voting laws in the years 
since Shelby County, that effort has signifi-
cantly increased in response to the largest 
voter turnout in 120 years experienced in the 
2020 General Election. 
According to the Brennan Center, as of 
July 14, 2021, lawmakers had introduced 
more than 400 bills in 49 states to restrict the 
vote. This is at least four times the number 
of restrictive bills introduced just two years 
prior, with at least 18 states having enacted 
new laws containing provisions that restrict 
access to voting. A Brennan Center report 
from May 2021 states that, ‘‘[t]he United 
States is on track to far exceed its most re-
cent period of significant voter suppression— 
2011. By October of that year, 19 restrictive 
laws were enacted in 14 states. This year, the 
country has already reached that level, and 
it’s only May.’’ 
Michael Waldman, President of the Bren-
nan Center for Justice, noted in his testi-
mony before the Subcommittee that these 
bills were introduced with the intention of 
rolling back voting rights, observing that, 
‘‘[c]rucially, these are not backbenchers 
tossing a bill in the hopper in the hope of 
getting a good day on Twitter.’’ Indeed, as of 
June 21, 2021, 17 states have enacted 28 new 
laws that restrict access to the vote. More-
over, Mr. Waldman testified that ‘‘[a]s in 
previous eras, these laws and proposals pur-
port to be racially neutral,’’ yet, ‘‘[i]n fact, 
often they precisely target voters of color.’’ 
Congress has a long history of exercising 
its legislative authority and constitutional 
powers to legislate to protect access to the 
franchise. In the eight years since Shelby 
County was decided, Congress has failed to 
act on what has historically been a bipar-
tisan endeavor—ensuring every American 
has an equal and equitable opportunity to 
cast a ballot and participate in democracy. 
As Justice Kagan notes in her dissent in 
Brnovich, ‘‘[i]ndeed, the problem of voting 
discrimination has become worse since that 
time—in part because of what this Court did 
in Shelby County. Weaken the Voting Rights 
Act, and predictable consequences follow: 
yet a further generation of voter suppression 
laws.’’ 
This report and the record compiled by the 
Subcommittee illustrate the urgent need for 
action. 
CHAPTER TWO—DISCRIMINATORY PRACTICES IN 
VOTING: AN OVERVIEW 
OVERVIEW 
Since the Supreme Court decided Shelby 
County v. Holder in 2013, states across the 
country have enacted voting laws and elec-
tion administration policies that restrict ac-
cess to the ballot in a discriminatory and 
suppressive manner, one that disproportion-
ately impacts minority voters. 
Over the last two Congresses, the Sub-
committee on Elections of the Committee on 
House Administration undertook an exten-
sive fact-finding series of hearings to study 
and understand the extent to which all vot-
ers across the United States have access to, 
or face barriers to, the ability to cast their 
ballot freely and fairly. Tellingly, with re-
spect to the voting and election administra-
tion 
practices 
examined 
by 
the 
Sub-
committee, the variety of sources examined, 
and testimony gathered all point to the same 
conclusion—the record demonstrates that 
the election administration laws and prac-
tices at issue disproportionately burden mi-
nority voters, denying many the free and 
equal access to the vote guaranteed by Fed-
eral law and the Constitution. 
During 
the 
116th 
Congress, 
the 
Sub-
committee cast a wide evidentiary net, ex-
amining all manner of election administra-
tion and voting laws to identify which, if 
any, practices discriminate against minority 
voters. In doing so, the Subcommittee held 
eight hearings and a listening session, called 
more than 60 witnesses, gathered several 
thousand pages of testimony, documents, 
and transcripts, and received hours of oral 
testimony. Throughout those hearings, the 
Subcommittee found extensive evidence of 
numerous practices that do, or have the po-
tential to, discriminate and suppress access 
to the ballot, culminating in a report re-
leased in November 2019 entitled Voting 
Rights and Election Administration in the 
United States of America. 
The barriers to voting faced by millions of 
Americans did not subside in the 2020 elec-
tion— in many instances they were, in fact, 
exacerbated. During the first six months of 
the 117th Congress, building upon the record 
built 
in 
the 
116th 
Congress, 
the 
Sub-
committee on Elections, under the leader-
ship of Chairman G. K. Butterfield (D–N.C.) 
identified a key subset of issues explored in 
the prior Congress that exhibited the most 
substantial evidence of disproportionate and 
discriminatory impact on voters, particu-
larly minority voters, for further, in-depth 
examination. 
Over the course of five hearings, the Sub-
committee conducted a substantive exam-
ination of the issues of: (1) discriminatory 
voter list maintenance practices and voter 
purges; (2) the discriminatory impact of 
voter ID and documentary proof-of-citizen-
ship requirements; (3) the ongoing lack of ac-
cess to multi-lingual voting materials and 
assistance; (4) the disparate impact of poll-
ing place closures, consolidations, reloca-
tions, and wait times at the polls; (5) restric-
tions on additional opportunities to vote; 
and (6) changes to methods of election, juris-
dictional boundaries, and redistricting. In 
concluding the evidence gathering process, 
the Subcommittee examined the national 
landscape of voting rights in America in the 
eight years since the Supreme Court struck 
down one of the key pillars of the VRA. 
Importantly, the evidence detailed in this 
report is ‘‘current,’’ as called for by Chief 
Justice Roberts and the Court’s majority in 
Shelby. This report examines a substantial 
body of evidence, the vast majority of which 
derives from elections and legislative ses-
sions conducted in the last 10 years, with 
much of the evidence relating to elections 
occurring 
within 
the 
years 
post-Shelby 
County. 
Over the course of testimony received from 
more than 35 witnesses and numerous hours 
of hearings, not only did the Subcommittee 
find substantial evidence that the election 
administration and voting practices exam-
ined throughout the hearings and in this re-
port have a discriminatory effect on minor-
ity voters, but Members also found substan-
tial evidence that there is a significant risk 
these discriminatory effects are the product 
of a discriminatory purpose. The extensive 
evidence recounted throughout this report, 
that the burdens of the election administra-
tion laws and practices, ‘‘bears more heavily 
on one race than another,’’ is illustrative of 
the laws’ and practices’ discriminatory pur-
pose. Additionally, as is noted in the discus-
sion of some voting laws and practices later 
in this report, courts have looked at whether 
voting is ‘‘racially polarized,’’ which pro-
vides a controlling party disfavored by mi-
nority voters with, ‘‘an incentive for inten-
tional discrimination in the regulation of 
elections’’ in determining when a practice is 
discriminatory and have found some of the 
practice examined by to Subcommittee to fit 
this set of circumstances. 
However, consistent with the Court’s ad-
monition 
that 
Congressional 
factfinders 
must consider a variety of facts and cir-
cumstances in determining whether a law 
had its genesis in its discriminatory purpose, 
the Subcommittee looked beyond evidence of 
solely discriminatory effect in finding that 
there is a high risk these laws and practices 
are attributable to a discriminatory purpose. 
The background and context of many of the 
laws were suggestive of a discriminatory 
purpose. Many were enacted in the imme-
diate or near aftermath of the Shelby Coun-
ty decision on party-line votes in previously 
covered 
jurisdictions 
with 
a 
well-docu-
mented history of racially polarized voting— 
others had already been rejected by the De-
partment of Justice under the Section 5 
preclearance regime. 
Further, public officials and election ad-
ministrators made troubling statements re-
garding some of the laws and practices at 
issue that bear the hallmarks of discrimina-
tory purpose. The Subcommittee also found 
evidence that some states and localities 
knew the laws would have discriminatory ef-
fects, but enacted them nevertheless, with-
out including safeguards to protect the in-
terests and rights of minority voters, as is il-
lustrated in some of the examples discussed 
throughout this report. Additionally, states 
and 
localities 
provided 
unsupported 
or 
pretextual race-neutral justifications for 
many of the laws and practices. Several of 
the laws and practices were enacted just as 
minority groups disproportionately burdened 
by the voting laws or practices were gaining 
political influence. 
The Subcommittee is not alone in finding 
that there is a significant risk that the laws 
and practices discussed in this report pose a 
high risk of being enacted for a discrimina-
tory purpose. Based on some of the evidence 
described above and throughout this report, 
courts have found several of these laws were 
enacted with discriminatory intent or other-
wise violated Federal law or the Constitu-
tion. 
Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act has 
proved a powerful, but inadequate tool for 
protecting the right to vote and access to 
the ballot in the post-Shelby era. Section 2 
authorizes private actors and the Depart-
ment of Justice to challenge discriminatory 
voting practices in the federal courts. As 
Janai Nelson, Associate Director-Counsel of 
the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational 
Fund, Inc. (‘‘NAACP Legal Defense Fund’’ or 
‘‘LDF’’) stated in testimony before the Sub-
committee: 
‘‘Section 2 applies nationwide and places 
the burden on voters harmed by voting dis-
crimination to bring litigation to challenge 
a law that has discriminatory results and/or 
discriminatory purpose. Section 2’s ‘perma-
nent, nationwide ban’ on racially discrimina-
tory dilution or denial of the right to vote is 
now the principal tool under the VRA to 
block and remedy these new discriminatory 
measures.’’ 
Ms. Nelson testified that, ‘‘there have been 
at least nine federal court decisions finding 
that states or localities enacted racially dis-
criminatory voting laws or practices inten-
tionally, for the purpose of discriminating

against Black voters, Latino voters, or other 
voters of color.’’ Ms. Nelson testified further 
that, ‘‘litigation is slow and costly—and 
court victories may come only after a voting 
law or practice has been in place for several 
election cycles.’’ The parties engaged in liti-
gation often spend millions of dollars liti-
gating these cases, they take up significant 
judicial resources, and the average length of 
Section 2 cases is two to five years. 
While court cases are ongoing, numerous 
elections for the Presidency, Congress, state, 
and local government seats may have come 
and gone. Thomas Saenz, President and Gen-
eral Counsel of the Mexican American Legal 
Defense and Educational Fund (‘‘MALDEF’’) 
stated in his testimony that, ‘‘[t]here is sim-
ply no way that non-profit voting rights liti-
gators, even supplemented by the work of a 
reinvigorated Department of Justice Civil 
Rights Division, could possibly prevent the 
implementation of all of the undue ballot-ac-
cess restrictions and redistricting violations 
that are likely to arise in the next two 
years.’’ 
The evidence is clear: lawsuits filed under 
Section 2 and other provisions of law and the 
Constitution cannot and do not substitute 
for proactive protections of voting rights and 
cannot serve as the sole vanguard against 
discriminatory voting and election adminis-
tration practices. Additionally, the Supreme 
Court’s recent decision in Brnovich v. DNC 
likely makes it harder for voting rights liti-
gators and the Department of Justice to pro-
tect the right to vote through Section 2 liti-
gation. 
The November 2020 general election saw 
record-setting voter turnout, with over 158 
million ballots cast and the highest turnout 
as a percent of the voting eligible population 
in 120 years. While some may cite recent 
voter registration and voter turnout num-
bers as alleged examples and evidence that 
the effects of Shelby have been minimal, 
those numbers alone do not tell the whole 
story. For example, Dr. Matt Barreto of the 
UCLA Latino Policy and Politics Initiative 
stated 
in 
testimony 
before 
the 
Sub-
committee that, ‘‘[s]ingular focus on turnout 
without centralizing the real impact of such 
burdens on access to the franchise is one-di-
mensional, operating within the subtext of 
racial power to reproduce the inequalities 
that demand the attention of political sci-
entists in the first place.’’ As the evidence 
before 
the 
Subcommittee 
clearly 
dem-
onstrates, record turnout, and voter turnout 
generally, does not discredit or discount the 
existence of barriers to accessing the fran-
chise. 
Additionally, state legislatures across the 
country have responded to the increase in 
voter participation not with more or sus-
tained access to the ballot, but with false 
claims of fraud, election irregularities, and 
perpetuation of the ‘‘Big Lie’’ that the 2020 
election was somehow rigged and stolen. The 
ongoing epidemic of misinformation and 
disinformation in our elections does not only 
polarize the electorate and fuel attempts to 
legislate voter suppression, but it also tar-
gets and suppresses minority votes. As Spen-
cer Overton, President of the Joint Center 
for Political and Economic Studies testified 
before 
the 
Subcommittee 
in 
2020, 
the 
disinformation targeted at Black voters, for 
example, on social media platforms in the 
2016 election cycle continued in the 2020 
cycle. Mr. Overton testified that both foreign 
and 
domestic 
actors, 
‘‘used 
online 
disinformation to target and suppress Black 
votes.’’ Additionally, a report from NPR in 
the final days of the 2020 election found that 
Black and Latino voters were flooded with 
disinformation in the final days of the 2020 
election with an unmistakable intent to de-
press turnout among minority voters. 
The spread of mis- and disinformation only 
continued with false claims of unlawful bal-
lots being cast and widespread fraud—much 
of which was alleged to be in areas where 
large numbers of ballots were cast by minor-
ity voters. These claims have all been re-
peatedly disproven, yet states are using 
them as false pretenses to push forward an 
onslaught of new voting laws designed to 
make it harder for voters to participate in 
future elections, laws that will dispropor-
tionately and discriminatorily impact the 
ability of minority voters to cast a ballot. 
As Wade Henderson, Interim President and 
CEO of the Leadership Conference on Civil 
and Human Rights (‘‘The Leadership Con-
ference’’) testified: 
‘‘The assault on our freedom to vote has 
only grown more dire. After historic turn-
out, politicians peddled lies, tried to dis-
count the votes of communities of color, and 
attempted to override the will of the people. 
. . . Now they have doubled down on at-
tempts to reshape the electorate for their 
own gain. . . . These restrictions dispropor-
tionately burden voters of color. They re-
semble the very strategies that led Congress 
to adopt the Voting Rights Act in the first 
place.’’ 
The evidence before the Subcommittee is 
conclusive—the practices discussed below, 
and the manner in which they are imple-
mented, are wielded with both discrimina-
tory intent and effect, unlawfully erecting 
barriers to the ballot for minority voters 
across the country. The voting discrimina-
tion acknowledged by Chief Justice Roberts 
in Shelby does still exist. It is the conclusion 
of the Subcommittee’s hearings and this re-
port that these practices warrant stricter 
protections to ensure every voter has unfet-
tered access to the ballot promised to them 
under the Constitution and Federal law. 
CHAPTER THREE—VOTER LIST MAINTENANCE 
PRACTICES AND THE PURGING OF ELIGIBLE 
VOTERS 
BACKGROUND 
Voter purging is often performed under the 
guise of routine voter list maintenance. 
Some argue that opponents of voter purges 
are preventing state and local election offi-
cials from preforming necessary, mandated 
list maintenance. Proponents of voter purg-
ing often raise the specter of deceased per-
sons or voters who have moved remaining on 
the rolls, of ‘‘bloated’’ voter rolls, or insid-
ious claims of non-citizens being on the rolls, 
leading to voter fraud. However, there is no 
credible evidence of widespread voter fraud 
in American elections. For example, a com-
prehensive analysis published by the Wash-
ington Post found only 31 credible instances 
of voter fraud between 2000 and 2014—out of 
one billion ballots cast. 
List maintenance is the law of the land 
and the process by which state and local gov-
ernments remove ineligible voters from their 
voting rolls. The National Voter Registra-
tion Act (‘‘NVRA’’), or ‘‘motor voter’’ law, is 
the principal federal statute governing state 
maintenance of voter registration rolls. The 
NVRA was signed into law on May 20, 1993, 
by President Bill Clinton, following decades 
of efforts to establish a national voter reg-
istration system to address low voter turn-
out and increase voter registration opportu-
nities that began soon after passage of the 
VRA in 1965. Enacted pursuant to Congress’s 
authority under the Elections Clause, the 
NVRA governs voter registration procedures 
for federal elections. Nevertheless, nearly all 
states use the NVRA-prescribed process for 
maintaining their voter rolls for both state 
and federal elections. 
In addition to establishing voter registra-
tion procedures, the NVRA provides that 
‘‘each State shall . . . conduct a general pro-
gram that makes a reasonable effort to re-
move the names of ineligible voters from the 
official lists of eligible voters by reason of— 
(A) the death of the registrant; or (B) a 
change 
in 
the 
residence 
of 
the 
reg-
istrant. . . .’’ The NVRA provides that any, 
‘‘program or activity to protect the integrity 
of the electoral process by ensuring the 
maintenance of an accurate and current 
voter roll for elections for Federal office’’ 
must meet two requirements. First, the pro-
gram or activity must be, ‘‘uniform, non-
discriminatory, and in compliance with the 
Voting Rights Act of 1965.’’ Second, the pro-
gram or activity must ‘‘not result in the re-
moval of any person from the official list of 
voters registered to vote in an election for 
Federal office by reason of the person’s fail-
ure to vote,’’ unless certain conditions are 
satisfied. 
The NVRA describes one form of ‘‘voter re-
moval program[ ]’’ that states may use to re-
move voters (referred to in the statute as 
‘‘registrants’’) who have moved to an address 
outside of a jurisdiction. In particular, states 
can use, ‘‘change-of-address information sup-
plied by the Postal Service . . . to identify 
registrants whose addresses might have 
changed.’’ A state may not remove a reg-
istrant from its voter rolls on grounds that 
the registrant has changed residence unless 
the registrant does one of two things: (1) 
confirms in writing that the registrant has 
changed residence to a place outside the ju-
risdiction or (2) it ‘‘appears’’ from informa-
tion provided by the Postal Service that the 
registrant has moved to a different address 
in a different jurisdiction and a ‘‘notice’’ 
procedure is used to ‘‘confirm’’ that the reg-
istrant has, in fact, changed address to a new 
jurisdiction. Under the notice procedure, a 
state must send a postage pre-paid and pre- 
addressed return card notifying the reg-
istrant of certain rights and obligations, and 
allowing a registrant to provide the state 
with the registrant’s current address. If a 
registrant fails to respond to the notice, the 
state may, but is not required to, remove the 
registrant only if the registrant fails to vote 
in two federal elections after the date of the 
notice. 
A second federal law governing state voter 
registration lists—the Help America Vote 
Act of 2002 (‘‘HAVA’’), passed in the wake of 
the 2000 Presidential election—mandates the 
creation of statewide voter registration 
databases for all elections to federal office 
that include the ‘‘name and registration in-
formation of every legally registered voter 
in the State.’’ HAVA requires that the data-
base be created and maintained in a ‘‘uni-
form and nondiscriminatory manner.’’ HAVA 
requires that state or local officials perform 
‘‘list maintenance’’ on a ‘‘regular basis’’ in 
accordance with the provisions in the NVRA. 
For the purposes of identifying felons and de-
ceased individuals subject to removal, HAVA 
requires that the state coordinate with state 
agencies maintaining records on felony sta-
tus and death. 
HAVA further requires that states imple-
ment, consistent with NVRA, systems ‘‘of 
file maintenance that make[] a reasonable 
effort to remove registrants who are ineli-
gible to vote from the official list of eligible 
voters,’’ under which ‘‘registrants who have 
not responded to a notice and who have not 
voted in 2 consecutive general elections for 
Federal office shall be removed from the offi-
cial list of eligible voters, except that no 
registrant may be removed solely by reason 
of a failure to vote.’’ 
When done improperly, voter list mainte-
nance and voter purges disenfranchise other-
wise eligible voters, use unreliable practices 
and data that disproportionately sweep in, 
and ultimately disenfranchise minority vot-
ers, often occurring too close to an election

for a voter to correct the error if registra-
tion deadlines have passed. Practices of 
voter purging have raised serious concerns in 
recent years. 
THE
DISPROPORTIONATE
AND
DISCRIMINATORY 
BURDEN AND IMPACT OF LIST MAINTENANCE 
PRACTICES ON MINORITY VOTERS 
Evidence received by the Subcommittee 
demonstrates that misconceived voter list 
maintenance efforts have erroneously sought 
to remove hundreds of thousands of properly 
registered voters and, in doing so, dispropor-
tionately burdened minority voters. 
Following the Shelby County decision, sev-
eral states, including those previously cov-
ered by Section 5 preclearance, have re-
moved millions of registered voters from 
their voter rolls. As Michael Waldman, 
President of the Brennan Center for Justice, 
stated in his testimony before the Sub-
committee, ‘‘abusive purges can remove duly 
registered 
citizens, 
often 
without 
their 
knowledge.’’ Mr. Waldman further testified 
that, ‘‘purges have surged in states once sub-
ject to federal oversight under the VRA . . . 
states once covered by Section 5 saw purges 
at a 40 percent higher rate than the rest of 
the country.’’ 
The Brennan Center reports that more 
than 17 million voters were removed from 
the rolls nationwide between 2016 and 2018. In 
testimony during the 116th Congress, Mr. 
Waldman noted that the purge rate outpaced 
growth in voter registration (18 percent) or 
population (6 percent) and that the Brennan 
Center had calculated that two million fewer 
voters would have been purged between 2012 
and 2016 if jurisdictions previously covered 
by Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act had 
purged their voter rolls at the same rate as 
other non-covered jurisdictions. Kevin Mor-
ris, Researcher with the Brennan Center, 
stated in his testimony before the Sub-
committee that: 
‘‘Put differently, this means that the end 
of the preclearance condition did not result 
in a one-time ‘catch-up’ of voter list mainte-
nance, but rather ushered in a new era in 
which the voter list maintenance practices 
of formerly covered jurisdictions were sub-
stantially more aggressive than other demo-
graphically-similar jurisdictions that were 
not covered under the VRA. . . . Simply put, 
Shelby County allowed and effected in-
creased voter purges in counties with dem-
onstrated histories of racially discrimina-
tory voting rules.’’ 
In several recent cases, states were found 
to have improperly sought to remove prop-
erly registered voters. For example, after the 
State of Wisconsin identified 341,855 reg-
istrants as potentially subject to removal on 
the basis of having moved, thousands of indi-
viduals showed up to vote in the following 
election at their address of registration, in-
dicating that Wisconsin had improperly 
flagged such registrants as likely movers. 
Joshua Kaul, Attorney General for the State 
of Wisconsin testified that, of the voters ini-
tially listed on the ‘‘movers report,’’ over 
6,000 voters responded to the postcards sent 
out to the potential ‘‘movers’’ and therefore 
kept their registration active, however, 
many more were erroneously deactivated 
and left off the poll book even though they 
had not moved. Attorney General Kaul fur-
ther testified that, during the 2018 Spring 
Primary, Wisconsin Elections Commission 
staff reported that, ‘‘while available data 
from the DMV implied many had moved, 
some of the voters, in fact, had not moved,’’ 
and that ‘‘[o]verall, 12,133 [voters] were 
proactively reactivated by staff or were 
stopped from being deactivated due to these 
data discrepancies.’’ A study of Wisconsin’s 
process found that at least four percent of 
the registrants who were identified as poten-
tial movers and who did not respond to a 
subsequent postcard cast a ballot at their ad-
dress of registration, with minority reg-
istrants twice as likely as white registrants 
to do so. 
The State of Arkansas moved to purge 
nearly 8,000 voters from the rolls on grounds 
that they were ineligible to vote due to a fel-
ony conviction—in Arkansas, those who have 
been convicted of a felony lose their right to 
vote until their sentence is completed or 
they are pardoned. In actuality, however, the 
list included a high percentage of voters who 
were indeed eligible and, in fact, some had 
never been convicted of a felony or had had 
their voting rights restored. 
Thomas Saenz of MALDEF noted in his 
testimony before the Subcommittee that, 
‘‘MALDEF and others also had to challenge 
an attempt to purge thousands of natural-
ized Texans, who were targeted through 
Motor Vehicles data that the state knew 
were outdated and would not reflect recent 
naturalizations.’’ Texas erroneously tried to 
remove tens of thousands of voters on 
grounds that they were non-citizens. Evi-
dence subsequently showed that virtually all 
the registrants targeted by the effort were, 
in fact, citizens eligible to vote. 
Additionally, an analysis conducted by a 
non-partisan group found that, of the more 
than 300,000 registrants Georgia purged in 
2019 for having changed residence, 63.3 per-
cent still lived at the residence identified on 
the voter registration. The analysis found 
the 
Georgia 
erroneously 
purged 
nearly 
200,000 voters from its rolls. 
In many cases, the percentage of voters 
from racial or language minority groups sub-
ject to removal under these recent, large- 
scale, and often errant, voter roll purge ef-
forts exceeded such groups’ representation in 
the overall population. For example, in 2012 
the State of Florida created a list of 182,000 
registrants potentially subject to purge on 
the grounds that the registrants were non- 
citizens. The percentage of registrants in-
cluded in the list that were Hispanic (61 per-
cent) substantially exceeded the percentage 
of Hispanics in Florida’s overall population 
(16 percent). Litigation in the case of Mi 
Familia Vota Education Fund v. Detzner 
showed that this change should have been 
submitted for preclearance as a statewide 
change impacting formerly covered counties 
in Florida under Section 5. NAACP LDF’s 
Democracy Diminished report noted that a 
2018 report found that since 2016, Florida has 
purged more than seven percent of voters. 
Likewise, mailers initiating the Wisconsin 
voter purge effort were disproportionately 
sent to counties with disproportionately 
large Black and Latino populations. Accord-
ing to Demos, while the Black voting popu-
lation comprises only 5.7 percent of Wiscon-
sin’s total electorate, ‘‘the highest con-
centrations of 2019 ERIC mailers were sent to 
areas that are home to the largest Black vot-
ing population in Wisconsin.’’ Demos re-
ported that over one-third of the mailers 
sent to voters on the 2019 ERIC list went to 
the two counties where the vast majority of 
Wisconsin’s Black voters reside—Milwaukee 
and Dane—two counties that are home to 
three quarters of Wisconsin’s Black voters. 
A 2016 analysis of an Ohio removal effort 
found that the effort disproportionately re-
moved voters in in-town African American 
neighborhoods relative to predominantly 
white suburbs—‘‘in predominantly African 
American neighborhoods around Cincinnati, 
10 percent of registered voters had been re-
moved due to inactivity in 2012, compared to 
just 4 percent in the suburban Indian Hill.’’ 
And a purge of registrants in Brooklyn, New 
York, removed 14 percent of voters in His-
panic-majority districts compared to 9 per-
cent of voters in other districts. 
Several approaches states have taken to 
culling voter rolls have been shown to dis-
proportionately remove properly registered 
minority voters. To begin, a number of 
states, including Florida, Georgia, Iowa, 
Minnesota, 
Tennessee, 
and 
Texas, 
have 
sought to remove registrants on the basis 
that they were non-citizens, often using 
state and federal databases that can contain 
inaccurate information. To identify non-cit-
izen registrants, for example, Florida used 
its Department of Motor Vehicles (‘‘DMV’’) 
and 
the 
federal 
Systematic 
Alien 
Verification 
for 
Entitlements 
(‘‘SAVE’’) 
databases and sought to match citizenship 
information in those databases with its vot-
ing rolls. 
As explained in the Subcommittee’s prior 
report, the SAVE database is used at times 
to verify immigration status when an indi-
vidual interacts with a state—however, 
SAVE does not include a comprehensive and 
definitive listing of U.S. citizens and states 
have been cautioned against using it to 
check eligibility. Drivers’ license databases 
have also proven to be inaccurate for 
verifying voter registration lists. 
According to the U.S. Commission on Civil 
Rights’ (‘‘USCCR’’) 2018 report, the list of 
182,000 registrants was created by comparing 
the voting rolls to drivers’ license databases, 
‘‘which is an extremely faulty method as 
drivers’ license databases do not reflect citi-
zenship,’’ and was then cut back to approxi-
mately 2,600. Because, among other reasons, 
DMV records and SAVE databases are not 
generally updated to remove subsequently 
naturalized individuals, Florida’s reliance on 
those databases to identify voters subject to 
being purged erroneously identified numer-
ous registrants as non-citizens, the vast ma-
jority of whom were Latino, Hispanic, or 
Black. For example, of the 1,572 individuals 
that were notified by Miami-Dade County 
that they were potentially subject to purge 
as identified non-citizens, 98 percent of the 
respondents (549 out of 562) provided evidence 
that they were citizens and eligible to vote. 
Similarly, Texas used DMV records to try 
to identify non-citizens to remove from its 
voting rolls. Texas officials initially claimed 
that the DMV matching effort identified 
95,000 non-citizens as registered to vote 
(58,000 of whom had voted in the previous 
election). However, because the DMV data 
did not account for subsequently naturalized 
citizens, the effort erroneously flagged thou-
sands of individuals who were lawfully reg-
istered to vote. In Harris County, Texas, 
alone, approximately 60 percent of the voters 
flagged for removal produced evidence con-
firming their citizenship and entitlement to 
vote. 
An audit of a sample of the remaining reg-
istrants identified by the DMV database 
matching effort as ‘‘non-citizens’’ yielded no 
non-citizens. Because over 87 percent of 
Texas’ 
naturalized 
citizens 
are 
Black, 
Latino, or Asian, these falsely identified 
non-citizens were overwhelmingly minority 
voters. Sonja Diaz, Founding Executive Di-
rector of the Latino Policy and Politics Ini-
tiative at the University of California, Los 
Angeles (‘‘UCLA LPPI’’) notes in her testi-
mony that, ‘‘[t]he disingenuous targeting of 
naturalized voters was not unique to Texas, 
but also found in 16 states where inaccurate 
immigration data identified and purged 
rightfully registered Latino voters.’’ 
The NAACP Legal Defense Fund’s report 
Democracy Diminished noted an additional 
example of attempts to wrongfully or inac-
curately purge voters from the voting rolls, 
such as in Alabama when, in 2012, parties en-
tered into a partial consent agreement to re-
solve issues under Section 5 of the VRA and 
blocked the City of Evergreen from con-
tinuing to implement an un-precleared dis-
criminatory voter purge based on utility

August 24, 2021 
records that omitted eligible voters from a 
voter registration list, ‘‘including nearly 
half of the Conecuh County registered voters 
who reside in districts heavily populated by 
Black people.’’ 
Additionally, several states have relied, or 
tried to rely, on multi-state databases— 
Interstate Voter Registration Crosscheck 
(‘‘Crosscheck’’) and Electronic Registration 
Information Center (‘‘ERIC’’)—to identify 
registrants who allegedly moved to a dif-
ferent state, and therefore were allegedly 
subject to removal. 
Crosscheck, a joint venture of as many as 
29 states, was created by former Kansas Sec-
retary of State Kris Kobach to identify vot-
ers registered in more than one state. The 
Crosscheck program sought to do so by com-
paring voter registration lists from partici-
pating states and flagging all records that 
have the same first and last name, and date 
of birth. 
Quantitative studies have shown that 
Crosscheck is an unreliable basis for identi-
fying voters registered in multiple jurisdic-
tions because of the small number of data 
points it uses to identify ‘‘duplicate’’ reg-
istrations—many people share the same first 
and last name and the same birthday. In 
other words, ‘‘a substantial share of the pair-
ings returned to states by Crosscheck [as du-
plicate registrations] represented cases in 
which two different registrants shared the 
same first name, last name, and date of birth 
instead of the same person being registered 
in to vote in two different states.’’ 
The states which used Crosscheck to iden-
tify duplicate registrants should have known 
this—Crosscheck’s, ‘‘user manual specifi-
cally states that ‘a significant number of ap-
parent double votes are false positives and 
not 
double 
votes.’ ’’ 
The 
accuracy 
of 
Crosscheck was also undermined by its use of 
unreliable registration dates and other data 
entry errors. Sophia Lin Lakin, Deputy Di-
rector of the Voting Rights Project at the 
American Civil Liberties Union (‘‘ACLU’’) 
notes in her testimony that: 
‘‘A study by a team of researchers at Stan-
ford, Harvard, the University of Pennsyl-
vania, 
and 
Microsoft 
found 
that 
using 
Crosscheck to purge the voter rolls in one 
state, ‘‘could impede approximately 300 le-
gitimate votes for each double vote pre-
vented.’’ In other words, the system incor-
rectly flags people as potential double voters 
(‘‘matches’’) more than 99% of the time be-
cause of false positives resulting from poor 
matching protocols.’’ 
Crosscheck’s high error rate and heavy re-
liance on first and last names to identify du-
plicate registrants increases the likelihood 
that properly registered minority voters are 
subject to removal proceedings at a higher 
rate than properly registered white voters. 
As 
Ms. 
Lakin 
explained 
to 
the 
Sub-
committee: 
‘‘Among some minority populations, first- 
name naming conventions are more com-
monly used, and many individuals born 
around the same historical periods are given 
the same name. Many often share the same 
or similar last names. Latinx voters, for ex-
ample, are more likely than white voters to 
have one of the most common 100 surnames 
in the country. Indeed, existing studies show 
that incorrect matches using such a method-
ology are disproportionately concentrated 
among minority voters. Crosscheck flagged 
one in six Latinx Americans, one in seven 
Asian Americans, and one in nine African 
Americans as potential double registrants.’’ 
Several states have aggressively sought to 
purge voters using data they knew or should 
have known would errantly lead to the re-
moval of properly registered voters. For ex-
ample, an election official in Kansas—the 
State 
that 
created 
and 
managed 
Crosscheck—contemporaneously 
admitted 
that most of the ‘‘duplicate’’ registrations 
identified by Crosscheck were not the result 
of fraud, but instead reflected data entry er-
rors, writing in an email disclosed in litiga-
tion that, ‘‘[i]n the majority of cases of ap-
parent double votes, in the end they do not 
turn out to be real double votes due to poll 
worker errors, mis-assignment of voter his-
tory, voters signing the wrong lines in poll 
books, etc.’’ 
Other states participating in Crosscheck 
were also aware of its high error rate. A 2013 
report by the Virginia State Board of Elec-
tions, for example, found that, after con-
ducting ‘‘quality control for verifying . . . 
data matches . . . only 57,000 of the 308,579’’ 
registrations identified by Crosscheck as 
‘‘duplicates’’ in fact warranted initiation of 
cancellation efforts, meaning that Virginia 
independently determined that Crosscheck’s 
error rate likely exceeded 75 percent. 
Likewise, Indiana twice used database 
records to purge ‘‘duplicate’’ registrants 
from its voting rolls, and in doing so failed 
to comply with the NVRA. Indiana’s first 
voter 
purge 
effort 
used 
data 
from 
Crosscheck—which, as explained above, is 
known to include numerous errors and dis-
proportionately identify minority voters as 
having moved—to purge voters without pro-
viding affected registrants notice of the re-
moval efforts. Empirical evidence presented 
to the district court revealed that ‘‘Indiana’s 
use of Crosscheck data likely triggered list- 
maintenance against thousands of eligible 
registrants who continued to reside at their 
address of registration, but who had the mis-
fortune of sharing the same first name, last 
name, and date of birth of a registrant in an-
other Crosscheck member state.’’ 
The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh 
Circuit held that Indiana’s voter purge pro-
gram violated the NVRA by removing voters 
who were suspected of changing residence 
without adhering to the NVRA’s notice re-
quirements. Notwithstanding that its pre-
vious purge effort had been found to be un-
lawful, Indiana embarked on a second voter 
purge effort using a proprietary database 
that a federal court found was, ‘‘functionally 
identical to Crosscheck.’’ The district court 
again concluded that the renewed voter roll 
purge effort violated the NVRA for the same 
reason—Indiana was seeking to purge voters 
using database information without adhering 
to the NVRA’s notice-and-waiting procedure. 
Crosscheck is no longer a widely used sys-
tem amongst states because of its abuses and 
inaccuracies. Ms. Lakin testified that the 
system has been on hold since a 2019 settle-
ment in a case brought by the ACLU of Kan-
sas, ‘‘on behalf of 945 voters whose partial 
Social Security numbers were exposed by 
Florida officials through a public records re-
quest’’ and it has not been used since, ‘‘a 
Homeland Security audit discovered security 
vulnerabilities in 2017.’’ The failures and 
abuses of Crosscheck demonstrate how list 
maintenance processes and databases can be 
abused and lead to erroneous and dispropor-
tionate purging of minority voters from the 
voting rolls. 
ERIC is another voter list maintenance 
tool which is used by 30 states and the Dis-
trict of Columbia to maintain their voter 
rolls. Whereas Crosscheck used just two 
datapoints to identify ‘‘duplicate’’ registra-
tions, ERIC uses more information to iden-
tify duplicates, including DMV information 
and Postal Service change of address data. 
The 31 jurisdictions participating in ERIC 
have agreed to send postcards to registrants 
flagged by ERIC as duplicates to confirm 
their registrations, the first step in remov-
ing such registrants from voting rolls. 
Though ERIC is generally viewed as more 
reliable than Crosscheck, it too has room for 
improvement and can disproportionately im-
pact minority voters. As first noted above, a 
2021 study of Wisconsin registrants flagged 
by ERIC as potentially subject to removal 
based on a change of address found that ap-
proximately four percent of the voters 
flagged as having moved subsequently voted 
at their address of registration, meaning 
that for every 29 registrations ERIC identi-
fied as having moved, at least ‘‘one reg-
istrant continued to reside at their address 
of registration and used that address to cast 
a ballot’’ in the next election. 
Notably, the study found that registrants 
who were Black and Hispanic were signifi-
cantly more likely to be falsely identified by 
ERIC as having moved than White reg-
istrants, meaning that, ‘‘the lower bound on 
the false mover error rate is more than 100% 
larger for minorities than for whites.’’ In 
other words, the study found that ERIC erro-
neously identified Black and Hispanic voters 
as subject to removal at twice the rate at 
which it erroneously identified White voters 
as subject to removal. The authors identified 
minority registrants’ disproportionate like-
lihood of living in a multi-unit or larger 
household dwellings (and, therefore, a likely 
relatively more frequent rate of change of 
residence within a single jurisdiction) as 
likely causes for their erroneous identifica-
tion as subject to purge. 
Summarizing the literature on the use of 
databases to identify duplicate registrants, 
Dr. Marc Meredith of the University of Penn-
sylvania—who has published papers ana-
lyzing both Crosscheck and ERIC—testified 
that research ‘‘demonstrates that minority 
registrants are more likely than White reg-
istrants to be incorrectly identified as no 
longer eligible to vote at their address of 
registration.’’ Given that the majority of 
states use databases like Crosscheck and 
ERIC to identify voters for removal, the dis-
criminatory burdens imposed by use of the 
databases extend throughout much of the 
United States. 
Ms. Lakin also provided testimony to the 
Subcommittee on the dangers of ‘‘mass voter 
challenges.’’ According to her testimony, 
state ‘‘challenger laws’’—laws that allow pri-
vate citizens to challenge the eligibility of 
prospective voters on or before Election 
Day—have also been used to remove voters 
from the rolls en masse. These laws have 
been used to target voters along race, class, 
and disability lines. As Ms. Lakin explains, 
‘‘[m]ass challenges are tantamount to a sys-
temic purge, but can be exploited to avoid 
federal rules governing purge programs, such 
as the prohibition of systemic removals of 
voter registrations within 90 days of a fed-
eral general election’’ and can deprive or at-
tempt to deprive thousands of their voting 
rights. 
Furthermore, a 2020 report published by 
the 
Native 
American 
Rights 
Fund 
(‘‘NARF’’), Obstacles at Every Turn: Barriers 
to Political Participation Faced by Native 
American Voters, highlighted the impact 
voter purges have on Native American vot-
ers. The NARF report details how the non- 
traditional addresses many Native voters 
have, or failure to accept a P.O. Box and an 
applicant’s drawing on the voter registration 
form, can result in them being purged from 
the voter rolls. Under the NVRA, election of-
ficials cannot deny a voter’s registration or 
purge an existing application because the ap-
plicant uses a non-traditional address or 
must be identified by landmarks or geo-
graphic features. 
Additionally, failing to provide language 
assistance and information about voter 
purges in the covered Native language, as 
provided for under Section 203 of the VRA, 
can 
negatively 
impact 
Native 
language 
speaking voters. Wrongful purges can impact

Native voters for many subsequent elections. 
According to NARF’s report: 
‘‘Once purged, many Native voters will not 
vote again in non-Tribal elections. Effec-
tively, a voter purge can result in permanent 
disenfranchisement. Far too often, that is 
precisely what election officials intend to ac-
complish in Indian Country.’’ 
The various processes by which voters are 
removed from the rolls can be and is abused, 
resulting in numerous cases in which other-
wise eligible voters were erroneously re-
moved from the voting rolls. The data gather 
by the Subcommittee illustrates the dis-
proportionate and discriminatory impact 
borne by minority voters. 
This record also demonstrates minority 
voters face a significant risk of being dis-
proportionately burdened through voter roll 
purges which are attributable to discrimina-
tory intent. The facts and circumstances 
surrounding several state and local voter list 
maintenance efforts and voter purges dem-
onstrate that there is a high risk that the 
demonstrated, disproportionate burdens on 
minority voters of such efforts are a product 
of discriminatory intent. 
First, 
the 
‘‘historical 
background’’ 
of 
many of these widespread voter purge efforts 
raises concerns about intentional discrimi-
nation. Several analyses have found that ju-
risdictions previously covered by Section 5 of 
the VRA—states that had a history of engag-
ing in intentional discrimination against mi-
nority voters—removed voters from their 
rolls at a faster rate than jurisdictions that 
had not been previously covered by Section 
5. As noted in the discussion above, the Bren-
nan Center found that jurisdictions pre-
viously covered by Section 5 would have re-
moved two million fewer voters during the 
2012 to 2016 period had they removed reg-
istrants at the same rate as jurisdictions not 
previously subject to preclearance; they re-
moved voters at a significantly higher rate 
than previously non-covered jurisdictions. 
Similarly, a 2020 nationwide study by two 
researchers at Columbia University’s Bar-
nard College found post-Shelby County in-
creases in purge rates of between 1.5 and 4.5 
points in jurisdictions formerly covered by 
Section 5 compared to jurisdictions that had 
never been covered. In several of these pre-
viously covered states, the rate at which vot-
ers cast provisional ballots increased after 
the voter purges, suggesting that voters were 
improperly purged. 
The Subcommittee further found that sev-
eral state efforts to remove alleged ‘‘non- 
citizens’’ from their voting rolls involved 
statements made by elected officials reveal-
ing of discriminatory intent. When Texas 
errantly used DMV records to identify ‘‘non- 
citizen’’ registrants, the Attorney General of 
Texas sent the following tweet: 
‘‘VOTER 
FRAUD 
ALERT: 
The 
@Txsecofstate 
discovered 
approximately 
95,000 individuals identified by DPS as non- 
U.S. citizens have a matching voting reg-
istration record in TX, appr 58,000 of whom 
have voted in TX elections. Any illegal vote 
deprives Americans of their voice.’’ 
The Texas Governor then issued a state-
ment supporting ‘‘prosecution where appro-
priate’’ of ‘‘this illegal vote [sic] registra-
tion.’’ As noted above, these inflammatory 
allegations proved to be entirely false. 
Kristen Clarke, then-Executive Director of 
the Lawyers’ Committee, testified before the 
Subcommittee in 2019 that, ‘‘the list was 
based on DMV data that the state knew was 
flawed and would necessarily sweep in thou-
sands of citizens who completed the natu-
ralization process after lawfully applying for 
a Texas drivers’ license.’’ Ms. Diaz testified 
that litigation work ‘‘led Texas officials to 
admit to knowing the discriminatory impact 
of their citizenship review on naturalized 
citizens.’’ A federal court described the state 
officials’ communications regarding the non- 
citizen purge effort as ‘‘threatening’’ and 
‘‘exemplif[ying] the power of government to 
strike fear and anxiety and to intimidate the 
least powerful among us.’’ 
Florida’s misconceived use of the SAVE 
database 
to 
identify 
‘‘non-citizen’’ 
reg-
istrants involved similarly troubling evi-
dence of discriminatory intent. The U.S. De-
partment of Homeland Security expressly 
advised Florida officials that the SAVE data-
base was not a reliable tool to verify citizen-
ship. The State was similarly warned in a 
letter from the Justice Department. Despite 
these warnings, Florida nevertheless moved 
forward with its effort to remove alleged 
non-citizens using SAVE data—an effort 
that, as explained above, disproportionately 
targeted minority voters. The State was ul-
timately ordered to discontinue its purge 
based on the use of SAVE data following liti-
gation. 
Additionally, many of these voter purges— 
such as the errant and unlawful purges in 
Florida, Georgia, and Texas—occurred in 
states that were previously covered jurisdic-
tions under the VRA and had longstanding 
histories of racially polarized voting, which 
courts recognize provides Republican-con-
trolled state legislatures with an incentive 
to engage in election administration prac-
tices that disproportionately burden minor-
ity voters likely to support non-Republican 
candidates. For example, between 2016 and 
2018, Georgia purged more than 10 percent of 
its voters. 
In the context of mass voter challenges, a 
2016 case in North Carolina is illustrative of 
the way in which voter purges based off chal-
lenges can be used to discriminate against 
and suppress minority voters. As detailed in 
Ms. Lakin’s testimony, in the months and 
weeks before the November 2016 elections, 
boards of election in three North Carolina 
counties canceled thousands of voter reg-
istrations, ‘‘based solely on challengers’ evi-
dence that mail sent to those addresses had 
been returned as undeliverable.’’ Voters were 
not provided notice, and in one of the coun-
ties, ‘‘voters who were purged were dis-
proportionately African American.’’ 
In a court hearing on the case, the federal 
district judge stated that she was ‘‘horri-
fied’’ by the ‘‘insane’’ process by which vot-
ers could be removed from the rolls without 
their knowledge, and went on to say that the 
mass challenges at issue, ‘‘sound[ed] like 
something that was put together in 1901.’’ As 
noted previously, the federal court recog-
nized that these challenges are essentially 
systematic voter purges and thus require the 
same protections, and ultimately barred the 
state from removing voters based on these 
challenges unless the voters is given notice 
and a waiting period and unless the removals 
comply with the NVRA’s mandate of 90 days 
before federal elections. 
As also noted above, the voter purge ef-
forts in Florida and Texas were intended to 
combat registration and voting by non-citi-
zens, yet each state’s alleged evidence of 
non-citizen registration and voting proved 
wholly unsupported when subjected to even 
minimal scrutiny. The Texas actions, which 
largely targeted Latino voters, followed an 
election year wherein Latino voters doubled 
their turnout. 
Since the 2020 election, several states have 
enacted new laws, along partisan lines, de-
signed to purge voters more aggressively 
from their rolls. These new laws are justified 
by no more than unsupported claims of fraud 
or irregularities in the 2020 election. Iowa 
enacted a new ‘‘use-it-or-lose-it’’ voting list 
maintenance law requiring that the Iowa 
Secretary of State move all registrants who 
did not vote in the most recent general elec-
tion to ‘‘inactive’’ status—the first step to-
ward removing the registrant from the 
state’s rolls. Among those moved to ‘‘inac-
tive’’ status were hundreds of 17-year-olds 
who were eligible to register but not yet eli-
gible to vote in the 2020 general election. 
Arizona and Florida enacted laws making 
it easier to remove voters from the states’ 
vote-by-mail registration lists. And Geor-
gia’s new voting law, which imposes a vari-
ety of restrictions on voting, authorizes any 
individual Georgia citizen to file an unlim-
ited number of challenges to the eligibility 
of particular voters. 
CONCLUSION 
The evidence before the Subcommittee 
leads to a clear conclusion—voter list main-
tenance and voter purge processes can be, 
and are, wielded in a discriminatory manner 
and have a disproportionate impact on mi-
nority voters. Additionally, as will be dis-
cussed later in this report, erroneously re-
moving voters from the rolls does not affect 
only the individual voter, but can have rip-
pling consequences at the polling place, in-
creasing wait times that also disproportion-
ately impact minority voters. 
As Ms. Lakin of the ACLU stated in her 
testimony, ‘‘the integrity of our voter rolls— 
and thus our democratic process itself—are 
threatened by overly aggressive practices 
that wrongfully purge legitimate voters from 
the rolls—often disproportionately voters of 
color, voters with disabilities, and other his-
torically 
disenfranchised 
voters.’’ 
Also, 
tellingly, because the claimed justifications 
for the purge efforts have often been found to 
be unsupported or pretextual, the evidence 
illustrates that this disproportionate impact 
can be the product of discriminatory intent. 
As such, the methods by which states main-
tain their voter rolls and remove voters from 
active voter lists deserves a heightened level 
of scrutiny and protection for voters. 
CHAPTER FOUR—VOTER IDENTIFICATION
AND 
DOCUMENTARY
PROOF-OF-CITIZENSHIP
RE-
QUIREMENTS 
BACKGROUND 
A variety of state laws require voters to 
provide identification or attempt to require 
documentary proof-of-citizenship to vote or 
register to vote. In recent years, voter iden-
tification (‘‘voter ID’’) has been pushed for-
ward by many as a simple requirement nec-
essary to combat alleged voter fraud. This, 
again, is a false narrative. 
As Catherine Lhamon, then-Chair of the 
U.S. Commission on Civil Rights, testified 
before the Subcommittee in 2019, ‘‘[N]ot only 
was there no evidence given to the Commis-
sion about widespread voter fraud, the data 
and the research that is bipartisan reflect 
that voter fraud is vanishingly rare in this 
country . . . [A]nd so, it is duplicative and 
also harmful to initiate strict voter ID, 
among other kinds of requirements, in the 
name of combating voter fraud.’’ 
Michael Waldman of the Brennan Center 
testified that, ‘‘[v]oter fraud in the United 
States is vanishingly rare. You are more 
likely to be struck by lightning than to com-
mit in-person voter impersonation, for exam-
ple.’’ Furthermore, AAJC, MALDEF, and 
NALEO, note in their November 2019 report 
that, ‘‘[n]o proponent of strict ID require-
ments has ever produced credible evidence of 
widespread impersonation fraud in the reg-
istration or voting process that identifica-
tion cards would allegedly prevent.’’ 
Despite a continuous lack of credible evi-
dence that in-person voter fraud—the only 
form of fraud voter IDs would prevent—ex-
ists, these laws and polices continue to be 
pushed for and implemented across the coun-
try. Voter ID and documentary proof-of-citi-
zenship laws can and do disproportionately

impact minority voters and create discrimi-
natory barriers to the ballot box. 
Across both this Congress and the last, the 
Subcommittee heard substantial testimony 
about the financial burden of voter IDs—ef-
fectively creating a new poll tax—and the 
disproportionate impact this has on minor-
ity and low-income voters. Even when states 
proport to offer ‘‘free’’ IDs, they are not free. 
This was also borne out in the U.S. Commis-
sion on Civil Rights’ 2018 statutory report, 
An Assessment of Minority Voting Rights 
Access in the United States. For instance, 
the USCCR report observed that ‘‘expenses 
for documentation (e.g., birth certificate), 
travel, and wait times are significant—espe-
cially for low-income voters (who are often 
voters of color)—and they typically range 
anywhere from $75 to $175.’’ According to 
Professor Richard Sobel’s report on the high 
cost of ‘free’ photo voter ID cards: 
‘‘When legal fees are added to these num-
bers, the costs range as high as $1,500. Even 
when adjusted for inflation, these figures 
represent substantially greater costs than 
the $1.50 poll tax outlawed by the 24th 
Amendment in 1964.’’ 
In evaluating these costs, Professor Sobel’s 
report identified seven types of costs for in-
dividual voters in obtaining a ‘‘free’’ voter 
ID: (1) direct costs (out of pocket expenses); 
(2) time costs for correspondence and waiting 
to receive documents; (3) postage, delivery, 
and special handling expenses for documents; 
(4) travel costs to and from various agencies 
in order to obtain documents and apply for 
the ID; (5) travel time costs for making trips 
to government offices; (6) navigating costs 
for having to maneuver complex bureauc-
racies; and (7) waiting time costs at govern-
ment offices. Professor Sobel notes that 
there are other possible expenses for some 
individuals—such as those without driver’s 
licenses and without access to public trans-
portation, and some may have to pay legal 
fees and court costs to obtain required docu-
ments. 
Voter ID laws were some of the first voting 
laws implemented in previously covered 
states following the Supreme Court’s deci-
sion in Shelby. As Mr. Waldman stated in his 
testimony, ‘‘[i]n 2013, at least six states— 
Alabama, Mississippi, North Carolina, North 
Dakota, Virginia, and Texas—implemented 
or began to enforce strict photo ID laws, 
most of which had previously been blocked 
by the Department of Justice due to their 
discriminatory impact.’’ 
Hours after Shelby County was decided, 
Texas revived a previously blocked voter ID 
law— one of the strictest in the country at 
the time. Passed and signed into law in 2011, 
the law did not go into immediate effect as 
Texas was subject to preclearance. In 2012, 
the law was denied preclearance on the 
grounds that it discriminated against Black 
and Latino voters. Yet, despite the denial of 
preclearance because of discriminatory ef-
fects, within two hours of the Shelby deci-
sion Texas’ Attorney General announced the 
law would immediately go into effect. 
Also, within days of Shelby, Alabama an-
nounced it would move to enforce a photo ID 
law it had previously refused to submit to 
the Department of Justice for preclearance. 
In 2011, before the Shelby decision, the Ala-
bama state legislature passed House Bill 
(HB) 19, a law requiring voters to present a 
form of government-issued photo ID to vote. 
HB 19 also included a provision that would 
allow a potential voter without the required 
ID to vote if that person could be ‘‘positively 
identified’’ by two poll workers, a provision 
Ms. Nelson of the NAACP Legal Defense 
Fund characterized as one that, ‘‘harkened 
back to pre-1965 vouch-to-vote systems.’’ De-
spite the bill being passed and sent to the 
Governor’s desk in 2011, it was not imple-
mented until after the Shelby decision was 
handed down—after the state was no longer 
required to submit its voting changes to the 
DOJ for preclearance review under the VRA. 
Less than two months after the Supreme 
Court struck down the preclearance provi-
sions, North Carolina state legislators wast-
ed no time passing an omnibus ‘‘monster 
law.’’ The bill included voter ID provisions 
(among others) and would later be struck 
down as racially discriminatory. Records in 
the case showed that the data the State Leg-
islature consulted, ‘‘showed that African 
Americans disproportionately lacked the 
most common kind of photo ID’’ and that 
after Shelby, ‘‘with race data in hand, the 
legislature amended the bill to exclude many 
of the alternative photo IDs used by African 
Americans. As amended, the bill retained 
only the kinds of IDs that white North Caro-
linians were more likely to possess.’’ 
State laws governing the provision of iden-
tification at the time of voting can take sev-
eral forms. Certain states require that a 
voter present a photo ID to vote (often re-
ferred to as ‘‘strict photo ID laws’’). Other 
states require that a voter present an ID to 
vote, but do not require that the ID include 
a photograph (often referred to as ‘‘strict 
non-photo ID laws’’). Others do not require 
that voters present an ID to vote, but never-
theless permit poll workers to request that 
voters present either a photo ID (so-called 
‘‘Non-Strict Photo ID Laws’’) or a non-photo 
ID (so-called ‘‘Non-Strict ID Laws’’). Pres-
ently, 35 states have laws that request or re-
quire voters show some form of ID at the 
polls. 
Furthermore, proof-of-citizenship laws re-
quire registrants to provide documentary 
proof that they are United States citizens to 
register to vote. States that have required 
documentary proof-of-citizenship as a condi-
tion to register to vote have required a vari-
ety of forms of citizenship documents such 
as birth certificates, passports, certificates 
of naturalization, or driver’s licenses that 
specifically identify the individual as a cit-
izen. 
Because they involve conditions for apply-
ing to register to vote, proof-of-citizenship 
laws implicate the NVRA. The NVRA pro-
vides that driver’s license applications and 
renewal applications ‘‘shall serve as an ap-
plication for voter registration with respect 
to elections for Federal office.’’ Under the 
NVRA, the federal voter registration form 
and state voter registration forms included 
with a driver’s license application and re-
newal form must require that the applicant 
attest that they are eligible to vote (includ-
ing on the basis of citizenship). 
States such as Alabama, Arizona, Kansas, 
and Georgia attempted to enact laws requir-
ing documentary proof of citizenship when 
registering to vote. Additionally, former 
Election Assistance Commission (‘‘EAC’’) 
Executive Director Brian Newby attempted 
to unilaterally allow Alabama, Georgia, and 
Kansas to require stringent proof-of-citizen-
ship instructions when registering using the 
federal voter registration form—a move that 
was blocked by a federal court. 
Evidence 
presented 
before 
the 
Sub-
committee and discussed below shows that 
voter ID and documentary proof-of-citizen-
ship requirements can and do have dispropor-
tionate, discriminatory, and suppressive im-
pact on minority voters. 
THE
DISPROPORTIONATE
AND
DISCRIMINATORY 
BURDEN AND IMPACT ON MINORITY VOTERS OF 
VOTER ID AND DOCUMENTARY PROOF-OF-CITI-
ZENSHIP LAWS 
Voter ID Laws 
Scholars 
and 
stakeholders 
have 
high-
lighted a number of ways in which voter ID 
and documentary proof-of-citizenship laws 
can and do discriminate against minority 
voters. As Ms. Diaz of the UCLA Latino Pol-
icy and Politics Initiative testified: 
‘‘Racial/ethnic minorities are among those 
most sensitive to changes in voting. As such, 
reforms that enact voter identification laws 
to participate in an election have a disparate 
impact on minority voters voting. . . . Re-
cent studies show that these effects are even 
more disastrous for youth of color, who have 
even less access to valid forms of identifica-
tion.’’ 
Additionally, a February 2020 report pub-
lished by the UCLA School of Law Williams 
Institute estimates that voters who are 
transgender, particularly transgender voters 
of color, may face additional barriers when 
required to show ID to vote, especially if 
they have no ID documents that reflect their 
correct name and/or gender. 
Obtaining the required form of identifica-
tion or supporting documents is costly, 
which can disproportionately deter minority 
voters who are, on average, less wealthy 
than White voters and who disproportion-
ately lack access to qualifying IDs or docu-
mentation. A 2013 study by Harvard Law 
School’s Charles Hamilton Houston Institute 
for Race & Justice found that, even in states 
that provide ‘‘free’’ ID cards, the actual cost 
of obtaining a qualifying photo ID ranged 
from $75 to $368 due to indirect costs associ-
ated with travel time, waiting time, and ob-
taining necessary supporting documentation. 
The documents required to establish proof- 
of-citizenship are particularly expensive to 
obtain for naturalized and derivative citi-
zens, sometimes costing in excess of $1,000. 
Naturalized voters often must bear these 
costs in states that require voter ID as well 
because documents necessary to establish 
citizenship also are often necessary to obtain 
a qualifying form of identification. For ex-
ample, Terry Ao Minnis, Senior Director of 
Census and Voting Programs for Asian 
Americans Advancing Justice AAJC, testi-
fied before the Subcommittee that: 
‘‘If naturalized and derivative citizens need 
a replacement certificate of citizenship or 
naturalization to register to vote, they face 
a major hurdle: certificates of citizenship 
presently cost upwards of $1,170 and replace-
ment certificates of naturalization cost up-
wards of $555. In addition, to obtain a re-
placement, the average wait is between 8.5 to 
11 months for the Department of Homeland 
Security to process and to obtain a certifi-
cate of citizenship the average wait is 6.5 to 
14.5 months.’’ 
These burdens will disproportionately bur-
den a growing percentage of the U.S. popu-
lation. Ms. Minnis testified that Census data 
show that 62.8 percent of eligible Asian 
American; 31.0 percent of eligible Latino vot-
ers; 23.9 percent Native Hawaiian and Pacific 
Islander voters; and 10.3 percent of eligible 
Black voters were naturalized citizens as of 
2019, compared to just 3.8 percent of non-His-
panic white voters. 
The substantial cost of obtaining quali-
fying IDs or supporting documentation is 
particularly high when, as is the case in cer-
tain states, DMVs, or other government of-
fices where a voter can obtain a qualifying 
ID or other form of documentation, are less 
accessible for minority voters. Voter ID and 
proof-of-citizenship laws have become, in ef-
fect, modern-day poll taxes for many voters. 
For example, the implementation of Ala-
bama’s voter ID law soon after the Shelby 
decision, ‘‘was accompanied by the closure of 
nearly half of the state’s DMV locations, 
with most of the closures in disproportion-
ately poor and Black counties.’’ The day 
after the Shelby decision, Alabama an-
nounced it would implement its 2011 photo 
ID law—a law it had delayed implementing 
for two years—for the 2014 election. As a re-
sult of the DMV closures, Black voters had

to spend more time and money to travel to 
obtain qualifying IDs. As noted in the Sub-
committee’s previous report, the U.S. De-
partment 
of 
Transportation 
(‘‘DOT’’) 
launched an investigation into the DMV clo-
sures, which eventually resulted in DOT and 
the State of Alabama entering into a settle-
ment agreement. 
Similarly, DMV offices are not present on 
reservation lands, meaning that Native 
American voters often must drive at least an 
hour to obtain an ID. Indeed, Native Amer-
ican voters in North Dakota had to travel, 
on average, twice as far as non-Native Amer-
ican voters to visit a driver’s license office, 
with the average Standing Rock Sioux mem-
ber having to travel over an hour and a half 
to reach the nearest site to obtain identifica-
tion. As Matthew Campbell, Staff Attorney 
with NARF, testified: 
‘‘Today, many Native American reserva-
tions are located in extremely rural areas, 
distant from the nearest off-reservation bor-
der town. This was by design—official gov-
ernment policies forcibly removed Native 
Americans and segregated them onto the 
most remote and undesirable land. As a re-
sult of these policies, travel to county seats 
for voting services can be an astounding hun-
dreds of miles away. Services such as DMVs 
and post offices can also require hours of 
travel.’’ 
Various studies have also demonstrated a 
variety of ways in which voter ID laws dis-
proportionately burden minority voters. To 
begin, 
studies 
have 
consistently 
dem-
onstrated that minority voters are dis-
proportionately likely to lack forms of iden-
tification required by voter ID laws, meaning 
that minority voters are more likely to have 
to take the time and bear the costs of ob-
taining a qualifying ID. 
For example, one analysis found that in 
four states that had adopted voter ID laws— 
Wisconsin, 
Indiana, 
Pennsylvania, 
and 
Texas—White voters were statistically more 
likely to possess a valid form of ID than 
Latino and Black voters. Numerous other 
state-specific and nationwide studies have 
reached the same conclusion—minority vot-
ers disproportionately lack qualifying IDs. 
A meta-analysis using both state-level and 
national survey data revealed ‘‘that the 
magnitude of the negative impact of race on 
the likelihood of having a valid ID is sub-
stantial, outstripping other relevant vari-
ables like age, gender, and having been born 
outside the United States.’’ This differential 
effect persisted even when the authors con-
trolled for other explanatory factors like 
education level, home ownership, and in-
come. 
The Subcommittee also received evidence 
and testimony that the discriminatory bur-
dens associated with obtaining voter ID and 
documentary proof-of-citizenship laws are 
particularly pronounced for Native Amer-
ican voters. For example, a North Dakota 
voter ID law required that qualifying IDs in-
clude the voter’s physical address. However, 
Native American voters who live on reserva-
tions often lack a physical address, instead 
using a post office box. Mr. Campbell testi-
fied that ‘‘obtaining a state issued ID is un-
reasonably difficult for many Native voters.’’ 
The cost of obtaining a qualifying ID is 
also disproportionately burdensome for Na-
tive Americans, many of whom live below 
the poverty line and far from offices where 
they can obtain a qualifying ID. Mr. Camp-
bell, who himself served as one of the litiga-
tors on the North Dakota voter ID case, tes-
tified that due to these and other issues, 
‘‘voter identification laws can lead to the 
disenfranchisement of American Indians and 
Alaska Natives.’’ Mr. Campbell further testi-
fied that ‘‘[f] or impoverished Native Ameri-
cans, the cost of identification is often pro-
hibitively expensive. Even nominal fees can 
present 
a 
barrier.’’ 
Likewise, 
Alysia 
LaCounte, General Counsel for the Turtle 
Mountain Band of Chippewa Indians, testi-
fied before the Subcommittee during the 
116th Congress that the unemployment rate 
on the Turtle Mountain Reservation hovers 
near 70 percent: ‘‘[u]nderstand that the fee of 
$15 is not exorbitantly high, but $15 is milk 
and bread for a week for a poor family.’’ 
Drivers’ licenses are also often not required 
for everyday life on the reservation. 
Tribal IDs are also not automatically ac-
cepted for registration and voting purposes, 
despite the barriers for tribal members to 
get a state ID. Often, even when states do ac-
cept a tribal ID, the state may require the ID 
contain certain information to be sufficient 
that tribal IDs do not contain—updating 
tribal IDs to contain specialized information 
or security features can be expensive for im-
poverished tribes. Additionally, housing in-
security is pervasive among Native commu-
nities, as is a lack of regular postal service, 
leading many Native individuals to use P.O. 
Boxes instead of a residential address or 
omit an address altogether. All of these fac-
tors lead to voter ID laws having a dis-
proportionate impact on Native American 
voters. 
The Subcommittee also received substan-
tial testimony in the 116th Congress from 
leaders of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe, 
the Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa Indi-
ans, the Spirit Lake Tribe, and the Mandan 
Hidatsa and Arikara Nation about the sig-
nificant and disproportionate burden North 
Dakota’s voter ID law had upon their tribal 
governments and members. Tribal leaders 
testified as to the substantial resource bur-
den their tribes took on in order to provide 
their members with new IDs that would 
qualify for voting under the new law—re-
sources their tribes did not necessarily have. 
Additional testimony was gathered in the 
116th Congress at a field hearing conducted 
in Phoenix, Arizona, and the February 11, 
2020, hearing on Native American voting 
rights further detailing how voter ID issues 
disproportionately impact Native voters. 
Other studies have demonstrated that local 
officials administer voter ID laws in a dis-
criminatory manner. Dr. Lonna Rae Atkeson 
of the University of New Mexico testified 
that several studies of poll workers and vot-
ers suggest that implementation practices 
can result in unequal application of voter 
identification laws. A study of New Mexico’s 
non-strict voter ID law, for example, found 
that poll officials were more likely to re-
quest that Hispanic voters show an ID than 
non-Hispanic voters. Dr. Atkeson further 
testified that the effects of voter ID laws 
may also be to affect voter confidence and 
satisfaction in the election process, which 
may have long-term consequences on voter 
turnout or lead to increases in provisional 
voting. Additionally, Dr. Atkeson testified 
that subsequent studies haves sometimes 
shown various degrees of differences in im-
plementation of voter ID laws between 
Whites and Hispanics in New Mexico. 
Similar studies in Michigan and Boston 
reached the same result—poll workers are 
significantly more likely to request that mi-
nority voters present ID than White voters. 
Relatedly, a separate multi-state study 
found that (1) state and local election offi-
cials were less likely to answer email ques-
tions regarding voter ID requirements when 
the individual posing the question had a 
Latino last name and that (2) election offi-
cials provided less accurate information re-
garding voter ID requirements to requesters 
with Latino last names. This research dem-
onstrates that even non-strict voter ID laws 
impose discriminatory burdens on minority 
voters. 
Numerous studies also have demonstrated 
that strict voter ID laws disproportionately 
decrease registration and turnout of minor-
ity voters relative to White voters. One 
study focusing on Texas’ strict voter ID law 
found that ‘‘registrants voting without ID in 
2016 were 14 percentage points less likely to 
vote in the 2014 election, when a strict ID 
mandate was in place, and significantly more 
likely to be Black and Latinx than the popu-
lation voting with ID in 2016.’’ Additionally, 
a 2014 report prepared by the Government 
Accountability Office found that strict voter 
ID laws in Kansas and Tennessee reduced 
turnout by larger amounts among African 
American registrants than among White, 
Asian American, and Hispanic registrants. 
Nationwide and multi-state studies con-
ducted by Dr. Nazita Lajevardi of Michigan 
State University and her colleagues com-
pared political participation of minority vot-
ers in states with strict voter ID laws and 
states without such laws. In one set of stud-
ies, Dr. Lajevardi and her colleagues found 
that strict voter ID laws ‘‘have a differen-
tially negative impact on the turnout of ra-
cial and ethnic minorities in primaries and 
general elections,’’ estimating that Latinos, 
for example, are 10 percent less likely to 
turnout in general elections in states with 
strict voter ID laws than in states without 
such laws. 
Dr. Lajevardi and her colleagues further 
found that, in primary elections, strict voter 
ID laws ‘‘depress Latino turnout by 9.3 per-
centage points, Black turnout by 8.6 points, 
and Asian American turnout by 12.5 points.’’ 
These turnout declines were associated with 
increases—in many cases several-fold in-
creases—in the gap in participation rates be-
tween white and non-white voters. In an-
other study published several years later, Dr. 
Lajevardi and her co-authors found a similar 
result using a different multi-state dataset 
and methodology. The study found that 
‘‘turnout declined significantly more in ra-
cially diverse counties relative to less di-
verse counties in states that enacted strict 
identification laws . . . than it did in other 
states.’’ 
Summarizing these and other studies ana-
lyzing the impact of voter ID laws on the po-
litical participation of minority voters, Dr. 
Lajevardi testified that ‘‘strict voter identi-
fication laws are racially discriminatory and 
have real consequences for impacting the ra-
cial makeup of the voting population.’’ Dr. 
Lajevardi also testified that, ‘‘[b]y raising 
the cost of voting for some individuals more 
than others, they affect who votes and who 
does not, and in doing so, they substantially 
shape whose voices are represented in our de-
mocracy.’’ 
Dr. Matthew Barreto of the UCLA Latino 
Policy and Politics Initiative agreed: 
‘‘The best evidence available suggests that 
voter ID laws have a negative, racially dis-
parate impact on turnout across the states 
. . . [and] that racial disparities in access to 
identification appropriate for voting persist 
even after accounting for important covari-
ates like education and income.’’ 
Documentary Proof-of-Citizenship Requirements 
While all states require proof of citizenship 
to register to vote, an attestation of citizen-
ship under penalty of perjury has generally 
met the requirement. Similar to voter ID 
laws, documentary proof-of-citizenship re-
quirements have purported to combat non- 
citizen voting—a claim that is false. 
Documentary 
proof-of-citizenship 
laws 
have also been shown to have similar dis-
criminatory effects on political participation 
by minority voters as voter ID laws. For ex-
ample, evidence developed in the course of 
an investigation by the Kansas State Advi-
sory Committee to the USCCR found that a

disproportionate number of Kansas voters 
who had incomplete voting applications or 
were placed on the suspense voters list were 
located in Census tracts with a dispropor-
tionately high percentage of Black residents, 
younger voters, and low-income voters, for 
whom the high cost of obtaining proof-of- 
citizenship was disproportionately burden-
some. After Arizona’s adoption of a docu-
mentary proof-of-citizenship law, for exam-
ple, ‘‘the percent share of Latino voter reg-
istration in the state fell.’’ 
Recent studies have demonstrated that Af-
rican American and Latino voters are less 
likely to have access to birth certificates 
and passports—documents often required to 
establish proof of citizenship—than White 
voters. And Puerto Rican-born voters face 
particularly significant difficulty obtaining 
documents necessary to prove their citizen-
ship as a result of a 2009 change in birth cer-
tificate standards that invalidated all birth 
certificates issued by Puerto Rico prior to 
2010—a change that potentially impacts ap-
proximately 1.8 million Puerto Rican-born 
adults now living on the mainland. Since the 
new standards were adopted, Puerto Rican- 
born voters who seek to register to vote in a 
state with a proof-of-citizenship requirement 
must either have a U.S. passport, or go 
through additional procedures and pay fees 
for a new birth certificate after July 2010. 
Kira Romero-Craft, Director, Southeast 
Region for LatinoJustice PRLDEF, testified 
that in July 2019, for example, LatinoJustice 
and the Southern Center for Human Rights 
filed suit in the U.S. District Court for the 
Northern District of Georgia on behalf of 
their client for discrimination based on the 
Georgia Department of Driver Services’ 
(‘‘DDS’’) practice of ‘‘confiscating original 
identity documents from Puerto Rican-born 
applicants for Georgia drivers’ licenses and 
denying equal protection of the laws and 
privileges due to Puerto Rican-born U.S. 
citizens.’’ 
LatinoJustice’s 
investigations 
found that the practice of turning away U.S. 
citizens presenting Puerto Rican identity 
documents, confiscating Puerto Rico birth 
certifications and original Social Security 
cards for ‘‘fraud’’ investigations, or denying 
them the opportunity to exchange their driv-
er licenses for a Georgia license had been 
going on as far back as the 1990s and un-
doubtedly harmed U.S. citizens who were 
otherwise eligible to vote. 
As Ms. Diaz of the UCLA Latino Policy and 
Politics Initiative testified, proof-of-citizen-
ship laws ‘‘give rise to a presumption that 
the growing and diverse Latino population is 
under attack; this was especially true of Ari-
zona, where a proof of citizenship law was 
overturned by the Ninth Circuit.’’ Andrea 
Senteno, Regional Counsel for MALDEF, tes-
tified that there is a growing body of evi-
dence that: 
‘‘[S]hows that proof of citizenship require-
ments in fact prevent significant numbers of 
U.S. citizens from registering to vote, and 
that ‘‘[s]urveys show that millions of Amer-
ican citizens—between five and seven per-
cent—don’t have the most common types of 
documents used to prove citizenship: a pass-
port or birth certificate.’’ 
Additionally, Terry Ao Minnis of AAJC 
testified that documentary proof-of-citizen-
ship, as well as voter ID requirements, dis-
proportionately impact Asian Americans due 
to high rates of immigration and naturaliza-
tion in the community. Ms. Minnis testified 
that Asian Americans will ‘‘face greater bar-
riers to registration than white voters under 
these laws as 76.6 percent of Asian American 
adults are foreign-born and 39.5 percent of 
Asian American adults have naturalized na-
tionwide, compared to 4.6 percent of white 
adults who are foreign-born and 3.8 percent 
who have naturalized.’’ 
ADDITIONAL EVIDENCE OF DISCRIMINATORY 
PURPOSE 
The Subcommittee was also confronted 
with evidence that the discriminatory im-
pact of voter ID and documentary proof-of- 
citizenship laws are the product of state leg-
islatures enacting them with a discrimina-
tory purpose. As noted above, following the 
Supreme Court’s decision in Shelby County, 
several states enacted or implemented par-
ticularly strict voter ID laws, several of 
which were later struck down by courts as 
intentionally discriminatory, and violative 
of the Constitution and the Voting Rights 
Act. These restrictions are examples of dis-
crimination in voting that warrant preemp-
tive federal protections. 
For example, as first discussed above, 
within days of the Shelby County decision, 
Texas implemented a photo ID law that had 
previously been denied preclearance by the 
Department of Justice. As Janai Nelson of 
the NAACP Legal Defense Fund testified, the 
law was widely described as the most restric-
tive voter ID law in the country as it per-
mitted concealed handgun license owners to 
vote with that ID—a form disproportionately 
held by white Texans—but prohibited the use 
of student IDs, and employee or trial state or 
federal government-issued IDs in voting. 
The Texas voter ID case took years to 
make its way through the courts. A federal 
court found that the voter ID law was uncon-
stitutionally 
intended 
to 
discriminate 
against minority voters, relying on evidence 
that the law selectively excluded forms of 
IDs that were disproportionately likely to be 
used by minority voters, that the legislature 
knew the law was likely to disproportion-
ately burden minority voters, and that cir-
cumstantial evidence indicated that the leg-
islature’s race-neutral justification for the 
law—preventing 
voter 
fraud—was 
‘‘pretextual.’’ Ms. Nelson testified further 
that, while LDF was ultimately successful in 
the Texas voter ID litigation, ‘‘in the years 
after the trial and while the case made its 
way twice to the 5th Circuit Court of Ap-
peals and back to the trial court, Texas 
elected numerous candidates to state and 
federal office . . .’’ 
A federal appellate court also struck down 
North Carolina’s voter ID law as inten-
tionally discriminatory, a law which was 
also was put forth within days of the Shelby 
County decision. Evidence in the North Caro-
lina voter ID case revealed that legislators 
tailored the list of acceptable IDs to exclude 
forms of identification disproportionately re-
lied on by minority voters. To support its 
finding of discriminatory intent—that the 
state legislature drafted the law to ‘‘target 
African Americans with almost surgical pre-
cision’’—the court emphasized that North 
Carolina had a long history of racially polar-
ized voting, that the law required forms of 
IDs that African Americans disproportion-
ately lacked, that legislators knew the law 
would disproportionately burden minority 
voters but nevertheless enacted it, and that 
the circumstances surrounding the passage 
of the law—that the law was amended to be-
come far more strict the day after Shelby 
County was decided—indicated that the leg-
islature acted with discriminatory intent. 
While the court ultimately struck down 
the North Carolina law, litigation alone is a 
costly, time consuming, and insufficient 
remedy. As Allison Riggs, Co-Executive Di-
rector and Chief Counsel for Voting Rights 
at the Southern Coalition for Social Justice 
(‘‘SCSJ’’), testified: 
‘‘[I]t took us three years and millions of 
dollars to finally secure a ruling from the 
Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals that the law 
was intentionally racially discriminatory, 
designed with almost ‘‘surgical precision’’ to 
change election rules in a way that would 
disadvantage Black voters the most. More 
than the time and cost, there were elections 
conducted with the photo ID requirement 
. . . Thousands of voters, disproportionately 
Black, were denied the franchise while we 
litigated that case, and those are real inju-
ries to those voters’ fundamental right to 
vote that can never be made whole.’’ 
As the Texas and North Carolina cases il-
lustrate, the risk that voter ID and docu-
mentary proof-of-citizenship laws can and 
will be enacted with discriminatory intent is 
particularly significant because legislatures 
can tailor the forms of acceptable IDs and 
documentation to disproportionately burden 
minority voters. 
For example, Dr. Barreto, who has con-
ducted extensive research into the discrimi-
natory effects of voter ID laws, explained in 
his testimony that ‘‘[i]n Texas, hunting and 
gun permits, which Whites are statistically 
more likely to possess, are legitimate forms 
of ID but social service cards, more often 
held by Blacks and Latinos, are not.’’ Con-
sistent with that empirical evidence, a Texas 
legislator testified ‘‘that all of the legisla-
tors knew that [the voter ID law], through 
its intentional choices of which IDs to allow, 
was going to affect minorities most.’’ 
Regarding 
discriminatory 
intent, 
Dr. 
Barreto further explained that research 
shows that voter ID laws have been adopted 
by partisan legislatures, often in states with 
a history of racially polarized voting, to bur-
den voters likely to vote against the party 
with legislative control. ‘‘Existing research 
demonstrates that voter ID laws are purpose-
ful tools, designed with the marginalized 
fringe of the electorate in mind, to shape 
who votes primarily in favor of state Repub-
lican legislatures facing competitive elec-
tions,’’ Dr. Barreto explained. 
Consistent with Dr. Barreto’s summary of 
the literature, Matthew Campbell testified 
that North Dakota’s Republican legisla-
ture—which had previously rejected voter ID 
laws—enacted the state’s strict voter ID law 
after Native American voters were instru-
mental to the election of a Democratic can-
didate to the United States Senate. 
Using 
an 
atypical 
procedural 
process 
known as a ‘‘hoghouse amendment’’ that 
‘‘expedited the bill’s passage and stifled de-
bate,’’ the legislature enacted the law know-
ing that Native Americans, who often have 
P.O. Boxes rather than the physical address 
required by the statute, would have a dis-
proportionately difficult time obtaining a 
qualifying ID. A federal court subsequently 
struck down the law on grounds that it im-
posed an unconstitutional burden on Native 
American voters, relying on evidence that 
Native American voters were disproportion-
ately likely to lack a qualifying ID and rul-
ing that North Dakota could not enforce the 
laws without providing a safety net for vot-
ers who ‘‘cannot obtain a qualifying ID with 
reasonable effort.’’ 
Despite a lack of fraud and knowledge of 
the significant impact on Native American 
voters, North Dakota adopted a strict voter 
ID law again in 2017. Mr. Campbell testified 
that, in considering the new voter ID law, 
‘‘the legislature failed to study, in any way, 
the impact the law would have on Native 
Americans. It did not consult any tribal gov-
ernments about whether its tribal members 
were negatively impacted by the bill or 
whether they supported or opposed the bill.’’ 
Following enactment, additional litigation 
ensued, and the parties eventually settled 
the matter in a way that ensured Native vot-
ers would have equal access to the ballot, 
but not before the District Court found that 
the new law required voters have one of the 
same forms of a qualifying ID that, ‘‘was pre-
viously found to impose a discriminatory

August 24, 2021 
and burdensome impact on Native Ameri-
cans.’’ 
Similarly, in finding that the Texas voter 
ID law was intentionally discriminatory, the 
court emphasized that the voter ID law was 
passed ‘‘in the wake of a seismic demo-
graphic shift, as minority populations rap-
idly increased in Texas, such that . . . the 
party currently in power [wa]s facing a de-
clining voter base and c[ould] gain partisan 
advantage through a strict voter ID law.’’ 
The Texas and North Carolina examples il-
lustrate another reason why there is a sub-
stantial risk that the discriminatory effects 
of voter ID and proof-of-citizenship laws are 
attributable to a discriminatory purpose: 
States’ proffered justification for the laws 
have been shown to be pretextual or unsup-
ported. 
For instance, in the Texas voter ID case, 
the court found evidence ‘‘support[ing] a 
finding that the Legislature’s race-neutral 
reason of ballot integrity offered by the 
State is pretextual.’’ Among other evidence, 
the record showed that ‘‘the evidence before 
the Legislature was that in-person voting, 
the only concern addressed by [the voter ID 
law], yielded only two convictions for in-per-
son voter impersonation fraud out of 20 mil-
lion votes cases in the decade leading up to 
[the law’s] passage.’’ 
A case successfully challenging a Kansas 
documentary 
proof-of-citizenship 
statute 
similarly turned on evidence that the alleged 
justification for the law—preventing voter 
fraud—lacked meaningful factual support. In 
finding that the law violated the Equal Pro-
tection Clause, the U.S. Court of Appeals for 
the Tenth Circuit held that law’s significant 
burden on the right to vote (it prevented 
more than 31,000 qualified applicants from 
obtaining registration) far outweighed the 
evidence supporting the state’s claimed need 
to prevent voter fraud by non-citizens (the 
state identified only 30 non-citizens who reg-
istered to vote in the 10 years leading up to 
adoption of the documentary proof-of-citi-
zenship law). 
The record in a case successfully chal-
lenging an Arizona proof-of-citizenship law 
similarly included a conspicuous absence of 
evidence supporting the legislature’s claimed 
purpose of combatting voter fraud by non- 
citizens. Ms. Senteno of MALDEF testified 
that, Arizona’s Proposition 200 was enacted 
with the purpose of combatting undocu-
mented immigration and the provisions re-
lated to proof of citizenship were in part an 
effort to ‘‘combat voter fraud’’—but the 
State ‘‘failed to identify a single instance in 
which an undocumented immigrant reg-
istered or voted in Arizona.’’ Ms. Senteno 
testified that: 
‘‘Proof-of-citizenship 
requirements 
have 
yet to prove effective in making our elec-
tions more secure or to be more effective 
than the safeguards against improper reg-
istration and voting that already exist. 
Meanwhile, such requirements have shown to 
significantly impede the political participa-
tion of voters of color.’’ 
Additionally, since the 2020 election, sev-
eral states have adopted bills expanding 
voter ID requirements, appealing to unsup-
ported claims that fraud occurred in the 2020 
election as justification. For example, the 
omnibus Georgia voting bill requires voters 
requesting an absentee ballot provide an ID. 
Under previous law, voters only had to sign 
the application attesting to their eligibility 
to vote. Similarly, Florida’s omnibus voting 
law added a new requirement that voters 
provide a form of ID to obtain a mail-in bal-
lot. Arkansas, Montana, and Wyoming also 
made their voter ID laws more restrictive. 
CONCLUSION 
The evidence before the Subcommittee is 
overwhelming—voter ID laws and require-
ments for documentary proof-of-citizenship 
can and do have a disproportionate, discrimi-
natory impact on minority voters. The evi-
dence presented shows that minority voters 
are less likely than White voters to have the 
required ID and are more likely to lack the 
documents required to obtain these IDs. 
Voter ID and documentary proof-of-citizen-
ship requirements amount to modern-day 
poll taxes—as the evidence shows, even when 
states claim to provide free IDs, the cost to 
voters is not free. 
The burden of voter ID and proof-of-citi-
zenship laws is borne disproportionately by 
Black, Latino, Asian American, and Native 
American voters, and as the evidence shows, 
states can and have enacted laws governing 
ID requirements to cast a ballot that not 
only have a discriminatory impact but do so 
with discriminatory intent. The discrimina-
tory and suppressive effects of voter ID and 
proof-of-citizenship requirements warrant a 
heightened level of scrutiny and protection 
to ensure every voter has equal and equi-
table access to their right to vote. 
CHAPTER FIVE—ACCESS TO MULTI-LINGUAL 
VOTING MATERIALS AND ASSISTANCE 
BACKGROUND 
As it was amended over the years, the VRA 
was expanded to afford additional protec-
tions to language minority or limited- 
English proficiency (‘‘LEP’’) voters. The lan-
guage access provisions were added after 
Congress recognized that certain minority 
citizens experienced historical discrimina-
tion and disenfranchisement due to limited 
English proficiency and speaking ability. 
The 1975 amendments adding Section 203 of 
the VRA came after ‘‘Congressional findings 
of discrimination and intimidation of voters 
with limited-English proficiency, which had 
led to ongoing socioeconomic disparities and 
low literacy rates.’’ 
Sections 4(e), 4(f), 203, and 208 are consid-
ered the ‘‘language minority provisions’’ of 
the VRA. These sections were not overturned 
by the Shelby decision, and remain key pro-
tections for LEP voters. However, significant 
gaps in enforcement and implementation re-
main, and the Court’s decision in Shelby and 
subsequent removal of preclearance hindered 
a key enforcement and monitoring mecha-
nism, limiting access for millions of LEP 
voters—a disproportionate number of whom 
are minority voters. 
Section 4(e) protects U.S. citizens educated 
‘‘in American flag schools’’ in a language 
other than English by barring states and 
local governments from conditioning such 
citizens’ right to vote on their ability to 
read, write, understand, or interpret English. 
In practice, this means that every state and 
local government is required to provide lan-
guage assistance to such voters and it pro-
vides specific protections to citizens edu-
cated in Puerto Rico in Spanish. 
These protections extend to all 50 states, 
whether the voter lives in a jurisdiction cov-
ered by the population thresholds of Section 
203’s coverage formula or not. 
Section 203 of the VRA, originally adopted 
as part of the second reauthorization in 1975 
and later amended and expanded, requires ju-
risdictions where the number of U.S. citizens 
of voting age in a single, covered language 
minority group that is more than 10,000 or 
exceeds five percent of the jurisdiction’s 
total population, and their illiteracy rate is 
higher than the national rate, to provide 
voting materials in the language of the lan-
guage minority. The definition of perma-
nently prohibited ‘‘test[s] and device[s]’’ was 
expanded to include: 
‘‘[A]ny practice or requirement by which 
any State or political subdivision provided 
any registration or voting notices, forms, in-
structions, assistance, or other materials or 
information relating to the electoral proc-
ess, including ballots, only in the English 
language, where the Director of the Census 
determines that more than five per centum 
of the citizens of voting age residing in such 
State or political subdivision are members of 
a single language minority.’’ 
The 1992 VRA amendments expanded the 
coverage formula for language access to in-
clude not only the previously covered for-
mula of five percent of eligible voters who 
were LEP voters and members of a language 
minority group, but also those jurisdictions 
that did not have the high five percent 
threshold, but had at least 10,000 LEP citi-
zens who are members of a single language 
minority group. This expansion meant cov-
erage would also reach Latino and Asian 
American voters in some large cities. These 
amendments also expanded the coverage for-
mulas and access for Native Americans liv-
ing on Indian Reservations to include any In-
dian reservation where the LEP population 
exceeded five percent of all reservation resi-
dents. Under the VRA 2006 reauthorization, 
the sunset date for language minority assist-
ance required under Section 203 was extended 
to August 5, 2032. 
Which jurisdictions are covered under Sec-
tion 203 is determined by the Census Bureau 
based on the formula set out in the VRA— 
the language minority groups covered are 
those that speak Asian, American Indian, 
Alaska Native, and Spanish languages. The 
most recent determinations for Section 203 
coverage were made on December 5, 2016. In 
the 2016 evaluation, the Census Bureau found 
that 263 jurisdictions met the threshold for 
coverage. 
Between 2011 and 2016, 15 additional coun-
ties were added to the list of localities re-
quired to provide language assistance mate-
rials as well as four new states. Political 
subdivisions within Alaska, Arizona, Cali-
fornia, Colorado, Connecticut, Florida, Geor-
gia, Hawaii, Idaho, Illinois, Iowa, Kansas, 
Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Mis-
sissippi, Nebraska, Nevada, New Jersey, New 
Mexico, New York, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, 
Rhode Island, Texas, Utah, Virginia, Wash-
ington, and Wisconsin currently fall under 
Section 203 coverage and are required to pro-
vide bilingual voting materials. California, 
Florida, and Texas currently fall under 
statewide coverage for Spanish language ma-
terials. 
Added in the 1982 VRA reauthorization, 
Section 208 requires that voters who require 
assistance to vote be provided the assistance 
of their choice. Voters have the right to as-
sistance by a person of their choosing—other 
than their employer, an agent of their em-
ployer, or an officer or agent of the voter’s 
union—whether they need assistance because 
of blindness, disability, or inability to read 
or write. According to the USCCR’s 2018 Mi-
nority Voting Rights Access Report, Section 
208 litigation by the Justice Department 
typically relates to the failure to provide 
language assistance or a failure to allow a 
disabled person to choose their assistance. 
Prior to the Shelby County decision, cov-
ered jurisdictions were required to obtain 
preclearance of any changes in laws related 
to the provision of language access under 
Sections 4(f)(4) and Section 5. Following the 
Shelby decision, the Justice Department 
stated that it believed it could no longer re-
quire preclearance of changes in access to 
language materials and support in the pre-
viously covered jurisdictions. 
When properly implemented, the language 
access provisions increase engagement in the 
democratic process and access to the ballot 
for millions of LEP voters. For example, 
John Yang, President and Executive Direc-
tor of AAJC, testified before the Sub-
committee in 2019 that ‘‘Section 203 has been

one of the most critical provisions in ensur-
ing Asian Americans are able to cast their 
ballot.’’ Jerry Vattamala, Director of the 
Democracy Program at the Asian American 
Legal 
Defense 
and 
Education 
Fund 
(‘‘AALDEF’’) testified that: 
‘‘Section 203 has proven to be a clear and 
effective measure to ensure access to LEP 
voters through language assistance. . . . 
However, the Supreme Court’s Shelby Coun-
ty decision dismantling the coverage for-
mula has left a large gap in protections for 
Asian American voters that requires Con-
gressional action and renewed DOJ enforce-
ment of remaining VRA provisions.’’ 
Failure to provide multi-lingual voting 
materials or assistance can negatively im-
pact millions of potential voters. According 
to the 2018 Census data, more than 37 million 
American adults speak a language other 
than English and more than 11.4 million of 
them are not yet fully fluent in English. The 
2015–2019 
American 
Community 
Survey 
(ACS) 5-year Narrative Profile from the Cen-
sus Bureau found that, among people at least 
five years old living in the U.S. from 2015– 
2019, 21.6 percent spoke a language other 
than English at home. Additionally, navi-
gating the electoral process is complex and 
can be overwhelming. Some LEP voters will 
have immigrated from a country with a vast-
ly different electoral and voting process. 
Evidence collected by the Subcommittee 
during the 116th and 117th Congresses, along 
with historical data, illustrates a long his-
tory of jurisdictions’ failure to comply with 
the language access provisions, a failure to 
provide adequate language assistance and 
translated materials, and the discriminatory 
impact this failure has on minority voters’ 
access to the ballot. 
Arturo Vargas, Chief Executive Officer of 
the National Association of Latino Elected 
and Appointed Officials Educational Fund 
(‘‘NALEO’’) testified in 2019 that, ‘‘Ameri-
cans who depend upon language assistance 
are becoming more diverse and more geo-
graphically dispersed, and these factors 
heighten the importance of effective lan-
guage assistance.’’ 
THE
DISPROPORTIONATE
AND
DISCRIMINATORY 
BURDEN AND IMPACT OF LACK OF ACCESS TO 
MULTI–LINGUAL VOTING MATERIALS AND SUP-
PORT 
The failure to provide multi-lingual voting 
materials disproportionately burdens minor-
ity voters. Sonja Diaz of UCLA’s Latino Pol-
icy and Politics Initiative testified that, as 
of 2019, approximately 4.82 percent of the cit-
izen voting-age population needs to cast a 
ballot in a language other than English. 
Data trends show that populations such as 
Asian American and Latino voters will only 
continue to grow. While the full 2020 Census 
data has yet to be released, Ms. Minnis testi-
fied that, among Asian Americans ‘‘[t]his 
growth will continue, with Asian American 
and Pacific Islander (AAPI) voters making 
up five percent of the national electorate by 
2025 and 10 percent of the national electorate 
by 2044.’’ 
According to 2017 data, more than 85 per-
cent of the voters who likely require lan-
guage assistance in voting were voters of 
color. For example, Ms. Diaz stated that an 
estimated six million eligible Latino voters 
nationwide are not fully fluent in English 
and require some form of language assist-
ance in order to vote. Additionally, Juan 
Cartagena, President and General Counsel of 
LatinoJustice PRLDEF, testified before the 
Subcommittee in 2019 that the population on 
the island of Puerto Rico is roughly 65 per-
cent Spanish-language dominant. Further-
more, in Puerto Rico all government pro-
ceedings happen in Spanish, making the lan-
guage access protections afforded Puerto 
Ricans educated on the island under Section 
4(e) critical to their ability to participate 
fully in elections within the 50 states. 
According to data collected by the Native 
American Rights Fund, ‘‘[o]ver a quarter of 
all single-race American Indian and Alaska 
Natives speak a language other than English 
at home,’’ rendering multi-lingual voting 
materials particularly important for Native 
American voters. 
Ms. Minnis of AAJC testified that, because 
of historical discrimination that denied 
Asian Americans the rights held by U.S. citi-
zens for most of the country’s existence, and 
because immigration from Asia was not re-
opened until 1965, today ‘‘almost three out of 
every four Asian Americans speaks a lan-
guage other than English at home and al-
most one in three Asian Americans is lim-
ited English proficient (LEP)—that is, has 
some difficulty with the English language.’’ 
The provision of language access mate-
rials, or lack thereof, extends to all facets of 
the voting process. Ms. Minnis testified that, 
even basic information such as election no-
tices and voter registration forms or the in-
formation requested on those forms ‘‘is inac-
cessible to millions of eligible American vot-
ers unless they have access to multilingual 
translators, preventing the eligible voter 
from even starting the process.’’ Ms. Minnis 
further testified that, even if the voter is 
able to get past the registration phase, with-
out language assistance they may have 
issues navigating the voting process, with 
many voters forced to use election websites 
that are English-only, or a jurisdiction may 
attempt to use Google Translate or a similar 
tool, which may produce incomplete or inac-
curate translations, the equivalent of pro-
viding no translation at all. 
Matthew Campbell of NARF testified to 
the disproportionate impact the lack of lan-
guage access and assistance has on Native 
voters as well. According to his testimony, 
‘‘[t]wo-thirds of all speakers of American In-
dian or Alaska Native languages reside on a 
reservation or in a Native village, including 
many who are linguistically isolated, have 
limited English skills, or a high rate of illit-
eracy,’’ and that a lack of assistance or com-
plete and accurate translations of materials 
for LEP American Indian and Alaska Native 
voters ‘‘can be a substantial barrier.’’ Thir-
ty-five political subdivisions in nine states 
are required to provide bilingual written ma-
terials and oral language assistance for LEP 
American Indian and Alaska Native voters 
under Section 203. Mr. Campbell noted that, 
jurisdictions have often failed to provide any 
language assistance at all, forcing Native 
voters to file costly lawsuits. 
Scholars 
and 
stakeholders 
have 
dem-
onstrated that providing LEP voters with 
voting materials in their native language in-
creases the likelihood they will participate 
in the political process. Studies have shown, 
for example, that language fluency cor-
relates with political participation, meaning 
that lowering language barriers should lead 
to increases in turnout among LEP voters. 
Summarizing the scholarly literature exam-
ining the impact of access to multi-lingual 
voting materials on LEP voters, Dr. Barreto 
explained 
that 
‘‘[r]esearch 
in 
political 
science has documented with clear evidence 
that access to Spanish, Asian, and Native/in-
digenous 
language 
voting 
materials 
in-
creases voter participation rates among im-
pacted minority voters.’’ 
Scholars and stakeholders have also ana-
lyzed the registration and turnout effects as-
sociated with living in a jurisdiction that 
provides language access materials, finding 
that access to native language voting mate-
rials increases political participation. For 
example, after San Diego County, California, 
began 
providing 
language 
assistance 
to 
Latinos and Filipinos, voter registration 
among those two groups increased by more 
than 20 percent. Regarding turnout, one 
multi-jurisdiction study found that turnout 
of voters who speak only Spanish increased 
between seven and 11 percentage points in 
counties that were required to provide lan-
guage access support relative to counties 
with similarly large Latino populations not 
required to provide bilingual voting support. 
Another multi-state study found that, in 
the 2012 election, coverage under the VRA’s 
language access provisions was associated 
with a significant increase in Latino voter 
registration and a significant increase in 
Asian American turnout. Earlier studies 
reached the same conclusion: ‘‘Section 203 
language access resulted in higher voting 
rates for Latinos, Asian Americans and other 
immigrant communities.’’ Surveying several 
of these studies, Ms. Minnis of AAJC ex-
plained that ‘‘[i]f the access to multilingual 
support helps to eradicate language barriers, 
the withdrawal or denial of multilingual sup-
port exacerbates language barriers, inter-
feres with free and fair access to the ballot 
through the voting process, and leads to less 
voters participating in American democ-
racy.’’ 
Empirical research also found evidence 
that coverage under the VRA increases mi-
nority political participation. One study 
found that coverage under the Voting Rights 
Act language access provisions is associated 
with significantly higher Latino representa-
tion on school boards relative to non-covered 
jurisdictions. That empirical finding is con-
sistent with evidence presented to the Sub-
committee. For example, Orange County, 
California, and Harris County, Texas, saw 
the election of Vietnamese American elected 
officials after they began providing language 
assistance to Vietnamese American voters. 
Dr. Barreto testified that, ‘‘similar to 
voter identification laws, the research has 
demonstrated an inconsistent application 
with many covered jurisdictions not aware 
or not providing the proper non-English vot-
ing materials. This has a tremendously nega-
tive impact on those communities’ ability to 
understand and participate in our elections.’’ 
Illustrative of the broad protections courts 
have read into language protections such as 
Section 4(e), Kira Romero-Craft, Southeast 
Region Director for LatinoJustice, testified 
that courts have declined to read any numer-
ical requirements into Section 4(e)’s plain 
language and have ordered counties with as 
few as two dozen Puerto Rican voters to 
offer some bilingual assistance because, ‘‘it 
is 
a 
‘basic 
truth 
that 
even 
one 
disenfranchised 
voter—let 
alone 
several 
thousand—is too many.’’’ 
Limits on language assistance also dis-
proportionately impacts minority voters. 
Ms. Senteno testified that, for example, 
MALDEF is involved in a pending case in Ar-
kansas challenging a section of the state’s 
election code that limits the number of vot-
ers an individual may assist with casting a 
ballot to six total, arguably restricting the 
number of voters who may be able to receive 
language assistance from the person of their 
choice. 
The manner in which voting materials and 
ballots are written can also negatively im-
pact LEP voters. Ms. Minnis testified that, 
even if an LEP voter is able to obtain a bal-
lot, it is often written in advanced English, 
which is not accessible for LEP voters. In 
her testimony, Ms. Minnis notes that an 
analysis of statewide ballot measures voters 
voted on in 2018 found that the average grade 
level was between 19 and 20, meaning it 
would require a graduate-level degree to un-
derstand them. The use of complex English 
on ballots and other voter materials makes 
it difficult for LEP voters to understand and

respond, which can also be compounded by 
higher levels of illiteracy rates, whether in 
English or the voter’s native language. 
Dr. Barreto testified that, where Section 
203 and 208 have been implemented fairly and 
fully, 
‘‘[W]e have seen a higher voter participa-
tion rate, both first-time voters as well as [] 
of returning voters, where the most difficult 
things can be for a voter which has language 
challenges to navigate the system, and if 
they don’t feel that they can do that, if they 
don’t feel welcome, if the language materials 
are not available [] they may just leave and 
not come back. They may feel excluded from 
the system. Where Section 203 is imple-
mented, there have been very robust in-
creases in Spanish-speaking Latino voter 
participation.’’ 
Dr. Barreto noted that, where voters have 
a negative experience at the polls and are 
challenged or are not able to navigate the 
polling place, ‘‘that leads to a rejection and 
withdrawal.’’ 
Several legal actions have successfully 
sought to compel local election officials to 
provide language access materials, often re-
quiring years of litigation for plaintiffs to 
obtain relief and involving troubling evi-
dence of discriminatory animus. 
A district court found that Berks County, 
Pennsylvania, for example, failed to adhere 
to language access provisions in the VRA by 
failing to offer Spanish-language materials 
for voters educated in Puerto Rico and fail-
ing to make available bilingual poll workers. 
The court further found that local election 
officials engaged in ‘‘hostile and unequal 
treatment’’ of Hispanic and LEP voters, 
which ‘‘intimidated’’ such voters. 
Additionally, Ms. Romero-Craft testified 
that the State of Florida has been a covered 
jurisdiction for the Spanish language under 
Section 203 since 2011 and that there are also 
13 counties in the state which are subject to 
minority language requirements for Spanish 
under the law. Yet, despite the direct protec-
tions of the law: 
‘‘Florida’s language minority voters have 
continued to face discrimination at the polls 
and frequently do not receive adequate lan-
guage assistance they critically need to be 
able to cast a ballot for their preferred can-
didate of choice or to make informed deci-
sions when deciding how to cast their votes 
on ballot initiatives.’’ 
A district court recently entered an order 
barring dozens of Florida counties from con-
tinuing to violate the VRA by failing to pro-
vide bilingual voting assistance to voters of 
Puerto Rican descent. The plaintiffs were re-
peatedly forced to pursue further relief after 
a number of election officials refused to com-
ply with the order and make multi-lingual 
assistance available, asserting, for example, 
that ‘‘the small number of voters requesting 
Spanish-language ballots did not justify the 
cost.’’ Florida was previously sued in 2000 by 
the Department of Justice for failure to pro-
vide language materials and in 2009 by 
LatinoJustice for failure to provide assist-
ance to voters from Puerto Rico as required. 
District Judge Mark Walker noted in his 
order that, ‘‘[i]t is remarkable that it takes 
a coalition of voting rights organizations 
and individuals to sue in federal court to 
seek minimal compliance with the plain lan-
guage of a venerable 53-year-old law.’’ 
The Subcommittee also received wide-
spread reports of non-compliance with the 
VRA’s language access requirements, in nu-
merous states and localities, and often in-
volving troubling evidence or inference of 
discriminatory intent. Ms. Romero-Craft 
provided testimony of examples in Florida 
and Georgia, such as Liberty County, Geor-
gia’s failure to provide Spanish-language 
voting materials and services despite citi-
zens of Puerto Rican descent comprising 
nearly five percent of the county’s total pop-
ulation. In testimony provided in the 116th 
Congress, Sean Young of the ACLU of Geor-
gia testified that Hall County, Georgia was 
required to provide Spanish language mate-
rials under Section 4(e), as all counties are, 
but the board refused. One study found that 
only 68.5 percent of jurisdictions fully com-
plied with the Voting Rights Act’s language 
access requirements with respect to the pro-
vision of Spanish language materials. 
Jerry Vattamala of AALDEF testified to 
several examples of jurisdictions’ failure to 
provide language access materials to Asian 
American voters. For example, AALDEF 
filed a federal complaint on June 3, 2021, 
against the City of Hamtramck, Michigan, 
for its failure to comply with the require-
ments as a covered jurisdiction under Sec-
tion 203 for Hamtramck to provide trans-
lations of all voting information and mate-
rials, including election websites, and oral 
language assistance for Bangladeshi voters 
in Bengali. 
In another example, Mr. Vattamala high-
lighted jurisdictions’ failure to ensure equal 
access to interpreters or through hostile 
treatment or discrimination by poll workers 
such as AALDEF discovered when moni-
toring the primary election in Malden, Mas-
sachusetts, in March 2020, a jurisdiction cov-
ered under Section 203 for Chinese language 
assistance. Ms. Minnis testified that, during 
the 2012 election, voters reported to the Elec-
tion Protection Coalition that ‘‘they had 
been unlawfully prevented from obtaining 
language assistance at polling places from 
Suffolk County, New York, to New Orleans, 
Louisiana, and including an incident ‘‘in 
Kansas City, Missouri, where a poll worker 
asked a voter’s interpreter to leave the poll-
ing place and threatened her with arrest.’’ 
Marcia Johnson-Blanco of the Lawyers’ 
Committee testified that, in the 2020 elec-
tion, voters reported lack of or insufficient 
language assistance in Berks and York coun-
ties in Pennsylvania. Ms. Johnson-Blanco 
testified that: 
‘‘The most egregious instance occurred in 
York County, where election officials rather 
than provide needed language assistance (1) 
spoke slowly and used hand gestures and 
mimicry as a prerequisite to allowing voters 
to utilize an interpreter, (2) impeded inter-
preters’ conversations with voters by hov-
ering over conversations and interrupting 
interactions telling voters that they could 
not use the interpreter and (3) prevented vot-
ers from using their assistance of choice 
with casting their ballot.’’ 
Repeated failure to provide bilingual vot-
ing materials is also, troublingly, particu-
larly common in Native American commu-
nities, and has led to litigation. Section 203 
covers 357,409 American Indians and Alaska 
Natives who reside in a jurisdiction where 
assistance must be provided in a covered Na-
tive language. However, as Matthew Camp-
bell of NARF testified, jurisdictions have 
often failed to provide the required trans-
lations or have failed to provide any lan-
guage assistance at all, forcing costly law-
suits. Mr. Campbell testified that this is ex-
actly what happened in Alaska, which led to 
Toyukak v. Treadwell, ‘‘the first Section 203 
case fully tried through a decision in thirty- 
four years.’’ 
Even after plaintiffs in Alaska obtained a 
consent agreement requiring Alaskan offi-
cials to provide adequate language assist-
ance to Yu’pik-speaking voters, the attor-
neys had to repeatedly return to court to 
provide fulsome relief. Documents produced 
in litigation showed that Alaskan officials 
made a ‘‘policy decision’’ not to comply with 
Section 203 in several jurisdictions, con-
sciously choosing not to provide required 
language assistance. In 2013, a group of tribal 
councils and Alaska Native voters charged 
Alaska state officials with continuing viola-
tion of the VRA and the Constitution for 
their refusal to provide information in 
Yu’pik that was available in English—in its 
ruling for the plaintiffs, the court confirmed 
that ‘‘officials’’ negligence had produced 
egregious results—Yu’pik voters were de-
prived of any and all critical pre-election in-
formation.’’ 
In Toyukak, Alaska election officials de-
nied Native voters language assistance de-
spite a previous court finding in Nick v. 
Bethel that all voting information provided 
in English must be provided orally even if 
written translations are not required. The 
court held in Toyukak that Section 203 
should be interpreted as ‘‘merely changing 
the means by which voting information and 
materials is communicated to LEP Amer-
ican Indians and Alaska Natives, and Section 
203 does not permit election officials to di-
minish the content and extent of informa-
tion that must be provided.’’ Mr. Campbell 
testified that the parties ‘‘worked together 
to produce a joint stipulation that aimed to 
remedy Alaska’s Section 203 violations and 
included strong relief such as federal observ-
ers to document compliance efforts.’’ Mr. 
Campbell testified further that: 
‘‘Reports filed by federal observers in 2016 
suggest that Alaska’s efforts fell short of 
fully remedying the Section 203 violations 
and complying with the Toyukak Order. . . 
During the 2016 primary, federal observers 
documented there were no voting materials 
available in the covered Alaska Native lan-
guage in six villages, and the ‘‘I voted’’ 
sticker was the only material in a Native 
language in two other villages. Alaska has 
made some improvements since Toyukak 
such as having bilingual poll workers avail-
able, but almost forty years of Section 203 
violations cannot be remedied overnight and 
continued investment in language assistance 
for American Indian and Alaska Natives is 
crucial to ensuring Native voters have equal 
access to the election process.’’ 
Alaska is not the only jurisdiction to have 
failed to comply with requirements to pro-
vide Native voters with language access. As 
Mr. Campbell’s testimony notes, San Juan 
County, Utah, is a covered county for the 
Navajo language, but the County has failed 
voters by refusing to comply with Section 
203. Additionally, in 2014 the County removed 
all language assistance by switching to a 
vote-by-mail system and providing no trans-
lated ballot information to LEP Navajo vot-
ers, many of whom received an English bal-
lot they could not read and so they simply 
did not vote. A settlement reached between 
the County and litigators restored the closed 
polling places and mandates the County pro-
vide the required language assistance. Fail-
ure to provide access to Native language 
services has also impacted Native American 
voters in Arizona. Professor Patty Ferguson- 
Bohnee, Director of the Indian Legal Clinic 
at the Sandra Day O’Connor College of Law, 
testified before the Subcommittee in 2019 
that in Arizona, in 2016, only one of nine ju-
risdictions covered under Section 203 for Na-
tive languages provided translated voter reg-
istration information in the covered lan-
guage. 
CONCLUSION 
Congress has, at multiple junctures in his-
tory and in legislating, moved to protect the 
right to vote through increased access to 
language assistance. Congress recognized 
that access to multi-lingual voting materials 
and assistance is critical to ensuring fair and 
equal access to the ballot. While the lan-
guage access provisions of the Voting Rights 
Act remain intact following the Court’s deci-
sion in Shelby County, the evidence before

the Subcommittee in both this Congress and 
the last is clear—significant gaps remain in 
adherence to the law and the provision of 
fair access to multi-lingual voting materials 
and assistance. 
The failure to provide the required assist-
ance is pervasive and creates significant bar-
riers to accessing the ballot, barriers that 
fall disproportionately on LEP voters, who 
are more likely to be minority voters. Addi-
tionally, as Jerry Vattamala of AALDEF 
testified, protecting access to language ma-
terials and assistance on a case-by-case basis 
is unsustainable and insufficient: 
‘‘Individual affirmative cases require a 
large amount of human and financial re-
sources which limit the reach and scope of 
work that organizations like AALDEF can 
do. For example, in the OCA v. Texas case 
that AALDEF brought against the state of 
Texas for violating Section 208 of the Voting 
Rights Act, it took more than three years to 
litigate from client intake to final decision, 
and required hundreds of hours of attorney 
time.’’ 
The evidence presented before the Sub-
committee demonstrates that ensuring ac-
cess to multi- lingual materials and assist-
ance warrants increased protections. 
CHAPTER
SIX—POLLING
PLACE
CLOSURES, 
CONSOLIDATIONS, RELOCATIONS, AND LONG 
WAIT TIMES AT THE POLLS 
BACKGROUND 
Prior to the Supreme Court’s decision in 
Shelby County, states and localities in cov-
ered jurisdictions were required to notify 
voters well in advance of polling location 
closures, to prove those changes would not 
have a disparate impact on minority voters, 
and to provide data to the DOJ about the im-
pact on voters. In the years since Shelby 
County was decided, states that were pre-
viously covered by the VRA have closed hun-
dreds of polling locations. 
Issues related to polling place locations, 
quality, accessibility, and ensuing long wait 
times to vote are, unfortunately, well-docu-
mented and pervasive. For example, at the 
Subcommittee’s 2019 listening session in 
Brownsville, Texas, Mimi Marziani, Presi-
dent of the Texas Civil Rights Project 
(‘‘TCRP’’) testified that, ‘‘long lines and late 
openings are, unfortunately, such a common 
feature of Texas elections that they are 
deemed ‘typical’ by election officials.’’ 
Marcia Johnson-Blanco of the Lawyers’ 
Committee reported in testimony before the 
Subcommittee that, in Pennsylvania, two of 
the top three issues reported to Election 
Protection on Election Day 2020 were long 
lines, particularly in communities of color, 
and late polling place openings. Ms. Johnson- 
Blanco also noted issues of long lines being 
reported in Georgia, Texas, California, and 
Wisconsin throughout the 2020 primaries and 
general election. 
Polling location closures and movements 
can and do disproportionately burden minor-
ity voters, whether by intent or effect. Poor 
polling place locations, lack of availability, 
and a lack of resources leads to minority 
voters facing longer lines than White voters 
at the polls. Polling place closures are harm-
ful to voter turnout, especially the turnout 
of minority voters—waiting in a long line to 
vote can make a voter less likely to turn out 
in future elections. Disparities in Election 
Day experiences between minority voters 
and White voters are a persistent problem. 
Kevin Morris of the Brennan Center noted in 
testimony before the Subcommittee that 
‘‘[o]ver the past decade, scholars have con-
sistently noted that racial minorities wait 
longer to cast their ballots on election day 
than White voters.’’ 
The disparity in polling place accessibility 
and wait times is then compounded by the 
disparate impact of other practices discussed 
in this report such as voter ID accessibility, 
proper access to multi-lingual materials and 
assistance, voter purges, and restrictions on 
alternative opportunities to vote. As Ms. 
Marziani testified before the Subcommittee 
this Congress, ‘‘fewer polling places is one 
driver of long lines, a symptom of polling 
place inefficiencies that is compounded by 
other devices that make voting more oner-
ous and time-consuming, such as Texas’ 
strict photo identification law (the same one 
originally struck down under Section 5).’’ 
While there may be legitimate reasons for 
closing, consolidating, or moving polling lo-
cations, without the disparate impact data, 
community consultation, and evaluation to 
support these changes, there is no preemp-
tive way to ensure these closures do not dis-
criminate against minority voters. Polling 
place closures, consolidations, relocations, 
and under-resourcing can and do lead to 
longer or extreme wait times or can require 
voters to drive for miles to reach a polling 
place. 
In Georgia, for example, Gilda Daniels of 
the Advancement Project testified at the 
2019 field hearing that at the Pittman Park 
voting sites in 2018 they received calls that 
lines were ‘‘reportedly 300 people deep with a 
wait time of 3.5 hours.’’ The 2020 primary 
election in Georgia saw extremely long wait 
times yet again—voters waited in hours-long 
lines, some late into the night and the early 
hours of the next day. Counties are regularly 
sued to extend the hours of polling locations 
to ensure all voters can cast a ballot. Voters 
in Georgia waited in lines so long they 
brought chairs to wait for the opportunity to 
cast their ballot. Volunteers provided food 
and water to people who had to wait in line 
for hours. 
Polling place locations that necessitate 
traveling long distances are particularly bur-
densome, and unfortunately an all-too-com-
mon occurrence, for Native American voters. 
Movement toward mail-in voting, closure of 
polling locations, lack of polling places lo-
cated on tribal lands, and moves toward con-
solidated vote centers can disproportion-
ately impact and possibly disenfranchise Na-
tive voters who face barriers such as lack of 
access to transportation, lack of traditional 
residential mailing addresses, lack of access 
to reliable mail service and distance. When 
fighting to ensure their communities have 
equal opportunities to vote, many tribal 
communities are at the mercy or discretion 
of county officials who choose where to place 
the polling locations and the level of ballot 
access. 
Evidence 
presented 
before 
the 
Sub-
committee at hearings spanning this Con-
gress and the last, and discussed below, 
shows that pervasive polling place location 
issues, long wait times, and under-resourcing 
have a disproportionate, discriminatory, and 
suppressive effect on the ability of minority 
voters to freely and fairly exercise their 
right to vote. 
THE
DISPROPORTIONATE
AND
DISCRIMINATORY 
BURDEN AND IMPACT OF POLLING PLACE CLO-
SURES, CONSOLIDATIONS, AND
RELOCATIONS, 
WAIT TIMES, AND LACK OF RESOURCES ON MI-
NORITY VOTERS 
Polling Place Availability and Accessibility 
No matter the reason, polling place clo-
sures, consolidations, or relocations, or a 
lack of adequate resourcing can lead to long 
lines and extreme wait times or can require 
voters to drive for miles to reach a polling 
place. This burden often falls disproportion-
ately on minority voters. Without the dis-
parate impact data and analysis previously 
required 
under 
the 
Voting 
Rights 
Act 
preclearance process, community consulta-
tion, 
and 
evaluation 
to 
support 
these 
changes, there is no longer a preemptive 
mechanism to ensure these closures do not 
discriminate against minority voters. 
As Jesselyn McCurdy, Managing Director 
of Government Affairs for the Leadership 
Conference testified, ‘‘[v]oting discrimina-
tion and disenfranchisement takes many 
forms, but one tangible way to quash Ameri-
cans’ voices is to physically remove the very 
locations where ballots are cast and counted. 
While they do not garner the attention that 
voter purges and ID laws do, polling place 
closures can be just as disenfranchising.’’ 
One of the starkest examples of this oc-
curred recently during the 2020 primary elec-
tion, when voters in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, 
were forced to stand in line for hours at one 
of only five polling places open across the 
city to cast their ballot on Election Day, 
after failing to receive absentee ballots in 
the mail and just weeks after officials shut 
down 175 sites. The make-up of Milwaukee is 
disproportionately Black—Madison, a much 
less populous town with a whiter population, 
boasted 66 polling sites to Milwaukee’s 5. 
According to an analysis by Demos and All 
Voting is Local, Milwaukee is home to 60.32 
percent of Wisconsin’s Black voters and 29.69 
percent of the state’s Hispanic voters. These 
polling place closures had a measurable 
disenfranchising 
effect. 
A 
peer-reviewed, 
journal article by the Brennan Center’s 
Kevin Morris and Peter Miller found that the 
closures in Milwaukee depressed turnout by 
more than 8 percentage points overall—and 
by about 10 percentage points among Black 
voters. 
The disenfranchising effects of polling 
place closures or movements have been docu-
mented by studies as well. Studies have 
shown that the closure or relocation of a 
polling location reduces turnout by one to 
two percentage points, meaning that the clo-
sure of relocation of polling locations that 
disproportionately serve minority voters 
also serves to disproportionately reduce 
turnout of minority voters. 
These burdens are attributable to the fact 
that the closures or relocations force voters 
to travel farther to vote, which can be par-
ticularly burdensome on Latino, Native 
American, Asian/Pacific Islander, and Black 
voters who disproportionately lack access to 
a private vehicle. Distances to polling loca-
tions can be particularly burdensome for Na-
tive American voters living on rural, tribal 
lands, with some voters being forced to trav-
el tens of miles to reach their polling loca-
tion. Accessible polling locations are also 
necessary for LEP voters to access the fran-
chise, as some voters who need language ac-
cess materials or assistance may need a 
physical polling place to best exercise their 
right to vote. 
The closures of polling locations ticked up 
dramatically in states previously covered by 
the VRA following the Supreme Court’s deci-
sion in Shelby County. Ms. McCurdy testi-
fied that, without a fully functioning VRA 
and consistent oversight by the DOJ in re-
viewing proposed changes, election officials 
‘‘have unfettered discretion to shut them 
down without providing any valid reason.’’ A 
September 2019 report prepared by The Lead-
ership Conference Education Fund found 
that states and localities that were pre-
viously covered by Section 5 of the VRA 
closed 1,688 polling places between 2012 and 
2018, almost double the rate identified in 
2016. The Leadership Conference found that, 
in 2018 alone, there were 1,173 fewer polling 
places than there were in the previous 2014 
midterm election. Another study found that 
by 2020 approximately 21,000 polling places 
that served voters on Election Day have been 
eliminated nationwide.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4476 
August 24, 2021 
the Campaign Legal Center (‘‘CLC’’) has con-
tinued to document polling place closures in 
Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama. For ex-
ample, Danielle Lang, Director of Voting 
Rights at the Campaign Legal Center testi-
fied that: 
‘‘Since Shelby County, Louisiana has seen 
a steady decline in polling place access, espe-
cially for urban communities. For example, 
Jefferson Parish, Louisiana’s largest parish, 
has seen an 8.7 percent increase in the num-
ber of Black registered voters between 2012 
and 2020 but a 15 percent decrease in the 
number of polling places.’’ 
CLC also found that counties in Mississippi 
and Alabama displayed a similar pattern. 
For example: 
‘‘Lauderdale County, Mississippi—which is 
44 percent Black—closed 20 percent of its 
polling places between 2012 and 2020, even 
though the county’s citizen voting age popu-
lation increased by 3 percent. And Shelby 
County, Alabama—namesake of the Supreme 
Court decision—closed roughly 10 percent of 
its polling places between 2012 and 2020, de-
spite an increase of almost 13 percent in the 
county’s citizen voting age population.’’ 
Ms. McCurdy, of the Leadership Conference 
testified 
before 
the 
Subcommittee 
that 
‘‘[p]olling place closures did not seem to 
vary to meet the different demands of each 
type of election; indeed, 69 percent of clo-
sures (1,173) occurred after the 2014 midterm 
election in anticipation of the presidential 
election, which would necessarily bring high-
er turnout in communities of color.’’ One 
would have reasonably expected the number 
of available polling places to increase to cor-
respond to the anticipated higher turnout. 
Ms. McCurdy further testified, however, that 
‘‘[t]his appears to be no accident: as pollsters 
predicted greater turnout for the 2018 mid-
term, counties with a history of discrimina-
tion began shutting down access to voting 
booths at an alarming rate.’’ 
As noted previously, under Section 5, cov-
ered jurisdictions were previously required 
to demonstrate that closures would not have 
a discriminatory impact on voters, and to 
notify voters of the closures when they were 
permitted to occur. Now, post-Shelby, juris-
dictions no longer need to notify voters of 
the change, nor is the DOJ required to ana-
lyze the impact of the proposed changes on 
minority voters. Ms. McCurdy testified that: 
‘‘All told, Shelby County paved the way for 
several previously covered states to each 
shut down hundreds of polling places: Texas 
shut down 750; Arizona shut down 320; and 
Georgia shut down 214. Quieter efforts to re-
duce the number of polling places without 
clear notice or justification spread through-
out Louisiana (126), Mississippi (96), Alabama 
(72), North Carolina (29), and Alaska (6).’’ 
Over both the 116th and 117th Congresses, 
the Subcommittee heard testimony about 
how polling place closures can directly tar-
get locations predominantly used by minor-
ity voters. 
For example, in Irwin County, Georgia, the 
Board of Elections attempted to close the 
only polling place in the county’s sole Black 
neighborhood, contrary to non-partisan rec-
ommendations, while keeping open a polling 
place in a 99 percent white neighborhood. In 
2019, the City Council of Jonesboro, Georgia, 
voted to move the city’s only polling loca-
tion to its police department without pro-
viding the public notice required and with-
out taking into consideration the possible 
deterrent effect on minority voters. Ms. Ro-
mero-Craft of Latino Justice testified that 
Hall County, Georgia’s, decision to only re-
open half of its early voting sites for the 2020 
run-off election caused ‘‘substantial reduc-
tions 
and 
disproportionately 
burdened 
Latino voters.’’ 
Mimi Marziani of the Texas Civil Rights 
Project testified that, the best available evi-
dence strongly suggests that many of the 
polling place closures that have taken place 
across Texas since Shelby County have dis-
parately and negatively impacted commu-
nities of color. Ms. Marziani testified that, 
‘‘[i]n short, history and current data confirm 
that voters of Texas are not evenly affected 
by the State’s detrimental changes to poll-
ing place locations, operations and hours. In-
stead, Black and Latinx Texans will suffer a 
heavier burden, as they have time and 
again.’’ Texas, a state with a population that 
is 39 percent Latino, 12 percent African 
American, and 1.4 percent Asian American, 
has closed 750 polling places since Shelby. 
The Texas example is particularly egre-
gious. Ms. Marziani provided data that hun-
dreds of polling places were closed before the 
2016 
presidential 
election, 
‘‘significantly 
more in both raw number and percentage 
than any other state.’’ In Galveston, Texas, 
16 percent of its polling locations were closed 
in 2016, according to a plan that had initially 
been rejected by the DOJ because it dis-
criminated against Black and Latino voters. 
Three Texas counties closed between 75 and 
80 percent of their total polling sites, rank-
ing among the 10 counties with the highest 
percentage of poll closures in the country. 
Texas is not the only example. Ms. McCur-
dy testified that Arizona, a state where 30 
percent of the population is Latino, 4 percent 
is Native American, and 4 percent is African 
American, has the most widespread reduc-
tion (¥320) in polling places—‘‘almost every 
county (13 of 15 counties) closed polling 
places after Shelby County—some on a stag-
gering scale.’’ Ms. McCurdy’s testimony 
noted that these closures occurred despite 
national news coverage of ‘‘the adverse im-
pact of polling place reductions in Maricopa 
County in the 2016 presidential preference 
election, which forced voters to stand in line 
for five hours to cast a ballot.’’ 
Georgia—a state that is 31 percent African 
American, 9 percent Latino, and 4 percent 
Asian American—had 214 fewer polling places 
for the 2018 election than it did before 
Shelby. Ms. McCurdy stated that Georgia 
counties have closed higher percentages of 
voting locations than any other state the 
Leadership Conference reviewed for their De-
mocracy Diverted report. 
Gilda Daniels, the Director of Litigation at 
the Advancement Project, testified that her 
organization had collected data that, since 
2012, Ohio had closed more than 300 polling 
locations across the state, a disproportionate 
number in urban areas. Furthermore, Ms. 
Daniels testimony notes that, between 2016 
and 2018, Cuyahoga County (Ohio’s second 
largest county) eliminated 41 polling loca-
tions and nearly 16 percent of all precincts 
changed location, harming a majority of 
Black communities. 
While some states are closing polling loca-
tions in the shift to the vote center model, 
the lack of preclearance requirements means 
these shifts are happening without the req-
uisite analysis to ensure they do not dis-
criminate against minority voters. Addition-
ally, the shift to a vote center model does 
not necessarily explain all polling place clo-
sures. 
For example, in Texas, Somervell, Loving, 
Stonewall, and Fisher counties all closed be-
tween 60 and 80 percent of their polling 
places without converting to a vote center 
model. According to Ms. Marziani’s testi-
mony, each of these counties has a large 
Latinx population. Following the November 
2018 General Election, TCRP conducted a 
comprehensive review of county compliance 
with provisions of the state Election Code 
and the Voting Rights Act—they found that 
many counties, regardless of size or polling 
place model, were out of compliance with 
elections laws. Texas was unlawfully short 
as many as 270 polling places in a total of 33 
counties that contained four million reg-
istered voters collectively in 2018. 
Additionally, Kevin Morris of the Brennan 
Center, testified that although more than 
half of all states have statutes detailing min-
imum standards for the number of polling 
places, many states simply do not comply 
with their own laws. Mr. Morris stated that, 
for example, his team uncovered evidence 
that ‘‘more than 40 percent of precincts in Il-
linois had more registered voters assigned to 
than allowed under state law, as did nearly a 
quarter of precincts in Michigan.’’ 
Standards for polling place locations can 
also be crafted in a way that is discrimina-
tory toward minority voters. For example, 
Ms. Marziani testified that an earlier version 
Texas’ State Bill (SB) 7, which moved 
through the State House but has not been 
signed into law, included a provision that 
would have created a formula to distribute 
polling places that would pull polling places 
away 
from 
communities 
of 
color. 
Ms. 
Marziani testified that the Texas Tribune 
found that, of the 13 State House districts in 
Harris County that would lose polling sites 
under this formula, all but one has a major-
ity non-white voting-age population. 
At the time of this report, the Texas state 
legislature has returned for a special session, 
during which the Republican-led legislature 
is attempting to once again take up restric-
tive voting legislation. The bills moving 
through the State House and Senate contain 
numerous provisions that restrict access to 
the ballot and voting opportunities, includ-
ing, for example, putting limitations on poll-
ing places so as to ban drive-thru voting op-
tions. Texas Democrats have departed the 
state to deny a quorum at the legislature in 
order to block the voting restrictions bill. 
For Native American voters, the location 
of polling places, consolidations, and the dis-
tance to polling locations is a significant 
issue. In their 2020 Report, NARF wrote that 
‘‘Native voters generally must travel greater 
distances to get to their polling places than 
non-Native voters living in the same coun-
ties.’’ NARF goes on to report that often, 
polling places are located in non-Native 
county seats or non-Native communities, 
and in many cases the more populous Native 
communities are denied in-person voting on 
tribal lands, requiring them to travel off the 
reservation to vote. 
According to testimony from Professor 
Ferguson-Bohnee, Director of the Indian 
Legal Clinic at the Sandra Day O’Connor 
College of Law, in a 2018 survey conducted by 
the Native American Voting Rights Coali-
tion found 10 percent of respondents in New 
Mexico, 15 percent in Arizona, 27 percent in 
Nevada, and 29 percent in South Dakota 
identified distance from polling locations as 
one of the many problems associated with in- 
person voting. When polling locations or vot-
ing opportunities are located hours away it 
effectively amounts to no access for Native 
American voters. Professor Ferguson-Bohnee 
notes that the federal district court in Ne-
vada acknowledged this reality when it 
found that a polling location 16 miles away 
from the Pyramid Lake Paiute Reservation 
constituted an undue burden on voters. 
Nevada is not the only state where Native 
American voters face a disproportionate bur-
den when it comes to polling place access— 
in 2016, Native American voters in Nevada 
and Utah had to travel over 100 miles to 
their nearest polling locations. In Mohave 
County, Arizona, most residents in the Coun-
ty lived near one of the 3 locations estab-
lished for in-person early voting, however, 
for the Kaibab-Paiute Tribe the closest of 
the three locations was 285 miles away and 
required on-reservation voters to travel for 
over 5 hours if they wanted to vote early in 
person.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4477 
August 24, 2021 
In October 2020, NARF and the ACLU of 
Montana filed suit against Pondera County 
election officials on behalf of Blackfeet Na-
tion for failing to provide a satellite voting 
location on the reservation, depriving Tribal 
members of the same access to voting as 
White voters. According to the ACLU of 
Montana, the County offered in person vot-
ing between 60 to 80 miles away for Blackfeet 
Nation residents in the county seat—the suit 
resulted in a settlement agreement three 
days after filing in which Pondera County 
agreed to establish a satellite election office 
in Heart Butte. 
At the Subcommittee’s 2019 hearing in the 
Dakotas, Roger White Owl, Chief Executive 
Officer of the Mandan Hidatsa and Arikara 
Nation, testified that MHA Nation does not 
have enough polling places, ‘‘[w]ith only a 
couple of polling places, many Tribal mem-
bers had to drive 80 to 100 miles round trip to 
cast their vote. This is unacceptable.’’ 
Long Wait Times and Inadequate Resourcing at 
the Polls 
When minority voters do cast their ballot 
at a polling place, they are also more likely 
to face longer lines and wait times to do so. 
Dr. Stephen Pettigrew of the University of 
Pennsylvania 
testified 
before 
the 
Sub-
committee that: 
‘‘The most basic impact of waiting in a 
line is the time burden placed upon the 
voter—what has been referred to as a ‘time 
tax.’ Compared to those who live in areas 
with consistently short lines, voters who live 
in areas with chronically long lines must 
sacrifice more of their time to exercise their 
right to vote. This can be a particular bur-
den for people who have less flexibility in 
their schedule, whether because they have 
constraints in their work schedule or be-
cause they have childcare or eldercare re-
sponsibilities.’’ 
Furthermore, Kevin Morris of the Brennan 
Center testified that, ‘‘[o]ver the past dec-
ade, scholars have consistently noted that 
racial minorities wait longer to cast their 
ballots on election day than White voters.’’ 
Not only do minority voters face, on aver-
age, longer wait times, they also are more 
likely to experience wait times exceeding 60 
minutes, a wait widely recognized as unac-
ceptable, with one analysis finding that a 
voter living in a non-white neighborhood is 
more than 6 times more likely to wait 60 
minutes or more to vote than a voter living 
in a predominantly White neighborhood. 
In testimony before the Subcommittee, Dr. 
Pettigrew stated that, ‘‘[a] voter’s race is 
one of the strongest predictors of how long 
they wait in line to vote: non-white voters 
are three times more likely than White vot-
ers to wait longer than 30 minutes and six 
times as likely to wait more than 60 min-
utes.’’ Dr. Pettigrew’s testimony and re-
search also find that line length is a per-
sistent and systemic problem—the same 
places with long lines in one election are 
more likely to have long lines in subsequent 
elections. 
Furthermore, 
Dr. 
Pettigrew’s 
research 
finds that the wait times gap between White 
and non- White voters bridges the simple ex-
planation of a rural-urban divide, though 
that divide also exists. Dr. Pettigrew testi-
fied that, even within a given urban, subur-
ban, or rural county, lines tend to be longer 
in neighborhoods and precincts with higher 
concentrations of non-White voters. 
A report by the Brennan Center shows 
similar outcomes. Mr. Morris testified that 
the gaps cannot be explained solely by dif-
ferences in income, age, or education, and 
that the gaps are large, stating, ‘‘our report 
showed that in 2018, Black and Latino voters 
were more than one- and-a-half times as 
likely to wait 30 or more minutes as White 
voters.’’ According to the Brennan Center, in 
the 2018 election, for example, 6.6 percent of 
Latino voters and 7 percent of Black voters 
reported waiting 30 or more minutes or 
longer to vote on Election Day, whereas only 
4.1 percent of White voters reported waiting 
30 minutes or more. 
Additionally, in a recent report on equity 
in our democracy, the Brennan Center fur-
ther reported: 
‘‘A 2020 analysis by the Brennan Center re-
ported that Latino and Black voters were 
more likely to find themselves in the longest 
lines on Election Day than their White coun-
terparts: ‘‘Latino voters waited on average 
46 percent longer than White voters, and 
Black voters waited on average 45 percent 
longer than White voters.’’ Stanford Univer-
sity political science professor Jonathan 
Rodden analyzed data collected by Georgia 
Public Broadcasting/ProPublica and found 
that the average wait time after 7:00 p.m. 
across Georgia was 51 minutes in polling 
places 
that 
were 
90 
percent 
or 
more 
nonwhite, but only six minutes in polling 
places that were 90 percent White.’’ 
Ms. Marziani further highlighted this in 
her testimony, stating that, in Texas for ex-
ample: 
‘‘Press reports indicated wait times as high 
as seven hours, ‘particularly in communities 
of color and on college campuses.’ . . . Na-
tionally, communities of color regularly 
wait nearly twice as long to vote as White 
voters, and in Texas, too, long lines dispar-
ately impact Black and Latinx Texans.’’ 
Additionally, Keith Chen of the University 
of California, Los Angeles, found voters in 
Black neighborhoods waited longer to cast a 
ballot than voters in White neighborhoods, 
and were approximately 74 percent more 
likely to wait longer than half an hour. 
Using data from the 2008 and 2012 elections, 
multi-state internet surveys of tens of thou-
sands of voters revealed that both African 
American and Hispanic voters faced substan-
tially longer wait times at the polls than 
White voters. Other state-specific studies 
have shown that minority voters face dis-
proportionately long lines relative to White 
voters. 
According to a report in the New York 
Times, this disparity continued in the 2020 
election— ‘‘casting a vote typically took 
longer in poorer, less white neighborhoods 
than it did in whiter and more affluent 
ones.’’ 
Ms. McCurdy of the Leadership Conference 
also testified to this point. Ms. McCurdy 
stated that: 
‘‘In previously covered jurisdictions, more-
over, mass closures similarly resulted in 
long lines: In 2020, voters stood in line for 
hours in Phoenix, Arizona, and Atlanta, 
Georgia; Texas’ shuttering of 334 polling 
places—more 
than 
any 
other 
state—in 
majority- Latino neighborhoods forced vot-
ers to drive farther than White people from 
other areas. Indeed, across the country 
Black and Latino voters consistently re-
ported longer wait-times than White voters.’’ 
Scholars 
and 
stakeholders 
have 
dem-
onstrated that the disproportionately long 
wait times faced by minority voters are 
often attributable to the differentially lower 
quality of the polling locations that serve a 
disproportionately large number of minority 
voters. For example, Dr. Pettigrew’s testi-
mony states that ‘‘one of the reasons why 
non-White voters wait longer to vote is that 
fewer resources, such as poll workers and 
voting machines, are allocated to precincts 
with more non-white registrants.’’ Studies 
have shown that election officials provide 
more poll workers and voting machines to 
disproportionately White precincts, relative 
to precincts that serve minority voters. A 
study by the Brennan Center showed that 
counties that saw a declining population of 
White voters also saw declines in polling lo-
cation resources, with counties where the 
population became whiter having 63 voters 
per poll worker, whereas counties that were 
becoming less White had 80 voters per poll 
worker. 
Equal distribution of resources alone, how-
ever, is not enough to address the disparate 
experience of minority voters. Mr. Morris 
testified that 
‘‘Equalizing the distribution of polling 
place resources, in other words, is insuffi-
cient to equalize voters’ experience on Elec-
tion Day. To ensure equitable Election Day 
experiences and end the excessive lines and 
wait times faced by minority voters, admin-
istrators need to distribute relatively more 
and higher-quality resources to neighbor-
hoods of color.’’ 
Mr. Morris further stated that, ‘‘although 
voters of color already face the longest lines, 
on average, they make up a growing share of 
the jurisdictions with the fewest electoral 
resources’’ and that ‘‘resource allocation 
patterns are on track to exacerbate, not 
mitigate, the racial wait gap in coming 
years. 
Additionally, as noted elsewhere in this re-
port, long wait times can be compounded by 
the disparate impact of the other practices 
discussed in this report. Mr. Morris testified 
for example, that the dynamic of inadequate 
resources ‘‘plays out especially clearly when 
it comes to language access.’’ Mr. Morris tes-
tified that research at the Brennan Center 
‘‘indicates that counties that have signifi-
cant and growing populations of voters 
whose first language is not English, but have 
not met the threshold to provide language 
assistance under Section 203 of the VRA, 
usually provide little-to-no language assist-
ance, leaving some communities under- 
resourced.’’ Voter purges that remove eligi-
ble voters from the rolls may cause delays at 
the polling place as poll workers take time 
trying to locate the voter’s record, and 
purged voters are often required to cast pro-
visional ballots—Mr. Morris testified that 
voters who cast a provisional ballot can take 
twice as long to cast their ballot as a tradi-
tional ballot. 
In addition to imposing direct burdens on 
minority voters, longer wait times also im-
pact the likelihood that a voter will vote in 
later elections, thereby disproportionately 
impacting 
and 
suppressing 
participation 
among minority voters. Voters who face long 
lines in one election are disproportionately 
likely not to vote in a subsequent election 
because of their adverse experience with the 
voting process. This means that when minor-
ity voters face disproportionately long wait 
times in one election, then these same voters 
are disproportionately likely not to turnout 
in subsequent elections. 
Dr. Pettigrew testified that, ‘‘[b]ecause 
voters’ experiences at the polling place have 
downstream consequences on their future 
turnout behavior and their confidence in the 
electoral system, policies that widen the 
wait time gap between White and non-white 
voters have the potential to put a thumb on 
the electoral scale by reshaping the elec-
torate.’’ 
For example, one study estimated that 
whereas African American voters comprise 
9.7 percent of the electorate, they accounted 
for 22 percent of the voters who voted in 2012 
but did not turnout in the 2014 election be-
cause of their adverse experience with long 
wait times. 
Dr. Pettigrew testified that, ‘‘[v]oters who 
waited between 30 and 45 minutes to vote 
were 1 percentage point less likely to turn 
out to vote in the next election, compared to 
voters who waited less than 15 minutes. 
When considering voters who waited more

than 60 minutes, this impact increases to 
about 1.6 percentage points.’’ Dr. Pettigrew 
notes that, ‘‘[w]hile these percentages may 
seem small, it is important to remember 
that in many elections million or tens-of- 
millions of voters experience long lines, 
meaning that future decreases in turnout 
can be in the hundreds-of-thousands.’’ 
CONCLUSION 
The evidence before the Subcommittee 
clearly illustrates the disproportionate, dis-
criminatory effect polling place closures, 
consolidations, and relocations and under 
resourcing has on access to the ballot for mi-
nority voters. The 2013 bipartisan Presi-
dential Commission on Election Administra-
tion set out a key recommendation that ‘‘as 
a general rule, no voter should have to wait 
more than half an hour in order to have an 
opportunity to vote’’—the evidence pre-
sented to the Subcommittee clearly shows 
that states and localities are falling far 
short of this, with minority voters dispropor-
tionately bearing the burden. 
As Danielle Lang, Director of Voting 
Rights at the Campaign Legal Center stated, 
‘‘[t]he quality of polling places—their num-
ber, location, accessibility, and resources— 
affects voter participation and confidence, 
thereby affecting the health and representa-
tive nature of American democracy.’’ The 
Supreme Court recognized as much, as Ms. 
Lang testified, confirming that ‘‘the location 
and accessibility of polling places can have a 
direct impact on a voter’s ability to exercise 
their fundamental right to vote. Litigation 
is simply an inadequate remedy to combat 
the scale of polling place closures and to 
combat the significant harm borne dis-
proportionately by minority voters. The 
data shows these issues are pervasive and 
have a significant suppressive effect on vot-
ers, demanding heightened scrutiny and pro-
tections to ensure every voter has access to 
the franchise. 
CHAPTER SEVEN—RESTRICTING OPPORTUNITIES 
TO VOTE 
BACKGROUND 
The 2020 general election was yet another 
proof point in what we knew to be true about 
administering elections in America—when 
voters are given a variety of options for 
when and how to cast their ballot outside of 
traditional in-person Election Day voting, 
they take advantage of those options. These 
options include casting a ballot by utilizing 
early in-person voting, curbside or drive-thru 
voting options, mail-in voting, or placing a 
completed ballot in a drop box. Undeniably, 
voting in-person on one Tuesday in Novem-
ber is impractical or impossible for millions 
of Americans. 
Each of these alternative options are also 
secure. Election administrators across the 
country proved during the 2020 and prior 
elections that they can be administered in 
ways that reinforces the integrity of our 
elections even when utilized at record levels. 
Cybersecurity and election security officials, 
in fact, stated that the 2020 election was ‘‘the 
most secure in American history.’’ 
Early voting, and especially weekend early 
voting, is a critical tool to ensuring access 
to the ballot and reducing wait times at the 
polls. Absentee or no-excuse/mail-in voting 
is also crucial to providing voters with op-
tions for casting a ballot. In testimony sub-
mitted before the Subcommittee, Gilda Dan-
iels of the Advancement Project stated, ‘‘[i]t 
has been proved that expanding early voting, 
vote by mail ballots, and drop box return op-
tions decrease the cost of voting’’ and mak-
ing these options widely available can assist 
with turnout and smooth election adminis-
tration. 
Studies have shown that restrictions on a 
variety of alternatives to voting in-person on 
Election Day have the potential to dis-
proportionately 
burden 
minority 
voters. 
Moreover, restricting alternative opportuni-
ties to vote burdens Latino and Black voters, 
who disproportionately lack the ability to 
shift their working hours, and therefore are 
less able to vote on Election Day. Restrict-
ing voting options can also burden Native 
American voters, who have non-traditional 
mailing addresses, long distances to travel to 
polling locations, often lack transportation, 
and can have inconsistent access to mail 
services. Failure to provide adequate lan-
guage assistance also impedes the ability of 
LEP voters to fully understand and take ad-
vantage of voting options such as absentee 
voting or assessing what early voting op-
tions are available. 
While a variety of options for casting a 
ballot outside of the traditional Election 
Day are being utilized with increasing fre-
quency by all voters, including minority vot-
ers, that increased use has also made these 
opportunities to vote the subject of targeted, 
suppressive voting laws in the post-Shelby 
era. 
Michael Waldman of the Brennan Center 
testified that multiple states have reduced 
early voting days or sites used disproportion-
ately by minority voters, such as in Ohio and 
Florida, where legislatures eliminated early 
voting on the Sundays leading up to Election 
Day after Black and Latino voters conducted 
successful ‘‘Souls to the Polls’’ turnout 
drives on those days. Federal courts struck 
down early voting cutbacks in North Caro-
lina, Florida, and Wisconsin because they 
were intentionally discriminatory. Similar 
efforts are underway today, cutting or re-
stricting early voting, mail-in voting, and 
ballot return methods, which will dispropor-
tionately impact and burden minority vot-
ers. 
Under the false flag of ‘‘election integrity’’ 
and combating fraud, as of July 14, 2021, 
more than 400 bills have been introduced by 
lawmakers in 49 states to curb access to the 
vote. As of the writing of this report, at least 
18 states have enacted new laws containing 
provisions that will restrict access to voting 
and opportunities to vote. 
The Brennan Center reports that at least 
16 mail-in voting restrictions in 12 states 
will make it more difficult for voters to cast 
mail ballots that count and at least eight 
states have enacted 11 laws that make in- 
person voting more difficult. These laws 
come on the heels of an election in which re-
ports show that the share of voters casting 
mail-in ballots far exceeded any other recent 
national elections, and the share of voters 
who reported going to a polling place on 
Election Day dropped to its lowest point in 
at least 30 years. According to a report by 
the Brennan Center: 
‘‘Compared to 2016, Latino voters in 2020 
quadrupled their participation in early and 
absentee balloting—a 224 percent increase, 
compared to a 165 percent increase for early 
and absentee ballots cast by voters overall. 
In the 13 most contested battleground states 
in the 2020 election, Asian American and Pa-
cific Islander voters saw their early and ab-
sentee voting rise nearly 300 percent from 
2016 levels.’’ 
Laws enacted in Arkansas, Florida, Geor-
gia, Iowa, and Montana restricting access to 
the ballot are already being challenged in 
court. 
Evidence 
presented 
before 
the 
Sub-
committee across numerous hearings clearly 
illustrates that the cuts made to opportuni-
ties to vote have a disproportionate and dis-
criminatory impact on minority voters and, 
in some cases, are pursued with a provable 
discriminatory intent. 
CUTBACKS
AND
RESTRICTIONS
ON
OPPORTUNI-
TIES TO VOTE AND THE DISCRIMINATORY AND 
DISPROPORTIONATE BURDEN AND IMPACT ON 
MINORITY VOTERS 
More than three-quarters of states offer 
some in-person early voting, but the number 
of days of availability varies across the na-
tion. Despite the widespread, successful, se-
cure use of early in-person voting in states 
across the country, early voting options 
have become the target of suppressive re-
strictions in the post-Shelby era. 
Cutbacks and restrictions on opportunities 
to vote outside of what is considered tradi-
tional Election Day voting places a dis-
proportionate burden on minority voters. 
Options such as early voting, mail-in voting, 
curbside voting, and drop boxes for ballot re-
turn all increase voter participation and 
were used at increasing rates by minority 
voters during the 2020 primary and general 
election. 
Danielle Lang, Director of the Voting 
Rights Program at the Campaign Legal Cen-
ter testified that, in 2020, polls showed that 
Black voters were the most likely to cast an 
early ballot and in 2016, Latino voters were 
the most likely to cast an early ballot. Yet, 
without the requirement of preclearance to 
study and analyze changes in opportunities 
to vote for disparate impact, each of these 
voting options have become the target of 
suppressive and discriminatory cutbacks by 
state legislatures across the country. 
Dr. Pettigrew testified before the Sub-
committee that the number of options and 
opportunities voters have to cast their bal-
lots is also a major contributor to the length 
of lines at the polls, a burden that the pre-
vious section of this report clearly dem-
onstrated falls disproportionately upon mi-
nority voters. Increasing hours of operation 
at polling places, increasing the number of 
days of early voting, and providing broader 
access to mail-in voting all decrease line 
length and provide voters with opportunities 
to participate in democracy that meet them 
where they are in their daily lives. 
Early In-Person Voting 
Dr. Michael Herron of Dartmouth College 
testified before the Subcommittee that op-
tions such as early in-person voting are a 
form of ‘‘convenience voting,’’ the imple-
mentation of which decreases the cost of vot-
ing for the voter. Dr. Herron explains that 
‘‘cost’’ in this sense ‘‘refers not necessarily 
to a monetary cost of participating in an 
election that would be borne by an indi-
vidual but rather to the time, effort, and 
tasks that a voter must perform in order to 
vote.’’ As he explained further, ‘‘[t]he higher 
the cost of voting in a state, the lower the 
turnout tends to be, all things equal.’’ 
Dr. Herron testified that early voting has 
expanded across the United States over the 
past several decades and, in this same time 
period, has been heavily used by minority 
voters. Dr. Herron testified that, ‘‘[c]ertain 
types of voters tend to use different days of 
early voting,’’ and for this reason, ‘‘changes 
to election administration procedures that 
affect precisely when early voting is of-
fered—i.e., on weekdays only as opposed to 
on both weekdays and weekends—will affect 
different racial groups differently.’’ He testi-
fied further that, ‘‘changes to early voting 
hours that reduce pre-Election Day, Sunday 
voting opportunities should be expected to 
disproportionately affect Black voters’’ and 
that, if a state were to eliminate Sunday 
early voting, ‘‘the cost of voting for Black 
voters would disproportionately increase 
compared to White voters given the rel-
atively heavy use of Sunday early voting by 
Black voters.’’ 
One of the most striking examples of how 
changes and cutbacks to opportunities to

vote can be wielded to disenfranchise minor-
ity voters comes again from North Carolina’s 
2013 omnibus voting bill, dubbed the ‘‘mon-
ster law.’’ A study co-authored by Dr. Herron 
examining the discriminatory impact of the 
state’s 2013 voting law, which, among other 
restrictions, cut 10 days of early voting, 
eliminated same-day voter registration, and 
eliminated out-of-precinct voting and was 
enacted within days of the Supreme Court’s 
decision in Shelby County, found that in vir-
tually every election between 2009 and 2012, 
Black voters disproportionately relied on 
early voting relative to White voters. Ac-
cordingly, the law’s restrictions on early 
voting disproportionately burdened Black 
voters. 
The North Carolina law specifically tar-
geted one of two ‘‘Souls to the Polls’’ Sun-
days, early voting events traditionally held 
the Sunday before Election Day and heavily 
utilized by Black faith communities to get 
voters to the polls. The omnibus law was 
found by the courts to have targeted African 
American voters with ‘‘almost surgical pre-
cision.’’ As Ms. Lang noted in her testimony, 
the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals labeled 
the restriction on Sunday voting ‘‘as close to 
a smoking gun as we are likely to see in 
modern times.’’ 
Allison Riggs of the Southern Coalition for 
Social Justice testified that North Carolina’s 
attacks on early voting access did not end 
with the 2013 law. In 2018, North Carolina’s 
legislature enacted a separate law requiring 
all 100 counties within the state to offer uni-
form voting hours. While sounding innocuous 
in theory, in practice it: 
‘‘[H]ad a terrible effect on the ability of 
voters, particularly those of color, to get to 
a polling place. After the enactment of the 
‘‘uniform hours requirement,’’ 43 of North 
Carolina’s 100 counties eliminated at least 
one early voting site, almost half reduced 
the number of weekend days when early vot-
ing was offered, and about two-thirds re-
duced the number of weekend hours, com-
pared to 2014.’’ 
Tomas Lopez of Democracy North Carolina 
testified before the Subcommittee in 2019 
that, 
‘‘this 
has 
produced 
several 
con-
sequences in practice . . . [o]f the eight 
counties where a majority of voters are 
Black, four reduced sites, seven reduced 
weekend days, and all eight reduced the 
number of weekend hours during early vot-
ing. None saw increases in sites or weekend 
options.’’ 
Like North Carolina, Florida has engaged 
in a lengthy effort to restrict voting options 
predominately used by minority voters. A 
study co-authored by Dr. Herron, analyzing 
differential use of early voting in Florida, 
found that Black voters disproportionately 
voted early relative to White voters. Ms. 
Lang testified that, in 2011, Florida’s legisla-
ture passed a bill eliminating Sunday voting 
on the Sunday immediately preceding Elec-
tion Day—the bill coming after data from 
the 2008 Presidential election showed that: 
‘‘Across all early voting days, the two days 
that featured the lowest white participation 
rates . . . both were Sundays, but on the 
first Sunday of early voting, the racial and 
ethnic group with the highest relative par-
ticipation rate was African-American voters. 
And on the last Sunday, the group with the 
highest relative participation rate was His-
panic voters, followed by African-American 
voters.’’ 
Because of Black voters’ disproportionate 
reliance on early voting, scholars found that 
Florida’s restriction on access to early vot-
ing in 2012 meant that ‘‘racial and ethnic mi-
norities . . . were far disproportionately less 
likely to vote early in 2012 than in 2008.’’ 
That was particularly true because African 
American voters were disproportionately 
likely to vote on the final Sunday before 
Election Day, which was among the early 
voting days eliminated by the law, as part of 
‘‘Souls to the Polls’’ get-out-the-vote efforts. 
Also in Florida, in July 2018, a federal 
court struck down a state ban on early vot-
ing at public colleges. Hannah Fried, Na-
tional Campaign Director of All Voting is 
Local, testified before the Subcommittee in 
October 2019 that a post-election analysis 
published by the Andrew Goodman Founda-
tion found that ‘‘nearly 60,000 voters cast 
early in-person ballots at campus sites that 
advocates, including [All Voting is Local], 
helped secure’’ in the aftermath of the 
court’s decision, however, Florida’s only 
public historically Black university was the 
only major public campus without an early 
voting site. 
An examination of on-campus early voting 
in the 2018 election performed by Professor 
Daniel Smith of the University of Florida 
found high rates of campus early voting 
among Hispanic and Black voters. Moreover, 
Professor Smith found high rates of campus 
early 
voting 
among 
historically 
disenfranchised groups, including: 
‘‘[A]lmost 30 percent of campus early vote 
ballots were cast by Hispanic voters, com-
pared to just under 13 percent of early bal-
lots cast at non-campus locations, and that 
more than 22 percent of campus early vote 
ballots were cast by Black voters, compared 
to 18 percent of early ballots cast at non- 
campus locations.’’ 
Ms. Lang testified that, in 2014, data from 
Georgia and North Carolina similarly showed 
that 53 percent of 25,000 early votes cast on 
the second Sunday before Election Day were 
from Black voters, compared with 27 percent 
of the votes cast by all early voters in the 
2014 midterm elections. 
In Texas, just before the 2018 election, the 
NAACP Legal Defense Fund filed a motion 
for a temporary restraining order on behalf 
of Black students at the historically Black 
university Prairie View A&M University 
(‘‘PVAMU’’) in Waller County, Texas. In 2018, 
the students sought to stop cuts to early vot-
ing hours, which would have left Prairie 
View without any early voting opportunities 
on weekends, evenings, or during the first 
week of early voting. 
Janai Nelson, Associate Director-Counsel 
of LDF, testified to the Subcommittee that 
county officials refused the student requests 
to provide adequate early voting sites or 
hours and that County officials have ‘‘long 
discriminated 
against 
Black 
voters 
at 
PVAMU and in the majority—Black City of 
Prairie View, dating back to at least the 
early 1970s.’’ In response to LDF’s ongoing 
case, however, county officials agreed in 2018 
to add several hours of early voting in Prai-
rie View. LDF continues to litigate this case 
under its Section 2, Fourteenth, Fifteenth, 
and Twenty-sixth Amendment claims on be-
half of PVAMU students who were still de-
nied equal and adequate voting opportunities 
in the election under the modified plan and 
parties are awaiting the trial court’s deci-
sion. 
In yet another example, in Dodge City, 
Kansas, voting was limited in 2018 to one 
polling location, which was outside of town 
and inaccessible via public transportation— 
Dodge City’s population is ‘‘60 percent His-
panic, and the voter turnout among Latinx 
voters is lower than the national average.’’ 
Alejandro Rangel-Lopez, a high school stu-
dent from Dodge City, testified before the 
Committee in 2019 that: 
‘‘Dodge City only had one polling place for 
nearly 13,000 voters and while that’s bad 
enough to make it one of the most burdened 
polling places in our state, it was at the very 
least, centrally located, which can’t be said 
about the location chosen for the 2018 mid-
term election. That new location was south 
of town, outside the city limits. Worse, the 
county clerk sent out the wrong location ad-
dress to new voters. [T]his new site wasn’t 
accessible by public transportation before we 
raised concerns. We believed these factors 
would negatively impact minority and low- 
income voters . . . We rely on our elected of-
ficials to make the right choices and for a 
county clerk, that job was to make voting as 
easy as possible in the county she represents. 
Unfortunately, that’s not what happened. 
The clerk spent nearly $100,000 of taxpayer 
money for legal fees fighting our efforts to 
make polling places more accessible.’’ 
In Ohio, in addition to other cuts to voting 
opportunities, the state allows each county 
only one early, in-person voting site, regard-
less of population size—meaning Franklin 
and Cuyahoga Counties, home to Columbus 
and Cleveland, with populations of more 
than 1.2 million people each and significant 
populations of Black voters, are allotted the 
same, single early voting site as the smallest 
counties in the state, some of which are 
home to less than 15,000 people. Inajo Davis 
Chappell, a Member of the Cuyahoga County 
Board of Elections, testified before the Sub-
committee in 2019 that, ‘‘[b]ecause of the 
limit to this one location, voting lines are 
long, especially during the presidential elec-
tion cycle. During periods of heavy voting, 
long lines can be seen wrapped around the 
building and down the street for several 
blocks.’’ 
LDF’s 
report, 
Democracy 
Diminished, 
notes an example of a Georgia state legis-
lator making the intent behind his opposi-
tion to certain early voting in minority com-
munities clear—when an early voting site 
was opening near a popular mall in Dekalb 
County in 2014, a state senator responded 
that ‘‘this location is dominated by African 
American shoppers and it is near several 
large African American mega churches,’’ and 
that he would ‘‘prefer more educated voters 
than a greater increase in the number of vot-
ers.’’ 
Cuts to early voting locations and opportu-
nities to vote also negatively impact the 
ability of Native American voters to access 
the ballot. In NARF’s 2020 report on obsta-
cles faced by Native American voters, they 
state that early voting can be a positive 
force for Native voters, if it accounts for the 
barriers that they face in participating in 
non-tribal elections—when officials coordi-
nate with tribal governments and schools to 
provide information about voting locations 
and schedule, it can improve turnout. 
Professor Ferguson-Bohnee testified that, 
while some election administrations are 
willing to work with tribes to increase ac-
cess, others are not. The Pascua Yaqui Tribe 
in Arizona, for example, filed a lawsuit to re-
store the in-person early voting location on 
the reservation—and ‘‘[w]hile Pima County 
noted that the voting location would have 
cost $5,000 to operate, and the Secretary of 
State was willing to cover the cost, the 
County denied the Tribe an early voting lo-
cation.’’ Professor Ferguson-Bohnee stated 
that, without the early voting location, ‘‘on- 
reservation voters who lacked a vehicle were 
required to take a two-hour roundtrip bus 
ride to cast an early ballot.’’ 
In South Dakota, a federal district court 
found that Pine Ridge Reservation residents 
‘‘must travel, on average, twice as far as 
White residents to take advantage of the 
voter registration and in-person absentee 
voting services.’’ In another example, NARF 
reported that, in Oklahoma, there is often 
only one early voting location per county— 
in the county seat—which is often not acces-
sible for Native voters living in outlying 
areas, and ‘‘in the poorest areas of Nevada, 
where several reservations are located, no

early voting or satellite voting locations 
were established.’’ 
Furthermore, in the 2016 general election 
in Arizona, there were a total of 89 early vot-
ing locations, only 23 of which were on res-
ervations. While off-reservation locations 
were open for multiple days, in contrast, 
early voting locations on the White Moun-
tain Apache and San Carlos Apache reserva-
tions had only one day to vote early in-per-
son, and only four hours on that one day. 
Professor 
Ferguson-Bohnee’s 
testimony 
stated that, in Mohave County, Arizona, the 
county established three in-person early vot-
ing sites, and while most residents of the 
County lived near one of the locations, for 
the Kaibab-Paiute Tribe, the closet of the 
three locations was ‘‘located 285 miles away 
and required on-reservation voters to travel 
for over five hours if they wanted to vote 
early in-person.’’ In Navajo County, off-res-
ervation voters had access to more than 100 
hours of in-person early voting—while mem-
bers of the Hopi Tribe living on-reservation 
in the County had access to only six hours of 
in-person early voting. That represents only 
six percent of the amount of in-person voting 
opportunities on-reservation voters could ac-
cess compared with off-reservation voters. 
Increasing the options for how voters can 
vote early in-person can also increase voter 
participation and participation of minority 
voters. For example, Isabel Longoria, Elec-
tions 
Administrator 
for 
Harris 
County, 
Texas—home to Houston and the third larg-
est county in the country—testified that the 
historic turnout of 1.68 million voters Harris 
County experienced in the November 2020 
election was driven by innovative voting op-
portunities such as drive-thru voting (128,000 
votes), 24-hour voting (16,000 votes), and a ro-
bust mail ballot program (179,000 votes), and 
that these methods of voting ‘‘helped pro-
mote voting in minority communities, which 
helped create a more accurate representa-
tion of communities in the county.’’ 
Ms. Longoria testified that during the July 
2020 and November 2020 elections, Harris 
County also kept its polls open until 10:00 
p.m. on two evenings and open the entire 
night one evening. Ms. Longoria testified 
that, of the Harris County voters who used 
expanded hours, 45 percent came from State 
House districts that are majority or plu-
rality Black, Hispanic, or mixed-race dis-
tricts. 
Harris County also opened multiple drive- 
thru voting sites that provided voting on the 
same machines and in the same manner as 
voting at all other in-person locations. Of 
the voters who used in-person drive-thru vot-
ing, 60 percent came from the majority or 
plurality Black, Hispanic, or mixed-race 
State House districts. Though only 38 per-
cent of early voters in the 2020 Presidential 
election were Black, Latino, or Asian, 53 per-
cent of those communities used drive-thru 
voting. However, instead of promoting and 
celebrating these opportunities to vote, state 
legislators in Texas are also pursuing a sup-
pressive voting bill that would undermine 
many of these alternative methods of voting. 
Gilda Daniels, Director of Litigation at the 
Advancement Project, testified that voting 
statistics show that, in the November 2020 
general election, Black voters in Georgia 
also used early voting on weekends at a 
higher rate than White voters in 43 of 50 of 
the state’s largest counties. That is 86 per-
cent of the largest counties. The state also 
recently passed a restrictive bill that, among 
numerous troubling provisions, takes aim at 
access to early voting. 
Mail-in Voting and Ballot Return 
Whether cast via the mail, returned via a 
ballot drop box, or returned at a polling 
place, mail-in voting is another opportunity 
to vote that gives voters control over when 
and how to cast their ballot that increases 
access to the franchise. Equitable mail-in 
voting practices increase voter participa-
tion; however, both restrictions on mail-in 
voting and mail-in voting implementation 
can be executed in a manner that is discrimi-
natory toward minority voters or dispropor-
tionately burdens minority voters. Ms. Lang 
testified that ‘‘[a]bsentee voting is one of the 
most accessible, equitable, and secure meth-
ods of voting that states can implement.’’ 
However, access to mail-in voting options is 
highly uneven—from 5 states that conduct 
vote-by-mail elections, to many who offer 
no-excuse absentee voting, to the 16 states 
that continue to limit access to mail-in vot-
ing options, locking many voters out of this 
option. 
Use of mail-in voting increased signifi-
cantly during the November 2020 election— 
approximately 43 percent of voters cast mail- 
in ballots, roughly twice the percentage of 
voters who cast mail-in ballots in the 2016 
general election. 
Dr. Herron testified that this increase was 
not uniform across racial groups. For exam-
ple, Dr. Herron noted that the shift in the 
mail-in voting rate in Florida for Black vot-
ers increased from almost 21 percent to 
around 39 percent, an 89 percent increase, 
while the rate for White voters went from 31 
percent to 44 percent, a 43 percent increase. 
Dr. Herron testified that, while it remains to 
be seen whether mail-in voting usage will re-
turn to pre-pandemic levels, ‘‘[c]hanges to 
[vote-by-mail] voting procedures should not 
[be] expected to be racially neutral any more 
than changes to early voting procedures.’’ 
The inequitable access to mail-in voting 
options and different eligibility rules were 
put in stark relief during the 2020 election, a 
presidential primary and general election 
conducted during a once-in-a-century pan-
demic. For example, Ms. Lang testified that 
Texas’s restrictions on eligibility for re-
questing and casting an absentee ballot 
‘‘den[ies] the majority of Texans the ability 
to vote by mail—particularly Latino and 
younger voters.’’ Ms. Lang testified that 
‘‘Latino voters in Texas are significantly 
younger than the average Texas voting popu-
lation, which means they are disproportion-
ately unable to avail themselves of the over- 
65 exception to the absentee eligibility cri-
teria.’’ In May 2020, in Texas, CLC moved to 
intervene on behalf of the League of United 
Latin American Citizens (LULAC) in a law-
suit filed by the Texas Democratic Party 
challenging Texas’s vote-by-mail eligibility 
restrictions—the case remains pending in 
federal court. 
Some states have also erected unduly bur-
densome requirements for casting absentee 
ballots that make the option illusory for 
many voters. For example, Alabama requires 
voters to send an application for an absentee 
ballot for every election to a special absen-
tee election manager for the county, includ-
ing a photocopy of their voter ID, and then 
return the ballot with a notary signature or 
the signature of two witnesses. In Mis-
sissippi, the application to vote by mail-in 
ballot must be notarized. 
In another example, Ms. Lang testified 
that ‘‘[f]rom start to finish, Tennessee 
makes vote by mail unduly difficult and in-
accessible.’’ CLC has several lawsuits pend-
ing in Tennessee, two of them, Ms. Lang 
notes, particularly relevant to minority vot-
ers’ opportunities to vote. CLC is chal-
lenging Tennessee’s strict limitations on 
who can vote by mail and the state’s failure 
to allow voters to fix issues with their absen-
tee ballots after they are rejected due to a 
perceived signature mismatch. 
Additionally, Tennessee law does not allow 
most first-time voters to vote by mail even 
if they otherwise qualify under the state’s 
strict eligibility criteria. Ms. Lang testified 
that, ‘‘[t]hus, new voters—who are dispropor-
tionately young and of color—are locked out 
of absentee voting even when they have no 
way to present themselves to vote in per-
son.’’ Allison Riggs of the Southern Coali-
tion for Social Justice testified that ‘‘[t]he 
five states that did not allow unfettered ac-
cess to vote-by-mail in 2020—Tennessee, 
Texas, Mississippi, Indiana, and Louisiana— 
were in the bottom 10 in turnout country-
wide.’’ 
Additionally, when a voter does vote by 
mail-in ballot, often there is no guarantee 
the ballot will be counted, as election offi-
cials often have the discretion to reject a 
ballot if they perceive discrepancies in the 
voter’s signature. Ms. Lang testified that 
‘‘signature matching’’ has been shown to 
‘‘disproportionately discount the ballots of 
voters with disabilities, older voters, and 
voters who are non-native English speakers 
or racial minorities.’’ Ms. Diaz of the UCLA 
Latino Policy and Politics Initiative also 
testified that, ‘‘signature matching require-
ments for mail ballots create a potential to 
disenfranchise 
Latino 
voters’’ 
and 
‘‘[u]ltimately, mandatory signature match-
ing is likely to have a disproportionate ef-
fect on the young, elderly, disabled, racial/ 
ethnic minorities, and limited English pro-
ficient voters.’’ 
If not implemented in conjunction with in- 
person voting options and in consultation 
with tribal governments, mail-in voting can 
replicate many of the same barriers and dis-
tance issues faced by Native voters. A lack of 
traditional addresses, inconsistent access to 
postal services, and distance all create bar-
riers to fully accessing mail-in voting for 
many Native American voters. 
The use of drop boxes or allowing a third- 
party to return a voter’s mail-in ballot have 
also been the target of restrictions in recent 
years. Ms. Lang testified that last year, ap-
proximately 41 percent of voters who voted 
absentee used ballot drop boxes, just 3 per-
cent less than the percentage of voters who 
returned their ballot using the Postal Serv-
ice. Yet, despite widespread, secure usage of 
drop boxes, states such as Texas moved to re-
strict the ability of voters to return their 
ballots via drop box—during the election the 
Governor of Texas issued an order restricting 
counties to one drop box per county and forc-
ing counties that had deployed more than 
one to remove them. 
Ms. Lang testified that ‘‘[t]his eleventh- 
hour decision to limit access to safe ballot 
drop-off locations so close to the election 
sowed mass confusion. Moreover, it dis-
proportionately affected Black and Latino 
voters living in major metro areas and vot-
ers who were entitled to vote by mail be-
cause they were older or had disabilities.’’ 
The Governor’s order forced highly populous, 
majority-minority 
counties 
like 
Harris 
County, which has 4.7 million residents 
(more than 26 states) to cut their drop off lo-
cations from the 12 they had set up over 
roughly 1,700 square miles to one. These re-
strictions harmed minority voters in both 
populous counties and rural counties like 
majority-minority Brewster County on the 
Texas-Mexico border. 
A lack of convenient access to drop boxes 
to return mail-in ballots was a consistent 
barrier for Native voters, as noted in NARF’s 
2020 report. All too often, drop boxes are lo-
cated off tribal lands, in some cases great 
distances from Native American commu-
nities. Bans on ballot returnalso dispropor-
tionately harm Native American voters. 
Many Native Americans rely on P.O. boxes 
that are often far from their homes. As de-
tailed by NARF, families commonly ‘‘pool’’ 
their mail, meaning ‘‘one person who is

going to town would collect it for everyone 
else to drop off at the post office.’’ 
Also, some people who cannot afford a P.O. 
box will have their mail sent to someone else 
who does have one, meaning if the mail con-
tains an early ballot, depending on the law, 
that neighbor could be implicated in a 
banned ballot collection practice. NARF, 
along with the ACLU and the ACLU of Mon-
tana is currently challenging two new Mon-
tana laws that hinder Native American par-
ticipation in voting, including one that at-
tempts to block organized ballot collection 
on rural reservations. In September 2020, a 
Montana court permanently struck down a 
different state law, the so-called Montana 
Ballot Interference Prevention Act (BIPA), 
which imposed severe restrictions on ballot 
collection efforts critical to Native Ameri-
cans living on rural reservations. In its 
order, the court held that the costs borne by 
Native American communities associated 
with BIPA were ‘‘simply too high and too 
burdensome to remain the law of the State 
of Montana.’’ 
Recent Attacks on Opportunities to Vote 
Despite the record-setting voter turnout 
experienced in 2020 and the secure nature in 
which the election was conducted, attacks 
on opportunities to vote are well underway 
in many states. According to the Brennan 
Center for Justice, at least 16 mail voting re-
strictions in 12 states will make it more dif-
ficult to cast mail ballots that are counted 
and at least 8 states have enacted 11 laws 
that make in-person voting more difficult. 
According to the Brennan Center’s state law 
roundup: 
‘‘Three states have limited the availability 
of polling places: Montana permitted more 
locations to qualify for reduced polling place 
hours; Iowa reduced its Election Day hours, 
shortened the early voting period, and lim-
ited election officials’ discretion to offer ad-
ditional early voting locations; and Georgia 
reduced early voting in many counties by 
standardizing early voting days and hours.’’ 
In Florida, Governor Ron DeSantis signed 
into law a bill that makes it more difficult 
to vote by mail-in ballot and makes it harder 
for voters to access secure drop boxes. On 
May 6, 2021, the NAACP LDF filed a lawsuit 
on behalf of the Florida State Conference of 
the NAACP, Disability Rights Florida, and 
Common Cause, challenging many of the pro-
visions in SB 90 (2021), including new ID re-
quirements for requesting mail-in ballots, 
new requirements for standing mail-in appli-
cations, limitations on the use of drop boxes, 
and others—this litigation is pending. 
As noted earlier in this section, Repub-
licans in the Texas state legislature are 
pushing a bill that would put limitations on 
early voting hours (including Sunday early 
voting), increase restrictions on vote-by- 
mail, and curb voting options such as drive- 
thru voting. This proposed law comes after 
an election cycle in which, despite the ongo-
ing pandemic, the Governor limited the num-
ber of drop-off locations for mail-in ballots 
to one site per county via proclamation, 
forcing Harris County, for example, to cut 
their drop-off locations from 12 to 1, Repub-
licans attempted to preemptively throw out 
more than 125,000 early voting ballots from 
drive-thru polling sites in Harris County (the 
state’s most populous county) via court chal-
lenge; and refused to expand eligibility for 
no-excuse absentee voting. 
According to the Texas Tribune, Senate 
Bill (SB) 7 takes aim at opportunities to vote 
used by minority voters, ‘‘[p]ortions of the 
bill were specifically written to target vot-
ing initiatives Harris County used in the last 
election—such as a day of 24-hour early vot-
ing, drive-thru voting, and an effort to 
proactively distribute applications to vote 
by mail—that were heavily used by voters of 
color. But under SB 7, those options will be 
banned across the state.’’ Ms. Longoria testi-
fied that SB 7 would have prohibited the 
Elections Administrator from opening the 
polls before 6:00 a.m. or after 9:00 p.m. on 
weekdays or Saturday—a prohibition that 
would ‘‘disproportionately hurt voters of 
color, particularly those who are Black and 
Hispanic.’’ 
Despite failing to pass SB 7 in the regular 
legislative session, the Texas Legislature 
began a special session on July 8, 2021, in 
which both the House and Senate revived 
separate proposals (Senate Bill 1 and House 
Bill 3) that would enact restrictions on op-
portunities to vote such as outlawing the 
drive-thru voting option utilized by Harris 
County, regulating early voting hours to pre-
empt expanded early voting opportunities 
such as 24-hour voting, and prohibiting local 
election officials from sending unsolicited 
mail-in ballot applications, among others. 
Ms. Riggs testified that, once again, under 
the guise of ‘‘election integrity,’’ the North 
Carolina legislature is responding to the 2020 
election by introducing bills that would re-
strict access to voting options. Ms. Riggs 
testified that one troubling bill moving 
through the legislature is Senate Bill (SB) 
326, which would ‘‘[w]ith no justification’’ re-
quire voters to submit an absentee ballot re-
quest form earlier than was required in 2020, 
and would require all civilian absentee bal-
lots to be received no later than 5:00 p.m. on 
Election Day to be counted— currently bal-
lots postmarked by Election Day and re-
ceived no later than three days after Elec-
tion Day are counted. In analyzing data from 
the 2020 election, Ms. Riggs testified that, 
‘‘SCSJ internal data show that in the first 
few days after Election Day in 2020, Black 
voters’ ballots represented a significant per-
centage of those ballots received when com-
pared to White voters’ ballots (where race 
was designated)’’ and ‘‘[t]o be clear, all these 
voters who relied on the United States Post-
al Service would be disenfranchised under 
the new law. But the harm to Black voters, 
whose participation rate has dropped below 
the rate seen in 2008 and 2012, is very trou-
bling.’’ 
In March 2021, on the heels of record voter 
turnout in the November 2020 general elec-
tion and January 2021 run-off election, the 
State of Georgia also enacted a suppressive 
voting law that makes cuts to voting oppor-
tunities, which will disproportionately im-
pact minority voters. 
Ms. Nelson of LDF testified that LDF, 
along with several partners, filed suit in the 
U.S. District Court for the Northern District 
of Georgia challenging Georgia’s SB 202 for 
intentional racial discrimination and dis-
criminatory results under Section 2 of the 
VRA, 
intentional 
racial 
discrimination 
under the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amend-
ments, as an unconstitutional burden on the 
right to vote under the First and Fourteenth 
Amendments, and as an unconstitutional 
burden on the right to freedom of speech and 
expression under the First Amendment. 
The Justice Department has also filed suit 
against the State of Georgia, the Georgia 
Secretary of State, and the Georgia State 
Elections Board over the newly enacted law, 
challenging provisions of the law under Sec-
tion 2 of the VRA. The Justice Department’s 
complaint argues that several provisions of 
SB 202 were ‘‘adopted with the purpose of de-
nying or abridging the right to vote on ac-
count of race.’’ The suit further alleges that 
‘‘the cumulative and discriminatory effect of 
these laws—particularly on Black voters— 
was known to lawmakers and that law-
makers adopted the law despite this.’’ 
CONCLUSION 
Americans no longer vote solely on a sin-
gle Tuesday. For millions of Americans, 
Election Day-only voting is impractical or 
inaccessible. Increasing access to opportuni-
ties to vote benefits all voters and increases 
participation in our democratic process—but 
targeted restrictions on these opportunities 
disproportionately and discriminatorily bur-
den minority voters. As Ms. Lang testified, 
‘‘[t]he early in-person voting options are 
wildly uneven nationwide. While some Amer-
icans enjoy a broad range of voting opportu-
nities, others face increasing constraints on 
their voting options.’’ 
Cuts to early in-person voting, especially 
Sunday voting, and a lack of adequate early 
voting sites serves to disenfranchise minor-
ity voters and, in some cases, has been shown 
to be enacted with discriminatory intent. 
Additionally, mail-in voting is a safe, secure, 
and critical option for many voters, but if 
enacted with unreasonable and discrimina-
tory barriers, can remain out of reach for 
many minority voters. Finally, attacks on 
alternative opportunities for returning a bal-
lot have a discriminatory impact of many 
minority voters. 
The evidence before the Subcommittee is 
clear—cuts to early voting, limiting the 
availability of early voting options, undue 
restrictions on mail-in ballots, and un-
founded restrictions on ballot return options 
erect discriminatory barriers to voting. 
CHAPTER
EIGHT—CHANGES
TO
METHODS
OF 
ELECTION, JURISDICTIONAL BOUNDARIES, AND 
REDISTRICTING 
BACKGROUND 
Discriminatory practices in, and changes 
to, methods of election, jurisdictional bound-
aries, and redistricting impact whether vot-
ers can elect representatives that reflect 
their voices and communities. Discrimina-
tory redistricting, vote dilution, annex-
ations, deannexations, drawing of jurisdic-
tional boundaries, and changes to the meth-
od of election all affect elections and rep-
resentation ranging from local-level school 
boards to state courts and Congressional 
seats. 
Shelby County v. Holder itself began as a 
change to jurisdictional boundaries and the 
method of election for a local city council 
seat. There, the city attempted to change 
the district lines for the Calera City Council 
in Calera, Shelby County, Alabama. In re-
drawing the district lines, the voting popu-
lation for Voting District 2 changed dramati-
cally, bringing in hundreds of White voters, 
cutting the proportion of Black voters from 
more than two-thirds to one-third. 
At the time, Alabama was subject to state-
wide preclearance under Section 5 of the 
VRA and the new district map was subject to 
review and approval by the Justice Depart-
ment. The DOJ was not persuaded that the 
new map would not discriminate against 
Black voters and voided the new map. The 
day after the DOJ struck down the map, 
Calera held a previously scheduled city coun-
cil election under the now-voided map in 
which Ernest Montgomery, the District 2 
representative and the only African Amer-
ican on the five-member city council, was 
voted out of office. The DOJ blocked certifi-
cation of the election results pending a new 
vote. 
After a year of negotiation, Calera got rid 
of its district map, moving instead to a six- 
seat ‘‘at-large’’ council and in a new elec-
tion, Ernest Montgomery won one of the 
seats. These circumstances served as the 
predicate for lawyers to bring suit chal-
lenging the constitutionality of the coverage 
formula and preclearance regime of the VRA. 
The Voting Rights Act of 1965 prohibits not 
only discrimination in the denial of access to 
the ballot, but also in dilution of voters, 
such as the way district lines are drawn to 
dilute the ability of voters of color to elect

their preferred candidate. Voting changes 
that were once covered by Section 5 in-
cluded, among others: 
‘‘(d) Any change in the boundaries of vot-
ing precincts or in the location of polling 
places. (e) Any change in the constituency of 
an official or the boundaries of a voting unit 
(e.g., 
through 
redistricting, 
annexation, 
deannexation, 
incorporation, 
dissolution, 
merger, reapportionment, changing to at- 
large elections from district elections, or 
changing to district elections from at-large 
elections). (f) Any change in the method of 
determining the outcome of an election (e.g., 
by requiring a majority vote for election or 
the use of a designated post or place sys-
tem).’’ 
Additionally, the redistricting process can 
and has been used to deny political power 
and equal representation to minority popu-
lations. 
As 
discussed 
below, 
without 
proactive protections against discriminatory 
redistricting, it can take years to litigate a 
redistricting case. While a case winds its way 
through the courts, numerous elections can 
take place under a map that is later found to 
be discriminatory and invalid. 
States are entering the first federal decen-
nial redistricting cycle without the full pro-
tections of the Voting Rights Act since its 
enactment in 1965. Without proactive protec-
tions to ensure district lines are not drawn 
in a discriminatory manner, voters could be 
forced to go to the polls under maps that 
years later, through lengthy and costly liti-
gation, are found to be discriminatory and 
invalid. 
The 
evidence 
presented 
to 
the 
Sub-
committee demonstrates conclusively that 
changes to methods of election, alterations 
to 
jurisdictional 
boundaries, 
and 
redis-
tricting can and do disproportionately and 
discriminatorily impact minority voters and 
can be, in some cases, wielded with discrimi-
natory intent. 
THE
DISPROPORTIONATE
AND
DISCRIMINATORY 
BURDEN AND IMPACT ON MINORITY VOTERS OF 
CHANGES TO METHODS OF ELECTION, JURIS-
DICTIONAL BOUNDARIES, AND REDISTRICTING 
There is a long, documented history of 
methods of election, altering jurisdiction 
boundaries, and redistricting processes being 
used to discriminate against, dilute the vot-
ing power of, and effectively disenfranchise 
minority voters. Since Reconstruction and 
the rise of Jim Crow, as Black, Latino, Indig-
enous, and Asian American communities 
gained access to the franchise, overcame bar-
riers to voting, and gained political power 
and voting strength, they have been met 
with suppressive tactics meant to dilute 
their votes and ensure voting power for the 
shrinking majority. 
A November 2019 report on discriminatory 
voting 
practices 
produced 
by 
AAJC, 
MALDEF, and NALEO noted that, for exam-
ple, since 1957, ‘‘there have been at least 1,753 
legal and advocacy actions that successfully 
overturned a discriminatory change in meth-
od of election because of its discriminatory 
intent or effects.’’ The report also cites that 
at least 219 annexations or deannexations 
have been challenged and invalidated by a 
court or the DOJ, or amended or withdrawn. 
Additionally, according to the report, since 
1957, 982 redistricting plans were challenged 
and invalidated by a court or the DOJ or 
amended or withdrawn because of their dis-
criminatory intent or effects. 
Professor Patty Ferguson-Bohnee testified 
that, before Shelby County, the Department 
of Justice issued nine Section 5 objections to 
redistricting plans involving Native voters in 
Alaska, Arizona, and South Dakota—five of 
those were in Arizona. Additionally, since 
1966, 22 federal cases challenging at-large 
election systems, redistricting lines, or mal-
apportionment have been filed on behalf of 
Native voters, including state legislative dis-
tricts, school boards, counties, sanitation 
districts, and city councils. Of these 22 cases, 
6 were brought by the Department of Jus-
tice. 
Thomas Saenz of MALDEF testified before 
the Subcommittee that Latino voters have 
also seen attempts to limit the growth of 
their voting power, including ‘‘the perpetua-
tion or re-introduction of at-large voting or 
the failure to acknowledge and incorporate 
the growth of the Latino community in the 
decennial 
redistricting 
process.’’ 
Asian 
Americans have also seen the district draw-
ing process used in attempts to dilute their 
voting power. 
Black voters have long-experienced at-
tacks on their voting power through vote di-
lution, annexations, redrawing jurisdictional 
boundaries, and discriminatory redistricting 
maps. As Justice Kagan noted in her 
Brnovich dissent, following the passage of 
the VRA: 
‘‘The crudest attempts to block voting ac-
cess, like literacy tests and poll taxes, dis-
appeared. Legislatures often replaced those 
vote denial schemes with new measures— 
mostly to do with districting—designed to 
dilute the impact of minority votes. But the 
Voting Rights Act, operating for decades at 
full strength, stopped many of those meas-
ures too.’’ 
In the immediate aftermath of Shelby 
County, states and localities redistricted, 
drawing new lines, or changing the method 
of election from neighborhood seats to at- 
large districts, in ways ‘‘guaranteed to re-
duce minority representation.’’ 
CHANGES TO METHOD OF ELECTION AND 
JURISDICTIONAL BOUNDARIES 
Altering methods of election and jurisdic-
tional boundaries has long been used to dis-
criminate against minority voters and dilute 
voting power. In definitional terms, ‘‘method 
of election’’ refers to ‘‘the system for elect-
ing members of a body and may include fea-
tures affecting the size and composition of 
the electorate that votes for a given seat, 
the timing of election for certain seats, and 
the number or percentage of votes required 
to win an election.’’ 
At-large elections occur when representa-
tives are elected from one large district si-
multaneously, rather than at the community 
level through local, single-member districts. 
Janai Nelson of the NAACP Legal Defense 
Fund testified that ‘‘[a]t-large elections can 
allow 51 percent of voters to control 100 per-
cent of the seats on an elected body, which, 
in the presence of racially polarized voting 
and other structures, can dilute a racial mi-
nority group’s voice in the electoral sys-
tem.’’ Multi-member elections occur when a 
jurisdiction is divided up into districts and, 
in each, voters all vote for each of the mul-
tiple seats. Shifts to these two methods can 
be used to dilute the voting power of minor-
ity communities and prevent them from 
electing representatives of their choosing. 
In addition to altering the method of elec-
tion, 
tactics 
such 
as 
annexations, 
deannexations, 
or 
shifting 
jurisdictional 
boundaries dilute the political power of mi-
nority voters by selectively altering the ra-
cial and ethnic makeup of the electorate. 
In one of the first lawsuits challenging a 
change made after the VRA’s preclearance 
protections were undermined in Shelby in-
volved a change to the method of election for 
the Pasadena, Texas City Council. MALDEF 
challenged the conversion of the Pasadena, 
Texas City Council from eight districted 
seats to six districted seats and two at-large 
seats. Mr. Saenz of MALDEF testified that 
this change was ‘‘plainly undertaken to pre-
vent the growing Latino voting population 
from electing a majority of the city council; 
participation differentials virtually ensured 
that the white population would elect its 
choices for the at-large seats in elections 
characterized by a racially polarized vote.’’ 
Following a bench trial, the district court 
judge held that not only would the change 
have the effect of unlawfully diluting the 
Latino vote, but it was made intentionally 
to do so. Chief Judge Rosenthal of the U.S. 
District Court for the Southern District of 
Texas stated, ‘‘[t]he intent was to delay the 
day when Latinos would make up enough of 
Pasadena’s voters to have an equal oppor-
tunity to elect Latino-preferred candidates 
to a majority of City Council seats.’’ Mr. 
Saenz testified that, following a long and 
costly trial preparation and trial process, 
this resulted in the first contested ‘‘bail-in’’ 
order, requiring Pasadena to pre-clear future 
electoral changes. 
Sonja Diaz of the UCLA Latino Policy and 
Politics Initiative noted that, in California, 
because of the 1990 federal court decision in 
Garza v. Los Angeles County Board of Super-
visors, Los Angeles County was forced to cre-
ate the first Latino-majority seat—30 years 
later, the Board of Supervisors still has only 
one Latino-majority district, despite the 
Latino citizen population increasing 77 per-
cent over the last 20 years. 
Mr. Saenz testified that, 10 years ago, 
MALDEF identified 8 counties in California 
that 
should 
have 
drawn 
an 
additional 
Latino-majority district on their 5-member 
county board of supervisors but failed to do 
so. Mr. Saenz testified that, ‘‘[e]ven with un-
limited resources, challenging eight jurisdic-
tions through litigation under section 2 of 
the VRA . . . would be daunting, if not im-
possible.’’ While MALDEF successfully chal-
lenged Kern County in ‘‘the first section 2 
litigation to go to trial in California in well 
over a decade, seven other counties were able 
to leave their VRA-violative district maps in 
place throughout the decade.’’ 
Examples of changes to methods of elec-
tion, and related tactics can be found around 
the country. In 2014, a federal court ordered 
Yakima, Washington, to create new, single- 
member City Council districts to remedy an 
at-large districting scheme that routinely 
suffocated the vote of Latino voters. Ms. 
Diaz testified that, in the first election with 
the new districts, three Latinas were elected 
to the City Council, though this was met 
with forms of retaliation. In response, ‘‘the 
city clerk, along with some ousted white 
city council members, resigned an entire 
month early’’ and White council members 
‘‘sought to leverage an at-large ballot ref-
erendum to reduce the electoral voice of 
Latinos by creating a strong mayor system.’’ 
Ms. Diaz testified that: 
‘‘In response, the non-Hispanic white mem-
bers of the Yakima city council attempted a 
retaliatory change to the charter as a way to 
reduce the power of the city council to en-
sure that Latinos could not have a majority 
of the representation on the seven person 
council, in violation of Section 2 of the Vot-
ing Rights Act. [Voting Rights Project] suc-
cessfully intervened on behalf of Latino 
plaintiffs to stop the proposed districting 
change to a mayor-council system, which if 
adopted, would revert the single-district 
council to an at-large election that dilutes 
the Latino vote.’’ 
Ms. Nelson of the NAACP LDF testified 
that, in 2015, the County Commission in Fay-
ette County, Georgia tried to revert to an at- 
large voting system in a special election to 
replace a Black Commissioner who had died 
unexpectedly. LDF won a Section 2 case that 
stopped this change and required the elec-
tion to use single-member districts, which 
allow Black voters to again elect their pre-
ferred candidate.

August 24, 2021 
In another example, in 2016, the largely 
white City of Gardendale, Alabama at-
tempted to secede from the more diverse Jef-
ferson County School Board, a move that 
would have effectively transferred Black vot-
ers in Gardendale from a system in which 
they had some ability to elect candidates of 
their choice, to the Gardendale city council’s 
at-large election system in which Black vot-
ers have no ability to elect candidates of 
their choice. Ms. Nelson testified that, in 
2018, the Eleventh Circuit Court blocked the 
secession after LDF successfully proved that 
Gardendale was motivated by racial dis-
crimination. Since Shelby County, LDF has 
warned at least four local jurisdictions in 
Alabama that ‘‘the at-large aspects of their 
electoral systems may violate Section 2 of 
the VRA and potentially also the U.S. Con-
stitution.’’ 
Ms. Nelson also testified that, in 2017, LDF 
‘‘proved that the Louisiana Legislature in-
tentionally maintained at-large elections for 
the state courts in Terrebonne Parish to pre-
vent the election of a Black judge.’’ A Black 
candidate has never been elected as a judge 
on the court in a contested election. A three- 
judge panel of the Fifth Circuit reversed the 
favorable decision in June 2020, despite the 
trial court’s finding that plaintiffs clearly 
established vote dilution and denied LDF’s 
petition for rehearing en banc. 
Professor Patty Ferguson-Bohnee testified 
that at-large districts have also been used to 
deny Native American voters the oppor-
tunity to elect candidates of their choice— 
states such as Montana, North Dakota, 
South Dakota, and Wyoming have used this 
scheme over the last 25 years to deny voting 
power to Native voters. 
In Utah, for example, the Justice Depart-
ment sued San Juan County in the 1980s ar-
guing that the at-large system violated Sec-
tion 2 of the VRA—the resulting consent de-
cree resulted in single-member districts. De-
spite population changes, the district lines 
did not change over the next 25 years and, 
despite changes that were made to the other 
two districts in 2011, the boundaries of the 
Native American-majority district remained 
the same. The Navajo Nation challenged the 
scheme of packing Navajo voters into one, 
single district out of three. As a result of 
multi-year litigation, the county’s districts 
were reconfigured, and Native Americans 
were able to elect two candidates of choice— 
litigation that took seven years and cost 
plaintiffs $3.4 million. 
There are additional examples of the Jus-
tice Department filing suit under Section 2 
challenging methods of election schemes in 
the years post-Shelby. In 2017, the Justice 
Department filed a complaint under Section 
2 challenging the City of Eastpoint, Michi-
gan’s, at-large method of electing the city 
council as diluting the voting strength of 
Black citizens; and in June 2019, the court 
entered the parties’ consent decree providing 
for the city to use ranked choice voting to 
resolve the claims. On May 27, 2020, the De-
partment filed a complaint challenging the 
at-large method of election for the school 
board of the Chamberlain School District 
under Section 2 of the VRA in South Dakota 
alleging that the Native American popu-
lation of the School District is sufficiently 
large and geographically compact to con-
stitute a majority of the voting-age popu-
lation and that the at-large method of elec-
tion the Chamberlain School Board dilutes 
the voting strength of American Indian citi-
zens. 
As recently as April 14, 2021, the DOJ filed 
a complaint and proposed consent decree 
under Section 2 of the VRA, challenging the 
at-large method of electing the board of al-
derman of the City of West Monroe, Louisi-
ana’s, city council, arguing that the current 
method of electing the West Monroe Board of 
Aldermen dilutes the voting strength of 
Black citizens, who constitute 28.9 percent of 
the voting-age population of the City of West 
Monroe, but no Black candidate has ever 
been elected to the West Monroe Board of Al-
dermen, and no Black individual has ever 
been appointed to the Board. 
This is merely a sampling of discrimina-
tory actions executed through changes to 
methods of election and changes to jurisdic-
tional boundaries. The evidence before the 
Subcommittee clearly illustrates that these 
practices are enacted with discriminatory ef-
fect and intent, resulting in the dilution of 
the voting power of minority voters and a se-
vere restriction of their ability to elect can-
didates of their choosing. 
Redistricting 
Each decade, following the decennial cen-
sus and distribution of population data, 
states undertake to redraw or update district 
lines—this affects districts up and down the 
ballot and at all levels of government. Dis-
criminatory 
redistricting 
practices 
have 
been utilized for decades to dilute and sup-
press the voting power of minority voters 
and can impact representation at all levels 
of government. To put a finer point on it—in 
1991, since-deceased Republican consultant 
Thomas Hofeller said, ‘‘I define redistricting 
as the only legalized form of vote-stealing 
left in the United States today.’’ 
In redistricting, officials can also use tac-
tics known as ‘‘cracking’’ and ‘‘packing’’ to 
dilute the votes of minority communities. 
‘‘Cracking’’ occurs when officials divide vot-
ers into a number of different districts, such 
that the minority voters in the districts do 
not have a majority in any of them—the pur-
pose of which is to maximize the number of 
wasted votes. ‘‘Packing’’ occurs when voters 
are placed into one or only a few districts, so 
the remaining districts are easier for non- 
minority voters to control. 
The country is now about to begin the first 
redistricting cycle without the full protec-
tions of the Voting Rights Act in more than 
a half century. According to the USCCR’s 
2018 report on minority voting rights access, 
‘‘overall data shows that there have been 
over 3,000 changes submitted due to redis-
tricting in every 10-year cycle since the 1965 
VRA was enacted.’’ Research performed by 
AAJC, MALDEF, and NALEO found that, 
since 1982, ‘‘at least 389 redistricting plans 
have been challenged by a court of the DOJ, 
or amended or withdrawn by responsible law-
makers, because of their discriminatory in-
tent or effects.’’ 
The redistricting process can and has been 
used to deny political power and equal rep-
resentation to minority populations. While a 
district is supposed to follow the ‘‘one per-
son, one vote’’ doctrine established by the 
Supreme Court in the 1960s, the drawing of 
districts is all too often done behind closed 
doors, without meaningful public input, and 
in a manner used to dilute the voices of some 
voters and, in effect, give disproportionate 
voting power to others. 
Former Attorney General Eric H. Holder, 
Jr., Chairman of the National Democratic 
Redistricting Committee, testified before the 
Subcommittee that: 
‘‘In the days since that ruling eight years 
ago, unnecessary and discriminatory voting 
restrictions went up across the country . . . 
And we saw newly emboldened state legisla-
tures draw discriminatory maps that un-
fairly placed Black people and other people 
of color, young and poor people, into gerry-
mandered voting districts where their im-
pact would be diluted and their voice ulti-
mately lost.’’ 
Jerry Vattamala of AALDEF testified that 
‘‘Asian Americans have been historically 
disenfranchised in the redrawing of district 
boundaries and in their right to vote.’’ Mr. 
Vattamala further testified that the percent-
age of Asian American elected officials is not 
keeping track with the population growth, in 
many instances because Asian American 
communities of interest are divided into nu-
merous districts, ‘‘subverting the growth and 
thwarting the effects of this growth and the 
numbers, to deny them the ability to elect a 
candidate of their choice.’’ Mr. Vattamala 
stated further that ‘‘we only see Asian Amer-
ican electoral representation when we have 
fair redistricting. Only then are they able to 
elect a candidate of choice and they usually 
do.’’ 
Professor Ferguson-Bohnee testified that 
‘‘[i]n addition to well-documented access 
barriers, redistricting has been used as a tool 
to suppress Native American voting rights 
and 
depress 
Native 
American 
political 
power.’’ In Arizona, for example, ‘‘Tribal vot-
ers challenged redistricting plans every 
cycle since the 1960s, except for the last dec-
ade following the 2010 Census.’’ The last dec-
ade was the first time Arizona’s maps were 
precleared on the first attempt—now, the 
retrogression standard required under Sec-
tion 5 of the VRA is no longer an option to 
protect the state’s single Native American 
majority-minority district in the upcoming 
redistricting cycle. 
Litigation alone can take years to remedy 
the harm of gerrymandering, meaning voters 
spend years represented by maps that are 
later found to have violated their rights. 
Cases 
challenging 
discriminatory 
maps 
drawn in the 2010 redistricting cycle in North 
Carolina and Texas, for example, took more 
than half a decade to litigate, all while vot-
ers went to the polls under districting maps 
later found to be discriminatory and unlaw-
ful. 
Allison Riggs of the Southern Coalition for 
Social Justice testified that, ‘‘[i]n the last 
decade, the North Carolina legislature’s re-
peated violations of the Fourteenth Amend-
ment in redistricting, local and statewide, 
should give anyone pause, and are strong evi-
dence of the need for federal protections.’’ 
Specifically, in North Carolina, the state 
drew redistricting maps that packed Black 
voters into as few districts as possible. 
Plaintiffs filed a lawsuit, and the federal 
courts found that the challenged districts 
violated the Equal Protection Clause. How-
ever, as Ms. Riggs testified, when the State 
General Assembly was given the first chance 
to remedy the districts, the legislature per-
petuated the racial packing. In 2016, after 
the District Court ruled against the state’s 
maps, state legislators drew new maps, this 
time admitting the purpose of the maps was 
partisan. 
In 2017, the Supreme Court upheld the 
lower court’s rejection of two North Carolina 
congressional maps on the grounds that 
North Carolina’s Republican-controlled leg-
islature relied too heavily on race in drawing 
the maps. The state’s maps had been the sub-
ject of continuous litigation since the 2011 
redistricting—all the while, voters went to 
the polls to cast ballots under maps that 
were found, years later, to be unlawfully dis-
criminatory. On October 28, 2019, a North 
Carolina state court again ruled against the 
state’s congressional district maps, saying 
the record of partisan intent was so exten-
sive that opponents of the maps were poised 
to show that the maps were unconstitution-
ally errymandered to favor Republicans over 
Democrats and the voters would be irrep-
arably harmed if the 2020 elections were held 
using those maps. 
But the North Carolina legislature is not 
the only bad actor. In 2019, Sean Young of 
the ACLU of Georgia testified before the 
Subcommittee that the ACLU’s case in Sum-
ter County, Georgia ‘‘perfectly illustrates

the damage that Shelby County has caused.’’ 
In 2011, 67 percent of Sumter County’s Board 
of Education was African American (six out 
of nine)—then the General Assembly pro-
posed a redistricting plan that would reduce 
the percentage of African Americans on the 
Board to 28 percent (two of seven) and sub-
mitted the plan to the DOJ for preclearance. 
The DOJ did not preclear the plan, but fol-
lowing the Shelby decision the Board was 
able to immediately implement its discrimi-
natory plan. Soon thereafter, the ACLU of 
Georgia brought a lawsuit to overturn a dis-
criminatory gerrymandering plan in Sumter 
County, Georgia—a federal court eventually 
ruled that the plan was discriminatory and 
violated the Voting Rights Act, five years 
after the plan went into effect and after 
years of expensive, time consuming litiga-
tion. In the intervening five years, School 
Board elections were held under a plan that 
was discriminatory and illegal. 
In September 2013, the U.S. Department of 
Justice filed a complaint against the State 
of Texas as a plaintiff-intervenor in Perez v. 
Perry (W.D. Tex.), seeking a declaration that 
Texas’ 2011 statewide redistricting plans to 
the State House of Representatives and the 
Congressional delegation were adopted ‘‘with 
the purpose of denying or abridging the right 
to vote on account of race, color, or member-
ship in a language minority group in viola-
tion of Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act’’ 
and contended that the Texas state legisla-
ture’s plan diluted the voting power of Asian 
Americans and other people of color. 
Jerry Vattamala, Director of the Democ-
racy Program at AALDEF, testified before 
the Subcommittee that, at the time of Perez 
v. Perry, Texas State House District 149 had 
a combined minority citizen voting-age pop-
ulation of close to 62 percent, and since 2004, 
the Asian American community in the Dis-
trict had voted as a bloc with Hispanic and 
African American voters to elect Hubert Vo, 
a Vietnamese American and the first Viet-
namese American state representative in 
Texas history, as their representative. 
In 2011, the state legislature sought to 
eliminate Vo’s seat and redistribute the coa-
lition of minority voters to the surrounding 
districts. In denying preclearance of the plan 
in 2012, the three-judge panel in Washington, 
D.C., found that the congressional and state 
redistricting plan had ‘‘both a retrogressive 
effect and a racially discriminatory purpose. 
The decision later had to be vacated and re-
manded in light of the Supreme Court’s deci-
sion in Shelby and its implications for Sec-
tion 5 preclearance claims. That was not the 
end of litigation over Texas’ redistricting 
plans, however. The legal battle over Texas’ 
2011 maps would go on for more than three- 
quarters of the decade and cost millions of 
dollars. In the intervening years interim 
maps were put in place. Eventually, in Abbot 
v. Perez, the Supreme Court would allow all 
but one of Texas’ political districts to re-
main in place through the end of the decade. 
The Court upheld the maps despite a district 
court describing the process used to create 
them as ‘‘discriminatory at its heart’’—while 
the Court did not specifically find discrimi-
natory purpose in the adoption of the 2013 
maps, ‘‘it did not dispute the determination 
that the 2011 maps were infected with the 
discriminatory intent to limit the influence 
of voters of color.’’ 
The State of Texas has a long history of ra-
cial discrimination in redistricting plans. In 
discussing Texas’ long history of discrimina-
tion in voting, in Veasy v. Abbott—litigation 
over Texas’ strict voter ID law—a federal 
court found in 2017 that ‘‘[i]n every redis-
tricting cycle since 1970, Texas has been 
found to have violated the Voting Rights Act 
with racially gerrymandered districts.’’ De-
spite being covered by the VRA since 1965, 
federal judges have ruled at least once every 
decade since then that Texas violated federal 
protections for voters in redistricting. 
In testimony before the Subcommittee, 
Thomas Saenz of MALDEF testified that: 
‘‘Last decade, the state of Texas gained 
four congressional seats as a result of its 
comparatively rapid growth over the course 
of the aughts. Nearly two-thirds of that 
Texas population growth came in the Latino 
community. Still, in adopting a new congres-
sional district map, the Texas legislature 
drew none of the four new districts within 
the Latino community, instead engaging in 
splitting the increased concentrations of 
Latino population among multiple districts 
in order to prevent Latino voters from elect-
ing candidates of choice. It took nearly a full 
decade of litigation under the VRA, waged 
by MALDEF and others, to ensure that an 
interim map, more respectful of the growing 
Latino community, would remain in place to 
protect Latino voters.’’ 
In 
testimony 
submitted 
to 
the 
Sub-
committee, Professor Ferguson-Bohnee de-
tailed the long history of minimizing Native 
American political representation through 
redistricting in the State of Arizona. The 
2010 redistricting cycle was the first time Ar-
izona’s maps were precleared on the first 
submission. Tribes have previously partici-
pated in redistricting and defended the single 
majority-minority Native American legisla-
tive district—Arizona, like other states, is 
no longer subject to Section 5 preclearance 
for the coming redistricting cycle. 
In North Dakota, tribal leaders raised con-
cerns before the Subcommittee at the 2019 
field hearing that, though there is only one 
at-large Congressional representative, their 
reservations are divided in a way at state- 
level redistricting that no Native American 
can win a seat representing the tribal lands. 
State Representative Ruth Buffalo testified 
in 2019 that, while she was the only Native 
American serving in the State House at the 
time of the hearing, she represents District 
27—Fargo, North Dakota—a district 370 
miles from her homelands of the Fort 
Berthold Reservation, and that the district 
representing Fort Berthold encompassed a 
white population that overwhelms the Na-
tive American population. 
In another example, Professor Ferguson- 
Bohnee testified that, in South Dakota, ‘‘dis-
crimination in redistricting led to prolonged 
litigation followed by consent decrees.’’ In 
2004, in Kirkie v. Buffalo County, Buffalo 
County gerrymandered its three districts by 
packing 75 percent of the Indian population 
into one district. As Professor Ferguson- 
Bohnee testified: 
‘‘The county, the ‘‘poorest in the country,’’ 
was comprised of approximately 2,100 people, 
of which 83 percent were Indian. This redis-
tricting had the purpose of diluting the In-
dian vote, as whites controlled both of the 
other two districts and thus County govern-
ment. The case was settled by a consent de-
cree wherein the county admitted its plan 
was discriminatory and was forced to redraw 
the district lines. In addition, the county 
agreed to subject itself to Section 3(c) of the 
Voting Rights Act, which requires the sub-
mission of voting changes for preclearance.’’ 
Professor Ferguson-Bohnee testified that, 
in 2005, another South Dakota County was 
forced to redraw district lines ‘‘for similar 
malapportionment of Indian voters.’’ Pro-
fessor 
Ferguson-Bohnee 
testified 
that 
‘‘[p]reclearance may have prevented this 
type of de facto discrimination, because the 
changes would have needed preclearance ap-
proval prior to enactment.’’ 
Dividing tribal communities and ignoring 
tribal boundaries in the redistricting process 
also dilutes the Native American vote. Pro-
fessor Ferguson-Bohnee testified that, while 
dividing reservation boundaries may be re-
quired to meet equal population require-
ments and to enhance voter effectiveness, 
there ‘‘are several examples of redistricting 
schemes that divide tribal communities to 
reduce voting strength.’’ Professor Ferguson- 
Bohnee notes that, for example, in recent 
years redistricting bodies have divided tribal 
communities into multiple districts in Wis-
consin, Washington, Montana, and Cali-
fornia—in Washington, the maps split three 
separate reservations. 
Mr. Vattamala testified that, in the past, 
redistricting plans have also diluted Asian 
American voting strength by fragmenting 
communities into multiple districts. Mr. 
Vattamala highlighted that Section 5 cov-
erage was not only in the South—New York 
previously had three covered counties as 
well, which helped protect minority commu-
nities. In New York City, for example, Mr. 
Vattamala testified that congressional dis-
trict boundaries have divided Asian Amer-
ican communities. In the case Favors v. 
Cuomo, AALDEF submitted materials super-
imposing the existing State Assembly and 
Senate, and Congressional district lines over 
the Asian American communities of interest, 
illustrating how divided each of the commu-
nities were among multiple districts, essen-
tially denying the community the ability to 
elect candidates of their choice. 
Mr. Vattamala testified that: 
‘‘AALDEF was ultimately able to convince 
the Special Master to draw a fair congres-
sional district in Queens that kept Asian 
American [Communities of Interest] whole, 
and together. Several months later that dis-
trict elected the first Asian American to 
Congress from New York State, and it was 
primarily because the community was fi-
nally allowed the opportunity to elect a can-
didate of its choice. This result was likely 
only possible through federal litigation.’’ 
Mr. Vattamala testified that the Asian 
American 
community, 
working 
together 
with the Black community and the Latino 
community, formed what they call a unity 
map that ‘‘protected all the communities of 
color that were protected under the Voting 
Rights Act,’’ and that it was very powerful 
to have the knowledge that Section 5 ex-
isted, that the map drawers started from a 
position of ensuring they were complying 
with Section 5 and ‘‘not retrogressing dis-
tricts.’’ Those protections are no longer in 
place. 
Partisan gerrymandering is also a form of 
vote denial and dilution that can dispropor-
tionately impact minority voting power 
when minority voters heavily favor one 
party over another. In 2019, however, the Su-
preme Court in Rucho v. Common Cause de-
clined to weigh in on the question of when 
partisan gerrymandering has crossed con-
stitutional bounds, holding that partisan 
gerrymandering claims are nonjusticiable, 
presenting political questions beyond the 
reach of the federal court. This decision 
leaves voters vulnerable to 50 different inter-
pretations of what constitutes an impermis-
sible partisan gerrymander in the upcoming 
redistricting cycle. In their opinion, the 
Court did, however, leave space for Congress 
to formulate a test for determining when a 
map constitutes a partisan gerrymander. 
CONCLUSION 
The evidence before the Subcommittee is 
clear, changes to method of election, redraw-
ing jurisdictional boundaries, and the redis-
tricting process have all been used time and 
again to dilute the voting power of minority 
voters, denying them the opportunity to 
elect candidates of their choice and a real 
voice 
in 
democratic 
governance.

tricting cases ‘‘typically require massive 
amounts of attorney time and millions of

dollars in expert fees,’’ leaving many com-
munities vulnerable to discrimination and 
suppression when voting rights litigators 
cannot intervene on their behalf and without 
the 
proactive 
protections 
of 
a 
federal 
preclearance regime. As former Attorney 
General Holder testified, ‘‘[w]e need to end 
gerrymandering, so that all people, including 
people of color, can be represented by public 
servants of their choice and be able to hold 
those representatives politically account-
able.’’ 
Conclusion 
The Voting in America hearings conducted 
by the Subcommittee show conclusively that 
discrimination in voting does, in fact, still 
exist. The evidence gathered by the Sub-
committee not only illustrates that dis-
crimination exists, but that is has grown 
steadily in the wake of the Supreme Court’s 
decision in Shelby County. Furthermore, the 
evidence demonstrates that the ‘‘extraor-
dinary measures’’ once deployed by the Vot-
ing Rights Act remain necessary today, and 
that the removal of those safeguards re-
leased a torrent of voter suppression laws 
the VRA once succeeded in holding back. 
As former Attorney General Eric Holder 
testified: 
‘‘Before 2013, Section 5 had helped prevent 
discriminatory voting laws from taking ef-
fect by imposing preclearance protections 
that required a federal review of changes to 
voting procedures in covered regions. Basi-
cally, areas with a history of discrimination 
had to get approval from the Department of 
Justice or from a federal court for signifi-
cant changes in voting laws or procedures. 
That section of the Voting Rights Act had 
helped to stop some of the worst attempts to 
discriminate against minority voters for dec-
ades. But in a five-to-four opinion, the con-
servative members of the Court wrote that 
the nation had ‘‘changed dramatically’’ since 
the Voting Rights Act went into effect and 
that, because of gains made, particularly by 
Black Americans, these protections were no 
longer necessary.’’ 
The evidence demonstrates that the nation 
has not changed as dramatically as the 
Court’s majority may have thought. In the 
eight years since Shelby County was decided, 
states have taken significant steps toward 
suppressing the vote. Across the country, 
states have purged millions of voters from 
the voting rolls; enacted a rash of strict 
voter ID laws; attempted to implement docu-
mentary proof of citizenship laws; failed to 
provide necessary language access and as-
sistance to limited-English proficiency vot-
ers; closed, consolidated, or relocated hun-
dreds if not thousands of polling locations, 
causing voters to wait in long, burdensome 
lines to vote; attempted to cut back on op-
portunities to vote outside of Election Day; 
and employed changes to methods of elec-
tions, jurisdictional boundaries, and redis-
tricting as methods to dilute and disenfran-
chise minority voters. 
Litigation under Section 2 of the Voting 
Rights Act and the Constitution has proven 
to be a powerful but inadequate tool to com-
bat the wave of voter suppression tactics un-
leashed in the years since Shelby. Janai Nel-
son, 
Associate 
Director-Counsel 
for 
the 
NAACP Legal Defense Fund, testified that, 
in the first five years following Shelby ‘‘an 
unprecedented 61 lawsuits were filed under 
Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act,’’ of 
which ‘‘[t]wenty-three cases were success-
ful.’’ By contrast, ‘‘in the five years before 
Shelby, only five Section 2 cases were won.’’ 
Litigation alone is not an adequate remedy 
to protect the right to vote—cases arising 
under Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act are 
reactive, costly, and can take years to liti-
gate. 
The 2018 and 2020 elections saw record 
voter turnout. While this is indeed an out-
come to be celebrated, it is not, as some 
argue, an indication that voter suppression 
and discrimination no longer exists. The evi-
dence gathered by the Subcommittee dem-
onstrates that voters turned out in record 
numbers despite suppressive voting laws and 
a once-in-a-century pandemic. And yet, the 
reaction 
of 
Republican-led 
legislatures 
around the country to historic voter turnout 
has been to unleash a new wave of restrictive 
voting laws in the months following the 2020 
election. States with a history of discrimina-
tory voting practices and racially polarized 
voting continue to enact voting laws without 
analyzing whether these provisions discrimi-
nate against minority voters. 
The false specter of fraud has been cited to 
support these new restrictive provisions. 
But, as we have heard time and again, nu-
merous investigations have found no credible 
evidence of fraud in the 2020 election. Indeed, 
according to cyber and elections security ex-
perts, ‘‘the November 3rd [2020] election was 
the most secure in American history.’’ Un-
fortunately, fueled by the ‘‘Big Lie’’ that the 
election was stolen, insurrectionists at-
tempted to stop the certification of a lawful, 
valid, democratic presidential election by 
storming the Capitol on January 6, 2021. In 
the six months since the attack, efforts to 
suppress the vote and subvert democracy 
have continued, as state legislatures have 
moved quickly to meet the increase in voter 
turnout with voter suppression. 
According to the Brennan Center for Jus-
tice, as of May 14, 2021, more than 389 bills in 
48 states have been introduced restricting 
the vote. As of June 21, 2021, 17 states have 
enacted 28 new laws that restrict access to 
the vote, with some state legislatures still in 
session. At least 16 restrictions on mail vot-
ing will make it more difficult for voters to 
cast mail ballots that count in 12 states. At 
least eight states have enacted 11 laws mak-
ing in-person voting more difficult. And 
more bills are still moving through state leg-
islatures. 
These new laws only compound the legal 
and administrative hurdles enacted in the 
eight years since Shelby. As former Attorney 
General Holder testified: 
‘‘These actions have not made our elec-
tions safer or more secure. They have not 
improved the quality or accessibility of our 
politics. Instead, they have stripped Ameri-
cans of fundamental rights and undermined 
the promise of American democracy. And 
they have all—every one of them—dispropor-
tionately impacted people of color.’’ 
For example, Michael Waldman, President 
of the Brennan Center for Justice, testified 
that ‘‘[i]n 2013, at least six states—Alabama, 
Mississippi, North Carolina, North Dakota, 
Virginia, and Texas—implemented or began 
to enforce strict photo ID laws, most of 
which had previously been blocked by the 
Department of Justice due to their discrimi-
natory impact.’’ Federal courts in at least 
four states have found strict voter ID laws to 
be racially discriminatory, including Texas 
and North Carolina’s laws. In previously cov-
ered jurisdictions, 1,688 polling places were 
closed between 2012 and 2018, all with none of 
the disparate impact analysis previously re-
quired by preclearance. Restrictions tar-
geting early voting opportunities can and do 
have a direct impact on minority voters. 
Thomas Saenz, President and General 
Counsel for MALDEF, testified that, ‘‘[t]here 
is simply no way that non-profit voting 
rights litigators, even supplemented by the 
work of a reinvigorated Department of Jus-
tice Civil Rights Division, could possibly 
prevent the implementation of all of the 
undue ballot-access restriction and redis-
tricting violations that are likely to arise in 
the next two years.’’ 
The 
evidence 
compiled 
by 
the 
Sub-
committee illustrates that the voting and 
election administration practices of purging 
voters from the voting rolls; enacting voter 
ID and proof of citizenship requirements; 
failing to provide necessary multi-lingual 
voting materials and assistance; closing, 
consolidating, or relocating polling places; 
cutting or restricting access to alternative 
opportunities to vote; and altering methods 
of election, jurisdictional boundaries, and re-
districting 
disproportionately 
impacts 
Black, 
Latino, 
Native 
American, 
Asian 
American, and other minority voters and im-
pedes access to the ballot in a discrimina-
tory manner. 
Congress needs to listen to the American 
people. The Voting Rights Act was not writ-
ten in the halls of Congress—it was written 
between Shelby and Montgomery. It was 
written by Americans who fought for equal 
access to what was promised to be a democ-
racy. We are again hearing from the people 
on the need to protect the right to vote. 
Defending democracy used to be a bipar-
tisan endeavor. Since the Voting Rights Act 
first passed in 1965, Congress has acted sev-
eral times, and in a bipartisan manner, to 
protect access to the vote. The Voting 
Rights Act was reauthorized five times with 
bipartisan votes—and signed into law each 
time by a Republican President. The 2006 
VRA reauthorization was introduced by a 
Republican congressman. Moreover, Con-
gress has passed additional voting bills, in-
cluding the Uniformed and Overseas Citizen 
Absentee Voting Act (UOCAVA) in 1986, the 
National Voter Registration Act (NVRA) in 
1993, and the Help America Vote Act (HAVA) 
in 2002 with bipartisan support. Bipartisan 
commissions such as the Carter-Baker Com-
mission and the Presidential Commission on 
Election Administration endeavored to cre-
ate best practices in elections to improve the 
voting experience. 
We are now at an inflection point in pro-
tecting our democracy. The time has come 
for Congress to utilize its constitutional au-
thority to protect the fundamental right to 
vote for all Americans. As Mr. Henderson 
stated before the Subcommittee, ‘‘[f]or de-
mocracy to work for all of us, it must in-
clude all of us.’’ ‘‘It is unacceptable that in 
2021, 56 years after the VRA’s passage,’’ Ms. 
Nelson stated, that ‘‘the right to vote re-
mains so very under-protected. This model is 
not sustainable nor is it acceptable.’’ 
And as Chief Justice Earl Warren wrote in 
1964, the year before the passage of the Vot-
ing Rights Act, the ‘‘right to vote freely for 
the candidate of one’s choice is of the es-
sence of a democratic society, and any re-
strictions on that right strike at the heart of 
the representative government.’’ After re-
viewing thousands of pages of evidence col-
lected during this Congress and listening to 
the testimony of dozens of experts from 
across the country, as summarized in this re-
port, the evidence demonstrates one clear 
command: Congressional action is needed.

RECOGNIZING THE 25TH ANNIVER-
SARY OF NAVARRO & WRIGHT 
CONSULTING ENGINEERS, INC. 
HON. SCOTT PERRY 
OF PENNSYLVANIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, August 24, 2021 
Mr. PERRY. Madam Speaker, I am honored 
to recognize the 25th Anniversary of Navarro 
& Wright Consulting Engineers, Inc. 
Founded in October 1996 by Paul J. 
Navarro, P.E., and Charles Wright, the Firm 
began operations with three employees work-
ing out of the basement of Paul Navarro’s 
house in Steelton, Pennsylvania. The com-
pany flourished from its humble beginnings 
and has grown to a total of 190 employees 
across nine offices in three states—Pennsyl-
vania, Maryland, and Delaware. 
The Firm’s original clients included land de-
velopers, municipalities, and utility companies. 
The housing boom of the late 90s and early 
2000s fostered growth opportunities, and the 
Firm quickly expanded its services to capture 
a segment of the transportation sector. 
In 1998, the Firm was certified as a minor-
ity-owned business with PennDOT and the PA 
Department of General Services, which en-
abled it to bid on public works projects with 
state agencies. Today, the Firm is a certified 
MBE/DBE, with numerous state agencies 
across the Mid-Atlantic region. Over the years, 
the Firm made several acquisitions, such as 
Foust Geological Services, and Raudenbush 
Engineering, which bolstered its transportation 
services and geographic presence into West-
ern Pennsylvania. 
The Firm moved to its current corporate 
headquarters in New Cumberland, PA in 1999, 
and acquired/now occupies the 14,000 square 
foot building that houses several of its busi-
ness units and corporate staff. 
Navarro & Wright consistently is recognized 
among the Top Private Companies and Fast-
est Growing Companies in the Central Penn-
sylvania area for the past 25 years. The Firm 
also earned a Top 100 MBE Firm in the Mid- 
Atlantic region. 
True to its mission statement, ‘‘Delivering 
Vital Infrastructure through Design Excel-
lence,’’ Navarro & Wright approaches each 
project with the client’s needs and objectives 
at the forefront. It has earned a reputation of 
delivering high quality services across the 
many markets—a distinction that is a tribute to 
the key leaders and talented employees of the 
Firm who give their utmost attention to each 
project. The Firm’s belief in continuous im-
provement enables its team to maintain a high 
level of service, and to continue to grow and 
prosper. 
I’m honored and privileged to commend Mr. 
Paul J. Navarro, P.E., and Navarro & Wright 
Consulting Services on 25 years of success, 
prosperity, and vital service to our commu-
nities. I wish Mr. Navarro and the Firm contin-
ued success and prosperity into the future. 
RECOGNIZING 
PATRICK 
COLLINS 
FOR 
HIS 
FIFTY 
YEARS 
OF 
TEACHING 
AT 
BELEN 
JESUIT 
PREPARATORY SCHOOL 
HON. MARIO DIAZ-BALART 
OF FLORIDA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, August 24, 2021 
Mr. DIAZ-BALART. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize an outstanding educator in 
my district, Mr. Patrick Collins, who has dedi-
cated fifty years towards teaching the young 
men of Miami-Dade County. 
Patrick received his B.A. in history and sec-
ondary education from Spring Hill College in 
Mobile, Alabama, in 1971. That same year, he 
began his impressive teaching career at Belen 
Jesuit Preparatory School, where he still 
teaches today. Shortly after beginning his ca-
reer at Belen, he became the Chairperson of 
the newly created Social Studies Depart-
ment—a clear indicator of his leadership quali-
ties even at a young age. In 1975, Patrick re-
ceived his M.S. in administration in secondary 
education from Barry University and founded 
Belen’s varsity tennis team, where he served 
as head coach until 2007. If that year wasn’t 
busy enough for Patrick, he also fostered the 
longstanding relationship with Belen and Close 
Up Foundation, thereby allowing thousands of 
students to visit Washington, D.C., and wit-
ness the seat of our nation’s government. In 
fact, in 2015, he was inducted into Close Up 
Foundation’s Educator Hall of Fame, a distinc-
tion which he rightfully deserves. 
It has been an honor to work with Mr. Col-
lins over the years and I truly value his friend-
ship. I have visited his classroom on several 
occasions to speak to his students regarding 
my role as a Member of Congress and it is 
clear how respected he is amongst his stu-
dents and peers. Through these visits, I have 
seen firsthand his passion for teaching and 
the influence that he has on all those who he 
interacts with. He represents the values that 
Belen Jesuit Preparatory School hopes to in-
still in its students and has done a commend-
able job preparing young men for their future. 
Madam Speaker, it is a privilege to know 
that an educator such as Mr. Collins resides in 
South Florida. He has truly made a difference 
in the lives of every student he interacts with 
and I ask my colleagues to join me in recog-
nizing this remarkable individual.

HONORING THE LIFE AND ADVO-
CACY 
OF 
ELIZABETH 
CADY 
STANTON AT THE UNVEILING OF 
HER STATUE IN HER HOMETOWN 
OF JOHNSTOWN, NEW YORK 
HON. ELISE M. STEFANIK 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, August 24, 2021 
Ms. STEFANIK. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor the life of Elizabeth Cady Stan-
ton at the unveiling of her statue in her home-
town of Johnstown, New York. 
Elizabeth Cady Stanton was a legendary 
leader in the fight for women’s rights, particu-
larly for women’s suffrage. She was a key or-
ganizer of the Seneca Falls Convention in 
1848, which is credited with launching the 
women’s rights movement in the United 
States. Stanton was the primary drafter of the 
Declaration of Sentiments which detailed the 
rights championed at the convention. 
Stanton went on to found the National 
Women’s Suffrage Association, which she pre-
sided over for 20 years. In 1866, Stanton be-
came the first woman to run for Congress, 
even though she did not yet have the right to 
vote herself. In addition to her important work 
fighting for women, she also took up the 
cause of slavery. An ardent abolitionist, she 
co-founded 
the 
Women’s 
Loyal 
National 
League to encourage Congress to pass the 
13th Amendment, making slavery illegal. 
Elizabeth Cady Stanton died in 1902 after a 
lifetime fighting for equality. The 19th amend-
ment, granting women the right to vote, would 
not become law for 18 more years. Over 100 
years after her death, the legacy of her work 
remains deeply impactful. This statue erected 
in her hometown of Johnstown, New York is a 
testament to the lasting effect that her fight for 
equality had on this nation. I am proud to 
honor Elizabeth Cady Stanton on behalf of 
New York’s 21st Congressional District.

OF MINNESOTA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, August 24, 2021 
Ms. MCCOLLUM. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor Sunisa (Suni) Lee for her 
achievements during the 2020 Tokyo Summer 
Olympic games, which were held July 23 
through August 8, 2021. At the age of 18, Ms. 
Lee made history in her Olympic debut as the 
first Hmong-American to represent the United 
States. She demonstrated outstanding skill 
and training, winning the gold medal in the 
women’s gymnastics all-around, helping Team 
USA win a silver medal in the team final and 
winning the bronze medal in the uneven bars. 
Ms. Lee is a lifelong resident of Saint Paul, 
in Minnesota’s Fourth Congressional District. 
I’m very proud to say that she’s a graduate of 
South Saint Paul High School, my alma mater. 
She joined a remarkable group of 17 Min-
nesota athletes who qualified to compete for 
Team USA. Throughout the competition, she 
displayed a spirit and determination that 
boosted Team USA and their fans across the 
United States.

August 24, 2021 
Born in 2003 to parents who came to the 
U.S. as refugees from Laos, Ms. Lee is accus-
tomed to working hard and overcoming chal-
lenges. Just one day before leaving to com-
pete in the 2019 U.S. gymnastics champion-
ship, her father and top cheerleader, Houa 
(John) Lee, became paralyzed in a tree trim-
ming accident. Despite this tragedy, John en-
couraged Suni to go and compete. She went 
on to defy expectations and finish second in 
the gymnastics all-around, Since then, she 
has assisted her father in his recovery, along 
with her mother Yeev Thoj and her siblings, all 
while continuing her demanding schedule of 
academic studies and training. Her resilience 
and determination reflect the heart of an 
Olympian. 
In tribute to Ms. Lee’s Olympic gold medal 
in the women’s gymnastics all-around, Gov-
ernor Tim Walz and Saint Paul Mayor Melvin 
Carter named Friday, July 30, 2021 as Sunisa 
Lee Day in Minnesota and Saint Paul. On Au-
gust 8, a parade was held in her honor 
through her East Side Saint Paul neighbor-
hood. Thousands of fans, family and friends 
gathered on White Bear Avenue to cheer on 
her victories and celebrating her achievements 
on behalf of Team USA. 
Throughout her life, Ms. Lee has been a 
positive force for her family, her community in 
Saint Paul, Minnesota and the United States. 
Her victory as the first Hmong-American to win 
Olympic gold in the all-around gymnastics cat-
egory is especially inspiring to Asian-American 
girls who see her as a role model who is ca-
pable of performing at the highest level on the 
global stage. 
Madam Speaker, please join me in honoring 
Sunisa Lee for her outstanding accomplish-
ments, along with her incomparable talent, ex-
traordinary commitment, and resilient spirit. 
We wish Ms. Lee well as she begins a new 
chapter as a student-athlete at Auburn Univer-
sity.

IN 
RECOGNITION 
OF 
PLEASANT 
VALLEY 
HIGH 
SCHOOL’S 
ENVIROTHON TEAM 
HON. MATT CARTWRIGHT 
OF PENNSYLVANIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, August 24, 2021 
Mr. CARTWRIGHT. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor Pleasant Valley High School’s 
Envirothon Team. The team of Emma Barrett 
(captain), Reece Kresge, Zachary Dooner, 
Jacob Possinger, and Benjamin Keppel re-
cently placed seventh at the International 
NCF-Evirothon competition hosted virtually at 
the University of Nebraska-Lincoln. 
Evirothon began in Pennsylvania in 1979 as 
the ‘‘Environmental Olympics’’ to encourage 
young people to take an interest in conserva-
tion and environmental issues, and, over the 
past four decades, the program has expanded 
to 46 states and internationally to Canada and 
China. Teachers and professionals support 
high school students as they participate in nat-
ural resource environmental education both in 
the classroom and outdoors. 
To advance to the international competition, 
the team competed against teams from 58 
Pennsylvania counties in a series of field sta-
tion tests focused five areas: soils and land 
use, aquatic ecology, forestry, wildlife, and en-
vironmental issues. They also prepared and 
delivered an oral presentation where they 
demonstrated their problem solving and oral 
presentation skills and provided their rec-
ommendations to solve a current environ-
mental issue. Their impressive performance 
earned them first place and a chance to com-
pete at the international competition. The team 
also posted the top score in the wildlife sta-
tion. 
At the 32nd annual NCF-Enivrothon com-
petition, hosted by the National Conservation 
Foundation and the Nebraska Association of 
Resources Districts, the team took on 42 
teams—35 from the United States, four from 
Canada, and three from China. Vying for glory 
as well as scholarships and awards, the team 
competed in the five stations and delivered 
their oral presentation to a panel of judges, ul-
timately placing seventh overall and earning 
$1,000 scholarships. 
It is an honor to recognize Emma, Reece, 
Zachary, Jacob, Benjamin, and their advisor, 
Maricatherine Garr, as they celebrate this out-
standing achievement. They have made the 
8th Congressional District proud and rep-
resented the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania 
well on the world stage. These students have 
bright futures ahead of them in whatever ca-
reer path they choose, and I wish them well 
as they continue on in their studies. May they 
be lifelong stewards and advocates for our en-
vironment.

RICHARD L. TRUMKA AND UNITE 
HERE: A REMEMBRANCE 
HON. ROSA L. DeLAURO 
OF CONNECTICUT 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, August 24, 2021 
Ms. DELAURO. Madam Speaker, I rise to 
include in the RECORD a statement written by 
John W. Wilhelm, Retired President, UNITE 
HERE, in honor of the late Rich Trumka. 
UNITE HERE had a special bond with Rich 
Trumka. His unexpected death this month 
hit the labor movement hard. It was a per-
sonal loss for me, and the loss of a pas-
sionate advocate for the members of our 
Union. 
Rich Trumka was a leader of principle and 
courage. He was a third generation coal 
miner from immigrant Italian and Polish 
stock, growing up in the little Appalachian 
coal town of Nemacolin in southwest Penn-
sylvania. 
His Union, the United Mine Workers of 
America (UMWA), is one of the most impor-
tant Unions—arguably the single most im-
portant—in American labor history. The 
UMWA was founded in 1890, one year before 
HERE. The UMWA has always been impor-
tant to its fiercely loyal members, working 
for brutal companies in a dangerous indus-
try. It was equally important to the Amer-
ican labor movement because the UMWA was 
the driving force in the creation of the CIO 
and the massive industrial organizing cam-
paigns of the Great Depression, as well as a 
crucial political ally for President Roosevelt 
and the New Deal. 
My mother, who grew up in the coal coun-
try of Southwest Virginia, always said that 
the only good things that ever happened to 
the Appalachian people were Franklin and 
Eleanor Roosevelt and the United Mine 
Workers. 
After the legendary Mine Workers leader 
John L. Lewis retired in 1960. the Union lost 
its way. Rich Trumka went to Penn State, 
intending to play football until he got hurt, 
and then the Villanova Law School. Rich 
could have done anything, but he decided to 
become part of a growing reform movement 
in the UMWA. After the murder of reform 
leader Jock Yablonski, Rich redoubled his 
efforts. In 1982, at age 33, he was elected 
President of his Union. 
Rich set out to restore the confidence of 
the miners in their Union, and to restore the 
Union’s hard-earned respect from the coal 
companies. His rebuilding program cul-
minated in the epic 10-month strike of 2,000 
Union miners against the Pittston Coal Com-
pany in 1989–1990. Pittston was a creative

August 24, 2021 
campaign, with the mine workers’ trade-
mark militant picket lines backed up by 
massive, repeated civil disobedience, stra-
tegic corporate and political action, and de-
termined support from women organized as 
the Daughters of Mother Jones. 
My predecessor as HERE General Presi-
dent, Edward T. Hanley, supported Rich 
Trumka from the time Rich became Presi-
dent of UMWA. During the Pittston strike, 
Edward saw a CNN report that Pittston had 
put on a lobster dinner for the scabs, out-
doors where the pickets could see the scabs 
eating. That angered Edward. He told Rich 
that the company fed the scabs once, but 
HERE would feed the strikers every day. He 
sent five cooks who were members of HERE 
Local 863 at the Greenbrier Resort in West 
Virginia to Camp Solidarity in Castlewood, 
Virginia, 
the 
strike 
headquarters. 
The 
Greenbrier HERE members prepared three 
meals a day, seven days a week, until the 
strikers won. 
The key issue in the strike was retiree 
health care. Pittston unilaterally gutted the 
health benefits of its retirees, and refused to 
pay into the health care fund for retired 
miners who had been employed by other 
companies that had gone out of business. 
Rich told me that Ed Hanley’s help was 
crucial to settling the Pittston strike. Dur-
ing the AFL–CIO Convention in 1989 in Wash-
ington DC, Edward invited Rep. Daniel Ros-
tenkowski, his life-long Chicago friend who 
was then Chairman of the House Ways and 
Means Committee, to meet in the bar at the 
Sheraton Wardman Park Hotel, site of the 
Convention, and asked Rich to join them. By 
the wee hours of the next morning, Rich, Ed-
ward, and Rep. Rostenkowski shook hands 
on the framework to settle the Pittston 
strike. 
The strike continued full force, but the 
Sheraton Wardman Park framework suc-
ceeded. Pittston reluctantly agreed to pay 
for retirement security for its own current 
and future employees and their spouses. The 
UMWA strikers triumphantly returned to 
work. 
For the retirees from other companies for 
whom the strikers had also been fighting, 
Dan Rostenkowski promised Rich Trumka 
and Ed Hanley that Congress would step in 
to help. Bob Juliano, HERE’s peerless Legis-
lative 
Representative, 
worked 
with 
the 
UMWA and the Congressman’s staff to struc-
ture the solution. Sen. Jay Rockefeller, 
Democrat of West Virginia, sponsored legis-
lation which required that all coal compa-
nies pay the retirement costs of their own 
retirees and spouses. It also guaranteed Fed-
eral funding of benefits for ‘‘orphan’’ retir-
ees, those whose employers had gone out of 
business. Congress passed this landmark leg-
islation, and President George H.W. Bush 
signed it in 1992. 
It was the Pittston strike that solidified 
an enduring bond between HERE and the 
United Mine Workers. The good turn that 
our Union did for Rich Trumka and the 
UMWA has been repaid many times over in 
the intervening years. 
Rich Trumka found in HERE three things 
he admired: workers with the bravery and te-
nacity to fight for justice, a Union coura-
geous enough to take on strikes that like 
Pittston seemed impossible, and a Union 
that organizes and fights for immigrant 
workers. 
The Culinary and Bartenders Union in Las 
Vegas was our Union’s largest affiliate in the 
1980’s, and it still is. By 1990 the Culinary 
and Bartenders had made progress in rebuild-
ing after the terrible 1984 Las Vegas strike, 
but two tough obstacles loomed. 
The first was a brutal 9-month strike in 
1990 at the Horseshoe in Downtown Las 
Vegas. The second was the historic Frontier 
strike on the Strip, which lasted six years, 
four months, and ten days, from 1991 through 
1998, with no striker ever going back to work 
across the 24/7 picket line. 
The Union had to win these two strikes, 
both against very wealthy families answer-
able to no one. Benefit, wage, and job secu-
rity standards were at stake. So was the 
Union’s aggressive Las Vegas organizing pro-
gram. 
Rich came to Las Vegas over and over dur-
ing the Horseshoe and Frontier strikes. Rich 
would be the first to agree that the Union 
won both strikes because of the courage and 
commitment of the strikers and strike cap-
tains, the extraordinary leadership of Joe 
Daugherty as well as D. Taylor, Richard 
McCracken, and other organizers and re-
searchers, the steadfast support financially 
from the city-wide Culinary and Bartenders 
membership, and the unwavering support of 
President Hanley and the International 
Union. 
But Rich Trumka’s role in those victories 
cannot be overstated. The Frontier strikers 
adopted the slogan of the Pittston strikers, 
‘‘One Day Longer.’’ Rich inspired the strik-
ers and the entire Union membership again 
and again, giving all of us confidence that we 
would win. He worked hard to ensure broad 
support from the entire American labor 
movement. He led the charge for Desert Soli-
darity during the Frontier strike, the largest 
labor action in Las Vegas history, which 
closed down the Strip on a busy Saturday 
night, 
with 
participation 
from 
Unions 
throughout the country. Rich also gave our 
Union a lasting gift by assigning Vinny 
O’Brien, an amazing talent who organized 
Desert Solidarity and went on to help so 
many UNITE HERE Locals over the next 20 
years. 
In 1995, during the Frontier strike, Rich 
joined John Sweeney and Linda Chavez 
Thompson as the candidate for Secretary- 
Treasurer on the first slate to contest the 
AFL–CIO leadership in the 40 years since the 
AFL and CIO merged. That slate won. Ed 
Hanley surprised many of his labor friends 
by supporting the Sweeney ticket. Rich 
served as Secretary-Treasurer until 2009, 
when he was elected to succeed the retiring 
Sweeney as President of the AFL–CIO. 
In his new AFL–CIO position, Rich’s sup-
port of HERE didn’t let up. He was there 
when the Frontier strikers joyfully went 
back to work at midnight on January 31, 
1998. And his support wasn’t confined to just 
Las Vegas: wherever our Union needed help, 
Rich was there. As just three examples 
among many, he marched in the People’s 
Graduation action by Locals 34 and 35 at 
Yale University in 1996, he was arrested in a 
civil disobedience supporting Local 2 mem-
bers at the San Francisco Hilton in 2010, and 
he kicked off our global Hyatt Boycott that 
same year. He was everywhere we asked him 
to be, and he was always inspirational. 
Rich Trumka had a deep relationship with 
his fellow miners, and with workers of all 
kinds. He believed in his soul that all people 
are created equal. Solidarity was not an ab-
straction to him, perhaps because of his 
roots in the mines and the United Mine 
Workers. The pro-worker, pro-immigrant 
doctrine of his Catholic faith informed his 
sense of solidarity. When UNITE HERE’s Fa-
ther Clete Kiley started reviving the tradi-
tion of Catholic labor priests, Rich was all 
in. 
In 2000, when HERE took the lead in chang-
ing AFL–CIO policy to embrace the cause of 
immigrant workers, Rich supported that 
fight, drawing on the experiences of his own 
immigrant family. 
A shining chapter of his AFL–CIO leader-
ship came in 2008. Rich relentlessly criss-
crossed the Midwestern and Appalachian 
states, bluntly insisting that white Union 
members had to confront the racism that 
held some back from voting for Barrack 
Obama for President. With his trademark 
plain-spoken eloquence he described racism 
as just another form of divide and conquer. 
His ability to connect with white workers on 
matters of race and immigration was un-
matched. 
Rich was very disappointed when HERE 
helped lead several Unions out of the AFL– 
CIO in 2005 to organize an alternate federa-
tion, Change to Win. Nevertheless, when the 
Service 
Employees 
International 
Union 
under then-president Andy Stern attacked 
UNITE HERE and perverted the goals of 
Change to Win, Rich warmly welcomed us 
back into the AFL–CIO fold at the same 2009 
Convention where he became AFL–CIO Presi-
dent. He addressed the UNITE HERE 2014 
Convention, D. Taylor’s first as President. 
Rich Trumka was passionate. He was one 
of the great orators of our time. He was a vo-
racious reader and a keen student of history, 
especially of the Civil War. Many of us have 
been frustrated with the AFL–CIO, but I 
never doubted for a moment Rich’s commit-
ment, his moral authority, and his integrity. 
Rich Trumka supported worker struggles 
everywhere. He inspired workers wherever he 
went. Many different Unions and many dif-
ferent battles benefitted from his help. 
But in UNITE HERE, our members have 
perhaps benefitted to a greater measure than 
any other Union except, of course, his own 
United Mine Workers. We had a very special 
relationship. 
I last saw Rich in Washington DC in May 
of this year. We met at his favorite breakfast 
place, the Hay-Adams Hotel across the street 
from the AFL–CIO building. He was in a nos-
talgic mood. He reminisced with the mem-
bers of UNITE HERE Local 25 who were serv-
ers in the dining room about his intervention 
when new owners at the Hay-Adams had 
sought to evade their Union obligations. I 
told him I had just visited Lebanon, Vir-
ginia, my grandfather’s home town, where 
my mother and sister are buried, and nearby 
Castlewood, where HERE members cooked 
for the Pittston strikers at Camp Solidarity. 
I reminded Rich that shortly before my 
mother passed away he had visited her for 
several hours, compared notes with her 
about growing up in coal country, and left 
her with an autographed copy of a book on 
UMWA history. 
Rich and I talked at that breakfast about 
many struggles, among them Pittston, the 
Horseshoe, the Frontier, the fight to change 
the AFL–CIO immigration policy, and his he-
roic work in the 2008 presidential campaign. 
We talked about our mutual admiration for 
Ed Hanley, D. Taylor, and Joe Daugherty. 
We talked as well about struggles not yet 
won, particularly his determination to re-
form labor law by passing the PRO Act in 
Congress and his commitment to winning for 
immigrants. 
During that breakfast Rich told me that he 
had decided to retire at the AFL–CIO Con-
vention in 2022. He was looking forward to 
spending time with his family and especially 
his grandchildren, and to pursuing his hob-
bies, reading, visiting Civil War battlefields, 
and being in nature, where he loved to hunt, 
fish, and camp. 
His sudden death means that he won’t get 
those opportunities. Like Ed Hanley, he left 
us too soon. For that I am sad. But miners, 
UNITE HERE members, and workers every-
where are blessed that he came our way. His 
inspiring life will outlast the sadness for me, 
and I hope eventually for his family.

HONORING THE ARIZONA 
INFORMANT 
HON. GREG STANTON 
OF ARIZONA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, August 24, 2021 
Mr. STANTON. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize and congratulate the Ari-
zona Informant on 50 years of excellence in 
reporting on our state’s most important issues. 
Since its start, the paper’s motto has been: 
‘‘98% of Our News You Won’t Find in Any 
Other News Media in Arizona,’’ and it’s deliv-
ered on that, shining a light on members of 
our community. For five decades, the paper 
has chronicled stories of Black Americans. It 
has reported on the importance of African 
American representation in Arizona politics, ra-
cial disparities in the criminal justice system, 
the need to improve policing in communities of 
color, and the stories of resilience throughout 
the COVID–19 pandemic. But most impor-
tantly, it has documented the history, suc-
cesses, and leadership of African Americans 
in our community. 
The newspaper was founded by Cloves 
Campbell, Sr., Arizona’s first Black state sen-
ator, and his brother Charles Campbell, a re-
spected and accomplished educator. They 
knew firsthand that the press of the ’50s and 
’60s rarely told the full story on any issue af-
fecting communities of color that seldom came 
across the newswire. Too often, mainstream 
media coverage of Black Americans focused 
mostly on large Civil Rights demonstrations. 
Those stories usually covered the events 
themselves and rarely took the time to tell 
what happened after these influential dem-
onstrations, nor the work of Black Americans 
whose brave and courageous actions made 
those events possible. As they lived through 
this history, Cloves and Charles realized they 
could tell these stories better themselves—and 
so they did. 
In 1971, with just $1, Charles and Cloves 
bought the Arizona Informant and transformed 
it into the paper we know now. Today, as 
much of Arizona and national media suffer 
from shrinking readership, the paper is seeing 
growth, boasting 100,000 weekly readers. The 
Arizona Informant remains Arizona’s only 
Black-owned weekly newspaper. The paper 
also uses the influence of its non-profit foun-
dation, the Arizona Informant Foundation, to 
provide and develop valuable resources and 
opportunities to help build and bolster Black 
and African American communities in Arizona. 
For 50 years, the paper has successfully 
captured the history of our community—bring-
ing important issues and voices into the spot-
light. As our country continues to see dispari-
ties in the Black community and communities 
of color, we are reminded that we need outlets 
that see and embrace their identity, as mem-
bers of the community they cover, not as a 
‘‘bias’’ but as an asset to report the truth. 
Journalism needs more outlets like the Ari-
zona Informant who not only do quality jour-
nalism but do so with newsrooms that reflect 
and empathize with the communities and 
issues they carefully cover. 
The Campbell brothers and the Informant 
remind us that diversity is essential, not only 
to the success of journalism, but to the suc-
cess and vibrancy of our community. Their 
spirit lives on with Cloves’ son, Cloves Camp-
bell, Jr., who has followed in his father’s foot-
steps and continued his legacy of journalistic 
excellence as publisher of the newspaper. 
I thank the Arizona Informant for being a pil-
lar of our community. Congratulations on 50 
years of reporting with integrity and diligence 
on the issues that matter most to Arizona. 
Here’s to the next 50 years and beyond.

RONNIE 
B. 
DELFIN ON THE OCCASION OF 
HIS RETIREMENT 
HON. MICHAEL F.Q. SAN NICOLAS 
OF GUAM 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, August 24, 2021 
Mr. SAN NICOLAS. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to commend and congratulate Colonel 
Ronnie B. Delfin on the occasion of his retire-
ment from the Guam Army National Guard 
after 31 years of service to our island and na-
tion. 
Colonel Delfin enlisted in the U.S. Army Re-
serve in 1990 and was assigned to the U.S. 
Army Reserve Headquarters as a medical 
specialist after completing his Basic Training 
and Combat Medic Advanced Individual Train-
ing. In August 1993, he enrolled in the Univer-
sity of Guam ROTC program and reported to 
active duty as a commissioned officer in May 
of 1996. He attended the Armor Officer Basic 
Course from August 1996 to January 1997, 
and his first duty assignment was with the 1st 
Battalion, 33rd Armor Regiment, 2nd Infantry 
Division in Fort Lewis, Washington, where he 
served as an Assistant S–2, Tank Platoon 
Leader, Mortar Platoon Leader, and Executive 
Officer. He was later reassigned to the 1st Bri-
gade 25th Infantry Division (Light) in Fort 
Lewis, Washington, as an Assistant BDE S–3. 
Colonel Delfin joined the Guam Army Na-
tional Guard and was assigned as the Security 
and Intelligence Officer in October 2000. He 
then joined the Active Guard and Reserve pro-
gram in September of 2001. His assignments 
in the AGR include Counterdrug Coordinator; 
Commander 1224th Engineer Detachment 
(Utilities); S3, 105th Troop Command; Sec-
retary of the General Staff; Commander, 203d 
RTI; and Commander, 94th Civil Support 
Team (WMD). Colonel Delfin mobilized and 
deployed with the 1224th Engineer Detach-
ment to Afghanistan in support of Operation 
Enduring Freedom. 
Colonel Delfin is a graduate of the Armor 
Officer Basic Course, the Infantry Officer Ad-
vance Course, Engineer Captain’s Career 
Course, the Combined Arms Services Staff 
School, and the United States Command and 
General Staff College Intermediate Level Edu-
cation, and the United States Army War Col-
lege. He holds a Bachelor’s degree in Public 
Administration, a Master of Management, and 
a Master in Strategic Studies from the War 
College. 
Colonel Delfin received a number of awards, 
such as the Bronze Star Medal, Meritorious 
Service Medal (4OLC), Army Commendation 
Medal (4OLC), Air Force Commendation 
Medal, Army Achievement Medal (2OLC), the 
Afghanistan Campaign Medal, the Combat Ac-
tion Badge, and the Parachutist Badge. He is 
a Distinguished Military Graduate from the 
University of Guam Army ROTC and a recipi-
ent of the General George C. Marshall Award. 
As Commander of Joint Task Force 671 and 
Chief of Joint Staff for the Guam National 
Guard, Colonel Delfin played a critical role in 
executing missions to support the Government 
of Guam with an efficient and comprehensive 
COVID–19 response. In addition to promoting 
an educational campaign, he facilitated the 
staffing of quarantine, community testing and 
food distribution sites, the full operation of 
emergency rooms and COVID–19 wards, the 
implementation of vital engineering projects, 
and much more. He tirelessly collaborated 
with local authorities to ensure the health and 
safety of our people, and it is with the support 
of his leadership that our island’s response ef-
forts have yielded the achievement of a largely 
vaccinated population. 
Colonel Delfin has and continues to serve 
as a fine example of leadership and dedicated 
his skills, knowledge, and training to elevating 
the quality of life for Americans in Guam and 
across the world. In addition to advancing our 
national objectives both at home and over-
seas, Colonel Delfin has further emphasized 
the importance of ensuring our communities 
are empowered with the tools to overcome 
challenges in the days that follow a completed 
military mission. 
Madam Speaker, I rise on behalf of the 
People of Guam, offering my greatest appre-
ciation to Colonel Ronnie B. Delfin for his de-
votion to our island and nation. I sincerely 
thank him for his many years of service and 
sacrifice, congratulate him on his well-earned 
retirement, and wish him and his family all the 
best in this new chapter of their lives.

RECOGNIZING 
QUINN 
CAROLINE 
FLAHERTY 
OF 
CHEEKTOWAGA, 
ON BECOMING AN EAGLE SCOUT 
HON. BRIAN HIGGINS 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, August 24, 2021 
Mr. HIGGINS of New York. Madam Speak-
er, I rise today to recognize Quinn Caroline 
Flaherty of Cheektowaga, and her tremendous 
achievement of becoming an Eagle Scout. 
In 2019, Scouts BSA officially started ac-
cepting young women into its ranks. Becoming 
an Eagle Scout is a difficult and involved proc-
ess and necessitates being a Life Scout for at 
least six months, earning at least 21 merit 
badges, demonstrating Scout Spirit and troop 
leadership, and creating an Eagle Project. The 
first young women to become Eagle Scouts 
were accepted in 2020. 
Quinn is a hard worker, dedicated to Scout-
ing. She earned more than 40 merit badges, 
and was chosen by her peers to hold the posi-
tion of Senior Patrol Leader. She splits her 
time between three different units, including a 
BSA Troop, Sea Scout Ship, and a Venture 
Crew. 
Quinn’s Eagle Project was largely centered 
around the COVID–19 Pandemic. While taking 
a COVID test, she remarked to her family that 
the hardworking staff looked like they needed 
a good meal. In a combination of looking to 
support frontline workers and the suffering res-
taurant industry, Quinn raised more than 
$10,000 to support local restaurants, providing 
more than 1,000 meals to essential workers 
and first responders. For her dedication to 
Scouting and her efforts to support the com-
munity, Quinn was nominated for Eagle Scout

of the Year by the Allegheny Highlands Coun-
cil. 
Quinn’s education never suffered despite 
her dedication to the Scouts BSA program. 
She remains a straight-A student, a class offi-
cer at Buffalo Academy of the Sacred Heart, 
and earned the service award for her class 
with more than 100 hours of volunteer work 
over the past year. 
I am proud to know Quinn personally and 
can speak to her sterling character. Quinn has 
loving 
and 
supportive 
parents, 
Michael 
Flaherty and Summer Przybylak, and a doting 
stepfather, 
Tom 
Przybylak, 
who 
himself 
earned his Eagle Scout in 1994. I am con-
fident that their proud guidance and support 
helped Quinn earn this remarkable achieve-
ment. 
In her Eagle Scout Letter of Ambition, after 
noting her family history in Scouting, Quinn 
stated, ‘‘I joined Scouting because I wanted to 
do something different, and a girl joining a 
century-old all-boy program was about as dif-
ferent as you could get.’’ Quinn closed her let-
ter by saying, ‘‘I am a girl with dreams, a girl 
with plans. I am a girl with hope for the future. 
Now I get to add Eagle Scout to that list.’’ 
Madam Speaker, Quinn certainly does get 
to add that to the list. I ask that my colleagues 
join me in congratulating Quinn Caroline 
Flaherty of Cheektowaga on her achievement 
of becoming an Eagle Scout, and thanking her 
for her service to our community.

RECOGNIZING 
MAY 
RANCH 
FOR 
BEING 
AWARDED 
THE 
2021 
LEOPOLD 
CONSERVATION 
AWARD 
HON. KEN BUCK 
OF COLORADO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, August 24, 2021 
Mr. BUCK. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
recognize May Ranch of Lamar, Colorado for 
receiving the 2021 Colorado Leopold Con-
servation Award. 
The Leopold Conservation Award Program, 
named after conservationist Aldo Leopold, rec-
ognizes and celebrates voluntary land con-
servation by private agricultural landowners. 
Each year, only one landowner in each of the 
participating states is given this award. Owned 
and operated by the Dallas and Brenda May 
family, the May Ranch of Lamar was given 
this award for 2021. 
The May Ranch exemplifies how livestock 
and wildlife can thrive together. Through col-
laborations with various wildlife and conserva-
tion organizations, the Mays have planted na-
tive trees, installed wildlife-friendly fences, and 
managed grazing on the ranch’s grasslands. 
With the wetlands on the ranch serving as an 
oasis for birds, their grass-fed beef is mar-
keted as ‘‘Raised on Bird Friendly Land.’’ The 
Mays have shown commitment to not only the 
conservation of the ecosystem on May Ranch, 
but to the agricultural way of life that is so im-
portant to Eastern Colorado. 
On behalf of the 4th Congressional District 
of Colorado, I am honored to celebrate this 
special recognition of the May Ranch as the 
2021 Leopold Conservation Award recipient. 
HONORING HERMAN KLEINER 
HON. DEREK KILMER 
OF WASHINGTON 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, August 24, 2021 
Mr. KILMER. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to extend my sincere congratulations and 
birthday wishes to one of my constituents, 
Herman Kleiner, who is celebrating his 100th 
birthday on Tuesday, August 24, 2021. 
Herman was born into a Jewish family to 
Pauline and Morris Kleiner, in Tacoma, Wash-
ington, August 24th, 1921. A proud product of 
the Tacoma Public School system, Herman at-
tended Bryant, Jason Lee, and Stadium High 
School and went on to attend the College of 
Puget Sound where he majored in sociology 
and became a member of the Delta Kappa Psi 
fraternity. During World War II, Herman served 
in the United States Air Force and, upon his 
return, went into business with his father, Mor-
ris, at Model Lumber Company. 
Mr. Kleiner recalls working with his father for 
many years—including his school age years— 
as the two had a wonderful relationship. He 
would work at the lumberyard during the year 
and then go to Aleph Zadik Aleph (AZA) sum-
mer youth camp at the end of every summer. 
He became a member of the AZA and was 
presented with an opportunity to attend a na-
tional AZA Convention with the debate team, 
which he really enjoyed doing. Mr. Kleiner and 
many friends formed the first Aleph Zadik 
Aleph chapter in Tacoma. 
After his retirement in the early 1990’s, Mr. 
Kleiner and his spouse Barbara had the pleas-
ure of welcoming Russian Jews from the So-
viet Union who were coming to the United 
States. Through their work and service, they 
were able to aid in the resettlement of about 
33 Jewish families from the Soviet Union, 
helping to secure apartments before they ar-
rived, assisting with furnishings and household 
goods, and transporting them from the airport 
to their new homes. Recounting his experi-
ence Mr. Kleiner recalled, ‘‘It was absolutely 
one of the most wonderous parts of our life.’’ 
In addition to his work welcoming Russian 
Jews into our community, Mr. Kleiner’s pas-
sion for serving his community and giving 
back can be seen in his active engagement 
with numerous civic organizations throughout 
Tacoma, including: Temple Beth El, United 
Jewish Appeal, the Jewish Cemetery Board, 
and the Stadium Alumni Association. 
Madam Speaker, it is an honor today to cel-
ebrate Mr. Herman Kleiner on his 100th birth-
day, whose love for his community has never 
wavered and whose service to his country and 
community is greatly appreciated and will be 
long remembered.

Mr. 
LARSON 
of 
Connecticut. 
Madam 
Speaker, I was not in attendance to cast my

of 2021. 
Had I been present, I would have voted

HONORING PAM CARMICHAEL AS 
IOWAN OF THE WEEK 
HON. CYNTHIA AXNE 
OF IOWA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, August 24, 2021 
Mrs. AXNE. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
recognize Pam Carmichael, a tireless advo-
cate for stable, affordable, and quality hous-
ing, as Iowan of the Week. 
Pam’s passion for housing advocacy started 
while she was studying political science, soci-
ology, and social work at the University of 
Iowa. In her time as a student, Pam counseled 
renters at a tenants’ rights organization and 
worked on housing ordinances that later be-
came law. In 1980, she started working as a 
housing counselor at HOME Inc., a nonprofit 
housing organization in Des Moines. 
Pam served as the executive director of 
HOME Inc. from 1984 until her upcoming re-
tirement this year, and she has participated in 
various advocacy efforts through this role. She 
has worked on multiple legislative projects, 
from pushing for infrastructure improvements, 
to creating Iowa’s Shelter Assistance Fund. 
Pam also helped create the Polk County 
Housing Trust Fund and the Des Moines and 
Iowa Coalitions for the Homeless. Those are 
just a couple of examples of all the work Pam 
has done. 
Her breadth of knowledge in housing issues 
spans from home buyer education to coun-
seling, revitalization programs, landlord edu-
cation and more. Pam’s expertise has been in-
credibly valuable and helpful to thousands of 
people in Des Moines, and she said she feels 
very blessed to see the number of people 
she’s helped. 
Pam mentioned she’s most proud of having 
worked with so many incredible colleagues 
who also believe everyone has a right to safe, 
affordable housing. She also appreciates the 
caring people in Des Moines, and the way that 
the community comes together in a crisis. 
As for her post-retirement plans, Pam is tak-
ing at least one year to work on her own 
house for a change. After a year, she’ll get 
back into helping people, whether that be in 
housing or mental health services. 
I’d like to take a moment to congratulate 
Pam on her retirement and thank her for all 
the work she has done to help our families in 
Des Moines. Pam said: ‘‘Home is a place we 
all need, and without it, we won’t flourish,’’ and 
I completely agree with her. That’s why I will 
continue to fight in Congress to support afford-
able housing initiatives, just as Pam has done 
her whole career. It is my pleasure to recog-
nize Pam Carmichael as Iowan of the Week.

country and his passion for being a positive 
and thoughtful force throughout his long and 
colorful 
life, 
including 
his 
work 
as 
a 
councilmember, 
his 
33-year 
career 
with 
CalTrans, and his service in the United States 
Air Force. I join the people of Morro Bay in 
thanking Red Davis for his service to his com-
munity, his state, and his Nation. 
Prior to being elected to the Morro Bay City 
Council, Red served on a variety of City ad 
hoc committees, including the General Plan 
Advisory Committee, and volunteered for nu-
merous community organizations including the 
Morro Bay Chamber of Commerce, Friends of 
the Morro Bay Library and Bike SLO County. 
Red began his service as Councilmember in 
2017 and won a second four-year term in No-
vember 2020. Councilmember Davis was in-
strumental, along with his Council colleagues, 
in moving forward the Water Reclamation Fa-
cility, stabilizing and improving the City’s finan-
cial condition, offshore wind energy, and en-
hancing communication with the community. I 
know from personal experience how important 
local leaders are in our nation, and Red was 
instrumental in helping guide his community 
and region through our recent difficult times. 
Red retired from CalTrans in 1996 as a 
project manager, after 33 years of service, 
and proudly served his country in the U.S. Air 
Force, retiring as Senior Master Sergeant. 
Those who knew Red well have commented 
on how he worked tirelessly to advance and 
improve the quality of life for the entire Morro 
Bay community. Red’s strong work ethic, his 
clear style of communication, and his genuine 
care for the environment and the people of 
Morro Bay’s citizens, businesses, and environ-
ment allowed him to make a positive and last-
ing impact on the City. Many have commented 
on Red’s kindness, compassion, and his gen-
erosity. It is clear Red will be missed as well 
as remembered for many years to come. 
As passionate cyclists, Red and his wife 
Gail found the time and energy to share their 
enthusiasm with the community. Red served 
as president of the San Luis Obispo Bike Club 
for eight years, chaired the Morro Bay Citizens 
Bike Committee and the County Bicycle Advi-
sory Committee, and was a founding member 
and vice president of Bike SLO County. In 
2015 the San Luis Obispo County Board of 
Supervisors honored Red for service to the 
local bicycling community by designating the 
Los Osos Valley Road bike lanes between 
Foothill Boulevard and South Bay Boulevard 
as the ‘‘Red Davis Bikeway.’’ 
Madam Speaker, I ask you, and our col-
leagues here in the U.S. House of Represent-
atives, to join me in recognizing Red for his 
service to his community and our Nation, and 
in offering our condolences to Red’s wife Gail, 
his daughter Catherine Sullivan, son-in-law 
Pat, and Red’s granddaughters, and to all 
those in Morro Bay and beyond who know and 
love Red. I thank Red.

RECOGNIZING 
THE 
HISTORICAL 
ACHIEVEMENT OF FIVE BLACK 
COUNTY COMMISSIONERS 
HON. FREDERICA S. WILSON 
OF FLORIDA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, August 24, 2021 
Ms. WILSON of Florida. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to recognize the historical achieve-
ment of the five black commissioners serving 
on the Miami-Dade County Board of Commis-
sioners. 
For the first time in its 185-year history, the 
citizens of Miami-Dade County are being rep-
resented by five black County Commissioners. 
This achievement is held by Vice Chairman 
Oliver 
Gilbert, 
III, 
Commissioners 
Jean 
Monestime, Keon Hardemon, Danielle Cohen 
Higgins, and Kionne McGhee. 
Vice-Chairman Oliver Gilbert III representing 
District 1 is a seasoned attorney that comes to 
the Board of County Commissioners after 
serving his hometown of Miami Gardens as its 
two-term mayor. He is a true advocate for the 
youth and the economic development of his 
community. He served formerly as the presi-
dent of the African American mayors Associa-
tion, and also held a seat on the board of di-
rectors of several boards, including the Na-
tional League of Cities. 
Commissioner Jean Monestime representing 
District 2 is the first Haitian American to rep-
resent the Board of County Commissioners 
after being elected in 2010. In 2014. he was 
unanimously chosen to serve as Chairman of 
the Miami-Dade Board of County Commis-
sioners for two years. He is a former City of 
North Miami Councilman and Vice-Mayor. 
Commissioner Monestime is an advocate for 
equal justice. 
Commissioner Keon Hardemon representing 
District 3 is a Miami native. He holds tight the 
values that his family instilled in him: edu-
cation, integrity, and most importantly service 
to the community. Prior to joining the Board of 
County 
Commissioners, 
Commissioner 
Hardemon served as a City of Miami Commis-
sioner. In addition, he served as the Chairman 
of the Southeast Overtown and Park West 
Community Redevelopment Agency (CRA). 
He also served as a Miami-Dade County As-
sistant Public Defender where he represented 
hundreds of clients from the Miami-Dade 
County Community. 
Commissioner Danielle Cohen Higgins rep-
resenting District 8 is the daughter of Jamai-
can immigrants, an attorney, and a small busi-
ness owner. She is the first of her family to 
graduate from college and went on to grad-
uate from law school. Commissioner Higgins 
is dedicated to serving small businesses and 
environmental sustainability measures. 
Commissioner Kionne McGhee representing 
District 9 is a South Dade native coming to the 
Board of County Commissioners from the Flor-
ida House of Representatives where he re-
cently served as the Minority Leader. Commis-
sioner McGhee is also an accomplished attor-
ney and author. 
This historic group of commissioners bring 
with them experience, political and govern-
mental acumen, passion, and an abundance 
of commitment towards improving the lives of 
Miami-Dade County residents. The foundation 
laid by their predecessors Earl Caroll (1968– 
1972), Edward T. Graham (1972–1975), Neal 
F. Adams (1975–1979), Barbara Carey-Shuler 
(1979–1990 & 1996–2005), Arthur E. Teele, 
Jr. (1990–1996), James Burke (1990–1998), 
Betty T. Ferguson (1993–2000), Dorrin D. 
Rolle (1998–2006), Dennis C. Moss (1993– 
2020), Barbara J. Jordan (2004–2020), and 
Audrey M. Edmonson (2005–2020) ensures a 
brighter future for all of Miami-Dade County. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues and 
all Americans to please join me in recognizing 
these Miami-Dade Board of County Commis-
sioners for their contributions and for their 
commitment to the diverse citizens of our 
community, state and country.

HONORING AIDAN O’BRIEN CHINN 
HON. C. SCOTT FRANKLIN 
OF FLORIDA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, August 24, 2021 
Mr. C. SCOTT FRANKLIN of Florida. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today to congratulate 
Aidan O’Brien Chinn for earning the rank of 
Eagle Scout in Troop 268 of Clermont, FL. 
Eagle Scout is the highest honor a Boy Scout 
can earn and only four percent achieve it. This 
honor requires years of effort to develop the 
necessary leadership, service, and outdoor 
skills. To earn it, Aidan organized a team of 
12 volunteers to restore a hurricane-damaged 
greenhouse that provides community food as-
sistance. The leadership skills he has learned 
through the Boy Scouts already benefit our 
community and will continue to help in count-
less ways. Aidan began scouting as a Cub 
Scout in 2012 and recently served his troop as 
Senior Patrol leader. This fall, Aidan plans to 
continue his education at Rollins College. 
On behalf of the Fifteenth Congressional 
District of Florida, congratulations again to 
Aidan O’Brien Chinn for becoming an Eagle 
Scout. We are proud of his continued success 
and thank him for his dedication to making our 
community a better place.

1ST CAVALRY DIVISION 100TH 
ANNIVERSARY 
HON. ROGER WILLIAMS 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, August 24, 2021 
Mr. WILLIAMS of Texas. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to recognize the 100th anniversary 
of the 1st Cavalry Division. 
Formed in 1921, the division is based at 
Fort Hood, Texas, which I am proud to rep-
resent in Congress. 
This 1st Cavalry division is unique in that 
they have worn many hats over the years— 
they have served in cavalry, infantry, assault, 
and armored capacities. 
The honorable men and women of the 1st 
Cav have served in many of our nation’s wars; 
World War II, the Korean War, the Persian 
Gulf, Iraq, and in Afghanistan—and they have 
exhibited extraordinary grit and an unwavering 
commitment to duty above self. 
In all that they do, they have honorably an-
swered the call to serve our country and de-
fend freedom and liberty around the world. 
It is my great honor to recognize their con-
tributions and thank them for their 100 years 
of enduring service, duty, patriotism, and brav-
ery. 
In God we trust.

RECOGNIZING LEWIS H. WEBBER, 
A TRUE WORKING-CLASS CHAM-
PION 
HON. BRIAN HIGGINS 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, August 24, 2021 
Mr. HIGGINS of New York. Madam Speak-
er, I rise today to recognize Lewis Webber, 
the President of Steelworkers Organization of 
Active Retirees (SOAR) Chapter 4–6, for a 
lifetime of fighting for the working class. 
Lewis Webber was born days before the 
Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor in December 
of 1941 so he was always ready for a good 
fight. Advocating for the workers at Bethlehem 
Steel was in his blood, as many of his rel-
atives, including his father, were employed 
there. Growing up in a union household, he 
and his brother heard all the stories from their 
father about the strikes at Bethlehem Steel, in-
cluding the famous 53-day 1952 Steelworkers 
strike, ending with a victory for the hard-work-
ing Steelworkers. 
It was not a surprise that both Lewis and his 
brother would also go on to work many years 
of their lives at Bethlehem Steel. Lewis started 
working at Bethlehem Steel in October of 
1964. He was a member in three separate 
unions: 
United 
Steelworkers, 
Truckdrivers 
Local Union, and the United Autoworkers. As 
a member of the United Steelworkers, he re-
calls fighting to make sure that the proper 
withholding was taken out of the employees 
checks. Later, in 1985, Mr. Webber officially 
won a grievance against Bethlehem Steel, 
providing 22 workers an additional $238 a 
week for two years, and a pension for the rest 
of their lives. 
When Bethlehem Steel shut its doors, the 
Western New York community was dev-
astated; however, that didn’t stop Lewis 
Webber from continuing to fight for those who 
had worked there. He joined the Steelworkers 
Organization of Active Retirees (SOAR), 
Chapter 4–6 and put the skills he learned from 
earlier battles to work as he rose in the ranks 
of leadership becoming Trustee in 1997, Vice 
President in 2007, and President of the Steel-
workers Organization of Active Retirees, 
Chapter 4–6 in 2008. There are 430 members 
of SOAR, Chapter 4–6 who rely on his leader-
ship today. 
Lewis Webber always says that you can 
never fight these battles alone. His number 
one supporter was his wife, Beverly who un-
fortunately passed away in 2011. She was 
also Secretary of the Steelworkers Organiza-
tion of Active Retirees, Chapter 4–6. His chil-
dren Rosemary, LuAnn, and Kathleen, grand- 
children, and great-grandchildren are always 
by his side, fighting the good fight. 
Mr. Webber joined our fight over a decade 
ago to help former Bethlehem Steel employ-
ees receive compensation under the Energy 
Employees Occupational Illness Compensa-
tion Program (EEOICP) and he continues to 
work with my office to ensure eligible retirees 
receive the benefits they deserve. Over $300 
million has been paid out to workers and their 
families after they were exposed to radiation 
while working at Bethlehem Steel. 
Lewis Webber offered many words of ad-
vice, including ‘‘I am not doing this to make 
people millionaires; I am doing this to get 
them what they need to get by in this world. 
I am not doing this to help just the Steel-
workers; I am doing this to help all Ameri-
cans,’’ and, ‘‘Always fight using your brains, 
not your fists. At the end of the day your 
knowledge of the contract will be more likely 
to help you win the battle.’’ His words dem-
onstrate his commitment to his fellow workers 
and his lifetime of experience advocating for 
the interests of Steelworkers. 
Many Bethlehem Steel retirees and their 
families who live in Western New York are 
better off because Lewis Webber has never 
stopped and will never stop fighting for them. 
Madam Speaker, I ask that my colleagues join 
me in honoring the lifelong commitment that 
Lewis Webber has shown to the former em-
ployees of Bethlehem Steel, the greater West-
ern New York community, and the United 
States as a whole.

P. 
HARKINS 
FOR 
25 
YEARS OF MILITARY SERVICE 
HON. RICHARD HUDSON 
OF NORTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, August 24, 2021 
Mr. HUDSON. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to honor Lieutenant Colonel Shawn P. Harkins 
for 25 years of distinguished military service. 
LTC Harkins has made immeasurable con-
tributions to our great nation and continues to 
personify the core U.S. Army values of honor,

ice. He has served in various positions 
throughout his career, culminating as the 3rd 
Special Forces Group (Airborne) Executive Of-
ficer at Fort Bragg. 
Over the course of his extraordinary career, 
LTC Harkins has answered the call of duty 
many times. He has deployed in excess of 34 
months overseas in support of Operation EN-
DURING FREEDOM and Operation IRAQI 
FREEDOM, and his leadership has directly in-
fluenced political stability across the globe. As 
the 3rd Special Forces Group (Airborne) Exec-
utive Officer, LTC Harkins managed a staff of 
2,500 soldiers and civilians and he is credited 
with producing change in the areas of mainte-
nance, readiness, and processes. 
LTC Harkins retires as a recipient of mul-
tiple awards and decorations and embodies all 
the qualities of a selfless hero who has an-
swered the call to serve. Our state and coun-
try are better because of citizens like him. 
As Fort Bragg’s Congressman, I know I 
speak for our nation and community when I 
say we are truly grateful for LTC Harkins’ ex-
traordinary service and cannot thank him 
enough. I would like to offer my sincerest ap-
preciation and wish him success in his future 
endeavors. 
Madam Speaker, please join me today in 
honoring Lieutenant Colonel Shawn P. Harkins 
for 25 years of military service.

century of service to the Fisk University stu-
dents, community and the state of Tennessee.

BONNIE WATSON COLEMAN, LAUREN UNDER-
WOOD, and NIKEMA WILLIAMS. 
Fisk Graduate and Pi Chapter initiated 
Chairperson Kimmie Jackson and current Pi 
Chapter President Taylor Woodard graciously 
welcomed and thanked the audience for join-
ing this inaugural and auspicious occasion 
while inspiring all to take action and uphold 
the sorority’s purpose of being ‘‘Service To All 
Mankind.’’ 
Representative SHEILA JACKSON LEE (TX) 
noted that Pi Chapter was the first under-
graduate chapter in the South Atlantic Region 
and that the women of Pi Chapter are known 
for their honor, academic prowess, and leader-
ship skills. She compared Rep. WILSON to So-
journer Truth who never stepped away her vi-
sion and served as a leader in education and 
civil rights. Rep. WILSON founded the 5000 
Role Models of Excellence Project and was a 
leader in the demand to find the 276 Nigerian 
girls kidnapped by Boko Haram. 
Representative ALMA ADAMS (NC) praised Pi 
Chapter as being the most civically engaged 
women of goodwill and good work beyond 
measure. She noted that Honoree WILSON the 
5000 Role Models founder has always been a 
champion of the underserved and that like her 
fellow Pi Chapter graduates illuminate the op-
portunities available to women across the 
country and the world. 
Representative EDDIE

that its Centennial Anniversary coincides with 
the release of the documentary film TWENTY 
PEARLS about Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, 
the first black Greek letter organization found-
ed in 1908. Representative UNDERWOOD also 
celebrated Honoree WILSON’s AKA legacy as 
the 11th South Atlantic Regional Director and 
First Pi Chapter alumnae to serve in the 
United States Congress. 
Representative NIKEMA WILLIAMS (GA) hon-
ored Pi Chapter for reaching its 100-year mile-
stone, its success, strength and courage, and 
for showing what leadership looks like and 
changing the world. Rep. WILLIAMS who now 
holds the seat vacated by the passing of Fisk 
graduate and civil rights icon, the Honorable 
John Lewis, praised Congresswoman WILSON 
for her decade of service fighting for civil 
rights and voting rights in Congress and hold-
ing America to its promise. 
Representative JOYCE BEATTY (OH), current 
Chair of the Congressional Black Caucus, 
which is celebrating its 50th Anniversary and 
is known as the ‘‘conscious of the Congress,’’ 
saluted and applauded Pi Chapter’s orga-
nizers, board members, executive staff and all 
involved in the Centennial Celebration. She 
saluted Alpha Kappa Alpha for blazing a trail 
of excellence for over 100 years. CBC Chair-
woman BEATTY highlighted Congresswoman 
WILSON’s great successes in establishing the 
Commission on the Social Status of Black 
Men and Boys, founding of the 5000 Role 
Models of Excellence Project, and efforts to 
fight for and assist the young girls in Nigeria 
kidnapped by Boko Haram. Representative 
BEATTY also noted Representative WILSON’s 
crucial ongoing service on the Transportation 
and Infrastructure Committee; chairs the Edu-
cation and Labor Committee’s Higher Edu-
cation 
and 
Workforce 
Investment 
Sub-
committee and serves on the Early Childhood, 
Elementary, and Secondary Education Sub-
committee of the United States Congress and 
the Biden Administration’s economic recovery 
plans for the American people. 
On April 6, 1921, Pi Chapter was chartered 
at Meharry Medical College by Pauline Kigh 
Reed, Druceilla Barnadanoe, Clarise Bartlett, 
Georgia Blackmore, Wihelmina Bowles, Mil-
dred Harper, Lelia Lyon and Marie Williams. Pi 
Chapter was the first undergraduate chapter 
chartered in the South Eastern Region. The 
chapter was later moved to the historic Fisk 
University in 1927. 
Over the past 100 years, Pi Chapter has ini-
tiated more than one thousand sorority sisters 
who wear the beautiful colors of salmon pink 
and apple green. The chapter’s motto is ‘‘The 
Fine Light of Pi.’’ 
Today, Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, Incor-
porated and the sisters of the Pi Chapter 
proudly stand firm in the sorority’s mission to 
cultivate and encourage high scholastic and 
ethical standards, to promote unity and friend-
ship among college women, to study and help 
alleviate 
problems 
concerning 
girls 
and 
women in order to improve their social stature, 
to maintain a progressive interest in college 
life, and to be of ‘‘Service to All Mankind.’’ 
Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues and 
all Americans to please join me in congratu-
lating Pi Chapter of Alpha Kappa Alpha Soror-
ity, Incorporated on its Centennial Anniversary 
and commend it for its contributions to edu-
cation and for its commitment to the commu-
nity, state of Tennessee and our country. 
HONORING LEON J. ARP 
HON. H. MORGAN GRIFFITH 
OF VIRGINIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, August 24, 2021 
Mr. GRIFFITH. Madam Speaker, I rise in 
honor of Leon J. Arp of Blacksburg, Virginia, 
who passed away on July 23, 2021, at the 
age of 91. Mr. Arp was a veteran and busi-
nessman who greatly contributed to the 
Blacksburg community. 
Mr. Arp was born in Norway, Iowa on June 
30, 1930, to Hugo and Leova Arp. After grad-
uating from Walford High School in 1948, he 
spent four years in the U.S. Air Force during 
the Korean War, serving in air reconnais-
sance. He married his wife, Kathleen Schulte, 
in 1955. 
He went on to earn his Ph.D. from Iowa 
State University. Mr. Arp later moved to Vir-
ginia to serve as a professor emeritus of Me-
chanical 
Engineering 
at 
Virginia 
Tech 
Blacksburg where he taught for 25 years. In 
his time there he earned various distinctions 
and honors for his teaching and research. 
Mr. Arp is best known for developing the 
Arp Respirator in the late 1960s. This design 
was created to aid infants facing respiratory 
distress syndrome—at the time the leading 
cause of infant death in the first week of life. 
This device is responsible for saving hundreds 
of infants’ lives. 
A 1970 Life Magazine profiled this life-sav-
ing tool. The article notes that Mr. Arp de-
signed a respirator that could handle the deli-
cacy of premature infants after nearly losing 
one of his own children to respiratory syn-
drome. This machine attended an infant’s 
gasp for breath more sensitively than any de-
vice in existence at the time. Mr. Arp had con-
tinual innovation throughout his career and re-
tained more than 25 patents. 
Mr. Arp was preceded in death by his son, 
William. He is survived by his wife of 66 years, 
Kathleen; his children, Nicholas, John, and Jo-
seph; and eight grandchildren and one great- 
granddaughter. I would like to extend to them 
my condolences.

HONORING THE LIFE AND LEGACY 
OF KELSEY BEGAYE 
HON. TOM O’HALLERAN 
OF ARIZONA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, August 24, 2021 
Mr. O’HALLERAN. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor the life of Kelsey Begaye, the 
fifth president of the Navajo Nation, who 
passed away this month at the age of 70. 
A Vietnam veteran, a devoted public serv-
ant, and a leader in faith, Kelsey Begaye 
served his country, his community, and his 
people for decades. 
In 1969, he enlisted in the U.S. Army, serv-
ing in Vietnam as a specialist fourth radio op-
erator for four years. 
In the years that followed, he brought dedi-
cation and compassion to his work as a sub-
stance abuse counselor, a representative of 
the Kaibeto Chapter in the Navajo Nation 
Council, and as the fifth president of the Nav-
ajo Nation. 
Through countless roles, he leaves behind a 
legacy of faith and a fierce desire to change 
the lives of those living in his community for 
the better. 
My wife and I are keeping Mr. Begaye’s 
family, loved ones, and the Navajo Nation in 
our prayers as we mourn his passing.

IN RECOGNITION OF THE 50TH AN-
NIVERSARY 
OF 
FIRSTSTATE 
BANK 
HON. MIKE ROGERS 
OF ALABAMA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, August 24, 2021 
Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to recognize the 50th anniversary 
of FirstState Bank. 
In late 1968, Mr. J.B. McCord, Gen. Robert 
Duke, Mr. J.O. McCain and Mr. Don Hogan 
worked with attorney Mr. T. Reuben Bell to 
create a local bank to serve their community. 
FirstState Bank first opened in 1971 as First 
State Bank of Lineville. A few years later, the 
bank changed to First State Bank of Clay 
County. As the bank grew, another location 
was added in Wedowee and the name was 
changed to what it is today, FirstState Bank. 
The original organizers include: Mr. J.B. 
McCord, Mr. Bill Ogle, Mr. L.D. Walker, Mr. 
Bernard Spurlin, Mrs. Bessie McCrary, Mr. 
Robert Howell, Ms. Nina Faye Bonner, Gen-
eral Robert W. Duke, Mr. Grover Bearden, Mr. 
W.W. Young, Mr. Don Hogan, Mr. Lester 
Proctor, Mr. Charles Taylor and Mr. J.O. 
McCain. 
Johnny Appleby was the first employee 
hired by the bank and worked there until his 
passing in 2019. 
Today, FirstState Bank is thriving under the 
leadership of President and CEO Steve Fos-
ter. 
The bank serves both Clay and Randolph 
Counties. 
Madam Speaker, please join me in recog-
nizing the 50th anniversary of FirstState Bank.

REMEMBERING GERALD WESLEY 
DONOVAN 
HON. STENY H. HOYER 
OF MARYLAND 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, August 24, 2021 
Mr. HOYER. Madam Speaker, I rise to pay 
tribute to a dear friend and a great Marylander 
who passed away on July 31. Gerald Wesley 
Donovan was not just the former Mayor of 
Chesapeake Beach in Calvert County, Mary-
land. He was the heart and soul of the town 
and the center of its community for decades. 
Gerald dedicated his life to preserving the 
memory of Chesapeake Beach as it had been 
generations prior and working to reinvigorate it 
with a new energy for the twenty-first century 
and as a place where future generations of 
Marylanders and visitors could enjoy all the 
best the town and it surroundings could offer. 
Having grown up in the county and attended 
Calver High School, Gerald was raised with a 
love of service, a love of learning, and a love 
of country. In addition to attending Baltimore 
College of Commerce, Prince George’s Com-
munity College, and the University of Mary-
land, he enlisted in the U.S. Marine Corps in

1968 and served on active duty until 1971. 
After serving on the Chesapeake Beach Town 
Council for seven years, Gerald was ap-
pointed the town’s mayor in 1983. The fol-
lowing year, his neighbors elected him to con-
tinue in that office and returned him again and 
again for a total of thirty-four years and six 
consecutive terms. During that time, he 
oversaw major projects that renewed Chesa-
peake Beach as a tourist destination, including 
its Water Park, Railway Trail, Veterans Memo-
rial Park, Bayfront Park, and the annual fire-
works show. Each winter, he expressed his 
joy for the holiday season by securing funding 
from the council to illuminate the town in fes-
tive lights. 
Over those same years, Gerald developed a 
vision to revitalize the old Chesapeake Beach 
Resort built by Otto Mears in 1900. The re-
dedication of that property in 2004 as the Rod 
’N’ Reel resort was the culmination of years of 
work for Gerald and his local business part-
ners. It has become a major destination in 
Maryland’s Fifth District, attracting vacationers 
from across the country and around the world 
and helping to grow tourism and support jobs 
for the local economy. 
In addition to serving as Mayor, Gerald also 
gave back to his community and his country 
by helping to lead the fight against cancer. 
Over thirty years, the annual Celebration of 
Life gala dinner he hosted with his brother, 
Fred, in memory of their father Fred Donovan, 
Sr. raised more than $4 million for the Amer-
ican Cancer Society. Having attended these 
dinners year after year, I can attest that 
Gerald’s passion for curing and treating can-
cer and helping those afflicted only grew over 
time. 
Early on, Gerald also joined the North 
Beach Volunteer Fire Department and later 
was chosen as its lifetime president. He also 
served on the executive committee of the 
Maryland Tourism Board, as a member of the 
Maryland Restaurant Association’s board, and 
as Chairman of the Calvert County Democratic 
Central Committee. Gerald was also a pioneer 
in the creation of the Chesapeake Beach Rail-
way Museum. 
As he got older, Gerald recognized the im-
portance of preparing the next generations to 
carry on the work of making Chesapeake 
Beach and Calvert County a wonderful place 
to live and work and preserving its heritage. 
He became a mentor to so many young peo-
ple active in public service in the town and in 
the county, making time to help them find their 
own ways to give back to their community and 
run for local office. Gerald worked to pass on 
his unparalleled knowledge of the town and its 
history, and when he retired and left office in 
2008, he passed the torch to a new genera-
tion now carrying on his work. 
In retirement, Gerald loved to drive around 
Chesapeake Beach and revel in its splendor 
and success, proud of the work he and so 
many others had put in over the decades to 
breathe new life into the town. After he passed 
away earlier this summer, his friends and 
neighbors gathered on the sidewalks to pay a 
final tribute as Gerald’s funeral procession 
made its way through those same streets, es-
corted by the Calvert County Sheriffs Depart-
ment and North Beach Volunteer Fire Depart-
ment vehicles. 
Gerald will be missed by so many of us who 
were fortunate enough to call him a friend. I 
join in offering my condolences to his wonder-
ful wife and partner Mary, to his children Wes-
ley, Ryan, Roger, Mary, and Veronica and 
their families, including his thirteen grand-
children and five great-grandchildren. May 
Gerald’s memory always be a blessing to 
them and to all the people of his beloved 
Chesapeake Beach and Calvert County.

RECOGNIZING THE 150TH ANNIVER-
SARY 
OF 
THE 
FOUNDING 
OF 
PLATTEVILLE, COLORADO 
HON. KEN BUCK 
OF COLORADO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, August 24, 2021 
Mr. BUCK. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
commemorate the 150th anniversary of the 
founding of Platteville, Colorado. 
The Colorado Gold Rush of 1857 brought 
an influx of frontiersmen through what is now 
Weld County, spurring population growth and 
the establishment of dozens of new towns and 
settlements. After the Denver Pacific Railroad 
reached the area in 1871, Platteville, Colo-
rado, was founded. With just one general 
store in the first years of its existence, 
Platteville has expanded to encompass sev-
eral banks, factories, hotels, and other retail 
establishments. The Platte River’s fertile valley 
has long been known for its livestock and 
poultry, with over 200 farms now located in 
the surrounding area. Today, Platteville boasts 
more than 2,500 residents who are proud to 
call Colorado their home. 
On behalf of the 4th Congressional District 
of Colorado, I am honored to celebrate this 
special occasion alongside my constituents 
who call Platteville home.

HONORING ROBERT S. ‘‘BOB’’ 
LYNCH 
HON. PAUL A. GOSAR 
OF ARIZONA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, August 24, 2021 
Mr. GOSAR. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to recognize a great man, a great lawyer, and 
a great Arizonan. I speak of Robert S. ‘‘Bob’’ 
Lynch. 
Mr. Lynch is a proud graduate of the Univer-
sity of Arizona, obtaining a Bachelor of Arts 
(1961) and Bachelor of Laws (1964) degrees 
and a Master of Laws degree with a speciali-
zation in natural resources law from George 
Washington University (1972). Well known as 
one of the most competent water lawyers in a 
state where water law governs prosperity, Bob 
represented clients before Congress and the 
state legislature. His practice also included 
representation of clients before the Federal 
Energy Regulatory Commission and the Ari-
zona Corporation Commission and in state 
and federal courts. His litigation experience in-
cludes matters before the U.S. Supreme 
Court, as well as cases before 9 of the 13 fed-
eral appellate courts, and three state supreme 
courts. 
One area in which I was able to get to know 
Bob included his work as counsel and Treas-
urer to the Irrigation and Electrical Districts’ 
Association of Arizona (IEDA). The irrigation 
districts form a key part of the water and agri-
cultural infrastructure in Arizona. Bob guided 
this important group for years and guided 
them well. 
Professionally, Bob devoted most of his 
practice to water, electricity, and environ-
mental law issues. Bob was appointed in June 
1996 by the Speaker of the U.S. House of 
Representatives to the seven-member Federal 
Water Rights Task Force, a federal advisory 
committee, established by the Federal Agri-
culture Improvement and Reform Act, P.L. 
104–127. I also found Bob to be an invaluable 
advisor on energy and water issues. Bob was 
devoted to several organizations related to his 
specialty, including Serving on the Advisory 
Committee of the American Public Power As-
sociation and on the Board of Directors of its 
political action committee, PowerPAC (Chair-
man 2000–2007). He is a 2003 recipient of 
APPA’s 
Kramer-Preston 
Personal 
Service 
Award. Bob also served on the North Amer-
ican Electric Reliability Corporation’s Legal Ad-
visory Committee, the Water and Property 
Rights (Chair) and Energy Issues Committees 
of the National Water Resources Association, 
as well as on task forces on the Endangered 
Species Act of both national associations. He 
served as President (1991–1996) and Chair-
man of the Board (1996–2000) of the Central 
Arizona Project Association. He belongs to the 
Arizona, Maricopa County, and Federal Bar 
Associations, and is a member of the District 
of Columbia Bar. 
A gentleman of the highest order, Bob is 
also a scholar. His publications include ‘‘Com-
plying With NEPA: The Tortuous Path to an 
Adequate Environmental Impact Statement,’’ 
14 Arizona Law Review 717 (1973) and ‘‘The 
1973 CEQ Guidelines: Cautious Updating of 
the Environmental Impact Statement Process,’’ 
11 California Western Law Review 297 (1975). 
One case where Bob’s talents came through 
was the case, Davis v. Agua Sierra Re-
sources, L.L.C., 220 Ariz. 108, 203 P. 506 
(2009) vacating 217 Ariz. 386, 174 P. 3d 298 
(2008), where Bob successfully convinced the 
Arizona Supreme Court to overturn the Court 
of Appeals on a significant groundwater issue. 
Bob is a devoted husband to his wonderful 
wife, Anne, in addition to a giving father and 
grandfather. I can say that the joy of being a 
grandfather cannot be exceeded and I could 
see that joy in every conversation I had with 
Bob. I would like to take this moment out of 
day to let the world know that Arizona is 
blessed to have such a talented and good 
man like Bob Lynch.

in trying to register to vote in Mississippi in 
1962 and 1963. 
The various barriers, via literacy tests and 
intimidation, as well as the physical beatings 
endured by Fannie Lou Hamer and her com-
patriots remind us of the critical importance of 
the proactive right to vote. She was a civil 
rights leader fighting for voting rights and 
women’s rights. She dedicated her life to 
speaking up and out through her activism and 
campaigns for elected office. Her words con-
tinue to inspire and to underscore the impor-
tance of supporting the right to vote in the 
face of new barriers and new, surreptitious 
Jim Crow laws. 
Madam Speaker, I include in the RECORD 
the full text of her remarks delivered on that 
day in 1964. 
TESTIMONY BEFORE
THE CREDENTIALS COM-
MITTEE, DEMOCRATIC NATIONAL CONVENTION, 
ATLANTIC CITY, NEW JERSEY—AUGUST 22, 
1964 
Mr. Chairman, and to the Credentials Com-
mittee, my name is Mrs. Fannie Lou Hamer, 
and I live at 626 East Lafayette Street, 
Ruleville, Mississippi, Sunflower County, the 
home of Senator James O. Eastland, and 
Senator Stennis. 
It was the 31st of August in 1962 that eight-
een of us traveled twenty-six miles to the 
county courthouse in Indianola to try to reg-
ister to become first-class citizens. 
We was met in Indianola by policemen, 
Highway Patrolmen, and they only allowed 
two of us in to take the literacy test at the 
time. After we had taken this test and start-
ed back to Ruleville, we was held up by the 
City Police and the State Highway Patrol-
men and carried back to Indianola where the 
bus driver was charged that day with driving 
a bus the wrong color. 
After we paid the fine among us, we con-
tinued on to Ruleville, and Reverend Jeff 
Sunny carried me four miles in the rural 
area where I had worked as a timekeeper and 
sharecropper for eighteen years. I was met 
there by my children, who told me that the 
plantation owner was angry because I had 
gone down to try to register. 
After they told me, my husband came, and 
said the plantation owner was raising Cain 
because I had tried to register. Before he 
quit talking the plantation owner came and 
said, ‘‘Fannie Lou, do you know—did Pap 
tell you what I said?’’ 
And I said, ‘‘Yes, sir.’’ 
He said, ‘‘Well I mean that.’’ He said, ‘‘If 
you don’t go down and withdraw your reg-
istration, you will have to leave.’’ Said, 
‘‘Then if you go down and withdraw,’’ said, 
‘‘you still might have to go because we are 
not ready for that in Mississippi.’’ 
And I addressed him and told him and said, 
‘‘I didn’t try to register for you. I tried to 
register for myself.’’ I had to leave that same 
night. 
On the 10th of September 1962, sixteen bul-
lets was fired into the home of Mr. and Mrs. 
Robert Tucker for me. That same night two 
girls were shot in Ruleville, Mississippi. Also 
Mr. Joe McDonald’s house was shot in. 
And June the 9th, 1963, I had attended a 
voter registration workshop; was returning 
back to Mississippi. Ten of us was traveling 
by the Continental Trailway bus. When we 
got to Winona, Mississippi, which is Mont-
gomery County, four of the people got off to 
use the washroom, and two of the people—to 
use the restaurant—two of the people wanted 
to use the washroom. 
The four people that had gone in to use the 
restaurant was ordered out. During this time 
I was on the bus. But when I looked through 
the window and saw they had rushed out I 
got off of the bus to see what had happened. 
And one of the ladies said, ‘‘It was a State 
Highway Patrolman and a Chief of Police or-
dered us out.’’ 
I got back on the bus and one of the per-
sons had used the washroom got back on the 
bus, too. 
As soon as I was seated on the bus, I saw 
when they began to get the five people in a 
highway patrolman’s car. I stepped off of the 
bus to see what was happening and somebody 
screamed from the car that the five workers 
was in and said, ‘‘Get that one there.’’ When 
I went to get in the car, when the man told 
me I was under arrest, he kicked me. 
I was carried to the county jail and put in 
the booking room. They left some of the peo-
ple in the booking room and began to place 
us in cells. I was placed in a cell with a 
young woman called Miss Ivesta Simpson. 
After I was placed in the cell I began to hear 
sounds of licks and screams, I could hear the 
sounds of licks and horrible screams. And I 
could hear somebody say, ‘‘Can you say, ‘yes, 
sir,’ nigger? Can you say ‘yes, sir’?’’ 
And they would say other horrible names. 
She would say, ‘‘Yes, I can say ‘yes, sir.’ ’’ 
‘‘So, well, say it.’’ 
She said, ‘‘I don’t know you well enough.’’ 
They beat her, I don’t know how long. And 
after a while she began to pray, and asked 
God to have mercy on those people. 
And it wasn’t too long before three white 
men came to my cell. One of these men was 
a State Highway Patrolman and he asked me 
where I was from. I told him Ruleville and he 
said, ‘‘We are going to check this.’’ 
They left my cell and it wasn’t too long be-
fore they came back. He said, ‘‘You are from 
Ruleville all right,’’ and he used a curse 
word. And he said, ‘‘We are going to make 
you wish you was dead.’’ 
I was carried out of that cell into another 
cell where they had two Negro prisoners. The 
State Highway Patrolmen ordered the first 
Negro to take the blackjack. 
The first Negro prisoner ordered me, by or-
ders from the State Highway Patrolman, for 
me to lay down on a bunk bed on my face. 
I laid on my face and the first Negro began 
to beat. I was beat by the first Negro until he 
was exhausted. I was holding my hands be-
hind me at that time on my left side, be-
cause I suffered from polio when I was six 
years old. 
After the first Negro had beat until he was 
exhausted, the State Highway Patrolman or-
dered the second Negro to take the black-
jack. 
The second Negro began to beat and I 
began to work my feet, and the State High-
way Patrolman ordered the first Negro who 
had beat me to sit on my feet—to keep me 
from working my feet. I began to scream and 
one white man got up and began to beat me 
in my head and tell me to hush. 
One white man—my dress had worked up 
high—he walked over and pulled my dress— 
I pulled my dress down and he pulled my 
dress back up. 
I was in jail when Medgar Evers was mur-
dered. 
All of this is on account of we want to reg-
ister, to become first-class citizens. And if 
the Freedom Democratic Party is not seated 
now, I question America. Is this America, 
the land of the free and the home of the 
brave, where we have to sleep with our tele-
phones off the hooks because our lives be 
threatened daily, because we want to live as 
decent human beings, in America? 
Thank you.

RETIREMENT OF PITTSBURG 
STATE PRESIDENT STEVE SCOTT 
HON. JAKE LaTURNER 
OF KANSAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, August 24, 2021 
Mr. LATURNER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize the service of a fellow Kan-
san, and the man who handed me my college 
diploma—Pittsburg State University President 
Steve Scott. Like myself, President Scott is a 
proud child of Cherokee County in Southeast 
Kansas. He first graduated from Pittsburg 
State in 1973, then went on to serve as a fac-
ulty member, department chair, dean, vice 
president of academic affairs, and provost be-
fore assuming the presidency in 2009. 
His leadership has defined our university 
and community for the entirety of his service, 
and his time at the helm of Pittsburg State will 
leave an imprint for years to come. I am per-
sonally 
indebted 
to 
his 
example 
and 
mentorship in my own life, and I know that 
countless other Gorillas would say the same. 
While I am sure President Scott will now be 
able to enjoy some well-deserved rest along 
with his wife Cathy and their grandkids, I am 
equally certain that he will continue teaching 
and serving the citizens of Pittsburg and 
Southeast Kansas in whatever he does next.
