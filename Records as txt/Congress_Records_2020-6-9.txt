PRAYER 
The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, of-
fered the following prayer: 
Let us pray. 
Almighty God, we need You more 
than human help. Restore us to Your 
favor, surrounding us with the shield of 
Your mercy. We have been shaken by 
forces that have come against us and 
look to You, our redeemer and friend. 
Lord, we are grateful that, though 
wrong seems strong, You continue to 
rule. 
Fill our lawmakers with reverence 
and trust in Your prevailing provi-
dence. May that reverential awe keep 
them on the path of courage, integrity, 
and wisdom. Lord, remind them that 
You have invited them to seek and dis-
cover Your might. You declare in 
Psalm 50:15: ‘‘Call on me in the day of 
trouble; I will deliver you.’’ 
We praise Your Holy Name. Amen.

I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the 
United States of America, and to the Repub-
lic for which it stands, one nation under God, 
indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.

OFFICER

IOWA’S PRIMARY ELECTION 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, 
the 
House 
of 
Representatives 
has 
passed a bill that is kind of like a one- 
size-fits-all for elections, meaning that 
everything ought to be run out of 
Washington, DC, which is contrary to 
what we have done in this country for 
240 years, wherein we have had 50 
States running the elections. I want to 
refer to what happens in the State of 
Iowa. 
Last week, Iowans voted in record 
numbers in our June primary. In most 
elections, about 40 percent of Iowans 
choose to vote by absentee ballot. This 
year, in our primary and, understand-
ably, because of the pandemic, the vast 
majority cast its votes by absentee bal-
lot—a State decision, a personal deci-
sion, not something dictated by Wash-
ington. 
As I have already referred to, there 
are those here in Washington, DC—in 
Congress and maybe outside of Con-
gress—who say that, unless the Federal 
Government 
mandates 
that 
States 
adopt a whole new, centralized, non-
optional vote-by-mail system before 
November, Americans will not be able 
to vote from home. 
Iowa’s successful primary election 
shows that the absentee ballot system 
that is already in place in our State— 
and in most States—that is run by our 
county auditors is up to the task. We 
have proven that. Every Iowan who 
wants to vote absentee in November 
can do so, and those who want to vote 
in person can also do so safely. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered.

f 
JUSTICE IN POLICING ACT AND 
HEROES ACT 
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, as 
protests over the death of George 
Floyd continue, House and Senate 
Democrats came together yesterday to 
unveil sweeping reforms to our Na-
tion’s police departments. 
The Justice in Policing Act was not 
only a response to the recent protests 
but a reflection of years of failed ef-
forts to root out injustice and racial 
bias in our law enforcement. The bill 
would ban the use of choke holds and 
other tactics that have left Black 
Americans dead. It would limit the 
transfer of military weaponry and 
equipment to police departments. It 
would change the legal standard to 
make it easier to hold police account-
able for misconduct when they use

deadly force on American citizens, and 
through increased data and trans-
parency, as well as important modi-
fications to training and practices, it 
would help prevent police misconduct 
in the first place. 
This is a very strong bill, and rightly 
so. I give tremendous credit to Sen-
ators BOOKER, HARRIS, and so many 
others who contributed, as well as the 
Black Caucus, led by KAREN BASS and 
Chairman NADLER
of the Judiciary. 
They put together a very strong bill. 
The reason is simple. The moment does 
not call for half measures. 
Hundreds of thousands of American 
protesters are not asking us to chip 
away around the edges. They want bold 
reform and meaningful changes to as-
sist them in something that all too 
often delivers unequal justice for too 
many Black Americans, and that has 
existed that way for too, too long. 
Well, that kind of bold reform and 
meaningful change is what the Justice 
in Policing Act will deliver—meaning-
ful change. Democrats are going to 
fight very, very hard to make this pro-
posal a reality. 
Now, of course, in the Senate, it is 
ultimately up to Leader MCCONNELL to 
decide what proposals, if any, come to 
the Senate floor. That is his preroga-
tive as majority leader. But for 2 
weeks, Leader MCCONNELL has refused 
to respond to my requests for the Sen-
ate to consider a police reform bill be-
fore July 4, the end of the current work 
period. I have heard the Republican 
leader speak to the frustrations that 
have swept the Nation. I trust he is 
aware of the many abuses that have 
been allowed to persist unchecked in 
our police departments. Where is Lead-
er MCCONNELL on actually doing some-
thing about it? 
Of course, there is another crisis at 
the moment, the COVID pandemic. Ac-
cording to reports in the press, Leader 
MCCONNELL
has told the Republican 
caucus not to expect another relief bill 
until late July at the earliest. This is 
happening even as some States begin 
loosening restrictions on business and 
travel. But even as that happens, our 
economy is hampered by severe Depres-
sion-level unemployment. While the 
number of new cases is falling on the 
east coast, the number of cases re-
mains steady in much of the country 
and is increasing in a good number of 
States. 
We are coming to a whole lot of 
cliffs. States are preparing their budg-
ets in advance of the new fiscal year in 
July. If they don’t get help soon, they 
may be forced to make severe cuts to 
public service, and thousands, hundreds 
of thousands, and even millions will be 
laid off—hard-working State and local 
officials whom our communities de-
pend on. 
There are other cliffs as well. The 3- 
month moratorium on eviction expires. 
Unemployment expires July 31. There 
are so many cliffs here, and make no 
mistake about it, COVID is related to 
racial justice as well. In the HEROES 
bill, for instance, hazard workers and 
frontline workers get extra pay—haz-
ard pay. More than 40 percent of them 
are minorities. These are the people on 
our frontlines. Rental assistance for 
people who might be evicted, a large 
percentage of minority folks cannot af-
ford to own a home or rent, so we must 
act on that as well. 
So the kind of racial justice we are 
talking about, the kind of inequality 
that exists—some of it—a good chunk 
of it would be relieved if we passed the 
HEROES Act, COVID 4 bill. Both of 
these are important to do. Racial jus-
tice, civil rights, a global pandemic, 
and economic disaster—these are not 
merely issues of the month but of this 
moment in American history. It is 
truly a time of historic challenge, and 
Leader MCCONNELL and the Republican 
Senate are missing in action. There is 
no commitment to consider police re-
form and no urgency to provide our 
country relief, despite the upcoming 
cliffs that are going to be soon upon us. 
Now there is a full 4 weeks remaining 
before July 4. I say to Leader MCCON-
NELL: commit to a police reform bill on 
the Senate floor. Work with us on an-
other emergency package that can 
come to the floor as well before July 4. 
We have waited too long already. 
For weeks, we Democrats have had to 
relentlessly pressure our Republican 
colleagues to even hold the most rou-
tine oversight hearings. The Repub-
lican majority on the Homeland Secu-
rity Committee, in particular, has 
wasted time these past few weeks try-
ing to smear the family of the Presi-
dent’s political opponent instead. Here 
we have a major crisis—a major crisis 
on the health front, on the economic 
front, on the racial justice front, and 
what are so many of our Republican 
friends doing? Raising back already 
discredited conspiracy theories to go 
after the President’s political opponent 
at a time when Americans are calling 
for unity and coming together and 
doing something about our problems. It 
is a shame. 
The Homeland Security Committee 
will finally, today, conduct a hearing 
with the FEMA Administrator for the 
first time in so long. This crisis has 
been raging for months. More than 8 
weeks ago, we passed a $3 trillion bill. 
Why is it taking so long to have any 
oversight at all? Finally, members of 
the committee will have the oppor-
tunity to press administration officials 
as to why, in the early days of the pan-
demic, the distribution of PPE and 
other critical medical supplies was 
marked by so much confusion, secrecy, 
incompetence, and delays. In fact, Sen-
ators WARREN, BLUMENTHAL, and I for-
mally requested an investigation into 
Project Airbridge, the name of the 
Trump administration’s opaque med-
ical supply chain management project, 
which, by most reports, was a failure. 
Why aren’t we looking into why that 
went wrong, what went wrong, and how 
we can correct it? 
The harsh fact of the matter is this: 
We have lost too many Americans, 
frontline workers, and hospital emer-
gency 
personnel 
to 
this 
horrible 
COVID–19 disease. We will never know 
how many we lost because we weren’t 
better prepared with the necessary pro-
tective equipment. The Trump admin-
istration’s failure should be thoroughly 
investigated so it does not make the 
same mistake again if there is a resur-
gence of the disease. 
Meanwhile, America is still waiting 
for the President to even acknowledge 
the issues of police violence and racial 
justice that are driving protests across 
the 
country, 
including 
across 
the 
street from the White House. 
The 
President 
appears 
too 
pre-
occupied trying to emulate Richard 
Nixon, of all Presidents, and he doesn’t 
offer even a scintilla of leadership. The 
President seems too preoccupied with 
his political precariousness to even try 
to bring the country together. 
As former Defense Secretary Mattis 
wrote, ‘‘Donald Trump is the first 
president in my lifetime who does not 
try to unite the American people—does 
not even pretend to try. Instead, he 
tries to divide us. We are witnessing 
the consequences of three years of this 
deliberate effort. We are witnessing the 
consequences of three years without 
mature leadership. We can unite with-
out him . . . ’’ 
And do that, we must, as Americans. 
Those words were not written by some 
liberal Democrat whom they will call 
names, cast aspersions on, never dis-
cussing the argument. It was written 
by one of our great military leaders, 
former 
Defense 
Secretary 
General 
Mattis. 
Every day provides fresh evidence 
that this country will have to unite in 
spite of the President, not because of 
him. 
I yield the floor. 
f 
RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY 
LEADER 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ma-
jority leader is recognized. 
f 
PROTESTS 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President, 
several times now I have praised the 
peaceful demonstrations protesting ra-
cial injustice and the killings of Black 
Americans. I am grateful that after 
several harrowing days of looting and 
riots, law enforcement restored order 
and helped these peaceful protests be 
heard. 
Notwithstanding the far-left calls to 
disband the police altogether, I believe 
most Americans are ready to consider 
how the memories of Black Americans 
like George Floyd and Breonna Taylor 
can move us to continue combating re-
sidual racism. 
Today, I need to discuss a different 
pressing problem that concerns Ameri-
cans’ constitutional rights. It is be-
coming clear to many Americans, in-
cluding many who appreciate and ap-
plaud the recent protests, that our na-
tional life during this pandemic has 
slid toward a double standard.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2773 
June 9, 2020 
For weeks, State and local leaders 
put normal American life totally on ice 
and asked citizens to prioritize fighting 
the virus. For weeks, the mainstream 
media heaped scorn on any small cit-
izen protest, outdoor gathering, or 
even the suggestion that other impor-
tant values might require a reappraisal 
of certain restrictions. 
Well, the American people did their 
part. They made necessary sacrifices 
that clearly helped the country, and 
they are ready to continue doing their 
part as our reopening carefully pro-
ceeds. But now, many Americans feel 
they have just seen those fastidious 
regulations and that puritanical zeal 
disappear in an instant because a new 
cause has emerged that powerful people 
agree with. 
A month ago, small protest dem-
onstrations were widely condemned as 
reckless and selfish. Now, massive ral-
lies that fill entire cities are not just 
praised but, in fact, are called espe-
cially brave because of the exact same 
health risk that brought condemnation 
when the cause was different. 
People just spent the spring watching 
their small businesses dissolve or can-
celing weddings or missing religious 
observances for the longest spells in 
their lives or missing the last days of a 
loved one’s life and then missing the 
funeral. Never were the American peo-
ple told about any exemption for 
things they felt strongly about. 
I have no criticism for the millions of 
Americans 
who 
peacefully 
dem-
onstrated in recent days. Their cause is 
beyond righteous. It is the inconsist-
ency from leaders that has been baf-
fling. The same Governor of Michigan 
who argued that letting people care-
fully shop for vegetable seeds—vege-
table seeds—would be too dangerous 
during the pandemic, now poses for 
photographs with groups of protesters. 
Here in the District of Columbia, the 
mayor celebrates massive street pro-
tests. She actually joins them herself. 
But on her command, churches and 
houses of worship remain shut. I be-
lieve even the largest church buildings 
in the District are still subject to the 
10-person limit for things the mayor 
deems inessential. 
The rights of free speech, free assem-
bly, and the free exercise of religion 
are all First Amendment rights. They 
have the same constitutional pedigree. 
Apparently, while protests are now per-
missible, prayer is still too dangerous. 
Politicians are now picking and choos-
ing within the First Amendment itself. 
Last week, one county in California’s 
Bay area seriously attempted to issue 
guidance that allowed protests of 100 
people but still—still capped all other 
social gatherings at 12 people and 
banned outdoor religious gatherings al-
together—banned 
outdoor 
religious 
gatherings altogether. Figure that one 
out. 
These governments are acting like 
the coronavirus discriminates based on 
the content of people’s speech, but, 
alas, it is only the leaders themselves 
who are doing that. It is now impos-
sible to avoid the conclusion that local 
and State leaders are using their power 
to 
encourage 
constitutionally 
pro-
tected conduct which they personally 
appreciate while continuing to ban 
constitutionally 
protected 
conduct 
which they personally feel is less im-
portant. 
In New York City, Mayor de Blasio 
makes no effort to hide this subjec-
tivity. At one point, he recounted our 
Nation’s history with racism, com-
pared that to ‘‘a devout religious per-
son who wants to go back to religious 
services’’ and concluded, ‘‘Sorry, that 
is not the same question.’’ 
Well, the American people’s constitu-
tional liberties do not turn—do not 
turn on a mayor’s intuition. Politi-
cians do not get to play red light, green 
light within the First Amendment. The 
Bill of Rights is not some a-la-carte 
menu that leaders may sample as they 
please. It is hard to see any rational 
set of rules by which mass protests 
should continue to be applauded, but 
small, careful religious services should 
continue to be banned. 
These prominent Democrats are free 
to let social protests outrank religion 
in their own consciences if they choose, 
but they do not get to impose their 
ranking on everyone else. This is pre-
cisely the point of freedom of con-
science. That is precisely the point of 
the First Amendment. 
Weeks ago, citizens sued the mayor 
of Louisville, KY, when he tried to ban 
drive-in Easter services while imposing 
no restrictions on the parking lots of 
secular businesses. A brilliant district 
judge had to remind him and the whole 
country that in America, faith can 
never be shoved into second class. It 
seems at least a few local leaders still 
need to learn that lesson. I hope they 
learn it soon. 
The American people’s response to 
the coronavirus was courageous and 
patriotic. 
On the advice of experts, our Nation 
sacrificed a great deal to protect our 
medical system. Politicians must not 
repay that sacrifice with constitu-
tionally dubious double standards. 
f 
GREAT AMERICAN OUTDOORS ACT 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President, 
on an entirely different matter, yester-
day our colleagues voted overwhelm-
ingly to advance the Great American 
Outdoors Act. Thanks to the guiding 
leadership of colleagues like Senators 
DAINES and GARDNER, we have a rare 
opportunity to take a huge step for-
ward with some of our Nation’s most 
cherished treasures. 
Every 
year, 
America’s 
national 
parks, forests, wildlife refuges, battle-
fields, and public lands draw hundreds 
of millions of visits from across the 
country and around the world—hunters 
and anglers, backpackers and climbers, 
bird watchers and road trippers, school 
groups and scientists. Across hundreds 
of millions of acres, there is room for 
recreation and conservation alike. 
Where our Nation makes its natural 
wonders possible, local communities 
thrive. According to the National Park 
Service, park visitors contribute to 
more than $40 billion in economic out-
put in adjacent towns. From local ho-
tels and restaurants to the outdoor 
recreation industry itself, they sup-
ported nearly 330,000 jobs. 
So it would be difficult to overstate 
the importance of our public lands in 
the lives of the American people. When 
the Senate passes legislation to secure 
permanent funding for keeping them 
safe and accessible, we will be ushering 
in a bright future for American recre-
ation and conservation. 
At the same time—and just as impor-
tantly—we will be addressing the areas 
where decades of funding levels for rou-
tine maintenance have not kept pace, 
leaving some of our parks and public 
lands inaccessible and potentially un-
safe. 
This is where the rubber meets the 
road. This is where all of our love for 
the great American outdoors needs to 
be backed up with some sober account-
ing. 
In Senator GARDNER’s backyard, in 
the U.S. Forest Service’s Rocky Moun-
tain region, last year’s totals put the 
costs of backlog maintenance projects 
at nearly half a billion dollars. From 
upkeep of roads, bridges, and dams to 
updates of wastewater and drinking 
water systems, we are talking about 
projects with real consequences for 
recreation, 
conservation, 
and 
local 
economies. 
In Kentucky, we know all too well 
what happens when urgent mainte-
nance is neglected. At Mammoth Cave 
National Park, for example, untreated 
sewer leaks in past years have re-
stricted access to portions of the larg-
est cave system in the world and even 
threatened some of its native species. 
Today, more than $90 million in 
maintenance is still outstanding at 
that particular park. We are still wait-
ing on funding to rehabilitate cave 
trails that haven’t seen major invest-
ment since the 1930s. 
At the Forest Service’s London dis-
trict office, Kentucky rangers are still 
waiting for funding for critical security 
and accessibility updates. 
Like any prized asset, public lands 
need 
regular 
maintenance. 
We 
shouldn’t let key infrastructure lan-
guish for decades and then fight uphill 
to make up for lost time. 
This is a familiar problem that is felt 
in different ways in every corner of our 
Nation, so the solution will need to be 
just as sweeping. Fortunately, as last 
night’s lopsided vote demonstrates, our 
colleagues have assembled a deeply bi-
partisan set of solutions that our coun-
try deserves. 
I am proud the work led by our col-
leagues from Montana and Colorado 
have received the endorsement of hun-
dreds of national and local advocates 
for American recreation and conserva-
tion. I urge all Senators to join the ex-
perts and support the bill.

POLICE DEPARTMENTS 
Mr. THUNE. Madam President, as I 
begin this morning, I would like to just 
briefly comment on the outlandish idea 
of dismantling police departments that 
has seen substantial coverage in recent 
days. While there are exceptions, the 
vast majority of our Nation’s police of-
ficers are men and women of character 
who care deeply about protecting ev-
eryone in their communities, and they 
provide an essential service—a service 
that we cannot do without. 
The idea that any city can exist 
without a police force is so absurd that 
it is difficult to believe anyone is seri-
ously discussing it. We absolutely need 
to look at policies at the State, local, 
and Federal levels to ensure that we 
are holding police officers to the high-
est standards, and I hope we will be 
having serious bipartisan discussions 
on these issues in the coming weeks. 
I know at least one Senate Repub-
lican has already introduced legisla-
tion to require law enforcement agen-
cies to report the use of lethal force. 
But bipartisan discussions will not be 
forwarded by extreme and irresponsible 
proposals like abolishing the police de-
partments that help protect our com-
munities. I hope that such proposals 
will not gain any traction here in the 
U.S. Senate. 
BUSINESS BEFORE THE SENATE 
Madam President, we are very busy— 
hard at work—here in the Senate. Our 
main business on the floor this week 
will be the Great American Outdoors 
Act, legislation crafted by Senators 
DAINES and GARDNER and others, that 
will help address the significant main-
tenance backlog in our national parks, 
among other things. 
Out of the limelight, Senators will 
also be discussing how best to respond 
at the Federal level to the tragedy of 
George Floyd’s killing. 
Responding to the coronavirus con-
tinues to be at the top of our agenda. 
Right now, we are focused on moni-
toring the implementation of the $2.4 
trillion that Congress has provided so 
that we can identify what more we 
need to do to fight this virus. 
Our committees play a leading role 
in this, and they have kept up a steady 
stream of hearings examining imple-
mentation and identifying next steps. 
This week, we have no fewer than 
eight—eight—committee hearings on 
various aspects of the COVID crisis, in-
cluding unemployment insurance, a 
Senate Finance Committee hearing 
later today that I will be participating 
in, reopening schools, and the Federal 
Government’s procurement and dis-
tribution strategies. 
The Democratic leader has spent a 
lot of time on the floor lately, com-
plaining about what is happening in 
the Senate. He is, apparently, not 
happy that we are in session, and he 
claims we are not doing anything on 
the coronavirus. 
Well, on the first point, I would just 
like to say that the majority leader 
brought the Senate back into session 
because we have responsibilities that 
we need to fulfill. One of the issues 
that we have to respond to, as a matter 
of our constitutional obligation, is the 
issue of dealing with nominations, both 
to judicial and executive branches of 
our government. We continue to have 
to do that. 
There are important vacancies that 
we need to fill, some important na-
tional security vacancies, judicial va-
cancies. Last week, we confirmed the 
inspector general for the pandemic, 
somebody who was confirmed by a 75- 
to-15 vote. 
Now, it is possible that we could do 
those and not be here. The Democratic 
leader has said on various occasions he 
doesn’t know why we are here doing 
these types of nominations. Well, the 
reason we are here doing these types of 
nominations is that they insist on it. 
Even in cases where the nominee has 
broad 
bipartisan 
support—in 
some 
cases, overwhelming support—we con-
tinue to have to stay here and go 
through the procedural roadblocks that 
Democrats throw up to getting these 
nominees across the finish line. 
In fact, if you look at the historical 
context of nominations, we are living 
in unprecedented times. The Demo-
crats have filibustered now—totaled— 
314 nominees that President Trump has 
put forward. For all of the previous 
Presidents combined—all of the pre-
vious Presidents combined in our Na-
tion’s history—only on 244 occasions 
did cloture have to be invoked to shut 
down a filibuster on nominees. 
Think about that. In the first 31⁄2 
years of President Trump’s term, we 
now have had 314 nominees—judicial or 
executive—filibustered. In the rest of 
the history of the U.S. Senate, even if 
you go back and say that the advent of 
the filibuster is only in the last half 
century or so. Think about that: 244 
times, throughout all of the Presi-
dencies combined—combined—in our 
history, but this President has seen his 
nominees filibustered 314 times. 
So if the Democratic leader wants to 
know why we are here doing nominees, 
that is why. We have to. It is our job. 
It is our constitutional responsibility. 
If the minority continues to make it as 
difficult as they have and continues to 
filibuster and force the leader to file 
cloture on all these nominees, we have 
to be here to vote. That is our job, and 
that is why we are here. 
Of course, there is also the work, as 
I 
said, 
of 
responding 
to 
the 
coronavirus. There is also work we 
have to do that doesn’t stop just be-
cause there is a pandemic. 
If you look at the Paycheck Protec-
tion Program, when it ran out of 
money, it took way too long to con-
vince Democrats to do something as 
simple as appropriate more funding for 
pandemic-stricken small businesses. 
Funding our government, protecting 
our Nation, making sure these impor-
tant positions in the government, as I 
mentioned, are filled—we just can’t 
skip 
those 
things 
because 
of 
the 
coronavirus, and they have made it in-
creasingly difficult—virtually impos-
sible—for us to do any of this by unani-
mous consent while the Senate was out 
of session. 
As for the Democratic leader’s charge 
that the Senate hasn’t been doing any-
thing on coronavirus, as I pointed out, 
that is just a simply ridiculous charge 
to make. Coronavirus has been at the 
forefront of the Senate activity since 
we returned in May. 
Our committees have held a constant 
stream of hearings examining imple-
mentation of the coronavirus assist-
ance that we have already passed and 
looking forward to what will be needed 
in the future. 
As I mentioned, last week, we con-
firmed the nomination of Brian D. Mil-
ler to be Special Inspector General for 
Pandemic Recovery at the Treasury 
Department, a key position with re-
sponsibility 
for 
ensuring 
the 
coronavirus funding is spent properly. 
We also passed last week legislation 
to update the Paycheck Protection 
Program to give additional flexibility 
to small businesses. Clearly—clearly— 
the 
Senate 
has 
been 
making 
coronavirus a priority. 
I would argue that much of what we 
have already done is having the desired 
result. The jobs numbers that came out 
last week are encouraging. Obviously, 
we have a lot of work to do. We have to 
keep it in perspective. It is no time to 
be spiking the football. But those job 
numbers were encouraging. 
I think one of the reasons we had 
those strong numbers is because we 
have a very resilient economy, No. 1, 
and, No. 2, because of policies we have 
put in place—tax and regulatory poli-
cies that have encouraged businesses to 
invest, consumers to spend.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2775 
June 9, 2020 
The PPP program, the Paycheck Pro-
tection Program, obviously, I think 
has done a lot of good out there. It has 
kept, literally, millions of businesses 
in business. It has kept, literally, tens 
of millions of workers employed, and 
that is exactly what we wanted to see 
happen. 
Those dollars were among the best 
spent dollars, I think, of all the several 
trillion dollars that we put out there. 
My State of South Dakota is a good ex-
ample. We have over 21,000 businesses 
that have benefited from the Paycheck 
Protection Program, to the tune of 
about $1.6 billion. I bet, if you look at 
the numbers in every other State 
around the country, you would see the 
same thing. It is one of the reasons, I 
believe, that we are seeing some en-
couraging economic numbers and em-
ployment numbers. Let’s hope that we 
can continue to build on that. 
I guess that when the Democratic 
leader 
complains 
that 
the 
Senate 
hasn’t 
been 
doing 
anything 
on 
coronavirus, what he actually means to 
say is the Senate hasn’t passed another 
$3 trillion bill. The House of Represent-
atives, the Democrat majority there, in 
a very partisan way with zero Repub-
lican support and, in fact, some Demo-
crats opposing it, passed another $3 
trillion. 
Well, it is true we haven’t done that 
here in the Senate. It is because we 
don’t believe we should be playing fast 
and loose with the American people’s 
money like that. As I pointed out, Con-
gress has already provided $2.4 trillion 
in funding to respond to the virus, 
which 
is 
a 
staggering 
amount 
of 
money, equal to roughly half of the 
2020 Federal budget. 
It was money we needed to spend, 
and we were glad to do it. We will prob-
ably have to spend more before this cri-
sis is over, but we have to make sure 
that we are appropriating what is real-
ly needed and not mindlessly throwing 
around trillions of dollars. The way we 
do that is by monitoring the implemen-
tation of the funding that we have al-
ready put out there, that has already 
been delivered, which is exactly what 
we have been doing. 
I have to say, for a lot of the funding 
that has been authorized, some of it 
hasn’t even been put out there yet. The 
$175 billion that we have authorized to 
help healthcare providers—hospitals, 
nursing homes, those folks on the 
frontline—only about $75 billion of that 
has been made available already. So 
less than 50 percent of those dollars are 
even out there yet. 
It is pretty hard to decide whether 
you are going to throw more money at 
something before you have determined 
whether the money you have already 
spent is having the desired effect and 
whether there is a need for more. So we 
need to see where that money goes be-
fore we decide what else we need to ap-
propriate. 
I have said it before, and I will say it 
again. Every dollar that we have pro-
vided to fight the coronavirus is bor-
rowed money, a significant addition to 
an already massive amount of national 
debt. 
Democrats may like to pretend that 
we can continue to borrow more and 
more money forever, but the truth is 
we cannot. The greater our national 
debt, the greater the threat it rep-
resents to the health of our economy, 
not to mention the future of today’s 
younger workers. 
So while we may need to borrow 
more money to meet our needs before 
the crisis is over, it is crucial that we 
keep that borrowing as low as possible 
and spend only what is absolutely nec-
essary. 
So far, the Democrats’ major pro-
posal 
for 
the 
next 
phase 
of 
our 
coronavirus response is a $3 trillion bill 
produced by the House of Representa-
tives that mentions the word ‘‘can-
nabis’’ more often than it mentions the 
word ‘‘job,’’ which I think tells you all 
you need to know about how seriously 
some are taking this issue. 
If Democrats really wanted to move 
additional relief forward, they would be 
sitting down with Republicans to de-
velop reasonable legislation that actu-
ally has a chance of passing Congress 
and being signed by the President, but 
they are not. Instead, they are pro-
posing outlandish, far-left messaging 
bills and engaging in the kind of par-
tisanship that has become the modus 
operandi during this administration. 
While I am talking about Democrats’ 
unhelpfulness, I just want to mention 
the Democratic leader’s offensive sug-
gestion on the floor last week that the 
judges that we are confirming in the 
Senate will not protect civil rights. 
This is, unfortunately, right in line 
with their general attitude that the 
only legitimate judges are Democrat 
judges, but it is, nevertheless, particu-
larly irresponsible to be fanning the 
flames of division in this country right 
now by suggesting, untruthfully, that 
only Democrats’ preferred judicial can-
didates will show a commitment to up-
holding civil rights. 
The 
continued 
partisanship, 
even 
during a national crisis, has been pret-
ty disheartening. But I am a hopeful 
guy, and I like to think that at least 
some Democrats are more interested in 
actually helping Americans than in 
far-left messaging bills, and I would in-
vite those Democrats to work with us. 
There is a lot more that we need to 
do before this pandemic is over, and 
Republicans are committed to getting 
our country through this crisis and to 
helping Americans thrive on the other 
side. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. CARPER. I ask unanimous con-
sent that the order for the quorum call 
be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
H.R. 1957 
Mr. CARPER. Madam President, the 
bill before us today, the Great Amer-
ican Outdoors Act, is landmark legisla-
tion. It would fulfill a longstanding 
promise to the American people to 
fully fund the Land and Water Con-
servation Fund. 
This measure will also make a down-
payment 
on 
deferred 
maintenance 
plans of our Nation’s beloved public 
lands, which includes over 400 national 
parks. It also includes more than 500 
national wildlife refuges that are under 
the jurisdiction of the Senate Environ-
ment and Public Works Committee on 
which I serve as ranking member. 
While I am proud to support the 
Great American Outdoors Act, we 
would be remiss if we did not put the 
Senate’s consideration of this legisla-
tion in the context of everything else 
that is happening in our country today. 
As we have learned in the 15 days since 
the death of George Floyd, we also 
have other longstanding promises to 
fulfill. Let me mention four of them. 
The first is a promise of an end to ra-
cial violence in this country and a new 
beginning in the pursuit of racial jus-
tice. The second would be the promise 
of equality. The third would be the 
promise of a more perfect Union called 
for in our Constitution’s preamble. The 
fourth, and last, would be the promise 
of a dream articulated nearly 57 years 
ago on the steps of the Lincoln Memo-
rial, not far from where we are gath-
ered here today, by the late Martin Lu-
ther King. 
Our national and State parks have 
always been places that bring people 
from all backgrounds together. Our na-
tional historic sites and monuments 
commemorate the events that have 
forged and tested us as a nation, as 
well as the sacrifices that we have 
made in our quest to become that more 
perfect Union. 
They are also places from which peo-
ple have called on their government, 
our government, for change and for 
equality. Yes, our national parks have 
served as places of protest, protected 
under the Constitution that Delaware 
was the first State to ratify on Decem-
ber 7, 1787. In fact, Delaware’s national 
park, one of the newest in the Nation, 
was created, in large part, to celebrate 
that history. 
The recent murders of George Floyd 
in Minneapolis and Breonna Taylor in 
Louisville have sparked, as we know, 
widespread civil unrest. From coast to 
coast, millions of Americans have 
come together to protest the deaths of 
unarmed Black Americans and to call 
for change, to call for justice, and to 
call for racial equality. In Washington, 
DC, some of those demonstrations have 
taken place in our National Park Sys-
tem. 
Lafayette Square, the site of gassing 
and the troubling use of crowd disper-
sion devices last week in response to a 
peaceful demonstration, has seen its 
share of protests and turmoil. In its 
history, before the marble monuments

it now contains, the square served as a 
slave market, and it housed troops dur-
ing the War of 1812 when the White 
House and the U.S. Capitol—this Cap-
itol—were burned. 
Today, and nearly every day, people 
are gathered in Lafayette Square in 
front of the White House, calling for 
action, as we debate the bill before us. 
But in January and February of 1917, 
women staged 2 months of protests out 
of a row house located on Lafayette 
Square in the pursuit of women’s suf-
frage—the right to vote, one of our 
most sacred privileges. 
Other national park sites in Wash-
ington have been front and center of 
the calls for racial justice in the last 
several days: the National Mall, the 
Lincoln Memorial, and one of our new-
est national historic sites, the memo-
rial to Martin Luther King, who taught 
our country about the power of peace-
ful protests. 
These places inspire us. They allow 
our voices to be heard, but they also 
give us strength; they give us solace; 
and they give us the opportunity to 
heal. The bill before us today helps us 
to ensure that our public lands remain 
places where we can remember, where 
we can reflect, and we can recharge. 
Sometimes when I speak on the Sen-
ate floor, I share anecdotes from my 
morning runs. A number of them over 
the years have been on the National 
Mall as I run from the Capitol to the 
Lincoln Memorial and then past the 
Vietnam Veterans Memorial, etched 
with the names of over 58,000 men and 
women with whom I served in South-
east Asia. No matter how tired I might 
be when I get up in the morning, when 
I begin those runs, as I pass and pause 
at each of these places, I feel inspired, 
I feel rejuvenated, and I feel more de-
termined than ever to take up our 
work in service to the American people 
who sent us here. 
Interestingly, I have heard a similar 
sentiment from the hundreds of Dela-
wareans who have asked me to support 
this legislation before us today. Many 
of our parks provide visitors a place to 
reflect, to reconnect, and to enjoy the 
beauties of nature. That is, in no small 
part, because of the Land and Water 
Conservation Fund. 
Many of our colleagues know that 
Delaware has a proud history as the 
First State—the First State National 
Historical Park, which we worked for a 
decade to create not long ago, tells the 
story of the role Delaware played in 
the establishment of our country. Our 
national park is unique, with historical 
sites in all three of Delaware’s counties 
that connect our communities, much 
like our State parks do. 
What you may not know, though, is 
that the first land acquisition through 
the State side of the Land and Water 
Conservation Program in this country 
occurred 
in 
Delaware. 
Brandywine 
Creek State Park, located just north of 
Wilmington, DE—my hometown—was 
established in 1965. At the time of this 
monumental acquisition, there was not 
much of a State park system in Dela-
ware and certainly not in New Castle 
County, our northernmost county. 
Since that time, the Land and Water 
Conservation Fund has enabled the 
purchase and development of many ad-
ditional State parks that are crown 
jewels in all three counties of the First 
State. I will mention a few of them: 
White Clay Creek, Cape Henlopen, Fox 
Point, Bellevue, Killens Pond, and 
many more. 
For us in Delaware, these spaces are 
places of community. People from all 
walks of life come to these parks for 
many different reasons. Some come to 
fish, others to bike, others to hike, 
play sports, fly kites, swim, go birding, 
learn, enjoy picnics, and enjoy con-
certs. Those are just some of the rea-
sons why people come to our national 
parks—not just from Delaware, not 
just from America but from all over 
the world. 
Some of the parks I have just men-
tioned might exist without the Land 
and Water Conservation Fund, but 
without it, they would not be the com-
munity cornerstones that they are 
today. When a park is revitalized, it 
can become the nerve center of a com-
munity and create new opportunities 
to bring us together. In many cases, we 
have seen just that happen in our 
State. For example, Bellevue State 
Park—located not far from our home— 
has been home to a community garden 
program for decades, providing a place 
for families like my own when our sons 
were young who may not have a lot of 
land on which to grow their own fruits 
and vegetables. 
In 2017, just 3 years ago, the city of 
Wilmington was awarded an LWCF 
grant to improve Father Tucker Park, 
which had been in disrepair for dec-
ades. The park is vital for play, for cul-
tural gatherings, and sports activities. 
It is now a valuable hub of that com-
munity. 
Further, the Land and Water Con-
servation Fund enabled the first public 
pool in Kent County at the Killens 
Pond State Park, 10 miles south of 
Dover. It is now the Killens Pond 
Water Park, and it has grown quite 
popular with residents from across 
Kent County and well beyond Kent 
County’s borders. 
This legislation also helps us to bring 
economic activity to our communities, 
something that people might not think 
of at first blush. In Delaware, the Land 
and Water Conservation Fund has en-
abled an incredible network of green-
ways and trails that connect commu-
nity facilities and institutions with 
businesses. People come from all over 
the country to ride, to run, and to walk 
on them. 
Basic investment in preservation of 
land and investment in paths and trails 
is a tangible community building en-
terprise. People can get on their bicy-
cle in downtown Wilmington, ride 
through the city and out into the sub-
urbs and to the Delaware River in Fox 
Point State Park, just 3 miles from our 
home. I might add, there is another 
one, too, from the train station where 
I caught the train this morning to 
come down here. There is the Jack 
Markell Trail that links the riverfront 
in Wilmington, DE, to New Castle, DE, 
where Ben Franklin first landed and 
brought with him the deeds to Dela-
ware and Pennsylvania. Those paths 
that I just mentioned expand horizons; 
they connect people to each other; and 
they create common ground in our 
communities. 
The Delaware State Parks Youth 
Conservation Corps even provides jobs 
and environmental restoration oppor-
tunities 
throughout 
our 
parks 
for 
young people from all backgrounds. 
What is more, our Delaware State 
parks offer free summer concerts. 
These concert series attract different 
generations 
and 
diverse 
audiences. 
While the 2020 summer concert series 
was, unfortunately, canceled due to the 
ongoing COVID–19 pandemic, Delaware 
State parks have remained open, and, 
get this, our State has waived entrance 
fees. 
As it became clear that physical lo-
cation was key to preventing the 
spread of the novel coronavirus, Dela-
wareans, especially those in urban 
areas, sought solitude in our parks. For 
many, connecting with nature was crit-
ical for mental wellness, and, now, 
making that connection has grown 
more popular than ever. One example 
of that is Brandywine Creek State 
Park. Located just a few miles south of 
our border with Pennsylvania, it has 
seen record visitation this year. 
As I mentioned earlier in my re-
marks, I have heard from hundreds of 
constituents in support of the Great 
American Outdoors Act. Many of them 
have shared stories about their treas-
ured moments in State and national 
parks, particularly during troubled 
times. 
I want to close my remarks today by 
sharing one of those stories from a 
friend, as it turns out, the executive di-
rector of Delaware Wild Lands, and her 
name is Kate Hackett. About a year 
and a half ago, Kate, along with her 
family and another family, traveled to 
a place called Big Bend National Park 
in the State of Texas. This park is on 
the U.S.-Mexican border, as some of 
you know. These two families were dis-
tressed by what was happening along 
our borders and wanted to visit border 
towns to experience their humanity 
themselves. 
As the two families hiked along the 
Rio Grande River, Kate’s friend sang 
her favorite lullaby, not in English but 
in Spanish. Her song echoed in the can-
yon. When she paused, an unknown 
voice from across the border emerged 
with the next verse of the same song. 
These two strangers—divided by the 
depths of a canyon—alternated verses, 
savoring a shared experience, regard-
less of borders, regardless of race, re-
gardless of languages. 
I was moved at the time to hear how 
Kate was able to use her family’s out-
door experience that day. I am still

moved today to hear about how that 
day taught her children a lesson in 
compassion, a lesson in humanity, and 
a lesson in acceptance of us all. 
As the soul of our Nation continues 
to be tested, I hope the legislation be-
fore us—the Great American Outdoors 
Act—might somehow provide similar 
opportunities for others. In fact, I chal-
lenge all of us to make sure that it 
does just that. 
Most importantly, I also sincerely 
hope we will soon fulfill at least two 
other 
longstanding 
promises—for 
equality and justice—that are critical 
for the future of this country and our 
democracy. Our public lands can be 
part of a greater, multifaceted solution 
that brings equity and opportunity to 
all of our committees from sea to shin-
ing sea. 
In the midst of all the turmoil we 
face in America today lies opportunity. 
It is our job to find that opportunity 
and to work together to move this 
country, which we love and revere, as 
imperfect as we are, forward. That is 
our challenge, and that is our oppor-
tunity. 
I don’t know a lot of Latin, but I do 
know two words, maybe a few more. 
My two favorites are these: Carpe 
diem, seize the day. This week we have 
the opportunity on this floor to seize 
the day. Right over your head where 
you are sitting are some other Latin 
words: e pluribus unum—from many, 
one. That is what this country is all 
about. I think this legislation—maybe 
not something we would have thought 
of—can actually help make those words 
not just Latin words carved in stone 
but a reality. 
With that, I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to 
call the roll. 
Mr. GARDNER. Madam President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mrs. 
LOEFFLER). Without objection, it is so 
ordered. 
Mr. GARDNER. Madam President, 
thank you to my colleagues last night 
for an incredibly strong vote, 80 to 17, 
on the motion to proceed to this debate 
on the Great American Outdoors Act. 
We have a lot of work ahead of us this 
week and obviously a lot more debate 
to take place. But one thing is certain, 
we have taken the first step toward a 
historic bill that protects our public 
lands, that enhances the incredible 
work that our national parks do and 
the policies and goals and ideas they 
represent around this great Nation. 
The Great American Outdoors Act 
combines two long-held values of both 
our national parks and the Nation’s 
crown jewel conservation program, the 
Land and Water Conservation Fund. 
The Restore Our Parks Act, of course, 
establishes a fund to set aside dollars 
to catch up with our backlog of 
projects that needs to be done, the de-
ferred maintenance backlog in our na-
tional parks. It sets up about a $1.9 bil-
lion a year fund to work on roads and 
visitor centers and the resources that 
are being loved to death at parks 
across the country. 
It is beyond just parks, of course. It 
also funds our Forest Service, the Bu-
reau 
of 
Land 
Management, 
now 
headquartered in Grand Junction, CO, 
and our Fish and Wildlife Service prop-
erties, as well as the Bureau of Indian 
Education. 
This act will create jobs; it will cre-
ate opportunities; but most impor-
tantly, it will enhance the resources 
that this country loves for generations 
to come. 
The second part, of course, of the 
Great American Outdoors Act is the 
Land and Water Conservation Fund. 
You can see here, the monument, the 
Great Sand Dunes National Park. This 
one right here shows the Land and 
Water Conservation Fund along the 
scenic San Juan Byway. 
This is an incredible opportunity for 
us to preserve the Land and Water Con-
servation Fund, make it permanently 
authorized, as we have done through 
the John D. Dingell Conservation Act, 
but also permanently fund it through 
the Great American Outdoors Act. This 
is a great opportunity for us to fully 
fund the Land and Water Conservation 
Fund. 
That bill that permanently author-
ized the Land and Water Conservation 
Fund passed 92 to 8. Last night, the clo-
ture on the motion to proceed passed 80 
to 17. This is not a red or blue issue. 
This is not a left or right issue. This is 
not a Republican or Democratic issue. 
This is an American people issue, an 
idea the American people instituted in 
this country centuries ago and, in the 
case of our Forest Service, a century 
ago—over a century ago. The opportu-
nities to protect our public lands is sig-
nificant this week, historic this week, 
one 
of 
the 
greatest 
conservation 
achievements that this Congress will 
have had in decades. 
I want to turn to a little bit of the 
work that we have done in Colorado 
with the Land and Water Conservation 
Fund. This is an incredibly important 
opportunity for us because not only 
will it help with our most precious 
places, but it also helps provide access 
to land that we already have, owned by 
the American people, public lands that 
are already held by the American peo-
ple, but we have no way to access 
them. 
In fact, it is estimated that we have 
an area the size of Rocky Mountain Na-
tional Park. Rocky Mountain National 
Park is the third most heavily visited 
park in the country. We have an area 
of land the size of Rocky Mountain Na-
tional Park that is held by the public. 
It is owned by the public, but they 
can’t get to it. They have no access to 
it. 
So the Land and Water Conservation 
Fund is a tool that can be used to pro-
vide access to those lands for hunting, 
for fishing, for hiking, for recreating. 
And if you look at that economy, if 
you look at what it means to our 
State, it is billions and billions of dol-
lars in economic activity. It is hun-
dreds of thousands of jobs in the great 
State of Colorado. Across this Nation, 
it is over 5 million jobs. That is the im-
portance of having new access to places 
to hunt, to fish, to hike, to recreate— 
those opportunities. 
If you go back to the picture of the 
sand dunes here—I talked a little bit 
about it last night—we were able to 
purchase the Baca National Wildlife 
Refuge, which is a key part of the 
Great Sand Dunes National Park. It 
preserved an ecosystem that helps keep 
the sand dunes in place. 
It is important to recognize that this 
isn’t just about protecting the sand 
dunes. This isn’t just about saying ‘‘All 
right, the sand dunes go from point A 
to point B, and we are going to protect 
everything in between’’ because the en-
tire ecosystem in the San Luis Valley 
plays a role in the formation of the 
Great Sand Dunes in this particular 
area, and the way the water is under-
ground creates a charge, basically, that 
gives into the sand the particulates, 
and it is what holds the sand in place. 
Without that water that is underneath 
the sand dunes, the sand dunes simply 
blow away because they don’t have the 
static charge, basically, to keep them 
in place. 
So we are able to use the Land and 
Water Conservation Fund to preserve 
areas around the sand dunes that pre-
serve that precious resource for the 
San Luis Valley that keeps the sand 
from blowing away. As a result, hun-
dreds of thousands of people visit this 
area of Colorado. They spend money at 
hotels; they spend money at res-
taurants; they spend money at the 
sporting goods shops; and it helps grow 
the economy. 
While it has been closed for a while, 
it is back open again. People are start-
ing to get back out and to travel and to 
spend those dollars. 
Colorado has benefited from 38 LWCF 
projects totaling $281.2 million over the 
last 50 years at the Great Sand Dunes, 
the Uncompahgre, over at the Arapaho 
and Roosevelt, the Gunnison, the Rio 
Grande, Canyon of the Ancients Na-
tional Monument, and beyond. 
If you look at the list of LWCF 
projects that have benefited our local 
communities, it is page after page of 
ballfields and parks and water projects 
and recreation opportunities in coun-
ties from corner to corner across our 
great State. 
If you dial in a little bit closer to 
Rocky Mountain National Park—as I 
mentioned, the third busiest park in 
the 
country—Rocky 
Mountain 
Na-
tional Park has about $84 million—a 
little over $84 million—in deferred 
maintenance backlog. This bill will 
help overcome that. 
We need to rehabilitate the Alpine 
Visitor Center developed area. The

Trail Ridge Road, going through Rocky 
Mountain National Park and up to the 
Alpine Visitor Center, where you have 
an amazing, expansive opportunity to 
learn and to recreate. We need to resur-
face Beaver Meadows Road, to improve 
the visitor safety and visitor access at 
several trail heads, to rehabilitate the 
East Water System and Moraine Park 
Campground, to construct an emer-
gency operations center—those are the 
kinds of things that we continue to 
work on at Rocky Mountain National 
Park. 
At Mesa Verde—now, not everybody 
has been to Mesa Verde National Park, 
but think about this: It was established 
in 1906, well over 100 years ago, to pre-
serve and interpret the archeological 
heritage of the ancestral Pueblo peo-
ple, who made it their home for over 
700 years—from 600 to 1,300 current 
events. 
Today, the park protects nearly 5,000 
known archeological sites—5,000 ar-
cheological sites—and 600 cliff dwell-
ings, some of the most notable and best 
preserved 
dwellings 
in 
the 
United 
States. We have to continue our work. 
There is $76 million in backlog at Mesa 
Verde Park alone; Black Canyon of the 
Gunnison, nearly $8 million in backlog; 
Great Sand Dunes National Park, over 
$8 million in backlog. We know we have 
additional Land and Water Conserva-
tion Fund efforts that we could pro-
tect, preserve, and promote with the 
passage of this bill. 
I am just going to—and I know we 
are going to have more conversations 
today—talk about the economic benefit 
of this. In March, as the first waves of 
coronavirus started to pose the eco-
nomic impact that we are dealing with 
today, some of the very first places hit 
in terms of economic impact were the 
Western Slope areas of Colorado—areas 
that had their ski season shut down 
months early, areas that had hotels 
empty and restaurants closed months 
earlier than they otherwise would 
have. 
Of course, now we are into the sum-
mer season, and the summer recreation 
season 
has 
expanded 
dramatically, 
thanks to the bipartisan work the Con-
gress has done over the past several 
years. Now those restaurants see fewer 
numbers and hotels see fewer numbers 
because it is now affecting the summer 
recreation season. 
This bill—the Great American Out-
doors Act—comes at a time to provide 
new jobs to those communities that 
have lost jobs. In fact, it is estimated 
that we will create over 100,000 jobs in 
just the parks part of this legislation 
alone; that for every $1 million we 
spend in Land and Water Conservation 
Fund and outdoor recreation, we are 
going to create between 16 and 30 jobs; 
that it supports the creation of be-
tween 16 and 30 jobs for every $1 mil-
lion spent, at a time when America 
needs it most. 
We have a chance to pass a bill—the 
Great American Outdoors Act—to cre-
ate jobs, to create economic oppor-
tunity, to create the hope we need in 
communities across this country that 
have spent the last 3 months not in the 
great outdoors but in the great in-
doors, and they are ready to get back 
to life. There is no greater life than the 
opportunity to get out and enjoy the 
blessings of God’s labor. 
I want to thank my colleague JOE 
MANCHIN
of West Virginia, my col-
league STEVE DAINES from Montana for 
the great work they have done to get 
this bill to the floor this week. 
Obviously, 
Senator 
PORTMAN
and 
Senator WARNER and Senators ALEX-
ANDER and KING and Senators HEINRICH 
and CANTWELL have played an incred-
ible role. 
We have a lot more votes this week, 
and I hope my colleagues will continue 
to support this opportunity to grow our 
economy, protect the outdoors, and 
make this beautiful part of our country 
last for generations more. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Montana. 
Mr. TESTER. Madam President, I 
rise today in support of the Great 
American Outdoors Act. After yester-
day’s vote, where we voted to move to 
debate this bill at an 80–17 margin, it 
felt good. 
It felt good because some of us have 
been fighting this fight to fully fund 
the Land and Water Conservation 
Fund, in particular, for more than a 
decade. 
It is a program that Senator UDALL 
explained yesterday that has worked 
out so very, very well since his dad in-
troduced it back in the sixties. 
But the Great American Outdoors 
Act does more than just permanently 
fund the Land and Water Conservation 
Fund, which is a huge accomplishment 
in and of itself. It also puts money into 
our Park Service and areas around our 
parks that are so important for this 
country. Really, the park system is one 
of the jewels of this Nation. 
President Teddy Roosevelt was truly 
a visionary. At a time when there were 
plenty of wild places in this great Na-
tion, he had the good sense to preserve 
some of them for future generations be-
cause he knew they would not be 
around forever. 
Quite frankly, the National Park 
System encompasses 419 parks, more 
than 84 million acres, including two 
crown jewels in Montana—Yellowstone 
and Glacier National Park. These are 
places where Americans come together 
and experience the scale of America’s 
natural beauty. 
However, I will tell you, in recent 
years we—the Congress—have not lived 
up to President Roosevelt’s legacy, and 
our parks have been left to fall in dis-
repair. Even as we have seen record 
numbers of visitors each year, the U.S. 
Congress has failed to make parks a 
priority and even make investments in 
them. 
So the Great American Outdoors Act 
will go a long way to correcting 
Congress’s neglect. In fact, it invests 
$9.5 billion in deferred maintenance on 
public lands across our country. Those 
are not only our national parks, but 
the areas around our national parks, 
preserving the legacy of America’s 
great outdoors for generations to come. 
While this is very, very important— 
this investment in our national park 
system, the first part of this legisla-
tion—we also need to know that we 
have places in this country, ecosystems 
in this country that will not be around 
for future generations if we don’t pre-
serve them today, and that is where 
the Land and Water Conservation Fund 
comes in. 
The LWCF is the most important 
conservation tool we have at the Fed-
eral level. Nothing else comes close to 
it. It was founded five decades ago, and 
Montanans have used about $540 mil-
lion of this fund to increase outdoor 
opportunities 
on 
our 
public 
lands 
around our State. 
We have used it to preserve tens of 
thousands of acres of world class elk 
habitat in central Montana. It has been 
an essential driver of Montana’s grow-
ing $7-billion-a-year outdoor recreation 
economy. And it has established city 
parks and open spaces in our more 
urban communities in Montana. 
The best of it all is it doesn’t cost the 
taxpayers a dime because the Land and 
Water Conservation Fund, as it was set 
up, was to take money from offshore 
oil and gas revenue. Well, that hasn’t 
worked out so well, so today we are 
just saying that it is going to be fund-
ed, and it is going to be funded perma-
nently into the future. 
The LWCF is a no-brainer. It has 
overwhelming benefits for States in 
which investments are made for pen-
nies on the dollar. We are receiving 
jobs, and we are receiving quality of 
life. We are receiving the ability to go 
out and hunt and fish and hike on our 
public lands. 
Unlike any other country in the 
world, we have these areas where you 
don’t have to be a millionaire to be 
able to go out and enjoy the outdoors. 
But these victories did not happen 
magically overnight. The fact is, we 
worked long and hard with local con-
servation groups and public land en-
thusiasts around the country to build 
support where it never existed before, 
and our years of work finally broke the 
dam earlier this year when President 
Trump and Senator MCCONNELL
re-
versed their opposition to this legisla-
tion because of overwhelming bipar-
tisan momentum that we had built on 
the ground. I welcome their change of 
heart, and I know it didn’t come easy. 
There are so many Montanans and 
folks around the country I want to 
thank for putting in the work and 
bringing my colleagues from darkness 
to light. Your work has inspired me 
and inspires future generations that 
are going to benefit from your selfless 
efforts. 
I was at home last night, and I got a 
text message from one of those folks 
that said: Thank you. Thank you for

your hard work for the last 13 years on 
LWCF. I sent him back a text that 
said: I don’t deserve the thank you. 
You do because, quite frankly, there 
have been folks that have been working 
on this much longer than I. 
But now, since the vote yesterday, 
the clock is ticking. Every day we are 
losing ecosystems in this country, and 
because of our tardiness in not fully 
funding the Land and Water Conserva-
tion Fund, we have lost plenty of those 
ecosystems over the last 10 years, and 
we will lose even more if we don’t get 
this funding. 
The future of our Nation’s wild 
places hang in the balance, and we 
have something to do about it this 
week. We can fix it. So I would urge my 
colleagues on both sides of the aisle to 
vote yes on the Great American Out-
doors Act so that we can preserve our 
public lands for future generations, for 
our kids and our grandkids, just as 
that visionary President Teddy Roo-
sevelt did for us. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Montana. 
Mr. DAINES. Madam President, this 
month will forever mark a historic mo-
ment for conservation across this Na-
tion when the U.S. Senate votes on one 
of the most important conservation 
bills in decades. 
The Great American Outdoors Act 
isn’t just about tomorrow, next week, 
or even next year. This is a bipartisan 
bill about the future of our children 
and grandchildren, about legacy, about 
their ability to enjoy and access our 
great outdoors and our public lands. 
Standing here today, I can tell you 
there aren’t too many issues, unfortu-
nately, that bring both Republicans 
and 
Democrats 
together, 
but 
pro-
tecting our public lands for future gen-
erations is something that brings us all 
here together. 
Just yesterday, we saw a major bi-
partisan step forward to getting this 
bill across the finish line—an 80-to-17 
vote to move forward with this impor-
tant bill. 
Today, I am joining my Senate col-
leagues on both sides of the aisle to 
share how important it is that we pass 
the Great American Outdoors Act as 
soon as possible. 
Many may ask: Well, how is it, then, 
that we have finally built enough bi-
partisan momentum to get this across 
the finish line? Well, over a year and a 
half ago, my colleagues and I passed a 
historic bipartisan public lands pack-
age that permanently authorized the 
Land and Water Conservation Fund—a 
critical conservation program in Mon-
tana and across the country. 
In fact, as I am standing here, I am 
looking across the Chamber at the 
ranking member of the Energy and 
Natural Resources Committee, Senator 
JOE MANCHIN of West Virginia. This is 
what it is all about in Washington. 
This is what should be happening more 
and more. When Senators who sit on 
opposite sides of the Senate Chamber 
because of the way we sit, with Demo-
crats on one side, Republicans on the 
other—here we are together. We are 
not fighting each other right now. We 
are talking about how we are going to 
come together and pass this. 
This is a great moment for our Na-
tion—a time when we need to come to-
gether—and, once again, it is public 
lands that are pulling us together in-
stead of dividing us. 
Back in February, just a few months 
ago, I sat down in the Roosevelt Room 
with Senator GARDNER, Leader MCCON-
NELL, and President Trump to see what 
it would take to get full, mandatory 
funding of the Land and Water Con-
servation Fund and how we can fix this 
maintenance backlog, which is plagu-
ing our national parks and our public 
lands, across the finish line. 
In fact, I shared several of Montana’s 
Land and Water Conservation Fund 
funded projects and shared how vital 
this funding is for Montana and those 
who visit. Seventy percent of our fish-
ing accesses in Montana are funded by 
LWCF. 
The President listened. I remember 
he sat back in his chair. He commented 
how beautiful the landscapes were that 
he saw in these pictures. He said that 
we need to get this across the finish 
line, and he said that he would sign it 
into law as soon as we did so. 
Protecting and preserving our public 
lands play a direct role in our Montana 
way of life. In fact, this picture is of 
the Yellowstone River. It is not far 
from Chico. I remember as a kid, back 
in the sixties, having church potlucks 
at Chico. 
I remember in 1979 I took the family 
Griswold station wagon, including the 
brown veneer on the side of it—wood 
veneer—with several of my high school 
classmates. That is where we had our 
homecoming dance dinner, at Chico, 
just a few miles from where this pic-
ture was taken. 
I have spent countless days hiking 
the Beartooth Wilderness area, fishing 
the Gallatin and the Yellowstone, 
shown here, enjoying all of Montana’s 
great outdoors in every corner of our 
State with my sweet wife Cindy, our 
four children, and our dogs Ruby and 
Reagan. 
In fact, take a look at some of these 
photos. These are photos I have taken 
on my phone in some of Montana’s pub-
lic lands. That is Ruby, and there is 
Reagan. This was up in the Beartooth 
Wilderness area a few years ago. 
In fact, I have another picture here, 
one of Ruby. We like to take our dogs 
along because this is wild country. 
This is country where there are a lot of 
grizzly bears, and having your dog 
along oftentimes can be a good deter-
rent, along with some bear spray. 
There is Ruby up at what is called 
the Mount Villard Spires. In fact, 
Granite Peak, the highest point in 
Montana, was one of the last summited 
high points in the lower 48 when it was 
climbed. Granite Peak is just around 
the corner. I summited that back dur-
ing my college years. 
I can tell you, when I talk about pub-
lic lands and protecting them and mak-
ing sure we preserve that for genera-
tions to come, this is not some kind of 
theoretical discussion. This something 
that I live and breathe personally. Dur-
ing the August recess, when we get to 
leave this town, when it is hot and 
humid in DC, I get to be up in the wil-
derness areas of Montana—we do that 
every August—where the area is crisp, 
the air is clean. 
That is why, as Montana’s voice in 
the U.S. Senate, I am standing here 
today, fighting to bring this vote to 
the floor and to make the Great Amer-
ican Outdoors Act a reality. 
Many folks may not understand the 
importance of the Land and Water Con-
servation Fund and what it means for 
Montana and States across our coun-
try. Let’s go over a few important 
facts. 
The Land and Water Conservation 
Fund is critical for public access to 
public lands. As an avid outdoorsman, 
a hunter, and a fly fisherman, I under-
stand the importance of our public 
lands. This program helps connect 
trails. It funds over 70 percent of Mon-
tana’s fishing access, and it does much 
more than that. The Land and Water 
Conservation Fund provides certainty 
to land managers, sportsmen, and con-
servation groups. 
The Land and Water Conservation 
money invests in Montana’s outdoor 
economy, and it helps create jobs in 
our rural and gateway communities. 
Let me tell you something. They are 
struggling right now because our na-
tional parks were closed for too long, 
and they need this boost by getting 
this passed. 
Speaking of the outdoor recreation 
economy, Montana contributes over $7 
billion and supports 71,000 jobs in Mon-
tana alone. In fact, 81 percent of Mon-
tanans participate in outdoor recre-
ation every year—81 percent. In fact, 
every $1 million invested in the Land 
and Water Conservation Fund creates 
between 16 and 30 jobs. 
The Land and Water Conservation 
Fund costs the taxpayers nothing. Let 
me say that again. It costs the tax-
payers nothing, and it promotes energy 
development. Now, here is the balance 
we need in our Nation: to continue to 
develop energy independence and glob-
al energy dominance by developing 
American natural resources, and at the 
same time the revenues coming off of 
there are used for the Land and Water 
Conservation Fund. Here is the balance 
between the two: promoting natural re-
source 
development 
and 
promoting 
conservation. This program is pri-
marily funded by oil and gas revenue, 
and it makes conservation inextricably 
linked to a strong energy sector, which 
means the Land and Water Conserva-
tion money is already paid for. 
Through the Forest Legacy side of 
the Land and Water Conservation 
Fund, we will see the promotion of 
working forests to get our mills back 
up and running and help support and

create good-paying timber jobs. It will 
do a much better job of managing our 
national forests because we will thin 
them and reduce the risk of wildfires. 
Perhaps you may have heard other-
wise, but this program actually helps 
promote better land management. 
The Land and Water Conservation 
Fund acts as an important tool for land 
managers and agencies to address 
checkerboard land ownership. I decided 
today to bring pictures of the beautiful 
landscapes in Montana. I could have 
gotten a little more technical and 
showed the checkerboard nature of 
land ownership in a place like Montana 
and why we need LWCF to provide bet-
ter access to our public lands. Because 
we have 1.5 million acres of Federal 
land in Montana that is landlocked, 
Montana directly benefits from the 
Land and Water Conservation Fund 
projects that work to consolidate land 
ownership. You will have a private end 
holding, you will have a State piece, 
and another Federal piece in this 
checkerboard nature, and by consoli-
dating it and working with willing sell-
ers, we can make the overall landscape 
management easier for agencies and 
private landowners and provide better 
access. 
The Land and Water Conservation 
Fund supports locally driven solutions 
from the ground up. These are collabo-
rative projects that have local support. 
The LWCF is authorized at $900 million 
annually. However, we aren’t seeing 
nearly that much appropriated from 
that fund every year. In fact, only 
twice, since it was enacted going back 
to 1964, have we seen funding levels at 
$900 million, and that was the original 
congressional intent. 
Let’s be clear. What we are doing 
here by passing this bill is bringing it 
back to what Congress intended when 
it was first originated back in the 
midsixties. Mandatory funding for the 
Great American Outdoors Act would 
create certainty for land managers 
that the full $900 million goes toward 
this program every year moving for-
ward. It is so important because some 
of these complex checkerboard land 
ownership structures take many years 
to sort out. Now we have certainty. 
If there is someplace with a lot of un-
certainty, it is the U.S. Congress. This 
removes one of those uncertainties 
from Congress going forward. We must 
not forget about the other critical as-
pect of the Great American Outdoors 
Act: addressing the maintenance back-
log facing our national parks, our for-
ests, and our public lands. We are see-
ing record levels of visitation in our 
public lands. 
As I think about our national parks, 
I call them our office of first impres-
sion. I believe they are what set us 
apart from the rest of the world. Peo-
ple come from all over the world to see 
our national parks. They are unique, 
and it is part of the amazing American 
experience. 
With this increased visitation every 
year, our park infrastructure has inevi-
tably experienced a lot of wear and 
tear. We are fraying a lot on the edges. 
While this is a good indicator that 
folks around the world love to enjoy 
our parks in Montana, we must address 
the maintenance backlog to ensure 
that folks continue to come and enjoy 
what we refer to in Montana as the 
‘‘Last Best Place.’’ If you look at some 
of these pictures, I think you might 
agree with me. 
Today, there is nearly $20 billion in 
maintenance backlog on our public 
lands, forests, wildlife refuges, and 
parks, and $12 billion of that is for our 
national parks, including $700 million 
in Glacier and Yellowstone National 
Parks and over $34 million in Mon-
tana’s smaller national parks. 
Addressing this $12 billion backlog 
through the Great American Outdoors 
Act will play a vital role in getting our 
national parks back on track. This will 
create jobs, support our gateway and 
rural communities, and enhance visitor 
experience and safety. 
The restoration of our national parks 
could generate over 100,000 additional 
jobs at a time when our economy needs 
that kind of boost. While this was an 
issue we have been working on for 
years with Members on both sides of 
this infamous aisle, this is needed 
maybe now more than ever. 
Montanans are raised to love and re-
spect the outdoors. Only once in a 
great while does such a historic piece 
of 
conservation 
legislation 
come 
along—perhaps once every 50 years. It 
is essential to protect and maintain ac-
cess to these lands for future genera-
tions. 
It is my highest honor to serve the 
people of Montana in the U.S. Senate. 
I encourage my colleagues to join us in 
supporting this great piece of legisla-
tion, one that has helped bring a di-
vided government together. 
I believe it is a conservative principle 
to conserve, and I will always continue 
fighting for that principle. I know I 
and my colleagues here today are ready 
to get this done. Montanans know what 
it takes to practice conservative prin-
ciples and work to conserve their pub-
lic lands. Now it is time for Congress to 
come together in a bipartisan way and 
support the Great American Outdoors 
Act. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from West Virginia. 
Mr. MANCHIN. Madam President, I 
thank my colleague Senator DAINES 
from Montana and all my colleagues, 
Democrats and Republicans. Everyone 
has been so excited about getting up 
and showing pictures of their beautiful 
State. All of us—it is the United States 
of America—every one of us has some-
thing to be proud of and show off, and 
the LWCF and restore our historic 
parks bills will protect each and every 
one of them. 
I have been in the Senate for almost 
10 years. I have not seen any piece of 
legislation that has brought us to-
gether with more enthusiasm than this 
piece of legislation, the Great Amer-
ican Outdoors Act, because the entire 
Nation benefits from it. Whether it be 
in West Virginia, Colorado, or Mon-
tana, wherever it may be, our outdoor 
resources is something that all of my 
colleagues can enjoy because we all can 
visit and enjoy the great American 
outdoors, if you will. 
The strong support for the Great 
American Outdoors Act is a testament 
of the importance of this legislation 
and what it does. We have never had a 
financial recovery, an economic recov-
ery without infrastructure investments 
in spending. We don’t have a better 
piece of legislation that does this. It is 
a win-win all the way around. 
More than 150,000 jobs will be created 
by this bill. I think every county in 
America—I have 55 counties in West 
Virginia. Every county in West Vir-
ginia, basically, is receiving some sort 
of help from the LWCF. We have all 
been greatly impacted by this. 
Today, I want to talk about the im-
pact that the Land and Water Con-
servation Fund has had on my home 
State of West Virginia. To date, 54 of 
the 55 counties have benefited, as I 
said, from the Land and Water Con-
servation Fund. It is responsible for 
some of our most cherished outdoor 
spaces in West Virginia. In fact, since 
1965, $243 million has been spent to en-
hance recreation and conservation in 
the Mountain State alone. 
The LWCF has supported projects at 
Canaan Valley National Wildlife Ref-
uge, Gauley River National Recreation 
Area, New River Gorge—and this is the 
New River Gorge. This is the New 
River. If you are in the eastern part of 
the United States and you haven’t 
floated on the New River or the 
Gauley, you are missing a great oppor-
tunity. The scenery is unbelievable, 
and floating through the rapids is 
something special. To float through 
there is an experience. I welcome and 
recommend everyone to come visit at 
least once in your life the wild and 
wonderful West Virginia on the New 
River and the Gauley River. The Land 
and Water Conservation Fund has also 
helped towns like Marlinton, WV. 
Mayor Sam Felton was able to turn a 
vacant lot into the Discovery Junction, 
a multipurpose community gathering 
space, with the help of $86,000 from 
LWCF. 
The fund is also important for our 
hunting community. Hunting is a way 
of life. It is part of our culture. It is a 
tradition that we all cherish and value. 
The Great American Outdoors Act will 
increase access to all Federal lands for 
hunting and fishing all across the 
country. A lack of access to Federal 
inholdings is a problem, and I know 
this 
has 
frustrated 
sportsmen 
for 
years. 
As the Congressman from Montana 
has said, over 1.5 million acres is owned 
in his State by the Federal Govern-
ment, but all of it doesn’t have access. 
We are able to provide access now with 
the funding that it will take from this 
legislation.

Another thing that is very important 
that has been mentioned, LWCF does 
not use one iota of taxpayer dollars. 
This is basically coming off of the roy-
alties of our offshore oil and gas reve-
nues. 
I want to mention also that we have 
some of our Senators whom we tried to 
accommodate in this piece of legisla-
tion. There are a few of the Senators 
whom I want to make a public commit-
ment that I will work, as ranking 
member on the Energy and Natural Re-
sources Committee, to do everything I 
can to make sure we understand the 
needs of the coastal States and the res-
toration and protection of our coastal 
States as it is impacted by the chang-
ing environment. My commitment to 
them is I will work diligently with my 
Southern States and also my Northern 
States for all of my coastal States. The 
Senator from Rhode Island has my 
commitment, and the Senator from 
Louisiana has my commitment. We 
will work to make sure they have the 
needed funds it takes to protect their 
coastline and all the work that they 
have done and all the assets that they 
have contributed to our great country 
and the value, as far as in their coastal 
States. We are going to make sure that 
during the committee I will do every-
thing I can to make sure we have the 
proper hearings and proper attention 
for the changes that need to be made. 
We were unable to put that in this 
piece of legislation, but I am com-
mitted to help work through that, and 
I will do that. 
Because Federal lands are surrounded 
by private lands, they can be essen-
tially inaccessible, and we have to 
make sure we have access. Hunting in 
West Virginia is a time-honored tradi-
tion. As I have said, I have been a hun-
ter my entire life, and I look forward 
to opening day in hunting season each 
year for all different types of game. I 
also enjoy fishing immensely. I don’t 
think I have a better day than when I 
am on the river or I am in the river 
walking the streams for the trout that 
we have plentiful amounts of. It is 
something I have handed down to my 
children, my son, and my grandson. 
They all enjoy it. With this bill, we are 
going to be able to pass on this legacy. 
When you think about spending time 
in the U.S. Senate, most of us have 
been in public life for some time in 
other aspects. I have been honored to 
serve in the State legislature as a 
member of the house and member of 
the State senate, and secretary of state 
and Governor of my great State, and 
now representing them in the U.S. Sen-
ate. You want to leave a legacy, so you 
keep thinking what can I do that will 
really make an impact on future gen-
erations. I can’t think that there is 
anything we can do that is going to be 
more impactful than what we are doing 
today, working on this piece of legisla-
tion, the Great American Outdoors 
Act, to be able to enjoy the great na-
tional parks that we have throughout 
this country, to be able to take your 
family and have a family outing, and 
also the history that goes with it and 
who we are. 
If we don’t know where we come 
from, you don’t know where you are 
going, and the history we have in 
America is pretty special. Our national 
parks represent that. Also, to have the 
access to the beautiful outdoors and 
the wonderful nature that we have with 
the LWCF funding, the $900 million a 
year, that is a legacy I am proud of. I 
am proud that my children and my 
grandchildren and future generations 
would say that, hey, part of my family 
was involved in this. We worked this 
hard. We worked together—and to see 
Democrats and Republicans in the 
most troubling time our country has 
faced in many decades come together 
enthusiastically, being able to speak 
and enjoy being with each other and 
talking about how we can get more of 
our colleagues involved and having a 
vote that we had last night, a vote of 80 
votes. 
I see the Senator from Tennessee who 
has worked so hard on our national 
parks and has one of the most beautiful 
national parks in his State that I am 
proud of. I just can’t tell you how 
much I think this piece of legislation 
means to all of us—100 Senators—in 
this most challenging time that we 
have in our country right now. 
West Virginia has approximately $62 
million in deferred maintenance just 
for our little national park areas alone. 
This includes crumbling roads, bridges, 
outdated wastewater plants, electrical 
systems, 
and 
deteriorating 
monu-
ments, which I know we are going to be 
able to start repairing. On average, 1.6 
million visitors enjoy our beautiful na-
tional parks in West Virginia every 
year. From New River Gorge National 
River to Harpers Ferry National His-
torical Park, visitors to our national 
parks generate $73 million from the 
surrounding communities. This act, 
the Great American Outdoors Act, will 
ensure our national parks, forests, and 
other Federal lands are well taken care 
of and remain accessible for everyone 
to enjoy. 
West Virginians take great pride in 
our great outdoor playgrounds. We in-
vite all of you—all of you—to come to 
wild and wonderful West Virginia and 
enjoy everything we have to offer. We 
thank you so much. I thank my staff 
and the staff of the Energy and Natural 
Resources Committee, of which I am 
the ranking member, for working tire-
lessly 
through 
the 
pandemic 
and 
through the virus to make sure we are 
able to have a piece of legislation that 
generations of Americans will be able 
to enjoy. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Tennessee. 
Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, 
while he is on the floor, I congratulate 
the Senator from West Virginia for his 
leadership. Sometimes he says too 
many cooks spoil the pot or whatever 
the phrase is. There could be too many 
cooks but not in this case. Senator 
MANCHIN, because of his senior leader-
ship on the Energy Committee and on 
this bill, has been really a bulwark in 
bringing it to this point. I thank him 
for that. He has been excellent about 
including all sorts of us in the bill. 
We have an unusual assortment of 
U.S. 
Senators, 
outside 
sportsmen 
groups, conservation groups, the Presi-
dent of the United States, and all of 
the former Secretaries of the Depart-
ment of the Interior from Babbitt to 
Zinke, someone said, going alphabeti-
cally—we all support this bill that 
came up last night with 80 different 
votes. 
Among those who deserve a lot of 
credit is another Member of the U.S. 
Senate who is also on the floor right 
now, Mr. WARNER from Virginia. He be-
came interested in this bill as soon as 
anyone. He may have been the first one 
to put his toe in the water. He and Sen-
ator PORTMAN from Ohio, they formed 
a very strong team to bring this bill 
forward. 
Since then, Senators DAINES, GARD-
NER, HEINRICH, and KING all have joined 
in, and then Senators MANCHIN
and 
GARDNER, especially, have added the 
Land and Water Conservation Fund. I 
thank all of them for their leadership. 
I will speak just briefly about what 
we call the Great American Outdoors 
bill, and I think it helps first to say 
what we are talking about. We are 
talking about the Chilhowee camp-
ground on Chilhowee Mountain at the 
edge of the Great Smoky Mountains 
National Park in Tennessee. It was 
closed for 2 or 3 years. Why? Because 
the sewage system didn’t work. So 500 
families who normally would use that 
campground in the summer—go up 
there and have this majestic view of 
the highest mountains in the Eastern 
United States—didn’t have that possi-
bility. 
The Great Smoky Mountains has 
about 12 million visitors a year. That is 
three or four times as many as Yellow-
stone does or any of the western parks 
because it is in the East. It has $224 
million of deferred maintenance like 
that campground. Its annual budget is 
$20 million a year. So you don’t have to 
have gone too far in mathematics in 
the Maryville City School system to 
understand that it will probably take 
15, 20, 25 years, or never to be able to 
get rid of the deferred maintenance in 
the Great Smoky Mountains National 
Park, our most visited national park. 
Now, that is a massive disappoint-
ment to people who consider our na-
tional parks as our greatest treasures, 
to go there and find a campground 
closed, a bathroom that doesn’t work, 
a bridge that is closed, a road with a 
pothole, a trail that is worn out, and 
visitor centers that are dilapidated, as 
they are in some of our centers around 
the country. This is what we are talk-
ing about. 
This is what we are talking about. 
We are talking about deferred mainte-
nance, things that are broken and

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2782 
June 9, 2020 
don’t work and interfere with the abil-
ity of the American people to go out-
doors. Of all the times in our recent 
history when people would like to go 
outdoors, it would be right now, just to 
get out of the house and get away. Of 
all the times when we need some extra 
jobs, it would be right now, when we 
have 14 percent of the people in Ten-
nessee out of work. Some of them could 
go to work on the roads and the bridges 
and the trails and the potholes and the 
sewage systems and the other things 
that need to be fixed, if we had the 
money. 
So that is the first thing this bill is 
about. It is about the deferred mainte-
nance in the national parks—but not 
just in the national parks. With Presi-
dent Trump’s enthusiastic support, we 
have added to the bill, as it has made 
its way through the Senate, other pub-
lic lands; for example, the Fish and 
Wildlife Service lands, the U.S. Forest 
Service lands, the Bureau of Land Man-
agement lands, and the Bureau of In-
dian Education schools. There are lots 
of Indian schools that are rundown and 
need to be fixed. 
All of those are part of this bill, 
which is why, among the 800 organiza-
tions—800 outside groups—who have 
called all of us and asked us to vote 
last night, among the most enthusi-
astic are the fishermen and the sports-
men—the 
Ducks 
Unlimited, 
headquartered in Memphis. They are 
really for this bill because we want to 
use the public lands. We want them 
preserved. Fishermen want access to 
their streams. Tourists want to be able 
to drive to the top of Newfound Gap in 
the Great Smoky Mountains or to see 
the Grand Canyon or to visit Pearl 
Harbor or to walk on the National 
Mall. All of these are part of our de-
ferred maintenance problem. 
So there are two parts to the bill. 
The first is the Land and Water Con-
servation Fund. Now, this is a fund 
that was created in 1964. It was a pret-
ty good idea, I have always thought. 
You take an environmental burden— 
drilling offshore for oil and gas—and 
you create an environmental benefit— 
take some of the money and use it to 
buy treasured lands. 
Senator DAINES of Montana points 
out that 80 percent of the access to 
good fishing in Montana comes with 
funding for the Land and Water Con-
servation Fund. So for 64 years we have 
had some money come through Con-
gress for the Land and Water Conserva-
tion Fund, but—the problem is—not all 
of the money that Congress intended, 
because in 1964 Congress said, Set aside 
a certain amount of money, about $900 
million, for the Land and Water Con-
servation Fund, put it in the Treasury, 
and then spend it for this purpose: half 
to the States for their land acquisition 
and half to the Federal Government. 
But Congress didn’t ever appropriate 
all that money. 
We took that back up in 1985 and 1986 
with President Reagan’s Commission 
on 
Americans 
Outdoors, 
which 
I 
chaired and Gil Grosvenor from the Na-
tional Geographic was the cochairman. 
The No. 1 recommendation for Presi-
dent Reagan’s Commission on Ameri-
cans Outdoors was to permanently fund 
the Land and Water Conservation 
Fund. This bill does that. We perma-
nently authorized it earlier in this 
Congress. This year we will perma-
nently fund it. 
The second part is to restore our 
parks and our public lands. In that 
case, as I just described, whether it is 
the national parks or the fishing or the 
access roads or the bridges or other 
rundown and worn-out trails or build-
ings or sewage systems, at the rate we 
are going, it will take about 15 to 20 
years, maybe longer—maybe never—to 
finish all that deferred maintenance, 
but, with this bill, we should reduce 
that substantially. 
The idea is to take about up to $14 
billion over 5 years and use it to pay 
for deferred maintenance. Now, how do 
we pay for that? Well, we pay for it 
with real money. We pay for it with 
earnings from energy exploration on 
Federal lands. 
Now, this is not a new concept. As I 
mentioned, the Land and Water Con-
servation Fund put that into law in 
1964: environmental burden, environ-
mental benefit. It is also not a new 
concept for all the coastal States in 
our country because we take money—I 
think it is 27 percent of the money we 
get from drilling just off the coastal 
States—and we give it to those States. 
We also take some money from drill-
ing in what we call an area beyond the 
3-mile limit for southern States and 
give them 37 percent of that money. We 
also take some money from drilling, 
say, in Wyoming and give Wyoming 50 
percent of that money—or in Alaska, 90 
percent of that money. 
The difference is, we do all of that be-
fore we give the rest to the Treasury. 
So the idea that we are spending real 
money from energy drilling in a new 
and different way is stretching it a lit-
tle bit because we already spend a lot 
of money that we earn from energy ex-
ploration on Federal lands by giving it 
to States before we give the rest of it 
to the Treasury. The difference here is, 
after we give the rest of it to the 
Treasury, we are going to take half of 
that for 5 years and use it for deferred 
maintenance. Senator PORTMAN, who 
used to be Director of the Office of 
Management and Budget, calls it using 
real money to reduce an unpaid debt. 
Now, it is absolutely true that the 
way the Congressional Budget Office 
looks at that, it is not offset. But there 
is a difference of opinion here. Presi-
dent Trump looks at it in a different 
way. He thinks it is real money for de-
ferred maintenance. The Office of Man-
agement and Budget disagrees with the 
Congressional Budget Office. They ap-
prove this spending. The President’s 
budget includes this spending. 
We are spending, as I said earlier, 
money that we already—the same kind 
of money we spend that we give to 
States before we give it to the Federal 
Government. 
So, if I am walking down Broadway 
in Maryville, TN, where I am from, and 
I am trying to say to them ‘‘Where 
does this come from?’’ we would say 
that we use real money. We use money 
from energy exploration on Federal 
lands. We are going to use it for 5 
years—in the case of everything but 
the Land and Water Conservation Fund 
for 5 years. If we don’t have the money, 
we don’t spend it. If we do have the 
money, we do spend it. 
As a result of that, we are going to be 
able to fix those broken bridges, those 
sewage systems, those dilapidated vis-
itor centers, those roads with potholes, 
those trails that are worn out. Instead 
of maybe never fixing them or doing 
them at a rate of 20 or 25 years, we will 
be able to cut in half that deferred 
maintenance backlog and reduce sub-
stantially the time it takes to make 
these public lands the kinds of lands 
that all of us expect when we go to 
visit. 
So I am delighted to be in full sup-
port of this. I thank Senator WARNER, 
Senator PORTMAN, and all the others 
who have worked so hard on it. I hope 
that the vote we had last night, with 80 
Senators of both parties in support of 
moving ahead with the bill, signals 
that, as we go through the other proce-
dural efforts this week, we will have 
significant bipartisan support, send it 
to the House where an identical bill is 
being introduced, and send it to the 
President. 
President Trump is fully in support 
of it. In fact, without him and his Of-
fice of Management and Budget, we 
wouldn’t have a chance to do it. 
More than 21⁄2 years ago, Secretary 
Zinke, a big fellow from Montana who 
was the Interior Secretary, came down 
to Tennessee and asked me if I would 
get involved in this because it was so 
important. He said that he had talked 
to Mick Mulvaney, who was then in the 
Office of Management and Budget, and 
to the President and they wanted it 
done. 
So I got involved. I found myself in 
pretty good company with Senator 
WARNER and a lot of other folks, and 
here we are today. So I hope we have 
great success with this bill. I know the 
people of Tennessee are looking for-
ward to it. 
I would be remiss if I didn’t point 
out—I pointed out that, with the 
Smokies, our backlog is about $224 mil-
lion, and our annual budget is about $20 
million, so we will never get the back-
log fixed if we don’t pass a bill like this 
or this bill. 
The same applies to other public 
lands in our State. The Cherokee Na-
tional Forest, which is the largest 
piece of public land in Tennessee, will 
get help with their $27 million mainte-
nance backlog to make sure their ac-
cess roads and trails are kept open for 
3 million visitors each year. That is 
about as many visitors as many of our 
most popular western parks have.

June 9, 2020 
The Tennessee National Wildlife Ref-
uge will get help with their $8.4 million 
maintenance backlog to make sure the 
hunters and fishers can safely use the 
boat ramps and the boat docks. 
I yield the floor. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
CRUZ). The Senator from Virginia. 
Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, the 
timing has worked out pretty well. It 
is great to be able to speak on this 
piece of legislation after my friend the 
Senator from Tennessee has just com-
pleted speaking. 
We were hearing some, I think, clas-
sic legislating coming from Senator 
ALEXANDER. He was very generous in 
his compliments to Senator MANCHIN, 
to me, to Senator PORTMAN, to Senator 
DAINES, and to Senator GARDNER, but 
we all know that we wouldn’t be here 
on the cusp of passing the most signifi-
cant piece of environmental outdoor 
lands legislation in a generation or, for 
that matter, in 50 years if it hadn’t 
been for the leadership of Senator 
ALEXANDER from Tennessee. 
So many of us who have had an op-
portunity to work with him and be-
come friends with him over his years in 
the Senate have tried to emulate him 
at times and listen to him all the time. 
He is a Senator I wish we had more of 
in this Senate, who says more often 
than not: Let’s not worry about who 
gets the credit; let’s just see if we can 
get some things done. 
There were two pieces of legislation 
that had to come together. There was 
the challenge of getting the adminis-
tration in, the challenge that we had, 
at one point, too many Democrats and 
maybe not enough Republicans, and it 
was Senator ALEXANDER who kind of 
guided us through this—at least from 
the parks side—3-year journey. 
I just want to publicly acknowledge 
his enormous leadership on this piece 
of legislation, thank him for his friend-
ship, and thank him for the great work 
that he has done garnering, as well, the 
over 800-plus environmental groups 
that have come to support this legisla-
tion. I know that my friend the Sen-
ator from Tennessee is not going to 
stand for reelection, and I know he will 
have many, many legacy items from 
his tenure in the Senate, but I believe 
this Great American Outdoors Act will 
rank in the top three or top five of his 
legislative accomplishments in that 
kind of quiet ‘‘Let’s not worry about 
whose name is first on the bill, but 
let’s just get it done’’ way that is play-
ing out this week, as we saw last night 
with a remarkable, remarkable 84 
votes. 
It may not end up with 84 votes on 
the final passage, but, again, the path 
to get here has been a fascinating one 
and one that I have learned from. So I 
do want to rise to join all of the col-
leagues I have mentioned and others in 
support of the Great American Out-
doors Act. 
I got involved in this issue over 3 
years ago. We, in Virginia, are blessed 
with a lot of great national parks. We 
are blessed with a number of historic 
battlefields and other historic sites. We 
have some of the parkland roads, the 
parkways—in Northern Virginia, the 
George Washington Memorial Parkway 
that I come to work here in the Capitol 
on every day, the Blue Ridge Parkway, 
the Colonial Parkway. We have over 
$1.1 billion of that backlog, and this 
legislation is so critically important. 
The legislation, it has been men-
tioned, represents the most significant 
investment in our public lands in a 
generation, and I believe, at this mo-
ment in time, something critically im-
portant as well: a job creator in our 
outdoor economy. 
The Great American Outdoors Act 
will provide up to $9.5 billion over 5 
years to address not only the deferred 
maintenance and backlogs at the Na-
tional Park Service but other Federal 
land agencies as well. This is the kind 
of mastery of Senator ALEXANDER in 
combining the two pieces of legisla-
tion. 
The bill also finally provides full and 
mandatory funding for the Land and 
Water Conservation Fund. It has been a 
long road getting to this point, but I 
am thrilled that we are finally at this 
moment in time on this important, job- 
creating legislation that is also pre-
serving the legacy that God granted 
this country in terms of the outdoors, 
in terms of our history. This is really a 
gift to our kids, grandkids, and future 
generations. 
Now, many of us have indicated how 
we got here, and I am going to add my 
voice as well. Years of chronic under-
funding has forced the Park Service to 
defer maintenance on countless trails, 
buildings, and historic structures, as 
well as thousands of miles of roads and 
bridges. 
So today, the National Park Service 
faces a deferred maintenance backlog 
of over $12 billion. As a matter of fact, 
over half of all Park Service assets are 
currently in desperate need of repairs. 
As I mentioned, in Virginia alone, 
the deferred maintenance backlog sits 
at over $1.1 billion. That means, in Vir-
ginia, we trail only the District of Co-
lumbia and California in terms of juris-
dictions in total backlog. 
To address this growing problem in 
Virginia and across the country, 3 
years ago Senator ALEXANDER, Senator 
PORTMAN, my good friend Senator 
ANGUS KING, and I introduced the origi-
nal legislation, the Restore Our Parks 
Act, which would provide significant 
funds to the Park Service to reduce its 
maintenance backlog and utilize unob-
ligated energy resources. 
In March, our bill was combined with 
Senator 
GARDNER
and 
Senator 
MANCHIN’s LWCF legislation to form 
the Great American Outdoors Act. This 
bill on the floor today will provide, as 
I indicated, up to $6.65 billion over 5 
years to restore and repair our na-
tional parks. That is enough to address 
more than half of the currently de-
ferred maintenance backlog and com-
pletely fund the highest priority de-
ferred maintenance projects within the 
agency. 
This represents one of the largest—if 
not the largest—investments in infra-
structure in our national parks in the 
over 100-year history of the National 
Park Service. 
In addition to preserving our na-
tional treasures for future generations 
to enjoy, this legislation will also cre-
ate tens of thousands of jobs across the 
country and provide a positive eco-
nomic impact for those gateway com-
munities. 
The Senator from Tennessee men-
tioned Chilhowee in Tennessee. We 
have a Chilhowee in Southwest Vir-
ginia as well. Those gateway commu-
nities depend on our national parks. 
As a matter of fact, a recent study by 
the National Park Service indicates 
that the Great American Outdoors Act 
will actually support over 100,000 jobs 
and contribute $17.5 billion in total 
economic output through this legisla-
tion. In Virginia alone, that means 
over 10,000 jobs could be created by 
eliminating this maintenance backlog. 
Let me give you a few examples that 
are a more parochial basis of what that 
will mean in Virginia. Here in the na-
tional capital region, the George Wash-
ington Memorial Parkway, which is 
managed by the National Park Service, 
has over $700 million in deferred main-
tenance. As a matter of fact, anyone 
who travels on that road knows that, 
north 
of 
the 
Theodore 
Roosevelt 
Bridge, we actually had a sinkhole ap-
pear in the parkway within the last 
year—an enormous safety threat as 
well as a huge inconvenience to the 
traveling public. 
Our legislation would help rebuild 
this critical transportation route be-
tween Virginia, Washington, and Mary-
land—again, reducing traffic and cre-
ating jobs. 
I mentioned that in Virginia we are 
blessed with a number of historic bat-
tlefields. The Richmond National Bat-
tlefield Park has over $5 million in de-
ferred maintenance, and the nearby Pe-
tersburg National Battlefield has near-
ly $9 million in deferred maintenance. 
Our legislation would help preserve 
these important pieces of our heritage 
while also supporting the local econo-
mies. At the Shenandoah National 
Park, one of the crown jewels of the 
National Park Service, the mainte-
nance backlog sits at $90 million. 
Our legislation will put people to 
work on these overdue repairs, includ-
ing Skyline Drive and stretches of the 
Appalachian Trail, which are, again, at 
the heart of Virginia’s outdoor tourism 
industry. 
As you head further southwest in 
Virginia, the Blue Ridge Parkway has 
accumulated over $508 million in de-
ferred maintenance needs. That is over 
$1 million per mile of the parkway. The 
Great American Outdoors Act would 
put Virginians to work on these repairs 
so that visitors can continue to appre-
ciate the beauty of the Appalachian 
Highlands in support, again, of the 
local economy.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2784 
June 9, 2020 
I will just give you one final exam-
ple—the Colonial National Historical 
Park, 
which 
is 
home 
to 
Historic 
Jamestowne and the Yorktown Battle-
field. At this park, containing some of 
our Nation’s most significant sites—be-
ginning our Nation and the birth of our 
Nation in terms of the revolution— 
there are deferred maintenance needs 
totaling over $433 million. 
With this legislation, the wait on 
these repairs is over. We are going to 
create jobs and make sure this impor-
tant part of our history is around for 
years to come. 
In addition to securing these funds 
for the Park Service and other public 
lands, the Great American Outdoors 
Act also provides the full mandatory 
funding for the Land and Water Con-
servation Fund. 
LWCF is the most important tool the 
Federal Government and States have 
to conserve natural areas, water re-
sources, and cultural heritage, and ex-
pand recreation opportunities to all 
communities. 
Over the past four decades, Virginia 
has received over $360 million in LWCF 
funding that has been used to preserve 
critical places in the Commonwealth, 
like the Rappahannock River Valley 
and Back Bay National Wildlife Refuge 
and the Appalachian National Scenic 
Trail. 
With full funding from the LWCF, we 
will be able to conserve additional crit-
ical lands in the Commonwealth and 
provide more recreational opportuni-
ties for Virginians from the coalfields 
to the Chesapeake Bay and everywhere 
in between. 
In closing, I urge my colleagues to 
support this historic legislation that 
will help restore our national parks 
and public lands, create tens of thou-
sands of jobs across the country, and 
expand recreation opportunities for 
millions of Americans. This bipartisan 
piece of legislation, which also has the 
support of the administration, is legis-
lation whose time has arrived. I look 
forward to its successful passage later 
this week. 
With that, I yield the floor. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The bill clerk proceeded to call the 
roll.

Mr. SULLIVAN. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that if my remarks

that they be allowed to extend beyond 
that. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
NOMINATION OF CHARLES Q. BROWN 
Mr. SULLIVAN. Mr. President, this 
is going to be a historic day for the 
U.S. Senate, as we come to the floor 
after the recess, after lunch here, to be 
voting on the confirmation of Gen. 
Charles Q. Brown, Jr., to be the Chief 
of Staff of the U.S. Air Force—Gen. 
C.Q. Brown. I will be voting for General 
Brown because he is the right man, at 
the right time, for this very important 
job. Let me explain why. 
General Brown has an impressive 
academic record and a sterling record 
of service to our great Nation and, of 
course, to the U.S. Air Force. He is a 
distinguished graduate of the Armed 
Force Reserve Officer Training Corps, 
with a bachelor of science degree in 
civil engineering from Texas Tech—the 
Presiding Officer might like that—as 
well as a master’s degree in aero-
nautical science from Embry-Riddle 
Aeronautical University. 
Currently, General Brown is the com-
manding officer—the four-star gen-
eral—in charge of Pacific Air Forces, 
all Pacific Air Forces. Of course, Mr. 
President, you know that is really im-
portant because he is literally on the 
frontlines in implementing the na-
tional defense strategy, which has a 
focus on great power competition, par-
ticularly China, as the pacing threat to 
our Nation for the next 50 to 100 years. 
General Brown is in that battle right 
now, frontlines, every day, in his cur-
rent billing. That is really important. 
Prior to being commander of the Pa-
cific Air Forces, he was the deputy 
commander of U.S. Central Command 
for 2 years. He knows all about the na-
tional security challenges that we have 
from that region of the world, which 
are still very significant—particularly 
violent extremist organizations, like 
al-Qaida and ISIS—that continue to 
threaten the United States. 
From 2015 to 2016, he served as the 
U.S. Air Force’s Central Command 
Combined Force Air Component Com-
mander, where he oversaw the stra-
tegic bombing campaigns against ISIS 
in Iraq and Syria, as well as operations 
against insurgent groups in Afghani-
stan. 
With a record like that—pretty re-
markable—he understands the threats 
we are currently facing. He under-
stands the big challenges we are seeing 
over the horizon with regard to China. 
And he is ready to lead the Air Force 
to take on those threats as a member 
of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. 
The Secretary of the Air Force, Bar-
bara Barrett, said of General Brown: 
He has unmatched strategic vision and 
operational expertise. His leadership will be 
instrumental as the service continues to 
focus on the capabilities and talent we need 
to implement the National Defense Strategy. 
That is the Secretary of the Air 
Force on Gen. C.Q. Brown. 
In my conversations with him, I cer-
tainly believe these qualities, these 
characteristics, the Secretary of the 
Air Force describes to certainly be 
true. I have had many good conversa-
tions with him on strategy, on stra-
tegic basing, including in the Asia-Pa-
cific region, and I am very confident 
that, again, he is the right person for 
the right job at this moment. 
I also want to mention that he will 
be the first African-American to serve 
as a chief in our military’s history. I 
have known General Brown for some 
time, but I was actually surprised when 
I realized this. Colin Powell was Chair-
man of the Joint Chiefs and did an 
amazing job, but we have not had an 
African-American serve as chief in any 
other services in the history of the 
United States. 
I think that is very important right 
now. In many ways, this is a historic 
nomination, particularly, as our coun-
try is roiling over the killing of George 
Floyd and the protests that are taking 
place—peacefully now, which is great— 
to demand justice for him and his fam-
ily, and as we look at some of the chal-
lenges we have in our Nation with re-
gard countering racism across Amer-
ica. 
In a very moving video address last 
week, General Brown recently talked 
about what is on his mind in terms of 
some of these challenges. He talks 
about many of the things that are on 
his mind, many aspects of his career. It 
is very powerful. I would recommend 
that people who care about these issues 
take a look at that very powerful 
speech. He said that he was thinking 
about the conversations his wife of 31 
years, Sharene, and his two sons, Sean 
and Ross, have had on these times re-
cently but, also, the immense responsi-
bility that comes from his historic 
nomination. 
He 
was 
thinking, 
of 
course, about how he could make our 
country better for others from a na-
tional security standpoint and with re-
gard to other issues. 
Think about that. That is a tremen-
dous weight for anyone to carry, but I 
firmly believe that General Brown’s 
shoulders are broad and strong enough 
to carry this weight. 
I am going to be voting enthusiasti-
cally yes with regard to the vote we 
are going to take at 2:15 this afternoon. 
I want to encourage all of my col-
leagues to vote yes, to have a 100-to-0 
vote for this important, impressive 
nomination to be the Chief of Staff of 
the U.S. Air Force. 
I yield the floor.

LEGISLATIVE SESSION 
TAXPAYER FIRST ACT OF 2019— 
MOTION TO PROCEED—Continued 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mrs. 
CAPITO). The Senator from Tennessee. 
RACISM 
Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, 
U.S. Senator TIM SCOTT, who is an Afri-
can-American Republican from South 
Carolina, once told our Bible study 
that police in his hometown had 
stopped him several times for being a 
‘‘Black man in the wrong place’’ even 
though, at the time, he was serving as 
chairman of the Charleston City Coun-
cil. 
During these last few days, I have 
been thinking a lot about what TIM 
SCOTT told us, and I wondered how 
many White Americans know things 
like that happen—White Americans 
like me. I wondered how I would feel if 
I were stopped for being a White man 
in the wrong place in my hometown, 
especially if most of the people in the 
town were Black. Would I feel hurt? 
Scared? Disillusioned? Angry? Weary? 
Disappointed? Intimidated? Probably 
all of those things. 
One result of George Floyd’s killing 
is that Black Americans are telling 
more stories like TIM SCOTT’s. A pro-
fessor of religious studies in Nashville 
wrote in The Tennessean that he car-
ries a licensed firearm with him when 
he goes for a run. A columnist remem-
bers that, as a 6-year-old, a White 
woman outside a Dallas gas station 
restroom said to him: Now, you don’t 
belong here. 
Well-educated 
Black 
businessmen 
count 
the 
times 
they 
have 
been 
profiled because of their race. One of 
my friends in Memphis, who is now 
vice president of Memphis’s largest 
hospital, told me that when he went to 
Memphis State in the 1960s, it was 
clear to him that almost everyone 
thought that he didn’t belong there. 
During my lifetime, I have seen pro-
found changes in racial attitudes. In 
1958, when I enrolled at Vanderbilt Uni-
versity, I had no Black classmates. Af-
rican Americans couldn’t sit at lunch 
counters in Nashville. Blacks driving 
across Tennessee couldn’t stay in most 
motels; they couldn’t eat at most res-
taurants; they couldn’t ride at the 
front of most public buses. 
Then, in 1962, in the spring, the Van-
derbilt University Board of Trustees 
changed its policy and admitted Black 
undergraduate students. 
In August of 1963, I remember stand-
ing in the back of a huge crowd late 
that month. I was an intern in the U.S. 
Department of Justice, and I heard a 
booming voice—which was Dr. Martin 
Luther King’s voice—say: ‘‘I have a 
dream.’’ 
In 1968, I was a Senate aide here, and 
I remember being in the room, which is 
today the Republican leader’s office, 
where Senators were around a big 
table, and Senator Everett Dirksen and 
then-President Lyndon Johnson were 
writing the Civil Rights bill. 
During the 1980s, I saw Tennessee 
adopt a Martin Luther King holiday 
and swear in its first Black supreme 
court justice. In the 1980s, the Univer-
sity of Tennessee hired its first two 
Black vice presidents, and it hired its 
first Black basketball coach who, as a 
teenager in Alcoa, once sat in the ‘‘col-
ored’’ section at UT football games. 
I saw the Voting Rights Act help to 
elect thousands of African-American 
public officials, including President 
Barack Obama and Senator TIM SCOTT. 
Last week, I asked Senator SCOTT if I 
could tell the story that he told us pri-
vately in the Bible study. He said: 
Sure. It happened again just last 
month. 
So despite a half century of profound 
change, an African-American U.S. Sen-
ator is stopped again by police for 
being a Black man in the wrong place 
in his hometown. So what do we do 
now? Bringing those who killed George 
Floyd to justice will help. Dealing 
firmly with looters who hijack peaceful 
protests will help. Some new laws and 
government actions will help, such as 
criminal justice reform and permanent 
funding for historically Black colleges 
that became law in this Congress. It 
would also help to open schools and 
colleges in August and to open them 
safely because a good education is the 
surest ticket to a better future for mi-
nority students, and those students 
will suffer more from schools being 
closed. 
Benjamin Hooks, the former NAACP 
president from Memphis—he was the 
national president of the NAACP; he 
lived in Memphis. He taught students 
this. Dr. Hooks said: America is a work 
in progress. We have come a long way, 
but we have a long way to go. 
That long way to go, I would say, will 
not be as easy as passing laws. It will 
take changing behavior. One way to do 
that could be last week’s peaceful pro-
test organized by Nashville teenagers, 
which was a textbook example of First 
Amendment citizenship, and it hope-
fully will encourage more victims of 
racism to tell their stories and more 
White Americans to adjust our atti-
tudes. 
I am grateful that TIM SCOTT gave 
me permission to tell his story. Per-
haps a good first step to changing atti-
tudes 
toward 
racial 
discrimination 
would be for each of us who is White to 
ask ourselves this question: How would 
I feel if police in my hometown repeat-
edly stopped me for being a White man 
or a White woman in the wrong place, 
especially if most of the other people 
in the town were Black? 
I yield the floor.

OFFICER

BLACKBURN). The Senator from New 
Mexico.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2786 
June 9, 2020 
be to maintaining both our physical 
health and our mental well-being. 
More people are getting outside than 
ever before, whether for a quick walk 
in their local neighborhood park or by 
seeking solitude on the many public 
lands held in trust for each and every 
American citizen. Coming from a State 
that is blessed with expansive skies 
and remote open spaces, I am con-
vinced that investing in the future of 
our parks and our public lands will be 
a key path for our Nation to recover 
from the challenges we currently face. 
That is why I am so proud that we 
are coming together this week to bring 
the Great American Outdoors Act to 
the Senate floor for a vote. Our bipar-
tisan legislation will permanently and 
fully fund the Land and Water Con-
servation Fund and finally dedicate 
real resources to begin tackling the 
multibillion 
dollar 
infrastructure 
backlog in our national parks, our na-
tional forests, and our wildlife refuges. 
If you have spent time enjoying your 
local parks, trail systems, ballfields or 
open space in the last 50 years, you 
have almost certainly experienced the 
impact of the Land and Water Con-
servation Fund. In New Mexico, LWCF 
has been instrumental in protecting 
some of our most treasured public 
lands—places like the Valles Caldera 
National 
Preserve 
with 
its 
trout 
streams, its high altitude meadows, 
and its massive elk herd. I know it is 
hard to tell, but this is actually me not 
catching a trout in the Valles Caldera 
National Preserve, but it is OK because 
any day in the preserve is a good day. 
It also helped us establish the Valle 
de Oro National Wildlife Refuge in Al-
buquerque’s South Valley, a place 
where young people will be introduced 
to nature, many for the first time in a 
really meaningful way, in a place that 
is at the heart of the local community 
now. 
It purchased and protected the en-
tirety—the entirety—of Ute Mountain, 
which is now a centerpiece of the Rio 
Grande del Norte National Monument. 
It almost boggles the mind to think 
about the scale of that, but this entire 
mountain used to be private, and there 
was no public access. Today, it is one 
of the most treasured places in Taos 
County, a rural county that relies on 
recreation and fishing and boating and 
camping to drive its economy. 
The Land and Water Conservation 
Fund is also our most effective tool for 
opening up public access to our public 
lands. Just recently, the Land and 
Water Conservation Fund helped the 
Bureau of Land Management acquire 
land parcels that finally opened up 
public access to the rugged Sabinoso 
Wilderness in Northeastern New Mex-
ico. This is Sabinoso, with its narrow 
mesas and spectacular canyon walls, 
which had previously been completely 
off limits to the public despite being 
part of the national wilderness system. 
It had become entirely surrounded by 
public land, so there wasn’t a legal 
trail or a legal road to be able to enjoy 
this place. Today, that landscape is 
something that the local community 
and visitors from afar share on a daily 
basis. 
LWCF also funds recreation areas in 
neighborhood parks, sports fields, and 
communities all across our State and 
all across the Nation. 
Last year, I was proud to be part of a 
successful bipartisan effort here in the 
Senate 
to permanently reauthorize 
LWCF. However, without guaranteed 
permanent 
funding, 
Congress 
still 
needs to approve LWCF expenditures 
each year, year after year after year. 
This has resulted in us falling far, far 
short of the $900 million per year com-
mitment that was originally intended 
when LWCF was established over five 
decades ago. Permanently and fully 
funding LWCF will be a monumental 
victory for conservation and the places 
where we all get outside. 
It might well be the greatest invest-
ment that we can make that will pay 
off for many generations to come be-
cause every $1 spent on LWCF creates 
an additional $4 in economic value just 
in natural resources, goods, and serv-
ices. That doesn’t account for the long- 
term growth in the outdoor recreation 
sector and the tourism industry. 
Teddy Roosevelt once said: ‘‘Con-
servation means development as much 
as it does protection.’’ I believe that 
this type of investment in conservation 
is exactly what President Roosevelt 
meant. 
Now, to the second leg of our land-
mark Great American Outdoors Act: 
We all know how important it is to re-
build the infrastructure in all of our 
national parks. You can’t enjoy vis-
iting these iconic American places if 
the bathrooms don’t work, if the trails 
and the campgrounds aren’t open, and 
if the roads are in disrepair. These are 
places that we are so proud of, that we 
cherish. From our oldest national 
parks, like Yellowstone and Yosemite, 
to our Nation’s newest national park— 
one I am particularly close to—White 
Sands National Park in New Mexico, 
they all deserve better. 
I am proud that the Great American 
Outdoors Act also includes dedicated 
funding to address similar infrastruc-
ture needs in our national forests, our 
wildlife refuges, and our Bureau of 
Land Management lands. We have also 
included dedicated funding to address 
the unacceptable maintenance backlog 
at schools managed by the Bureau of 
Indian Education. There are many BIE 
schools that serve students across In-
dian country that are in truly dan-
gerous states of disrepair. 
Through this legislation, we are fi-
nally going to make major progress on 
providing these students the kinds of 
safe schools and educational facilities 
that they truly deserve. 
In the wake of our current economic 
crisis, rebuilding all this critical infra-
structure will provide tens of thou-
sands of new jobs across the Nation. It 
is estimated that just investing in fix-
ing the National Park Service’s infra-
structure alone would generate nearly 
110,000 new jobs. These investments 
will also create a lasting heritage that 
will grow the outdoor recreation econ-
omy and provide us all with more op-
portunities to get outside. We know 
this can work. 
The last time we as a nation faced an 
economic downturn on the scale of 
what we are experiencing today, Amer-
icans turned to our public lands. At the 
height of the Great Depression, Frank-
lin Delano Roosevelt understood well 
that out-of-work Americans were not 
without worth but, rather, that they 
could leave an indelible mark on our 
country. 
Now, over the years, I have been 
lucky to have met many of the men 
who served in the New Deal’s Civilian 
Conservation Corps, or ‘‘CCC boys,’’ as 
they often referred to themselves as. 
While most of these men have now 
passed away, sadly, the trails, the vis-
itor centers, and the other important 
infrastructure on our public lands that 
they had so much pride in building al-
most a century ago continue to serve 
this Nation. 
Throughout our long recovery, we 
will be a stronger nation if we can pro-
vide a new generation of Americans 
with meaningful opportunities to serve 
their country and leave their mark. 
There is so much work we need to do to 
rebuild our country. 
In the midst of a real national reck-
oning on race over these recent weeks 
and as we continue to face the most se-
vere economic and public health crises 
in generations, we should all be think-
ing about how we can rebuild our coun-
try in a way that includes all of us. 
I firmly believe that this urgent goal 
is intertwined in our efforts this week 
in the Senate to grow opportunities in 
our great American outdoors. That is 
because our public lands and outdoor 
spaces are fundamental to who we are 
as Americans. They are the places 
where we can each find a real sense of 
belonging in this great country of ours. 
I think we must frankly acknowledge 
the uncomfortable truth that the out-
doors has not always seemed like such 
a welcoming and accessible place for 
all Americans. Many of our national 
parks have a fraught history with the 
Tribal nations whose ancestral lands 
they are on. In New Mexico, many of 
our national forests were established 
on the very same lands that were deed-
ed as land grants to families by the 
Spanish Crown. 
Our public lands agencies have not 
always recognized that history, and 
there remains much more hard work 
ahead to provide meaningful seats at 
the table in the management of these 
landscapes to the communities whose 
heritage and living cultural ties date 
back hundreds and, in some cases, even 
thousands of years on these lands. 
We must also recognize that outdoor 
excursions, which many of us, frankly, 
just take for granted, are not always 
within reach for all of us. I grew up ex-
ploring the outdoors on my family’s

ranch and on surrounding lands, and I 
strongly believe that just one oppor-
tunity to get outside can change a 
child’s whole world. It can inspire a 
lifetime commitment to conservation 
and encourage the health benefits that 
come with an active lifestyle. 
Far too many kids don’t have access 
to parks or open spaces. According to 
the Trust for Public Land, more than 
100 million Americans—and that in-
cludes 28 million children—do not have 
access to a park within a 10-minute 
walk of their home. That number 
should be zero. Especially during the 
pandemic, that number should have 
been zero. 
On top of physical accessibility, 
many children grow up in households 
where their parents cannot afford a va-
cation or they may feel rightly unsafe 
in these spaces, fearing an experience 
much like that of Christian Cooper in 
Central Park recently. We are not solv-
ing all of these challenges with what 
we are voting on here this week, but 
the increased investment in the Great 
American Outdoors Act will create 
more outdoor opportunities that I hope 
will truly benefit all of our Nation’s 
children. 
Our public lands are places we should 
all be able to access regardless of how 
thick or thin our wallets are, where we 
grow up, or the color of our skin. To 
learn about the natural wonders all 
around us, to really learn about our 
history by exploring the stories that 
reside in these places, I don’t know of 
any easy answers to the numerous his-
toric challenges we are facing as a na-
tion today, but I do know that the 
right answers will come only if they 
are based on an honest appraisal of our 
deep-seated history—the good and the 
bad, the inspiring and the painful. 
I believe one of the best ways for 
kids—really all of us—to learn about 
that complex history of our country is 
by visiting our public lands. Let me 
share just one example. When you visit 
El Morro National Monument in West-
ern New Mexico, you walk up to a mas-
sive sandstone rock wall that domi-
nates the high desert landscape around 
it. As you approach the cliff face, you 
begin to clearly see etchings and mark-
ings carved into the stone. These in-
scriptions give physical form to the 
history of many, many generations of 
people who have come to our State or 
called it home. There are petroglyphs 
from indigenous cultures, and right 
next to them—in some cases, even 
carved over them—are signatures of 
Spanish priests and conquistadors dat-
ing back to the late 1500s and early 
1600s. There are records left by Amer-
ican homesteading families traveling 
westward on wagon trains. You can 
find the names of U.S. Army soldiers, 
including the strange but true Army 
Camel Corps that trained nearby in the 
late 1850s. And, yes, you heard that 
right, Camel Corps. The military was 
testing out camels in the New Mexico 
desert long before they started testing 
out fighter jets, rockets, and satellites 
in New Mexico. 
When you see all of these names and 
images left behind on El Morro’s In-
scription Rock, you begin to appreciate 
how varied and also how messy the his-
tory of just this one place in our Na-
tion is. You begin the process of learn-
ing that we have always been a country 
filled with diverse, resilient people but 
also a country riddled with conflicts 
and shortcomings. That is why it is so 
important to protect our parks and to 
protect our public lands. 
These are the places where new gen-
erations of Americans will learn about 
both our natural and our human his-
tory. It is where they will go to find in-
spiration to chart new paths forward 
for our great Nation. For all of these 
reasons, I am so proud that we have 
come together on this legislation. We 
can all understand why investing in re-
storing and expanding opportunities in 
our parks and public lands has to be 
part of our national recovery. These 
are the places where all of us belong. 
These are the places where all of us 
belong. These lands are our lands, and 
they heal us in a way that few things 
can. 
I think of all the generations of 
Americans who have cared for these 
places so my family and I can enjoy 
them and learn from them today. With 
this historic legislation, the Great 
American Outdoors Act, we are going 
to help do our part to, literally, pay it 
forward. 
We often invoke Teddy Roosevelt 
around here when working on con-
servation legislation. That legislation 
rarely measures up to the level of ac-
complishment that you see written in 
the story of his Presidency. 
While I am not superstitious, I have 
to admit that I always visit his bust 
here in the Capitol just outside this 
Chamber before an important conserva-
tion vote. This bill—this bill—is the 
first time in my career that we have 
done something truly on the scale of 
Teddy Roosevelt’s work, and I stand 
here proud to be a part of it. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to 
call the roll. 
Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM 
Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, if 
you were to approach a random person 
on the street in any city in America 
today and say: Who is George Floyd, I 
could all but guarantee you that you 
would be met with a quick response. 
They would tell you about their horror 
at seeing this video of him being killed 
at the hands of a Minneapolis police of-
ficer; that, sadly, he was not the first 
victim of this type of crime; and that 
his death has now mobilized Americans 
of all races, ages, and backgrounds to 
demand action. 
A friend of Mr. Floyd’s for more than 
35 years said: 
Everybody in the world knows who George 
Floyd is today. Presidents, Kings, and 
Queens—they know George Floyd. 
It is true. His name and face are ev-
erywhere. He is the subject of incred-
ible artwork, passionate speeches, and 
dinner table conversations. He is the 
reason for marches and demonstrations 
in the cities from Houston to Min-
neapolis, to London, to Sydney. And 
today, after 2 weeks of grieving, the 
Floyd family will finally lay their be-
loved brother, father, and friend to rest 
in his hometown of Houston, TX. 
Over the past 2 weeks, I have joined 
the chorus of voices calling for justice 
for Mr. Floyd. The first step is under-
way now that the officers have been 
charged, but this alone is not enough. 
Our country has a responsibility to do 
the best we can to prevent another 
family from burying their son or 
daughter as a result of excessive force 
by a police officer. 
People of all races are now actively 
engaged in a national conversation 
about the racial injustices that exist in 
our country—one that is deeply needed 
and long overdue. 
I want to assure the people of Texas 
that these conversations are happening 
in the U.S. Senate as well. Our friend 
and colleague Senator TIM SCOTT, from 
South Carolina, briefed the Republican 
conference today on the package of 
bills he is developing, with help from a 
group of our Members, to combat the 
racial injustice that still exists in our 
country today—particularly, as it ap-
plies to law enforcement. 
This is a product of discussions that 
Leader MCCONNELL and I and others 
have had that would make real and 
lasting changes in communities across 
the country. I am proud to be part of 
the discussion led by Senator SCOTT, 
and I want to commend both him and 
the majority leader for their leadership 
and sense of urgency—one we all feel. 
I think the necessary changes begin 
within our criminal justice system. De-
spite calls from some to defund or even 
disband the police, I believe these steps 
would do far more harm than good. It 
is not the right answer. Instead, we 
need to do a top-to-bottom review of 
our criminal justice system—some-
thing that has not happened in more 
than 50 years. 
Senators PETERS, GRAHAM, and I 
have introduced a bill to create a Na-
tional Criminal Justice Commission 
that would do just that. Over the 
course of 18 months, the Commission 
would examine our criminal justice 
system and provide recommendations 
on specific changes that should be 
made by Congress. 
I have recommended this bill be in-
cluded in the legislation Senator SCOTT 
is developing, and I am eager to work 
with him and all of our colleagues in 
the coming days in the hope of gaining 
broad bipartisan support. As we know, 
the only way things get done around 
here is with bipartisan support. I can’t

think of anything more urgent, at this 
particular time, than we demonstrate 
we can come together and rise above 
our partisan differences and address 
this very real need. 
Of course, there is nothing we can do 
to reverse what happened in Min-
neapolis, but there is a lot that can be 
done to prevent the name of another 
Black person in America from becom-
ing a trending hashtag. A former class-
mate of Mr. Floyd’s at Jack Yates High 
School said he always would say: ‘‘I’m 
going to change the world.’’ While this 
is certainly not the way he or anyone 
could have fathomed, his story is sure 
to have a lasting impact on our coun-
try’s history. 
Today, I would like to offer, once 
again, my condolences to the entire 
Floyd family for their loss. I had the 
privilege of speaking with them on the 
telephone yesterday. Rodney Floyd re-
minded me that the family was from 
Houston, TX, and he said: We want 
Texas-size justice. 
I said: Mr. Floyd, you will have it. 
In the wake of this tragedy, I hope 
we can come together and deliver that 
change. I appreciate Senator SCOTT and 
Leader MCCONNELL leading the charge 
in the Senate and look forward to shar-
ing more details of this proposal soon. 
PAYCHECK PROTECTION PROGRAM 
Madam President, on another mat-
ter, since the CARES Act was signed 
into law more than 2 months ago, mil-
lions of small businesses—I think 4.5 
million businesses—have gotten loans 
from the Paycheck Protection Pro-
gram. This program has allowed res-
taurants, 
retailers, 
manufacturers, 
farmers, and small businesses from vir-
tually every sector of the economy to 
stay afloat and keep their employees 
on payroll. 
Dr. Nora Walker operates a pul-
monary practice in San Antonio—my 
hometown—which experienced a near 
stop on patient visits once COVID–19 
began to soar in March. Payroll is her 
largest expense. Without that source of 
revenue, she and her husband were wor-
ried they wouldn’t be able to pay the 
practice’s three employees, but then 
the lifeline came in the form of the 
PPP loan. They applied for a $26,000 
loan, and they received the funds 2 
weeks later. Because of that funding, 
these three employees could stay on 
the payroll as Dr. Walker continued 
her practice via telemedicine. 
Her practice is a great example of 
PPP beneficiaries who don’t receive 
enough attention—the small employers 
who took out small loans to help with 
a small number of workers in a very 
big way. From the truly small busi-
nesses to those that have grown their 
footprint in our State, the PPP has 
been essential to the survival of these 
businesses and to the livelihood of 
their employees. 
As I have spoken to small businesses 
throughout the State, I have repeat-
edly heard how vital the PPP has been, 
but that praise has been coupled with 
requests to make improvements in the 
program to ensure that it delivers the 
most efficient and maximum benefit. 
Last week, we took the first step in 
making some of those changes through 
the Paycheck Protection Flexibility 
Act, which was signed into law by the 
President on Friday. It extends the 
amount of time businesses can use 
these funds from 8 weeks to 24 weeks 
and reduces the portion of the loan 
that must be used on payroll in order 
to be forgiven from 75 percent to 60 per-
cent. Many of our restaurants and 
other businesses that simply closed 
their doors said there is no way they 
can spend our PPP loan on payroll 
when our business isn’t even open. This 
provides flexibility for them and for 
others. In a nutshell, it gives small 
business owners the ability to use 
these loans when and where they are 
needed. 
In the short term, these changes will 
be critical to protecting jobs and sup-
porting small businesses as they reopen 
their doors following the coronavirus- 
induced shutdown. The jobs report we 
got this last week provides great hope 
and promise that this recovery will 
come soon. 
In the longer term, we need to ensure 
that these loans don’t end up creating 
any more burdens for small businesses 
down the road. Under normal cir-
cumstances, 
businesses 
can 
deduct 
their expenses from their taxable in-
come. Of course, the Paycheck Protec-
tion Program covers the cost to many 
of these expenses, and there is some 
confusion—particularly, at Treasury— 
with how businesses should handle 
their taxes. 
I believe the intent of Congress was 
to allow businesses to continue deduct-
ing those expenses. Basically, we were 
trying to get the money where it was 
needed most the fastest. By allowing 
them to continue to deduct those ex-
penses, we do that, but the guidance re-
cently issued by the IRS said the oppo-
site. 
While it is fair to say this has led to 
confusion and frustration among many, 
Congress needs to take action to elimi-
nate 
the 
misunderstanding. 
Last 
month, I introduced a bill to make 
clear that small businesses can still de-
duct their expenses that were paid for 
with a forgiven Paycheck Protection 
loan for their taxes. I know this is an 
unusual circumstance, but isn’t the 
pandemic 
the 
most 
unusual 
cir-
cumstance we experienced in our life-
time? It calls for extraordinary meas-
ures, and I believe, under the cir-
cumstances, trying to get money to 
these small businesses is necessary. 
Our goal with this loan program was 
to help them remain solvent and keep 
their employees on payroll so they can 
recover as soon as possible. Without 
this change, the PPP loan will fail to 
deliver the maximum on this most 
basic objective. 
The bipartisan Small Business’s Ex-
pense Protection Act will ensure that 
small businesses have the cashflow 
they need to survive today and prosper 
in the future. After all, we are not in-
terested in handing out meals now only 
to slap people on the hands later for 
taking free food. 
The bill has bipartisan support in the 
Senate. In fact, I introduced it with the 
chairman and ranking member of the 
Finance Committee, Senators GRASS-
LEY and WYDEN, as well as Senator 
RUBIO, who chairs the Small Business 
Committee, and Senator CARPER. It has 
gained the support of organizations 
that advocate for small businesses, in-
cluding the U.S. Chamber of Com-
merce, the National Association of 
Manufacturers of Manufacturers, and 
the National Federation of Independent 
Businesses. It also has been endorsed 
by groups in the financial services in-
dustry, including the Texas Society of 
Certified 
Public 
Accountants, 
the 
American Institute of CPAs, and the 
Independent Bankers of Texas. Most 
importantly, this bill is an answer to 
the real concerns that businessowners 
are facing. 
As 
we 
work 
to 
strengthen 
our 
coronavirus 
response 
and 
recovery, 
that should be the guiding principle in 
the Senate—figure out what is work-
ing, what isn’t, and act appropriately. 
This is a big contrast between the ap-
proach we are seeing from our House 
colleagues. A few weeks ago, they 
passed a bill that was chock-full of ide-
ological policy proposals they know 
has absolutely no chance of gaining 
any traction in the Senate, but they 
didn’t seem to care. They did a driveby 
vote on a Friday and left town and 
haven’t been back since. 
Tax breaks for blue State million-
aires—they actually want to cut taxes 
on the richest people in America by re-
ducing or raising the cap on the State 
and local tax deduction. They want to 
support marijuana banking, environ-
mental justice grants, soil health stud-
ies, changes to election laws. 
Forget about solving the problem at 
hand. Our Democratic colleagues in the 
House, with this so-called Heroes Act, 
are attempting to use this pandemic as 
an opportunity to slip their liberal 
wish list into must-pass legislation. 
They are eager to stick taxpayers with 
another $3 trillion tab. This isn’t going 
to happen. It has no chance of passing 
in the Senate, and they actually know 
it. 
These unwanted, unaffordable, and, 
frankly, laughable proposals are not 
the types of solutions America needs to 
recover from this crisis. Indeed, I think 
it would be wise for a number of folks 
in the House Democratic leadership to 
start listening to their constituents for 
a change rather than try to figure out 
how do you posture and position your-
self favorably for the next election. 
I have lost count of the number of 
video calls I have held—and I know my 
colleagues have had the same experi-
ence—with small business owners, med-
ical professionals, farmers, educators, 
mayors, and representatives from near-
ly every corner of my State. I appre-
ciate the countless Texans who have

shared their feedback with me to help 
me do a better job on their behalf and 
who will no doubt continue to point 
out the gaps that need to be filled in 
the months ahead, particularly when it 
comes to the next installment of 
COVID–19 legislation. 
I yield the floor. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
BOOZMAN). The Senator from Florida. 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST—S. 3837 
Mr. SCOTT of Florida. Mr. President, 
I rise to speak today about the growing 
threat of Communist China. 
Xi, the General Secretary of the Chi-
nese Communist Party, is a dictator 
and human rights violator who is deny-
ing basic rights to the people of Hong 
Kong, cracking down on dissidents, 
militarizing the South China Sea, and 
imprisoning 
more 
than 
1 
million 
Uighurs in internment camps simply 
because of their religion. 
General Secretary Xi is interested in 
one thing—global domination. It is 
time we all open our eyes. Communist 
China despises the freedoms Americans 
cherish. 
The threat we face from Communist 
China is the new Cold War. This is a 
Cold War created by General Secretary 
Xi. It is a Cold War fought with tech-
nology, misinformation, and political 
persuasion. And Communist China’s 
latest 
weapon 
of 
choice 
is 
the 
coronavirus. 
Communist China lied about what 
they knew and spread misinformation 
around the world, costing hundreds of 
thousands of lives, millions of jobs, and 
creating massive economic impact. 
All freedom-loving nations around 
the world need to come together to 
hold Communist China accountable 
and financially liable. 
One thing we can do today is make 
sure Communist China can’t steal or 
sabotage American COVID–19 vaccine 
research. We know Communist China 
steals U.S. research and intellectual 
property. We have seen this at our uni-
versities; we have seen it at our re-
search institutions and hospitals. 
U.S. officials have been warning 
American firms to safeguard their re-
search against China and others known 
for stealing U.S. technology. The FBI 
and the Cybersecurity and Infrastruc-
ture Security Agency recently warned 
organizations researching COVID–19 of 
likely insider threats, targeting, and 
network compromise by Communist 
China. 
Communist China wants to be first in 
vaccine development, and unlike the 
United States and other freedom-loving 
countries, Communist China will not 
be quick to share. 
Communist China wants to be the 
dominant world power, and they have 
made clear they don’t care who is 
harmed in the process. That is why I 
led my colleagues in introducing the 
COVID–19 
Vaccine 
Protection 
Act, 
which will require a thorough national 
security evaluation and clearance by 
the Department of Homeland Security, 
the Department of State, and the Fed-
eral Bureau of Investigation of all Chi-
nese student visa holders taking part 
in activities related to COVID–19 vac-
cine research. 
We need to know who in our country 
is working on vaccine research so that 
we can make sure American efforts are 
protected. The United States and all 
Americans need to get serious about 
the threat from Communist China. 
The COVID–19 Vaccine Protection 
Act is a great first step, and I look for-
ward to all of my colleagues supporting 
this effort. 
I am also urging everyone to buy 
American products. It is the single 
most important thing we can do to 
send a message to Communist China 
that their behavior is unacceptable. 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-
sent that the Judiciary Committee be 
discharged from further consideration 
of S. 3837 and the Senate proceed to its 
immediate consideration. I ask unani-
mous consent that the bill be consid-
ered read a third time and passed and 
that the motion to reconsider be con-
sidered made and laid upon the table. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER is there 
objection? 
Ms. DUCKWORTH. Reserving the 
right to object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Illinois. 
Ms. DUCKWORTH. Mr. President, 
none of us in this body is naive enough 
not to understand the challenges the 
People’s Republic of China represents 
to our country and to the world. But 
this bill, which threatens to further in-
cite the tensions already tearing at the 
fabric of our Nation—this time tar-
geting Asians and Asian Americans—is 
not the answer. 
Yes, we know about how the PRC has 
targeted our intellectual property and 
sought to benefit from the research ex-
cellence and technological insights de-
veloped by our universities and our 
companies—all for its own scientific 
and military advancement, all to sup-
port an authoritarian system that is 
dangerous both to living within and 
outside its borders. 
But taking advantage of this moment 
of fear and division in our country to 
stoke xenophobia and paint an entire 
people as guilty by association is not 
the right way to address this challenge. 
It is not the American way. 
If we have specific counterintel-
ligence threats, let’s have our intel-
ligence and law enforcement commu-
nities target the threats. I have faith 
and confidence in their ability to do so 
if provided the right leadership. 
Rather than take that sort of dis-
criminate approach, this bill just dis-
criminates. Even setting aside that 
blanket moratoriums are the wrong 
way to deal with the situation at hand, 
the AAPI community is right to be sus-
picious that Senate Republicans aren’t 
putting forth any bills today barring 
visas for nationals from our other ad-
versaries, such as Russia. They are 
doing it only when it comes to China. 
If we need to work more closely with 
our universities to make sure they un-
derstand who they are engaged with— 
as students, in accepting donations— 
then we can do so without attacking an 
entire group because of their ethnicity 
or national background but with little 
other basis or rationale. 
We can do better. We as a nation 
must do better. We cannot and should 
not go back to the days when there 
were signs that said ‘‘No Irish Need 
Apply’’ or when we had quotas for dif-
ferent races and religions at our major 
universities, let alone the days of the 
Chinese Exclusion Act. That is not the 
right direction for America, and it is 
not the America any of us should be 
seeking to build. 
Unfortunately, there are too many 
today who would rather see us frac-
tionalized as a nation—who would 
rather see us divided, not united. In 
fact, few things would make the PRC 
happier than to see this sort of legisla-
tion go forward because it achieves 
their end. 
So let’s take a serious approach to 
the challenges that we face with the 
PRC, with safeguarding our univer-
sities, our intellectual property, and 
our scientific research. But let us also 
take an approach that is consistent 
with our values as a nation. We can do 
both. We can and will do better. 
I object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard. 
Mr. SCOTT of Florida. Mr. President, 
I appreciate my colleague’s remarks. 
Florida and the United States are 
amazing melting pots, and our States 
and country have both benefited great-
ly from the contributions of people 
from all over the world. 
This bill isn’t about race. This is a 
commonsense bill to protect American 
citizens from the Government of Com-
munist China, which has decided to be-
come our adversary. 
This is about protecting Americans 
from a regime that is actively trying 
to sabotage our efforts to create a vac-
cine. We have evidence from our intel-
ligence community that China is try-
ing to do this. 
My bill would help identify who in 
our country is trying to steal or, more 
importantly, delay, sabotage our suc-
cess of a vaccine, and that is Com-
munist China’s goal. 
My colleague has even introduced her 
own resolution recognizing the impor-
tance of vaccinations and immuniza-
tions in the United States, and we all 
agree with her, so blocking my pro-
posal today makes absolutely no sense. 
Why would my colleague not want to 
save American lives and make sure we 
have a vaccine done as quickly as pos-
sible? American lives are on the line 
and depend on this vaccine. 
I am clearly disappointed my col-
league objected to passing this bill 
today, but I am completely committed 
to working with her to get it across the 
finish line. 
As long as our vaccine research re-
mains vulnerable, Communist China 
will not hesitate to use any tool nec-
essary to obtain this sensitive informa-
tion.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2790 
June 9, 2020 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Maine. 
H.R. 1957 
Mr. KING. Mr. President, someday, 
100 years from now, a family will camp 
on a mesa in Utah or a hillside in 
North Carolina or a canyon in New 
Mexico or they will hike the rocky 
coast of Maine. They will play on a 
ballfield in Kansas, and it will be be-
cause of the work that we are going to 
do this week in this Congress. 
They will not know KING or DAINES 
or ALEXANDER or PORTMAN or WARNER 
or MANCHIN or GARDNER or all the oth-
ers who are going to support our ef-
forts. Our names will be long forgotten, 
but what we do will be benefiting this 
country for generations. 
There are very few things we can do 
in our work here that are permanent. 
Bills can be repealed. Programs can be 
amended. Times change, and all can 
change with it. 
What we are talking about this week 
in the Great American Outdoors Act is 
making a gift to our fellow Americans. 
Setting aside special places, setting 
aside opportunities for outdoors and 
recreation is a sacred trust, and it is 
one that goes back to the beginning of 
this country. 
As I said, there is very little we can 
do that is permanent, but this is one of 
those things. It is the right thing to do, 
but it also makes sense from the econo-
my’s point of view in all of our States. 
Acadia National Park in Maine gen-
erates more than $300 million a year in 
economic activity in the surrounding 
communities. Our new Katahdin Woods 
and Waters National Monument is al-
ready generating economic activity in 
the area where it is located. A visit to 
Maine to see the seacoast and the for-
est at those two sites would be reward-
ing for any family. 
What we are doing today will enable 
families to continue to make these 
kinds of journeys—the next generation 
and the next and the next. That family 
will see a sunrise on the coast of 
Maine, a sunset on a mesa in Arizona. 
They will not know who it was, but 
they will know what we did. 
In Maine there is a wonderful moun-
tain, Mount Katahdin, the highest 
point in the State, and it was proposed 
to be set aside for the people of Maine 
by the Governor named Percival Bax-
ter in the twenties, one of my prede-
cessors. 
The legislature of Maine said: No, we 
don’t have to do that. We shouldn’t 
really do that. Who is going to pay for 
the roads? We are going to take prop-
erty out of the tax base. What about 
the trees? 
There were all kinds of reasons for 
not doing it, so it didn’t happen. 
It didn’t happen while Percival Bax-
ter was Governor, but he dedicated the 
rest of his life to making it happen. In-
dividually, privately, he purchased full 
parcels of land to assemble what is now 
Baxter State Park, one of the gems in 
this country that contains, at its cen-
ter, Mount Katahdin. He did this as one 
of the greatest acts of private philan-
thropy in the history of the United 
States. It was the legacy of a lifetime. 
Few of us will have an opportunity to 
do what Baxter did, but we have that 
opportunity 
now. 
Where 
does 
the 
money come from? It comes from the 
people, in the sense of revenues from 
the use of Federal lands for mineral ex-
traction. This is an idea that was 
brought forth in 1965 when the Land 
and Water Conservation Fund was cre-
ated, and the idea was this: We are 
using the public’s resources and assets, 
and, therefore, the money that flows 
from that should go back to the people 
and should go back into conservation. 
It is a beautifully symmetrical idea. 
The problem is that the fund that 
was created in 1965 has been systemati-
cally looted by the Congresses in suc-
cessive years. There have been only 2 
years since then that it has been fully 
funded with the funds that are avail-
able. 
Today, this week, we are going to 
correct that historic error and make a 
commitment not only to the people of 
the United States today but to people 
we don’t even know—the children and 
grandchildren and great-grandchildren 
of today’s citizens. 
The other thing this bill will do is 
begin to fund the backlog of mainte-
nance at our national parks, bureau of 
public lands, and other public lands 
across the country. This sounds pretty 
boring, pretty mundane, and some of 
my friends are going to say: Well, you 
can’t do this. We are going to raise a 
budget point of order. 
This is money, again, coming from 
excess funds in the generation of min-
erals, oil, and gas. But they are going 
to say: No, no. You can’t do that. 
What we are doing here is paying a 
debt. Deferred maintenance is a debt. 
When I was Governor, I used to go to 
New York to kiss the ring of the rating 
agencies and hope and beg that they 
would give us a high bond rating so 
that our interest costs for our State 
debt would be low. At one point, I was 
making a presentation about how pru-
dent Maine was. We didn’t have much 
debt. We paid it off in 10 years, and we 
really needed this high bond rating. 
One of the analysts stopped me, and 
he said: Governor, don’t forget that if 
you are not maintaining your infra-
structure, that is debt just as sure as if 
you borrow money from the bank, and 
it is debt that is going to have to be 
paid, and it is going to have to be paid 
in the future, which means it is going 
to cost more. 
I had never thought of it that way, 
but that is what we are doing here. 
That is why what we are doing here is 
eminently fiscally responsible because 
we are paying off a debt, and we are 
preserving these wonderful, incredible 
places for people to visit and enjoy. 
Believe me, after this spring, people 
really want to get outdoors. In Maine, 
for example, Acadia National Park has 
more than 31⁄2 million visitors a year. 
That is a big number. It is a really big 
number when you realize that more 
than twice the population of our whole 
State comes to visit this one small, 
beautiful, incredible spot on the coast 
of Maine on Mount Desert Island. So 
what we are talking about today is 
paying a debt and making a contribu-
tion to the well-being of the American 
people for generations to come. 
When Baxter completed the acquisi-
tion of Katahdin and the area that is 
now Baxter State Park, he had an 
amazing quote that I think applies to 
what we are talking about today. He 
said: 
Man is born to die. His works are short- 
lived. Buildings crumble, monuments decay, 
and wealth vanishes, but Katahdin in all its 
glory forever shall remain the mountain of 
the people of Maine. 
Areas across our country in all their 
glory will forever be part of the legacy 
for the people of America. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
POLICE DEPARTMENTS 
Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I 
come to the floor today at a time that 
you and I have heard the Democrats’ 
latest rallying cry. Astonishingly, the 
rallying cry is: Defund the police. 
Defund the police. That is what I am 
hearing from Democrats all across 
America. This comes on the heels of a 
previous battle cry: Abolish ICE. That 
is what the Democrats are calling for 
today. 
Leading Democrats—radical leftwing 
lawmakers like ALEXANDRIA
OCASIO- 
CORTEZ—are pushing these very dan-
gerous ideas. Let me say it again. Lib-
eral Democrats all across the country 
are asking all of us to defund law en-
forcement in America. If we did that— 
if we did that—crime would go through 
the roof, school safety would cease to 
exist, and the most vulnerable in our 
society would have no one to turn to or 
call in case of an emergency. Yet 
Democratic mayors across the country 
seem to be on board. 
Last week, the Democratic mayor of 
Los Angeles said that he plans to slash 
the LA Police Department’s budget. 
New York City Mayor de Blasio has 
vowed to cut funding for the New York 
Police Department. The Minneapolis 
City Council announced Sunday that it 
would vote to disband—disband—the 
city’s police department and said they 
had a veto-proof majority. 
House Democrats have now just re-
leased a new bill that supposedly seeks 
police reform. This is from a party that 
just last month pushed a trillion dol-
lar—the total bill was $3 trillion for 
the Heroes fund to support the police. 
Well, now funding for police has pur-
posely been left out of the bill.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2791 
June 9, 2020 
As our economy begins to recover— 
and I will tell you the jobs numbers are 
very promising—we need to make sure 
that our communities are safe. This 
starts at the local level with Governors 
and mayors in cities like Minneapolis 
and New York and Los Angeles. 
Last week, the Wall Street Journal 
had an editorial that was titled ‘‘Lib-
eral Cities, Radical Mayhem.’’ Demo-
cratic mayors and Governors seem un-
able to stop the lawlessness. It in-
cluded a warning. It said: 
This isn’t merely about damage to prop-
erty. It’s about destroying the order required 
for city life. 
They went on to say: 
Non-criminals are afraid to go into these 
cities in order to make a living. 
Now you have seen New York Gov-
ernor Cuomo blaming Mayor de Blasio, 
as well as the New York Police Depart-
ment, for failing to stop the violence in 
New York City. The Manhattan Insti-
tute says that the riots likely caused 
New York businesses tens of millions of 
dollars last week alone. This is in dam-
ages. 
Nationwide, at least 12 people have 
been killed in the riots last week, in-
cluding police officers. The rioters 
have committed many acts of violence 
against police officers, as well as 
against innocent bystanders. In New 
York City alone, 292 officers have been 
injured last week. One New York police 
officer was stabbed in the neck, and 
two others were shot last Wednesday 
night in Brooklyn. In Los Angeles, 27 
officers were injured during just one 
night of rioting. One officer suffered a 
fractured skull and another a broken 
knee. 
On Thursday, Attorney General Bill 
Barr gave a briefing on the administra-
tion’s efforts to end the violence. The 
Attorney General also said that Presi-
dent Trump has directed him to spare 
no effort in seeking justice in the 
George Floyd case. 
The State has filed criminal charges 
against the four officers, and Federal 
authorities 
are 
investigating 
civil 
rights violations. The Attorney Gen-
eral is claiming and now has said that 
there is clear evidence that extremist 
groups like antifa were inciting the 
riots. The lawlessness, he said, must 
and will stop. 
Our free society depends on the rule 
of law, and the Attorney General has 
said that the rule of law will prevail. 
We need to continue to focus on social, 
economic, educational, and police re-
forms. Still, no sensible reform in-
volves defunding the police. Police are 
civil servants. Their job is difficult, 
and their job is dangerous. 
They may need more resources, not 
fewer, as Democrats across the country 
are calling for defunding. I am saying 
they may need more. They may need 
more training. They may need more re-
sources for body cameras. They may 
need more resources to help recruit of-
ficers who match their communities. 
There is much more that needs to be 
done, and defunding is not part of it. 
We can never abandon those who pro-
tect us. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. CAS-
SIDY). The clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. RUBIO. I ask unanimous consent 
that the order for the quorum call be 
rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
RACISM 
Mr. RUBIO. The murder of Mr. Floyd 
at the hands of law enforcement offi-
cers was an outrageous crime that has 
shocked this Nation, but it would be a 
mistake to conclude that the unrest of 
the last 2 weeks are only about his 
death or are only about relations with 
the police. 
At its core, what this unrest is about 
is the question of what kind of society 
we are and what kind of society do we 
want to be. 
A society is a voluntary agreement, 
by people, to live together. For a soci-
ety to thrive, those in it must believe 
that their interests are protected and 
their voices are heard, but when a sub-
stantial number of people in a society 
come to believe that they are not val-
ued; that they do not matter; or that 
they are not wanted, then that society 
will have big problems. 
For decades, African Americans have 
complained that they feel their voices 
are being ignored, their problems not 
being addressed, and their lives not 
valued. 
Given our Nation’s history with race, 
this is an uncomfortable grievance— 
one many would rather avoid. Like a 
bad debt that must eventually be paid, 
it is a grievance we can no longer ig-
nore. 
Like before, the latest unrest has 
given rise to voices arguing that the 
foundations of our Republic are built 
on systemic racism and must, there-
fore, be brought down. The only dif-
ference is that, this time, claims like 
these don’t just come from the fringes 
of our politics. Like before, we also 
have voices that say that, today, race 
is only a factor in individual cases, dis-
tinct from our society at large. Both of 
these views are wrong. 
The foundations of our country are 
not 
irredeemably 
racist. 
Abolition, 
women’s suffrage, desegregation, the 
civil rights movement—these were not 
appeals to overthrow our values; these 
were demands that we fulfill them. 
The Constitution that once consid-
ered slaves three-fifths of a human 
being was ultimately the vehicle that 
was used to free them and, eventually, 
to secure their most basic rights. 
It is also true that we have made tre-
mendous progress on racial equality 
over the last 50 years, but there remain 
shocking racial disparities on health, 
on education, on housing, on econom-
ics, and on criminal justice, and there 
remains the fundamental truth that 
any society in which a substantial per-
centage of the people believe that they 
are treated unjustly is a society that 
has a problem, a society that can never 
fulfill its full potential unless those 
grievances are addressed. 
None of this excuses radical, violent 
extremists setting fires, looting build-
ings, and hurting innocent people, but 
it also shouldn’t lead us to stupid ideas 
like defunding the police. 
And this is not going to be fixed by 
endless emails from corporation after 
corporation trying to prove how woke 
they are, even as they outsource your 
job to China. 
It is also not going to be fixed by pre-
tending that race is no longer an issue 
and by accusing everyone who dis-
agrees and says it is of hating America. 
Yes, there are still vile racists among 
us, although few of them will ever 
openly admit it, but in 21st century 
America, few people consider them-
selves racist. 
The primary reason why race re-
mains relevant today is that the Afri-
can-American 
community 
faces 
a 
unique set of challenges that far too 
few people in positions of power and 
politics fully understand. 
If a child is raised in a stable home, 
in a safe neighborhood, attends a good 
school, and they have a private tutor 
to help them with the SAT, while an-
other child 2 miles away is raised by 
one parent, or maybe even a grand-
parent, they live in substandard hous-
ing, in a dangerous neighborhood, they 
attend a school that is failing, or fail-
ing them, and they don’t have a private 
tutor for the SAT—on most days they 
don’t have access to Wi-Fi—do these 
two kids really have an equal oppor-
tunity to go to the same college? 
If one college student has the connec-
tions or the money to do unpaid intern-
ships in the summer or to study abroad 
and another student has to work in the 
summer just so they can afford to go 
back to school in the fall, do they real-
ly have an equal opportunity to get 
hired when they graduate? 
If one young adult does something 
stupid and gets arrested, but his par-
ents hire good lawyers, and he is able 
to avoid having a criminal record, but 
another young adult who does the 
exact same thing has to use a public 
defender, pleads guilty to a lesser 
charge but now has a criminal record, 
do they really have an equal oppor-
tunity when they apply for the same 
job? 
When policymakers encourage send-
ing manufacturing jobs that once em-
ployed African-American men overseas 
in an effort to benefit those employed 
in technology and finance, how can we 
truly expect widespread prosperity for 
all Americans? 
When a disproportionate number of 
those with these disadvantages comes 
from one race while a disproportionate 
number of those with the advantages 
comes from another, the result is a ra-
cial disparity.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2792 
June 9, 2020 
Some suggest that these disparities 
are the result of institutionalized rac-
ism or of a deliberate effort designed to 
harm African Americans. 
What I truly believe is that it is the 
product of something far less sinister 
but sometimes equally damaging. It is 
the result of racial indifference, of the 
fact that many in positions of power 
and influence are oblivious—are un-
aware—of the unique challenges that 
disproportionately face African-Amer-
ican communities across this country. 
We must now acknowledge these 
challenges and address these dispari-
ties that they create because, when dis-
parities go unaddressed, they become 
grievances. When grievances are ig-
nored, it leads to friction and division 
and, ultimately, unrest. 
By no means do these disparities 
alone fully capture the entirety of the 
challenge before us. There still remain 
points of friction, more reminiscent of 
a different and shameful era in our his-
tory. 
Here, too, we can also suffer from in-
difference because the vast majority of 
Americans simply do not personally 
know the sting that comes from im-
plicit and sometimes explicit reactions 
to the color of your skin, which is why 
true progress requires that we listen to 
the viewpoints of those who do. 
Listen to the young man I know who 
sees reports of a young man who looks 
like him—like his uncles, like his 
grandfather—being murdered by vigi-
lantes in a case of mistaken identity. 
Who knows, had they had not taken 
video of themselves doing this, they 
would have gotten away with it. 
Listen, and he will tell you that he 
feels his life wouldn’t matter either if 
it wasn’t because he played profes-
sional football. 
Listen to the police officer I know 
who was pulled over while off duty at 
least seven times by his own depart-
ment for no reason, and he will tell you 
of the humiliation of having to explain 
this to his teenage son. 
Listen to what it feels like to see on 
the news that, when a mother in Miami 
recently drowned her own autistic son 
in a terrible tragedy—do you know how 
she tried to cover it up? By falsely tell-
ing the police that he had been ab-
ducted by two African-American men 
demanding drugs. 
Listen to what it feels like to read 
about the indictment of the chief of po-
lice of Biscayne Park, FL, who, in an 
effort to brag about having a perfect 
crime-solving record, ordered his offi-
cers to arrest anybody Black walking 
through their streets and, if they had 
any kind of criminal record, pin one of 
their unsolved crimes on them. 
Listen not because it is your fault, 
not because you are to blame; listen 
because this is what people who want 
to live together in harmony must do. 
This is the respect we owe one an-
other as colleagues, as coworkers. This 
is the empathy that is required of us as 
neighbors, as friends, and as children of 
the same God. 
This may not be your fault, but this 
is our problem because, until we heal 
this divide, we will never ever have the 
kind of society we want, and we will 
never fulfill the full promise of our Na-
tion. 
There is reason for hope, even in a 
deeply divided country where the polit-
ical and cultural lines that divide us 
continue to harden. 
A clear consensus has emerged that 
we can no longer ignore matters of race 
in America, but it is a fragile con-
sensus, already being tested by loud 
voices appealing to our most basic 
fears or those who see the opportunity 
to advance divisiveness and extreme 
ideas. 
If this is the path we choose, we will 
all look back at this time with pro-
found regret, and we will be left with a 
society that is even angrier and more 
divided than it is now. We will be left 
with an America that no longer resem-
bles the one we honor when we stand 
during the National Anthem. 
Ironically, we will ultimately be left 
with an America even further away 
from the one some kneel to demand. 
The only way forward is to treat each 
other with the empathy and respect re-
quired of the people who have decided 
to share a nation and a future. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
H.R. 1957 
Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, I am 
here tonight on the floor to talk about 
a historic opportunity for our country 
and for our national parks—a true 
treasure of this country. When Teddy 
Roosevelt started the national parks, 
he wanted to preserve some of the most 
beautiful, pristine lands in America for 
public use. 
It was a good decision. Now we have 
84 million acres of parkland all around 
the country. Some of them are histor-
ical parks, battlefields, or Presidents’ 
homes. Some of them are like Yosem-
ite or Yellowstone. The Tetons are 
known as spectacular, beautiful vistas. 
Others, like Cuyahoga Valley National 
Park in Ohio, are really suburban 
parks. It sits between Cleveland and 
Akron, OH. It is the 13th most visited 
park in the United States of America. 
It is a fantastic park—for fishing, for 
hiking, for bicycling, for going on a 
scenic railroad. 
People love the parks. There is a 
good reason for that—because they are 
spectacular. In fact, visitation at the 
parks is up. During the 10 years just be-
fore the park centennial, which was in 
2016, we had about a $58 million in-
crease in visitors to our national 
parks. 
As the coronavirus begins to fade— 
thank goodness—more and more people 
are wanting to be outside, do things 
with their family, do something that is 
not expensive but is fun and healthy. 
Our national parks are the perfect 
place. As our parks begin to reopen, we 
are going to get more and more visitors 
to those parks. 
The problem is, when they go to 
these parks, they are going to find that 
there are some issues. These issues are 
that our national parks over the years 
have not kept up with their mainte-
nance, with the basics of what you 
would expect in any organization—the 
water systems, the roads, the bridges, 
the bathrooms, the visitor centers, the 
trails. Many of these are now closed in 
some of our parks because they haven’t 
had the funding to do the capital im-
provements, the things you would 
think about in deferred maintenance at 
your home. For instance, if your roof 
starts to leak, you want to fix it be-
cause if you don’t, then your wall be-
gins to get moldy or your floor begins 
to couple. That is what is happening in 
our national parks. 
Not only has Congress not provided 
the money for these more expensive in-
frastructure changes in our parks, but 
that has caused additional damage. 
Every day it is causing more and more 
damage. It is the biggest challenge we 
have in the parks. 
I was a member of what is called the 
Centennial Commission for the na-
tional parks, which is a private sector 
group that was formed when I was not 
in public office a few years ago, and it 
was working up to the 2016 centennial. 
The top issue was this deferred mainte-
nance. 
I have been on the Energy and Nat-
ural Resources Committee and have 
been passing legislation related to the 
parks. The Centennial Act we passed in 
2016. That was very important because 
it provided more funding for the parks. 
Frankly, we could not come up with 
enough money through the appropria-
tions process to deal with these long- 
term problems. Why? Because they are 
so expensive. In the parks, it is be-
lieved there is now a $12.5 billion short-
fall—a $12.5 billion deferred mainte-
nance project. 
We fund the parks every year, but we 
fund them for the rangers, for the nat-
uralist programs. We fund some of the 
good work that is being done with 
schoolchildren and so on, but these big 
expenditures, like a new road or a new 
bridge or, in the case of Cuyahoga Val-
ley National Park, a new railway sys-
tem because the rails themselves need 
to be improved and replaced—those 
things are too doggone expensive for 
annual appropriations. 
Several years ago, some of us came 
up with an idea of providing more pub-
lic-private partnerships with the parks. 
The Centennial Act, which I authored, 
does that. In fact, we have been able to 
provide a match of greater than 1 to 1

called our Centennial Challenge Fund.

Government, and it has been matched

more than 1 to 1 by private sector 
money. That is helpful, but it cannot 
again handle these huge expenditures. 
Another idea—Senator MARK
WAR-
NER of Virginia actually came to me on 
this several years ago and said: Why 
don’t we take some of the revenue that 
is coming from our oil and gas and 
other energy projects that are on Fed-
eral land, both onshore and offshore, 
and take some of those royalties—the 
revenue the Federal Government de-
rives from that, which is not going to 
another purpose—and say that a part of 
those revenues, not all but a part of it, 
should be focused on this issue of infra-
structure, of this deferred mainte-
nance, that is growing and growing in 
our parks and getting more expensive 
every year if we don’t fix it. 
I love that idea because that is ex-
actly what the oil and gas revenue 
money ought to be used for—to help in 
terms of our natural resources. It is 
not everything. The $12.5 billion has 
about $6 billion of immediate projects 
that need to be handled right away. 
These are the priority projects. Those 
are the ones we focus on. For the next 
5 years, in our legislation, we are re-
quiring that enough of those resources 
from the royalties come in to handle 
that $6 million, assuming that the roy-
alties are there. Right now, the cost of 
oil is so low that it would be tough to 
meet that. We think, over time, that 
will even out, and we will have enough. 
If there is not, then the money will not 
be there, but if it is, the money will be 
there to do exactly what we ought to 
do, which is, in the end, to save tax-
payers’ money by fixing some of these 
problems before they get worse. 
Some people say: Well, it is better to 
do it with an annual appropriations in 
Congress. I would say to that, in many 
respects, this funding for our park is a 
debt unpaid. In other words, it is 
money that we should have been pay-
ing all along to keep up with the roads, 
the bridges, the buildings, the railway 
systems, the seawalls—which I will 
talk 
about 
in 
a 
minute—but 
we 
haven’t. We have allowed this to build 
up. 
In a way, this is a debt that is on our 
books that we have to deal with. Think 
about it in your family or in your busi-
ness, if you allow these deferred main-
tenance problems to continue to grow, 
you end up having additional costs. We 
need to take care of it. This is a great 
way to do it, taking these revenues and 
applying it to these immediate prob-
lems. 
By the way, there was a lot of discus-
sion in Congress over the years about 
shovel-ready projects. When you do in-
frastructure spending, you want it to 
be shovel-ready. These are shovel-ready 
because they have been vetted. We re-
quire the Park Service to provide us 
every year what their infrastructure 
needs are, what their priority infra-
structure needs are and to rank them. 
For every single national park prop-
erty in America, we know what it is. 
As an example, this is the William 
Howard Taft birthplace in my home-
town of Cincinnati, Ohio. As you can 
see, the ceiling is leaking. What hap-
pens is, the ceiling leaks. And then, the 
walls are getting damaged, the floor is 
getting damaged, and some beautiful 
furniture from the Taft era is getting 
damaged. We need to fix it. It is a big 
expense. It is the entire roof that has 
to be repaired. 
Their annual budget is not nearly 
enough do that. They have an annual 
budget. It takes care of a few park 
rangers who are naturalists and inter-
preters. They have a lot of school kids 
who come through, as an example, and 
others who want to see the history of 
William Howard Taft’s upbringing, who 
was a Chief Justice as well as President 
of the United States. There is no way 
the annual appropriation from Con-
gress able to do something like that. It 
needs these additional resources. 
Here we are at the Cuyahoga Na-
tional Valley National Park. This is 
one of the buildings. As you can see, it 
is not in great repair. They don’t have 
money to take it down and not enough 
money to repair these kind of build-
ings. All they want to do with this 
building, by the way, is to take it 
down. It is a hazard. As you can imag-
ine, it is attracting crime and drug use 
and other issues. They have several 
buildings like that. 
Here is another one. This is the rail-
way I talked about at the Cuyahoga 
Valley National Park. I am here with 
the park director. This ranger is a guy 
who has been all around the country. 
He told me that in every single one of 
our parks, he has had to work through 
this issue. How do you take our budget 
and make sure you have the rangers, 
have the naturalist programs, and keep 
things in order but then don’t have 
enough to pay for these big expenses? 
We are right near a bridge here that 
is also falling down. When the bridge is 
falling down, the people will not be 
able to access the trail and the bike 
trail. It is a big expense. You have to 
do it. 
Here I am at the Perry Monument. 
This is on Lake Erie. For those of you 
who have been to Put-in-Bay, you 
know it is a great place to go. The 
Perry Monument is awesome. It not 
only talks about William Perry and his 
history and legacy but the War of 1812 
and all of the veterans of that war and 
the relationship now between Canada 
and the United States and the UK, now 
being our great allies. That was not al-
ways so. The War of 1812 was essential 
for the United States and something as 
part of a historical park to be remem-
bered. 
The seawall that protects that me-
morial is crumbling. The seawalls don’t 
last forever. This one is not lasting for-
ever, particularly as the Lake Erie 
water level is increasing. You can see 
that not only is the seawall crumbling, 
but there are potholes behind me that 
cause sinkholes, they call them. People 
are not allowed to go out on the lake-
front here in many places because of 
that. That is a huge expense to do a 
seawall. They have to do it to protect 
the monument itself. The visitor cen-
ter there is not ADA compatible, the 
Americans with Disabilities Act. They 
need funding to do that, which is a 
major expense. 
These are the kinds of things we are 
talking about. This is not just my 
home State of Ohio. This is about $100 
million that needs to come out of this 
fund just for the State of Ohio. 
Again, there are other States that 
have bigger national parks and more 
needs and more infrastructure and 
more roads and bridges that need help, 
but for us this is really important. We 
have to be sure that we are protecting 
this incredible treasure from future 
generations. 
That is what this legislation is 
about. It is going to be on the floor this 
week and voted on as part of the Great 
American Outdoors Act, which in-
cludes, also, money for the Land and 
Water Conservation Fund. 
I will say, with regard to the na-
tional park funding, this funding is di-
rected at stewardship. In other words, 
not a single penny of the money we are 
talking about with Restore Our Parks 
Act that I have been describing can go 
to expansion of a park—not one penny. 
All of it has to go toward restoring the 
parks, toward stewardship of the parks. 
I think that is important because 
whether you are a Republican or a 
Democrat, I think you should agree 
that to the extent we have these parks 
and have this land, we need to take 
better care of them. It is our responsi-
bility. We are the stewards. Our gen-
eration is the steward for future gen-
erations. We have not done it. This is 
an opportunity to right that wrong. We 
need to get back on track. 
My hope is that we will continue to 
see support for this on both sides of the 
aisle, both sides of the Capitol. It is 
really important. We saw on Monday 
night there was a first trial vote to be 
able to proceed to the debate on this 
bill. That vote was overwhelming—80 
Senators voted for it out of 100. That is 
unusual around here. That shows, 
again, the bipartisan nature of this and 
the fact that this is carefully thought 
out. We spent a lot of time on it. We 
got it out of committee not once but a 
couple of times. We have done a lot of 
research on it. We made sure the parks 
are providing us with good data to 
know what these projects are, what are 
their highest priorities. 
There is a lot of discussion in this 
Chamber about putting more money 
into infrastructure, and maybe that 
will be done as part of the next legisla-
tion. They have been talking about it, 
in terms of the next stimulus package, 
to have infrastructure funding. Wheth-
er it is rural broadband or whether it is 
our ports or our roads or our bridges, I 
think there is an opportunity there. If 
you put a dollar in, you get more than 
a dollar back if you do the right kind 
of smart economic infrastructure. 
There are two problems with it. One, 
often it is not merit-based if Congress

does it. Remember the Bridge to No-
where years ago where there was a 
bridge in Alaska that didn’t go any-
where, but we were going to pay mil-
lions of dollars for it. These are not 
‘‘bridges to nowhere.’’ These projects 
have all been vetted. It is a merit-based 
process. 
Second, sometimes they just aren’t 
shovel-ready. In other words, the pri-
ority is to fix something, but you don’t 
have the permits; you don’t have the 
approval. These are on national park 
lands. They have the approval. They 
are ready to go. They are shovel-ready. 
They are merit-based. 
Discussion around here often about 
infrastructure is not to pay for it with 
an offset but rather—because infra-
structure 
spending 
returns 
capital, 
which it does if it is done properly. 
This would return a lot because this is 
stuff that is going to involve more visi-
tors, 
more 
revenue 
being 
raised— 
through people coming to the parks 
and attendance at the parks—for the 
communities, certainly, that the parks 
are in but even for the parks them-
selves. We are talking often about not 
paying for it. Here, we actually do have 
it paid for. It is not a traditional pay- 
for—I acknowledge that—but it is fund-
ing that comes from the royalties, 
again, from offshore and onshore oil 
and gas and other energy projects that 
goes into fixing our national parks. It 
is our responsibility as stewards to do 
that. 
My hope is that what we will see to-
morrow and the next day and maybe 
into next week, depending on how long 
people want to debate this, is that we 
can continue to have the support we 
saw on Monday night for our parks. It 
is one of the true treasures of our coun-
try. It is a great asset that if we don’t 
fix it, it will not be there for future 
generations because these things—once 
they start to crumble, once the seawall 
is gone, the monument is gone. When 
you have a situation where bathrooms 
are closed or trails are closed, people 
are going to show up and be, under-
standably, disappointed that the U.S. 
Congress did not take advantage of this 
opportunity if we do not vote for this 
to be able to fix the parks for future 
generations. 
Finally, I would like to thank not 
just my colleague Senator WARNER, 
whom I talked about earlier, who has 
been a champion on this issue, but also 
Senator LAMAR ALEXANDER and Sen-
ator ANGUS KING. Senator ALEXANDER 
has been involved in these issues for 
many years. Back in the Reagan ad-
ministration, he was on another Com-
mission. I mentioned the Centennial 
Commission for the parks. He was on 
another Commission for the great out-
doors, 
which 
recommended 
dealing 
with this issue. Again, it has been the 
top issue for our national parks. 
If we can pass this legislation—$6.5 
billion over the next 5 years for our na-
tional parks—this will truly be his-
toric. This is, in a sense, a Teddy Roo-
sevelt moment for us, in this genera-
tion, our generation, to be able to right 
the wrongs and fix the problems and 
get our parks back on track so they 
will be there for future generations. 
I also want to thank the President of 
the United States and his Cabinet be-
cause they have been helpful in this— 
the Secretary of the Interior, the Di-
rector of the Office of Management and 
Budget. President Trump himself actu-
ally increased the size of this program 
by saying: Let’s not just include our 
national parks; let’s also include our 
national wildlife; let’s include our na-
tional forests. 
This is even a broader program than 
just national parks now. This is really 
important. It was in the President’s 
budget each of the last 3 years, and I 
appreciate that. That gives us a chance 
to talk about how to get this not just 
through the Senate and through the 
House but actually signed into law be-
cause the President is prepared to sign 
it if we can get our work done here. 
I hope my colleagues will do again 
what they did on Monday night—recog-
nize that this is an important initia-
tive at a time when our country is once 
again polarized. We have plenty of 
issues between the coronavirus and 
what is happening on the streets. Isn’t 
it good to see something that can bring 
our country, our Senate, our House, 
and our President together to do some-
thing that is important for future gen-
erations? 
I yield back. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Illinois. 
REMEMBERING LARRY WALSH 
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, this 
week, my State of Illinois is saying a 
fond and final farewell to a deeply 
loved and respected public servant, 
Larry Walsh. He devoted 50 years of his 
life to serving, as he called them, the 
folks back home. He won his first elec-
tion to the local school board in 1970 at 
the age of 21. 
He served in local and county govern-
ment positions and in the Illinois State 
Senate. For the last 16 years, Larry 
was county executive for Will County, 
the fourth largest county in my State 
of Illinois and one of the fastest grow-
ing. 
Larry Walsh was as good at retail 
politics as anybody I have ever seen. 
He loved politics and he loved people 
and it showed. People loved him back. 
Democrats, Republicans, farmers, city 
folk—they all loved Larry. 
He was one of the longest serving 
county executives in Will County his-
tory. When he announced last August 
that he would not run for a fifth term 
as executive because the cancer he was 
battling for 5 years was gaining the 
upper hand, there was hardly a dry eye 
in the room. Everyone with whom he 
had worked was saddened by that an-
nouncement. 
He said at that press conference: 
‘‘I’ve been a very blessed man and a 
very lucky man.’’ 
From where I am sitting, I think the 
really lucky ones were Larry’s folks 
back home. Also lucky were those who 
worked with him and called him a 
friend. I am honored to count myself 
among them. 
Lawrence Michael Walsh, born on a 
farm in Elwood, IL, about 10 miles out-
side of Joliet. He was the second of 
eight children. His parents were farm-
ers, as were his grandparents and 
great-grandparents. He carried on that 
family tradition. Farming was in his 
blood. 
He won his first election to the 
school board about 3 weeks before his 
first child was born. Three years later, 
he was elected to the local board of su-
pervisors. He was elected to the Will 
County board in 1974 and again in 1992. 
From 1997, until the year 2005, Larry 
served in the Illinois State Senate in 
Springfield. His Senate district—the 
43rd—included most of Will County, 
parts of Kankakee and Iroquois Coun-
ties. 
There 
were 
cities, 
suburbs, 
and 
farms. In Springfield, he sat in the 
back row of the chamber. He became 
good friends of another senator who sat 
in the seat right next to him. 
To some, it was an amazingly odd 
couple to see the two of them, Larry 
the farmer and conservative Democrat 
and his seatmate, a very liberal, left- 
leaning lawyer from Hyde Park in the 
city of Chicago. 
Both men had an ability that is all 
too rare in today’s brand of politics. 
They could see beyond labels. They 
were both passionate about building 
coalitions and finding common ground, 
and they both liked a good game of 
poker. So they became good friends. 
In 2004, when his friend decided to 
run for the U.S. Senate, Larry Walsh 
was the first Senator to endorse him. 
Larry took his seatmate to meet the 
farmers and other folks in small towns 
in Will and Kankakee Iroquois coun-
ties. 
Four years later, that seatmate of 
his was elected President of the United 
States, and Larry Walsh was right here 
in Washington to see Barack Obama in-
augurated as the leader of our great 
Nation. 
Larry Walsh was a fine and decent 
man. He was thoughtful and witty, 
loyal and trustworthy. He seemed to 
radiate joy, and his joy would fill a 
room. He was grounded in reality and 
modest. He had a big booming voice— 
you couldn’t miss it—and you sure as 
heck could not miss his laugh, and 
there were plenty of them. 
His friends included a President, Cab-
inet members and Governors and men 
and women who swept the floors in his 
offices. 
In 2007, Will County Democrats cre-
ated a new award to honor those work-
ing to promote progress and the com-
mon good. They named the award after 
the man who exemplified those quali-
ties—the 
Larry 
Walsh 
Lifetime 
Achievement Award. 
Well, fittingly, the first recipient of 
the Larry Walsh Lifetime Achievement 
Award was Larry Walsh. I laughed

June 9, 2020 
about that so many times and never let 
him forget it. Every time he visited my 
office, I would remind him that he was 
the first recipient of the Larry Walsh 
Award. 
Larry’s admirers transcended party 
labels. George Pearson, chairman of 
the Will County Republican Party, told 
a reporter that Larry ‘‘greeted me each 
time we met with a handshake, a smile 
and a pat on the shoulder. You would 
never have known we were on opposite 
sides of the political aisle, and that is 
what made Larry popular with Will 
County residents.’’ 
The other thing that made Larry 
Walsh so popular with the people of his 
county was that he was just incredibly 
good at his job. 
As county executive, Larry worked 
hard to professionalize and modernize 
county government and make it more 
responsive. He built a strong financial 
foundation for this great county, which 
improved its bond rating and enabled 
him to lead the largest capital im-
provement program in the history of 
the county. The county built new roads 
and bridges, a new public safety com-
plex, new county health facilities, and 
a new courthouse scheduled to open in 
October. 
In the Illinois State Senate, he was 
instrumental in, among others things, 
developing the Abraham Lincoln Na-
tional Cemetery in Elwood; the rede-
velopment of the Joliet Arsenal into a 
modern intermodal freight terminal, 
the CenterPoint Intermodal Center; 
and the designation of the Midewin Na-
tional Tallgrass Prairie—the first na-
tional tallgrass prairie in the United 
States. 
There was a time when we thought it 
was the end of the world for Will Coun-
ty when Joliet Arsenal was given up by 
the Federal Government, but thanks to 
Larry Walsh and his buddy George 
Sangmeister and many others, it be-
came a showpiece for the rest of the 
United States to see how this piece of 
Federal real estate had a bright, bright 
future. 
Larry was most proud of his family. 
My wife Loretta and I offer our deepest 
condolences to Irene, Larry’s wife of 50 
years, and the love of his life. I called 
her on the phone just the other day 
when Larry passed, and we talked 
about the rough period toward the end 
of his life, but we knew it was coming. 
Today, we look back on it as a moment 
of trial that he endured until that mo-
ment when he left and left behind not 
only that love of his life Irene but their 
daughter Sarah, their five sons, Larry 
Jr. and Shawn—both of whom followed 
dad into public service—Frank, Mat-
thew, and Brian and 20 grandkids. He 
was so proud of every single one of 
them. 
Because of the pandemic, the sendoff 
for Larry is going to be much smaller 
than it would have been in Will Coun-
ty. There will be visitation from 2 to 8 
on Thursday, followed by a private fu-
neral mass on Friday, and local folks 
are expected to line the route from the 
church to the cemetery. 
A couple of final thoughts about my 
friend Larry: He was a bridge builder. 
He had inexhaustible patience when it 
came to searching for common ground 
in order to make government work and 
solve big problems. Don’t we need more 
leaders like him today? 
Larry loved life. Every Christmas 
season, for years, the local theater 
company in Joliet put on a stage pro-
duction of that classic movie ‘‘It’s a 
Wonderful Life.’’ The show was always 
broadcast on a local radio station, and 
for many years, right up to this last 
Christmas, Larry Walsh played the 
part of Clarence. You will remember 
Clarence at the end of the movie. He 
was the guardian angel. Clarence was 
always hoping to earn his wings. Clar-
ence was assigned to watch over 
George Bailey, who is so despondent 
one Christmas Eve he is thinking about 
jumping off a bridge. Clarence the 
guardian angel’s assignment was to get 
George to change his mind. 
Clarence did that by showing George 
how much the people in his hometown 
would have missed had George not been 
part of their lives. Clarence tells 
George: 
Strange, isn’t it? Each man’s life touches 
so many other lives. When he isn’t around, 
he leaves an awful hole, doesn’t he? 
Many of us are feeling an awful hole 
today 
with 
the 
passing 
of 
Larry 
Walsh—this good man and devoted pub-
lic servant. 
Even though we can’t schedule the 
kind of Irish wake that Larry so richly 
deserved, there is something we can do. 
Besides his family, his faith, his com-
munity and public service, there was 
something that Larry was also fond of. 
After a hard day of work, Larry was 
known to enjoy a Pabst Blue Ribbon 
beer. In his honor, if you are so in-
clined, may we raise a PBR to Larry 
and a life well lived, and may we re-
solve to fill the hole he has left by fol-
lowing his uncommon example. 
CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM 
Mr. President, this past weekend, I 
went back to Illinois and visited with 
two different groups—one on Friday, 
another on Saturday. They were young 
African Americans on the South Side 
of Chicago and in my hometown of 
Springfield. 
I wanted to sit down with these 
young people, some just barely high 
school students, who had been engaged 
in protests and demonstrations in their 
hometowns and ask them what it was 
about, what it meant to them. I wanted 
to hear it firsthand. 
They talked about the killing of 
George Floyd in Minneapolis and how 
it changed the conversation about jus-
tice in America, and it moved them to 
stand up and speak up. 
I am proud to say that those I met 
with have engaged in peaceful dem-
onstrations consistent with American 
values and our Constitution. 
I am proud of them because there 
were no distractions. They were fo-
cused on Black Lives Matter and true 
justice in America. 
When we met, I asked questions of 
some of them. I wanted to know a little 
bit more about them and their lives 
and what brought them to this mo-
ment. 
I asked each of them about the con-
versation—you know, that conversa-
tion when young people are called in by 
their parents and warned about the 
perils and challenges of being Black in 
America. 
One young woman remembered her 
mother cautioning her to always ask 
for a receipt with every purchase to 
prove, if ever challenged, that the item 
had not been shoplifted. Many talked 
about hairstyles and clothing that they 
learned to be dangerous in the eyes of 
some White Americans. 
They were even warned about the 
danger of any contact with the police 
and how their tone of voice and every 
move had to be carefully considered— 
every one of them. 
Every one of them remembered the 
first time they were called the ‘‘N’’ 
word. 
That graphic video of the last mo-
ments of George Floyd’s life, when he 
was pleading ‘‘I can’t breathe’’ and the 
cold stare of the policeman, with his 
knee on George Floyd’s neck, ignoring 
the pleas for mercy—those images 
touched the conscience of America and 
the world, and these young people were 
touched by it. 
They know and we all know, sadly, 
that what happened to George Floyd 
was not an exception. 
Since 2015, the Washington Post has 
been following the number of people 
shot and killed by police. Through 2019, 
the total number has hovered near 1,000 
annually. Ninety-four percent of the 
victims were armed. 
The Post reports: 
The number of black and unarmed people 
fatally shot by police has declined since 2015, 
but whether armed or not, black people are 
shot and killed at a disproportionately high-
er rate than white people. 
They note in their newspaper this 
morning the death rate by race in un-
armed shootings was 7.3 percent for 
Whites, 10.7 percent for Hispanics, and 
30.3 percent for Blacks. 
The anger and pain that we have seen 
on the streets in recent days is a reflec-
tion of generations of trauma. People 
are fed up with racism that has led to 
this injustice, and many of these young 
people leading this protest are deter-
mined not to live in its shadow any 
longer. 
There are hundreds of thousands of 
police officers in our Nation. Most will 
never use their firearms. Many who do 
must make split-second, life-or-death 
decisions. I know many of them person-
ally. I believe the ones I know are pro-
fessional and humane. 
If we are honest, we know that with-
in their ranks are police officers who 
do not have the training or tempera-

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2796 
June 9, 2020 
on inherent bias, use of force, training 
and accountability for unjust actions. 
Prosecutors and judges need to join 
us in the pursuit of real justice, and 
legislators like myself need to undo 
the damage of a criminal justice sys-
tem fraught with racial disparity. 
The Obama Task Force on 21st Cen-
tury Policing released a report in 2015 
to strengthen community policing and 
restore trust between law enforcement 
and the communities they serve. The 
Trump administration shelved this ef-
fort in 2017. It is time to take it off the 
shelf. 
This week, I join Senators BOOKER 
and HARRIS in cosponsoring the Justice 
in Policing Act of 2020—a comprehen-
sive approach to bring accountability 
to policing, change methods and prac-
tices, and build trust. It draws the line 
on odious police practices and sets 
goals and standards for recruitment, 
training, and retraining. 
Even that is not enough. Justice in 
America requires more than improving 
law enforcement. We cannot put racism 
behind us until we invest in opportuni-
ties for quality education, medical care 
that meets the highest standards, jobs 
with livable wages, opportunities, and 
safe affordable housing. 
The young people I met with want an 
America that is more just. Let them 
lead us into a future where we can all 
breathe more easily. 
I held hearings on race in America 
when I was chairman of the Sub-
committee on the Constitution and 
Civil Rights—one in December of 2014. 
The hearing was held just a month 
after the death of Tamir Rice, a 12- 
year-old boy shot and killed by a police 
officer in Cleveland while he played 
with a toy gun. 
I said then, and, sadly, I must repeat 
today, when unarmed African-Amer-
ican men and boys are killed in our 
streets, there is much work to be done 
to find justice in America. 
This followed a hearing I had held 
the previous year where we heard 
heartbreaking testimony from Sybrina 
Fulton, the mother of Trayvon Martin, 
and LUCY MCBATH, the mother of Jor-
dan Davis. LUCY has been elected to the 
U.S. House of Representatives from 
Georgia since. 
Both of these innocent young Black 
men were gunned down by violent 
White vigilantes. 
Now we again grieve the lives of two 
Black men and a Black woman—lives 
cut far too short in incidents of inex-
plicable 
and 
inexcusable 
violence— 
Ahmaud Arbery out for a jog; Breonna 
Taylor at home in her bedroom; and 
George Floyd on a curbside in Min-
neapolis. 
Once 
again, 
those 
gut-wrenching 
words ‘‘I can’t breathe’’ bring tears to 
our eyes. How many more names of 
Black men, women, and children will 
we cry out in protest before things 
change? We need to have an honest 
American conversation with law en-
forcement officers about training, in-
herent bias, use of force, and con-
sequences for wrongdoing. We need to 
prohibit police misconduct that is dis-
criminatory and deadly. We must re-
cruit and train the next generation of 
law enforcement to protect and serve 
everyone in America. We need to invest 
in social services instead of expecting 
law enforcement to intervene in crisis 
situations that they are not equipped 
to deal with. 
This will require us—Senators, other 
legislators—to continue to undo the 
damage of a criminal justice system 
that is unfair, in many respects—most 
importantly, require those of us with 
privilege and power to step back and 
listen to African Americans affected by 
pervasive, systemic racism. 
What can we do? A good place to 
start is President Obama’s task force. 
As I mentioned earlier, it was that ad-
ministration’s response to deal with 
community policing and trust in the 
community. It was shelved by the 
Trump administration, and I think it 
would be a good start—a bipartisan 
start—for the Trump administration to 
bring it down from the shelf and start 
a conversation. 
We have an important role to play 
right here in Congress. Unfortunately, 
since Republicans took the Senate ma-
jority in January 2015, the Senate Judi-
ciary Committee has rarely addressed 
issues of racism in our Nation. 
The last hearing on policing in the 
Judiciary Committee was actually 5 
years ago—November 2015—chaired by 
the junior Senator from Texas. It was 
entitled ‘‘The War on Police: How the 
Federal Government Undermines State 
and Local Law Enforcement.’’ It was a 
thinly veiled attack on the efforts of 
the 
Obama 
administration’s 
Civil 
Rights Division. 
The Senate Judiciary Committee 
chairman, LINDSEY GRAHAM, has an-
nounced the Senate will hold a hearing 
on police misconduct next week. I was 
glad to hear it. I hope it is not just one 
and done. We need multiple hearings— 
long overdue. 
It is critical that we also hear from 
Attorney General William Barr. We 
need to know whether the Justice De-
partment will revive the efforts of the 
Obama administration to address po-
lice misconduct, and we need answers 
about what happened at Lafayette 
Square last week—right outside the 
White House, when the Attorney Gen-
eral reportedly ordered Federal law en-
forcement to clear peaceful demonstra-
tors. They used rubber bullets and 
some form of gas. The Attorney Gen-
eral insists it wasn’t tear gas, but I 
have seen it, and it looks like some 
sort of a gas spray designed to push the 
demonstrators away. 
Hearings aren’t enough. We need to 
do something the Senate rarely does 
anymore—pass a law. How about that? 
We need legislation on this subject, not 
lamentation. 
I am proud to join Senators CORY 
BOOKER and KAMALA HARRIS in intro-
ducing this Justice in Policing Act. 
Our 
bill 
includes 
the 
End 
Racial 
Profiling Act—legislation I have co-
sponsored for many years, finally pro-
hibiting the scourge of racial profiling. 
In 2012, I held a hearing on this bill 
to end racial profiling. This was the 
only hearing that the Senate has held 
on racial profiling in 20 years. 
Our bill would ban choke holds—like 
the one that killed George Floyd. It 
will ban no-knock warrants—like the 
one that led to the death of Breonna 
Taylor. 
In 
2014, 
many 
Americans 
were 
shocked to see tanks rolling through 
the streets of Ferguson, MO. Shortly 
afterward, I held a hearing in the same 
subcommittee where we heard compel-
ling testimony about the shocking re-
ality that local police departments all 
over the country are armed to the 
teeth with billions of dollars of mili-
tary surplus equipment. 
Our bill will limit the transfer of 
military-grade equipment to State and 
local police so the weapons of war do 
not 
become 
commonplace 
in 
the 
streets of America. 
The Justice in Policing Act also re-
quires the use of dashboard cameras 
and body cameras for Federal officers, 
State, and local law enforcement. 
Our bill establishes a National Police 
Misconduct Registry to prevent offi-
cers who have engaged in misconduct 
from simply moving to another depart-
ment without accountability. It will 
ensure that individuals whose constitu-
tional rights are violated by police offi-
cers can recover in court. 
After the Civil War, the Congress 
passed the Civil Rights Act of 1871 to 
ensure that any person acting in offi-
cial capacity who deprives another of a 
constitutional or legal right can be 
held liable in court. However, judges 
have strictly limited the use of this 
statue to recover damages for police 
misconduct by creating what is known 
as qualified immunity for police offi-
cers. 
The Justice in Policing Act will end 
this. This is a doctrine created by 
judges and never approved by Congress. 
I call on Senator MCCONNELL to do 
more than just join in speeches about 
George Floyd. I call on him to bring 
the Justice in Policing Act to the floor 
of the Senate as soon as possible. 
Wouldn’t it be amazing, with all the 
protestations and all of the statements 
made by all of the people in the streets, 
by representatives in this administra-
tion from the Department of Justice 
who came before our committee today, 
and each and every one standing up 
and saying they are concerned about 
George Floyd, if we in the U.S. Senate 
actually considered a bill on the sub-
ject—actually considered passing a law 
on this matter? 
We owe it not just to the Senate, we 
owe it to George Floyd, Breonna Tay-
lor, to Ahmaud Arbery, and all of the 
Black and Brown lives we have lost in 
these brutal acts of racial injustice. 
I yield the floor. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Ms. 
MCSALLY). The Senator from Alaska.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2797 
June 9, 2020 
H.R. 1957 
Ms. MURKOWSKI. Madam President, 
last night, I had the opportunity to 
join probably more than 80 of my col-
leagues in voting for a motion to pro-
ceed to S. 3422, the Great American 
Outdoors Act. 
This bill is sponsored by a strong 
group of Senators here—Senator GARD-
NER
of Colorado, Senator DAINES
of 
Montana, and Senator MANCHIN have 
been working very hard on the LWCF 
piece. 
Senator 
ALEXANDER, 
Senator 
PORTMAN, and Senator WARNER
are 
working on the parks’ deferred mainte-
nance aspect of this measure. There 
has been lot of work from a lot of Mem-
bers and a lot of good thought that has 
gone into it and some good policy be-
hind it, but I would like to share with 
colleagues some of the reservations I 
have, albeit this is good policy, solid 
policy in so many areas. 
As with much of everything that we 
can do on the Senate floor, we can al-
ways seek to improve. With some of my 
colleagues, I think we have some ideas 
in areas where we can improve our 
Great American Outdoors Act. 
I come from a State where we know 
a little bit about our great outdoors. I 
know we all like to advertise our sce-
nery, the wildlife that we have, but 
back in Alaska we have some pretty 
unrivaled scenery. We have the moun-
tains. We have got the glaciers. We 
have some of our State’s most impor-
tant natural features that have been 
conserved in some world-famous na-
tional parks, from Katmai and Denali 
to 
the 
Kenai 
Fjords, 
Wrangell-St. 
Elias, Glacier Bay—names that so 
many Americans know and have vis-
ited or hope to one day visit before 
they die. 
We actually had an advertising cam-
paign: See these majestic landscapes 
before you die. 
Americans recognize the importance 
of preserving our very best lands and 
making the most of our ability to expe-
rience their natural splendor. We are 
not welcoming visitors this year in a 
very different time, as we are dealing 
with COVID, but we have no doubt that 
the tourism industry will be back. It 
will be back better than ever before. In 
fact, in yet another advertising cam-
paign, we remind people that Alaska 
waits for you, and we would welcome 
you at any time. 
We have more than 223 million acres 
of Federal lands in total. Included 
within that are more than 76 million 
acres that are managed by U.S. Fish 
and Wildlife Service, more than 71 mil-
lion acres managed by the Bureau of 
Land Management, more than 52 mil-
lion acres managed by the National 
Park Service, and more than 22 million 
acres managed by the Forest Service. 
So we have a lot. We have a lot of 
Federal land, and that means that the 
Federal Government has a major re-
sponsibility to help us maintain it and 
preserve it, just like in every State. 
So I would like to take a few minutes 
to discuss how the policy that we will 
be considering can help us do just that. 
The Great American Outdoors Act 
combines two bills, again, that we re-
ported from the Energy and Natural 
Resources Committee last year. The 
first one is S. 500, the Restore Our 
Parks Act, as I mentioned, led by Sen-
ators PORTMAN, ALEXANDER, WARNER, 
and KING, which aims to tackle the 
Park Service’s $12 billion deferred 
maintenance backlog. 
The second one is S. 1081, from Sen-
ators MANCHIN, GARDNER, and DAINES, 
to provide full and mandatory funding 
for the Land and Water Conservation 
Fund. 
To 
tackle 
deferred 
maintenance 
needs, the Great American Outdoors 
Act establishes a new National Parks 
and Public Land Legacy Restoration 
Fund. That fund will provide up to $1.9 
billion per year for 5 years to relevant 
Federal land management agencies. 
The Great American Outdoors Act 
also expands the list of agencies that 
can receive funding beyond the Park 
Service to include the Forest Service, 
Fish and Wildlife Service, BLM, and 
the Bureau of Indian Education, which 
also has significant maintenance needs. 
This was something we recognized 
within the Energy Committee as we 
were looking at the status and situa-
tion on the maintenance of national 
parks. It begs the question, What about 
our other public lands? 
In Alaska, our forest lands are great 
sources of recreation and opportunity, 
but they, too, have seen a maintenance 
backlog just continue to accumulate. 
When you visit Denali, the Grand Can-
yon, or Yosemite, you may not nec-
essarily notice immediately the de-
ferred maintenance issues. Likewise, as 
you drive into Washington, DC, you 
might not even realize that the George 
Washington Parkway is part of our Na-
tional Park System, let alone a major 
contributor to the agency’s mainte-
nance backlog. The reality is that the 
Park Service, in particular, has carried 
substantial backlogs for a long time. 
As chairman of the Interior Appro-
priations Subcommittee, this is some-
thing we have been working to try to 
get on top of, but it is like getting on 
top of this wave. If you can’t get on top 
of it, it is just going to bury you. That 
is what has happened when you think 
about the $12 billion backlog. These de-
ferred maintenance needs just aren’t 
possible to resolve through the annual 
appropriations process despite the con-
siderable best efforts we have made. 
The longer they last, the more they 
jeopardize the visitors’ ability to safely 
enjoy our national treasures. 
In Alaska, the National Park Service 
has $106 million in deferred mainte-
nance. When you think about what I 
just outlined to you in terms of the 
number of acres we have in Federal 
land and parks and BLM refuge, $106 
million out of $12 billion doesn’t seem 
like that much. It is a lot to us back 
home, and $33 million of that is consid-
ered critical. 
Within Denali National Park we have 
a pretty significant visitor center, the 
Eielson Visitor Center, and the roof 
and the furnaces in various buildings 
need to be replaced there. We have a 
water 
treatment 
center 
at 
the 
Wrangell-St. Elias headquarters that 
need to be replaced. I think it is impor-
tant for people to realize because those 
are not things you are going to notice. 
You are not going to notice that the 
road is in disrepair or you don’t have 
restroom facilities, but when you are 
going into the park toward the end of 
the summer—in early September—and 
there is no heat in the visitor center, 
you are probably going to notice that. 
I think it is important to recognize 
that the current list of deferred main-
tenance does not account for some of 
the very major challenges we are fac-
ing in Alaska, such as the situation 
with the Denali route. It is the only 
route in and out of the park. It needs 
substantial improvements due to ongo-
ing subsidence. The estimates are all 
over the map, but, in fairness, we are 
talking tens of millions, perhaps in ex-
cess of $100 million, to help repair or to 
perhaps even reroute that access. 
When thinking about deferred main-
tenance in Alaska in the parks, we can 
account for only a fraction of that sys-
tem. Recreation is the biggest user of 
our national forest system lands, but 
our 
forestlands, 
trails, 
and 
camp-
grounds need about $5 billion in re-
pairs. In Alaska, we have about $105 
million in backlog up there. 
BLM manages nearly 50,000 buildings 
and structures—bridges, trails, and 
roads mostly in Western States, but 
they also have a growing backlog. In 
total in the Department of the Inte-
rior, we have about $17.3 billion in de-
ferred maintenance in fiscal year 2019. 
When combining that with the Forest 
Service, their maintenance backlog is 
$22.5 billion in our Federal land man-
agement agencies. 
The Great American Outdoors Act is 
attempting to remedy the issue by pro-
viding a downpayment to upgrade and 
to improve the aging infrastructure on 
our public lands. I kind of outlined the 
need for why we are here today. I indi-
cated that I support funding to address 
the 
maintenance 
backlogs, 
making 
sure visitors are able to enjoy our land-
scapes and have the safest, most enjoy-
able experience as they see America’s 
beauty. That is important. I think it is 
also important that we are cognizant 
about how we pay for this mainte-
nance, how we address that. 
As I mentioned, I am on the Appro-
priations Committee. We are trying to 
get ahead of this by making sure we 
are not seeking to add more to the ac-
count without making sure we are car-
ing for the lands already under our ju-
risdiction. 
The second part of the Great Amer-
ican Outdoors Act focuses on the Land 
and Water Conservation Fund. LWCF 
provides for both Federal and land ac-
quisition and financial assistance for 
States’ recreation development. You

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2798 
June 9, 2020 
will hear me talk a lot about LWCF 
stateside programs because I think it 
recognizes the role that States play in 
facilitating recreational access and 
leverages funds to build out those op-
portunities. 
We have certainly seen the benefits 
in Alaska. Providing a few local exam-
ples, the State of Alaska has used 
LWCF matching funds to build ball-
fields in Utqiagvik, an accessible urban 
playground in Anchorage, and a ski 
area in Cordova. 
I do think it is important for us to 
remember how LWCF was established, 
the core purpose of why it came about 
in the first place. Congress established 
this program in 1965 to build a national 
recreation system primarily in the 
East. To accomplish that, the Federal 
Government determined that it needed 
the ability to acquire this private land. 
So our predecessors provided LWCF 
with the authority and financial means 
to do so through revenues from off-
shore oil and gas. 
We had a lot of discussion in the En-
ergy and Natural Resources Committee 
about the Land and Water Conserva-
tion Fund. I was a proud sponsor of last 
year’s lands package, which made per-
manent the collection and deposit pro-
visions in the LWCF and put an end to 
years of uncertainty and lapses in 
those deposits. I was pleased to be able 
to help offer a series of commonsense 
reforms, which included a requirement 
that at least 40 percent of the funding 
go to stateside programs every year. 
I also believe that LWCF’s ability to 
acquire new Federal lands should be fo-
cused on the eastern States where the 
proportion is dramatically lowered. I 
also believe that it is better—much 
better—to decide LWCF’s funding in 
the appropriations process each year in 
the context of the rest of our Nation’s 
conservation and budgetary priorities, 
as opposed to mandatory funding. 
I have stated that we should have an 
opportunity to discuss these priorities 
related to our obligations to our parks 
and to our conservation efforts. Again, 
I believe it is only fair and honest, as 
we debate this subject, that we recog-
nize there are areas where we can im-
prove this bill. 
I come to this debate from a very 
constructive place. I think I have some 
very commonsense ideas to expand the 
bill to include conservation-related pri-
orities that make sense for Alaska and 
our States across the country, prior-
ities such as offshore revenue, which I 
am going to be speaking to in just a 
moment. There are some pretty simple, 
commonsense things; for example, if 
we are going to allow for deferred 
maintenance to be addressed within 
the LWCF account, why would we not 
want to make sure that our States 
have a similar flexibility? 
In States like Alaska, where we have 
significant Federal lands already, it is 
not that we need to be buying up addi-
tional lands into the Federal account 
in Alaska, but what we do need is to 
help preserve those lands we have now 
but that are subject to aggressive ero-
sion. To be able to use funds from the 
LWCF account to deal with a coastal 
resilience initiative is something my 
colleague from Louisiana and my col-
league from Rhode Island—we have 
been talking about how we can help 
improve that. 
I think these discussions are not only 
timely but smart policy. I think it 
would be unfortunate if the Senate 
chooses not to allow good ideas to be 
incorporated. 
We have a measure in front of us that 
has strong bipartisan support. We rec-
ognize that, and that is good at a time 
when we are trying to come together as 
a Congress and as a nation. I take 
great pride in the fact that, once again, 
leadership turns to the Energy and 
Natural Resources Committee for good 
ideas that have come out of our com-
mittee. The opportunity to include 
strong measures that will enhance this 
bill is something I think we need to be 
focusing on. 
I would like to address the amend-
ment that my colleague from Lou-
isiana, Senator CASSIDY, has filed and 
that I am cosponsoring. This is an ini-
tiative that he has worked on, and he 
has explained that it is a matter of eq-
uity. It is a matter of equity and fair-
ness as to how revenues are shared 
with the coastal States that enable off-
shore energy development. 
Adding key portions of the COASTAL 
Act, S. 2418—which I am proud to co-
sponsor and was reported out of the En-
ergy 
and 
Natural 
Resources 
Com-
mittee—to the measure we have in 
front of us, I think, makes sense. Sen-
ator CASSIDY has spoken to how this 
would expand offshore revenue sharing 
for States along the Gulf of Mexico, 
which post and support some of the 
most impressive and expensive coastal 
facilities anywhere in the world. If any 
of our colleagues have not had the op-
portunity to view what happens in the 
offshore areas of Louisiana, it is a trip 
that should be a priority. 
Senator CASSIDY has spoken to the 
Gulf of Mexico piece of it. I want to 
speak to what the amendment would 
do for Alaska because it includes provi-
sions that have been written by myself 
and by Senator SULLIVAN to establish a 
revenue-sharing program specific to 
our State, which has prolific offshore 
resources that we hope, one day, to be 
able to safely produce for the good of 
the Nation. But we are in a very, very 
different position than they are in the 
Gulf. We need investment to improve 
our coastal infrastructure, particularly 
in the Arctic. We have some different 
conservation priorities from some non-
coastal States, which are enshrined in 
the purposes of the language in the 
amendment. 
These principles of equity and fair-
ness that we talk about as they relate 
to the Gulf of Mexico are the same 
principles here. 
Just like from onshore Federal devel-
opment, local governments and com-
munities need to share in the revenues 
from offshore development. We are the 
ones that host it, we bear the impacts, 
and the benefits the entire country de-
rives from it simply wouldn’t be pos-
sible were it not for these host States. 
I think that this bill, this Great 
American Outdoors Act, is the right 
place to address offshore revenue shar-
ing because everything within it relies 
on oil and gas revenues and LWCF, the 
fund that will help with our deferred 
maintenance. Everything relies on oil 
and gas revenues. 
So, for as much vitriol as there may 
be out there, and criticism, as the in-
dustry takes, I think this might be a 
good time to recognize that oil and gas 
production generates Federal revenues, 
and it is these Federal revenues that 
fund these conservation priorities for 
dozens and dozens of Members on this 
floor and for hundreds of stakeholder 
groups. 
Again, that is what has been hap-
pening within the LWCF, and it is 
about to be true for the deferred main-
tenance backlog, that where you are 
getting this funding source is from the 
oil and gas revenues. Those funds 
wouldn’t come were it not for places 
like Louisiana, the Gulf Coast States, 
and again, hopefully, one day, Alaska. 
When it comes to offshore revenue 
sharing, Alaska faces a disparity not 
only with onshore rates but with other 
coastal producers. So you have got the 
four 
Gulf 
States—Alabama, 
Mis-
sissippi, Louisiana, and Texas—that 
currently have a limited revenue shar-
ing program established by the Gulf of 
Mexico Energy Security Act of 2006. 
Alaska, however, receives no revenue 
sharing, zero revenue sharing beyond 
the near-shore areas that all coastal 
States receive under section 8(g) of the 
Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act. 
If Alaska is granted offshore revenue 
sharing, know that we will put it to 
productive use for conservation and en-
vironmental purposes. I think it is in-
structive because I think there is so 
much rhetoric and concern that we 
can’t be doing further development in 
Alaska. It just shouldn’t happen. Well, 
let me share with you, again, we are 
seeing coastal impact. We are seeing 
levels of erosion. We would like to be 
able to address the expenses that are 
associated with it. 
So within the amendment that Sen-
ator CASSIDY has filed, in the Alaska 
provision, we looked specifically to au-
thorize purposes—coastal protection, 
conservation, restoration, and assist-
ance, including relocation for commu-
nities that are directly affected by 
coastal erosion, melting permafrost, 
and climate change related lawsuits. 
Another authorized use is mitigation 
of damage to fish, wildlife, and natural 
resources. Adaptation planning, vul-
nerability assessments, emergency pre-
paredness to build healthy and resil-
ient communities, and the installation 
and operation of energy systems to re-
duce energy costs and greenhouse emis-
sions, and then programs at institu-
tions of higher education, these are the

primary 
prescriptions 
that 
Alaska 
would use its shared revenues for. 
If you support the Great American 
Outdoors Act, you will be able to sup-
port offshore revenue sharing and the 
significant environmental benefits that 
it would provide to the Gulf of Mexico 
and to the State of Alaska, but we can 
only get there if we have an oppor-
tunity for the good ideas—substantive 
ideas—that Senator CASSIDY is leading 
with his COASTAL Act that I have in-
troduced with regards to concerns that 
I briefly outlined and that I know that 
other Members have raised and shared 
as well. 
I appreciate the support that we have 
received for offshore revenue sharing 
within the committee process itself. 
We are now asking for the full Senate 
to support the coastal States in equi-
table sharing of revenues. I think this 
is a key step, and I would urge that we 
have an opportunity to adopt that as 
we move forward. 
With that, I yield to my friend, the 
Senator from Louisiana. I thank him 
for his leadership on this initiative. I 
have been so impressed not only by his 
advocacy when it comes to addressing 
the fairness and the equity issues that 
are associated with revenue sharing 
and what we need to do to lift the cap, 
but also to his commitment to ensure 
that his State and other coastal States 
that are seeing impact from climate 
change and seeing impact from erosion, 
that the conservation purposes that we 
have spoken to will have an oppor-
tunity to be addressed. I am thankful 
to be able to work with him and to fol-
low his lead on this. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Louisiana. 
Mr. 
CASSIDY. 
Madam 
President, 
first, I thank the Energy Committee 
chair for her kind words and for her ad-
vocacy. I may be speaking for a bit, 
and then when the majority leader 
comes, I will interrupt and allow him 
to close, and then I ask unanimous 
consent to finish my speaking, if that 
is OK. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
Mr. CASSIDY. Madam President, I 
am on the Senate floor today to talk 
about the protection and restoration of 
the Gulf Coast, an issue extremely im-
portant to those I serve in Louisiana in 
the Gulf Coast, but important to the 
rest of the Nation, whether the rest of 
the Nation knows it or not. I will ex-
plain why that is. 
In the coming days, the Senate will 
vote on whether or not to pass the 
Great American Outdoors Act. This bill 
dedicates funding over 5 years towards 
deferred maintenance. We have spoken 
about it at length. It adds an addi-
tional $900 million to the Land and 
Water Conservation Fund, an amount 
which is already authorized but never 
funded. This would make it mandatory 
that it is funded. 
Many will say that this is a good 
thing or even a great thing. I will tell 
you, for Louisiana, for the Gulf Coast, 
and for a lot of other States, this is not 
a great thing in its current form. In 
fact, I will show how this bill currently 
benefits only certain States at the ex-
pense of others. 
First, it is almost entirely funded 
with money from the Gulf of Mexico oil 
and gas production. So 50 to 60 percent 
of the dollars go to five States. So we 
are going to put up about $9.5 billion, 
and 50 to 60 percent of it goes to five 
States. Needless to say, that lacks eq-
uity. I would argue that we can make 
this bill better in terms of benefiting 
many more Americans than it cur-
rently does. 
First, let’s speak about where the 
revenue comes from. Again, about $1.9 
billion a year comes from energy pro-
duction, redistributing that across the 
country, as we mentioned, to deferred 
maintenance programs. About 90 per-
cent of that revenue from which this 
money will be extracted comes from oil 
and gas production in the Gulf of Mex-
ico. This will be about $4.3 billion com-
ing from the Gulf of Mexico. Now, this 
makes the Gulf of Mexico the primary 
revenue source for this whole project. 
It adds $900 million to what is already 
designated the Land and Water Con-
servation Fund. There is $1.9 billion a 
year for 5 years to go for deferred 
maintenance, and this is in addition to 
$125 million a year, which is currently 
being spent on the Land and Water 
Conservation Fund. 
Now, some of the advocates, by the 
way, just for a point of clarity, will say 
or imply that these dollars are not oth-
erwise allocated. Let’s just be clear. 
The dollars are allocated. Right now, 
the dollars that will be used for this 
fund come to the U.S. Treasury and are 
used for the priorities of the American 
people, and they are allocated for, you 
name it, higher education, debt service, 
paying troops, defense, et cetera. This 
would make it mandatory that a cer-
tain amount of this money would go 
towards both deferred maintenance and 
the Land and Water Conservation 
Fund. 
Now, the Land and Water Conserva-
tion Fund is supposed to be a fund that 
functions to benefit, kind of, all Ameri-
cans, but I would argue that it really 
benefits select regions of America. If 
you look at this map, where the dollars 
are spent are not where the people live. 
These are the coastal States, and here 
are the inland States. As it turns out, 
the areas that are most benefited by 
this funding are not on the coast. And, 
yet, as you will see in a second, that is 
where the people live. 
If you live in a coastal State, on a 
per capita basis, your State receives 
about $7.53 per person. If you live in 
one of these inland States, from the 
Land and Water Conservation Fund, 
you get $17.66, more than two times 
plus. In fact, from about 2011 to 2015, if 
you are in one of these inland States, 
you got a ratio of almost 8-to-1 in 
terms of the dollars spent in the coast-
al States. If you take out Washington, 
DC, and Virginia and maybe New York, 
then this $7.53 is going to go far lower. 
If you are not one of those three States 
and you are on the coast, you are not 
doing very well on a per capita basis. 
To make that point, in 2015, about 40 
percent of the Nation’s population 
lived in a county or parish that was di-
rectly on a coastline, and 82 percent of 
people live in a State which has a 
coastline. So 82 percent of the people 
live in one of these yellow States, and 
yet, on a per capita basis, two plus 
times is spent on those living in States 
which are inland. 
Now, my point is that the dollars are 
not spent relative to where people live. 
This disparity disproportionately im-
pacts States such as South Carolina, 
Georgia, North Carolina, Maine, and 
other coastal States. Now, I am a per-
son who would rather have a solution, 
and the solution I am going to propose 
does not take money away from the 
Great American Outdoors Act. They 
will still continue to receive, in rel-
atively sparsely populated States, a 
significant sum of the money. 
I worked with Senator WHITEHOUSE 
on a bipartisan solution that would at 
least add some equity for those States 
which are coastline, as opposed to 
being inland. Now, that said, we ac-
knowledge national parks have de-
ferred maintenance. At the end of fis-
cal year 2018, this was estimated at 
roughly $12 billion, but those parks are 
not uniformly distributed. 
I mentioned earlier how a dispropor-
tionate amount of the money is going 
to go to five different States. Accord-
ing to the Park Service data, if you 
just looked at deferred maintenance, 
which will presumably guide where this 
money 
is 
spent, 
California; 
Wash-
ington, DC; Virginia; New York; North 
Carolina; Wyoming; Arizona; and the 
State of Washington make up nearly 60 
percent of the deferred maintenance 
needs at national parks. If you live in 
one of those States, you are doing well, 
but if you are living in a State other 
than those, not so well. 
Now, some will say that even though 
almost 60 percent of the money is going 
to seven States, everyone in the coun-
try benefits because you might visit 
the park, or we are all in it together, 
so why shouldn’t I support a national 
park in a State which is far away from 
my hometown? 
I suppose there is something to be 
said to that. On the other hand, if the 
person saying that lived in one of the 
States, which is getting just a tiny 
fraction of the total sum of dollars, 
and, yes, the people in their State will 
leave their State and go spend their 
money in Montana, for example, that 
will be great. People in Montana, on a 
per capita basis, get far more than any-
body else. 
We are in it together, I suppose, but 
you probably wouldn’t reverse it. You 
probably wouldn’t say: Wait a second, 
we think it is unfair that seven States 
get almost 60 percent of the dollars. We 
actually think it is better to be more

equitably spread, or maybe you would. 
I hope that you would. 
States like Kansas, Iowa, and Ne-
braska see almost no benefit. Collec-
tively, the deferred maintenance in 
these three States—Kansas, Iowa, and 
Nebraska—is .2 percent of total de-
ferred maintenance backlog. It is the 
same for Connecticut, Delaware, Min-
nesota, and New Hampshire. Again, 
while there is deferred maintenance in 
Gulf Coast States, the real benefit to 
our States is investing in the coastline, 
which has a direct impact on sustain-
ability. 
To be fair, by the way, the Gulf of 
Mexico States do currently benefit. 
The Gulf of Mexico Energy Security 
Act shares revenue with the four Gulf 
Coast States. We use this revenue, by 
State constitution, for coastal restora-
tion. There is a little bit of irony, as 
the Senator from Alaska pointed out, 
that those who strongly support this 
bill oftentimes strongly disapprove of 
drilling for oil and gas, particularly in 
coastal areas, but they are now reliant 
upon that drilling in order to fund the 
Great American Outdoors Act. 
I do believe that we can address this 
inequity, which has been highlighted. I 
put together a bill, as I mentioned ear-
lier, with SHELDON WHITEHOUSE, called 
the COASTAL Act. We are working 
with other colleagues. We passed it out 
of the Energy Committee. 
Actually, by that, Senator WHITE-
HOUSE was not on that bill, but we 
passed the COASTAL Act out of the 
Energy Committee with a bipartisan 
vote. The junior Senator from Alabama 
is my cosponsor. He should cosponsor, 
and he did. Alabama benefits exponen-
tially more from the GOMESA Act 
than anything that the Great Amer-
ican Outdoors Act has to offer. 
So all of this is to say that the Gulf 
Coast just wants equity. We want a 
more general benefit, not almost 60 
percent of the benefit, going to seven 
States, and we also want the money to 
be distributed nationwide where people 
live, as opposed to where they might go 
on a 1-week vacation every 5 years. 
I will speak just very briefly about 
the COASTAL Act. It is a bipartisan 
bill, again, passed by the Senate En-
ergy Committee, committing more dol-
lars towards environmental protection, 
reducing flood risks to businesses and 
industries along the Gulf Coast, pro-
tecting regions of the Gulf Coast for 
public 
recreation—we 
talked 
about 
recreation elsewhere. But committing 
dollars for all coastal States for envi-
ronmental protection, once more, does 
not take money away from the Great 
American Outdoors Act. 
Colleagues have heard me talk about 
the importance of revenue sharing for 
environmental protection. Again, the 
COASTAL Act passed out with bipar-
tisan support, and its goals are con-
sistent with the Great American Out-
doors Act. By the way, the recent flood 
event 
in 
Louisiana—crystal 
ball— 
flooded homes in Mandeville and prop-
erty in Grand Isle. If we have flooding 
now, this bill would help prevent that 
flooding. 
The COASTAL Act also places mil-
lions of dollars in a coastal fund, which 
benefits all coastal States, including 
those along the Great Lakes, putting 
money to protect where people live. 
Once more, let me just show this. 
This is where people live, and 82 per-
cent of the people live in a State with 
a coastline. Yet, where the money is 
going is, yes, to the coast, if you con-
sider Washington, DC, and Virginia the 
coastline, but typically, it is going to 
five or six places, not to the places 
which have had the most flood events. 
I walked around barrier islands in 
Georgia. Those barrier islands are 
evaporating. I hear that barrier islands 
in South Carolina are similarly under 
great duress. In Louisiana, as I already 
mentioned, we just had a flood event 
this past week. The COASTAL Act 
would put money for resiliency in 
States where 82 percent of the popu-
lation lives. I just don’t understand 
what is the objection to spending 
money to protect where people live. 
Why must we only do something nice 
for places where people vacation. If you 
put it to a referendum, people would 
first take care of their homes, and then 
they would take care of the place 
where they vacation. 
I am not saying, by the way, don’t 
take care of where they vacation, but I 
am saying we should at least give some 
dollars to where people live. Now, I will 
quote a statistic once more: 42 percent 
of Americans live in a parish or county 
that is directly on a shoreline. Why 
don’t we do something to protect that 
shoreline where 42 percent of Ameri-
cans live, not taking any dollars away 
from those sparsely populated places 
where people vacation? 
By the way, when the COASTAL Act 
passed the Energy Committee, environ-
mental groups such as the Energy De-
fense Fund, the National Wildlife Fed-
eration, Audubon Society, and Lou-
isiana-based organizations such as the 
Lake Pontchartrain Basin Foundation 
and the Coalition to Restore Coastal 
Louisiana signed a letter saying: 
As we move to address the significant land, 
water, and wildlife conservation funding 
needs in our Nation, it is important that our 
coastlines are also equipped to confront the 
unique challenges that climate change pre-
sents. GOMESA has been a critically impor-
tant funding stream for Louisiana and other 
Gulf Coast States, and expanding upon this 
success will protect national economic as-
sets, 
providing 
better 
protection 
from 
storms, and enhance coastal habitat. 
Now, bill sponsors will, rightly, say 
that the Great American Outdoors Act 
does not impact revenues flowing to 
GOMESA States, but—let’s face it—it 
does cannibalize these dollars in Lou-
isiana, so sooner or later you run out of 
money. 
So if we are going to take all these 
dollars that could be spent elsewhere 
and put in these sparsely populated 
States where people vacation but not 
spend it in States where people actu-
ally live, not spend it in counties where 
42 percent of the people live, which are 
directly upon a coastline, sooner or 
later you run out of money. And we are 
going to—just like a vacuum cleaner— 
suck those dollars down to these 
sparsely populated areas where people 
love to vacation. 
So my point is that, in Louisiana, for 
example, we have a $50 billion, 50-year 
master plan to protect our coastline, 
reducing flood risk to communities and 
assets so important to the rest of the 
Nation. The Great American Outdoors 
Act will make it more difficult to se-
cure future dollars for this gulf coast 
restoration. 
Now, as I mentioned before, a lot of 
people live in coastline communities, 
in counties and parishes, and from 2000 
to 2016, the Gulf of Mexico region grew 
by almost 25 percent, more than any 
other coastline region. 
Harris County, TX, and areas in Flor-
ida and New York also accounted for 
substantial growth along our Nation’s 
coast. The proposal I filed commits 
dollars to these coastal States so that 
they can have a sustainable revenue 
stream now and in the future for need-
ed investments. 
If you asked the people in New York, 
after Hurricane Sandy, if they would 
like to have dollars in New York to 
protect against a future flood event, 
they would say yes. 
Houston and Galveston have really 
borne the brunt of major flood events, 
of hurricanes striking their coastline. 
Do we think that they could use more 
money for coastal resiliency? Yes—as 
well as Lake Charles, LA, after Hurri-
cane Rita, Calcasieu Parish and Cam-
eron Parish. We talked about Lou-
isiana with Hurricane Katrina, the gulf 
coast of Mississippi and Alabama, dev-
astated after Hurricane Katrina. Would 
it be wise, as a nation, to put dollars 
there in order to have coastal resil-
iency to prevent, if you will, more 
flooding in the future so as to actually 
save more relief dollars that might be 
needed? 
There are people, there are regions, 
battling rising sea levels, and I am 
mindful about their concerns and how 
we can address those. 
I am told recently, by the way, that 
the Army Corps of Engineers has pro-
posed a $3.5 billion flood wall for 
Miami. Think about that—$3.5 billion. 
This is in response to rising sea levels. 
But we are passing legislation now in 
which folks refuse to consider spending 
money for coastal resiliency. Instead, 
we are going to spend money on a $3.5 
billion seawall because we don’t want 
to spend the money on other forms of 
coastal resiliency. 
I recently spoke to one of my House 
colleagues, DONNA SHALALA, who rep-
resents the Miami-Dade region, and she 
speaks about the rising sea levels and 
the investments they need to make 
around South Beach. It is something 
touching where people live, not where 
people vacation. I am not sure why we 
emphasize where people vacation over 
where people live.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2801 
June 9, 2020 
To pay for this bill, again, we are 
taking dollars from an area of the 
country greatly impacted by coastal 
erosion, so these gulf funds actually 
play a role in restoring or maintain-
ing— 
You will see a poster later on which 
shows the oil and gas development tak-
ing place off the coast of Louisiana, the 
oil and gas development that funds the 
Great American Outdoors Act. 
Louisiana’s coast is a working coast 
in which people from this working 
coast go out to maintain that source of 
revenue, but look what is happening to 
Louisiana’s predicted land loss. Over 
the next 50 years, in a reasonable sce-
nario, all of this red spot will be lost to 
erosion. 
By the way, look what happens to 
New Orleans. It is now directly along 
the Gulf of Mexico. The next hurricane 
comes, and there goes the port struc-
ture. There goes the ability for people 
in the Midwest to get their grains to 
the international market and the abil-
ity of this working coast to support the 
oil and gas drilling and, therefore, to 
support the source of revenue required 
and relied upon by the Great American 
Outdoors Act. It will be lost. 
It is not just me saying it. Of course, 
I am the Senator. I love my State. I am 
going to do whatever I can. You may 
not believe me, but on the other hand, 
the State’s land loss has been high-
lighted in countless feature stories, in-
cluding in the New York Times and Na-
tional Geographic, to name two. 
By the way, Google Maps can’t keep 
up. When looking at the Louisiana 
coastline, Google Maps will show an 
area with land that has now been re-
placed with open water. Louisiana 
loses about, oh, a football field of land, 
I think it is, an hour. Whenever I say 
it, I can’t believe it, it is so fast. It is 
so rapid. So not only does this pose a 
risk to the energy assets, a risk to 
communities, and a risk to port assets; 
it poses a risk to our national liveli-
hood. 
Now, folks in Louisiana are going to 
look at this and say: How is the Great 
American Outdoors Act going to help 
us? We are going to work to produce all 
this oil and gas, and we are not going 
to get any of the benefits. 
Senator KENNEDY and I recently had 
a call with more than 20 Louisiana par-
ish presidents. They are, very under-
standably, concerned about the lack of 
equity. 
‘‘Concerned’’ 
is 
diplomatic. 
‘‘Ticked off’’ is how better to describe 
it. 
I had another call with close to 100 
businesses. They, too, are pleading for 
equitable treatment along the gulf. 
So when I speak about the Great 
American Outdoors Act cannibalizing 
dollars from the Gulf of Mexico to 
spend money in places where people 
don’t live as opposed to protecting my 
coastline, which, in turn, ensures that 
we can continue to have the source of 
revenue—but also coastlines around 
the Nation in counties and parishes 
where people actually live as opposed 
to going to places where people only 
visit—I am trying to make a case for 
those people. 
Will you show the energy assets. 
I have been speaking about these en-
ergy assets that are required. It is one 
thing to say it; it is another thing to 
look at it. All of these are part of the 
gulf coast energy infrastructure that 
the rest of our Nation relies upon. 
I am a doctor. I think like this. If 
you saw a map of the Nation, you 
would see pipelines coming out of this 
region across the rest of the Nation, 
and in my mind, as a doctor, I think of 
this as being a heart. If we need energy 
to fuel our lives, the heart is right 
here, and it beats here. The aorta, if 
you will, the pipelines that flow out, 
taking gasoline to Philadelphia, taking 
natural gas to another part of our 
country, taking the refined fuel prod-
ucts to Atlanta, GA, in the case of jet 
fuel—you name it, they come out of 
this area. 
If this area cannot be sustained, we 
cannot sustain that part of our energy 
economy. We will not have jet flights 
to Hawaii or jet flights from Atlanta 
around the world, as the hub, or for 
New Orleans, people coming in for 
Mardi Gras, Jazz Fest, or to Breaux 
Bridge for a crawfish festival. It will 
not happen because this pipeline struc-
ture cannot be sustained with a coast-
line which is eroding. 
Some of these—let me just speak— 
are oil import sites, natural gas mar-
ket centers, processing facilities, lique-
fied natural gas export facilities, stra-
tegic petroleum reserve, major work-
ing ports, such as Port Fourchon. I 
could go on. These assets and compa-
nies then employ hundreds of thou-
sands of men and women contributing 
billions of dollars in government reve-
nues with an even greater impact on 
our annual GDP. 
This is what powers our country. 
This is where the revenue is coming 
from for the Great American Outdoors 
Act. This revenue stream will not be 
sustainable if we don’t at least have 
some consideration of how to restore 
this. 
The Senator from Ohio had spoken 
about a leaky roof and the leaky roof 
increased its leak and now all those as-
sets are being damaged within a park. 
That is great. People like to visit 
parks, and we should take care of leaky 
roofs. I am more concerned about a 
coastline that is dissolving, and, as it 
dissolves, you lose the energy infra-
structure, which is required to pay for 
that park building to be fixed. 
I will also point out the flooding risk 
for the folks in my State. Again, I 
spoke about the communities at risk. 
This is predicted future flooding from a 
100-year flood event, without action. 
Let’s just say, if it is colored, it is bad, 
where you are going to get 0.5 to 5 feet 
of water north of New Orleans. 
If you want to speak about some-
thing that should be done now to pre-
vent future problems, I have bigger 
issues than a leaky roof in a park 
building. I have entire communities 
washed away into the ocean, at risk for 
great flooding. I am speaking of New 
Orleans. I could be speaking of Miami, 
of Houston, of New York. 
Why don’t we spend money where 
people live as opposed to spending it 
only where people vacation? 
Now, you might be sitting in Iowa or 
Kansas or Nebraska thinking: Well, I 
am only getting 0.2 percent of this 
money. I am not getting any benefit 
whatsoever, but why does it matter to 
me to have a coastline? Why does it 
matter to me at all? 
Well, let’s look at how investing in 
the coast impacts our Nation economi-
cally. Let’s look at what happened 
after Hurricane Katrina. After Hurri-
cane Katrina, the flooding took out the 
port structure in South Louisiana; 
therefore, the in place for all the goods 
coming from the Ohio, Missouri, Mis-
sissippi, and other rivers for export to 
the rest of the world—the rest of the 
United States—was terribly impacted. 
If you look at this—if we have a lack of 
coastal investment—corn exports were 
down 
23 
percent 
post-Hurricane 
Katrina; barley, down 100 percent; 
wheat, down 54 percent; soy, down 25 
percent; total grain exports, down 24 
percent after Hurricane Katrina. 
If that port system in South Lou-
isiana and in the lower Calcasieu River 
in Houston is damaged by flooding— 
that is going to happen under current 
scenarios—then our midwestern farm-
ers are not able to ship to inter-
national markets. Their livelihood is 
damaged. 
In moving goods across our country 
for export, one coalition committed to 
ensuring future navigation on the Mis-
sissippi said that the lower Mississippi 
has an estimated annual impact of $735 
billion to the Nation’s economy and is 
responsible for 2.4 million jobs. That 
starts with being able to navigate 
goods through the various locks and 
port complexes near the mouth of the 
river. 
The USDA recognizes this. It says in 
a report on the importance of inland 
waterways that farm products are 14 
percent of total commodities moved 
along inland waterways. Further, proc-
essed flour, animal feed, milled grain 
products, and fertilizers add another 5 
percent to agricultural related prod-
ucts. 
It is important to remember, the 
Mississippi River Valley encompasses 
almost 60 percent of our country, so 
many major rivers connect with the 
Mississippi to deliver those products 
around the world. If we are going to 
have a port system that is going to 
take those goods and allow them to be 
transported around the world, it has to 
be a sustained, reinforced coastline. 
In my State, we have some of the 
largest barge and container ports in 
the country. The Port of South Lou-
isiana is the largest grain exporter in 
the country. The Port of Baton Rouge 
is home to the largest grain operator in 
the State. Ports farther to the south in

Mobile and Texas are, likewise, impor-
tant. 
If we are going to have rising sea lev-
els and spend all of our money on the 
inland areas—not where people live but 
where people visit on vacation—as op-
posed to the coastlines, which have the 
ports that sustain where people live 
and sustain the vitality of those in the 
heartland, we are being foolish with 
our public policy. 
The same USDA report highlighted 
the consequences of an inadequate in-
frastructure along the waterways, say-
ing 
that 
inadequate 
infrastructure 
leads to reduced transportation capac-
ity, raising shipping rates, meaning 
less income to the farmers who are 
shipping—which reduces U.S. economic 
activity—and a loss of global competi-
tiveness. 
I could go on. I will just say that as-
sociated industries impacted by the 
Iowa grain exports support business 
from agriculture, forestry, real estate, 
restaurants, and pesticides, to name a 
few. This is just in Iowa. 
The ports in the gulf coast support 
those folks in Iowa, and we should sup-
port the ports. We should support the 
ports, which support Iowa. 
To summarize, my colleagues and I 
are fighting for fairness and equity. 
That is what this is about. I have high-
lighted obvious inequities both in how 
the gulf region is treated and how 
other 
States 
are 
treated—spending 
money not where people live but where 
people visit. 
I am pointing out the consequences 
to midwestern farmers. They don’t ben-
efit very much at all—if you live in 
Iowa, Kansas, or Nebraska—from the 
Great American Outdoors Act, but they 
would benefit from a sustainable port 
system, which means that those ports 
they rely upon to ship goods around 
the world will be there even as sea lev-
els rise. 
Now, I am all for, by the way, taking 
care of deferred maintenance in parks, 
but I think, in the relative hierarchy of 
what we should do, we should take care 
of where people live. And I will repeat 
once more: 42 percent of the people live 
in a parish or county that is directly 
on a coastline; 82 percent of Americans 
live in a coastal State. That is not 
where the bulk of these dollars are 
spent. 
We have a bipartisan group of Sen-
ators supporting; we have environ-
mentally focused groups supporting as 
well, and what they are supporting is 
an amendment which would actually 
help create this equity that would 
allow dollars to be put into a fund to 
help 
coastal 
States—where 
people 
live—but would be part of a bill to take 
care of where people visit. 
I wish it were the other way around, 
but those are not the priorities of the 
people who are promoting the Great 
American Outdoors Act. 
I thank you for this time. 
I yield the floor. 
MORNING BUSINESS 
TRIBUTE TO DOREEN KRAFT 
Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, the 
last few months have presented an un-
precedented challenge for communities 
and families across the country, and 
Vermont is no different. It is refreshing 
to take a moment to celebrate the peo-
ple and entities that are at the founda-
tion of our community identities. I 
want to take a moment to recognize 
one of these people in Vermont—Do-
reen Kraft—who was profiled in March 
for her leadership of Burlington City 
Arts. 
For the past 25 years, Doreen has 
been the director of Burlington City 
Arts—BCA—a Burlington city depart-
ment that promotes Vermont artists 
while supporting art exhibition, cre-
ation, and education. Doreen is an inte-
gral member of the Burlington city 
government and arts community. As 
described by Pat Robbins, the former 
BCA Center board chair, Doreen is 
‘‘overcommitted . . . and always over-
scheduled, but she is a marvelous fund-
raiser. Everybody takes her calls. Ev-
erybody goes to lunch with her.’’ As 
the director of the BCA Center, Doreen 
has raised millions of dollars that have 
helped BCA further the arts in Bur-
lington. Something that I most appre-
ciate about Doreen is that she makes 
the arts accessible for all Vermonters. 
Jacqueline Posley, a BCA board mem-
ber who relocated to our beautiful 
State from Mississippi, put it best by 
saying that Doreen fosters an environ-
ment at BCA that values people most 
for the connections they make in the 
community, rather than ‘‘by the depth 
of their pockets.’’ While she has led the 
BCA Center for 25 years, Doreen’s work 
in Burlington began long before she 
was appointed director. In 1981, as the 
mayor 
of 
Burlington, 
now-Senator 
BERNIE SANDERS made the accessibility 
of the arts a priority, and Doreen be-
came the first paid employee of the 
mayor’s Task Force for the Arts. Do-
reen established a concert series in 
Burlington’s Battery Park and the an-
nual Burlington Discover Jazz Fes-
tival. By 1990, the task force had be-
come a department of the city govern-
ment, renamed Burlington City Arts. 
In 1995, the year Doreen was appointed 
as director, BCA opened its first gal-
lery in the old Firehouse on Church 
Street, Burlington’s main downtown 
area. Since then, the Firehouse Gallery 
and BCA have gained substantial rec-
ognition. With extensive fundraising 
and community investment, BCA ren-
ovated the Firehouse into a full visual 
arts center, renaming the gallery to 
BCA Center in 2011. Since 1995, the gal-
lery has become a hub for visual arts in 
downtown Burlington, helping the city 
to become a destination known for its 
burgeoning arts scene, due in large 
part to Doreen’s work as director. 
Doreen has continued to expand the 
reach of BCA beyond Church Street. 
BCA recently purchased and began the 
renovation of a 9,000-square-foot ware-
house in Burlington’s South End, a 
post-industrial neighborhood with its 
own indigenous art scene. While South 
End artists and businessowners ini-
tially saw the warehouse purchase as 
an encroachment by city government 
on their turf, relations have improved 
as collaboration between BCA and 
South End artists has grown, on issues 
of art promotion and city planning. 
As renovation of the warehouse con-
tinues, I look forward to seeing how 
Doreen and Burlington City Arts can 
continue to give voice to new artists 
and perspectives, promoting not only 
the arts community but also greater 
conversation and cooperation between 
the government and the people it 
serves. With that, as we make decisions 
on how to assist our communities 
through this crisis, we must also re-
member the communities that we rep-
resent, and individuals that make our 
communities so remarkable. I want to 
recognize and thank Doreen Kraft, not 
only for her everlasting support of the 
arts, but as an ardent public servant 
whose efforts highlight the importance 
of community, equality, and accessi-
bility. 
I ask unanimous consent that her 
profile be printed in the RECORD. 
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the 
RECORD, as follows: 
[From Seven Days, Mar. 11, 2020] 
AFTER 40 YEARS AND FIVE MAYORS, DOREEN 
KRAFT STEERS BURLINGTON CITY ARTS INTO 
THE SOUTH END 
(By Margaret Grayson) 
Doreen Kraft doesn’t really want to talk 
about Doreen Kraft. During a recent recep-
tion for new exhibitions at the BCA Center 
on Church Street, she preferred to direct a 
reporter’s attention to everyone else in the 
room: a dedicated board member; Bur-
lington’s supportive mayor; the brilliant di-
rector of another local nonprofit. 
Upstairs in her office, the longtime execu-
tive director of Burlington City Arts praised 
its successive gallery curators and explained 
how willing they had been to do hands-on 
work and volunteer extra time. She talked 
up a waitress at a restaurant that was 
partnering with BCA, who, unacquainted 
with Kraft, recently encouraged her to make 
a donation to the organization. 
Kraft excels at this kind of schmoozing, 
probing and promoting at the same time. 
People describe her as a coach, an advocate, 
a great listener—essentially, who she is to 
other people, as if her role is to reflect the 
best version of everyone around her. It’s an 
approach that has helped her grow BCA— 
through the administrations of five different 
mayors—from a janitor’s closet in the base-
ment of city hall to a municipal department 
charged with fostering public art and cul-
ture. 
Since the organization’s founding in 1980, 
Kraft, 68, has been a driving force. For the 
last 25 years, she’s led BCA as it has created 
galleries and studios, developed art classes 
and summer camps, curated art in public 
spaces, won and distributed grants, and orga-
nized citywide events such as Festival of 
Fools 
and 
Highlight, 
Burlington’s 
New 
Year’s Eve celebration. The city contributes 
a portion of the funds for those cultural ac-
tivities. 
Kraft raises at least half of the rest of the 
money single-handedly. Most recently, she

June 9, 2020 
spearheaded the purchase of a building at 405 
Pine Street that now houses the organiza-
tion’s art studios. Kraft and her team need 
to find $5 million to renovate it. 
‘‘She gets overcommitted. She’s always 
overscheduled. But she’s a marvelous fund-
raiser,’’ said Pat Robins, cofounder of the 
Church Street Marketplace and former BCA 
board chair. ‘‘Everybody takes her calls. Ev-
erybody goes to lunch with her.’’ 
Jacqueline Posley, a recent transplant to 
Vermont by way of the state’s Stay to Stay 
program, joined the BCA board last June. 
She said that in her home state of Mis-
sissippi, she felt the arts were only for people 
with money. At BCA, she said she felt valued 
more for her willingness to make connec-
tions in the community than the depth of 
her pockets. She describes Kraft as an inclu-
sive and unpretentious leader. 
‘‘Doreen will put out the food trays, will 
sweep the floors,’’ Posley said. ‘‘Every job 
that needs to be done, I could see Doreen 
doing it.’’ 
Robins credited BCA’s long-running suc-
cess with Kraft’s ability to take risks and, 
more importantly, pull them off. If this 
story were a documentary, there’d be short 
takes of nearly a dozen Burlington leaders 
all saying the same thing: BCA would not 
exist today without Kraft, despite her at-
tempts to redirect the spotlight. When BCA 
is praised, Kraft’s name is attached. When 
it’s criticized, she is often targeted person-
ally. 
This particular arts job also comes with 
political perils. BCA is an arm of city gov-
ernment and whoever happens to be running 
it, and Kraft is, technically, an annual ap-
pointee of the mayor. She navigates it all 
with a highly developed sense of direction 
and diplomacy. 
‘‘I love to see and engage with people who 
believe that the arts are central to commu-
nity life,’’ Kraft said. ‘‘And if I can be a part 
of that process and move that forward and 
make that more possible and attainable, 
then my heart sings.’’ She’s deeply loyal to 
Burlington: ‘‘I cannot imagine doing this 
anywhere else.’’ 
Working the gallery opening at the BCA 
Center, Kraft noticed immediately when 
Mayor Miro Weinberger walked in. She 
asked her boss if he’d be willing to speak to 
the crowd, then jumped into action to corral 
all the featured artists and curators to start 
speeches before he had to leave, and gave a 
glowing, on-the-spot introduction praising 
Weinberger’s support for BCA. 
It was a calculated move on Kraft’s part, 
honed from decades of experience. But her 
words, delivered in a loud but warm New 
York-accented alto, rang totally authentic. 
GOVERNMENT STARTUP 
When he became mayor of Burlington in 
1981, Bernie Sanders had an agenda. On it 
was a desire to ‘‘make the arts more acces-
sible to all, regardless of social, economic or 
physical constraints.’’ But he faced a power-
ful board of aldermen, known today as the 
Burlington City Council, who stymied his at-
tempts to hire staff and appoint department 
heads. 
So Sanders created the Community and 
Economic Development Office, along with a 
youth office and the Mayor’s Task Force on 
the Arts, to circumvent the board of alder-
men’s control. 
Kraft was appointed to the cultural task 
force and became its first paid employee in 
1983, working out of a closet-size office. Soon 
known as the Mayor’s Arts Council, the 
group started a concert series in Battery 
Park and cofounded the Burlington Discover 
Jazz Festival with the Flynn Center for the 
Performing Arts in 1985. 
In 1990, the Mayor’s Arts Council became 
an official city department, renamed Bur-
lington City Arts. Kraft was on the board at 
the time but didn’t become executive direc-
tor until 1995. Like Fletcher Free Library, 
BCA derived only a portion of its budget 
from taxpayers. Today, it gets 40 percent of 
its $2.2 million operating budget from the 
city and 60 percent from philanthropy and 
outside grants. 
Kraft had the requisite fundraising skills 
to make that arrangement workable. As it 
turned out, she also had a knack for recruit-
ing young talent. 
When Pascal Spengemann came to Bur-
lington in 1995, planning to stay for only a 
few months, he saw BCA’s Firehouse Gallery 
on Church Street and thought it was cool 
that there was art on Burlington’s main 
drag. BCA had converted the ground floor of 
the historic firehouse into a gallery that 
same year. Through the windows, he saw 
makeshift walls and paintings hung with 
fishing line. 
But 
one 
day 
during 
business 
hours, 
Spengemann went by and the space was 
closed. So he went next door to city hall, 
found Kraft, and convinced her to hire him 
to supervise the gallery and keep its doors 
open. 
Spengemann lobbied to take over the cura-
torial duties, and after he put on a well-re-
ceived test-run show, Kraft let him take the 
reins. 
‘‘I was pretty green and looking for some-
thing to do, and she really believed in me,’’ 
Spengemann said. ‘‘I felt really supported by 
her.’’ 
Under his supervision, the Firehouse Gal-
lery began to gain recognition. In 1998, the 
Burlington City Council approved a proposal 
to renovate the old firehouse building into a 
visual arts center, and the newly formed 
BCA Foundation launched its first capital 
campaign. In 2004 the renovation was fin-
ished, and in 2011 it was renamed the BCA 
Center. 
Today, curator Heather Ferrell cites re-
ceiving grants from the Andy Warhol Foun-
dation for the Visual Arts as evidence that 
the BCA Center is respected in the broader 
contemporary art community. Many consid-
erations go into the shows the BCA Center 
puts on throughout the year. Ferrell said 
they aim for various levels of ‘‘accessi-
bility,’’ meaning how much interpretation to 
add so people can understand and enjoy the 
work, and how much to challenge the audi-
ence. 
She also tries to balance showing Vermont 
artists and national artists, and integrating 
the two rather than having a separate gal-
lery for Vermonters as was done in the past. 
For example, local artist Stella Marrs guest- 
curated 
the 
current 
main-floor 
exhibit, 
‘‘Apocalypse Diet,’’ at the BCA Center, fea-
turing Vermont and national artists. 
Sara Katz started working at BCA in 1999, 
but it was after she volunteered to help out 
in Kraft’s garden that she got to know the 
director. The two chatted, pulled weeds and 
began what is now a 20-year working rela-
tionship. 
‘‘She’s curious about people,’’ said Katz, 
who has since become the organization’s as-
sistant director. ‘‘I was just, like, a 22-year- 
old nobody at that time, and she wanted to 
know how I thought.’’ 
Today, Katz is BCA’s behind-the-scenes 
force, making sure administrative tasks are 
handled so Kraft has time to be the face of 
the organization. 
‘‘You know, she’s just this kind of public 
dynamo,’’ Katz said. ‘‘She’s really incredible 
with human relationships. She just under-
stands people in a really intuitive way, so it 
makes a lot of sense for her to be out in the 
world as much as possible.’’ 
FILMMAKER TO RAINMAKER 
Kraft grew up in New Rochelle, N.Y., and 
majored in studio art at the University of 
New Mexico. But, unsure what to do after 
graduation, she fell in with ‘‘a group of 
merry pranksters,’’ she said. Kraft moved to 
a farm in Bethel, VT, as part of the back-to- 
the-land movement. Though she enjoys gar-
dening, she admitted it was a hard year. 
‘‘There was just no question I was not cut 
out to be a farmer,’’ Kraft said. 
She started teaching an art class at a local 
high school and met Robin Lloyd, who was 
teaching in nearby Rochester. Lloyd was 
making films, which Kraft had never done 
before. But they started working together, 
and Lloyd taught her the medium. They both 
moved to Burlington, into the house on 
Maple Street where Lloyd still lives today, 
and Kraft went back to school at the Univer-
sity of Vermont, studying film production in 
the communications department. (She also 
did stints at Nova Scotia College of Art and 
Design and Hampshire College.) 
Kraft and Lloyd were both influenced by 
the work of Maya Deren, an experimental 
filmmaker whose work focused on Haitian 
vodou. In 1973 the two took the first of many 
trips to Haiti, where they made a short film 
about the country’s colorful painted buses. 
Later, Kraft and Lloyd commissioned local 
artists to make paintings that they then 
used in a 20-minute stop-motion animated 
film, called ‘‘Black Dawn,’’ exploring Hai-
tian history. The French government bought 
copies for all of its embassies; Kraft said it’s 
the only movie of hers that has ever made 
money. She and Lloyd founded a production 
company called Green Valley Media in 1974; 
Kraft still sits on the board. 
Kraft also embarked on more personal 
filmmaking projects, including a re-enact-
ment of her mother’s childhood in a convent 
school in Ireland. Kraft called that still-un-
finished work her ‘‘film in a can.’’ She’d like 
to edit it someday, but ‘‘it’s not something 
you can do on a weekend,’’ she noted. ‘‘I 
mean, I would need a sabbatical, and they 
don’t have sabbaticals in the arts.’’ 
In a way, making films helped prepare 
Kraft for her job at BCA. ‘‘In the early days 
. . . I would be petrified of being onstage or, 
you know, introducing concerts at Battery 
Park,’’ she said. ‘‘People would push me out 
there. 
‘‘If you have a camera and a microphone, 
you have an excuse to pretty much ask a lot 
of questions and get to talk to people,’’ Kraft 
said. Still, she added, ‘‘There are days that I 
go an entire day and literally, when I get 
home, I can’t speak. I’m, like, done. I have to 
go through that quiet time, listen to music, 
listen to news, just transition out of the day 
and also reflect.’’ 
Kraft lives in East Charlotte with her hus-
band, artist Marvin Fishman, whom she met 
making films. The couple is thinking of mov-
ing back to Burlington, where Kraft hasn’t 
lived since the 1990s. If they do it, she said, 
she’d actually miss the commute, which 
marks a defined transition between her job 
and her home. 
Kraft doesn’t always achieve work-life bal-
ance. Most recently, she has lost sleep over 
the purchase of the new building on Pine 
Street. A walk through the empty warehouse 
that BCA now owns—9,000 square feet of 
which will be converted into new studio 
space and a community room—reveals just 
what a mammoth task this renovation will 
be. Especially when you factor in BCA’s com-
mitment to making the building net zero in 
energy consumption. Kraft said she hopes to 
get it done in three years. 
She’s already started giving tours of the 
building and reaching out to potential do-
nors. ‘‘She’s very good at establishing the vi-
sion, and she’s very good at then asking for 
people to support it,’’ said Chris Thompson, 
a former BCA Center curator and former ex-
ecutive director of Generator maker space.

‘‘Having done a lot of fundraising myself re-
cently,’’ he added, it taught him that ‘‘you 
have to believe passionately in the mission. 
And if you believe strongly enough in the 
mission, you’re willing to ask anybody for 
anything.’’ 
SOUTH END ‘PLAN’ 
Kraft has often been compared to another 
local woman who built a thriving arts orga-
nization: Andrea Rogers. She was the found-
ing executive director of the Flynn, instru-
mental in transitioning it from a moribund 
movie theater to a restored art-deco per-
forming arts center. Rogers ran the Flynn 
for 29 years before retiring in 2010. 
BCA focused on the visual arts because it 
was underrepresented in Burlington’s arts 
scene. Avoiding duplication of the Flynn’s 
performing arts programming and classes 
was helpful to what Rogers described as a 
‘‘good working relationship’’ with BCA, cit-
ing their collaboration in producing the an-
nual Burlington Discover Jazz Festival. 
‘‘We were both dedicated to our own insti-
tutions,’’ Rogers said. ‘‘There’s no question 
about that. And I think, because we were 
early leaders of our institutions, the both of 
us could be charged with being too protec-
tive of our own kingdoms. I’m sure I was 
considered that, and she probably has been, 
too.’’ 
It’s a diplomatic way of acknowledging 
that Burlington’s arts community has seen 
some turf battles over the years. BCA has 
run into resistance from the artists and busi-
ness owners along the Pine Street corridor— 
later dubbed the South End Arts District— 
who were protective of their neighborhood 
and fiercely opposed to any development 
that might threaten scarce, affordable studio 
space. They rallied behind the South End 
Arts and Business Association, which cre-
ated and still organizes Burlington’s annual 
South End Art Hop. 
Whether or not it was warranted, some be-
lieved that BCA—and, by extension, Kraft— 
wanted to stake a claim in the South End, 
perhaps because of the organization’s city- 
department status. 
That came to a head with planBTV. In 
June 2015, the city released a draft of a plan 
to 
redevelop 
the 
South 
End—the 
postindustrial area of Burlington along Pine 
Street and Flynn Avenue. BCA, with the 
help of a National Endowment for the Arts 
grant, recruited artists to create works that 
would engage the public and solicit com-
ments on the proposed plan. 
But in August, many of those artists be-
came disenchanted with the process and 
didn’t think their voices had been heard. 
They worried that a proposed zoning change 
to allow more housing in the area would dis-
place them, and they believed BCA was 
complicit. 
Amey Radcliffe, one of the artists who re-
ceived funding for a community engagement 
project, put it this way in a recent email to 
Seven Days: ‘‘I don’t necessarily feel that 
the artist/activists that emerged at that 
time were fully heard or fully understood. If 
BCA were less under the purview of the 
Mayor, we might see BCA taking more inde-
pendent stands and actions—less in-step with 
the Mayor’s development agendas for the 
area.’’ 
Signs began to appear around the neigh-
borhood, according to local media reports, 
including ones that read, ‘‘BCA: Will you 
stand with the arts community to preserve 
industrial zoning in the SEAD?’’ At that 
year’s South End Art Hop in September, art-
ists built a temporary cardboard house 
across the street from ArtsRiot that was 
dubbed ‘‘Miroville.’’ 
Kraft was also the subject of some Art Hop 
protest art. One of the buildings in the How-
ard Space—the warren of artist studios at 
Pine and Howard streets—was topped with a 
large sculpture depicting Weinberger holding 
puppet versions of Kraft and the city’s direc-
tor of planning, David White, on strings. 
‘‘I tried to buy it,’’ Kraft said of the art-
work. ‘‘I stood there that night, and I re-
member saying to people, ‘I do get this. I un-
derstand it, you know? I’ll take the criti-
cism.’ But I also felt that BCA was mis-
understood, and our role in that planning.’’ 
Relations 
have 
improved 
since 
then. 
SEABA’s current executive director, Christy 
Mitchell, said she’s excited to have another 
organization with a stake in the South End 
and sees BCA as a potential ally in getting 
new signage and maps pointing tourists to 
Pine Street. Radcliffe said she thought the 
perception of BCA in the area was generally 
positive and that the purchase of the build-
ing on Pine Street could provide new oppor-
tunities for South End artists. 
Steve Conant, owner of Conant Metal & 
Light and the Soda Plant—and an early 
member of SEABA—said he’d been aware of 
a ‘‘turf war’’ between the two organizations, 
though not when he was directly involved. 
‘‘It’s hard to complain about an organization 
that anchors 30,000 square feet of real estate 
and commits it to the arts,’’ Conant said. 
‘‘That’s the biggest risk in the South End: 
the loss of real estate that supports the 
arts.’’ 
BCA’s relationship with the city is a dou-
ble-edged sword. On one hand, it provides the 
organization with a significant portion of its 
budget, covering staff and overhead costs. It 
also provides easy connections with other 
city departments and a larger stake in city 
decision making. On the other hand, the pub-
lic money opens the organization up to criti-
cism about how those funds are used. Dis-
satisfaction with Weinberger generally casts 
a shadow on his appointees. 
Kraft, one of the original members of the 
Sanders administration, has another chal-
lenge: walking a line between the passionate, 
activist tendencies of the community and 
the bureaucratic nature of city government. 
John Franco, once Sanders’ assistant city 
attorney, has represented opponents of the 
Weinberger administration in court; Steve 
Goodkind, another original Sanders ap-
pointee who headed up the Department of 
Public Works, ran against Weinberger in 
2015. Among the original group of Bernie aco-
lytes that former Seven Days columnist 
Peter Freyne called the ‘‘inner circle of 
Sanderistas,’’ Kraft is the only one still on 
the city payroll. 
Lloyd is a longtime peace activist in 
Vermont and said that has led to friendly 
disagreements between her and Kraft. For 
example, BCA’s annual Festival of Fools 
often lands on the August anniversary of the 
bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 
World War II. 
‘‘I said, ‘OK, Doreen, you’re having a Fes-
tival of Fools, but I’m going to walk down 
Church Street with ashes on my head imper-
sonating what happened in Hiroshima many 
years ago,’ ’’ Lloyd described with a laugh. 
Because of their long-standing friendship, 
Lloyd said, she and Kraft can usually work 
out a deal when their interests collide. In the 
case of the Festival of Fools, Lloyd planned 
her demonstration on the waterfront after 
the last festival act had performed there. 
The women agree to disagree on other con-
troversial city projects, too, such as the 
long-planned and much-delayed construction 
of the Champlain Parkway through the 
South End. 
‘‘She’s a very loyal person for what she 
gets involved with,’’ Lloyd said. ‘‘I think 
she’s a vital person for Miro, because she has 
contacts with a lot of people he might not 
have within the arts community and with 
the alternative community.’’ 
Lots of people confide in Kraft. ‘‘Not that 
she gossips,’’ said Lloyd, ‘‘but she could cer-
tainly do a lot of gossiping if she wanted to.’’ 
‘‘I’m just pretty open and honest with peo-
ple,’’ Kraft said. ‘‘Not that we haven’t had 
knock-down, drag-out debate on certain 
issues, you know, but I think people respect 
my role in the city and that you can’t have 
another identity outside of BCA. It’s just not 
possible. I can be active in causes, but I cer-
tainly can’t take sides, because Burlington 
City Arts has to be neutral . . . I don’t think 
I hold back on my opinion; I just use it ap-
propriately.’’ 
Kraft said the BCA board has considered, 
multiple times, whether staying associated 
with the city is the best path forward. 
‘‘We’ve gone through that exercise to sort 
of really look at ourselves at that time and 
to analyze the relationship with the city,’’ 
Kraft said. ‘‘There have been mayors who 
said, ‘You know, it’s a good exercise, because 
are we holding you back from becoming 
something you could be more of if you 
weren’t associated with the city?’ ’’ 
But the answer, Kraft said, is always no— 
the benefits always outweigh the costs. 
BCA’s new Pine Street studio space proves 
her point. 
‘‘We would not exist if it wasn’t for the 
platform of the city,’’ she said. ‘‘Either we 
wouldn’t exist or we’d be a completely inde-
pendent nonprofit that probably would have 
accomplished a quarter of what we’ve accom-
plished today. I think we stand on the shoul-
ders of the city for what we’ve done.’’

RECOGNIZING VOLUNTEERS IN 
MARSHFIELD AND PLAINFIELD 
Mr LEAHY. Madam President, the 
public health and economic crisis that 
has gripped the country since March 
has been a challenge everywhere, and 
Vermont is no different; yet it should 
surprise no one that Vermonters rise to 
the moment. As businesses shuttered 
and Vermonters adhered to our State’s 
stay-at-home orders, a group of 20 or so 
Vermonters stepped up to volunteer to 
bring groceries, medications, or other 
essential items for their neighbors and 
friends in Marshfield and Plainfield. 
The effect was organized by the en-
richment coordinator for Montpelier’s 
public schools, Drew McNaughton, who 
stepped 
up, 
utilizing 
Front 
Porch 
Forum, coordinating a group of volun-
teers to help bring goods to those stay-
ing at home. It is ‘‘a natural thing to 
do,’’ Drew said, and he could not be 
more 
right: 
It 
is 
natural 
for 
Vermonters to step up to help other 
Vermonters. It has always been the 
Vermont way. And it is why together 
we are Vermont strong. 
I ask unanimous consent that an ar-
ticle highlighting this volunteer effort, 
which appeared in the Times Argus in 
March, be printed in the RECORD. 
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the 
RECORD, as follows:

Drew McNaughton is the enrichment coor-
dinator for Montpelier’s public schools. 
Schools across the state have shut down due 
to the virus that causes COVID–19. So 
McNaughton has been working from home. 
While at home he’s decided to help orga-
nize a group of volunteers in the Marshfield 
and Plainfield areas who can go to stores to 
pick up items for those who may not be able. 
‘‘It seemed like the natural thing to do. It 
seems like a natural response for a commu-
nity to take care of the vulnerable popu-
lations,’’ he said. 
Health officials have said those that are 
older, have chronic health conditions or have 
a compromised immune system are most at 
risk from the virus. People are being told to 
stay home as much as they can and to stay 
at least six feet away from others in effort to 
keep the virus from spreading. Some who 
have tested positive for the virus or are 
showing symptoms are being told to stay 
home and self-isolate for 14 days. 
McNaughton has been promoting the effort 
on Front Porch Forum and so far 22 people 
have signed up to volunteer. Those who vol-
unteered have agreed to share their contact 
information with those looking for items to 
be delivered. 
So far he said there’s only been one request 
for delivery: a resident who needed heart 
medication. But McNaughton believes that 
will change the longer this goes on and the 
stricter the isolation requirements during 
the pandemic. 
‘‘There’s going to be more people shel-
tering in place and it’s going to be up to the 
healthy and the young to step up for once. 
The millennials are going to be facing an ac-
tual challenge,’’ he said. 
. . . 
He said one of the hard parts about the 
pandemic is the anxiety people are feeling 
due to the uncertainty of how long this will 
go on with no defined end date. 
‘‘To me, that’s the unnerving part,’’ he 
said. 
To help pass the time, he said he’s been 
doing projects around the house and doing 
things outside. He said he would bet plenty 
of people will have renovation projects com-
pleted by themselves by the time this is all 
over. 
‘‘A lot of amateur carpenters are going to 
emerge,’’ he said.

TRIBUTE TO DWIGHT GARDNER 
Mr. BENNET. Madam President, I 
rise to honor the career of Dwight 
Gardner, who recently announced his 
retirement after providing decades of 
service to the State of Colorado. He 
most recently served on my staff as the 
regional director for southeast Colo-
rado. Dwight has been a tireless advo-
cate for the farmers, ranchers, and 
communities across our State. For dec-
ades, he has worked on behalf of com-
munities throughout the region, from 
Pueblo to Raton Pass on the New Mex-
ico border, and from the headwaters of 
the Arkansas River in Leadville, high 
in the Rockies, to the town of Holly in 
Prowers County. 
Early in his career, Dwight worked 
alongside his brother to support the 
farmers of the Arkansas Valley as a 
cropduster. Living through the era of 
‘‘buy and dry’’ land purchasing to di-
vert water to meet the needs of a grow-
ing Front Range, Dwight understood 
early the value of advocacy for rural 
Colorado. 
In 2000, he was elected to the first of 
two terms as a Crowley County Com-
missioner, and in that role, he was se-
lected as chairman of the Southern 
Colorado Economic Development Dis-
trict to represent the interests of the 
14 counties in the region. In 2007, my 
predecessor, 
Senator 
Ken 
Salazar, 
asked Dwight to join his office. I was 
fortunate that Dwight agreed to con-
tinue his service in my office in 2009. 
Dwight employs a formidable array 
of skills to serve the southeast region 
of 
Colorado 
effectively. 
He 
builds 
strong relationships with people; he 
possesses a deep knowledge and respect 
for the heritage of Colorado; and he 
provides a constant presence when the 
issues demand it. He has engaged in the 
battle for Federal funds to build the 
long-promised Arkansas Valley con-
duit. He was witness to the important 
preservation of our national heritage 
at Camp Amache and Sand Creek. He 
helped shepherd the critical economic 
opportunity represented by the con-
tinuation of the Southwest Chief rail-
road line. 
From local food production to manu-
facturing, from the decommissioning of 
the Pueblo Chemical Depot to estab-
lishing good neighbor relations at Fort 
Carson’s Pinon Canyon Maneuver site, 
Dwight has been a steady presence and 
road warrior as he has advanced the 
common good across hundreds of miles 
of beautiful southern Colorado. 
Going forward, I will miss Dwight’s 
humility, his candor, and his keen un-
derstanding of what it means to be a 
son of rural America, attributes so 
needed as we work our way toward a 
better future. I am comforted to know 
that the next generation, represented 
by his grandsons Noah, Devlan, and 
Gatlan, have the benefit of his guid-
ance. Colorado is grateful for his serv-
ice.

ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS 
TRIBUTE TO KARA FOUR BEAR 
∑ Mr. CRAMER. Madam President, I 
want to congratulate Kara Four Bear, 
the principal at the New Town, ND, 
Middle School, for being one of two 
educators in the Nation to be presented 
with the Presidential Cybersecurity 
Education Award. 
The U.S. Department of Education 
received nominations for 43 educators 
from 23 States for this inaugural 
award. Kara Four Bear’s selection was 
based on her passion for developing dig-
ital literacy and safety skills in her 
students and then helping them make 
real-world connections with what they 
learn. 
She has led her school in establishing 
robust, global, and relevant education 
programs using curriculum provided 
from the National Integrated Edu-
cation Research Center. This cur-
riculum challenges students to put into 
practical use their lessons in topics 
such as cyber ethics and cyber law. 
They start this curriculum as sixth 
graders and continue through middle 
school and high school. Through var-
ious class projects and State, regional, 
and national competitions, they ex-
plore science, technology, engineering, 
and mathmetics and the careers avail-
able in these fields. 
This Presidential Cybersecurity Edu-
cation Award was established on May 
2, 2019, by President Trump’s executive 
order 
on 
America’s 
Cybersecurity 
Workforce. The Department of Edu-
cation was charged with creating this 
award within 1 year and in consulta-
tion with the Deputy Assistant to the 
President for Homeland Security and 
Counterterrorism at the National Se-
curity 
Council 
and 
the 
National 
Science Foundation. 
Because the demand for STEM ca-
reers continues to grow in my State, 
our Nation, and around the world, 
there is a critical need for students to 
excel in these subjects. Because women 
continue to be underrepresented in ca-
reers focusing on computer science and 
cybersecurity, the challenge is even 
greater to encourage girls to develop 
the creative thinking and problem- 
solving skills needed in these careers 
at an early age. 
The New Town students joined young 
North Dakota women from Bismarck, 
Fargo, 
Grand 
Forks, 
West 
Fargo 
Sheyenne, and Williston schools last 
month in the Girls Go CyberStart com-
petition, sponsored by the SANS Insti-
tute. North Dakota had the highest na-
tionwide participation per capita for 
the second year in a row, and I com-
mend all who participated in this com-
petition. 
Inspirational educators like Kara 
Four Bear are leading the way to in-
crease opportunities for North Dakota 
students to prepare for careers in the 
field of cybersecurity. I thank her for 
her passion for cyber education and for 
being an inspiration to what can be 
done to successfully create this level of 
excellence in schools across the Na-
tion.∑

RECOGNIZING GOOD SHEPHERD 
HOUSING AND FAMILY SERVICES 
∑ Mr. KAINE. Madam President, the 
formation, development, growth and 
success of Good Shepherd Housing and 
Family Services, GSH is a story that 
exemplifies the very best in people-to- 
people programs. Started in 1974 as a 
‘‘helping hand’’ volunteer-run organi-
zation by members of the Mount 
Vernon community, including several 
churches and local businesses, the 
founders of GSH established a volun-
teer board of directors to steer the or-
ganization’s efforts to help those expe-
riencing homelessness in the Greater 
Mount Vernon community. 
Today, GSH is a vital affordable 
housing and services provider with a 
10-person professional staff and a $2.7 
million operating budget. GSH remains 
true to its founding vision and mission. 
GSH works every day to reduce home-
lessness and enable self-sufficiency by

providing permanent affordable rental 
housing, emergency financial services, 
budget counseling, and case manage-
ment to hundreds of working families 
in Fairfax County. Then, as now, GSH 
helps struggling families create and 
sustain a better way of life for them-
selves and their neighbors. 
In 1975, GSH acquired its first prop-
erty on Holland Road, built and fur-
nished a home, and moved in a strug-
gling refugee family of nine and began 
providing them ongoing support serv-
ices, starting them on the path towards 
self-sufficiency and housing stability. 
Two months later, several Laotian and 
Vietnamese refugee families received 
housing assistance upon their arrival 
in the community. For the next several 
years, GSH continued to serve families 
and individuals needing housing and 
emergency financial assistance. Under 
the leadership of its board, GSH func-
tioned solely with the support of volun-
teers and individual donations. 
Today, with its affordable rental 
housing portfolio of 100-plus leased and 
owned units, as many as 120 struggling 
families are housed and supported 
every year in GSH housing. GSH’s 
emergency financial assistance pro-
gram assists an additional 200 house-
holds a year by preventing evictions or 
providing security deposits. GSH case 
managers also provide service referrals 
to another 200-plus households each 
year to receive community services to 
address 
their 
healthcare, 
transpor-
tation, and food needs. 
Additional support services and pro-
grams are offered to move resident 
household to greater self-sufficiency. 
The Children’s Resources Program sup-
ports the 110-plus schoolchildren resid-
ing in GSH affordable housing units 
and ensures their educational needs are 
met. Various financial counseling pro-
grams help low-income female heads of 
household create a healthy conscious-
ness around money and empowers them 
to begin to establish financial security. 
A president/chief executive officer, 
vice president/chief operating officer, 
financial manager, and development di-
rector lead the day-to-day operations 
of GSH. They are assisted by staff of 
six full- and part-time employees. A 16- 
member board of directors oversees its 
work, while a leadership council of 23 
key community stakeholders in the 
service area provides advice and guid-
ance on the needs and human services 
trends within the community and the 
impact of GSH programs in meeting 
those needs. 
The current service area lies within 
the Mount Vernon and Lee Districts of 
South Fairfax County, mainly along 
Richmond Highway from Alexandria to 
Lorton, where many low-income work-
ers live. The deepest pockets of poverty 
in Fairfax County are here. For exam-
ple, according to 2016 U.S. Census Bu-
reau data, 66,618 people 5.9 percent or 1 
in 17 Fairfax County live in poverty 
i.e., below the Federal poverty level of 
$24,600 per year for a family of four. 
Based on census data disaggregated at 
the ZIP code and neighborhood level, 
several of the neighborhoods in the 
GSH service area report that 10 to 15 
percent of their households live in pov-
erty. 
For more than 45 years, Good Shep-
herd Housing and Family Services has 
had one outcome in mind: to ensure 
that the households it serves reach 
housing stability, build financial re-
sources, and never face the possibility 
or reality of homelessness. Every year, 
GSH programs stretch and grow to 
make this outcome a reality for its 
residents. 
Recently, 
several 
local 
Northern Virginia and Metropolitan 
Washington, DC, agencies recognized 
the affordable housing contributions of 
GSH through grant awards that help fi-
nance the programs. As the need for its 
services unfortunately continues to 
grow at a staggering pace, GSH will 
continue to step up, lend a helping 
hand, and empower its clients to do the 
same.∑

RECOGNIZING PINECREST BAKERY 
∑ Mr. RUBIO. Madam President, as 
chairman of the Senate Committee on 
Small Business and Entrepreneurship, 
each week I recognize a small business 
that exemplifies the American entre-
preneurial spirit at the heart of our 
country. It is my privilege to recognize 
a family-owned small business that is 
not only a Miami staple, but has helped 
feed thousands of Floridians impacted 
by the coronavirus pandemic. This 
week, it is my pleasure to honor 
Pinecrest Bakery, of Pinecrest, FL, as 
the Senate Small Business of the Week. 
In 2012, Efrain Valdes and Joel Rodri-
guez founded Pinecrest Bakery. Years 
earlier, these longtime friends met in 
Miami’s Little Havana and formed a 
bond over their shared Cuban heritage 
and love for its cuisine. When Efrain’s 
family moved to Pinecrest, he noticed 
a lack of Cuban restaurants in their 
new neighborhood. Seeing this as an 
opportunity, Efrain and Joel opened 
the original Pinecrest Bakery in De-
cember 2012. Their welcoming atmos-
phere and delicious food proved a hit, 
with lines regularly forming out the 
door. Soon, Pinecrest Bakery expanded 
its hours to become Miami’s premier 
24-hour Cuban bakery. 
Eight years later, Pinecrest Bakery 
expanded to 17 locations, with 3 more 
on the way. Their original menu of 
Cuban coffee and pastries now includes 
meal and catering menus and a food 
truck. Pinecrest Bakery is earning ac-
colades for its delicious cuisine and 
emerging as a leader in the local busi-
ness community. The business remains 
family-owned, with several members of 
the Valdes and Rodriguez families serv-
ing in key leadership and food produc-
tion roles. Additionally, their strong 
sense of family has built a tight-knit 
and supportive team. 
Like many other small businesses, 
Pinecrest Bakery stepped up to help 
their 
community 
during 
the 
coronavirus pandemic. The shortage of 
essential goods in stores prompted 
them to sell their bulk supplies of milk 
and eggs directly to customers. In mid- 
March, Pinecrest Bakery ramped up 
their existing partnership with Farm 
Share, a nonprofit organization that 
connects Floridian farmers with sur-
plus produce to local businesses and or-
ganizations for distribution. Using its 
Pinecrest location as a distribution 
center, Pinecrest Bakery provided ap-
proximately 200,000 pounds of free food 
to nearly 10,000 families in south Flor-
ida. The American Legion recognized 
Pinecrest for donating hot meals to 
healthcare workers and first respond-
ers. 
When the U.S. Small Business Ad-
ministration launched the Paycheck 
Protection Program—PPP—Efrain and 
Joel applied immediately. The PPP 
provides forgivable loans to impacted 
small businesses and nonprofits who 
maintain their payroll during the 
COVID–19 
pandemic. 
Recently, 
Pinecrest Bakery received their PPP 
loan, which has enabled them to keep 
their employees paid and continue 
their work to feed south Florida. 
Pinecrest Bakery is a remarkable ex-
ample of how small businesses can le-
verage local connections to support 
their communities in times of crisis. I 
commend their work with Farm Share 
and leadership in the Miami area. 
Congratulations to Efrain, Joel, and 
the entire team at Pinecrest Bakery. I 
look forward to watching your contin-
ued growth and success in south Flor-
ida.∑

S. RES. 612 
Whereas, on Sunday, May 24, 2020, George 
Floyd of Minneapolis, Minnesota, was trag-
ically killed by police officers who were sub-
sequently and rightfully removed from their 
roles in serving the public, and were arrested 
and charged in connection with Floyd’s 
death; 
Whereas the Senate finds that the rule of 
law in the United States is undermined when

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2811 
June 9, 2020 
law enforcement officers engage in conduct 
inconsistent with equal treatment, justice, 
and the Constitution of the United States; 
Whereas since the death of George Floyd, 
peaceful protests by thousands of citizens ex-
ercising 
their 
First 
Amendment 
rights 
across the Nation have taken place; 
Whereas unfortunately in a number of cit-
ies, many individuals have used this time of 
meaningful, peaceful protest and mourning 
to riot, loot businesses, and burn police cars 
and churches; 
Whereas radical organizations like Antifa 
have sadly used the death of George Floyd to 
organize and sow violence in our commu-
nities and should be held accountable; 
Whereas radical protesters defaced the De-
partment of Veterans Affairs headquarters 
and the World War II Memorial, dishonoring 
the brave men and women who have served 
in the Armed Services; 
Whereas radical protesters defaced the 
Lincoln Memorial, the place where the 
March on Washington began, that momen-
tous occasion in the history of civil rights; 
Whereas radical protesters burned St. 
John’s Church, a church that supported the 
bold civil rights moment of the March on 
Washington; 
Whereas these actions taken by radical 
protesters do not honor the legacy of George 
Floyd nor further a rational cause, and those 
acting as violent anarchists and the mem-
bers of Antifa are taking advantage of the 
pain of people and the pain of the peaceful 
protesters; 
Whereas protests are a normal and healthy 
part of democracy, while acts of violence, 
looting, and arson should not be tolerated; 
Whereas in multiple cities, police and 
other law enforcement personnel have been 
intentionally attacked, injured, and killed, 
and many voices are radically calling to 
defund the police; 
Whereas the vast majority of police offi-
cers do their job bravely and righteously and 
are committed to ensuring that racism plays 
no part in law enforcement and that every-
one receives equal protection under the law; 
and 
Whereas the United States has a moral and 
constitutional obligation to protect the life, 
liberty, and property of all individuals, in-
cluding from abuse from those we entrust to 
defend public safety and from domestic ter-
rorists and violent, anti-democratic activ-
ists: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate 
that it is the policy of the United States— 
(1) to commemorate the life of George 
Floyd through official recognition and re-
membrance; 
(2) that the First Amendment guarantees 
every individual citizen the right to peace-
fully assemble and protest; 
(3) to urge an immediate end to the vio-
lence leading to the damage of lives and 
businesses across United States so that the 
Nation can come together in healing, dia-
logue, reconciliation, and prayer; 
(4) to urge leaders at every level of govern-
ment to examine and enhance the training of 
law enforcement to ensure equal treatment 
and protection under the law; and 
(5) to urge States and local governments to 
provide the funding and support necessary 
for law enforcement and first responders to 
protect the life, liberty, and property of 
every individual in the United States regard-
less of their race, color, or nationality.

THE GREAT AMERICAN OUTDOORS 
ACT 
Mr. LEE. Madam President, to most 
Americans, the so-called Great Amer-
ican Outdoors Act is a mistake. It is 
expensive, 
shortsighted, 
and 
it 
is 
wrong; but to those of us who live in 
the American West, it is a disaster. De-
spite its rosy claims, this legislation 
combines two bills that will only tight-
en the Federal stranglehold on our 
lands and drive us deeper into debt, to 
the detriment of our economy, our en-
vironment, and the livelihoods and the 
freedom of the American people. 
So just how, you might ask, does it 
do that? Well, let me explain. The first 
title containing an expanded version of 
the Restore Our Parks Act attempts to 
address the roughly $19.3 billion main-
tenance backlog on our Federal lands, 
concentrated primarily within national 
parks projects, which approach a $12 
billion maintenance backlog just on 
their own, but it seeks to do so by 
spending $9.5 billion of Federal offshore 
energy revenues over 5 years, without 
any means whatsoever of offsetting 
those extra funds. 
Now, that, to be clear, is money that 
is currently going to the U.S. Treasury 
to pay for a number of other costs, a

S2835 
June 9, 2020 
number of other expenditures—from 
aircraft carriers to Federal courts and 
everything in between—and will only 
add to our already ballooning national 
debt. 
It 
is, 
we 
have 
to 
remember, 
Congress’s job to set priorities for the 
funds in the Treasury. If we prioritize 
something—if we prioritize one thing— 
we must either proportionately de-
crease the funding for something else 
or find another way to generate new 
revenue. 
This bill does neither. Furthermore, 
without any measures to prevent it, it 
guarantees that a similar backlog will 
only reemerge in the future. There are 
better ways to address this problem. 
For example, there are much better 
ways in a proposal that has been intro-
duced by Senator ENZI in a bill called 
the REAL Act. The REAL Act would 
modestly increase park visitor fees by 
$5, businesses and tourist visa fees by 
$25, and a visa waiver program fee by 
$16—estimated to bring an additional 
$5.5 billion in revenue over the next 10 
years. 
This, the REAL Act, introduced by 
Senator ENZI is a reasonable, practical 
solution to sustainably address the 
maintenance backlog on our National 
Parks, which is a problem. It is a prob-
lem that needs to be dealt with, and 
the REAL Act does it in a very respon-
sible, sustainable fashion. What is 
more, the REAL Act would create a 
permanent and independent way of 
supplementing the funding for our Na-
tional Parks and do so without adding 
to the national debt. 
The second title of this bill—of the 
Great American Outdoors Act—creates 
almost $1 billion of mandatory spend-
ing every single year on new Federal 
land acquisition through the Land and 
Water Conservation Fund. In other 
words, it adds a new entitlement, add-
ing to our already unaffordable system 
of entitlements. It puts it on a level 
playing field with things like Social 
Security and Medicare, other entitle-
ment programs, the Land and Water 
Conservation Fund. 
Now, why would we do this when we 
are already on a collision course with 
our ability to fund Federal programs, 
including and especially those pro-
grams that America’s seniors have paid 
for, for years, and come to rely on? 
Why would we do that for this pro-
gram? Why make it mandatory spend-
ing and thus convert it into yet an-
other unaffordable entitlement pro-
gram? 
Let’s talk a little bit about the Land 
and 
Water 
Conservation 
Fund, 
or 
LWCF, as it is known. This was origi-
nally put in place pursuant to a law 
passed in 1964, and the LWCF, as it was 
created and enacted into law back in 
1964, was put in place in order to pro-
mote and preserve access to rec-
reational opportunities on Federal pub-
lic lands—on public lands generally, in 
fact. So the fund was set up to be the 
principal source of money for Federal 
land acquisition and to assist States in 
developing recreational opportunities 
on their own. 
Originally, it directed 60 percent of 
its funds to be appropriated for State 
purposes and 40 percent for Federal 
purposes. Unfortunately, the program 
has since drifted far from its original 
moorings and far from its original in-
tent, and it has been rife with abuse. In 
1976, the law was amended to remove 
the 60-percent State provision, stating 
simply that not less than 40 percent of 
the funds must be used for Federal pur-
poses, while remaining silent on wheth-
er a State would receive a penny. 
Now, just over the last year or so, 
not less than 40 percent of the funds 
are dedicated to State purposes, so 
that still means that up to 60 percent 
of the funds can still be used for Fed-
eral land acquisition. The result? Well, 
it hasn’t been good. It has been used 
more for Federal land acquisition than 
for improving access to or care of the 
vast Federal lands that we already own 
and manage—or in many cases, fail to 
manage. 
Sixty-one percent of the funds have 
historically been used for acquisition, 
compared to the 25 percent that have 
been allocated to State grants, spend-
ing close to $12 billion to purchase new 
Federal lands. 
So despite people’s images of charm-
ing ribbon cuttings at local parks and 
scenic wildlife, the LWCF has func-
tioned as the Federal Government’s 
primary vehicle for Federal land grabs, 
resulting in a massive, restrictive, and 
neglected Federal estate. 
The Federal Government now owns 
640 million acres of land—more than 
640 million acres—within the United 
States. To put this in perspective, this 
amount—the more than 640 million 
acres of land currently owned by the 
Federal Government within the United 
States—is a total larger than the 
entireties of France, Spain, Germany, 
Poland, Italy, the United Kingdom, 
Austria, Switzerland, and the Nether-
lands combined. 
Now, I am not talking about the gov-
ernment-owned lands or the parklands 
within those countries. I am talking 
about the entirety of the countries 
themselves. The Federal Government 
owns more land than that. That is 28 
percent of the total acreage within the 
United States, and more than 50 per-
cent of the land in the West. This has 
proven to be far more land than the 
Federal Government is capable of man-
aging responsibly. The condition of the 
vast Federal estate ranges from fair to 
poor to dismal. These lands face prob-
lems with rampant wildfires, soil ero-
sion, mismanagement, and littering— 
with a staggering combined mainte-
nance backlog of nearly $20 billion. 
Resources are only being spread thin-
ner as they are being stretched to serve 
more and more lands—more and more 
lands that are now going to be bought 
with the new entitlement spending 
that we are putting in place with this 
bill should we enact this ill-conceived 
legislative proposal. 
On top of that, many of the LWCF 
funds have been diverted to a vague 
‘‘other purposes’’ category that has, in 
many instances, little to do with ac-
cess to outdoor recreation at all. In 
fact, many of the programs it has fund-
ed have, instead, aimed to pull land 
from public use, regardless of how the 
land in question is classified. So rather 
than increasing opportunities for hunt-
ing and fishing, snowmobiling, hiking, 
camping, 
mountain 
biking, 
or 
kayaking, the land policies in place 
have slowly been squeezing out rec-
reational opportunities, and this has 
been going on for decades. 
And so, too, have these policies im-
posed severe economic restrictions. As 
the Federal estate has grown since the 
time the LWCF was established in 1964, 
natural resource production—including 
mining, energy, timber, and livestock 
raising—have sharply declined, depriv-
ing rural communities and their econo-
mies of crucial jobs and economic ac-
tivity. 
Timber production, for example, has 
been cut by about 90 percent since the 
1980s. So instead of providing sustain-
able, renewable, economically produc-
tive logging in the Northwest, these 
forests are now managed by cata-
strophic 
wildfire 
under 
the 
super-
vision—or I should say the failed super-
vision—of the Forest Service and the 
Bureau of Land Management. 
If you don’t believe me, ask anyone 
who lives in the Western United States. 
Ask anyone who lives in the commu-
nities of Utah who have seen the envi-
ronmental and economic devastation 
brought about as a result of failed land 
management policies. 
Now, some claim, rather audaciously, 
that the outdoor recreation economy is 
a major boon to these very same com-
munities that are being impoverished 
by it. But usually, nearly always, peo-
ple who say that aren’t people who live 
in those communities. 
Seasonal tourism is not a sustainable 
core industry for most communities. 
Much of the money spent on outdoor 
recreation ends up going to apparel, 
equipment, and gear from large out-of- 
state companies. Rural public lands 
counties don’t see a penny of it. This is 
especially true in those counties where 
the Federal Government owns not just 
67 percent of the land mass, as is the 
case throughout Utah as a whole, but 
90, 95 percent plus of the land in some 
counties. 
To make matters worse, Federal 
lands also mean a loss of property 
taxes and, as a result, a loss of huge 
sources of revenue and opportunities 
for States and for local communities. 
It is no coincidence that the poorest 
rural counties in the West are the very 
same communities, the very same 
counties where they have the most 
Federal land. The poorest counties are 
the counties with the most Federal 
land. 
Why is that? Well, there are a num-
ber of reasons, but one of the things 
that has to be taken into account is

June 9, 2020 
the fact that, without property taxes, 
schools are underfunded, local govern-
ments are crippled, fire departments 
are, ironically, depleted and, therefore, 
unable to properly take care of the 
lands they are charged to protect in 
the first place. This, by the way, says 
nothing of the loss of economic activ-
ity as a whole. I am just talking here 
about the lack of property tax revenue. 
Now, there is a Federal program for 
this, the Payment in Lieu of Taxes 
Program, also known as the PILT Pro-
gram, as the abbreviation refers. This 
is a program that was intended to ad-
dress this disparity by compensating 
counties and local communities for 
their loss of property taxes—that is the 
loss from property taxes that comes 
about as a result of significant Federal 
land ownership and the Federal Gov-
ernment’s declaration, by law, that its 
lands may not be taxed. But PILT pay-
ments have provided only a pittance of 
what would be due to local govern-
ments were Federal lands not exempt 
from property taxes. 
In 2018, the Utah Legislature com-
missioned a state-of-the-art evaluation 
of 32 million acres of Federal land in 
Utah, excluding roughly 3 million acres 
of 
National 
Parks 
and 
Wilderness 
Areas. Now, this May, that same com-
mission found that appraising these 
BLM and Forest Service lands accord-
ing to their lowest use value would re-
sult in an annual property tax bill of 
$534 million. And this, by the way, in 
addition to excluding National Parks 
and Wilderness Areas from that equa-
tion, was a study that involved only 
those Federal lands extending to with-
in 1 mile of any municipal boundary or 
of any city or town in Utah. So this 
fraction would produce $534 million an-
nually in property tax revenue, even if 
it were taxed at its lowest value. 
In 2019, the PILT payments to Utah 
statewide totaled just $41 million, just 
7.7 percent of the potential revenue 
from property taxes. Again, we are not 
talking about the National Parks or 
their National Wilderness Areas, nor 
are we talking about the lands outside 
of 1 mile beyond any municipal bound-
ary. 
And while States and localities are 
the ones carrying the unfair economic 
burden, Washington only pours salt in 
these wounds by neglecting its over-
sight responsibilities. In May 2019, a 
GAO report found that BLM fails to 
maintain centralized data on lands ac-
quired and that an increasing element 
of LWCF funds across agencies are 
being spent on acquisition projects 
that occur without and, in some cases, 
contrary to congressional approval. 
Not only that, but a December 2019 
GAO report found that numerous agen-
cies have blatantly disregarded LWCF 
requirements in order to illegally pur-
chase more land. Yes. They are buying 
land, in many cases, contrary to their 
statutory authorization and limita-
tions imposed by law. Under the origi-
nal LWCF Act, no more than 15 percent 
of the land added to the National For-
est System is to be west of the 100th 
meridian, essentially everything west 
of Oklahoma. But the GAO found that 
between fiscal years 2014 and 2018, the 
Federal Government had acquired more 
than 450,000 acres of land in the United 
States, more than 80 percent of which 
were west of the 100th meridian. In an-
other recent review of land acquisition 
policies across the agencies conducted 
by the Departments of Interior and Ag-
riculture, officials said that 40 percent 
of the land acquired with LWCF funds 
were not even requested by the agen-
cies—not requested in the first place, 
yet they were purchased in some cases 
contrary to an explicit statutory com-
mand. 
As it turns out, billions of LWCF dol-
lars are being spent without the Con-
gress and without the relevant agen-
cies or the public being informed of 
where or why or pursuant to what au-
thority they were made. Why, then, 
would it ever make sense to turn this 
into an entitlement program, to turn 
this into something that is self-perpet-
uating—into a self-licking ice cream 
cone—that needs no support or reau-
thorization year to year from Con-
gress? 
Last year, the Senate permanently 
reauthorized this broken, harmful, dan-
gerous, unaccountable fund without re-
form and without any incentive to 
offer future reforms, but as if that 
weren’t bad enough, the legislation be-
fore us now proposes to make that 
funding mandatory. 
Before, Congress could at least appro-
priate varying amounts to be used from 
the fund. Now, this bill, if passed, 
would turn the LWCF into a true trust 
fund, automatically requiring that the 
full $900 million be spent primarily on 
Federal land acquisition each year in 
perpetuity without accountability and 
without oversight. The unofficial Con-
gressional Budget Office score esti-
mates that this bill, as a whole, will 
cost nearly $17.3 billion over the next 
10 years, all for land projects that we 
cannot afford, let alone maintain. 
This is not how Congress was tasked 
with exercising the power of the purse. 
This is not how it is supposed to 
work—not in this country and cer-
tainly not in this legislative body. 
It is the tough business of Congress 
to set priorities and to decide which, 
among worthy causes, should receive 
our limited resources. These funds 
could be going to provide relief in the 
midst of the current pandemic or to 
our national defense or to shoring up 
benefits for veterans or to a myriad of 
other goals. Putting these funds into a 
direct deposit mechanism, however, 
means that we are not having those 
conversations and not actively evalu-
ating how we can best spend those tax-
payer dollars each year. No, no. In-
stead, we are going to put it on auto-
pilot. That is what this bill wants to do 
rather shamefully. 
This provision of the bill automati-
cally puts more funds toward the 
harmful cause of growing the Federal 
estate, putting us on an even worse 
path than we have already taken. In 
fact, the first provision of the bill is 
only evidence to the fact that we have 
bitten off far more than we can chew. 
We can do better. As it currently 
stands, we have nothing to gain from 
this legislation. The agenda of aggres-
sively and endlessly growing our Fed-
eral estate has put us on a dangerous 
path with devastating effects for our 
lands and for the people who live, 
recreate, and survive off of them as my 
home State of Utah has already experi-
enced far too well. If we do not change 
course, this path will only worsen for 
the rest of the Nation too. 
I want to point out something—a 
common misperception that people 
often have about Federal land and 
what it is and what it does. In many 
cases, if you don’t live in the western 
United States, you are not necessarily 
aware of the fact that the over-
whelming majority—not just most but 
the overwhelming majority of Federal 
land is not a national park. National 
parks are some of the few things people 
consistently like about the Federal 
Government. They are frequently the 
favorite thing about the Federal Gov-
ernment. We all love national parks. 
They are beautiful. They are fun, and 
they are something that the Federal 
Government does that everyone still 
enjoys and loves. But most Federal 
land is not a national park. The over-
whelming majority isn’t anything like 
a national park, and the way these 
lands are divided out really isn’t fair. 
In every State east of Colorado, the 
Federal Government owns less than 15 
percent of the land. In every State to 
the west of Colorado and including Col-
orado, the Federal Government owns at 
least 15 percent and, in many cases, 
many multiples of that. In my State it 
happens to be about 67 percent. A tiny 
segment of that land consists of na-
tional park land. Most of it is just land 
that you can’t use for anything else. 
The local governments can’t tax them, 
and people can’t access them for eco-
nomic or recreational purposes without 
a ‘‘Mother, may I?’’ from the Federal 
Government. That is what it is. Most 
of this land isn’t even a national park 
or a national recreation area or a wil-
derness area or anything remotely wor-
thy of that. This is just about Federal 
control, and most of it is not managed 
very well. 
The National Park System has been 
underfunded. They, in many ways, do 
the best job they can with what they 
have, but they have been chronically 
underfunded, and the national parks 
are quite well run compared to the vast 
majority of Federal public land we 
have, which is chronically neglected, 
environmentally mismanaged, often to 
the economic and environmental det-
riment of those States where there is a 
lot of Federal land. 
Take San Juan County, UT. The Fed-
eral 
Government 
owns 
somewhere 
along the order of 95 percent of the 
land in San Juan County. It also hap-
pens to be Utah’s poorest county.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2837 
June 9, 2020 
These two issues are not a coincidence. 
The fact that they appear in the same 
land mass is not coincidental; it is 
causal. The Federal Government is the 
cause for the impoverishment of this 
county and other communities in Utah 
and throughout the United States. 
Why? Because people can’t own the 
land, can’t develop the land, can’t tax 
the land to fund their schools, their 
search and rescue services, or any 
other government priority. Nor can 
they access it for most economic pur-
poses. 
Finally, all of my other observations 
about this legislation notwithstanding, 
this is the Senate, and just like church 
is for sinners, the Senate floor isn’t for 
perfect, hermetically sealed, finished 
bills. We are supposed to bring imper-
fect bills to the floor to debate and de-
liberate and amend and discuss and, ul-
timately, find consensus. That is why I 
and many of my colleagues have been 
trying to do exactly that in this very 
situation with this very bill. 
I have a number of amendments. 
Many western State Senators do as 
well. Several Gulf State Senators have 
their own concerns about this bill in 
its current form. The way the process 
is supposed to work is that we bring 
this and other bills like it to the floor, 
and we offer up changes and see where 
the Senate is, see where the process 
goes, using reason, gentle persuasion, 
and awkward improvements to each 
piece of legislation as our guide. That 
is how it is supposed to work. 
There are a number of Senators from 
western States, from Gulf States, and 
from States that really aren’t in the 
West or the gulf that don’t really have 
that much to do with Federal public 
land, but they can see the procedural 
and substantive defects of this bill. 
That is why many of us who really 
would like to make improvements to 
this bill have come together from dif-
ferent parts of the country. 
The process of actually legislating 
has gone out of fashion in Washington 
and, quite regrettably, out of this 
Chamber in recent years, but it is 
something that I think the whole Sen-
ate would like to get back to—and I 
mean the whole Senate, Democrats and 
Republicans alike. This is an issue that 
is neither Republican or Democratic; it 
is not liberal or conservative; it is not 
Libertarian. It is not an ideological 
viewpoint. I know people within this 
Chamber on virtually every point along 
the ideological political continuum 
who would very much like to see the 
Senate working as an actual legislative 
body rather than as a rubberstamp for 
whatever small handful of people hap-
pen to write out behind closed doors 
and decide must be the finished, per-
fect, hermetically sealed object of our 
vote. This is wrong. It is an insult, not 
just to the 100 Senators who are here. 
It is that to be sure, but nobody cares 
about that. It is more about those we 
represent, those who elected us. Those 
election certificates don’t belong to us. 
They belong to the voters of our var-
ious States who expect us to represent 
them. Regardless of how we might vote 
on any particular piece of legislation, 
they expect us to have read it; they ex-
pect us to do our job by showing up and 
by offering to make it better where we 
see flaws and we see defects. There is 
no perfect bill, but we can still make 
legislation a lot less bad. We can make 
it better. We bring about actual con-
sensus. Consensus is not found by ram-
ming something through without an 
opportunity for amendment, debate, or 
discussion. 
This is wrong. It has gone on for far 
too long. I have seen it under the lead-
ership of Democrats and Republicans 
alike in this Chamber, and it has to 
end. It will end. The question is, How 
long is it going to take us and how 
much misery will the American people 
have to endure while most of their Sen-
ators are effectively locked out of 
meaningful legislative debate, discus-
sion, and amendment? This is wrong, 
and it has to end. 
The debate on this bill has now been 
extended by a whole extra day. There is 
no earthly reason why we can’t use 
that extra day to work through a hand-
ful of 15-minute votes on a handful of 
amendments. It is just not that hard. 
In the amount of time that I have been 
speaking tonight, we could have proc-
essed a couple of amendments. In the 
amount of time that will be devoted 
only to hand-wringing and dismissal of 
legitimate concerns with this legisla-
tion, we could process any amendment 
that anyone wants to introduce, and 
this legislation could still be passed 
weeks before the House of Representa-
tives is even poised to return. So why 
are we not doing this? There is no per-
suasive answer here. 
We have to start doing our job. I look 
forward to working with our colleagues 
to get an agreement on some amend-
ments so that we can give this legisla-
tion the due consideration and the 
careful deliberation that it deserves, 
that we deserve, that those who elected 
us deserve, and then move on to the 
important nominations pending before 
the Senate and to the National Defense 
Authorization Act that are next in 
line. In the meantime, I hope Demo-
crats and Republicans alike can unite 
behind the fact that we can’t skate for-
ever under the mantra that the Senate 
is the world’s greatest deliberative 
body when it does not deliberate. The 
good news is, it is entirely within our 
power to reclaim use of that title jus-
tifiably and with dignity. 
I yield the floor.
