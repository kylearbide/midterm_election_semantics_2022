DESIGNATION OF THE SPEAKER 
PRO TEMPORE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore laid be-
fore the House the following commu-
nication from the Speaker: 
WASHINGTON, DC,

f 
PRAYER 
The Chaplain, the Reverend Patrick 
J. Conroy, offered the following prayer: 
Merciful God, we give You thanks for 
giving us another day. 
As Americans we come off a Fourth 
of July weekend unlike any other in 
our lifetimes. The tensions resulting 
from the threat of coronavirus and our 
collective response to its dangers were 
seen in high relief. 
We pray for the needs of the Nation, 
the world, and all of creation. Bless our 
leaders—national, 
statewide, 
and 
local—with a spirit of leadership to-
ward a shared, common future in a 
time when what separates us can easily 
be manipulated for political advantage. 
May we all realize that the responsi-
bility for the greatness of our Nation 
as it now is, and as it might be in the 
future, is dependent on our own will 
and desire for an ever more perfect 
Union. 
It is an ideal our Founding Fathers 
could only imagine and hope for. May 
their courage, even as fallible men, 
give us hope and courage to face the 
challenges of our beloved country as it 
exists today, not in some longed-for 
past. 
May Your blessing, O God, be with us 
this day and every day to come. May 
all we do be done for Your greater 
honor and glory. 
Amen.

Chair will lead the House in the Pledge 
of Allegiance. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore led the 
Pledge of Allegiance as follows: 
I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the

RECOGNIZING 
ARKANSAS 
STATE 
VETERANS HOME IN NORTH LIT-
TLE ROCK ARKANSAS 
HON. J. FRENCH HILL 
OF ARKANSAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, July 6, 2020 
Mr. HILL of Arkansas. Madam Speaker, 
today, I recognize Sarah Roberson and the 
staff at the Arkansas State Veterans Home in 
North Little Rock, Arkansas. Sarah and the 
staff have been restoring hope and happiness 
to our veterans through creativity and compas-
sion. 
Sarah Roberson and the team have quickly 
developed new ways to bring joy to our vet-
erans during the current public health crisis 
due to COVID–19 by dedicating their time to 
connecting veterans to their families via virtual 
chat, promoting outdoor activities including 
golf cart rides, gardening, and long walks. 
Sarah has also made sure our veterans 
have the ability to vote by assisting veterans 
with registering, transferring, and applying for 
absentee ballots. 
This initiative has shined a light on how cre-
ativity and compassion encourage positive atti-
tudes and can unite a community even amidst 
a public health crisis. 
I congratulate Sarah Roberson and the 
team at the Arkansas State Veterans Home 
for their efforts in lifting the spirits of our vet-
eran community.

PERSONAL EXPLANATION 
HON. SUSIE LEE 
OF NEVADA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, July 6, 2020 
Mrs. LEE of Nevada. Madam Speaker, while 
present in the House Chamber, I attempted to 
cast my electronic vote and vote ‘‘yea’’ on roll 
call 138. I then departed the House Chamber, 
though my attempted vote apparently was not 
recorded. I intended to vote in support of H.R. 
2, the Moving Forward Act. 
Had my vote been recorded without error, I 
would have voted ‘‘Yea’’ on Roll Call No. 138. 
f 
COMMEMORATING THE ACA AND 
PASSAGE OF THE FAIRNESS IN 
SOCIAL SECURITY ACT 
HON. JOE NEGUSE 
OF COLORADO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, July 6, 2020 
Mr. NEGUSE. Madam Speaker, 2020 com-
memorates the 10-year anniversary of the Af-
fordable Care Act, historic legislation which 
has greatly expanded access to healthcare for 
tens of millions of Americans. For those with 
pre-existing conditions, and for so many hard-
working middle-class families, the ACA truly is 
a critical law that has provided access to life- 
saving care. 
As the President and my Republican col-
leagues champion the dismantling of the 
ACA—destruction of progress for millions of 
citizens with, indeed, no proposal to take its 
place—I am honored to instead collaborate 
with my Democratic colleagues to ensure we 
are building and improving upon the victories 
of the ACA. 
That’s why I’m proud to champion the pas-
sage of the Patient Protection and Affordable 
Care Enhancement Act, which included my bill 
the Fairness in Social Security Act—legislation 
to ensure Social Security recipients continue 
to receive the Affordable Care Act tax credits 
for which they are eligible. Without this legisla-
tion, countless citizens will have the same ex-
perience as a constituent of mine, who sud-
denly and unfairly owed 27 thousand dollars to 
the IRS. For people with disabilities, veterans, 
and countless others, this bill will mean the 
difference 
between 
having 
access 
to 
healthcare or not. 
And that’s the bottom line of so many provi-
sions within the Patient Protection and Afford-
able Care Enhancement Act: without them— 
and without the ACA as a whole—the lives of 
our nation’s most vulnerable citizens will be at- 
risk. 
Now, as our nation faces unprecedented 
health and economic crises, is the time to im-
prove our healthcare system, not dismantle it. 
I look forward to working with each and every 
member on both sides of the aisle who share 
that goal.

HONORING THE LIFE OF GREGORY 
ALLEN THOMPSON 
HON. JIM BANKS 
OF INDIANA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, July 6, 2020 
Mr. BANKS. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
recognize the life of Mr. Gregory Allen Thomp-
son. 
Born In Ft. Benning, Georgia, Gregory was 
a valued father, businessman, and patriot. He 
graduated in 1982 from Columbus High 
School. Gregory received a Bachelor of 
Science in Communications from National 
Louis University. His patriotism inspired him to 
serve in the United States Air Force. He also 
worked as a Civil Service Employee. Gregory 
served as Chief of the United States Air Force 
Art Program at the Pentagon in Washington, 
D.C. Gregory worked in the U.S. State Depart-
ment as a Security Officer for over 15 years. 
Gregory was the owner of Made to Measure, 
Custom Tailor clothing business and remained 
part-owner and partner with Howard Wallace. 
He was a dedicated member of Mt. Zion Bap-
tist Church in Arlington. 
Gregory has served our nation with distinc-
tion. This record is testament to his civic en-
gagement, attentiveness, and hard work for 
which our country is forever grateful. Gregory 
was a valued father and friend to those who 
knew him. 
f 
HONORING BILL FINE 
HON. JOSEPH P. KENNEDY III 
OF MASSACHUSETTS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, July 6, 2020 
Mr. KENNEDY. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor and celebrate the career and 
accomplishments of a leader in the New Eng-
land media industry, Bill Fine. 
For half a century, Bill lived and breathed 
broadcast journalism. A graduate of Boston 
University’s College of Communication, he 
began his career as a sports anchor in the 
1970s. Over the ensuing years, he worked his 
way up the ranks of WCVB until earning a 
promotion to the helm of the station in 2005. 
As president and general manager of 
WCVB, he steered the broadcaster towards a 
number of awards, including six Gabriel 
Awards as the ‘‘Nation’s Best Television Sta-
tion’’ and the prestigious Service to America 
Award in 2014 for its contributions to the 
Greater Boston community following the Bos-
ton Marathon bombings. 
But more than just a leader in business, Bill 
was a leader in his community. Not satisfied 
with simply informing the public through 
WCVB’s programming, he spent long hours 
advocating for the causes he held dear and 
supporting organizations that strengthened 
neighborhoods across our Commonwealth. 
In the years that I’ve gotten to know Bill, 
he’s been a constant presence in the Boston 
community, willing to lend a hand whenever 
needed and often before being asked. While I 
am certainly excited for him and his next 
chapter, he will be missed by all of those who 
have worked with him through the years. 
To Bill and his wife, Gail, enjoy retirement.

TRIBUTE IN HONOR OF THE LIFE 
OF ALLISON ENDERT 
HON. ANNA G. ESHOO 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, July 6, 2020 
Ms. ESHOO. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to honor the tragically shortened life of Allison 
Endert, who died on June 15, 2020, while tak-
ing an afternoon walk in Seabright, California. 
Allison was born in Eureka, California, in 
1977. She graduated from the University of 
California, Santa Cruz, where she developed a 
deep love and respect for the beautiful Santa 
Cruz area, its mountains, its ocean and the 
spirit of its people. 
Allison was a true public servant. At the 
time of her death she was an analyst on the 
staff of Santa Cruz County Supervisor Ryan 
Coonerty. Prior to that she served as an ana-
lyst for then County Supervisor Neal Coonerty, 
and as Assemblyman John Laird’s District Di-
rector. She used her exceptional talents as ef-
fective vehicles to make a difference in the 
lives of people. She was justly proud of help-
ing to establish the Nurse-Family Partnership, 
which connects first-time mothers to nurses to 
ease the transition to parenthood, and of 
being a key partner in the Twin Lakes Beach 
Project. She loved Hawaii, music concerts, 
being an ardent supporter of her daughters’ 
schools, and her great delight was watching 
them play sports. 
The people who knew and loved Allison 
have expressed their feelings about her in 
many loving words. They say that she had 
moral clarity and was incredibly talented. She 
had a passion for public service and always 
tried to find ways to make lives better. She 
was a bright light who was always committed, 
friendly, caring, and loyal, and radiated com-
passion. She was a great listener with a deep 
commitment to social justice. She held herself 
and others to very high standards, she did 
what she said she would do, and always did 
it well. She adored her family and they came 
first in her life. 
Allison’s dear friend and mine, Les Gardner, 
said of Allison, ‘‘She was pure of heart. The 
most incredibly kind and principled young 
woman I have ever met. Life did not change 
her. When she died she was the same kind, 
young principled girl I knew so many years 
ago. A testament to her life is how many peo-
ple she touched and are now mourning her 
loss.’’ 
Madam Speaker, I ask the entire House of 
Representatives to join me in expressing our 
deepest condolences to Allison Endert’s part-
ner, Andy Tatum, and her two daughters, 
Molly Endert-Tatum and Lucy Endert-Tatum. 
She also leaves her mother, Kathy Huntley, 
two stepfathers, two brothers and a sister. Our 
community and our country have lost a shining 
star, one who contributed greatly and would 
have done even more, had she been given 
the time.
