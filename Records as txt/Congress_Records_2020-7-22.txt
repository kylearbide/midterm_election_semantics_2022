DESIGNATION OF SPEAKER PRO 
TEMPORE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore laid be-
fore the House the following commu-
nication from the Speaker: 
WASHINGTON, DC,

ant to the order of the House of Janu-
ary 7, 2020, the Chair will now recog-

THE CULTURE WE CREATE IN OUR 
ARMED SERVICES MATTERS 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Maryland (Mr. BROWN) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. BROWN of Maryland. Mr. Speak-
er, I thank Chairman SMITH and my 
colleagues on the House Armed Serv-
ices Committee for their bipartisan 
work on this year’s National Defense 
Authorization Act. 
We advanced progressive ideals to 
support our military families; improve 
readiness; sharpen our technological 
edge; and foster American leadership, 
our alliances, and a culture that is in 
line with the values of our Nation. 
This bill is truly transformational 
when it comes to advancing diversity 
and inclusion, as well as fairness and 
justice, in our military. 
We are at an inflection point when it 
comes to race in this country, dem-
onstrated by peaceful protests across 
the country and at a time when a pan-
demic 
has 
widened 
disparities 
in 
healthcare, education, economic oppor-
tunity, and housing along racial lines. 
Our armed services are not immune 
to these currents. 
The military has historically prided 
itself as leading in opportunity and ad-
vancement for men and women of 
color, but we have fallen far short of 
our expectations. Today we are still 
grappling with a military that doesn’t 
fully reflect our country’s diversity. 
Forty-three percent of the Active-Duty 
servicemembers are people of color, yet 
only two of the 41 most senior generals 
and admirals in the military are Black, 
and only one woman. 
As recent events have brought a 
reckoning in our society, we are still 
debating symbols of oppression. White 
supremacy, racism, and other toxic be-
liefs exist within our ranks, impacting 
how Black soldiers advance, their as-
signments in career fields, and how 
they are treated and assessed. 
African Americans comprise just a 
single-digit percentage of fighter pilots 
and navigators, only 5 percent of Army 
Green 
Berets, 
2 
percent 
of 
Navy 
SEALs; and only 0.6 percent of the Air 
Force’s 
power 
rescue 
jumpers 
are 
Black. 
Structural racism still exists in our 
military formations. Fifty-three per-
cent of minority servicemembers re-
port they have seen examples of white 
nationalism 
or 
racism 
within 
the 
ranks. These issues didn’t happen sud-
denly, but festered unchecked by a cul-
ture of indifference or intolerance. 
This culture extends to gender dis-
parities we still see in our Armed 
Forces. We have made progress and, 
this year, witnessed historic barrier- 
breaking firsts: 
Chief Master Sergeant JoAnne Bass 
was selected as the first woman to 
serve as the highest ranking non-
commissioned officer in a service com-
ponent; 
Lieutenant Junior Grade Madeline 
Swegle became the Navy’s first Black 
female tactical jet pilot; 
The U.S. Army just welcomed its 
first female Green Beret. 
However, there is more work to be 
done: 
Women have never exceeded 27 per-
cent of nominations made by Members 
of Congress to the prestigious service 
academies; 
In 2009, more than 6,000 cases of sex-
ual assault in the military were re-
ported. The Pentagon estimates these 
reports amount to just 30 percent of as-
saults, primarily against women. 
Women and men, whose trust in their 
fellow soldiers has been shaken, need 
our support and for this Congress to 
step up. 
This year’s NDAA takes important 
steps to create a more diverse and in-
clusive military. It builds on the work 
in 2008 of Majority Whip JIM CLYBURN, 
Representative 
HANK
JOHNSON, 
and 
former Members of this Chamber Eli-
jah Cummings and Kendrick Meek. As 
members of the Congressional Black 
Caucus, they recognized years ago that 
the military was not living up to the 
potential unlocked in 1948 when Presi-
dent Truman signed the executive 
order removing racial segregation in 
the Armed Forces. 
Together, Mr. CLYBURN, Mr. JOHNSON, 
Mr. Cummings, and Mr. Meek led the 
effort to create the Military Leader-
ship Diversity Commission, whose rec-
ommendations in 2011 are the basis for 
many of the diversity and inclusion 
provisions found in this year’s NDAA, 
which are some of the most significant 
steps towards diversity and inclusion

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H3616 
July 22, 2020 
that Congress itself has taken since the 
desegregation of the Armed Forces in 
1948. 
It seeks to foster opportunities for 
women and minorities. 
We bring new visibility to congres-
sional nominations to our service acad-
emies to train a more diverse next gen-
eration of leaders. 
We create a special investigator to 
review and investigate racial dispari-
ties in the military justice system and 
personnel practices. 
We create a special prosecutor for 
sexual assault committed at our mili-
tary academies. 
We foster and train a greater number 
of minorities within the special forces 
and aviation communities. 
We tap into the talent at our histori-
cally Black colleges and universities 
and other minority-serving institu-
tions. 
We hold the Secretary of Defense and 
service component leadership account-
able for progress and give them the 
tools to make it happen. 
This package updates workplace and 
climate surveys to include experiences 
with supremacist and extremist activ-
ity, anti-Semitism, and racism, allow-
ing leadership to understand the full 
extent of these beliefs and better tailor 
responses and disciplinary action. 
Finally, after decades of inaction, we 
reckon with one of the darkest periods 
of our history, the institution of slav-
ery. This NDAA bans the display of the 
Confederate flag on Department of De-
fense property and directs the removal 
of the names from military installa-
tions of those men who betrayed their 
country—our country—and who fought 
a war to defend the institution of slav-
ery. 
The culture we create in our armed 
services matters. Diversity and inclu-
sion in our armed services matters. It 
enhances unit cohesion and it improves 
military effectiveness. We have known 
this since 1950. 
Our work is far from finished, but 
this year’s NDAA represents an impor-
tant step toward this pivotal moment.

HONORING MAJOR GENERAL BILL 
BLAND 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Georgia (Mr. CARTER) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, I rise today to remember and honor 
the life of Major General Bill Bland of 
Georgia’s First Congressional District, 
who passed away peacefully at his 
home surrounded by family at 84 years 
old. 
General Bland is the former Adjutant 
General for the State of Georgia and a 
beloved husband, father, and a good 
friend. 
He enlisted in the Georgia Air Na-
tional Guard in 1958 and received his 
pilot’s wings in 1962 at Moody Air 
Force Base. 
General Bland served faithfully in a 
variety of assignments which took him 
all over the world. He was a command 
pilot with more than 8,000 hours, flying 
in nine different types of aircraft. He 
also served in the position of Adjutant 
General until his retirement in 1999, 
after more than 40 years of service in 
the U.S. Air Force and Air National 
Guard. 
I had the honor and privilege of at-
tending church with General Bland and 
his lovely wife, Harriet, at Wesley 
Monumental United Methodist Church. 
It was evident Jesus Christ was the 
Lord and savior of Bill’s life, and he 
used all the gifts God gave him to serve 
others and bring glory to God. He was 
an active and faithful member of the 
church, where he served on the board of 
trustees for 17 years. 
General Bland will surely be missed 
by his friends, family, our church com-
munity, and all who knew and loved 
him. His legacy of selfless devotion to 
our country and those in need will re-
main for countless years to come. 
CELEBRATING THE FEDERAL LAW ENFORCEMENT 
TRAINING CENTER’S 50TH ANNIVERSARY 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, I rise today to celebrate the Federal 
Law Enforcement Training Center’s, or 
FLETC’s, 50th anniversary. 
Since the Consolidated Law Enforce-
ment Training Center was created in 
1970 before becoming the Federal Law 
Enforcement Training Center, they 
have continued the mission of safe-
guarding our homeland and serving as 
America’s enterprise resource for Fed-
eral law enforcement training. 
In its first year, FLETC graduated 
2,200 students. Last year, FLETC wel-
comed more than 67,000 students. They 
have grown to manage more than 850 
training programs across the training 
sites, including one in Brunswick, 
Georgia. 
For the past 50 years, FLETC has 
been a critical program to ensure our 
officers of tomorrow receive the proper 
training to protect the communities in 
which they serve. 
FLETC has done a great job at adapt-
ing throughout their existence from 
hurricanes, government shutdowns, to 
a worldwide pandemic. Whatever they 
have faced, FLETC has done a remark-
able job at getting invaluable Federal 
law enforcement personnel to the front 
lines. 
Now, more than ever, is an important 
time to honor their five decades as the 
Nation’s producer, resource, and stew-
ard of Federal law enforcement train-
ing. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank all who work 
tirelessly at FLETC, especially those 
at Glynco in Georgia’s First Congres-
sional District. 
REMEMBERING KYLE STEVEN HUGUNIN 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, I rise today to remember and honor 
the life of Mr. Kyle Steven Hugunin. 
Friends, family, and members of 
Kyle’s community recently recognized 
the 1-year anniversary of his passing at 
the youthful age of 30. He was from Sa-
vannah, in Georgia’s First Congres-
sional 
District, 
and 
was 
an 
out-
standing, kind, and loving individual, 
who was a friend to all. 
Kyle was employed by Industrial 
Conveyor Belt Services for 10 years and 
worked hard in all he did. 
While reminiscing on Kyle’s abun-
dance of joy that he brought to all fam-
ily, friends, and others, they recalled 
that ‘‘he had one of the best smiles 
ever.’’ He represented what it looks 
like to truly live life to the fullest and 
not take any day for granted. 
Kyle was a 2007 graduate of Bene-
dictine Military School and loved the 
outdoors, hunting, fishing, golf, and 
baseball. 
My thoughts and prayers go out to 
all who knew and loved him during this 
difficult time. 
CONGRATULATING BRUNSWICK-GOLDEN ISLES 
CHAMBER OF COMMERCE 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, I rise today to congratulate the 
Brunswick-Godlen Isles Chamber of 
Commerce for the U.S. certification at 
the highest five-star level. 
Accreditation with the U.S. Chamber 
of Commerce is the only program of its 
kind. It defines excellence in chamber 
planning and recognizes chambers for 
outstanding contributions toward posi-
tive change in their communities. 
There are currently only 204 chambers 
across the country that have earned 
the accreditation designation, and only 
128 are five-star. 
The Brunswick-Golden Isles Chamber 
of Commerce has been the voice of the 
business 
community 
and 
a 
leader 
among community programs. 
I applaud all members of the cham-
ber for their hard work throughout the 
years to excel above other chambers 
throughout the Nation and their ef-
forts to lead by example. 
In part due to the chamber’s hard 
work and dedication, our community is 
an exceptional place to live, work, and 
visit. I look forward to seeing the posi-
tive future of the chamber and the 
communities they help serve and grow.

CRITICAL INITIATIVES INCLUDED 
IN FISCAL YEAR 2021 NATIONAL 
DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Rhode Island (Mr. CICILLINE) for 5 min-
utes. 
Mr. CICILLINE. Mr. Speaker, yester-
day the House passed H.R. 6395, the 
William M. (Mac) Thornberry National 
Defense Authorization Act. 
The passage of this year’s NDAA in 
the House was a bipartisan achieve-
ment done under extremely difficult 
circumstances, and I would like to con-
gratulate Chairman ADAM SMITH, and 
particularly 
Ranking 
Member 
MAC 
THORNBERRY, as this will be his final 
NDAA before his retirement at the end 
of this year. 
I wanted to take a few moments to 
highlight some of the provisions in this 
legislation which I am grateful were 
included. 
These include provisions which will 
strengthen manufacturing in my home

State, protect the employment rights 
of our Nation’s servicemembers, help 
to 
improve 
maternal 
and 
mental 
healthcare 
for 
servicemembers 
and 
their families, and strengthen ties with 
one of our Nation’s oldest allies. 
The Southern New England Regional 
Commission, H.R. 5124, which this bill 
included, establishes a regional com-
mission that will facilitate the invest-
ment of Federal funds in southern New 
England, including my home State of 
Rhode Island, to build upon our re-
gional strengths, such as defense man-
ufacturing, shipbuilding, and renewable 
energy. This initiative will generate 
critical economic growth in the region 
to reduce poverty, unemployment, and 
out-migration in counties that were hit 
hardest by the Great Recession and 
now by COVID–19. 
Mr. Speaker, I acknowledge Con-
gressmen JOE COURTNEY, JOE KENNEDY, 
STEPHEN
LYNCH, JOHN
LARSON, and 
BILL KEATING, who are cosponsors of 
this legislation, and I thank them for 
their support of this critical initiative 
which will benefit all of our districts. 
This year’s NDAA also includes the 
Justice for Servicemembers Act, H.R. 
2750, which I authored, clarifying that 
the statutory rights of servicemembers 
and their families under the Service-
members Civil Relief Act cannot be 
waived through forced arbitration un-
less it is agreed to after a dispute 
arises. 
American servicemembers, veterans, 
and their families have sacrificed much 
in service of our country. They have 
fought to protect the fundamental idea 
that we are a nation of laws and insti-
tutions that guarantee the rights and 
prosperity of every American. 
Since the Second World War, Con-
gress has created many laws, including 
the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act, 
to provide essential protections and 
guarantee every veteran and Active- 
Duty servicemember, including the Re-
serves and National Guard, the right to 
be free from workplace discrimination 
on the basis of their military service 
and their right to their day in court to 
enforce these protections. But for too 
long, forced arbitration has eroded 
these fundamental protections by fun-
neling servicemembers’ claims into a 
private system set up by corporations 
without the same procedural safe-
guards of our justice system. 
Buried deep within the fine print of 
everyday contracts, forced arbitration 
clauses block the brave men and 
women in uniform, as well as their 
family members, from having their day 
in court to hold corporations account-
able for breaking the law. This bipar-
tisan provision ends this shameful 
practice by clarifying that arbitration 
clauses are only enforceable if agreed 
to by servicemembers or their families 
after a dispute arises. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleagues, 
Congressman JARED GOLDEN, Congress-
woman SUSAN DAVIS, and Congressman 
GUY RESCHENTHALER, for their strong 
bipartisan support for this provision to 
protect our men and women in uni-
form. 
b 0915 
Also included in this year’s NDAA is 
a provision which will require the De-
partment of Defense to provide a report 
to 
Congress 
on 
the 
maternal 
healthcare, 
in 
particular 
mental 
healthcare, that is available to our Na-
tion’s servicemembers, as well as the 
spouses of servicemembers. 
According to the CDC, 1 in 8 women 
nationwide experience symptoms of 
postpartum depression, and in some 
States that percentage can be high as 1 
in 5. 
Yet, according to the What to Expect 
Project, data related to instances of 
postpartum depression and other men-
tal health conditions associated with 
pregnancy and childbirth is not widely 
available. 
This report required by the amend-
ment will require the Department of 
Defense to outline the care that is cur-
rently available for servicemembers 
and their spouses who may experience 
symptoms of postpartum depression. 
Finally, this year’s NDAA will in-
clude a provision which will encourage 
greater investment and trade between 
the United States and Portugal. 
Last year, I introduced the Advanc-
ing Mutual Interests and Growing Our 
Success, or the AMIGOS Act, H.R. 565, 
which makes Portuguese nationals eli-
gible for E–1 and E–2 nonimmigrant 
visas if the Government of Portugal 
provides similar nonimmigrant status 
for U.S. nationals, legislation which 
passed the House without opposition in 
December of last year. 
Access to these investor visas will 
allow Portuguese investors to support 
projects in the U.S., benefiting our 
economy as well as that of Portugal. 
As one of the first countries to recog-
nize the United States after the Revo-
lutionary War, Portugal is one of our 
closest economic partners and strong-
est allies. 
Today, the United States maintains 
that longstanding relationship as the 
fifth largest export market for Por-
tugal, and its largest trading partner 
outside the European Union. 
The AMIGOS Act will strengthen 
this trade partnership and strengthen 
ties with our longtime NATO ally, Por-
tugal. 
I would like to acknowledge Con-
gressman BILL KEATING and Congress-
man DEVIN NUNES for their support of 
this provision, and the instrumental 
role they played in securing its inclu-
sion in this year’s NDAA during the 
House 
Armed 
Services 
Committee 
markup. 
I would, once again, like to thank 
Chairman SMITH and Ranking Member 
THORNBERRY for supporting these pro-
visions, and for their work on this 
year’s National Defense Authorization.

THE CONVERSATION ON STATUE 
REMOVAL 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
North Carolina (Ms. FOXX) for 5 min-
utes. 
Ms. FOXX of North Carolina. Mr. 
Speaker, it is time, yet again, to cor-
rect the record. 
For years, my colleagues across the 
aisle and the mainstream media have 
been spouting off unfounded claims 
that Republicans are complicit with 
the presence of statues in the Capitol 
that memorialize figures who had ties 
to the Confederacy. 
Democrats seem to have forgotten 
that members of their own party on 
the State and Federal levels are the 
ones responsible for these statues in 
the first place. 
Since 1870 statues have been present 
in the Capitol, and since then, Demo-
crats retained a majority in the House 
39 times. They had ample opportunities 
to remove controversial statues from 
the Capitol, yet, they did nothing. Why 
has it taken this long for them to even 
broach the issue? 
We can all agree that racism, in any 
shape or form, must be denounced and 
rejected. But it is odd that my col-
leagues across the aisle want to skew 
the narrative, do everything they pos-
sibly can to rewrite history, and insert 
themselves into a conversation where 
they lean on conjecture more than 
they do on facts. 
For years, I have advocated that both 
of North Carolina’s statues of Charles 
Aycock and Zebulon Vance be removed 
based on their ties to the Confederacy. 
I have suggested that two statues of 
people that all North Carolinians and 
Americans can be proud of be put in 
their place. I am proud that the first 
Republican majority in North Caro-
lina’s legislature in 140 years voted in 
2015 to replace the Aycock statue with 
a statue of Reverend Billy Graham. 
For years, the North Carolina Demo-
crat Party has used former Governor 
Aycock’s name, along with Governor 
Vance, for major fundraisers, and have 
held meetings in buildings named after 
him. Where was the initiative then? 
North Carolina’s former Democrat 
Governor, 
Bev 
Perdue, 
sidestepped 
questions about buildings named after 
former Governor Aycock in press con-
ferences. Instead, she pivoted to his im-
pact on public education in North 
Carolina. Again, I say, where was the 
initiative to remove the statutes then? 
Even in 2007, in a Democrat primary 
for Governor in North Carolina, it was 
said that addressing controversial stat-
ues was not the answer and that ‘‘the 
issue of equality is one that North 
Carolina must deal with on a more 
broader level.’’ 
If our colleagues across the aisle 
want to have a meaningful discussion 
on this issue with us, we welcome it. 
The decision to replace these statues 
goes beyond bipartisan collaboration. 
It is about doing what is right, in an 
expeditious manner, as opposed to ex-
ploiting a situation to score cheap po-
litical points. 
Mr. Speaker, describing the vote we 
will hold today as ‘‘political showman-
ship’’ would be an understatement.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H3618 
July 22, 2020 
Maybe it is to compensate for the fact 
that Democrats are responsible for the 
statutes having been placed in the Cap-
itol and the times Democrats failed to 
act in the past. You be the judge. 
f 
WE HAVE BEEN WARNED; NOW 
WHAT DO WE DO? 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Connecticut (Mr. HIMES) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. HIMES. Mr. Speaker, last Satur-
day night, Christopher David, a vet-
eran of the United States Navy, was 
walking in Portland when he came 
upon an odd sight: Federal agents, in 
full tactical gear, heavily armed, look-
ing for all the world like the operators 
that we drop into terrorist havens in 
Afghanistan, patrolling the streets of 
an American city; detaining Ameri-
cans; hustling them, unexplained, into 
rented minivans. 
Now, is Mr. David a masked ninja of 
anarchy? No. 
Was he throwing rocks or carrying 
bottles of gasoline? No. 
Mr. David was curious, and he stood 
there, clearly unarmed, clearly not a 
threat, curious. 
And here is where it gets interesting, 
and any American who hasn’t seen the 
video needs to look at it right now. 
A Federal agent, gas mask, body 
armor, 
camouflage, 
bristling 
with 
weapons and tactical gear, approaches 
Mr. David, winds up, and beats Mr. 
David repeatedly with his truncheon. 
Mr. David doesn’t move. His hand has 
been broken by a Federal agent, but he 
doesn’t move, not a muscle. 
Well, the agent is confused by this 
and he hesitates. But backup arrives. 
Another Federal agent sprays Mr. 
David repeatedly in the face with pep-
per spray. Now this is heartening to 
the first agent, so he winds up and hits 
Mr. David again with his bat. 
Now, I don’t care how cynical you 
have become about our country. I don’t 
care whether you have signed over 
your time, your talent, your treasure, 
your integrity to the support of Donald 
J. Trump. If you have a drop of Amer-
ican blood in your veins, your soul dies 
a little as you watch the heavily armed 
Federal agent beat a United States 
Navy veteran. 
So what are combat-ready Federal 
agents doing in the streets of a city 
which does not want them there in a 
State which did not ask for them? 
Are there bodies piling up in the 
streets of Portland? 
Are there 150,000 dead—just to choose 
a number—Americans in Portland? No. 
There is not a single fatality. Of course 
not. 
Like so many cities, Portland boiled 
over in rage at the murder of George 
Floyd at the hands of the Minneapolis 
Police Department. And, yeah, regret-
tably and illegally a minority of 
protestors have committed acts of van-
dalism; bottles and rocks have been 
thrown, windows broken, threats made. 
That is not okay, ever. 
But protecting property in Portland 
or anywhere else is the job of the local 
police department, the State police 
and, in a worst-case scenario, the Na-
tional Guard. Why? 
First, while Federal agents are le-
gally entitled to protect Federal prop-
erty, they are not authorized to patrol 
municipal streets to enforce State and 
local law. That is an idea that goes 
back to our dissatisfaction with King 
George, and it is an idea that my Re-
publican friends used to care about. 
Second, operationally, agents of the 
Border Patrol and the Marshals Service 
are not trained to manage protests. 
They are trained to patrol borders and 
to chase fugitives. A heavily armed in-
dividual with no identification or in-
signia trundling people, without expla-
nation, into an unmarked van is likely 
to be misunderstood in a way that 
could lead to violence, particularly in a 
heavily armed society. 
Finally, there is the question of the 
President’s intentions, which are pret-
ty clear. We have seen how the Presi-
dent responds to real crisis; almost 
150,000 Americans dead of COVID–19, 
denial, misinformation. 
We have 5 percent of the world’s pop-
ulation and 25 percent of the COVID–19 
deaths on the planet. That is a dis-
grace. It is a lethal disgrace. 
George Floyd, an unarmed Black 
American, dies at the hands of the po-
lice, like so many before him. That is a 
lethal crisis. 
The President was asked about Black 
Americans dying at the hands of police 
and he says: ‘‘So are White people; so 
are White people. What a terrible ques-
tion to ask.’’ 
And now the President threatens to 
send heavily armed Federal agents to 
New York, Chicago, Detroit, Balti-
more. Do we have a problem? No, we do 
not. 
Take it from an unclassified Office of 
Intelligence and Analysis report by the 
Department of Homeland Security: 
‘‘The regularity of violence amidst 
lawful protests in Portland since 26 
May contrasts with national trends, 
which reflect a steady decline in vio-
lence during the last 2 weeks’’—‘‘a 
steady decline in violence during the 
last 2 weeks.’’ 
Mr. Speaker, this is important be-
cause democracies die, but they don’t 
die fast. They die because people come 
to believe that the media is the enemy 
of the people. They die because a Presi-
dent’s supporters are more given over 
to that President than they are to the 
rule of law; and they die because citi-
zens become used to the sight of Fed-
eral agents acting, not to protect 
them, but to attack them. 
We have been warned. The question 
is: Now what do we do?

RECOGNIZING THE HEROIC SERV-
ICE OF DETECTIVE JOSH SIM-
MONS 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
North Carolina (Mr. BUDD) for 5 min-
utes. 
Mr. BUDD. Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
to recognize the excellent law enforce-
ment personnel who serve North Caro-
lina’s 13th District. I would like to spe-
cifically mention a heroic act that hap-
pened on July 14 in Rowan County. 
A detective named Josh Simmons 
saw a burning car as he drove down 
Highway 52. When he approached, he 
found an elderly woman unable to get 
out. He pulled her from the car just 
minutes before it went up in flames. 
Detective Simmons said of his ac-
tions: ‘‘The way I was raised, you take 
care of people. I didn’t know who was 
in the car. It didn’t matter who they 
were. They just needed help.’’ 
Mr. Speaker, this is a great example 
for all of us. Our community is truly 
lucky to have such courageous folks 
serving and protecting us. 
HEALTHY SKIES ACT 
Mr. BUDD. Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
to put forward a new proposal to help 
reopen our country with speed and with 
safety. 
Between business, leisure, and tour-
ism, air travel is a mode of transpor-
tation that must be trusted if our 
country can fully reopen. In fact, be-
fore the pandemic, commercial avia-
tion drove 5 percent of our GDP and 
helped support more than 10 million 
American jobs. 
Unfortunately, there are currently 
no concrete proposals to lessen the fear 
that has gripped air travelers and crip-
pled the aviation industry. And that is 
why I am proposing a bipartisan bill 
called the Healthy Skies Act, along 
with Congressman RALPH NORMAN and 
JOHN LARSON. 
This bipartisan legislation instructs 
the TSA Administrator to create a 
pilot program that would temporarily 
screen the temperature of all travelers 
going through TSA security before 
they reach the gate area. 
Having the TSA temporarily screen 
passengers for elevated temperatures 
has a number of practical advantages. 
It ensures that each passenger experi-
ences a consistent nationwide process 
to prevent infected individuals from 
boarding planes and spreading the 
virus. This will give travelers the peace 
of mind they need to confidently start 
flying again, while discouraging folks 
who might be sick from even attempt-
ing to come to the airport in the first 
place. 
Reopening America should be the top 
priority of our government. Making 
sure air travelers are healthy enough 
to fly is a commonsense way to boost 
passenger confidence and jump-start 
economic activity. And that is how we 
can stop the spread of COVID–19 and 
continue a great American comeback.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H3619 
July 22, 2020 
Mr. MALINOWSKI. Mr. Speaker, over 
the last 3 months, the people in my 
State of New Jersey have pulled to-
gether in extraordinary ways to fight 
the coronavirus. Our leaders made good 
decisions. But, more important, all of 
us understood that public health had to 
come first. 
The sacrifices we made were worth 
making. Today, all our numbers are 
looking good. The rate of spread of the 
infection, testing positivity are way, 
way down. If all of America were New 
Jersey, we could stand here today and 
say that America is beating COVID–19. 
But that doesn’t make the sacrifices 
any less hard to bear. 
And among those who sacrificed were 
our young people who were looking for-
ward to graduation; not just the formal 
ending of their high school education, 
but the celebration of it with family 
and friends, the dances, the big games, 
the rites of passage that all of us expe-
rienced when we were their age and 
that we want for our kids. 
b 0930 
Many of our graduating seniors did 
end up having outdoor graduations, but 
they 
came 
late 
and 
with 
social 
distancing. And let’s face it, a socially 
distanced graduation is kind of an 
oxymoron. But we have also seen our 
communities come together in creative 
ways to celebrate the accomplishments 
of our young people, and I want to rec-
ognize those efforts today. 
In Hunterdon County in my district, 
the parents, teachers, and school ad-
ministrators implemented an Adopt a 
Senior 
program, 
where 
volunteers 
adopted a graduating student to send a 
letter, a card, or a gift to let them 
know their communities are rooting 
for them. 
In Berkeley Heights, the light poles 
downtown are decorated with seniors’ 
pictures, announcing what college they 
will be attending in the fall. 
In Bridgewater, an administrator vis-
ited the home of every senior in a bus 
with a banner celebrating the class of 
2020, dropping off a graduation package 
and a personalized Bridgewater-Rari-
tan High School lawn sign for each sen-
ior. 
In Mount Olive, posters celebrating 
the 
graduating 
class 
were 
placed 
throughout town. 
In Springfield, the school surprised 
students with a display of personalized 
banners on the fence outside of the 
high school, each one bearing the name 
and photo of a member of the grad-
uating class. 
In 
Westfield, 
a 
video 
slideshow 
played in the window panels of the his-
toric Arcanum Hall, with montages of 
senior portraits, pictures from school 
events, and a countdown clock to grad-
uation. 
These efforts from our communities 
are wonderful to see and, I am sure, are 
tremendously appreciated by the re-
cipients. 
During my time in Congress, I have 
worked hard to reach out to young peo-
ple to encourage their interests and in-
volvement in the conversations that 
are happening every day here in Con-
gress. I have visited dozens of schools 
throughout the 75 towns of my district 
and have hosted two classes of my 
youth advisory council. 
This year, about 170 kids in my youth 
council spent the entire year breaking 
up into congressional committees and 
proposing legislation. I intend to intro-
duce some of their proposals in this 
body this year. Their questions are al-
ways thoughtful, and they are always 
eager to get involved and make a dif-
ference. 
It is tough to see them graduate in a 
time of so much uncertainty and fear, 
but throughout the many crises our 
country has faced in recent months, I 
have seen our young people step up and 
lead time and time again. If the stu-
dents in New Jersey’s Seventh District 
are any indication of young people 
around the country, the future of 
America is in good hands. 
Congratulations to all of our 2020 
graduates. I can’t wait to see every-
thing they are going to accomplish in 
the years ahead.

CALLING FOR TEMPORARY 
PAYROLL TAX HOLIDAY 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Florida (Mr. SPANO) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. SPANO. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to thank those Members who 
have joined me in standing with mil-
lions of struggling Americans by call-
ing for the adoption of the Keep Em-
ployees’ Earnings Protected Act, also 
known as the KEEP Act, and to en-
courage my colleagues who haven’t 
done so to do so and stand with us. 
As this body debates another relief 
package, a keystone of such legislation 
should be a temporary payroll tax holi-
day. I introduced this bill to allow our 
workers to keep more of the money 
that they have already earned, thus in-
fusing critical capital into our econ-
omy without involving Federal bu-
reaucracy. 
It is now more critical than ever to 
ensure that families have the funds, 
their funds, to reinvest back into our 
economy and to continue our economic 
comeback by buying locally and sup-
porting each other. Employers, too, 
can use their tax savings to invest in 
their 
businesses 
and 
in 
their 
workforces. 
No government program, no matter 
how generous, can replace a strong, 
functioning economy. President Trump 
has called on Congress to deliver this 
bill to his desk for signature, and the 
time to deliver is now. The American 
people are waiting and watching. 
HOLDING CHINA ACCOUNTABLE 
Mr. SPANO. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to lend my voice to House efforts 
to hold China accountable for their 
role in the spread of the coronavirus. 
China lied; Americans died. It is real-
ly that simple. 
China’s 
socialist 
government 
not 
only misled the international commu-
nity in what they knew and when they 
knew it, but they also colluded with 
the World Health Organization to cover 
for them. China’s irresponsible behav-
ior led to a worldwide COVID–19 pan-
demic, which has brought about death 
and economic mayhem across our plan-
et. As the evidence mounts, China is 
now censoring those speaking out. 
Congress must stand together, shoul-
der to shoulder, to ensure the Chinese 
Government is held responsible for the 
damage they have caused and to ex-
plore avenues to promptly bring manu-
facturing back to the U.S., including 
pharmaceuticals. 
I also commend President Trump for 
pulling the United States out of the 
WHO until they, too, have been held 
accountable for their actions. Not a 
penny of taxpayer dollars should ever 
go toward international organizations 
that look the other way solely for po-
litical or economic interests, especially 
one that operates in the public health 
arena. 
The time for answers is now. 
HONORING SERGEANT ANDREW BOSKO 
Mr. SPANO. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to honor Mr. Andrew Bosko, a 
Lakeland, Florida, World War II vet-
eran who is 98 years young. 
Andy was born in Ohio, raised in 
Pennsylvania, and is one of 13 children 
of immigrant parents from Austria and 
Czechoslovakia. 
He entered the Army Air Corps in 
1943, assigned to the Seventh Fighter 
Command in Hawaii. In 1945, the com-
mand was reassigned to Iwo Jima to 
provide emergency landing fields sup-
porting bombing operations against 
Japan. 
Meanwhile, Andy’s wife and true 
love, Sophia, was supporting the war as 
a Rosie the Riveter. Yet, they still 
found time to write each other every 
single day. 
Following the war, Andy worked as a 
machinist in New York and later par-
ticipated in several other businesses. 
Andy, you, together with your bride 
of 74 years, represent the greatest of 
our Greatest Generation. 
They experienced economic and so-
cial turmoil and a world war, and then 
they helped rebuild our Nation into the 
greatest on Earth. 
It is an honor to serve Andy, as he, 
for so many years, has served us. 
REESTABLISH LAW AND ORDER 
Mr. SPANO. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today in support of the House minority 
and Trump administration’s efforts to 
reestablish law and order in our coun-
try and to stop mob rule. 
For almost 2 months, communities 
throughout our country, particularly 
Democrat-led urban centers, have expe-
rienced levels of lawlessness and civil 
unrest unseen for decades. I am not re-
ferring to those who have exercised 
their First Amendment rights to peace-
ably assemble and protest. No. I am 
talking about those who vandalize, de-
stroy, and knowingly break the law,

stirring havoc and instilling fear into 
families and business owners. 
From San Francisco to Portland, 
from Minneapolis to New York City 
and everywhere in between, we have 
seen the consequences of protecting the 
mob over innocent civilians. This can-
not be, and it cannot continue. 
Law and order must be brought back 
to our neighborhoods, and we must 
hold cities and their leaders account-
able for failing to adequately protect 
those whom they have sworn to serve. 
All Americans, regardless of ZIP 
Codes, have a right to feel safe in their 
homes and on their roads. Mob rule 
will not be tolerated. We must reestab-
lish law and order in America, and we 
must do it now. 
f 
REQUIRE FEDERAL CORONAVIRUS 
PREPAREDNESS 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Illinois (Mr. SCHNEIDER) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. SCHNEIDER. Mr. Speaker, our 
Nation is in crisis. Yesterday, the 
United States added more than 1,000 
names to the already unbearably long 
list of 140,000 people killed by COVID– 
19. There have been nearly 4 million 
confirmed cases in the United States, 
and the CDC believes the number is 
many 
times 
greater. 
There 
are 
hotspots around the country, most no-
tably in Southern States. 
Many States like California and my 
State of Illinois that have taken meas-
ures to reopen are now looking at roll-
ing back these measures and rein-
stating greater restrictions to keep 
their citizens safe. 
The pandemic has affected all of us, 
putting our loved ones at risk, keeping 
our kids from school, overwhelming 
our 
healthcare 
systems, 
and 
dev-
astating our businesses while costing 
40 million people their jobs and pushing 
State and local governments to the 
brink. 
With so many people and commu-
nities suffering, we desperately need a 
national strategy to beat back this 
virus. Unfortunately, while families, 
students, community leaders, and citi-
zens are all making great sacrifices, 
and local governments are being forced 
to cut vital services, leadership and 
support from the administration have 
repeatedly fallen short. The American 
people deserve better. 
All the sacrifices made since March 
were and are meant to buy us time to 
bend the curve, knock down this virus, 
and, ultimately, stand up our economy. 
But the sacrifices are only valuable if 
we are using the time to prepare for 
what many experts believe will be a 
spike come the fall. 
Sadly, around the country, testing 
capacity remains below where it needs 
to be. Hospitals in many States are 
over capacity in their ICUs, under-
staffed, and anxious about still loom-
ing shortages of personal protective 
equipment, or PPE. 
Six months into this pandemic, it is 
simply unconscionable that there are 
still shortages of PPE, the masks, 
gloves, and gowns we need to safely 
treat patients, protect workers and 
residents in our nursing homes, con-
fidently open our schools, and get our 
economy on the road to recovery. 
In Illinois, we have lost nearly 7,500 
lives to this disease already. With con-
cerns that the disease may get worse 
this fall, and with conditions already 
worsening as States struggle to reopen, 
I am calling on Congress and the ad-
ministration to take urgent action to 
address our immediate needs while at 
the same time preparing for the chal-
lenges that lie ahead. 
It has been nearly 10 weeks since the 
HEROES Act passed the House and was 
sent on to the Senate. States and local 
governments, hospitals and nursing 
homes, and schools and businesses need 
the aid provided by the HEROES Act. 
The Nation needs the supply chain czar 
included in the HEROES Act. We all 
need the testing capacity funded by the 
HEROES Act. 
Yet, after 10 weeks, the Senate still 
has neither taken up our legislation 
nor offered a plan of their own. Instead, 
they are delaying the Federal response 
to an urgent national crisis. 
Ending this pandemic should not be a 
partisan issue. We need to move for-
ward together, Democrats and Repub-
licans. 
That is why I am asking my col-
leagues on both sides of the aisle to 
support the COVID PREPARE Act. I 
introduced this commonsense, bipar-
tisan legislation with my colleague, 
JOHN KATKO, to assure the American 
people that their Federal Government 
is prepared to address this ever-chang-
ing public health crisis. 
This legislation would require Fed-
eral agencies to submit to Congress 
their plans for addressing COVID–19 in 
the fall, anticipating a potential in-
crease in infections and even greater 
demands on our healthcare system and 
pressure on our economy. 
The COVID PREPARE Act will pro-
vide 
bipartisan 
oversight 
and 
full 
transparency into both the planning 
and execution of our national response. 
We all certainly hope for the best, but 
we must responsibly prepare for the 
worst. 
f 
HONORING COLONEL CHARLES 
POWELL 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Texas (Mr. CONAWAY) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. CONAWAY. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to honor the life of my friend, 
Colonel Charles Powell, who passed 
away peacefully on July 2, 2020, in his 
home in San Angelo, Texas, at the age 
of 89. 
Charles was a true American hero 
who devoted his life to serving others, 
and his passing is a loss that will un-
derstandably reverberate throughout 
the community. His genuine love for 
God and others, dedication to his fam-
ily, and service to his country and 
community set the gold standard of ex-
cellence that we should all strive for. 
Although he is leaving this Earth, his 
legacy will live on through countless 
lives he has impacted during his life-
time. 
Charlie was born in Nashville, Arkan-
sas, on May 7, 1931, where he grew up 
and met his future wife, JoAnne. The 
two graduated together from Nashville 
High School in 1949. 
Charles went on to attend the United 
States Naval Academy in Annapolis, 
Maryland, and graduated, in 1954, with 
a bachelor’s degree in general engineer-
ing. He was then commissioned into 
the United States Air Force and 
launched his 30-year career in military 
service. 
After graduating from pilot training, 
Charles took to the skies, supporting 
transatlantic and transpacific deploy-
ments of tactical forces; refueling mis-
sions supporting reconnaissance activi-
ties in the Cuban Missile Crisis; and, fi-
nally, volunteering to serve in Vietnam 
as a rescue crew commander and air-
borne mission commander. He also par-
ticipated in the planning and execution 
of the Son Tay POW camp raid. 
Over the course of his career as a 
pilot, Colonel Powell logged over 67,000 
flying hours, flew 168 combat missions, 
is credited with 14 combat saves, and 
was awarded a multitude of military 
honors. 
In addition to flying missions, Colo-
nel Powell served in a variety of lead-
ership capacities in the Air Force, from 
flight instructor of the Air Command 
and Staff College, chief of staff of Air 
University, and, finally, the wing com-
mander of the technical training wing 
at Goodfellow Air Force Base in San 
Angelo, Texas. 
At the center of Charlie’s world was 
JoAnne, and their love story is one for 
the ages. From meeting in grade school 
to graduating high school together and 
raising 
their 
daughter, 
Terri, 
as 
Charles’ missions took him around the 
globe, their commitment to each other 
never wavered. 
San Angelo was forever changed 
when these two spitfires flew into town 
in 1980. Charles was appointed as the 
wing commander at Goodfellow Air 
Force Base, which was slated for clo-
sure at the time. Charles and JoAnne 
immediately leapt into action, devel-
oping the relationship between Good-
fellow and the community of San An-
gelo and completely transforming the 
mission of the base. After Charles’ 4 
years as wing commander, Goodfellow 
was removed from the closure list. 
Today, the connection between the 
base and San Angelo stands as the pre-
mier example of effective military-ci-
vilian partnership. 
Thankfully, 
after 
Charlie 
retired 
from the service, the Powells never left 
San Angelo. Instead, they immediately 
set to work planting deep roots in the 
community and making San Angelo a 
better place to live. These two have 
been some of the most dedicated public 
servants our community has ever seen.

H3621 
July 22, 2020 
Through their innumerable service ini-
tiatives, they have been Goodfellow’s 
most dedicated champions who served 
as the bridge between San Angelo and 
Goodfellow. 
Through it all, Charles and JoAnne 
stood together, side by side and hand in 
hand. 
They 
transformed 
countless 
lives, not the least of which was my 
own. I had the pleasure of meeting the 
Powells when I ran for Congress in 2004, 
and in 2005, I hired JoAnne on as the 
first member of my staff. At that 
point, I could never have imagined the 
depth of the impact that Charlie and 
JoAnne would have on me, my family, 
and every member of my team over the 
years to come. 
JoAnne is the most longstanding 
member of my staff, and she and Char-
lie have seen me through the ups and 
downs, all while tirelessly serving the 
constituents of the Concho Valley. 
Within my office, JoAnne took on 
the responsibility of shepherding young 
men and women through the congres-
sional nomination process for applying 
to the United States military acad-
emies, while Charles chaired the board 
responsible for vetting and recom-
mending them to me for nomination. 
b 0945 
Their teamwork resulted in many 
young men and women from my dis-
trict receiving appointments to these 
prestigious 
institutions 
of 
higher 
learning, further extending the tradi-
tion of service to our country to future 
generations. 
I cannot put into words the immense 
honor that it has been to have Charles 
and JoAnne as a part my family. My 
wife, Suzanne, and I feel tremendously 
lucky to have the opportunity to learn 
from them and to count them among 
our closest friends. 
Colonel 
Powell 
will 
be 
greatly 
missed, and I take comfort knowing his 
legacy will continue through the peo-
ple he loved and the community he was 
so proud to call home. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman 
from Florida (Mr. YOHO). 
PUBLIC APOLOGY TO THE HONORABLE 
ALEXANDRIA OCASIO-CORTEZ 
Mr. YOHO. Mr. Speaker, I stand be-
fore you this morning to address the 
strife I injected into the already-con-
tentious Congress. 
I have worked with many Members in 
this Chamber over the past four terms, 
Members on both sides of the aisle,— 
and each of you know that I am a man 
of my word. So let me take a moment 
to address this body. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise to apologize for 
the abrupt manner of the conversation 
I had with my colleague from New 
York. It is true that we disagree on 
policies and visions for America, but 
that does not mean we should be dis-
respectful. 
Having been married for 45 years, 
with two daughters, I am very cog-
nizant of my language. The offensive 
name-calling words attributed to me 
by the press were never spoken to my 
colleagues, and if they were construed 
that way, I apologize for their mis-
understanding. 
As my colleagues know, I am pas-
sionate about those affected by pov-
erty. My wife, Carolyn, and I started 
out together at the age of 19 with noth-
ing. We did odd jobs, and we were on 
food stamps. I know the face of pov-
erty, and for a time, it was mine. That 
is why I know people in this country 
can still, with all its faults, rise up and 
succeed and not be encouraged to break 
the law. 
I will commit to each of you that I 
will conduct myself from a place of 
passion and understanding that policy 
and political disagreement be vigor-
ously debated with the knowledge that 
we approach the problems facing our 
Nation with the betterment of the 
country in mind and the people we 
serve. 
Mr. Speaker, I cannot apologize for 
my passion or for loving my God, my 
family, and my country. 
f 
THE WAY WE TREAT ONE 
ANOTHER MATTERS 
(Mr. HOYER asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I appre-
ciate the words of the gentleman from 
Florida (Mr. YOHO). They were appro-
priate because the language we use 
matters. The way we treat one another 
matters. 
Mr. YOHO needed no apology for his 
passion about poverty and for the 
downtrodden, but he ought to remem-
ber and acknowledge that the person to 
whom he spoke so inappropriately was 
one of the strongest fighters in this 
Congress for those with the least, those 
who are downtrodden, those who are 
forgotten. 
Mr. Speaker, the apology was appro-
priate. I hope that Mr. YOHO feels that 
apology sincerely, and I hope all of us 
will take a lesson to think before we 
speak so harshly to one another. 
This country is a divided country. 
There are some of us who believe that 
our Chief Executive uses harsh lan-
guage and inappropriate language di-
rected at some of our citizens. We 
ought not to replicate that conduct. 
The apology was appropriate. I know 
that 
our 
colleague, 
ALEXANDRIA 
OCASIO-CORTEZ, appreciates that apol-
ogy, but let us treat one another with 
the respect and dignity each of us de-
serves not only as a Member of this 
body, but as a human being. 
f 
RECESS 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to clause 12(a) of rule I, the Chair 
declares the House in recess until 10

PRAYER 
The Chaplain, the Reverend Patrick 
J. Conroy, offered the following prayer: 
Lord our God, thank You for giving 
us another day. 
We ask Your blessing on all the Mem-
bers of the people’s House during these 
rare days of coming together in this 
Chamber. The coronavirus has changed 
so many forms and patterns of gath-
ering, as family, community, and here 
in Congress. 
Send out Your spirit that those who 
find themselves at odds with their col-
leagues might continue the productive 
work that must be done, but which 
does not draw contentious attention, 
and address as well the issues which 
are pressing upon our Nation. Lord, 
have mercy. 
Continue to bless the men and 
women who attend to those who are 
sick—the number continuing to grow 
throughout our country. Keep our 
healthcare professionals safe and in-
spire those who labor to find treat-
ments and cures for this dangerous 
virus. 
May all that is done be for Your 
greater honor and glory. 
Amen.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H3622 
July 22, 2020 
that time, there have been more than 
50,000 new coronavirus deaths, bringing 
the total to more than 140,000 Ameri-
cans and more than 2.5 million more 
cases. Yet the Senate has done noth-
ing. 
This important legislation provides 
much-needed relief to States and cities 
experiencing lost revenue, to support 
our heroes on the front lines. 
It ensures our first responders and es-
sential workers are entitled to hazard 
pay and guarantees up to $200 billion 
for those who have risked their lives 
working during the pandemic. 
It 
expands 
testing, 
tracing, 
and 
treatment to all Americans. 
It puts money back in the pockets of 
struggling Americans with a second 
round of stimulus payments up to 
$6,000 per household. 
It preserves health coverage by pro-
tecting the more than 5.4 million 
Americans who have lost their em-
ployer-provided health insurance. 
It extends the weekly $600 Federal 
unemployment benefit through Janu-
ary, providing a vital safety net for a 
record number of Americans who are 
unemployed. Right now, that expires in 
just 9 days. 
It helps worried families afford a safe 
place to live, assisting renters and 
homeowners with rent, mortgage, and 
utility payments and other housing-re-
lated costs. 
I urge the Senate to pass this bill im-
mediately. 
f 
IN SUPPORT OF THE GREAT 
AMERICAN OUTDOORS ACT 
(Mr. GIANFORTE asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Mr. GIANFORTE. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today in support of the Great 
American Outdoors Act. 
My friend, Senator DAINES, deserves 
a lot of credit. He has successfully ad-
vanced this historic legislation, his-
toric because of its long-term dedica-
tion to our public lands. 
People from around the world come 
to 
tour 
our 
outstanding 
National 
Parks, including millions of visitors 
every year to Yellowstone and Glacier. 
Unfortunately, too many of our parks 
have fallen into disrepair. This bill be-
gins to rebuild and repair our parks. 
It is also a fitting complement to our 
successful efforts to permanently reau-
thorize the Land and Water Conserva-
tion Fund. It provides dedicated fund-
ing to increase public access to public 
lands across Montana. 
I know how important LWCF is to 
Montana, and I will continue working 
to keep public lands in public hands 
and increase access. 
I urge my colleagues to join me 
today in voting for the Great American 
Outdoors Act. 
f 
STUDENT LOAN DEBT CRISIS 
(Ms. DEAN asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.) 
Ms. DEAN. Madam Speaker, our stu-
dent loan debt crisis predates the pan-
demic. We encourage high school stu-
dents to attend college, to claim their 
education, yet too many graduates are 
shackled with a mountain of debt that 
limits their future, impedes their fi-
nancial freedom, and diminishes their 
purchasing power. The pandemic has 
only worsened this problem. 
During this pandemic, we owe it to a 
generation of debt-laden young people, 
veterans, and transitioning adults to 
take bold action, to pass meaningful 
debt forgiveness. Freeing up the ability 
to claim an education without crushing 
debt will be a relief to so many Ameri-
cans and our economy. 
An educated public should enrich us 
all, not create unsustainable debt. So I 
call upon this body to pass bold and 
meaningful debt forgiveness for mil-
lions of bright young people so that 
their futures are determined not by the 
debt they incurred but by the knowl-
edge they gained. 
f 
NATIONAL FRAGILE X 
AWARENESS DAY 
(Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania 
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend his remarks.) 
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today on Na-
tional Fragile X Awareness Day to 
raise awareness of this genetic dis-
order. 
Fragile X is caused by mutations in 
the 
gene 
known 
as 
FMR1. 
These 
mutations can result in behavioral, de-
velopmental, cognitive, and reproduc-
tive conditions, often leading to de-
layed development of speech and lan-
guage. In the most severe cases, fragile 
X 
can 
cause 
potentially 
fatal 
neurodegenerative conditions. 
Fragile X syndrome affects an esti-
mated 100,000 Americans. But more 
than 1 million Americans have a vari-
ation of the fragile X mutation, mean-
ing they either have or are at risk of 
developing one of the associated condi-
tions. 
This means each Member of this 
House, on average, represents 230 con-
stituents living with fragile X syn-
drome, and countless more parents, 
grandparents, siblings, and caregivers 
love someone with fragile X. 
Each person living with fragile X 
syndrome, and any other intellectual 
and developmental disability, makes 
our world a better place. 
f 
EXTENDING UNEMPLOYMENT 
BENEFITS 
(Mr. TAKANO asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. TAKANO. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today because supplemental Federal 
unemployment benefits expire next 
week, and Republicans in the Senate 
refuse to extend these benefits for the 
American people. 
Average daily expenses are weighing 
heavily on millions of families as our 
economy struggles and unemployment 
is at a record high, with over 17 million 
still unemployed. 
Rent is due, bills are due, loan pay-
ments are due, but people are still out 
of 
work. 
Americans 
are 
fighting 
against financial hardships and the 
housing affordability crisis. Failure to 
extend unemployment benefits in the 
midst of this pandemic would be cruel 
and inhumane. It would cause financial 
ruin for millions who are already 
struggling. 
Our communities need the additional 
$600 weekly unemployment benefits. It 
could be the difference between getting 
evicted or making rent for another 
month. 
I urge the Senate to pass the HE-
ROES Act to extend Federal unemploy-
ment benefits. Millions of Americans 
are depending on it. 
f 
IN SUPPORT OF THE CITIZENS OF 
JAMMU AND KASHMIR 
(Mr. WATKINS asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. WATKINS. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today in support of democracy 
around the world and, in particular, in 
Jammu and Kashmir. 
The human rights violations there 
are already alarming. And now with 
COVID–19 plaguing the world, people 
there and everywhere must have access 
to the tools necessary to fight this dis-
ease. 
As 
telecommunication 
blackouts, 
suppression of media reports, human 
rights abuses, and mass detentions con-
tinue in Jammu and Kashmir, COVID– 
19 concerns are amplified. There have 
already been disturbing reports that 
PPE and critical equipment are being 
blocked from entering the region. 
Without 
adequate 
resources 
and 
internet access, hospitals and medical 
centers don’t stand a chance. And lives 
being lost are lost to the world. 
I urge the global community and ac-
tors in the region to work together to 
ensure that citizens of Jammu and 
Kashmir have access to the care, serv-
ices, and resources needed to defeat 
this disease. 
f 
IN SUPPORT OF THE NO BAN ACT 
(Mr. CARSON of Indiana asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute.) 
Mr. CARSON of Indiana. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today in support of the 
NO BAN Act, which I was honored to 
coauthor. I urge my colleagues to 
swiftly pass this landmark legislation 
today. 
More than 3 years ago, President 
Donald Trump’s Muslim ban put into 
action the xenophobic and racist agen-
da that he promised during his cam-
paign.

July 22, 2020 
It immediately led to chaos at our 
airports, where I was honored to stand 
in solidarity with our incoming immi-
grants and those cruelly ripped apart 
from their families. 
The Muslim ban became the corner-
stone of President Trump’s dangerous 
agenda. It has made America less re-
spected around the world. And our 
country is not any safer. 
This isn’t the only time America has 
shamefully shut our doors based on 
race, ethnicity, or nationality. But we 
can make it the last time. 
That is why we must pass the NO 
BAN Act and end the Muslim ban and 
make sure history does not repeat 
itself. I urge my colleagues to support 
this legislation today.

THE WORDS OF A BLACK POLICE 
OFFICER 
(Mr. JOHNSON of Ohio asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and 
extend his remarks.) 
Mr. 
JOHNSON 
of 
Ohio. 
Madam 
Speaker, for those wondering what it is 
like to be a Black police officer amid 
the violent demonstrations that con-
tinue in cities across our country, con-
sider what Portland Police Officer 
Jakhary Jackson said about the rioters 
in his own words. 
‘‘It’s been very eye-opening. It says 
something when you’re at a Black 
Lives Matter protest and you have 
more minorities on the police side than 
you have in a violent crowd, and you 
have White people screaming at Black 
officers.’’ 
Let me repeat Officer Jackson’s 
words once more, because you will not 
hear any of this from our national 
media. Once again, here are the words 
of a Black police officer facing a vio-
lent mob of predominantly White anar-
chists. 
‘‘It’s been very eye-opening. It says 
something when you’re at a Black 
Lives Matter protest and you have 
more minorities on the police side than 
you have in a violent crowd, and you 
have White people screaming at Black 
officers.’’ 
f 
FEDERAL OFFICERS IN PORTLAND 
(Mr. BLUMENAUER asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
his remarks.) 
Mr. BLUMENAUER. Madam Speaker, 
it was sad to hear my colleague with 
his recent comments. Let me tell you 
what it is like on the ground in Port-
land. 
This is a serious problem in Oregon 
where people are attempting to peace-
fully demonstrate their opposition to a 
whole range of racist practices by law 
enforcement. There are, to be sure, oc-
casionally a few people who are doing 
things that they shouldn’t, and they 
should be arrested, tried, and con-
victed. But the vast majority of people 
are peaceful. 
And it is no fault, frankly, of what 
has happened with the Trump adminis-
tration, who have moved in with what 
can only be described as an occupying 
force, making the situation worse. 
They were unwanted, unwelcome, and 
unprepared. Nonetheless, they have 
moved in, been involved with episodes 
that people can watch on YouTube, 
where peaceful demonstrators were at-
tacked. 
One of my constituents, asking a 
simple question, was beaten with a 
baton, breaking his wrist, and pepper 
sprayed in the face. This is outrageous. 
This is a made-for-TV initiative by the 
Trump administration and should stop.

PROVIDING 
ASSISTANCE 
TO 
SMALL DEFENSE MANUFACTUR-
ERS 
(Mr. WILSON of South Carolina 
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend his remarks.) 
Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. 
Madam Speaker, I am grateful that the 
House Armed Services Committee in-
cluded my amendment, the Small Man-
ufacturer Cybersecurity Enhancement 
Act, in the National Defense Author-
ization Act, which passed yesterday by 
bipartisan vote. 
This crucial amendment will provide 
much-needed assistance to small de-
fense manufacturers with cyber com-
pliance, and it will enhance the cyber-
security through our defense supply 
chain by expanding DOD cyber initia-
tives with the manufacturing extension 
partnership centers. The MEP national 
network is ideally situated to assist 
the Department to help strengthen our 
national defense. 
This bipartisan legislation was sup-
ported unanimously by all members of 
the House Armed Services Committee. 
It is especially important to the com-
munities I represent adjacent to the 
Army Cyber Command at Fort Gordon. 
The potential to create jobs is encour-
aged. 
In conclusion, God bless our troops, 
and we will never forget September the 
11th in the global war on terrorism.

RECOGNIZING ESCALATION OF VI-
OLENCE 
ALONG 
ARMENIAN-AZ-
ERBAIJANI BORDER 
(Mr. COSTA asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. COSTA. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to call attention to the esca-
lating violence that is occurring in the 
Armenian-Azerbaijani border. 
Beginning July 12, the Azeri soldiers 
approached the Armenian border, a 
place that has been one of contention, 
and opened fired on Armenian civilians 
in the Tavush Province. 
Since then, the conflict, sadly, has 
escalated. The Azeri armed forces have 
been indiscriminate in attacking Ar-
menian schools and factories, factories 
producing personal protective equip-
ment that is essential during this pan-
demic. 
Azerbaijan must be held accountable. 
In the midst of this global pandemic, 
where supplies and resources are al-
ready stretched, it is critical now more 
than ever that we work toward peace 
with Artsakh. 
We must reevaluate the U.S. security 
assistance to Azerbaijan immediately— 
they are not being appropriate in their 
actions—as well as increase aid to Ar-
menia to counter Azeri aggression. 
In the appropriations bill yesterday, 
a $20 million augmentation was made 
to the country of Armenia. I urge my 
colleagues to support that and urge im-
mediate 
action 
condemning 
Azer-
baijan’s disgraceful actions.

RECOGNIZING RADIO STATION 
WHUB 
(Mr. ROSE of Tennessee asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute.) 
Mr. ROSE of Tennessee. Madam 
Speaker, on July 20, 1940, Judge Luke 
Medley started a small radio station in 
Cookeville, Tennessee, my hometown. 
And for the last 80 years, WHUB 
Newstalk 101.7 and 1400, the Hub, has 
stood the test of time and been a haven 
for community events and local news. 
WHUB’s motto is: ‘‘Where commu-
nity always comes first.’’ They have al-
ways implemented that motto for the 
citizens of the Upper Cumberland in 
Tennessee, 
and 
they 
always 
will. 
WHUB has been the winner of numer-
ous awards in the last 80 years from the 
State of Tennessee and the National 
Association of Broadcasters. 
Congratulations to owner Jerry Zim-
mer, 
program 
director 
Brent 
Carl 
Fleshman, news director Shawn Ja-
cobs, and general manager John Monk 
for their constant hard work to keep 
WHUB the number one news talk radio 
station in the Upper Cumberland. 
Happy 80th anniversary to WHUB. 
God bless Tennessee, and God bless 
America.

LAUNCHING JUSTICE IN POLICING 
WEBSITE 
(Mr. HOYER asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. HOYER. Madam Speaker, it has 
been nearly 4 weeks since the House 
passed the George Floyd Justice in Po-
licing Act. Leader MCCONNELL and the 
Republican-led Senate, however, refuse 
to call it up for consideration or a vote. 
Meanwhile, the problem of racial injus-
tice is not going away on its own. 
For millions of Americans, this issue 
is deeply personal, having experienced 
racial bias in our justice system first-
hand. Most police officers, Madam 
Speaker, are trying hard to do their job

professionally and serve their commu-
nities well, and there are so many ex-
emplary officers committed to address-
ing head-on the inherent bias and the 
problems in the culture of policing that 
lead some to commit acts of mis-
conduct. 
Still, millions of people live in fear 
simply because of the color of their 
skin and because of the history of po-
lice misconduct against African Ameri-
cans in our country. 
Madam Speaker, we must never ac-
cept this norm. Indeed, in his last pub-
lic appearance, John Lewis visited 
Black Lives Matter Plaza in Wash-
ington and then encouraged Americans 
to stand up for social justice. He said 
this: ‘‘We must continue to be bold, 
brave, courageous, push and pull till we 
redeem the soul of America and move 
closer to a community at peace with 
itself.’’ 
His wise words continue to inspire 
Americans to be courageous in stand-
ing up, speaking out, and working to 
lift our country up to the highest of 
our ideals. 
In order to make sure that all voices 
are being heard in Congress and in this 
national 
discourse, 
I 
launched 
a 
website to make it easier for Ameri-
cans to share their own stories, learn 
about the legislation we passed, and 
share their thoughts on our bill. It is a 
platform for people to contribute to 
this work of redeeming the soul of 
America, as John Lewis urged us to do. 
That site is JusticeinPolicing.us. 
Already, Madam Speaker, thousands 
of Americans from nearly every State 
have visited the site, and many have 
shared their own wrenching stories 
about why we need to pass this bill. 
One woman in my district wrote 
about how, as the mother of 2 young 
Black men, she worries every day 
about them encountering the police. 
That should not be the case in Amer-
ica. That isn’t good for families. It 
isn’t good for the police. It isn’t good 
for our communities. And as I said, it 
is not good for our country. 
Another wrote about how her elderly 
parents were pulled over in Oklahoma 
because the officer couldn’t believe 
that her African-American father was 
married to her White mother. Both 
were in their eighties. That was just 3 
years ago. 
One person from Iowa posted about 
being a lifelong Republican who is 
tired of her party’s failure to tackle po-
lice misconduct and systemic racism in 
our country. That person is right. And 
it is not Republicans alone whom I am 
sure she is concerned with. 
The Senate could act today on the 
George Floyd Justice in Policing Act. 
The Senate ought to act today. But it 
is sitting on Leader MCCONNELL’s desk 
or someplace else gathering dust while 
our site continues to gather stories of 
real lives impacted by these injustices. 
Madam Speaker, I hope Americans 
will continue to speak out and give 
compelling and concrete examples of 
why action is necessary. 
And I might say, we need to speak 
out on the extraordinarily good actions 
that are taken by our law enforcement 
officers as well. We need to be bal-
anced. But we do not need to be bal-
anced to the extent of ignoring the car-
nage that has occurred because of the 
color of skin. These stories need to be 
told. 
In his very powerful New York Times 
column last month on the five crises 
facing America at this moment in our 
history, the extraordinarily insightful 
David Brooks wrote: ‘‘All Americans, 
but especially White Americans, are 
undergoing a rapid education on the 
burdens African Americans carry every 
day. This education,’’ he said, ‘‘is con-
tinuing, but already, public opinion is 
shifting with astonishing speed.’’ It is 
right that it does so. 
The more we hear of the stories of 
personal experiences with systemic 
bias, the better equipped we will be as 
a Nation to confront this challenge to-
gether. 
As 
more 
people 
visit 
JusticeinPolicing.us to speak up and 
support this bill, I will be sharing their 
names and stories with this House and 
its Members, making sure that Mem-
bers hear from their constituents on 
this issue. 
We are the people’s House. We are the 
people’s voice. We are the protectors of 
democracy, yes, of our Constitution 
and our laws, but the soul and char-
acter of our country are in our hands 
as well. 
As long as people of color continue to 
face dangerous and deadly systemic 
bias in our country, we will not stop 
pushing for the reforms that are so 
sorely needed.

Commissioner of Food and Drugs withdrew 
the approval of the application for the listed 
drug or reference product or placed the listed 
drug or reference product on the discon-
tinued products list and the manufacturer 
marketed or sold a follow-on product. 
‘‘(ii) The manufacturer of the listed drug 
or reference product— 
‘‘(I)(aa) announced withdrawal of, dis-
continuance of the manufacture of, or intent 
to withdraw the application with respect to 
the drug or reference product in a manner 
that impedes competition from a generic 
drug or a biosimilar biological product, as 
established by objective circumstances; or 
‘‘(bb) destroyed the inventory of the listed 
drug or reference product in a manner that 
impedes competition from a generic drug or 
a biosimilar biological product, which may 
be established by objective circumstances; 
and 
‘‘(II) marketed or sold a follow-on product. 
‘‘(B) The manufacturer engaged in a soft 
switch, which shall be established by dem-
onstrating that the manufacturer engaged in 
both of the following actions: 
‘‘(i) The manufacturer took actions with 
respect to the listed drug or reference prod-
uct other than those described in subpara-
graph (A) that unfairly disadvantage the 
listed drug or reference product relative to 
the follow-on product described in clause (ii) 
in a manner that impedes competition from 
a generic drug or a biosimilar biological 
product that is highly similar to, and has no 
clinically meaningful difference with respect 
to safety, purity, and potency from, the ref-
erence product, which may be established by 
objective circumstances. 
‘‘(ii) The manufacturer marketed or sold a 
follow-on product. 
‘‘(2) JUSTIFICATION.— 
‘‘(A) IN
GENERAL.—Subject to paragraph 
(3), the actions described in paragraph (1) by 
a manufacturer of a listed drug or reference 
product shall not be considered to be an un-
fair method of competition in or affecting 
commerce if— 
‘‘(i) the manufacturer demonstrates to the 
Commission or a district court of the United 
States, as applicable, by a preponderance of 
the evidence in a proceeding initiated by the 
Commission under subsection (c)(1)(A), or in 
a suit brought under subparagraph (B) or (C) 
of subsection (c)(1), that— 
‘‘(I) the manufacturer would have taken 
the actions regardless of whether a generic 
drug that references the listed drug or bio-
similar biological product that references 
the reference product had already entered 
the market; and 
‘‘(II)(aa) with respect to a hard switch 
under paragraph (1)(A), the manufacturer 
took the action for reasons relating to the 
safety risk to patients of the listed drug or 
reference product; 
‘‘(bb) with respect to an action described in 
item (aa) or (bb) of paragraph (1)(A)(ii)(I), 
there is a supply disruption that— 
‘‘(AA) is outside of the control of the man-
ufacturer; 
‘‘(BB) prevents the production or distribu-
tion of the applicable listed drug or reference 
product; and 
‘‘(CC) cannot be remedied by reasonable ef-
forts; or 
‘‘(cc) with respect to a soft switch under 
paragraph (1)(B), the manufacturer had le-
gitimate 
pro-competitive 
reasons, 
apart 
from the financial effects of reduced com-
petition, to take the action. 
‘‘(B) RULE
OF
CONSTRUCTION.—Nothing in 
subparagraph (A) may be construed to limit 
the information that the Commission may 
otherwise obtain in any proceeding or action 
instituted with respect to a violation of this 
section. 
‘‘(3) RESPONSE.—With respect to a jus-
tification offered by a manufacturer under 
paragraph (2), the Commission may— 
‘‘(A) rebut any evidence presented by a 
manufacturer during that justification; or 
‘‘(B) establish by a preponderance of the 
evidence that, on balance, the pro-competi-
tive benefits from the conduct described in 
subparagraph (A) or (B) of paragraph (1), as 
applicable, 
do 
not 
outweigh 
any 
anti-
competitive effects of the conduct, even in 
consideration of the justification so offered. 
‘‘(c) ENFORCEMENT.— 
‘‘(1) IN
GENERAL.—If the Commission has 
reason to believe that any manufacturer has 
violated, is violating, or is about to violate 
this section, the Commission may take any 
of the following actions: 
‘‘(A) Institute a proceeding— 
‘‘(i) that, except as provided in paragraph 
(2), complies with the requirements under 
section 5(b); and 
‘‘(ii) in which the Commission may impose 
on the manufacturer any penalty that the 
Commission may impose for a violation of 
section 5. 
‘‘(B) In the same manner and to the same 
extent as provided in section 13(b), bring suit 
in a district court of the United States to 
temporarily enjoin the action of the manu-
facturer. 
‘‘(C) Bring suit in a district court of the 
United States, in which the Commission may 
seek— 
‘‘(i) to permanently enjoin the action of 
the manufacturer; 
‘‘(ii) any of the remedies described in para-
graph (3); and 
‘‘(iii) any other equitable remedy, includ-
ing ancillary equitable relief. 
‘‘(2) JUDICIAL REVIEW.— 
‘‘(A) IN
GENERAL.—Notwithstanding any 
provision of section 5, any manufacturer 
that is subject to a final order of the Com-
mission that is issued in a proceeding insti-
tuted under paragraph (1)(A) may, not later 
than 30 days after the date on which the 
Commission issues the order, petition for re-
view of the order in— 
‘‘(i) the United States Court of Appeals for 
the District of Columbia Circuit; or 
‘‘(ii) the court of appeals of the United 
States for the circuit in which the ultimate 
parent entity of the manufacturer is incor-
porated. 
‘‘(B) TREATMENT OF FINDINGS.—In a review 
of an order issued by the Commission con-
ducted by a court of appeals of the United 
States under subparagraph (A), the factual 
findings of the Commission shall be conclu-
sive if those facts are supported by the evi-
dence. 
‘‘(3) EQUITABLE REMEDIES.— 
‘‘(A) DISGORGEMENT.— 
‘‘(i) IN GENERAL.—In a suit brought under 
paragraph (1)(C), the Commission may seek, 
and the court may order, disgorgement of 
any unjust enrichment that a person ob-
tained as a result of the violation that gives 
rise to the suit. 
‘‘(ii)

sion may seek disgorgement under this sub-
paragraph not later than 5 years after the 
latest date on which the person from which

tion that gives rise to the suit in which the 
Commission seeks the disgorgement. 
‘‘(B) RESTITUTION.—

SEC. 203. TITLE 35 AMENDMENTS. 
(a) IN GENERAL.—Section 271(e) of title 35, 
United States Code, is amended— 
(1) in paragraph (2)(C), in the flush text fol-
lowing clause (ii), by adding at the end the 
following: ‘‘With respect to a submission de-
scribed in clause (ii), the act of infringement 
shall extend to any patent that claims the 
biological product, a method of using the bi-
ological product, or a method or product 
used to manufacture the biological prod-
uct.’’; and 
(2) by adding at the end the following: 
‘‘(7)(A) Subject to subparagraphs (C), (D), 
and (E), if the sponsor of an approved appli-
cation for a reference product, as defined in 
section 351(i) of the Public Health Service 
Act (42 U.S.C. 262(i)) (referred to in this para-
graph as the ‘reference product sponsor’), 
brings an action for infringement under this 
section against an applicant for approval of 
a biological product under section 351(k) of 
such Act that references that reference prod-
uct (referred to in this paragraph as the ‘sub-
section (k) applicant’), the reference product 
sponsor may assert in the action a total of 
not more than 20 patents of the type de-
scribed in subparagraph (B), not more than 
10 of which shall have issued after the date 
specified in section 351(l)(7)(A) of such Act. 
‘‘(B) The patents described in this subpara-
graph are patents that satisfy each of the 
following requirements: 
‘‘(i) Patents that claim the biological prod-
uct that is the subject of an application 
under section 351(k) of the Public Health 
Service Act (42 U.S.C. 262(k)) (or a use of 
that product) or a method or product used in 
the manufacture of such biological product. 
‘‘(ii) Patents that are included on the list 
of patents described in section 351(l)(3)(A) of 
the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 
262(l)(3)(A)), including as provided under sec-
tion 351(l)(7) of such Act. 
‘‘(iii) Patents that— 
‘‘(I) have an actual filing date of more than 
4 years after the date on which the reference 
product is approved; or 
‘‘(II) include a claim to a method in a man-
ufacturing process that is not used by the 
reference product sponsor. 
‘‘(C) The court in which an action de-
scribed in subparagraph (A) is brought may 
increase the number of patents limited under 
that subparagraph— 
‘‘(i) if the request to increase that number 
is made without undue delay; and 
‘‘(ii)(I) if the interest of justice so requires; 
or 
‘‘(II) for good cause shown, which— 
‘‘(aa) shall be established if the subsection 
(k) applicant fails to provide information re-
quired under section 351(l)(2)(A) of the Public 
Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 262(l)(2)(A)) 
that would enable the reference product 
sponsor to form a reasonable belief with re-
spect to whether a claim of infringement 
under this section could reasonably be as-
serted; and 
‘‘(bb) may be established— 
‘‘(AA) if there is a material change to the 
biological product (or process with respect to 
the biological product) of the subsection (k) 
applicant that is the subject of the applica-
tion; 
‘‘(BB) if, with respect to a patent on the 
supplemental 
list 
described 
in 
section 
351(l)(7)(A) of Public Health Service Act (42 
U.S.C. 262(l)(7)(A)), the patent would have 
issued before the date specified in such sec-
tion 351(l)(7)(A) but for the failure of the Of-
fice to issue the patent or a delay in the 
issuance of the patent, as described in para-
graph (1) of section 154(b) and subject to the 
limitations under paragraph (2) of such sec-
tion 154(b); or 
‘‘(CC) for another reason that shows good 
cause, as determined appropriate by the 
court. 
‘‘(D) In determining whether good cause 
has been shown for the purposes of subpara-
graph (C)(ii)(II), a court may consider wheth-
er the reference product sponsor has pro-
vided a reasonable description of the iden-
tity and relevance of any information be-
yond the subsection (k) application that the 
court believes is necessary to enable the 
court to form a belief with respect to wheth-

paragraph (A)—

applicant completes all actions required 
under 
paragraphs 
(2)(A), 
(3)(B)(ii), 
(5), 
(6)(C)(i), (7), and (8)(A) of section 351(l) of the 
Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 262(l));

application 
submitted 
under 
section 
351(k) of the Public Health Service Act (42 
U.S.C. 262(k)) on or after the date of enact-
ment of this Act. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. This 
portion shall be debatable for 1 hour, 
equally divided and controlled by the 
chair and ranking minority member of 
the Committee on the Judiciary. 
The gentlewoman from Washington 
(Ms. JAYAPAL) and the gentleman from 
Arizona (Mr. BIGGS) each will control 
30 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from Washington. 
b 1030 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Ms. JAYAPAL. Madam Speaker, I 
ask unanimous consent that all Mem-
bers may have 5 legislative days in 
which to revise and extend their re-
marks and insert extraneous material 
on H.R. 2486. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from Washington? 
There was no objection. 
Ms. JAYAPAL. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today to bring 
forward the No BAN Act amendment, 
and I thank Congresswoman CHU for 
her leadership on this bill. 
In January 2017, President Trump 
issued 
the 
first 
Muslim 
ban, 
a 
xenophobic policy that has inflicted ir-
reparable harm on Muslims here at 
home and around the world, a policy 
that says to Muslims that they are not 
to be trusted. This is hurtful, harmful 
to our global relationships, and deeply 
untrue. 
When the ban was implemented, I 
rushed to the Seattle airport along 
with Chairman NADLER in New York 
City. We joined thousands of people in 
protest. Thanks to these efforts, we 
successfully secured the release in Se-
attle of two individuals. But the chaos 
and the pain that the ban cast upon 
American citizens, lawful residents, 
and international visitors can never 
truly be undone. 
Today, new iterations of the Muslim 
ban and the most recent African ban 
have kept families separated; Amer-
ican businesses and research institu-
tions can’t recruit the best minds from 
abroad; and our Nation’s doors are 
closed to people seeking safety from vi-
olence, war, and persecution. 
The bans have hurt our relationships 
with other countries, harmed refugees, 
isolated us from our allies, and given 
extremists propaganda for recruitment. 
Most important, they do not make our 
country safer. 
And let’s be clear: A pandemic is not 
the 
time 
to 
push 
forward 
these 
xenophobic bans. 
Citizens from Muslim-majority na-
tions made up 4.5 percent of the U.S. 
physician workforce in 2019; and yet, 
between 2016 and 2018, the number of 
applicants to the Educational Commis-
sion for Foreign Medical Graduates 
from Muslim-majority countries de-
creased by 15 percent, a decrease that 
exacerbates existing gaps in the U.S. 
physician workforce which is so des-
perately needed in a time of COVID–19. 
It is time to pass the No BAN Act to 
repeal President Trump’s bans and stop 
any 
future 
President 
from 
imple-
menting discriminatory bans that send 
the 
repugnant 
message 
that 
our 
foundational values of freedom of reli-
gion and liberty and justice for all do 
not apply. 
Today is historic, as the No BAN Act 
is the first bill to pass the House that 
directly addresses Muslim civil rights. 
And we would not be here today with-
out the courage of Muslims and allies 
across the country, especially the very 
important people at Muslim Advocates 
who work to repudiate the Muslim ban 
and move Congress to action. 
This bill sends an important message 
to Muslims everywhere that America 
believes in liberty and welcomes people 
regardless of race or religion. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time, and I ask unanimous 
consent that the gentleman from New 
York (Mr. NADLER) control the remain-
der of that time.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H3629 
July 22, 2020 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from Washington? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. BIGGS. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
I rise in opposition to this amend-
ment to H.R. 2486. The majority is ac-
tually playing procedural games here 
by including a nongermane provision 
to satisfy certain requirements. 
The two immigration bills that we 
are considering today are expensive, 
make no doubt about it. According to 
the CBO, the NO BAN Act will increase 
direct spending by $290 million over the 
next 10 years and increase deficits by 
$307 million over the same period. And 
a preliminary estimate from CBO notes 
that the Access to Counsel Act, which 
we will debate later today, will in-
crease discretionary spending by at 
least $1 billion over the next 5 years. 
So the majority had to come up with 
a pay-for. They opted for prescription 
drug legislation, but chose to discard 
bipartisan committee past text to in-
stead include a flawed prescription bill 
that will stifle investment and re-
search, prevent new medications from 
coming to market, block truthful ad-
vertising, and disincentivize improve-
ments in patient care. 
This 
Congress 
has 
unanimously 
passed six bipartisan bills out of com-
mittee to address the costs of prescrip-
tion drugs. But today, instead of using 
bipartisan-negotiated text, my col-
leagues across the aisle have made pre-
scription drugs a partisan issue in an 
effort to pass partisan immigration 
bills. 
Our President has consistently taken 
decisive action to help ensure the secu-
rity of our immigration programs and, 
thus, the safety of our country. Every 
time he does so, my Democratic friends 
cry foul. They attempt to block the 
President’s actions and threaten to 
take away the President’s power. 
The Department of Homeland Secu-
rity has identified several types of in-
formation that it needs in order to 
make a reliable decision regarding the 
admissibility of a foreign country’s na-
tionals seeking entry to the United 
States. This includes things like: 
Does the country report lost or sto-
len identity documents, including pass-
ports, to Interpol, and how often do 
they do so? 
Does the country share information 
about their known or suspected terror-
ists or about their criminals with us? 
Does the country issue modern elec-
tronic passports? 
These are clearly important things to 
know when determining whether to let 
a foreign national enter our country. 
Instead of expressing appreciation for 
what this President has been able to 
accomplish with regard to security, my 
colleagues have decided to consider 
this No BAN Act, which effectively 
eviscerates the ability of the adminis-
tration to take quick and decisive ac-
tion to protect our homeland when 
concerns arise, even action to prevent 
entry of aliens based on a global health 
crisis like COVID–19. 
Until the President signed the first 
travel executive order in January of 
2017, very few had ever heard of the Im-
migration and Nationality Act section 
212(f) authority. This provision pro-
vides the President broad latitude to 
impose restrictions on the entry of 
aliens or classes of aliens into the 
United States when such entry ‘‘would 
be detrimental to the interests of the 
United States.’’ And this authority has 
been used successfully by Presidents 
Ronald Reagan, Barack Obama, and 
others. 
Pursuant to the travel executive 
order, the President required the Sec-
retary of DHS and Secretary of State, 
along with the Director of National In-
telligence to determine what countries 
failed to meet international standards 
of information sharing or identity 
management or were at a risk of ter-
rorism or public safety concern and to 
report their findings to him. 
Based on that assessment and the 
recommendations of the Secretaries, 
the President placed travel restrictions 
on seven nations. Pursuant to the con-
tinued review of countries and an up-
dated report in January, the President 
issued a proclamation imposing nar-
rowly tailored travel restrictions on 
six additional countries: Burma, Eri-
trea, Kyrgyzstan, Nigeria, Sudan, and 
Tanzania. 
It is important to understand that 
such restrictions are not permanent. 
When a country comes into compliance 
with the information sharing and other 
requirements, they can be removed 
from the list of restricted countries, 
and that has actually happened under 
this administration, for instance, Chad 
in 2018. And press reports note that the 
Government of Nigeria immediately 
began working to come into compli-
ance. 
The President’s use of 212(f) author-
ity has helped improve our security 
and the vetting of foreign nationals 
seeking entry into the United States. 
As the DHS Assistant Secretary for 
Threat Prevention and Security Policy 
testified last September: ‘‘One country 
reinstituted a dormant program to help 
identify convicted criminals. Three 
countries have adopted more secure e- 
Passports. Two countries obtained ac-
cess to Interpol databases for the first 
time. And eight countries began re-
porting lost and stolen passports to 
Interpol for the first time or they im-
proved the regularity of that report-
ing.’’ 
These are not insignificant improve-
ments to the world’s security. The No 
BAN Act would take 212(f) authority 
from the elected President and give it 
to an unelected subordinate who is not 
accountable to voters. 
Under this bill, only the Secretary of 
State can determine that the entry of 
aliens is a threat to the U.S. This is 
problematic in instances where other 
Cabinet officials should be involved, 
such as Health and Human Services or 
Treasury. 
The bill’s undefined and broad terms, 
‘‘least restrictive means’’ and the ‘‘no-
tion of harm,’’ are ripe for litigation, 
especially considering the bill’s expan-
sive judicial review provision and ex-
plicit class action allowance. 
The No BAN Act also contains oner-
ous reporting requirements, consulta-
tion with Congress before the President 
can act, and Federal Register publica-
tion of information about the action 
taken and the circumstances necessi-
tating the action. But does it make 
sense for the U.S. Government to 
broadcast the deficiencies they have 
identified since those would likely be 
exploited by bad actors seeking to do 
us harm? 
Perhaps the most ridiculous of the 
bill’s provisions is section 4, which not 
only terminates the travel executive 
orders in place but, incredibly, ceases 
all actions taken pursuant to any proc-
lamation or executive order termi-
nated by the bill. That means that in-
formation sharing on terrorists, crimi-
nals, and other security threats that 
has developed between the United 
States and other countries with travel 
restrictions would end. 
This bill is a knee-jerk response by 
my Democratic colleagues because of 
the disapprobation of President Trump, 
and it would undermine the safety and 
security of Americans. 
I urge my colleagues to oppose the 
No BAN Act, and I reserve the balance 
of my time. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, H.R. 2214, the Na-
tional Origin-Based Antidiscrimination 
for Nonimmigrants Act, or the No BAN 
Act, is critical legislation that will 
stop executive overreach, defend Con-
gress’ role in establishing our Nation’s 
immigration laws, and right one of the 
original sins of the Trump administra-
tion: the Muslim ban. 
When 
the 
Trump 
administration 
issued its first version of the ban in 
January 2017, it was immediately ap-
parent that it was unconstitutional, 
discriminatory, and morally reprehen-
sible. Its chaotic rollout only mag-
nified the cruelty underlying this pol-
icy. 
When news first broke that people 
were being detained at the airports, I 
immediately rushed to JFK Airport 
that morning along with Congress-
woman VELA´ ZQUEZ. Within hours, we 
were joined by hundreds of demonstra-
tors demanding justice. What we found 
was chaos and heartbreak. Refugees, 
people with valid visas, and even legal 
permanent residents, people who had 
assisted American troops and saved 
their lives in Iraq were prevented from 
entering the country or even speaking 
with their attorneys. 
We met people like Hameed Khalid 
Darweesh, an Iraqi who put his life on 
the line for 10 years to work with 
American and coalition forces as a

Special Immigrant Visa granted to 
people who assist our military in Iraq 
and Afghanistan. In return for his ef-
forts, this hero was welcomed to the 
United States with a door slammed in 
his face and a grueling ordeal at the 
airport as he pleaded for his freedom. 
I am pleased that Congresswoman 
VELA´ ZQUEZ and I were able to work 
with officials in New York and Wash-
ington to secure his release eventually, 
but we should never have had to do 
that. That is not the country we are 
proud to represent in Congress. We do 
not betray those who save American 
troops. 
Although the President’s initial Mus-
lim ban was ultimately blocked by nu-
merous courts, in 2018, after protracted 
litigation and several court injunc-
tions, the Supreme Court unfortu-
nately upheld the third version of the 
ban, Presidential Proclamation 9645. 
The Court reached this decision 
based on its broad reading of section 
212(f) of the Immigration and Nation-
ality Act, which authorizes the Presi-
dent to ‘‘suspend the entry of all aliens 
or any class of aliens’’ when the Presi-
dent finds that such entry ‘‘would be 
detrimental to the interests of the 
United States.’’ 
I strongly disagree with the Court’s 
broad interpretation of that provision. 
Section 212(f) was intended to give the 
President discretion to quickly address 
emergent 
issues 
involving 
public 
health, national security, public safe-
ty, or international stability. It was 
not intended to provide carte blanche 
authority to the President to ban large 
categories of individuals without jus-
tification or to rewrite immigration 
laws with which he disagrees. 
That is why this legislation is so im-
portant. H.R. 2214 will repeal these 
shameful bans and stop executive over-
reach by amending 212(f) to prevent 
any President from using it in a man-
ner that is unlawful or unconscionable. 
The United States has always been 
and must continue to be a place that 
welcomes and embraces people of all 
religions and all nationalities. But as a 
result of the Muslim ban, our country’s 
reputation as a beacon of hope, toler-
ance, and inclusion for those fleeing 
persecution, reuniting with their fami-
lies, or simply seeking a better life has 
been forever tarnished. 
I would like to thank my friend and 
colleague Representative CHU for intro-
ducing this legislation and for her lead-
ership and commitment to this issue. 
I also want to thank the NO BAN co-
alition, led by Muslim Advocates, and 
all of the many organizations whose 
support was vital to bringing this bill 
to the floor today. It is long overdue. 
Madam Speaker, I urge all of my col-
leagues to support the NO BAN Act, 
and I reserve the balance of my time. 
b 1045 
Mr. BIGGS. Madam Speaker, I yield 
such time as he may consume to the 
gentleman from Texas (Mr. GOODEN). 
Mr. GOODEN. Madam Speaker, I 
thank Congressman BIGGS for yielding. 
I rise today in opposition to the NO 
BAN Act, which would tie the hands of 
our executive branch, restricting our 
ability to act quickly and decisively to 
defend America from her enemies. 
The President must have authority 
to act when our national security is at 
risk. When a situation demands we halt 
travel into our country, whether that 
be to protect us from a pandemic or 
other 
national 
security 
issue, 
the 
President must have the power to do 
so. 
Democrats, on March 11 of this year, 
debated this very measure in the form 
of a bill, ironically, the same day that 
President Trump instituted his ban on 
European travel. Because they knew 
the optics would look bad, they pulled 
the bill down. If it was a bad bill then, 
it is a bad bill today. 
Congress gave the President the au-
thority we are discussing today when 
we passed, many decades ago, the Im-
migration and Nationality Act. In the 
years since, our courts have affirmed 
that authority on numerous occasions. 
So why, then, do my Democratic col-
leagues want to take this critical au-
thority away? 
I would like to read an excerpt from 
a 1986 decision out of the D.C. Circuit, 
in which the court stated that the very 
authority we are debating today en-
sures that ‘‘the Executive would not be 
helpless in the face of such a threat’’ of 
an alien who posed a danger to the 
United States. 
Furthermore, the court stated that 
‘‘the President’s sweeping proclama-
tion power thus provides a safeguard 
against the danger posed’’ to our na-
tional security. 
What far right extremist, ultra-
conservative judge wrote those words? 
No other than Ruth Bader Ginsberg. 
The safety and security of the Amer-
ican people should not be a partisan 
issue. It ought to be everyone’s highest 
priority. We should not jeopardize the 
well-being of our citizens for the sake 
of political victories. If enacted, the 
NO BAN Act would put American lives 
and our country’s national security at 
risk. 
Madam Speaker, I will be opposing 
this dangerous policy, and I urge my 
colleagues to oppose it is as well. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman 
from California (Ms. JUDY CHU), the 
sponsor of the bill. 
Ms. JUDY CHU of California. Madam 
Speaker, I thank Chairman NADLER for 
his leadership in bringing the NO BAN 
Act for a vote on the floor today. 
Three years ago, when President 
Trump first took office, within 1 week, 
he announced the first Muslim ban. 
I will never forget that terrible day 
in January of 2017. I was on my way to 
a community event when I received a 
frantic call about 50 Muslims with 
green cards who were being detained at 
LAX for hours, with no end in sight. 
At that moment, I decided to drop 
everything and help in any way I could. 
I rushed over to LAX to advocate for 
these people. Once I arrived, I found 
out that, indeed, there were scores of 
people with a legal right to be here 
kept 
for 
hours 
without 
food 
and 
blocked from receiving legal advice 
from an attorney. 
With this action, Trump was imme-
diately creating chaos and separating 
families with no justification. It was 
outrageous. When I pressed Customs 
and Border Protection for answers, 
they resisted and blocked me. I even 
got them on the phone, only to have 
them hang up on me. 
I had never been more disrespected as 
a Member of Congress, but disrespect 
and chaos is what this Muslim ban is 
all about. Since then, the administra-
tion has steadily worked to make it 
harder and harder for individuals to 
come to the United States, which has 
meant keeping families and loved ones 
apart. 
Partners and spouses have been kept 
apart for years at a time. Children 
have missed parent’s funerals. Parents 
have missed children’s weddings, birth-
days, and graduations. Families have 
been languishing, wondering when they 
will be reunited, all because of a policy 
born from prejudice. This is a cruel 
abuse of power that must be stopped. 
The NO BAN Act repeals all versions 
of the Muslim ban, including the travel 
ban imposed in February of this year 
that includes many African countries. 
It limits the President’s authority to 
ban people from entering the United 
States unless there is a clear justifica-
tion. The President would have to con-
sult with the Departments of Home-
land Security and State before imple-
menting a ban and would have to brief 
Congress within 48 hours. 
Let me make clear that this bill 
would not have impacted our ability to 
fight the COVID–19 pandemic in any 
way, as it does not interfere with the 
ability of a President to restrict immi-
gration due to public health concerns. 
Madam Speaker, I urge all my col-
leagues to vote in favor of this historic 
legislation which sends a strong mes-
sage to our communities that you can-
not be discriminated against based on 
your religion or national origin. 
Mr. BIGGS. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman 
from 
California 
(Ms. 
PELOSI), 
the 
Speaker of the House. 
Ms. 
PELOSI. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
I 
thank the gentleman for yielding. I 
thank him for his leadership in bring-
ing this legislation to the floor. 
Madam Speaker, I pay special tribute 
to Congresswoman CHU, the chair of 
the caucus in the House that rep-
resents the Asian Pacific American 
community, and PRAMILA JAYAPAL, a 
member of the Judiciary Committee, 
instrumental in bringing this legisla-
tion as well, the NO BAN Act, and, 
again, the right to counsel legislation. 
As I was thinking of this legislation 
today—I have a statement for the 
record, but I was thinking back to the

‘‘rump’’ hearing that we had under the 
leadership of the Judiciary Committee 
at the time the NO BAN was an-
nounced. The distinguished chair, Ms. 
CHU, talked about how people reacted 
at the airports and the rest—among 
them, John Lewis—going to the air-
port. 
But at this hearing, it was so re-
markable, because people turned out. 
Diplomats showed up and spoke for 
their colleagues who were still in the 
diplomatic service, saying how wrong 
this was. They took professional risk 
as members of our diplomatic corps. 
There were around a thousand of them 
who signed a statement opposing this 
ban. 
The military was there, our men and 
women in uniform. They were there 
saying: You are hurting us. We have 
made promises to interpreters and oth-
ers who have helped us in Iraq and Af-
ghanistan—they 
were 
Muslim—and 
now they can’t come to the United 
States? It is wrong on its face, but we 
are not even keeping our word. Who 
will trust us? Who will trust us if we 
don’t have respect for people? 
Some military who were Muslim—ac-
tually Khizr Khan was there, a Gold 
Star father, he came and was very brief 
in his testimony. He had some good ad-
vice about what we could do about this. 
But our men and women in uniform 
who are Muslim were hearing this, in 
Khizr Khan’s case, a Gold Star family 
whose son had given his life for our 
country, a Muslim, and now we were 
saying there is going to be a Muslim 
ban. 
What was interesting, though, was 
that a leader of the evangelical com-
munity was there. And this bill is send-
ing a strong message. It is repealing all 
versions of the Muslim ban, the refugee 
ban, and the asylum ban, rescinding 
each cruel version of the President’s 
discriminatory bans, including his ex-
ecutive order mandating extreme vet-
ting for refugees and asylum seekers. 
Well, the person who was there, and 
the record will show, representing the 
evangelicals, he said in his testimony 
that the United States Refugee Reset-
tlement Program is the crowning glory 
of 
American 
humanitarianism, and 
here this President is rejecting that 
focus of who we are as a country and 
the model we should be. 
In fact, all this administration has 
done is diminish the opportunities for 
those who would come here—some for 
fear of persecution, others because 
they had helped us, and others because 
of the Statue of Liberty, again, a bea-
con of hope to the world that is con-
stantly undermined by this administra-
tion. 
So, Madam Speaker, I salute the 
maker of this amendment, Chairwoman 
JUDY CHU. I salute PRAMILA JAYAPAL, 
who has been relentless, persistent on 
this matter, and I thank all of our col-
leagues who fought so hard. 
Just to recall, we remember the day 
after the inauguration that women 
turned out in huge numbers not only in 
Washington, but all over the country 
and all over the world. They knew the 
power of their presence. 
So, when this came shortly there-
after, people understood the power of 
their presence, and people showed up at 
airports and wherever a manifestation 
of support for our Muslim community 
was needed. It was really quite a defin-
ing time for our country, because peo-
ple knew their power and the power of 
their presence, being there, being there 
for everyone in our country. 
So, Madam Speaker, I am very grate-
ful to the makers of this motion, to the 
Judiciary Committee. And to Chair-
man NADLER, I thank him for giving us 
this opportunity to honor what the 
Statue of Liberty means to us and to 
the world. 
Then just go look at Ronald Reagan’s 
statements about the Statue of Liberty 
and the beacon of hope that it is to the 
world and contrast it to the attitude 
that we see coming out of this White 
House now. 
I hope we have a good, bipartisan 
vote on this repeal of the Muslim ban 
and the access to counsel that goes 
with this legislation. 
Madam Speaker, on the base of the Statue 
of Liberty, which is a beacon of freedom and 
hope for the world, are inscribed these words: 
‘‘Give me your tired, your poor/ Your huddled 
masses yearning to breathe free/ Send these, 
the homeless, tempest-tossed to me.’’ 
I rise to join my colleagues in support of the 
‘‘NO BAN’’ Act to rescind the President’s Mus-
lim ban, which betrays everything the Statue 
of Liberty and our nation stand for. 
I salute Congresswoman JUDY CHU, Chair of 
the Congressional Asian Pacific American 
Caucus, and the lead on this legislation— 
which is the first Muslim civil rights bill in our 
nation’s history. 
Thank you also to Congresswoman PRAMILA 
JAYAPAL for her leadership to ensure that 
those unjustly detained have access to legal 
counsel. 
It is particularly senseless that the President 
continues to inflict his Muslim ban on the 
country as we face the COVID–19 pandemic. 
These bans harm the economy and public 
health by depriving our nation of the research-
ers, scientists, physicians and other medical 
professionals desperately needed to crush the 
virus. 
More than 100,000 medical professionals in 
our country are from just two of the countries 
included in the ban. 
Overall, the ban has led to a 15 percent 
drop in new physicians from Muslim-majority 
countries coming to America. 
These bans fuel anti-Muslim discrimination, 
which sadly, the White House is encouraging, 
when it misleads the public and says that the 
bans are needed to keep us safe—when in re-
ality, the bans only weaken our response, by 
banning doctors and medical professionals 
from our shores. 
At the same time, the bans erode our na-
tional security and devastate families: sepa-
rating families and preventing thousands from 
attending loved ones’ births, graduations, mar-
riages and funerals. One study finds that 
these bans have prevented more than 9,000 
family members of U.S. citizens from entering 
the country, including more than 5,500 chil-
dren. 
More than 400 national, state and local civil 
rights, faith-based, national security and com-
munity groups, from AFSCME and Amnesty 
International to United We Dream and Vet-
erans for Peace, have spoken out to demand 
passage of the NO BAN Act to ‘‘end the harm-
ful Muslim Ban and put in place vital protec-
tions against future discriminatory bans.’’ 
‘‘The NO BAN Act is a clear and unequivo-
cal response to the Muslim Ban that would en-
sure no one can be banned from our country 
based on religious or nationality-based dis-
crimination ever again. 
‘‘Regrettably, the Muslim Ban validates the 
worst stereotypes about Muslims; that they are 
inherently foreign and violent and pose such a 
threat to the United States they should be 
banned. 
‘‘The ban on Muslims comes after genera-
tions of politicians hostile to religious minori-
ties have attempted to ban Jews, Catholics, 
and Latter-day Saints. Congress now has an 
opportunity to take action against the Muslim 
Ban and this troubling history by sending a 
strong message that our nation rejects reli-
gious bigotry.’’ 
With this bill, Congress is sending that 
strong message. We are: 
Repealing all versions of the Muslim ban, 
the refugee ban, and the asylum ban—re-
scinding each cruel version of the President’s 
discriminatory bans, including his executive 
order mandating ‘‘extreme vetting’’ for refu-
gees and asylum seeking; 
Strengthening immigration law to explicitly 
prohibit discrimination based on religion—and 
ensuring that it applies to non-immigrant visas, 
entry into the U.S. and the approval of any im-
migrant benefit; and 
Limiting executive authority to prevent any 
president from issuing future bans like the 
Muslim ban—imposing strict requirements be-
fore any future restrictions can be issued & 
enacting reporting requirements to Congress 
to create an oversight mechanism for the fu-
ture. 
The Democratic House will always stand up 
to defend our values. As Pope Francis said, 
‘‘It’s hypocrisy to call yourself a Christian and 
chase away a refugee or someone seeking 
help.’’ 
I urge a strong bipartisan vote to put an end 
to this act of callousness and discrimination 
from the White House. 
Madam Speaker, I urge a strong 
‘‘yes’’ vote. 
Mr. BIGGS. Madam Speaker, I appre-
ciate the Speaker’s invoking President 
Reagan, because in 1981, President 
Reagan used 212(f) authority to suspend 
entry of undocumented aliens from the 
high seas, so I appreciate her remind-
ing us of the use of 212(f) by Reagan. 
Madam Speaker, I yield such time as 
he may consume to the gentleman 
from Georgia (Mr. COLLINS). 
Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Madam 
Speaker, I thank Representative BIGGS 
for yielding.

BIGGS

high-
lighted, frankly, the problem, Madam 
Speaker, that we see in this, and it has 
been reiterated over and over again.

about a person. It is about a person, 
the President, who the other side, and 
especially this committee that I have

serve as a member of, has consistently 
gone after for, now, almost 19 months. 
It has nothing to do with policies 
that at one point they did or did not 
believe in because, if this were true, we 
would have had a mass outcry in 2011 
when President Obama used this au-
thority to keep out folks because of 
human rights issues and other things. 
So, again, the problem here is it is 
great to couch this in political terms; 
it is great to couch this in great, deep 
policy issues; but, for 18 months, this is 
all that we have heard. 
I heard my chairman just a minute 
ago speak about how these policies 
that he disagrees with and doesn’t like 
that are found under the law and that 
we are dealing with here today in this 
so-called NO BAN Act have tarnished 
us. Well, I will tell everybody what is 
tarnishing us in this country. It is acts 
like this and the constant back-and- 
forth. 
There are times I have wondered— 
and I know my friend from Arizona has 
as well. We have talked about this a 
little bit. I have wondered why we have 
sort of kept the House locked down for 
the last 5 or 6 months, but if this is 
what we come back to do, maybe we 
should just stay away, because if this 
is what we are doing, it is, frankly, 
frustrating, because November 3 will be 
the chance to talk about this. 
It is very policy and politically driv-
en when we come to this floor on any-
thing that really has to do with a polit-
ical agenda, when there is a date on the 
calendar, as I talked about before, 
more than actually changing policy, 
because when you look at this, I will 
almost guarantee you that my friends 
currently in the majority, if they had a 
President of their party in the White 
House, they would come back on this 
very quickly and be very scared of 
messing 
with 
this 
power 
Presi-
dentially. 
This is a problem that we are seeing 
over and over and over and over again. 
This NO BAN Act would strip the 
President of his ability to use the Im-
migration and Nationality Act to ban 
travel from certain countries that 
present national security concerns. 
Ironically, as I said earlier, this is 
the very power that President Trump 
used in January to deal with the 
coronavirus in China. If this were in 
place, he may not have had the ability 
to actually work on what we know now 
as the pandemic early on to help stop 
the spread. 
There are consequences to political 
legislation. This is one of them. We 
saved countless lives because of that, 
and now they want to strip the Presi-
dent of the authority to do that. 
Now, others may say, well, we have 
got exceptions and we have got this. I 
am not taking anything from this com-
mittee on exceptions for this Presi-
dent. There have not been any. It is 
simply a partisan attack. 
b 1100 
The Department of Homeland Secu-
rity has identified several types of in-
formation that it needs in order to 
make a reliable decision regarding the 
admissibility of a foreign country’s na-
tionals to seek entry into the United 
States; things like: Does the country 
report lost or stolen identity docu-
ments, including passports, to Interpol, 
and how often they do so? 
Does the country share information 
about their known or suspected terror-
ists or about their criminals with us? 
And does the country issue modern 
electronic passports? 
Why would we want to restrict the 
President, any President, from consid-
ering this information when deter-
mining whether to let a foreign na-
tional into our country? 
Instead of appreciating what has 
been done here by this President with 
regard to our national security, like 
addressing the crisis on our border and 
China’s increasingly hostile behavior, 
the Democrats have decided to move 
forward with this act, which we have 
talked about before in our committee 
and have pointed out many of the prob-
lems of this act. It eviscerates the abil-
ity of any administration to take nim-
ble and decisive action to protect our 
homeland 
when 
cause 
for 
concern 
arises, like the threat of COVID–19. 
What is even more ironic, and I 
touched on this when I first started, 
Madam Speaker, is that the very power 
that the majority wants to strip from 
this President was used successfully by 
President Barack Obama and also—as 
was pointed out by my friend from Ari-
zona—by the Speaker of this House, 
currently, and Ronald Reagan. 
When we understand this, this actu-
ally clarifies—it actually crystallizes 
it. So when you see every other Presi-
dent has used this in some form over 
the years, and it has only become a 
concern now because we do not like the 
current President, Donald Trump, and 
we have an election coming up very 
quickly, then we start seeing stuff like 
this. 
In January 2017, President Trump 
signed an executive order to restrict 
travel from certain countries that were 
at a high risk of terrorism and were 
public safety concerns, based off rec-
ommendations from the Secretaries of 
DHS and State, along with the DNI. 
It is important to understand these 
restrictions are not permanent. This is, 
again, another thing that permeates 
even some conversations I have heard 
already that we are making permanent 
changes. These are not permanent. 
They are there until the country gets 
it in order and are actually able to an-
swer our security concerns, which is 
not going to be talked about today. We 
are not talking about security. We are 
trying to make it feel like it is some-
thing else against certain groups and 
ethnic groups. This is about security. 
When you look at the law, and it 
says, when those public safety concerns 
are removed, they are removed from 
the restricted list, such as Chad was in 
2018. 
Let me be clear; there is no doubt the 
President’s use of the 212(f) authority 
has helped us improve our security and 
the vetting of foreign nationals seeking 
entry into the U.S. Some countries re-
stricted by this order have taken posi-
tive steps to come into compliance 
with the information-sharing and pub-
lic safety standards and have worked 
to participate in protecting inter-
national security. 
Is that not what we would want? Or 
is what is being said by the majority 
today that we prefer lax standards for 
those coming here; we prefer less safe-
ty for our people of people coming here. 
Is that the standard being left here? 
I don’t think the majority wants to 
go there, but it is seemingly implied by 
what is being said. Because this is ac-
tually working with countries to come 
into 
modern-day 
compliance 
with 
known safety and international safety 
regulations. 
This bill would take authority away 
from the President and give it to a sub-
ordinate. Again, strange move here; 
taking the Presidential authority. It 
goes back and shows the real intent of 
this bill is about this President, not 
about the law. 
It would also outrageously terminate 
‘‘all actions taken pursuant to any 
proclamation or executive order,’’ ef-
fectively shutting down the informa-
tion sharing on terrorism, criminals, 
and security threats that have come 
from these restrictions. This is dan-
gerous, Madam Speaker, and it is a bad 
policy. 
This bill is just another response, 
knee-jerk response, by the majority be-
cause they don’t like the President and 
they don’t like the decisions he makes 
on behalf of the country. Unfortu-
nately, their never-ending desire to 
take him down comes at the expense of 
American security and safety if this 
bill were to become law. 
Fortunately, we know it will not; an-
other day of political posturing on the 
floor of the House, wreaking havoc on 
our borders, backlogging our customs 
process. And here is the interesting one 
that nobody has talked about that I 
have heard so far. I may have missed 
it, but I don’t think I did. 
Me and the gentleman from Arizona, 
we understand something. Everything 
coming here today has a price tag. This 
one does as well, $1 billion. 
But then this is really where it gets 
concerning, Madam Speaker, because I 
have tried my best over the years to 
work with the majority, and I see some 
of my friends over there that we have 
passed legislation with that have made 
an impact in this country. 
But here is what really bothers me. 
How do they pay for it? How does the 
majority pay for this? 
The majority, Democrats, have de-
cided to include in this bill a prescrip-
tion drug measure that could have been 
by bipartisan, and was bipartisan, if 
only they had abided by the agreed- 
upon text negotiated by Members in 
both parties. 
Instead, we are considering an old, 
partisan version of a prescription drug

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H3633 
July 22, 2020 
bill that will undermine critical inno-
vation. 
We 
negotiated 
bipartisan 
changes to stop gaming while pre-
serving the research that benefits pa-
tients, but the Democrats in the major-
ity have abandoned that and, with this 
bill, they have abandoned any hope of 
showing the American people they 
truly want to legislate, instead of just 
constantly attacking this President. 
But what is of deeper concern here, 
especially when it comes to prescrip-
tion drug costs—because I don’t want 
to hear my friends in the majority now 
talk about how they want to save 
money, and how they want to encour-
age innovation. When they put this 
into this bill, they have torn down bi-
partisan work that could actually save 
money. They have got to pay for it 
somehow. 
I know their counsel; I know they are 
struggling right now. We have to pay 
for it somehow. 
Well, then why not go back to the bi-
partisan process of working on pre-
scription drugs, instead of throwing it 
into this NO BAN Act? 
The majority’s moral underpinning is 
severely damaged when you look at the 
fact that they are trying to play games 
with the prescription drug issue in our 
country on this bill; when we know, for 
a fact, that bipartisanship was the way 
forward on this, and I had worked with, 
and others had worked to bring a bipar-
tisan solution. And now we throw it 
out the door because we are so bent on 
making a political statement on this 
floor that bipartisanship is gone. We 
might as well pack it up and wait for 
November 3. That hurts this body. 
As the chairman of this committee in 
this House talked about just a moment 
ago about tarnishing the work in the 
world standing by what the President 
has done, are we really not going to 
have a conversation, Madam Speaker, 
about what is happening? 
And I know—Madam Speaker, you do 
as well—concern about what happens 
here, concern about actually getting 
something done, concern about the 
very people that are lifted up by the 
majority and the minority, saying we 
are here for the American people. But 
when I see pay-fors like this, when I 
see the pay-for happening here, I know 
that this is not anything but another 
day on the campaign trail. 
We are here today, making a polit-
ical statement, and you know who is 
going to suffer? The very ones—I don’t 
want to hear it from anybody in the 
majority today talking about how they 
want to help healthcare; how they 
want to bring prescription drug costs 
down; how they want to get at the very 
issues that we are dealing with. Be-
cause today you are going to go on 
record when you vote for this, by say-
ing we don’t care about the American 
people’s fixing prescription drugs and 
getting healthy in this country. This 
today proves you have nothing to do. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the distinguished 
gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. JACKSON 
LEE). 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank Congresswoman CHU for this im-
portant statement that is necessary for 
the American people: In God, We Trust. 
And the God we trust is a merciful 
God. 
144,000 people dead from COVID–19. It 
is important when an administration, 
no matter who it is, fails the American 
people, the United States Congress 
must be the one that deals with that 
failure, and that is what the NO BAN 
Act stands for. It stands for expanding 
the INA’s nondiscrimination provision 
to prohibit discrimination based on re-
ligion and extends the prohibition on 
discrimination beyond the issuance of 
immigrant 
visas 
to 
include 
the 
issuance of nonimmigrant visas, entry, 
admission to the United States, and 
the approval or revocation thereof. 
I had an amendment that is added to 
this that makes it a surety that the ad-
ministration report to Congress on the 
impacts of positive, negative, and unin-
tended actions by the President. We 
must have oversight. 
I stand in the name of Ali, a 17-year- 
old. When I landed from Washington, I 
went straight to the terminal imme-
diately on that Friday. My tears were 
coming to my eyes as I saw little Ali 
denied entry into the United States. 
That is why I am here. I support the 
NO BAN Act. 
Madam Speaker, as an original cosponsor 
and senior member of the Committee on the 
Judiciary, I rise in strong and enthusiastic sup-
port of H.R. 2214, the ‘‘National Origin-Based 
AntiDiscrimination For Non-Immigrants Act, or 
No BAN Act, which stops executive overreach 
by preventing the president from abusing his 
authority to restrict the entry of non-citizens 
into the United States under section 212(f) of 
the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA). 
This legislation also repeals several of the 
President’s section 212(f)-based executive ac-
tions, including his original Muslim ban as well 
as the most recent expansion of the ban an-
nounced in January 2020. 
Madam Speaker, I support this legislation 
because the NO BAN Act amends section 
212(f) of the INA to place checks and bal-
ances on the President’s authority to tempo-
rarily suspend or restrict the entry of aliens or 
classes of aliens into the United States, when 
it is determined that such individuals ‘‘would 
undermine the security or public safety of the 
United States or the preservation of human 
rights, democratic processes or institutions, or 
international stability.’’ 
Specifically, the bill requires the President to 
find and document that any suspension or re-
striction: (1) is based on specific and credible 
facts; (2) is narrowly tailored; (3) specifies a 
duration; and (4) includes waivers. 
The NO BAN Act expands the INA’s non-
discrimination provision to prohibit discrimina-
tion based on religion and extends the prohibi-
tion on discrimination beyond the issuance of 
immigrant visas to include the issuance of 
nonimmigrant visas, entry and admission into 
the United States, and the approval or revoca-
tion of any immigration benefit. 
The NO BAN Act terminates several of 
President Trump’s proclamations and execu-
tive orders invoking section 212(f) authority, 
including Presidential Proclamation 9645, also 
known as the ‘‘Muslim Ban,’’ and Presidential 
Proclamation 9983, barring the entry of immi-
grants 
from 
Burma 
(Myanmar), 
Eritrea, 
Kyrgyzstan, and Nigeria, and suspending par-
ticipation in the Diversity Visa program for na-
tionals of Sudan and Tanzania. 
Madam Speaker, I am pleased that the NO 
BAN Act includes an important amendment I 
offered during the committee markup of the 
legislation, which requires the Administration 
to report to Congress on the impacts—posi-
tive, negative, and unintended—of any action 
taken by the President pursuant to executive 
orders he has or will issue pursuant to section 
212(f) of the INA. 
I strongly support the provision in the legis-
lation that nullifies the President’s latest exec-
utive order which adds the countries of 
Belarus, Myanmar, Eritrea, Kyrgyzstan, Nige-
ria, Sudan and Tanzania to the President’s 
new and offensive Muslim Ban. 
As a co-chair of the Congressional Nigerian 
Caucus, the United States cannot afford to 
hamper diplomatic relations with Nigeria due 
to its importance in the region. 
Nigeria is the largest economy and most 
populous country in Africa with an estimated 
population of more than 190 million, which is 
expected to grow to 400 million by 2050 and 
become the third most populous country in the 
world after China and India. 
The United States is the largest foreign in-
vestor in Nigeria, with U.S. foreign direct in-
vestment concentrated largely in the petro-
leum and mining and wholesale trade sectors. 
At $2.2 billion in 2017, Nigeria is the second 
largest U.S. export destination in Sub-Saharan 
Africa and the United States and Nigeria have 
a bilateral trade and investment framework 
agreement. 
In 2017, the two-way trade in goods be-
tween the United States and Nigeria totaled 
over $9 billion. 
Due to many of the residents of these coun-
tries practicing Islam, the President’s execu-
tive order has been appropriately nicknamed 
the ‘‘Muslim Ban’’, and only exemplifies the 
xenophobic and prejudiced mindset that is un-
acceptable in this country. 
With countries such as Nigeria, Sudan, Tan-
zania, and Eritrea, being considered as addi-
tions to the travel ban list, I strongly oppose 
this discriminatory act. 
Tanzania is also an important partner of the 
United States, and through numerous presi-
dential initiatives, the United States has pro-
vided development and other assistance to 
Tanzania for capacity building to address 
health 
and 
education 
issues, 
encourage 
democratic governance promote broad-based 
economic growth, and advance regional and 
domestic security to sustain progress. 
Although Sudan has had some internal 
issues during the last decade, the U.S. was a 
major donor in the March 1989 ‘‘Operation 
Lifeline Sudan,’’ which delivered 100,000 met-
ric tons of food into both government and 
rebel held areas of the Sudan, thus, averting 
widespread starvation. 
The United States established diplomatic re-
lations with Eritrea in 1993, following its inde-
pendence and separation from Ethiopia. 
The United States supported Eritrea’s inde-
pendence and through a concerted, mutual ef-
fort that began in late 2017 and continues 
today, there are vast improvements to the bi-
lateral relationship. 
U.S. interests in Eritrea include supporting 
efforts for greater integration of Eritrea with

the rest of the Horn of Africa, encouraging Eri-
trea to contribute to regional stability and part-
ner on shared peace and security goals, urg-
ing progress toward a democratic political cul-
ture, addressing human rights issues and pro-
moting economic reform and prosperity. 
Although the law contains a waiver program 
that allows residents of these countries to 
enter the country if they meet certain stand-
ards, this program is arbitrary and unfairly cre-
ates a separation of families, provides less 
work opportunities and greatly reduces the op-
portunity to apply for visas in the future, un-
less it is repealed. 
A comprehensive and coordinated strategy 
needs to be developed in coordination with the 
United States Congress to ensure that each 
country affected by this law may peacefully 
have its residents enter the United States and 
complete visa and asylum applications. 
We live in a nation of laws but we also live 
in a nation that seeks to establish and main-
tain diplomatic ties to these important African 
nations and imposing a discriminatory and ar-
bitrary ban would adversely affect foreign rela-
tions with a critical continent for decades to 
come. 
Madam Speaker, in light of the crisis pre-
sented by current COVID–19 pandemic, the 
NO BAN Act contains a provision to ensure 
that the President can use section 212(f) to 
protect the United States from the spread of 
communicable diseases, including the 2019 
coronavirus, by suspending the entry of a 
class of individuals if the President determines 
their entry would undermine the public safety 
of the United States. 
However, to remove any perceived ambi-
guity and avoid the propensity of this president 
to abuse delegated authority, the legislation in-
cludes language to clarify that the term ‘‘public 
safety’’ ‘‘includes efforts necessary to contain 
a communicable disease of public health sig-
nificance.’’ 
Madam Speaker, the NO BAN Act is sup-
ported by a bipartisan coalition of the nation’s 
leading immigrants’ rights organizations, faith- 
based organizations, and civil rights organiza-
tions, including the following: 
American Civil Liberties Union; Church 
World Service; U.S. Conference of Catholic 
Bishops; Muslim Advocates Immigration Hub; 
Asian Americans Advancing Justice Associa-
tion; Americans United for Separation of 
Church and State; Bend the Arc; Center for 
American Progress; The Public Affairs Alliance 
of Iranian Americans; Interfaith Immigration 
Coalition; Human Rights Campaign; Francis-
can Action Network; HIAS; Jewish and Mus-
lims and Allies Acting Together; Religious Ac-
tion Center of Reform Judaism; National 
Council of Jewish Women; National Iranian 
American Organization Action; National Immi-
gration Law Center; International Refugee As-
sistance Project; Friends Committee on Na-
tional Legislation; Engage Action; and Airbnb. 
I urge all Members to vote for H.R. 2214 
and send a powerful message to the President 
and the American people that this House will 
not stand idly by as this Administration tries to 
abandon America’s well-earned and long-es-
tablished reputation of being the most wel-
coming nation on earth. 
Mr. BIGGS. Madam Speaker, may I 
inquire as to how much time is left? 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from Arizona has 11 minutes re-
maining. The gentleman from New 
York has 171⁄2 minutes remaining. 
Mr. BIGGS. Madam Speaker, I yield 
such time as he may consume to the 
distinguished gentleman from Lou-
isiana (Mr. SCALISE), the minority 
whip. 
Mr. SCALISE. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman from Arizona for 
yielding. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in strong op-
position to this bill. And when you 
think about where we are as a country, 
we are in the middle of a global pan-
demic. And at the beginning of this, 
after China lied—and let’s be very 
clear—China lied, not only to the 
United States, but to the entire world 
about this disease that started in 
Wuhan. 
And what they did, while they were 
lying, they corrupted the World Health 
Organization, that entity that typi-
cally we all would look to for guidance, 
and WHO literally was regurgitating 
the Chinese Communist Party’s talk-
ing points, saying it wasn’t spread 
from human-to-human contact, which 
was a lie. And we now have evidence to 
show that they manipulated and de-
ceived the rest of the world. 
While they were doing that, Madam 
Speaker, they were hoarding PPE. 
They were not only buying it up 
around the world, they make most of it 
in China. We need to change that, by 
the way. 
We should be spending our time here 
on the House floor, not limiting the 
President’s ability to keep Americans 
safe, 
which, 
fortunately, 
President 
Trump was able to do. He did so effec-
tively, properly; he stopped flights 
coming in from China when we knew 
the disease was coming from China, for 
goodness sake. 
Why would you want to stop the 
President from being able to keep 
Americans safe? 
What we should be spending our time 
on right now, Madam Speaker, is bring-
ing more manufacturing back to Amer-
ica so we don’t need to rely on China, 
because they told even American com-
panies like 3M that were making PPE, 
you can’t ship it back to the United 
States when our nurses and doctors 
need it. 
So President Trump said, we are 
going to use the Defense Production 
Act. We are going to start making 
more of that here in America. 
We need to put incentives to bring 
more of that back from China, so we 
are not relying on them. 
But no, we are not spending our time 
on that today, Madam Speaker. We are 
spending our time with this bill that 
would limit and make it more difficult 
for the President of the United States, 
any President—just because some peo-
ple don’t like this President, they are 
going to make it harder for any Presi-
dent to keep Americans safe, whether 
it is from terrorists abroad, or whether 
it is for health pandemics that might 
break out again in the future. 
This is lunacy that we would be try-
ing to make it harder for a President 
to keep Americans safe. Thank good-
ness President Trump used his execu-
tive powers to act like he did to stop 
the disease from spreading more into 
this country. He saved thousands of 
lives. 
If China wouldn’t have lied to him, 
we would have had a few more weeks. 
There is data that shows scientifically 
that tens of thousands of lives would 
have been saved in America. 
But at least the President was able 
to act when he had the proper informa-
tion. I know people like Joe Biden said 
it was xenophobic, for goodness sake; 
criticized the President stopping peo-
ple from coming in from the place 
where the disease started. And others 
criticized him for doing it as well. But 
it was the right thing to do. I am glad 
he took that action. 
The last thing we need to be doing in 
the middle of this pandemic is making 
it harder for the President to keep 
Americans safe. I urge everybody to 
vote ‘‘no’’ on this bill. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the distinguished 
gentleman 
from 
New 
York 
(Mr. 
JEFFRIES). 
Mr. 
JEFFRIES. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
America is a Nation of immigrants; 
some voluntary, others involuntary. 
John Lewis would often remind us, 
however, that while we may have come 
over on different ships, we are all in 
the same boat now. 
We are a gorgeous mosaic of people 
from throughout the world, different 
races, different regions, yes, different 
religions; that is what makes America 
a great country, not xenophobia. 
Donald Trump’s hateful Muslim ban 
is unacceptable, unconscionable, and 
un-American. It is inconsistent with 
the principles of religious freedom and 
tolerance 
embedded 
in 
the 
First 
Amendment of the United States Con-
stitution. That is why we are going to 
make it unlawful. 
Vote ‘‘yes’’ on the NO BAN Act. 
Mr. BIGGS. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 3 minutes to the distinguished 
gentleman from Rhode Island (Mr. 
CICILLINE). 
Mr. CICILLINE. Madam Speaker, I 
rise in strong support of H.R. 2214, leg-
islation that will repeal the President’s 
shameful Muslim ban, and strengthen 
our immigration system by ensuring 
immigration decisions are not made on 
the basis of religious discrimination. 
In the face of religious intolerance, 
Roger Williams established the great 
State of Rhode Island on the principles 
of religious liberty and separation of 
church and State. These are important 
principles that were ultimately incor-
porated into our founding documents. 
In fact, President Washington, ad-
dressing the Hebrew congregation at 
Touro Synagogue, wrote in a famous 
letter in 1790, when they asked, Will we 
have religious freedom in this new 
country? He wrote those words: ‘‘For 
happily the Government of the United 
States gives to bigotry no sanction, to 
persecution no assistance.’’

And what has been the result of this 
religious discrimination, this Muslim 
ban? It has resulted in mothers and fa-
thers being separated from their Amer-
ican children. Foreign students are pre-
vented from studying at our Nation’s 
great universities; and doctors from 
countries under the ban aren’t able to 
come here to provide care to patients 
in 
the 
United 
States, 
despite 
healthcare shortages across the Nation 
during a global health pandemic. 
b 1115 
In addition to that, Madam Speaker, 
this legislation violates the founding 
principles of this country of religious 
freedom. I am very proud that this leg-
islation is being brought to the floor so 
that we can reaffirm that important 
principle not only in the founding doc-
uments of our country but in the 
present immigration laws and their ap-
plication. 
In addition to that, there has been a 
lot of discussion about how we are pay-
ing for this. I am very proud that this 
legislation includes provisions of the 
Affordable Prescriptions for Patients 
Through Promoting Competition Act, 
which will save taxpayers over half a 
billion dollars in the form of lower pre-
scription drug prices. All across the 
country, prescription costs are sky-
rocketing. People are going bankrupt 
and even dying because they can’t af-
ford prescription medication. 
H.R. 2214 addresses product hopping, 
an anticompetitive tactic used by Big 
Pharma to protect and extend their 
monopolies over certain prescription 
drugs, leading to dramatically higher 
prices. This legislation expressly pro-
hibits hopping under the FTC Act, and 
the bill is subject to the same equi-
table remedies, including restitution 
and disgorgement of profits. So, all 
this talk about folding into the pay-for 
would actually produce lower prescrip-
tion drug prices for Americans, and 
somehow that is a bad idea? Give me a 
break. 
This bill reasserts the prohibition 
against religious discrimination, one of 
the most important founding principles 
of this country, and it pays for it by de-
livering lower prescription drug prices 
for the American people. 
Madam Speaker, I thank Chairman 
NADLER, Congresswoman CHU, and Con-
gresswoman JAYAPAL for their great 
work, and I urge my colleagues to pass 
this bill. 
Mr. BIGGS. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the distinguished 
gentleman 
from 
Maryland 
(Mr. 
RASKIN). 
Mr. RASKIN. Madam Speaker, let us 
not forget who we are. Our Framers re-
belled against centuries of religious op-
pression, Inquisition, Holy Crusades, 
witchcraft trials, and state religion. 
They conceived America as a haven of 
refuge for people fleeing from religious 
and political persecution from all over 
the world. It would become an ‘‘asylum 
for humanity,’’ said Tom Paine—not an 
insane asylum, mind you, but an asy-
lum for freedom. 
The President’s Muslim ban dese-
crates this vision with the kind of reli-
gious discrimination that our Nation 
was created to oppose. 
The NO BAN Act now strikes down 
the President’s infamous Muslim ban 
proclamation and restores the principle 
of no religious discrimination to the 
immigration process. It will be a proud 
day for this Congress when we invali-
date the President’s infamous and ugly 
attempt to scapegoat people based on 
their religion. 
Mr. BIGGS. I reserve the balance of 
my time, Madam Speaker. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the distinguished 
gentleman 
from 
California 
(Mr. 
CORREA). 
Mr. CORREA. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman for yielding. 
Madam Speaker, in January of 2017, 
when President Trump issued his first 
Muslim ban executive order, I imme-
diately rushed to LAX to help those in-
dividuals who were being held at LAX. 
These were individuals who had been 
cleared by our State Department to 
enter the United States. Let me repeat: 
These were individuals who had been 
cleared by our State Department to 
enter the United States, and then they 
were blocked by the President’s ran-
dom order. 
I immediately introduced my first 
bill, the DIRe Act, to provide due proc-
ess guaranteed by our Constitution for 
Dreamers, immigrants, and refugees, 
due process that has been systemati-
cally denied by a President. 
Our Nation is built by immigrants 
who dare to dream better, immigrants 
who came to this country with nothing 
but their dreams of a better life. 
Madam Speaker, I urge passage of 
this bill. 
Mr. BIGGS. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the distinguished 
gentleman 
from 
Colorado 
(Mr. 
NEGUSE). 
Mr. 
NEGUSE. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
today, I rise in support of the NO BAN 
Act, a powerful bill that preserves the 
promise of America and rejects this ad-
ministration’s xenophobic and anti- 
Muslim immigration policies. 
The President’s reckless bans on ma-
jority Muslim and African countries do 
not align with our American values or 
the unique promise that this country 
has offered immigrants and refugees 
for centuries. It will not make us safer, 
and it is yet another example of this 
administration’s haphazard and cruel 
immigration policies. 
I am proud that I was able to success-
fully offer an amendment during the 
Judiciary Committee’s markup, with 
the chairman’s support, that added this 
President’s latest ban to the under-
lying bill. It is not only the right thing 
to do for our country but also a matter 
very personal to me. 
As many in this Chamber know, my 
parents came to America nearly 40 
years ago as refugees from Eritrea, one 
of the very countries that this Presi-
dent has targeted in his latest ban. My 
parents’ ability to start a new life in 
this country offered me and my family 
freedom, opportunity, and the privilege 
to 
truly 
experience 
the 
American 
Dream. There are countless success 
stories like my family’s waiting to be 
told, stories that won’t be written if 
this body does not pass this NO BAN 
Act today. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my colleague 
to support it. 
Mr. BIGGS. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the distinguished 
gentleman from New York (Mr. ROSE). 
Mr. ROSE of New York. Madam 
Speaker, I rise in support of the NO 
BAN Act to finally repeal the racist 
and discriminatory Muslim bans that 
have stained our Nation for the past 3 
years. 
The Muslim ban undermines every-
thing that this great country stands 
for, the greatest country in the history 
of the world. 
It has torn apart my constituents’ 
families and trapped their loved ones 
in war zones and refugee camps. It has 
made Muslim Americans feel like sec-
ond class citizens in their very own 
country. They are Americans just as 
much as I. 
This ban has done nothing to make 
us safe. Senator John McCain, in fact, 
once called the ban a self-inflicted 
wound in the fight against terrorism. 
The administration’s own officials 
admit this does absolutely nothing to 
protect our country. The State Depart-
ment says that just one-tenth of 1 per-
cent of the people blocked from this 
country under the Muslim ban was 
deemed a security risk. Those stats do 
not lie. DHS cannot point to a single 
threat that our existing immigration 
policies and systems would not have 
handled. 
If we are going to fight for this coun-
try to fulfill its promise, this ban must 
be overturned. 
Mr. BIGGS. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the distinguished 
gentlewoman 
from 
Minnesota 
(Ms. 
OMAR). 
Ms. OMAR. Madam Speaker, it gives 
me great pride to rise today in support 
of the NO BAN Act. 
Our friends on the other side of the 
aisle might try to obscure the reality 
here by pointing to the Muslim coun-
tries that are not on the ban. The 
White House has tried to wrap their 
hateful policy up in a false story about 
national security, but we know the 
truth. 
I have spoken countless times, both 
before and since I have entered this of-
fice, about the hateful brutality of the 
Muslim ban. 
Today, I want to celebrate the work 
that brought us to this point. I want to

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H3636 
July 22, 2020 
celebrate the countless Americans who 
went to the airport the day the first 
ban was announced. I want to celebrate 
the thousands of State Department em-
ployees who signed the dissent memo 
and those who resigned in protest. I 
want to celebrate Congresswoman CHU 
and Senator COONS for their tireless 
work on overturning this ban. 
Today’s vote is a culmination of all 
of their work, starting at the grass-
roots level. We have been in the strug-
gle together, and we will continue to be 
in it until this ban is in the dustbin of 
history. 
Mr. BIGGS. I reserve the balance of 
my time, Madam Speaker. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the distinguished 
gentlewoman from Michigan (Mrs. DIN-
GELL). 
Mrs. DINGELL. Benjamin Franklin 
once famously said that those who 
would give up liberty for security de-
serve neither. 
My home, Dearborn, Michigan, is 
home to the largest population of Arab 
Americans in this country. They are 
constantly targeted very irrationally. 
Yet, Michigan, unfortunately, also lays 
claim to the Michigan Militia, which 
was responsible for one of the worst 
acts of terrorism in this country. 
Muslims, Arab Americans, are my 
neighbors. They are my friends. They 
are doctors, teachers, and pharmacists. 
They are part of this country. 
Policies like the Muslim travel ban 
have no place in the United States of 
America. It disrespects freedom of reli-
gion, and it is unconstitutional. 
National security experts have been 
clear that the Muslim ban has made 
our country less safe. In fact, strong 
national security policies include pro-
tecting the fundamental pillars of our 
democracy: freedom of religion, free-
dom of speech, compassion, and justice. 
We must stand together as Americans 
against unjust policies like this. 
Mr. BIGGS. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, how 
much time is remaining? 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Ms. LEE 
of California). Both sides have 8 min-
utes remaining. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the distinguished 
gentleman 
from 
New 
Jersey 
(Mr. 
MALINOWSKI). 
Mr. MALINOWSKI. Madam Speaker, 
when President Trump first announced 
the Muslim ban, we were told it was 
temporary, 90 days, according to the 
executive order, or until we ‘‘figure out 
what the hell is going on,’’ in the 
President’s own words. 
It has been 31⁄2 years. Hundreds of 
thousands 
of 
Americans, 
including 
many of my own constituents, are still 
cut off from their loved ones, missing 
births, missing weddings, and missing 
funerals. 
We are still not admitting refugees to 
this country for the first time since we 
turned back Jews fleeing Hitler before 
World War II. And by now, we know ex-
actly what is going on. 
It has nothing to do with national se-
curity, and it never did. There has 
never been a deadly terrorist attack 
carried out in America by someone 
from any of these countries. One of 
them is Iran, after all, a country whose 
people have themselves been targeted 
for extinction by ISIS. 
How many times do we hear from the 
administration that we stand by the 
people of Iran even as we ban them 
from visiting our country? 
These good people were sacrificed for 
a cheap campaign promise. They were 
hurt, and our country’s ideals were be-
trayed, because someone decided it 
would be easier to seek scapegoats 
than solutions to our country’s prob-
lems. It is wrong, and it should stop. 
Mr. BIGGS. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the distinguished 
gentlewoman 
from 
California 
(Ms. 
LEE). 
Ms. 
LEE 
of 
California. 
Madam 
Speaker, I thank Chairman NADLER for 
yielding and for his tremendous leader-
ship. Also, I want to thank Congress-
women Chu and Jayapal for their tre-
mendous and steady leadership and 
strong support of H.R. 2214, the NO 
BAN Act. 
This important legislation would end 
the Muslim ban and prohibit discrimi-
nation and migration on the basis of 
religion and national origin. 
Let me be clear. This is a landmark 
piece of civil rights legislation not 
only for Muslims but for our country’s 
values. Our Nation was founded by, 
shaped by, and continues to be influ-
enced by our immigrant communities 
who contribute so much to this coun-
try. Equating Muslims with terrorists 
is against our values as a nation. It is 
despicable. 
Make no mistake, the NO BAN Act 
would help ensure that this kind of dis-
crimination ceases, prevents future 
such discrimination, and promotes our 
core values of religious freedom. 
Madam Speaker, we cannot allow 
President Trump’s White nationalist 
agenda to continue. We must ensure 
that our country is open to everyone, 
not just those whom Trump deems ac-
ceptable. I urge my colleagues to vote 
‘‘yes’’ on this bill. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mrs. 
DINGELL). Members are reminded to re-
frain from engaging in personalities to-
ward the President.

Mr. BIGGS. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the distinguished 
gentleman 
from 
New 
York 
(Mr. 
ESPAILLAT). 
Mr. ESPAILLAT. Madam Speaker, 
when we heard of the Muslim ban being 
implemented, many New Yorkers, in-
cluding our chairman, Congressman 
NADLER, rushed to JFK Airport to help 
families. What I witnessed there in 
many cases was, in fact, Muslim mem-
bers of our Armed Forces were trying 
to be reunited with their mother, with 
their spouse, and they were being de-
nied. 
As I entered the space, I was sur-
rounded by Customs and Border Patrol 
officers, and we fought to make sure 
that these folks could unite. And so we 
witnessed the pain of a spouse without 
a husband, a son without a mother, a 
father without a child. 
Madam Speaker, this is not Amer-
ican. This is not American at all. But 
what was witnessed there and across 
the country was the best of our Nation, 
the spirit of our Nation, the fact that 
we would not be split along racial, eth-
nic, or religious lines. 
Mr. BIGGS. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the distinguished 
gentlewoman 
from 
Michigan 
(Ms. 
TLAIB). 
Ms. TLAIB. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to declare loudly and clearly to 
every Muslim and every African person 
in Michigan’s 13th District, in Amer-
ica, and around the world that the 
United States House of Representatives 
is taking action to end this administra-
tion’s racist ban. 
Madam Speaker, I rise to send a mes-
sage to marginalized communities ev-
erywhere that, in repealing the Muslim 
and African ban, we are also preventing 
discriminatory bans from ever hap-
pening again. 
Madam Speaker, I rise as a mother of 
two wonderful Muslim-American boys, 
Adam and Yousif, to say that Muslims 
and Muslim Americans are our family 
members, our friends, and our neigh-
bors—and, yes, they are Members of 
Congress. 
Madam Speaker, it appears that this 
White House might not like that fact 
very much because this racist ban is a 
Federal endorsement of anti-Muslim 
rhetoric and discrimination in our 
country, but today we are coming to-
gether to finally put a stop to this. 
End the Muslim and African ban. 
End all discriminatory bans forever. 
Mr. BIGGS. Madam Speaker, I con-
tinue to reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the distinguished 
gentlewoman from New York (Ms. 
VELA´ ZQUEZ). 
Ms. VELA´ ZQUEZ. Madam Speaker, I 
rise in strong support of the NO BAN 
Act. 
I remember when the Muslim ban 
was first implemented in January 2017, 
I went to JFK Airport with Chairman 
NADLER to demand the release of trav-
elers being detained there. One of them 
was an Iraqi translator who had risked 
his life working for the U.S. Army in 
Iraq. His reward was being caught up in 
this hateful Trump administration pol-
icy. 
At the airport that day, I saw two 
Americas: Inside the airport was an 
America characterized by prejudice, 
weakness, and fear; but outside, where

thousands gathered to oppose this 
hateful policy, I saw the America I 
know, an America of strength and com-
passion. 
Madam Speaker, today, as we vote on 
this bill, we are being asked to choose 
between these two visions. We can 
choose a weak, bigoted America that 
says there is no place for our Muslim 
brothers and sisters or for Black peo-
ple, or we can choose an America that 
lives up to its highest ideals, that wel-
comes those from around the world 
seeking a better life. 
Mr. BIGGS. Madam Speaker, I con-
tinue to reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the distinguished 
gentleman from Virginia (Mr. BEYER). 
Mr. BEYER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
in support of JUDY CHU’s NO BAN Act. 
In the words of John Lewis: ‘‘When 
you see something that is not right, 
not fair, not just, you have to speak up; 
you have to do something.’’ 
The NO BAN Act is doing something. 
It is stating in clear, powerful legisla-
tion that America will never again let 
racism or religious intolerance be a 
barrier to lawful immigration. We will 
not allow ignorance or xenophobia to 
dictate America’s immigration poli-
cies. 
Our strength has always—always— 
been our diversity. 
A functional Muslim ban or a ban of 
entire countries simply because they 
comprise a race or a religion that some 
President does not like is not just evil, 
it is stupid. Watch which American 
communities 
recover 
most 
quickly 
from the pandemic—those with the 
most diverse populations. 
Madam Speaker, I stand here today, 
as I stood at the airport at the onset of 
the ban, to ensure our immigration 
system cannot be hijacked by hatred. 
Mr. BIGGS. Madam Speaker, I con-
tinue to reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the distinguished 
gentlewoman 
from 
California 
(Ms. 
MATSUI). 
Ms. MATSUI. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today in support of the NO BAN Act. 
Today is about our commitment to 
the most sacred of American ideals: to 
celebrate our diversity. But this ad-
ministration has embarked on a cru-
sade to demonize immigrants and our 
Muslim-American community. 
Americans and their families have 
been targeted because of their religious 
beliefs, their race, and their ethnicity. 
Because of this bigotry, families and 
loved ones have been separated, unable 
to celebrate milestones or face hard-
ships together. 
Madam Speaker, I stand here today 
because one of the greatest and most 
beautiful things about our country is 
the diversity of people, views, and per-
spectives. We cannot allow an adminis-
tration to upend our immigration sys-
tem and upend our ideals. We must al-
ways stand up and speak out. 
Madam Speaker, I remember my 
grandparents’ 
and 
parents’ 
stories 
about World War II, when they were os-
tracized and ultimately removed to in-
ternment camps. Let’s not forget this 
past xenophobic history. 
Madam Speaker, I am proud to sup-
port this bill, and I urge my colleagues 
to do the same. 
Mr. BIGGS. Madam Speaker, I am 
prepared to close, and I yield myself 
such time as I may consume. 
Madam Speaker, you have heard a lot 
of incendiary language regarding the 
travel restrictions. The most incen-
diary language is always calling it ‘‘in-
cendiary,’’ ‘‘a white nationalist agen-
da,’’ ‘‘racist,’’ ‘‘hateful,’’ et cetera. 
Was it xenophobic, was it racist, was 
it hateful when the Obama administra-
tion implemented travel bans to the 
same seven nations? 
Was it? 
No. Nor is it here either. 
Madam Speaker, that kind of lan-
guage is meant to incite public ridicule 
and distract from the real issue here. 
As the Supreme Court noted, the text 
in this bill says nothing about religion. 
And as they went on to say: ‘‘The pol-
icy covers just 8 percent of the world’s 
Muslim population and is limited to 
countries that were previously des-
ignated by Congress or prior adminis-
trations’’—read, 
Obama 
administra-
tion—‘‘as 
posing 
national 
security 
risks.’’ 
That is not a Muslim ban. This is a 
legitimate travel restriction imple-
mented for the safety of this Nation. 
Additionally, I heard from multiple 
friends across the aisle a straw man ar-
gument, a true straw man argument 
here, that this ban was religious in na-
ture. But if that were the case, they 
would have stopped it after inserting 
religion with other proscriptions. But 
instead, they built up a huge bureau-
cratic apparatus to limit the authority 
of the President of the United States. 
So it is a straw man argument. 
Madam Speaker, the chairman men-
tioned that the Supreme Court ruling, 
in his opinion, was without justifica-
tion, and so I am going to read what 
the Supreme Court said: ‘‘The Presi-
dent lawfully exercised that discretion 
based on his findings—following a 
worldwide, multiagency review—that 
entry of the covered aliens would be 
detrimental to the national interest.’’ 
The sole prerequisite, they said, is 
for the President to find that the entry 
of the covered aliens ‘‘would be detri-
mental to the interests of the United 
States.’’ 
But the President fulfilled that re-
quirement by first ordering DHS and 
other agencies to conduct a com-
prehensive evaluation of every single 
country’s compliance with the infor-
mation and risk assessment baseline. 
That is what this policy was built 
upon. It is consistent with the Obama 
administration and the previous ad-
ministrations. 
But for whatever reason, and I think 
we all can surmise what that may be, 
when this President conducts an even 
more thorough evaluation of these na-
tions and their processes and then 
issues a proclamation setting forth 
those extensive findings describing de-
ficiencies in those practices—and, by 
the way, I am going here based on the 
Supreme Court decision again—in the 
practices of select foreign govern-
ments, several of which are state spon-
sors 
of 
terrorism, 
it 
is 
somehow 
xenophobic, a white nationalist agen-
da, racist, and hateful. But when the 
previous administration did it and ac-
tually came back to Congress and 
added three more nations, it wasn’t. 
The only ad hominem attack I would 
ever make here is that it surely seems 
potentially hypocritical to me. No 
visas would be revoked pursuant to 
P.P. 9645 or 9983. Individuals subject to 
those Presidential proclamations who 
possess a valid visa or valid travel doc-
ument were permitted to travel and 
continue to be admitted to travel in 
this country. 
To call it a Muslim ban is meant to 
incite—and I will say, we do terrible on 
this side of the aisle. My friends across 
the aisle, when you find that peg to 
hang your hat on, heck of a great job, 
because everybody uses it. It is very ef-
fective, but it is highly misleading. 
What this bill does is it emasculates 
the very notion of executive power in 
the President. It really does. The idea, 
because you want to emasculate the 
power of President Trump. 
But what it does is it gives more 
power to the bureaucratic state, more 
power to the bureaucratic state. So the 
timeline is also going to prevent the 
President from acting quickly on this. 
These are the issues that we have 
just been distracted from, because it 
certainly appears—and I will say, my 
friend from Texas (Ms. JACKSON LEE), 
when she talked about symbolism in 
her speech, she is right. This is sym-
bolic. This bill is symbolic. It is sym-
bolic, if you will, of a hatred of this 
President. Because when the previous 
President’s administration did this, 
not a peep. This administration does 
the same thing, and it is outrageous. 
Madam Speaker, the implementation 
was not great. They have admitted the 
implementation was not great, but 
that is an implementation problem, 
not a policy problem. And you want to 
change the entire policy and the entire 
structure not because the policy was 
bad—if it were, we would have heard 
about it the last 40 years—but, instead, 
because the original implementation 
was bad. 
The Supreme Court has upheld what 
this administration did because what 
they did was conduct a thorough vet-
ting of their own policy regarding 
these nations and those nations’ poli-
cies in implementing safety mecha-
nisms, and so they fulfilled that. Here 
we are today, saying: You know what? 
Because it is President Donald Trump, 
this is bad. 
Madam Speaker, they are going to 
pass this bill. There is no doubt they

are going to pass this amendment. But 
never forget the inherent inconsistency 
with the act that you are going to do 
on this bill with what you have done in 
the previous administrations. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
b 1145 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, I find it extremely 
disingenuous to deny the nature of the 
Muslim ban. You know why? Because 
the President told us so. He told us he 
was going to institute a Muslim ban, 
and then he did it. And every country 
he put on the list was Muslim. Every 
country he has added to the list was 
Muslim. 
Only Muslims and Muslim countries 
pose threats to the United States of 
any nature; no one else in the world 
does? How stupid does he think we are? 
This is a Muslim ban. It has been. It 
is an abuse of his office. It is an abuse 
of the law. It must be repealed. The 
honor of the United States must be re-
deemed. And that is why this dishonor-
able, hateful policy must be repealed. 
And that is why we must vote for this 
bill, to redeem the honor of the United 
States from the disgusting religious 
bigotry supported by the President and 
instituted by the President in this ban. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Mem-
bers are reminded to refrain from en-
gaging in personalities toward the 
President. 
Ms. LOFGREN. Madam Speaker, I rise in 
strong support of H.R. 2214 the ‘‘National Ori-
gin-Based Antidiscrimination for Non immi-
grants Act,’’ or NO BAN Act. I wish this bill 
was not necessary, but unfortunately, it is now 
more imperative than ever. 
As a result of the President’s relentless at-
tempts to rewrite our immigration laws, we 
must take immediate steps to rein in his re-
peated abuse of executive authority. 
As a candidate for president, Donald Trump 
promised to ban all Muslims from entering the 
United States, suggesting—without any evi-
dence—that it would somehow make our 
country safer. Immediately upon entering of-
fice, he tried to make good on that promise. 
Ultimately, it took the President 10 months, 
3 attempts, and the inclusion of a sham waiver 
process to craft a ban that stood up to Su-
preme Court scrutiny. 
In a decision rightly criticized by Justices 
Breyer and Sotomayor—and many of us in 
this chamber—the majority concluded that de-
spite statements calling for a ‘‘total and com-
plete shutdown of Muslims entering the United 
States,’’ the President’s ban was somehow not 
inspired by blatant religious animus. Seeking 
to distance itself from these remarks, the Ad-
ministration later claimed that the ban was 
necessary to keep our country safe from ter-
rorist threats. And yet, a bipartisan coalition of 
more than 50 former national security officials 
found that rather than making our country 
safer, the ban actually undermines U.S. na-
tional security. 
H.R. 2214 not only invalidates the various 
iterations of the Muslim Ban, it also amends 
the authority the President relied on in invok-
ing the ban—section 212(f) of the Immigration 
and Nationality Act. But rather than gutting it, 
as some of my Republican colleagues have 
claimed, H.R. 2214 maintains its basic struc-
ture, and incorporates checks and balances to 
ensure that it can no longer be so flagrantly 
abused. 
H.R. 2214 will thus ensure that section 
212(f) can only be used in a manner con-
sistent with its intended purpose and historical 
norms, and that no President—Democratic or 
Republican—will be able to utilize it to usurp 
congressional authority. 
I would like to thank my friend and col-
league, Representative CHU for her leadership 
and steadfast commitment to this issue. Her 
efforts led to the introduction of this legislation 
and I urge all of my colleagues to support the 
NO BAN Act. 
Mr. SENSENBRENNER. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today in opposition to the No BAN Act. 
This bill is being framed as a ‘‘religious free-
dom’’ initiative. I have fought for religious free-
dom throughout my career. I know what reli-
gious freedom means. This bill is not about re-
ligious freedom. It is about scoring cheap polit-
ical points against President Trump. 
The President is granted broad authority to 
take quick action to limit the entry of foreign 
nationals into the United States. This is need-
ed for a variety of reasons, including national 
security and public health. Whether it is ad-
dressing shortcomings in a certain country’s 
vetting and information sharing or limiting the 
potential influx of coronavirus cases, we en-
trust the Executive Branch to keep America 
safe. 
President Trump’s actions have been mis-
labeled as a ‘‘Muslim Ban.’’ But that is not the 
case. There is no religious test anywhere in 
the President’s travel restrictions. North Korea, 
an essentially religious-less society, is one of 
the countries included. Myanmar, another 
country affected, is more than 80 percent Bud-
dhist. Indonesia, which was not included in the 
covered travel restrictions, has the largest per-
centage of the world’s Muslim population at 
over 12 percent. 
Rather than try to paint with a broad brush, 
we should look at the causes of these travel 
restrictions. Eritrea—Does not comply with the 
established identity-management and informa-
tion-sharing criteria. Kyrgyzstan—Does not 
comply with the established identity-manage-
ment and information-sharing criteria. Nige-
ria—Does not comply with the established 
identity-management and information-sharing 
criteria. And so on. 
This isn’t about religious freedom. It is only 
about convincing people it is. 
In addition to the deficiencies of the under-
lying policy, the Majority has made a mistake 
in including the Senate version of pharma-
ceutical legislation as its pay-for. 
Last year, the House Judiciary Committee 
worked on a bipartisan basis to advance two 
important bills. One to reduce the burdens of 
patent litigation when a company seeks to 
bring a complicated biosimilar drug to market. 
And another to create a new antitrust authority 
to prevent companies from playing games that 
could artificially suppress generic competition. 
Chairmen JERROLD
NADLER
and DAVID 
CICILLINE were great partners to me and then- 
Hanking Member DOUG COLLINS in that effort. 
It was refreshing during a time of increasingly 
partisan hostility to work together in a thought-
ful manner to address drug pricing in the 
country. 
Unfortunately, rather than take up that bill, 
the Majority has simply ignored our weeks of 
careful negotiation and has chosen instead to 
blindly attach the Senate language. 
The shortcomings of this version of the leg-
islation were already addressed in committee. 
The text included in the No BAN Act gives the 
FTC the authority to find a company liable 
even if all they do is introduce an improved 
version of a product and then make truthful 
and non-misleading statements about the new 
product. This will undoubtedly stifle innovation. 
Why would any company invest the necessary 
research dollars to introduce a new product, if 
they can be held liable for truthful marketing of 
that product? In Committee, we fixed that. 
The bill we’re voting on today is also out of 
step with current antitrust law. It would com-
pletely change the remedy and enforcement 
authority under traditional antitrust law, and for 
no obvious reason, apply those changes ex-
clusively to just one industry. In Committee, 
we fixed that. 
I find it troubling that the Majority is choos-
ing to abandon the good faith negotiations and 
bipartisan work. The gentlemen from New 
York and Rhode Island worked with the Minor-
ity to come up with a good product that ad-
dresses drug pricing through regular order. 
The committee process works. We should be 
voting on the legislation that passed the Judi-
ciary Committee by a voice vote. Not this 
version. 
I oppose this legislation and urge my col-
leagues to do the same. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. All time 
for debate has expired. 
Pursuant to House Resolution 891, 
the previous question is ordered on this 
portion of the divided question. 
The question is: Will the House con-
cur in the Senate amendment with the 
House amendment specified in section

enactment of this Act. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. This 
portion shall be debatable for 1 hour, 
equally divided and controlled by the 
chair and ranking minority member of 
the Committee on the Judiciary. 
The gentleman from New York (Mr. 
NADLER) and the gentleman from Ari-
zona (Mr. BIGGS) each control 30 min-
utes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from New York. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in strong sup-
port of H.R. 5581, the Access to Counsel 
Act of 2020. 
Last September, the Judiciary Com-
mittee and the House Foreign Affairs 
Committee held a hearing to explore 
the Muslim ban, including the chaos 
that unfolded at airports across the 
country when it was first announced. 
I can personally attest to that chaos, 
based on my experience at JFK Airport 
immediately after the ban was imple-
mented. 
Refugees, 
individuals 
with 
valid visas, and even lawful permanent 
residents of the United States were de-
tained for hours and prevented from 
speaking with attorneys. Some even 
had their phones taken away and were 
unable to call their family members. 
Although the issue grabbed the head-
lines then, it is unfortunately a prob-
lem that occurs daily. Due to the com-
plexity of the U.S. immigration law 
and the fact-intensive nature of ques-
tions regarding admissibility, it is not 
uncommon for some people to spend 
hours undergoing inspection by U.S. 
Customs and Border Patrol. 
During this time, individuals are 
often prevented from communicating 
with those on the outside. And if the 
individual is lucky enough to have a 
lawyer, CBP will often refuse to speak 
with them, even if they can provide 
critical information or correct a legal 
error. 
Moreover, serious consequences can 
result from being refused admission. 
For example, an individual who is 
given an expedited removal order is 
barred from returning to the United 
States for 5 years. 
H.R. 5581 will ensure that no one who 
presents themselves at a port of entry 
with valid travel documents is com-
pletely cut off from the world during 
inspection. H.R. 5581 allows such indi-
viduals, including U.S. citizens, to 
communicate with counsel and other 
parties if they are subjected to sec-
ondary inspection that lasts longer 
than one hour. 
To be clear, this bill does not provide 
a right to counsel, nor does it impose 
any obligation on the Federal Govern-
ment to pay for or otherwise provide 
counsel to individuals during CBP in-
spection proceedings. I wish it did, but 
it doesn’t. This is confirmed by the fact 
that the Congressional Budget Office 
found that H.R. 5581 would have no ef-
fect on direct spending or revenues. 
I would like to extend a special 
thanks to my colleague, Representa-
tive JAYAPAL, for her leadership on this 
issue and for championing this bill. I 
encourage my colleagues to support it, 
and I reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. BIGGS. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in opposition 
to this amendment to H.R. 2486. 
The Access to Counsel Act of 2020 is 
a way for the majority to test how far 
they can go toward their ultimate goal 
of taxpayer-funded counsel at every 
stage of the immigration process. I 
think we just heard that, that that is a 
stated goal. 
Many immigration interest groups 
have made no mystery of the fact that 
they believe foreign nationals have a 
right to come to the United States and 
should 
all 
receive 
taxpayer-funded 
counsel at every stage of the process. 
My colleagues across the aisle under-
stand that it is currently a bridge too 
far to repeal outright the Immigration 
and Nationality Act provision that pro-
hibits taxpayer-funded counsel during 
removal proceedings. But this amend-
ment is a step forward in their march 
in that direction. 
The bill mandates that the DHS Sec-
retary shall ensure that an individual 
who has been selected by Customs and 
Border 
Protection 
for 
secondary 
screening at a port of entry has a 
meaningful 
opportunity 
to 
consult 
with counsel and an interested party 
during such screening. 
It is important to understand exactly 
what secondary screening is, why it is 
used, and the ramifications that this 
bill would have on the port of entry op-
erations. 
My colleagues across the aisle pro-
vided the Judiciary Committee no op-
portunity to hear from DHS experts 
about any of these issues. There was no 
hearing on this legislation or even gen-
erally on the subject matter at hand. 
CBP is extremely concerned about 
the impact the requirements of this

bill would have on processing at ports 
of entry. Many of us have been to air-
ports and seen the long lines of pas-
sengers from abroad waiting to be proc-
essed. We have been to land ports of 
entry and seen lines of passenger vehi-
cles and cargo trucks that literally 
wait for hours for the opportunity to 
enter the U.S. The Access to Counsel 
Act would exponentially increase those 
processing and wait times. 
Secondary inspection is used at ports 
of entry to give CBP officials time for 
additional screening that may take 
longer than the normal case. It can in-
clude more in-depth questioning, addi-
tional database searches, and physical 
searches when an individual is sus-
pected of carrying contraband. 
Secondary inspection is done in an 
area 
near 
the 
primary 
inspection 
booths. It serves to remove those 
whose admissibility may be in question 
from the primary inspection line so as 
to not slow the line down. 
The vast majority of the over 400 mil-
lion people admitted the United States 
annually do not get referred to sec-
ondary inspection, but about 17 million 
do. 
Most ports of entry buildings and 
other infrastructure are not equipped 
to allow multiple counsel consulta-
tions at the same time. That means 
longer wait times and backlogs for 
entry. Allowing 17 million people to 
consult with counsel or some other in-
terested party will bring legitimate 
trade and travel to a grinding halt. 
Of course, slowing down of trade and 
travel processing isn’t the only concern 
with H.R. 5581. Under current regula-
tions adopted in 1980, applicants for ad-
mission are not entitled to representa-
tion in primary or secondary inspec-
tions, unless the applicant has become 
the focus of a criminal investigation 
and has been taken into custody. 
But this bill gives all applicants for 
admission to the U.S., including non-
immigrants and lawful permanent resi-
dents, a new statutory right to counsel. 
This idea is based on the belief that ev-
eryone has a right to enter the U.S., 
and it is a first step toward what many 
of our Democrat colleagues ultimately 
want, taxpayer-funded counsel for for-
eign nationals. 
In addition, there are serious con-
cerns with what constitutes interested 
parties under the bill. The term is de-
fined to include practically anyone, in-
cluding any relative of the covered in-
dividual, the petitioner or sponsor of a 
visa, or anyone with a bona fide con-
nection to the covered individual. 
This could result in a scenario where 
a covered individual is referred for sec-
ondary inspection because he is be-
lieved to be smuggling drugs or some 
other contraband and then places a call 
to tip off his accomplices. 
The Access to Counsel Act is a bad 
idea that would unduly hinder legiti-
mate trade and travel. I urge my col-
leagues to oppose the amendment, and 
I reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield such time as she may consume to 
the 
gentlewoman 
from 
Washington 
(Ms. JAYAPAL). 
Ms. JAYAPAL. Madam Speaker, I 
want to thank the chairman of the 
Committee on the Judiciary for his tre-
mendous work and leadership on bring-
ing these important issues to the floor. 
I am very proud that the House is 
considering my bill today, the Access 
to Counsel Act, H.R. 5581. It is a com-
monsense measure that would ensure 
that U.S. citizens, green card holders, 
and other people with legal status are 
able to consult with an attorney when 
Customs and Border Protection detains 
them for over an hour. 
I introduced this bill, Madam Speak-
er, as my first bill when I got to Con-
gress, and it was in the wake of the 
Muslim ban. It was in the wake of that 
chaos that was unleashed at airports 
across the country as people from 
seven Muslim-majority countries found 
themselves detained for hours, in some 
cases pressured to sign papers giving 
up their legal status, and in many 
cases deported. 
More often than not, these people did 
not even have the opportunity to see 
an attorney or even call anyone. They 
did not even have the opportunity to 
use the restrooms or to get water and 
food. 
Since then, however, Madam Speak-
er—it isn’t just that moment—there 
have been numerous cases of students 
detained for long periods at airports 
and sent back, despite holding valid 
visas secured after undergoing rigorous 
vetting by the State Department. One 
student was detained and deported in 
spite of a court order saying that he 
should be allowed to stay until a court 
could review his case. 
And earlier this year, we saw no less 
than 200 people of Iranian American de-
scent detained at the northern border 
in Blaine, Washington, for up to 12 
hours with no access to counsel. These 
lengthy detentions occurred while CBP 
repeatedly denied that Iranian Ameri-
cans were being targeted for different 
treatment. 
Many of the people impacted were 
U.S. citizens, as well as elderly people 
and children. Some had even undergone 
extra vetting to participate in a pro-
gram designed for trusted travelers at 
the northern border. 
A month later, CBP Acting Commis-
sioner Mark Morgan said that border 
officials ‘‘got a little overzealous in 
their actions,’’ but the damage, Madam 
Speaker, had already been done. There 
were children of U.S. citizens—they 
themselves U.S. citizens—who watched 
their parents be detained and treated 
in a way that no American citizen 
should go through. No person should go 
through that type of indignity and dis-
respect. 
If my bill were enacted into law, it 
would ensure that any time CBP de-
tains people with lawful status, then 
those individuals would simply have 
the right to call a lawyer and receive 
assistance. It does not stop CBP from 
doing its job; it does not create a right 
to counsel for everyone. This is just a 
simple phone call to their attorney. 
So I would like to thank those who 
bravely came forward to share their 
stories, to make clear the Access to 
Counsel Act is desperately needed, and 
I urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘yes.’’ 
Mr. BIGGS. Madam Speaker, just to 
point out, this bill does not say any-
where this contact will be limited to a 
simple phone call. Nowhere does it say 
that. 
Madam Speaker, I will reserve the 
balance of my time. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield such time as she may consume 
again to the gentlewoman from Wash-
ington (Ms. JAYAPAL). 
Ms. JAYAPAL. Madam Speaker, I 
just wanted to quote directly from sec-
tion 2 of my bill: ‘‘The Secretary of 
Homeland Security shall provide the 
covered individual a meaningful oppor-
tunity to consult with counsel and an 
interested party not later than one 
hour after the secondary inspection 
process commences and as necessary 
throughout the inspection process, in-
cluding, as applicable, during deferred 
inspection.’’ 
So again, this could be a phone call. 
‘‘Meaningful access’’ is a broad term 
and it takes into account my colleague 
from the other side’s concerns. 
Mr. BIGGS. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I am 
prepared to close. 
b 1200 
Mr. BIGGS. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Madam Speaker, I am interested in 
the interpretation of the term ‘‘mean-
ingful opportunity.’’ I tried a lot of 
cases in my career. I did both prosecu-
tion and criminal defense extensively. I 
can tell you what a meaningful oppor-
tunity would be as counsel. It would be 
sitting there with my client face-to- 
face, getting all the information pos-
sible. 
If the intention was to include, spe-
cifically, a simple phone call, that is 
what should have been put in here. 
That is what should have been put in 
this bill, but it wasn’t. So, when I read 
it, I think of places I have been to all 
along the border, having grown up in 
southern Arizona, and I have taken and 
led many congressional delegations 
over the last 31⁄2 years. 
I think of the Antelope Wells Port of 
Entry. I think about that being about a 
4-hour drive for the Customs and Bor-
der Protection officers that manned 
that or worked there, that staffed that. 
I think, well, what is the communica-
tions like there? It is not good. It is 
not good. It is extremely remote. The 
nearest town on the Mexican side of 
the border is 60 miles away. The near-
est town on the New Mexico side of 
that border is Lordsburg, which is 
about a good 1.5- to 2-hour drive away 
itself. 
If you really wanted to get to narrow 
this, this bill should have been nar-
rowed, but it wasn’t narrowed.

July 22, 2020 
I think of Naco, that little port of 
entry in southern Arizona. I think of 
Douglas. I am telling you, the problem 
that this bill has is it doesn’t—if that 
is the goal. There are other problems, 
but if that is the goal, this language 
has not been specific enough. 
I also have talked with those who 
have had the secondary inspection. If 
we are referring to the implementation 
of the travel restriction—and I think 
the world, including the administra-
tion, admitted that it was rolled out 
poorly—that is a different animal than 
what happens on a normal basis. 
I think of the San Luis Port of Entry 
or the Nogales Port of Entry, but, par-
ticularly, San Luis. It gets so much 
traffic through there. I can’t imagine 
what will happen when you try to bog 
down everything by allowing everyone 
who moves to a secondary inspection 
have counsel or some other interested 
party, who we don’t really know who 
that is. That is not defined very well, 
either. 
I think of all the commercial truck 
traffic that comes through Nogales. We 
don’t inspect but a small fraction of ve-
hicles coming through there. It is very 
difficult to move traffic. The infra-
structure itself is not conducive to 
this. 
I will just say, the one thing I was re-
minded of as I was reviewing this bill 
for this debate today—and it really 
kind of came out in the debate when 
someone was talking about this notion 
of where we are now, which is if you be-
come a focus of a criminal investiga-
tion, you do get counsel. You get that 
opportunity for counsel. 
I started thinking that, yes, exactly, 
this is what we are doing. We are say-
ing now, in a civil administrative func-
tion, we are going to give you a right 
to counsel. Are we going to expand 
that to every area where there are civil 
administrative regulatory violations or 
potential violations? The answer is 
that would be absolutely, totally bi-
zarre. It would be unworkable, just as 
this will be unworkable. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield such time as he may consume to 
the 
gentleman 
from 
Massachusetts 
(Mr. KENNEDY). 
Mr. KENNEDY. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the chairman for moving this 
legislation forward and to our col-
league, Ms. JAYAPAL, for extraordinary 
work on this legislation. 
Madam Speaker, you can learn an 
awful lot about a country by its ap-
proach to justice. You learn about its 
values, about the people it protects 
first, about the arc of its history, about 
the injustice it tolerates and the in-
equities it reinforces. 
When you aim that spotlight on our 
Nation, what it reveals is not pretty. It 
is not something to be proud of. Be-
cause for millions of people who call 
this Nation home, justice is not a guar-
antee. It is something withheld. It is 
something far too many will never ex-
perience. 
Very few battle that injustice more 
frequently than immigrants who arrive 
on our shores and at our border because 
they believe in the promise of our Na-
tion. If we believe in that same promise 
as fiercely as they do, we shouldn’t be 
scared to provide them with justice, 
with, at the very least, access to legal 
counsel. 
Madam Speaker, we need to pass this 
bill to, at the very least, take a small 
step forward in living up to those 
ideals, and we need to do it today. 
Mr. BIGGS. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Madam Speaker, I will just say this, 
I appreciate the sponsor of this indi-
cating that, in their interpretation, a 
simple phone call would suffice. I don’t 
think that is the way CBP is inter-
preting this. I think they are inter-
preting this that they are going to 
have to build out infrastructure so 
there can be private facilities for coun-
sel to meet with these folks. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
have no other speakers, and I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. BIGGS. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself the balance of my time. 
Madam Speaker, I just want to go 
back to this and indicate there are a 
multiplicity of issues with this bill, but 
some things that I want to reiterate. 
I think the bill is a step forward to 
providing 
state-funded 
counsel 
for 
folks who are here getting a secondary 
inspection, which in the vast majority 
of cases is almost perfunctory and inci-
dental and is very quick, in the normal 
case. 
Again, I think it is bad facts—or, ac-
tually, good facts to make the argu-
ment. It is not going to make good pol-
icy. You are, again, arguing implemen-
tation of the travel restriction, which 
wasn’t great. 
But the norm—the norm—if you get 
down to the border and spend time, as 
I have many times, you are going to 
see these secondary inspections are 
short, perfunctory. There is no need of 
counsel. They almost always turn out 
well for the person that is delayed, ex-
cept for when they are a danger. Then, 
it becomes a problem, and they get an 
opportunity for counsel because now 
you have a criminal focus on them. 
That is the key here. 
So, expanding this to civil cases, 
which is exactly what you are doing 
here, and putting us in line to walk 
down to where we ultimately are going 
to pay for that, that is not great pol-
icy. That is bad policy, and I am urging 
my folks to oppose this. 
Madam Speaker, I yield the balance 
of my time. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself the balance of my time. 
Madam Speaker, I find it bizarre to 
suggest that you shouldn’t vote for a 
bill because some other bill may do 
something that you don’t like. This 
bill does not provide—I personally 
think maybe it would be a good idea, 
but that is not this bill. This bill does 
not provide for funded counsel in any 
way. It doesn’t do that. Maybe I should 
introduce a bill to do that. That is not 
this bill, so let’s forget about that. 
This bill simply says that if an indi-
vidual is held—an individual who may 
be an America citizen, who may be a 
green card holder, who if improperly, 
by mistake, is sent out of the country 
and may be forbidden from applying to 
come back in for 5 years, with all kinds 
of problems, who may be a cancer re-
searcher who is supposed to work at 
Rockefeller Institute or Johns Hopkins 
or wherever and would be denied his or 
her talents because of a mistake. 
All this bill says is that if someone is 
held in secondary inspection for at 
least an hour, they must be given an 
opportunity to call counsel, to call 
other people, to call their brother-in- 
law, to call whoever, and to commu-
nicate. That is all the bill says. 
I fail to understand why it is at all 
controversial. It will prevent the kind 
of tragic mistakes that have been made 
in the past. It will prevent the kind of 
confusion that we saw, that I person-
ally saw at the airport when people 
were held for hours and hours and 
weren’t permitted to talk to counsel 
standing outside the door, when I phys-
ically had to prevent the door from 
closing and dared them to arrest a 
Member of Congress in order to allow 
an immigrant with valid papers to 
speak to an attorney who was standing 
on the other side of the door. 
That is what this bill is. It is simple. 
It is humane. It is commonsensical and 
ought to be adopted. I urge everyone to 
vote for this bill. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, as an 
original cosponsor and senior member of the 
Committee on the Judiciary, I rise in strong 
and enthusiastic support of H.R. 5581, the 
‘‘Access to Counsel Act of 2020,’’ which en-
sures that certain individuals who are sub-
jected to prolonged inspection by U.S. Cus-
toms and Border Protection (CBP) at ports of 
entry have a meaningful opportunity to com-
municate with counsel and other interested 
parties. 
This important legislation amends section 
235 of the Immigration and Nationality Act 
(INA) to require the Department of Homeland 
Security (DHS) to ensure that certain individ-
uals can communicate with counsel and other 
interested parties if they are subjected to pro-
longed inspection by CBP. 
The protections afforded by the Access to 
Counsel Act of 2020 would apply to individuals 
who possess valid travel documents, but who 
are pulled out of the ‘‘primary’’ inspection line 
and referred to ‘‘secondary’’ inspection for ex-
tended processing. 
If such individuals are held in secondary in-
spection for at least one hour, they must be 
permitted to communicate with counsel and 
other interested parties. 
Counsel and interested parties would be 
able to provide information and documentation 
to the inspecting officer to facilitate the inspec-
tion process and offer support and assistance

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H3642 
July 22, 2020 
Madam Speaker, the stakes can be high for 
a person wrongfully refused admission and the 
consequences of being denied admission to 
the United States can be significant. 
For example, a U.S. research institution 
may lose the opportunity to employ a next 
generation cancer researcher if that re-
searcher is denied admission despite pos-
sessing a valid nonimmigrant visa. 
Individuals who are refused admission may 
be unable to reunite with their families, receive 
critical medical care unavailable in their home 
country, or pursue higher education at a U.S. 
college or university. 
Although some individuals may be permitted 
to withdraw their application for admission and 
return home without long term consequences, 
others may be ordered removed without a 
hearing or further review under ‘‘expedited re-
moval.’’ 
An individual who receives an expedited re-
moval order is barred from returning to the 
United States for five years. 
Communication protocols are inconsistent 
across ports of entry and CBP provides no 
public guidance on an individual’s ability to 
communicate with counsel and other individ-
uals during the inspection process. 
According to an American Immigration 
Council report, CBP policies and practices on 
access to counsel vary from one office to an-
other.’’ 
While some ports of entry completely bar 
counsel in primary or secondary inspection,’’ 
others provide specific procedures for inter-
acting with counsel or provide the inspecting 
officer with broad discretion to decide whether 
and with whom to communicate. 
Madam Speaker, the Access to Counsel Act 
of 2020 ensures that no one is cut off from the 
world due to the Administration’s hasty and 
mismanaged rollout of the Muslim ban and the 
widespread chaos that it engendered at air-
ports across the nation. 
Affected individuals were detained at air-
ports for hours, and many were sent back to 
their home countries without the ability to con-
tact their families or receive the assistance of 
counsel. 
Reports of similar treatment surfaced in Jan-
uary 2020, as tensions between Iran and the 
United States escalated and up to 200 individ-
uals of Iranian descent were detained and 
questioned in secondary inspection at the 
Peace Arch Border Crossing in Blaine, Wash-
ington. 
These individuals—many of whom were 
U.S. citizens or permanent residents, including 
seniors and children—were held for several 
hours, with some reportedly held for up to 12 
hours. 
Madam Speaker, although complications in 
the inspection process can arise in response 
to sweeping changes in immigration policy or 
shifting world events, the greatest impact on 
individuals comes from the consistent lack of 
access to counsel and other assistance at 
ports of entry on a day-to-day basis. 
All individuals—including U.S. citizens—who 
seek to lawfully enter the United States are 
subject to inspection by CBP officers at ports 
of entry. 
Without access to counsel and other parties, 
many individuals are refused admission or 
issued an expedited removal order instead of 
being provided the chance to vindicate their 
rights and lawfully enter the country. 
The Access to Counsel Act will ensure indi-
viduals who are seeking to lawfully enter the 
United States are treated fairly and with dig-
nity. 
The bill permits counsel and interested par-
ties to appear in person at the port of entry, 
but also gives DHS and CBP enough discre-
tion to determine—based on operational and 
other practical limitations—how the consulta-
tion takes place. 
The bill provides extra protection for lawful 
permanent residents (LPRs) by prohibiting 
DHS from accepting a Record of Abandon-
ment of Lawful Permanent Resident Status 
from an LPR without first providing the LPR a 
reasonable opportunity to consult with coun-
sel. 
Madam Speaker, the Access to Counsel Act 
of 2020 is supported by an impressive coali-
tion of highly respected organizations, includ-
ing: Amnesty International; American Civil Lib-
erties Union (ACLU); America’s Voice; Amer-
ican Immigration Lawyers Association (AILA); 
Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights; Immi-
gration Hub; and National Iranian American 
Council (NIAC). 
I urge all Members to join me in voting to 
pass H.R. 5581, the Access to Counsel Act of 
2020. 
Ms. LOFGREN. Madam Speaker, I rise in 
support of H.R. 5581, the ‘‘Access to Counsel 
Act of 2020’’, a bill that will ensure that individ-
uals who lawfully present themselves at our 
ports of entry are treated fairly and allowed to 
communicate with counsel and other parties if 
they are subjected to prolonged inspection. 
The Immigration and Nationality Act pro-
vides individuals in removal proceedings the 
right to representation at no expense to the 
government. Although federal regulations ex-
tend this right to immigration-related ‘‘exami-
nations,’’ applicants for admission—specifically 
those in primary or secondary inspection—are 
excluded unless they become the focus of a 
criminal investigation. 
However, our immigration laws are complex, 
and so are some questions regarding an indi-
vidual’s admissibility. 
Access to outside assistance is important to 
ensure that CBP has a complete under-
standing of the facts and the law before decid-
ing admissibility. That is because grave con-
sequences can result from being refused ad-
mission—consequences that extend well be-
yond simply turning around and getting back 
on a plane. 
Individuals who are refused admission may 
be unable to reunite with their families or re-
ceive critical medical care unavailable in their 
home country. They may be turned away from 
a U.S. employer who desperately needs their 
skills. Or they may be denied the opportunity 
to pursue higher education at a U.S. college 
or university. 
If that weren’t enough, they could also be 
subject to a 5-year bar to returning to the 
United States if they are issued an expedited 
removal order. 
That is why this legislation is so critical. 
By allowing individuals who lawfully present 
themselves for inspection at a port of entry to 
communicate with counsel or other interested 
parties with information relevant to their re-
quest for admission, CBP will be better 
equipped to correctly resolve legal uncertain-
ties and individuals will be treated more equi-
tably. 
I would like to thank my friend and col-
league, Representative JAYAPAL for her leader-
ship and commitment to this issue. Her efforts 
led to the introduction of this legislation, and I 
urge all my colleagues to support the Access 
to Counsel Act. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. All time 
for debate has expired. 
Pursuant to House Resolution 891, 
the previous question is ordered on this 
portion of the divided question. 
The question is: Will the House con-
cur in the Senate amendment with the 
House amendment specified in section 
4(b) of House Resolution 891? 
The question was taken; and the 
Speaker pro tempore announced that 
the ayes appeared to have it. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, on 
that I demand the yeas and nays. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to section 3 of House Resolution 
965, the yeas and nays are ordered. 
Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, fur-
ther proceedings on this question will 
be postponed.

MOTION TO CONCUR 
Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Speaker, I have 
a motion at the desk. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Clerk will report the motion. 
The Clerk read as follows: 
Mr. Grijalva moves that the House concur 
in the Senate amendments to H.R. 1957. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the order of the House of July 
21, 2020, the motion shall be debatable 
for 80 minutes, with 1 hour equally di-
vided and controlled by the chair and 
ranking minority member of the Com-
mittee on Natural Resources and 20 
minutes equally divided and controlled 
by the majority leader and minority 
leader or their respective designees. 
The gentleman from Arizona (Mr. 
GRIJALVA) and the gentleman from 
Utah (Mr. BISHOP) each will control 30 
minutes. The gentleman from Mary-
land (Mr. HOYER) and the gentleman 
from California (Mr. MCCARTHY) each 
will control 10 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from Arizona (Mr. GRIJALVA). 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days in which to 
revise and extend their remarks and in-
sert extraneous material on H.R. 1957. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Arizona? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
In February of 2019, I flew to Arizona 
from Washington to speak about my 
bill to permanently protect the Grand 
Canyon from uranium mining. We 
wanted to publicly release the legisla-
tion on the rim of the canyon to show 
firsthand the lands that we were at-
tempting to protect. 
Unfortunately, the weather had other 
ideas. That night, before the event, it 
snowed more than it had in decades. 
But by some small miracle, the roads 
were clear, and we found an easy path-
way into the park. We made it in time 
and even found some rangers to help us 
set up in the snow. 
Tribal leaders representing people 
who have called that land their home 
for a millennia joined us at the event. 
Standing there with them on the edge 
of the amazing canyon millions of 
years in the making and glistening in 
the snow, it was hard not to be moved. 
Looking out over the Grand Canyon, 
you are reminded why we as a Nation 
have dedicated ourselves to protecting 
the unique and enduring landscapes 
around us. Nowhere else on Earth is 
there a sight quite like the Grand Can-
yon, or, for that matter, like Yosemite 
Valley or Yellowstone National Park. 
These places are gems of our National 
Park system, and they show who we 
are as a people. 
We are judged on what we choose to 
pass on, and today we have an oppor-
tunity to reaffirm our commitment to 
preserving these lands for the future 
and for future generations. 
In a few short minutes we will vote 
on the Great American Outdoors Act, a 
bill to significantly increase conserva-
tion spending in the United States. For 
too long we have allowed our National 
Parks to fall into disrepair. We have 
underfunded maintenance while park 
visitation has skyrocketed. At the 
same time, we have failed to meet the 
full promise of the Land and Water 
Conservation Fund. We have been di-
verting half of this conservation fund-
ing stream to other uses for which this 
money was never intended. 
Today, we take the opportunity to 
remedy both those failures. The Great 
American Outdoors Act provides $1.9 
billion per year to maintain our Na-
tional Parks and public lands, ensuring 
that special places like the Grand Can-
yon are accessible to all Americans as 
they were to me on that February 
morning. 
The law will also make an enduring 
commitment to protecting green and 
flourishing open spaces by providing 
$900 million annually to the Land and 
Water Conservation Fund. 
This funding will mean more parks 
for inner city families. It will allow us 
to 
protect 
forests, 
wetlands, 
and 
marshes from the destruction of cli-
mate change. It will help protect lands 
around the National Parks from inap-
propriate development and will expand 
recreational access and opportunity for 
all Americans. Combined, these two 
major programs amount to one of the 
biggest wins for conservation in dec-
ades. 
We all know that not everyone here 
agrees about the value of these pro-
grams. In fact, we disagree almost 
daily on how best to protect the land-
scapes of our Nation. 
But I hope today we can move past 
those political differences and to hon-
estly consider the value of conserva-
tion and the importance of stable, pre-
dictable funding. 
We have a generational opportunity 
to ensure America’s crown jewels are 
protected. We have a unique chance to 
ensure that every tool is available to 
help us respond to the climate crisis, so 
that we can protect those landscapes 
that best protect clean water, clean 
air, and healthy green spaces. 
This bill is a major win for the Amer-
ican people, decades in the making, I 
might add. I have pursued it for years. 
Some of my colleagues have pursued it 
for years. This didn’t happen over-
night. 
Now, during a time of national dis-
illusionment, it is perhaps more nec-
essary than ever to demonstrate that 
we can still bridge the divide. 
When it comes to passing along this 
Nation to our children and to theirs, 
we can still work together to find com-
mon ground. 
This bill goes beyond politics. It is 
about ensuring that we pass along a 
legacy of public lands stewardship and 
conservation to future generations, so 
they, too, can marvel at the Grand 
Canyon covered in snow. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my col-
leagues to support this important 
measure. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Let’s get a couple of things very 
clear. 
First of all, this is not about the 
Land and Water Conservation Fund. 
We reauthorized permanently the Land 
and Water Conservation Fund in the 
last Congress, and in doing that, in a 
House Republican bill, I might add, we 
took the State-side projects—these are 
the kinds of things like easements and 
picnic grounds and roads and parks 
that your constituents are all telling 
you that they like, those are called the 
State-side projects—and we actually 
increased the funding for those pro-
grams. 
We also put in that act a limitation 
on the amount of money that could be 
used to buy more land. This bill is 
about that concept, the limitation of 
land acquisition. The special interest 
groups have been putting pressure on 
you and are giving you misinformation 
about this particular thing. They sim-
ply want to circumvent the limits that 
were pushed in that bill that was there 
earlier. 
This is two bills merged together. 
The first one was the old H.R. 1225, the 
backlog maintenance bill that Mr. GRI-
JALVA referred to in his speech. We

wanted to see if we could actually help 
parks and other public lands who are 
having a maintenance backlog that is 
near $20 billion today. 
Many people, 330 people, cosponsored 
that bill. Obviously, it was popular. 
But for 11⁄2 years, Democratic leader-
ship failed and refused to move that 
bill. One of their arguments was, this is 
key, there is no offset for a bill that 
scored $7 billion. They refused to move 
it because there was no offset. 
That bill would fund parks’ mainte-
nance backlogs by taking excess rev-
enue from those that come from all the 
energy development, but primarily oil 
and gas, off-coast as well as on land, 
and after we pay our obligations, the 
first $1 billion of the excess would be 
used to maintain our parks. That is 
still a decent bill. 
You have added that, or the Demo-
crats in the Senate have added that, to 
a second bill that is mandatory $900 
million of spending. That mandatory 
spending will be from now until eter-
nity, but the goal of that is simply to 
increase the buying power to buy more 
lands, not to create the State-side 
projects which we increased. 
We are spending trillions of dollars 
on coronavirus emergency spending. 
We still have to pay for that. If you 
really think that mandatory increasing 
of our debt is the right policy, I think 
there is a problem there because the 
CBO did say that this new concoction— 
bill scores at $17 billion. And I want 
you to notice there is no offset for that 
in this bill. 
Both House Republicans and House 
Democrats have rules that they will 
not bring a bill to the floor that is not 
offset. The Blue Dog Democrats unani-
mously wrote a letter to their leader-
ship saying, Do not bring a bill to the 
floor that is not offset. 
This violates the rules of both the 
Democrats and the Republicans clearly 
and adds $17 billion to the debt, and the 
reason this is here is, well, because. 
Both LWCF, as well as what we want 
to do with park maintenance, is paid 
for by royalties from those gas and oil 
explorations. The excess was to go to 
parks. We already have obligations 
with those royalties. GOMESA is an 
obligation. Historic preservation is an 
obligation. State reimbursement is an 
obligation. Those are priorities. 
Now, we are also saying in this bill, 
the $1 billion of money to buy more 
land is now also a priority above and 
beyond what is happening for the parks 
and what will get there for the parks, 
which may not in normal times be a 
concern, but in this era, CRS has al-
ready certified that we are 84 percent 
lower in the amount of activity and the 
amount of royalties coming in from 
our energy development than we were a 
year ago. That is 2 million barrels of 
oil a day less than we were producing 
and getting royalties from them last 
year. 
So if buying more land is the pri-
ority, the maintenance of our backlog 
could be totally left out. 
Now, this is not for wont of what we 
are trying to do. There were amend-
ments to try and fix this, but they were 
not allowed to be brought to this floor. 
There are amendments in the Senate to 
fix these problems, but they were not 
allowed to be brought to the floor. 
There will be many on both sides of the 
aisle, some on our side, who will sup-
port and defend this bill. 
I will remind you we are having a 
heat wave here in Washington, D.C. 
For the first time in four years we are 
coming close to 100 degrees, but the 
heat index is well into three digits. 
There are a lot of people suffering from 
heat stroke. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
5 minutes to the gentleman from South 
Carolina (Mr. CUNNINGHAM), a sponsor 
of the legislation, companion legisla-
tion to the Senate bill. 
b 1230 
Mr. CUNNINGHAM. Mr. Speaker, I 
rise today in support of my bill, the 
Great American Outdoors Act, and to 
express my gratitude for so many of 
my friends and colleagues, including 
the 252 cosponsors from both sides of 
the aisle who are working with me to 
secure the greatest achievement for 
conservation in a generation. 
Mr. Speaker, my bipartisan legisla-
tion gives Congress a chance to deliver 
a massive win not only for our irre-
placeable parks and public lands, but 
also for this institution as a whole by 
showing the American people that we 
can work together and keep our prom-
ises. 
The Great American Outdoors Act 
will honor our Nation’s commitment to 
conservation in two important ways. 
First, it fully and permanently funds 
the Land and Water Conservation 
Fund, our most important conserva-
tion program. LWCF preserves the best 
of America, ensuring hunting, fishing, 
boating, hiking, and other recreational 
access for all of our constituents. 
It is the backbone of our $778 billion 
economy, which accounts for over 5 
million jobs across this country. It pro-
tects working forests and the jobs that 
they support in the woods and the 
mills. And here is the best part: It does 
it all without spending a dime of tax-
payer money. 
Despite this, we have consistently 
fallen 
short 
in 
utilizing 
the 
full 
amount of funds in LWCF. Over the 
past 55 years, we have only spent half 
the money that we have deposited in 
the 
fund, 
thereby 
creating 
an 
unsustainable 
backlog 
in 
the 
Lowcountry and across this Nation. 
This legislation will fix that, ensuring 
at long last that these funds are spent 
how they were intended. 
Second, it will relieve the growing 
multibillion-dollar maintenance back-
log in our national forests, parks, and 
other Federal public lands. From crum-
bling roads and eroding trails to aging 
water systems and deteriorating his-
toric sites and visitor centers, the 
widespread disrepair of our national 
treasures is only getting worse. The 
Great American Outdoors Act will ad-
dress this as well by making essential 
investments to reverse the damage, 
while creating over 100,000 jobs in the 
process. 
Mr. 
Speaker, 
this 
legislation 
is 
grounded in two basic principles: that 
Congress should invest funding set 
aside for conservation towards the pub-
lic good, and that we should pay the 
maintenance bills we have already ac-
crued. It is time that we honor our 
promises. 
In South Carolina, the LWCF has 
protected the hallowed ground of Fort 
Sumter, the living outdoor classroom 
of Congaree National Park, the Pitt 
Street Bridge in Mount Pleasant, the 
Folly Beach Boardwalk, and literally 
hundreds of other local and State 
parks. 
In my district, LWCF protected the 
ACE Basin, which is the largest unde-
veloped estuary on the Atlantic Coast, 
providing a home for the area’s incred-
ible wildlife, a source of recreation for 
sportsmen and -women, and a natural 
safeguard for our coastal communities 
from devastating weather events. 
Just this past week, I heard from our 
veterans about the important role that 
public lands play in the healing process 
for many men and women transitioning 
back to civilian life. They told me how 
access to nature and the outdoors has 
helped them find a sense of calm and 
peace. 
The power of these places to heal and 
unite us reaches all the way back here 
to Washington, where my bill is sup-
ported by the Speaker, by the minority 
leader, and by a large bipartisan major-
ity. Seventy-three Senators have al-
ready voted for this bill, and President 
Trump has specifically asked for us to 
send it to his desk. 
In this current climate of division 
and discord, the Great American Out-
doors Act is exemplary of the fact that 
Republicans and Democrats can still 
come together to pursue commonsense 
solutions, do right by our public lands, 
and keep our word. 
Mr. Speaker, I invite all my col-
leagues to join me in supporting our 
communities, families, public lands, 
and economy by voting to pass the 
Great American Outdoors Act. 
Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentleman from 
Idaho (Mr. SIMPSON) to explain why 
mandatory spending is good. 
Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
my good friend from Utah for yielding. 
I know that was painful. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in favor of the 
Great 
American 
Outdoors 
Act. 
It 
makes sense to me that, if we are going 
to have public lands and preserve pub-
lic lands for Americans, we should also 
take care of it. That is why the LWCF 
funding and deferred maintenance part 
of this bill are very important and a 
perfect combination. 
With that in mind, I wrote the LAND 
Act in 2017, which funded these two

programs without using a dime of tax-
payer money. 
Fast-forward to 2020 and the Presi-
dent specifically asked Congress to 
send him a bill that funded both these 
programs and that he would sign it. 
Thanks to Senator GARDNER, Senator 
DAINES, Senator HEINRICH, and Senator 
MANCHIN, the Great American Outdoors 
Act built upon the LAND Act and 
passed the Senate with 73 votes, which 
brings us to this historic day. 
The Great American Outdoors Act 
creates 100,000 jobs, preserves public 
lands for future generations, and cares 
for our current national parks and 
trails. All this is funded by energy rev-
enue and the existing $20 billion fund— 
again, not taxpayer dollars. 
The bill does not expand the Federal 
footprint because 99 percent of the 
LWCF purchases are within existing 
public lands. 
The bill does not force anyone to sell 
their property since it is willing seller 
and willing buyer. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of this 
bill not for me and not for you, but for 
future generations so that they can 
enjoy our great outdoors. 
Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
2 minutes to the gentleman from Cali-
fornia (Mr. COX), a member of the Nat-
ural Resources Committee. 
Mr. COX of California. Mr. Speaker, 
today is a great day for public lands, 
for land conservation, for outdoor 
recreation, and for every American 
who values these gifts that Mother Na-
ture has provided for our country. 
Last year, we made a promise to the 
American people to protect their pub-
lic lands, our national treasures, by 
permanently reauthorizing the Land 
and Water Conservation Fund as part 
of the John Dingell Conservation, Man-
agement, and Recreation Act. Today, 
we are poised to make good on that 
promise by passing the Great American 
Outdoors Act, which will permanently 
and fully fund the LWCF. I am proud to 
be an original cosponsor of that bill. 
These funds have not just protected 
our Nation’s most well-known national 
parks, but, over the years, LWCF dol-
lars have also created parks, ball fields, 
and other outdoor recreational spaces 
in every corner of our country from 
Alaska to Florida, from Maine to Ha-
waii. 
This also includes many communities 
in my district, such as Mendota, 
Huron, 
Selma, 
Sanger, 
Parlier, 
Lemoore, 
Corcoran, 
Allensworth, 
Shafter, Buttonwillow, McFarland, and 
Arvin, just to name a few. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank the bipartisan 
team of my colleagues and activists 
who have worked hard to make this 
legislation a reality. 
There is an old East Asian proverb 
that says: One generation plants the 
trees for another generation to enjoy 
the shade. Today, we are replanting 
those trees. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
vote in support of this bill. 
Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentleman from 
Ohio (Mr. STIVERS). 
Mr. STIVERS. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today in support of the Great American 
Outdoors Act. 
My district has 120 projects that ben-
efit from the Land and Water Con-
servation Fund, from community parks 
to the Wayne National Forest, to the 
Hopewell Culture National Historical 
Park. 
Public lands, forests, and parks give 
folks the opportunity to connect with 
the outdoors and with each other, espe-
cially in this time of the coronavirus. 
I also represent a bunch of small 
businesses, 
like 
Rocky 
Boots 
in 
Nelsonville that employs 2,800 people 
and depends on a thriving outdoor 
recreation economy. 
In my district last year, $1.37 billion 
was spent on outdoor recreation. And 
at a time when there is such a backlog 
in maintenance, this maintenance sup-
port will create 100,000 jobs. 
During a time when we have 11.1 per-
cent unemployment, Congress should 
be taking every opportunity it can to 
create jobs. 
Mr. Speaker, this bill isn’t just about 
conservation, it is about jobs and the 
economy, and I urge my colleagues to 
vote ‘‘yes.’’ 
It is a Senate bill that passed the 
Senate 73–25. It is not perfect, but it is 
a good bill, and it is a bill we should 
support. 
Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Or-
egon (Ms. BONAMICI). 
Ms. BONAMICI. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today in support of the Great American 
Outdoors Act. 
Protecting wilderness reflects the 
best values of Oregon: environmental 
protection, stewardship of our land, 
and community partnership. 
The Land and Water Conservation 
Fund represents a bipartisan commit-
ment to safeguarding natural areas and 
providing recreation opportunities in 
the prized outdoor areas that make 
places in northwest Oregon, like Ecola 
State Park and the Tualatin National 
Wildlife Refuge, so special. Unfortu-
nately, the program has faced signifi-
cant instability in recent years, lim-
iting the long-term planning needed for 
meaningful conservation efforts. 
Last month, I joined my colleagues 
on the Select Committee on the Cli-
mate Crisis in releasing a bold, com-
prehensive, science-based climate ac-
tion plan. Our plan for solving the cli-
mate crisis recognizes the value of pub-
lic lands and healthy ecosystems in se-
questering carbon dioxide and pro-
moting biodiversity, and it calls for a 
full and permanent funding for the 
Land and Water Conservation Fund. 
The Great American Outdoors Act 
will help mitigate the climate crisis 
and protect the natural beauty and ro-
bust habitats that fish and wildlife de-
pend on for survival. 
At a time when our communities are 
struggling to recover from the eco-
nomic consequences of the coronavirus 
pandemic, a time when there is height-
ened awareness about the inequities 
and injustices in our society, including 
inequitable access to our wild places, 
this bill will boost rural economies and 
expand access to public lands for future 
generations. 
I am also pleased that this bill takes 
steps to tackle our national park main-
tenance backlog to support treasured 
places like the Lewis and Clark Na-
tional Historical Park. Oregonians care 
deeply about protecting our parks, for-
ests, scenic areas, and wildlife refuges, 
and this bill takes important steps to 
safeguard them for future generations. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman GRI-
JALVA for his leadership, and I urge all 
of my colleagues to support this bill. 
Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman 
from Indiana (Mrs. WALORSKI). 
Mrs. WALORSKI. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to support the Great American 
Outdoors Act. 
Our Nation’s public lands have long 
been treasured sources of enjoyment 
and beauty available to every Amer-
ican. They also play a critical role in 
our economy, with the outdoor recre-
ation industry supporting 5.2 million 
jobs. 
The hardworking Hoosiers I rep-
resent know that better than anyone. 
Manufacturers 
in 
northern 
Indiana 
build products like boats, trailers, and 
80 percent of the Nation’s RVs. That is 
why Elkhart, Indiana, is known as the 
RV Capital of the World. 
I am a proud cosponsor of the Great 
American Outdoors Act because it will 
support RV and boat manufacturers 
and their workers, promote conserva-
tion, and revitalize our national parks. 
By investing in long-delayed mainte-
nance projects, it will ensure our na-
tional parks can continue to be enjoyed 
by all Americans for generations to 
come. By enhancing access to our pub-
lic 
lands, 
it 
will 
boost 
tourism, 
strengthen our economy, and support 
good-paying jobs. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
join me in voting for the Great Amer-
ican Outdoors Act. 
Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
2 minutes to the gentleman from Cali-
fornia (Mr. COSTA), the senior member 
of the Natural Resources Committee. 
Mr. COSTA. Mr. Speaker, I thank the 
chairman for his efforts to bring this 
legislation to the House floor. 
I rise today to speak on the Great 
American Outdoors Act and the impor-
tance of this legislation and why we 
should move on a bipartisan effort to 
pass it. 
This bill tackles a tremendous de-
ferred maintenance backlog on public 
lands, including our national parks, 
our treasures, the great American na-
tional parks. 
This funding will contribute towards 
making our parks safe and enhance the 
recreational access, such as the great 
Yosemite National Park, the crown 
jewel in California, as well as Kings 
Canyon and Sequoia National Parks 
and many others—not only in Cali-
fornia, but across our Nation—that are

part of America’s heritage and a part 
of our lasting legacy for future genera-
tions to come. 
This bill funds the Land and Water 
Conservation Fund annually at $900 
million and creates a $9.5 billion fund 
for deferred maintenance on public 
lands. 
We are way in arrears in terms of de-
ferred maintenance that we need to do 
not only for our national parks, but for 
our public lands. That is why this is so 
important. 
Let me respond to the issue of our 
deficit. 
Our deficit is a problem. I am a Blue 
Dog. But let’s be clear. After 16 years 
here, I have come to the conclusion 
that trying to address incremental 
issues as they relate to our national 
deficit is not going to get us there. 
Until Republicans are willing to ad-
dress the issues of revenues and Demo-
crats are willing to address the issues 
of expenditures together and jump off 
that cliff holding hands to balance rev-
enues and expenditures, we are just not 
going to get there. Okay? 
So we should not use that as an ex-
cuse not to do what we should do for 
today’s generation and future genera-
tions. The creation of this permanent 
funding highlights the need for Con-
gress to address the deferred mainte-
nance backlog. 
I will admit that we are not doing 
more to provide funding for our aging 
Federal water infrastructure that also 
needs to be invested on. 
So let me close. Let’s take the mo-
ment of this bipartisan success to re-
double our efforts to address the need 
for maintenance on federally owned 
projects. 
b 1245 
Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield myself 2 minutes. 
This bill is actually extremely poorly 
drafted. It assumes basic things. But if, 
for instance, as we said, the royalties 
don’t show up as we are anticipating, 
we don’t have that $1 billion to buy 
more land. How do you solve that? Do 
you prorate that money? Do you take 
it from other sources? Do you put this 
mandatory spending above other man-
datory spending, like Social Security? 
CRS said those are good questions, 
and they don’t know because this bill 
is silent on all those questions. 
It says the President is supposed to 
come up with $900 million of projects. 
What if he only comes up with $800 mil-
lion? Who gets that extra $100 million? 
Does that go to the Department of the 
Interior? Is that a slush fund? 
Once again, CRS said, Good ques-
tions, and no one knows because this 
bill is silent on those types of ques-
tions. 
BLM has no idea of how much money 
they have spent on this program or 
where the land is. The State portion is 
actually—they are okay because they 
are a percentage. But this is talking 
about a dollar figure. 
So you are going to hear a lot of 
platitudes, but somebody, at some 
time, has got to say how this money is 
going to actually be funded. 
To help us with that, I yield 1 minute 
to the gentleman from Nebraska (Mr. 
FORTENBERRY), a longtime member of 
this legislature, who can address those 
things. 
Mr. FORTENBERRY. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the ranking member for the 
time, and perhaps we can continue that 
discussion in another venue because 
today I am rising in support of this act. 
Mr. Speaker, a while back I was at 
the Library of Congress and I met the 
famous filmmaker, Ken Burns and he 
taught me something. He spoke to us 
about the creation of the National 
Park System last century and how it 
represented a singular defining mo-
ment for America; our sense of vast-
ness, openness, and endless oppor-
tunity, and regenerated for us an un-
derstanding of an American ethos, this 
great ideal of conservation, caring for 
what we have and transferring it into 
the future. 
Mr. Speaker, our National Park sites 
are majestic places, great sources of 
national pride, and a living heritage for 
all Americans. But here is the problem: 
We have a backlog of maintenance, but 
we fix it today. 
Along with providing certainty for 
the future of the Land and Water Con-
servation Fund, this all is a great boost 
to communities eager for innovation 
and conservation ideals. 
Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
2 minutes to the gentlewoman from 
New Mexico (Ms. HAALAND), who is vice 
chair of the full Committee of Natural 
Resources 
and 
chair 
of 
the 
Sub-
committee on National Parks, Forests, 
and Public Lands. 
Ms. HAALAND. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today in support of the Great American 
Outdoors Act. 
From the day I became the chair-
woman of the National Parks, Forests, 
and Public Lands Subcommittee, I 
have heard from constituents, col-
leagues, and advocates about fixing the 
maintenance backlog and fully funding 
LWCF and making it permanent. 
LWCF 
has 
helped 
provide 
rec-
reational opportunities for underserved 
and low-income communities in nearly 
every Congressional district, and last 
year, we passed an historic permanent 
authorization. 
In my district, LWCF has supported 
the Valle del Oro National Wildlife Ref-
uge, Petroglyph National Monument, 
Tingley Beach recreation area, the 
Elena Gallegos Open Space picnic area, 
and Martineztown Park. 
The great American Outdoors Act 
will ensure LWCF’s full $900 million is 
used every year for conservation and 
environmental protection, to boost 
local outdoor economies, and to pro-
tect intact ecosystems essential for 
adapting to climate change. 
The bill also establishes the National 
Park Service and Public Land Legacy 
Restoration Fund to provide five Fed-
eral land management agencies with up 
to $9.5 billion over 5 years to address 
the deferred maintenance backlog on 
our public lands. 
These agencies will now be able to 
aggressively address deferred mainte-
nance, improve visitor services, and 
support Tribal communities in places 
like Carlsbad Caverns, White Sands Na-
tional Parks, Chaco Culture National 
Historical Park, and El Malpais Na-
tional Monument. 
Repairing the crumbling infrastruc-
ture on our public lands today is crit-
ical so that future generations can 
enjoy them. I am proud of the work we 
did to get this bill to this point, and I 
urge my colleagues to invest in our Na-
tional Parks and public lands, and vote 
‘‘yes’’ on the Great American Outdoors 
Act. 
Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentleman from 
Texas (Mr. HURD). 
Mr. HURD of Texas. Mr. Speaker, 
Teddy Roosevelt once remarked that: 
We have fallen heirs to the most glorious 
heritage a people have ever received, and 
each one must do his or her part if we wish 
to show that the nation is worthy of its good 
fortune. 
Passage of the Great American Out-
doors Act proves we are worthy of the 
good fortune and glorious heritage of 
our National Parks. 
Future generations have been count-
ing on us to ensure these treasures can 
be visited for another 100 years and, 
with the funding secured in this bill, 
we aren’t letting them down. 
In 1893, Katharine Lee Bates was in-
spired hiking up Pikes Peak, and she 
penned the following lines: 
O beautiful for spacious skies 
For amber waves of grain 
For purple mountain majesties 
Above the fruited plain. 
America, America 
God shed His grace on thee 
And crown thy good with brotherhood 
From sea to shining sea. 
Passage of this bipartisan bill is a 
triumphant act that will benefit count-
less generations to come. 
Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
2 minutes to the gentleman from Colo-
rado (Mr. NEGUSE), a member of the 
Natural Resources Committee. 
Mr. NEGUSE. Mr. Speaker, I am 
proud to speak today in support of the 
Great American Outdoors Act. I would 
like to thank my colleague from Ari-
zona, 
the 
distinguished 
chairman, 
Chairman GRIJALVA, for his leadership; 
and also thank my colleague from 
South 
Carolina, 
Representative 
CUNNINGHAM, for introducing this bill. 
The Great American Outdoors Act, as 
you have heard today, Mr. Speaker, 
would provide full and permanent fund-
ing for the Land and Water Conserva-
tion Fund, and address the significant 
maintenance backlog on our Nation’s 
public lands. 
Since its inception, the LWCF pro-
gram has established many of our Na-
tion’s most coveted and incredible pub-
lic lands. The program has invested in 
over 41,000 parks, including Rocky 
Mountain National Park, Arapaho and 
Roosevelt National Forests, Lory State

Park, and so many other iconic parks 
in my district, the Second Congres-
sional District of the State of Colo-
rado. 
Nearly 1,000 LWCF grants have lever-
aged over $147 million dollars for local 
government and State park invest-
ments in Colorado. In my district 
alone, there have been 191 LWCF 
projects. Therefore, establishing per-
manent and full funding truly is crit-
ical. 
Additionally, deferred maintenance, 
as you have heard my colleagues on 
both sides of the aisle discuss today, on 
our public lands is a mounting problem 
that we can no longer afford to ignore. 
As one of our country’s most popular 
National Parks, Rocky Mountain Na-
tional Park faces a significant mainte-
nance backlog of $84 million. Our park 
employees are working incredibly hard, 
but they can’t do it alone. We must ad-
dress this by increasing funds designed 
to upkeep and rebuild infrastructure on 
our Federal public lands. 
I have consistently urged Congress to 
fully fund LWCF and address these 
challenges, and I am so heartened to 
see this collaborative effort considered 
on the House floor today and, of 
course, grateful to the county commis-
sioners, and to so many local officials, 
conservation groups, anglers and out-
door recreation businesses who have 
come together to contribute their time 
and dedication to this effort. Let’s get 
this bill passed. 
Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentleman from 
Pennsylvania (Mr. FITZPATRICK). 
Mr. FITZPATRICK. Mr. Speaker, I 
rise today as the lead sponsor of the 
Great American Outdoors Act, and this 
is a very, very big day for this Cham-
ber. 
As my colleagues are aware, I have 
been pushing to both permanently re-
authorize and permanently fund the 
Land and Water Conservation Fund lit-
erally since the day I entered this 
Chamber. 
In addition to the LWCF, this legisla-
tion tackles the maintenance backlog 
that needs to be addressed on public 
lands and parks across our great Na-
tion. 
Mr. Speaker, this bill will have a 
positive impact on nearly every single 
Congressional District in this country, 
and the LWCF has already had a posi-
tive impact on many sites in my dis-
trict alone, most notably, Nockamixon 
State Park. 
Hundreds of businesses, recreation, 
and environmental groups have come 
together to endorse our legislation, in-
cluding the Backcountry Hunters & 
Anglers, the League of Conservation 
Voters, the Audubon Society, the Nat-
ural Resources Defense Council, Ducks 
Unlimited, Clean Water Action, and 
the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. 
Mr. Speaker, this bill is historic; it is 
bipartisan; it is bicameral, with over 
250 cosponsors in the House. It over-
whelmingly passed the Senate, and it 
will be signed into law by the Presi-
dent. That is what is called bipartisan 
cooperation. 
Mr. Speaker, for those of us who are 
strong advocates of our environment, 
this is a good day. I urge my colleagues 
to vote ‘‘yes.’’ 
Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
2 minutes to the gentleman from Cali-
fornia (Mr. LEVIN), a valued member of 
the Natural Resources Committee 
Mr. LEVIN of California. Mr. Speak-
er, I am extremely fortunate to rep-
resent a coastal district with many be-
loved 
beaches, 
lagoons, 
and 
State 
parks. In California’s 49th Congres-
sional District, our public lands bring 
outdoor recreation and joy to our resi-
dents, and also to many tourists and 
visitors looking to catch some of our 
famous waves or hike our scenic trails. 
This defining aspect of California 
culture continues to make commu-
nities in my district not only economi-
cally 
stronger, 
but 
also 
active, 
healthier, and happier, with locals and 
tourists alike enjoying all the benefits 
and spaces that the great outdoors 
offer. 
The LWCF is famously known as 
America’s most successful conserva-
tion program. This historic bill is an 
all-around win for our communities, 
benefiting local economies, and pro-
tecting our planet for future genera-
tions. 
Thus far, California has received ap-
proximately $2.5 billion in LWCF fund-
ing over the last 50 years, which has 
helped to protect iconic places, like 
San Onofre State Beach, Carlsbad 
State 
Beach, 
San 
Clemente 
State 
Beach, Torrey Pines Beach and Nature 
Reserve, and several flourishing la-
goons, all in my district. 
We are not just protecting those 
iconic places with this bill; we are also 
investing in our fight against the cli-
mate crisis. By conserving natural re-
sources across the country, we are safe-
keeping critical landscapes, fragile eco-
systems, and important wildlife habi-
tat which are all part of the ecosystem 
we depend on. 
As we continue to invest in coastal 
conservation of wetlands, estuaries, 
dunes, and reefs, we are contributing to 
climate change adaptation planning 
and protecting our coastal commu-
nities from extreme weather events, 
sea level rise, and bluff erosion. These 
efforts to combat the climate crisis are 
incredibly important for the 50-plus 
miles of coastline in my district. 
I am proud to support the Great 
American Outdoors Act, and I hope 
this historic conservation legislation 
will soon become law, as it is certainly 
among the biggest bipartisan environ-
mental accomplishments we have had 
in many years. 
Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentleman from 
North Carolina (Mr. MCHENRY). 
Mr. MCHENRY. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the ranking member for his friendship 
and his encouragement. Maybe not en-
couragement on this specific bill, but I 
am proud to support this bill because it 
does help with the maintenance back-
log in the National Parks, as well as 
assist with the long-term reauthoriza-
tion of the Land and Water Conserva-
tion Trust, which is something I 
strongly support. 
Since its inception over 50 years ago, 
the Land and Water Conservation 
Trust has done very important things 
for my State and our Nation in pre-
serving access to public lands and to 
the great outdoors. 
Also, for the maintenance backlog, I 
am proud to represent a piece of the 
Blue 
Ridge 
Parkway, 
which 
runs 
through my district and was the second 
most visited National Park last year. I 
think this year would be the same. 
In North Carolina alone, we have 
over 260,000 jobs that are directly at-
tributable to the great outdoors; and 
those millions of visitors that come to 
the State through the Blue Ridge 
Parkway, they are vital for our econ-
omy in western North Carolina. 
Passage of this bill will help, both 
the backlog and with ensuring that we 
have long-term reauthorization on the 
Land and Water Conservation Trust. I 
encourage a ‘‘yes’’ vote. 
Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
2 minutes to the gentlewoman from 
Michigan (Mrs. DINGELL), an effective 
member and a leader on the Natural 
Resources Committee. 
Mrs. DINGELL. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
my wonderful chairman. 
I rise in strong support of the Great 
American Outdoors Act. This historic 
legislation makes good on our commit-
ment to preserve our Nation’s environ-
mental heritage for future generations. 
This is an emotional moment for me. 
It provides full permanent funding for 
the Land and Water Conservation 
Fund, landmark conservation legisla-
tion that my late husband, John Din-
gell, wrote and helped establish in 1964. 
The LWCF funding has protected 
Michigan and the Nation’s critical nat-
ural resources, while supporting local 
economies, creating jobs, and providing 
opportunities for outdoor recreation 
throughout the country. 
b 1300 
LWCF was permanently authorized 
in 2019 as part of the John D. Dingell, 
Jr. Conservation, Management, and 
Recreation Act but has received full 
funding only twice in its long history. 
The permanent full funding in this leg-
islation is the culmination of decades 
of work by the conservation commu-
nity; my late husband; and our wonder-
ful current dean, DON YOUNG, who first 
advocated for this permanent funding 
through the Conservation and Rein-
vestment Act in 1999. 
Additionally, the National Parks and 
Public Land Legacy Land Restoration 
Fund included in the legislation will 
allow us to finally address the $22 bil-
lion deferred maintenance backlog in 
our Nation’s public lands, a decades- 
long problem in the making. 
I am proud today to stand with my 
colleagues on both sides of the aisle to

continue that Dingell conservation leg-
acy—I don’t look like the greatest out-
doors girl, but I know how important 
they are—which represents the boldest, 
most comprehensive conservation ef-
fort in decades. 
Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentleman from 
New York (Mr. ZELDIN). 
Mr. ZELDIN. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the ranking member for yielding. As an 
original cosponsor of this legislation, I 
would also like to thank my colleagues 
on both sides of the aisle in both Cham-
bers for helping lead the charge to get 
this important victory across the fin-
ish line. 
I represent the First Congressional 
District of New York. It is a district al-
most completely surrounded by water 
on the east end of Long Island. In my 
district alone, the Land and Water 
Conservation Fund has provided fund-
ing for over 65 parks, and that is just 
one example of the impact this pro-
gram has made all across our great Na-
tion. This supports public access, fish-
ing, hunting, recreation, and our envi-
ronment. 
After securing permanent authoriza-
tion last year, it is an honor to con-
tinue the fight today. I am not sure 
about everyone else, but being cooped 
up over the course of these last few 
months has probably given just about 
all of us more appreciation for the 
great outdoors. 
This is an effective program that will 
go a long way in keeping our magnifi-
cent outdoors great for generations to 
come. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support this bill. 
Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Speaker, before 
I yield to the next speaker, let me echo 
the words of Mrs. DINGELL. John Din-
gell was indeed a warrior on behalf of 
the Land 
and 
Water Conservation 
Fund. Today is a culmination of those 
efforts in which he played such a huge 
role, and I would be remiss in not 
thanking him and DEBBIE DINGELL. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the 
gentleman from California (Mr. THOMP-
SON), who is a leader in conservation 
and access to our public lands. 
Mr. THOMPSON of California. Mr. 
Speaker, I thank the chairman for 
yielding. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong 
support of this historic legislation that 
I was proud to coauthor. It has been 
more than 55 years since the Land and 
Water Conservation Fund was enacted 
to establish recreation and conserva-
tion opportunities. Now is the time to 
ensure that LWCF is fully and perma-
nently funded. 
This bill will create jobs and boost 
local economies that are currently fac-
ing significant financial hardships due 
to the COVID–19 pandemic. 
It also provides urgent funding of $9.5 
billion to fix broken park infrastruc-
ture and failing facilities. The bill sup-
ports parks in every State so hikers 
and anglers alike can visit and enjoy 
nature across our beautiful country. 
This is desperately needed now for our 
communities’ emotional and physical 
well-being. 
Mr. Speaker, we need to protect and 
preserve our lands, and this bill does 
that at no expense to our taxpayers. I 
urge my colleagues to vote for this im-
portant legislation. 
Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from 
the 
State 
of 
Washington 
(Mr. 
NEWHOUSE). 
Mr. NEWHOUSE. Mr. Speaker, I 
would like to thank the gentleman 
from Utah for letting me weigh in on 
this important subject. 
Mr. Speaker, the hunters and an-
glers, farmers and ranchers, and hikers 
and recreationists of central Wash-
ington are passionate advocates for ac-
cess to public lands. 
I strongly stand behind my constitu-
ents in supporting the restoration of 
our national parks, our public lands, 
and Federal infrastructure. That is 
why I am proud to cosponsor the Re-
store Our Parks and Public Lands Act 
to address our country’s deferred main-
tenance backlog in those areas. If that 
bill were brought to the floor before us 
today, I would be a resounding ‘‘yes.’’ 
Unfortunately, that is not the bill 
that we are debating here this after-
noon. So while I agree with many pro-
visions within the Great American 
Outdoors Act, I fear that the sweeping 
nature of this legislation will have un-
intended consequences for rural com-
munities like mine in Washington’s 
Fourth District. 
Mr. Speaker, just 2 weeks ago, I was 
honored to welcome Secretary of the 
Interior David Bernhardt to the north- 
central region of my district in central 
Washington. These were the two main 
takeaways from the conversations that 
we had with citizens in that region: 
one, a lack of trust with the Federal 
Government; and, two, the need for 
hope in the face of many challenges 
facing rural communities. 
While I believe the intentions behind 
this legislation are grounded in the de-
sire to improve our public lands, too 
many of my constituents think the ap-
proach within this bill is indicative of 
the same tired notion that we have all 
heard before: I am from the govern-
ment, and I am here to help. 
We have already determined the Fed-
eral Government’s culpability in cre-
ating a $20 billion maintenance back-
log problem on our public lands. So the 
response is to permanently spend $900 
million a year, most of which will be 
spent on what? Get this, Mr. Speaker: 
purchasing more Federal land. 
The farmers, ranchers, and hard-
working men and women of my district 
support local management and control 
of our lands. We have seen firsthand 
the delinquency of the Federal Govern-
ment, and I think we should work to 
continue to support our national parks 
but vote this bill down. 
Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
1 minute to the gentlewoman from 
Florida (Ms. MUCARSEL-POWELL). 
Ms. 
MUCARSEL-POWELL. 
Mr. 
Speaker, the Everglades, Dry Tortugas, 
and Biscayne National Parks are three 
of our south Floridian national parks 
that are magnificent parks that we 
cherish across our country. They are 
essential to preserving biodiversity, 
improving air quality, providing rec-
reational opportunities, and sustaining 
our physical and mental well-being. 
They are also essential to our econ-
omy, bolstering local economies across 
our Nation, supporting countless jobs, 
and breathing life into our small busi-
nesses. 
Unfortunately, our national parks 
are in need of help. Hiking trails are in 
disrepair, roads are crumbling, visitor 
centers are falling apart, and our lands 
are in need of protection. 
That is why passing today’s bill, the 
Great American Outdoors Act, is so 
crucial. It will permanently reauthor-
ize the Land and Water Conservation 
Fund to address our severe mainte-
nance backlog and ensure that these 
natural beauties will be there for our 
children and our grandchildren. 
With the passage of this bill, Mr. 
Speaker, the ecotourism economies in 
both Miami-Dade and Monroe Counties 
will flourish. I urge support. 
Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from 
Oklahoma (Mr. KEVIN HERN). 
Mr. KEVIN HERN of Oklahoma. Mr. 
Speaker, I thank Ranking Member 
BISHOP for his work on this issue. 
Mr. Speaker, in the wake of a global 
pandemic unlike anything we have 
seen in our lifetime, we have spent un-
precedented amounts of money this 
year. We have already saddled the next 
generation 
with 
unthinkable 
debt. 
Digging our way out of this hole is 
going to take time and targeted effort. 
We cannot continue to spend as if our 
debts don’t exist. 
This legislation needlessly increases 
the deficit. The Land and Water Con-
servation Fund, which is already in-
credibly well-funded, does not need an 
additional $900 million a year in per-
petuity. With immediate health needs 
and economic recovery our top prior-
ities, increasing the Federal real estate 
holding shouldn’t be on anyone’s to-do 
list. 
A recent report showed that 40 per-
cent of LWCF funds went to projects 
that failed to advance any agency ob-
jectives. The oversight and account-
ability of the fund is laughable, but 
this bill seeks to exacerbate the lack of 
transparency by removing elected offi-
cials from the situation altogether and 
handing unilateral power to political 
appointees and unelected bureaucrats. 
There are more productive ways that 
we should spend our time this week, 
and I urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘no’’ 
on this bill. 
Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
1 minute to the gentleman from Lou-
isiana (Mr. RICHMOND). 
Mr. RICHMOND. Mr. Speaker, let me 
say that the goal of the bill is positive, 
but how it is achieved is just flat 
wrong.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H3650 
July 22, 2020 
To pay for this legislation, what we 
do is go straight to Alabama, Mis-
sissippi, Louisiana, and Texas and take 
$1.9 billion a year of potential revenue 
to those States to uplift their people to 
pay for this bill. 
Let me be specific about Mississippi, 
Alabama, and Louisiana. They rank 
48th, 49th, and 50th in terms of quality 
of life for their residents. They rank 1, 
2, and 5 in terms of their African-Amer-
ican population. 
So, what are we doing here, in this 
time of racial inequity? We are going 
to Alabama, Mississippi, and Louisiana 
and taking $1.9 billion a year without 
sharing any of that revenue with their 
States where: they can improve edu-
cation, where all three rank last; they 
can improve healthcare, where all 
three States rank last; and they can 
improve their environment, where all 
three States are in the bottom one- 
third. 
So, all I am saying is, at some point, 
equity demands that those States get 
their fair share. 
Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Speaker, I 
reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
1 minute to the gentlewoman from New 
Jersey (Ms. SHERRILL). 
Ms. SHERRILL. Mr. Speaker, New 
Jersey might be the Garden State, but 
it is also the most densely populated 
State 
in 
this 
country. 
So, 
New 
Jerseyans know the importance of 
clean air, clean drinking water, and 
protecting our natural resources. That 
is why I am proud to lead the Great 
American Outdoors Act with my col-
leagues. 
Grant funding from the Land and 
Water Conservation Fund has helped 
protect sites in my district and helped 
expand conservation efforts from the 
Great Swamp National Wildlife Refuge 
to 
Morristown 
National 
Historical 
Park. The Great American Outdoors 
Act will make the Land and Water 
Conservation Fund permanent, ensur-
ing that future generations of Ameri-
cans are able to access our natural 
wonders. 
For too long, LWCF’s promise of pro-
tecting our Nation’s public lands has 
been broken as the funds have been di-
verted. The GAOA would, for the first 
time, mandate that such funds are used 
as intended to protect public lands and 
waters, support public access, and pro-
vide an economic boost to commu-
nities. 
I am so glad Congress has stepped up 
to expand equitable access to the out-
doors by investing in our parks and 
public lands at all levels. 
Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from 
Louisiana (Mr. GRAVES), who is an ac-
tive member of our committee, is rank-
ing member of another committee, and 
who can actually springboard on Mr. 
RICHMOND’s comments about this par-
ticular issue. 
Mr. 
GRAVES 
of 
Louisiana. 
Mr. 
Speaker, I want to thank the ranking 
member for yielding. 
‘‘Quick, there is a global pandemic. 
Let’s spend billions of dollars repairing 
fences, putting up new signs, and fixing 
toilets at our wildlife refuges, parks, 
and forests,’’ said no one ever. Ever. 
I have been sitting here listening to 
this debate over the last several min-
utes, and I have no idea what planet 
people are on right now. 
There is a global pandemic right now. 
What this legislation does is it takes 
everything else and puts it on the back 
burner. That is right. Unemployment 
assistance goes behind this; job oppor-
tunities go behind this; improving our 
schools and getting our kids actually 
educated go behind this; medical care 
for our seniors goes behind this because 
this is mandatory spending. 
Mr. Speaker, I have heard Members 
sit here and say that we have a $20 bil-
lion maintenance backlog. Do you 
know why that is? Because we failed to 
appropriate the money because we have 
determined it is not a priority in the 
appropriations process. 
Why are we now stepping in and cir-
cumventing that whole process again, 
Mr. Speaker, in the middle of a pan-
demic to determine that this is the 
greatest priority? 
Mr. Speaker, let me give you an anal-
ogy of what this bill really does. This 
is like someone going over to their 
neighbor’s house, taking their credit 
card, and going out there and using 
that credit card to get a new address 
sign in their front yard and maybe to 
get a new coating of paint on their 
house. Meanwhile, that person who 
took the credit card has multiple cars 
and has an expansive real estate hold-
ing and never thought once about their 
own financial situation but instead 
took the credit card of their neighbor 
who is maybe up to their neck in med-
ical bills because their spouse is on 
their deathbed. That is what this bill 
does. 
b 1315 
I have heard people say: ‘‘Well, oh, 
this is not taxpayers’ money.’’ 
Whose money is this? What dream 
world are you living in? This abso-
lutely is funds that are taxpayer funds. 
‘‘Oh, but it comes from energy reve-
nues.’’ 
Where do those go? They go into the 
general treasury. This isn’t excess 
money. This isn’t some money tree. 
Mr. Speaker, let me tell you about 
one of the most offensive things about 
this bill that my friend CEDRIC RICH-
MOND, Congressman RICHMOND, talked 
about. And he tried to address this in 
committee by proposing a bipartisan 
amendment with Congresswoman SE-
WELL, 
with 
Congressman 
BENNIE 
THOMPSON, with Congressman SCALISE, 
with myself, and others, a bipartisan 
amendment to fix this. 
Virtually all of the money that this 
bill is spending comes from energy pro-
duction off the coast of Louisiana. This 
bill, as many have said, this goes on in 
perpetuity. In 5 years, we are spending 
$1 billion a year; in 10 years, $1 billion 
a year; in 50 years, $1 billion a year; in 
100 years, $1 billion a year. 
Mr. Speaker, do you realize that 
today 28 percent of this country is 
owned by the Federal Government—28 
percent? 
The sensible thing to do is to look at 
those assets, determine which of, for 
example, the nearly 75,000 different Na-
tional Park’s units and assets still 
make sense today. You just heard my 
friend talk about how 40 percent of 
these funds historically have been used 
for projects that don’t advance the 
mission of the very agency they are 
supposed to be advancing. 
This is a tone-deaf piece of legisla-
tion. It is mandatory spending. It is 
putting this as a higher priority than 
everything else, including that we are 
in a global pandemic. We have record 
unemployment. 
Whose idea was it to do this? This is 
absolutely crazy. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge opposition to this 
legislation. I urge common sense, and I 
urge that we sit down and actually ad-
dress some of the priorities. 
Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
1 minute to the gentleman from Mary-
land (Mr. HOYER), the distinguished 
leader. 
Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman for yielding. 
Mr. Speaker, I came in at the end of 
my friend from Louisiana’s discussion. 
I have great respect for Mr. GRAVES 
and I have great respect for his con-
cern, but, very frankly, the things he 
talks about have been pending in the 
United States Senate for 60 days 
untended. 
The leader of the Senate said the 
States can go bankrupt. The sense of 
priority apparently does not exist 
there, and that is regrettable. 
This legislation that I rise in support 
of is an important piece of legislation. 
If, however, it displaced any of those 
priorities 
of 
which 
the 
gentleman 
spoke, I would perhaps share his opin-
ion. We are waiting for some of those 
priorities to be attended to by the Sen-
ate, even if they defeat them. 
We have talked about healthcare. We 
have talked about equal rights. We 
have talked about campaign finance re-
form. We have talked about energy. We 
have talked about so many subjects 
that are pending silently untended in 
the United States Senate. So the 
wringing of hands about this legisla-
tion pressing out other priorities I 
think is not accurate. 
It is accurate that this is an impor-
tant piece of legislation that will do 
much good. And I thank Chairman GRI-
JALVA on the Committee on Natural 
Resources for steering the legislation 
before us through his committee and 
working with the Senate to get it 
passed through that body. 
Mr. Speaker, I also thank the rank-
ing member for his concern about the 
maintenance and upkeep of our parks. 
He and I have spoken about that. 
I would especially like to thank Rep-
resentatives 
Cummings,

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H3651 
July 22, 2020 
who just spoke before me—Congress-
man 
COX, 
Congresswoman 
TORRES 
SMALL, Congresswoman HORN, and Con-
gressman GOLDEN for leading this legis-
lation in the House, along with my 
good friend MIKE
SIMPSON
from the 
State of Idaho. 
It should be noted that the bill before 
us today bears the name of our dear 
and departed friend John Lewis, who 
understood that conserving America’s 
great outdoors and public spaces went 
part and parcel with protecting the leg-
acy of civil rights. 
Mr. Speaker, he was, as you know, 
instrumental in protecting the child-
hood home, neighborhoods, and church 
associated with Dr. Martin Luther 
King, Jr., in Atlanta—one of America’s 
great leaders—as part of our National 
Park System, using the Land and 
Water Conservation Fund as a critical 
tool in that process. 
The Ebenezer Baptist Church and its 
visitor center are among the many 
sites in need of repair today. It was, of 
course, in Ebenezer in Atlanta, in 1957, 
that a young John Lewis joined Dr. 
King and other civil rights pioneers to 
create the Southern Christian Leader-
ship Conference. What an eerie and 
poignant coincidence the bill before us 
is numbered 1957. 
Mr. Speaker, I would like to think 
that John is still here with us, guiding 
us forward in spirit to continue on the 
good work he started in Congress some 
30 years ago. 
Last year, when we enacted a perma-
nent reauthorization of the Land and 
Water Conservation Fund—a great ac-
complishment of this Congress and, 
yes, this President—we made it clear 
that doing so was only the first of a 
two-step process. 
The second step was making sure 
that the Land and Water Conservation 
Fund is permanently paid for. That is 
what this bill does today, with nearly 
$1 
billion 
annually 
in 
mandatory 
spending to sustain the fund and sup-
port critical Federal, State, and local 
conservation projects across this Na-
tion. 
Mr. Speaker, not only that, but the 
bill creates a new fund that will help 
address the maintenance backlog in 
protecting some of our most iconic na-
tional parks. The impact of these in-
vestments will be felt not only in tour-
ism and improved public access to our 
public lands, but also in a cleaner and 
healthier environment over the long 
term. 
In my home State of Maryland, we 
have used the fund to protect some of 
our most historic sites, protecting na-
ture so that every American might 
have the same opportunity to enjoy the 
sanctity of nature or contact with our 
history. 
I was personally proud to have 
worked to protect the watershed and 
the viewshed of George Washington’s 
Mount 
Vernon 
site 
permanently 
through the creation of Piscataway 
Park on our side, Maryland’s side, of 
the river. 
We also used the fund to protect the 
Patuxent Research Refuge established 
to support wildlife research, Douglas 
Point in Nanjemoy, and countless sites 
throughout the Chesapeake Bay region. 
In all, Maryland has received, over 
the years, over $230 million from the 
Land and Water Conservation Fund to 
preserve our State’s most treasured 
landscape and historic places. 
Mr. Speaker, this bill before us 
passed the Senate on a strong bipar-
tisan vote 73–25—in other words, three- 
quarters of the United States Senate— 
and I believe we will demonstrate, 
hopefully, similar overwhelming sup-
port in the House later today. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my col-
leagues to join in making this critical 
investment in America’s public lands 
that will conserve them for the enjoy-
ment of generations to come. I ask 
them to join me, as well, in helping to 
secure the legacy of our friend JOHN 
LEWIS. 
Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield 11⁄2 to the gentleman from Idaho 
(Mr. FULCHER). 
Mr. FULCHER. Mr. Speaker, I rise in 
opposition to this legislation. While I 
understand the merits of the bill and 
while some of my colleagues support it, 
I still have concerns. 
I spent a lot of time in the rural 
counties of Idaho. Residents and local 
governments, understandably, have se-
rious concerns regarding additional 
Federal land acquisition, especially at 
a time when Federal resources are 
stretched so thin. 
The 
Federal 
Government 
doesn’t 
have the resources to manage the land 
and are often prevented from allowing 
local involvement. Translation: More 
Federal land equals less land being in-
telligently managed and, often, more 
wildlife. 
Currently, about two-thirds of Ida-
ho’s land mass is controlled by the 
Federal Government. That means less 
property tax, more D.C. bureaucracy, 
reliance on grant programs like Secure 
Rural Schools, Payments in Lieu of 
Taxes, and the ramifications of associ-
ated strings inevitably attached. 
I am also concerned about our grow-
ing national debt, now over $24 trillion. 
And while I appreciate that this bill 
utilizes revenue streams from future 
oil and gas receipts, it is still ulti-
mately taxpayer money. That author-
izes permanent funding, and any time 
there is permanent funding, that also 
raises a red flag. 
Mr. Speaker, to be a wise steward of 
the people’s money, Congress should 
regularly reevaluate programs that it 
funds, not automatically renew appro-
priations. 
Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
1 minute to the gentlewoman from 
California (Ms. PELOSI), our distin-
guished Speaker, whom I thank for 
helping guide this important piece of 
legislation to the floor and to a vote 
today. 
Ms. PELOSI. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman for yielding, and I thank 
him for being a lifelong champion of 
environmental justice and environ-
mental stewardship as chair of the 
Committee on Natural Resources. 
Mr. Speaker, as a Californian, as an 
American, as Speaker of the House, I 
proudly rise in support of the Great 
American Outdoors Act, one of the 
most important conservation and pub-
lic lands bills in decades. 
This 
legislation 
builds 
on 
the 
progress made here by House Demo-
crats and others earlier in our majority 
when we passed the John D. Dingell, 
Jr. Conservation, Management, and 
Recreation Act, named for our former 
colleague, a fitting testament to Chair-
man DINGELL’s legacy, which made per-
manent the authorization for the Land 
and Water Conservation Fund. 
Mr. Speaker, the Great American 
Outdoors Act—I love the title—takes 
the next step in our pro-conservation 
agenda, as it boldly protects our coun-
try’s natural and cultural heritage for 
our children, our grandchildren, and 
generations to come. 
This legislation reflects the energy 
and expertise of our freshmen, and I 
particularly salute and thank Con-
gressman JOE
CUNNINGHAM
of South 
Carolina. Congressman CUNNINGHAM is 
a former ocean engineer, now serving 
on the Committee on Natural Re-
sources, who was the lead author on 
this legislation. 
Mr. Speaker, in passing this legisla-
tion, Congress is ensuring that Amer-
ica lives up to its conservation prom-
ises, as we finally permanently fund 
the Land and Water Conservation Fund 
at levels that were promised. 
Over 55 years, the Land and Water 
Conservation Fund has provided over 
$17 billion in funding for over 40,000 
recreational and conservation initia-
tives in every county in the country, 
creating 
and 
protecting 
America’s 
iconic landscapes like the Grand Can-
yon and historical sites like the Martin 
Luther King, Jr. National Historical 
Park. 
Some of California’s most treasured 
natural areas benefited from the pro-
tection provided by the Land and 
Water Conservation Fund, including 
Joshua Tree, Lake Tahoe, and the 
Golden Gate National Recreation Area 
in the San Francisco Bay Area. 
The Land and Water Conservation 
Fund also addresses environmental in-
justice by creating green spaces near 
low-income communities and commu-
nities of color across the country, per-
manently. Funding the LWCF will en-
sure that we preserve our natural her-
itage in an equitable manner to ensure 
that all communities can benefit. 
The Great American Outdoors Act—I 
love the name, as I said—also makes an 
urgently needed investment in our na-
tional parks, which face a crippling $12 
billion deferred maintenance backlog. 
Our parks are critical to preservation 
of our natural and cultural heritage, 
and we must ensure that they can be 
enjoyed for generations to come.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H3652 
July 22, 2020 
The Great American Outdoors Act 
enjoys overwhelming bipartisan sup-
port both in the Congress and across 
the 
country. 
Nearly 
900 
national, 
State, and local groups representing 
small businesses, ranchers, sportsmen, 
veterans, outdoor recreationists, and 
conservation organizations have writ-
ten in support of this legislation shar-
ing these thoughts: 
‘‘The Great American Outdoors Act 
will ensure a future for nature to 
thrive, kids to play, hunters and an-
glers to enjoy. National parks and pub-
lic lands provide access to the outdoors 
for hundreds of millions of people every 
year and habitat for some of our coun-
try’s most iconic wildlife.’’ 
b 1330 
It goes on: ‘‘These treasured places 
also tell the stories that define and 
unite us as a Nation. Funds provided in 
this bill will secure these vital re-
sources while preserving water quan-
tity and quality, sustaining working 
landscapes and rural economies, in-
creasing access for recreation for all 
Americans no matter where they live, 
and fueling the juggernaut of our out-
door economy.’’ 
Indeed, the Great American Outdoors 
Act supports good-paying jobs and 
grows the economy. Nationally, out-
door recreation supports more than 5 
million jobs and adds nearly $780 bil-
lion to the economy. 
House Democrats are proud to pass 
this bill and send it on to the Presi-
dent’s desk. We hope to do so in the 
strongest possible bipartisan way, as it 
passed the United States Senate. 
As we do, we will continue our work 
to protect our environment and nat-
ural heritage by including calling on 
the Senate to take up H.R. 2, the Mov-
ing Forward Act, which rebuilds Amer-
ica’s infrastructure, while investing in 
a clean energy future, including by 
modernizing our energy infrastructure, 
boosting our commitment to renew-
ables, building a clean transportation 
sector, and more. 
Also we want to implement the Se-
lect Committee on Climate Crisis’ ac-
tion plan, Solving the Climate Crisis, 
the most sweeping and detailed climate 
plan in decades, which sets out a vision 
of 30 by 30, conserving at least 30 per-
cent of land and ocean in America by 
2030 to confront the threats of the cli-
mate crisis, which the Great American 
Outdoors Act advances. 
And urging the Senate to take up 
H.R. 9, the Climate Action Now Act, 
our strong response to the American 
people who are demanding climate ac-
tion by keeping us in the Paris Agree-
ment. 
That is not in this bill. We have a dif-
ferent bill here. We must invest in the 
future we want for our children. 
I just want to put this in a little per-
spective, Mr. Chairman and Mr. Rank-
ing Member. And thank you for your 
leadership in so many ways, Mr. 
BISHOP. 
When our country was founded and 
when Thomas Jefferson became Presi-
dent, he tasked Secretary of the Treas-
ury Gallatin to build the infrastructure 
of America, for an infrastructure plan 
that would follow the Lewis and Clark 
Expedition. It was Erie Canal, Cum-
berland Road, all kinds of things, and 
build into the Louisiana Purchase that 
would follow. It was a great under-
taking. Gallatin was the Secretary of 
the Treasury, and so many things hap-
pened at that time to build the infra-
structure into the manifest destiny of 
America and as we moved west. 
You wonder why I am bringing that 
up. 100 years later, at the anniversary 
of that initiative, President Teddy 
Roosevelt did his own infrastructure 
initiative called the National Park 
Service. It was to build and respect and 
conserve the green infrastructure of 
America. It was quite remarkable. So 
much sprang from that initiative of 
Teddy Roosevelt, the great conserva-
tionist. 
And now, over 200 years later, this is 
a tip of the hat to all of that. But so 
much more needs to be done. It is a 
recognition of the importance of the 
great outdoors, to the quality of life, 
but also the juggernaut of our outdoor 
economy. 
So, I hope we will have a strong bi-
partisan vote. I once again thank the 
distinguished chairman, Mr. GRIJALVA, 
for his leadership in all of this over the 
years and for this bill. And I, again, sa-
lute Mr. CUNNINGHAM of South Carolina 
for bringing his expertise as an ocean 
engineer to bear as the lead author of 
this important legislation, the Great 
American Outdoors Act. 
Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Speaker, 
the Dingell Act, 2 years ago, was bipar-
tisan. If this were bipartisan, we would 
not be here. 
But to illustrate that, I yield 3 min-
utes to the gentleman from Arizona 
(Mr. GOSAR). 
Mr. GOSAR. Mr. Speaker, today is a 
very swampy day, and I am not talking 
about the weather. Today, Congress 
will pass a bill that is, frankly, a dem-
onstration of everything that is wrong 
with Washington. 
The Great American Outdoors Act is 
a product of special interests, written 
not by committees, but in back rooms, 
full of special interest provisions, and 
now being forced through this Chamber 
without the opportunity for us to 
amend it. 
This is permanent legislation, yet we 
can’t take an extra hour in the House 
to consider amendments to make this 
legislation better? Why? Because the 
special interests that have paid nearly 
$100 million in lobbying can’t be denied 
another day from their victory. Well, I 
guess they got what they bought. 
Are we not allowed to amend this bill 
because House leadership is afraid to 
offend the Senate? We can decide that 
the Senate isn’t perfect, their product 
isn’t wonderful, that the House can 
make amendments to make it better. 
Let’s be clear. This bill is nearly 
nothing like the legislation introduced 
by the supporters in the House. 
The gentleman from South Carolina 
may think he has got a great win, but 
the repeal of the 100th meridian provi-
sion, which is in this bill, allows the 
U.S. Forest Service to steer millions of 
Federal spending away from his State. 
Like the Comptroller of the United 
States told us in December, left to 
their own devices, the U.S. Forest 
Service will spend 80 percent of their 
funding to the west of the meridian. 
And that was with Congressional over-
sight. Once passed and set on autopilot, 
this program will only get worse. 
If your goal was to expand rec-
reational opportunities to more Ameri-
cans, then you have failed miserably if 
you vote for this bill. 
But that is not the only problem with 
this legislation. I proposed a bipartisan 
amendment that would require the 
construction done under this act to ad-
here to Buy American provisions. 
It was endorsed by the United Steel-
workers, the AFL–CIO, American Iron 
and Steel Institute, and a broad coali-
tion of trade associations and unions. 
The underlying bill includes billions in 
new spending on infrastructure. Those 
billions could be spent on products 
manufactured by American workers. 
Can Congress consider this today? 
No. 
Why? Because the Speaker rejected 
the amendment, rejected American 
workers, and rejected American manu-
facturing. At a time when America 
needs jobs, a failure to include Buy 
American provisions in this bill is a 
shame on this House. 
I had amendments dealing with the 
infrastructure challenges facing our 
Native American reservations, includ-
ing funding for Indian education and 
Indian health. In areas where COVID–19 
was destructive, they need funds des-
perately to get back into the 21st cen-
tury from their current dilapidated 
state. 
Will Congress consider these amend-
ments? No, because the special inter-
ests behind this legislation don’t want 
us to consider those needs on the floor 
of the House. 
Considering this legislation sets the 
Federal Government on a massive land 
buying spree like never seen before, I 
prepared an amendment to protect our 
counties by ensuring full payment in 
the Payments in Lieu of Taxes pro-
gram. 
Do you remember that contract? Can 
we honor it? That won’t even be con-
sidered, as well as anything else. 
This legislation isn’t a victory for 
America; it is a loss. Good process 
builds good policy builds good politics. 
It is a shame that we didn’t go there. I 
ask everybody to vote against this leg-
islation. 
Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
1 minute to the gentlewoman from 
California (Ms. BARRAGA´ N) and thank 
her for her work on environmental jus-
tice legislation. 
Ms. BARRAGA´ N. Mr. Speaker, green 
spaces should be a right for everyone, 
regardless of where they live or the 
color of their skin.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H3653 
July 22, 2020 
Unfortunately, for too many Black, 
Brown, and Native American commu-
nities, parks are considered a privilege. 
Today, we can change this injustice. 
The Great American Outdoors Act 
will create more local parks in low-in-
come and urban neighborhoods. Minor-
ity communities across the country 
lack access to green spaces. 
In my district, in Compton, we only 
have about half an acre of parkland for 
every thousand residents, well below 
the averages in the rest of Los Angeles 
County and the Nation. 
Voting ‘‘yes’’ means more outdoor 
recreation 
opportunities, 
including 
sports fields and trails. Voting ‘‘yes’’ 
means all kids, no matter their ZIP 
Code, have the right to play on green 
grass and explore the natural world. 
I am proud to vote ‘‘yes’’ to secure 
this right for our young people today 
and for future generations. 
Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield 21⁄2
minutes to the gentleman 
from California (Mr. MCCLINTOCK), one 
of the ranking members on the com-
mittee, who has spent a lot of time on 
our committee and understands these 
issues. 
Mr. MCCLINTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I 
represent the Sierra Nevada of Cali-
fornia. Yosemite Valley, Sequoia and 
Kings Canyon, and Lake Tahoe are all 
within my district. 
The Yosemite Land Grant Act signed 
by President Lincoln in 1864 was the 
first time the Federal Government set 
aside land for ‘‘public use, resort, and 
recreation . . . for all time.’’ 
Today, the Federal estate has grown 
to 640 million acres. That is 28 percent 
of the land area of our Nation. While 
the Federal Government owns just 
seven-tenths of 1 percent of New York 
State and 1.8 percent of Texas, it owns 
46 percent of my home State of Cali-
fornia and 93 percent of Alpine County 
in my district. 
Now, we in the Sierra revere our pub-
lic lands, and we are proud to share 
them with the world. But the Federal 
Government now holds far more land 
than it can take care of. The Federal 
lands now face a $20 billion backlog of 
deferred maintenance, which makes 
tourism less desirable. 
Now, this is all land that is off the 
local tax rolls, denying our local gov-
ernments vital revenues. Federal re-
strictions on productive use of these 
lands has devastated local economies 
and, worst of all, the Federal Govern-
ment has utterly neglected the man-
agement of our forests to the point 
that they have become morbidly over-
grown and now present a constant 
threat of catastrophic fire. 
Now, shouldn’t we take care of the 
land we already hold before we acquire 
still more land? And when we have al-
ready taken two-thirds of Alaska and 
Utah 
and 
four-fifths 
of 
Nevada, 
shouldn’t we pause and ask for some 
balance around the country? 
Now, 
this 
measure 
does 
provide 
enough money over the next 5 years to 
address about half of our current de-
ferred maintenance needs, and that is 
very good. But then that funding dis-
appears, and we are left with locked-in, 
billion-dollar-a-year mandatory spend-
ing in perpetuity for new land acquisi-
tions placed outside of Congress’ con-
trol, while removing the requirement 
that future acquisitions be focused 
where the Federal Government owns 
very little land. 
It means that unelected bureaucrats 
will have a billion-dollar-a-year slush 
fund to take private property off the 
tax rolls with no accountability to our 
local communities, no provisions for 
long-term maintenance, and no reforms 
to protect our people from the scourge 
of wildfire produced by the continuing 
neglect of our Federal forests. 
Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
1 minute to the gentleman from Cali-
fornia (Mr. PANETTA). 
Mr. PANETTA. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today in support of the Great American 
Outdoors Act. 
In my district on the central coast of 
California, we protect, we promote, and 
we never put a price on our environ-
ment. Partly because it is what drives 
our local economy, but also we appre-
ciate what it means for those after us. 
By fully funding the Land and Water 
Conservation Fund, this bill ensures 
the type of necessary care needed for 
our National Parks, forests, and crit-
ical wildlife areas. This is needed 
today, because those treasures have 
been put under extreme pressure with 
this pandemic, but also previously with 
increased visitors and decreased budg-
ets. 
That is why this legislation is so im-
portant, as it will not only address 
needed infrastructure projects and de-
ferred maintenance, but also because it 
will promote conservation, recreation, 
and access to the outdoors. 
By passing this bipartisan bill that 
ensures investments in our parks and 
forests, we are ensuring that our nat-
ural treasures, our postcards to the fu-
ture, actually get delivered to future 
generations. 
Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Speaker, I 
reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
1 minute to the gentleman from Utah 
(Mr. MCADAMS). 
b 1345 
Mr. 
MCADAMS. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
Utah is blessed with many treasured 
national areas, from parks and trails to 
red rock canyons. Conserving these 
places is more important than ever, 
and today, we take landmark action by 
passing full funding for the Land and 
Water Conservation Fund. This suc-
cessful conservation program has given 
us, at no cost to the taxpayer, decades 
of vital funding for national and State 
parks, 
wildlife 
refuges, 
and 
rec-
reational areas. 
State and local officials rely on the 
money to improve local parks and 
trails, which see increased demand 
along the rapidly growing Wasatch 
Front. Utah has five of the country’s 
most beloved national parks, including 
Zion National Park, which has quite 
literally been loved to death and has a 
$67 million backlog in deferred mainte-
nance. This bill provides some des-
perately needed funding to fill that 
backlog. 
Mr. Speaker, I am proud today to be 
voting for this legislation and the 
promise it holds for our economy and 
an excellent quality of life in Utah for 
my children and for future generations. 
Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Mr. Speaker, I won’t tell the gen-
tleman from Utah that the Utah Asso-
ciation of Counties is opposed to this 
and all the trails that he is talking 
about come from the State’s side of 
projects. That is beside the point. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 11⁄2 minutes to 
the gentleman from California (Mr. 
LAMALFA). 
Mr. LAMALFA. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the ranking member and colleague 
from Utah. I appreciate his service and 
his force with which he does things 
here. 
Mr. Speaker, all right, where are we? 
Gigantic deficits, yet we want to add to 
the burden of that deficit with a forced 
$900 million, nearly $1 billion, every 
year in this bill for acquiring new Fed-
eral land. 
Now, I come from the West, so we are 
already 
ravaged 
by 
wildfire, 
by 
unmanaged lands that are detrimental 
to the neighbors, to the private lands. 
I have three fires going on in my dis-
trict right now. A lot of this emanates 
from unmanaged Forest Service lands. 
So, we want to add to their inability to 
manage even more lands in this legisla-
tion. 
Now, the part of the bill that Mr. 
BISHOP had authored is a good part, 
taking care of the backlog that we 
have in our parks and our lands, if you 
would listen to him, $20 billion worth 
of backlog that we haven’t found a way 
to pay for yet. Yet, instead of finishing 
our dinner, we are already going for 
the dessert by buying more lands that 
we can’t afford and we know we can’t 
manage. 
I will be thinking about this, and my 
constituents will, as more and more 
forest lands burn each year and threat-
en communities. These forests are 
gated off because they don’t have time 
to do the maintenance and the work 
that needs to be done so the public can 
have access to these lands because of 
the $20 billion backlog or the funding 
to take care of the juniper problem 
that we have in northeast California, 
the wild horse population that needs to 
be managed so they don’t die out there 
of starvation during the draught, the 
sage grouse habitat so they don’t be-

to secure rural schools funds that our 
rural counties need. 
Mr. Speaker, I say ‘‘no’’ on this bill 
and get back to managing what we 
should manage. 
Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Speaker, I am 
prepared to close when the gentleman 
from Utah is done with his speakers. 
Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
We have talked about several of the 
problems with this particular bill. With 
this particular bill, we have talked 
about how the poor reckoning of its 
sources there do not say what is going 
to happen if this money does not de-
velop. I think Mr. GRAVES would be 
good to talk about where this money is 
coming and how it is being used at the 
same time. And we don’t necessarily 
know what will happen with the low-
ering of the royalties that we are expe-
riencing this year from next year. 
There is one other consideration I 
hope that people will understand, espe-
cially for all those who are speaking 
about it who come from the eastern 
coast. There was a conforming amend-
ment put in the Senate in this par-
ticular bill, a conforming amendment. 
In the good old days, we used to call 
them earmarks, but it is a conforming 
amendment. 
The original bill said that on Forest 
Service land that would be bought, 15 
percent of that had to come from west 
of the 100th meridian and 85 percent 
had to come from east of the 100th me-
ridian. That was taken out, quietly and 
surely taken out. The end result of 
that means that there is a siphoning of 
billions of dollars that should be and 
could be going to Eastern States. 
I mention that because one of the 
Democrat speakers did speak about the 
need for urban recreation opportuni-
ties. That was what was supposed to 
happen, 
and 
with this conforming 
amendment, that is what is taken out 
of the bill. 
In the 1960s, as this bill was being 
discussed, Orville Freeman was the 
Secretary of Agriculture for Kennedy. 
He said at that time that the Outdoor 
Recreation Resources Review Commis-
sion pointed out that the greatest need 
for recreation opportunities lies in the 
areas adjacent to the metropolitan cen-
ters in the Eastern States. 
It would be our purpose under this 
bill to expand about 84 percent of what 
would be available under it for acquisi-
tion in the eastern national forest ac-
quired under the Weeks Act. 
In fact, that commission went on to 
say that outdoor opportunities are 
most urgently needed near metropoli-
tan areas. Much of the West and vir-
tually all of Alaska are of little use to 
most Americans looking for a place in 
the Sun for their families on a weekend 
when the demand is overwhelming. 
At regional and State levels, most of 
the land is where people are not. One- 
sixth is in the sparsely populated Alas-
ka. Seventy-two percent of the remain-
der is in the West, where only 15 per-
cent of the people live. The Northeast, 
where one-quarter of the people live, 
only 4 percent of the acreage is there. 
But that language was not put in 
there by happenstance. There was a 
reason for it. In one iteration of this 
particular act that we introduced a 
long time ago, there was the idea of 
putting a specific percentage that 
would go to urban recreation so there 
would be those urban recreation con-
cepts, as was originally designed in the 
bill. That has been taken out. 
What that will mean is that for you 
who live east of the 100th meridian, ba-
sically east of Denver, there will be 
$1.19 billion less dedicated to you than 
there would have been if this amend-
ment had not been put in there. That 
works out to an average of $32 million 
per congressional district of those liv-
ing east of Denver. 
I am glad that all those who are for 
this, on whatever side, will have a good 
time to explain to their constituents 
why they are in favor of giving their 
area $32 million less in recreation op-
portunity simply because you are going 
to confirm a conforming amendment 
that was slipped into the Senate 
version of this bill that really hurts 
this process and is not necessarily posi-
tive. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
1 minute to the gentleman from Wash-
ington (Mr. KILMER). 
Mr. KILMER. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the chairman and all who worked on 
this bill. 
Mr. Speaker, as someone who grew 
up on the Olympic Peninsula, I learned 
how important protecting our parks 
and our public lands is to driving tour-
ism and growing jobs and supporting 
rural economies. 
This is a big day. Permanently fund-
ing the Land and Water Conservation 
Fund, providing dedicated funding to 
make much-needed repairs at Olympic 
National Park and throughout our 
park system, this is progress for ensur-
ing that these natural assets can con-
tinue to provide amazing visitor expe-
riences and serve as economic drivers 
for rural communities that need these 
jobs and need these opportunities for 
future generations. 
This is a day to also celebrate the ex-
traordinary coalition of environmental 
groups, outdoor economy groups, and 
local civic leaders that got involved to 
move this bill forward today. 
I am grateful for all who worked on 
this. I am proud to be a supporter of 
this bill, and I am encouraging all of 
my colleagues to vote ‘‘yes’’ today. 
Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from 
Louisiana (Mr. GRAVES). 
Mr. 
GRAVES 
of 
Louisiana. 
Mr. 
Speaker, I want to introduce another 
dose of reality, something you have not 
heard many folks talk about today. 
Where is this money coming from? 
How are we paying for this initially— 
what is it?—$1.9 or $2.9 billion a year in 
mandatory spending? 
This is coming from offshore energy 
revenues. That is where the majority of 
these moneys are coming from, from 
oil and gas production. I want to be 
clear: from oil and gas production. 
Now, the majority at the same time 
and in the same breath is taking step 
after step to decimate or eliminate the 
domestic energy industry, therefore 
not making us get oil and gas from the 
United States but getting it from 
places like Russia, as we have seen 
over and over again when these drastic 
policies have been put forth. 
Now, Mr. Speaker, the other thing is, 
any time you have energy revenues 
like this produced on Federal land 
under the Mineral Leasing Act, 50 per-
cent of the money goes to those States 
that host that production, and they 
can use it for whatever they want. 
They can use it for whatever they want 
to use it for. 
In this case, the Gulf States, Lou-
isiana, Mississippi, Alabama, Texas, we 
get about 4 percent right now. 
So, Mr. Speaker, I have a question. I 
have a question for my friends on the 
majority. Can they tell me what they 
are going to say to the residents of 
Texas, 
Louisiana, 
Mississippi, 
Ala-
bama, and Florida next time we have a 
huge hurricane come through because 
you have refused, under the bipartisan 
amendment that the Congressional 
Black Caucus and others advocated, 
you have refused to allow for a larger 
percentage of money to be invested 
back in the resilience of this eco-
system, the resilience of these commu-
nities? 
Tell me what you are going to say to 
them whenever we have another Hurri-
cane Katrina, Rita, Gustav, Ike, Har-
vey, Irma, Maria, Michael, Florence. 
Tell me what you are going to say to 
them because you are taking their 
money, and you are spending it in 
other places, and you are saying this is 
for the environment, these environ-
mental groups out there advocating for 
this, when it is a greater environ-
mental investment to make it in the 
Gulf. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge opposition to the 
bill. 
Mr. Speaker, I include in the RECORD 
statements from the U.S. Farm Bureau 
Association and the Cattlemen’s Asso-
ciation in opposition to this, from the 
American Energy Alliance in opposi-
tion to this, as well as the CRS report 
that analyzes from whence this money 
comes, whence it is going, and how 
much we probably won’t have in the fu-
ture.

DEAR SENATORS: We the undersigned west-

provide in addressing the extensive mainte-
nance backlog for federally-managed lands, 
we also write to express our collective con-
cerns with funding further expansion of fed-
eral land ownership in the west. 
Farm Bureau members are significantly 
and directly impacted by federal land owner-
ship, 
land-use 
policies 
and 
decisions. 
Throughout the West, our members hold 
public lands grazing permits, own property 
adjacent to federal lands and engage in pub-
lic and private land forestry. For many 
ranchers, access to public lands grazing is 
economically and ecologically essential to 
their operation and provides access to land 
that may not otherwise be available to new 
or beginning farmers and ranchers. 
Legislation or regulation that could be 
used to curtail viable multiple use access to 
these public resources is a threat to Amer-
ica’s farming and ranching families. Histor-
ical experience illustrates, in many cases, 
that expansion of public land ownership over 
time leads to new policies that further limit 
multiple uses of land such as livestock graz-
ing or create additional restrictions on ac-
cess and rangeland improvements. Further, 
additional federal land acquisition does not 
adequately consider the reduction in eco-
nomic activity and the loss of jobs in re-
source-dependent communities. For these 
reasons, Farm Bureau believes that it is es-
sential for agricultural stakeholders to be 
represented on any sort of planning and/or 
advisory committees formed for federal land 
expansion especially in those areas where 
private or state land is proposed for purchase 
or exchange. 
American farmers and ranchers have al-
ways demonstrated their fortitude and resil-
ience in adapting to the ever-changing land-
scape—both political and ecological. While 
the resources made available through feder-
ally managed lands provide opportunities for 
ranchers to add value to their businesses, 
availability of private land is essential for 
successful business and commerce. The fed-
eral government already owns over 640 mil-
lion acres, which is approximately 28% of the 
2.27 billion acres of land in the U.S. 
Since enactment of the LWCF in 1965, Con-
gress has appropriated $18.9 billion (not ad-
justed for inflation), of which $11.4 billion 
was for federal land acquisition. Over 5 mil-
lion acres of private land has been purchased 
by USDA and DOI agencies. 
The Federal government already owns 
more land than it can effectively maintain 
and manage. In the west, the federal govern-
ment owns roughly every other acre of land 
and many counties have more than 75% of 
their land in federal ownership. Further fed-
eral and ownership erodes the available tax- 
base and limits the ability of local govern-
ments to effectively provide critical govern-
ment services. 
The second title of the GAOA establishes 
the Land and Water Conservation Fund as a 
trust fund with permanent authorization and 
without annual appropriations oversight. 
The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) esti-
mates the price tag for the first year of this 
legislation could be upwards of $20 billion. In 
this midst of the current pandemic and re-
lated economic crisis, we are concerned with 
the additional financial burden this legisla-
tion would create. 
We believe, at this time, that funds allo-
cated by the Land and Water Conservation 
Act (LWCA) would be better utilized to man-
age existing federal lands and request Con-
gress amend the GAOA to allow for LWCA 
funds to instead be allocated to individual 
state foresters for their use in fire suppres-
sion, fire management and conservation ef-
forts instead of utilizing funds to acquire ad-
ditional private property. We request that 
you consider the following amendment re-
quests: 
1. Sunset in five years. This would allow 
the Congress to evaluate the program and 
decide whether to reauthorize, modify, or 
eliminate it. A five-year sunset would con-
form the LWCF title of the bill with the $49.5 
billion maintenance title. 
2. Limit land acquisition to states with 
less than the collective average of those 
western states with federal owned/adminis-
tered lands. 
3. Require that all federal and acquisitions 
be subject to approval of the relevant state 
legislature, Governor, and county commis-
sions. 
4. Require notice of any potential land ac-
quisition be given at least 90 days before 
title can be transferred to the state legisla-
ture, Governor, and county commissioners. 
Notice should include the annual loss of 
property tax revenues that will result; or if 
the land is already held by a tax-exempt 
owner, such as a land trust, the notice 
should include the tax revenues lost if the 
property were subject to property taxes. 
5. Require that priority be given to the 
maintenance backlog, forgoing any acquisi-
tion requests in those instances when reve-
nues are limited. 
Additionally, our organizations would wel-
come the opportunity for inclusion of addi-
tional 
maintenance 
and 
enhancement 
projects that would benefit critical natural 
resources to the West. We ask that you con-
sider including the provisions of S. 2044, the 
Water Supply Infrastructure Rehabilitation 
and Utilization Act. This amendment would 
create an aging infrastructure account with-
in the Bureau of Reclamation (BOR) to pro-
vide loans to local water managers to per-
form extraordinary maintenance on the fed-
eral BOR infrastructure they manage. Ini-
tially, $40 million per year over five years ($2 
billion total) would be provided to this ac-
count from the Reclamation Fund. No tax-
payer funds would be used to fund the ac-
count and water users would be required to 
repay the loans received to repair and re-
place water facilities with interest. The re-
paid funds would be available to BOR to fund 
additional 
extraordinary 
maintenance 
projects, essentially creating a revolving 
fund. 
The GAOA provides deferred maintenance 
for every federal asset agency within the De-
partment of Interior except BOR. Yet, BOR 
is facing significant issues with deferred and 
maintenance needs at federal water supply 
facilities. 80% of BOR’s facilities are more 
than 50 years old and are in need of major 
upgrades or replacement costs beyond reg-
ular maintenance. Since water managers do 
not own the infrastructure, they are unable 
to bond against it and therefore have limited 
access to other sources of capital for major 
repair projects. Creating this account within 
BOR would allow water managers to perform 
repairs, repay cost over time and ultimately 
ensure that our aging federal water infra-
structure remains viable to serve the billions 
of dollars of agricultural and other economic 
activity that depends on it. 
Our organizations are happy to further dis-
cuss the GAOA, our recommendations and 
the opportunity for inclusion of additional 
maintenance projects. We thank you in ad-
vance for your consideration and look for-
ward to continuing this important conversa-
tion.

KEY VOTE NO ON H.R. 1957 
The American Energy Alliance urges all 
members to vote NO on H.R. 1957 as amended 
by the Senate with the text of the Great 
American Outdoors Act. The federal govern-
ment already owns far more land than it can 
adequately manage, which is part of the rea-
son for the large maintenance backlog this 
bill tries to address. However, the Land and 
Water Conservation Fund is simply a vehicle 
for buying up even more land for the federal 
government to mismanage. 
By buying up land, the federal government 
hems in and impoverishes local rural com-
munities by removing taxable land and lim-
iting space for economic activity. Land pro-
cured through the LWCF that is later placed 
off limits to development further harms the 
local communities as well as harming the 
larger economy. While the LWCF itself is 
questionable policy, at least the current 
structure of the fund allows for congres-
sional input into the land acquisition process 
through appropriations. Making LWCF fund-
ing permanent removes this last Congres-
sional check on federal land acquisition. Per-
manent funding of the LWCF should be op-
posed. 
The AEA urges all members to support free 
markets and affordable energy by voting NO 
on H.R. 1957 as amended with the Great 
American Outdoors Act. AEA will include 
this vote in its American Energy Score-
card.—Thomas Pyle, President, American 
Energy Alliance. 
[From CRS Reports & Analysis] 
EFFECT OF COVID–19 ON FEDERAL LAND 
REVENUES, JULY 13, 2020 (R46448) 
EFFECT OF COVID–19 ON ENERGY AND MINERAL 
OPERATIONS AND RECEIPTS 
The COVID–19 pandemic and accompanying 
recession have significantly affected energy 
and mineral prices, production, and con-
sumption. Many observers expect energy 
consumption will remain below 2019 levels 
through at least 2021 . . . These expectations 
stem from reported and ongoing reduced de-
mand for liquid fuels for the transportation 
sector and reduced demand for coal and nat-
ural gas associated with the reduced demand 
for electricity and industrial activity. 
Royalties are the largest contributor to 
federal energy and mineral revenues. Roy-
alty rates are set by statute, regulation, or 
for specific leases, but the rates are rarely 
altered once a lease has been issued. The rev-
enues from royalties reflect the product of 
the royalty rate and the market value of the 
commodity produced. The pandemic and ac-
companying recession have resulted in re-
duced demand for oil, gas, and coal, which 
has resulted in lower prices and lower pro-
duction for these commodities in recent 
months, relative to 2019. 
For May 2020, ONRR reported onshore oil 
and gas royalty collections of $170 million, a 
decline of 53% from May 2019. ONRR reported 
offshore oil and gas royalty collections of 
$100 million, a decline of 84% from royalty 
collections for the same month in 2019. The 
royalty collections for May reflect produc-
tion and sales in April. ONRR reports new 
monthly data on an ongoing basis. 
To the extent that royalties and other rev-
enues are reduced due to impacts from the 
COVID–19 pandemic and recession, disburse-
ments to states and some federal programs 
would decline accordingly. The severity of 
these impacts on program funding and state 
budgets depends on the portion of total rev-
enue coming from energy and mineral dis-
bursements and on other factors. Some pro-
grams (e.g., the LWCF) receive disburse-
ments up to a specified limit; in such cases,

royalties could fall but remain sufficient to 
fund such programs. Reductions in energy 
and mineral revenues also could affect the 
funds remaining in the U.S. Treasury as mis-
cellaneous receipts. 
Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Speaker, 
may I inquire how much time I actu-
ally have left here. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from Utah has 31⁄2 minutes re-
maining. 
Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield myself the balance of my time. 
We have heard all sorts of platitudes 
about this bill today. Whether it passes 
or not is actually irrelevant. It is not 
bipartisan, and it has all sorts of flaws. 
There are questions about the future 
source of funding. 
We have heard speaker after speaker 
come up and say: We are not talking 
about taxpayers’ money. This is only 
royalties that are off there. 
One of the problems we have to face 
is that all the royalties that come from 
offshore development and onshore de-
velopment from energy and gas, those 
royalties are placed in the general 
fund. In fact, the second largest source 
of funds that go into the general fund 
is from these royalties, second only to 
the IRS taxes that go in there. If these 
revenues weren’t deposited in LWCF, 
they would be deposited in the general 
fund of the U.S. Treasury. If that is not 
taxpayer money, I don’t know what is. 
We have talked about the need for, 
actually, urban recreation areas. We 
would like to do it, but unfortunately, 
this bill diminishes that opportunity 
and puts it in limbo, which is not good. 
I have heard speaker after speaker 
come up here with pretty pictures 
about our national parks, reservation 
lands, BLM land, resource lands, all 
these things that need to be helped. A 
lot of them talked about all the won-
derful programs that are on State 
lands, that are parks, roads, picnic 
areas, and all those things which we 
are already doing. 
When we permanently reauthorized 
the LWCF last Congress, that is when 
we put more money into those types of 
things everyone says is wonderful. 
b 1400 
What we didn’t put more money into 
is buying Federal land, buying more 
land to put into the Federal estate. As 
everyone talks about how important it 
is actually to now start putting money 
into park maintenance, into mainte-
nance of the backlog, what this bill 
does is put that at the very lowest rung 
on priorities of where this royalty 
money is spent. 
You will spend it first on GOMESA. 
You will send it to the States. It will 
go to historic preservation. You will 
spend it on buying up more land before 
you ever come to anything that helps 
the parks and helps the public lands. 
That is because we have disproportion-
ately done this. 
This bill is not about funding our 
public lands. This bill is about circum-
venting the limitations that we put in 
in the last Congress on buying more 
land. The only thing this bill is about 
is how we can find another way to buy 
more property. 
We can’t even afford the property we 
already have. There is a $20 billion 
maintenance backlog. But what this is 
attempting to do is find a way to put 
more money into buying more land so 
we can exacerbate that problem. 
Now, you can say all you want to 
about how wonderful it is, how good it 
is, and, I am sorry, most of those plati-
tudes were misstated. They were talk-
ing about things that either already 
exist or are actually being de-empha-
sized by this particular bill. 
What this bill is about is: Are you 
going to put more money into buying 
more land before you put more money 
into actually maintaining the land we 
already have? That is really the only 
issue of this bill, and that is why we 
are fighting this strongly about it. 
Last year, when we did the Dingell 
Act, that was bipartisan. We had 
worked together to come up with a lot 
of bipartisan stuff. This was not a bi-
partisan bill. Mr. KILMER, I appreciated 
his work with me on the parks. That 
was bipartisan. This is not bipartisan. 
It is still about how do we buy more 
land. That is the goal of this piece of 
legislation. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge a ‘‘no’’ vote, and 
I yield back the balance of my time. 
Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Speaker, how 
much time remains? 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from Arizona has 71⁄4 minutes 
remaining. 
Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself the balance of my time. 
Mr. Speaker, the process of this legis-
lation reaching this point on the floor 
to be voted upon has, to those of us in-
volved, been difficult. It has been frus-
trating. Yet, the possibility of it being 
done was always there, and that was 
the goal. I think the overwhelming 
support in the Senate for a clean bill to 
come to the House was bipartisan. 
I think today would have been—I 
didn’t feel it was necessary to engage 
in the same arguments that we have 
been engaging about with the Land and 
Water Conservation Fund in particular 
and the backlog. This legislation is not 
about robbing Peter to pay Paul. It is 
not about taking money from the East 
to give to the West. It is not about de-
nying coastal States their share. 
If we do transition, as we transition, 
which we need to urgently, to clean en-
ergy in the future, future Congresses, I 
think, will have the foresight to look 
at this legislation and deal with how 
we move forward with it and continue 
to fund it. 
When I went to visit Land and Water 
Conservation Fund sites, I went to a 
park in south Phoenix, the only green 
space and recreation area for close to 
8,000 families who live in that general 
area, Land and Water Conservation 
Fund; and when I went to other loca-
tions in urban areas across this coun-
try, Land and Water Conservation 
Fund. 
That continues to be a priority for 
reasons of public health, equity, and 
access. 
Mr. Speaker, in a strange procedural 
trick of the House, we have spent this 
afternoon debating the Great American 
Outdoors Act, but the bill we refer to 
as H.R. 1957 began as something else. 
H.R. 1957 was originally a bill to pro-
tect taxpayers by ensuring fair treat-
ment under the law. It was introduced 
back in March 2019 by our late friend 
and colleague, Representative John 
Lewis. 
Now, I can’t personally speak to Rep-
resentative Lewis’ thoughts on con-
servation spending. But I do believe 
our late friend would be happy with the 
work that we have done here today and 
the vote that we are about to take. 
Representative Lewis truly believed 
in a government by and for the people, 
all the people. He challenged us to 
leave petty partisanship at the door 
and to consider the essential pursuit of 
justice and equity that we have long 
sought and failed to meet in this coun-
try. 
I am proud to have called Represent-
ative Lewis my friend. I am proud that 
we can honor his legacy with the pas-
sage of this bill. 
There is much work left to be done to 
ensure real equity and justice in the 
United States, and I look forward to 
working with all my colleagues across 
the aisle in continuing that work in 
the future. 
But when we come together as we 
have today, as the people’s representa-
tives working toward the common goal 
of protecting future generations, then 
perhaps there is hope we might see 
Representative Lewis’ vision realized. 
I thank all of my colleagues who 
spoke on behalf of this legislation. I 
thank leadership for bringing it to the 
floor and all the members of the com-
mittee and Members not on the com-
mittee who worked very hard to bring 
this legislation forward. It is historic. 
It is important. It is necessary. And it 
is an essential step. I urge us to vote 
‘‘yes’’ on H.R. 1957. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
Mr. CICILLINE. Mr. Speaker, I rise to ex-
press my support for the Senate amendment 
to H.R. 1957, the Great American Outdoors 
Act. This legislation will establish permanent 
funding for the Land and Water Conservation 
Fund and establish a National Parks and Pub-
lic Land Legacy Restoration Fund supporting 
deferred maintenance projects on federal 
lands. The funding authorized by this legisla-
tion will assist many states, including my 
home state of Rhode Island, in improving state 
parks and beaches, and preserving open 
spaces and wildlife habitats. Additionally, fund-
ing for deferred maintenance projects within 
the National Park System will help ensure that 
resources remain available to Rhode Island in 
the future for required improvements and de-
velopments for sites like the Roger Williams 
National Memorial and the Blackstone Valley 
National Historic Park. 
While I support this legislation, I am hopeful 
that the Natural Resources Committee, as well

as the House Appropriations Committee, will 
work to improve funding outcomes for coastal 
states under the Land and Water Conserva-
tion Fund. Per-capita, coastal states receive 
approximately forty cents on the dollar com-
pared to funding received by inland states. 
Rhode Island’s coastal economy generates 
more than $2 billion annually, and supports 
more than 41,000 jobs, while New England as 
a whole supports nearly a quarter of a million 
jobs through its coastal economy. As a result 
of geography, coastal states face a number of 
challenges which many inland states do not 
face, including beach erosion, migrating fish 
stocks which impact commercial fisheries, and 
vulnerability to tropical storms and other 
weather-related disasters. All of these chal-
lenges are further exacerbated by the effects 
of climate change. 
Congress needs to be able to support crit-
ical programs like the Land and Water Con-
servation Fund and also ensure that coastal 
communities are able to receive necessary 
funds to preserve their coastlines, protect wild-
life, and support workers who rely on jobs 
supported by ocean economies. I look forward 
to working with Chairman GRIJALVA to discuss 
ways in which we may be able to achieve this 
going forward. 
Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, I strongly sup-
port the bipartisan Great American Outdoors 
Act, which, among other things, would address 
the National Park Service’s (NPS) deferred 
maintenance backlog, a problem that dis-
proportionately affects the National Capital Re-
gion and, especially, the District of Columbia. 
Twenty percent of the District consists of park-
land, almost 90 percent of which is under the 
jurisdiction of NPS. 
National parks are some of America’s great-
est treasures, yet NPS, the agency that main-
tains our federal parks, has a $12 billion main-
tenance backlog. One-sixth of all projects in 
the backlog are in the National Capital Region, 
with $1.3 billion in D.C. itself. The National 
Mall and Memorial Parks have the highest 
number of deferred maintenance projects in 
the nation, with more than $840 million in 
needed repairs still outstanding, according to 
Pew Charitable Trusts. The most significant 
deferred maintenance projects involve refur-
bishing memorials and making necessary re-
pairs for supporting infrastructure. Although 
these parks are located in D.C., they are of 
national significance. The National Mall and 
Memorial Parks accommodate more than 36 
million visits each year and roughly 30,000 
people use their 15 softball fields, eight 
volleyball courts, two rugby fields and the 
Washington Monument grounds for sporting 
events nearly year-round. This heavy use has 
caused a $13 million repair backlog for the 
Mall grounds. 
In addition to the National Mall and Memo-
rial Parks, NPS owns most of D.C.’s neighbor-
hood parks, including 156 small green spaces 
and many circles, squares and fountains 
throughout D.C. Also included in the backlog 
are historic sites such as Ford’s Theatre, the 
FDR Memorial, East and West Potomac 
Parks, the Carter Barron Amphitheatre and the 
Belmont-Paul 
Women’s 
Equality 
National 
Monument. I support passage of the Great 
American Outdoors Act so that NPS can prop-
erly maintain all of our incredible national 
parks. 
Mr. YOUNG. Mr. Speaker, I rise to support 
Senate Amendment to H.R. 1957. The Great 
American Outdoors Act is landmark legislation 
that will clear the maintenance backlog at our 
National Parks, protect our country’s eco-
systems, and permanently fund the Land and 
Water Conservation Fund (LWCF). The per-
manent funding of the LWCF has been one of 
my longtime goals. When I was Chairman of 
the Natural Resources Committee, I intro-
duced the Conservation and Reinvestment Act 
(CARA) with my dear friend, the late Chairman 
John Dingell by my side. Today marks the cul-
mination of our work, and I am proud to have 
accomplished this with the help of John’s wife, 
Congresswoman DEBBIE DINGELL. My enthu-
siasm for permanent LWCF funding is as 
strong now as it was then. In recognition of 
this day, Mr. Speaker, I include in the RECORD 
the following op-ed that I authored in the Fair-
banks Daily News-Miner on July 4, 2000 in 
support of CARA. 
[From the Fairbanks (Alaska) Daily News- 
Miner, July 4, 2000] 
LEGISLATION BESTOWS LASTING ALASKA 
RETURNS 
(By Don Young) 
There’s been a lot of interesting specula-
tion about my legislation called the Con-
servation and Reinvestment Act. Numerous 
stories and editorials have been written 
about what this landmark bill would do and 
why I led the effort to pass such a major con-
servation package. 
Even News-Miner columnist Fred Pratt has 
devoted a significant amount of attention to 
CARA and my participation in this process. 
In his most recent column, he speculated 
that I wrote the bill to benefit Alaska Native 
corporations. This was a new and novel the-
ory, but unfortunately, not accurate. 
The truth is actually very simple—CARA 
is good for all Alaskans. 
In Alaska and throughout the nation, 
CARA will increase funding for federal and 
state conservation and recreation programs, 
urban parks, historic preservation, and wild-
life conservation. The bill also resolves a 
major inequity regarding the disposition of 
funds generated from Outer Continental 
Shelf activities. 
Currently, states receive 50 percent of the 
revenues for onshore oil production but 
nothing from the federal waters six miles 
and beyond a state’s coast. CARA corrects 
this problem by creating new programs that 
benefit coastal states with the OCS revenues, 
which have averaged between $4 to $5 billion 
annually. Under CARA, $2.8 billion of this 
funding will go toward important recreation, 
wildlife and conservation programs each 
year. 
In addition, CARA creates new private 
property protections which go beyond exist-
ing law. 
Alaska will receive about $2.5 billion dur-
ing the 15-year period included in CARA for 
these programs. Each year, Alaska would re-
ceive: $87 million for coastal conservation 
programs; $38.5 million for state and federal 
land conservation under the Land and Water 
Conservation Fund; $17.5 million for wildlife 
conservation; $9.8 million in PILT payments; 
$9 million for federal and Native land res-
toration; and about $1.5 million for historic 
preservation and endangered species pro-
grams. 
In previous years, the LWCF has helped 
fund several popular Alaska projects includ-
ing Alaskaland in Fairbanks, the Coastal 
Trail in Anchorage and Eagle Crest in Ju-
neau. The increased funding for the state 
programs under the LWCF will allow for 
local communities to determine how these 
funds are spent in their own communities 
based upon their local priorities, rather than 
federal dictates. 
Despite inaccurate claims by fringe groups 
like the American Land Rights Association, 
CARA also includes new private property 
protections that go beyond existing law. No 
new federal land can be acquired under 
CARA without the specific approval of Con-
gress. The federal government can only pur-
chase land from willing sellers—condemna-
tion is not allowed under CARA unless it is 
specifically approved by Congress. CARA 
also created new requirements to protect 
land owners who do not want to sell their 
land from new regulations. 
Additionally, 
the 
administration 
must 
seek to use land exchanges and conservation 
easements as alternatives to acquisition. 
These new protections were included to en-
hance private property rights in all 50 states. 
Despite the noisy opposition by some 
fringe groups, CARA is supported by thou-
sands of organizations and officials through-
out the nation. Last month, CARA was over-
whelmingly approved by the U.S. House by a 
315 to 102 vote with a majority of both Re-
publicans and Democrats voting for passage 
of the bill. CARA is supported by all 50 gov-
ernors, the U.S. Conference of Mayors and 
the National Association of Counties. CARA 
has also been endorsed by more than 4,500 or-
ganizations including numerous conserva-
tion, hunting, fishing, and recreation groups 
like the National Rifle Association, and 
other organizations like the U.S. Chamber of 
Commerce and the National Association of 
Realtors. 
Alaskans know that over the past 27 years, 
I have lead the effort for the authorization of 
the trans-Alaska pipeline, oil development in 
Prudhoe Bay and the Coastal Plain, a strong 
mining industry, and numerous other eco-
nomic programs in every region of the state. 
During this same period, I have also au-
thored numerous important conservation 
bills including the reauthorization of the 
Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation Act 
and a comprehensive improvement of Amer-
ica’s national wildlife refuge system. 
In addition, I have authored and supported 
dozens of bills to promote hunting, fishing 
and outdoor recreation in our state and the 
entire nation. 
Fred Pratt is correct. CARA and its ex-
panded conservation, wildlife and recreation 
programs is consistent with my 27-year con-
gressional record of working for Alaskans. 
Don Young has served as Alaska’s sole rep-
resentative in Congress since 1973.

REPLACING 
BUST 
OF 
ROGER 
BROOKE TANEY WITH BUST OF 
THURGOOD MARSHALL 
Mr. BUTTERFIELD. Mr. Speaker, I 
move to suspend the rules and pass the 
bill (H.R. 7573) to direct the Architect 
of the Capitol to replace the bust of 
Roger Brooke Taney in the Old Su-
preme Court Chamber of the United 
States Capitol with a bust of Thurgood 
Marshall to be obtained by the Joint 
Committee on the Library and to re-
move certain statues from areas of the 
United States Capitol which are acces-
sible to the public, to remove all stat-
ues of individuals who voluntarily 
served the Confederate States of Amer-
ica from display in the United States 
Capitol, and for other purposes, as 
amended. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 7573 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. REPLACEMENT OF BUST OF ROGER 
BROOKE 
TANEY 
WITH 
BUST 
OF 
THURGOOD MARSHALL. 
(a) 
FINDINGS.—Congress 
finds 
the 
fol-
lowing: 
(1) While sitting in the United States Cap-
itol, the Supreme Court issued the infamous 
Dred Scott v. Sandford decision on March 6, 
1857. Written by Chief Justice Roger Brooke 
Taney, whose bust sits inside the entrance to 
the Old Supreme Court Chamber in the 
United States Capitol, this opinion declared 
that African Americans were not citizens of 
the United States and could not sue in Fed-
eral courts. This decision further declared 
that Congress did not have the authority to 
prohibit slavery in the territories. 
(2) Chief Justice Roger Brooke Taney’s au-
thorship of Dred Scott v. Sandford, the effects 
of which would only be overturned years 
later by the ratification of the 13th, 14th, and 
15th Amendments to the Constitution of the 
United States, renders a bust of his likeness 
unsuitable for the honor of display to the 
many visitors to the United States Capitol. 
(3) As Frederick Douglass said of this deci-
sion in May 1857, ‘‘This infamous decision of 
the Slaveholding wing of the Supreme Court 
maintains that slaves are within the con-
templation of the Constitution of the United 
States, property; that slaves are property in 
the same sense that horses, sheep, and swine 
are property; that the old doctrine that slav-
ery is a creature of local law is false; that 
the right of the slaveholder to his slave does 
not depend upon the local law, but is secured 
wherever the Constitution of the United 
States extends; that Congress has no right to 
prohibit slavery anywhere; that slavery may 
go in safety anywhere under the star-span-
gled banner; that colored persons of African 
descent have no rights that white men are 
bound to respect; that colored men of Afri-
can descent are not and cannot be citizens of 
the United States.’’. 
(4) While the removal of Chief Justice 
Roger Brooke Taney’s bust from the United 
States Capitol does not relieve the Congress 
of the historical wrongs it committed to pro-
tect the institution of slavery, it expresses 
Congress’s recognition of one of the most no-
torious wrongs to have ever taken place in 
one of its rooms, that of Chief Justice Roger 
Brooke Taney’s Dred Scott v. Sandford deci-
sion. 
(b) REMOVAL
OF BUST
OF ROGER BROOKE 
TANEY.—Not later than 45 days after the date 
of the enactment of this Act, the Joint Com-
mittee on the Library shall remove the bust 
of Roger Brooke Taney in the Old Supreme 
Court Chamber of the United States Capitol. 
(c) REPLACEMENT WITH BUST OF THURGOOD 
MARSHALL.— 
(1) OBTAINING BUST.—Not later than 2 years 
after the date of the enactment of this Act, 
the Joint Committee on the Library shall 
enter into an agreement to obtain a bust of 
Thurgood Marshall, under such terms and 
conditions as the Joint Committee considers 
appropriate consistent with applicable law. 
(2) PLACEMENT.—The Joint Committee on 
the Library shall place the bust obtained 
under paragraph (1) in the location in the 
Old Supreme Court Chamber of the United 
States Capitol where the bust of Roger 
Brooke Taney was located prior to removal 
by the Architect of the Capitol under sub-
section (b). 
SEC. 2. REMOVAL OF CERTAIN STATUES AND 
BUST. 
(a) REMOVAL.—Not later than 45 days after 
the date of the enactment of this Act, the 
Joint Committee on the Library shall re-
move the statue of Charles Brantley Aycock, 
the statue of John Caldwell Calhoun, the 
statue of James Paul Clarke, and the bust of 
John Cabell Breckinridge from any area of 
the United States Capitol which is accessible 
to the public. 
(b) STORAGE OF STATUES.—The Architect of 
the Capitol shall keep any statue and bust 
removed under subsection (a) in storage 
until the Architect and the State which pro-
vided the statue or bust arrange for the re-
turn of the statue or bust to the State.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H3659 
July 22, 2020 
Recognizing the issue of removing 
Confederate statues from the Capitol 
has been simmering for years. Since I 
recognize that, I will now approach the 
issue today with the utmost respect for 
those who are opposed to the goal of 
the legislation. But I ask the dissenters 
to consider that America has been a di-
vided nation since its founding, and it 
is past time for us to close this chapter 
of American history by removing stat-
ues that depict an era that caused 
enormous pain to African-American 
citizens. 
Mr. Speaker, as you, I grew up in the 
rural, segregated South. Commonplace 
were Confederate flags and monuments 
on public property, honoring Confed-
erate soldiers and the Confederacy. 
Many Southern jurisdictions are now 
voluntarily removing these statues. 
President Abraham Lincoln won the 
1860 general election by winning 18 of 
29 States. The 11 States that Lincoln 
failed 
to 
carry 
were 
slaveholding 
States. These States were fearful that 
Lincoln would find a way to end slav-
ery and deprive slave owners of their 
so-called property. 
Eleven Southern States, after Lin-
coln was elected, immediately seceded 
from the Union, forming the Confed-
erate States of America. The CSA 
elected its leadership. They printed a 
currency and stood up a military. 
At Fort Sumter on April 12, 1861, the 
Confederate States of America took 
military action against the United 
States of America. For the following 4 
years, more than 600,000 Americans lost 
their lives on the battlefield, including, 
I might say, African-American soldiers 
who fought for the Union. 
This was not a war between the 
States; it was a war against the United 
States of America by 11 Southern 
States. 
When the Union finally won the war, 
and both sides buried their dead, 4 mil-
lion slaves were granted their freedom 
by the signing of the Emancipation 
Proclamation and passage of the 13th 
Amendment. 
b 1415 
In 1864, each State was granted the 
privilege to donate two statues of de-
ceased persons to be displayed in the 
Capitol that depict the history of their 
State. These statues are now known as 
the National Statuary Hall Collection. 
Approximately 10 of these statues de-
pict men who volunteered to fight 
against the United States in the Civil 
War. 
All of these statues were donated 
many decades after the Civil War. Like 
many other statues around the country 
honoring members of the CSA, and par-
ticularly those erected in the South, 
these 10 statues were not donated and 
installed in the Capitol until the 1900s, 
during the height of Jim Crow. 
Many Americans see these statues 
and the timing of their placement as a 
means to intimidate African Ameri-
cans and to perpetuate the notion of 
white supremacy. We must not con-
tinue to honor these combatants by al-
lowing their images to be on display in 
the Capitol. 
The bill before us today also identi-
fies several other statues for removal 
or replacement that are not part of the 
National Statuary Hall Collection, in-
cluding the bust of Chief Justice Roger 
B. Taney, who authored the 1857 Su-
preme Court decision of Dred Scott v. 
Sandford, which ruled that slaves could 
not be considered citizens and that 
Congress did not have the ability to 
ban slavery. This opinion, Mr. Speaker, 
is regarded as possibly the Supreme 
Court’s worst decision of all time, and 
the 7–2 decision was a major factor con-
tributing to the war. 
Another bust not part of the collec-
tion is of Vice President John Breckin-
ridge, 1857 to 1861. In 1860, Mr. Speaker, 
Breckinridge ran for President on the 
Southern Democratic ticket and he 
lost. 
During the Civil War, Breckinridge 
served in the United States Senate 
from Kentucky but became a traitor 
and enlisted in the Confederate mili-
tary, and he was assigned to the army 
of Mississippi stationed in Jackson, 
Mississippi, achieving the rank of 
major general. He was expelled from 
the Senate. Jefferson Davis then ap-
pointed him as Secretary of War. After 
the war, he fled the country for several 
years. 
So I ask my colleagues, I ask Amer-
ica: Does this bust deserve to stand 
outside of the Senate Chamber? I would 
hope that your answer to that question 
will be no. 
Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to 
answer the summons of our time by 
voting to remove all of these offensive 
statues from the Capitol of the United 
States of America. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the 
gentlewoman 
from 
California 
(Ms. 
PELOSI), the Speaker of the House. 
Ms. PELOSI. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman for yielding and for his 
leadership in bringing us together 
today, along with our distinguished 
leader, Mr. HOYER; our distinguished 
whip, Mr. JIM CLYBURN; Congressional 
Black 
Caucus 
Chair 
KAREN
BASS; 
Chairman BENNIE THOMPSON; Congress-
woman 
BARBARA
LEE; 
and 
Mr. 
BUTTERFIELD. I thank Mr. BUTTERFIELD 
for leading this critical effort, so im-
portant. 
Mr. Speaker, as our country knows, 
nearly 2 months after the murder of 
George 
Floyd, 
America 
remains 
gripped by anguish as racial injustice 
continues to kill hundreds of Black 
Americans and tear apart the soul of 
our country. 
Last month, inspired by the activism 
of the American people and led by the 
Congressional Black Caucus, the House 
passed the George Floyd Justice in Po-
licing Act to fundamentally transform 
the culture of policing, to address sys-
temic racism, curb police brutality, de-
liver accountability, and save lives. 
On Juneteenth, I had the privilege as 
Speaker of the House, by my authority 
as Speaker of the House, to remove 
four paintings of Speakers of the House 
who were in the Speaker’s lobby, to re-
move them because they were part of 
the Confederacy, three of them before 
they came to the Congress and one who 
came after his participation in the 
Confederacy. 
It was long overdue. When we were 
checking out the statues, we found out 
about the paintings, and on Juneteenth 
we said good-bye to those four. 
Now in Congress and in the country, 
we must maintain a drumbeat to en-
sure that this moment of anguish con-
tinues to be transformed into action. 
That is why, today, the House is proud 
to pass legislation to remove from the 
U.S. Capitol the 12 statues of Confed-
erate officials and four other statues 
honoring persons who similarly exem-
plify bigotry and hate. 
Mr. Speaker, again I thank Leader 
HOYER, Whip CLYBURN, CBC Chair 
KAREN BASS, Chairman BENNIE THOMP-
SON, Congresswoman BARBARA LEE, and 
Chairman G.K. BUTTERFIELD for lead-
ing this effort. 
As I have said before, the Halls of 
Congress are the very heart of our de-
mocracy. The statues in the Capitol 
should embody our highest ideals as 
Americans, expressing who we are and 
what we aspire to as a nation. Monu-
ments to men who advocated barba-
rism and racism are a grotesque affront 
to those ideals. Their statues pay hom-
age to hate, not heritage. 
Among the Confederate statues in 
the Capitol—can you believe this?—are 
Jefferson Davis and Alexander Ste-
phens, president and vice president, re-
spectively, of the Confederacy, both of 
whom 
were 
charged 
with 
treason 
against America. Both were charged 
with treason against America, and 
they have statues in the Capitol. 
Now, think of this about Stephens—I 
hate to even use his words, but it may 
be important for people to know why 
the statues have to go in clearer terms. 
The infamous words of Stephens make 
as clear today as they did in 1861 the 
aims of the Confederacy. 
In his so-called Cornerstone Speech, 
Stephens asserted that the ‘‘prevailing 
ideas’’ relied upon by the Framers in-
cluded ‘‘the assumption of the equality 
of races. This was in error,’’ says Mr. 
Stephens. 
Instead, he laid out in blunt and sim-
ple terms the awful truth of the Con-
federacy. He said: ‘‘Our new govern-
ment is founded upon exactly the oppo-
site idea.’’ 
Imagine, exactly the opposite idea of 
equality of races. 
‘‘Its foundations are laid, its corner-
stone rests, upon the great truth’’—and 
these are his words; I hate to even use 
them, but we have to face this reality— 
‘‘the Negro is not equal to the White 
man; that slavery, subordination to the 
superior race, is his natural and nor-
mal condition.’’ 
He has got a statue in the Capitol of 
the United States. 
How can we seek to end the scourge 
of racism in America when we allow

the worst perpetrators of that racism 
to be lauded in the Halls of Congress? 
This bill also removes the statue of 
John Calhoun, the unapologetic leader 
of the Senate’s pro-slavery faction, 
who, on the Senate floor, celebrated 
slavery as a ‘‘positive good.’’ 
Mr. Speaker, I know Mr. CLYBURN 
supports removing this South Caro-
linian. 
On the floor, John C. Calhoun made 
this vile assertion that ‘‘in few coun-
tries is so much left to the share of the 
laborer, and so little exacted from him, 
or more kind attention paid to him in 
sickness or infirmities of age.’’ 
What could he have been talking 
about? 
It removes from the old Supreme 
Court Chamber the bust of Justice 
Roger Taney. And this is because of the 
persistent leadership of Mr. HOYER, 
who has been on this case for a long 
time. 
Justice Taney was the author of the 
Dred 
Scott 
ruling, 
which 
Mr. 
BUTTERFIELD very clearly laid out as 
probably one of the worst decisions of 
the Supreme Court ever, certainly a 
horrific stain on the history of our 
country, and certainly on the Court. 
How fitting it is that the Taney bust 
will be replaced with a bust of U.S. Su-
preme Court Justice Thurgood Mar-
shall, a towering champion of equality 
and justice in America. 
Mr. CLYBURN, as well as Mr. HOYER, 
has been working on this. Mr. HOYER is 
a Marylander. I am a Baltimorean. As 
we all know, the airport in Baltimore 
is named for Thurgood Marshall. So as 
one who was born and raised there, I 
take pride in his leadership and service 
to the country. 
Let 
us 
recall 
Justice 
Marshall’s 
words spoken nearly 30 years ago but 
as true today. Justice Marshall said: 
‘‘Democracy cannot flourish amid fear. 
Liberty cannot bloom amid hate. Jus-
tice cannot take root amid rage. Amer-
ica must get to work. In the chill cli-
mate in which we live, we must go 
against the prevailing wind. We must 
dissent from the indifference. We must 
dissent from the apathy. We must dis-
sent from the fear, the hatred, and the 
mistrust. We must dissent, because 
America can do better, because Amer-
ica has no choice but to do better.’’ 
How much our great Elijah Cum-
mings reflected the words of Thurgood 
Marshall, two Baltimoreans. 
The Congress now has a sacred oppor-
tunity and obligation to do better, to 
make meaningful change to ensure 
that the halls of the U.S. Capitol re-
flect the highest ideals as Americans. 
Mr. HOYER, as our distinguished floor 
leader, had this planned for awhile that 
everybody would work together and 
bring this composite bill to the floor at 
this time. Little did we know when 
those plans were being made that, at 
the same time, we would be mourning 
the loss of our darling John Lewis. It is 
a death in the family for us in the Con-
gress. But he knew that this was in the 
works, and he is up there looking down 
on us to make sure it happens in the 
most bipartisan way. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge a strong bipar-
tisan vote for this important step for 
justice, reconciliation, and progress in 
America. 
As far as our John Lewis is con-
cerned: Thank you. Thank you for 
bringing us to this place. May you rest 
in peace. 
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. 
Speaker, at this time, it looks like I 
am going to be here on the floor with 
many of our colleagues who are going 
to offer remarks on this legislation, so 
I will give my opening remarks after I 
yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from 
California (Mr. MCCLINTOCK). 
Mr. MCCLINTOCK. Mr. Speaker, first 
and foremost, the Confederacy was a 
fundamental attack on our Constitu-
tion and the founding principles of our 
Nation, and it should never be roman-
ticized or lauded. 
I have got no problems with remov-
ing, lawfully, any monument that spe-
cifically honors this rebellion, but that 
is not what this bill does. Rather, it be-
gins by removing the bust of Roger 
Taney from the Old Supreme Court 
Chamber. 
Now, it is true he wrote the abso-
lutely worst decision ever rendered by 
the Supreme Court, the Dred Scott de-
cision, but let’s not forget he also pre-
sided over and joined in one of its bet-
ter decisions, the Amistad slave case. 
If we remove memorials to every per-
son in this building who ever made a 
bad decision—and his was the worst— 
well, this will be a very barren place, 
indeed. It is only by the bad things in 
our history that we can truly measure 
all of the good things in our history. 
Now, this bill also removes the stat-
ues of Confederate sympathizers sent 
to the Capitol by the States. Well, that 
is not our decision. That is a decision 
that has always belonged to the indi-
vidual States, and several of them are 
already making these decisions. We 
should let them. 
The only other one is John C. Breck-
inridge of Kentucky, who is honored 
not for his service to the Confederacy 
but, rather, for his service as Vice 
President of the United States. And, 
granted, we have had some absolutely 
terrible Vice Presidents through our 
history, and I am sure we will in the 
future, but if we are going to start 
down that road, we are going to be 
swapping out statues like trading cards 
at the whim of the moment. Our Na-
tion’s history should be made of stern-
er stuff. 
Perhaps we would all be better ad-
vised to practice a little temporal hu-
mility and heed the wisdom of Omar 
Khayyam: ‘‘The moving finger writes; 
and, having writ, moves on: nor all thy 
piety nor wit shall lure it back to can-
cel half a line, nor all thy tears wash 
out a word of it.’’ 
Mr. BUTTERFIELD. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield such time as he may consume to 
the gentleman from South Carolina 
(Mr. CLYBURN), the Democratic whip, 
the gentleman representing the Sixth 
Congressional District of South Caro-
lina, the State where the Civil War 
began, who is a national expert on 
American 
history, 
having 
been 
a 
former history teacher, as I recall. 
b 1430 
Mr. CLYBURN. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman from North Carolina for 
yielding me the time, and for his lead-
ership and his management of this sig-
nificant piece of legislation. 
I want to thank Mr. DAVIS and the 
other Members on the other side for 
their tremendous cooperation in trying 
to help us move to a more perfect 
Union. 
Mr. Speaker, 7 years ago, I stood on 
this floor and I referred to this Cham-
ber, this great Hall, as America’s class-
room. And it is in that spirit that I 
think of this building as America’s 
schoolhouse. And what is taught in this 
building, what is experienced by the 
people who visit this building ought to 
be about the uplifting of this great Na-
tion. 
What people see when they come 
here, who people see lauded, glorified, 
and honored when they visit this build-
ing ought to be people who are uplift-
ing to history and the human spirit. 
It is in that light that I recall the 
writings of one great writer who wrote 
that if we fail to learn the lessons of 
history—I 
think 
it 
was 
George 
Santiano—we are bound to repeat 
them. 
There are a lot of lessons to be 
learned from history. I study it every 
day. Hardly a day goes by when I don’t 
spend some time looking at some facet 
of American history. 
We did not come to this floor with 
this legislation to get rid of that his-
tory. A lot of it we don’t like; a lot of 
it we do like. And I think that what we 
need to do is discern between what 
should be honored and what should be 
relegated to the museums and to other 
places to commemorate that history. 
That is not eradicating history. That is 
putting history in its proper place. 
And for those who did not do what I 
think they should have done, they have 
got a place in the history books, but it 
is not to be honored, and it is not to be 
glorified. It ought to be put in its prop-
er perspective. 
So I don’t have a problem with the 
fact that one of the statues in here, 
John C. Calhoun—he was a historical 
figure. He died in 1850, if my memory 
serves, 10 years before the war broke 
out. So we aren’t talking about John C. 
Calhoun as a Confederate. We are talk-
ing about John C. Calhoun as one of 
the Nation’s biggest proponents of 
slavery and the relegation of human 
beings. 
I want to thank my home State of 
South Carolina, because the people of 
Charleston, Mayor Tecklenburg and 
the city council in Charleston, decided 
several weeks ago, the John C. Calhoun 
statue should be taken down, and they 
did it.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H3661 
July 22, 2020 
Clemson University—Calhoun, one of 
the great founders of that university— 
is one of the original land grant 
schools. Clemson University decided 
that they would take John C. Cal-
houn’s name off of their honors college. 
So if the State of South Carolina, 
where he was from sees that, why is it 
that we are going to laud him in this 
building? 
I am asking my colleagues to do for 
John C. Calhoun what his home State 
is doing for him, putting him in his 
proper place, not a place of honor. 
They didn’t tear down his statue; they 
very meticulously took it down to re-
tire to his proper place. 
Mr. Speaker, you and I spoke last 
night about one other gentleman whose 
statue is in this building, Wade Hamp-
ton. Wade Hampton, he was not a Con-
federate, but he was a perseverer. 
There were three Wade Hamptons, sen-
ior, and the third. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentleman has expired. 
Mr. BUTTERFIELD. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield the gentleman from South Caro-
lina an additional 1 minute. 
Mr. CLYBURN. But Wade Hampton’s 
history should not be glorified. I don’t 
know what my State’s going to do 
about him, but what I would like to see 
us do here is put him in his proper 
place. 
So those two statues that are here 
representing the State of South Caro-
lina need to be removed from their 
places of honor and, at some point, I 
would hope the State would bring them 
back home and put them in their prop-
er place. 
So, I would like to say here today 
that I am not for destroying any stat-
ue. I am not here for burning down any 
building. I am here to ask my col-
leagues to return these people very 
properly and lawfully to their proper 
place. Put them where they can be 
studied. Put them where people will 
know exactly who and what they were. 
But do not honor them. Do not glo-
rify them. Take them out of this great 
schoolhouse so that the people who 
visit here can be uplifted by what this 
country is all about. 
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, it is an honor to follow 
Whip CLYBURN and the historical con-
text of being a history teacher, and 
also the historical context of serving 
this institution and what it means. So 
I thank Whip CLYBURN for his leader-
ship. 
I 
thank 
my 
good 
friend, 
Mr. 
BUTTERFIELD, for his leadership on this 
issue. We are going to work together 
today to make sure that we are sending 
a message to the American people that 
it is Republicans and Democrats stand-
ing together. 
Now, I have a unique district in cen-
tral Illinois. I am from the Land of 
Lincoln. As a matter of fact, Abe, him-
self, lived in my district. I represent 
Lincoln’s Tomb, Lincoln’s Home. The 
old State Capitol where Abraham Lin-
coln delivered his ‘‘House Divided’’ 
speech in 1858 is in my Congressional 
District. It was there when Lincoln not 
only spoke out against slavery and, 
specifically, the Dred Scott decision, 
but stood unequivocally in support of a 
free country, famously saying: ‘‘A 
house divided against itself cannot 
stand. I believe this government can-
not endure, permanently half slave and 
half free. I do not expect the Union to 
be dissolved—I do not expect the house 
to fall—but I do expect it will cease to 
be divided. It will become all one thing 
or all the other.’’ 
While Lincoln and many others who 
stood 
for 
freedom 
are 
represented 
throughout this Capitol, there are oth-
ers that symbolize the opposite. While 
we cannot erase our past and should do 
everything we can—as Whip CLYBURN 
just stated—we should do everything 
we can to learn from it instead. 
The statues in the U.S. Capitol rep-
resent to visitors throughout the world 
what we stand for as a Nation. I sup-
port this important discussion about 
which statues belong in the U.S. Cap-
itol and, also, the goal of this legisla-
tion. 
Before we began debating this piece 
of 
legislation, 
my 
friend, 
Mr. 
BUTTERFIELD, and I had a discussion, a 
discussion about the 13th Amendment. 
And I invite all Members of this insti-
tution to come to my district, to come 
to the Abraham Lincoln Presidential 
Museum and Library, where I can show 
you an original copy of the 13th 
Amendment; also, one of the first cop-
ies of the Emancipation Proclamation. 
This institution is not just an ex-
tended classroom. Where Lincoln lived, 
where Lincoln is honored, the 13th Dis-
trict of Illinois, that I am truly blessed 
to represent, is also a living classroom 
of the good things in our Nation’s his-
tory. 
Now, we also have to remember that 
the National Statuary Hall Collection 
was created in 1864 to commemorate 
States and their contributions to this 
country. And many statues being dis-
cussed today were donated by States to 
the collection nearly 100 years ago. 
And as my colleagues earlier said, 
many States are already working to re-
move them. 
While I support their removal, I be-
lieve the better route would have been 
to have some more hearings in the 
Committee on House Administration. 
But today, today, is not about politics. 
Today is about coming together as an 
institution. And today is a day that I 
can say I proudly am blessed to be a 
Member of Congress. 
Our country, right now, is facing a 
very difficult time, and Abraham Lin-
coln’s spirit of unity is desperately 
needed. ‘‘A house divided against itself 
cannot stand.’’ As leaders, we need to 
come together to show there is much 
more that unites us Americans than di-
vides us, and lead this country, to-
gether, Republicans and Democrats, 
through this difficult time. 
I hope this legislation today, the bi-
partisanship that we will see, is a shin-
ing example to the rest of the country 
of what we can build together. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. BUTTERFIELD. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Let me thank the gentleman from Il-
linois. I am just delighted that he men-
tioned that his home State, the State 
of Illinois, was, in fact, the home of 
Abraham Lincoln. 
I am a student of history and love to 
read that portion of our history, and I 
recall that many people believe that it 
was the Emancipation Proclamation on 
January 1 of 1863 that legally ended 
slavery in America. The Emancipation 
Proclamation, as great as it was, was 
an executive order. 
It was the 13th Amendment, as the 
gentleman 
mentioned, 
that 
legally 
ended slavery in America; thereby free-
ing 4 million slaves, most of whom 
lived in the South. 
Mr. Speaker, you should know, and 
to my friend from Illinois, that it was 
on January 31, 1865, a few days after 
Lincoln’s re-election, that this body, 
this body, the House of Representa-
tives, passed the 13th Amendment to 
the Constitution. It required the ratifi-
cation of 27 States. 
The gentleman from Illinois’ home 
State was the first State, on February 
1, 1865 to ratify the 13th Amendment. 
My State of North Carolina was the 
26th State, and the State of Georgia 
was the final State to ratify the 13th 
Amendment on December 6, 1865. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the 
gentleman from Maryland (Mr. HOYER), 
the State which is the home of both 
Chief Justice Taney and the first Afri-
can American Associate Justice of the 
U.S. Supreme Court, the Honorable 
Thurgood Marshall. 
Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman from North Carolina, 
the former Justice of the North Caro-
lina Supreme Court, for yielding. 
I am glad that I was on the floor to 
hear the remarks of the ranking mem-
ber, Mr. DAVIS. I am going to bring up 
a quote. I won’t get it soon enough to 
read right now, but I will read it. 
David Brooks wrote a column in the 
New York Times and he said we were 
facing five crises in America. One, of 
course, the pandemic. 
He said the second crisis was the cri-
sis of confronting racism and the his-
tory of racism and slavery and segrega-
tion in our country. 
The observation he made was that 
Americans, post-George Floyd, have 
been riveted on the recognition of our 
past and the recognition of our present, 
and how we need to improve the treat-
ment and the reality of equality in 
America. 
b 1445 
I think Brooks’ observation will be 
proved today on the floor, Mr. Speaker, 
as we come together not in partisan

disagreement but in unity of purpose, 
recognizing that our conscience and 
the conscience of America has also 
been pricked by the loss of John Lewis, 
who all his life fought for equality. 
Mr. Speaker, the Capitol Building is 
a sacred space for our American democ-
racy. It is where we write our laws, in-
augurate our Presidents, and say a 
somber farewell to great Americans 
who earned our respect, like Dwight 
Eisenhower, other Presidents, and Rosa 
Parks. 
Mr. Speaker, we cannot erase the dif-
ficult history and painful truth that 
this temple to liberty was built using 
the labor of enslaved people. But we 
can, Mr. Speaker, do everything in our 
power to ensure that how we use the 
Capitol today reflects our commitment 
to equality and justice for all. 
For too long, we have greeted visi-
tors from here and abroad with the 
statues of those who denigrated these 
values by championing sedition, slav-
ery, segregation, and inequality. 
As a Marylander, I have always been 
uncomfortable that the Old Supreme 
Court Chamber prominently displays a 
bust of former Chief Justice Roger 
Brooke Taney, who was from my dis-
trict, as a matter of fact, the county 
across the river from my house, Cal-
vert County. 
Taney, of course, was the son of 
slaveholders and the author of the 1857 
Dred Scott ruling that upheld slavery 
and said that African Americans could 
not be citizens. This was a man, Mr. 
Speaker, who, in his zeal to protect the 
interests of slaveholders and uphold a 
system of white supremacy, wrote an 
opinion that twisted the very meaning 
of America’s founding. 
After quoting the Declaration of 
Independence, ‘‘We hold these truths to 
be self-evident, that all men are cre-
ated equal,’’ Taney wrote this: ‘‘The 
general words above quoted would seem 
to embrace the whole human family, 
and if they were used in a similar in-
strument at this day,’’ meaning 1857, 
‘‘would be so understood.’’ He went on 
to say: ‘‘But it is too clear for dispute 
that the enslaved African race were not 
intended to be included and formed no 
part of the people who framed and 
adopted this declaration.’’ Of course, 
neither did women. 
In short, Mr. Speaker, Taney argued 
that, in his day, in 1857, people of Afri-
can descent had come to be seen as 
human beings, but because our Found-
ers in 1776 did not view them as such, 
Black people could never truly be citi-
zens of the United States. 
What he was saying, Mr. Speaker, 
was that Black lives did not matter. 
And so, Mr. Speaker, when we hear 
that phrase today, that Black lives 
matter, it is fundamental to what 
America is and has become. 
Sadly, 
Roger 
Brooke 
Taney—re-
spected in his time, the attorney gen-
eral of my State, the Attorney General 
of the United States, the Acting Sec-
retary of the Treasury—could not ex-
tricate himself from the false premises 
of the past. 
Abraham Lincoln was, as Mr. DAVIS 
pointed out, outraged at the decision 
he wrote, arguably, as my friend the 
Justice said earlier today, the worst 
case in the history of the Supreme 
Court of the United States. 
In short, Taney argued that people of 
African descent had come to be seen as 
human beings, but because our Found-
ers did not view them as such, Black 
people could never truly be citizens of 
our country. Think of that, the blind-
ness and schizophrenia of 1787 repeated 
80 years later in 1857. 
One of the great facets of America is 
that we can grow. We change, and we 
can accommodate to better knowledge, 
better insight, and better inclinations. 
The past, Taney argued, bound those in 
the present to follow the errors of their 
forebears in perpetuity. Let us reject 
that premise out of hand lest the more 
perfect Union will never be attainable. 
What he could not or would not ac-
cept is that the passage of time allows 
us the space to grow as individuals, as 
States, and as a country so that we 
may see our faults and correct them, 
not repeat them. 
In Maryland, we have grappled with 
that difficult history of our State with 
regard to slavery and the Civil War. 
While our State did not secede from 
the Union, many Marylanders sym-
pathized with slavery in the South and 
fought for the Confederacy. 
Mr. Speaker, I represent what was 
the largest slaveholding area of the 
State of Maryland. We grew tobacco 
and some cotton, but mainly tobacco. 
Early Maryland was built on the prof-
its of slavery, and it sent individuals 
like Taney to serve in America’s ear-
liest institutions. Indeed, in his infa-
mous decision, he drew on his home 
State’s ban of interracial marriage as 
justification for his views. 
One of the ironies, Mr. Speaker, is 
that I was elected to the Maryland 
State Senate in 1966, and one of my 
first votes in January 1967 as a Mary-
land State senator at the age of 27 was 
to vote to repeal the miscegenation 
statutes in my State. Of course, the 
Supreme Court had ruled on that be-
fore, but we still had not repealed it 110 
years after Dred Scott. 
Maryland today, like other States 
where slavery and segregation had a 
long history, is not the same place that 
it was when Taney wrote his opinion, 
nor are these States today the same 
places they were when many of the 
statues and busts of Confederates and 
segregationists were sent here to our 
Capitol during a period of intense and 
racially charged sectionalism. 
In recent years, Maryland made the 
courageous and correct choice to re-
move a statue of Taney from the 
grounds of the statehouse in Annapolis. 
I strongly supported that decision, as 
did 
our 
Republican 
Governor, 
Mr. 
Hogan, and our Democratic legislature. 
Removing 
a 
statue—as 
my 
dear 
friend of over one-half century, Mr. 
CLYBURN, observed on this floor—does 
not erase history. That act by itself 
will not make right what was so ter-
ribly wrong in the past. But the statues 
we choose to set in places of honor are 
a reflection of the present, not the 
past. They show our fellow American 
and foreign visitors what our values 
are today. 
Our decision to remove statues of 
seditionists, white supremacists, Con-
federates, and segregationists and re-
place them with defenders of justice 
and equality shows that, as a country, 
we are capable of critical introspection 
and growth. 
That is our strength. That is the 
glory of America: working toward a 
more perfect Union. 
That is why I introduced this bill 
along with Representative LEE, Whip 
CLYBURN, 
Chairwoman 
BASS, 
and 
Chairman THOMPSON, who sits in the 
chair today. That itself is a historic 
demonstration of the change that we 
have wrought. Not only could a Black 
man from Mississippi be a Member of 
the Congress, but he can preside over 
the Congress. He matters, and his life 
matters. 
Taney was wrong because, in the 21st 
century, we must not be Roger Brooke 
Taney’s America anymore, nor can we 
be Jim Crow’s. 
Our bill removes the bust of Chief 
Justice Taney from the Old Supreme 
Court Chamber and replaces it with a 
bust of Thurgood Marshall, a son of 
Baltimore. The irony is the Taney stat-
ue was on the east front of the Capitol, 
Mr. Speaker. If you turned around and 
went through the Capitol 5 years ago, 
10 years ago, 15 years, if you went 
through about 500 feet and walked out 
on the west front, you walked into 
Thurgood Marshall Memorial, as you 
would today. He was our first African- 
American Justice. 
How appropriate it is that we honor 
him in place of Roger Brooke Taney. 
Thurgood Marshall is the face of our 
Maryland in 2020, not Roger Taney. 
Second, our bill no longer allows 
States to display statues in the Capitol 
of individuals who voluntarily served 
the Confederacy against our Union dur-
ing the Civil War. 
Let me just say as an aside that none 
of us are perfect. Our Founders weren’t 
perfect, but what our Founders did was 
create a union. The statues we are re-
moving tried to destroy a union. 
Third, there are three specific stat-
ues in the collection of individuals who 
did not serve in the Confederacy but 
whose careers were built on the perpet-
uation of White supremacy and seg-
regation. Our bill would require those 
statues to be removed and replaced as 
well, as my friend, JIM CLYBURN, said, 
not destroyed. We urge nobody to tear 
down statues—to remove them, yes; to 
destroy them, no. 
They do not reflect the diversity and 
inclusivity of our Nation today, nor do 
they comport with our values as a na-
tion that has reached a greater under-
standing of the principles enshrined in 
the Declaration of Independence, that 
all are created equal, and humankind,

Taney admitted in 1857, would have 
been the understanding of that phrase. 
There are still, sadly, a lot of people in 
our country in 2020 who do not under-
stand that our diversity is our strength 
or recognize clearly that Black lives 
matter. 
Taney forcefully argued they did not. 
He was willfully wrong. They do, and 
they must. I believe that most Ameri-
cans are deeply distressed by racial in-
justice and want to see the progress of 
the civil rights movement continue. 
They want our Nation and our democ-
racy to grow, mature, and become 
more perfect. Part of that process is 
making it clear through our symbols 
and public displays of honor what our 
country stands for and, as importantly, 
what it must never stand for again. 
So, Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues 
on both sides of the aisle to join us not 
as an expression of partisan opinion 
but an expression of America’s values 
to our citizens and to the world that we 
do not glorify racism, bigotry, and ex-
clusion in the temple to liberty and in 
the land of the free. 
I hope our colleagues will join in 
making possible and making sure that 
all Americans, no matter their race, 
can come to this Capitol and know that 
they have an equal share in a govern-
ment that is truly of the people, by the 
people, and for the people. 
b 1500 
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gen-
tleman from the State of Michigan 
(Mr. MITCHELL), my friend. 
Mr. 
MITCHELL. 
Mr. 
Speaker, 
I 
thank the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. 
RODNEY DAVIS) for yielding. 
Mr. Speaker, I wasn’t planning on 
speaking on this. It is an honor to 
speak after Mr. HOYER. 
I heard Mr. CLYBURN
speak elo-
quently regarding the removal of stat-
ues, statues including that of former 
Chief Justice Taney, a statue honoring 
him for what we all agree was the most 
dreadful decision the Supreme Court 
has ever made in this country, not 
based upon the law but based upon his 
feelings 
that 
African 
Americans 
weren’t people. 
I am speaking today not so much 
that it convinces anybody in this 
Chamber, but I am speaking about his-
tory, and I am speaking about my chil-
dren, my children and my grand-
children, that they need to remember 
the history of this Nation. 
The history of this Nation is so 
fraught with racial division, with ha-
tred, and the only way to overcome 
that is to recognize that, acknowledge 
it for what it is. 
Mr. Speaker, I support this resolu-
tion, and I support what Mr. CLYBURN 
said: to remove statues such as that of 
Mr. Taney, to lawfully remove them— 
not tear them down, not destroy 
them—return them back to the States 
and places from which they came, and 
to study, to put them in the study of 
the history of this Nation, because it 
should not be lost. Tearing it down 
does not do justice to the history of 
this Nation and what our young people 
must understand. 
Mr. Speaker, what you have gone 
through in your life, Mr. Lewis did and 
others, we can’t simply ignore it and 
say, because we tore down statues or 
we burn things, it is suddenly gone. No, 
we need to recognize those things as 
part of our history in order to move on 
beyond them. Because, as many have 
said, to not acknowledge, to recognize, 
to understand our history runs a very 
real risk of reliving it. And, my God, 
we can’t continue to do that. 
Mr. Speaker, I support the resolution 
and support the removal of statues. 
Mr. BUTTERFIELD. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield 11⁄2 minutes to the gentlewoman 
from California (Ms. LEE), a passionate 
advocate for underserved communities. 
Ms. LEE of California. Mr. Speaker, 
let me first thank the gentleman for 
yielding and for his tremendous leader-
ship and constantly reminding us of 
the accurate accounting of the United 
States’ history. 
Also, I thank our Speaker; our ma-
jority leader; our whip, Mr. CLYBURN; 
Chairwoman BASS; Chairman BENNIE 
THOMPSON; and, of course, Congressman 
BUTTERFIELD for moving this legisla-
tion forward with the urgency that it 
requires. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support 
of H.R. 7573, which would remove 
shameful reminders of slavery and seg-
regation from the United States Cap-
itol. 
Now, in 2017, in the wake of the white 
nationalist rally in Charlottesville, I 
introduced the Confederate Monument 
Removal Act to remove all statues of 
people who voluntarily served the Con-
federacy from the Capitol building. So, 
thank you for including this in this 
current bill. 
Venerating those who took up arms 
against the United States to preserve 
slavery is an affront to the human dig-
nity of all Americans. These painful 
symbols of bigotry and racism have no 
place in public places—certainly should 
not be enshrined in the United States 
Capitol. 
It is past time for Congress to stop 
glorifying the men who were traitors 
and committed treason against the 
United States in a concerted effort to 
keep African Americans in chains. 
The movement to honor Confederate 
soldiers was a deliberate act to rewrite 
the very history of the United States 
and humanize acts designed to dehu-
manize African Americans. They are 
symbols of hatred and defiance of Fed-
eral authority and should not be held 
in a place of honor in the United States 
Capitol. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentlewoman has expired. 
Mr. BUTTERFIELD. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield an additional 30 seconds to the 
gentlewoman from California. 
Ms. LEE of California. Mr. Speaker, I 
conclude by saying this: In this mo-
ment, the horrors of systemic racism 
are front and center, and the mani-
festations are before the public each 
and every day. The removal of the Con-
federate 
statues 
from 
the 
United 
States Capitol is an important step in 
dismantling the systems that hold us 
back. 
As a descendant of enslaved Ameri-
cans 
from 
Galveston, 
Texas, 
and 
enslaved human beings, I thank you for 
this bill, and I ask for an ‘‘aye’’ vote. 
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. 
Speaker, I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. BUTTERFIELD. Mr. Speaker, 
may I inquire how much time each side 
has remaining. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from North Carolina has 131⁄2 
minutes remaining. The gentleman 
from Illinois has 21 minutes remaining. 
Mr. BUTTERFIELD. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from 
Maryland (Mr. RASKIN), a member of 
the House Committee on Administra-
tion, a great constitutional scholar and 
friend. 
Mr. RASKIN. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
Mr. BUTTERFIELD for his really exem-
plary leadership here. 
Mr. Speaker, it is a proud day for 
Maryland as we move to replace the 
bust of Roger Brooke Taney with the 
bust of Thurgood Marshall. 
One Marylander wrote the infamous 
Dred Scott decision, hundreds of pages 
of argumentation about how the Con-
stitution is and must forever be a 
White man’s compact and that African 
Americans have no rights that White 
people have to respect. 
The other, Thurgood Marshall, whose 
bust will replace that of Justice Taney, 
argued Brown v. Board of Education, 
argued Shelley v. Kraemer, argued 
Smith v. Albright, became the first Af-
rican-American Associate Justice of 
the Supreme Court. He made equal pro-
tection come alive in our country. So 
it is a proud day for Maryland. 
I was delighted to hear the gen-
tleman from Illinois’ remarks, but I 
was amazed to hear another colleague 
in the minority defending the bust of 
John C. Breckinridge on the grounds 
that we don’t honor him for his service 
as secretary of war in the Confederacy 
but we, rather, honor him for what he 
did before that in his prior service as 
United States Senator and Vice Presi-
dent of the United States. 
Well, that is just precious. Think 
about that for a second. 
Breckinridge was serving as a U.S. 
Senator from Kentucky when he de-
fected to the Confederacy, signed up to 
become their secretary of war, and be-
trayed the Union. And they still have 
his bust outside of the United States 
Senate saying ‘‘Vice President’’ on it, 
despite the fact that, on December 4, 
1861, he was convicted of treason by the 
Senate and stripped of all of his titles— 
including Senator, President of the 
Senate, and Vice President. 
So we may as well put up a statue of 
Benedict Arnold to honor him for his 
service to the Continental Army before

he defected over to the British side and 
led British groups against America. 
So let’s go all the way here. If there 
are statues of traitors and racist White 
supremacist supporters of the Confed-
eracy up in the Capitol, then we need 
to get rid of them. This is our oppor-
tunity to remake the social contract as 
represented by the symbolism in this 
great House. 
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. 
Speaker, I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. BUTTERFIELD. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentleman from 
Massachusetts (Mr. KENNEDY). 
Mr. Speaker, before he speaks, the 
history that I have read over the years 
suggests to me that, on January 31, 
1865, when the 13th Amendment was 
passed by this body, this Chamber, Mr. 
KENNEDY, the gallery was full of White 
abolitionist women from the Common-
wealth of Massachusetts who waved 
handkerchiefs and cheered for a pro-
longed period of time, cheering the 13th 
Amendment. 
Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the chairman. 
Mr. Speaker, 155 years ago, Senators 
from my home State of Massachusetts, 
Charles Sumner and Henry Wilson, 
knew that a bust of Roger Taney de-
served no home in our government’s 
highest institutions. Yet here we are, 
in 2020, and the bust of a man who tried 
to codify and protect our original sin 
remains only a few hundred feet away. 
Statues honoring traitors willing to 
destroy our Nation so that they could 
own Black men, women, and children 
litter our Capitol, and somehow we 
still need to have this debate. 
Let me be clear: Dismantling the 
symbols that glorify White supremacy 
is a bare minimum, but dismantling 
those symbols is no substitute for dis-
mantling the system that those men 
created. 
This cannot be the end or the best of 
what we can offer the millions who 
took to our streets demanding justice. 
This cannot be the end of our work. 
This shouldn’t even be considered the 
beginning of that work. It should have 
been done 150 years ago. 
Mr. Speaker, the Senate needs to 
pass the George Floyd Justice in Polic-
ing Act. We need to dismantle and de-
stroy White supremacy that exists ev-
erywhere, from our education system 
to our healthcare system, to our incar-
ceration and juvenile justice systems 
and our financial institutions and our 
economy. That is where we need to be 
working, and that is what begins. 
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. 
Speaker, I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. BUTTERFIELD. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from 
Mississippi (Mr. THOMPSON), the chair-
man of the Committee on Homeland 
Security, a great warrior of many 
years, Mr. BENNIE THOMPSON. 
Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. 
Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman 
from 
North 
Carolina 
(Mr. 
BUTTERFIELD) giving me an oppor-
tunity to speak. 
Mr. Speaker, for those of us who are 
sons of the South, for those of us who 
have endured hardship, discrimination, 
and a lot of things that are very dif-
ficult to even talk about, for this mo-
ment in time where we are today, 
where we are going to start the process 
of healing and setting the record 
straight as it relates to the real his-
tory of this country, it is fitting and 
proper that those individuals who 
fought to keep many of our ancestors 
enslaved should not have to be recog-
nized in a place where people who do 
good expect to be recognized. 
This is not a way of erasing history. 
It is a way of correcting history so that 
those people who come and see it will 
see it in the manner for which it is pre-
sented. So, at the end of this debate, I 
hope we all will be on the same page. 
This notion that in America it is not 
your color, it is not your race, it is not 
your sex, we have to stand for some-
thing; our values should mean some-
thing as Americans. 
So this bill establishes what America 
stands for, and we should not recognize 
traitors in order just to say we are to-
gether. Traitors have a place, but not 
in a place of honor. 
My State recognizes the president of 
the Confederacy. If he had won the war 
as president, none of us of color would 
be in this institution today. But thank 
God he lost and the South lost and we 
are better because of it. Mr. Speaker, 
for that, I ask support of this legisla-
tion. 
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. 
Speaker, I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. BUTTERFIELD. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield 11⁄2 minutes to the gentlewoman 
from Texas (Ms. JACKSON LEE), from 
the 18th District of Texas, a senior 
member of the Committee on the Judi-
ciary, Committee on Homeland Secu-
rity, and the author of H.R. 40, Ms. 
JACKSON LEE. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the manager of this legislation 
for his leadership. 
Let me also acknowledge and thank 
Mr. HOYER for his, as well, and to Mr. 
CLYBURN, Ms. BASS, Mr. THOMPSON, 
and, as I indicated, Mr. BUTTERFIELD. 
Mr. Speaker, let me start as I did 
just a few minutes ago, ‘‘In God we 
trust,’’ and recognize that God has cre-
ated, in many of our faiths, all of us 
equal as humans. We stand together 
dealing with the Confederacy that di-
minished and denied those descendants, 
those African slaves, their humanity. 
And yet, in a place of freedom, this 
place, we honor them. 
Mr. Speaker, I welcome H.R. 7573 and 
am glad to be joining as a staunch sup-
porter, for, if Justice Taney viewed me 
as inhuman, then that means that 
those today, those babies yet unborn 
from descendants of enslaved African 
Americans, would be inhuman. This is 
needed not because we don’t put it in 
the historical context, but because we 
need to unify America. 
Mr. Speaker, as we have lost a great 
warrior, John Lewis, and, as well, C. T. 
Vivian, I know they are looking down 
to say that we are not to honor those 
who voluntarily serve to deny us our 
humanity and to fight for the Confed-
eracy and were treasonous. 
b 1515 
Alexander Hamilton Stephens—it is 
interesting that he secured the name of 
Alexander Hamilton—has a statue in 
Statuary Hall. It says: 
I am not fearful of anything on Earth, I am 
not fearful of anything above, except to do 
something wrong. 
That is what Alexander Hamilton 
Stephens said. 
Well, this is wrong. It was wrong to 
enslave so many human beings and for 
that slavery to last over 200 years. 
I am delighted with the gentleman 
from Illinois for his congenial and his-
toric moment today, and we do it in 
unity. I offer peace to this Nation and 
to this body that we remove these by 
bringing America together. 
I know the family of George Floyd, 
who struck a chord in the hearts of all 
Americans and Black Lives Matter, 
would welcome this magnificent deci-
sion today. Let us do it together, under 
this flag. In God we trust. 
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. 
Speaker, I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. BUTTERFIELD. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield 11⁄2
minutes time to the gen-
tleman from Maryland (Mr. MFUME), 
my friend, who is not only the rep-
resentative of a district in Maryland, 
but also the former national president 
of the NAACP. 
Mr. MFUME. Mr. Speaker, 33 years 
ago, I stood near this spot and watched 
Thurgood Marshall come through these 
doors as a member of the Supreme 
Court at a State of the Union address. 
And as a Marylander and as a Balti-
morean, I had a great sense of pride. 
I got to know Mr. Marshall. All he 
ever said by his eloquence and his ex-
ample was this is how we ought to be 
as Supreme Court justices. 
I must tell you, I was dismayed, 
though, years earlier, to learn as a 
young student at Morgan State Univer-
sity the history of Roger B. Taney, who 
did just the opposite to my spirit and 
just the opposite, I think, to what we 
believe Supreme Court Justices should 
act like and how they conduct them-
selves. 
A gentleman from the other side ear-
lier said that Mr. Taney rendered the 
worst Supreme Court decision ever. 
And he is exactly right. That decision 
said that Black people had no rights 
for which the White man must respect, 
and therefore that the Negro might 
justly and lawfully be reduced to slav-
ery for his own benefit. It also said 
that Black people born in America, 
like Dred Scott, were not citizens and 
it 
eviscerated 
the 
Missouri 
Com-
promise of 1820.

with one instead of Thurgood Marshall

seems to me the way we ought to go as 
a Chamber. I hope in a bipartisan fash-
ion, not only for ourselves, but to say 
to all the visitors that come through 
this building that we will continue to 
hold high real American heroes that 
sought to keep us together, and we will 
not honor those who sought to divide 
us. 
Mr. BUTTERFIELD. Mr. Speaker, I 
have no further speakers, and I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield myself the balance of 
my time, and I will close. 
Mr. Speaker, it is great to follow our 
new colleague, Mr. MFUME. 
Because of COVID and the restric-
tions we have in getting together and 
getting to know each other like we did 
before this pandemic, I have not had a 
chance to meet you yet. Welcome to 
this institution. Thank you for your 
service here. Thank you for your serv-
ice leading the NAACP. 
I don’t know if Mr. MFUME is aware, 
but many say that the birthplace of 
the NAACP is also in Springfield, Illi-
nois, because of the 1908 race riots that 
took place in my district. 
We are trying to honor those who 
suffered during that instance in our 
Nation’s history, still centuries after 
we saw the scourge of slavery come to 
our shores. 
We still have a lot of work to do. But 
I welcome Mr. MFUME. Come to my dis-
trict and see the artifacts from those 
race riots that have been dug up and 
displayed for all to see, to be honored. 
That is what education and history is. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he 
may consume to the gentleman from 
Maryland (Mr. MFUME). 
Mr. MFUME. Mr. Speaker, I appre-
ciate the gentleman’s kind and overly 
gracious remarks. I appreciate also his 
sense of history and for what I think 
today is being displayed as a bipartisan 
effort to draw attention to and to rec-
oncile a very real problem. 
So I will be more than happy to do 
that. And Lincoln was one of my he-
roes in many respects, not just because 
he signed, as Mr. BUTTERFIELD said, an 
executive order in 1863, but that he re-
minded us of what we were supposed to 
be as a Nation. Was he flawed? Yes. Are 
we flawed? Yes. Do we increase our 
ability to grow together? The absolute 
answer is yes. So I do appreciate the 
gentleman’s comments, and I appre-
ciate him yielding. 
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. 
Speaker, I will reclaim my time. 
That is exactly why we still, as a Na-
tion, have so much to learn about each 
other. We have so much to learn as to 
why we live, and we are blessed to live 
in what I consider the greatest country 
on God’s green Earth. 
The opportunity for every American 
to do what we do, to serve in this great 
institution, is something that should 
be cherished. 
Those issues that seemingly divide us 
more in a Nation of prosperity, we need 
to educate the youth, we need to edu-
cate America, and how we can come to-
gether, not just correcting some of the 
awful, evil parts of our Nation’s his-
tory, but let’s continue to correct the 
division that exists today, not just on 
this floor, but in this country. 
And if we can stand together in this 
instance, we can surely stand together 
and make this country, at a time and 
place of civil unrest, a better place for 
every single American in this country. 
With that, Mr. Speaker, I thank 
again all of my colleagues. I respect 
their opinions, their ideas. But today is 
a day of history. Today is a day that 
we are going to band together in a bi-
partisan way. 
And I commend my good friend and 
look forward to hosting him in Spring-
field, Illinois. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge support, and I 
yield back the balance of my time. 
Mr. BUTTERFIELD. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield myself the balance of my time. I 
thank all of the speakers for their elo-
quent words today. 
Mr. DAVIS, we have talked a lot about 
President Abraham Lincoln. There is 
one thing I failed to mention, and the 
other speakers failed to mention as 
well. And that was, before the ratifica-
tion of the 13th Amendment, Lincoln 
was actually assassinated on April 14, 
as I recall, of 1865, and did not live to 
see the full ratification of the 13th 
Amendment, which was the culmina-
tion of a lot of his work. So I just 
wanted to put that into the RECORD. 
Mr. Speaker, I am pleased with the 
tone of this debate. I don’t even want 
to call it a debate. I would call it a dis-
cussion for the last few minutes. I feel 
the bipartisanship in the air, and I 
thank Mr. DAVIS so very much. It is ap-
preciated. 
History teaches us that there are 
times in our history where eras must 
be closed, and we must begin a new era 
in this great Nation. 
We need to continue to strive for a 
more perfect union, and today is a good 
example of that. 
I ask my colleagues to vote ‘‘yea’’ on 
this legislation. I ask for a unanimous 
vote. Hopefully, we can do this by voice 
vote. That is my prayer and that is my 
hope that we will show the world that 
we are united on this issue. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
Ms. LOFGREN. Mr. Speaker, I rise in sup-
port of H.R. 7573, as amended. 
H.R. 7573 directs the Joint Committee on 
the Library to remove the bust of Chief Justice 
Roger B. Taney, the author of the Dred Scott 
decision in the Old Supreme Court Chamber 
with a bust of Justice Thurgood Marshall, and 
requires the Joint Committee on the Library to 
remove statues of Charles B. Aycock, James 
P. Clarke, and John C. Calhoun, as well as a 
bust of John C. Breckinridge. H.R. 7573 would 
also amend section 1814 of the Revised Stat-
utes (2 U.S.C. 2131) to change the criteria for 
those eligible for inclusion to prohibit those 
who ‘‘served as an officer or voluntarily with 
the Confederate States of America or of the 
military forces or government of a State while 
the State was in rebellion against the United 
States.’’ The Architect of the Capitol would be 
charged with identifying those statues which 
do not meet the revised criteria and the Joint 
Committee on the Library would remove the 
statues and turn them over to the Smithsonian 
Institution or their respective states, if desired. 
As Chairperson of the House Fine Arts 
Board and the Vice Chairperson of the Joint 
Committee on the Library I am more than 
pleased to remove these symbols of cruelty 
and bigotry from the halls of the Capitol. This 
has been a long time coming, and it is long 
past time to act. 
The United States Capitol is one of the most 
visible, and most visited, symbols of liberty, 
freedom and democracy in the entire world. 
Who we choose to honor in this space is 
uniquely indicative of our values and prin-
ciples. 
Contrary to those who argue in opposition to 
this long overdue action, this action does not 
seek to erase history nor ask that we forget 
that history. We must never forget the shame-
ful scar of slavery, segregation and racism. In-
stead this is about who we honor. When we 
think about the holocaust the words ‘‘never 
forget’’ admonish us to always remember the 
millions murdered by the Nazis. But we do not 
accomplish that by erecting a statue of Adolf 
Hitler to put in a place of honor. 
Those who violently rebelled against our 
government upon the belief, as Confederate 
Vice President Alexander Stephens infamously 
said, ‘‘that the negro is not equal to the white 
man; that slavery subordination to the superior 
race is his natural and normal condition,’’ and 
those who enabled and protected the practice 
of holding human beings as property deserve 
no place of honor in the halls of our nation’s 
Capitol. Slavery is the ‘‘original sin’’ of our 
country, and its disastrous effects are felt to 
this day. 
It is long past time to remove these symbols 
of bigotry and cruelty from the halls of Con-
gress, and it is long past time to repair the 
lasting damage their hatred and racism has 
visited on the fabric of this country. The re-
moval of these symbols from the People’s 
House is a necessary step in this long-over-
due work, I urge my colleagues to join me in 
supporting H.R. 7573 and in working to right 
the wrongs of the past to better perfect the 
promises of our country. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. 
THOMPSON of Mississippi). The question 
is on the motion offered by the gen-
tleman 
from 
North 
Carolina 
(Mr. 
BUTTERFIELD) that the House suspend 
the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 7573, as 
amended. 
The question was taken. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the 
opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being 
in the affirmative, the ayes have it. 
Mr. BROOKS of Alabama. Mr. Speak-
er, on that I demand the yeas and nays. 
The yeas and nays were ordered. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to section 3 of House Resolution 
965, the yeas and nays are ordered. 
Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, fur-
ther proceedings on this motion will be 
postponed.

GOD BLESSED AMERICA WITH 
JOHN LEWIS 
(Mr. SWALWELL of California asked 
and was given permission to address 
the House for 1 minute and to revise 
and extend his remarks.) 
Mr. SWALWELL of California. Mr. 
Speaker, God blessed America and this 
Chamber when we were sent John 
Lewis. We will miss his character, his 
conviction, and his kindness; and this 
place feels a lot emptier without him. 
There is so much that will be said 
about our colleague, but I will never 
forget, just right before us in this well, 
after the country had gone through 
mass shooting after mass shooting 
after mass shooting, and we were so 
troubled about what to do next, our 
colleague told us, if we were willing to 
cause a little bit of good, necessary 
trouble, we could make a difference. 
We will miss John. He brought his ex-
perience from movements to a moment 
where his country needed him. His 
work continues and, because of that, 
the next generation will march on. 
God bless our colleague. 
f 
RECOGNIZING CAPTAIN CANDICE 
BOWEN 
(Mr. CLINE asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. CLINE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
to recognize Captain Candice Bowen 
who, this week, became the first 
woman to lead a Virginia National 
Guard infantry company. On Saturday, 
she took command of the Woodstock- 
based Bravo Company, 3rd Battalion, 
116th Infantry Regiment, 116th Infan-
try Brigade Combat Team. 
After being deployed to Qatar in 2016, 
Captain Bowen then volunteered for an 
assignment in Afghanistan, where she 
earned a Combat Action Badge. Her su-
periors say that she has ‘‘demonstrated 
the absolute ability to lead soldiers in 
close combat.’’ 
Captain Bowen had already earned 
the distinction of becoming the Vir-
ginia National Guard’s first female in-
fantry officer in 2019, and when she 
spoke after accepting her command, 
Bowen encouraged other women to fol-
low in her footsteps and join an infan-
try unit. In short, she said to jump in 
there, do it aggressively, and give it ev-
erything you’ve got. 
I wish Captain Bowen the best of 
luck in this new endeavor and know 
that those under her command in 
Bravo Company are in good hands.

HONORING THE LIFE AND LEGACY 
OF JOHN LEWIS 
(Mr. THOMPSON of California asked 
and was given permission to address 
the House for 1 minute and to revise 
and extend his remarks.) 
Mr. THOMPSON of California. Mr. 
Speaker, great women and great men 
have served in Congress, walking these 
Halls and casting votes on this very 
floor. One of the greatest was our 
friend, John Lewis. 
A civil rights icon, responsible at a 
young age for lasting progress and re-
markable courage in the face of vio-
lence and injustice. He was the con-
science of our Congress. The room 
quieted and people listened when he 
spoke. It was a true honor to serve 
with him in the House and, for me, on 
the Ways and Means Committee. 
It was surreal to walk with him over 
the Pettus Bridge in Selma on the 50th 
anniversary of Bloody Sunday. And 
constituents thank me to this day for 
inviting him to my district. 
Our great country is better because 
of John Lewis, and we should all work 
to be just a little more like John 
Lewis. 
John, we miss you. Rest in peace, my 
friend.

REMEMBERING THE LIFE AND 
LEGACY OF CHARLES EVERS 
(Mr. GUEST asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. 
GUEST. 
Mr. 
Speaker, 
this 
evening, I rise to honor the life of 
Charles Evers, who passed away earlier 
today. 
Charles and his brother, Medgar, 
dedicated their time on this Earth to 
the advancement of civil rights for all 
Americans. Following the tragic mur-
der of his brother, Charles assumed 
Medgar’s position as head of the 
NAACP in Mississippi, to continue his 
efforts to expand civil rights for Afri-
can Americans in the Magnolia State. 
In 1969, he became the first African 
American mayor elected in Mississippi 
since 
Reconstruction, 
making 
Mr. 
Evers a symbol of the civil rights that 
he and his brother fought to advance. 
He served as an adviser and mentor 
to many public officials, from local 
governments, to the President of the 
United States. 
Today, I join our Mississippi family 
in thankful prayer for his time on 
Earth, and that he returned to our 
Heavenly Father having accomplished 
his goal of creating a better nation for 
all people. 
Please join me in a moment of si-
lence as we remember his service to 
our State and our Nation.

MEMORIALIZING THE HONORABLE 
JOHN LEWIS 
(Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois 
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend his remarks.) 
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. 
Speaker, I rise today in honor of our 
friend and colleague, John Lewis. 
John will be remembered as one of 
the pioneers of the civil rights move-
ment, and his example of courage will 
be talked about for generations to 
come. 
John Lewis was loved on both sides 
of the aisle. Even when we disagreed, 
John never failed to be kind and profes-
sional. 
John loved this country and never 
stopped his pursuit of a perfect union 
for all Americans. Even in the last few 
weeks of his battle with cancer, John 
was still partaking in nonviolent activ-
ism and advocating for equal justice. 
When I was a freshman here in Con-
gress, I was touring the Smithsonian 
with my sons and daughter. One of my 
sons asked who the bleeding man in the 
picture was. I told him it was a photo 
of John Lewis during the civil rights 
movement and that I now have the 
privilege of serving with him in Con-
gress. I am lucky to have been able to 
call John Lewis a colleague and a 
friend. 
His passing is a loss for American de-
mocracy and advocacy. My wife, Shan-
non, and I send our deepest condolences 
to John’s family, friends, and staff. He 
will truly be missed. The House will 
miss John Lewis greatly.

FUNDING NEVADA’S PRECIOUS 
PUBLIC LANDS 
(Mrs. LEE of Nevada asked and was 
given permission to address the House

her remarks.) 
Mrs. LEE of Nevada. Mr. Speaker, on 
behalf of Nevada’s Third District, I rise 
today in support of the Great American 
Outdoors Act. This bill, which I co-
sponsored, will finally secure full, dedi-
cated funding for the Land and Water 
Conservation Fund. 
This fund helps to conserve some of 
southern Nevada’s most precious public 
lands, like Red Rock Canyon, Sloan 
Canyon, and Lake Mead. 
Coming together on such a vital issue 
is a reminder that Congress has the

is no issue more universal to all Ameri-
cans and all people than protecting our 
planet. We can’t keep kicking this can 
down the road. This is the time to fully 
fund the Land and Water Conservation 
Fund. 
In closing, my time was short with 
Congressman John Lewis, but I will 
forever be impacted and am eternally 
grateful for his leadership.

OPENING OUR SCHOOLS 
(Mr. MURPHY of North Carolina 
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute.) 
Mr. MURPHY of North Carolina. Mr. 
Speaker, as August approaches, reopen-
ing schools is now at the forefront of 
the American agenda. 
The American Academy of Pediatrics 
strongly advocates that we should 
start with a goal of having students 
back physically in the classroom. As 
an experienced physician of more than 
30 years, I concur with the AAP, and I 
believe that the science and the data 
point toward reopening our schools in 
America. 
This is why I introduced the Open 
Schools Responsibly Act yesterday, 
which provides liability protection to 
schools that adhere to CDC and State 
guidelines. As we want to open schools 
again, then educational administrators 
need to have the confidence that they 
will not face the brunt of frivolous law-
suits. 
Obviously, schools that reopen with-
out taking the proper precautions 
should be held accountable, and this 
legislation will still ensure that is the 
case. We want to protect everyone, 
from exceedingly low-risk students up 
to our higher-risk older teachers. 
We simply cannot allow our children, 
especially our higher-at-risk children, 
to fall further behind in their edu-
cation. So, it is Congress’ duty to pass 
liability protection to let our kids get 
back to school and get back on track.

KEEPING KLAMATH RIVER 
RENEWABLE ENERGY 
(Mr. LAMALFA asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. LAMALFA. Mr. Speaker, I rise to 
commend the Federal Energy Regu-
latory Commission for the decision the 
other day to not accept the proposal by 
an entity called the Klamath River Re-
newal Corporation, which seeks to re-
move 
four 
very 
important 
hydro-
electric dams on the Klamath River in 
northern California and southern Or-
egon. 
These dams produce enough renew-
able hydroelectric power to power 
70,000 homes. The problem with renew-
ing them, thinking it is going to help 
the fish population, is that it would un-
leash at least 20 million cubic yards of 
silt with who knows what all is in 
there—heavy metals, et cetera—that 
will then be unleashed upon the rest of 
the river all the way out to the ocean. 
It takes only 3 years to wipe out a 
salmon population, and it will take 
much longer for the silt to dissipate in 
the river. 
So much more needs to be done to ex-
plore this situation. I advocate that we 
allow these dams to continue to oper-
ate and provide power to our grid that 
indeed is renewable and helps meet the 
renewable portfolio standard for Cali-
fornia and not just tear them out at 
unknown costs exceeding $450 million.

REMEMBERING THE LIFE OF 
CONGRESSMAN JOHN LEWIS 
(Mr. NEWHOUSE asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Mr. NEWHOUSE. Mr. Speaker, today, 
I rise with a heavy heart to honor the 
life of the distinguished Congressman 
from Georgia’s Fifth District, John 
Lewis. 
Few members of this body have had 
such a profound impact on the fabric of 
our Nation as John Lewis. He was a 
man of honor, a freedom fighter, and 
one of the truly great leaders of the 
civil rights movement. 
From the Edmund Pettus Bridge in 
Selma, Alabama, where he marched 
with the Reverend Dr. Martin Luther 
King, Jr., to demand an end to segrega-
tion to the Halls of the Congress of the 
United States of America where he du-
tifully and faithfully served his con-
stituents, Representative Lewis spent a 
lifetime showing Americans what it 
means to stand up for what is right, 
even at great personal cost. 
He understood something that is all 
too often forgotten: that the work of 
creating a more perfect union and the 
pursuit of liberty and justice for all is 
never finished, but it is an ongoing and 
often frustrating process. Nevertheless, 
he demonstrated both to the Members 
of this body and to the American peo-
ple the value of compassion, dedica-
tion, and civility. 
The world is a better place because of 
John, and it was an honor to serve 
alongside him in Congress. May he rest 
in peace, and may we always honor his 
example. 
f 
PAYING TRIBUTE TO 
CONGRESSMAN JOHN LEWIS 
(Mr. GUTHRIE asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. GUTHRIE. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to honor the life of our col-
league, Congressman John Lewis. 
Growing up and learning about Mr. 
Lewis’ contributions to our country, I 
never thought I would one day have the 
honor of serving alongside him in Con-
gress or the honor of calling him my 
friend. 
I will always remember the time I 
think several of us had the opportunity 
to watch the movie ‘‘Selma’’ with him. 
It was amazing to watch everything I 
had learned about in history class with 
someone who had experienced it. After 
the movie, as we were all kind of feel-
ing empty in our stomachs and just the 
feeling from seeing the movie, I walked 
up to Mr. Lewis, and I asked him: What 
is it like to have your life portrayed 
upon the screen such as that? 
If you remember, the actor resembled 
him when he was younger. Mr. Lewis 
looked at me and he said: All I was 
thinking is that I had a lot of hair back 
then. 
That was Mr. Lewis for you, a giant 
in our history, but unfailingly humble 
and kind. I am grateful I had the op-
portunity to know him, and I will miss 
him dearly.

HONORING THE LIFE AND LEGACY 
OF CONGRESSMAN JOHN LEWIS 
(Mr. KATKO asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. KATKO. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to honor the life and legacy of 
Congressman John Lewis. 
Our Nation mourns his loss. An icon 
of the civil rights movement, John 
Lewis dedicated his life to fighting for 
equality. He was an American hero who 
never wavered in his pursuit to make 
our country a more fair and just place. 
During my first term in Congress, I 
met John Lewis when we sat near each 
other at the President’s State of the 
Union Address my first time. We be-
came friends after that and often spoke 
on the House floor and in his office. 
While we served on different sides of 
the aisle, he was always willing to hear 
and consider the perspectives of others. 
It was an absolute honor to serve 
alongside him in Congress. John will 
forever be remembered for his strong 
leadership, his commitment to peaceful 
action, and the tremendous sacrifices 
he made to enact change. 
I wish the family, loved ones, and all 
who knew and admired him peace dur-
ing this difficult time.

CONTINUATION OF THE NATIONAL

The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr.

and, together with the accompanying 
papers, referred to the Committee on 
Foreign Affairs and ordered to be print-

To the Congress of the United States: 
Section 202(d) of the National Emer-
gencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)) provides 
for the automatic termination of a na-

the Federal Register and transmits to 
the Congress a notice stating that the 
emergency is to continue in effect be-
yond the anniversary date. In accord-
ance with this provision, I have sent to 
the Federal Register for publication the 
enclosed notice stating that the na-
tional 
emergency 
with 
respect 
to 
transnational criminal organizations 
declared in Executive Order 13581 of 
July 24, 2011, is to continue in effect be-
yond July 24, 2020. 
The 
activities 
of 
significant 
transnational criminal organizations 
have reached such scope and gravity 
that they threaten the stability of 
international political and economic 
systems. 
Such organizations are becoming in-
creasingly sophisticated and dangerous 
to the United States; they are increas-
ingly entrenched in the operations of 
foreign governments and the inter-
national 
financial 
system, 
thereby 
weakening democratic institutions, de-
grading the rule of law, and under-
mining economic markets. These orga-
nizations facilitate and aggravate vio-
lent civil conflicts and increasingly fa-
cilitate the activities of other dan-
gerous persons. 
The 
activities 
of 
significant 
transnational criminal organizations 
continue to pose an unusual and ex-
traordinary threat to the national se-
curity, foreign policy, and economy of 
the United States. For these reasons, I 
have determined that it is necessary to 
continue the national emergency de-
clared in Executive Order 13581 with re-
spect to transnational criminal organi-
zations.

HONORING CONGRESSMAN JOHN 
LEWIS 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under 
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 3, 2019, the gentlewoman from 
California (Ms. BASS) is recognized for 
60 minutes as the designee of the ma-
jority leader. 
Ms. BASS. Mr. Speaker, it is with 
great honor that I rise today to co-
anchor the Congressional Black Caucus 
Special Order hour. For the next 60 
minutes, we have a chance to commu-
nicate to the American people our 
great love for an American hero, Rep-
resentative John Lewis. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentle-
woman from the great State of Cali-
fornia (Ms. PELOSI), my colleague and 
the honorable Speaker from the city of 
San Francisco. 
Ms. PELOSI. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentlewoman for yielding and ap-
preciate her calling us together for this 
Special Order for a very special person. 
This big picture of John Lewis was 
just put up here. ‘‘Rest in Power,’’ it 
says. You can’t see from the TV, but 
over here in the front row is a big bou-
quet of white flowers. It is in a place 
where John usually sat in the front row 
of a section that many of the Members 
of the Congressional Black Caucus held 
fort, conspired sometimes, plotted, and 
made progress for the American people. 
It is appropriate that we have those 
flowers there where John sat for so 
many years. 
Jon Meacham, who is writing a book 
on John Lewis, told us yesterday on a 
Caucus call that when John was born, 
he was born into a garden. He loved to 
be in the garden. He loved to be with 
the chicks, as we know, the little 
chickens, and he loved to see things 
grow. He loved to see things grow. 
He lived his life in that way. He loved 
to see progress grow. He loved to see 
love and peace grow. He loved to see 
ideas grow, and he loved to see a more 
perfect Union grow. 
Many of our colleagues will have 
many things to say this evening, and 
because it is a Special Order, I don’t 
have my usual 1 minute, which is end-
less, so I will be briefer and save some 
remarks for another time. But here is 
what I will say. 
John has always been about non-
violence. That was his spirit in every-
thing that he did. He was respectful of 
other views and respectful of other peo-
ple. In the spirit of nonviolence, Rev-
erend Lawson taught that to him, to 
Dr. King, and the rest, and much of it 
was in the spirit of Mahatma Gandhi 
and much of the nonviolence that he 
put forth. 
In Sanskrit, Mahatma Gandhi’s lan-
guage, the word for nonviolence is 
‘‘satyagraha.’’ That word means two 
things: Nonviolence, and insistence on 
the truth. 
And John Lewis, nonviolently, al-
ways insisted on the truth. Whether it 
was a lunch counter, the truth of 
equality, whether it was upholding the 
Constitution, the truth of our Found-
ers, in everything that he did, it was 
about truth and peace and love. 
Mr. Speaker, I include in the RECORD 
my statement, because, again, I am not 
used to not having endless time as the 
Speaker of the House, and I do know 
that our colleagues have a great deal 
to say. 
I will say one more thing: At the end 
of his life, end of his time in Wash-
ington, D.C., right before he was pre-
paring to go back to Atlanta, just a 
couple of weeks ago, in the middle of 
the night, he decided—early in the 
morning, 4 a.m.—that he was going to 
go, in the morning, to Black Lives 
Matter on the street. 
So one of the last official or public 
photos that we have of John Lewis is 
with the Mayor of Washington, D.C., 
and then alone, standing on that beau-
tiful tapestry, ‘‘Black Lives Matter,’’ 
the connection from John, the boy 
from Troy, to Black Lives Matter, the 
future of a movement of which he was 
so much a part. 
May he rest in power. May he rest in 
peace. 
Ms. BASS. Mr. Speaker, the Nation 
lost an icon; the House lost its most re-
spected Member; and the Congressional 
Black Caucus lost the most senior 
member of our family. 
The Congressional Black Caucus is 
known as the conscience of the Con-
gress, but John Lewis was known as 
the conscience of our Congress. One of 
the greatest honors of serving in Con-
gress was that I had the possibility of 
serving with him. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman 
from the State of South Carolina (Mr. 
CLYBURN), the majority whip. 
Mr. CLYBURN. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentlewoman for yielding me the 
time. 
Mr. Speaker, I cringe often when I 
hear people talk about the 1960s as the 
civil rights movement. I always put an 
‘‘S’’ on that. 
The Stono Rebellion was in 1739. It 
was a civil rights movement. 
Denmark Vesey’s insurrection was in 
1822. It was a civil rights movement. 
The Niagara Movement that led to 
the creation of the NAACP more than 
100 years ago was a civil rights move-
ment. 
John Lewis and I met in October 1960 
at a civil rights movement. For as long 
as there are people held in suppression, 
there will always be a movement for 
civil rights. However, in any movement 
there will be a few—sometimes only 
one—that 
rise 
head 
and 
shoulders 
above all others, and so it was with my 
good friend, John Robert Lewis. 
When we met the weekend of October 
13, 14, 15, 1960, on the campus of More-
house College, there was a little bit of 
an insurrection taking place. We, who 
were college students, felt that we 
knew how best to do things. We were 
not listening to Martin Luther King, 
Jr., and a few others, and so we asked 
King to meet with us. And he did. 
We went into the meeting around 10 
o’clock in the evening. We did not walk 
out of that room until 4 o’clock the 
next morning. I came out of that room 
having 
had 
a 
Saul-to-Paul 
trans-
formation. I have never been the same 
since. 
But listening to King’s plea for non-
violence, I decided, along with most 
others, to accept nonviolence as a tac-
tic. But not John Lewis. He internal-
ized. It became his way of life. 
After going through a few issues of 
the 1960s, John got elected president of 
SNCC in 1963 and was summarily de-
throned in 1966. But John then joined 
the 
effort, 
the 
Voter 
Education 
Project, where he directed. That was 
sponsored by the Southern Regional 
Council. And as he served as the direc-
tor of the Voter Education Project in 
Atlanta, I became the chair of the 
Voter Education Project in Charleston, 
South Carolina, and we continued that 
relationship. 
He got married to a librarian, I got 
married to a librarian—though I did so 
before he did—and they became fast 
friends. Lillian and Emily became fast 
friends. 
I will never, ever get John Robert 
Lewis out of my system, because he

succeeded where I failed. It was a tac-
tic for me. It was a way of life for John 
Lewis. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Ms. BASS. Mr. Speaker, I ask unani-
mous consent that all Members may 
have 5 legislative days in which to re-
vise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on the sub-
ject of this Special Order. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from California? 
There was no objection. 
Ms. BASS. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the 
gentlewoman from the District of Co-
lumbia (Ms. NORTON), the state of the 
District of Columbia. 
Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the 
gentlewoman 
from 
California, 
KAREN BASS, for leading this Special 
Order to our good colleague and friend, 
John Lewis. 
John and I were elected to the House 
of Representatives about the same 
time. Actually, he was elected a couple 
years before I was. But we were col-
leagues before either of us could have 
hoped to become Members of Congress. 
We were kids together in the Student 
Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, 
the youth arm of the Southern Civil 
Rights Movement. 
The difference between John and me 
is I was in law school so I went in the 
summer, and John was a full-time 
member, who left school in order to 
join SNCC. SNCC came out of lunch 
counter sit-ins. Ella Baker called us all 
together because it was clear that the 
Civil Rights Movement was developing 
a youth arm. And Ella Baker, the great 
elder of the Civil Rights Movement, de-
cided all of us really should become an 
organization. 
John was not the first head of SNCC. 
Marion Barry was, because he was a lot 
more political than John, and he is re-
membered more today for his politics 
than for his civil rights acumen. When 
John was elected chair of SNCC, there 
was nothing political about it. His 
qualification was not that he was the 
strongest. His qualification was that he 
was the bravest. 
It is almost impossible to describe 
the risks John took in the more than 40 
times he was arrested, because today, 
we are so used to civil disobedience. 
People right now are lying down on 
Pennsylvania Avenue after the George 
Floyd killing. I really want to call to 
your attention what it meant when 
John led young people to be arrested. 
Everybody has seen the film of his 
being knocked down as he marched in 
the front of the line; he had a concus-
sion as a result of that. He never knew, 
as he led these marches, whether he 
would come out alive. 
Let me tell you about these marches 
when SNCC would kneel down and as-
sume other nonviolent postures. On the 
other side, were not counter-dem-
onstrators. On the other side were not 
other people who were confronting us 
nonviolently. On the other side were 
the police leading white mobs. They 
were befuddled by the tactics of SNCC 
and the Civil Rights Movement. Be-
cause when you kneel down and are 
nonviolent, they didn’t quite know 
what to do with you or about you. 
John, of course, will always be re-
membered as a Member of the House of 
Representatives, but as I close, I must 
say, it will be difficult, even for John 
to have done more in the House than 
he did in the Civil Rights Movement, to 
do more in Congress than he did for his 
country. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentle-
woman for yielding. 
Ms. BASS. Mr. Speaker, his legacy to 
our country is that he devoted his life 
to fighting for justice and being a 
moral compass to our Nation. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman 
from the great State of Virginia (Mr. 
SCOTT). 
Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, 
I thank the gentlewoman for yielding. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today for a sol-
emn occasion. Tonight we honor our 
friend, brother, colleague, the con-
science of the Congress, a true Amer-
ican icon: Congressman John Lewis. 
Words cannot convey the loss to this 
body as well as to the Nation, but very 
few can claim to have altered the 
course of American history the way 
that John did. He was a guiding light 
to all of us and was a leader trying to 
make America a more perfect Union. 
His steadfast moral leadership will be 
deeply missed, particularly at this 
complex time in our history. 
Those of us here today are standing 
on his shoulders. His historic life and 
legacy will undoubtedly live on, but we 
must be sure to continue his life’s 
work, particularly when it comes to 
voting rights and restoring the Voting 
Rights Act. We must make some ‘‘good 
trouble’’ to honor his enormous legacy. 
Ms. BASS. Mr. Speaker, Congress-
man John Lewis spent his life fighting 
racism and injustice wherever he con-
fronted it, from Boy Scout sit-ins and 
other protests in the streets to cham-
pioning bold, progressive policies in 
Congress, including the Voting Rights 
Act. 
b 1845 
Ms. BASS. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the 
gentleman from Illinois (Mr. DANNY K. 
DAVIS). 
Mr. DANNY K. DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. 
Speaker, 
To every man there is a way, a ways, and a 
way, 
And the high souls take the high way, 
And the low souls take the low. 
While all the rest on the misty flats drift to 
and fro. 
But to every man there is a way, a ways, and 
a way, 
And each man decideth which way his soul 
shall go. 
John Lewis always took the high 
road, always giving of himself in such a 
way that you knew that he was gra-
cious and kind. 
John had faith. 
Like John, I grew up in rural Amer-
ica, went to a one-room school, never 
had a new schoolbook. But John had 
the faith of a mustard seed and said: If 
you want to move a mountain, just say 
to the mountain be moved. And if it 
wouldn’t, then you get you some dyna-
mite, nitroglycerin, TNT, and blow 
that sucker down. 
That was John Lewis. May he rest in 
peace. 
Ms. BASS. Now that he is no longer 
with us, we have to live up to his leg-
acy and protect the right to vote for all 
Americans. As we continue to face 
challenges due to the coronavirus and 
issues of systemic racism, we must pro-
tect our democracy and elections, even 
in the midst of adversity. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentle-
woman from Texas (Ms. JACKSON LEE). 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, we 
are all heartbroken. We all are speech-
less. We all are committed to John 
Robert Lewis’ beloved community. 
Each of us have been touched with-
out ceasing for the spirit he led us in 
acknowledging, even in anger, that 
there was the beloved community. 
He loved his wife and his family and 
his extended brothers and sisters, all 
the way from Alabama to Georgia. I 
am reminded of his ability to love Dr. 
Martin Luther King. It is a testament 
of a man that is able to extend love and 
not to show envy but to learn and to 
seek knowledge. John did that, which 
allowed him to carry that all the way 
to the fights of today. 
Dr. King said: ‘‘John Robert Lewis, 
are you the boy from Troy?’’ He loved 
to tell that story. He loved to tell that 
he preached to the chickens, but his 
voices were heard by kings and queens. 
John Robert Lewis, a saint walking 
on Earth. 
I am reminded of our days in front of 
the South African Embassy, arrested, 
against genocide, or fighting against 
the children in cages. John never 
stopped his fight. 
And so I come today to honor him in 
this brief moment that we have, to be 
able to say, Isn’t it good that a saintly 
man walked on this Earth and re-
minded us of the beloved community? 
I am very glad to say that I knew, 
and the world knows John Robert 
Lewis, ‘‘the boy from Troy.’’ 
Mr. Speaker, as a senior member of this 
body and the Committee on the Judiciary, as 
a colleague of a great and beloved man, and 
as a member of a generation that directly ben-
efited from and was inspired by his work in the 
Civil Rights Movement, I am proud but heart- 
broken to participate in this tribute to an Amer-
ican original, our friend and colleague, the late 
John Robert Lewis who died last Friday, July 
17, 2020, in Atlanta, Georgia at the age of 80 
years old. 
But what amazing things my friend John 
bore witness to in those eight decades. 
John Robert Lewis was a lifelong warrior for 
a more just, equitable, fairer, and better Amer-
ica, one of the Original Big Six, and a giant of 
the Civil Rights Movement. 
John Lewis was one of the original Freedom 
Riders who challenged segregated interstate 
travel in the South in 1961. 
He was a founder and early leader of the 
Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, 
which coordinated lunch-counter sit-ins.

He helped organize and was the last sur-
viving person who addressed the multitude at 
the March on Washington, where Dr. King de-
livered his immortal ‘‘I Have A Dream’’ speech 
on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial. 
John Robert Lewis was born on February 
21, 1940, the third of 10 children, to Eddie and 
Willie Mae (Carter) Lewis near the town of 
Troy on a sharecropping farm owned by a 
white man. 
After his parents bought their own farm— 
110 acres for $300—John shared in the farm 
work, leaving school at harvest time to pick 
cotton, peanuts and corn. 
Their house had no plumbing or electricity. 
In the outhouse, they used the pages of an 
old Sears catalog as toilet paper, that seems 
too much to bear but John was empowered by 
his history. 
His family called him ‘‘Preacher,’’ and be-
coming one seemed to be his destiny. 
John often said he drew inspiration by lis-
tening to a young minister named Martin Lu-
ther King on the radio and reading about the 
1955 through 56 Montgomery bus boycott. 
John Lewis met Dr. King in Montgomery, 
Alabama in 1958, who was touched by a letter 
John had written him and sent him a round- 
trip bus ticket to visit. 
When John arrived at the Dexter Avenue 
Baptist Church for his appointment, Dr. King 
greeted him thusly: ‘‘Are you the boy from 
Troy? Are you John Lewis?’’ 
John said, ‘‘I am John Robert Lewis, giving 
his whole name. 
But Dr. King henceforth would affectionately 
call our beloved John, ‘‘the boy from Troy’’. 
But in 2011, at a White House ceremony, 
President Barack Obama awarded John Lewis 
the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the na-
tion’s highest civilian honor, and said this 
about the boy from Troy: ‘‘Generations from 
now, when parents teach their children what is 
meant by courage, the story of John Lewis will 
come to mind; an American who knew that 
change could not wait for some other person 
or some other time; whose life is a lesson in 
the fierce urgency of now.’’ 
The first time John Lewis was arrested was 
in February 1960, when he and other students 
demanded 
service 
at 
whites-only 
lunch 
counters in Nashville, the first prolonged battle 
of the movement that evolved into the Student 
Nonviolent Coordinating Committee. 
John’s advocacy was fierce and joyful, as 
embodied in his common refrain to involve 
oneself in the actions and passions of one’s 
time ‘‘to get in the way, make necessary trou-
ble.’’ 
Less than two years after that August 1963 
day, in the shadow of the Lincoln Memorial, in 
March 1965, John led over 600 foot soldiers 
across the Edmund Pettus Bridge, in Selma, 
Alabama, in a march demanding the right to 
vote. John’s protest against injustice was met 
with violence by Alabama State Troopers. 
He was beaten and his skull left bloodied, 
the horror left bare for a nation to see on tele-
vision. 
That incident, immediately known and for-
ever remembered as Bloody Sunday, led to 
the passage and enactment of the Voting 
Rights Act of 1965. 
It was my personal honor to accompany 
John on countless pilgrimages to the Edmund 
Pettus Bridge to remember and acknowledge 
those common persons with common dreams 
and uncommon courage and love for the 
promise of the country. 
In 1986, John Lewis was elected to the 
United States House of Representatives from 
Georgia’s 5th District and served in that role 
until earlier the evening when the sun set on 
his heroic and extraordinary life. 
John was the conscience of the Congress, 
widely beloved and revered on both sides of 
the aisle and the Capitol. 
His moral authority was colossal because 
he had seen the worst of us but he always ap-
pealed to the best of us and never ceased to 
inspire us to strive to create the beloved com-
munity. 
It is no exaggeration to say he was a man, 
the likes of which we shall not see again. 
As news of John’s passing reverberates 
across the United States and around the 
world, John would want us to reflect not on his 
death, but his life and the unfinished nec-
essary work ahead of us. 
John never took his eyes off the prize and 
to his last days, continued to march and stand 
in solidarity with those protesting injustice and 
inequality. 
I remember getting arrested with John, Con-
gressman MCGOVERN, former colleagues Jim 
Moran of Virginia and John Olver of Massa-
chusetts, and our late colleague Tom Lantos, 
for protesting the genocide in Darfur at the 
Embassy of Sudan on April 28, 2006. 
John Lewis led us in the sit-down dem-
onstration on the House floor to protest the 
Republican Congress’ refusal to take up gun 
violence prevention legislation in the face of 
the tragic mass shootings that plague our 
country. 
And in his final act of civic engagement and 
civil disobedience, John Lewis stood in the 
middle of Black Lives Matter Plaza showing 
solidarity and the continuity with the now glob-
al movement fighting galvanized by the horrific 
murder of George Floyd to peacefully protest 
for justice and equal treatment in the criminal 
justice system. 
Mr. Speaker, John Lewis was among the 
finest Americans this country ever produced. 
He lived a consequential life and his legacy 
is all around us, in the realization of talent and 
opportunity of millions of persons who walked 
through the doors of progress that John Lewis 
helped open. 
I hope it is comfort to John’s family and 
loved ones, that people the world over are 
mourning his death but celebrating his life. 
A fitting and proper means of paying tribute 
to John Lewis’s extraordinary life is for the 
Senate to immediately take up and pass the 
John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act, 
landmark legislation to protect the precious 
right to vote for all persons and to ensure that 
our democracy has the tools needed to remain 
strong. 
I ask the House to observe a moment of si-
lence in memory and thanks of John Robert 
Lewis, the boy from Troy, who became a lead-
er who helped change the world. 
Ms. BASS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from New 
York (Mr. MEEKS). 
Mr. MEEKS. Mr. Speaker, John Rob-
ert Lewis was short in height, yet he 
was a giant. John Robert Lewis was a 
humble man but fierce for justice. 
John Robert Lewis talked softly, but 
roared like a lion when it was time to 
fight for freedom, justice, and equality 
for all humankind. He said there was 
one race—the human race. 
He is an individual that compelled a 
Nation to change, to make it better. 
His voice will echo in this Chamber for-
ever. 
It was my honor and pleasure for 22 
years to serve with the Honorable John 
Robert Lewis. 
May he rest in peace and rise in 
power. 
Ms. BASS. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the 
gentleman from Georgia (Mr. David 
Scott). 
Mr. DAVID SCOTT of Georgia. Mr. 
Speaker, John Lewis’ mother and his 
grandmother named him John after 
John the Apostle, the disciple, the 
Scripture says, whom Jesus loved, 
John the Beloved. 
And John Lewis dedicated his life to 
building the beloved community. 
And one more thing. John Lewis, 
being named after John, Jesus’ Apos-
tle, it must be noted that the Apostle 
John was the youngest of the disciples. 
John Lewis was the youngest of our 
civil rights leaders who spoke at the 
momentous March on Washington. 
God bless John Lewis, and we thank 
God for sending him our way. 
Ms. BASS. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the 
gentleman from Texas (Mr. GREEN). 
Mr. GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I 
rise to say thank you to a friend and a 
great warrior. 
I thank you, dear brother, for being 
the sermon you preached. You walked 
your talk. It is said that a great person 
will always rise to the occasion, but it 
is also said that the greater person 
makes the occasion. 
He was an occasion-maker, and he 
rose to the occasion on the Edmond 
Pettus Bridge. And for this, many of us 
who are here tonight are here because 
he marched into brutality. 
So tonight, I thank you, dear broth-
er, for being able to withstand what 
many of us could not and would not. I 
rise to just say thank you and to let 
you know that we will never forget 
you, and we will always make it per-
spicuously clear that we are here be-
cause you were there. 
Ms. BASS. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the 
gentlewoman from New York (Ms. 
CLARKE). 
Ms. CLARKE of New York. Mr. 
Speaker, today I rise to honor a great 
man, Representative John Lewis. 
This past Friday, July 17, our coun-
try lost one of its greatest heroes, a 
true patriot, who literally put his life 
on the line in the pursuit of justice and 
fairness in our society. 
The Honorable John Lewis was a pe-
nultimate hero who embodied the 
struggle for human rights and dignity. 
He was a fierce civil rights warrior, 
who refused to abide by the Jim Crow 
laws of the South. He embodied what it 
means to be a public servant, putting 
his life on the line and the people above 
his own self-interests. 
I am so honored and privileged to 
have served with John Robert Lewis— 
John Robert Lewis, who was a dancer, 
a man who loved to have fun but was 
convicted for the right to vote, con-
victed as an activist for civil rights and 
civil liberties.

And I will forever hold dear the mo-
ment that we landed in Ghana to-
gether, invited by the President of 
Ghana for the Year of Return, and to 
see the wonderment in his eyes of vis-
iting a space where it all began for all 
of us 401 years ago. 
May he rest in peace and rise in 
power. The Honorable John Lewis will 
never be forgotten. We all hold onto his 
legacy. 
Ms. BASS. To honor Mr. Lewis, the 
first thing we need to do is to pass leg-
islation restoring the Voting Rights 
Act and get it signed. We know the 
credibility of our elections has already 
shown early signs of concern during 
several State primaries and voter sup-
pression cases, coupled with the fact 
that people are going to have to vote in 
dangerous conditions, cannot be ig-
nored. I know that if Mr. Lewis was 
still with us, he would be leading that 
fight. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman 
from Georgia (Mr. JOHNSON). 
Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, much has been said about my 
friend, 
teacher, 
and mentor, John 
Lewis. 
He was a family man, married to Lil-
lian for 44 years, and to that union bore 
a son, John-Miles, who is with us 
today. 
Along with John Lewis’ brothers and 
sisters, he was number three of ten. He 
has a large extended family. And that 
family entrusted John to the world. 
And for 33 years, he was our colleague. 
For 14 years, he was mine. 
I just want to say to the family that 
we here in Congress feel your pain. We 
appreciate your sacrifice in allowing 
John to do what he did for the world 
and for Congress. I want you to know 
that we stand with you, we feel your 
pain, and we will never forget your 
dear brother, uncle, cousin, whoever he 
was to you. We will never forget him. 
We know that he loved you. 
He would depart this place to go to 
the family reunion during the summer 
down in Alabama where the family still 
owned hundreds of acres of land that 
they 
farmed 
even 
when 
his 
two 
sharecropping parents gave birth to 
John. And so he was a family man. 
Thank you, family, for entrusting him 
to us. 
Ms. BASS. Mr. Speaker, I yield back 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. LARSON of Connecticut. Mr. Speaker, 
there are no words to describe the pain that 
many Americans are feeling right now as we 
grapple with the loss of our conscience, our 
friend, our inspirational leader, John Lewis. 
I am heartbroken. I am honored and hum-
bled to have served alongside him, to have 
had him take my children, as he has done for 
so many Americans in the Faith and Politics 
movement through a historic march in Selma, 
across the Edmund Pettus Bridge. 
During one of those trips I was lucky 
enough to have my daughter Laura and son 
Ray join me. Because of school obligations, 
they had to leave early and were going to 
miss the march across the Edmund Pettus 
Bridge. John wasn’t about to let that happen. 
He took the three of us in his car with him 
and we drove through Selma, as he told them 
what it was like and what he went through. 
They were both entranced by him and the 
story he was telling that was filled with graphic 
violence of what they endured as they fought 
for equal rights. 
At the end of it, my daughter Laura, who 
was about 14 years old at the time, struck by 
what he had just told her, rather innocently 
asked him, ‘‘Mr. Lewis, did you ever have 
fun?’’ 
There was a pregnant pause and then John 
got the biggest smile on his face. He told us 
that yes, they did. ‘‘And in fact, at night, we’d 
pitch our tents and sit around campfires and 
we’d sing and dance,’’ he said. His smile then 
got broader as he remembered. ‘‘I can still see 
Andy Young doing the jitterbug in his cover-
alls. And he could dance . . . he could 
dance.’’ 
Despite everything John endured, they were 
still young and full of life. 
One of the most inspiring memories I have 
of John Lewis is from 2009, when we were 
fighting to pass the Affordable Care Act. The 
day before we passed the bill, hateful 
protestors spewed racial slurs and spit on 
John Lewis, ANDRE´ CARSON, and EMMANUEL 
CLEAVER. Tensions were high after that. The 
next day at Caucus, I asked John to speak. 
He brought the Caucus to its feet, evoking the 
Civil Rights movement. 
He said: ‘‘Pay no attention to what went on 
yesterday. We have to learn, as we did in the 
Civil Rights Movement, to look past this and 
keep our eyes on the prize. So, I ask you to 
stay calm and stay together.’’ As he was walk-
ing away from the mic, he paused, and then 
he stepped back up and said, ‘‘Forty-five 
years ago, I walked across the Edmund Pettus 
bridge arm in arm with fellow citizens who be-
lieved strongly in Civil Rights. We faced far 
more difficult crowds than we are facing out 
here today. Let’s lock arms and go across the 
street and pass this bill.’’ And we did. We 
marched across the street, through the pro-
testers and passed the bill. 
In 2016, I worked with John to take another 
stand. This time, we were calling for a vote on 
the House floor on a bill to address the epi-
demic of gun violence in America. After the 
2012 shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary, the 
House didn’t take a single vote to address gun 
violence, until Democrats took the majority in 
2019. In 2016, after the shooting at Pulse 
Nightclub in Orlando, John and the rest of the 
Democratic Caucus had had enough. He 
called on the Caucus to join him in causing 
some ’good trouble’. With that, we held a sit- 
in on the House floor demanding justice. 
Most recently, we worked together to 
strengthen Social Security. Social Security is 
our nation’s number one anti-poverty program 
and is a lifeline for millions. It needs to be 
strengthened so it’s there for future genera-
tions too. Last summer we stood together out-
side the Capitol highlighting how important 
these benefits are for seniors, especially for 
Black seniors. He said: 
‘I grew up in rural Alabama, 50 miles from 
Montgomery, outside a little town called Troy, 
and I remember how seniors lived before they 
had Social Security. Most of the seniors in my 
district in Georgia depend on Social Security 
for the majority of their income. Without it al-
most half of Black and Latino seniors in this 
country would be living in poverty. That’s not 
right, that’s not fair, and it’s not just. Social 
Security is more than a right, it is a promise. 
A promise people paid into to secure their fu-
ture. We can do better, we can do much bet-
ter.’ 
This year, even when battling cancer, he 
continued this fight. 
I’ve been proud to call John Lewis a friend 
over my time in Congress. In 2016, I was hon-
ored to work with the Bipartisan Policy Center 
and Representative TOM COLE to establish the 
Congressional Patriot Award. John Lewis and 
Sam Johnson, who passed away earlier this 
year, were the first recipients. They were both 
authentic heroes. One held in captivity by the 
VietCong and tortured and nearly beaten to 
death; the other held captive by the Alabama 
Police, clubbed and beaten. They both had a 
genuine focus on doing for others, not them-
selves. They were humble, gracious, and kind, 
yet warriors for their cause. 
John Lewis has forever changed our coun-
try. His legacy will live on in the policies and 
lives he changed. We must continue to follow 
his lead and cause good trouble. 
Mr. HILL of Arkansas. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to honor the heroic life of Congressman 
John Robert Lewis and his historic contribution 
to the nation we know and love today. 
In September 1957, the Little Rock Nine 
walked into history as they walked up the front 
steps of Central High School. It was a pivotal 
moment in history. 
John said this moment inspired him in his 
own leadership as an active member of the 
Civil Rights Movement. 
I had the pleasure of calling John a friend, 
as did many of my colleagues, and will cherish 
the time we had together in the people’s 
House. 
John joining me as legislative cosponsors to 
expand the Little Rock Central High National 
Park boundary is a highlight of my congres-
sional service. 
John will truly be missed, but long remem-
bered. As the USNS John Lewis sets sail as 
a new class of naval vessel, we are reminded 
to carry on his legacy of dignified leadership. 
I join all Americans in honoring the remark-
able life of John Lewis. Martha and I offer 
prayers for his family and for all those he in-
spired and who thus grieve over his loss. 
Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Speak-
er, on Friday, our country lost Congressman 
John Lewis, an inspiring individual who stirred 
so much important change. 
I would like to extend my deepest sym-
pathies to Congressman John Lewis’ family, 
friends, and staff. Congressman Lewis will al-
ways be an icon of courage to promote equal-
ity and freedom. I will always cherish his 
thoughtful and cheerful encouragement during 
our time serving in Congress together. 
Congressman Lewis was especially appre-
ciated by his neighbors—the people of South 
Carolina. 
We will always remember Congressman 
Lewis for his many significant accomplish-
ments. And although he is no longer with us, 
his legacy will always live on. My prayers are 
with the Lewis family during this incredibly 
painful time. 
Ms. JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, in 
the passing of Congressman John Lewis, I 
have lost a dear friend, Georgia has lost a 
true leader, and our nation has lost a civil 
rights icon. 
John Lewis and I first met upon my arrival 
to Congress nearly three decades ago. Yet, by

the time of that meeting, he had already made 
a profound impact on my life. It was because 
of his early work on the advancement of the 
Civil and Voting Rights Acts that I can stand 
here and address you today. 
His grasp of the nuances and complexities 
of public policy, paired with his genuine per-
sonality, made him a dynamic presence in this 
Chamber. When he spoke, everyone—regard-
less of party or politics—listened. When he 
sang—like he did when we were jailed to-
gether following a nonviolent protest at the 
Embassy of Sudan—peace ensued. His sto-
ries captivated, his advice educated, his ser-
mons inspired, and his speeches motivated. 
He brought the same passion he had as an 
activist to the halls of Congress, where he 
spent his career representing Georgia’s 5th 
district. 
It is impossible to properly eulogize John 
Lewis with only words—for he was a man of 
action. We would therefore all do well to reaf-
firm our commitment to the preservation of 
equality and justice in his honor, which is nec-
essary now more than ever before. 
Mr. Speaker, I wish to offer my condolences 
to John Lewis’s family and to thank the Con-
gressman for a life full of ‘‘good trouble.’’ 
Miss GONZA´ LEZ-COLO´ N of Puerto Rico. 
Mr. Speaker, for so many of us, serving in the 
U.S. Congress is the achievement of a life-
time. But by the time John Lewis arrived to 
this chamber, he had already built a historic 
legacy, as one of the Greats of the Civil 
Rights Movement. A man of inspiration and 
hope, committed to the struggles of freedom 
and justice, John had to put himself on the 
line and defend social justice throughout his 
whole lifetime. 
America has lost one of its great leaders. 
John never relented in fighting for what he felt 
was right, yet he always sought the good in 
others. Having suffered bigotry and violence, 
he would not let himself be dragged down by 
hate. 
It is a privilege to me, to have been able to 
know and serve in Congress with such a 
champion of equality and civil rights. Humble 
as the truly great are humble, serene and 
kind, but John was strong in his convictions. In 
his office he displayed mementos of our na-
tion’s crude history of segregation and the 
events of the struggle that he still remembered 
as if it were yesterday. I was privileged to 
have conversations with him asking about his 
experiences, in which he gladly spent much 
longer time than the usual congressional 
meeting. In his gaze as he spoke you could 
see an inner peace that filled the room and 
seemed magical. 
John Lewis always supported the right of 
Puerto Ricans to choose their own future and 
achieve full equality as American citizens, and 
I was able to count on him as cosponsor of 
the Puerto Rico Statehood Admission Act 
(H.R. 4901). He also joined in our effort to rec-
ognize the valor and sacrifice in battle of the 
Puerto Rican soldiers of the 65th Infantry 
Regiment as cosponsor of the measure to es-
tablish 
the 
13th 
of 
April 
as 
National 
Borinqueneers Day. 
In the same spirit of justice and equality, he 
asked me to be the Republican co-lead for the 
Every Child Deserves a Family Act (H.R. 
3114), a piece of legislation that seeks to end 
discrimination in adoption and foster care 
agencies across the nation, forbidding dis-
crimination against children, youths, families 
and individuals on the basis of religion, sex 
(including sexual orientation and gender iden-
tity) and marital status in the management and 
delivery of child welfare services. I did not 
hesitate to say yes. Discrimination is discrimi-
nation whether you are talking political or so-
cial issues. 
Representative Lewis’ gallant defense of 
equality and justice extended to the struggle 
for the rights of the LGBTQ community. I was 
proud to join him in the Equality Act, which 
would extend by law the protection against 
discrimination under the 1964 Civil Rights Act 
to LGBTQ individuals. The march towards true 
justice on which John Lewis spent his life 
goes on: it is up to us to continue it. There will 
be other bridges to cross, and his courage 
should inspire us to cross them, but always 
with love and care for all people. 
May John’s loved ones be comforted by the 
knowledge that his memory will continue to in-
spire many generations who are learning from 
his words, about inclusion and about fighting 
hatred with love. I Thank John (he never want-
ed me to call him Congressman or Mr. Lewis). 
f 
HONORING CONGRESSMAN JOHN 
LEWIS 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under 
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 3, 2019, the gentleman from Geor-
gia (Mr. BISHOP) is recognized for the 
remainder of the hour as the designee 
of the majority leader. 
Mr. BISHOP of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, 
we are here to honor Congressman 
John Robert Lewis, our hero, our col-
league, our brother, our friend. 
Having known John for 52 years, I 
can tell you honestly that even in his 
humanity, he lived his life in the image 
of Jesus. 
John was a voice of the voiceless—Af-
rican 
Americans, 
for 
women, 
for 
LGBTQ people, for the least and the 
left out, for anyone mistreated by soci-
ety. 
His unwavering sense of right and 
wrong was a North Star for this Na-
tion, which is why we called him the 
conscience of the Congress. 
People as good as John don’t come 
our way very often. Despite all of the 
accolades and recognition he received, 
John remained humble, unfailingly 
kind, and always fueled the capacity of 
people to be better, despite their past 
transgressions. 
Where would America be today if it 
were not for John Lewis? Without his 
activism, without his courage, without 
his perseverance for voting rights, I 
doubt if I would be here today. 
Thank you, John, for your lifetime of 
advocacy, for sacrifice of friendship 
and counsel. 
And thank you, God, for the life of 
John Robert Lewis. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman 
from Indiana (Mr. CARSON). 
Mr. CARSON of Indiana. Mr. Speak-
er, John Lewis was certainly a leader 
amongst men. He was a mentor. He was 
a friend. And my heart goes out to his 
family. Our hearts go out to his family. 
I can remember, Mr. Speaker, during 
the healthcare vote, I was coming out 
of Cannon and I ran into John, and he 
asked: ‘‘How many votes do we have 
left, or how much time do we have 
left?’’ I said: ‘‘I think we will make it.’’ 
We crossed the street, along with his 
chief, Michael, and there were thou-
sands of people yelling: ‘‘Kill the bill. 
Kill the bill. Kill the bill.’’ And that 
wasn’t it. They were yelling expletives, 
racial expletives, at the three of us. 
And John looked at me and said: 
‘‘Brother Andre, this reminds me of a 
darker time, brother.’’ 
John became a mentor. We would call 
him up, and he would speak to the 
Muslim community. We would call him 
up, and he would speak to the folks in 
Indiana who were there when it was an-
nounced that Dr. King had passed, be-
cause he was in Indianapolis at the 
time. 
b 1900 
He was a true servant, Mr. Speaker. 
Jesus was mentioned. John was like 
Jesus. I am reminded of a Scripture 
when Jesus was having a conversation 
with his disciples about this notion of 
leadership, and Jesus looked at his dis-
ciples and said: He who wishes to be 
chief among you shall first be your 
servant. 
John was a servant. He wasn’t the 
kind of leader who looked at the pro-
testers today and said: Oh, what you 
are going through is nothing compared 
to what we went through. 
He stood in solidarity with those 
young folks and embraced those young 
folks like a real leader. John is an ex-
ample to all of us, what true public 
servants should be. 
We love you, John. God bless. 
Mr. BISHOP of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, 
we make our living by what we get. We 
make a life by what we give. John 
Lewis certainly made a life. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentle-
woman from Alabama (Ms. SEWELL). 
Ms. SEWELL of Alabama. Mr. Speak-
er, I rise today to honor the life and 
outstanding legacy of our colleague, 
friend, mentor, and my hero, Congress-
man John Robert Lewis. 
Growing up as a little girl in Selma, 
Alabama, John’s incredible legacy was 
a hero’s tale as familiar to me as any 
Bible story or family lore. 
As a little girl singing in the choir, 
the children’s choir at Brown Chapel 
AME Church, my home church, it was 
the church where John and so many 
wonderful foot soldiers would come 
time and time again to honor the leg-
acy of the Bloody Sunday march. 
But to know John was to know a man 
without ego, who, despite his many 
well-deserved accolades and successes, 
loved every person he met. He looked 
them in the eye. Can’t you hear him? 
‘‘My brother, my sister,’’ he would say. 
John loved this country more than 
any person who I have met, and it was 
his deep-seated patriotism that will 
live on. 
His legacy, indeed, was the Voting 
Rights Act. And, we, in this body, can 
do something about that. Yes, we can

name things for John, but the biggest 
thing that we can do is rename H.R. 4. 
We should call it the John Robert 
Lewis Voting Rights Act of 2020 and 
fully restore the Voting Rights Act of 
1965. That is the legacy of John Lewis. 
He gave us the road map. Can’t you 
hear him? Never give up, never give in. 
Keep your eyes on the prize. Keep the 
faith. 
Mr. 
BISHOP 
of 
Georgia. 
George 
Washington Carver once said: How far 
you go in life depends on your being 
tender with the young, compassionate 
with the aged, sympathetic with the 
striving, and tolerant of the weak and 
strong, because someday in your life 
you will have been all of these. That 
was our friend, John Lewis. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentle-
woman from Ohio (Mrs. BEATTY). 
Mrs. BEATTY. Mr. Speaker, America 
has lost a national treasure, one of the 
world’s greatest fighters and defenders 
of freedom and justice. Congressman 
LEWIS’ words and work and legacy will 
live forever. 
I am so fortunate to have traveled to 
Africa with him and to have marched 
in my hometown with him. You see, 
Mr. Speaker, when Mr. LEWIS spoke, 
you heard the voice of history, a voice 
that helped stir the conscience of 
America at a time of ugliness and 
struggle, but also at a time and in an 
era of hope and accomplishment. 
My colleagues, there is no greater 
time for us to stand up against injus-
tices that we are facing, no greater 
time for us to fight for justice and fair-
ness at the ballot box. So, my col-
leagues, let us make some noise. Let us 
get in trouble, good trouble. 
God bless you. Rest in peace. Rest in 
power, my friend. Good trouble. 
Mr. BISHOP of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, 
I yield to the gentlewoman from Illi-
nois (Ms. KELLY). 
Ms. KELLY of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I 
want to share my letter to Congress-
man John Robert Lewis. 
Dear John, I hope you knew how incredibly 
honored I was to call you colleague and to 
serve with you. It was such a great privilege 
to watch you in action and listen to your 
stories. 
When we planned the sit-in, being a part of 
the Fab 5 made me so proud. It took a while 
to get the bill out of the House, but we fi-
nally did it. I promise you, when I encounter 
a situation that is just not right, I will stand 
up, speak out, and get in the way. 
I plan to carry a piece of you with me for-
ever. I know I will be a better person for it. 
I hope you, C.T. Vivian, Martin, Rosa, 
Edgar, Robert Kennedy, and others are hav-
ing a fabulous reunion. 
Rest in power, my friend, until we meet 
again. 
Love, Robin. 
Mr. BISHOP of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, 
how much time remains? 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from Georgia has 22 minutes re-
maining. 
Mr. BISHOP of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, 
I yield to the gentlewoman from Michi-
gan (Mrs. LAWRENCE). 
Mrs. LAWRENCE. Mr. Speaker, just 
this year, I remember John urging 
Americans to ‘‘get in good trouble, nec-
essary trouble, and help redeem the 
soul of America,’’ as we combat some 
of the most hateful messages and prior-
ities driven by this current administra-
tion. 
Today, I stand here and, John, I 
promise that I will continue to carry 
out your legacy, to get into good trou-
ble and to ensure that the fight for 
equality and justice lives on, and to 
challenge my colleagues on both sides 
of the aisle to do the same and pass the 
Voting Rights Act. 
John, rest in peace. Rest in power. 
You have been a good and faithful serv-
ant. 
Mr. BISHOP of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, 
I yield to the gentleman from Pennsyl-
vania (Mr. EVANS). 
Mr. EVANS. Mr. Speaker, I rise to 
honor a truly great American and a 
real-life hero. 
I was fortunate enough to have him 
as a colleague for 4 years. Congressman 
John Lewis has been an inspiration to 
me at a very young age. 
I remember the first time I saw him 
was on the evening news. He was walk-
ing across the Pettus Bridge. I felt very 
strongly about him and what he was 
doing. I was 10 years old, and I found 
him to be inspiring. He was purposeful. 
He was driven to make a difference. He 
was driven to make some good trouble. 
Now, we must carry on with the work 
of civil rights and equal opportunity. 
Rest in power, Congressman LEWIS. 
Mr. BISHOP of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, 
I yield to the gentlewoman from Flor-
ida (Mrs. DEMINGS). 
Mrs. DEMINGS. Mr. Speaker, on 
June 12, 2016, a lone gunman walked 
into the Pulse nightclub in Orlando, 
Florida, and opened fire with a semi-
automatic rifle. That night, the shoot-
er killed 49 people and injured 53 oth-
ers. At the time, it was the largest 
mass shooting in American history. 
The Pulse nightclub is in my district, 
but I was not in Congress at the time. 
When I saw the Members of Congress 
taking to the floor and holding a sit-in, 
I was not surprised that the person 
leading the way was Representative 
John Lewis. To him, the victims were a 
part of the big family John Lewis often 
spoke about. 
Thank you, John, for never discrimi-
nating. Thank you, John, for never 
leaving people behind. 
Galatians 5 defines the fruit of the 
spirit as love, peace, long-suffering, 
kindness, 
goodness, 
faithfulness, 
gentleness, 
and 
self-control. 
John 
Lewis was all of that to the House, to 
the Nation, and to the world, and I am 
grateful for his friendship and his coun-
sel and grateful for a life well-lived. 
Mr. BISHOP of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, 
I yield to the gentlewoman from Geor-
gia (Mrs. MCBATH). 
Mrs. MCBATH. Mr. Speaker, tonight, 
we stand in this great Chamber and 
mourn our friend, a civil rights icon 
and the conscience of Congress. 
John Lewis towered over his era, and 
his loss is deeply felt across this coun-
try and across the globe. From march-
ing for freedom in Montgomery to 
being beaten and bloodied on a bridge 
in Selma, John’s life showed us all the 
fundamental need for good, necessary 
trouble. 
As John would often say: 
We have a moral obligation, a mission, and 
a mandate to do what we can to make our 
country and our world a better place and to 
help usher in a loving community where no 
one is left out or left behind. 
His words and his life ring through 
eternity. 
We will honor John’s legacy with an 
unshakeable determination to fight for 
what is right and what is just. He 
served the Nation in love. Rest in 
peace, my friend. We love you. I love 
you. 
Mr. BISHOP of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, 
may I request the amount of time re-
maining. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tlemen from Georgia has 15 minutes re-
maining. 
Mr. BISHOP of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, 
I yield to the gentleman from Mary-
land (Mr. MFUME). 
Mr. MFUME. Mr. Speaker, as we 
have been hearing and continue to 
hear, the passing of John Lewis rep-
resents a loss for America of one of our 
greatest heroes and, for many of us, a 
dear and old friend. 
John and I were sworn in together in 
this Chamber 33 years ago as class-
mates in the 100th Congress. There 
were only four African Americans 
elected to Congress that year, he, my-
self, Floyd Flake of New York, and 
Mike Espy of Mississippi. We huddled 
with John here on the floor, and he 
made all of us hug each other. He said: 
We got here in different ways, but we 
are one band of brothers now. 
The passion and the equality that he 
carried with him throughout his life, as 
we know, never waned. His untiring 
quest for justice never faltered. With a 
big heart for compassion, John, like his 
mentor, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., 
was unawed by opinion, unseduced by 
flattery, and undismayed by disaster. 
Birthed in an area of Jim Crow and 
vile and vicious segregation, he defied 
the limitedness of others’ expectations. 
John knew that politics changed peo-
ple, so he set out early to change poli-
tics. 
b 1915 
Everything about him pointed to the 
fact that he was emblematic of that 
great band of freedom fighters who re-
alized that freedom wasn’t free. 
In this era where everyone seems to 
be searching for the next big thing or 
the next great thing, isn’t it odd, Mr. 
Speaker, that the greatness of John 
Lewis was with us all along? We needed 
only to look as far as the latest move-
ment for social change to find it. 
We are sad today, but heaven is re-
joicing, and John has claimed his final 
reward. 
Mr. BISHOP of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, 
it has been said that service is the rent

we pay for the space we occupy on this 
Earth. John Lewis paid his rent, and he 
paid it well. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman 
from Texas (Mr. HURD). 
Mr. HURD of Texas. A Freedom Rider 
unshaken by threats and violence, a 
leader in the struggle for voting rights 
who kept fighting even after a broken 
skull, 
a 
courageous 
American 
undeterred by more than 40 arrests 
after standing up for what is right, 
John Lewis spent his life fighting in-
justice and racism. 
If it weren’t for the bravery of John 
and men and women like him, many of 
us wouldn’t be in this Chamber today. 
And as a Black man, I am not sure I 
would have had the same rights as my 
fellow countrymen. 
John shaped this country in immeas-
urable ways. He never sat by when he 
saw injustice. He never stopped fight-
ing. 
At a time when America is so di-
vided, we should look at John’s cour-
age for inspiration; we should look at 
John’s bravery for imitation; and we 
should look at John’s words and follow 
them. 
I lost a mentor. John’s family lost a 
father, son, brother, and husband. Our 
country lost an American hero. 
Rest in peace, my brother. 
Mr. BISHOP of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, 
I yield to the gentlewoman from Cali-
fornia (Ms. LEE). 
Ms. LEE of California. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman for yielding. 
What a void we feel tonight. I rise to 
honor the life and legacy of a great 
warrior for peace and justice, a kind 
and gentle human being, the con-
science of the Congress, Congressman 
John Lewis. 
As a giant of, as our whip indicated, 
a civil rights movement, John’s leader-
ship and his courage continued as an 
extraordinary 
congressional 
leader. 
Every year, I joined John on his annual 
pilgrimage to Selma, Montgomery, and 
Birmingham, 
Alabama. 
I 
brought 
young people from the Martin Luther 
King Jr. Freedom Center in my district 
and my grandchildren each year to 
learn about and give thanks to the foot 
soldiers of the civil rights movement. 
John always took time to meet with 
these young people. Even this year, 
with his failing health, he pulled them 
aside. He met with them. He always 
wanted to, and he did, inspire them to 
take that baton and to run the next lap 
of the race for justice and equality. 
And, yes, like with so many, he blessed 
my community by coming to my dis-
trict to continue these efforts with my 
young people. 
Last year, Speaker PELOSI and Chair-
woman BASS led a delegation to Ghana, 
West Africa, to observe the 400th anni-
versary of the first enslaved Africans 
brought to America. John said that 
Ghana was one of the most moving 
trips of his life. He said: ‘‘To see and 
behold the inhumanity during another 
period of our history, it tells each and 
every one of us to never let this evil 
happen again.’’ 
Now, John was welcomed in Ghana as 
royalty, which he was. He was honored 
as a son of Africa who had come home. 
John and I would compare notes on 
tough votes, such as on matters of war 
and peace and defense spending. I will 
miss his wise counsel and admonition— 
and, really, admonition—to do the 
right thing as he told all of us to keep 
our eyes on the prize. 
Now, Members know how we get agi-
tated when our colleagues poach our 
staff members. Well, John poached a 
brilliant and wonderful young woman 
from my office Jamila Thompson. 
When he told me about it, believe it or 
not, for the first time, I was thrilled 
that one of my staff members had been 
poached by John Lewis. What an honor. 
John’s presence in the people’s House 
will be deeply missed, but one of the 
greatest tributes to Congressman John 
Lewis would be to restore the Voting 
Rights Act. 
I would not be standing here as the 
100th Black Member of Congress had it 
not been for the Honorable John Rob-
ert Lewis. 
My deepest condolences and love and 
gratitude to John’s family, Michael 
Collins, Jamila Thompson, his entire 
phenomenal staff, and his constituents, 
and to all those whose lives he touched. 
Let us continue to build the beloved 
community 
that 
he 
so 
eloquently 
spoke of. 
In closing, I am reminded of a Scrip-
ture, 2 Timothy 4:7: I have fought the 
good fight, I have finished the race, I 
have kept the faith. 
As John Lewis’ soul returns to his 
Creator, may he rest in peace, may he 
rest in power. 
Mr. BISHOP of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, 
how much time is remaining? 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from Georgia has 7 minutes re-
maining. 
Mr. BISHOP of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, 
as we come to the close of this first 
hour of tribute to our friend and our 
colleague and our hero, John Robert 
Lewis, I leave you with the words of 
Douglas Malloch, who wrote: 
The tree that never had to fight 
For Sun and sky and air and light, 
But stood out in the open plain 
And always got its share of rain, 
Never became a forest king 
But lived and died a scrubby thing. 
The man who never had to toil 
To gain and farm his patch of soil, 
Who never had to win his share 
Of Sun and sky and light and air, 
Never became a manly man 
But lived and died as he began. 
Good timber does not grow in ease; 
The stronger wind, the stronger trees; 
The further sky, the greater length; 
The more the storm, the more the strength. 
By Sun and cold, by rain and snow, 
In trees and men, good timbers grow. 
Where thickest lies the forest growth, 
We find the patriarchs of both. 
And they hold counsel with the stars 
Whose broken branches show the scars 
Of many winds and much of strife, 
This is the common law of life. 
John Robert Lewis was indeed good 
timber. God bless his soul. May he rest 
in peace and in power. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
f 
CELEBRATING THE LIFE OF 
CONGRESSMAN JOHN LEWIS 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under 
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 3, 2019, the gentlewoman from Wy-
oming (Ms. CHENEY) is recognized for 60 
minutes as the designee of the minor-
ity leader. 
Ms. CHENEY. Mr. Speaker, it is my 
honor this evening to manage the time 
that we have on the Republican side to 
celebrate and remember the life of our 
tremendous colleague, Mr. John Lewis. 
Mr. Speaker, I was very moved, hav-
ing the opportunity to watch my col-
leagues on the other side of the aisle 
discuss and describe the impact that 
Congressman Lewis had on their lives, 
on all of our lives, and on this Cham-
ber. I am struck by the fact that as we 
gather tonight in this Chamber, we rise 
not as representatives of two different 
political parties, but we rise as elected 
representatives of this great Nation, a 
Nation that is mourning the loss of a 
great American, and as honored col-
leagues of a man, John Lewis, who 
dedicated his life to service and to the 
fight for justice and freedom. 
John Lewis taught us: ‘‘Nothing can 
stop the power of a committed and de-
termined people to make a difference 
in our society. Why? Because human 
beings are the most dynamic link to 
the divine on this planet.’’ 
John Lewis understood that one man 
or woman can make a difference—in-
deed, that it is only the determined 
and principled action of committed 
men and women that brings change. 
He knew the blessings of this Nation, 
and he knew what it took to secure 
those blessings for all Americans. He 
knew that the fight was unfinished. 
Mr. Speaker, the day that I was 
sworn into this body for the first time, 
I was standing just outside these doors 
in the Speaker’s lobby. I had just ar-
rived with my dad, who joined me on 
the floor that day. By chance, as we 
were coming in, we met John Lewis 
standing in the lobby. The three of us 
had the chance before the ceremony to 
spend some time together. 
The two of them didn’t agree on 
much, but they did agree on certain 
critical things. They agreed on the ex-
ceptional nature of this country, on 
the magnificence of this, the people’s 
House, and on the incalculable bless-
ings of freedom. 
I am blessed by the memory of that 
day, and I am blessed that at that mo-
ment when I was about to be sworn 
into this House, I was able to spend 
time with those two men. 
Writing of his experiences fighting 
for civil rights, John Lewis said this: 
‘‘Freedom is not a state; it is an act. It 
is not some enchanted garden perched 
high on a distant plateau where we can 
finally sit down and rest. Freedom is 
the continuous action we all must 
take, and each generation must do its

part to create an even more fair, more 
just society.’’ 
Great men and women like John 
Lewis in every generation have known 
this, that we all have an obligation to 
defend our freedom, to fight for it, to 
do our part to be worthy of the sac-
rifices of those who have gone before. 
One of the greatest gifts we can give 
to young people today is to teach them 
that lesson, to teach them our history, 
to convey to them the duty, the obliga-
tion, and the incredible blessing of 
being an American and of working to 
make sure that we pass this Nation to 
our children and our grandchildren 
more perfect than it is today. 
Our colleague, Congressman John 
Lewis, dedicated his life to that ideal. 
His memory will be a blessing and an 
example to us all, our colleagues, his 
colleagues, here in the House, to his 
family, to his constituents, and to his 
fellow Americans. 
God bless John Lewis, and God bless 
the United States of America. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time.

MEMORIALIZING THE HONORABLE 
JOHN LEWIS 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under 
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 3, 2019, the gentleman from North 
Carolina (Mr. WALKER) is recognized 
for the remainder of the hour as the 
designee of the minority leader. 
Mr. WALKER. Mr. Speaker, I am 
honored to participate in this Special 
Order, and I will look forward to hear-
ing from our speakers in honoring the 
great John Lewis. 
Over this past weekend, America lost 
not only a civil rights icon but also a 
loving father, a loving husband, a car-
ing friend to this entire House body, 
Congressman John Lewis. 
Mr. Lewis’ courage and strength in 
the face of oppression are unmatched. 
His contributions to America’s soul are 
paramount to the progress that we 
have made in our histories. 
His experience on Bloody Sunday left 
him battered, covered in blood, and on 
the side of the road in Selma, Alabama, 
yet he carried on with his unifying 
message for America. 
Many years ago, John Lewis crossed 
the 
monumental 
Edmund 
Pettus 
Bridge, fighting for freedom and a path 
toward achieving what our Founding 
Fathers had pledged but fell short to 
uphold. 
I was extremely honored to have the 
opportunity 54 years later to walk 
across this very bridge in Selma, and 
we all honored the brave steps he led, 
rallying an entire Nation. The fact 
that I was asked to give the closing re-
marks at Dexter Avenue King Memo-
rial Baptist Church in Montgomery is 
something, frankly, I will always treas-
ure. 
John Lewis’ protest inspired our Na-
tion to not only do better but to reflect 
on all of our actions. Through his grace 
and humility, he made monumental 
progress. He liked to refer to these acts 
as ‘‘good trouble.’’ 
While we don’t share many of the 
same political opinions, there was 
never a doubt in my mind that Con-
gressman John Lewis lived his entire 
life fighting for our country and the 
American people. 
He gave us all hope, hope that we 
could get over this partisan divide, 
hope that we could get over the divi-
sions of the past to paint a brighter fu-
ture. 
May we never lose that spirit and for-
ever honor his legacy by never letting 
the forces of division, hatred, and evil 
tear down those bridges that so many 
of us have sacrificed to build. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman 
from Louisiana (Mr. SCALISE), the mi-
nority whip. 
b 1930 
Mr. SCALISE. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
my friend and colleague, the gen-
tleman 
from 
North 
Carolina 
(Mr. 
WALKER), for yielding. 
I join with my colleagues, both Re-
publican and Democrat, who mourn the 
loss of John Lewis. 
We have so many honors to be able to 
serve in a job like this where we get to 
represent the people of this Nation, es-
pecially here in the people’s House 
where we truly do bring all of the dif-
ferent elements of what makes Amer-
ica great into one body with people 
who represent every different type of 
background and every different kind of 
community, the kinds of people we get 
to serve with. 
There are giants among the people 
we have the honor of serving with. 
John Lewis was at the top of that list, 
and you knew it when you served with 
him. 
I remember telling colleagues years 
ago that, while we have our differences, 
it is really important to go get to know 
especially some of the legends, the gi-
ants we serve with in this body. 
I remember talking about two Mem-
bers in particular: it was John Lewis 
and Sam Johnson, one Democrat, one 
Republican, two people who were just 
giants. Unfortunately, we have now 
lost both of them in the last year. 
Our institution is better because 
John Lewis was a part of this great 
body, but it is what John fought for his 
whole life. 
I know my colleague from North 
Carolina as well as my colleagues in 
the Congressional Black Caucus talked 
about, earlier, his mantra of ‘‘good 
trouble.’’ What John experienced in his 
life, there are so many people who have 
freedoms today they would never have 
if John hadn’t gone through that. 
I had an honor, like so many of my 
colleagues, to go with John, he invited 
Members from both parties to go to 
Selma to be a part of reliving that his-
tory, which was a dark side of our his-
tory, Bloody Sunday, but one that 
John used as a teachable moment to 
bring people from all parts of this 
country to walk across that Edmund 
Pettus Bridge. I got to walk arm in 
arm with John. It was one of the great 
honors I have had as a Member of Con-
gress to be able to do that. 
The whole time we were walking 
with him—this could be a moment that 
John wanted to just leave in his past 
because he was so brutally beaten, but 
he wanted to share the experiences. 
And as we were walking, we would 
round the corner, and he would point to 
different buildings. And he said: That 
is where we gathered. That is where 
some of the people who were trying to 
stop us would be. 
He helped organize the Student Non-
violent 
Coordinating 
Committee, 
SNCC. He started at a young age in the 
civil rights movement, at a time when 
it was not only difficult, but it was 
possibly 
life-threatening. 
And 
for 
many, they did lose their life in that 
battle. 
And John lost blood. He shed blood 
for the cause. But he never took it as a 
moment to get down. He never took it 
as a moment to be bitter. 
He wanted to continue fighting to 
make America a more perfect Union, 
and he did. And that is what we will re-
member about John. We will remember 
his warm-hearted spirit. 
John was one of those very few peo-
ple in a body like this where, when he 
stood at the podium to speak, no mat-
ter what side you were on on that 
issue, you stopped, you sat down, and 
you listened, because you knew you 
were listening to somebody who was 
larger than life. 
John is in a better place right now, 
but America is a better place because 
John was here. 
God bless John Lewis and his family. 
Mr. WALKER. Mr. Speaker, I yield to 
the gentlewoman from California (Ms. 
MATSUI). 
Ms. MATSUI. Mr. Speaker, I rise to 
speak in honor of a beloved colleague 
and wonderful friend, John Lewis. 
I first met John when my husband, 
Bob Matsui, was a Member of Congress. 
Bob loved John. He loved him for his 
humanity, his conviction, and the fact 
that he was a total human being. 
I had heard so much about John be-
cause he was a historic figure, but I 
saw another side of him, too, when Bob 
brought him to Sacramento. He met 
many people. And I remember his 
walking across a university campus 
with the president of the university 
when he ran across, Bob and he and 
John, a bunch of chickens that the stu-
dents were advocating to keep on cam-
pus. The president was saying: No. We 
have got to get the chickens out. 
The president said: Excuse me, Mr. 
Lewis, but we are going to get rid of 
those chickens. 
And John said: No way are you going 
to get rid of those chickens. I learned 
to preach by preaching to chickens. 
That is the part of John that I really 
loved, too, that humorous part, the 
part you can laugh with. 
But this gentle giant lived also every 
single day to overcome injustice, eradi-
cate racism, and give hope to all who

walked beside him. He is a total per-
son. 
At this moment in our history when 
speaking truth to power is so vital, it 
is more important than ever to follow 
John’s words, to ‘‘stand up, speak out, 
and keep your eyes on the prize.’’ 
John taught us all that America is 
greater than the sum of its parts. When 
you weave a rich, colorful tapestry, the 
weaving itself makes it strong. His im-
pact will be forever felt in our Nation’s 
conscience, and we are all better for it. 
At this difficult time, my prayers are 
with the Lewis family and all his 
friends. He will be sorely missed. 
I love you, John. 
Mr. WALKER. Mr. Speaker, I yield to 
the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. FER-
GUSON), our deputy whip. It only makes 
sense to go first to John Lewis’ col-
leagues in the delegation from Georgia. 
Mr. FERGUSON. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman from North Caro-
lina (Mr. WALKER) for allowing me to 
do this. 
I rise tonight to honor the life and 
legacy of John Lewis. 
John dedicated his life to equality 
and justice, and the Nation we are so 
blessed to live in is better because of 
his work and his sacrifice. 
John was driven by his deep faith, his 
servant heart, and his love of his fellow 
human being. While John was always 
right to fight for legal changes to make 
America better, he ultimately knew 
that how you treated your fellow 
human being was a matter of the heart. 
John led by example. He led by show-
ing love and grace to all people. He 
showed love and grace even to those 
people who disagreed with him or 
showed him contempt. 
John was always willing to offer for-
giveness to those who had done him 
wrong, knowing that forgiveness was 
fundamental to building a relationship 
built on trust and love. 
Two of my most vivid memories and 
treasured experiences here in my time 
in Congress involved John. 
One was a dinner at his house. He in-
vited the Georgia delegation over, and 
he retold the story of his life and expe-
riences in the civil rights movement. 
What a cherished memory and experi-
ence. 
The second was the night that we 
honored another Georgia giant here, 
former House Member and former U.S. 
Senator JOHNNY ISAKSON. I remember 
the night that JOHNNY
ISAKSON
and 
John Lewis met in the center and em-
braced in true love, friendship, and re-
spect. It was truly an amazing mo-
ment. 
John was an amazing man, and I be-
lieve that the only thing John Lewis 
ever hated was hate itself. 
Rest in peace, our dear friend. 
Mr. WALKER. Mr. Speaker, I yield to 
the gentlewoman from New York (Mrs. 
LOWEY). 
Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise to 
honor the memory of Congressman 
John Lewis, an American hero, a dear 
friend. 
He taught us what patriotism is, that 
to love our country is to acknowledge 
and work to repair its imperfections. 
Congressman Lewis endured angry 
mobs, death threats, and so much vio-
lence with endurance, persistence, and 
even warmth and optimism. Surely we 
can honor his remarkable life by com-
ing together to reauthorize the Voting 
Rights Act, to ensure our laws reflect 
that Black lives matter. 
Advocating 
for 
the 
Nation’s 
marginalized throughout his life, act-
ing as the conscience of Congress dur-
ing his 34 years of service, he inspired 
generations of Americans to get in 
‘‘good trouble.’’ 
I remember sitting on the floor with 
John. Rather than sitting in the chair, 
we were proving our point and all sit-
ting on the floor. 
He has taught us so much with his 
sweet, sweet manner, but the strength 
of his conviction. 
We must honor Congressman Lewis’ 
legacy by striving to achieve the equi-
table and just society for all that he 
fought so hard to attain. In the words 
of John himself, ‘‘If not us, then who? 
If not now, then when?’’ 
Dear, sweet, kind John, we will miss 
you. We love you. May you rest in 
peace. 
Mr. WALKER. Mr. Speaker, I yield to 
the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. AUS-
TIN SCOTT). 
Mr. AUSTIN SCOTT of Georgia. Mr. 
Speaker, I thank the gentleman from 
North Carolina (Mr. WALKER) for yield-
ing to me to speak about my friend and 
colleague, Congressman John Lewis, a 
man that I loved. 
I will miss dearly him saying, ‘‘I love 
you too, brother.’’ 
There is no telling how many times 
John Lewis told the people of this 
House, ‘‘I love you too, brother.’’ He 
looked at everybody, no matter who 
you were, as a brother. 
I selfishly thought about how much I 
was going to miss him and seeing him 
and Michael Collins on a Delta ready to 
fly up here. I always got a kick out of 
the fact that people from my district 
would sit down next to me and say: Did 
you see John Lewis on the plane? And, 
by the way, what do you do? 
That was just the way people loved 
John Lewis. 
There is not a person walking in this 
country today who didn’t benefit from 
John Lewis and what he did for man-
kind, and I would venture to say that 
the majority of the people in the world 
benefited from his love and what he 
did. 
I thought about a few passages. We 
have talked about him preaching to the 
chickens, and maybe we are the chick-
ens he was preaching to his whole life. 
I remembered the Beatitudes: 
Blessed are the peacemakers, for they 
should be called the children of God. 
If there was ever a peacemaker that 
I met, it was John Lewis. 
Following from there: 
Blessed are they which are persecuted for 
righteousness’ sake, for theirs is the king-
dom of Heaven. 
A little further into the book of Mat-
thew: 
Let your light shine before men that they 
may see your good works and glorify your 
Father, which is in Heaven. 
There is no doubt, Mr. Speaker, that 
John Lewis was a special man. He was 
a special man of God. And while his 
bones may rest, his legacy will live on 
forever in this body. 
I, for one, look very forward to the 
day that a statue of John Lewis rests 
in the Halls of this Congress rep-
resenting not only the great State of 
Georgia and the people of the State of 
Georgia, but all of the men and women 
of the United States. 
Mr. WALKER. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
Representative SCOTT for his comments 
tonight. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentle-
woman from California (Mrs. DAVIS). 
Mrs. DAVIS of California. Mr. Speak-
er, with John Robert Lewis’ passing, 
we lose and deeply mourn a great 
friend and mentor, and the world loses 
the most respected ‘‘good trouble’’ 
maker of our time. 
John’s standing will only grow as his 
legacy endures. 
Mr. Speaker, every year since I have 
been in Congress, I asked John to 
speak to entering high school seniors 
from San Diego who visited our Capitol 
as part of an in-depth civics and leader-
ship program; and for 20 years, with 
each new group of 45 very diverse stu-
dents, he gave his time, his energy, and 
his wisdom, graciously answering their 
many spirited questions. They, too, 
will never forget him and how he 
changed them. Here is just a brief ex-
ample: 
Alejandra Cordova, from 2001, said 
Mr. Lewis taught her ‘‘not to be afraid 
to rock the boat every once in a 
while.’’ 
David Hickman, from 2015, said he 
‘‘truly showed us what it meant to be a 
change-maker, to live through our ac-
tions and speak up against injustice.’’ 
He taught our children well. 
John, you taught and changed me 
and everyone you touched. Thank you. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank Michael Collins 
and all of John’s staff, who had the 
hardest task of all to say to visitors 
captured by John’s words: ‘‘I am sorry, 
but the Congressman must depart 
now.’’ 
Mr. WALKER. Mr. Speaker, I yield to 
the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. HICE), 
a fellow pastor. 
Mr. HICE of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman from North Caro-
lina (Mr. WALKER), my good friend, for 
yielding to me. 
There is no question that all of us 
who have served with John Lewis 
mourn the passing of this towering fig-
ure who devoted his life to fighting for 
freedom and equality. 
b 1945 
An interesting perspective of his life, 
as a son of Alabama sharecroppers, 
John Lewis demonstrated that, in 
America, a single individual, even one

coming from the most humble of back-
grounds, can have an enormous impact 
in this country. 
We all know that he rose to be a pow-
erful leader in the civil rights move-
ment; worked very closely with Dr. 
Martin Luther King Jr., and so many 
other great heroes who sacrificed their 
lives to ensure that Americans of all 
races live in liberty in this country. 
But he did so peacefully. 
He once wrote this, and this has a 
great, powerful meaning. He said: ‘‘Re-
lease the need to hate, to harbor divi-
sion, and the enticement of revenge. 
Release all bitterness. Hold only love, 
only peace in your heart, knowing that 
the battle of good to overcome evil is 
already won.’’ 
John Lewis knew that it was nec-
essary to fight the sins of this country; 
but he understood also to fight those in 
a nonviolent way. 
I just have the deepest respect for 
John Lewis, and I am honored to have 
considered him a dear friend. 
I just want to thank all my col-
leagues this evening for joining in this 
time to honor such a great man and an 
icon, obviously, particularly in the 
civil rights movement. 
My wife, Dee Dee, and I continue to 
pray for the Lewis family. Again, I 
thank all my colleagues for joining to-
night. 
Mr. WALKER. Mr. Speaker, I yield to 
the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. 
PAYNE). 
Mr. PAYNE. Mr. Speaker, I would 
like to thank the gentleman from 
North Carolina for allowing me several 
minutes to pay my respects to a great 
man. 
And it is not remiss that I see the 
Speaker pro tempore; it is very appro-
priate that you are in the seat tonight, 
sir. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor 
John Lewis. He was an American icon, 
civil rights legend, and dear friend and 
an inspiration to millions. Yet, these 
words truly fail to describe the dif-
ference he made in our country. 
He always spoke of ‘‘getting into 
good trouble,’’ and I know that has 
been echoed here on numerous occa-
sions, but it sums up what Mr. Lewis 
was all about. 
His efforts led to the Civil Rights 
Act. His efforts led to the Voting 
Rights Act. And his efforts led to the 
Congressional Black Caucus, and even 
the 
election 
of 
President 
Barack 
Obama. 
But his loss is more than his legacy. 
For me, once again, I have lost one of 
my fathers on the floor of Congress. He 
was a role model for what makes a 
great Congressman, and I constantly 
watched as he moved about his busi-
ness: Like the way he always fought 
for the right thing; the way he could 
convey 
such 
power 
and 
strength 
through such a gentle demeanor. 
But when he had passion, and was 
committed, there is no one else on this 
floor you would rather have with you 
going into that fight. 
And the way he stood up to abuse to 
make this country a better place. One 
of my greatest honors was to be a part 
of the sit-in he led on the House floor 
to fight for gun control legislation 
after the terrible, dreadful Florida 
issue. We got into some good trouble 
that day. 
He inspired us then, and his words 
and deeds will inspire new generations; 
whether they are civil rights pioneers, 
elected officials, or any American with 
a dream or cause. 
God bless you, Mr. Lewis. Your life 
made our country and our world a bet-
ter place. 
Mr. WALKER. Mr. Speaker, may I 
get a time remaining? 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman has 32 minutes remaining. 
Mr. WALKER. Mr. Speaker, I yield to 
the 
gentleman 
from 
Georgia 
(Mr. 
ALLEN). 
MR. ALLEN. I thank the gentleman 
from North Carolina for this privilege. 
Mr. 
Speaker, 
many 
Americans 
learned about the civil rights move-
ment in the news or read about it in 
history books. John Lewis lived it. 
One of my greatest memories here 
was to have dinner with Congressman 
LEWIS at his home, where he shared 
with the entire Georgia delegation his 
experience in leading the civil rights 
movement. 
He shared with me that Dr. Martin 
Luther King Jr. prayed with them on 
those buses before the demonstrations 
and urged everyone to remain at peace 
to ensure lasting change. 
I know we can all learn from the ex-
ample Congressman Lewis set as a civil 
rights icon. We must meet injustice 
with humility and perseverance to do 
what is right. 
Pride and fear are the opposite of hu-
mility. John Lewis and all those in this 
movement demonstrated perfect love 
while being persecuted. Perfect love 
casts out all fear and only comes from 
God and obedience to His word and was 
perfectly demonstrated at the cross of 
Jesus Christ. 
My wife, Robin, and I pray that his 
family finds peace during this difficult 
time. And this is a lesson for this body 
as we honor those like John Lewis, who 
have come before us and fought for an 
America that is stronger and is unified, 
by putting aside our differences to 
serve the American people in perfect 
love. 
Mr. WALKER. Mr. Speaker, I yield to 
the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. 
COHEN), with his own amazing civil 
rights history. 
Mr. COHEN. Mr. Speaker, I appre-
ciate the time. 
I say to the gentleman from North 
Carolina that I remember that the last 
time I saw John Lewis was March 5, his 
birthday; and the gentleman offered 
the prayer. That meant a lot to me, 
and it showed me the respect that you 
had for him and that he had for you. It 
was a beautiful moment. 
There was not a more perfect person 
that has probably served in the Con-
gress and, certainly that I have known 
in my life, than John R. Lewis. He had 
every quality that you would desire in 
a human being and couldn’t even imag-
ine a person to have them altogether. 
He was a hero of the civil rights 
movement and cared greatly about the 
injustices that he had seen as an Afri-
can 
American, 
and 
that 
is 
what 
launched him on his civil rights strug-
gles. But once he got moving, it was 
people of different issues of discrimina-
tion that he championed; whether it 
was gay and lesbian; whether it was 
Native Americans; whether it was 
women, or just simple people being vic-
tims of gun violence, John Lewis took 
up the cause and he stood up for every-
body. 
He did not know color. He did not 
know gender. He did not know any dif-
ferences in people. He loved all people. 
It was such an honor to serve with 
him. 
Early in my career, the American 
Bar Association presented the Day 
Award to John Lewis, Richard Lugar 
and myself. The award was nothing 
compared to the fact that I was with 
John Lewis that day. It made me feel 
much greater than I ever could become. 
I had the great honor to travel with 
him to South Africa for the 50th anni-
versary of Robert F. Kennedy’s Ripple 
of Hope speech in Cape Town. I saw and 
I sat across from he and Bishop 
Desmond Tutu, and I knew I was seeing 
two angels together, two special souls 
united. 
Mr. Lewis loved two people in life 
that were his heroes; one was Dr. Mar-
tin Luther King Jr., and the other was 
Robert Kennedy. The purpose of that 
speech on that trip was to honor Rob-
ert Kennedy and the 50th anniversary 
of that speech. 
In that speech, Robert Kennedy said: 
‘‘It is from numberless diverse acts of 
courage and belief that human history 
is shaped. Each time a man stands up 
for an ideal, or acts to improve the lot 
of others, or strikes out against injus-
tice, he sends forth a tiny ripple of 
hope, and crossing each other from a 
million different centers of energy and 
daring those ripples build a current 
which can sweep down the mightiest 
walls of oppression and resistance.’’ 
Robert Kennedy might as well have 
been speaking about John Lewis that 
day in 1964, because that is what John 
Lewis did; and he was more than a rip-
ple of hope, he was a tsunami of hope. 
He was in every good cause there was, 
and he sacrificed himself physically in 
South Carolina, in Alabama, in Mis-
sissippi, for civil rights. And he sac-
rificed himself even when he was a 
Member 
of 
Congress 
for 
different 
causes, getting arrested. 
And when he was on death’s doorstep, 
he got himself to Washington, D.C., to 
appear at Black Lives Matter Plaza 
and give hope and encouragement and 
support to the young people that were 
striving for the causes that he had 
strived for his whole life.

July 22, 2020 
I value every single moment I spent 
with Congressman Lewis. It was an 
honor to know him. I miss him. 
And just the other day, I looked up at 
the scoreboard, and when I didn’t know 
quite how to vote on some issues, I 
would look to John Lewis and see how 
he voted. And he wasn’t there. 
He was my hero. 
Mr. WALKER. Mr. Speaker, I yield to 
the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. CAR-
TER), another one of Mr. Lewis’ col-
leagues. 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
Mr. Speaker, in our lives there are 
people and places we remember. I will 
always remember John Lewis. 
There are some people that you feel 
especially honored to have met. You 
feel like you are one of the lucky ones 
who had the opportunity to hear their 
stories, to learn their convictions, and 
to feel their triumphs. I believe just 
about anyone who had the opportunity 
to meet John Lewis would agree that 
he is one of those people. 
He was born the son of sharecroppers. 
He grew up on his family farm, and he 
attended segregated public schools in 
Alabama. He told the story often, and I 
remember him telling us this story, 
about how he used to preach to the 
chickens. 
He went on from that humble begin-
ning to be called one of the most coura-
geous persons the civil rights move-
ment ever produced, a title he right-
fully deserved. 
John Lewis dedicated his entire life 
to securing equality and justice for all 
people, while remaining a devoted ad-
vocate for nonviolence. It must have 
been an incredible blessing for him to 
see how his fight changed our Nation 
and the entire world with his own eyes. 
For me, it was a blessing to know 
him. His office was over in the Cannon 
Building for many years, and my office 
was in the Cannon Building. And often-
times, as we were walking over here, I 
would get to walk with him. I hung on 
every moment, on every word, just to 
have the opportunity to spend time 
with someone like John Lewis. I will 
always be grateful for those walks. 
Many of my colleagues in the Geor-
gia Delegation have mentioned the 
time that he invited us to dinner at his 
home here in Washington. What great 
stories he told that night; truly, one of 
the greatest experiences I have had 
while I have been up here in Wash-
ington, D.C. 
John Lewis was a giant among men. 
He will be deeply missed, but his legacy 
will live on forever. 
b 2000 
Mr. WALKER. Mr. Speaker, I yield to 
the 
gentleman 
from 
Massachusetts 
(Mr. MCGOVERN). 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, shar-
ing a jail cell with John Lewis was one 
of the greatest privileges of my life. 
When we were arrested for protesting 
the genocide in Darfur a few years 
back, we were put into a police van, 
booked, and fingerprinted. John had 
been arrested over 40 times for peaceful 
protests by that point, so let’s just say 
he had some advice. 
John made trouble like this because 
he knew that words aren’t enough and 
that real change requires action. He 
called it the struggle of a lifetime, but 
it was never his struggle alone. He 
challenged all of us to fight injustice 
and oppression and to stand up for civil 
rights and for human rights. 
Mr. Speaker, John was a great man. 
He was an American hero who called 
our country to a higher standard. But 
perhaps more importantly, he was a 
very good man. He treated every single 
person he met, no matter who they 
were, with dignity and respect. When 
he saw wrong in this world, he did his 
best to make it right. 
Lisa, Patrick, Molly, and I miss you 
already, John. We love you, and we will 
never stop making good trouble in your 
name. 
Mr. WALKER. Mr. Speaker, I yield to 
the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. TURNER). 
Mr. TURNER. Mr. Speaker, John 
Lewis has a true legacy of leadership in 
this House, and he changed the world 
that we live in. 
When Congressman Lewis would take 
the podium, everyone in this House 
would fall silent and listen to him. I 
doubt in his long career in this House 
that the Speaker ever had to hammer 
the House into order to listen to John 
Lewis speak. 
A man who fought for the Voting 
Rights Act, John Lewis’ legacy de-
mands that Congress act. I call on Con-
gress to pass and send to the Presi-
dent’s desk for signature the bipartisan 
H.R. 1799 renewing the Voting Rights 
Act. 
Congressman Lewis was a giant in 
history, but he was a humble man in 
this House. He treated every Member 
the same and with dignity. He will be 
missed. 
Mr. WALKER. Mr. Speaker, I yield to 
the gentleman from California (Mr. 
CA´ RDENAS). 
Mr. CA´ RDENAS. Mr. Speaker, I ap-
preciate this hour to honor one of the 
most beautiful human beings that ever 
walked this Earth. Many of us believe 
in God, and many of us try to be the 
best that we can be, but few of us are 
capable and able to live a life of true 
love and of tremendous dignity and re-
spect for every single person who 
comes our way. 
I wish I could learn how to turn my 
cheek the way John Lewis proved he 
could and did. 
I mourn his passing, but I celebrate 
the honor of knowing that he lived and 
also knowing that I could go to him on 
the floor of this House or in the hall-
ways of Congress and speak with him, 
learn from him, and then say ‘‘I love 
you, brother,’’ and then to have him 
tell me—and I selfishly relished the op-
portunity to hear him say it—‘‘I love 
you too, brother,’’ as I gave him a hug 
and he hugged me back. 
I am unfortunate that I grew up in a 
very strict household where my mother 
and father only said ‘‘I love you’’ to 
the big boys and girls and adults very 
few times. Once we got off their knee, 
it just didn’t happen very often. But 
John Lewis reminded me how much I 
missed that, and in a selfish way, that 
is one of the reasons why I always 
rushed to him and asked him, by say-
ing ‘‘I love you,’’ to know that he 
would say ‘‘I love you’’ and with all his 
heart mean it. 
I am going to miss him. Some of my 
family members were fortunate to 
meet him and to know him, and I feel 
blessed to know that he was my friend 
as well. 
May he rest in peace. 
Mr. WALKER. Mr. Speaker, I would 
like to remind if we can keep the re-
marks about 1 minute, we will get as 
many as we can in tonight. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentle-
woman from Indiana (Mrs. BROOKS). 
Mrs. BROOKS of Indiana. Mr. Speak-
er, I rise to honor and remember my 
friend, the civil rights pioneer, Con-
gressman John Lewis, a true gentle 
giant among us. 
He walked the talk, and we watched 
him walk the talk in these Halls of 
Congress for many years, from his 
years as a student at Fisk University 
to his last days as one of the most in-
fluential Members of Congress. 
He didn’t let bad actors and people 
who were trying to do him harm or 
even cancer slow him down from his 
fight for equality until the very end. 
He led many Members of Congress on 
that march in Selma, a civil rights pil-
grimage that my husband and I were 
honored to join him on a couple of 
years ago when we went to Memphis, 
Montgomery, Birmingham, and Selma. 
He walked the talk and walked with us 
and shared with us the memories of 
that painful journey for him and all of 
those students and all the people that 
he led across that bridge. He took our 
hands, and we all walked together. 
He then later that year came to Indi-
anapolis, where he was the keynote 
speaker because our community cele-
brated the Kennedy King Memorial Ini-
tiative becoming a national historic 
site. Indianapolis was the site where 
Senator Robert Kennedy informed our 
city that Dr. Martin Luther King had 
been killed on that night 50 years ago. 
It was in Indianapolis, in 1968, that 
John Lewis learned from Robert Ken-
nedy about Dr. King’s death. Dr. King 
was his friend, his mentor, and his 
hero. He had not been to this park in 
Indianapolis for 50 years, yet he came 
there as the keynote speaker. He 
brought 
together 
our 
community— 
Democrats, Republicans, Hispanics, Af-
rican Americans, and White. Everyone 
stood together to hear his words, to 
honor him, and to pay tribute to his 
legacy, to the legacy of Dr. King, and 
to the legacy of Senator Robert Ken-
nedy. 
John was our friend. He walked the 
talk. He is walking in Heaven now. He 
is showing us all how to walk the talk, 
and now it is up to us to not let him 
down.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H3682 
July 22, 2020 
Mr. WALKER. Mr. Speaker, I yield to 
the gentlewoman from Michigan (Ms. 
STEVENS). 
Ms. STEVENS. Madam Speaker, Con-
gressman John Lewis was the embodi-
ment of human prosperity as measured 
by love. Not only was he the richest 
man I have ever known, but he was ab-
solutely 
the 
most 
generous. 
John 
Lewis gave out love and, boy, did love 
come back. He was always showering 
people in love. 
When I saw him in Kentucky long be-
fore I knew I would ever join this 
Chamber at the encouragement of a 
friend from Georgia, he was talking 
about Comic-Con and that his new 
book with pictures, ‘‘March,’’ had just 
come out. 
We have so much work to do. John 
Lewis, we will heed your words. We will 
not despair. We will look up. We will 
keep moving and marching forward. We 
will pass that Voting Rights Act. And 
we will remain dedicated to your pur-
suits. 
Mr. WALKER. Mr. Speaker, I yield to 
the gentlewoman from Minnesota (Ms. 
Craig). 
Ms. CRAIG. Mr. Speaker, last week, 
our country lost a fearless fighter and 
hero for civil rights, and we in this 
Chamber lost a colleague and a friend. 
Representative John R. Lewis’ sense 
of fairness and of right and wrong was 
always ahead of his time. That sense of 
fairness extended to all civil rights 
issues. 
His willingness to support opening up 
the 1964 Civil Rights Act to add protec-
tions for the LGBTQ community was 
critical 
and 
personally 
incredibly 
meaningful to me. My colleague and I, 
over my term in Congress, found that 
we had something very important in 
common. We both were adoptive par-
ents. 
His bill, the Every Child Deserves a 
Family Act, is another example of his 
commitment to fairness, eliminating 
discrimination against the LGBT com-
munity in foster care and adoption. 
He took time to listen to my story of 
my fight to keep my son, Josh, in a 
years-long court battle. He understood 
that all that should matter is that 
children have safe, loving homes. He 
understood that right is always right. 
My heart tonight is with his family, 
and my commitment is to continue his 
work to restore and protect the Voting 
Rights Act, to address systemic rac-
ism, and to do what is kind, good, and 
just. 
Rest in power, Mr. Lewis. We promise 
to work today, next week, next month, 
and next year, just as you did for our 
lifetimes. 
Mr. WALKER. Mr. Speaker, it is my 
privilege to introduce the majority 
leader. As he is coming, I want to ex-
press to him my thanks for allowing 
me to have the honor to pray for Rep-
resentative John Lewis at his birthday 
party this past March. It is a privilege 
and a memory that I will cherish. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman 
from Maryland (Mr. HOYER). 
Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman for his remarks. 
Some in my generation remember 
the song ‘‘Abraham, Martin and John.’’ 
Then, of course, there was Bobby. All 
four were taken from us far too early 
in their lives. 
God blessed each of us, this institu-
tion, and this country by giving to 
John Lewis health for eight decades. 
He used that health and strength, mind 
and body, to serve his God, his faith, 
his country, and his people. 
I can say that John Lewis was my 
friend, but then again, we could all say 
that John Lewis was our friend and be 
right in that claim because John Lewis 
was a person who loved his fellow 
human beings. 
So many of you have heard me refer 
to John Lewis as the most Christlike 
person I have ever met. He was human, 
and he represented the best of human-
ity and all the positive attributes that 
humanity can summon. That is why 
you hear from both sides of the aisle, 
from all ideologies, from people of dif-
ferent colors, different races, different 
genders, different nationalities, and 
perhaps even different languages—cer-
tainly, different languages—for he was 
not just an American—though proud he 
was of that appellation—he was a cit-
izen of humanity. 
JIM
CLYBURN
said a little earlier 
today that we hear about Gandhi, and 
we talk about Christian values, but no 
one we know has lived and breathed 
who was those attributes, not that he 
believed in them or talked about them, 
but he embodied the best attributes 
that are in us all. 
We have a short time because time is 
limited, and so many want to speak be-
cause they were touched by John 
Lewis, because they were inspired by 
John Lewis, and because they were mo-
tivated and uplifted by John Lewis. 
Mr. Speaker, how lucky we are to be 
able to say that John Lewis was our 
friend. I knew John Lewis. John Lewis 
made a personal difference in my life 
and the lives of millions of other peo-
ple who may not even know the name 
of John Lewis. 
b 2015 
Mr. Speaker, if I had another hour or 
another day or another week, I would 
not run out of good things to say about 
John Lewis. But his life and his con-
tributions need no elevation from me 
or any others, for his life is a book of 
goodness, of courage, of commitment, 
of vision, and of great accomplishment. 
We sing the song ‘‘God Bless Amer-
ica,’’ and God blessed America and the 
world with John Robert Lewis. 
Thank you, Lord. 
Mr. WALKER. Mr. Speaker, may we 
make a commitment to make sure this 
next generation does know the name 
‘‘John Lewis.’’ 
Mr. Speaker, may I inquire how 
much time is remaining. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from North Carolina has 7 min-
utes remaining. 
Mr. WALKER. Mr. Speaker, I yield to 
the 
gentleman 
from 
Illinois 
(Mr. 
CASTEN). 
Mr. CASTEN of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, 
John Lewis was a legend. He was also 
just a man. I knew the legend, but I 
was only just getting to know the man. 
And I guess I just hope we remember 
both, because somehow the legend feels 
unattainable. 
On our best days, none of us are half 
the man that John Lewis was every 
day. And the real inspiration, I think, 
is the man, because it was that proof of 
his life that showed us our potential: if 
only we can summon his decency and 
his courage and his conviction. 
The legend was the guy whom I could 
never muster the courage to call any-
thing but Mr. Lewis. And the man was 
the guy who always said, ‘‘Just call me 
John.’’ 
The legend was the orator at this po-
dium, or that one, or the one down 
there. And the man was the guy who 
would sit there and pull me aside and 
say, ‘‘How are you doing?’’ 
But somehow, the legend and the 
man are one in the same, because it 
was a man who stood on that bridge, 
and it was a man who made all that 
‘‘good trouble,’’ and it was a man who 
showed us that the amount of love we 
can spread into this world isn’t con-
strained by our mortality, but by our 
ambition. 
Thank you, Mr. Lewis. And while I 
never quite mustered up the courage to 
say this while you were alive, thank 
you, John. 
Mr. WALKER. Mr. Speaker, I yield to 
the gentlewoman from Texas (Mrs. 
FLETCHER). 
Mrs. FLETCHER. Mr. Speaker, John 
Robert Lewis was one of the most cou-
rageous and committed citizens that 
our country has ever known. With un-
paralleled courage, with deep faith, and 
with profound hope, he personified a 
belief in this country and a belief in his 
fellow citizens all the days of his life. 
Through his life, he gave all of us a 
gift: a chance to see the world as it 
should be and a way to make it so. 
At this pivotal time in our country’s 
history, his faith in America and in 
Americans must guide us now. We have 
the opportunity and the responsibility 
as Members of Congress and as citizens 
to honor him by believing, as he did, in 
an America as good as its promise and 
by working to make it so. 
We have many miles to go to build 
the beloved community, but he showed 
us the way. How lucky we are, and how 
we miss him so. 
Mr. WALKER. Mr. Speaker, as we 
conclude this Special Order, I am most 
reminded 
by 
my 
colleagues 
this 
evening of the immense impact of a life 
that was John Lewis. 
In our current House, who can we 
think of that has more of an impact in 
the civil rights movement than John 
Lewis? 
His legacy is not simply of humility 
and kindness in the pursuit of equality, 
but one in which we should all aspire

to replicate. We have talked many 
times tonight of his nonviolent ap-
proach, but do not hesitate for one sec-
ond to think that John Lewis was not 
a strong man, a strong man with a 
lion’s heart. 
America is the greatest country in 
the world, but let’s be transparent. It 
took us a few years to really act out 
that all men were created equal. John 
Lewis dedicated his life to making sure 
this country lived up to the ideals of 
our Founding Fathers in making this 
Nation a better place for everyone. 
John was a man of faith. He grew up 
as a young preacher and later became 
an ordained Baptist minister, and I can 
relate to that. It was under this back-
ground that he began this fight for 
equality. Had the church joined him, I 
am convinced there would be less divi-
sion today. 
As a member of the Freedom Riders, 
John and his fellow Riders were sub-
jected to mob beatings and arrested for 
his efforts. Despite this opposition, he 
remained steadfast in his conviction 
and continued onward with his coura-
geous message as he pressured our Fed-
eral Government to do the right thing. 
Mr. Speaker, 25 years ago, John 
Lewis ascended to a seat in the U.S. 
Congress and continued to make ‘‘good 
trouble,’’ as he would deem it. During 
this distinguished time as a Member of 
the United States House of Representa-
tives, John left no stone unturned in 
his fight for the American people. 
As you can see this evening, Congress 
has felt this impact resoundingly. It 
has been made clear: John Lewis’ kind-
ness and humility in the many faces of 
oppression and adversity have lifted up 
Congress and America for decades. To 
say he will be sorely missed is a vast 
understatement. 
Let us continue to tell the story of 
John Lewis for generations to come. 
Remember his guidance, and let his 
presence live on in our hearts. In other 
words, let’s keep on a walkin’ and keep 
on a talkin’. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
f 
HONORING CONGRESSMAN JOHN 
LEWIS 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under 
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 3, 2019, the Chair recognizes the 
gentleman 
from 
New 
York 
(Mr. 
JEFFRIES) for 30 minutes. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. JEFFRIES. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days in which to 
revise and extend their remarks on the 
topic of tonight’s Special Order hour. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from New York? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. JEFFRIES. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today as we honor the life and legacy 
of the Honorable John Robert Lewis. I 
am thankful for my colleagues on the 
other side of the aisle, Republican Con-
ference Chair LIZ CHENEY and Repub-
lican Conference Vice Chair MARK 
WALKER, for their dual participation 
here on the House floor today, which is 
a recognition that, yes, John Lewis 
was a Democratic hero; he was a pro-
gressive hero; he was a civil rights 
hero; but above all else, John Robert 
Lewis was an American hero. 
So we are here today on the House 
floor, not as Democrats or Republicans, 
not as progressives or conservatives, 
not as the left or the right, but as 
Americans because of what John Lewis 
meant to all of us: to our communities, 
to the country, to the Constitution, to 
the principle of liberty and justice for 
all, equal protection under the law, to 
the principle of the righteous cause of 
nonviolence as a pathway to the be-
loved community, as he would share 
with all of us. 
John Robert Lewis was the connec-
tive tissue between the civil rights 
movement and the Black Lives Matter 
movement. 
John Robert Lewis was the connec-
tive tissue between the dream of Dr. 
Martin Luther King, Jr., and the Presi-
dency of Barack Obama. 
And John Robert Lewis was the con-
nective tissue between the tragedy on 
the Edmund Pettus Bridge and the 
tragedy that occurred in Minneapolis, 
Minnesota. 
John Robert Lewis’ life journey is 
the American journey, and he has guid-
ed the way as we have traveled and 
marched toward a more perfect Union; 
and through the sheer will of his mo-
rality, he has helped to bend the arc to-
ward justice. 
And so we are all thankful for his life 
and his legacy, honored by the privi-
lege to have been able to call him ‘‘col-
league.’’ 
We learned from John Lewis how to 
be a good American, a good patriot, a 
good neighbor, a good leader, a good 
human, a good activist, and how to get 
into ‘‘good trouble.’’ And so we are 
thankful for this opportunity just to 
humbly communicate what John Lewis 
meant to all of us. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the distin-
guished gentlewoman from the great 
State 
of 
Florida 
(Ms. 
WASSERMAN 
SCHULTZ). 
Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Mr. 
Speaker, I thank the gentleman for 
yielding. 
Mr. Speaker, few of us will ever leave 
the mark on history and every human 
we encounter the way our dear friend 
Congressman John Lewis did. His pro-
found generosity and goodness was so 
beautifully balanced by his courageous, 
unyielding demands for justice. 
I saw it as we sat-in on this House 
floor demanding gun safety reforms 
after the Pulse nightclub shooting. 
I saw it as young and old met him, 
sensed his moral bearing, and he pa-
tiently made each one the world’s most 
important person in that moment. 
We saw it plain as day as he bravely 
crossed the Edmund Pettus Bridge to 
confront America’s racist sins, know-
ing that batons and beatings blocked 
the pathway to justice. 
I saw it when he traveled to my dis-
trict, and the outpouring of joy and 
reverence overflowed for this truly 
good man. 
And I saw it when he took the time, 
5 seconds of his time, in that room off 
the House floor, when he recorded a 
campaign video to help my then high 
school-age daughter win her student 
government campaign, which she did. 
That is a memory that she will treas-
ure—and 
does 
treasure—throughout 
her life. 
His lifetime of ‘‘good trouble’’ is a 
model for us all, especially now as we 
must carry on his work of racial jus-
tice. The more perfect Union John 
Lewis lived in and risked his life for is 
what our Founders expressed but did 
not necessarily exemplify and one that 
future leaders must aspire to. His cour-
age and generosity are strengths we 
must all draw upon now. 
Rest in power, my friend. 
Mr. JEFFRIES. Madam Speaker, I 
yield to the gentleman from California 
(Mr. TAKANO), the distinguished chair 
of the Committee on Veterans’ Affairs. 
Mr. TAKANO. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman for yielding. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today with a 
heavy heart to honor the passion of a 
dear friend, a colleague, a personal 
hero of mine, Congressman John Lewis. 
Mr. Lewis often spoke of building a 
beloved community, one that required 
us to get into ‘‘good trouble’’ to 
achieve. His vision for America and her 
world was one of justice, equality, and 
compassion for one another. 
During dark times, his strength and 
his optimism lit the way to a path for-
ward that brought us closer to justice. 
During doubtful times, his words and 
his wisdom inspired confidence that 
progress was still in reach. 
And during this difficult time for our 
country, as we mourn his death, may 
the life and the legacy he left behind 
inspire us to keep building that beloved 
community. 
John Lewis, you taught me that opti-
mism is a moral duty, and now that 
you are gone, sir, I will no longer have 
you around to remind me to keep the 
faith. I will have to do that all by my-
self. 
b 2030 
Mr. JEFFRIES. Madam Speaker, I 
yield to the gentlewoman from Illinois 
(Mrs. BUSTOS). 
Mrs. BUSTOS. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to mourn and also to celebrate a 
historic life, a man I was honored to 
know, privileged to serve with, and to 
call my friend. 
Congressman John Lewis has been 
called home to God. I met Mr. Lewis 
right after I was elected to Congress, 
but over the years, I had the pleasure 
of getting to know him, a civil rights 
icon, a true American hero. 
Too rarely are the most powerful also 
the most humble, the most caring, and 
the most kind. But Mr. Lewis had that

rare combination and more. He was the 
best among us. 
In one moment, he would fearlessly 
stand in harm’s way to stand up for 
what is right, and in the next, he 
wouldn’t hesitate to take a minute to 
share his insights, his lessons, his per-
sonal stories with those lucky enough 
to cross his path or to walk into his of-
fice. 
In 2015, so many of our colleagues 
and I joined him for the 50th anniver-
sary walk across the Edmond Pettus 
Bridge in Selma, Alabama, to honor 
the moment that young John Lewis 
forever changed our Nation. 
As we all gathered to follow in his 
historic footsteps, the magic and the 
power of John Lewis’ action on that 
fateful day in 1965 could be felt by all 
of us. Our country is better, our Con-
gress is better, and I am better for hav-
ing known him. 
I will miss you, Mr. Lewis, but I will 
forever celebrate and honor the impact 
you made on our Nation and on me. 
Mr. JEFFRIES. Madam Speaker, I 
yield to the gentleman from New York 
(Mr. REED). 
Mr. REED. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to join with my colleagues on 
the other side of the aisle to express 
my condolences and express the spirit 
that John Lewis represented to all of 
us. 
John Lewis was a humble man. I 
knew John serving on the Ways and 
Means Committee with him. 
I traveled with my colleague, Mrs. 
BUSTOS, from Illinois down to Selma, 
Alabama, on that 50th anniversary day. 
And I will tell you, one of the moments 
that inspired me the most in my tenure 
here in Congress was not just that day, 
when we walked across the Edmund 
Pettus Bridge arm in arm in celebra-
tion of his victory over hatred, but it 
was the following day, when we sat at 
the doors of the Montgomery, Ala-
bama, State Capitol, and I saw the 
daughter of Governor Wallace express 
to John an apology for the sins of yes-
terday. And John, in typical John 
Lewis fashion, stood up and embraced 
her when she said: ‘‘I’m sorry.’’ 
John Lewis epitomizes the best of the 
human race. John Lewis was an inspi-
ration to all of us. 
My predecessor, my mentor, Amo 
Houghton, who served in my seat for 18 
years, expressed to me early on in my 
tenure: ‘‘Get to know John Lewis. Get 
to know and listen to his story.’’ And I 
will tell you, that is some of the best 
advice I received from his friend, Amo 
Houghton. 
And so I come here tonight to express 
my grief, but most importantly, my 
hope that the spirit of John Lewis does 
not die with us tonight. The spirit of 
John Lewis, who is now resting with 
the glory of God, will shine down upon 
us and improve this institution, im-
prove each of our souls, and inspire us, 
the way that he did, as that proud, 
quiet, humble giant of a human being 
that inspired me and will continue to 
inspire me to search for our better an-
gels each and every day. 
So to my colleagues on the other 
side, I join you in your grief, but we 
are united in our love for the great 
John Lewis. 
Mr. JEFFRIES. Madam Speaker, I 
yield to the gentleman from Maryland 
(Mr. RUPPERSBERGER). 
Mr. 
RUPPERSBERGER. 
Madam 
Speaker, I rise to recognize the life and 
legacy of Congressman John Lewis. 
I first met John at a church event in 
Maryland 20 years ago in Anne Arundel 
County when I was a candidate running 
for Congress. And John was there to 
support me but also there to speak to a 
junior day event. 
At that time, I first saw John speak 
and talk about his relationship with 
Dr. Martin Luther King. He recounted 
many brutal beatings and arrests that 
he endured during the height of the 
civil rights movement. From that 
point on, I considered John a mentor. 
I am fortunate to have served with 
many inspiring people, but John stands 
out as one of the finest leaders I have 
ever known. 
John encouraged us to get into good 
trouble, to make a difference. Though 
not typically my style, I was proud to 
participate in a sit-in on the House 
floor, led by John, to protest gun vio-
lence in 2016. He told me that by sit-
ting down, we were standing up for 
thousands of Americans who have lost 
their lives in mass shootings after 
mass shootings. And so I sat. 
The best way to honor John’s life and 
legacy is by continuing the fight 
against gun violence, against police 
brutality, against veteran disenfran-
chisement, against systemic racism. 
We will carry the torch for you, 
John. 
Mr. JEFFRIES. Madam Speaker, I 
yield to the gentlewoman from Penn-
sylvania (Ms. WILD). 
Ms. WILD. Madam Speaker, shortly 
after I came to Congress, I learned 
through the grapevine that a couple of 
my staff members wanted nothing 
more than to meet the great John 
Lewis in person. 
So with some trepidation, and very 
cognizant of the demands on his time, 
I approached him as a freshman Mem-
ber on the House floor to inquire 
whether I could make an appointment 
with his staff. And in his usual warm 
and gregarious manner, Mr. Lewis said: 
‘‘Of course. Of course.’’ 
A few weeks later, I took these staff-
ers on a mystery field trip to the Can-
non House Office Building. And the 
look on their faces when they realized 
we were about to enter John Lewis’ of-
fice was priceless. 
I figured it would be a quick hand-
shake and a photo op, and then we 
would be on our way back to our office. 
But no. Mr. Lewis greeted my 6-foot-4- 
inch legislative counsel Zach and my 
speechwriter Yann with: ‘‘Hello, young 
brothers’’ and took them into his office 
where he proceeded to give them a nar-
rated history of the civil rights move-
ment with the aid of large photographs 
that were stacked all over his office. 
Zach and Yann and Sara, another 
member of my team, asked many ques-
tions, and he answered them all. We 
took the obligatory photos for which I 
am thankful, because now they have 
the treasure of those memories forever. 
A full hour-and-a-half elapsed, and 
our meeting with him ended only be-
cause my team needed to get back to 
work, so we had to break away. I am 
convinced he would have gladly spent 
the rest of the afternoon speaking with 
them. That is just one example of the 
generosity of spirit of the great John 
Lewis. 
Rest in peace, Mr. Lewis. I hope you 
are starting a whole lot of good trouble 
wherever you are. It is the greatest 
honor of my life to have served with 
you. 
Mr. 
JEFFRIES. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
may I inquire as to how much time is 
remaining? 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mrs. 
AXNE). The gentleman from New York 
has 14 minutes remaining. 
Mr. JEFFRIES. Madam Speaker, I 
yield to the gentleman from Rhode Is-
land (Mr. CICILLINE). 
Mr. CICILLINE. Madam Speaker, 
John Robert Lewis, an American hero, 
a civil rights icon, a movement leader, 
a peacemaker, a teacher, a drum major 
for justice, a mentor, a colleague, and 
a friend. 
I want to begin by thanking John’s 
family for sharing him with us and 
with our country. 
As I listened to my colleagues to-
night speak about John, I realize that 
he made each one of us feel like a very 
special person to him. I also realize 
that words can’t really capture John 
Lewis and what he meant to us, to our 
country, and to the world. 
I had the privilege, like so many of 
my colleagues, of walking across the 
Edmund Pettus Bridge with John and 
listening to him speak about his work 
in the civil rights movement; to be 
part of an effort to organize a sit-in 
here on the House floor to demand ac-
tion on gun violence; to work with 
John when we played a really critical 
role in our right for passage of the 
Equality Act and made the case that 
LGBTQ Americans were entitled to full 
equality in this country; on his visit to 
Newport News, Rhode Island; or trav-
eling to South Africa to celebrate Rob-
ert Kennedy’s ‘‘Ripple of Hope’’ speech. 
John Lewis made America more just, 
he made us all more human, because he 
deeply believed in justice and equality. 
They weren’t just things that he be-
lieved in; it is who he was. 
And most importantly, he reminded 
us always to be optimistic, because he 
believed in the fundamental decency of 
every human being. And even in the 
darkest moments, he would encourage 
us: ‘‘Keep the faith, brother. Keep 
fighting.’’ 
And it is that belief in the funda-
mental goodness of everyone, that opti-
mism, that John left with us. 
And so, John, knowing you, serving 
with you, has been the greatest honor

of my life. I thank you for all that you 
have done for me and for our country, 
and we promise you that we will keep 
the faith and keep up the fight. 
Rest in peace, my friend. 
Mr. JEFFRIES. Madam Speaker, I 
yield to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. 
CHABOT). 
Mr. CHABOT. Madam Speaker, the 
word ‘‘hero’’ is used a little too often 
these days. But make no mistake, John 
Lewis personified the word. He was, 
without question, a true American 
hero. 
The fearlessness he demonstrated 
throughout the civil rights movement, 
but especially on the Edmund Pettus 
Bridge in Selma on March 7, 1965, dem-
onstrated to people across the globe 
how to stand up for equality, justice, 
and basic civil and human rights in the 
face of overwhelming odds. Quite sim-
ply, his heroic actions transformed our 
Nation and our world. 
Early on in my time in Congress, I 
had the pleasure of meeting Congress-
man Lewis for the first time. When he 
found out I was from Cincinnati, he im-
mediately asked me a question that I 
would hear from him many times in 
the coming years, how was his friend 
and fellow civil rights leader, Reverend 
Fred Shuttlesworth, doing. 
The two men had worked together 
throughout the 1960s, along with Dr. 
Martin 
Luther 
King, 
organizing 
marches, sit-ins, and freedom rides. 
Like 
John 
Lewis, 
Reverend 
Shuttlesworth remained committed to 
civil rights throughout his life and 
worked diligently to improve condi-
tions in Cincinnati. 
Not surprisingly, when I would see 
Reverend Shuttlesworth back home, he 
would ask how John Lewis was doing 
up here. As a result, I was kind of a 
messenger between these two-larger- 
than-life civil rights icons, and they 
will always be inextricably linked in 
my memory. 
Madam Speaker, the world needs 
more heroes like John Lewis and the 
Reverend Fred Shuttlesworth. Now, 
more than ever, their dedication to 
overcoming inequality and changing 
hearts and minds through nonviolent 
protests points the way forward as we 
continue to strive to come together 
and achieve a more perfect Union. 
Mr. JEFFRIES. Madam Speaker, I 
yield to the gentlewoman from Vir-
ginia (Ms. SPANBERGER). 
Ms. SPANBERGER. Madam Speaker, 
I rise tonight to remember Congress-
man John Lewis. 
And for me, the best way to honor 
the memory of this beautiful man, this 
kind soul, our colleague, our friend, 
and for so many of us, our teacher, is 
to share his best lessons. 
And in his 2017 book, Congressman 
John Robert Lewis said the following: 
‘‘Freedom is not a state; it is an act. 
‘‘It is not some enchanted garden 
perched high on a distant plateau 
where we can finally sit down and rest. 
‘‘Freedom is a continuous action we 
must all take, and each generation 
must do its part to create an even more 
fair, more just society.’’ 
These are words to drive our work 
and our lives. And he spoke them to 
the world. 
But to us, on June 4, on a call with so 
many of our colleagues, he told us: ‘‘Be 
brave. Don’t get weary. Let’s continue 
to work.’’ 
And I wrote those words down, be-
cause like everything John Lewis said, 
they struck me as powerful and impor-
tant and worth remembering. And in 
his memory and in his honor, we 
should all do just that, continue to 
work. 
b 2045 
Mr. JEFFRIES. Madam Speaker, I 
yield to the distinguished gentlewoman 
from Florida (Ms. MUCARSEL-POWELL). 
Ms. MUCARSEL-POWELL. Madam 
Speaker, it is difficult to express the 
immense loss and pain that not just 
myself but that this body feels at the 
passing of our good friend, John Lewis. 
It has been one of my greatest honors 
and privileges to be able to serve along-
side him in my short time here in this 
body and to get to know him. He 
brought to us courage. He inspired love 
and gave us optimism in some of the 
most difficult times. 
He worked with joy in his heart, with 
courage and faith, and without fear. He 
was a fighter against injustice to any-
one. I remember him saying that he 
was inspired to see the young men and 
women of all backgrounds, creeds, and 
religious backgrounds rise up in non-
violent protest, demanding justice. I 
wonder if he knows that he started 
that back in 1965 in Selma, Alabama. 
My kids, Jude and Siena, every time 
they came to Washington, they always 
sought out John Lewis because they 
looked up to him, just like all of us did. 
It is silly that I am crying, Madam 
Speaker. I just met him a year ago. I 
think it is because, during some of the 
most difficult moments in our country, 
we can’t afford to lose someone like 
him. 
But I am so inspired today to hear 
my colleagues stand together in unity, 
and I know, and I am filled with opti-
mism, that we will be able to exemplify 
his work, continue his work, and carry 
his dream of a better America forward. 
Mr. JEFFRIES. Madam Speaker, I 
yield to the gentleman from Wash-
ington (Mr. KILMER). 
Mr. KILMER. Madam Speaker, when 
you meet your hero and they turn out 
even more amazing than you expected, 
it is really cool. That was my experi-
ence getting to work with John Lewis. 
In fact, sometimes when he spoke in 
Caucus, I would find myself texting a 
colleague, saying: You work with John 
Lewis. 
The last time many of us heard his 
voice was early this summer on a Cau-
cus conference call. He spoke up and 
said that he was sad because he was re-
minded that we weren’t as far on the 
path to justice as any of us want our 
country to be. But then he said he was 
hopeful because people, and particu-
larly young people, were speaking up, 
standing up, and working for change. 
In 2019, I brought one young person, 
my daughter, Sophie, to Selma, Ala-
bama. We crossed Edmund Pettus 
Bridge with him. We listened to his 
stories. He was so kind to her and so 
patient with her questions. At the end 
of the trip, Sophie approached him at 
the airport, and she thanked him. 
She said: I have one more question. 
He said: Go ahead. 
And she said: Were you ever scared? 
And he said to her: You know, I was 
scared. But I knew I was doing the 
right thing, and I knew there were oth-
ers who were depending on me standing 
up for them, too. 
He stood up for so many for so long. 
One of the honors of my life was to get 
to serve with this extraordinary man, 
even watching him preside over the 
House as we passed a new Voting 
Rights Act. 
His legacy of peace and love, of fight-
ing for justice, fighting for voting 
rights, and of causing good trouble will 
live on. 
Rest in peace and rest in power, Mr. 
Lewis. 
Mr. JEFFRIES. Madam Speaker, I 
yield to the gentleman from Rhode Is-
land (Mr. LANGEVIN). 
Mr. LANGEVIN. Madam Speaker, 
from the moment I arrived in Congress, 
the aura of John Lewis loomed large. 
He will rightfully be remembered as a 
giant of the civil rights movement and 
the conscience of the Congress. 
To me, though, he will always be re-
membered as a man who I felt privi-
leged and honored and humbled to call 
colleague and friend. He will always be 
remembered as the kind, humble, ap-
proachable gentleman from Georgia, a 
tireless fighter who rallied our Caucus 
at pivotal moments to make positive 
change, to stand for what is right, to 
give a voice to the powerless, to pro-
tect the rights of the disenfranchised. 
Of course, he was well-known for mak-
ing noise and getting into good trouble, 
necessary trouble. 
It was one of the great privileges of 
my life to join John Lewis in making 
some good and necessary trouble when 
he organized a peaceful sit-in on the 
House floor to demand action on gun 
violence. 
John Lewis made a difference in the 
lives of millions, and his presence was 
always felt in Congress, but his absence 
will be felt even more. 
Rest in peace, my friend. 
Mr. JEFFRIES. Madam Speaker, how 
much time do we have remaining? 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from New York has 1 minute 
remaining. 
Mr. JEFFRIES. Madam Speaker, let 
me simply close this portion of our spe-
cial hour in honor of our friend, our 
colleague, our mentor, our hero, the 
legendary John Lewis, by simply re-
counting his words: Never give up. 
Never give in. Keep the faith. Keep 
your eyes on the prize. And make some 
good trouble.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H3686 
July 22, 2020 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
f 
PAYING TRIBUTE TO 
CONGRESSMAN JOHN LEWIS 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under 
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 3, 2019, the Chair recognizes the 
gentleman 
from 
Georgia 
(Mr. 
WOODALL) for 30 minutes. 
Mr. WOODALL. Madam Speaker, I 
very much appreciate the time tonight 
to honor one of Georgia’s favorite sons. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tlewoman from Illinois (Ms. SCHA-
KOWSKY). 
Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Madam Speaker, 
one of the greatest honors of my life 
has been to serve alongside John Lewis 
in this House of Representatives. John 
was my friend, and I know that thou-
sands of people say the same thing, and 
guess what? They are all right. 
John was my leader. I sat down in 
the well of this House with him in the 
morning, and we didn’t get up again 
until the next morning because we 
were fighting, with him in the lead, to 
end gun violence. I got arrested with 
John Lewis, he probably for the 60- 
something time and me for the first, 
because we were fighting for immigra-
tion reform. 
My husband and I had the honor of 
walking behind John to cross the Ed-
mund Pettus Bridge three different 
times at a place where the State troop-
ers in Alabama nearly took his life. 
Over the years in our Democratic 
Caucus meetings, there was a tone that 
would get gloomy sometimes, and 
those were John Lewis moments. John 
would stand up and, in no uncertain 
terms, he would remind us of our mis-
sion. What people really wanted to 
hear from us, he told us, was hope, and 
no one could deliver hope like John 
Lewis. 
I give you his words, words we needed 
to hear: Do not get lost in despair. Be 
hopeful. Be optimistic. Our struggle is 
not a struggle of a day, of a week, of a 
month, or of a year. It is the struggle 
of a lifetime. 
Mr. WOODALL. Madam Speaker, I 
yield to the gentleman from Illinois 
(Mr. SCHNEIDER). 
Mr. SCHNEIDER. Madam Speaker, I 
count among my life’s greatest bless-
ings the distinction of being able to 
call John Lewis my colleague and my 
friend. 
Martin Luther King said the moral 
arc of the universe bends toward jus-
tice. John Robert Lewis spent his en-
tire life working to accelerate and 
complete that bend fully committed to 
justice, to nonviolence and, in his own 
words, to good trouble. 
John Lewis’ incredible capacity for 
love, 
his 
steadfast 
belief 
in 
non-
violence, and his limitless humility in-
spired all of us, Democrat and Repub-
lican, to be better. His singular char-
acter established him as the conscience 
of the Congress. 
I have too many personal stories to 
share in a short 1-minute speech, 
enough stories, in fact, to more than 
fill the entire hour. I will hold each of 
these treasured memories in my heart 
for the rest of my life. 
I join with my colleagues to honor 
his legacy and together hope we will 
continue his work bending that arc to-
ward justice. 
Rest in peace, John, knowing your 
memory will be a blessing to your Na-
tion 
and 
to 
all 
whose 
lives 
you 
touched. 
Mr. WOODALL. Madam Speaker, I 
yield to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. 
BRADY), the former chairman of the 
Ways and Means Committee, the com-
mittee on which John Lewis did so 
much of his important work for the 
great State of Georgia. 
Mr. BRADY. Madam Speaker, John 
Lewis was many things. He was a fa-
ther. He was a Congressman. As you 
know, he was a civil rights pioneer who 
marched with Martin Luther King, Jr. 
He was a husband. He was a son of the 
South, one who walked in the wind to 
bring equality to America and is now 
walking in the heavens with his Cre-
ator. He was a colleague. 
John was all these extraordinary 
things, and he was also my friend. We 
are a better Nation and a better people 
because of him. This institution, of all 
of our country, will miss him dearly. 
I always struggle to explain back 
home just what an extraordinary per-
son he was. To know John was a bless-
ing. To get to work with him on so 
many important issues on the Ways 
and Means Committee, including the 
first reform to the IRS in over two dec-
ades, making important improvements 
to Medicare for our seniors and those 
who need our help the most, that was 
an honor of a lifetime. 
I served with him on the Ways and 
Means Committee for many years. He 
was a warm, needed, inspirational pres-
ence in that storied committee room. 
When I look down the dais, I will be sad 
to miss my friend. But I will always be 
proud to have had the privilege of 
working with such a remarkable spirit. 
Each day he walked in these halls, we 
all witnessed firsthand his remarkable 
integrity, his intelligence toward the 
complex policy issues we debate, and 
his willingness to work across the aisle 
if it means Americans will have greater 
dignity, opportunity, and equal rights. 
God loved this remarkable servant, 
and I know John is walking hand-in- 
hand with God and his beloved Lillian 
today. 
I miss you, John. Cathy and I will 
continue to pray for you and all those 
who call you family. May you rest in 
peace and rise in glory. God bless you. 
Mr. WOODALL. Madam Speaker, I 
yield to the gentleman from Michigan 
(Mr. LEVIN). 
Mr. LEVIN of Michigan. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today in honor of our 
friend 
and 
colleague, 
Congressman 
John Lewis. 
With every march, every sit-in, every 
time we reject unjust rules and institu-
tions designed to oppress any group, we 
honor the legacy of John Robert Lewis. 
A record number of Americans have 
stood up, spoken up, and laced up their 
marching shoes in recent weeks. Mil-
lions of them are too young to know 
about the man in whose footsteps they 
are following as they make what he so 
rightly called good trouble. 
b 2100 
May we all model his grace, courage, 
kindness, and commitment to non-
violence as a way of life and continue 
the good trouble he started even 
when—especially when—it is unpopu-
lar. 
I feel so much gratitude to have 
learned from this giant of history, this 
singular American genius, and to have 
served, however briefly, alongside him. 
His loss is devastating. His memory ev-
erlasting. 
Rest in power, my beloved brother. 
Mr. WOODALL. Madam Speaker, at 
this time, I yield to the gentleman 
from Tennessee (Mr. COOPER). 
Mr. COOPER. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman for yielding. 
No one loved Nashville, Tennessee, 
more than our friend and colleague 
John Robert Lewis. 
As a young man, he arrived in Nash-
ville on a bus with a ticket purchased 
by the Reverend Dr. Martin Luther 
King, Jr. Dr. King wanted young John 
to attend American Baptist College. 
For anyone wondering how to honor 
John Lewis and his legacy, think of his 
alma mater, American Baptist, and re-
member also the historically Black 
college and university that he later at-
tended, Fisk University. If you want 
more John Lewises in the world, think 
of his beloved training grounds, Amer-
ican Baptist and Fisk. 
Mr. WOODALL. Madam Speaker, I 
yield to the gentlewoman from Oregon 
(Ms. BONAMICI). 
Ms. BONAMICI. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman for yielding. 
I rise today with a heavy heart to 
honor the life of Representative John 
Lewis, whose passing is a tremendous 
loss for Congress and for the entire 
country. 
I will always remember walking 
across the Edmund Pettus Bridge with 
him on the 50th anniversary of Bloody 
Sunday. I took my son with me on that 
trip, and when John passed last week-
end, my son said this: ‘‘He is the most 
memorable person I have ever met. I 
will never forget what it feels like to 
be in the same room as him.’’ 
We will never forget what it felt like 
to serve in the same Chamber as him. 
And as the Nation reckons with cen-
turies of systemic racism, we owe a 
great debt to John Lewis and the ‘‘good 
trouble’’ he made in the civil rights 
movement, past and present. If we only 
had half his courage. 
We as a Congress and we as a country 
would be better if we all exemplify his 
kindness, his passion, and his stoic 
ability to remain calm in any kind of 
storm. I can hear his voice urging us: 
Never give up, never give in, and al-
ways keep the faith.

July 22, 2020 
Rest in peace, rest in power, John 
Lewis. 
Mr. WOODALL. Madam Speaker, I 
yield to the gentlewoman from Cali-
fornia (Ms. BARRAGA´ N). 
Ms. BARRAGA´ N. Madam Speaker, 
like so many here tonight, I was in-
spired by John Lewis and his lifelong 
fight for our country to live up to its 
ideals to be more tolerant, more just, 
and more equal. 
He was fearless. He sacrificed his 
body, bloodied by billy clubs and beat-
ings from police, in hopes that future 
generations of people of color would 
not have to. 
He was my hero. I called him ‘‘Mr. 
Lewis’’ when I first arrived to Con-
gress, and I will never forget, he would 
say, ‘‘Call me John.’’ He was so humble 
and supportive. 
Hearing John Lewis tell firsthand 
stories of the fight for civil rights was 
a 
privilege. 
Walking 
the 
Edmund 
Pettus Bridge with him was something 
I will never forget. 
We will honor his life by continuing 
to, and as he said, cause ‘‘good trouble, 
necessary trouble, and help redeem the 
soul of America.’’ 
As he wrote: ‘‘Freedom is the contin-
uous action we all must take, and each 
generation must do its part to create 
an even more fair, more just society.’’ 
We will try. 
Thank you, John. 
Mr. WOODALL. Madam Speaker, I 
yield to the gentleman from Wash-
ington State (Mr. HECK). 
Mr. HECK. Madam Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman for yielding. 
Early in my service, I got out of the 
car in the parking garage to walk into 
Cannon, and Mr. Lewis walked up be-
hind me. I turned and he said: ‘‘Good 
morning, my brother.’’ I opened the 
door to try to point for him to enter 
first, and he said: ‘‘You first, my broth-
er.’’ 
I often heard him refer to my col-
leagues as ‘‘my brother’’ or ‘‘my sis-
ter,’’ and for a while I actually was 
fooled into thinking that was because 
he hadn’t yet learned our named. But 
that wasn’t it. He knew. It was more a 
sign of respect and affection and mutu-
ality. 
No one has ever walked in this Cham-
ber on this floor, before, now, or in the 
future, who will ever command the love 
and reverence of him, because he was a 
great man. 
Godspeed to you in your journey, 
John Robert Lewis, my brother. 
Mr. WOODALL. Madam Speaker, I 
yield to the gentlewoman from Okla-
homa (Ms. KENDRA S. HORN). 
Ms. KENDRA S. HORN of Oklahoma. 
Madam Speaker, I thank the gen-
tleman for yielding. 
It is my honor to rise today to recog-
nize, honor, and celebrate the life, leg-
acy, and impact of Congressman John 
Lewis. 
Of those who have left their mark on 
history, the unique and indelible im-
print of John Lewis stands in a cat-
egory all its own. His strength, cour-
age, commitment, compassion, kind-
ness, and fierce determination to chal-
lenge injustice made the world a better 
place for all of us and truly bent the 
arc of history ever closer to justice. 
John showed us that being bold and 
standing up for those whose voices 
aren’t heard are inextricably linked 
with the need for compassion and hope. 
Though I don’t think any of us were 
ready to let him go—I know I certainly 
wasn’t—I simply cannot imagine the 
world had he not been in it. And it is 
one of the greatest honors of my life to 
be able to have served with him and to 
call him a colleague and to join him on 
the civil rights pilgrimage last year, as 
I know many voices have said before. 
And it was on this journey that I had 
the opportunity to share with him a 
blessing that had been bestowed upon 
me that I believe embodies the life and 
the lessons and the legacy of John 
Lewis that I will share today in his 
Honor. 
‘‘May God bless you with a restless 
discomfort about easy answers, half- 
truths, and superficial relationships, so 
that you may seek truth boldly and 
love deep within your heart. 
‘‘May God bless you with holy anger 
at injustice, oppression, and exploi-
tation of people so that you may tire-
lessly work for justice, freedom, and 
peace among all people. 
‘‘May God bless you with a gift of 
tears to shed with those who suffer 
from pain, rejection, starvation, or the 
loss of all that they cherish so that you 
may reach out your hand to comfort 
them and transform their pain into 
joy. 
‘‘May God bless you with enough 
foolishness to believe that you really 
can make a difference in this world so 
that you are able, with God’s grace, to 
do what others claim cannot be done.’’ 
Thank you, Mr. Lewis, for living 
those lessons and those words. God-
speed. 
Mr. WOODALL. Madam Speaker, I 
yield to the gentlewoman from Con-
necticut (Ms. DELAURO), a cardinal on 
the Appropriations Committee. 
Ms. DELAURO. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman for yielding. 
In October 1995, the Black clergy in 
my community asked if I could get 
Congressman John Lewis of Georgia to 
come to New Haven for our local elec-
tions. I was honored to welcome John 
to my hometown. Here is what I said 
about him that evening. 
‘‘John Lewis is a true hero of the 
cause of progress. It is often said that 
John Lewis is ‘one of the most coura-
geous persons the civil rights move-
ment ever produced.’ The most aston-
ishing thing about that sweeping state-
ment is that it probably doesn’t go far 
enough to describe the heroics of the 
man you see before you. John Lewis 
has dedicated his life to protecting 
human rights, securing personal dig-
nity, and building what he likes to call 
‘The Beloved Community.’ His display 
of ethics and morality has won him 
rare admiration from both his House 
colleagues and from leaders around the 
world over.’’ 
He thanked me for the introduction, 
and he said to the congregation, ‘‘I love 
my sister ROSA DELAURO.’’ 
And I loved that our offices, when I 
first came to the Congress, were next 
to each other. 
I served with Congressman John 
Lewis for 30 years, and I consider my-
self blessed. My grandchildren, Teo, 
Rigby, Sadi, and Jasper, met John 
Lewis. He signed for them his book, 
‘‘March.’’ 
John Lewis’ ‘‘March’’ tells the story 
of a poor sharecropper’s son who trans-
formed America and so much more. 
There are few in the world who change 
it. John Lewis changed it. 
The Black clergy in my community, 
my grandchildren, my family, you can 
be sure we will carry on your work, 
John Lewis. Count on it. 
Mr. WOODALL. Madam Speaker, I 
yield to the gentleman from Massachu-
setts (Mr. MOULTON). 
Mr. MOULTON. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman for yielding. 
When I was younger, we seemed to 
have a lot of American heroes around, 
from the Greatest Generation that won 
World War II to the civil rights leaders 
of the 1950s, to the men who walked on 
the Moon. To call one of them a col-
league was one of the greatest honors 
of my life, and it hit me every day I 
saw John Lewis on the House floor. 
‘‘Good morning, sir,’’ was may usual 
greeting. Not because of my Marine 
background or his age—most people in 
Congress are older than me—but sim-
ply because there is nobody in Congress 
who had more respect. Nobody. 
But he was much more than just a 
towering figure. He was a loving, car-
ing, indefatigably optimistic friend and 
mentor, especially to young people like 
me. 
John and I took bets on the 2017 
Super Bowl, with the winner commit-
ting to visiting the loser’s district. 
After the Patriots had the greatest 
comeback in Super Bowl history, we 
started talking dates for his trip to 
Massachusetts. But with a few con-
flicts and his getting older, I proposed 
an alternative: a visit to some of the 
civil rights sites in his hometown. 
Through all the turmoil of the last 
few years, there are only two times I 
have cried in Congress: visiting the 
prison in Hanoi with John McCain and 
visiting Atlanta with John Lewis. 
If you ever doubt what a hero John 
and his fellow American patriots were, 
spend some time in Atlanta or Bir-
mingham or Selma, where he came 
within an inch of his life fighting to 
uphold a nation’s ideals even when the 
nation said they don’t apply to you or 
your family. 
I found myself wondering if I would 
have had the courage to join in those 
protests to be a freedom fighter, to 
change a nation. That is what John 
Lewis did. He changed America, and in 
so doing, he changed the world. 
And he never lost faith in either as 
he did it.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H3688 
July 22, 2020 
During the impeachment trial, I 
asked him if he had ever seen it this 
bad. And while he told me never, not 
even during the civil rights movement, 
because he said there was more hope, 
more movement, he nonetheless main-
tained his characteristic optimism and 
looked at me confidently like a preach-
er to his Sunday school student and 
said: But, don’t worry. We will get 
through it. Keep the faith, brother. 
Keep the faith. 
We miss you, John. 
b 2115 
Mr. WOODALL. Madam Speaker, I 
would inquire how much time remains. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from Georgia has 8 minutes re-
maining. 
Mr. WOODALL. Madam Speaker, I 
yield to the gentlewoman from Penn-
sylvania (Ms. DEAN). 
Ms. DEAN. Madam Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman for yielding. 
Madam Speaker, like many others in 
this Chamber, the last time I heard Mr. 
Lewis’ voice was on a Caucus call re-
cently. Congressman Lewis implored 
us: Be bold. Be brave. Keep the faith. 
Keep your eyes on the prize. Keep 
working. There is much work to be 
done. Don’t get weary. Continue the 
work. 
John Lewis was a hero to all of us for 
causing ‘‘good trouble’’ and for stand-
ing on the right side of history, for 
standing for our common humanity. 
His humility, strength, and belief in 
the greatness of this country never fal-
tered. What a blessing it has been to 
me to serve with him. 
I had the privilege of being with him 
on a visit in Florida to the detention 
camp where immigrant children were 
kept separated from their parents, and 
through an interpreter, he spoke to the 
children. 
He had two messages. So whether he 
was speaking to us in Congress or to a 
President or to children, his message 
was the same, and the same was: Be-
lieve in the promise of America. Keep 
the faith. Be bold. Don’t be disturbed. 
His other message, his second mes-
sage, was one of welcome, and the 
beaming children loved that. He said: 
Welcome to America. We welcome you. 
His was a memory of kindness and 
humility and optimism for a better 
place, an America that was promised in 
our founding documents. 
On many occasions, we have fallen 
short, short of the American promise of 
equality and justice for all. Mr. Lewis’ 
scars revealed that. 
His memory will be a beacon for jus-
tice and equality and for the unfinished 
business of the people to be a country 
of mercy, of decency, and of love. 
Thank you, Mr. Lewis. Lucky us to 
have passed this way with you. 
Mr. WOODALL. Madam Speaker, I 
didn’t have the 52-year relationship 
with Mr. Lewis that SANFORD BISHOP 
talked about earlier. I wasn’t even born 
when that relationship started. This 
very powerful and imposing face beside 
me, I have very little association with. 
If Mike Collins goes back and looks 
in the files, I believe he will find that 
they turned down a young man named 
ROB WOODALL for a job back in 1994. It 
wasn’t that I didn’t try to get a good 
mentorship from John Lewis, I just 
didn’t meet the John Lewis bar at that 
time. 
But my experience with him has been 
Biblically based, as so many have. But 
mine has been: Let the children come 
to me. Do not hinder them, for to such 
belongs the kingdom of God. 
If I could arrange it, I would walk 
down the steps behind John as he was 
going down the Capitol steps after a 
vote, because children from all over 
the country would come running up, 
‘‘Mr. Lewis, Mr. Lewis,’’ just wanting 
to say hello. 
Whether it was the steps of the Cap-
itol, the busiest airport in the world at 
Hartsfield International, or anywhere 
in between, I never once saw John in 
too much of a hurry with too much on 
his mind to take the time to make sure 
the next generation understood what 
happened in the last generation and 
the difference they could make for yet 
another generation. 
The story has already been told that 
staff members would say the only thing 
they want to do on Capitol Hill is meet 
Mr. Lewis before they leave. 
Time and time again, that is the 
story of any Georgia Member because, 
growing up, Mr. Lewis was Mr. Lewis. 
He always says, ‘‘Call me John,’’ but he 
is always Mr. Lewis and always will be. 
So much of the story that we have 
heard told about John tonight, Madam 
Speaker, has been about John the 
fighter. It is so meaningful to me that 
the other half of the stories we have 
heard tonight are about John the em-
bracer. 
We have plenty of fighters in this in-
stitution, and we have our fair share of 
embracers in this institution. We don’t 
have as many folks who are every bit 
as good at embracing as they are at 
fighting. 
We will miss John’s leadership in 
that respect in the great State of Geor-
gia, Madam Speaker, and we will miss 
him here in this institution. 
Madam Speaker, I thank my col-
leagues for coming out tonight, I know, 
to honor their friend and their col-
league, but certainly to honor our 
great son from Georgia. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.

HONORING CONGRESSMAN JOHN 
ROBERT LEWIS 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Ms. 
JACKSON LEE). Under the Speaker’s an-
nounced policy of January 3, 2019, the 
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
Massachusetts (Ms. CLARK) for 30 min-
utes. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Ms. 
CLARK 
of 
Massachusetts. 
Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous con-
sent that all Members may have 5 leg-
islative days in which to revise and ex-
tend their remarks on the topic of to-
night’s Special Order. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from Massachusetts? 
There was no objection. 
Ms. 
CLARK 
of 
Massachusetts. 
Madam Speaker, what a privilege it 
has been not only to serve with John 
Lewis, but to be witness tonight to the 
remembrances of our icon, the peace-
maker, the justice seeker, Congress-
man John Robert Lewis. 
Personally, I never got used to work-
ing with John Lewis, and I struggled to 
call him ‘‘John.’’ 
I met him right after I got sworn in, 
in a special election, near the chair in 
which he often sat. I was completely 
tongue-tied. 
Whether it was a casual hello, a walk 
back and forth from the Capitol for 
votes, or planning a sit-in, every single 
interaction with John was profound. 
John knew oppression and he knew 
racial violence. He had been beaten, 
clubbed, spat on, and denigrated. John 
had experienced the worst forms of big-
otry. He had seen the worst in people, 
and yet it steeled his determination 
and it deepened his faith. 
John Lewis is the kindest man I have 
ever known. Love, compassion, integ-
rity were the hallmarks of everything 
he did, big or small. 
Like so many of you, I was fortunate 
enough to be able to go to Selma on 
several occasions with John and walk 
the Civil Rights Trail. 
To hear John Lewis speak on the Ed-
mund Pettus Bridge is transformative. 
That bridge is an unusual structure. It 
has a steep rise as it comes up, it flat-
tens in the middle, and then there is a 
steep descent. 
I could imagine John Lewis, as I saw 
him speak from that bridge, being a 
young man leading, with Hosea Wil-
liams, a column of 600 marchers and 
getting to the middle of that bridge 
and for the first time being able to see 
what awaited them, the sea of State 
troopers, of angry crowds. I am sure he 
could feel the violence in the air like 
electricity. 
But John did not turn back. He did 
not falter in the face of hatred and of 
violence. He was fortified by the moral 
clarity of why he was marching: to en-
sure that every American had the right 
to vote. 
And we know what happened. We 
know they were beaten, trampled, and 
gassed. 
But 
they 
reconvened 
and 
marched to Montgomery and made the 
Civil Rights Act the law of the land. 
Today we find ourselves again in this 
country in the middle of the bridge, 
and we can see the danger ahead. We 
can see those who seek to divide this 
country, suppress the vote, and cut off 
opportunity. While John Lewis cannot 
physically lead us across that bridge, 
he has taught us what to do. 
Many of us have referenced what 
would be the last words for us to hear 
from John Lewis, and he spoke, as al-
ways, inspirationally about the true

sorrow he felt for the soul of America, 
that in the wake of the brutal murder 
of George Floyd we were not in a better 
place, and that those poisonous, toxic 
roots of slavery still entangled our in-
stitutions and our Nation. 
But he also said to us that he had 
never been more optimistic, watching 
the peaceful protesters across this 
country assemble. 
He told us, as he always did, to be 
bold, to not be weary. He told us that 
the winds of change are blowing. 
So we must honor him by continuing 
our work, by unfurling those sails to 
catch that wind, and to live for justice; 
to see, as he saw, the divinity in not 
only John Lewis, but in all of us; and 
to know that, collectively, we can con-
tinue the march that he started for us, 
and we can bring this country to live 
up to the ideals of justice and equality 
for all. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman from California (Mr. RUIZ), a 
distinguished Member. 
Mr. RUIZ. Madam Speaker, when I 
stood in John Lewis’ presence, I stood 
in awe, in reverence, and with great re-
spect. 
John Lewis was an extraordinary 
man of faith, perseverance, virtue, and 
kindness. He endured ridicule and beat-
ings during his nonviolent fight along-
side Dr. King. 
He spent a lifetime fighting against 
injustices, poverty, white supremacy, 
and racism, and for equality and 
human dignity. He was a social justice 
and civil rights warrior who inspired 
me, all of us in this Chamber and this 
Nation. 
He was a man of God on a relentless 
mission of peace to create the kingdom 
and bring to Earth life as it is in Heav-
en. 
As great a man as he was, he was al-
ways humble and gentle. He was al-
ways faithful in his fight for freedom 
from oppression. 
John was also a friend. He always 
asked how my daughters, Sky and 
Sage, were doing on the House floor 
and in the hallways, and even visited 
them during their birthday parties in 
my D.C. office. 
He will undoubtedly be greeted in 
Heaven by our creator with the words, 
‘‘Job well done, my humble servant,’’ 
an honor well-deserved and greater 
than life itself. 
May John Lewis rest in God’s al-
mighty power. 
I love you and I miss you, brother. 
Ms. 
CLARK 
of 
Massachusetts. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman 
from 
New 
York 
(Mr. 
ESPAILLAT). 
Mr. ESPAILLAT. Madam Speaker, I 
represent the 13th Congressional Dis-
trict in New York. It has many wonder-
ful neighborhoods in it, the iconic 
neighborhood of Harlem, which has 
given birth to many luminaries, includ-
ing the great late Adam Powell and, of 
course, the Lion of Lenox Avenue, 
Charles B. Rangel. 
But when I came here, Madam Speak-
er, there sat John Lewis in his dig-
nified serenity. He brought to this 
Chamber and he bore the wounds and 
the scars of a struggle over 400 years 
old, and they could not be ignored. 
Even in his dignified serenity, beyond 
his great words that were conciliatory 
and peaceful in scope, the scars and the 
wounds of the struggle that he bore in 
this august Chamber could not be ig-
nored. 
b 2130 
So, Madam Speaker, I say to John 
Lewis today, that from Harlem, and 
from all the Harlems in all the States 
of this great Union, a very important 
message I bring to this floor. 
Rest in peace, great warrior. 
Ms. 
CLARK 
of 
Massachusetts. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the distin-
guished gentleman from the great 
State of Florida (Mr. SOTO); and I 
would ask my colleagues to keep their 
comments to 2 minutes. 
Mr. SOTO. Madam Speaker, Mr. John 
Lewis has often been called the con-
science of the Congress. 
He also led our Democratic Caucus 
during some of our toughest moments. 
In 2017, there was a strong effort to re-
peal the Affordable Care Act. We were 
in the minority. We were demoralized. 
Things seemed hopeless. 
It was in this darkest hour that the 
legendary John Lewis thundered; chan-
neling Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., he 
said, We may have all come on dif-
ferent ships, but we are all in the same 
boat now. We have to stick together. 
We have to stand up. We have to do 
what is right. Millions of Americans 
are counting on us. 
And as he thundered those words, 
chills ran down my spine, and a moral 
righteousness took over me as he 
brought our entire caucus to our feet. 
And we fought the good fight, though 
we lost the vote in the House. But we 
still inspired the American people. 
The effort to repeal ObamaCare ulti-
mately failed in the Senate, and Mr. 
John Lewis lit the spark with his 
words, his spirit, and his courage. 
Rest in power, Mr. Lewis. 
Ms. 
CLARK 
of 
Massachusetts. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the distin-
guished gentleman from New York (Mr. 
TONKO), my good friend. 
Mr. TONKO. Madam Speaker, I thank 
the gentlewoman for yielding. 
It is with the heaviest of hearts that 
I stand in tribute to Congressman John 
Robert Lewis this evening. 
Brother John, your imprint on my 
heart and soul is forever. 
The loss of John Lewis has left us 
with a deep, unanswerable sadness, and 
a resolve that will echo in this Cham-
ber and within all of our hearts forever. 
Time and again, John gave us the 
gift of his courage and lit our path 
with a humble but fierce moral light. 
He risked everything to teach us, to re-
mind us what it really means to fight 
for liberty and justice for all; and why 
we must fight on, even after our great 
champion has fallen. 
My thoughts, my prayers, and my 
heart go out to John’s family, to Mi-
chael, and his staff, his community, 
and all who knew and loved this giant 
of a man. 
May John’s light always fill the halls 
of our Capitol. May his hope guide our 
hands, and his vision for a more perfect 
Union continue to inspire us with time-
less faith and purpose. 
Of late, when I would talk to Brother 
John, he had a concern that those 
wheels of progress toward a more per-
fect Union might roll backward. We 
cannot tolerate that. Brother John 
taught us that; that we will only go 
forward. 
So if we truly loved this man, if we 
truly want to honor his spirit, let us 
make certain that those wheels of 
progress toward a more perfect Union, 
in fact, go forward and upward. 
God bless you, my friend. You walked 
so humbly with your God. Rest in 
peace. Rest in power, my dear and so 
noble of a friend. 
Ms. 
CLARK 
of 
Massachusetts. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the distin-
guished gentlewoman from California 
(Ms. SPEIER). 
Ms. SPEIER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
to celebrate the life of a man I loved, 
our colleague, John Robert Lewis. 
To John-Miles, his son, to Michael 
Collins, his remarkable and devoted 
chief of staff, to his entire staff, we 
grieve with you. 
When I think about John Lewis, and 
to describe him: 
A commitment to God? Immovable. 
A commitment to believe that we are 
all equal before God? Immutable. 
Belief that the law must support the 
biblical belief in the equality of all 
mankind? Unyielding. 
Because his great-grandfather was 
the victim of grave injustice, he didn’t 
have to watch a movie to hear the call 
of a slave master’s voice in the wind. 
He rebelled against that voice to de-
liver justice during his life. 
In the 1960s, he was deemed a radical, 
a radical with a passionate belief in 
peaceful civil disobedience, so much so 
that he was arrested 40 times and beat-
en multiple times. 
John knew that the televised images 
of police beatings and cracked skulls 
animated the just souls of 1965 to build 
a chariot of liberty in the Civil Rights 
Act of that era. 
John wept at the sight of George 
Floyd being murdered, but also saw 
that another moment to create a more 
just and perfect Union was upon us. 
In the coming days, when the streets 
are filled with those who mourn John, 
we will see people in fine suits and peo-
ple in rags. We will see laborers and 
professionals. We will see faces pained 
by disease or poverty. But all of them 
will rejoice that John Lewis lived. 
There will never be another John 
Lewis. In fact, I believe no Member of 
Congress is greater than the John 
Lewis that has walked across the 
threshold of this Chamber. 
God rest, good man. You changed our 
country. You were a purveyor of good 
trouble. You taught us what was non-

negotiable. You changed this country 
forever more. 
I will end with his quote, and he said: 
‘‘I say to people today, you must be 
prepared if you believe in something. If 
you believe in something, you have to 
go for it. As individuals, we may not 
live to see the end.’’ 
Well, my dear friend, you may not 
see the end, but before this year is 
over, the John Lewis Voting Rights 
Act of 2020 will be delivered; and I hope 
someday a statue of you will be in 
Statuary Hall so we can all pass by it 
and touch your shoes and have your 
spirit fill our hearts. 
God rest your soul. Rest in power. 
Ms. 
CLARK 
of 
Massachusetts. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the distin-
guished 
gentleman 
from 
California 
(Mr. SHERMAN). 
Mr. 
SHERMAN. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
John R. Lewis honored us with his 
presence on this floor for over 3 dec-
ades. That a man of such courage and 
such accomplishment would dedicate 
so much of his life to this House con-
firmed the decision of all of us to give 
up our private lives and private meas-
ures and to spend our time here in the 
people’s House. 
Five years ago, I was honored to go 
to TERRI SEWELL’s hometown of Selma 
and on the 50th anniversary to walk 
with John Lewis across the Edmund 
Pettus Bridge where, 50 years prior to 
that time, John Lewis had been beaten 
down and his skull fractured. We 
walked forward across that bridge with 
John Lewis, and with the President of 
the United States, President Barack 
Obama, to prove that America walks 
forward, and that the progress that we 
have made cannot be turned back. 
Years later, many of us joined John 
on this floor to make some good trou-
ble when we took over the floor of this 
House to demand a vote on common-
sense gun control. 
President Barack Obama, when he 
awarded John the Presidential Medal 
of Freedom, said: ‘‘Generations from 
now, when parents teach their children 
what is meant by courage, the story of 
John Lewis will come to mind; an 
American who knew that change will 
not wait for some other person or some 
other time, whose life is a lesson in the 
fierce urgency of now.’’ 
And that is why I say now is the time 
to pass what should be called the John 
R. Lewis Voting Rights Act. John 
Lewis was too great a man for us to 
fail to provide a substantive memorial. 
Ms. 
CLARK 
of 
Massachusetts. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the distin-
guished gentleman from New Jersey 
(Mr. GOTTHEIMER). 
Mr. GOTTHEIMER. Madam Speaker, 
as someone who was on the battlefield 
of nearly every civil rights fight of the 
last century, Mr. John Lewis taught us 
that our Nation is always a work in 
progress, always perfecting our Union. 
Through it all though, regardless of 
what he faced, John Lewis always 
walked gracefully with the wind, fol-
lowing the words of Isaiah: ‘‘They shall 
mount up with wings like eagles; they 
shall run and not be weary; they shall 
walk and not faint.’’ 
My friend, our hero, John Lewis 
never grew weary, no matter what the 
fight, including his last. 
It was a remarkable blessing, as we 
heard tonight, from so many, to serve 
with your hero, to have him meet and 
hug your children, to meet a true 
American hero. There was none like 
him in this Chamber, and I think there 
never will be. 
I will never forget the last hug that I 
got from him when I told him how 
much he meant to me; how much I ap-
preciated his counsel; when he visited, 
how much I appreciated him coming to 
my district to speak with my commu-
nity, and just all he did for all of us. 
And he whispered back, as he said to 
so many others, ‘‘Just stay strong, my 
brother.’’ 
Mr. Lewis, that is the least we can do 
for you is to always stay strong. 
Congressman Lewis was an American 
icon, as we all know. But he was a 
gentle giant, and his life’s work will 
live on forever. His presence, his hum-
ble kindness will always loom large 
over this House and over our great Na-
tion. 
As Congressman Lewis said: ‘‘If you 
see something that is not right, not 
fair, not just, you have a moral obliga-
tion to do something about it.’’ And I 
think we all need to remember that, es-
pecially now. I know that I will. 
Thank 
you, 
Congressman 
John 
Lewis, our friend. God bless you. 
Ms. 
CLARK 
of 
Massachusetts. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the distin-
guished gentlewoman from Iowa (Mrs. 
AXNE). But please, I urge my col-
leagues, our time is very short. We 
want everyone to be able to speak, so 
please try to keep your comments 
under 2 minutes. One minute would be 
preferable. 
Mrs. AXNE. Madam Speaker, tonight 
I had the rare privilege to preside over 
the House as our colleagues spoke 
about our beloved colleague, John 
Lewis, an honor I will remember for 
the rest of my life. 
And as I turned to hear the stories 
from both Republicans and Democrats, 
I was struck by the sentiments over 
and over about how John not only gave 
them hope, but made them better 
human beings because of his silent 
strength, his hopeful nature, and his 
love for all, even in the face of despair. 
b 2145 
As a new Member who is truly here 
because I believe there is need for more 
good trouble in this world and the need 
for those who will stand up for what is 
right, I am blessed to have been in 
John’s presence and to have learned 
from him even in quick moments on 
the floor. His hope was contagious, as 
was his love for God, our country, and 
his fellow Americans. His enduring 
teachings will live on in all who seek 
out justice. 
God bless John Lewis, God bless his 
family, and may he live in peace and 
power. 
Ms. 
CLARK 
of 
Massachusetts. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the distin-
guished Member from New Mexico (Mr. 
LUJA´ N). 
Mr. LUJA´ N. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today in remembrance of our friend 
and colleague John Lewis, the gen-
tleman from Georgia, a great man, a 
treasure, and our brother. 
Congressman Lewis spent his life 
fighting for justice. When Mr. Lewis 
spoke, he did so with a force and moral 
clarity. 
He was an original freedom fighter 
who embodied what it means to be a 
humble public servant. 
John never let anything stand in the 
way of doing what was right. His leg-
acy will continue by the generations of 
brothers and sisters he inspired to get 
in good trouble. 
It was a blessing to have known Con-
gressman Lewis, and I know his light 
will continue shining bright in the 
courage and conviction of the Amer-
ican people. As we lay our friend to 
rest, the torch of justice shines bright. 
Let us honor Congressman Lewis by 
continuing his fight. 
Rest in power, my friend. 
Ms. 
CLARK 
of 
Massachusetts. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman from Maryland (Mr. RASKIN). 
Mr. RASKIN. Madam Speaker, I 
thank Ms. CLARK for organizing this 
beautiful observance and testimony to 
our beloved colleague. 
I want to praise John Lewis, not the 
Congressman, but John Lewis the 
member of SNCC, the Student Non-
violent Coordinating Committee, a rel-
ative handful of students who began a 
process that transformed America for-
ever and brought down the walls of 
American apartheid and Jim Crow 
through the extraordinary force of 
their physical courage, their moral 
courage, and their political courage to 
confront an entire system of racism 
bearing down upon them. 
The end of their struggle was non-
violence, to create a nonviolent society 
committed to justice and equality for 
everyone, and the means of arriving at 
that 
nonviolent 
society 
was 
non-
violence itself. So even as the sheriffs 
and police officers unleashed the Ger-
man shepherds and the billy clubs on 
them, the water hoses and the teargas, 
they still remained remarkably non-
violent the entire way there. 
I asked John Lewis when we got to 
travel down South on the civil rights 
tour with the Faith and Politics Insti-
tute about where he thought things 
were. I think he felt that, in terms of 
civil rights, we have been moving 
things forward, but in terms of vio-

streets. And we talked about domestic 
violence. 
I want to say that the spirit and the 
memory of John Lewis live in this body 
and this institution, which loves him. 
But I see the spirit of John Lewis 
today in the streets with the hundreds 
of thousands and millions of young 
Americans who are demanding non-
violent, 
just, 
and 
peaceful 
trans-
formation of our society. John Lewis 
lives in the young people today, and he 
would be so proud of the young people 
of America. 
Ms. 
CLARK 
of 
Massachusetts. 
Madam Speaker, it is difficult to close 
such a remembrance and a celebration, 
and we will never close the chapter on 
our friendship, admiration, and rev-
erence for John Lewis. But John Lewis, 
for me, has always been the embodi-
ment of the words of Micah 6. John has 
shown us what is good: to love justice, 
love mercy, and walk humbly with 
your God. 
Rest in peace, power, and glory, 
Brother John. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.

PUBLICATION OF BUDGETARY 
MATERIAL 
REVISION TO THE AGGREGATES, ALLOCATIONS, 
AND OTHER BUDGETARY LEVELS FOR FISCAL 
YEAR 2021 
COMMITTEE ON THE BUDGET, 
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, 
Washington, DC, July 22, 2020. 
MADAM SPEAKER: Pursuant to the Congres-
sional Budget Act of 1974 (CBA), the Bal-
anced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control 
Act of 1985 (BBEDCA), and the Bipartisan 
Budget Act of 2019 (BBA), I hereby submit 
for printing in the Congressional Record a 
revision to the aggregates and allocations 
set forth in the statement of aggregates, al-
locations, and other budgetary levels for fis-
cal year 2021 published in the Congressional 
Record on May 1, 2020. 
This revision is for allowable adjustments 
for amounts for wildfire suppression, pro-
gram integrity, Overseas Contingency Oper-
ations, and disaster relief, pursuant to sec-
tion 251 (b) of BBEDCA, as provided in bills 
reported by the Committee on Appropria-
tions. The amounts for wildfire suppression 
are contained in the text of H.R. 7612, the De-
partment of the Interior, Environment, and 
Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2021. 
The amounts for program integrity are con-
tained in the text of H.R. 7614, the Depart-
ments of Labor, Health and Human Services, 
and Education, and Related Agencies Appro-
priations Act, 2021. The amounts for Over-
seas Contingency Operations are contained 
in the text of H.R. 7617, the Department of 
Defense Appropriations Act, 2021. Finally, 
the amounts for disaster relief are contained 
in the texts of H.R. 7668, the Financial Serv-
ices and General Government Appropriations 
Act, 2021 and H.R. 7669, the Department of 
Homeland Security Appropriations Act, 2021. 
Accordingly, 
I 
am 
revising 
aggregate 
spending levels for fiscal year 2021 and the 
allocation for the House Committee on Ap-
propriations for fiscal year 2021. For pur-
poses of enforcing titles III and IV of the 
CBA and other budgetary enforcement provi-
sions, the revised aggregates and allocations 
are to be considered as aggregates and allo-
cations included in the budget resolution, 
pursuant to the statement published in the 
Congressional Record on May 1, 2020. 
Questions may be directed to Jennifer 
Wheelock or Raquel Spencer of the Budget 
Committee staff.

S4363 
Vol. 166 
WASHINGTON, WEDNESDAY, JULY 22, 2020 
No. 129 
Senate 
The Senate met at 10 a.m. and was 
called to order by the President pro 
tempore (Mr. GRASSLEY). 
f 
PRAYER 
The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, of-
fered the following prayer: 
Let us pray. 
Eternal spirit, grant to this Nation 
and to all people a social conscience 
built on the vision of the ancient 
prophets who saw sufficiency for every 
person and a time when anxiety would 
overcome chaos and hopelessness. Has-
ten the day when the small and weak 
can make their contributions alongside 
the great and powerful. Lead us to the 
day when we will see peace among the 
Nations of the Earth, when swords 
shall be beaten into plowshares. Use 
the Members of this body to bring us to 
the time when Your will is done on 
Earth, even as it is done in Heaven. 
Lord, we trust You with our future. 
Let Your glory cover the Earth as the 
waters cover the sea. 
We pray in Your mighty Name. 
Amen. 
f 
PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE 
The President pro tempore led the 
Pledge of Allegiance, as follows: 
I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the 
United States of America, and to the Repub-
lic for which it stands, one nation under God, 
indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mrs. 
LOEFFLER). The Senator from Iowa. 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I 
ask permission to speak for 1 minute in 
morning business. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
f 
SREBRENICA 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, 
there is an area in Bosnia that goes by 
the name of Srebrenica. This month is 
the 25th anniversary of a massacre that 
took place there. It happens to be the 
worst genocide on European soil since 
the Holocaust. 
Twenty-five years ago, 8,000 Bosnians 
were murdered out of ethnic and reli-
gious hatred. Many Bosnians, who wit-
nessed this horrific atrocity, became 
refugees and found a home in my State 
of Iowa. We must remember for those 
Bosnians, Iowans, and for all Bosnians 
who suffer as they continue to deal 
with unimaginable memories. It is also 
important for the rest of us to make a 
point of remembering what has hap-
pened so we can prevent it from hap-
pening again. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President, 
I ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
f 
RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY 
LEADER 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ma-
jority leader is recognized. 
f 
NATIONAL DEFENSE 
AUTHORIZATION ACT 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President, 
this week, the Senate will pass the 60th 
annual National Defense Authorization 
Act. Every year, this legislation lets 
the Senate make our top priorities for 
protecting our homeland, our allies, 
and our global interests into law, and, 
certainly, the recent behavior of our 
adversaries world over shows why this 
task is as urgent as ever. 
Even as our Nation is focused on 
fighting the pandemic at home, our 
servicemembers have contended with 
dangerous 
behavior 
from 
would-be 
competitors all around the world. The 
Russian military has kept probing the 
bounds of U.S. airspace, and Putin’s re-
gime has kept its sights on cyber war 
and destabilization by proxy. 
China 
continues 
to 
treat 
inter-
national commercial lanes like its own 
private pond, choke freedom and au-
tonomy out of Hong Kong, and try to 
ethnically cleanse Xinjiang. 
Both countries continue to mod-
ernize their military capabilities from 
sea to space. And Iranian meddling, 
North Korean saber-rattling, and the 
persistent violence of terrorist groups 
like ISIS and al-Qaida demand our at-
tention as well. 
Amid these threats and many others, 
the American people and the entire 
free world look to the men and women 
of the U.S. military to preserve order 
and peace. The open and bipartisan 
process led by Chairman INHOFE and 
Ranking Member REED has produced 
strong legislation that will advance 
their missions. 
It is the product of intense com-
mittee work; it contains more than 200 
bipartisan amendments; and it builds 
on the historic progress which this ad-
ministration and this Republican Sen-
ate have secured over the past 3 years. 
After years of cuts to our military 
that weakened readiness, imperiled 
modernization, and called into ques-
tion our commitment to preserving our 
global interests, we have reversed the 
tide. We have invested in strength. We 
built a new national defense strategy 
and are investing in rebuilding and 
modernizing 
our 
military 
to 
help 
achieve it. 
This 
legislation 
will 
carry 
the

not controversial. It is a no-brainer.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S4364 
July 22, 2020 
on the far left is sparking some truly 
extraordinary 
behavior 
among 
our 
Democratic colleagues. 
Case in point, later today, we will 
vote on an amendment that was adver-
tised in an opinion essay by the junior 
Senator from Vermont titled ‘‘Defund 
the Pentagon: The Liberal Case.’’ This 
is the junior Senator from Vermont— 
an essay titled ‘‘Defund the Pentagon: 
The Liberal Case.’’ 
You heard correctly. We have moved 
on from defunding local police to 
defunding the U.S. Armed Forces. 
Maybe we will be sending social work-
ers on overseas deployments, when 
they aren’t too busy responding to vio-
lent crimes. I am not sure. Senator 
SANDERS’ amendment would literally 
decimate the defense budget. It would 
rip 10 percent of it right out and pour 
the money into all the socialist fan-
tasies—free rent, free college, free ev-
erything for everyone. 
Now, in light of the long-held views 
of our colleague from Vermont, a pro-
posal like this may not be particularly 
shocking. What is remarkable is that 
the Democratic leader—the leader of 
their caucus—felt pressured into en-
dorsing it. 
Let me say that again: The Demo-
cratic leader, who in almost every floor 
speech tries to accuse this administra-
tion of being too soft on America’s ad-
versaries, wants to literally decimate 
our defense budget to finance a social-
ist spending spree. 
This turns out to be something of a 
pattern. On the Democratic side, it 
sometimes seems like we have hawks 
when it comes to speeches but chickens 
when it comes time to make policy. 
When they are on the sidelines, there is 
plenty of bark, but whenever they ac-
tually call a shot, there is zero bite. 
Lots of bark, little bite; all hat, no cat-
tle. 
That is how we end up with spec-
tacles like the Democratic leader play- 
acting as a Russian hawk, when about 
a decade ago, he was publicly arguing 
we should cozy up to Putin, send Rus-
sia billions of dollars of cash, pull the 
plug on NATO missile defense pacts 
that hurt Putin’s feelings, and concede 
to him, ‘‘Russia’s traditional role’’ in 
the Caspian Sea region. 
That was the Democratic leader in 
2008. Pay off Putin, and let him have 
his sphere of influence. And now today, 
he wants to decimate defense spending. 
But in between, he spent years insist-
ing 
that 
Democrats 
want 
to 
get 
tough—want to get tough on foreign 
policy. 
You see how the game works: sound 
like hawks on television, act like 
chickens when making policy. 
Defense spending demonstrates our 
will to defend ourselves and our inter-
ests in a dangerous world. Keeping our 
Nation safe is our foremost constitu-
tional duty. We cannot shirk it. 
My colleagues who profess concern 
over Putin’s efforts to interfere in our 
politics, or Xi’s efforts to rewrite the 
rules of the international system, must 
know that we will never—never be able 
to deter such behavior if we sell our 
own soldiers short and surrender our 
technological edge. 
I assure you, Beijing and Moscow will 
be watching this vote. I ask my col-
leagues on the other side of the aisle to 
reject this far-left fantasy. Defeat this 
amendment. Throughout the Cold War, 
we maintained a bipartisan commit-
ment to American strength, American 
alliances, and a global peace built on 
American values. We will reinforce 
that stand when we sink—sink the 
reckless Sanders-Schumer amendment 
and again when we pass this bipartisan 
bill. 
f 
FREE SPEECH 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President, 
on a final matter, since the spring, our 
Nation has engaged in important con-
versations about racial justice in polic-
ing. 
Most people understand that con-
tinuing 
our 
Nation’s 
tremendous 
progress toward justice does not mean 
battling against American principles or 
American history. Progress means ful-
filling our values, not attacking them. 
Yet a group of radicals have latched 
onto this moment to say we should re-
pudiate our country itself. We have 
watched as mobs have dragged statues 
of Washington, Jefferson, and Grant 
through the dirt. And, in parallel, in-
side many elite institutions, self-styled 
intellectuals say we should similarly 
discard the basic principles they fought 
for. 
One of the key pillars of our Nation 
is the rule of law. In a civilized society, 
the same laws need to apply to every-
one. The times our Nation has fallen 
short on this score, particularly for all 
the years when Black Americans were 
completely denied the equal protec-
tions of law, it has been to our great 
shame. This has been central to the 
cause of civil rights. There is a reason 
the 14th amendment insists on ‘‘the 
equal protection of the laws.’’ 
Yet, in recent months, local leaders 
have violated this basic tenet. As riots 
rocked major cities, we saw politicians 
decline to act. They seem to fear far- 
left critique more than looting and 
chaos. And we saw the uneven applica-
tion of other rules, like when mayors 
cheered on mass demonstrations but 
continued to prohibit religious gath-
erings. That is the rule of law in jeop-
ardy. Of course, the last example is 
also a First Amendment issue. And the 
freedom of expression itself is another 
principle that has come under threat. 
As I said a few weeks back, this goes 
deeper than just constitutional law. 
America has always prized the spirit of 
the First Amendment. We citizens 
must want to protect an open, civil dis-
course—a true marketplace of ideas. 
But, lately, the political left has em-
braced something totally different. 
Today’s far left is not interested in 
winning debates with better argu-
ments. They prefer to shut down de-
bate all together. They don’t try to win 
the contest. They just harangue the 
referees to stop the game. If they don’t 
like an op-ed, they want it unpub-
lished. If they don’t like a tweet, they 
want to track down the author and get 
them fired. If they don’t like a tenured 
professor, they throw around Orwellian 
accusations that his or her ideas make 
them feel unsafe. 
This hostile culture is getting re-
sults. According to one brand-new sur-
vey, it is only the far-left Americans 
who do not feel compelled to self-cen-
sor their views because of a hostile cli-
mate. Everyone but the left feels the 
threat. 
And 
50 
percent 
of 
self-identified 
strong liberals say that simply contrib-
uting to the Republican Presidential 
candidate ought to be a fireable offense 
for a business leader. Let me say that 
again. Fifty percent of self-identified 
strong liberals say that simply contrib-
uting to the Republican Presidential 
candidate ought to be a fireable offense 
for a business leader. In this country? 
We recently saw the New York Times 
apologize for publishing a straight-
forward policy argument from a U.S. 
Senator. Since, an editorial staffer re-
signed from the paper because even 
center-left opinions were not liberal 
enough and led to her constant harass-
ment. That was a recent editorial staff-
er resigning from the New York Times 
because her center-left opinions were 
not liberal enough and led to her con-
stant harassment at the times. You 
see, the safe spaces only go in one di-
rection. 
On elite campuses such as Princeton, 
we see faculty turning on their tenured 
colleagues and even administrators 
weighing in to chastise people with un-
popular views. 
We see online platforms such as 
Facebook threatening to ban political 
advertising altogether, chilling our de-
mocracy, because far-left employees 
and outside pressure groups berate 
them for letting the very speakers use 
their platform. 
Even at a time when there is signifi-
cant appetite in Congress to take a sec-
ond look at the legal protections af-
forded to those supposedly neutral 
platforms, they still contemplate giv-
ing an angry minority of agitators a 
veto over Americans’ political speech. 
The author Salman Rushdie, who was 
himself threatened with death for con-
troversial speech, once said this: 
Two things form the bedrock of any open 
society—freedom of expression and rule of 
law. If you don’t have those things, you don’t 
have a free country. 
Free expression and the rule of law— 
exactly the two things we have seen 
eroded in recent months. 
Rushdie recently signed an open let-
ter with other intellectuals—many lib-
erals—sounding the alarm on this cul-
tural poison. ‘‘Editors are fired,’’ they 
wrote, ‘‘books are withdrawn . . . jour-
nalists are barred from writing on cer-
tain topics . . . professors are inves-
tigated . . . steadily narrow[ing] the

Well, you can guess what happened 
next. The grievance industrial complex 
came after the letter itself. The au-
thors were accused of advancing big-
otry and the cycle of nonsense started 
all over again. 
The United States of America needs 
free speech. We need free expression. 
And all of us, from all perspectives,

RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
Democratic leader is recognized. 
CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, 
Democrat Senators returned to Wash-
ington on Monday prepared to work in 
a bipartisan way on the next phase of 
coronavirus relief. 
After 
stalling 
for 
months 
while 
COVID–19 surged in more than 40 
States, Senate Republicans finally said 
that now—the end of July, more than 3 
months after the CARES Act passed— 
would be the time for another emer-
gency bill. But here we are. It is in the 
middle of the week, and the Republican 
Party is so disorganized, chaotic, and 
unprepared that they can barely cobble 
together a partisan bill in their own 
conference. 
Indicative was Leader MCCONNELL’s 
speech. He rants and raves about the 
New York Times and cancel culture, 
but there is not a word about COVID. 
People are ready to lose their unem-
ployment benefits, to lose their apart-
ments and be evicted. Local govern-
ments are laying off people because 
they don’t have the dollars. We are in 
a national crisis. 
We don’t hear a word out of Leader 
MCCONNELL as we are on the edge of so 
many cliffs. Instead, there is lots of 
talk about the New York Times and 
cancel culture. That may be fodder for 
the far right. That is not what America 
needs. 
When Leader MCCONNELL, at this cru-
cial 
moment, 
can’t 
even 
mention 
COVID–19, it shows what a knot the 
Republicans are tied in. The bottom 
line is this: The White House Chief of 
Staff said Republicans ‘‘were on their 
own 20 yard line’’ when it comes to 
their legislative proposal—their own 
20-yard line, 2 months and a week after 
we passed the COVID 3 bill, after mil-
lions more Americans applied for un-
employment, after many small busi-
nesses went under, and many more died 
and were hospitalized as COVID–19 
rages in many Southern States. We are 
still on the 20-yard line? Where have 
the Republicans been? 
I have never seen a political party in 
the middle of a crisis so tied in a knot 
that the majority leader can’t even 
mention it in his speech and spends 
time ranting against favorite targets of 
the far right and can’t come up with a 
proposal. 
This is not a game. This isn’t typical 
Republican dysfunction about whether 
or not they did or didn’t see the Presi-
dent’s last tweet. The disarray on the 
Republican side has real consequences. 
Americans will suffer unnecessary pain 
and uncertainty because of it. 
The only reason there hasn’t been an-
other relief package in Congress al-
ready is due to this Republican incom-
petence and reckless delay. Even after 
all of these months, the White House 
and Senate Republicans are starkly di-
vided about what to do. The White 
House is insisting on policies, like a 
payroll tax cut, that would do nothing 
to help millions of unemployed Ameri-
cans and that many Senate Repub-
licans don’t even support. The Repub-
licans can’t even seem to agree on 
whether to provide any new aid for 
State and local governments or if the 
States should be able to more flexibly 
use the support we have already given. 
A few of my friends on the other side 
of the aisle hardly want to spend any 
more money to help our country in this 
once-in-a-generation crisis because it 
might add to the national debt. Giant 
corporate tax cuts—$1.5 trillion to $2 
trillion of them—are OK, but fighting 
the greatest public health crisis in a 
century and forestalling a depression is 
a bridge too far? Where are the prior-
ities on the other side of the aisle? I 
guess they are for helping big cor-
porate fat cats—wealthy people—but 
not average people who are hurting. 
That is the trouble with the Repub-
lican Party. 
Seriously, there are only 3 weeks left 
until the August work period, and the 
Republicans are still in the opening 
phases of preparing their bill. We don’t 
have time for this mess that the Re-
publicans are in. The moratorium on 
evictions that we passed in the CARES 
Act expires in 2 days. The Wall Street 
Journal reports that nearly 12 million 
adults live in households that missed 
their last rent payments and that 23 
million have little or no confidence in 
their ability to make the next ones. 
Next week, the enhanced unemploy-
ment benefits we passed in the CARES 
Act will expire while 20 to 30 million 
Americans will still be without work. 
A recent study showed that those en-
hanced benefits prevented nearly 12 
million Americans from slipping into 
poverty—12 million. Yet, because the 
Republicans can’t get their act to-
gether, those benefits might expire 
next week. 
Congress needs to act quickly. The 
Senate Republicans and the White 
House need to get on the same page, 
produce a proposal—not just drop it on 
the floor but start negotiations. Better 
yet, we could start negotiations on the 
Heroes Act, which already passed the 
House, and, unlike the developing Re-
publican proposal, it would actually 
match the scale of this crisis. 
Speaker PELOSI and I met yesterday 
with Chief of Staff Meadows and Sec-
retary Mnuchin. Even with all of this 
chaos, we have had some indications 
about what the Republicans are trying 
to do in their bill. Over the weekend, 
we heard that the administration was 
trying to block additional funding for 
coronavirus testing and contact trac-
ing. President Trump has also ended 
the CDC’s data collection efforts, po-
tentially risking access to data that 
public health experts so vitally need. 
So, when we met with Chief of Staff 
Meadows 
and 
Secretary 
Mnuchin, 
Speaker PELOSI and I told them to 
back off these counterproductive and 
dangerous ideas. 
In addition, we will be sending a let-
ter to the administration to demand 
answers on how data is being reported 
to the White House, as well as pushing 
for legislation in the upcoming bill to 
ensure that COVID–19 data is fully 
transparent 
and 
accessible 
without 
there being any interference from the 
administration. 
We know Donald Trump likes to hide 
the truth. He thinks, when the truth 
doesn’t come forward and when he 
muzzles government officials, that it 
changes things. It doesn’t. The virus 
still rages and will rage unless we do 
something about it, not simply hide 
the statistics that show his depth in 
mendacity. We will make sure that 
those statistics are made public so all 
of America, including the President, 
will know how bad the situation is, be-
cause that is what we need—the truth 
to set us free and then to act on it. Let 
me repeat: If the administration re-
fuses to reverse course, the Democrats 
will insist on data transparency in the 
next COVID relief bill.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S4366 
July 22, 2020 
All of our efforts to bolster the econ-
omy, help the unemployed, save small 
businesses, and ensure our children are 
safe at school will be meaningless if we 
don’t stop the spread of the virus. Hid-
ing COVID data from the CDC, as well 
as foot-dragging on more testing and 
tracing, is absolutely incomprehensible 
and imperils everything else we are 
working on. So we need to make a law, 
and we need to make it soon. Right 
now, the infighting and partisanship on 
the Republican side and cockamamie 
ideas, like hiding data from the CDC, 
are only adding to the delay. 
We also saw the return of President 
Trump’s coronavirus press briefings 
yesterday. It is remarkable that Presi-
dent Trump has lowered the bar so 
much that his performance yesterday 
was seen as a change in tone. It is a 
very sad state of affairs in our country 
when one day of the President’s read-
ing statistics is hailed as leadership 
when that is what he should have been 
doing all along. The mere acknowledg-
ment by the President that COVID–19 
is raging through our country is some 
kind of breakthrough. Is that what 
people believe? Is that what Trump 
wants the people to believe? It is crazy. 
The truth is, every time the Presi-
dent takes the podium, he is a risk to 
public health. We are 6 months into the 
coronavirus, and the President has 
only just come around to the idea that 
wearing masks would be a good idea. 
He deserves criticism for that belated 
admission, not praise. We are 6 months 
into the crisis, and the President said 
yesterday that his administration is in 
the process of developing a strategy 
that is going to be very, very power-
ful—6 months in. Countries in Europe 
and East Asia developed national test-
ing regimens ages ago. That is why 
they are way ahead of us in fighting 
this crisis. 
Americans must be hanging their 
heads in shame and disbelief that this 
administration is still trying to sort 
out the basics. Then, when he says he 
is going to try and sort out the basics 
months and months too late, as the cri-
sis has raged, people think he should 
get praise? No, he should be criticized 
because he hasn’t done what he was 
supposed 
to 
have 
been 
doing 
for 
months. 
President Trump started his press 
conference by labeling COVID–19 the 
‘‘China virus,’’ which shows the Presi-
dent is still trying to deflect blame and 
play political games with this deadly, 
serious virus—games that are divisive. 
The truth is, more than anything or 
anybody else, the responsibility for 
America’s failure to deal competently 
with COVID–19 falls squarely on Presi-
dent Trump’s shoulders. It is long past 
time for the President to start acting 
like it. 
I yield the floor. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
Democratic whip. 
Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I 
read this morning that more Ameri-
cans have died in the last 3 months 
than in any 3-month period in the his-
tory of the United States. That is a 
stunning statistic. We are searching 
the records to make sure that it is an 
accurate statement, and I am afraid it 
is. 
So far, we believe 140,000 Americans 
have died of this COVID–19 crisis that 
we are facing. This is not a moment of 
American greatness. They have just 
done a review of the nations across the 
world and the safety of living in those 
nations that face this pandemic. Where 
does the United States rank among the 
nations of the world in terms of safety 
in dealing with the coronavirus? It 
ranks 58th—two ranks ahead of Russia. 
How could we have reached this mo-
ment in time when this pandemic has 
been so devastating in the United 
States, more so than in many other 
countries around the world—countries 
that are supposedly not even close to 
us in terms of economic development 
and strength? They have handled this 
far better than the United States. Yet 
what are we doing about it now? It is a 
valid question. 
I know that the President has de-
cided he doesn’t want the likes of Dr. 
Tony Fauci by his side any longer 
when it comes to talking about this 
pandemic, but Dr. Fauci and Dr. Col-
lins, of the National Institutes of 
Health, were interviewed over the 
weekend and were asked directly about 
the issue of testing. 
Why does it take so long in the 
United States to get results, and what 
kind of problems does that create? 
Well, we know. If people suspect they 
are positive for this virus and go in for 
a test, they are worried that they may 
be endangering their own lives, not to 
mention the lives of others. Then, they 
have to wait 1 day, 2 days, 3 days, 6 
days—more—for the test results. That 
is unacceptable. We need to invest 
more money in testing and more 
money in finding tests to provide 
quicker results. 
You would think that it would be ob-
vious to everyone, but it is not obvious 
in this negotiation that is taking place 
now in the U.S. Senate. There are Re-
publican Senators who are resisting 
the idea of putting more money into 
testing in the United States. What 
country do they live in? Do they ever 
go home from Washington to see what 
is happening in the rest of this coun-
try? We closed down the testing facili-
ties in my hometown of Springfield, IL, 
this last week. It was disappointing, 
for we needed it, and we need more. 
If we are serious about opening this 
economy, if we are serious about stop-
ping the spread of this pandemic, and if 
we are serious about opening our 
schools and making certain that teach-
ers and pupils are safe, we need more 
testing. Yet here we are, tied in knots, 
as Senator SCHUMER said earlier. 
The Republicans can’t agree among 
themselves about the issue of putting 
money into testing in the midst of this 
pandemic. It is hard to believe. It was 
more than 2 months ago that the House 
of Representatives passed the Heroes 
Act. Senator MCCONNELL has come to 
the floor regularly to ridicule that ef-
fort because he doesn’t like the provi-
sions in the act. It is his right to have 
a difference of opinion, but the obvious 
questions to Senator MCCONNELL are 
these: Where is your alternative? What 
have you been doing for the last 2 
months? You should have been writing 
a bill that we should be voting on as 
soon as we finish the one that is pend-
ing on the floor. 
Apparently, the White House and the 
Senate Republicans can’t come to any 
agreement about how to move forward. 
There are some who are basically say-
ing: Enough. We are not going to spend 
another penny. We are not going to 
waste any more money on any type of 
COVID–19. 
I have seen their testimony. I have 
seen their statements before the micro-
phones. That is hard to imagine. 
I wonder if some of the Senators from 
States like Kentucky and Texas who 
have stepped up and said, ‘‘We have 
spent enough money on this,’’ have 
been home recently. Have they been 
there to meet people who are unem-
ployed, out of work, or who have been 
laid off who are receiving the Federal 
unemployment benefits to keep bread 
on the table and to pay for the their 
mortgages and their health insurance? 
This $600 a week may sound like a 
pretty generous amount of money to 
some. Try living on it. Try living on 
$600 a week when it costs you $400 a 
week for health insurance. Yes, that is 
the average on COBRA premiums—al-
most $1,700 a month. So, when you talk 
about $600 a week, take out $1,600 or 
$1,700 off the top of that, and tell me 
what is left to take care of your fam-
ily. 
As for the last Federal unemploy-
ment payment under the CARES Act, 
Senator SCHUMER is right. It ends on 
July 31—a week from Saturday. We 
have been told that the last checks will 
be mailed this Saturday, which is just 
a few days from now. 
Three days from now, the last check 
goes out. While that check is making 
its way through the mail, is it even 
possible that the Republican leader-
ship, with the White House, will come 
up with a proposal to deal with this? It 
has been 2 months. Senator MCCONNELL 
said, during those 2 months, that he 
didn’t feel any sense of urgency—no 
sense of urgency. Can you imagine the 
sense of urgency if you can’t make 
your mortgage payment? Can you 
imagine the sense of urgency if that 
utility bill is so large you can’t pay it? 
That is the reality facing a lot of fami-
lies who have been laid off and are un-
employed. I believe—and many agree— 
that one of our highest priorities is to 
make sure that the resources are there 
for the families. 
I also want to say that we are in the 
midst of this conversation about public 
health while the President and his 
party are trying to kill the Affordable 
Care Act in the Supreme Court. More

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S4367 
July 22, 2020 
than 140,000 Americans have died from 
this pandemic, and President Trump 
and the Republican Party are trying to 
kill the major source of health insur-
ance for millions of Americans. For 10 
years, the Affordable Care Act has been 
the law of the land, and before it was 
the law of the land, there were some 
things going on when it came to health 
insurance which we should not forget. 
Routinely, health insurance compa-
nies discriminated against women be-
fore we passed the Affordable Care Act 
and prohibited their practices. There 
was a time when insurance companies 
were allowed to charge women more 
than men for the same health insur-
ance policies. It was common for 
women to pay three or four times what 
men pay for on the identical plans. 
Important women’s healthcare was 
often excluded from most insurance 
plans. For instance, most individual 
policies refused to cover maternity or 
newborn care. 
Insurance companies were allowed to 
deny coverage and charge higher pre-
miums to Americans with preexisting 
conditions. That particular discrimina-
tion hurt women much more than men. 
Approximately 24 million American 
men have preexisting conditions; 30 
million American women. 
Insurance companies could consider a 
host of medical conditions to be pre-
existing conditions: breast cancer, C- 
sections, victims of domestic violence, 
asthma, acne, heart disease—all pre-
existing conditions. Before the Afford-
able Care Act, that is what the health 
insurance companies pointed to when 
they charged women and others more 
because of it. 
The Affordable Care Act put an end 
to that, and now the Republicans want 
to put an end to the Affordable Care 
Act. Well, you must say, they must 
have a much better idea. There must be 
a Republican proposal out there far 
better than the Affordable Care Act. 
There isn’t. We haven’t seen any. They 
have no alternative. They just want to 
kill anything that might have the 
name ‘‘Obama’’ on it. 
We have to do something about this 
to protect health insurance for the fu-
ture, and the notion that the Repub-
licans and President Trump are fight-
ing the Supreme Court to eliminate the 
Affordable Care Act in this moment in 
American history, when we are fight-
ing this pandemic, is impossible to ex-
plain. 
AMENDMENT NO. 1788 
Madam President, I have been hon-
ored to work on the Defense Appropria-
tions Subcommittee since December of 
2012, when Senator Dan Inouye, the 
legendary Senator from Hawaii and re-
cipient of a Congressional Medal of 
Honor, passed away. Since I have taken 
that job, I have been impressed many 
times over by the extraordinary De-
partment of Defense and the actions 
they have taken—the development of 
technology like GPS, investing in crit-
ical medical research, and the abiding 
commitment to women and men in uni-
form, who make so many great sac-
rifices for our country. But I have also 
discovered at the same time how poor-
ly we manage the Department of De-
fense. Our procurement system seems 
designed to generate redtape, delays, 
and cost overruns. Our top adversaries 
around the world develop game-chang-
ing technologies at a fraction of the 
cost that it takes us to develop them. 
There is going to be an amendment 
on the floor today about future spend-
ing in the Department of Defense of-
fered by Senator SANDERS. I heard 
what Senator MCCONNELL had to say 
about it earlier. He seems to believe 
that any suggestion that there is 
misspending in the Department of De-
fense is not patriotic. Somehow you 
are a chicken if you raise any ques-
tions about waste in the Department of 
Defense. I couldn’t disagree more. 
The Sanders amendment proposes a 
10-percent budget cut in the Depart-
ment of Defense. Well, I have taken a 
look, as others have, at the failed au-
dits, the cost overruns, and the scle-
rotic bureaucracy at the Department of 
Defense. I believe the American tax-
payer deserves more. 
One of my early hearings in the De-
fense Appropriations Subcommittee fo-
cused on the defense industrial base 
and the threat of sequestration. The 
lives of our servicemembers often de-
pend on the equipment and training 
provided. When managed well, the de-
fense industrial base generates the best 
equipment, 
next-generation 
tech-
nology, good jobs, and powerful weap-
ons. However, I am concerned that 
holding defense contractors account-
able for poor performance has not been 
the priority it should be today. 
Listen to this: From 2016 to 2019, 
military spending rose by 18 percent. 
During the same period of time, the 
Department of Defense accumulated 
$18 billion in cost overruns for weapons 
programs. What about the contractors 
who generated those cost overruns? 
The top five defense contractors in 
America saw their profits increase by 
44 percent in that same period. This 
doesn’t add up. 
Businesses have the right to earn a 
profit, but taxpayers have the right to 
demand accountability. With defense 
spending on such a steep rise, we 
should be driven by the motto ‘‘pay for 
performance.’’ I don’t believe that is 
the culture at the Department of De-
fense today. 
Senator SANDERS wants to direct $74 
billion to communities across the 
country—including many needy com-
munities in my State of Illinois—for 
housing, healthcare, childcare, edu-
cation, and jobs. Senator MCCONNELL 
comes to the floor and calls that so-
cialism. Socialism when it comes to 
education and childcare? I don’t agree 
with him. 
There is considerable merit to what 
Senator SANDERS has to say about the 
run-up in cost at the Department of 
Defense, but I do not agree with his 
basic 
approach 
of 
across-the-board 
cuts. When you start exempting things 
like military pay and healthcare, it 
means the remaining items take a 
deeper hit. 
The 14-percent cut that has been pro-
posed for the remaining items at the 
Department of Defense would be a hard 
hit, no question about it. As I have said 
many times, sequestration didn’t work, 
and we ought to learn a lesson from it. 
The National Guard should not have 
a 14-percent cut. Special victims coun-
sels and sexual assault prevention pro-
grams should not be cut by 14 percent. 
Cleaning up PFAS contamination at 
military bases should not be cut by 14 
percent. Instead, we ought to look at 
the Department of Defense budget 
more carefully, not with an across-the- 
board cut. 
Let’s start with the $16 billion OCO 
gimmick. OCO is the account created 
to fight a war. We started this account 
years and years ago, when we actually 
were engaged in a war. We have kept it 
alive to this day because it is a way to 
escape budget rules. 
The OCO gimmick funds were re-
quested for routine Army, Navy, and 
Air Force operations that have nothing 
to do with fighting a war in Afghani-
stan or any other place. The adminis-
tration requested these funds for the 
sole purposes of evading the caps on 
the base defense budget. Beyond that— 
listen to this—the President of the 
United States, who is arguing for this 
budget, was the first to raid it and take 
$8 billion or more out for his medieval 
wall on the southern border of the 
United States. 
The $18 billion in weapons systems 
overruns that I mentioned earlier— 
what could we do with $18 billion in 
cost overruns? Well, you could increase 
the budget for the National Institutes 
of Health medical research by almost 
50 percent. That is one thing. You 
could provide student loan forgiveness 
for healthcare workers or hazard pay 
for these same men and women who 
risk their lives for us every day. 
I have to tell you, there is need for us 
to look to space in terms of our future 
defense. I still haven’t been sold on this 
concept of the so-called Space Force. 
Putting millions of dollars into addi-
tional bureaucratic costs is hard for me 
to understand or explain. 
Ultimately, the Sanders amendment 
is going to be considered in this au-
thorization bill, but if it is going any-
where in concept, it will be in the Ap-
propriations Committee, where I serve. 
Our work as appropriators is to exam-
ine the details of the budget and make 
the best decisions for the taxpayers 
and for our national defense. 
I believe Senator SANDERS is on the 
right track to demand accountability 
and to ask that we find cost overruns 
and expenditures that can be changed 
without jeopardizing our national de-
fense. His exact approach is not one 
that I would endorse, but I have to say 
that I stand behind his concept that we 
need to ask harder questions about this 
massive spending.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S4368 
July 22, 2020 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Rhode Island. 
Mr. REED. Madam President, I rise 
to comment, along with my colleague 
Senator DURBIN, about the Sanders 
amendment. I must commend how 
thoughtful and knowledgeable Senator 
DURBIN is about all these subjects. He 
has pointed out how there are too 
many military programs that are not 
well moderated and that have cost 
overruns that result in excess cost to 
the American public. We have to do 
something about those things, and we 
also understand that we have huge de-
mand 
with 
respect 
to 
nondefense 
spending that we have to meet also. 
The Sanders amendment, as Senator 
DURBIN pointed out, would impose an 
across-the-board cut to the Depart-
ment of Defense, except for military 
personnel accounts and the defense 
health programs. What he would call a 
10-percent across-the-board cut, when 
you take out health and personnel, be-
comes really a 14-percent cut to all the 
accounts at the Department of Defense. 
The danger, as so well illustrated by 
Senator DURBIN, is that this type of in-
discriminate getting rid of the good 
and paying for the bad that doesn’t 
really work. It doesn’t make sense. It 
reminds us all of the battles we had 
over 
sequestration, 
where 
Depart-
ments—not only the Department of De-
fense but the civilian Departments— 
had to fund programs because they met 
the cap and then cut other programs 
that were much more valuable because 
they exceeded the cap. That is not a 
way, as they proverbially say, to run a 
railroad, nor the Department of De-
fense. 
So we do have to look for specific 
areas to cut, and, as Senator DURBIN 
said, a great deal of that is done and 
will be done in the Appropriations 
Committee where he is the ranking 
member. I am a colleague on the com-
mittee, and each year we have the 
challenge of taking the authorization 
that says ‘‘you may do this’’ and actu-
ally putting in the money to do it, and 
that effort is usually valuable, as is the 
authorization effort, and critically im-
portant. 
We have to make sure that a result of 
our deliberations is, first, the resources 
that are necessary to protect the men 
and women in the Armed Forces who 
protect us and also provide for the 
quality of life of their families and ul-
timately, of course, that we are able to 
deter any threat, and if not, defeat 
that threat decisively. 
This is a very important endeavor, 
and, again, suggesting that we just cut 
across the board and then put it some-
place else is not, I think, commensu-
rate with the kind of approach that we 
must take and we have to take going 
forward. 
The other factor, too, is that there 
are real ramifications for this that are 
not sometimes obvious. There are lit-
erally thousands and thousands—not 
just military personnel but civilian 
workers and construction workers and 
equipment 
manufacturing 
workers— 
who, in this indiscriminate, across-the- 
board cut, would lose their jobs at a 
time when we can’t lose any jobs. This 
approach would be disruptive. I would 
not want to make a point to the dis-
advantage of the thousands and thou-
sands of men and women who are work-
ing hard to take care of their families 
all across this country. 
Again, we do have to make serious 
investments in communities across 
this country that have been neglected, 
and I have been consistent in support 
of those efforts. We do have to make 
investments in our infrastructure for 
our economic liability and our eco-
nomic efficiency. We do have to pro-
vide support in many, many different 
ways that transcends and goes beyond 
just the Department of Defense. In 
fact, one could say that just as vital a 
part of our national defense as our 
military budget is our education budg-
et and our healthcare budget because 
our strength is not just military forces; 
our strength is knowledgeable citizens, 
our strength is healthy citizens, and 
our strength is an efficient economic 
system. 
But I think this approach, as I sug-
gested today and I think the sugges-
tion from Senator DURBIN
also was 
that this just across-the-board ap-
proach is good for a headline, it is good 
to make a point, but we are here to 
make policy, and I hope we do make 
policy. I hope we can continue in this 
National Defense Authorization Act to 
try to argue about issues that people 
feel are not appropriate spending or if, 
in fact, we need more spending and 
that in the appropriations process we 
will do that once again. 
Just as a reminder, this bill adheres 
to the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2019. It 
is the final year of the Budget Act. So 
the numbers we are talking about 
today for the Department of Defense 
are not willy-nilly; they were not nego-
tiated without the context of non-
defense spending. It was a bipartisan 
agreement to set the levels of spending 
for both defense and nondefense, and 
that is what we are doing here today. 
We need a serious discussion about 
national spending priorities, not just 
defense spending priorities but prior-
ities that look back to poor commu-
nities, industrial policy, infrastruc-
ture, education, daycare, the impact of 
artificial intelligence on the work-
place. We have a lot to do, and I think 
we should get on to doing it but not 
with the shorthand message of ‘‘let’s 
cut everything here, and put it over 
there.’’ Let’s look at the serious issues, 
and let’s confront them, and let’s pro-
pose serious solutions. 
So because of these indiscriminate 
cuts, I will be forced to oppose this 
amendment by Senator SANDERS. 
There is another amendment that 
will come before us today proposed by 
Senator TESTER, and that is one I do 
support. Senator TESTER’s amendment 
will add additional diseases to those 
that the Veterans Administration al-
ready presumes are the result of expo-
sure to Agent Orange by veterans dur-
ing their military service in Vietnam. 
We know that exposure to the toxic 
chemical Agent Orange has had severe 
health consequences for veterans who 
answered the Nation’s call to military 
service during the Vietnam conflict. 
Recognizing this, the Veterans Admin-
istration already presumes that certain 
diseases affecting these veterans are 
service connected as a result of the ex-
posure to Agent Orange. These diseases 
include non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma, soft 
tissue sarcoma, respiratory cancers, 
myeloma and type 2 diabetes. 
We also know that there are other 
diseases that are not yet covered and 
that there are veterans who suffer from 
these diseases, and this conclusion is 
supported by a scientific review by the 
National Academy of Medicine. Par-
kinson’s, 
bladder 
cancer, 
and 
hypothyroidism should share the same 
presumption of service connection as 
the diseases already presumed to be 
service connected. 
Our Vietnam veterans should not 
have the burden of proving by inde-
pendent evidence that their diseases 
were caused by exposure to Agent Or-
ange. The failure to add these condi-
tions to the Veterans Administration’s 
presumptive list continues to deny sick 
and aging veterans the healthcare and 
compensation that they have earned 
through service to our Nation and that 
they desperately need. 
Senator TESTER’s amendment begins 
to remedy this inequity, and I urge all 
Senators to vote for the Tester amend-
ment. 
With that, I yield the floor. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
SASSE). The Senator from Alaska. 
Mr. SULLIVAN. Mr. President, in 
about an hour we are going to take a 
vote that our servicemembers around 
the world will likely be watching. It is 
a critical vote on the amendment of 
my colleague from Vermont to blindly 
cut defense spending, taking a hatchet 
to the already agreed-upon Bipartisan 
Budget Act. 
We have heard from my colleague 
JACK REED from Rhode Island, who is 
part of the strong leadership on the 
Armed Services Committee and just 
spoke out against it, and I am going to 
speak out against it. 
I am going to spend some time ex-
plaining what this means. This is not 
just one amendment. This has national 
implications, and if you are watching 
in America, I want you to think about 
what is really going on here. 
First of all, my colleague from 
Vermont says that it is a 10-percent 
cut, but it is going exempt military 
personnel and healthcare accounts— 
which is true as part of the amend-
ment—but it is actually going to com-
pensate for the other cuts, so it is actu-
ally a 14-percent across-the-board cut 
to the Department of Defense. That is 
the amendment we are going to vote 
on.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S4369 
July 22, 2020 
To paraphrase one of our great Presi-
dents, Ronald Reagan: There they go 
again. There they go again. 
I chair the Subcommittee on Readi-
ness of the Armed Services Committee. 
One of the reasons I ran for the Senate 
in 2014 was exactly this issue of mili-
tary readiness. As a colonel in the U.S. 
Marine Corps Reserve, I had a little bit 
of an up close and personal view on it. 
The readiness of our Armed Forces in 
the second term of the Obama adminis-
tration was plummeting. In the second 
term of the Obama administration, de-
fense spending was cut by 25 percent, 
and, with that, the readiness of the 
men and women in the military plum-
meted. By the way, at the same time 
defense spending was cut by 25 percent, 
Russia was increasing defense spending 
by 34 percent, and China was increasing 
by 83 percent. 
So let me just give an example. These 
numbers actually were classified, and 
they have been declassified. In 2015, 
when I arrived in the Senate, these 
were some of the numbers relating to 
readiness. Remember, we are supposed 
to be in charge of readiness here. Three 
of the 58 brigade combat teams in the 
U.S. Army—the brigade combat team 
is the 5,000 men and women deployed 
block in our military, and 3 of the 58 
were at the tier 1 level of readiness 
that you want for a deployed unit. You 
can understand why that was classified 
in 2015 because we certainly didn’t 
want our adversaries to know that. So 
5 percent of the U.S. Army was fully 
ready to fight. Less than half of Marine 
Corps Navy aviation could fly—another 
classified number, now unclassified. 
Training and flight time for all mili-
tary pilots plummeted. 
When I arrived in 2015, the Obama ad-
ministration proposed a cut of another 
40,000 Active-Duty troops for the U.S. 
Army. One of the units they were look-
ing to cut was the 4th Brigade of the 
25th Infantry Division—the 4–25 at 
JBER in Alaska, the only airborne 
combat team in the Asia Pacific. I put 
every ounce of my energy into fighting 
that misguided decision. The 4–25 was 
not cut, thankfully. All the rest of the 
40,000 were cut. We are still digging out 
of that hole. 
So I want to throw something out 
there because people don’t think about 
it. Imagine if there had been a major 
contingency or, yes, a war in 2015 with 
these readiness numbers. Sometimes 
wars hit us when we are least expecting 
them. I am going to talk about that. 
I will tell you this: It would have 
been very ugly—not only for our na-
tional security but more importantly 
for our troops—for the men and women 
we are supposed to make sure are 
trained so that they never have to go 
into a fair fight, so we know they are 
always going to win. 
We just celebrated the 70th anniver-
sary of the outbreak of the Korean war 
on June 25, 1950. I am a bit of a Korean 
war history buff. I will tell you this: 
What we didn’t celebrate was actually 
what happened in the summer of 1950 
at the outbreak of the Korean war. 
Here is what happened. The greatest 
military power in the world in 1945 was 
the U.S. military. We had just won 
World War II. By 1950, due to dramatic 
defense cuts, lack of training, lack of 
readiness, our military had a very dif-
ficult time halting the invasion of a 
third-world army, the North Korean 
army. 
For the history buffs who understand 
Korean war history—the military cer-
tainly does—they know what Task 
Force Smith was. It was the first 
American unit that went in to stop the 
North Korean army. Task Force Smith 
was obliterated. Hundreds were killed 
in the summer of 1950. As a matter of 
fact, thousands of young Americans 
died horrible deaths during the summer 
of 1950 because the leadership in Con-
gress, the leadership in the executive 
branch, and the leadership in the Pen-
tagon let the readiness of our Armed 
Forces plummet. Let me repeat that: 70 
years ago right now—if you look back 
70 years ago in the summer of 1950 on 
the Korean Peninsula—thousands of 
young Americans were being killed be-
cause they weren’t trained and they 
weren’t ready. 
This was probably one of the biggest 
derelictions of duty in U.S. history. Be-
cause it is a forgotten war, not many 
people know about it. But it was a dra-
matic failure of leadership in the Con-
gress, the executive branch, and the 
military. The military even has a say-
ing for this: ‘‘No more Task Force 
Smith.’’ We will never ever—ever—let 
our young men and women go fight a 
war where they are unprepared, and be-
cause of that, they die. 
I agree we need to do all we can to 
address many of the social issues that 
my colleague from Vermont highlights, 
particularly during this pandemic. But 
we must never, as a Congress, gut our 
military readiness to such a degree 
that our young men and women come 
home in body bags as opposed to vic-
tors. That is what happened in the 
summer of 1950. 
We were on a path toward this dan-
gerous lack of readiness during the sec-
ond term of the Obama administration. 
I cited the numbers. I chair the Sub-
committee on Readiness. I have been 
all focused on this issue of rebuilding 
our readiness. 
Here is the good news. With the Re-
publicans in control in the Senate and 
the White House, we have begun to dra-
matically rebuild our military and our 
readiness. This has been a priority of 
ours. This has certainly been a priority 
of mine. Many of my colleagues, Demo-
crats and Republicans, particularly on 
the Armed Services Committee, have 
been working on rebuilding our mili-
tary. When we were looking at these 
numbers, so many people on the Armed 
Services Committee, including JACK 
REED, who just gave a very eloquent 
speech, recognized, whoa—dangerous 
world, dangerous neighborhood, and a 
military that is not ready. So we got to 
work. 
I enjoy my bipartisan work here in 
the Senate. Some of my best friends 
are from the other side of the aisle, but 
there are principle disagreements on 
key issues between some on this side of 
the aisle and the other side. One of 
them is about the degree to which we 
support our military and national de-
fense. 
I know all of my colleagues are patri-
otic. I don’t like doing the patriotism 
argument. Every Member of this body, 
all 100—we love our country. But there 
are some impressions when you look at 
what goes on here, when you look at 
the sweep of history with regard to 
readiness and funding our military. 
Again, to my Democratic colleagues 
on the Armed Services Committee, De-
fense Appropriations, who, like me, at-
tend the hearings regularly, dig into 
the issues, know the threats our coun-
try faces, I think we work together to 
rebuild readiness. But at the national 
level, here are the facts. Think about 
it. Carter, Clinton, Obama, Biden— 
what do those administrations all have 
in common? They get into power, and 
they cut our military, and morale 
plummets, and readiness plummets. 
Let me go a little bit closer to home. 
Since I have been elected, the No. 1 bill 
my colleagues on the other side of the 
aisle have filibustered—the No. 1 bill 
when they want to take something hos-
tage—is the Defense appropriations 
bill. Ten times, since I have been in 
this body, the funding for our men and 
women has been pulled in as a hos-
tage—ten times. No other bill in the 
last 51⁄2 years, since I have been here, 
has been filibustered more than the De-
fense appropriations bill. 
Our friends in the media never report 
on this, but that is one of the issues 
that really burns me up here because it 
happens all the time. Trust me, our 
troops know it. They watch it, and 
they know it. 
Now we have a Sanders amendment 
for across-the-board DOD cuts of 14 
percent just as we are digging out of 
the readiness hole that we all know 
that we are in. If you don’t acknowl-
edge it, you are not paying attention. 
The Senate minority leader has re-
cently come out in favor of the Sanders 
amendment. I wonder where Joe Biden 
is on the Sanders amendment. 
Of course, as my colleague from Illi-
nois just mentioned, the Pentagon 
must do a better job of managing waste 
and cost overruns. I fully agree with 
that. In fact, the Trump administra-
tion was the first administration to fi-
nally undertake an audit of the Pen-
tagon. Again, Democrats and Repub-
licans on the Armed Services Com-
mittee pressed for it, and we finally got 
it. It took decades, but an audit of the 
Pentagon has finally happened. 
Make 
no 
mistake, 
the 
Sanders 
amendment is the first salvo in the na-
tional Democratic leadership’s goal of 
defunding 
the 
military 
across 
the 
board. If you don’t want to take my 
word for it, here is the POLITICO op-ed 
from 
Senator 
SANDERS
about 
his 
amendment titled: ‘‘Defund the Pen-
tagon: The Liberal Case.’’

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S4370 
July 22, 2020 
‘‘Defund the Pentagon’’—there they 
go again. This is a really important 
issue. I hope my colleagues on both 
sides of the aisle defeat this amend-
ment 
overwhelmingly—overwhelm-
ingly. The men and women of the mili-
tary are watching this amendment. 
The men and women of the military 
know that their readiness 5 years ago 
was in a really bad state. 
The vote today and what is going to 
happen later—literally, if you look at 
history, we never know when the next 
conflict is coming. We didn’t know that 
in the summer of 1950, the military was 
going to be rushed to the Korean Pe-
ninsula and would barely be able to 
hold its own. Thousands died because 
they weren’t ready because of defense 
cuts by the Congress and the executive 
branch and the Pentagon. 
So this is an important vote. The 
lives of the men and women in our 
military and their readiness could well 
depend on this vote, and I urge my col-
leagues on both sides of the aisle to 
strongly reject it. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Montana. 
REMEMBERING JIM POSEWITZ 
Mr. TESTER. Mr. President, before I 
call up my amendment and get to the 
issue of our veterans in this country, I 
want to say a few words about a good 
friend and a legendary Montana con-
servationist named Jim Posewitz, who 
passed away a few weeks ago. 
He was a towering figure in Montana 
and in the history of conservation in 
our great State. He was a man who 
knew right from wrong, and Montanans 
know that he was almost always right 
and seldom wrong. 
Poz’s accomplishments are too long 
to list, but any Montanan who fished in 
the Missouri River, learning the ethics 
of hunting or hiking in Montana’s 
Rocky Mountain Front, owes a deep 
debt of gratitude to Poz’s more than 30 
years of work for the Montana Fish, 
Wildlife, and Parks and to his post-re-
tirement work as a conservation advo-
cate, ethicist, and leader. 
The Wilderness Act of 1964 says that 
America’s wildest places are those 
where man himself is a visitor. Poz un-
derstood that power, that magic, and 
the importance of these places. He was 
relentless in his fight to protect them, 
and he was uncompromising in his 
faith that they bring us closer to na-
ture, to each other, and to ourselves. 
He never stopped fighting for Montana 
and for the wild places in Montana. 
My heart goes out to Poz’s family, 
including his life partner Gayle; his 
sons, Brian, Allen, Carl; Matthew and 
Matthew’s 
wife 
Heather and their 
daughters, Sarah and Lindsay; his son 
Andrew and Andrew’s wife Kelly and 
their daughters Madison and Charlotte; 
his stepdaughter Ann and Ann’s hus-
band Nate and their children, Joslin 
and Lyzander; his stepson Clayton and 
Clayton’s wife Michelle and daughter 
Ayla. Poz is also survived by his broth-
er John and John’s wife Mary and their 
four children. 
He will be greatly missed. He is 
somebody they only make one of, an 
incredible human being. 
AMENDMENT NO. 1972, AS MODIFIED 
Mr. TESTER. Mr. President, I call up 
amendment No. 1972, as modified, and 
ask that it be reported by number. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will report. 
The legislative clerk read as follows: 
The Senator from Montana [Mr. TESTER] 
proposes an amendment numbered 1972, as 
modified, to amendment No. 2301. 
The amendment is as follows: 
(Purpose: To expand the list of diseases asso-
ciated with exposure to certain herbicide 
agents for which there is a presumption of 
service connection for veterans who served 
in the Republic of Vietnam) 
At the end of subtitle G of title X, add the 
following: 
SEC. ll. ADDITIONAL DISEASES ASSOCIATED 
WITH EXPOSURE TO CERTAIN HER-
BICIDE AGENTS FOR WHICH THERE 
IS A PRESUMPTION OF SERVICE 
CONNECTION FOR VETERANS WHO 
SERVED IN THE REPUBLIC OF VIET-
NAM. 
Section 1116(a)(2) of title 38, United States 
Code, is amended by adding at the end the 
following new subparagraphs: 
‘‘(I) Parkinsonism. 
‘‘(J) Bladder cancer. 
‘‘(K) Hypothyroidism.’’. 
Mr. TESTER. Mr. President, I want 
to turn to the issue of the day, and 
that is this amendment to the National 
Defense Authorization Act. 
Senator REED talked about it a few 
minutes ago because, quite frankly, 
justice is long overdue for thousands of 
veterans who are currently suffering 
and dying from illnesses related to ex-
posure to Agent Orange in Vietnam. 
You know, one of our most sacred du-
ties is to take care of those who are 
wounded in service to this country, and 
the fact is, this administration, the 
Trump administration, has refused to 
expand the list of presumptive health 
conditions associated with Agent Or-
ange to cover illnesses such as bladder 
cancer, 
hypothyroidism, 
and 
Parkinsonism. They don’t seem to 
think that exposure to these toxic 
chemicals in Vietnam is a cost of war. 
Well, let me tell you, they are wrong. 
It is a cost of war. The fact is, this ad-
ministration wants to outlive the Viet-
nam veterans, and they don’t want to 
pay for it. 
Every time we get in a situation— 
and I should say the last time we got in 
a situation, for sure—we sent off our 
young men and women in the military, 
and we put the cost on the credit card 
for our kids to pay and don’t think a 
thing about it, but when they come 
back and they are changed, all of a sud-
den, we don’t want to pay for it, espe-
cially when these conditions, in par-
ticular, already meet the historical 
standard to be added to the Depart-
ment of Veterans Affairs’ presumptive 
list for service connection. 
Now, this is not just me talking. This 
is the National Academies of Medicine 
weighing in with their reviews of sci-
entific evidence—scientific evidence. 
Each day this administration stone-
walls benefits, more and more veterans 
are forced to live with the detrimental 
effects of their exposure without the 
assistance that not only they have 
earned but that we owe them—veterans 
like Bill Garber from Great Falls, MT. 
In 1967, Bill enlisted in the U.S. 
Army, and within 6 months he was sent 
to fight in Vietnam, where he served as 
a combat engineer and demolitions ex-
pert with the 11th Armored Cavalry 
Regiment, 1st Brigade Combat Team of 
the 101st Airborne Division. During his 
yearlong tour in Vietnam, Bill saw 
heavy combat, and like most military 
folks who were in Vietnam, was ex-
posed to Agent Orange. 
Now, more than 50 years later, after 
his service and his sacrifice, Bill suf-
fers 
from 
tremors 
diagnosed 
as 
Parkinsonism, one of the three condi-
tions that would be covered by the De-
partment of Veterans Affairs if this 
amendment passes. Bill’s story is he-
roic, but the truth is, he is one of tens 
of thousands of Vietnam veterans in 
this country who are still waiting for 
this White House to grant them the 
benefits they have earned. 
No more waiting. No more trying to 
outlive 
the 
Vietnam 
veteran. 
My 
amendment directs the Department of 
Veterans Affairs to acknowledge the 
overwhelming scientific evidence al-
ready put forward by veterans, sci-
entists, and medical experts, and pro-
vide Vietnam veterans with the bene-
fits they have earned in service to our 
country. 
Today, we have an opportunity to 
end the needless suffering and dis-
appointment for an entire generation 
of veterans who are counting on Con-
gress to simply do the right thing. The 
reality is that taking care of our vet-
erans is a cost of war and is a cost that 
must be paid. We must hold this ad-
ministration accountable on behalf of 
thousands of veterans like Bill who 
gave so much for this country, and I 
urge my colleagues to get this done 
with a ‘‘yes’’ vote on this amendment 
so we can end the wait for veterans 
who have already sacrificed greatly 
and who shouldn’t be forced to wait 1 
minute longer. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Vermont. 
Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, in a few 
minutes we will vote on the Sanders 
amendment, which I support. As vice 
chairman of the Senate Appropriations 
Committee, I have worked with the Re-
publican leadership and with Chairman 
SHELBY in recent years to strike budg-
et agreements that resulted in parity 
between defense and nondefense spend-
ing. At the same time, amid a national 
and international public health crisis, 
the need to infuse more resources into 
public health, education, and business 
development programs has never been 
greater. 
I have heard from my Republican col-
leagues on the floor objecting to the 
Sanders amendment. I would say to 
them that if they feel that strongly—

July 22, 2020 
this is not authorized—but if they feel 
that strongly, they should tell their 
Republican leadership to allow the ap-
propriations bill to come up so they 
can actually vote on the Defense bill. 
Right now, this is just idle chatter 
when they object to Senator SANDERS’ 
amendment, and yet they are unwilling 
themselves to actually vote up or down 
on the appropriations bill for not only 
the Department of Defense bill but the 
other 
Departments. 
The 
Sanders 
amendment, after all, maintains full 
support for the personnel needs of the 
Department of Defense, as well as the 
critical medical research supported 
throughout the Department. It would 
also take some of the Department’s 
sweeping budget and reserve it for un-
derfunded domestic needs. This is long 
overdue. 
I again call on my Republican col-
leagues to stop talking about the 
money you want or don’t want to 
spend. Tell the Republican leader to 
allow the appropriations bills to come 
to the floor and vote up or down. 
REMEMBERING JOHN LEWIS 
Mr. President, on another issue, I 
have had such an incredibly heavy 
heart since I heard Friday night my 
dear friend and hero, John Lewis 
passed away. I stand here on the Sen-
ate floor today to talk about him. 
When I got a call at our home in 
Vermont late that night, my wife, my 
son, and I just sat there and talked 
about John for hours and cried. We 
knew America lost a genuine hero—an 
unwavering lodestar who, over decades 
of selfless activism and public service, 
drew us closer to our ideals. 
I remember when he invited me in to 
watch actually a sit-in by Democratic 
Members in the House of Representa-
tives when the Republican Speaker had 
closed down the House for them to 
have votes. He saw me outside, and I 
asked him what is going on, and he 
said: You are my brother. 
He took me by the arm, brought me 
in, and sat me down in the well of the 
House to watch what was going on. I 
was always humbled and honored to be 
called his brother, as he often did when 
we were together, including an unfor-
gettable visit he had with us in 
Vermont just last year. 
I have been thinking so much of what 
we can say, and there aren’t enough 
words—there certainly aren’t—in pay-
ing tribute to a man whose life was de-
fined by the relentless and fearless pur-
suit of equality. John bled, literally, 
and his bones were broken, literally, 
for the causes of civil rights. He came 
to Congress bearing those scars—a liv-
ing, breathing reminder that our soci-
ety’s progress on racial equality came 
through the sacrifices of heroes like 
him. 
In Congress, John Lewis stood with 
equal moral clarity, serving as its con-
science and reminding us that our 
work to build a genuinely equal and 
just society remains unfinished. His 
thundering words just months ago echo 
even more loudly today. He said: 
When you see something that is not right 
. . . you have a moral obligation to say 
something. To do something. Our children 
and their children will ask us, ‘‘What did you 
do?’’ 
That is a question all of us must ask 
ourselves. 
VOTING RIGHTS ADVANCEMENT ACT 
Mr. President, there is one thing I 
am doing today that I want to share 
with my fellow Senators and Ameri-
cans. Today, I am reintroducing the 
Voting Rights Advancement Act, and 
we are renaming it the John Lewis 
Voting Rights Advancement Act. 
This is bipartisan legislation. It has 
47 Senate cosponsors. It would safe-
guard what John fought over a lifetime 
to achieve: equality at the voting 
booth. The bill would restore the Vot-
ing Rights Act to end the scourge of 
minority voter suppression. 
Now, the House already passed a 
companion to the John Lewis Voting 
Rights Advancement Act in December. 
Now let’s do our part. We can’t claim 
to honor the life of John Lewis if we 
refuse to carry out his life’s work. Of 
course, if we stand in the way of that 
work, that would be the wrong thing to 
do. 
So I would urge my fellow Senators, 
join me in calling on Senator MCCON-
NELL to allow a vote up or down on the 
John Lewis Voting Rights Advance-
ment Act. 
Let’s do that for John, but let’s not 
do it simply because it is named after 
him but because it is precisely what 
John would do. And if we have a moral 
compass, we should do it and take ac-
tion to forge a more perfect Union, pro-
tect our democracy, and above all, do 
what is right. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. 
SANDERS. 
Mr. 
President, 
I 
thank Senator LEAHY for his support of 
our amendment, for his beautiful words 
on John Lewis, and for his insistence 
that this Senate makes sure that every 
American has the right to vote. That is 
not asking too much, and that is a bill 
we should deal with. 
Mr. President, I rise to speak in sup-
port of the amendment I have filed for 
the National Defense Authorization 
Act to cut the bloated $740 billion Pen-
tagon budget by 10 percent and use 
that $74 billion in savings to invest in 
human needs here at home. 
This amendment is being cosponsored 
by 
Senators 
MARKEY, 
WARREN, 
MERKLEY, WYDEN, and Senator LEAHY 
and will receive a rollcall at 12:10 p.m. 
This amendment has been endorsed 
by more than 60 organizations rep-
resenting millions of working people, 
environmentalists, and religious lead-
ers, including Public Citizen, the Union 
of Concerned Scientists, and Physi-
cians for Social Responsibility. 
In America today, we are experi-
encing an extraordinary set of crises 
unprecedented in the history of the 
United States of America. We are in 
the midst of a public health crisis that 
is worse than at any time since the 
Spanish flu of 1918. Over the past 4 
months, the coronavirus has infected 
more than 3.7 million Americans and 
caused nearly 140,000 deaths. 
We are in the midst of the worst eco-
nomic downturn since the Great De-
pression. During the COVID–19 pan-
demic, 119 million Americans have seen 
a decline in their income—unbeliev-
able. One hundred and nineteen million 
Americans have seen a decline in their 
income, 50 million have filed for unem-
ployment, and American households 
have lost over $6 trillion in wealth. 
All over this country—in the State of 
Vermont and in every other State in 
America—people are going hungry in 
America. People are going hungry. And 
many, many people are frightened to 
death that they will soon be evicted 
from their apartments or will lose 
their homes to foreclosure. 
That is where the American people 
are today: loss of jobs, loss of income, 
hunger, eviction. 
On the other hand, there is another 
reality going on in America today. We 
don’t talk about it much, but we 
should, and that is that 600 billionaires 
in our country have seen their wealth 
go up by $700 billion during the pan-
demic. So we entered this pandemic 
with massive income and wealth in-
equality since the pandemic, and the 
very rich have become even richer, 
while working people have seen a sig-
nificant decline in their income and 
wealth. 
The current crisis, or series of crises, 
have revealed the extraordinary in-
equities in our economy. If people 
didn’t know it before, they surely know 
it now. 
In the United States today, over half 
of our workers live paycheck to pay-
check. Not surprisingly, when you live 
paycheck to paycheck, and the pay-
check stops coming in, you are in fi-
nancial distress. That means that your 
economic situation goes from poverty, 
which is low wages, to desperation, 
which is no income coming in at all. 
That means that you go hungry. It 
means that you may become homeless. 
It means that when you get sick, you 
no longer have health insurance or the 
income to see a doctor. 
What the pandemic has taught us is 
that a relatively low unemployment 
rate, which is what we had before the 
pandemic, does not adequately guar-
antee for the security and well-being of 
working families. 
When tens of millions of our people 
earn starvation wages, that is not a 
good economy. When 40 percent of our 
people do not have the savings to pay 
for a $400 emergency, that is not what 
I would call a good economy. When 
over half a million Americans are 
homeless and 18 million families spend 
at least half of their incomes on hous-
ing, that is not a good economy. When 
87 million people are uninsured or 
underinsured, that is not a good econ-
omy. In other words, to create a good 
economy, we are going to have to do a 
whole lot better than that. 
Further, over the last few months, 
hundreds of thousands of Americans 
have taken to the streets to demand 
justice for the murders of George 
Floyd, 
Breonna 
Taylor, 
Rayshard 
Brooks, and Ahmaud Arbery, among 
many others, and to end the rampant 
police brutality that we see in America 
today. These tragic killings of unarmed 
African Americans have highlighted 
the urgent need to rethink the nature 
of policing and to fix a broken and rac-
ist criminal justice system. 
On top of all of that—on top of a pan-
demic, on top of an economic collapse, 
on top of systemic racism—we have to 
address the existential threat facing 
this planet of climate change. 
A few weeks ago, temperatures in Si-
beria—the coldest region on Earth— 
topped 100 degrees, shattering records. 
If we do not get our act together and 
transform our energy system away 
from fossil fuel and into renewable en-
ergy, we will be leaving this planet in-
creasingly unhealthy and uninhabit-
able for our kids and future genera-
tions. 
That is where we are today: hunger, 
homelessness, racism, a warming and 
dangerously warming climate. These 
are the issues that we have to focus on. 
Our attention must be on improving 
the lives of ordinary Americans—work-
ing people, lower income people—and 
doing what we can to work with coun-
tries around the world to help the bil-
lions of people living in economic dis-
tress. 
With that, I rise today to make it 
abundantly clear that if we are going 
to address those issues, if we are going 
to protect the working families of this 
country who are now under so much 
stress, it is absolutely imperative that 
we change our national priorities. 
The status quo and conventional wis-
dom that we see on TV every day and 
that we hear on the floor of the Senate 
is no longer good enough. History has 
overtaken us. Unprecedented crises 
have overtaken us. The status quo is 
not good enough. We must respond. 
We must finally have the courage to 
stand up to powerful special interests 
and all of their campaign money and 
understand that we cannot allow these 
people to continue to have so much 
power over the economic and political 
life of this country; that we must start 
developing policies that work for work-
ing families, not just the rich, not just 
the powerful, and not just those who 
contribute to super PACs. 
Fifty-three years ago, Dr. Martin Lu-
ther King, Jr., challenged our country 
to fight against three major evils: ‘‘The 
evil of racism, the evil of poverty, and 
the evil of war.’’ That was what Dr. 
King said 53 years ago. And if there 
were ever a moment in American his-
tory when we need to respond to Dr. 
King’s clarion call for justice and de-
mand, as he stated, ‘‘a radical revolu-
tion of values,’’ now is that time. This 
is the moment for us to bring about 
what Dr. King called ‘‘a radical revolu-
tion of values,’’ whether it is fighting 
against systemic racism and police 
brutality, whether it is transforming 
our energy system away from fossil 
fuel, whether it is ending a cruel and 
dysfunctional healthcare system, or 
addressing the grotesque level of in-
come and wealth inequality in our 
country, now is the time for change, 
real change. 
In my view, given all of the unprece-
dented crises our country faces, now is 
not the time to increase the Penta-
gon’s bloated $740 billion budget, which 
is 53 percent of all discretionary spend-
ing in America. Let me repeat that. 
The military budget alone is 53 percent 
of all discretionary spending in this 
country. 
At a time when 28 million Americans 
are in danger of being evicted from 
their homes, now is not the time to be 
spending more on the military than the 
next 11 nations combined. 
At a time when 30 million Americans 
have lost their jobs, now is not the 
time to be spending more on national 
defense than we did at the height—the 
height—of the Cold War or the wars in

Korea or Vietnam. Let me repeat: 
spending more in real, inflation-ac-
counted-for dollars today on the mili-
tary than we did during the Cold War 
or the wars in Korea or Vietnam. 
At this unprecedented moment in our 
history, now is the time to provide 
jobs, education, healthcare, and hous-
ing in American communities that 
have been ravaged by the global pan-
demic, 
by 
extreme 
poverty, 
by 
deindustrialization, and mass incarcer-
ation. 
If this horrific pandemic we are now 
experiencing has taught us anything, it 
is that national security means a lot 
more than building bombs, missiles, jet 
fighters, 
submarines, 
nuclear 
war-
heads, and other weapons of mass de-
struction. 
National 
security 
also 
means doing everything we can to im-
prove the lives of our people, many of 
whom have been abandoned by our gov-
ernment decade after decade. 
The amendment that I am offering 
today would cut the $740 billion budg-
et—Pentagon budget—by 10 percent 
and use that $74 billion in savings to 
invest in distressed communities in 
every State in this country, commu-
nities that have been ravaged by pov-
erty, mass incarceration, and other 
enormous problems. 
Under this amendment, distressed 
cities and towns would be able to use 
this $74 billion to create jobs by build-
ing affordable housing, new schools, 
childcare facilities, community health 
centers, public hospitals, libraries, sus-
tainable energy projects, and clean 
drinking water facilities. These com-
munities would also receive Federal 
funding to hire more public school 
teachers, provide nutritious meals to 
children, and offer free tuition at pub-
lic colleges, universities, and trade 
schools. 
Over and over again, our Republican 
friends—my colleagues here—have told 
us we cannot possibly afford to address 
the enormous problems facing working 
families: We just can’t afford it. We 
don’t have the money to deal with 
homelessness and hunger and inad-
equate education. 
That is what they say every day. We 
have been told that we cannot afford to 
make public colleges and universities 
tuition-free or to provide a decent in-
come for every man, woman, and child. 
But when it comes to spending $740 bil-
lion on the military, well, suddenly, 
hey, money is no problem; we can 
spend as much as we want. Hey, let’s 
listen to all of the lobbyists from the 
military-industrial complex who flood 
Capitol Hill and tell us all their needs. 
We have to listen to them, but we don’t 
listen to the children in this country 
who may not have enough food to eat 
or the workers in this country who are 
sleeping out in their cars. We don’t lis-
ten to them, but when it comes to the 
military, hey, no end to the money 
that we can provide. 
To my mind, that is unacceptable. 
We don’t need more nuclear weapons. 
We don’t need more cruise missiles. We 
don’t need more fighter jets. What we 
do need in this country, desperately, is 
more healthcare, more housing, more 
childcare, and better schools. 
Now is the time to fundamentally 
change our national priorities, and 
that is what this amendment is all 
about. This amendment in itself is not 
going to do anywhere near what we 
need to do as a country, but it is an im-
portant step forward in changing the 
way we think about our needs. 
Let me be clear. If we were to insti-
tute a 10-percent cut in military spend-
ing, that $74 billion could provide high- 
quality childcare to every family in 
America. Imagine that. We could solve 
the childcare crisis in America just by 
cutting the military budget by 10 per-
cent. 
We could, by cutting the military 
budget by 10 percent, provide section 8 
housing vouchers to all of the 7.7 mil-
lion families in America who are pay-
ing more than half of their limited in-
comes on rent. 
A 10-percent cut to the Pentagon 
could provide a free college education 
for 2 million low-income students. 
A 10-percent cut to the Pentagon is 
enough to hire 900,000 teachers in the 
poorest schools in America. 
So I am a little bit tired about hear-
ing that we don’t have enough money 
for nuclear weapons, that we need more 
money for missiles and tanks and 
guns—that we need more for all of 
that, yet we are turning our backs on 
Americans who are hurting the most. 
I believe this is a moment in history 
when it would be a very good idea for 
all of my colleagues, Democratic and 
Republican, to remember what former 
Republican—Republican—President 
Dwight D. Eisenhower said in 1953. I 
think we all recall that Eisenhower 
knew something about military budg-
ets and the war because he was the 
four-star general who led the Allied 
forces to victory in Europe during 
World War II. He was not a passivist. 
He was not an anti-war activist. He was 
a four-star general. 
Dwight D. Eisenhower said: 
Every gun that is made, every warship 
launched, every rocket signifies, in the final 
sense, a theft from those who hunger and are 
not fed, those who are cold and are not 
clothed. This world in arms is not spending 
money alone. It is spending the sweat of its 
laborers, the genius of its scientists, the 
hopes of its children. 
Right now, when the world is search-
ing for treatment of the coronavirus, 
when we are searching desperately and 
spending billions looking for a vaccine, 
maybe it might be a good idea to be 
educating our young people to figure 
out how we deal with disease—with 
cancer and schizophrenia and Alz-
heimer’s 
and 
diabetes—rather 
than 
putting more and more scientists into 
figuring out how we can blow the world 
up a dozen times over. 
What Eisenhower said was true—pro-
foundly true—67 years ago, and it is 
true today, maybe even truer today. 
When we analyze the Defense Depart-
ment budget, it is interesting to note 
that the Congress has appropriated so 
much money for the Defense Depart-
ment that the Pentagon literally does 
not know what to do with it. Between 
2013 and 2018, they actually returned 
more than $80 billion in funding back 
to the Treasury. They had more money 
than they could spend. 
In my view, the time is long overdue 
for us to take a hard look not only at 
the size of the Pentagon budget but at 
the enormous amount of waste, cost 
overruns, fraud, and at the financial 
mismanagement that has plagued the 
Department of Defense for decades. 
Let’s be clear. We don’t talk about it, 
but let’s be clear. About half of the 
Pentagon’s budget goes directly into 
the hands of private contractors, not 
our troops. Over the past two decades, 
virtually every major defense con-
tractor in the United States has paid 
billions of dollars in fines and settle-
ments for misconduct and fraud, all 
while making huge profits on those 
government contracts. Virtually every 
major defense contractor has been 
found guilty of misconduct or fraud. 
Since 1995, Boeing, Lockheed Martin, 
and United Technologies have paid 
over $3 billion in fines or related settle-
ments for fraud or misconduct. Fur-
ther, I find it interesting that the very 
same defense contractors that have 
been found guilty or reached settle-
ments for fraud are also paying their 
CEOs excessive—excessive—compensa-
tion packages. Last year, the CEOs of 
Lockheed Martin and Northrop Grum-
man both made over $20 million in 
total compensation, while around 90 
percent of these companies’ revenue 
came from defense contracts. In other 
words, for all intents and purposes, 
these companies are basically govern-
ment agencies. Ninety percent of the 
revenue coming in comes from the tax-
payers of this country. Meanwhile, the 
CEOs of those companies make over 100 
times more than the Secretary of De-
fense makes. It is not too surprising, 
therefore, that we have a revolving 
door where our military people end up 
on the boards of directors of these 
major defense companies. 
Moreover, as the GAO has told us, 
there are massive cost overruns in the 
Defense 
Department’s 
acquisition 
budget that we continue to ignore year 
after year. According to the GAO, the 
Pentagon’s 
$1.8 
trillion 
acquisition 
portfolio currently suffers from more 
than $628 billion in cost overruns, with 
much of the cost growth taking place 
after production. 
A major reason why there is so much 
waste, fraud, and abuse at the Pen-
tagon is the fact that the Defense De-
partment remains the only Federal 
agency in America that has not been 
able to pass an independent audit. 
Many of us will recall what then-Sec-
retary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld— 
George W. Bush’s Secretary of De-
fense—told the American people on the 
day before 9/11. It never got a lot of at-
tention—the day before 9/11. Rumsfeld 
said:

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S4374 
July 22, 2020 
Our financial systems are decades old. Ac-
cording to some estimates, we cannot track 
$2.3 trillion in transactions. 
I don’t know that the situation has 
changed very much since 2001 and 
Rumsfeld’s remarks. Yet, nearly 20 
years after Rumsfeld’s statements, the 
Defense 
Department 
has 
still 
not 
passed a clean audit, despite the fact 
that the Pentagon controls assets in 
excess of $2.2 trillion or roughly 70 per-
cent of what the entire Federal Gov-
ernment owns. 
I believe in a strong military, but we 
cannot keep giving more money to the 
Pentagon than it needs when millions 
of children in this country face hunger 
every day and 140 million Americans 
cannot afford the basic necessities of 
life without going into debt. 
In 1967 Dr. King warned us that ‘‘a 
nation that continues year after year 
to spend more money on military de-
fense than on programs of social uplift 
is approaching spiritual death.’’ I be-
lieve the time is long overdue for us to 
listen to Dr. King. 
At a time when, in the richest coun-
try in the history of the world, so 
many of our people are struggling, now 
is the time to change our priorities be-
cause, as Dr. King stated, we are ap-
proaching spiritual death. 
At a time when we have the highest 
rate of childhood poverty of almost any 
major country on Earth, at a time 
when 60,000 Americans die each year 
because they can’t get to a doctor on 
time and 1 out of 5 Americans cannot 
afford the prescription drugs their doc-
tors prescribe, we need to start focus-
ing on those people, not on the mili-
tary-industrial complex. 
At this moment of unprecedented na-
tional crisis—a pandemic, an economic 
meltdown, the demand to end systemic 
racism, and an unstable President—it 
is time for us to truly focus on what we 
value as a society and to fundamen-
tally transform our national priorities. 
Cutting the military budget by 10 per-
cent and investing that money in 
human needs is a modest way to begin 
that process. 
Let me conclude by once again 
quoting Dwight D. Eisenhower. I don’t 
know that I have ever quoted a Repub-
lican quite as much as I have during 
these remarks, but he is somebody 
whom I respected very much. 
This is what Eisenhower said when 
he left office. This was back in 1961. He 
was out, and John F. Kennedy was 
coming in. This is what he said. I hope 
we can all remember this. He said: 
In the councils of government, we must 
guard against the acquisition of unwarranted 
influence, whether sought or unsought, by 
the military-industrial complex. The poten-
tial for the disastrous rise of misplaced 
power exists and will persist. 
Eisenhower was right then, and, if 
anything, the situation is worse today. 
Now is the time for us to stand up to 
the greed and irresponsibility of the 
military industrial complex. Now is the 
time to address the needs of working 
families, the elderly, the children, the 
sick, and the poor. 
Let us vote for the Sanders-Markey- 
Warren-Merkley-Wyden-Leahy amend-
ment to cut the Pentagon budget by 10 
percent and invest in human needs here 
at home. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
LANKFORD). The Senator from Massa-
chusetts. 
Mr. MARKEY. Mr. President, I am 
proud to speak in support of my 
amendment with Senator SANDERS to 
prioritize investments in our commu-
nities over a bloated Pentagon budget. 
I thank Senator SANDERS for his lead-
ership on this issue, bringing forth this 
fundamental tension that exists within 
our society. 
The men and women of the Armed 
Forces deserve our admiration, our re-
spect, and our support. Day in and day 
out, they defend our country’s inter-
ests in all corners of the world, and 
their families sacrifice alongside them. 
But what makes America the envy of 
the world is not simply the strength of 
our military but the strength of our 
people. 
And 2020 has brought historic chal-
lenges: a global pandemic, a growing 
recession, a reckoning on the systemic 
racism that pervades our country. We 
have also seen an estimated 5.4 million 
American workers lose their health in-
surance between February and May, 
leaving them even more vulnerable to 
a virus surging in every corner of this 
country. 
The 
Sanders-Markey 
amendment 
states that we cannot afford, in this, 
our moment of national crisis, to spend 
three-quarters of a trillion dollars on 
bloated 
defense 
spending—spending 
that is supposed to protect or country 
yet did nothing to inoculate against 
the most profound public health emer-
gency in a century. 
This amendment is also in keeping 
with President Eisenhower’s warning, 
as Senator SANDERS
said, that ‘‘we 
must guard against the acquisition of 
unwarranted influence, whether sought 
or unsought, by the military-industrial 
complex. The potential for the disas-
trous rise of misplaced power exists, 
and will persist.’’ 
Persist it has. This $740 billion fiscal 
year 2021 budget before us is the fulfill-
ment of Ike’s worst fears. In his ad-
dress to the American people, Presi-
dent Eisenhower also predicted that a 
permanent arms industry would come 
to call the shots. After Japan surren-
dered aboard the USS Missouri in 1945, 
ending the Second World War, that per-
manent arms industry made its fixture. 
After we emerged victorious in a his-
toric and ideological struggle against 
the Soviet Union that brought us to 
the brink of nuclear holocaust, Eisen-
hower’s feared permanent arms indus-
try stuck around and retooled to advo-
cate for new weapons to fight the end-
less war to come. 
The catastrophic attacks of Sep-
tember 11 led to more than a doubling 
of the Pentagon’s budget. Multiple 
Presidents have stretched a limited au-
thorization of military force to go after 
those responsible for the 9/11 attacks— 
to fight new enemies in new geog-
raphies, outside of Afghanistan. 
All told, so far, we have spent $6.4 
trillion in the wars in Afghanistan, 
Iraq, Syria, and other places since 2001. 
Even as those wars wind down, the de-
fense industry is pushing for costly 
new acquisition programs to maintain 
superiority over China and Russia. 
The forecasted ‘‘permanent arms in-
dustry’’ begins to explain why the Pen-
tagon accounts for half of the entire 
fiscal year 2021 U.S. discretionary 
budget. Our military budget is larger 
than the next 10 countries combined. 
Our battle fleet is larger than the next 
13 navies combined, with 11 of those 13 
navies represented by our allies or our 
partners. 
However, every dollar spent on the 
Pentagon is one fewer available to 
fight the scourge of poverty in this 
country, to strengthen the social safe-
ty net and protect American families. 
Our communities have suffered while 
we spend ourselves into extreme U.S. 
military dominance. 
I fear that the Pentagon budget we 
debate today shows to a child that we 
don’t prioritize giving him or her a 
quality education; shows mothers and 
fathers that, in the wealthiest country 
in the world, they will forever remain 
one illness away from financial ruin; 
shows a family that the dream of 
homeownership, much less affordable 
rental housing, will remain out of their 
grasp; shows frontline heroes working 
in hospitals and nursing homes in Chel-
sea, MA, and across the country that 
they have no choice but to go work 
sick because their employer does not 
offer paid leave. 
I reject the false choice between a 
strong U.S. military and strong Amer-
ican communities. Trillions of dollars 
in defense spending did nothing to pro-
tect us from the coronavirus pandemic. 
The defense spending can’t protect us 
from the destruction of the environ-
ment and the worsening climate crisis. 
Yet we are due to spend nearly 70 times 
more on defense than we will to protect 
against the next pandemic and other 
global health challenges. 
We must no longer equate national 
security with our inventory of planes, 
missiles, and nuclear weapons system, 
and if coronavirus is truly a war, as 
President Trump says it is, he is duty- 
bound to embrace the fact that na-
tional security also means health, 
housing, and financial security, and na-
tional security means doing everything 
we can to save and improve lives in 
American communities, particularly 
communities of color, that have been 
neglected for too long and that have 
born the worst of the coronavirus im-
pacts. 
Our amendment begins that impor-
tant work by making smart cuts of 10 
percent to the budget of the Pentagon 
for this fiscal year and redirecting 
those funds to the Department of the 
Treasury to administer a grant pro-
gram to strengthen vulnerable, low-in-
come communities.

July 22, 2020 
For example, in Massachusetts, we 
would be eligible to receive up to $1 bil-
lion in Federal funding to create jobs 
by building affordable housing, schools, 
childcare facilities, community health 
centers, public hospitals, libraries, and 
clean drinking water facilities, remov-
ing lead pipes and replacing vacant or 
blighted properties; to improve edu-
cation by hiring more public school 
teachers to reduce class sizes, increas-
ing teacher pay, providing universal 
nutritious meals, and providing free 
tuition to attend public colleges, uni-
versities, or trade schools; and to make 
housing more affordable by providing 
rental 
assistance 
and 
eliminating 
homelessness. 
We should prioritize eradicating pov-
erty, not war. We should prioritize bat-
tling global killer diseases, not devel-
oping a new weapon designed to eradi-
cate the human race. It is time we 
funded education, not annihilation— 
Medicaid, not missiles. 
Where do we start to make Defense 
Department cuts? First, we must end 
the war in Afghanistan, which would 
save tens of billions of dollars. The 
time is long overdue to bring our men 
and women home. And it is time to 
double down on other tools of U.S. 
statecraft—diplomacy 
and 
develop-
ment—to shape a better future for Af-
ghanistan, particularly Afghan women. 
As we work to put a stop to endless 
war and repeal the 2001 AUMF, the 
Pentagon must realign its budget to re-
flect the cold, hard wisdom of Ronald 
Reagan that ‘‘a nuclear war cannot be 
won and must never be fought.’’ 
Between the Departments of Defense 
and Energy, we are due to spend nearly 
$50 billion on nuclear weapons in fiscal 
year 2021. Over the next three decades, 
we are on course to spend $1.7 trillion 
on nuclear weapons overkill. We can 
field a safe, secure, and effective nu-
clear deterrent—one that assures our 
allies and partners—all without break-
ing the bank. 
Our people, not our military parades, 
are the source of American greatness. 
Over the past few months, this country 
has experienced a reckoning, as Ameri-
cans from all walks of life have had 
enough. They have had enough of being 
lied to by the President about the true 
threat of a deadly disease. They have 
had enough of people of color being 
murdered in cold blood by the very po-
lice forces meant to serve and protect 
them. And they have had enough of 
being told there just isn’t enough 
money to support the well-being of 
their communities, while they can see 
billions in taxpayers’ dollars going to 
unnecessary wars and nuclear weapons 
programs and to benefit the President’s 
friends and family. 
The choice today is very clear. We 
are ready to take the smallest step, a 
10-percent cut, to begin to address the 
gap in resources in this country. This 
is the time for us to stand up. We are 
about to have a debate on how much 
money we have to help families in this 
country through this pandemic. We are 
being told that money is not there for 
unemployment insurance; for cities 
and towns not to have to lay off teach-
ers; for cities and towns to have the 
testing, the contact tracing, and the 
personal protective equipment to pro-
tect families in our country; to make 
sure we can provide sick care leave; 
and to make sure we can provide 
childcare for families in this country. 
We are told there is not enough money. 
Yes, there is, and that money is in the 
defense budget of the United States of 
America, so that we can protect those 
families. 
Too many people right now are nos-
talgic for a time that never was, in-
stead of having the idealism which we 
need to battle the issues of today. But 
for the poor, the sick, the elderly, the 
disabled, the Black and Brown and im-
migrant families in this country, the 
past is just a memory and the future is 
their hard reality. 
This is the time for the U.S. Senate 
to stand up and to begin the funding of 
the programs which every family needs 
to protect themselves. I urge an ‘‘aye’’ 
vote on this amendment, and, again, I 
thank Senator SANDERS for his incred-
ible progressive leadership on this issue 
and for so many others. 
I yield back.

The

Three-fifths of the Senators duly cho-
sen and sworn having voted in the af-

The Senator from Iowa. 
CHINA 
Ms. 
ERNST. 
Mr. 
President, 
the 
coronavirus doesn’t come with a label 
saying ‘‘Made in China,’’ but perhaps it 
should. This pandemic, which began in 
Wuhan, China, has flooded the world 
just like so many products from China 
that we all now rely upon to protect 
ourselves against the spread of the con-
tagion. The situation underscores the 
conundrum our Nation faces balancing 
the need to work with the Chinese Gov-
ernment and the challenges of holding 
the Communist Party accountable for 
its devious deeds. 
Plain and simple: The Chinese Com-
munist Party attempted to cover up 
the outbreak of COVID–19 from the 
very beginning and continues to do so 
today. Rather than containing the 
spread of the virus, the regime has fo-
cused on containing knowledge of the 
outbreak, going so far as punishing 
Chinese scientists who dared to warn 
about the virus’s imminent danger. 
As a result, we now face a worldwide 
pandemic that has claimed countless 
victims and could impact every aspect 
of our lives for months, if not years, to 
come. China doesn’t play by the rules. 
They constantly seek to undermine the 
law. And if you ask an Iowa farmer, 
they will tell you the same. 
For years, China has stolen intellec-
tual property and reneged on their 
trade agreements. While we have seen 
China still purchasing some of our corn 
and soybeans, they haven’t completely 
held up their end of the deal when it 
comes to China phase one. 
Folks, when China cheats on trade 
deals, the impact is real: American jobs 
are lost and wealth is transferred from 
the United States to the Communist 
Party of China. This is unacceptable, 
especially after the damage already 
caused to our economy by China’s mis-
handling of the coronavirus outbreak. 
For decades, our leaders in Wash-
ington played along, remaining quiet 
as China stole American intellectual 
property and scientific research, cheat-
ed on trade deals, and violated basic 
human rights. Those days are over. 
President Trump is standing up to 
China 
by 
taking 
decisive 
actions 
against the Communist regime for its 
flagrant violation of trade deals and 
crackdown on the autonomy and rights 
of Hong Kong. 
I have heard this from farmers in 
Iowa. They know that this President is 
standing up for them and pushing back 
on China. And here in the Senate, my 
colleagues and I are also holding China 
accountable. 
Right now, I am laser-focused on de-
creasing our dependency on China for 
critical supplies. The COVID–19 pan-
demic has been what I call a great 
awakening when it comes to the vul-
nerabilities in our supply chain. The 
United States has become far too de-
pendent on Communist China for items 
like personal protective equipment, 
prescription drugs, and other essential 
medical supplies. We need to fix that. 
And that is what I am fighting to do. 
During my military service, includ-
ing as a logistics battalion commander 
in the Iowa Army National Guard, I 
learned firsthand the importance of se-
curing the defense supply chain. We 
cannot continue to rely on our adver-
saries, like China, for critically impor-
tant national security materials. 
That is why, in this year’s annual De-
fense bill, I made it a priority to boost 
support for university research in 
places like Iowa to ensure we can make 
and manufacture metals and materials 
here at home. This will help make sure 
China doesn’t corner the world market 
on key materials. 
Retaking our supply chain from Red 
China also means removing unneces-
sary redtape imposed by Washington. I 
am working to waive the tax penalties 
for manufacturing and medical supply 
companies that choose to relocate to 
America. 
I have also demanded the Treasury 
Department investigate how Chinese 
companies are avoiding taxes that U.S. 
businesses have to pay. 
Iowans across the State have told me 
how much they appreciate this Presi-
dent standing up for them by pushing 
back on the years of bad actions by the 
Communist Party. They also want to 
end our dependence on that same Com-
munist regime. 
Yes, we can and we should continue 
trading important agricultural prod-
ucts. But at the same time, we should 
bring jobs back and make critical sup-
plies ourselves so that when you look 
at a product’s label, it proudly reads 
‘‘Made in the U.S.A.’’ 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Ohio. 
Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, I want 
to thank Senator ERNST for putting 
this colloquy together. What she just 
said with regard to the importance of 
having reliable sources here in Amer-
ica is absolutely right. 
The supply chain issue is one that I 
hope we will address in this COVID 
package—for starters, with regard to 
our personal protective gear, the PPE, 
because if we can’t rely on having 
masks and gowns and other PPE made 
here in America, it is tough for us, par-
ticularly during an international pan-
demic like this, to build and rely on 
countries like China. Also, frankly, 
some of the product that comes from 
China has not been reliable itself. 
I appreciate what you are doing there 
and also the work you are doing to en-
courage us to be more resourceful here 
at home, to be sure we are doing the 
things we have to do to protect our-
selves from foreign influence, including 
China. 
Part of our issue with China, I think, 
is that for the last several years, a lot 
of us point fingers at China and we are 
not pointing fingers, frankly, at our in-
ternal problems. We need to get our 
house in order here in America and 
protect ourselves better. We have legis-
lation to do that, which we just re-
ported out of the Governmental Affairs 
Committee today. It has to do with 
this issue of China coming to the 
United States and systemically tar-
geting promising research and prom-
ising researchers, and saying: We would 
like to get that research. 
The research is often supported by 
the U.S. taxpayer. It is sort of tough

July 22, 2020 
here for us in America to lose our re-
search and our innovation and our in-
tellectual property to other countries. 
It is particularly tough when taxpayers 
pay for it, and $150 billion a year of 
taxpayer money goes to the National 
Institutes of Health, the National 
Science Foundation, and the Depart-
ment of Energy to do basic research. 
That is good. We have helped to de-
velop important therapies and cures for 
some kinds of cancer. We helped to de-
velop the internet. It has been very 
helpful on manufacturing processes. A 
lot of great things have come out of 
that research. 
But one thing that really troubles me 
is that for 20 years now, with China 
taking the lead and other countries, as 
well—Iran, North Korea, and others— 
they have again targeted these re-
searchers and this research and said: 
We want to get that. And, frankly, 
they get it on the cheap because the re-
search is being paid for by our tax dol-
lars. 
Let me give you an example of what 
I am talking about. Recently, in my 
home State of Ohio, there was a case 
along these lines. I applaud the FBI 
and the Department of Justice and our 
U.S. attorneys for finally getting on 
top of this issue. We spent a year 
studying this issue here in the Con-
gress in what is called the Permanent 
Subcommittee 
on 
Investigations, 
which I chair. We found out that this 
was a huge problem and wrote a report 
late last year. 
In the report, we implored our Fed-
eral law enforcement agencies to get 
on this issue. In fact, we had a hearing 
where an FBI agent testified and said 
that it is true. We haven’t been focused 
on this, and we have to make that up 
now. 
They are making up for it. They are 
arresting a number of people. They are 
doing the things that should be done to 
try to stop some of this stealing, real-
ly, of our seed corn, our technology, 
our innovation, our intellectual prop-
erty. 
Here is the Ohio example. Recently, 
the FBI announced that it had arrested 
a researcher connected with the world- 
renowned Cleveland Clinic and Case 
Western Reserve University. This indi-
vidual had received a huge grant from 
the National Institutes of Health, or 
NIH. That grant was for about $3.6 mil-
lion. But then this same individual—of 
course, not telling NIH or telling 
Cleveland Clinic or Case Western or 
anybody 
else—had 
accepted 
money 
from China. 
In the contracts that we were able to 
research 
during 
our 
investigation, 
these contracts with China say you are 
not allowed to reveal that you have 
this relationship with China, that you 
are getting the money from China. 
They not only gave this guy money—$3 
million—but they gave him a deanship 
at Wuhan University. They gave him 
money to hire people in Wuhan. They 
gave him the ability to travel around 
America recruiting others. We think he 
recruited 30 or 40 people, according to 
the FBI. 
Again, these are all allegations. His 
arrest has been made. He actually is al-
leged to have taken biological samples 
from Cleveland, OH, to China—this tax-
payer-paid 
NIH 
research—literally, 
physically taking these to China. They 
also, by the way, provided lodging for 
him with a three-bedroom apartment 
in Wuhan. That is luxury. 
This is about money. Unfortunately, 
this is about people who are not patri-
ots but instead are willing to sell us 
out by selling their research, their ex-
pertise that our taxpayers have funded 
to China and other countries. 
NIH, recently, by the way, fired or 
forced the resignation of 54 research-
ers—not 1 or 2 or 3, but 54 people. We 
have been pushing them hard to find 
out who these people are and what they 
are doing. They haven’t been willing to 
reveal that yet because this is a matter 
under investigation. They have told us 
that of those who are under investiga-
tion at NIH, 90 percent have ties to 
China—90 percent. 
Wake up, America. Here we are. We 
are in a situation where other coun-
tries, particularly China, have targeted 
American research, American research-
ers, and are now taking this back to 
China to benefit their military, to ben-
efit their economy, and to benefit their 
healthcare system. 
By the way, I do not believe this is 
for academic purposes. It is wrong 
what is happening, but it is even more 
wrong because this is not as if they are 
taking it back to do joint research on 
an academic basis. 
Let me tell you what the State De-
partment told us at our hearing on this 
topic at the end of last year. They said: 
‘‘The Chinese Communist Party has de-
clared the Chinese university system 
to be on the front line of military-civil-
ian fusion efforts for technology acqui-
sition.’’ 
This is our own State Department. 
That means there is a clear link be-
tween the research that is being taken 
in America and the latest advancement 
in China’s military and its economy. 
It has been happening for 20 years. It 
is time to put an end to it. The legisla-
tion that we were able to get through 
committee today takes a really impor-
tant step in that direction. There are 
four or five elements of it. 
One of the most important to me is 
giving the FBI and law enforcement 
the tools they need to go after these in-
dividuals by creating a new criminal 
law that says if you lie on these forms, 
if you are taking money from China, it 
is certainly a conflict of commitment 
and a conflict of interest. You can be 
taken to task for that and held ac-
countable. Right now you can’t. 
They are arresting these people on 
things like mail fraud, tax evasion. It 
is a little like how they used to go 
after gangsters before there were laws 
directly related to racketeering and so 
on. This is something where we need to 
be sure that we are giving people the 
tools that they need. 
We also help the State Department 
to keep these people out, and we help 
with regard to our universities to en-
sure that we are reporting and being 
transparent as to the money univer-
sities are receiving from China and 
other countries. 
Again, I thank my colleague from 
Iowa for having this colloquy. I see we 
have two other colleagues here. I know 
they are really well-versed and in-
volved in these issues, and I want to 
hear from them, as well. 
I would just say that I hope, on a bi-
partisan basis—by the way, our legisla-
tion is bipartisan. Our investigation 
was bipartisan. I would say this is non-
partisan. This is an American issue. We 
should all be standing up to protect the 
American research enterprise and to be 
sure that our taxpayers, when they pay 
for this important research, have the 
benefit of it rather than its being 
taken, in particular, by China to ben-
efit their military and their economy, 
which has been going on for 2 decades. 
It is time to wake up. 
I yield to my colleague from Arizona. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Arizona. 
Ms. MCSALLY. I thank my colleague 
from Ohio and others here from Florida 
and Iowa for coming together to talk 
about this important American issue 
and national security issue. 
I served 26 years in the military. In 
my last years in service and since then, 
we have seen the threat of the rise of 
China. It is a threat to America’s secu-
rity, our jobs, and our role as a leader 
in the world. They are on a deliberate 
path to try to dominate the world and 
shape it into their vision. They need to 
be stopped. 
When I was a cadet at the Air Force 
Academy, we had an honor code that 
said: ‘‘I will not lie, cheat, or steal, or 
tolerate among us anyone who does.’’ 
China has been lying, cheating, and 
stealing for far too long. Americans are 
now waking up to this threat and are 
resolved to change the trajectory and 
hold China accountable, but this can’t 
be done by us alone. Our European 
partners and others in the Pacific and 
elsewhere need to join with us and also 
wake up to China’s dangerous path and 
work with us to stop them. 
We 
have 
been 
calling 
this 
geostrategic shift a return to ‘‘Great 
Power Competition,’’ as if to assume 
that we are all playing by the same 
rules. We aren’t. China is playing by 
their own rules and cheating the sys-
tem for their own gain and power. The 
Chinese Communist Party is a reck-
less, predatory adversary that is dedi-
cated to subverting U.S. interests and 
supplanting our Nation as the world’s 
dominant leader. 
Over the past 10 years, China has in-
creased their military spending by 85 
percent. Their investment in defense 
has been used to build their navy, ex-
pand 
their 
missile 
stockpile, 
and 
emerge as a leader in technologies like 
hypersonics, cyber warfare, and artifi-
cial intelligence.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S4378 
July 22, 2020 
This buildup has been far from defen-
sive alone. From their illegal maritime 
claims among several sovereign states, 
then building artificial islands where 
they didn’t exist before to militarize 
them in the South China Sea with 
their maneuvers and exercises that are 
aggressive and belligerent, to their 
covert 
attempts 
to 
infiltrate 
the 
United States through our universities 
and stealing our technology, Chinese 
forces are expanding their tentacles far 
beyond our borders, to the detriment of 
American national security interests. 
Congress must do our part to respond 
to this threat. For these reasons, I in-
troduced several pieces of legislation 
that immediately stopped China from 
taking advantage of government funds 
and taxpayer dollars to purchase prod-
ucts and services from Chinese compa-
nies with ties to Chinese military. 
To end our reliance on China’s con-
trol and manufacturing of PPE, I intro-
duced legislation to authorize the 
President 
to 
incentivize 
American 
companies to produce medical devices, 
equipment, and drugs. 
We 
saw 
at 
the 
onset 
of 
the 
coronavirus that it was clear that out-
sourcing the production of PPE to an 
adversary was wrong and risky. I wit-
nessed firsthand the ingenuity of Ari-
zona companies that stepped up to help 
fill the gap. That is no excuse for ig-
noring the fact that we have to bring 
manufacturing home of vital medical 
equipment and PPE so that, once 
again, it is made in America. 
Finally, the coronavirus outbreak 
has taken a catastrophic toll on our 
country and the world. Make no mis-
take. The virus began in China and 
spread globally because the Chinese 
Government lied about what they knew 
about it, and they destroyed evidence 
and 
silenced 
doctors 
and 
whistle-
blowers. 
Like the rest of the Nation, Arizona 
has suffered devastating consequences 
due to this pandemic. Already, we have 
lost over 2,900 Arizonans, plus the eco-
nomic toll. 
Communist 
China 
unleashed 
this 
virus on the world, and it should face 
severe repercussions for their coverups 
and lies about the origins and spread. 
China’s actions cost lives and dev-
astated the world economy, and it 
must be held accountable. 
I moved to do just that this week by 
introducing the Civil Justice for Vic-
tims of COVID Act. Americans who 
have been victimized by the lies and 
deceit of the Communist Party—to in-
clude those who lost loved ones, suf-
fered business losses, or personally 
harmed—deserve the opportunity to 
hold China accountable and demand 
just compensation. 
I appreciate many of my colleagues 
joining with me on this legislation. It 
is due time that we hold China ac-
countable for their malevolent behav-
ior—not just over the past several 
months but over several decades. 
The United States must take imme-
diate action and, with strength, dem-
onstrate that the greatest country in 
the world will not be taken for a fool. 
Our Republic and our freedoms that it 
stands for will allow our country to 
prevail over China’s Communist and 
rogue agenda. With American will, 
American innovation, and the Amer-
ican spirit, we will prevail. 
I appreciate my colleague from Flor-
ida joining as well. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Florida. 
Mr. SCOTT of Florida. I want to rec-
ognize my colleagues from Arizona, 
Ohio, Texas, and Iowa for their com-
mitment to holding Communist China 
accountable and supporting Americans. 
I rise today to discuss the threat of 
Communist China—a threat that poses 
a huge risk to the national security of 
the United States, our allies, and the 
stability of world markets. 
Communist China is simply stealing 
American jobs and technology and spy-
ing on our citizens. 
General Secretary of the Communist 
Party Xi is a dictator and a human 
rights violator who is denying basic 
rights to the people of Hong Kong, 
cracking down on dissidents, threat-
ening Taiwan, and militarizing the 
South China Sea. 
Uighur 
prisoners 
in 
Communist 
China are being rounded up, blind-
folded, shaved, and loaded onto trains 
to be taken to concentration camps 
simply because of their religion. You 
can’t believe this is happening today in 
this world. 
Communist China’s deceptions sur-
rounding the coronavirus pandemic 
should be the last straw for every 
American. It doesn’t matter to Com-
munist China that their lies and misin-
formation killed hundreds of thousands 
of people around the world. Communist 
China is on a mission to be the domi-
nant world power. Chairman Xi will 
stop at nothing to grow Communist 
China’s 
influence. 
For 
Communist 
China and Chairman Xi, this great 
power conflict is a zero-sum game. In 
order for China to be stronger, America 
and 
all 
freedom-loving 
countries 
around the world must be weaker. We 
can’t allow that to happen. It is time 
we finally stand up and address the 
new Cold War occurring between the 
United States and the Chinese Com-
munist Party. 
For too long, Washington politicians 
have been more concerned with short- 
term political success than with the 
long-term threats to our way of life— 
but not anymore. It is time for action. 
We can no longer rely on countries like 
Communist China for our critical sup-
ply chain. We need to build up the na-
tional stockpile of PPE and our phar-
maceutical industry with supplies from 
American-based producers. We can no 
longer accept Chinese technology that 
could be used to spy on us, and we are 
working to prohibit the Federal Gov-
ernment from purchasing drones from 
our adversaries. 
We can no longer allow Communist 
China to steal from us. We have to be 
aggressive in protecting American re-
search and American innovation, in-
cluding potentially lifesaving research 
into a coronavirus vaccine. We should 
do everything we can to stop buying 
products ‘‘Made in China’’ because, 
every time we do, we are putting an-
other dollar into the pockets of those 
stealing our technology, denying their 
people basic human rights, and prop-
ping 
up 
dangerous 
dictators 
like 
Maduro in Venezuela. 
We have to hold Communist China 
accountable and financially liable for 
its lies that led to the coronavirus. It 
is responsible for the devastation. We 
have to stand up and say that it is 
wrong to allow Beijing to host the 2022 
Olympics. That is wrong. The world 
community cannot condone or reward 
its despicable behavior and human 
rights violations. 
It is important to be clear-eyed. We 
have to see Communist China for what 
it is. We all must do our part to sup-
port our Nation and make it clear to 
Communist China that the people of 
the United States will not stand for its 
behavior. 
I will not stop fighting until our fu-
ture and the futures of all of our chil-
dren and our grandchildren are secure 
from this threat. 
I yield to my colleague from Texas. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Texas. 
Mr. CRUZ. Mr. President, I rise to 
join my colleagues in discussing the 
single greatest geopolitical threat fac-
ing the United States for the next cen-
tury, and that is the rise of Communist 
China. 
We are, right now, months into a 
deadly 
global 
pandemic 
that 
has 
sickened over 14 million people world-
wide and has taken the lives of over 
600,000 people. Why are we in the midst 
of a global pandemic? It is because the 
Chinese Communist Party deliberately 
lied to the world. It covered up the out-
break and allowed it to spread. The 
coronavirus pandemic has thrown into 
high relief the fact that China is our 
most dangerous threat. 
For 8 years in the U.S. Senate, I have 
worked hard to lead the fight to ad-
dress the threat of Chinese Communist 
power and aggression and hostility 
head-on, to make the U.S. economy as 
free and independent from China as 
possible, and to thwart the never-end-
ing propaganda and censorship cam-
paign from the Chinese Communists. 
Last week, the Chinese Communist 
Government made the decision to sanc-
tion me personally, so I am now—I 
awoke to discover—prohibited from 
traveling to Communist China. Some-
how, I think I will overcome that great 
burden, and I will tell you I wear Chi-
na’s sanction as a badge of honor. 
There is a reason they are lashing out. 
There is a reason it has decided to di-
rect personal sanctions on me—because 
they are scared; they are terrified. The 
Chinese Communists are murdering, 
lying, torturing tyrants.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S4379 
July 22, 2020 
For a long time in Washington, there 
were politicians in both parties—Demo-
crats 
and 
Republicans—who 
were 
apologists for China, who denied the 
threat was there, who insisted that the 
path forward was getting more and 
more and more in bed with the Chinese 
Communists. 
The 
most 
significant 
long-term foreign policy consequence 
of this global pandemic is that people’s 
eyes are opening up on both sides of 
the aisle here in Washington and across 
the world. One need look no further 
than the United Kingdom’s reversing 
its decision to allow Huawei to build 
its telecom infrastructure in order to 
understand how China’s mendacity has 
been revealed to the world. 
So how do we hold China account-
able? How do we deal with the Chinese 
Communist Party? 
First of all, we should sanction Chi-
nese officials involved in the ongoing 
suppression of medical experts, of jour-
nalists, and of political dissidents, all 
of whom have been ‘‘disappeared’’ by 
the Chinese tyrants. I have introduced 
legislation to do just that. Over the 
past several years, I have introduced, 
roughly, a dozen separate pieces of leg-
islation that have all focused on dif-
ferent aspects of addressing the China 
threat. 
Another aspect is Chinese propa-
ganda—Chinese propaganda that is re-
flected here in the United States. Big 
Business, 
giant 
corporations, 
the 
media, Hollywood all are terrified to 
take on Communist China. All see the 
billions they can earn from access to 
the Chinese markets as being more im-
portant than free speech. 
With respect to Hollywood, sadly, too 
many movie producers here in the 
United States have been perfectly con-
tent to allow the Chinese Communists 
to censor American movies. For exam-
ple, later this year, the sequel to ‘‘Top 
Gun’’ is scheduled to come out—‘‘Top 
Gun,’’ one of the greatest military re-
cruiting films ever made. In the sequel, 
on the back of Maverick’s bomber jack-
et, the flag of Taiwan has been re-
moved and the flag of Japan, both of 
which the Chinese overlords deemed to 
be offensive, and our heroic First 
Amendment champions in Hollywood 
dutifully complied with censorship. 
By the way, it needn’t just concern 
geopolitical affairs in Asia. With an-
other Hollywood movie, ‘‘Bohemian 
Rhapsody’’—a 
fabulous 
biopic 
of 
Freddie Mercury, the lead singer for 
Queen—the Chinese censors decided it 
offended their sensibilities to have 
scenes in the movie that revealed that 
Freddie Mercury was homosexual. Now, 
I ask you to pause for a second and ask: 
How on Earth do you tell Freddie 
Mercury’s life story without including 
the fact that he was gay? It was inte-
gral to who he was. Yet those in Holly-
wood, which on so many other issues 
are glad to be woke social justice war-
riors, dutifully complied when the Chi-
nese censors said to take it out, and 
they deleted the scenes from ‘‘Bohe-
mian Rhapsody.’’ 
I have introduced legislation in this 
body called the SCRIPT Act that will 
impose consequences when American 
companies allow the Chinese Govern-
ment to censor our films. The con-
sequences are simple. We don’t have 
the power as the government to impose 
direct negative consequences, but what 
we do have the power to do is to use 
the incentives we have; namely, lots of 
movies borrow Federal assets. When 
you go watch a movie and see a plane 
or a ship or a tank or when you go 
watch a movie on the border and you 
see DHS assets, all sorts of Federal 
agencies allow movies to use equip-
ment that is the property of the Fed-
eral Government. The SCRIPT Act is 
very simple. It says, if you are going to 
allow the Chinese Communists to cen-
sor your movie, the Federal Govern-
ment is not going to loan you our 
equipment and materiel. We are not 
going to facilitate making a movie if 
you are going to give the Chinese Com-
munists the editing and censoring pen. 
Not only do the Chinese Communists 
engage in propaganda in Hollywood, 
but they also engage in espionage and 
propaganda on our university cam-
puses—a very deliberate, systematic ef-
fort to steal and deceive. In the Na-
tional Defense Authorization Act for 
Fiscal Year 2019, I was proud to secure 
a funding prohibition for the Depart-
ment of Defense from funding univer-
sities where the money could go to a 
Confucius Institute. As a result of that 
bipartisan legislation, which earned 
support from Republicans and Demo-
crats, 17 Confucius Institutes have been 
shut down. 
When it comes to our supply chain, 
we have seen, in recent months, the in-
credible foolishness of allowing the 
American supply chain to be dependent 
on China—medical equipment, pharma-
ceuticals, PPE. In the midst of this 
pandemic, one Chinese Government 
state-controlled newspaper explicitly 
threatened to cut off lifesaving phar-
maceuticals to the United States of 
America as a tool of economic warfare. 
If it were to do that, that wouldn’t just 
be economic warfare—that would be ac-
tual warfare. That is literally threat-
ening the lives of millions of Ameri-
cans. 
We need to break our supply chain 
dependence on China, especially con-
cerning critical infrastructure, and I 
have introduced hosts of legislation de-
signed to do so with respect to pharma-
ceuticals, with respect to critical min-
erals. We have to keep the American 
people’s lives and safety not dependent 
upon the whims of Communist China. 
In my final point right now, in China 
today, there are, roughly, 1 million 
Uighurs in concentration camps—an 
Orwellian-style, dystopian government, 
where the government has all power to 
monitor what you say, to monitor 
whom you talk to, to monitor your be-
liefs. I introduced legislation to impose 
sanctions on any American technology 
companies that facilitate the moni-
toring and oppression of the Chinese 
people. I am proud to say the Trump 
administration took major portions of 
that legislation I introduced and im-
plemented them to increase the pres-
sure to stop facilitating Chinese tor-
ture and oppression. 
The overwhelming challenge for this 
body and for this country for the next 
century going forward is how we will 
stand up to the threat of China. China 
is waging a 1,000-year war. For the sake 
not only of Americans but for the sake 
of the free world, America needs to win 
this contest. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Tennessee. 
Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. President, I 
was thinking a bit earlier today about 
what we were doing at this time last 
year. We were busy hosting Tennessee 
Tuesdays and welcoming Tennesseans 
and families and children with such cu-
riosity and bright eyes and lots of 
questions about our Nation’s govern-
ment, about these beautiful buildings 
in which we work every day, and about 
the job that we have in representing 
them. I like that curiosity, and I like 
that energy that, generally, is brought 
to our Chambers and to our work dur-
ing the summertime. This year, things 
really are a little bit different. I think 
it is a very worthwhile exercise—and I 
appreciate that my colleagues are par-
ticipating in this exercise—to remind 
ourselves why this year is different. 
The answer, of course, as to why is 
this year different is the Chinese Com-
munist Party. It is the one that is to be 
held responsible, to be blamed for the 
sickness, the chaos, for this crisis that 
we have had, which is a health, food, 
and financial crisis all rolled into one. 
It has happened because of decisions 
that China made, decisions that were 
made by the Chinese Communist Par-
ty’s leadership. 
There are some things that are the 
known knowns, if you will. They are 
the things that we know happened as 
you look back over what has happened 
with COVID–19. 
What we know is this: On December 
31, 2019, government officials in Wuhan, 
China, confirmed they were monitoring 
the spread of a disease that looked a 
lot like pneumonia. They didn’t know 
exactly what it was. It didn’t have all 
the markers, but a lot. But on New 
Year’s Eve, they let us know: Hey, we 
have a problem out here. Just days 
later, they confirmed it was caused by 
a novel virus that had infected dozens 
of people. We now know it was hun-
dreds of people. 
It wasn’t until January 23, however, 
that authorities shut off Wuhan from 
the rest of the country. By this time, 
the virus was spreading like wildfire. 
Let’s pay close attention to what I just 
said. They shut off Hubei Province, 
they shut off Wuhan not from the rest 
of the world, not from other countries, 
but from the rest of China. Don’t you 
dare go anywhere else in our country. 
This is contagious.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S4380 
July 22, 2020 
Now, as if that 23-day gap wasn’t bad 
enough, credible watchdog reports re-
vealed that the CCP—Chinese Com-
munist Party—lied—they lied to global 
health officials about the danger posed 
by the virus for not just a day or two 
while they figured it out but for 51 days 
before they sounded the alarm and 
said: Listen up. Pandemic. Pandemic. 
Fifty-one days. This deception allowed 
a regional outbreak to spread into a 
global pandemic that has so far killed 
more than 140,000 Americans. 
It would be easy to chalk all of this 
up to incompetence and overwhelmed 
bureaucrats, but every Member of this 
body knows that is not what happened. 
That is why, over the past few weeks, 
more and more of my colleagues here 
in the Senate have agreed to support 
legislation that will allow Americans 
to hold China accountable for the de-
struction caused by the pandemic. 
On Monday, Senator MCSALLY intro-
duced the Civil Justice for Victims of 
COVID Act—a bill that I am very 
pleased to support and to be a cospon-
sor. This bill contains elements of my 
Stop COVID Act, which I introduced 
earlier this year. It would strip Chinese 
officials of their sovereign immunity 
for reckless actions that caused the 
pandemic and would give our Federal 
courts the authority to hear claims 
that China has caused or contributed 
to the COVID–19 pandemic. This is not 
an unusual step. We did this after 9/11 
for the 9/11 families. What we would do 
is give them the opportunity to go to 
court and make their case—hold China 
accountable. 
It is time for this body to reject the 
artificial backstops that some of my 
colleagues on the other side of the aisle 
use to protect China from criticism, 
and I encourage those colleagues to ask 
themselves: What are you afraid will 
happen if we hold China accountable 
for what they have done? What do you 
fear? 
We have known for years that Beijing 
uses every tool in its toolbox to spy on 
us. Look at what we have learned 
about Huawei. They embed the chips in 
the hardware. You do not know they 
are there until they activate. We know 
they steal our intellectual property. 
Look at what they have done to the 
music industry, to the entertainment 
industry, to publishers, and to auto-
motive engineers. China—they can’t in-
novate their way to success, so what do 
they do? They steal their way to suc-
cess, and then they lie about it. 
China continues to cause chaos on 
the international stage. Look at their 
work pushing into the South China 
Sea. Look at what they have done to 
the freedom fighters in Hong Kong. 
Look at how they act and how they 
pressure and try to stifle Taiwan. This 
is standard operating procedure for the 
Chinese Communist Party. 
Now, because they chose to lie and 
not come forward, we have more than 
140,000 Americans who are dead. Mil-
lions more have lost their jobs, and 
they have lost their sense of commu-
nity. How much further are we willing 
to let this go? I will tell you this: As I, 
every single day, talk to Tennesseans 
about China and what has happened 
with China and how China has not been 
an honest broker, not only in this but 
for decades, Tennesseans have had 
enough. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Oklahoma. 
Mr. LANKFORD. Mr. President, the 
world is watching and dealing with 
COVID–19—the economic effects and 
health effects. It has affected every 
single one of our families in some way. 
While the world is watching and we 
are dealing with all those issues here in 
the United States, we can’t lose track 
of what is happening on the world 
stage because China is using this mo-
ment when the world is distracted to 
push its way into Hong Kong and to 
break its word. 
When we deal with China, we know 
what they have done, the predatory 
tactics they have taken either on their 
own people or on countries around the 
world. 
The United States of America—when 
we do foreign aid, we go help other 
countries gain more freedom, more se-
curity, more stability, and more eco-
nomic growth. We don’t ask anything 
in return. We engage with them to help 
them. 
China is working with developing 
countries around the world by moving 
into different countries and taking col-
lateral of their ports, of their airports, 
and establishing military bases around 
the world when poorer countries de-
fault on the loans they give them. 
They are not helping other countries; 
they are taking over other countries. 
They are stepping into country after 
country and offering them great new 
technology from Huawei to help their 
cell phone systems. They are estab-
lishing security systems around their 
banks. But what they are really doing 
is monitoring their people and gath-
ering data on people all around the 
world. The security systems aren’t 
there to set up and prop up dictator-
ships in poor countries; they are there 
for the dictatorship of China to track 
what is going on there and any inter-
national development. 
We should be aware of what China is 
doing, and we should not ignore this 
moment for the free people of Hong 
Kong. 
Today, many Americans are aware of 
how China has handled the issue of pro-
tective equipment. The medical equip-
ment that we desperately needed in 
March, April, May—much of it manu-
factured in China—we could not get be-
cause the Communist Government of 
China kept the materials from Amer-
ican companies that were manufac-
turing in China. The Chinese Com-
munist Government wouldn’t allow the 
exportation of that, and they just took 
that equipment over, putting all of the 
schedules behind. Suddenly, Americans 
woke up and understood that our sup-
ply chains are at risk. Our pharma-
ceutical supply chains are at risk, and 
our PPE supply chains are at risk. 
What many people don’t know is that 
our rare earth minerals and critical 
minerals supply chain is at risk. Lots 
of folks really like the solar panels and 
electric car batteries. Well, great—ex-
cept we are completely dependent on 
China for the rare earth minerals that 
are in those. 
If we don’t develop our own sourcing 
for those rare earth minerals—and we 
do have those same rare earth minerals 
here—if we don’t develop our own sup-
ply chain, if we don’t develop our own 
manufacturing 
for 
pharmaceuticals 
and for the precursors of pharma-
ceuticals, we will continue to be vul-
nerable to the Chinese Government, 
and at the moment the Communist 
government determines, they will take 
over that supply, and we will be at 
risk. 
For decades, the Confucius Institutes 
have thrived on college campuses, 
spreading a Communist philosophy all 
through our college campuses. It is 
now at a moment that college cam-
puses and leadership in colleges are 
starting to wake up to say: Why are we 
allowing Communist indoctrination on 
our campuses? 
It is a bill that I have pushed, that I 
will continue to push to be able to 
wake up our universities, to say: Why 
are we allowing this on our campus? 
It is an issue that I have pushed for 
years, 
dealing 
with 
Chinese 
Com-
munists spying on American tech-
nology, stealing technology, and also 
stealing our science and inventions. 
They come over with a grant from 
the United States and say they are 
going to send over researchers, when 
really what they are doing is har-
vesting the research and taking it back 
to China. 
They take materials, whether it be 
music or movies or any items of pro-
duction, and all that manufacturing 
that comes to China, they then take 
that same technology, move it to a dif-
ferent factory, and literally compete 
against the first company, because to 
do business in China, you have to turn 
over all your intellectual property to 
the 
Communist 
government, 
which 
then takes it and uses it on their own. 
The Chinese Communist Government 
is not the ally of freedom for the world, 
and we should be aware of that. Cer-
tainly the people of Hong Kong are 
aware of that. 
In 1997, after 150 years as a British 
territory, Hong Kong became a part of 
China under the Joint Declaration. It 
was one country, two systems—that 
Hong Kong for 50 years would remain 
autonomous and free. 
Well, just over two decades later, the 
Chinese Government has broken its 
promise, and Hong Kong is no longer 
free. While the world is consumed with 
what is happening with COVID–19, the 
Communist government has moved 
into Hong Kong and has taken it over. 
They passed a law in Beijing that they

sent over and declared in Hong Kong 
that they can’t have any of what they 
call subversion, organization or perpet-
uation of what they call terroristic ac-
tivities, collusion with a foreign coun-
try or an external element, which I will 
explain later. 
This new security law literally was 
delivered to the people of Hong Kong at 
midnight, and it went into place imme-
diately. Then the next step was that 
the Chinese Communist police—mili-
tary 
law 
enforcement—moved 
into 
Hong Kong to begin to implement this. 
Free speech immediately stopped. 
Those protesters who were out on the 
street just wishing to be able to vote 
and to speak their mind were imme-
diately rounded up. 
Teachers and academics have been 
arrested or fired or threatened. Com-
munist Chinese leaders have contacted 
them to reprimand them about teach-
ing about human rights in their class-
rooms, remembering that in Hong 
Kong it was required—it was a required 
class in Hong Kong just weeks ago—to 
learn about human rights and freedom, 
and now the Chinese Government is re-
moving those teachers and threatening 
any other teacher who teaches about 
human rights that they will be re-
moved. 
Faith leaders have been squashed. 
You see, under this security law that 
has passed, you can’t have any external 
element collusion. They define ‘‘exter-
nal element’’ as any kind of worship of 
God as well that does not align with 
the Communist Government. So any 
faith-based group who is there in Hong 
Kong is immediately being squashed. 
The Muslim Uighurs are gathered up 
in Communist China and put in con-
centration camps to reeducate them on 
how to be more Chinese. Now the peo-
ple of Hong Kong are experiencing that 
same type of oppression as the first 
step has stepped in to take away their 
right to free speech, their right to 
gather and protest, and now also their 
right to have freedom of faith. Leaders 
of the democracy movement have al-
ready been rounded up and arrested. 
This is something that we should not 
ignore. We have said as a world ‘‘Never 
again,’’ and we should engage. 
I know many people in my State say 
we should focus on COVID–19, and we 
should. There is much that needs to be 
done. We cannot take our eyes off of 
freedom around the world, as well, and 
the people of Hong Kong. As they lose 
their freedom, the world loses freedom, 
and China sees it can move into one 
more place one more time. Taiwan is 
next, and they will continue to move in 
this same way. We should stay en-
gaged. 
There are multiple bills this body has 
already done on sanctions, and we 
should continue. We should continue to 
press in and speak out for those who 
cannot speak for themselves in Hong 
Kong. They are being isolated. Senator 
TIM KAINE and I just dropped a bill yes-
terday dealing with internet freedom 
for the people of Hong Kong, saying 
that the American Government should 
be engaged in trying to break through 
what is called the great firewall in 
China. We know they will extend this 
firewall into Hong Kong, as well, and 
will prevent the people from Hong 
Kong from access to social media, in-
formation with each other, or informa-
tion from the outside world, just as 
they have with the people of China. 
But the people of Hong Kong have 
grown up and lived in freedom, and 
they know what it means to get out-
side information, and the Chinese Gov-
ernment is actively working to shut 
that down. We should actively work to 
push back on that to make sure the 
free people of Hong Kong continue to 
communicate with each other and with 
the outside world. We can stay engaged 
with that basic function of human 
rights. That is why Senator KAINE and 
I are so passionate about this. 
We should engage as a government to 
make sure that they can continue to 
have the free speech that we have. 
When anyone loses their human rights 
and dignities, the world loses human 
rights and dignities. 
Again, I am aware that there are 
many things that need to happen with 
COVID–19 right now, and we are ac-
tively working on those things as well, 
and we should. But we should not lose 
track of freedom. Freedom is our re-
sponsibility to model and to live and to 
help other free people to guard. Let’s 
stand with the people of Hong Kong. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Connecticut. 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST—S. 3627 
Mr. MURPHY. Mr. President, I am 
glad to have the opportunity to talk 
for a bit on the floor of the U.S. Senate 
on U.S. policy toward China because 
there has been no better friend for Chi-
nese interests likely in our lifetime 
than President Donald J. Trump. 
Articles suggest that when you sur-
vey Chinese Communist Party leaders, 
they are, to a person, rooting for the 
reelection of this President. I don’t 
need to go through the litany of ways 
in which China has become more influ-
ential and more powerful all around 
the world because of this administra-
tion’s policies, but at the top of that 
list is the abdication of the United 
States’ traditional leadership role on 
human rights, which has allowed the 
Communist Party to march on the 
Uighurs and others. It is a failed trade 
policy that has allowed China to ex-
tend its influence into places like Afri-
ca and throughout the Silk Road. It is 
America’s break with Europe that has 
shattered our ability to negotiate to-
gether the future rules of the economic 
order. 
But what China is really ecstatic 
about is this President’s performance 
since March in the wake of a virus that 
now shows the United States as having 
25 percent of the world’s COVID cases 
while having only 4 percent of the 
world’s population. 
My friend Senator BLACKBURN recited 
the early moments of this virus out-
break in China, and she is right that 
China 
was 
nontransparent 
and 
unhelpful in those early days. But do 
you know who the greatest cheerleader 
for China was in the first 2 to 3 months 
of COVID–19’s outbreak there? Presi-
dent Donald Trump. On 45 occasions he 
went on social media or gave state-
ments to the press in which he lauded 
China’s response. He talked about how 
transparent they were and how they 
were doing a great job. The world com-
munity couldn’t put pressure on China 
to open up with respect to what they 
knew about the virus in large part be-
cause the leader of the Nation’s most 
powerful country was doing the bidding 
of the Chinese Government. 
The second thing that this President 
has done that makes China very, very 
pleased is to essentially make the ar-
gument for the Chinese that the auto-
cratic model that they are perfecting is 
the best method by which to organize 
society around the world, because they 
say: Listen, we got this virus under 
control in a matter of months, and the 
world’s greatest democracy is still 
dealing with an epidemic that looks to 
be raging newly out of control. So as 
we engage in this broad fight between 
models of governance, our inability— 
this administration’s inability—to get 
this virus under control is maybe the 
greatest gift that this President has 
given to China. 
Here is what makes it so unconscion-
able: We know that democracy is inef-
ficient. We know that capital markets 
can sometimes be inefficient when 
pressed up against the wall by emer-
gencies. So we built into the statutes 
of the United States emergency powers 
to give to this President—to any Presi-
dent—so that when they are faced with 
an emergency, they can cure some of 
the inefficiencies of democracy. 
We are on the floor today—Senators 
BALDWIN, STABENOW, BROWN, and I—to 
talk about one particular power this 
President has. It is an act called the 
Defense Production Act, and it allows 
the President during moments of emer-
gency to commandeer parts of the 
manufacturing supply chain in this 
country to make sure we are making 
everything we need in order to repel a 
foreign invader. Sometimes that may 
be an army, but in this case it is a 
pathogen. 
What we have known from the very 
beginning is that there was no way for 
this country to have enough personal 
protective 
equipment—masks, 
face 
shields, gowns, and gloves—and there 
was no way for this country to be able 
to have enough tests to know who has 
it so that we can track it and get rid of 
it without the Federal Government 
stepping up and utilizing the Defense 
Production Act. 
Twenty percent of nursing homes 
today have less than a week’s supply of 
PPE. 
Doctors at one hospital in Houston, 
where the outbreak is raging out of 
control, are being told to wear their 
N95 masks for 15 days in a row when it 
is recommended for a single use.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S4382 
July 22, 2020 
The national strategic stockpile once 
had 82 million gloves. Today they have 
less than 1 million. 
Guess what. It is going to get worse. 
More people need to be tested. Schools 
are 
about 
to 
reopen. 
The 
super-
intendent of the 100,000-student Jeffer-
son County school district in Louis-
ville, KY, says that he needs $10 mil-
lion to order face masks alone. It is 
going to cost schools across this coun-
try $25 billion to purchase medical sup-
plies, and these medical supplies are 
going up in price because the supply is 
so low. We have a solution: the Defense 
Production Act. 
We also don’t have enough tests. It 
now takes 7 to 10 to 14 days to get a 
test back. In Connecticut, it used to 
take just 1 day. You can’t beat this 
virus if you don’t get results for 7 to 10 
days. That person who gets tested goes 
out and spreads it during that time. 
James Davis from Quest Diagnostics 
said: 
We would double our capacity tomorrow 
. . . but it’s not the labs that are the bottle-
neck. [It] is our ability to get physical ma-
chines and . . . our ability to feed those ma-
chines with chemical reagents. 
That is equipment that could be pro-
duced in the United States if the Presi-
dent took control of the manufacturing 
supply chain—not forever, but to the 
extent of this crisis. 
So the Medical Supply Transparency 
and Delivery Act, which Senator BALD-
WIN and my colleagues will talk more 
about, essentially picks up the ball the 
President has dropped and commands 
the President to operationalize the De-
fense Production Act and put some-
body in charge of its effectuation to 
make sure we are producing in this 
country all of the medical equipment— 
the masks, the gloves, the testing re-
agents, the cartridges—that it is pos-
sible to produce in this Nation. 
The level of gleeful, willing, know-
ing, purposeful incompetence from this 
administration is absolutely stunning, 
and no one should normalize an admin-
istration that has the power to save 
lives and refuses to operationalize it. 
Why won’t this administration take 
control of the supply chain? Why are 
they willing to let people die? States 
can’t run the supply chain by them-
selves. It is a national and inter-
national supply chain. Hospitals can’t 
create their own supply chain. They 
need to be focused on saving lives, not 
being miniprocurement organizations. 
We know that democracies and capi-
talist economies are by nature and de-
sign often inefficient when faced with 
these urgent crises. That is why we 
give Presidents these enormous but 
temporary powers to smooth out the 
inefficiencies of a multibranch, multi-
jurisdictional democracy. 
When it comes to calling in the Fed-
eral troops to beat the hell out of pro-
testers, this President seems perfectly 
willing to exercise his powers as Com-
mander in Chief, but when it comes to 
making sure that my kids’ teachers or 
my local doctor has a mask this fall, 
this President is all of a sudden impo-
tent. It falls to us, Members of the U.S. 
Congress, to stand up and pass legisla-
tion, the Medical Supply Transparency 
and Delivery Act, to make sure—to 
make sure—that we are using the ex-
tent of the statutes provided to this 
government and this President to 
make sure that people are safe and 
make sure people are tested in the mid-
dle of an ongoing epidemic. 
I am glad to be joined on the floor 
today by a number of my colleagues to 
talk about the need to pass this legisla-
tion. We are going to offer a unanimous 
consent request. Senator BALDWIN will 
do that. I have been very pleased to be 
a partner with her in developing this 
legislation 
to 
require 
the 
operationalization of the DPA, but be-
fore she speaks, let me turn it over to 
my colleague and our caucus’s leader 
on issues of healthcare, Senator STABE-
NOW. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. COT-
TON). The Senator from Michigan. 
Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, first, 
it is wonderful to be here with my 
great friends from Connecticut, Wis-
consin, and Ohio. This is such an im-
portant discussion we are having today 
and such an important bill that needs 
to be passed. 
Let me start again by underscoring 
something that Senator MURPHY said, 
because despite what happened in the 
beginning as it relates to China and 
certainly over the years, I have not 
been shy to address concerns related to 
stealing 
our 
intellectual 
property 
rights or other issues related to China. 
The reality is, despite whatever the 
smokescreens are about China, you 
can’t say that they are the reason that 
with 4 percent of the population, we 
have 25 percent of the cases of COVID– 
19 and 25 percent of the deaths in the 
world. There is much more to it, and, 
unfortunately, it lands right in this 
country with the lack of national lead-
ership that has been completely AWOL 
when it comes to the kind of national 
strategy we need to get our people the 
equipment, the support they need, the 
testing they need, and to have a strat-
egy to safely reopen the economy and 
our schools while, at the same time, 
putting the health and safety and lives 
of Americans first by addressing the 
pandemic. 
So I rise today to urge the Senate to 
take up and immediately pass the Med-
ical Supply Transparency and Delivery 
Act. I want to thank Senators BALD-
WIN, MURPHY, and BROWN
for intro-
ducing this important legislation. I am 
very proud to be an original cosponsor 
of this bill. 
As all of you know, throughout his-
tory—and I love history—perhaps no 
State was as crucial to our Nation’s 
victory in World War II as was Michi-
gan. My colleagues may debate that, 
but I have the mic, so I will talk about 
Michigan. 
The truth is that more than half of 
Michigan men and women proudly 
served in uniform, including my own 
dad. Back home, the people of our 
State were hard at work producing the 
bombers, the tanks, the trucks, the 
helmets, and the guns needed to win 
the war. In fact, Michigan was called at 
that time ‘‘the arsenal of democracy.’’ 
We make things, and during World War 
II, we were making the things that 
were needed to win the war—the arse-
nal of democracy. Both at home and 
abroad, victory in many ways depended 
on the people of my State. 
For the past 6 months, our Nation 
has been fighting a different kind of 
war, a raging health pandemic, taking 
over 141,000 American lives so far. Un-
fortunately, this time our national 
generals appear to be missing in ac-
tion. How is it possible that 6 months 
after the first case of COVID–19 on Jan-
uary 20, our healthcare workers still 
are struggling to get the personal pro-
tective gear they need to treat patients 
while keeping themselves safe? How 
can that be? 
How is it possible that 6 months after 
the first case of COVID–19 was detected 
in the United States, people are still 
struggling to get tested? Well, I will 
tell you how. It is because of the com-
plete lack of Federal leadership coming 
from this White House that we have 
seen, since day one, in this crisis. 
None of us want it to be this way. We 
all live here. Our families are here. We 
are desperately concerned about our 
families, our friends, and people in our 
States. We want this White House to be 
successful in fighting the pandemic. We 
all need to be successful in fighting 
this pandemic. 
But the reality is that the adminis-
tration could have immediately used 
the Defense Production Act to ensure 
that we have quality protective equip-
ment and testing supplies in the right 
place at the right time. It could have 
happened immediately. Instead, we 
have the administration providing ex-
ample after example of telling the Gov-
ernors: OK, you do it. We don’t want to 
do it. You do it. We will be right behind 
you. 
Then Governors turn around, and no-
body is there. 
They don’t want to support the Gov-
ernors and local communities now that 
we were once required to step up. But 
you go ahead. Or they are putting to-
gether shady contracts—no-bid con-
tracts—one after the other. 
One I will mention to you is called 
Fillakit, which was a $10 million no-bid 
contract to produce testing supplies by 
somebody who already had had prob-
lems in the past and who was given a 
no-bid contract after setting up a new 
company. We heard this over and over. 
And ProPublica reported that the test-
ing tubes Fillakit produced were, in 
fact, repurposed miniature plastic soda 
bottles and described the packaging 
process as unmasked employees using 
‘‘snow shovels’’ and dumping them into 
plastic bins before squirting saline into 
them all in open air. Well, Michigan re-
ceived some of those so-called testing 
supplies, and needless to say, they were 
not useable.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S4383 
July 22, 2020 
Meanwhile, Governors, hospitals, and 
nursing homes have spent time, en-
ergy, and money bidding against one 
another and being pitted against one 
another for lifesaving PPE and testing 
supplies. This is no way to fight a pan-
demic. This is no way to fight a war, 
and, certainly, no way to win a war. 
In Michigan, after the CARES Act 
passed, going back to the State, work-
ing with our State Governor and her 
team and our delegation, I, literally, 
was in a situation of reaching out—be-
cause of my work in healthcare—to 
people in the medical supply business, 
and we got some of the first masks be-
cause I knew a guy who knew a guy 
who knew a guy in China. That was 
how we got the masks—no national 
supply chain. 
Masks were coming in. Fifty-cent 
masks were being bumped up to $5, $6, 
$7 apiece—no accountability, nobody 
worrying about the United States and 
whether we could get the best deal and 
whether our hospitals were able to get 
what they needed. Frankly, it was 
chaos—complete chaos. Again, that is 
no way to fight a pandemic, and it is 
certainly no way to fight a war. 
During World War II, Michigan didn’t 
decide to become the arsenal of democ-
racy on its own. The Federal Govern-
ment saw a need and called on Michi-
gan companies and workers to fill it, 
and we did. It is the same thing this 
administration should be doing right 
now, 
today—today—to 
produce 
the 
PPE and testing supplies we need to 
end this pandemic. Instead, doctors and 
nurses are wearing the same masks for 
a week or more. People are waiting 
more than 10 days for test results, and 
more than 141,000 Americans, so far, 
have died, including more than 6,100 in 
Michigan. 
It is time to pass this important bill. 
It is past time. It is time to put our 
great American companies to work 
producing the supplies we need. It is 
time to win this war. We have done big 
things before, and we can do it again. I 
join with my colleagues in urging that 
this bill be taken up immediately. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Ohio. 
Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I thank 
Senators MURPHY and STABENOW and 
Senator BALDWIN’s terrific leadership 
on this. I echo Senator MURPHY’s ear-
lier comments about China. 
I see on the other side of the aisle 
Senators and President Trump. It is 
campaign season. So it is time to bash 
China, even though they have been in 
the pockets of China. 
I was in the other body when cor-
porate interests came and lobbied the 
House of Representatives and lobbied 
the Senate asking for China to get all 
of these trade breaks and tax breaks so 
that American companies could shut 
down production in Milwaukee or in 
Cleveland and move overseas to China 
and get all kinds of tax breaks. And 
then my Republican colleagues were 
also pro-China because they wanted 
these American corporations and their 
contributors, starting with Senator 
MCCONNELL down the hall, to get all of 
these advantages for China. 
Now, if you are thinking about run-
ning for President of the United States 
in 2024 as a Republican, you bash 
China. If you are in a tough reelection 
right now for the Senate, you bash 
China. If you are a House Member and 
afraid of being defeated, you bash 
China. If you want to help the cause for 
Donald Trump, you bash China. It 
doesn’t matter that President Trump 
has been the best friend of China. It 
doesn’t matter the Republican leader-
ship has been in the pocket of Chinese 
Communist interests because of their 
support for American corporations. It 
is just good politics to bash China. So 
we know that, and Senator MURPHY 
touched on that. 
S. 4049 
Mr. President, I want to say a few 
words first about Agent Orange and 
thank Senator TESTER for his work on 
behalf of the tens of thousands of Viet-
nam vets who suffered because of expo-
sure to Agent Orange. 
We all know what the issue is. The 
National Academy of Sciences has rec-
ognized the four illnesses that are sug-
gestive or where there is sufficient evi-
dence associated with Agent Orange. 
For years, we have known that. The 
VA has added illnesses in categories to 
the list of presumptive medical condi-
tions associated with Agent Orange. 
They have resisted this. 
Time is running out for these vet-
erans. We did this to them. The Amer-
ican Government decided to spray 
Agent Orange. We knew it was harm-
ful. We definitely know it is harmful 
now. If you were exposed to poison 
while serving our country, you deserve 
the benefits you earned, period. 
For 3 years, in the Veterans’ Affairs 
Committee—I sat in the Veterans’ Af-
fairs Committee—I begged the Vet-
erans’ 
Administration 
to 
recognize 
that these three illnesses are caused by 
Agent Orange and they should get Vet-
erans’ 
Administration 
benefits. 
I 
begged the Veterans’ Administration, 
and no answers. I begged the President 
of the United States, and President 
Trump said he is a friend of veterans, 
but he couldn’t be bothered to add 
these three illnesses on the list. So 
these veterans, individually, have to 
get down on their knees—figuratively, 
if not literally—and beg the VA for 
benefits when it ought to be automatic. 
That is what Senator TESTER’s amend-
ment does today. It makes it auto-
matic. 
Instead, the White House said no and 
the Veterans’ Administration said no, 
but because of the work of Senator 
TESTER today, my colleagues are fi-
nally—it doesn’t happen often around 
here. My Republican colleagues actu-
ally stood up to the President of the 
United States and said: No, Mr. Presi-
dent, you are wrong on the VA about 
covering these illnesses for Vietnam 
vets. And, finally, this Congress did the 
right thing. I thank Senator TESTER 
for that work. 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST—S. 3627 
Mr. President, we know a lot of 
things. We know 144,000 Americans are 
dead. We have grown numb to these 
numbers. We can’t forget who they are. 
They are our friends, our sisters, our 
brothers, our parents, and our neigh-
bors. 
As has been said, we are 4 to 5 per-
cent of the world’s population. We have 
accounted for almost 30 percent of the 
deaths in the entire world. That is not 
because we don’t have skilled doctors. 
It is not because we don’t have smart 
scientists. It is not because we don’t 
work hard. It is because of leadership. 
We know this President and the ma-
jority leader down the hall, who does 
the bidding every single day of this 
President, had chance after chance to 
get ahead of this virus. President 
Trump failed and Senator MCCONNELL 
failed. Now they have stopped even pre-
tending to try. 
The President demands that schools 
reopen—no plan to protect teachers 
and students. He demands businesses 
open up—no plan to protect workers 
and consumers. The American people 
have done their part and made incred-
ible sacrifices. Essentially, they bought 
President Trump time in March, April, 
May, and June, and he wasted it. 
This spring, people stayed home. 
They worked hard to flatten the curve. 
Members of both parties—both par-
ties—begged him to use the Defense 
Production Act to scale up the produc-
tion of medical supplies, including 
testing supplies, and coordinate their 
deployment. All the way back in 
March, we knew we faced shortfalls in 
N95 masks, gowns, and the materials 
we needed, most importantly, for test 
production, like cotton swabs. I imme-
diately convened Ohio manufacturers 
back in March. I know Senator BALD-
WIN did the same thing in her State. I 
asked them what support they needed. 
I released a plan and sent a letter to 
the White House outlining Executive 
actions the President could take imme-
diately. This was March. Since then— 
April, May, June, July—and essentially 
nothing happened. The Federal Govern-
ment can acquire the resources our 
country needs and send them when 
they are needed most. 
Senator CRAPO, a Republican from 
Idaho, and I worked together to include 
provisions in the CARES Act ensuring 
the President has the ability to use 
DPA authority he already has without 
delay. We worked with our colleagues 
in the Appropriations Committee to in-
clude $1 billion in new DPA funding. 
Yet hundreds of millions of dollars just 
sit around waiting to be used. 
Our States and our healthcare work-
ers continue to face supply shortages. 
What exactly is the President waiting 
for? Imagine if he had used that DPA 
money and DPA authority in the 
spring and said we need to be producing 
a million tests a week by the end of 
summer, or imagine if we said our goal

S4384 
July 22, 2020 
is to be ready to open schools in the 
fall and I am calling on American busi-
nesses and American workers to manu-
facture the tests we need to do it? 
Look around the world. Other coun-
tries figured this out. We are being left 
behind. It is time for us to step up. If 
the President will not lead, we must. If 
the President will not use DPA on its 
own, Congress must use its authority 
to force him to. 
That is why it is so disappointing to 
see my Republican colleagues objecting 
to Senator BALDWIN’s bill. But, of 
course, they are objecting because they 
are doing the bidding of President 
Trump, and they want to blame China 
for everything, instead of take any re-
sponsibility themselves. But objecting 
to Senator BALDWIN’s bill, which would 
force the President to actually do his 
job and coordinate a national response 
to a national crisis—that is the answer. 
The American people should not have 
to fend for themselves again and again 
and again in the middle of a pandemic. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Wisconsin. 
Ms. BALDWIN. Mr. President, Presi-
dent Trump’s response to this pan-
demic has been a failure of leadership. 
So we are here today to provide leader-
ship in the Senate to do what the 
Trump administration has failed to do. 
In April, with my good friend Sen-
ator MURPHY
from Connecticut, the 
two of us introduced legislation called 
the Medical Supply Transparency and 
Delivery Act. That act would force 
President Trump to take action and 
scale up American production of things 
like test kits, swabs, reagents, personal 
protective equipment, and the medical 
equipment needed at the local level to 
address the ongoing COVID–19 pan-
demic in our country. 
Three months later, States still do 
not have the supplies they need. Now 
more than 3.8 million Americans have 
been infected with the coronavirus, 
and, tragically, over 141,000 people have 
died in our country. For 3 months, our 
legislation has been in the majority 
leader’s legislative graveyard. 
Since this public health crisis start-
ed, the Trump administration has had 
no national testing plan, and they have 
never had a plan to provide States with 
the testing supplies they need to com-
bat this pandemic. As a matter of fact, 
last month, the President said we need-
ed to slow down testing, and, this 
weekend, as President Trump once 
again said the coronavirus would dis-
appear, there were reports that the 
White House is trying to block Federal 
funding for States to conduct testing 
and contact tracing. 
President Trump has not only aban-
doned each and every one of our States, 
he has also turned his back on front-
line healthcare workers, who continue 
to face shortages of personal protective 
equipment, including gloves, gowns, 
face shields, and masks. 
The Trump administration has cre-
ated absolute chaos in the medical sup-
ply chain, leaving healthcare workers 
at hospitals and long-term care facili-
ties at the forefront of this crisis to 
fend for themselves, rationing the 
scarce personal protective equipment 
that has been provided to them. In 
fact, just a couple of weeks ago, Vice 
President MIKE PENCE, who was put in 
charge of our pandemic response, said 
the administration will be issuing guid-
ance encouraging healthcare workers 
to reuse personal protective equip-
ment. This is the same Vice President 
who declared that the United States 
would ‘‘have this coronavirus pandemic 
behind us’’ by Memorial Day weekend. 
He was tragically wrong, and this 
White House continues to play catchup 
on a pandemic and a virus that is 
spreading faster than ever. 
The person whom President Trump 
put in charge of our medical supply 
chain 
was 
his 
son-in-law, 
Jared 
Kushner. Jared Kushner predicted in 
April that by June we would be back to 
normal and that in July we would be 
‘‘rocking again.’’ It is July. It is July, 
and this is where we are. 
Last Thursday, America had its high-
est number of new coronavirus cases in 
1 day. And in my home State of Wis-
consin, we had our highest case count 
ever 
yesterday—yesterday—and 
we 
have many hospitals across my State 
with less than a week’s supply of face 
shields, goggles, gowns, paper medical 
masks, and N95 masks. 
This public health crisis has not dis-
appeared. We are not back to normal, 
and we are not ‘‘rocking again.’’ 
The fact is, President Trump has 
failed to lead, and this White House has 
taken us in a wrong direction in our 
fight 
against 
this 
pandemic. 
New 
coronavirus cases are rising in the 
States that we work for, which means 
we need more testing supplies, more 
testing, and more personal protective 
equipment for our workers. 
The question this Senate needs to an-
swer is whether we are going to let this 
President continue to take our country 
in the wrong direction, or are we going 
to lead and do what we all know needs 
to be done? 
Not one of my Senate colleagues can 
make an honest case that their State 
has everything it needs to fight this 
pandemic. 
In Wisconsin, we have been short-
changed by this administration. They 
have failed to provide adequate sup-
plies for our State’s clinical and pri-
vate labs, paralyzing our ability to ex-
pand testing to the levels we need. In 
some cases, what we have received 
from the Trump administration were 
unsuitable and unusable testing sup-
plies—foam applicators that cannot be 
used for swabs and saline tubes that 
were too short to transport swabs used 
in the majority of COVID–19 tests. 
In addition, the majority of labs con-
ducting COVID–19 tests in Wisconsin 
are clinical or private labs. These labs 
cannot access resources from the ad-
ministration and are essentially being 
told to ‘‘figure it out.’’ Over 80 Wis-
consin labs that are currently per-
forming tests do not have access to a 
consistent supply of reagent. 
We are not alone. States across the 
country have been abandoned by the 
Trump administration. They have been 
forced to go this alone, while President 
Trump has tried to pass off responsi-
bility for his own failures. 
Every single one of us knows that our 
States need more resources and sup-
plies so we can ramp up testing, iden-
tify those who are infected, isolate 
positive cases, and safely trace all con-
tacts so that the spread of this virus 
can finally be contained. We all know 
that President Trump’s broken supply 
chain has been a failure, and my legis-
lation with Senator MURPHY, supported 
by 46 Democrats, will help fix it. 
In order to put people back to work 
and 
safely 
reopen 
businesses 
and 
schools, we need both a national test-
ing plan and the supplies to implement 
it. This is true in Wisconsin and every 
other State in our Nation. 
Our legislation will help respond to 
this public health crisis and prepare for 
the future by mobilizing a Federal re-
sponse to increase our national produc-
tion of the testing and medical supplies 
we need at the State and local level. 
Specifically, the bill will provide crit-
ical oversight of the distribution of 
medical supplies and put an expert in 
charge to oversee COVID–19 equipment 
production and delivery so we know we 
are putting science and facts over poli-
tics and private distributor profits 
when it comes to responding to this 
pandemic. 
Finally, our legislation unlocks the 
full authority and power of the Defense 
Production Act so that we can produce 
and deliver tests, testing supplies, per-
sonal protective equipment, and med-
ical equipment that we need to take on 
this pandemic, treat patients, protect 
workers, open businesses and schools, 
and save lives. 
My friends on the other side of the 
aisle have a choice: They can continue 
to ignore President Trump’s failure to 
respond to this public health crisis, 
knowing full well that until we con-
front it in the bold and effective way 
that we should, we will not solve our 
economic crisis, or they can choose to 
liberate themselves from this failure 
and support a solution that will serve 
the people who sent us here to work for 
them. 
If my colleagues on the other side of 
the aisle believe, as this Vice President 
does, that this pandemic is behind us, 
then object. If my colleagues on the 
other side of the aisle believe, as Jared 
Kushner does, that we are rocking 
again in July, then object. If my col-
leagues on the other side of the aisle 
believe, as President Trump does, that 
the coronavirus will just magically dis-
appear, well, then, object. 
If you oppose the failures of this 
President and this administration in 
responding to the COVID–19 pandemic, 
then I ask for your vote to pass the 
Medical Supply Transparency and De-
livery Act today.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S4385 
July 22, 2020 
So I ask unanimous consent that the 
Homeland Security and Governmental 
Affairs Committee be discharged and 
the Senate proceed to the immediate 
consideration of S. 3627, the Medical 
Supply Transparency and Delivery Act. 
I further ask that the bill be considered 
read a third time and passed and that 
the motion to reconsider be considered 
made and laid upon the table. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Wisconsin. 
Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, reserv-
ing the right to object, let me say first 
that I appreciate my colleague from 
Wisconsin’s work on this issue. It is an 
important issue. It is one that our 
committee has been working diligently 
on. 
Since the beginning of the COVID 
crisis, we have held five hearings and a 
roundtable on exactly this issue—ex-
ploring and doing oversight on the na-
tional stockpile and its supply chain 
vulnerability. Just today, we marked 
up five pieces of legislation very simi-
lar to what my colleague from Wis-
consin is introducing here and trying 
to pass by unanimous consent. The five 
pieces are the Federal Emergency Pan-
demic 
Response 
Act, 
Securing 
Healthcare Response and Equipment 
Act, National Response Framework 
Improvement Act, National Infrastruc-
ture Simulation and Analysis Center 
Pandemic Modeling Act, and finally— 
this one closest to my colleague’s bill— 
the PPE Supply Chain Transparency 
Act, which is actually the piece of leg-
islation we have had the most discus-
sion on—two amendments, including a 
second-degree 
amendment 
to 
one 
amendment—before passing it unani-
mously. So our committee has done a 
lot of work. 
My concern about what my colleague 
is doing here—trying to pass this by 
unanimous consent—is by and large by-
passing the committee process. It is 
true her staff reached out to my staff a 
couple of weeks ago. We asked, have 
you vetted it through the Department? 
Apparently, she has begun that proc-
ess, but this piece of legislation has not 
been properly vetted. It has not gone 
through the proper and full committee 
process. 
Again, without expressing an opinion 
on a piece of legislation but also ac-
knowledging the fact that our com-
mittee has done a lot of work—passed 
five pieces of legislation on a non-
partisan basis today because we are 
concerned about this as well—I have to 
object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard. 
Ms. BALDWIN. Mr. President. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Wisconsin. 
Ms. BALDWIN. I am, of course, very 
disappointed that we cannot move this 
forward. 
I want to respond to a couple of the 
comments made by my colleagues from 
the State of Wisconsin, the chairman 
of the Homeland Security and Govern-
mental Affairs Committee. 
It is July. It is July, and cases are 
rising. Action was not taken in Feb-
ruary, March, April, May, June, or so 
far in this month of July. We had more 
than fair warning that we had short-
ages of masks and gloves and gowns 
and face shields and testing swabs and 
testing media and reagents, and yet it 
is July. 
As I said earlier, yesterday Wisconsin 
announced the most cases positive for 
coronavirus in a single day that we 
have seen since the pandemic began. 
As we strive to reopen our economy, 
the President exhorts all schools to 
hold 5-day-a-week, in-person classes. 
We know that the demand for testing 
and the demand for masks will only in-
crease exponentially—the need to keep 
workers safe as they return to work 
and the need to keep customers safe as 
they enter and engage in commerce. To 
say that this needed to happen back in 
February is an understatement. 
I am pleased that my colleague has 
held hearings, but this bill was filed in 
April when it became apparent that the 
President was not going to act. This 
bill has been available for committee 
review since April. 
The House passed many elements of 
the Medical Supply Transparency and 
Delivery Act in their Heroes Act, 
which they passed 2 months ago. I just 
ask, where would we be today had this 
been put into law? 
There has been time to review. There 
has been time to study. But it is past 
time to pass the Medical Supply Trans-
parency and Delivery Act. I hope we 
can create another opportunity for the 
Senate to act on this in the days to 
come because it is so overdue. 
I want to again thank my colleagues 
who joined me on the floor this after-
noon—my 
coauthor, 
Senator 
CHRIS 
MURPHY of Connecticut; my colleague 
from Michigan, DEBBIE STABENOW; and 
my 
colleague 
from 
Ohio, 
Senator 
SHERROD BROWN; and the 45 other Mem-
bers of the U.S. Senate who have joined 
me in sponsoring this bill. 
I yield the floor. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
Democratic leader. 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I want 
to thank my colleagues, Senators 
BALDWIN and MURPHY, for their urgent 
words on this most important issue. I 
am proud to join them as we seek pas-
sage to pass legislation to finally re-
quire the President to invoke the full 
authority of the DPA, the Defense Pro-
duction Act, so that the Federal Gov-
ernment can more speedily get testing 
supplies and PPE to the parts of our 
country struggling under the weight of 
the pandemic. 
Make no mistake, medical profes-
sionals and frontline workers fighting 
this virus still—still—do not have the 
protective equipment and the testing 
supplies they need because the Trump 
administration failed to fully invoke 
the DPA earlier this year. This is a cri-
sis of President Trump’s making. 
As we speak, COVID–19 continues to 
surge across the country. As cases keep 
growing, our testing supplies and our 
PPE, already in short supply, are 
reaching critical levels. From Seattle 
to Miami, people are waiting in line for 
hours to get tested, and their results 
might take days, if not more, to come 
back. In many places we are missing 
basic supplies—swabs, gloves. In cer-
tain hospitals it has been reported doc-
tors and nurses are being told to reuse 
their N95 masks as many as 15—15— 
times. 
It has been 6 months since we have 
been fighting this virus. How is this 
still happening? The problem should 
have been solved months ago, but the 
President has been derelict in his duty. 
His administration has been a total 
failure when it comes to testing and 
PPE. 
Instead of fully invoking the DPA 
and ramping up the production of crit-
ical supplies early on, President Trump 
has left doctors, nurses, and medical 
staff fighting this disease with one 
hand tied behind their back. He has 
failed to keep us and those working on 
the frontline safe. 
This bill, however, would finally—fi-
nally—force the President to do what 
he should have done ages ago. We have 
been talking about the DPA since way 
back in April. I called the President in 
April, got him on the phone, urged him 
to invoke it. He told me he would and 
then contradicted himself a few hours 
later. How typical, but how dev-
astating for the American people. Then 
he quickly lost interest—again, typical 
of this President, whose attention span 
is much too short for the big fight that 
we have with COVID. 
So what we say is the President’s ap-
proach to the pandemic was—typically 
here—no followthrough, no strategy, 
no comprehension of the problem. The 
President’s mind-boggling refusal to 
invoke the DPA shouldn’t be piled on 
top of the challenges our medical 
workers and citizens already face. 
I am sorry we didn’t pass this legisla-
tion. I hope we can do it soon. 
I yield the floor.

ator from South Dakota. 
REMEMBERING JOHN LEWIS 
Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, before I 
begin, I would like to take a moment 
to honor Congressman John Lewis, who 
died on Friday. A leader of the civil 
rights movement, he was one of the 13 
original Freedom Riders and an orga-
nizer of the 1963 March on Washington. 
He was a man of conscience, convic-
tion, and supreme courage. 
‘‘When you see something that is not 
right, not fair, not just, you have to 
speak up. You have to do something,’’ 
he would say. 
John Lewis did something. Con-
fronted by the great sin of segregation, 
John Lewis put himself front and cen-
ter in the fight. He organized sit-ins. 
He led demonstrations. He marched for

freedom. And he paid for his convic-
tions with his blood. A man who es-
poused nonviolence, he suffered incred-
ible brutality at the hands of both po-
lice officers and civilian mobs. He was 
attacked and beaten an untold number 
of times. 
During a march in Selma, AL—on a 
day that lives in infamy—a police offi-
cer fractured John Lewis’s skull, leav-
ing him with a scar that he carried to 
the end of his life. Yet John Lewis was 
unbowed. No matter how many times 
he was attacked or what he suffered, he 
got up again and rejoined the fight. 
His death is a great loss, but John 
Lewis will live on in the annals of 
American heroes. May we all have his 
courage in fighting for the right. 
CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. President, so far, Congress has 
provided $2.4 trillion to fight the 
coronavirus. Over the past couple of 
months here in the Senate, we have 
been closely tracking the implementa-
tion of this money and working with 
the administration on disbursement. 
In June alone, we held 30 hearings in 
the Senate on COVID-related issues. 
All of this has helped us identify the 
priorities that need to shape our next 
bill, which we are hoping to pass in the 
next couple of weeks. Those priorities 
are kids, jobs, and healthcare. 
First, kids: Getting kids back in 
school safely needs to be a priority. 
Being able to attend school in person is 
important for students’ academic de-
velopment and for their social and 
emotional well-being. 
The American Academy of Pediatrics 
has stated: ‘‘All policy considerations 
for the coming school year should start 
with a goal of having students phys-
ically present in school.’’ 
Now, not every school may be able to 
fully reopen this fall, but we need to 
make sure that those schools that can 
reopen have the resources they need to 
reopen safely. That is why the legisla-
tion the Republicans are drafting here 
in the Senate would provide more than 
$100 billion to help schools ensure they 
have what they need to safely welcome 
students back to class. 
While our first priority in getting 
kids back to school is ensuring their 
academic and social well-being, getting 
students back in school is also impor-
tant for families’ economic health. 
There are a lot of parents in this coun-
try who can’t afford to have one parent 
stay home to homeschool. We need to 
ensure that those parents have access 
to schools and childcare wherever pos-
sible so that they can keep or return to 
their jobs. 
Enabling Americans to return to 
work is key to our economic recovery. 
Currently, there are more than 17 mil-
lion unemployed Americans. While this 
is a significant improvement from 
where we were 2 months ago, that num-
ber is still much too high, and we have 
to do everything we can to get these 
Americans back on the job and receiv-
ing a regular paycheck. 
That is why the legislation we are 
drafting will provide incentives for 
businesses to hire and to retain work-
ers. It will provide a refundable tax 
credit for Main Street businesses for 
the protective equipment and cleaning 
supplies that they need to keep their 
employees and customers safe and to 
encourage Americans to return to their 
businesses. It will provide another 
round of assistance to small businesses, 
with a focus on those that have been 
hit the hardest by the pandemic. 
We also expect to issue another 
round of direct payments to hard-work-
ing Americans to help them get back 
on their feet and to stimulate the econ-
omy. 
The third bucket of our coronavirus 
response is, of course, healthcare. We 
have to keep ensuring our healthcare 
professionals have the resources needed 
to treat patients, develop new treat-
ments, and to find a vaccine to tame 
this virus once and for all. 
The coronavirus legislation that we 
are drafting will address all three of 
those priorities. 
Our legislation will also include an-
other important priority that will pro-
tect jobs, schools, businesses, and 
healthcare workers, and that is liabil-
ity protections. No matter how many 
precautions 
schools 
and 
businesses 
take, there is no way for them to com-
pletely eliminate all risk of employees, 
students, or customers contracting the 
virus, but an army of trial lawyers is 
waiting to levy lawsuits against even 
the most careful schools and busi-
nesses. 
There is absolutely no question that 
schools and businesses should be liable 
for gross negligence or for intentional 
misconduct, but businesses and schools 
that are taking every reasonable pre-
caution to protect employees and stu-
dents and customers should not have to 
worry about facing lawsuits for virus 
transmission that they could not have 
prevented. 
Healthcare workers giving their all 
on the frontlines to treat coronavirus 
patients should not have to worry that 
their efforts will be rewarded with law-
suits. 
I would like to think that we can put 
a bipartisan bill together and get it to 
the President’s desk in the next couple 
of weeks. Republicans are ready and 
willing to work with Democrats to get 
this done. We will introduce our draft 
shortly and be ready to negotiate with 
Democrats to arrive at a final bill, the 
same process that we followed with the 
CARES Act, our largest coronavirus re-
lief bill to date. 
This will work only if Democrats are 
willing to come to the table and nego-
tiate a reasonable bill. My Democratic 
colleagues sometimes behave as if gov-
ernment money is drawn from a mag-
ical pot of gold that will never run out, 
but it is not. It is not. 
Every dollar of the coronavirus fund-
ing we provided so far has been bor-
rowed money, and every dollar we ap-
propriate in the phase 4 bill we are 
drafting will likely be borrowed money 
as well. 
It can be argued that it is money we 
need to borrow, but we need to remem-
ber that it is borrowed money and that 
the bill for that money will eventually 
come due. The more we drive up our 
debt, the greater the threat to the 
health of our economy, not to mention 
to the economic future of today’s 
younger workers. We have an obliga-
tion to them to limit our borrowing to 
what is absolutely necessary to fight 
the virus. 
The Democratic leader has come 
down to the floor the past couple of 
days and suggested that the Heroes 
Act—a $3 trillion coronavirus bill the 
House passed is—‘‘a good product to 
start with’’ when it comes to a phase 4 
coronavirus relief bill. 
That is ludicrous. The bill the Demo-
cratic leader is promoting—the bill he 
thinks is a good starting point for 
coronavirus legislation—is a bill that 
mentions 
cannabis—cannabis 
more 
often 
than 
it 
mentions 
the 
word 
‘‘jobs.’’ 
Let me just repeat that. The bill the 
Democratic leader thinks is a good 
starting point for coronavirus relief 
legislation mentions the word ‘‘can-
nabis’’ more often than it mentions the 
word ‘‘job.’’ 
While the Democratic leader is cer-
tainly welcome to disagree with me, I 
don’t think diversity studies in the 
cannabis industry have a major role to 
play in defeating this virus or getting 
Americans back to work, nor does fed-
eralizing election law—another pri-
ority the Democrats included in their 
bill. 
Despite its $3 trillion pricetag, the 
bill the Democratic leader is endorsing 
fails to meet one of the most basic re-
quirements of any coronavirus relief 
bill, and that is providing a meaningful 
plan for getting Americans back to 
work. It is disappointing to hear the 
Democratic leader promoting such an 
unserious piece of legislation at a time 
that we should be devoting all of our 
efforts to getting a bipartisan bill to 
the President. 
I hope my other Democratic col-
leagues in the Senate are ready to look 
beyond partisan wish lists and focus on 
negotiating a relief package that ad-
dresses the real priorities we are fac-
ing: helping kids and parents, getting 
Americans back to work, and providing 
the healthcare resources needed to 
fight this virus. 
Republicans are ready to come to the 
table, and I urge Democrats to join us. 
I yield the floor.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S4387 
July 22, 2020 
today—and many of them are following 
this carefully and closely—I wanted to 
make sure we returned to it today to 
at least consider one aspect of the de-
bate. 
Yesterday, when I made a unanimous 
consent request, Senator LEE said he 
had not had time to look at my pro-
posal. That is why I waited until today 
to come back, so that he would have 
that opportunity. 
Yesterday, I came to the floor to 
speak about the plight of immigrant 
workers who are suffering because of a 
serious problem in our immigration 
system known as the green card back-
log. Many of these immigrants are es-
sential workers who are helping to lead 
the fight against COVID–19, but the 
green card backlog puts them and their 
families at risk of losing their immi-
gration status and being subject to de-
portation. 
Under the current law, there are 
clearly not enough immigrant visas— 
also known as green cards—available 
each year. The numbers that we have 
established in 1990 are still applicable 
today, though our national economy 
has doubled since then. We are still 
talking about 140,000 employment visas 
each year. 
These so-called green cards have re-
sulted in many people waiting for long 
periods of times—literally for years— 
for the opportunity to become legal 
permanent residents and securing one 
of the green cards. While they are wait-
ing, their families are at risk. 
These backlogs are particularly dif-
ficult on children because as they wait, 
the children, of course, advance in age, 
and when they reach age 21, they are 
subject to deportation. I have met with 
these families, and I have talked with 
them. It is a heartbreaking situation. 
The 
unanimous 
consent 
request, 
which I will make today, addresses the 
plight of those children directly. Sen-
ator LEE objected to it yesterday. He 
said he had not had a chance to look at 
it. I hope he will reconsider when I 
make the same request today. 
These children who face, what we 
call, aging out at age 21 would be pro-
tected by this unanimous consent re-
quest, which I am making. In addition 
to the green card backlog, it is clear 
there is a solution to this issue, which 
I am afraid we are not going to be able 
to achieve. It is to increase the number 
of green cards available each year in 
this country. 
These immigrant workers who are 
seeking green cards are already in the 
United States working legally. This is 
not a question of increasing the num-
ber of green cards, of bringing in new 
immigrants to compete with American 
workers. These workers are already 
here. It is about whether immigrant 
workers will continue to be able to 
work on temporary visas, where they 
have to depend on their employer for 
their immigration status and their fu-
ture is uncertain. 
I introduced legislation known as the 
RELIEF Act. My cosponsors are Sen-
ator PATRICK LEAHY of Vermont and 
Senator MAZIE HIRONO of Hawaii. The 
RELIEF Act would increase the num-
ber of green cards to clear the backlog 
for all immigrants waiting in line for 
green cards within 5 years—eliminate 
the backlog for green cards within 5 
years. 
This RELIEF Act would keep immi-
grant families together by treating 
children and spouses of green card 
holders as immediate relatives, just as 
the children and spouses of citizens 
are, so they don’t count against the 
green card caps. The RELIEF Act 
would protect the aging-out children 
who qualify for a green card based on 
parents’ immigrant petition. 
The RELIEF Act that I am describ-
ing is not novel or controversial; it is 
based on a provision of the 2013 com-
prehensive immigration reform bill, 
which I helped to write with the so- 
called Gang of 8. That included Senator 
McCain, 
Senator 
GRAHAM, 
Senator 
Flake, as well as Senator RUBIO on the 
Republican side; myself, Senator SCHU-
MER, Senator MENENDEZ, and Senator 
BENNET on the Democratic side. We 
worked hard and passed that measure 
through the Senate Judiciary Com-
mittee and on the floor by a vote of 68 
to 32. 
What I am proposing is something I 
have proposed in the past, crafted, 
passed, and offered to the House of 
Representatives to help start to solve 
the immigration crisis, which we cur-
rently have in this country. Unfortu-
nately, the Republicans, who con-
trolled the House of Representatives 
when this measure came before them 
several years ago, refused to even take 
up this measure and debate it. 
If they had, we wouldn’t be here 
today. The green card backlog would 
not exist based on the provision which 
I offered with others in the comprehensive 
immigration 
reform 
bill. 
Unfortunately, 
some of the Republicans on the other side of 
the aisle are still unwilling to increase any 
number of immigrant visas. They want to 
keep the immigrant workers on a temporary 
basis, where they and their family are at 
risk of losing their immigration status and 
being deported. 
The senior Senator from Utah, Mr. 
LEE, has introduced S. 386, known as 
the Fairness for High-Skilled Immi-
grants Act, to address the green card 
backlog. I have a basic concern with 
that bill. It includes no additional 
green cards. Without any additional 
green cards, S. 386 will not reduce the 
green card backlog. Without additional 
green cards, S. 386 will not reduce the 
green card backlog. 
Don’t take it from me. There are 
those who will disagree and say: Oh, 
DURBIN is wrong. He is just mistaken in 
saying that. 
Please go to the nonpartisan Con-
gressional Research Service. Here is 
what they said about S. 386, Senator 
LEE’s legislation. ‘‘S. 386 would not re-
duce future backlogs compared to cur-
rent law.’’ 
Despite my concerns about Senator 
LEE’s bill, I agreed to sit down and 
work in good faith with him to resolve 
our differences. Last December, we 
reached an agreement—I believed we 
did—on an amendment to the bill. The 
amendment doesn’t address the core 
problem because it doesn’t increase the 
number of green cards. As a result, it 
would not reduce the green card back-
log, but there was an improvement in 
the amendment which we put together. 
I talked about it yesterday. 
Let me highlight two key provisions 
of our agreement. We protected the 
families who are stuck in this backlog 
waiting for a green card. Immigrant 
workers and immediate family mem-
bers would be allowed to ‘‘early file’’ 
for their green cards. That was a pro-
posal that came to me from Senator 
LEE, and I thought it was reasonable. 
These individuals would not receive 
their green cards early, but they would 
be able, while waiting, to switch jobs 
and travel without losing immigration 
status. I think that is reasonable. 
Early filing adds a critical protection 
that wasn’t in S. 386. 
Listen carefully. Our agreement pre-
vents the children of immigrant work-
ers from aging out of green card eligi-
bility so they will not face deportation 
while they are waiting for a green card. 
Our agreement also would crack 
down on the abuse of H–1B temporary 
work visas. Really, I think this is at 
the heart of the problems we are run-
ning into. There are corporate entities 
in India, which have extraordinary 
power over the securing of these H–1B 
visas. 
The amendment we put together 
would allow legitimate use of H–1B 
visas, but here is what it would say. It 
would prohibit a company from hiring 
additional H–1B workers in the future 
if the company’s workforce is more 
than 50 employees and more than 50 
percent of those are temporary work-
ers. 
The 50–50 rule is from a bipartisan H– 
1B reform bill that I authored with 
Senator GRASSLEY. This provision was 
included in the 2013 comprehensive im-
migration reform bill. 
Senator LEE has said publicly: This is 
a commonsense reform to root out 
abuse. I think he is right. I know these 
companies despise this provision, and I 
think it is one of the reasons we find 
ourselves with no common ground 
today. If this is included, they don’t 
want anything to pass, and they are 
doing their best to stop it. 
The reality is that the top recipients 
of H–1B visas today are outsourcing 
companies that use loopholes in the 
law to exploit immigrant workers and 
offshore American jobs. In the most re-
cent year for which data is available, 8 
of the top 10 recipients of new H–1B 
visas were outsourcing companies. 
Unfortunately, 
yesterday, 
Senator 
LEE objected to this proposal, which we 
had put together. Instead, he offered a 
revised version that included changes 
that were requested by the Trump ad-
ministration. Let me explain Senator 
LEE’s changes because I think they are 
basic, and I believe they are a problem.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S4388 
July 22, 2020 
First, he wants to remove a provision 
from our original agreement, known as 
the hold harmless clause. What it says 
is very simple. It assures immigrants 
already waiting in line for green cards 
that there is nothing we will do that 
will, in any way, injure or delay their 
pursuit of a green card; they can’t fall 
further behind in line. We hold them 
harmless from any change we make. 
Why wouldn’t we? Some of these people 
have waited for years. The hold harm-
less provision basically says we are 
going to protect wherever you stand in 
line. 
The second thing that Senator LEE 
wants to do is to delay for 3 years the 
effective date of the 50–50 rule to crack 
down on outsourcing companies. I 
don’t know why we want to wait 3 
years to do that. We don’t have to. We 
shouldn’t. Why on Earth would we give 
these companies that are outsourcing 
American jobs and exploiting immi-
grant workers a free pass for an addi-
tional 3 years? 
Third, Senator LEE wanted to delay 
for years early filing for people who are 
stuck in the green card backlog. The 
object behind the early filing, and the 
reason why it is so appealing to me, 
was that it would protect the individ-
uals applying as well as their families 
from the start, and now the Senator 
suggested that we delay this. That just 
means that many children will age out 
during that 1-to-3-year period of time 
and be subject to deportation. We 
shouldn’t do that to these children and 
these families. 
Yesterday, I made a simple proposal 
to Senator LEE, which he hadn’t seen 
personally, and that is why we had to 
come back today. While we continue to 
debate the best way to fix the green 
card backlog, let’s make sure no chil-
dren 
of 
the 
affected 
families 
are 
harmed or deported. It is just that sim-
ple. 
I offered a new bill—very simply stat-
ed—the Protect Children of Immi-
grants Workers Act. This brief, three- 
page bill would ensure that children do 
not age out while waiting for a green 
card. 
Imagine if you brought your family 
to the United States, worked on an H– 
1B visa, applied for a green card to stay 
in this country, and your children are 
waiting with you for the green card. 
You are paying for them to go to col-
lege because they don’t qualify as 
American citizens for any type of Fed-
eral financial aid. You are making 
great sacrifices for them. Then the day 
comes when they reach the age of 21 
and they can be deported and the fam-
ily divided. Why would we want to let 
that happen? 
This three-page bill, the Protect 
Children of Immigrant Workers Act, 
protects those children. It would not 
increase the number of green cards. It 
would not provide any special benefits. 
It would simply allow children of im-
migrant workers to keep their place in 
line for a green card and be protected 
from deportation until they can get 
that card. 
Yesterday, Senator LEE said he had 
not had a chance to review it, so I 
wanted to return to the floor today. I 
believe this is timely and important, 
and now he has had a chance to look at 
it. Senator LEE’s original bill does not 
offer any protection for those children, 
which I think is a major humanitarian 
problem caused by the green card back-
log. 
The early-filing provision in my 
agreement with Senator LEE will im-
mediately protect the kids in the back-
log under the age of 21. However, if 
early-filing is delayed, Senator LEE 
now proposes those kids would age out 
and lose their green card eligibility. 
I have met many of these young peo-
ple. It breaks my heart to hear their 
stories, that they may be reaching a 
point where they have aged out and 
could be deported. That is why I want 
to offer this specific single provision. 
There is no reason these children 
should be punished for a broken immi-
gration system. It is beyond their con-
trol, but it is not beyond our control to 
help them. 
I now am going to ask unanimous 
consent for the Protect Children of Im-
migrant Workers Act. 
Madam President, I ask unanimous 
consent that the Judiciary Committee 
be discharged of S. 4243, the Protect 
Children of Immigrant Workers Act, 
and the Senate proceed to its imme-
diate consideration; further, that the 
bill be considered read a third time and 
passed and the motion to reconsider be 
considered made and laid upon the 
table with no intervening action or de-
bate. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
The Senator from Utah. 
Mr. LEE. Reserving the right to ob-
ject, for well over 8 months, my friend 
and distinguished colleague, the senior 
Senator from Illinois, has been pub-
licly blocking legislation protecting 
the children of immigrant workers. 
Now there is something called the Pro-
tect Children of Immigrant Workers 
Act. He comes to the floor asking that 
we pass this bill by unanimous con-
sent—a bill that, as he notes, was in-
troduced just yesterday. Well, we must 
pass this right now, he says, because 
these children shouldn’t have to suffer 
1 more hour. With all due respect, they 
could have had relief months ago. They 
can still have relief today. 
I have taken the time since yester-
day to review Senator DURBIN’s legisla-
tion, and I cannot support it. This leg-
islation allows the children of H–1B 
workers to remain in the country for 
the 20 to 30 years that their parents 
have to wait in the green card back-
log—the same green card backlog the 
Senator is now decrying. 
When their parents die, children of 
immigrant workers will not be imme-
diately deported. But this prolonging 
of dependent status is helpful only if 
the parent lives and works in this 
country until his or her green card ap-
plication is actually adjudicated. It 
does nothing for the child of an immi-
grant whose dead parent’s green card 
application is ultimately denied be-
cause his or her job is no longer avail-
able—nothing. 
To be honest, the 20 to 30 years is a 
short wait for most of the Indian na-
tionals currently stuck in this awful, 
hellish green card backlog. In fact, it is 
a drop in the bucket. In 2020, the wait 
for an EB2 green card is not, in fact, 20 
to 30 years for an Indian national. 
What is it, then? Is it 30? Is it 40, 50, 60? 
No, it is much longer than that. It is 
195 years. This means that someone 
from India entering the backlog today 
would have to wait 195 years to receive 
an EB3 green card. Even if we give 
their children this limbo status, none 
of them will have a prayer of becoming 
a U.S. citizen. 
To put this in perspective, 195 years 
ago, John Quincy Adams had recently 
been inaugurated as President of the 
United States. 
The legislation purports to allow 
aging-out children to move to a stu-
dent visa status, but it also fails to ac-
complish even this. Student visas re-
quire the applicant to have residency 
in a foreign country, which, obviously, 
these children do not have. 
Perhaps these are merely drafting er-
rors, but as such, they underscore my 
concerns about passing slapdash legis-
lation just because it bears a title that 
compels us to believe that it will cor-
rect the most egregious problems and 
protect the most vulnerable popu-
lations. 
Even if we generously overlook these 
‘‘drafting errors,’’ this legislation goes 
from sloppy to worse. Most egre-
giously, it will increase the existing 
green card backlog. If we pass this leg-
islation on its own, high-skilled work-
ers from highly populated countries 
will have fewer and fewer green cards 
available to them, meaning they will 
have to wait longer and longer for re-
lief. In fact, by the time we stretch this 
out to 2030, the 195-year backlog I men-
tioned a moment ago would be ex-
tended out to a 400- to 450-year back-
log. That is not fair. I can’t imagine 
that is what the Senator from Illinois 
wants. 
If we want to actually protect the 
children of immigrant workers, we 
need to end the inequities of the green 
card system. Real protection for the 
children is impossible unless we have a 
fair path forward for the parents. 
I have worked for 9 years on a 
thoughtful solution to these problems 
in the Fairness for High-Skilled Immi-
grants Act. This compromise protects 
children, protects widows and wid-
owers, and it provides an equitable 
path forward for all our high-skilled 
immigrants. That is why I call on Sen-
ator DURBIN to lift his hold on the 
Fairness for High-Skilled Immigrants 
Act and to provide relief to immigrant 
children and to their parents. 
As to the suggestion that the changes 
made to this legislation were bad, that 
they were a departure from what we

agreed on, it is not true. The imple-
mentation delay simply allows the 
USCIS a time to develop the adequate 
infrastructure to implement what we 
had proposed, the 50–50 rule change. 
This 3 years is there to protect the H– 
1B visa holders who were already here. 
The hold-harmless provision was taken 
care of with the 3- to 9-year transition 
that now covers them. 
In any event, this legislation—the 
one Senator DURBIN now tries to pass 
by unanimous consent, introduced for 
the first time yesterday that I have 
now reviewed—is sloppy. It doesn’t 
solve the problem, and it would make a 
lot of things worse. I therefore object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard. 
The Senator from Illinois. 
Mr. 
DURBIN. 
Madam 
President, 
there is no question that there is a 
green card backlog for immigrant 
visas. We issue 140,000 employment- 
based visas a year and 226,000 family 
visas. There are some 5 million seeking 
them. I want to increase the number of 
green cards. The Senator from Utah op-
poses that. As a result, the bill that he 
introduced, according to analysis by 
the Congressional Research Service— 
this is not DURBIN’s language; this is 
the Congressional Research Service: S. 
386, the lead legislation, would not re-
duce future backlogs compared to cur-
rent law. 
When he talks about 195 years and 
John Quincy Adams or whatever his 
historical analogy was, he doesn’t ad-
dress that at all in S. 386. 
The problem, of course, is that he is 
bound to a position of his party that 
will not allow one additional new im-
migrant—none. I don’t take that posi-
tion. These men and women and their 
kids have been living in the United 
States. Many of them have been here 
for years, some of them for decades. 
Some of them are doctors in hospitals 
in my hometown. I trust them, and I 
trust their kids. What I am asking him 
to do today is simply join with me in 
protecting their children while we re-
solve the other issues. He refuses. He 
refused yesterday. He refuses again 
today. 
He calls my approach sloppy. Let’s 
see the Lee alternative to protect the 
children. I would like to see what he 
would like to propose. Maybe it is lan-
guage that is better, and maybe I can 
embrace it. But let’s take care of that 
discrete part of this issue. Why would 
we leave these children now aging into 
adults at risk? That is just the wrong 
way to approach this. We can solve this 
problem, and we should. While we solve 
it, we should protect these children. It 
is within the ken of both Senator LEE 
and myself to sit down through staff 
and come up with that language. I be-
lieve we can. 
I want to say I will continue to offer 
this opportunity for Senator LEE to 
protect these children until we can sit 
down in good faith and resolve any dif-
ferences we have between us. I have 
heard this case over and over again 
about the plight of these children. I am 
trying to address it. He continues to 
object. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Utah. 
Mr. LEE. Madam President, we have 
the opportunity right here to pass this 
right now. This bill fixes this problem. 
As to the suggestion that we can’t do 
any of this without increasing the 
total number of green cards—this is a 
poison pill. My friend and colleague 
knows that it is a poison pill. In fact, 
we had that very discussion. I don’t or-
dinarily—in fact, I have a uniform pol-
icy against publicly talking about pri-
vate conversations we have as col-
leagues. We have now brought it to the 
floor. 
We talked about this. This was the 
basis upon which we reached a deal in 
his office in December. The point there 
was to understand that we can’t pass 
something—certainly 
by 
unanimous 
consent—that increases the total num-
ber of employment-based green cards. 
It is not going to happen. So we are 
dealing here with that finite universe. 
That is the basis of the deal we reached 
in December. 
As to the suggestion that we can’t do 
anything without increasing the total 
number of green cards, the Senator 
knows that is not on the table. That is 
not fair. What we want to do is make 
this process fair, even if we only have 
a limited number of green cards to 
work with, which is the case. Whether 
you like that political reality or not, it 
is the political reality. It is the factual 
understanding that the Senator and I 
discussed and understood in December 
when we made that deal. The Lee alter-
native is the encapsulation of that. 
Madam President, I ask unanimous 
consent that the Judiciary Committee 
be discharged from further consider-
ation of H.R. 1044 and that the Senate 
proceed to its immediate consider-
ation; further, that the Lee amend-
ment at the desk be agreed to, the bill, 
as amended, be considered read a third 
time and passed, and that the motion 
to reconsider be considered made and 
laid upon the table. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
Mr. DURBIN. Reserving the right to 
object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Illinois. 
Mr. DURBIN. Just do the math; 
140,000 EB visas and 226,000 family visas 
per year and 5 million people waiting. 
If you think you can solve this without 
changing the number of green cards, 
you can’t. You may address it from one 
angle or another. You may help some 
who are waiting as opposed to others. 
You only give assistance to some at 
the expense of some other group. 
I understand the Senator’s position. I 
don’t quarrel with the fact he made it 
clear from the start that, from his per-
spective and perhaps from his side of 
the aisle, there is just no appetite for 
increasing the number of green cards, 
even for these people who have been 
living and working here in the United 
States for years and sometimes dec-
ades, even for physicians from India 
and other countries who are literally 
risking their lives today on COVID–19 
patients. The Senator told me there is 
no appetite for giving them additional 
green cards so they can stay here on a 
permanent basis. I think that is unfair, 
and that is my position. 
The Senator made it clear—and I am 
not saying otherwise—that he dis-
agrees with me. So what I tried to do is 
come in and say that at least during 
the pendency, while they are waiting 
for green cards—which could be dec-
ades unless the law is changed—let’s at 
least protect their families. That is all 
I basically said. 
He has come back and said: I want to 
put in a provision that takes out the 
hold-harmless protection. I want to 
protect these people who are outsourc-
ing companies in India that have cap-
tured the lion’s share of these H–1B 
visas. I want to make sure that those 
who are going to be protected have to 
wait up to 3 years before there is any 
protection. 
Why in the world would we do any of 
those things? I am willing to sit down and 
talk to you, but I am not going to accept 
these at this point unless we can find a start-
ing point, which is protection for the chil-
dren of these families. If you will agree to 
that, I will be more than happy to discuss 
the other provisions again, but because the 
other provisions are now what you are offer-
ing, I object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard. 
The Senator from Utah. 
Mr. LEE. Madam President, the pro-
tection for the children is now found in 
the proposal, in the amendment at the 
desk—the one that was just objected to 
by my friend and colleague, the Sen-
ator from Illinois. 
I would ask my colleague rhetori-
cally or directly, as he may choose: If, 
in fact, he is unwilling and remains un-
willing to negotiate on any bill ad-
dressing this problem without increas-
ing the total number of employment- 
based green cards, why in the world did 
he waste months of my time? Why did 
he lead me to believe, while in his of-
fice, that he was open to such an agree-
ment that was, in fact, the premise 
upon which we proceeded? We spent 
months on that, and I worked in good 
faith. 
As I mentioned yesterday, it was 
against my better judgment that I 
agreed to announce with the Senator 
on the Senate floor that we had 
reached an agreement because I knew 
that we had to work out a few kinks, 
but I proceeded based solely on the fea-
sibility and our ability to implement 
that bill. That was the only change 
that we made. 
Now, if the Senator wants to make 
some adjustment to that, bring it for-
ward. I would love to consider it. Yet 
what he is now telling me is that the 
premise upon which we proceeded on 
those negotiations and then spent

weeks and months working on was 
false in that the whole premise that we 
could reach some sort of compromise— 
an actual compromise—that wouldn’t 
increase the number of total green 
cards available was illusory. I find that 
disappointing. 
Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, the 
Senator has addressed a question to 
me, I believe. 
Mr. LEE. Rhetorically or otherwise, 
the Senator is welcome to answer. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Illinois. 
Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I 
know other Senators are waiting to 
speak, so I will try to be as concise and 
brief as possible. 
I understand the Senator’s position. 
He doesn’t want another green card. He 
believes Members on his side of the 
aisle don’t want an increase in the 
number of green cards—period. I knew 
that going in. He made that abun-
dantly clear. We can’t solve the under-
lying problem without it, but we can 
make it better. That is why we con-
tinue to talk and negotiate, and I hope 
we will continue to talk and negotiate. 
Yet, for goodness’ sake, the starting 
point ought to be the protection of 
these children. 
Can we not agree that we will protect 
the children and then proceed to con-
tinue the negotiations on the premise 
that the Senator cannot accept one 
more green card? I can, and the Sen-
ator can’t, but we will try to improve 
the system with that premise accepted. 
At the starting point, for goodness’ 
sake, let’s protect the children while 
we negotiate and debate. Hopefully, we 
can do it on a timely basis. That is my 
response. 
I am willing to continue to work. I 
understand the Senator cannot issue 
another green card. The math never 
works with 5 million people waiting 
and 140,000 employment green cards 
and 226,000 family visas a year. It is 
never going to work, but I am willing 
to try to make the system better, with 
the understanding that I will increase 
the number of green cards and that the 
Senator will not. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Utah. 
Mr. LEE. Madam President, I am al-
ways happy to discuss any counter-
proposal. If the Senator would make 
one, I would love to see it. It is not fair 
to say I don’t care about those kids be-
cause I am unwilling to create addi-
tional green cards. If the Senator 
wants to protect these children, pass 
this bill. Pass it today. Pass it at this 
very moment. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Massachusetts. 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST—S. 4019 
Mr. MARKEY. Madam President, I 
rise to speak in support of S. 4019, the 
Juneteenth National Independence Day 
Act—legislation that I have introduced 
along with Senator CORNYN. We have 54 
cosponsors and broad bipartisan sup-
port that would make Juneteenth a 
Federal holiday. In a few minutes, I 
will ask unanimous consent that the 
Senate take up and pass this important 
bill. 
Our country is in the midst of a long 
overdue reckoning on race and justice. 
The murder of George Floyd by mem-
bers of the Minneapolis Police Depart-
ment has galvanized the Nation as pro-
testers have taken to our streets, de-
manding justice—justice for George 
Floyd, justice for Breonna Taylor, and 
justice for countless other Black and 
Brown Americans who have been hurt 
or killed at the hands of law enforce-
ment. Yet this reckoning goes well be-
yond seeking accountability for police 
officers who betray the trust we bestow 
upon them. 
The disparate treatment and mis-
treatment of Black and Brown Ameri-
cans permeates our society. It infects 
our courts, our schools, and our places 
of work. It reflects the unfulfilled 
promise of a nation built upon the no-
tion that all are created equal, and it 
has its roots in our Nation’s original 
sin—slavery—a crime against human-
ity that we have for far too long failed 
to acknowledge, address, or come to 
grips with. 
One way to further the process of ra-
cial reconciliation and healing is to 
recognize, honor, and celebrate the for-
mal end of slavery in the United States 
and to do so at the Federal level. Per-
haps the most effective, direct, and far- 
reaching way to do that is with a Fed-
eral holiday commemorating that his-
toric event. 
For 
more 
than 
150 
years, 
the 
Juneteenth holiday, which marks the 
emancipation of slaves, has been ob-
served one way or the other across our 
Nation, including in Texas, but it is 
long past time to place Juneteenth on 
par with other Federal holidays so that 
all Americans in all 50 States will cele-
brate Juneteenth alongside Veterans 
Day, Memorial Day, Martin Luther 
King Day, and other Federal holidays. 
The celebration of Juneteenth dates 
back to June 19, 1865, when Union sol-
diers, led by MG Gordon Granger, trav-
eled to Galveston, TX, with the an-
nouncement that the Civil War had 
ended and that the enslaved were now 
free. This was 21⁄2 years after the date 
of President Lincoln’s Emancipation 
Proclamation, but either the news of 
Lincoln’s order had not reached many, 
including those in Texas, or local offi-
cials had refused to enforce it. 
On June 19, 1865, Major General 
Granger read to the people of Texas 
General Order No. 3, the first lines of 
which told them clearly and unequivo-
cally: ‘‘The people of Texas are in-
formed that, in accordance with a 
Proclamation from the Executive of 
the United States, all slaves are free.’’ 
Juneteenth celebrations followed as 
did the recognition of Juneteenth as 
the formal end of slavery in the United 
States. Since 1865, communities all 
across the Nation have celebrated 
Juneteenth with parades, cookouts, 
prayer gatherings, historical and cul-
tural readings, musical performances, 
and many other celebrations. These 
events have provided many with the 
opportunity for reflection, education, 
and a deeper understanding of our his-
tory as a nation—the whole history— 
and how it has affected and shaped the 
lives of Black Americans. 
Nearly every State and the District 
of Columbia have passed legislation 
recognizing Juneteenth as a holiday or 
observance, and the Senate has passed 
a resolution designating June 19 as 
Juneteenth 
Independence 
Day, 
but 
Juneteenth has never received the 
higher status it deserves as a Federal 
holiday. The Juneteenth National Inde-
pendence Day Act rights this wrong 
and makes Juneteenth a Federal holi-
day. 
We still must travel a long and dif-
ficult road to justice and equality in 
the United States, but we cannot get 
there without recognizing the original 
sin of slavery and marking its end. It is 
incumbent 
upon 
all 
Americans 
to 
truthfully acknowledge and understand 
our past and how it affects our present 
and our future. Making Juneteenth a 
Federal holiday will not right all of the 
wrongs of the past or fix what remains 
broken, but it is an important step. It 
is the truth of our history and the 
missing half of the story of our Na-
tion’s freedom and independence. It is 
long past time to recognize Juneteenth 
as a Federal holiday. 
Let me stop there and recognize my 
partner in this effort, the senior Sen-
ator from Texas. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Texas. 
Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, I 
will be brief. 
Let me just tell the Senator from 
Massachusetts that I agree with every-
thing he has said. It shows how people 
of, 
maybe, 
different 
political 
ideologies—certainly 
different 
par-
ties—can come together and recognize 
that there is a moment available to us 
here in which we can demonstrate our 
nonpartisan support for this act of ra-
cial reconciliation in our country. 
I agree that slavery was the original 
sin. Our founding documents said that 
all men and women were created equal, 
but that certainly wasn’t the practice 
when it came to African Americans at 
the time who were officially designated 
as something less than fully human. It 
was an outrageous act at the time, and 
our country has paid a dear price for 
that over the years—from the Civil 
War to the violence that led up to the 
peaceful civil rights movement in the 
sixties. It is obvious from the recent 
events—George Floyd’s death in par-
ticular—that we are not where we need 
to be. We still have room to grow as 
part of our developing that more per-
fect Union. 
I know our friend and colleague TIM 
SCOTT, who has been at the forefront of 
this discussion with his advocacy for 
the Justice Act, has a lot of bipartisan 
ideas for police reform. He points out 
that, as an African American, his expe-
rience has been much different from

July 22, 2020 
those who are non-African Americans. 
He said, over the last two decades, he 
has been stopped—as he puts it, ‘‘driv-
ing while Black’’—about 18 different 
times. 
At a roundtable that was sponsored 
by Mayor Sylvester Turner and that I 
had requested, I sat next to a pastor of 
a church in Houston who happened to 
be the local head of the NAACP. 
He said: I honor the police. I respect 
the police. I support the police. Yet he 
said: My son is afraid of the police, and 
we have to do everything we can to 
cure that trust deficit. 
In 
Texas, 
we 
have 
recognized 
Juneteenth as a State holiday for 40 
years, obviously, because of the fact 
that this occurred as a result of the 
Emancipation 
Proclamation’s 
being 
announced in Galveston, TX. Yet I re-
cently cosponsored a bill with Con-
gresswoman SHEILA
JACKSON
LEE
to 
study a trail, basically, from Galveston 
to Houston as the possible designation 
of a national park in further recogni-
tion of this event. 
I believe strongly that we need to re-
member our history because if we don’t 
remember our history, in the words of 
one sage, ‘‘we will be condemned to re-
live it.’’ We have come so far, but we 
know we still have further to go. I do 
believe that the appropriate word to 
use is ‘‘reconciliation.’’ This is an op-
portunity for us to demonstrate our 
concern and our commitment to equal 
justice and equal treatment under the 
law by recognizing Juneteenth as a 
Federal holiday. 
Mr. MARKEY. I thank the Senator 
from Texas. This is a thoroughly bipar-
tisan effort, and it is long overdue. 
Madam President, I ask unanimous 
consent that the Committee on the Ju-
diciary be discharged from further con-
sideration and that the Senate now 
proceed to S. 4019; further, that the bill 
be considered read a third time and 
passed; and that the motion to recon-
sider be considered made and laid upon 
the table. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
The Senator from Wisconsin. 
Mr. JOHNSON. Madam President, in 
reserving the right to object, let me 
start out by saying that I agree with 
virtually everything my colleagues 
from both Massachusetts and Texas 
have said about celebrating the eman-
cipation of the slaves. That was an im-
portant moment in U.S. history. It 
should be observed, and it should be 
celebrated. I have no disagreement 
whatsoever with that at all. The one 
area of disagreement is how the bill’s 
sponsors have chosen to celebrate that 
holiday. 
As the Senator from Massachusetts 
pointed out, since 1865, it has been ob-
served with celebrations and cookouts, 
which is the appropriate way of doing 
this. I object to the fact that, by nam-
ing it a national holiday—and what 
they are leaving out of their argument 
and its main impact—it will give Fed-
eral workers a paid day off that the 
rest of America will have to pay for. 
When I asked for a CBO score, the 
sponsors of the bill had not even ob-
tained a score, and I still don’t think 
they have obtained a score. The esti-
mate, in terms of what it will cost 
American taxpayers in the private sec-
tor to pay for a paid holiday for Fed-
eral workers, is about $600 million per 
year. The CBO score would come in at 
$6 billion over 10. 
In terms of why I object, let me just 
put a couple of facts to that $600 mil-
lion bill that hard-working taxpayers 
would have to foot in an era when we 
are $26.5 trillion in debt and when 17 
million of our fellow Americans are 
currently unemployed. 
The first chart here—let’s just talk 
about how many days off Federal work-
ers get currently. 
I have two columns—minimum and 
maximum. For paid holidays, they get 
10, which is pretty generous. Most peo-
ple in the private sector get something 
similar—7, 8, 9, or 10. For paid leave 
days, there is a minimum of 13, up to 
26; for paid sick days, 13, minimum and 
maximum. 
What we just added in last year’s 
NDAA was paid parental leave, which 
allows an individual—either mother or 
father, with either a natural childbirth 
or an adoption—60 days of paid leave. 
So for a total, at a minimum, there 
are 96 days, up to 109 days if they take 
paid parental leave. 
Looked at a different way, as a ratio, 
if they take the maximum number of 
109 days, that is, basically, for every 1.4 
days you work, you get a day off. On a 
minimum basis with paid parental 
leave, for every 1.7 days you work, you 
get a day off. 
Now, again, I realize the paid paren-
tal leave is a ‘‘just a few times in some-
body’s career’’ phenomenon, so let’s 
take a look at this without paid paren-
tal leave, and it will show that the 
number of days with pay that Federal 
workers get off is still quite generous. 
Again, paid holidays, they get 10; 
paid leave, 13, up to 26; paid sick leave, 
13, for a total of 36 to 49. 
So, again, going back to that ratio, 
the maximum number of days without 
paid parental leave, a Federal worker 
can work 4.3 days and then get a day 
off—basically a 4-day workweek for the 
entire year. That is quite generous. 
So what I am objecting to is creating 
a national holiday that gives Federal 
workers another day off with pay, paid 
for by the American taxpayer, and we 
are collectively already $26.5 trillion in 
debt. 
Last slide. I would like to just, in 
general, talk about the private sector 
pay versus Federal worker pay. I know 
there are some disputes about this in 
terms of education and that type of 
thing, but still, this is pretty solid in-
formation. 
The 2018 average annual wage—just 
wages, salary or wages—for Federal 
workers is over $94,000. For private sec-
tor workers, the average is about 
$63,000 or about 67 percent of what a 
Federal worker makes. 
When you add in benefits, total com-
pensation, the average total compensa-
tion for Federal workers in 2018 was 
$136,000, just shy of $136,000. In the pri-
vate sector, the total cost of compensa-
tion is a little more than $75,000—55 
percent of what Federal Government 
workers make. 
So if you strip out and just compare 
the benefits, again, we are talking 
about an extra paid day off, an extra 
paid holiday for only Federal workers 
to celebrate Juneteenth, paid for by 
American workers who make about 
$12,000, on average per benefit, com-
pared to $41,000 in benefits for Federal 
workers. That is only 29 percent. 
So those are the facts. Again, that is 
what I object to. 
Again, I am happy to celebrate 
Juneteenth. I think we should cele-
brate the fact that we did remove that 
original 
sin 
by 
emancipating 
the 
slaves. That is a day of celebration. I 
agree with that. I simply don’t believe 
we should make American taxpayers in 
the private sector pony up $600 million 
a year, $6 billion over 10 years, to give 
Federal workers, who already are paid 
quite generously and have quite a few 
days off one more paid day off. 
So what I am proposing—again, I 
don’t object to Juneteenth and a cele-
bration, but if we are going to make 
that a Federal holiday, the main im-
pact of that is giving Federal workers 
a paid day off. I would just suggest 
this: Why don’t we take away one of 
their days of paid leave? 
So I have an amendment at the desk, 
and I would ask that the Senator from 
Massachusetts modify his request to 
include my amendment at the desk; 
that the amendment be considered and 
agreed to; that the bill, as amended, be 
considered read a third time and 
passed; and that the motions to recon-
sider be considered made and laid upon 
the table. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the 
Senator so modify his request? 
Mr. MARKEY. Madam President, re-
serving the right to object, the Sen-
ator’s proposal—rather than allowing 
this unanimous consent request to go 
through, the Senator proposes to hold 
it hostage to taking away the leave 
benefits that come with paid holidays 
for American workers. That is some-
thing we have never done before, and 
with good reason. We shouldn’t be pe-
nalizing our workers by taking away 
benefits, especially not in the current 
environment and especially not as the 
price to pay for recognizing a long 
overdue Federal holiday. 
I object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard. 
Is there objection to the original re-
quest? 
Mr. JOHNSON. Madam President, re-
serving the right to object, and to 
quickly respond to the Senator from 
Massachusetts, I am not taking any-
thing away from Federal workers. I am 
just not willing to give them an extra 
day paid.

So if we create Juneteenth as a Fed-
eral paid holiday, they will get an 
extra day, and I am just saying let’s 
keep them whole by removing a paid 
leave day, and then they will have the 
exact same number of days off as they 
have currently, and the American tax-
payer will not be out an extra $600 mil-
lion per year or $6 billion over 10 years. 
I object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-

The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-

PRESCRIPTION DRUG COSTS 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, 
before I speak, several of my colleagues 
on this side of the aisle, over the next 
several minutes—well, probably for 
more than a half hour—will be coming 
to the floor to discuss what I am dis-
cussing, which is a very important 
problem we have of rapidly increasing 
drug prices. 
After I speak, these other Senators 
will come to the floor: Senator BRAUN, 
Senator 
CASSIDY, 
Senator 
COLLINS, 
Senator 
HYDE-SMITH, 
Senator 
MCSALLY. All of these people have been 
very favorable in support of the Pre-
scription Drug Reduction Act, and I 
want to thank them for participating 
in bringing attention to this very im-
portant issue of unjustified increases in 
drug prices. 
After these folks I just mentioned 
speak, I understand that my colleague 
from Iowa, who is in support of the leg-
islation, is going to come at a later 
time today. 
So thank you to my colleagues. 
According to a recent Gallup poll, 9 
out of 10 Americans are concerned 
about prescription drug prices. Specifi-
cally, they are concerned that the 
pharmaceutical industry will take ad-
vantage of the current pandemic to in-
crease drug prices. That poll was pub-
lished a month ago. Unfortunately, 
those concerns have become a reality 
now. 
Two weeks ago, POLITICO reported 
that pharmaceutical companies have 
raised prices on hundreds of prescrip-
tion drugs just during the pandemic. 
The report says that there have been 
more than 800—800—price increases 
just this year. 
I have been working on a bill for over 
a year and a half to stem these in-
creases and rein in drug prices. It 
would cap costs for Medicare recipi-
ents, cap increases to the rate of infla-
tion, and save taxpayers nearly $100 
billion. It wasn’t simple, but I am glad 
to have produced this kind of bill with 
Ranking Member WYDEN and my col-
leagues here with me today. 
But I am disappointed. My partner 
and all of my Democratic colleagues 
who approved this bill in committee by 
a vote of 19 to 9 declined to cosponsor 
an improved version of the bill that 
they helped put together in the first 
place, and this is the work of about 18 
months. 
I can’t be sure why, but I have to as-
sume it is because it is an election 
year, and, somehow, passing a bill that 
would do so much good in a time with 
so much hardship might help Repub-
licans who also support the bill, hurt-
ing Democrats’ chances of taking the 
majority. 
As we consider a new relief bill, we 
ought to put aside that kind of poli-
tics-before-people 
method 
of 
legis-
lating. We need to approve the Pre-
scription Drug Pricing Reduction Act 
as part of this package. Our country is 
facing the most serious public health 
crisis in a generation—not just a gen-
eration, if you think back—in genera-
tions. 
Millions of Americans are newly un-
employed, and many small businesses 
have slowed or shuttered altogether. 
People across the country are stretch-
ing their paychecks and their savings 
to get through this virus pandemic. 
In the CARES Act, passed in March, 
and 
in 
subsequent 
legislation, 
we 
helped slow the hurt caused by this 
virus. But there is only so much a 
stimulus check or tax relief can do 
when your bills just keep coming and 
going up—meaning the pharmaceutical 
bills. 
These drug price increases are a 
weight that Americans shouldn’t have 
to bear, especially seniors on whom the 
virus is taking a particular toll. 
The increases aren’t a result of a 
functioning marketplace or an indus-
try with healthy competition. Address-
ing these price increases is also some-
thing we all largely agree on. 
In 2016, the President campaigned on 
making the marketplace for prescrip-
tion drugs fairer and more affordable 
for patients. He won. He even talked 
about that promise in a State of the 
Union message when he said that he 
wants Congress to send a bill for him 
to sign this year. 
So the President made that campaign 
promise in 2016, and the President has 
done many things since then to carry 
out that campaign promise. He has 
even helped me in the development of 
this legislation. 
That was 2016. This is 2020. In 2018, we 
have had many House Democrats cam-
paign on making the marketplace for 
prescription drugs fairer and more af-
fordable. Many of them won, and they 
took over the House of Representa-
tives. It is time to put politics aside 
and finally act. 
Just because Big Pharma was bank-
rupting patients before the pandemic 
doesn’t mean that we should allow 
them to keep on doing it now. In fact, 
there is no better time to put an end to 
Big Pharma’s price gouging than right 
now. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Indiana. 
Mr. BRAUN. Madam President, Sen-
ator GRASSLEY and I share a passion 
that I think most Americans do in that 
it is time that we end this stranglehold 
that the healthcare industry has on all 
of us because they pose as free enter-
prisers, but there is nothing free about 
the way they actually operate. 
‘‘Free enterprise’’ means you em-
brace competition. You are not putting 
up barriers to entry. You engage the 
consumer so that they can see what 
you are charging them. That does not 
occur. The alternative will be as clear 
on the other side of the aisle; they 
want to make government the business 
partner of healthcare. If the industry 
doesn’t get with it and start doing 
what all the rest of us do when we go 
to the marketplace—embrace competi-
tion, be willing to compete, don’t ask 
for barriers to entry, and, yes, we tell 
the customer what we charge them be-
fore they buy it. That doesn’t happen 
in healthcare. 
The market is opaque and complex. 
There is nothing free about it, except 
that drugmakers are free to charge 
whatever they want. The market is de-
pendent on government-sanctioned re-
bates and monopolies by the FDA 
exclusivities and patent abuse. It is 
time to fix this. PBM may not mean 
much to the public, but it stands for 
pharmacy benefit managers. This is a 
structure of middleman that is not 
present in other industries. Normally, 
with transparency, prices cascade down 
through the system in a way that ev-
erybody can see it, and the successful 
survivors in that industry have per-
formed because they give good value to 
their customers; they keep their over-
head low; and they earn the business. 
PBMs use techniques like spread 
pricing. Normally, there is a spread— 
you buy it for this and sell it for that— 
but not where people can’t see it. It is 
time that we get away from this com-
plexity and the opaqueness of it be-
cause the day of reckoning will come, 
and the day of reckoning is not too far 
away. 
I recently came from the business 
world. No one likes the healthcare in-
dustry other than the CEOs and owners 
of these businesses. All of us who have 
to deal with them are just asking for 
that one simple thing: Show us what 
things cost. Quit hiding it. Insurance 
companies have these secret deals with 
hospitals, with pharma, and it is start-
ing to cost too much. It shows up in 
the fact that it is nearly 20 percent of 
our GDP in the United States, and it 
costs almost half of that in most other 
developed countries. The sad thing is, 
the results aren’t any better. In many 
cases, the results are better at a price 
that is half the cost. 
Both Chairman GRASSLEY and I have 
talked with President Trump. Presi-
dent Trump has been the most vocal 
individual in DC about trying to get 
the industry to work like the rest of us 
entrepreneurs do. Every time he has an 
Executive order, they take him to 
court. That is ending because just re-
cently the hospitals tried that, and the 
district court overturned it. They will 
probably appeal it, and, hopefully, the 
appellate court will overturn it. 
I have a transparency bill which is as 
simple as: Show us what you are charg-
ing us before we engage your service.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S4393 
July 22, 2020 
Mr. GRASSLEY has the same thing basi-
cally on drug pricing. Let me tell you 
how that works. 
This is a real live experiment that I 
put into place 12 years ago. I was so 
sick and tired of the insurance agents 
coming in and telling me how lucky I 
was that it was only going up 5 to 10 
percent this year. I didn’t think I was 
very lucky. My company wasn’t large 
enough to spend a lot of time on it. 
When we got to be 300 employees, that 
starts to add up. Now we have 1,000 em-
ployees. Thank goodness my kids have 
to deal with that with a good, young 
executive team, but I put something in 
place 12 years ago that I am proud of. 
I said enough was enough. What do 
we have that is really going to change 
the dynamic? You have to remember, 
this is 12 years ago—talk about trying 
to find transparency then. We were 
lucky that we were large enough to 
self-insure. By doing that, we probably 
saved close to 25 percent, and by engag-
ing our employees in their own well- 
being and incentivizing them to shop 
around to enable their ability to find 
better prices, it was even there if you 
looked for it hard back then. Long 
story short, we have not had a pre-
mium increase at my company in 12 
years. I am proud of that. We covered 
preexisting conditions with no caps on 
coverage because we took a radical 
change to how healthcare should be 
bought by the consumer, the employer, 
and forced the transparency out of a 
system that wasn’t giving much of it 
then. 
Now there is more transparency, but 
it is just on the fringes. If you get that 
to happen, prices will cascade down 
through the system. President Trump 
had 
another 
Executive 
order 
for 
pharma—all these expensive drugs you 
see advertised—to put the price along 
with the advertisement. A lot of times 
it is deceptive—you can get it for as 
little as $5 a month. Well, somebody is 
paying for that $60,000 or $70,000 drug. 
Generally, it is the employer, and the 
employee some of it, but it is, again, 
due to the fact that we can’t see any-
thing. 
Americans 
are 
blindfolded 
from 
prices, only to receive medical bills, 
often, that arrive 2 months later. They 
have no idea, and they open up the en-
velope with trepidation. Oh my good-
ness. It wasn’t what I thought it would 
be. More often than not, it is: Oh, my 
gosh. This is terrible. It has got to end. 
It would be different if we were ask-
ing for something that is radical. What 
we are asking for is tell us what you 
are charging us before we have to en-
gage your services. 
That is why it is so important. The 
White House is behind it. Hopefully, 
the other side of the aisle will get be-
hind it. Support Chairman GRASSLEY’s 
bill, the Prescription Drug Pricing Re-
duction Act, and support my bill, the 
Healthcare Price Transparency Act. 
The story I told you about my own 
company would happen across the 
country, and we wouldn’t be com-
plaining about these surprise billings. 
We wouldn’t be holding our breath. We 
would simply be doing what all edu-
cated consumers do when they go to 
buy from a truly free enterprise. 
I yield the floor. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
CRAMER). The Senator from Louisiana. 
Mr. 
CASSIDY. 
Mr. 
President, 
COVID–19 is a continuing threat to 
Americans’ 
physical 
and 
financial 
health, and it is at this intersection 
that Congress can make a meaningful 
impact on the family budgets of all 
Americans by passing sensible legisla-
tion to lower the cost of prescription 
drugs through measures such as the 
Prescription Drug Pricing Reduction 
Act or, as I like to call it, the ‘‘Making 
Coronavirus 
Medications 
Affordable 
Act.’’ 
There is an urgent need to lower the 
cost of prescription drugs. The high 
price of drugs is not a new problem, but 
it is a problem that is going to be made 
worse by the coronavirus pandemic. 
Millions of households have seen their 
incomes 
suffer 
due 
to 
economic 
lockdowns aimed at containing the 
virus. 
It is encouraging that job numbers 
continue to outpace expectations, but 
still, millions of fellow Americans are 
out of work, which affects their pock-
etbook and potentially their insurance 
coverage. Americans do not need the 
added burden of expensive drugs, par-
ticularly right now. 
Congress is providing relief for Amer-
ican families and businesses through 
the COVID–19 crisis, and we are consid-
ering another round of support. I think 
we should include how do we make 
drugs more affordable. That way, if 
folks become ill, they know that they 
will be able to afford the cure. I believe 
the best path forward is the ‘‘Making 
Coronavirus Drugs Affordable Act,’’ as 
I call it, or, as Chairman GRASSLEY 
calls it, the Prescription Drug Pricing 
Reduction Act. I like mine better. 
Now, the difficulty in addressing the 
issue of the price of medications is that 
a balance must be struck between mak-
ing sure the medication is affordable 
but also making sure there is still a 
profit motive that will incentivize the 
researchers and pharmaceutical com-
panies to find these cures that we know 
we need. Just think about it. Without 
innovation, we would not be able to 
find a vaccine for coronavirus—a vac-
cine that will save millions of lives 
worldwide and allow us to go back to a 
normal life. 
Let me just praise the pharma-
ceutical industry. We have seen them 
respond to this crisis in many helpful 
ways. Additionally, they recently com-
mitted 
a 
billion 
dollars 
to 
anti-
microbial resistance, which is to say, 
to find an antibiotic that will work 
when other antibiotics no longer do. 
They have invested in large-scale and 
rapid treatment options, and, again, it 
is only through innovation that we will 
beat this virus and end the pandemic. 
But we must remember this: If a pa-
tient cannot afford the innovation, the 
new medicine, it is as if the innovation 
never 
occurred. 
The 
‘‘Making 
Coronavirus Drugs Affordable Act’’ 
strikes the balance between lowering 
costs for families and incentivizing 
companies to find those cures. 
Let me show you what this bill does. 
It caps the patient’s out-of-pocket ex-
penses. It lets patients pay over time. 
It protects patients from price gouging, 
and it preserves the incentive for com-
panies to find cures. Let me explain 
each of these. 
First, the bill caps the out-of-pocket 
expense for those in the Medicare Part 
D Program, our senior citizens, and 
particularly for the most vulnerable 
seniors with chronic conditions. Re-
search has shown that seniors are at 
the most risk for severe complications 
and death from COVID–19. When a 
treatment or cure is widely available, 
cost should never be a barrier for a sen-
ior to access the drug that she or he 
needs to survive. 
Under the current system, this is 
what a senior citizen pays for their me-
dicinal benefit under Medicare Part D. 
They have a deductible for which the 
senior pays 100 percent; the initial cov-
erage phase and the coverage gap 
phase, for which they pay one-fourth of 
the expense; and then in the cata-
strophic phase, the patient pays 5 per-
cent of the cost no matter how high 
that expense goes. 
So let’s imagine a medication which 
costs over $1 million. They are paying 
5 percent of that medication cost, and 
if I could stand up any higher—but I 
keep losing my microphone—they will 
pay 5 percent of that. Think about a 
theoretical drug that costs $3 million a 
year. The senior would be required to 
pay 5 percent of whatever that drug 
costs. That is under current law. What 
we are trying to do is fix this. If this 
occurs, the senior will not be able to 
afford lifesaving medications. 
Under the legislation that we are at-
tempting to pass, it would change the 
Medicare Part D standard benefit so 
that there is still the initial deductible 
in which the senior pays 100 percent, 
but after paying 20 percent of the ini-
tial coverage phase, there is no longer 
that 5 percent toward infinity. We 
make medications affordable for the 
senior. If that is all the bill did, we 
would do something quite remarkable 
for the ability of a patient to be able to 
afford a potentially lifesaving drug. 
By the way, as a physician, I know 
this is a barrier for patients to be able 
to have their drugs. So we address that 
in this bill. 
The second thing we do—you might 
say: Wait a second. The senior citizen 
if he or she has to pay for all this for 
a very expensive drug in the month of 
January, they can’t afford that. Under 
the current situation, the senior has to 
pay her deductible and her initial cov-
erage phase whenever it is due, which 
might be in the first week of the year. 
What we also do in this bill is we give 
the senior citizen the opportunity to 
pay all this lump sum as a series of

payments over 12 months. So let’s 
imagine that this was $10,000. Instead 
of having to pay all of it in January, 
she could pay $800 every month over 
the course of the year. That allows her 
to budget and to factor it in with the 
other sources of income that she has. 
Not only do we cap the senior citizen’s 
out-of-pocket expense, but we also 
allow her to pay that expense over a 
set of months so she can factor it into 
her budget. That is the second great 
thing that this bill does. 
What is another thing that we do? 
Senator BRAUN also referred to this, 
but we also have cost transparency. If 
there is a medication which has the 
price being elevated unnecessarily, and 
if the customer knew that, she would 
know: Wait a second. I can get my 
medications far less expensively here 
versus there or, if I accept a substitute, 
again, the medication will be more af-
fordable. We mandate that kind of 
price transparency that allows the cus-
tomer to make an informed decision. 
Now, I know there are competing 
ideas on how to lower drug costs. House 
Democrats, for example, have intro-
duced 
legislation 
that 
they 
claim 
would lower costs. But, remember, I 
told you that there is this tension. How 
do we preserve the incentive to inno-
vate while still making sure the inno-
vation is affordable? 
House Democrats have put up a bill. 
Yes, it makes medicine more afford-
able, but it kills the desire to innovate. 
The Congressional Budget Office has 
estimated that if the bill the House 
Democrats have proposed is passed, 
there will be 38 fewer cures invented by 
pharmaceutical 
manufacturers—38 
fewer cures. 
Let me tell you a story. I mentioned 
that I am a physician. I came of age in 
my residency, if you will, when the 
AIDS epidemic hit. I was 25 years old 
or 27 years old, and I would see men my 
age dying of HIV. We didn’t have an 
antibody then. If you were diagnosed 
with HIV—again, we called it AIDS 
then—you basically were dead because 
we had no cures. Since then, we now 
have medications that—if you are in-
fected with HIV, you can live until you 
are 75 years old or 80 years old. We 
have found something that doesn’t 
quite cure, but it allows it to be treat-
ed as a chronic condition. What if we 
didn’t have that cure? What if that 
were one of the 38 cures we never had? 
What if one of the cures we lose out 
on is a cure for Alzheimer’s? My par-
ents died of Alzheimer’s. All of us know 
somebody affected by Alzheimer’s or 
dementia. What if the cure we lose is 
the cure for Alzheimer’s? 
You may think you are making medi-
cations less expensive, but in terms of 
human life, you are making it that 
much more expensive because instead 
of finding that cure for Alzheimer’s, 
you instead have consigned those peo-
ple with Alzheimer’s to a slow, awful 
death—awful for them and awful for 
their loved ones as they see their par-
ents decline. I would argue that it is 
fool’s gold to say that the House Demo-
cratic bill saves money. It just shifts 
it, and it shifts it to the misery of the 
family who will never enjoy one of 
these cures that are not otherwise de-
veloped. 
To fix the problem of the high cost of 
drugs, it will take a bipartisan coali-
tion. We have that with this bill. It 
ends government handouts to pharma-
ceutical companies, but it doesn’t 
price-fix. It saves $80 billion for the 
taxpayer and for the patient, and it 
maintains incentives for lifesaving in-
novations. 
Some in this Chamber will be tempt-
ed to stop this bill until after this 
year’s election. To them, I would say: 
Don’t let politics keep us from deliv-
ering drug-pricing relief for American 
families. Too much is on the line, espe-
cially during this pandemic. To do 
nothing while families try to pay med-
ical bills is wrong. Let’s work together 
to pass this bill to lower the cost of 
drugs, to protect innovation, and to 
save lives. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Maine. 
Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, first, 
let me recognize and thank Senator 
GRASSLEY for his extraordinary leader-
ship on an issue that matters so great-
ly to the American people, and that is 
the high cost of prescription drugs. His 
persistence has produced the Prescrip-
tion Drug Pricing Reduction Act, a far- 
reaching set of bold proposals that I 
strongly endorse and that build on the 
work I have done as the chairman of 
the Senate Aging Committee. 
More than half of all Americans and 
90 percent of our seniors take at least 
one prescription drug each month. We 
should be able to work together to help 
the American people—particularly our 
seniors—on an issue that affects their 
health and their finances. No senior 
should be faced with the choice of buy-
ing food they need, paying a bill for the 
oil to heat their home, or buying their 
prescription drug. 
I remember very well being in line at 
the pharmacy in Bangor, ME, and the 
couple in front of me found out that 
their copay was $113. The husband 
looked at his wife and he said: Honey, 
we just can’t afford that. They left the 
prescription that one of them needed 
that was prescribed by their doctor 
there on the pharmacy counter. When I 
asked the pharmacist how often this 
happens, he said: Each and every day. 
Every day. 
That is why we should be working to-
gether to pass Senator GRASSLEY’s bill, 
as well as many of the other bipartisan 
bills that you have heard described 
today, including legislation that I have 
advocated to improve the lives of mil-
lions of Americans. This goal surely 
should be beyond partisan politics. 
In just the last year, three Senate 
committees advanced legislation to re-
form our flawed drug-pricing system. I 
can’t think of anything else that we 
buy where the price is less transparent 
and is more opaque than prescription 
drugs. 
The Finance Committee’s bill, the 
Prescription Drug Pricing Reduction 
Act, which I am proud to cosponsor, 
would make crucial improvements. As 
Senator CASSIDY just ably explained, 
one of the most important improve-
ments is to Medicare Part D. It would 
protect our seniors with an out-of- 
pocket spending limit. It would also in-
clude cost-control measures, such as an 
inflationary cap to limit price hikes. 
We have made some progress in this 
area. 
I have authored legislation that is 
making a difference for patients. One 
of the laws I authored bans gag clauses 
that had prohibited pharmacists from 
informing their customers if there were 
a less expensive way to purchase their 
prescription drug. Amazingly enough, 
sometimes it is cheaper to pay out-of- 
pocket than to use your insurance 
card—not something that most con-
sumers would ever realize unless the 
pharmacist informed him or her. 
My bill also updates a 2003 law re-
quiring drug manufacturers to notify 
the Federal Trade Commission of pat-
ent settlement agreements, giving the 
agency greater visibility into whether 
they include tactics such as anti-com-
petitive reverse payments that slow or 
defeat the introduction of lower cost 
drugs. Another law I authored is help-
ing to bring lower cost generics to the 
marketplace more quickly by expe-
diting their approval by the FDA. 
But clearly there is more that we 
must do. At a time when economic and 
health security are more linked than 
ever, Congress has an opportunity to 
deliver a decisive victory in lowering 
costs for patients. 
In addition to the Finance Com-
mittee package, the HELP Committee 
bill—I serve on the HELP Committee, 
which is chaired by Senator ALEX-
ANDER—incorporated more than 14 bi-
partisan measures to increase price 
competition, including portions of a 
bill that I introduced with Senator TIM 
KAINE, the Biologic Patent Trans-
parency Act, which is intended to pre-
vent drug manufacturers from gaming 
the patent system. 
Patents are important to encourage 
the development of earth-breaking, 
groundbreaking new pharmaceuticals, 
but the system should not be gamed so 
that when the patent is about to ex-
pire, a host of new patents are filed on 
the medication in order to block a 
lower cost generic from coming to mar-
ket. 
In October, the Institute for Clinical 
and Economic Review published its 
first annual report on unjustified price 
increases of prescription drugs in our 
country. It should surprise no one that 
HUMIRA, the poster child for patent 
gaming, led the list. HUMIRA’s price 
increased by nearly 16 percent from 
2017 to 2018, costing American patients 
and insureds an extra $1.86 billion. Why 
do we want to wait any longer, and how 
did HUMIRA do it? It once again put up

this patent thicket—its manufacturer 
did—in order to block the lower price 
biosimilar. 
The Judiciary Committee has ad-
vanced bills that empower the Federal 
Trade Commission to take more ag-
gressive action on drug pricing. This 
year, the FTC charged the infamous 
Martin Shkreli with a scheme to in-
crease the price of the lifesaving drug 
Daraprim by more than 4,000 percent 
overnight, which was the focus of an 
Aging Committee investigation that I 
led with former Senator Claire McCas-
kill in 2016. 
Floor consideration should also allow 
for action on other important prescrip-
tion drug bills, such as legislation that 
Senator JEANNE SHAHEEN and I have 
authored to eliminate incentives that 
create price hikes, distorting the insu-
lin market. Insulin has been around for 
100 years. I realize there is fast-acting 
and slow-acting insulin, but there is no 
excuse for the skyrocketing price of in-
sulin. 
There is another bill that I cospon-
sored, introduced by Senators KLO-
BUCHAR and GRASSLEY, that would end 
pay-for-delay schemes. 
We must come together on prescrip-
tion drug legislation without further 
delay. Three committees have pro-
duced strong bipartisan bills, and we 
should proceed to act and pass this leg-
islation. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Mississippi. 
Mrs. HYDE-SMITH. Mr. President, I 
join my colleagues today in calling on 
this body to include the Prescription 
Drug Pricing Reduction Act of 2020 in 
the next coronavirus relief bill so that 
we can finally address the high cost of 
prescription drugs. 
The troubles caused by skyrocketing 
drug prices are a never-ending source 
of worry and hardship for Mississip-
pians and people across this entire 
country. I hear about this issue from 
constituents more than just about any 
other issue when I go home. I hear this 
all the time. I go to church with people 
who have to decide whether they are 
going to buy their drugs or buy food. 
That is a reality we live with. 
Let me highlight a few stories shared 
with me by some of my constituents. 
Emily Quinn lives in Fulton, MS. Her 
husband, Brian, was diagnosed with 
type 1 diabetes at the age of 2 and con-
tinues to rely on insulin daily. Her son 
Dylan, who is now 16, was diagnosed 
with type 1 diabetes at the age of 6. 
The Quinn family pays more than 
$2,700 each month for just Brian’s and 
Dylan’s insulin, not including other di-
abetic equipment and supplies that 
they have to have. 
It is shocking that more than a cen-
tury—a century, not a decade; a cen-
tury, 100 years—after insulin was dis-
covered, insulin prices continue to rise 
by staggering amounts, nearly 300 per-
cent over the last 10 years. 
Scott Crawford of Jackson, MS, is a 
volunteer advocate for multiple scle-
rosis. Scott was diagnosed with pri-
mary progressive MS in 2002. Only one 
drug, named OCREVUS, can help slow 
the advancement of this disabling dis-
ease. That drug costs a staggering 
$65,000 a year—more than most Mis-
sissippians make. Even with good in-
surance coverage, Scott cannot afford 
the $15,000 copay for OCREVUS, so he 
just goes without. 
MS drugs have seen some of the most 
shocking price increases of all, with 
list prices rising nearly 450 percent 
over the last 10 years. 
Two 
young 
neurologists 
in 
Mis-
sissippi told me about their Medicare 
patients who quickly move into the 
catastrophic phase of Medicare Part D 
early each year. Even though these pa-
tients face only a 5-percent out-of- 
pocket cost for their drugs in this 
phase, 
that 
small 
percentage 
can 
amount to thousands of dollars for the 
expensive neurology drugs these pa-
tients depend on. Because there is cur-
rently no Medicare Part D out-of-pock-
et cap, these patients will get no relief 
from high drug prices later in the year 
when they still have to have them. 
These are just a few of the many sto-
ries that I have received from Mis-
sissippians. I have one of my own as 
well. 
My mother, a Medicare beneficiary 
living in Monticello, MS—Hyde, Lor-
raine—faced 
$454.50—right 
there—in 
out-of-pocket costs for her prescription 
eye drops earlier this year. A tiny bot-
tle of eye drops cost $454.50. The drug, 
RESTASIS, has been on the market 
well over a decade—more than enough 
time for Allergan, the pharmaceutical 
company that developed the drug, to 
recoup its investment. Yet the average 
wholesale price of this drug has in-
creased almost 250 percent in 10 years. 
It was almost unbelievable when my 
mom called me and told me what she 
paid for eye drops. 
This case went all the way to the 
U.S. Supreme Court because Allergan 
had undertaken what I consider one of 
the most blatantly anti-competitive 
schemes in the history of the pharma-
ceutical industry. Fearing competition 
after its RESTASIS patent expired in 
2014, Allergan transferred the patents 
to a Native American Tribe in an at-
tempt to use the Tribe’s sovereign im-
munity to shield Allergan against com-
petition from lower priced generic al-
ternatives. As I said, this case went all 
the way to the Supreme Court in 2018. 
Even though the Supreme Court ulti-
mately ruled this scheme was illegal, 
the company’s underhanded ploy suc-
cessfully delayed competition while it 
continued to reap outrageous benefits 
from RESTASIS, costing the U.S. 
healthcare system over $2 billion per 
year because of their monopoly pricing. 
We want pharmaceutical companies 
to succeed. The great cures and treat-
ments they discover improve the lives 
of many, many Americans. We recog-
nize that fact. But these cures and 
therapeutics can only save lives if the 
patients can afford them. Too many 
Mississippians and individuals across 
this country cannot afford their pre-
scription drugs due to the anti-com-
petitive 
prices 
of 
companies—like 
Allergan—that continue to increase 
their prices year after year. 
Today, the threat of the coronavirus 
pandemic has only increased concerns 
about drug pricing. As new vaccines 
and treatments for COVID–19 are being 
tested and developed, the affordability 
of prescription drugs is more important 
than ever. Just as much as we need a 
vaccine or treatment to be discovered, 
we also need it to be affordable for 
Americans if we are going to get on the 
other side of this pandemic. 
I am proud to be an original cospon-
sor of the Finance Committee chair-
man’s 
comprehensive 
Prescription 
Drug Pricing Reduction Act to bring 
affordability and fairness to the pre-
scription drug market. This bill must 
be an immediate priority for us as lead-
ers if we are serious—if we are seri-
ous—about helping patients afford the 
drugs they need. 
This important legislation would cre-
ate a true out-of-pocket cap for Medi-
care beneficiaries, reinforce the mar-
ket forces that have supported the re-
search and development of so many 
miracle cures, keep pharmaceutical 
companies from price gouging, prevent 
taxpayers from being on the hook for 
unlimited price hacks that have no 
basis in the free market, stop the hurt-
ful tactics of pharmacy benefit man-
agers that hurt patients and commu-
nity pharmacies while enriching the 
middlemen. 
These reforms could reduce out-of- 
pocket spending on prescription drugs 
by $72 billion, reduce premiums by $1 
billion, and save taxpayers $95 billion. 
The Congressional Budget Office an-
ticipates those savings will spill over 
into even more savings in the commer-
cial health market. 
This is a priority that should tran-
scend party politics. Yet Democrats 
who had previously supported Chair-
man GRASSLEY’s reform legislation 
have walked away from the drug pric-
ing negotiation table altogether. They 
would rather deny President Trump a 
victory on this issue than help the mil-
lions of Americans struggling to make 
ends meet due to high drug costs. 
There is no doubt about it: They are 
putting election-year politics ahead of 
making prescription drugs affordable 
for the American people. 
The American people can’t wait. 
Every month they continue to block 
this vital legislation is another month 
of thousands of dollars in insulin ex-
penses for the Quinn family in Fulton, 
MS. Every month delayed is another 
month that Scott Crawford’s MS ad-
vances because he cannot afford his 
medications. Every month is another 
month that those neurologists in Jack-
son will continue to worry about their 
patients on Medicare who face unlim-
ited expenses due to no out-of-pocket 
cap. 
These patients, and millions more 
like them, cannot wait until next year

or until the coronavirus pandemic 
passes or until Democrats decide to put 
the American people over politics. 
Mississippians and Americans need a 
solution now. My friend the Senator 
from Iowa has done the hard work of 
writing a bill over the past 18 months 
that can address the heart of the issue 
and garner bipartisan consensus. I call 
on my colleagues to include the Pre-
scription Drug Pricing Reduction Act 
in the next coronavirus relief package. 
I have been very excited to work on 
this. This is one of the very reasons 
that I came to Washington, DC—to 
help Mississippians. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Arizona. 
Ms. MCSALLY. Mr. President, I want 
to thank Chairman GRASSLEY for his 
tireless leadership on lowering the cost 
of prescription drugs for Americans. I 
am proud to join with him on the floor 
today and join him in his legislation 
that we must pass to help Americans 
and to help Arizonans. 
Everywhere I go—and when I am 
hearing from Arizonans—I am con-
stantly hearing about the rising costs 
of prescription drugs. It is among one 
of their top and most pressing con-
cerns. From seniors who can’t afford 
their medications to parents struggling 
to care for a child who suffers from 
chronic conditions, out-of-pocket drug 
costs are too high. Far too many sen-
iors and hard-working individuals in 
our State either can’t afford both their 
groceries and their medications or they 
have been forced to ration their pre-
scriptions 
because 
of 
skyrocketing 
drug costs. 
In 2017, AARP Arizona reported that 
a whopping 26 percent of our residents 
stopped taking their medications as 
prescribed due to cost. 
Last fall, I heard from a constituent 
in her midsixties from Green Valley, 
AZ, who was diagnosed with rheu-
matoid arthritis and taking several 
medications to treat her condition. 
When she transitioned to Medicare 
Part D from her employer’s health 
plan, her out-of-pocket costs for one of 
the drugs she was taking—Enbrel— 
went from $10 per month to nearly 
$6,000 per month. This is a 600-percent 
increase in her monthly out-of-pocket 
costs just for this drug alone. I don’t 
know anybody who can afford $6,000 a 
month for one drug as a senior—as any-
one. This is insane. She had to switch 
to another medication twice, but be-
cause they were infusions, she now has 
to travel 84 miles round trip to get 
treated. The significant jump in drug 
costs have affected both her pocket-
book even her quality of life. 
This is unacceptable, and I have 
worked with my Senate colleagues on 
both sides of the aisle, with Chairman 
GRASSLEY’s leadership, over the past 
year and a half since I have been in the 
Senate to bring down the costs of drugs 
and help Americans save more of their 
money. 
Senator GRASSLEY’s bill, of which I 
am proud to be an original cosponsor, 
does just that by holding Big Pharma 
companies accountable for exploiting 
loopholes and keeping pricing high for 
seniors, families, and taxpayers. Our 
bill pulls back the curtain on drug pric-
ing and negotiations. It ends the stick-
er shock at the pharmacy counter, and 
it caps out-of-pocket costs for seniors 
so that Arizonans can afford the medi-
cines they need. 
According to the Congressional Budg-
et Office, our Prescription Drug Pric-
ing Reduction Act would save tax-
payers close to $95 billion, reduce out- 
of-pocket spending by $72 billion, and 
reduce premiums by $1 billion. 
This bill is even more important now 
that we are navigating a global pan-
demic and its subsequent economic 
challenges that are squeezing family 
and fixed-income senior budgets even 
more than in normal times. With over 
17 million Americans unemployed—in-
cluding many Arizonans—along with 
the 
ever-looming 
threat 
of 
the 
coronavirus, 
affording 
prescription 
medicine should be the least of their 
concerns. Our bill would give Ameri-
cans and Arizonans one less thing to 
worry about during these extraor-
dinarily difficult and unprecedented 
times. 
Unfortunately, despite this bill re-
ceiving strong bipartisan support until 
just a few months ago, Democrats re-
cently chose to walk away at the direc-
tion of their party’s leadership, and 
they refused to join in on the reintro-
duction of this legislation that they co-
authored. This happens only in DC. 
Just to be clear: They were for it be-
fore they were against it. This is mad-
dening. This is why people all over my 
State are so frustrated with the dys-
function in this place, where people are 
willing to put looking for power and 
electoral politics ahead of what people 
need right now. Right now they need 
relief. They need relief to lower their 
out-of-pocket costs for all of the issues 
that they are facing as seniors, as fam-
ilies—any of the diagnoses, any of the 
conditions. These lifesaving and qual-
ity-of-life-improving 
medicines—we 
have to lower the costs, and now is the 
time to do it. Arizona patients and tax-
payers and families and seniors need 
Washington to act now. 
I want to urge our Democratic col-
leagues to put politics aside. I know it 
is hard to do in an election year, but 
put it aside. Service before self—that is 
one of the core values I learned in the 
Air Force. I bring it here with me 
today. 
Serving others first—that is why you 
are here. Put those politics aside. Let’s 
act to lower the out-of-pocket costs of 
prescription drugs in our upcoming 
coronavirus relief bill. 
This is a pivotal moment for action. 
We have to come together as a Con-
gress to ensure hard-working Ameri-
cans, their families, and seniors can ac-
cess the treatments they need at an af-
fordable cost. 
Let’s pass this bill now. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Rhode Island. 
S. 4049 
Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise, to-
gether with the chairman of the Armed 
Services Committee, to talk about the 
chairman’s plan to conclude the delib-
erations of the legislation before us 
today. 
As you well know from being in the 
committee, this was a process that was 
bipartisan, thoughtful, extremely well- 
orchestrated by the chairman, and we 
accomplished a great deal. As you 
know, the members of the committee— 
we considered literally hundreds of dif-
ferent amendments by the members as 
we marked up the legislation. Then we 
passed the bill out of committee, we 
brought it to the floor, and at that 
point, a total of 880 amendments were 
filed on the legislation—446 Republican 
amendments, 422 Democratic amend-
ments, and 12 joint amendments. So we 
had a rich field to pick from in terms 
of trying to improve the legislation. 
The first substitute that was intro-
duced on the floor to begin formal de-
liberation included a total of 79 amend-
ments—34 Republican amendments, 34 
Democratic amendments, and 11 joint 
amendments. Then we proceeded for-
ward. Last week we came up with an-
other unanimous consent to allow the 
votes that took place this week on sev-
eral very important amendments, but 
in addition to that, we incorporated 
another legislative proposal including 
62 amendments. 
So from the introduction of the bill 
to the floor and to this moment, we 
have adopted 141 amendments. They 
are bipartisan, both Democrats and Re-
publicans. Now we are at the point— 
and the chairman, I believe, has a very 
thoughtful way to conclude the legisla-
tion—to consider another round of 
amendments and then be able to move 
to final passage very quickly. 
Again, let me conclude by saying 
that the chairman has done a remark-
able job. I commend him for his bipar-
tisanship, his thoughtfulness, and his 
consideration, and I am completely 
supportive of his proposal to bring this 
bill to a conclusion. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Oklahoma. 
Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, first of 
all, can I say Senator REED has been 
incredibly great in this whole process. 
We have been working on this for a 
whole year now, and we are now to the 
point where tomorrow we should be 
able to pass it out of—it will not be 
passed at that time. We also have a 
conference we are going to have to be 
faced with and all that, but today and 
tomorrow morning are very important 
to us. 
The point that is made by Senator 
REED—if you add up all the amend-
ments, really, it is you guys in the

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE

July 22, 2020 
the committee, we had over 800 amend-
ments that were part of the bill to 
start with. 
One of the reasons—and I think I 
speak for Senator REED and myself at 
the same time. We have had some expe-
riences in the past where, since the 
Senate operates with unanimous con-
sent, we were unable to have any 
amendments at all on the floor. So in 
order to do that, to make sure—if that 
should happen again, we wanted to 
make sure we had all these amend-
ments already in the bill. So that was 
our starting point. 
Now, here is where we are today. We 
had a great vote on the NDAA, receiv-
ing an 87-to-13 vote in favor of ending 
debate on the substitute. That was 
great. That was today. That means we 
are at kind of the end of this process 
now. We have continued to work on an-
other managers’ package. 
Last night we hotlined—a lot of the 
people who may be watching are not fa-
miliar 
with 
the 
terminology. 
We 
hotlined—we sent out to all the Demo-
crats and all the Republicans for any 
objections they might have—another 
group of amendments. It was a large 
group, an equal number of amendments 
for Democrats and Republicans. It 
came back, and there were a lot of ob-
jections to it, so we have now taken 
that and started on one last managers’ 
package that we are going to be—a 
modified version that we are going to 
hotline tonight. 
It is very important that people are 
listening right now. A lot of times peo-
ple aren’t listening. Certainly, the 
staffs should let their Members know 
that they are going to get a hotline on 
actually 
40 
amendments—20 
Demo-
cratic 
amendments, 
20 
Republican 
amendments—tonight. That is going to 
be the hotline they are going to look 
at. Some of your staff and some of the 
Members may not have read these 
amendments yet. It is likely that is the 
case. If you have objections to amend-
ments in this package—that is what we 
are hotlining—we encourage you to 
lodge those objections with the Cloak-
room. That is when you get these 
things. That is going to be tonight. We 
will note those objections and see what 
remains. 
Tomorrow morning—let’s say all the 
objections have come in. Tomorrow 
morning, at a time—we were hoping 
that time was going to be around 10:30 
tomorrow, but we know a lot of people 
want to talk; a lot of people want to be 
heard. We can’t control that, but we 
will ask for unanimous consent to pass 
the package with a balanced number of 
amendments from both Democrats and 
Republicans. This is tomorrow, hope-
fully at 10:30, but maybe that will not 
work. 
We will require Members who want to 
object to this final package to come 
down to the floor in person and object. 
If you already have an objection to a 
specific amendment in this package 
registered with the Cloakroom, the 
amendment should have been pulled 
from the package. It will not even ap-
pear at that time. Otherwise, you need 
to be here to object in person. 
We use the term ‘‘balanced.’’ This is 
how this works. We have 40 amend-
ments that are going to be hotlined to-
night. If the Republicans have eight of 
them that they object to and the 
Democrats have seven they object to, 
they have to find one more to object to 
so it ends up being eight and eight or 
so that the number will be equal. It 
sounds a little complicated and it 
sounds like something that might not 
work, but it will work. We have been 
doing this now for over a year. Actu-
ally, we started this process 2 years 
ago. So it is going to be the responsi-
bility of the Democrats and the Repub-
licans to make that even so that no 
one can say that it is biased to one 
side. 
So all of that is what is going to hap-
pen, and it is very important that staff 
and Members be aware of that because 
what we don’t want to happen is to 
have someone come along and say they 
were not aware of this process that is 
in place. So that is the process we are 
going to use, and that is one that is 
fair. 
Again, I don’t think—and this will be 
the 60th consecutive year. There has 
never been a year, in my memory, that 
has had more amendments considered 
than we have considered this year. 
With that, I yield the floor.

f 
REINFORCING AMERICAN-MADE 
PRODUCTS ACT OF 2020 
Mr. LEE. Mr. President, when Ameri-
cans see a ‘‘Made in the U.S.A.’’ label 
on a product, it is a source of great 
pride, and justifiably so. It represents 
the 
American 
virtues 
of 
entrepreneurialism 
and 
industrious-
ness. It also alludes to the fact that, as 
Americans, we have a common sense of 
destiny and a common appreciation for 
the inherent dignity and eternal worth 
of the human soul. It is a symbol of 
support for American manufacturing 
jobs, for local communities, and for 
high-quality products. So it often spurs 
American consumers as well as foreign 
consumers to buy a particular prod-
uct—a product lucky enough to have 
that label. 
The Federal Trade Commission cur-
rently enforces a difficult standard for 
all products that want to claim the 
‘‘Made in the U.S.A.’’ label. It requires 
that ‘‘all or virtually all’’ of a product 
be made in the United States, and it 
has issued a lengthy legal guidance 
document—or a series thereof—estab-
lishing rules for who may and may not 
claim that title. 
However, one State holds a different 
standard—one that is nearly impossible 
for businesses to meet. Under Califor-
nia’s law, if more than 5 percent of the 
components of a particular product are 
manufactured 
outside 
the 
United 
States—even if that means just a few 
bolts or a few screws—that product 
cannot lawfully be labeled ‘‘Made in 
the U.S.A.’’ 
Because of the flow of interstate and 
international commerce, in which most 
manufacturers sell wholesale to na-
tional and international distributors 
who 
then 
disperse 
products 
all 
throughout the country, the other 49 
States are forced to comply with this 
one—the 
most 
rigid 
definition—in 
order to avoid costly litigation. 
For many practical purposes, this 
just means they can’t use the label. It 
makes it impracticable as a business 
matter and not feasible as a legal mat-
ter for them to claim that label. Even 
though they could legally boast the 
‘‘Made in the U.S.A.’’ claim in every 
other State in the country, California 
makes it more or less impossible for 
them to do so. In other words, a single 
State is effectively dictating a coun-
try-of-origin label. Think about that 
for a minute. 
If California or any other State in 
the Union, for that matter, would like 
to create a State-of-origin label, I have 
no issue with such a State doing that 
and wouldn’t suggest that the Federal 
Government ought to undo those pa-
rameters. But as it currently stands, 
the 
California 
law 
undermines 
Congress’s rightful authority to regu-
late interstate commerce and need-
lessly hurts American manufacturers. 
This is one of the reasons we are our 
own country. This is one of the reasons 
we fly the Stars and Stripes. It is one 
of the reasons the Constitution came 
into existence to begin with—to give 
Congress the power to regulate com-
merce between the several States with 
foreign 
nations 
and 
with 
Indians 
Tribes. Our previous form of govern-
ment, under the Articles of Confed-
eration, didn’t create a Congress that 
had that power. As a result, in the 
early days following the American Rev-
olution, States were engaging in activi-
ties amounting to economic Balkani-
zation. We saw economic Balkanization 
among and between the States. That is 
why our Founding Fathers gathered in 
that hot, fateful, and sweltering sum-
mer of 1787 in Philadelphia—for this 
very reason. 
The 
Reinforcing 
American-Made 
Products Act would solve this very 
problem. It would simply ensure that 
the FTC has the exclusive authority to 
set the national standard for ‘‘Made in 
the U.S.A.’’ labeling. The legislation 
would provide clarity and consistency, 
helping American companies to avoid 
unnecessary hardships and frivolous 
lawsuits that would otherwise deter 
them from using this coveted and jus-
tifiably enviable label of ‘‘Made in the 
U.S.A.’’ 
Now more than ever, in the midst of 
the economic turmoil associated with 
the global pandemic, we ought to be 
doing all we can to support American 
jobs and to strengthen our local com-
munities. This legislation would help 
us accomplish just that. I urge my col-
leagues to vote in favor of it.

NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZA-
TION 
ACT 
FOR 
FISCAL 
YEAR 
2021—Continued 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Virginia. 
S. 4049 
Mr. KAINE. Mr. President, I rise to-
night to speak about a provision of the 
National Defense Authorization Act 
that would direct the renaming of mili-
tary bases and facilities that are cur-
rently named for those who voluntarily 
fought for the Confederacy during the 
Civil War. 
I thank Senator WARREN for offering 
the amendment, and I particularly 
thank her for making adjustments to 
the amendment to accommodate con-
cerns of colleagues on both sides of the 
aisle. I was proud to cosponsor the re-
vised amendment in committee and 
speak in favor of it today. 
It is important to state clearly what 
this amendment will do. If it passes 
and survives a threatened Presidential 
veto, it will require the Department of 
Defense to initiate a 3-year process to 
change the name of any military base, 
barracks, or other facility named after 
a Confederate military leader. Why 3 
years? The timing is designed to allow 
a full public process in each location so 
that the desires of the community 
leaders can be taken into account in 
choosing new names. 
I state with clarity the substance of 
the amendment because one of my col-
leagues took the floor earlier this 
month to oppose the amendment, and 
he obscured its purpose in describing 
it, only saying that it required that 
‘‘some of the names of our Nation’s 
military bases must be removed.’’ He 
neglected to mention that the amend-
ment specifically sought change only 
to facilities named for Confederates. In 
fact, he did not mention the Confed-
eracy or the Civil War at all. 
If you are unwilling to be plain about 
what is at stake, it portrays a weak-
ness in your position. So let me be 
plain. I speak today because I am a 
Senator from the State with the most 
at stake in this discussion. Three of 
the ten bases whose names must be 
changed under this amendment are in 
Virginia. Virginia was the State whose 
people were most affected by the Civil 
War, and I served as its 70th Governor. 
My hometown of Richmond was the 
capital of the Confederacy, and I served 
as its 76th mayor. I have dealt with 
issues of Civil War names, statues, me-
morials, 
battlefields, 
and 
buildings 
throughout my 26 years in public life. 
Based on decades of grappling with this 
question, I want to describe a principle, 
explain an epiphany, and finally pose a 
question. 
First, a principle: If you declare war 
on the United States, take up arms 
against it, and kill U.S. troops, you 
should not have a U.S. military base 
named after you. 
If you declare war on the United 
States, take up arms against it, and 
kill U.S. troops, you should not have a 
U.S. military base named after you. 
This principle is nowhere stated in 
law because it need not be. It is a basic 
commonsense principle. The principle 
explains why we have no Fort Corn-
wallis, Fort Benedict Arnold, Fort 
Santa Ana, Fort Von Hindenburg, Fort 
Tojo, Fort Ho Chi Minh. 
If you declare war on the United 
States, take up arms against it, and 
kill U.S. troops, you should not have a 
U.S. military base named after you, 
but we make an exception. Ten bases 
and many other military facilities are 
named after Confederate leaders who 
declared war on the United States, 
took up arms against it, and killed 
U.S. troops. Even further, they took 
these actions to destroy the United 
States, to tear our country in half so 
that the seceding Southern States 
could continue to own those of African 
descent as slaves—a species of prop-
erty—rather than treating them as 
equal human beings. Is this worthy of 
honor? Does it justify an exception to 
the sound principle that I describe? 
Why were these 10 bases so named 
when they were constructed in the 
years before and during the First and 
Second World Wars? The names were 
not chosen due to the military skill of 
the Confederate leaders. Some are re-
vered for their prowess, but some are 
reviled. The names were not chosen to 
honor the character of the 10 leaders. 
Some 
are 
respected—excepting 
the 
blight on character that support for 
slavery confers—but others were not

July 22, 2020 
distinguished in their behavior or their 
integrity. The record makes clear that 
the 10 bases were named for Confed-
erate leaders upon their construction 
during the First and Second World 
Wars because of a lingering belief in 
their cause—dividing the Nation to up-
hold slavery and White supremacy. 
In the days of mandated segregation, 
a vibrant Ku Klux Klan, popular cul-
ture painting a false picture of the war 
and its aftermath with films like ‘‘The 
Birth of a Nation’’ and ‘‘Gone with the 
Wind,’’ there was a powerful desire to 
hold up the Confederate cause, to sani-
tize the Confederate cause and deny 
the reality of African-American suf-
fering. That desire even affected this 
very body during those years, as the 
Senate repeatedly used the filibuster to 
block Federal anti-lynching legisla-
tion. 
It is clear now, as it has been clear 
for a very long time, that the cause of 
the Confederacy was not just but mon-
strous. Destroying the Nation to pre-
serve slavery would have been a catas-
trophe. 
History can’t be rewritten, and it is 
important to tell it, but choosing who 
to honor is another matter entirely. I 
repeat a principle that I believe brooks 
no exception: If you declare war on the 
United States, take up arms against it, 
and kill U.S. troops, you should not 
have a U.S. military base named after 
you. 
This wisdom was understood imme-
diately in the aftermath of the Civil 
War by Robert E. Lee. He was asked 
about memorials to the Confederacy 
and stated: ‘‘I think it wiser not to 
keep open the sores of war but to fol-
low the examples of those nations who 
endeavored to obliterate the marks of 
civil strife, to commit to oblivion the 
feelings engendered.’’ This amendment 
is consistent with Lee’s wise observa-
tion. 
Second, let me explain an epiphany 
that I have had just in the last few 
months. When I moved to Virginia to 
get married in 1984, I saw the Confed-
erate statues in Richmond, and I was 
puzzled. As a Kansas-raised civil rights 
lawyer and then later as a local elected 
official in a city that was majority Af-
rican American, I was struck by their 
continued prominence. But together 
with the leadership of my diverse city, 
we viewed these statues and other sym-
bols of the Confederacy as painful sym-
bols of an incomplete past—painful be-
cause of the reality of slavery and dis-
crimination, which have warped our 
Commonwealth and country since 1619, 
and incomplete as well. Where were the 
statues to Richmond heroes from the 
revolution or the civil rights move-
ment? Why did our city highlight 4 
years out of a 250-year history and 
downplay everything else? 
My generation of Richmond leaders 
endeavored to solve this problem by 
painting a more complete picture— 
statues of Arthur Ashe, Abraham Lin-
coln, Maggie Walker, a civil rights me-
morial on our capitol grounds, new mu-
nicipal buildings, courts, schools, many 
named after prominent African Ameri-
cans, women leaders. Aging bridges 
that had been named for Confederate 
generals were eventually replaced and 
named for civil rights heroes. 
In short, we viewed this problem as 
one that could be solved with a path of 
addition—not replacing the painful 
symbols of the past but instead adding 
to our built environment the recogni-
tion of people and eras that had not 
previously been honored. This was nec-
essary and important work. I was 
proud to play my part in it during my 
16 years in local and State service. 
But in recent months, as I spent our 
extended April quarantine in Richmond 
and I talked to people about whether 
Confederate statues on our Monument 
Avenue should be removed, I learned 
something. When I refer to these stat-
ues as symbols of a painful past, again 
and again, I was told: Tim, you might 
see these statues as signifying a pain-
ful past, but we see them as signs of a 
painful present and even predictors of a 
difficult future. 
This sort of stopped me in my tracks. 
I asked my friends to explain. Here is a 
composite of what they told me: If hon-
oring these Confederates were just 
about the past, that would be one 
thing. But these statues are honored in 
the present by a city and State that 
maintain them, spotlight them, empha-
size their beauty, and market their ap-
peal to tourists. In the present, these 
statues become a rallying point for 
neo-Confederates and others who would 
take us back, just as occurred in Char-
lottesville in 2017. 
The present is pretty frightening. Af-
rican Americans are dying of COVID at 
disproportionate rates. The job losses 
in this economic collapse are falling so 
hard 
on 
African-American 
commu-
nities. We see scenes of police violence 
against 
African 
Americans 
playing 
endlessly on our televisions, and we 
don’t see an immediate end to these 
disparities. 
Do you really expect us to believe 
that a society that continues to honor 
those who tried to destroy our country 
to save slavery will be serious about 
ending the racial disparities that exist 
today? You either support the equality 
of all or you don’t. If you honor those 
who opposed our equality—indeed, op-
posed the very notion of our human-
ity—what hope can we have about 
overcoming the real-time injustices 
that are manifest all around us? 
I thank God I can still learn some 
new things at age 62. In my view, the 
statues and base names and the other 
Confederate honorifics that dot the 
American landscape have been about 
the past. But I now see that, for so 
many, they raise deep and troubling 
questions about the present and the fu-
ture. Are we committed to the equality 
of all—the moral North Star an-
nounced by Jefferson in the Declara-
tion of Independence and reconfirmed 
by Lincoln at Gettysburg? If we con-
tinue to honor men who fought to de-
prive those of African descent of their 
equality, we signal that we are not 
committed to our most fundamental 
American value. 
Finally, 
there 
are 
questions 
for 
those, including the President, who at-
tack those who want to remove Confed-
erate names from military bases or 
take down Confederate statues. 
When you saw young Germans in 1989 
spray graffiti on the Berlin Wall and 
knock it down, how did you feel? I 
know how you felt. You felt good to see 
people standing up to leaders and say-
ing: You will no longer divide us. 
When you saw people throughout the 
Soviet bloc pulling down statues of 
Stalin and Lenin after the collapse of 
the Soviet Union or Iraqis pulling down 
statues of Saddam Hussein, how did 
you feel? I know how you felt. You felt 
good to see people standing and saying 
with their actions: We will no longer 
glorify tyrants who oppressed us. 
When you see hundreds of thousands 
of Hongkongers in the streets pro-
testing against the Chinese Govern-
ment, how do you feel? I know how you 
feel because I heard you, even in this 
Chamber. You feel good seeing every-
day people standing up against a gov-
ernment that would deprive them of 
their basic freedom. 
Well, if you feel that way—and I be-
lieve virtually all Americans do—how 
can we feel otherwise about patriotic 
Americans who believe in a nation 
committed to the equality of all when 
they stand up and say: We will not be 
divided. We will not glorify those who 
oppressed us. We will not honor those 
who stood against our freedom. That is 
what our people, especially our young 
people, are saying to us now. Sup-
porting this amendment will show 
them that we are listening. 
In conclusion, we Americans have 
grown as a nation and as a people since 
the Civil War. And we have grown as a 
nation and as a people since the first 
half of the 20th century when, in very 
different circumstances, it was still 
seen as a good idea to honor the Con-
federacy. 
One of the key areas of our growth— 
admittedly a progress of fits and 
starts—has been a greater acceptance 
of others, regardless of race or religion 
or sexual orientation or gender or na-
tionality or physical ability. Thank 
God for that growth. Of course, the evi-
dence all around shows that we still 
have a long way to go to reach full 
equality. It might be like the North 
Star. We can steer by it, but it is not 
in the capacity of mortal mankind to 
reach it. 
But when we do steer by it and step 
in its direction, we become better. 
That is what this amendment will ac-
complish, and it is why I so strongly 
support it. 
I yield the floor.

ator from Iowa.

July 22, 2020 
times, and, right now, folks are work-
ing hard just to make ends meet to put 
food on their table and to care for their 
families and their loved ones. 
As our communities continue to 
grapple with the devastating impacts 
of the coronavirus pandemic, the crisis 
of rising drug costs in the United 
States has only worsened. Now, more 
than ever, folks are operating on very 
thin margins and simply don’t have 
room in their budgets for expensive 
prescriptions. 
No individual should have to make 
the decision between filling a life-
saving prescription and feeding their 
family. The skyrocketing costs of pre-
scription drugs have become a matter 
of life and death for so many. We have 
heard the heartbreaking stories of indi-
viduals who could not afford their insu-
lin, who were forced to ration and skip 
doses, and, as a result, they lost their 
lives. 
I remember quite vividly a conversa-
tion I had with an Iowa mother ex-
plaining how she lost her son who, as a 
young man, was rationing his insulin 
because he could not afford to do more. 
It was a heartbreaking discussion, and 
having that discussion with that moth-
er, I could not help but think then of 
my own brother and sister who have 
been reliant on insulin as juvenile dia-
betics for nearly all of their lives. 
When we talk about the cost of pre-
scription drugs, lives are literally on 
the line. 
Iowans have been very clear with me 
where they stand on this issue. They 
want to see us come together to ad-
vance solutions that drive down those 
drug prices. Seniors, families, and chil-
dren all need to be assured that when 
they go to the pharmacy, they will be 
able to afford their medications and 
not have to skip a meal—or more—to 
do so. 
This is why I was proud to join my 
friend 
and 
my 
colleague, 
Senator 
GRASSLEY, in introducing a piece of 
legislation that I know he has worked 
tirelessly on—the Prescription Drug 
Pricing Reduction Act of 2020. This 
vital piece of legislation would root 
out unfair pricing shenanigans and per-
verse payment incentives that allow 
pharmaceutical companies to take ad-
vantage of the system at the expense of 
taxpayers and patients. 
According to the Congressional Budg-
et Office, this bill would save taxpayers 
$95 billion with a ‘‘b,’’ reduce out-of- 
pocket expenses by $72 billion with a 
‘‘b,’’ and reduce premiums by $1 billion 
with a ‘‘b.’’ 
It needs to be said that Chairman 
GRASSLEY worked for months on end to 
craft this bill in a bipartisan manner 
with his Democratic counterparts. In 
fact, two-thirds of the Senate Finance 
Committee approved our bipartisan 
Prescription Drug Pricing Reduction 
Act a year ago this very month—two- 
thirds of the Senate Finance Com-
mittee. Yet, at a time when Americans 
are struggling to afford rent and gro-
ceries, my colleagues across the aisle 
suddenly chose to drop their support 
for this bipartisan drug pricing reform 
bill that they helped write. 
Let me make that clear. The Demo-
crats helped write the bill with Senator 
GRASSLEY. Those who sat on the Fi-
nance Committee approved this bill 
last year. 
This year, they are refusing to assist 
my senior Senator, CHUCK GRASSLEY, 
in moving forward a bill they helped 
write. That begs the question: What 
changed over the course of one year? 
Do you know what, folks? That is ex-
actly what happened. It was the year: 
2020 is an election year, and that means 
Washington is not focused on solutions; 
it is all about the political scoreboard. 
We have seen it already this year 
with our friends across the aisle block-
ing us from even debating the JUS-
TICE Act, the police reform bill that 
contained about 70 percent of what our 
Democratic colleagues were asking for 
in police reform. 
Iowans put their partisanship aside 
and came together and got a police re-
form package passed; that is, Iowans in 
our State legislature. I wish we could 
say the same for Washington, not only 
on the JUSTICE Act but also this pre-
scription drug pricing bill. Lowering 
prescription drug costs shouldn’t be 
about who gets the credit. It should be 
about working across the aisle to save 
lives, which is the very reason that 
Senator GRASSLEY
worked hand in 
hand with Democrats on this bill. 
Iowans should expect more from 
Washington. They want more, and they 
should get it. 
Chairman 
GRASSLEY, 
President 
Trump, and I will not back down from 
this fight. We will press on and do ev-
erything in our power to provide relief 
to Americans who desperately need it. 
I will continue to call on my Demo-
cratic colleagues to come to the table 
to work on improving our Nation’s 
healthcare system and drive down the 
costs for Americans. Whether it is low-
ering drug costs, expanding childcare 
options for families, ensuring protec-
tions for individuals with preexisting 
conditions, like my sister and my 
brother, or simply making sure that 
children have access to clean diapers— 
simple things. These are all issues that 
Americans want to see Congress take 
action on. 
Just recently, I joined with my col-
league Senator BRAUN of Indiana in in-
troducing a bill that helps address yet 
another critical issue for Americans— 
increasing transparency and lowering 
healthcare costs. 
Our Healthcare PRICE Transparency 
Act would implement the administra-
tion’s rules requiring hospitals and in-
surers to reveal their low, discounted 
prices and negotiated rates to patients 
before 
they 
receive 
medical 
care. 
Iowans should be able to know the 
costs associated with their healthcare 
in advance so they can make the best 
decisions for themselves and for their 
families. 
Folks, let’s not forget that, outside 
the Halls of Congress, Americans are 
facing hard times. They are mourning 
the loss of loved ones who have been 
taken by this virus. They are worried 
about how they will take care of their 
children at home while they work to 
provide. They are concerned for their 
health and the well-being of their loved 
ones. Many of them are considering 
skipping a dose of their medication or 
cutting a pill in half to try to make 
those prescriptions stretch just a little 
bit further until their next paychecks. 
Let’s put aside political interests. 
Let’s work together on this. I will be 
standing at the ready, and it is my sin-
cere hope that my colleagues on both 
sides of the aisle will join me in this ef-
fort. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. GARDNER. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
THE GREAT AMERICAN OUTDOORS ACT 
Mr. GARDNER. Mr. President, 6 
weeks ago, I stood here as the Senate 
prepared to begin deliberating historic 
conservation 
legislation—the 
Great 
American Outdoors Act. I introduced 
this legislation with Senator MANCHIN, 
of West Virginia, along with so many 
other bipartisan champions for the out-
doors and our public lands. Senators 
DAINES, 
PORTMAN, 
WARNER, 
ALEX-
ANDER, KING, CANTWELL, BURR, and 
HEINRICH are just a few of the cham-
pions who helped to shepherd this his-
toric legislation through this Chamber. 
I remarked on that day that it was not 
often the Senate had a chance to make 
history, but, indeed, history we made. 
The Senate came together in an over-
whelmingly 
bipartisan 
fashion 
and 
passed the Great American Outdoors 
Act 73 to 25, and just moments ago, the 
U.S. House of Representatives joined us 
in making history by passing the Great 
American Outdoors Act with a vote of 
310 to 107. 
This legislation is headed today to 
the desk of the President of the United 
States for his signature. The President 
has already supported the bill, noting 
the nature of this historic bill and the 
huge conservation victory that it is. 
In the weeks since Senate passage, I 
have traveled all over the great State 
of Colorado and have visited with land 
management 
officials, 
professionals, 
stakeholders, and constituents to dis-
cuss what the Great American Out-
doors Act will really mean on the 
ground on a personal, local level for 
Colorado and Colorado’s public lands. I 
would like to share some of those sto-
ries with you today. 
Here we have a picture of an amphi-
theater that is outside of the Black 
Canyon of the Gunnison National Park. 
If you would just go a little bit further 
to the right, you would actually be in 
the canyon.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S4402 
July 22, 2020 
This is an amphitheater that was 
built, basically, in the 1960s. The park 
itself is now about 20 years old. It had 
over 430,000 people visit it last year. It 
has a deferred maintenance backlog of 
$7.7 million, and this South Rim Am-
phitheater facility is part of that back-
log. It is currently being used, but it 
needs significant upgrades. If you actu-
ally sat on one of those benches, you 
probably wouldn’t be able to sit any-
where else for quite a long time be-
cause of the splinters and the gouges 
that you would receive from the shards 
of wood that are on those benches, and 
there are electrical outlets that are 
popping up from an old projection sys-
tem. 
This is supposed to be used for edu-
cation and educational opportunities. 
With the right improvements, they will 
be able to restore this and get it back 
to its original purpose. New park 
benches and electrical work are among 
just 
a 
bit 
of 
this 
amphitheater’s 
needs—a $200,000 deferred maintenance 
project alone, this site for education 
for experiential learning. Within the 
rest of the park, there are millions 
more in maintenance projects like this 
one that need to be performed and car-
ried out. 
Our lands are busy. People are loving 
them. This is one example, and it is 
one example of a project that will be 
completed thanks to the Great Amer-
ican Outdoors Act. Yet it is not just 
national parks that have maintenance 
needs. 
Secretary 
of 
Agriculture 
Sonny 
Perdue joined me in Colorado in mid- 
June, and we toured the Mizpah Camp-
ground, which is in the Arapahoe and 
Roosevelt National Forests, that has 
been closed for a decade. This is a beau-
tiful river, and the campground is back 
here. There is only one problem: There 
is no bridge. This river wiped out the 
culvert and the bridge a decade ago. 
This is a campground without access 
because, 10 years ago—a decade ago—a 
flood came through—high water came 
through—and wiped out the access. 
You can’t even use this public facility 
because of a decades-long maintenance 
backlog at this facility alone. 
The Great American Outdoors Act 
will provide line-of-sight funding for 
projects like these, which will no 
longer have to compete for a small pool 
of funding with every other national 
forest in the country. 
When I talk to these professionals— 
when I talk to the forest rangers and 
the park superintendents—they talk 
about how they are able to accomplish 
building structures in their parks, how 
they are able to build campgrounds in 
their parks, and how they are able to 
keep up with restroom facilities, but 
they have had no line-of-sight funding 
for additional help down the road. This 
means that, as the facilities age, they 
may just have to be closed or, in this 
case, as access gets wiped out, you will 
just never regain that access. What a 
loss to the American people that is, but 
what a benefit to the American people 
the Great American Outdoors Act will 
become. 
It is not just the national parks or 
the national forests or the Bureau of 
Land Management that will benefit 
from the Great American Outdoors 
Act. This is a picture of the Runyon 
Sports Complex in Pueblo, CO. This 
area has a number of ballparks from 
little leagues to adult leagues. In fact, 
they just had their first pitch of the 
season last week—a day that I was ac-
tually at the Runyon Sports Complex 
in Pueblo, CO, to kick off a tour-
nament to celebrate the beginning of a 
season that had been much delayed 
thanks to COVID–19. 
This area saw people like Pee Wee 
Reese play baseball and Babe Ruth 
visit this same area to play baseball. 
Now Coloradans of every generation 
are able to go to the Runyon Sports 
Complex and enjoy it. It has become a 
regional draw to help benefit the city 
economically and to teach kids about 
sports and teamwork. That is what this 
means. 
The Land and Water Conservation 
Fund, yes, helps forests and parks, but 
40 percent of the Land and Water Con-
servation Fund’s funding is dedicated 
to projects at the State and local lev-
els. If you grew up on the Front Range 
of Colorado and played baseball, the 
odds are good that you will have spent 
some time on the field at Runyon or at 
any other number of places that have 
been funded by a Land and Water Con-
servation Fund project. Runyon has re-
ceived over $100,000 in LWCF funding 
over the years, and the complex con-
tinues to be a vital part of the commu-
nity today. 
The LWCF is not just about our pub-
lic lands; it is about your local ball-
park, about your local swimming pool, 
about playground facilities, and urban 
parks that otherwise wouldn’t give mi-
nority communities access to recre-
ation. That is what it is about. 
Just up the road from Runyon Field, 
in El Paso County, CO, and the commu-
nities within them, they have benefited 
greatly from the LWCF. We visited a 
project in El Paso County that received 
hundreds of thousands of dollars. It is a 
county that has received $5 million in 
funding over the years and has pro-
vided benefits for everything from 
building parks to tennis courts and 
trails. The State has received over $2 
million in funding to improve the 
Cheyenne Mountain State Park facili-
ties within El Paso County, CO. 
Local, regional, and State outdoor 
recreation projects will only further 
benefit when the Great American Out-
doors Act is signed into law. With the 
Great American Outdoors Act, Con-
gress is finally fulfilling its commit-
ment to fully and permanently fund 
the LWCF, which will benefit every 
State in the Nation. 
The passage of this historic legisla-
tion could not come at a more critical 
time. Our economy has suffered during 
the coronavirus pandemic, and stay-at- 
home orders have kept Americans 
cooped up indoors for the last several 
months. Millions of people and families 
are 
facing 
uncertain 
futures. 
Will 
school return in the fall? Will my busi-
ness survive this challenging time? 
Will I receive my next paycheck? 
When the first waves of the virus hit 
and shutdown orders went into place, 
some of Colorado’s mountain towns 
and rural areas were the hardest and 
first 
hit. 
Community 
restaurants 
closed; 
hotels 
emptied; 
and 
their 
stores’ doors were closed to visitors. 
These are challenging times, no doubt, 
but one glimmer of hope will always be 
our public lands and the great out-
doors. 
This Nation does not have Repub-
lican or Democratic public lands. This 
is not a partisan issue. Preserving and 
taking care of our public lands provides 
a benefit to the entire country, and it 
will provide a benefit for generations 
to come. 
Yet, not only is this legislation about 
preserving and protecting our lands, it 
is also about job creation and economic 
recovery—more hope for the people of 
this country. Passing the Great Amer-
ican Outdoors Act will create over 
100,000 jobs by addressing the park 
maintenance backlog alone. In my 
home State of Colorado, it will create 
thousands of jobs across the State as 
the mission of the Great American 
Outdoors Act is fulfilled. There will be 
more jobs created as the work begins 
to address maintenance projects on 
other Federal lands. The Forest Serv-
ice, the Bureau of Land Management, 
our National Wildlife Refuges, and the 
Bureau of Indian Education’s schools 
all have needs that will be addressed by 
this legislation. These will be impor-
tant opportunities to create jobs when 
the projects are finally and fully fund-
ed. 
I mentioned this statistic quite a bit 
during the consideration of the Great 
American Outdoors Act here in the 
Senate. For every $1 million we spend 
on the Land and Water Conservation 
Fund, it supports between 16 and 30 
jobs. That is a figure above and beyond 
the 100,000 jobs that we created by the 
parks’ provisions of the legislation 
alone. This is a bill that will put people 
to work. It is a bill that will put people 
to work by building playgrounds, fixing 
trails, cleaning up ballparks, and pro-
tecting our iconic landscapes for gen-
erations to come. 
This is a bill that reminds us that 
our communities and our shared, pub-
lic outdoor spaces are worth investing 
in. It is a bill that reminds people that 
we have hope for America. It is a bill 
that reminds people that your public 
lands are waiting for you and that Con-
gress was able to come together, during 
these trying times, in a bipartisan 
fashion that was so strong and so great 
that you will be able to enjoy the great 
American outdoors the way they were 
meant to be enjoyed. 
I am pleased that the House of Rep-
resentatives affirmed all of this by 
passing the Great American Outdoors

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S4403 
July 22, 2020 
Act today with such a strong, bipar-
tisan vote. I thank my colleagues on 
both sides of the aisle and in both 
Chambers for their hard work and dedi-
cation to passing this historic con-
servation legislation. 
I look forward to the President’s 
signing this bill in the days ahead. I 
look forward to getting out into the 
great outdoors, and I look forward to 
these lands as they continue to inspire 
the hopes and dreams of kids and 
adults alike for generations to come. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Tennessee. 
Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, be-
fore the Senator from Colorado leaves 
the floor, I offer to him my congratula-
tions for his inspired leadership of the 
Great American Outdoors Act. 
This is something that good people 
on both sides of the aisle have worked 
on, literally, for as much as a half a 
century. Now, people are used to politi-
cians who exaggerate, but that is no 
exaggeration, because I have been 
around along enough to know and to 
understand that—first, with the Land 
and Water Conservation Fund, which 
was first enacted by Congress in 1964. I 
was the chairman of President Rea-
gan’s Commission on American Out-
doors and reiterated support for that in 
1986. 
Senator 
GARDNER, 
Senator 
DAINES, Senator PORTMAN, Senator 
WARNER, Senator HEINRICH, Senator 
MANCHIN, Senator CANTWELL, and a 
whole parade of Senators on both sides 
of the aisle have worked very hard to 
make this happen. 
And it would not have happened 
without President Trump’s leadership, 
either. We would not have been able to 
spend the money the way that it is 
spent—energy exploration money for 
conservation 
purposes—unless 
the 
President’s Office of Management and 
Budget had approved that. 
So it is usually never true that an 
important piece of legislation is passed 
by a single Senator. It is usually a pa-
rade of Senators. But Senator GARDNER 
has been leading the parade, and I con-
gratulate him for that and salute him 
on behalf of all of us who want to see 
our national parks—the 419 different 
places we have, from the Great Smok-
ies to the Rocky Mountains, to Yellow-
stone, to Pearl Harbor, to the National 
Mall—protected, as well as our na-
tional forests, our national wildlife ref-
uges, as well as the permanent funding 
for the Land and Water Conservation 
Fund. 
So I wanted to have an opportunity 
to say that before he left the floor. 
And I see my friend Senator PORTMAN 
from Ohio here, who really, along with 
Senator WARNER of Virginia, began the 
work on the other part of the bill—the 
bill that would take money from en-
ergy exploration and reduce the na-
tional park backlog by half over 5 
years. That had the support, combined 
with the Land and Water Conservation 
Fund, of more than 800 different out-
door recreation, conservation, and en-
vironmental groups, as well as the 
President. 
People will say: Well, that was easy 
to do with all that support. 
It wasn’t easy to do. If it had been 
easy to do, it would have happened 20 
or 30 years ago. So it took support 
from the Senator from North Dakota 
and leadership from the Senator from 
Ohio and Senator WARNER from Vir-
ginia, especially. 
I came to the floor also to talk about 
something else, but I see the Senator 
from Ohio so I think I will yield the 
floor and then speak on the other sub-
ject after he has a chance to speak, if 
he would like to. 
Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, I 
thank my colleague from Tennessee for 
focusing on the American Great Out-
doors Act. I had come to the floor to 
talk about the COVID–19 legislation we 
are considering, but I am very pleased 
to be here with my colleagues who 
helped to get this legislation across the 
finish line. It is incredibly important 
and truly historic for our national 
parks. 
I have spent more than a dozen years 
on this. It is kind of embarrassing be-
cause I wasn’t very successful for the 
first 11, but from my days as the Direc-
tor of the Office of Management and 
Budget, I have been focused on what 
really is a tragic situation—about a $12 
billion now maintenance backlog in 
our national parks, far more than the 
parks could ever afford to take care of 
based on our annual budgets that we 
provide them from this place and yet 
something that had to be done. 
So it is not very exciting for some 
people to think about, gosh, fixing a 
visitor’s center or making sure a trail 
isn’t eroding into a river, making sure 
that our roads and bridges in our na-
tional parks are kept up to speed, so 
that when you go to a national park 
you can actually use the restroom fa-
cilities and the lodges. But we have had 
a huge problem with finding funding 
for that, and in this legislation, as was 
noted by my colleague from Tennessee, 
who has been at this for many years, as 
well, we are finally doing something to 
help our parks that is badly needed. 
The priority projects—$6.5 billion 
worth—will now be handled by legisla-
tion that passed the House today by a 
310-to-107 vote and passed the Senate a 
few weeks ago. The President has 
agreed to sign it, and it will keep our 
promise, and it is a debt unpaid to our 
parks. Without it, future generations 
wouldn’t have the opportunity to visit 
and enjoy these incredible treasures. 
I spent the last few weeks at a couple 
of our national parks—one, the Charles 
Young home in Ohio, which is a beau-
tiful historic home that is actually a 
station on the Underground Railroad 
and, therefore, has particular and very 
important historic significance for our 
State. Charles Young was the first 
Black colonel in the U.S. Army, the 
first Black superintendent of a na-
tional park, and his home needs to be 
preserved for future generations. And 
yet the maintenance backlog is huge 
there, as you can imagine, and without 
this legislation, they would not be able 
to make progress. 
I got to see specifically what the 
money is going for, which is making 
sure that house still stands years from 
now so that people, particularly young 
people in our community, can under-
stand the history of our country—the 
good and the bad, the cooperation and 
the seeking for freedom that came 
from the Underground Railroad and the 
incredible 
leadership 
that 
Charles 
Young showed as an early African- 
American pioneer, both in the military 
and in our national park system. 
And then I was at the Cuyahoga Val-
ley National Park, where I had the op-
portunity to see the 13th most visited 
park in America and a number of dif-
ferent needs that they have, adding up 
to about $50 million. Their annual 
budget, by the way, is about $11 mil-
lion, and yet they have $50 million 
worth of things that have to be fixed. 
I saw trails literally falling into the 
river. I saw railroad tracks for the 
beautiful scenic railroad that runs 
through there where the tracks have to 
be replaced. I saw a bridge that is truly 
becoming dangerous and has to be 
fixed—an historic bridge. These are 
things that can’t be done with their 
normal budget that funds the rangers 
and some programs. These are capital 
expenses, things that have to have a 
separate funding source, the way we 
budget around here, and we are doing 
that now. 
So after many years of trying dif-
ferent efforts at this and finding some 
success over the years—the Centennial 
Act has helped a little bit and some 
other things to get private-public part-
nership money—we now have the abil-
ity to really say that the parks are 
going to be in good shape for our kids, 
our grandkids, and the future genera-
tions that can enjoy what LAMAR 
ALEXANDER has referred to—I think, 
paraphrasing Ken Burns—as America’s 
best idea. 
With that, I yield back. I would like 
some time in a moment to talk about 
the COVID–19 legislation, but I would 
like to yield now to the Senator from 
Tennessee. 
Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I 
thank the Senator from Ohio for his 
courtesy, as well as his leadership. I 
will not be long. 
(The remarks of Mr. ALEXANDER per-
taining to the introduction of S. 4284 
are printed in today’s RECORD under 
‘‘Statements on Introduced Bills and 
Joint Resolutions.’’) 
Mr. ALEXANDER. I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Ohio. 
CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, the 
legislation that Senator ALEXANDER is 
talking about probably is something 
we ought to look at in connection with 
this legislation that we are likely to 
pass here in the Congress in the next 
week or so regarding the COVID–19 cri-
sis that we face. I am here on the floor

July 22, 2020 
today to talk about that—to talk about 
what the next steps ought to be and 
how we should be responding as Con-
gress to this unprecedented challenge 
we have of the pandemic. 
We are now about 5 months into it, 
and for much of April and certainly in 
the month of May we were seeing pret-
ty good progress on the coronavirus 
pandemic. The situation was improv-
ing, and many of us thought we were 
turning the corner. Unfortunately, as 
we have moved into June and July, we 
are now trending in the wrong direc-
tion in much of the country. Over the 
past week, the number of hospitaliza-
tions, for instance, has risen in many 
of our States, and there is concern that 
the situation could worsen when the 
weather begins to cool. 
Today, in Ohio, our Governor an-
nounced a statewide mask mandate, as 
an example. We have not had that yet. 
He did so because he is concerned about 
some of the numbers. Ohio is not in as 
bad a shape as some of the States, but 
we are not seeing the progress we 
hoped for. 
The past few months have been a 
somewhat better story for the econ-
omy. After the initial shocks of the 
self-imposed economic shutdown this 
past spring, a couple months ago, we 
have seen a steady rebound taking 
place in most parts of the country. New 
unemployment claims, put out just 
last week, while still far too high com-
pared to where we were before this pan-
demic, are the lowest we have seen 
since the crisis began. Recent retail 
sales numbers are about where they 
were a year ago when there was no pan-
demic. So we are seeing better im-
provement in the economy as compared 
to the disappointing progress we were 
making recently on the pandemic. 
Thanks to unprecedented Federal ac-
tion, such as the Paycheck Protection 
Program which has allowed small busi-
nesses to keep their doors open and to 
retain employees, thanks to some of 
the targeted tax relief to help our fami-
lies and also our businesses, we have 
been able to prevent an even more seri-
ous economic collapse that in my view 
would have had a devastating impact 
on all of us. However, we are not out of 
the woods yet. There are still, roughly, 
17 million Americans out of work. That 
is a lot of Americans who have been 
furloughed through no fault of their 
own because businesses are not oper-
ating. This corresponds to about an 11- 
percent unemployment rate, more than 
three times higher than it was just 5 
months ago. 
You will recall that in February we 
had historically low unemployment. 
Now we are up to 11 percent. Of course, 
there are parts of the economy that 
have not seen the progress that other 
parts have. 
So there is a lot for us to consider 
now that Congress is back in session 
and now that we are in the middle of 
negotiating this new what they call the 
phase 5 coronavirus rescue package. 
The new legislation will have a signifi-
cant impact on how we address these 
dual healthcare and economic crises. 
That is why it is important, and more 
important than ever, that we figure 
out how to work together, Republicans 
and Democrats alike, and make some 
smart bipartisan policy decisions. 
Unfortunately, that is not the way 
the House of Representatives has pro-
ceeded to date. The House Democrats 
chose to construct their own proposal. 
It is called the Heroes Act. Rather than 
working constructively across the aisle 
to try to find some common ground to 
help 
Americans 
deal 
with 
this 
healthcare and economic crisis, Demo-
crats chose and made and released an 
1,800-page, $3.5 trillion package that in-
cluded some provisions that have noth-
ing to do with COVID–19. 
How big is $3.5 trillion? Well, that 
makes it the biggest piece of legisla-
tion ever passed by either the House or 
Senate in the history of our country. 
Never have we had legislation that ex-
pensive. Also, $3.5 trillion is just a lot 
of money. The budget last year was $4.5 
trillion—the entire budget for the en-
tire year for our country. This one bill 
is $3.5 trillion. So it is not only the 
most costly legislation ever to pass, 
but, again, it is not just about COVID– 
19. In fact, one Democratic leader 
called it ‘‘a tremendous opportunity to 
fix things to fit our vision,’’ which is 
why it passed by a nearly party-line 
vote. 
If true, by the way, that vision en-
tails raising taxes on some small busi-
nesses; it includes giving out tax 
breaks, largely to benefit very wealthy 
individuals on both coasts; it has direct 
payouts to illegal immigrants; it has 
immigration reforms related to ICE 
and other things; it has unprecedented 
mandates on the States to require 
mail-in voting and telling States, by 
the way, that they are required to have 
certain kinds of ID. This has always 
been within the province of the States 
to run their own election systems. 
That is in this legislation. 
At the same time, out of $3.5 trillion 
and 1,800 pages, there is nothing in it to 
provide liability protection to our 
schools, hospitals, and small busi-
nesses; no funding for the Paycheck 
Protection Program; no assistance for 
Americans trying to get back to work. 
It is $3.5 trillion in taxpayer money 
being appropriated on a party-line 
vote. I don’t think that is what people 
are looking for. I think they want us to 
get together, as we have already with 
four 
previous 
COVID–19 
legislative 
packages, and work together to try to 
get it done. We have to find that com-
mon ground. 
We have to be sure we pass some-
thing that is bipartisan, that supports 
our healthcare system, our schools, our 
local governments, our employers, our 
families, and that we do it in as tar-
geted a way as possible given the fact 
that we have already the largest deficit 
in the history of our country this year, 
and, of course, all this adding to our 
national debt. 
We need to do it based on good data 
on what has been spent and what re-
mains to be done. We need to keep in 
mind what is the most important pol-
icy proposals to include in this legisla-
tion and not make it a catchall. 
First, and most importantly in my 
view, we need to increase funding for 
the healthcare response and the safety 
efforts. This is the underlying problem: 
Until we focus on this pandemic and 
what the virus is doing, we can spend 
all the money we want around here, 
and it is not going to make much of a 
difference. So we have to be sure that 
we are focused on the actual problem. I 
think 
that 
means 
getting 
our 
healthcare professionals the resources 
they need to effectively respond to this 
crisis. They need more funding. We 
need more funding for testing, contact 
tracing, PPE—the personal protective 
gear that, unfortunately, we still don’t 
have the stockpiles here that we need. 
We need to be sure we are doing every-
thing we can do to get this antiviral 
medication up and going. We have one, 
Remdesivir, that is showing positive 
results. We need to make sure that we 
are doing everything we can to get this 
vaccine as fast as possible because with 
a vaccine, as we have with the common 
flu, we will be making tremendous 
progress in pushing back against the 
virus. Stopping the spread of the virus 
has to be our top priority in this next 
bill, as it has been in some of the other 
legislation. 
It is clear from the recent resurgence 
in cases that we are still not where we 
need to be in testing. I know there has 
been a lot of discussion recently about 
testing and whether it is needed or not. 
I will tell you it is critical because we 
need to know where the disease is and 
how it may be spreading. It also gives 
us much greater context in taking 
steps toward reopening in a safe way, 
whether it is our schools or whether it 
is our businesses, going to restaurants, 
going to bowling allies, movie theaters. 
Testing is very important. 
Last week, I was in Columbus, OH, at 
the 
Columbus 
Health 
Department, 
where officials told me what a huge dif-
ference the CARES grant that they re-
ceived has made in being able to ex-
pand testing. They are building a track 
to monitor and maintain the virus in 
Franklin County that is needed right 
now, and they are doing a great job. 
They are providing testing that is 
driveby testing. It is easy to access. If 
you don’t have insurance to pay for it, 
it is covered through CARES funding 
that passed in the Congress. We are 
being sure that the funding is pro-
viding the best information available 
as we fight this invisible enemy. We 
have 
to 
continue 
to 
do 
that 
to 
prioritize bolstering the ability of our 
healthcare officials at home and to be 
able to coordinate the response—State 
level, local and national levels, and 
testing, obviously, is key to that. 
In addition, as more parts of our 
country are putting in place safe plans 
to reopen our economy, we want to

make sure that the individuals who 
went on the COVID–19 unemployment 
lines in the early days of this pandemic 
have the opportunity and the incentive 
to reenter the workforce. We have to be 
sure our workplaces are safe. 
This week, I introduced legislation 
called the healthy workplace tax cred-
it, a credit on payroll taxes to ensure 
employers can afford additional safety 
measures, from the Plexiglas you have 
probably seen in some places, the 
shields to be able to protect people, to 
the PPE that is needed, the gowns in 
some cases, the masks, the gloves, 
hand sanitizer, to be able to afford 
that, and to be sure that there is test-
ing in place so employees and con-
sumers feel safe reentering the econ-
omy. This tax credit will support our 
efforts to make our workplaces healthy 
and safe and to build consumer con-
fidence that all appropriate measures 
are being taken. 
It doesn’t really matter what we say 
as elected officials. It doesn’t matter 
what our Governors are saying or local 
health officials. If people don’t feel safe 
or feel comfortable, they are not going 
to reengage in the economy and step 
forward. I think this kind of a tax cred-
it should be something that both sides 
of the aisle can strongly support, and 
we can ensure that we are doing every-
thing we can to get people back to a 
more normal life. 
As we tackle this healthcare chal-
lenge head-on, we also can’t afford to 
step back on our efforts to combat the 
drug epidemic. Remember the opioid 
crisis that we were facing over the last 
couple of years. It has devastated com-
munities all around our country, in-
cluding my home State of Ohio. Unfor-
tunately, we are seeing, during the 
coronavirus pandemic, the number of 
addictions, overdoses, and overdose 
deaths is growing. This is very con-
cerning, particularly because, thanks 
to a lot of efforts, including efforts in 
this body, to provide more treatment 
and recovery and prevention services, 
we were finally making progress in 
2018. In my State of Ohio we had a 22- 
percent decrease in opioid overdose 
deaths. Every single year for the pre-
vious dozen years we had seen in-
creases, and, finally, we were making 
progress. Now, unfortunately, we seem 
to be backtracking because of the 
COVID–19 crisis. 
People are isolated, and people are 
feeling anxiety. People are not being 
able to access the treatment they used 
to be able to access. So in this legisla-
tion, we should also be sure that we 
make permanent the progress we have 
made recently with coronavirus in pro-
viding 
more 
telehealth 
treatment, 
making that more accessible. I have in-
troduced legislation called the TREAT 
Act that would do just that so we don’t 
lose ground on this other deadly dis-
ease. 
We also need to look forward to the 
fall and ensure that we have funding to 
support the schools so they are able to 
safely reopen their doors to students. 
Keeping our children out of the class-
room for a protracted period of time 
has already had a negative impact on 
many of them with regard to edu-
cational advancement. 
We have heard this from the experts, 
the American Pediatric Society, and 
the pediatricians back home—the doc-
tors who are looking at this situation 
are saying it is very helpful in terms of 
getting kids back to school for edu-
cation but also for their mental health 
and for their social skills. 
On top of that, many parents, of 
course, have been forced to make im-
possible decisions. Do they go to work 
to earn a paycheck or do they stay 
home to take care of their child. So re-
opening the schools will have the effect 
of having childcare, which is very im-
portant. We need to act fast to ensure 
children don’t lose more progress. 
Our phase 5 legislation should pro-
vide funding to help our schools safely 
reopen, whether it is providing addi-
tional masks, gloves or other protec-
tive gear or other resources we have 
talked about, I think that money is 
well spent. 
Second, we have to get the economy 
moving again. To do that, I believe we 
need to remove the disincentive cur-
rently in place; whereby, interestingly, 
we tried to help on unemployment in-
surance, but we provided a flat $600 
payment 
that 
has 
actually 
disincentivized a lot of people from 
going back to work. Why? Because 
most individuals are making more on 
unemployment insurance than at their 
previous job. A University of Chicago 
study says that 60 to 70 percent of 
those who are on unemployment insur-
ance are making more on UI than they 
did when working. 
As part of this negotiation, I believe 
Congress should and will extend the ad-
ditional Federal unemployment insur-
ance benefit in some form, but you 
shouldn’t get paid more not to work. I 
think that is a principle that we all 
agree with, I hope, on both sides of the 
aisle. We should fix this disincentive to 
work by making the benefit a percent-
age of your previous income. 
By the way, a July 13 Yahoo Finance- 
Harris Poll found that 62 percent of 
Americans believed these enhanced UI 
benefits served as a disincentive to 
work. They are right. It doesn’t have to 
be that way. We can help people to en-
sure they get the support they need but 
not have them being paid more than 
they would if they were going to work. 
Depending on how high the Federal 
payment is, by the way, we ought to 
also consider a return-to-work bonus 
for individuals that they receive on top 
of their paycheck—in other words, take 
part of the Federal benefit with them 
back to work. I have been promoting 
this since May. We haven’t been able to 
pass it yet around here, but I think 
this would help people—help those 
workers who do want to go back to 
work to be able to make that tough de-
cision without having a financial dis-
incentive. It would help our small busi-
nesses and others who need the work-
force badly, and it would help our econ-
omy begin to be able to reopen prop-
erly. 
This idea, by the way, has broad sup-
port across the country. That same 
poll I talked about found that 69 per-
cent of respondents support a return- 
to-work bonus. 
There are various ways we can ac-
complish this goal, but I believe it 
would be helpful if it is paired with an 
extension of the unemployment insur-
ance. 
So this is something we have to focus 
on and come up with a bipartisan con-
sensus—a compromise—to ensure that 
we are not paying people more not to 
work but ensure we are taking care of 
people who are furloughed through no 
fault of their own. 
I also think we should be considering 
provisions to help incentivize the hir-
ing from the employer side, so it is also 
providing more of an incentive to bring 
people on board. A way to do this that 
makes a lot of sense to me because it is 
building on legislation we have already 
passed is to expand and repurpose the 
work opportunity tax credit to add a 
category for COVID–19 furloughed indi-
viduals. Also, the employee retention 
tax credit from the CARES Act we 
passed just a short while ago can be 
improved to make it more encom-
passing and a better hiring credit. 
Helping to subsidize the marginal cost 
of a new hire will allow businesses to 
ramp up operations more quickly as 
the economy reopens, while also bring-
ing more individuals off of the unem-
ployment rolls and into the workforce. 
I hope these are part of whatever leg-
islative package we end up with. Again, 
these two should be bipartisan. The 
work opportunity tax credit has always 
been bipartisan. The retention tax 
credit was bipartisan in the CARES 
Act. These are things we can do, and 
they should get done. 
We should be sure to stick with what 
has worked to this point in our 
coronavirus response. One of the big-
gest successes, of course, has been the 
PPP loan program. However, one flaw 
in the original law creating the PPP 
program was that it put in place bar-
riers to loans for those owners who had 
unrelated felony records. 
This was brought to my attention by 
a constituent of mine. His name is 
Troy Parker. He is a person who has 
done everything you would expect and 
you would want someone to do who 
comes off of a felony conviction—a 
mistake that he made. He was given a 
second chance, and he took it. He 
started a small business. It is a clean-
ing business, and he hires a lot of other 
second-chance 
individuals—returning 
citizens. He gives them a chance, an 
opportunity, and he has been success-
ful. But during the coronavirus pan-
demic, he lost a lot of his business, as 
you can imagine, so he applied for a 
PPP loan. He was told he couldn’t get 
one. Why? Because he has a felony 
record. He has a conviction for a finan-
cial crime, and it was within the last 5

years. It was several years ago, but it 
was in the last 5 years, so he couldn’t 
get a PPP loan. Well, he is just the 
kind of individual we would want to 
help. 
Thanks to Troy, we engaged on this 
issue when we learned about it. We 
worked with the Treasury Department. 
We got some immediate relief in terms 
of a rule, but we now have to put that 
into law to provide the relief that is 
needed to provide certainty and to cod-
ify it. The Paycheck Protection Pro-
gram Second Chance Act does that. It 
is bipartisan. Senator CARDIN and I in-
troduced this legislation. It has to be 
part of the next bill because it makes 
so much sense. 
We also need a plan to adapt our 
economy for a future where many indi-
viduals may be living more of their 
lives at home and online. This is easier 
in some urban areas where you have 
access to broadband, but it can be a 
huge hurdle in some other areas, par-
ticularly rural parts of our country, in-
cluding parts of Ohio. 
Think about it. We rely much more 
on telehealth, much more on tele-
learning, and much more on tele-
working. Yet, in many parts of the 
country, there is no access to the kind 
of Wi-Fi, the kind of broadband that 
you need to do so effectively. 
Earlier this month, I introduced bi-
partisan and bicameral legislation to 
accelerate broadband access across the 
country to help our economy. Rural 
America deserves the same level of ac-
cess to broadband, and including this 
legislation in this phase 5 package 
would help them get it faster. 
Third, we need to solve the growing 
problem of State and local govern-
ments running out of funding the 
longer this crisis continues. This has 
affected some critical public safety 
services like EMS, firefighters, and po-
lice departments, leaving more Ameri-
cans vulnerable at the worst possible 
time. 
Ohio is particularly vulnerable be-
cause many of our local governments 
are so reliant on income taxes. In fact, 
the Brookings Institute has determined 
that four of the top five cities of Amer-
ica that will feel the largest fiscal im-
pact are probably cities in Ohio. 
Back in April, Senator BROWN and I 
urged the Treasury to provide more 
flexibility so local governments can 
use the CARES funding that has been 
provided for critical services like po-
lice and fire. While the administra-
tion—thanks to Secretary Mnuchin un-
derstanding and acting on this—did so 
administratively, it now has to be codi-
fied to be sure we have the needed cer-
tainty. 
When I was home the last few weeks, 
I heard a lot about this from our coun-
ty commissioners, our municipalities, 
and our mayors saying: We don’t know 
if we can use these funds this way or 
that way. We have to be sure we have 
some certainty here. We don’t want to 
have to repay this money. 
So this codification will also be very 
important. 
The flexibility, I hope, is something 
that both sides of the aisle can agree 
to. Why shouldn’t we have more flexi-
bility with regard to the CARES fund-
ing? 
By the way, some of it hasn’t been 
spent yet. As an example, in Ohio we 
still have $850 million that is slated to 
go to the local communities, to our 
commissioners, and to our mayors for 
our cities that are under 500,000. Yet we 
don’t have the flexibility and certainty 
we need there. That is important to 
pass as part of this legislation. 
These are just a few policy proposals, 
I believe, that can make an immediate 
and lasting impact in our response to 
the 
challenges 
we 
face 
with 
this 
coronavirus pandemic. I am sure that 
in the coming days, we will be dis-
cussing the next steps forward in-depth 
because I believe we all recognize how 
important it is to get this right and to 
move quickly on it. 
Unemployment, by the way, expires— 
that $600—on July 31, at the end of next 
week. That is a deadline we can’t let 
pass. 
We are facing a momentous test of 
our ability to come together once 
again to address a disease that has 
changed almost every aspect of our 
lives, seemingly overnight. It is our re-
sponsibility to do that. Now is the time 
to put aside partisanship, get away 
from our partisan corners, and work 
together on some of these constructive 
solutions. 
I look forward to working with my 
colleagues on both sides of the aisle— 
my colleague from Washington State, 
my colleagues from North Dakota, and 
my colleagues who I know share my 
concern that we can’t allow this oppor-
tunity to pass. We have to once again 
come together. 
As we said tonight, there are many of 
these things that are bipartisan, where 
there can be a lot of consensus. We 
have to move forward to support our 
healthcare system, our schools, our 
employers, and our families as we work 
to overcome this crisis. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Washington. 
THE GREAT AMERICAN OUTDOORS ACT 
Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I 
come to the floor to talk about the 
NDAA, but before I do, I want to join 
my colleagues and share their great en-
thusiasm tonight out here on the Sen-
ate floor in talking about the Senate- 
crafted bill, the Great American Out-
doors Act, that took a step closer to 
getting to the President’s desk today. 
That is the investment that we believe 
we should be making in open space and 
public lands passed the House of Rep-
resentatives and we hope will be signed 
by the President very shortly. 
This investment, as my colleagues 
were talking about tonight, has been a 
long time in coming on two fronts—ob-
viously, coming from a State that rep-
resents a lot of National Parks and 
areas that need the investment in de-
ferred 
maintenance 
projects—every-
thing from Olympic National Park that 
will get an upgrade for some aging 
water systems to new trails at Mt. 
Rainier, to other projects at Lake Roo-
sevelt and even Fort Vancouver. 
I want to thank all my colleagues, 
Senators GARDNER, MANCHIN, PORTMAN, 
KING, 
BURR, 
WARNER, 
ALEXANDER, 
DAINES, and HEINRICH, who made up the 
coalition who have been working on 
this issue in the more recent days to 
make sure that we got it out of the 
Senate and got it over to the House of 
Representatives. The important thing 
is that it has been a bipartisan coali-
tion of people who believe in public 
lands and open space that has brought 
us to this point. 
The Land and Water Conservation 
Fund was something that Scoop Jack-
son led the charge on in the 1960s, 
based on the fact that he thought 
America was urbanizing and, with our 
highway system, he thought we would 
need open space and, boy, was he right. 
So everything from Gas Works Park in 
downtown Seattle that gives families a 
great view of Lake Union to the im-
pressive things that have been done all 
over the State, being able to say now 
that the Land and Water Conservation 
Fund will receive $900 million perma-
nently means two to three times more 
money than we previously had to make 
investments in open space. 
And we know that investments in 
open space are not only restorative to 
all of us who enjoy the outdoors, 
whether it is hunting or fishing or hik-
ing, but it also is a big juggernaut for 
our economy. That over $800 billion in 
revenue is generated from this indus-
try, and it is an industry that is well 
worth putting more investment in. 
So I thank all my colleagues that 
were here tonight and for their hard 
work. Particularly, I want to thank 
Senator MANCHIN. Senator MANCHIN 
has done an incredible job taking this 
issue as the ranking member of the En-
ergy and Natural Resources Committee 
and understanding how important it 
was to get it over the goal line. 
So I tell the Senator that I am going 
to give him a picture of myself hiking 
in the Dolly Sods in West Virginia as a 
great thank you for his perseverance of 
moving this effort to the final goal 
line. So I just want to thank Senator 
MANCHIN and, obviously, all my col-
leagues. 
S. 4049 
But, Mr. President, I wanted to come 
as we were wrapping up the final de-
bate on the National Defense Author-
ization Act for fiscal year 2021 to talk 
to my colleagues about this bill as it 
moves to conference. 
I want to make sure we continue to 
pay particular attention to one provi-
sion, and that is that the NDAA bill, as 
reported out of the Armed Services 
Committee, I believe included some 
egregious provisions that would effec-
tively wrestle away civilian control of 
spending on our nuclear arsenal and 
give it to the military, a provision that 
would allow the Department of Defense

to raid dollars out of the Department 
of Energy that are literally there spe-
cifically for us to meet our nuclear 
cleanup obligations and also to fund 
R&D at our national laboratories, 
places like the National Renewable En-
ergy Laboratory in Colorado or other 
facilities in my State, like the Pacific 
Northwest National Laboratory. 
Specifically, the committee-reported 
bill would have stripped the Energy 
Secretary’s power over his own budget 
and would have allowed subcabinet of-
ficials on the Nuclear Weapons Council 
to approve the budget for the National 
Nuclear Security Administration. 
So I know the Presiding Officer 
knows this well. But it would have al-
lowed the Pentagon to prioritize mak-
ing nuclear weapons over the critical 
missions of the U.S. Department of En-
ergy. And I believe it also would have 
reduced civilian control over spending 
on our country’s nuclear weapons com-
plex. 
I am so glad that Energy Secretary 
Brouillette wrote to Senator INHOFE 
and talked about this and said: ‘‘These 
provisions eliminate a President’s Cab-
inet Secretary from managing some of 
the most sensitive national security 
programs in the Department, most no-
tably, assuring the viability of the Na-
tion’s nuclear deterrent.’’ 
I do want to thank Senators INHOFE 
and REED for hearing the concerns ex-
pressed by many Senators on both 
sides of the aisle and for hearing the 
concerns of the Secretary of Energy 
and accepting the Manchin-Cantwell 
amendment that stripped these trou-
bling provisions out of the bill because 
I believe it was a radical change that 
did not have enough debate. 
But I certainly appreciate the Pre-
siding Officer’s interest and determina-
tion as well. In particular, I want to 
thank Senator ALEXANDER
and Sen-
ators HEINRICH, CASSIDY, WYDEN, BAR-
RASSO, HIRONO, RISCH, and SANDERS 
who jointly sent a letter to the Senate 
leadership expressing opposition to 
these provisions. 
In a letter that stated, if these provi-
sions would have remained in the bill, 
they would have ‘‘impeded account-
ability and Congressional oversight, as 
well as imperil future funding for other 
critical DOE responsibilities such as 
promoting scientific and technological 
innovation, managing our National 
Laboratories, sponsoring basic research 
in the physical sciences, and ensuring 
cleanup of the nation’s nuclear weap-
ons complex.’’ 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-
sent that that letter, the Cantwell- 
Alexander letter, be printed into the 
RECORD. 
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the 
RECORD, as follows: 
JULY 1, 2020. 
DEAR MAJORITY LEADER MCCONNELL, MI-
NORITY LEADER SCHUMER, CHAIRMAN INHOFE, 
AND RANKING MEMBER REED: As the Senate 
considers the Fiscal Year 2021 National De-
fense Authorization Act (NDAA), we write to 
express our opposition to the inclusion of 
controversial and far reaching provisions 
that would fundamentally alter the Depart-
ment of Energy’s (DOE) responsibilities for 
the nuclear weapons budget. 
As members of the Senate Committee on 
Energy and Natural Resources, we write in 
support of Secretary Brouillette’s June 29, 
2020 letter to Chairman Inhofe and share his 
concerns that provisions in the Senate 
NDAA bill undermine DOE’s ability to meet 
its mission goals and responsibility for main-
taining the viability of the nation’s nuclear 
deterrent. 
As currently written, the Senate NDAA 
bill would strip the Secretary of Energy of 
the ability to manage some of the most sen-
sitive national security programs that ac-
count for almost half of the Department’s 
budget. Such changes could impede account-
ability and Congressional oversight, as well 
as imperil future funding for other critical 
DOE responsibilities such as promoting sci-
entific and technological innovation, man-
aging our National Laboratories, sponsoring 
basic research in the physical sciences, and 
ensuring cleanup of the nation’s nuclear 
weapons complex. 
Sweeping changes impacting civilian con-
trol of our nation’s nuclear weapons pro-
grams should only be made in consultation 
and coordination with the committee of ju-
risdiction in an open and transparent man-
ner. The changes included in the Senate 
NDAA bill have been met with opposition 
from the Trump Administration, former Sec-
retaries of Energy, recent NNSA Administra-
tors, and the Congressional Advisory Panel 
on the Governance of the Nuclear Security 
Enterprise. 
We therefore request that the provisions be 
removed from the pending bill or that the 
Senate be allowed to vote on the relevant 
amendments 
filed 
by 
Ranking 
Member 
Manchin. 
Sincerely, 
Senator Maria Cantwell, Senator Lamar 
Alexander, Senator Martin Heinrich, 
Senator Bill Cassidy, Senator Ron 
Wyden, Senator John Barrasso, Sen-
ator Mazie K. Hirono, Senator Jim 
Risch, Senator Bernie Sanders. 
Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I re-
spectfully ask that the members of this 
year’s NDAA conference committee—I 
am assuming there will be one—that 
they consider all these issues as they 
go to conference. 
This is not just a bureaucratic budg-
et dispute or some interagency ac-
counting measure. This is, I believe, a 
very important issue, as it relates to 
civilian oversight of our nuclear weap-
ons complex and, as written in the 
original bill, would have required the 
Nuclear Weapons Council to set the 
priorities for the NNSA budget and 
would have required the Department of 
Energy to get the Nuclear Weapons 
Council’s approval before it could sub-
mit its Energy budget to OMB. 
So, yes, there was a big takeover of 
the Department of Energy budget 
snuck into the NDAA. Well, let’s just 
say some of us knew about it; some of 
us didn’t know about it. But we ob-
jected, and now, we have taken this 
language out. 
But I am sure this will continue, and 
I think it still continues. I think peo-
ple who have a desire to have a larger 
National Nuclear Security Administra-
tion budget definitely are going to con-
tinue this effort. But people should 
know that the National Nuclear Secu-
rity Administration makes up about 45 
percent of the Department of Energy’s 
budget. 
So, in other words, the Secretary of 
Energy would have lost control over al-
most half of his budget. And it would 
also mean that the Nuclear Weapons 
Council, which is comprised of five 
DOD subcabinet officials and one rep-
resentative of the Department of En-
ergy, that they would have effectively 
been dictating to members of the 
President’s Cabinet what the budget 
should look like. So imagine that the 
Secretary of Energy has to come before 
Congress, and he says, 45 percent of my 
budget has already been determined by 
somebody else, and you really can’t go 
talk to them. 
This isn’t just an issue of trans-
parency. This is also an issue about the 
Department of Energy’s obligations to 
clean up, specifically in Washington at 
Hanford. So I want to make sure people 
understand that nuclear waste cleanup 
is a Federal obligation. It is an obliga-
tion that we have as a nation, not just 
in Washington, but other States, and 
unfortunately, we haven’t met all the 
milestones for nuclear waste cleanup. 
In fact, Idaho experienced this between 
2012 and 2018 when DOE failed to meet 
cleanup milestones at the Idaho Na-
tional Laboratory. 
Taking away DOE’s ability to control 
its own budget would make it harder to 
meet milestones, and now, some want 
more of their budget taken away by 
the NNSA. How are they going to meet 
these milestones? This is probably no-
where more important than in the 
State of Washington. And so the De-
partment of Energy is legally obligated 
to meet these cleanup obligations at 
the Hanford site and to meet the obli-
gations of what is called the Tri-Party 
Agreement, which is a legal contract 
with the State of Washington. 
It is the duty of our Nation to clean 
up what was a national effort in World 
War II and the Cold War. 
So I hope our colleagues won’t forget 
history here, won’t forget the obliga-
tion to clean up those nuclear waste 
sites, and certainly won’t forget this 
effort we had here on the Senate floor. 
Last year, the Department of Energy 
completed a Lifecycle Scope, Schedule, 
and Cost Report for the completion of 
the Hanford cleanup site. It found re-
maining cleanup costs to be $323 billion 
at a best-case scenario and $677 billion 
at a worst-case scenario. 
So that makes cleaning up legacy 
military nuclear waste sites in central 
Washington the second largest long- 
term obligation the Federal Govern-
ment has after Social Security and 
Medicare. So it is no wonder people 
come and try to raid it. 
Trust me, I could be going on all 
night over all the efforts that have 
been going on for decades, where people 
try to come up with a new way of ei-
ther taking that money out of the 
budget or saying that they are going to 
find a quicker way to do cleanup. I am

all for speed, but I am also for meeting 
the obligations. But there is no magic 
here. It is a responsibility, and it is 
science, and it is an investment, and it 
belongs to the whole Nation. And we 
certainly don’t deserve to have people 
coming to the Senate floor with a bill 
trying to take away 45 percent of the 
administration’s budget and then say 
we don’t have to meet that cleanup ob-
ligation because we are investing in 
nuclear weapons instead. 
So, believe me, as this bill moves off 
the Senate floor, I am going to be 
watching the conference. I am not just 
going to watch this issue now or in 
conference. I am going to be keeping 
watch on this issue in a constant fash-
ion, just like I always have on Hanford 
cleanup dollars. But I resent that peo-
ple believe that Congress would fall for 
such a tactic to believe that the efforts 
of nuclear weapons development should 
be controlled by a small subcabinet 
council and that they shouldn’t report 
to the Secretary of Energy on that 
budget, but make up their own budget 
and demand that it be met at the Pres-
idential level. 
Now, I just hope we don’t reach this 
same dilemma again. I hope we have 
learned from it. I hope that people un-
derstand that these priorities of clean-
up of our nuclear waste sites and what 
these parts of the country did for us in 
meeting our obligations in World War 
II and the Cold War. 
We laud those efforts from a sci-
entific perspective. We laud those ef-
forts from the manpower that it took. 
We should now laud a budget that 
keeps the focus on cleanup and gets the 
job done and not lose track or sight be-
cause, from time to time, somebody 
else wants to make a larger investment 
in nuclear weapons. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

The legislative clerk proceeded to

objection, it is so ordered. 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST—AMENDMENT 
NO. 2457 
Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, I rise 
tonight to ask: What does democracy 
look like in America? I have here a pic-
ture of what democracy looks like— 
people showing up presenting their 
opinions with their feet and their 
voices and their signs saying: We want 
change. And the change they want is to 
pursue the important value that public 
safety in America be a value that is ap-
plied equally to all citizens; that every 
single person in the community is 
viewed as a client for the public safety 
team; that the distribution of protec-
tion is equal and the treatment of citi-
zens is equal, so that when public safe-
ty officers respond, they respond equal-
ly no matter what section of the city 
the call comes from; that they respond 
the same no matter the color of a per-
son’s skin; that profiling is a thing of 
the past; that viewing two young Black 
men on the street is not viewed dif-
ferently than viewing two young White 
men on the street. It is that goal of 
having everyone treated fairly that has 
led so many to come out and say: We 
need major reform in our country. We 
need to set behind us the time period 
when departments of public safety tend 
to look at the White community and 
say, ‘‘Those are our clients,’’ and look 
at the Black community or the dark- 
skinned community and say, ‘‘Those 
are the threats.’’ That is what people 
are trying to change by turning out in 
America in this fashion. 
It is an important moment in which 
we 
need 
substantive 
change, 
real 
change—real change like the bill CORY 
BOOKER put together and led the battle 
on, and KAMALA HARRIS put together 
with him in partnership and led the 
battle on. That is the type of change 
we need in America. That is why people 
have been turning out in the streets. 
But there is an unexpected twist on 
something we didn’t anticipate, in 
which the President of the United 
States hasn’t listened to this message 
about coming together so that every-
one is treated equally. Instead, he is 
doubling down on a strategy of racism, 
a strategy of bigotry, a strategy of cre-
ating conflict in America with a deter-
mined new effort. 
This is a picture of protesting in Or-
egon. I was at a demonstration much 
like this, where people chanted: ‘‘This 
is what democracy looks like. This is 
what democracy looks like.’’ 
This is what democracy looks like, 
colleagues—people 
coming 
together 
with their signs and their feet and 
their time, saying: We need change. It 
is as fundamental as free expression 
under the First Amendment. It is as 
fundamental to our Constitution as the 
right to assemble. This is as funda-
mental to the vision of ‘‘We the Peo-
ple’’ as anyone can imagine—that vi-
sion that Lincoln summarized as ‘‘gov-
ernment of the people, by the people, 
for the people,’’ not of, by, and for 
some dictatorial force, not someone 
who wants to consolidate power in an 
imperial Presidency. 
In fact, our Founders were really 
worried about authoritarianism. They 
were really worried about an imperial 
Presidency. 
Once they launched that Constitu-
tion, what would happen with that first 
President? Would that first President 
say: I am now going to consolidate 
power in this young Republic, hold on 
to the Executive, ignore the balance of 
powers between the branches of govern-
ment, and consolidate power in the Ex-
ecutive. I am going to take the forces 
that 
were 
the 
Revolutionary 
War 
forces, and I am going to turn them 
into a force to keep in power regardless 
of the constitutional requirement for 
elections. 
They were very worried about this. 
One of the reasons they particularly 
liked the idea of George Washington 
being the first President is that George 
Washington was very worried about 
that, and the example he set would 
mean a whole lot. 
It is one thing to have a Constitution 
on paper. It is a whole other thing to 
hold onto it, to keep it. Coming out of 
the 
Constitutional 
Convention, 
the 
story goes that someone asked one of 
the convention policymakers: What do 
we have? And he replied: A republic, if 
we can keep it—if we can keep it. 
This is what democracy looks like 
right here. There is another picture of 
what democracy looks like. This is the 
‘‘wall of moms’’ in Portland, OR, com-
ing out, standing side by side, creating 
a barrier between the police and the 
Federal forces that had been allocated 
to the city by President Trump and the 
people, creating that barrier, that 
‘‘wall of moms,’’ to say: Do not use 
flashbang on us or all the people behind 
us; do not use tear gas on us or all the 
people behind us; do not use impact 
munitions, a polite name for, essen-
tially, rubber bullets—they say ‘‘non-
lethal bullets’’—we hope, right, be-
cause sometimes they do enormous 
damage—do not use your batons to 
knock us down and break our bones; do 
not pepper spray us in the face. We are 
the ‘‘wall of moms.’’ 
This is what democracy looks like, 
but this is a message lost on President 
Trump. We have something entirely 
different 
from 
the 
President. 
The 
President said: I am going to send some 
forces out to Portland to basically pour 
gasoline on the fire and turn it into, 
basically, a much more intense con-
flict. 
So you already have the basics of a 
challenge in which you have had folks 
from the White extremists coming in 
camouflage to Portland to create trou-
ble and looking for a fight, and you 
have antifa coming to Portland to look 
for a fight with the White extremists, 
the White nationalists. 
Well, that had calmed down enor-
mously to where there was only a 
small group left, coming in late at 
night and causing trouble. But Trump 
said: If I can recreate conflict in Port-
land, well, I can run a campaign on 
fear. Because what we have seen, in 
Presidential 
campaign 
after 
Presi-
dential campaign, is a Republican can-
didate saying: If we run on fear, we will 
win because people think of us as 
stronger on national security. 
Well, we have seen the different 
strategies. There was the Ebola run-on- 
fear strategy. There was the ‘‘immi-
grants, rapists, and murderers are 
going to run across the border and 
swarm America’’ run-on-fear strategy. 
There was the ‘‘ISIS is going to row 
across the Atlantic and invade Amer-
ica’’ run-on-fear strategy. There was 
the Willie Horton ‘‘you are going to be 
attacked by a dark-skinned person in 
an alley’’ run-on-fear strategy. 
And all too often it has worked, this 
effort to gear up division in America, 
to play on racism in America.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE

But to that strategy of division and 
racism I say: No way. That is too low, 
too wrong for America. We should be 
coming together as a country. We 
should have a message of coming to-
gether as a people. We should be taking 
on the challenges of healthcare and 
housing and education. 
Those are the bills we should have 
here on the floor of the Senate. We 
should be taking on the issue of fair 
labor, good-paying jobs. We should be 
working on rebuilding America’s infra-
structure. 
We should be addressing the fact 
that, even today in States all across 
this country, you can be discriminated 
against for being a member of the 
LGBTQ community. You can get mar-
ried in the morning, and you can pro-
ceed to be thrown out of your apart-
ment. You can be told you cannot eat 
in this restaurant, you cannot sit in 
this movie theater, you cannot receive 
this government benefit. 
The Supreme Court just took one 
step forward on the employment ques-
tion, strengthening the ability to not 
be discriminated against in employ-
ment. 
We passed a bill here in the Senate 
back in 2013 to do exactly that, to 
strengthen protections in employment, 
but the Republican-controlled House 
wouldn’t take it up and treat LGBTQ 
Americans fairly. 
If we were doing our job, we would 
have a debate on the Equality Act that 
would end discrimination in all of 
these areas because it is the right 
thing to do that no door should be 
slammed in the face of an American be-
cause of who they are or whom they 
love. Isn’t that something we should be 
doing here? 
Shouldn’t we be taking on this chal-
lenge of carbon pollution and climate 
chaos? All the fossil fuel companies 
have worked hard to turn this into a 
partisan issue. It didn’t used to be a 
partisan issue. Back when President 
Bush—not yet President but candidate 
Bush ran against candidate Dukakis, it 
was the Republican candidate who ran 
on climate change. It was the Demo-
crat who ran on fossil fuels. 
It is not so long ago, before Citizens 
United, that we had so many climate 
champions on both sides, but then dark 
money was introduced, and the fossil 
fuel community said: This is our 
chance to control the U.S. Senate. 
They put hundreds of millions—not 
thousands, millions—of dollars into the 
Senate campaigns 6 years ago, 2014. 
I remember it well because I was one 
of the folks they were targeting, and I 
saw their strategy of taking that 
money and putting it into third-party 
campaigns and running tremendous 
numbers of assault ads, negative ads, 
attack ads—doing it on social media all 
across the board. 
Since then, what happened? Well, all 
the voices that were on the Republican 
side of the aisle saying ‘‘We need to 
take on climate’’ disappeared. That is 
the corrupting power of Citizens United 
and dark money. 
Then we had a bill here on the floor. 
We needed 60 votes, under our policy 
rules, to be able to pass it to close de-
bate. It was disclosure—to say at least 
we should disclose where money comes 
from. But what happened? The fossil 
fuel lobby said no Republican can dare 
to vote for this bill if you want us to 
keep you in power, and every single 
Member across the aisle followed their 
lead and voted against disclosure. 
They voted for darkness. They voted 
for hiding these massive contributions 
coming in from who knows where be-
cause they are hidden. 
My point is that this is democracy 
here, people expressing their views, and 
here in this Chamber we should have 
democracy as well. 
We had it almost over our entire his-
tory, of people being able to put vir-
tually any issue on the floor and have 
it debated on and then to have it voted 
on and then to have voters know how 
their Senator voted so there was ac-
countability. 
But no more. We are in this incred-
ible period in which there are a record 
number—low—of amendments, and the 
amendments we do have are basically 
not very significant to begin with or 
they are preprogrammed by leadership, 
not by each Senator having power. The 
idea 
of 
100 
Senators 
having 
that 
power—that sounds like something out 
of just another world, yet that was the 
Senate throughout its history until re-
cently. 
Why do I keep emphasizing this? Be-
cause this concentration of power 
where bills and amendments only go 
through the majority leader is an abso-
lute fit with government by and for the 
powerful—the opposite of government 
by and for the people. 
So if someone has a bill that says 
you can’t gouge Americans on drug 
prices, they can’t get that bill to the 
floor because it is blocked by the ma-
jority leader, and the drug companies 
don’t want that bill on the floor, so 
they give a lot of money to that team. 
If someone says we should have rea-
sonable gun safety laws—not violating 
the Second Amendment—and we will 
make the world a little safer for our 
children, well, that bill can’t get on the 
floor because it is blocked by the ma-
jority leader, and it is backed by mas-
sive spending of dark money and the 
NRA. 
Or if we have a bill that says we 
should do a lot more about housing, I 
can’t put that bill on the floor. How 
about we have a banking system that 
serves the cannabis industry so that we 
don’t have huge bags of money opened 
up to the possibility of organized crime 
moving it around the country and 
doing bad things? We should extend 
that coverage, but we can’t get that 
vote on this floor—which brings me to 
something more important than just 
basically anything I have just talked 
about, which is what President Trump 
is doing right now: deploying secret po-
lice across America, secret police here 
in America. 
Now, we know that President Trump 
admires authoritarian leaders. He has 
spoken with admiration about Duterte 
in the Philippines. He seems to be in 
love with Erdogan in Turkey. He loves 
the Crown Prince in Saudi Arabia, who 
assassinated an American-based jour-
nalist. 
He can’t find anything wrong with 
how Putin runs Russia, as basically an 
authoritarian-style dictator. But now 
he is doing something beyond just this 
affection: He is bringing the tactics of 
authoritarian 
governments 
to 
the 
streets of the United States of Amer-
ica. 
This is what democracy looks like, 
but I am going to show you some pic-
tures of what democracy doesn’t look 
like—instead, what authoritarianism 
looks like, what paramilitary forces 
look like. 
So let’s take an exploration of the 
President’s strategy. Well, first, au-
thoritarians don’t want identity about 
the organization on their police uni-
forms, and they want the police, in 
functioning, to look more like warriors 
in some other fight across the sea. 
So you dress them in camouflage. 
Here are folks deployed by President 
Trump in the streets of Portland. What 
agency do these belong to? No shoulder 
patch, no identity on this front, no 
identity on the other shoulder, no iden-
tity on the helmet—no identity. Who 
are these people? 
How about these people? Are these 
the same group here? These are White 
extremists, nationalists, who come to 
Portland to get in fights. So President 
Trump dresses up his Federal forces to 
look like White extremists on the 
streets of Portland. 
How is there accountability if you 
don’t know where they are from? 
Who can tell me if these folks are 
from Customs and Border Protection? 
Are they from the Federal Protective 
Service? Are they U.S. Marshals? How 
do we know? We don’t because they are 
deliberately not marked. 
We are told that these are actually 
Customs and Border Protection. 
I 
called up the head of Customs and Bor-
der Protection, and I said: What is the 
story with this tactic of secret police 
on the streets? He said: Oh, no, no, no; 
we insist they have ‘‘CBP’’ on them. 
We insist they have a unique identifier. 
In fact, he put this in a tweet. He 
told all of America: We don’t do that. 
But America has pictures, and those 
pictures tell us there is no ID. They are 
being deployed as secret operators on 
the streets of Portland. 
That is going to be terrifying because 
you don’t know who they are. Is it just 
someone who wants to create trouble 
who puts ‘‘police’’ on their shirt? Is it 
one of these folks? These folks have 
badges on them that look a little more 
official. We see an American flag here. 
We see an American flag here. 
Are these White extremists coming 
to the streets to beat people up, or are 
they Federal agents? And if so, who are 
they, and what is their mission? We 
found out their mission in short order.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S4410 
July 22, 2020 
Here we have a picture of a Navy vet. 
That Navy vet said he came down to 
say: What does it mean to honor your 
oath—your oath of office, your oath to 
the Constitution? He wants to know. 
He was a veteran who served in our 
forces to defend the Constitution. 
How did President Trump’s secret po-
lice respond? Here is a CBP agent with 
a baton right here, striking him. Here 
is another one with a baton coming 
around to strike him again. Here is an-
other one spraying pepper spray into 
his face. This man, just standing here— 
his hands are basically hooked in his 
pocket, like this—he is just standing 
here saying: I came down here to see 
what people thought about honoring 
their oath to the Constitution. And he 
is attacked. He is attacked by multiple 
members of this secret force Trump 
puts on the streets of our Nation. 
They had not just pepper spray and 
not just batons; they had other weap-
ons, impact munitions—in this case, 
U.S. marshals. 
Here is a young man who is holding a 
boom box over his head—that is what 
it looked like—and he is on one side of 
the street. On the other side of the 
street are the marshals. As he stands 
there in the video, you see him crumble 
and fall to the ground because from 
across the street, he was shot right be-
tween the eyes. Critical condition. 
Fractured skull. 
Who in the world would expect a Fed-
eral officer to shoot a protester, who is 
either holding up a sign or a radio, be-
tween the eyes from across the street? 
Do you think that is accidental? They 
accidentally shot him in the head? It 
wasn’t accidental; it was deliberate. 
They are sending a message. A lot of 
other people got shot with these muni-
tions. I am told that he is no longer in 
critical condition. Thank goodness for 
that, but it could have been very, very 
different. We still don’t know the ulti-
mate outcome of this assault on a 
peaceful protester. 
Pepper spray, using batons on vet-
erans, shooting a peaceful protester in 
the head from a few yards away—that 
is not all that Trump’s secret police 
were up to. They decided to go through 
the streets and grab people and throw 
them into unmarked vans. 
Here is one of those vans on the 
streets of Portland. Here are President 
Trump’s 
secret 
police, 
unmarked, 
throwing another protester into a van. 
One of the individuals who was treat-
ed in this fashion said he was terrified 
because he thought these camouflaged 
folks were the White extremists who 
come to make trouble, and was he 
being kidnapped? They would not an-
swer the question when they were 
asked ‘‘Who are you?’’ They didn’t an-
swer the question. 
Secret police, unmarked, using pep-
per spray, batons, impact munitions, 
and tear gas on peaceful protesters, 
and then throwing people—grabbing 
them and throwing them into un-
marked vans. What does that make you 
think of? What country are we talking 
about here? Are we talking about 
Syria? Are we talking about Duterte in 
the Philippines? Are we talking about 
Erdogan in Turkey? Are we talking 
about the Crown Prince in Saudi Ara-
bia? Are we talking about Putin run-
ning Russia? We could be talking about 
any of those folks, as they use these 
tactics, but this is unacceptable and 
outrageous and unconstitutional in a 
democratic republic. 
President Trump coordinated this de-
ployment of secret police and attacks 
on peaceful protesters to create a big 
conflagration, a big explosion of pro-
tests in Portland. The protests had 
died down to just less than 100 actors 
and 
some 
bystanders 
in 
the 
late 
evening, and then I am told that on the 
days that followed these outrageous at-
tacks, 
the 
protests 
multiplied—not 
one- or twofold but fivefold or more. 
That is exactly what Trump wanted be-
cause he wanted to say: There is this 
dissent and trouble in the streets of 
Portland. I am your law-and-order 
President; I will take care of that trou-
ble. 
You create the trouble. You escalate 
the conflict so you can say ‘‘I am the 
one who can deescalate it’’ later. This 
is a horrific strategy that no Member 
of this Senate should have the slightest 
sympathy for—a strongman in the Oval 
Office adopting the secret police tac-
tics of the worst dictators from around 
the globe. 
Some of the headlines that followed 
were things like this: 
‘‘Federal Law Enforcement Use Un-
marked Vehicles To Grab Protesters 
Off Portland Streets.’’ 
‘‘A Navy vet asked federal officers in 
Portland to remember their [constitu-
tional] oaths. Then they broke his 
hand.’’ You saw the pictures of them 
striking him with the batons. 
‘‘Federal Officers Deployed in Port-
land Didn’t Have Proper Training, 
D.H.S. memo said.’’ It says: Untrained, 
undisciplined folks, but they knew 
what the President wanted and that 
was to create an escalation of violence 
on the streets of our city. 
You are probably wondering, didn’t 
the President call and talk to the Gov-
ernor before he decided to deploy these 
secret police on the streets of Port-
land? No, he didn’t. Didn’t the DHS 
Secretary? No. How about the Depart-
ment of Justice? The Attorney Gen-
eral? No. Surely they called the mayor 
and said: Before we deploy folks to pa-
trol the streets with tear gas and ba-
tons and impact bullets, rubber bullets, 
pepper spray; before we beat up peace-
ful protesters and shoot them in the 
head, we want to talk to you, Mayor, 
about what is going on. Did the Presi-
dent call? Did the Secretary call, the 
Secretary of Homeland Security? Did 
the Secretary or the Attorney General 
call? Did the head of Customs and Bor-
der Protection, CBP, call before they 
sent in their special operating group? 
Did the Marshals’ lead director, com-
missioner call? The answer is no, no, 
no, no, and no. None of them called be-
cause they weren’t coming to coordi-
nate, to help; they were coming to dis-
rupt. They knew that if they asked to 
come, asked whether they were want-
ed, the answer would be no, you are not 
wanted because you are coming to in-
flame the violence and disruption. 
The President was giving speeches, 
saying ‘‘Look at what a wonderful 
President I am because I am sending 
help to quell violence in Portland’’ 
while he was sending secret police to 
create violence. This has to be one of 
the bigger lies he has told in his time 
as President. By various accounts, he 
tells a number of them every single 
day. But this lie to the American peo-
ple is not just a little white lie; this is 
not just a little misrepresentation; this 
is something of constitutional input 
about who we are as a country. We 
don’t do secret police in our country. 
We don’t grab people off the streets and 
terrify them and throw them in un-
marked vans in our country—at least 
not until now. 
You see, the President has looked at 
the polls that say we are not very 
happy. Americans are not very happy 
with the way you have executed the 
Presidency. We are certainly not very 
happy with the way you have managed 
this really big crisis, the COVID–19 
pandemic. When there is a crisis, you 
start to see someone—can they rise to 
the occasion? Can they bring forth the 
best in people? Can they facilitate co-
operation? 
Can 
they 
mobilize 
re-
sources? Can they make the case in an 
effective and persuasive fashion? 
The American people have seen that 
President Trump could not rise to the 
occasion. He could not bring himself to 
bring people together. He could not 
make the case for a national strategy 
on how to tackle the coronavirus. He 
could not mobilize resources to address 
it in a timely fashion. Millions more 
are going to get sick as a result of his 
incompetence, and tens of thousands 
more will die because of the incom-
petence of President Trump. 
What is a President running for re-
election to do when his incompetence 
is revealed in its complete and total 
clarity to the Nation? You create a 
war. That is what you do. You create a 
war because a war might rally people 
to your side when we are being at-
tacked. But in this case, the President 
couldn’t come up with an overseas war. 
ISIS? Too weak. The scary Ebola? Too 
long ago. North Korea? A completely 
failed strategy by the President of ex-
pressing his love for yet another dic-
tator and that love not being returned 
in any effective policy changes. So 
what is left? Immigration. Oh, wait—he 
already played the rapist and mur-
derers at the border card. He already 
offended people throughout our Nation 
by snuffing out the lamp of Lady Lib-
erty. What is left? You have to create 
a war inside the United States. 
First came Washington, DC. He tried 
out the secret police strategy by de-
ploying forces onto the steps of the 
Lincoln Memorial, unmarked, and no-
body knew who the hell they were. Who

are these people who are on the Lin-
coln Memorial? Are they far-right ex-
tremists carrying guns? Are they Cus-
toms and Border Protection? Are they 
U.S. Marshals? Who are these people? 
Nobody knew. They were secret police 
at the Lincoln Monument. 
And then he decided to test the strat-
egy of using weapons against peaceful 
protesters 
across 
from 
the 
White 
House. There they are gathered to-
gether. There is this great tradition in 
America. If you want to protest where 
the President can see you, you go to 
L’Enfant Plaza and you look up at the 
second story and you hold up your pro-
test sign and you scream your position 
on something that you consider very 
important for America—the change 
you want to see or the man you object 
to. The President and his family look 
out those windows and say: I sure hate 
seeing those protesters. 
But that is symbolic of the right to 
assemble and the freedom of speech in 
our beautiful Nation under our extraor-
dinary Constitution. What did Presi-
dent Trump do? Well, he walled off 
L’Enfant Plaza across from the White 
House so people couldn’t protest there. 
That is what this President thinks of 
protesters. He sees them as a threat to 
him. He doesn’t like freedom of assem-
bly, and he doesn’t like freedom of 
speech, but what he does like is a good 
photo opportunity. 
So the President decides to get the 
team together and we will go over and 
I will stand on the steps of the church 
and hold up a Bible. I still am a little 
confounded about what his message 
was to do that. The thing is, to get to 
the steps of the church, he would have 
to come near these protesters he hates 
because he hates protesters. He doesn’t 
like Americans calling for change or 
criticizing his policies. 
I am thinking back about this ‘‘wall 
of moms’’ that I showed you earlier— 
these moms coming down, forming a 
line, and saying: Don’t tear gas us. 
Don’t do shock grenades. Don’t shoot 
us with rubber bullets. Don’t pepper 
spray us. 
And yet his forces did all those 
things. 
Where did he try this out first? He 
tried it in that area behind L’Enfant 
Plaza where the church steps were. His 
forces went out and attacked those 
protesters. Nobody saw violence of any 
kind. This had nothing to do with 
quelling a riot. This had to do with one 
simple thing: The President hates pro-
tests and wanted to show what a strong 
man he is, like those dictators he ad-
mires all across the planet—like the 
Crown Prince in Saudi Arabia, like 
Duterte with his extrajudicial execu-
tions in the Philippines, like Putin, 
whom he just can’t say enough good 
things about who suppresses the civil 
rights of the Russian people. He wanted 
to show how strong he was so he sent 
his team out to tear gas, use impact 
munitions, rubber bullets on the pro-
testers so he could stand at the church 
with a Bible. 
I am still wondering what passage in 
the Bible he was there to talk about. 
You can think for yourselves. You can 
imagine. You can ask yourselves: What 
did the President want to say with the 
Good Book in his hand? Did he want to 
say this book talks about turning the 
other cheek, and I will show how much 
I admire that principle of turning the 
other cheek by coming out and telling 
my team to tear gas and shoot peaceful 
protesters? Is that what the President 
wanted to do, kind of somehow dem-
onstrate support for turning the other 
cheek by having his team gas and 
shoot people in that area close to 
L’Enfant Plaza, close to the steps of 
the church, or did the President want 
to come out and say: This Good Book 
talks about beating swords into plow-
shares, and I want to come out and 
show just how I believe in the principle 
of beating swords into plowshares by 
having my team gas people and baton 
people and do these explosive flashbang 
grenades. Is that what the President 
was trying to do? 
What message in the Bible was he 
trying to convey? Was he trying to 
convey the message that Jesus Christ 
talked about time and time and time 
again of helping the poor and the des-
titute, and he thought it was such an 
important message to carry to the 
United States that he would use force, 
tear gas, rubber bullets to clear the 
path so he could talk about how impor-
tant it was to help the destitute and 
the poor in America and how his poli-
cies might help them? No. We don’t 
know. I don’t think the President 
knew. He has never indicated that he is 
actually familiar with the contents of 
that book he was holding up, which 
makes it a particularly bizarre photo 
op. 
But this was his first trial run of this 
strategy of using weapons against 
peaceful protesters, of using unmarked 
uniforms on the steps of the Lincoln 
Memorial. He loved it so much. He 
loved that sense that he was so strong 
because he could clear the path with 
his Presidential team so he could get 
to those steps. He was such an awesome 
man, such an incredible President 
showing strength by attacking peaceful 
protesters so he could have his photo 
on. It filled him with such energy, he 
thought: Let’s try this out elsewhere in 
the country—so he comes to Portland. 
He comes to Portland, and he pro-
ceeds to say: Let’s use that secret po-
lice strategy again, unmarked. Let’s 
use those batons and pepper spray 
again against a peaceful protester. 
Let’s use those impact munitions again 
against someone holding up a sign, 
shooting them from across the street, 
giving them a fractured skull and put-
ting them in critical condition and into 
the hospital. Let’s take it and even am-
plify it a little bit and put them into 
unmarked vans and sweep them away. 
This is what we have with the Trump 
secret police strategy. 
As he did these things, he went out 
on the campaign stump and said: Look 
what a mighty leader I am attacking 
these peaceful people with these weap-
ons. I did it to the protesters in Wash-
ington, DC, and I did it to the pro-
testers in Portland, OR, and now I am 
going to take my strategy of attacking 
protesters and spread it all across 
America. 
What does he talk about? He says: I 
want to take this strategy to Balti-
more. He says: I want to take this 
strategy to Philadelphia. He says: I 
want to take this strategy to New 
York. And then he said: I want to take 
it to Chicago and I want to take it to 
Detroit and I want to take it to Oak-
land, CA. What do those things have in 
common? And then he says: They are 
led by Democrats. I will take my strat-
egy of inciting violence with secret po-
lice, unmarked van abductions, use of 
pepper spray, batons, and flashbangs— 
the whole arsenal—and I will take it to 
all these cities where there are Demo-
cratic mayors. Then I will say: Look at 
me. I am a law-and-order President, 
and I can quell all that trouble I cre-
ated across this country. 
You are probably thinking I made up 
this list of cities that the President 
talked about. Surely, the President 
wouldn’t take this incredibly horren-
dous secret police strategy and express 
that he wanted to take it on a trial run 
all across America so he could create 
violence in Democratic cities, but in 
his own words: 
Who’s next? New York and Chicago and 
Philadelphia and Detroit and Baltimore and 
all of these—Oakland is a mess. 
And he framed it as going to quell vi-
olence, but, instead, the strategy pro-
duces violence. It enflames. It accen-
tuates. It outrages. It creates conflict. 
I have here an article, and it is from 
FOX 32 News in Chicago: ‘‘Lightfoot 
confirms federal agents will help man-
age Chicago violence.’’ Chicago has a 
Democratic mayor. Let’s go create 
trouble there. 
Mayor Lori Lightfoot had a different tone 
Tuesday 
regarding 
President 
Donald 
Trump’s decision to send agents to Chicago. 
‘‘I’m hopeful that they will not be foolish 
enough to bring that kind of nonsense to 
Chicago,’’ the mayor said. 
Well, what did she mean by ‘‘non-
sense’’? It is the polite word for attack-
ing peaceful protesters with batons and 
flashbangs and tear gas. 
I am certainly not saying that Port-
land didn’t have some tensions. The ex-
tremist groups on the right have made 
a favorite trip out of coming to Port-
land to cause trouble and the anti-fas-
cists have responded in kind, and that 
is what the local team has to manage 
and deescalate. They have succeeded in 
deescalating it to where it was a small 
group late at night. And then Trump 
came in and blew it all into a big crisis 
once again. 
When I said that this is coordinated 
with his campaign, campaign ads went 
up. His strategy of creating chaos in 
America, 
then 
campaigning 
on 
it 
couldn’t be more transparent.

July 22, 2020 
dispatch to other cities, his re-election cam-
paign is spending millions of dollars on omi-
nous television ads that promote fear. . . . 
The influx of agents in Portland has led to 
scenes of confrontations and chaos that Mr. 
Trump and his aides have pointed to as they 
try to burnish a false narrative about Demo-
cratic elected officials allowing dangerous 
protesters to create widespread bedlam. 
The Trump campaign is driving home that 
message with a new ad that tries to tie its 
dark portrayal of Democratic-led cities. 
There it is—campaign ads to fit his 
dark portrayal of Democratic-led cit-
ies. 
The idea that not only would the 
President bring those secret police tac-
tics to America—to our streets—he 
would deploy them in his effort to cre-
ate conflict so he can win reelection, so 
he can have something that scares the 
American 
people. 
Don’t 
we 
have 
enough to be worried about already? 
Don’t we have a pandemic to manage? 
A number of us worked to say: Mr. 
President, you need to have a national 
strategy on producing protective equip-
ment to help stop the spread of this 
contagion. Mr. President, that should 
probably include taking available fac-
tories and putting them to work mak-
ing protective equipment and distrib-
uting it quickly. The President said, 
no, he’s not doing it. He is not acti-
vating the Defense Production Act to 
have a national strategy to stop the 
spread of this disease. 
I have two healthcare workers in my 
family. My son works in a doctor’s of-
fice recording the computer code on 
the symptoms and so forth. He is a 
medical scribe. My wife goes house to 
house visiting folks who are in hospice. 
They are in the final chapter of their 
life, and she coaches them and their 
family on care and support during this 
final chapter of our journey here on 
this planet. A number of the people she 
sees are very high risk because they 
are fragile and sick in that final chap-
ter, so they would be very affected if 
this disease were introduced. Some of 
them have the disease. 
She has to be very careful that she 
doesn’t pick it up and bring it home to 
my elderly mother who lives in our 
house. My elderly mother is in her 
nineties. She probably wouldn’t want 
me to call her elderly in her nineties, 
but she is fragile, and she would be af-
fected. My son doesn’t want to bring it 
home or spread it. Both of them had 
trouble getting the protective equip-
ment they needed early in this pan-
demic because we didn’t have a na-
tional strategy. Trump failed the lead-
ership test. 
How about another critical piece of 
this, which is testing? 
We needed to crank up all of the bio-
logical 
manufacturing 
capacity 
of 
America to produce the reagents so 
that people could be tested and get the 
results within hours or a day so that, if 
they were infected, even if they were 
asymptomatic—they didn’t have the 
disease symptoms, but they had the 
disease, and they could spread it—that 
they would be quarantined, but the 
President said no. 
So we put into the bill a requirement 
for the President to produce a national 
test strategy and produce a report with 
his test strategy. What did it read? It 
read our test strategy—our national 
strategy—was to leave it to the States. 
What kind of leadership is that to have 
no strategy on producing the reagents 
or the tests and getting them around 
the country? 
One thing we have done here is we 
have funded a lot of money to help 
communities buy tests because they 
are expensive. We said they should be 
free to the victims—to the people who 
are getting tested, that is. Every 
health expert has said you have to 
crank up this testing so that there is 
no wait time. It doesn’t help to get the 
results 7 or 10 days later. 
I have been holding townhalls. I hold 
one in every county every year in Or-
egon, 36 counties. This year, I only got 
21 in before the coronavirus made it 
impossible to hold them in person, but 
I have been holding them digitally, 
electronically. I keep hearing the re-
port from the county health agents 
that now testing has increased to its 
taking 7 days to get a response, 9 days 
to get a response, 11 days to get a re-
sponse. Why is that? It is because we 
didn’t have any national strategy for 
producing tests. As the disease flares 
up and grows in magnitude in the 
Southern States, more and more re-
sources are getting diverted to those 
Southern States. So there are not the 
testing supplies because there is no na-
tional strategy. 
Then the experts said: Well, you 
should have a contact tracing strategy, 
so, when people test positive, you can 
immediately find out who they have 
been in touch with so those people get 
immediately quarantined before they 
can pass it on to other people. 
Yet that doesn’t work if you can’t 
get test results quickly, and it doesn’t 
work if you don’t have contact tracers. 
A number of us have worked to provide 
funding for contact tracers. ELIZABETH 
WARREN and I have introduced a bill 
that calls for 100,000 contact tracers 
across this country. There is $75 billion 
in the House’s bill for testing and trac-
ing across the country. 
How did President Trump respond 
this last week? President Trump said: I 
don’t want any money for testing in 
this bill—no money for testing. He 
wants this stripped out; yet it is an es-
sential element for controlling the 
coronavirus. 
I don’t think he will win on that one. 
I think the Members of this Chamber, 
on both sides of the aisle, care enough 
about their constituents that they 
want to help with testing and contact 
tracing, but the President wants the 
testing stripped out. 
Why does he want it stripped out? It 
is because, if you test more people, 
then you get more positives, and if you 
get more positives, it doesn’t look 
good. So he is choosing to have things 
look good rather than to contain the 
coronavirus. 
If you proceed to offend people across 
the country by failing in leadership on 
protective equipment and failing in 
leadership on testing and failing in 
leadership on contact tracing, you need 
another plan, and we have the plan. 
The President has made it clear he 
will test out his secret police and at-
tacks on peaceful protesters in DC, 
magnify that experiment in Portland, 
and see if it creates more chaos. If it 
does, he will deploy that effort across 
the Nation. That is President Trump’s 
plan, and it is as wrong as anything 
could be. Secret policing has no place 
in the United States of America. 
I introduced a simple amendment to 
the Defense Authorization Act, which 
deals with security powers and things 
like Customs and Border Protection 
and deals with things like U.S. Mar-
shals, and I said we are on that right 
now on the floor of the Senate. Let’s 
have this debate about secret policing, 
and let’s just ask a few simple things. 
First, 
when 
the 
President 
sends 
agents anywhere in the country, they 
have to carry identification about who 
they work for. It is not that big of a re-
quest, and it is not expensive. Instead 
of putting a generic ‘‘police’’ or no 
marking at all, you put ‘‘CBP,’’ or you 
put ‘‘U.S. Marshals,’’ or you put ‘‘Fed-
eral Protective Service’’ or one of a 
dozen other Federal police units that 
play different roles. That way, the 
American people will know who they 
are. Then you put unique identifiers on 
them so that, if they do something ter-
rible, like walk up and shoot a pro-
tester in the head, you would know 
who had done it. You could find out. 
Now, some of my friends have said: 
Well, we are not sure we want to re-
quire names to be on the uniforms be-
cause there have been some cases in 
which people have been so outraged 
that they have harassed the families of 
the police officers or of these Federal 
agents. We don’t want that. OK. A 
number would work that could be used 
to identify someone after an egregious 
act but would protect the families of 
our Federal agents who are doing a 
good job. That is pretty simple. Have 
an ID as to what agency you belong to 
and a unique identifier. You are no 
longer secret. 
Then you can’t be deployed on some 
expanded 
mission 
of 
sweeping 
the 
streets. Your legitimate mission should 
be to protect a Federal monument or a 
Federal building, and you have to be at 
that Federal building or in the near vi-
cinity of it or of the monument. That 
is pretty simple. If you want a broader 
mission, you have to coordinate with 
the mayor and the Governor and get 
their permission. 
It is pretty straightforward. Have a 
patch with the agency, a unique identi-
fier, and pursue your mission in the 
near vicinity of the Federal property. 
What else? 
The President would have to tell the 
people of America how many people he 
is sending, from what agencies, and to 
what city for a little bit of trans-
parency. That is it.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S4413 
July 22, 2020 
This amendment that I am proposing 
to stop secret policing is simple; yet 
my colleagues are blocking it from 
being considered in this bill. 
I yield the floor. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
GARDNER). The Senator from Oregon. 
Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, in a 
moment, I will again ask for this im-
portant issue of deployment of secret 
police to be debated and voted on, on 
this floor. That is what the U.S. Senate 
is for, to address the issues facing 
Americans, but I didn’t want to ask 
until my colleague was here to respond 
from the Republican Caucus. When he 
is ready, I will make that motion. 
I make this motion to send a couple 
of different messages. One, most impor-
tantly, is that secret policing has no 
place in America, and all Americans 
must stand arm in arm and say no. The 
second is, when there is an important 
issue like this, this is the Chamber in 
which it should be debated and voted 
on so we can hear the conflicting 
views. 
There may be clauses in the amend-
ment that I will propose that people 
won’t like, insight that they can pro-
vide, or modifications that they would 
like to propose to my amendment, but 
it can’t happen unless this amendment 
is considered on the floor. 
That is why, notwithstanding rule 
XXII, I ask unanimous consent to call 
up my amendment to stop secret polic-
ing in America, amendment No. 2457, 
an amendment to limit Federal law en-
forcement officers for crowd control; 
that there be 2 hours for debate, equal-
ly divided between opponents and pro-
ponents; and that upon the use or 
yielding back of time, the Senate vote 
in relation to the amendment with no 
intervening action or debate. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
The Senator from North Dakota. 
Mr. CRAMER. Mr. President, in re-
serving the right to object, I, like the 
entire staff in the Chamber today and 
like the Presiding Officer for most of 
this time, has endured this for the last 
hour, an hour that has been very simi-
lar to the hour we had yesterday on the 
very same topic and with the very 
same motion to have the very same 
amendment passed in the Defense Au-
thorization Act. 
I am a member of the Committee on 
Armed Services. Prior to the Presiding 
Officer, I was presiding. I was honored 
to sit in that chair and watch the 
chairman of the Committee on Armed 
Services and the ranking Democrat of 
the Committee on Armed Services talk 
in glowing terms about each other and 
the bipartisan effort that has led to a 
National Defense Authorization Act 
that has considered 807 amendments to 
this point. As we sit here, 40 more 
amendments—20 by Republicans and 20 
by Democrats—are being hotlined for 
further consideration for, hopefully, to-
morrow’s final passage. 
The National Defense Authorization 
Act has been greatly debated. In fact, 
it has been the most debated bill that 
I have been part of since I got here. Not 
only that, the amendments that are 
represented in this 807 are almost, 
nearly, equally divided among the two 
parties represented in this great Cham-
ber. 
What we have been witnessing to-
night is a diatribe—in some cases, fan-
tasy but, in every case, an exaggera-
tion and, in many cases, a fabrication. 
The good Senator from Oregon has 
shown us pictures of what democracy 
looks like. I don’t disagree. We are self- 
governed. The exceptionalism of Amer-
ica is that we are self-governed. 
Democracy also demands protocol in 
this Chamber, the most deliberative 
body in this world. Yet, without any 
warning—without any heads-up—here 
we are, dealing with a unanimous con-
sent motion on an amendment that has 
already failed to get unanimous con-
sent just in the last 24 hours on a bill 
that has already been debated for 
weeks and months. It included bipar-
tisan amendments across the board. 
Then we are confronted with this 
breach of not only protocol but of— 
well, let’s just say—common decency 
and respect for each other. 
I do agree with the Senator from Or-
egon on this point: He is right in that 
we should have the debate, and that is 
why it is too bad that his amendment 
wasn’t allowed to be debated in Sen-
ator TIM SCOTT’s JUSTICE Act. 
And the reason it couldn’t be debated 
there was because he and most every 
one of his colleagues on the Democrat 
side 
other 
than 
three 
filibustered 
against TIM SCOTT’s police reform bill. 
I don’t think they want a solution. 
They want to have this crazy rhetoric, 
demagogue all day and all night, wher-
ever they can have a demagogue, and 
they want to blame President Donald 
Trump for the actions of criminals. 
Now, I have heard it all when I have 
heard, from the Senate floor, antifa re-
ferred to as the anti—what did he call 
them? 
The 
antifascists. 
The 
antifascists. That is the way to sugar-
coat thugs. 
So for these reasons—and I could 
think of dozens of others, but I will 
spare you all and the staff this late 
night, getting later—I object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard. 
The 
Senator 
from 
Oregon’s 
postcloture time has expired. 
Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent to speak for 5 min-
utes. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
Mr. MERKLEY. And I would invite 
my colleague to stay if he would like 
to and yield to him if he wants to jump 
into the conversation. 
Mr. CRAMER. I think we have had 
enough debate. I object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard. 
Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent to speak for 2 min-
utes. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
Mr. CRAMER. Mr. President, I don’t 
object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, my 
colleague has said that the facts I have 
presented tonight are a fabrication, to 
use his exact word. He has called it a 
breach of protocol. He has called it a 
violation of common decency. 
I think we are here as a Chamber to 
address difficult, important issues in 
America. This is a difficult and impor-
tant mission. 
This is a new use of force in a manner 
that doesn’t belong in the streets of 
America. It is important that we de-
bate it. 
I would be happy to have it be a 
standalone bill, come up right after 
this National Defense Authorization 
Act, and have it debated for 2 hours 
and voted on, because then we actually 
have a conversation and we have to 
take a position, and our constituents 
can see where we stand, and folks could 
propose an amendment to it if they 
didn’t like the way I have written it. It 
is so simple. It says: Do what we have 
always done. Put ID about where you 
come from. Have a unique identifier. 
And don’t go sweeping through the 
streets if your mission is to protect a 
Federal property. Stay at that Federal 
property or work with the Governor or 
the mayor if you have a broader effort. 
Those are reasonable things. 
I don’t think that it was a breach of 
protocol to ask this Chamber to con-
sider that on this bill because there is 
a connection. We are talking about a 
bill that involves the use of force and 
how we govern in America. 
I don’t think it is a violation of com-
mon decency. My colleague does, and I 
would prefer that we actually have 
that conversation about the facts and 
about the arguments, about the simple 
solution I proposed when we can actu-
ally take a vote or other people can 
offer amendments to it and modify it. 
That is this Chamber doing what it 
should be doing. 
So I am disappointed that my col-
league is blocking this from being con-
sidered before this body. 
I do love this body, and I first came 
here when amendments were freely— 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The gen-
tleman’s time has expired. 
Mr. MERKLEY. Thank you, Mr. 
President. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from North Dakota. 
Mr. CRAMER. Mr. President, I am 
just going to reiterate my final point 
one final time, and I promise not to 
take more time than the Senator from 
Oregon. 
He had his opportunity to have this 
amendment considered, debated, and 
voted on in the JUSTICE Act, intro-
duced by Senator TIM SCOTT, a bill that 
dealt specifically with police reform. 
It would have been the perfect place 
to have the debate, except that my col-
league voted against cloture so we 
couldn’t even proceed to the bill.

I don’t know how we could have made 
it any easier or better. In fact, when we 
took up the JUSTICE Act, he and his 
side were provided at least 20 amend-
ment opportunities. We could have had 
the debate he seeks tonight at the ap-
propriate time on the appropriate bill, 
and I am sorry that we didn’t do that. 
Perhaps after tonight’s episode, he 
and his colleagues will reconsider, and 
perhaps before we are done this year, 
Senator SCOTT’s JUSTICE Act could be 
brought to the floor and we could have 
an adult discussion and debate on 
amendments and on the bill and on all 
kinds of great ideas right here in the 
most august body in the United States. 
I hope that can happen. 
With that, I yield the floor and wish 
you a good night.

[From the Washington Post, July 19, 2020] 
THERE’S NO GOING
BACK
TO
THE PRE-PAN-
DEMIC
ECONOMY—CONGRESS
SHOULD
RE-
SPOND ACCORDINGLY 
(By Steve Case) 
This week, Congress will likely take up the 
next steps in the economic response to the 
covid–19 pandemic. If the package is like pre-
vious efforts, it will focus on trying to turn 
back the clock to February 2020: treating the 
economy as if it were Sleeping Beauty, mere-
ly needing to be awakened to be fully re-
stored. This strategy is a mistake: Congress 
needs to stop solely backing efforts to re-
store the old economic reality and focus on 
how to develop a new one. 
Most of the $1 trillion that Congress has 
put into business support so far during the 
pandemic has been directed to preserving ex-
isting firms through the Paycheck Protec-
tion Program and the Main Street Relief 
Fund. Helping those businesses and their 
workers is vital, but that alone won’t fuel 
the economic recovery the country needs. 
The problem is that many of the businesses 
backed by PPP or Main Street are going to 
wind up shutting down. Even when they 
aren’t facing a global pandemic or economic 
crisis, about 100,000 small and medium-size 
businesses fail in the United States every 
year. New businesses will be needed to re-
place the ones that permanently close. More-
over, the failure rate is likely to be higher, 
as many firms were on the wrong side of 
trends—such as the move to online shopping, 
convenient 
food 
delivery 
or 
watching 
streaming content at home—that the pan-
demic lockdown has accelerated. 
Another 
consideration: 
The 
protests 
stirred by the killing of George Floyd in 
Minneapolis police custody have made clear 
how many Americans were left behind in the 
pre-coronavirus economy; restoring the way 
things were before the virus hit won’t ad-
dress these needs. 
Here are three ways Congress can help 
launch a new, more equitable era of entre-
preneurship. 
First: Make it easier for the earliest-stage 
start-ups to receive PPP dollars and for all 
start-ups to access the Main Street Relief 
Fund. PPP loans go to existing businesses to 
maintain jobs but not to new businesses that 
want to create them. Main Street loans go 
only to companies that are already profit-
able; most start-ups are not. That approach 
is backward: Studies show that nearly all 
net new job creation comes from start-ups, 
not established businesses. 
A PPP revision should allow start-ups to 
obtain loans based on their plans to create 
jobs—with loan forgiveness granted only if 
those jobs materialize. If they don’t, the 
start-ups should be required to repay the 
loans before any other obligations. And the 
barrier in the Main Street lending program 
that makes businesses ineligible for aid if 
they were not profitable in 2019 should be re-
moved. 
Second, the government needs to be a 
counterweight to private capital that exac-
erbates geographic disparities in opportunity 
as the country responds to the crisis. The 
pandemic is a devastating tragedy, but ad-
versity tends to be met by the creation of 
new industries and new businesses. This cri-
sis will stir innovations in medicine, goods 
and services delivered at home, remote work 
and learning, and more. Where will these 
new firms grow? If the decision is left to the 
private sector alone, almost all of them will 
be in three states: New York, California and 
Massachusetts, which attract 75 percent of 
all venture capital. 
Great ideas to respond to this crisis are 
spread widely across the country—but cap-
ital is not. Business assistance programs cre-
ated by Congress should have a special focus 
on getting startups off the ground in places 
that have lacked venture capital backing in 
the past. Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) and 
others have already proposed such legisla-
tion; members of Congress from these ne-
glected areas should insist it is part of any 
Phase 4 bill. 
Finally, lawmakers should step in to ad-
dress unintended inequalities of opportunity 
for 
female 
and 
minority 
entrepreneurs 
caused by the earlier relief bills. Because 
these programs fund only existing busi-
nesses, they reinforce opportunity gaps. 
Communities with thriving businesses get 
more PPP and Main Street aid; those that 
have lacked capital to get businesses off the 
ground in the past see little help now. 
The solution would be for Congress to di-
rect unused PPP funds to start-ups led by fe-
male entrepreneurs and entrepreneurs of 
color, creating opportunities where they 
have not existed before. The Main Street 
Lending program could be modified to ex-
tend special debt options to community de-
velopment groups and minority-focused ac-
celerators to back a new wave of startups 
founded by historically underrepresented en-
trepreneurs. 
There’s no going back to the pre-pandemic 
U.S. economy. Too much has changed; too 
many new needs exist. This is a rare oppor-
tunity to break with the past and create a 
better future. Congress should grab it. 
f 
VOTE EXPLANATION 
Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Mr. President, I 
voted in support of S. Amdt. 1788, 
which would reduce defense spending 
by 10 percent and invest that money 
into healthcare, education, and poverty 
reduction in communities with a pov-
erty rate of 25 percent or more. To gov-
ern is to choose, and as we face unprec-
edented challenges at home, this de-
fense budget is out of step with the val-
ues, priorities, and needs of the Amer-
ican people. 
The unchecked growth in the defense 
budget 
is 
unsustainable, 
and 
the 
Trump administration has exacerbated 
these challenges. We have a duty to en-
sure the readiness of our forces, and I 
have supported efforts to rebuild our 
Armed Forces after years of costly 
overseas engagements. But massive 
spending increases without clear stra-
tegic direction do not make us safer. 
We need to be thoughtful about our 
spending 
choices, 
recognizing 
that 
every dollar spent on defense is a dollar 
not spent on healthcare, education, 
workforce training, and other critical 
areas of need. 
The National Defense Authorization 
Act as it is currently written would 
spend $740.5 billion on defense. This 
represents 53 percent of total Federal 
discretionary spending and exceeds the 
defense budgets of the next 11 nations 
combined, including our allies in Aus-
tralia, South Korea, Germany, Japan, 
France, and the United Kingdom. It is 
more than twice the combined defense 
expenditures of China and Russia. 
Topline defense spending has risen by 
more than $100 billion since President 
Trump took office; after the $74 billion 
cut proposed in this amendment, de-
fense spending would still be above the 
fiscal year 2017 level. 
Some of my colleagues have ex-
pressed unease about the across-the- 
board nature of these cuts, and I agree 
that a targeted approach is preferable. 
But I have seen the consequences of de-
laying difficult decisions and believe 
we can no longer wait to have difficult 
conversations about our defense budg-
et. In addition, the National Defense 
Authorization Act is not an appropria-
tions bill, and this amendment simply 
reduces the total amount of money au-
thorized to be spent on defense in the 
upcoming fiscal year. The Appropria-
tions Committee, on which I serve, will 
still have the task of making thought-
ful, targeted reductions in areas of 
lower priority, while preserving fund-
ing for high-priority items. I encourage 
my colleagues to confront these chal-
lenges for the good of our country and 
make adjustments as needed during 
conference negotiations with the House 
while remaining under the cap set by 
this amendment. 
I am glad that this amendment pro-
tects salaries and healthcare from cuts, 
and would have preferred that it go fur-
ther in making targeted cuts in order

to reduce the impact elsewhere in the 
defense 
budget. 
In 
particular, 
we 
should have taken this opportunity to 
scale back our country’s trillion-dollar 
nuclear modernization efforts. Modern-
izing our nuclear weapons in a manner 
that makes them easier to use in more 
scenarios while abrogating our treaty 
responsibilities and doing nothing to 
bring Russia back to the nuclear nego-
tiating table is a recipe for disaster. 
However, my concerns with the par-
ticulars of this amendment do not 
change the plain fact that our national 
defense budget has grown out of con-
trol. In the midst of the worst eco-
nomic downturn since the Great De-
pression, a pandemic that has taken 
the lives of more than 143,000 of our fel-
low Americans and shows no signs of 
slowing down, and the impending crises 
of homelessness and joblessness that 
we face if the Congress fails to provide 
relief, we simply cannot afford to con-
tinue this level of overinvestment in 
defense at the expense of other critical 
national priorities. For that reason, I 
supported this amendment.

REMEMBERING LORNE CRANER 
Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I would 
like to pay tribute to someone many of 
my colleagues knew and admired, 
Lorne Craner, who passed away on July 
2 at the too young age of 61, a victim of 
cancer. 
Lorne dedicated his professional life 
to advancing freedom and justice in the 
world. He served that cause faithfully 
as the longest tenured president of the 
International 
Republican 
Institute, 
IRI, as the Assistant Secretary of 
State for Democracy, Human Rights, 
and Labor in the George W. Bush ad-
ministration, as Director of Asian Af-
fairs on President George H.W. Bush’s 
National Security Council, and as an 
advisor to Members of Congress, in-
cluding his service as foreign affairs 
aide to a newly elected Senator from 
Arizona, 
our 
late 
colleague, 
John 
McCain. 
He 
continued 
to 
advance 
American values abroad as president of 
the 
American 
Councils 
for 
Inter-
national Education, as a board member 
of several distinguished organizations, 
including the Millennium Challenge 
Corporation. 
I got to know Lorne when Senator 
McCain, who was IRI’s chairman, asked 
me to serve on its board. I saw the In-
stitute thrive in size and reach under 
Lorne’s leadership, becoming one of the 
world’s most effective agencies for 
democratic development, respected by 
human rights advocates around the 
world and in both U.S. political par-
ties. 
Like John, Lorne was a tireless de-
fender of the dignity of all human 
beings, the bedrock value that democ-
racies are instituted to respect. Like 
John, Lorne fought the bad guys to de-
fend the little guys. Toward that end, 
he usually exercised a little more skill 
at diplomacy than John sometimes 
possessed, but they shared an equal de-
votion to mankind’s right to life, lib-
erty, and the pursuit of happiness. Sec-
retary of State Colin Powell awarded 
Lorne the Distinguished Service Medal, 
the State Department’s highest decora-
tion. 
Lorne and John shared, too, a dedica-
tion to the peaceful conduct of inter-
national relations. Both knew that our 
interests and values sometimes had to 
be defended by force of arms, but they 
were both so personally familiar with 
the costs of war that they worked hard 
to 
resolve 
international 
conflicts 
peacefully where possible and to make 
new friends of former enemies. 
Lorne went to work for John in his 
last term as a Member of the House 
and his first term in the Senate, but 
their relationship began earlier than 
that. Lorne’s father, Air Force Colonel 
Bob Craner, resided for more than 2 
years in the cell next to John’s in a 
Hanoi prison the POWs called, ‘‘the 
Plantation.’’ John described Colonel 
Craner to me as one of the finest offi-
cers he had ever served with and ‘‘prob-
ably the person I was closest too in my 
life that I wasn’t related to.’’ John was 
held in solitary confinement at the 
time, the hardest period of his impris-
onment, and he credited Bob Craner, 
whom he constantly communicated 
with by tap code, ‘‘with keeping me 
sane.’’ 
Despite the mistreatment of the 
POWS, John resolved early in his Sen-
ate career to help America reconcile 
with Vietnam, recognizing that the 
U.S. and Vietnam had shared interests 
in Southeast Asia, and that the cause 
of human dignity in the country where 
he had resided involuntarily for over 5 
years could be served through friendly 
rather than hostile relations. The nor-
malization of relations between the 
U.S. and Vietnam wouldn’t have hap-
pened when it did if not for John’s ef-
forts to help bring it about. I think it 
is one of his greatest achievements. 
And Lorne Craner, the son who was de-
prived of his father for 5 years by the 
Vietnam war, provided invaluable help 
in that effort. 
Lorne travelled to Vietnam with 
John in 1990, where he helped John 
build productive partnerships with Vi-
etnamese officials who would help re-
solve issues that were in the way of 
better relations. And from his positions 
in government and at the IRI, he con-
tinued to advance American interests 
and ideals in Southeast Asia. Today, 
growing security and commercial ties 
between the two former enemies, sym-
bolized by the port calls in Vietnam by 
U.S. Navy ships, including the USS 
John S. McCain, are a testament to 
both John and Lorne’s vision and effec-
tiveness. They imagined a better future 
out of the resentments and rubble of 
war, and, with others, made it a re-
ality. They were both men who be-
lieved to do good in the world was why 
we were put on this earth. 
Lorne was deeply committed to his 
cause, a cause he never strayed from, 
for a day in his life, and we are all bet-
ter for it. He was, too, as all who knew 
him will testify, a devoted father and 
husband, and his family’s loss is the 
most profound. He was a hard man to 
lose at such a young age, for his family 
and friends, and for the country and 
the world. 
Lorne Craner, son of Robert and Au-
drey Craner, husband of Anne Craner, 
father to three beloved children, Isa-
belle, Alexander, and Charles, brother 
of Charys, an American patriot, a man 
of justice, a peacemaker, and a friend 
to many, is gone. But his memory is a 
blessing to all who had the good for-
tune to have known him. 
To his wife and children, the people 
who loved him most, as much as you 
hurt today, time will assuage your 
grief, and you will still feel his pres-
ence in your hearts. I lost my parents 
when I was a young man. I can say 
with confidence that the day will come 
when you will recall, without heart-
ache, the good and honorable man who 
loved you so and with whom you will 
one day be reunited. God bless you. 
Thank you.

65TH ANNIVERSARY OF MINOT AIR 
FORCE BASE 
Mr. CRAMER. Mr. President, I want 
to congratulate the Minot Air Force 
Base on the 65th anniversary of its be-
ginning. 
On July 12, 1955, Minot, ND, commu-
nity leaders and area residents gath-
ered to break ground on land north of 
the city for what would become the 
Minot Air Force Base. One and a half 
years later, operations commenced at 
the base, and personnel and aircraft 
made their way to Minot, where they 
have enhanced our State and defended 
our Nation ever since. By the mid- 
1960s, it was recognized as one of the 
Nation’s largest military installations, 
with a population of nearly 19,000 mili-
tary and civilian men and women and 
their families. It was also recognized as 
having the largest housing village on a 
military base in the continental United 
States, with more than 2,450 homes. 
The mission, aircraft, and staff have 
changed over these past seven decades. 
Today, the Minot Air Force Base sup-
ports two legs of the Nation’s nuclear 
triad and provides vital defense to our 
security. It is the only dual-wing nu-
clear-capable installation in the Na-
tion, with the 5th Bomb Wing and its 
B–52 bombers and the 91st Missile 
Wing, along with Minuteman III inter-
continental ballistic missiles. 
During these 65 years, the Minot 
community and State of North Dakota 
have remained constant in their sup-
port for the thousands of people who 
have been stationed at the Minot Air 
Force Base. We take pride in all they 
have done and continue to do to ensure 
peace throughout our world. We will 
continue to stand by them in the years 
ahead. 
To the men and women of the Minot 
Air Force Base, you and all who came 
before you have faithfully served our

ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS 
REMEMBERING TECHNICAL 
SERGEANT RALPH H. RAY 
∑ Mrs. CAPITO. Mr. President, I rise to 
recognize Technical Sergeant Ralph H. 
Ray, who was a dedicated West Vir-
ginia serviceman in our U.S. Army Air 
Corps during World War II. T SGT 
Ralph H. Ray is being honored by the 
renaming of a bridge on U.S. Route 60 
that spans the Greenbrier River in his 
native Greenbrier County, WV. 
T SGT Ralph H. Ray graduated from 
Frankford High School at the age of 17 
in 1940. He left his home in West Vir-
ginia to complete his enlisted physical 
for the U.S. Army Corps on January 7, 
1943, and subsequently earned the rank 
of technical sergeant. He earned his 
airplane mechanic diploma at the Ford 
Factory in Michigan the spring of 1943 
and then completed gunnery school in 
Laredo, TX. 
During his service, T SGT Ralph H. 
Ray was assigned to a top-notch flight 
crew with whom he trained for 3 
months. He and his crew traveled to 
Trinidad, Brazil, Africa, Morocco, and 
Wales before reaching the Tibenham 
Base in East England. While serving as 
a flight engineer during World War II, 
he and his crew flew 30 successful mis-
sions before returning to the United 
States and spending the last 10 months 
of his enlistment at the Air Transport 
Corps in Miami, FL. This dedicated and 
diverse military service is certainly 
worthy of admiration. 
After his release from the U.S. Army 
Air Corps, T SGT Ralph H. Ray worked 
as an airplane mechanic for Bollinger 
Airport in Davis Creek, WV, and while 
there, he earned his civilian pilot’s li-
cense. T SGT Ralph H. Ray began 
working as a chemical technician for 
Westvaco in South Charleston, WV, in 
1948. He married his wife Mary Mad-
eline Hudson on April 16, 1948, and es-
tablished a beautiful and loving family 
with 
four 
daughters: 
Valerie 
Ann 
Lyons, Angela Sue Ray, Verna Ray- 
Breaux, and Anita Ray-Kirk. 
T SGT Ralph H. Ray retired in 1984 
and passed away on August 8, 2019. It is 
fitting that an enduring monument 
will be established to commemorate 
Technical Sergeant Ray and his con-
tributions to our State and our coun-
try. As resolved by legislature of West 
Virginia, the locally known Caldwell 
Bridge, will henceforth be named the 
‘‘U.S. Army Air Corps T SGT Ralph H. 
Ray Memorial Bridge.’’ I hope it pro-
vokes thought and appreciation for all 
of our military heroes and may the 
bridge be an enduring reminder of the 
life of dedicated serviceman, husband, 
father, and lifelong West Virginian.∑

TRIBUTE TO JEANNINE ABADIE 
∑Mr. RUBIO. Mr. President, today I 
recognize Jeannine Abadie, the Walton 
County Teacher of the Year at Emerald 
Coast Middle School in Santa Rosa 
Beach, FL. 
Jeannine is always working to help 
her students better understand mathe-
matics and to improve her classroom 
to better suite their needs. She re-
cently created a video app that pro-
vides tutorials for students. She spe-
cializes in curriculum design and as-
sessment analysis for her math classes. 
Jeannine also mentors her colleagues 
in lesson planning and student achieve-
ment. She provides support and profes-
sional development for her colleagues 
to ensure their students are well 
equipped for high school and their fu-
ture educational careers. 
Jeannine is a math instructor at Em-
erald Coast Middle School and has 
taught there for 7 years. Previously, 
Jeannine taught algebra at Northwest 
Florida State College. She received her

TRIBUTE TO FAITH BENCH 
∑ Mr. RUBIO. Mr. President, today I 
honor Faith Bench, the Manatee Coun-
ty Teacher of the Year at Braden River 
Middle School in Bradenton, FL. 
Faith has a special bond with her 
students who struggle with math. That 
is because she struggled with the sub-
ject when she was in school. She under-
stands those who hate the subject at 
the beginning of the year and finds it 
deeply fulfilling to help grow each stu-
dent’s problem-solving skills by the 
time they leave her class with greater 
confidence and appreciation for the 
subject. 
Faith’s colleagues note that she 
works hard to make learning fun and 
engaging for her students each year. 
She is committed to tailoring her les-
son plans to suit the individual needs 
of every student. In turn, Faith is in-
spired by her colleagues and believes 
that their work together is the key to 
an educator’s best work. 
Faith teaches mathematics to sev-
enth grade students at Braden River 
Middle School. Teaching is her passion, 
and she wants to help her students ac-
complish their dreams. 
I thank Faith for the good work she 
has done for her students over the 
years. I look forward to learning of her 
continued good work in the coming 
years.∑ 
TRIBUTE TO KATHY HAMILTON- 
BROWN 
∑ Mr. RUBIO. Mr. President, today I 
recognize Kathy Hamilton-Brown, the 
Brevard County Teacher of the Year at 
Endeavor Elementary School in Cocoa, 
FL. 
Kathy credits her success to her fel-
low teachers in Brevard County. She 
notes that her school is like her fam-
ily: a home away from home. To 
Kathy, teaching is more than just a 
job. She believes her students are our 
Nation’s future leaders, and she is com-
mitted to making a difference in each 
of their lives. 
Kathy’s life experiences influenced 
her to become a teacher and care for 
her students. She feels indebted to the 
support system of family and friends 
who guided her at a young age. She 
hopes to inspire her students to do 
something great with their lives after 
they leave her classroom. 
Colleagues note that Kathy is a 
fierce advocate for students, working 
to ensure they succeed both socially 
and academically. Due in large part to 
her innovative efforts, Kathy’s school 
saw a 61-percent reduction in discipli-
nary referrals, as well as an increase in 
overall student attendance. 
Kathy is a prekindergarten through 
sixth grade teacher at Endeavor Ele-
mentary School. She has been with 
Brevard Public Schools for 21 years. 
Outside of the classroom, she serves on 
the community partnership school op-
erations team and works with Endeav-
or’s business partners throughout the 
community. 
I would like to extend my sincere 
thanks and gratitude to Kathy for her 
commitment to the education of her 
students. I look forward to hearing of 
her continued good work in the coming 
years.∑

TRIBUTE TO WILLIAM FURIOSI 
∑ Mr. RUBIO. Mr. President, today I 
am pleased to honor William Furiosi, 
the Seminole County Teacher of the 
Year at Oviedo High School in Oviedo, 
FL. 
William 
has 
taught 
AP 
biology, 
chemistry, and experimental research 
at Oviedo High School for the past 17 
years. William aims to create a posi-
tive environment for students to think 
critically while studying science. He 
enjoys breaking down complex sci-
entific theories to help them better un-
derstand the component ideas behind 
what they are learning. 
At the Seminole County Science Fair 
this year, 12 of his student’s science 
projects placed, with six first places, 
four second places, and two third 
places. His students say they benefit 
from his teaching style, finding it re-
latable and exciting during their class-
es. 
I thank William for the good work he 
has done for his students over the 
years. I wish him all the best and look 
forward to learning of his continued 
success in the coming years.∑

recognize Jae Glass, the Gulf County 
Teacher of the Year at Port St. Joe 
High School in Port St. Joe, FL. 
Jae teaches seventh grade English 
language arts and a ninth grade inten-
sive reading class at her alma mater, 
Port St. Joe High School, where she 
has taught for 8 years. 
Jae dedicates her time to being a 
positive role model for her students by 
engaging with them each day in her 
classroom. 
Throughout 
the

year, her students participate in more 
than traditional learning lectures. An 
example of an alternative activity in-
cludes her ‘‘book tasting day,’’ which 
allows students to snack at picnic ta-
bles while sampling from an array of 
books. 
Jae believes it is important to make 
English relatable and fun to her stu-
dents. She encourages them to use 
reading and writing as a creative 
means of expression. She also works to 
help 
students 
that 
do 
not 
speak 
English as a first language by securing 
additional materials for her school. 
I convey my sincere gratitude to Jae

Evan felt honored and humbled to 
represent Clay County as he considers 
himself just one of the many high-qual-
ity educators teaching in the region. 
He relishes opportunities for his stu-
dents to participate at district and 
State competitions as he takes great

Chipley, FL. 
Joli has been a teacher for more than 
26 years. She is the adult education di-

ment and format of Joli’s class is ever- 
changing. She works with students 
ranging from 16 to 66 years old who are 
working towards their GED, and she is 
able to modify her teaching style to 
match the composition of the current 
class. She is willing to meet with her 
students anytime, whether when they 
arrive in her classroom, after class, or 
by appointment. 
Joli finds the best part of teaching to 
be the family she has found at the

dents, but also for himself. He enjoys 
working with other teachers in the 
school district and works to utilize the 
teaching experience to make the learn-
ing of chemistry as real, enjoyable, and 
successful as he can for his students. 
Euan believes he is fortunate to have

Whitney considers her role in her 
students’ lives to be one that offers en-
couragement, guidance, and compas-
sion. She works with her colleagues to 
implement new teaching strategies and 
plans standards-based lessons to ensure 
students are prepared for the third 
grade when they leave her classroom. 
Whitney began her teaching career at 
Yulee Primary School, teaching there 
for 5 years before becoming a second 
grade teacher at Wildlight Elementary 
School, where she has taught for the 
past 2 years as a team leader and grade 
level chair. She is also on her school’s 
action plan team, which works to cre-
ate plans to help the lowest quartile 
students improve in school. 
I extend my best wishes to Whitney 
for her good work as a teacher and look 
forward to hearing of her continued 
good work in the years to come.∑

TRIBUTE TO DEVON LAMONICA 
∑ Mr. RUBIO. Mr. President, today I 
honor Devon LaMonica, the Okaloosa 
County Teacher of the Year at Fort 
Walton Beach High School in Fort Wal-
ton Beach, FL. 
Teaching was not the career Devon 
imagined for herself when studying fo-
rensic science biochemistry at the Uni-
versity of Central Florida, but now she 
cannot imagine any other career for 
herself. Devon loves the opportunity to 
ignite a passion for science in her stu-
dents and views teaching as a joy. She 
launched the biomedical science pro-
gram at Fort Walton Beach High 
School and continues to teach the en-
tire program. 
Devon earned her master’s degree in 
education at the University of West 
Florida and returned to work as an ed-
ucator at Fort Walton Beach High 
School, her own alma mater. She is na-
tionally recognized as a Biomedical 
Science Master Teacher and trains new 
teachers in this field across our Nation. 
She has been a teacher for 13 years. 
I extend my sincere thanks and grati-
tude to Devon for her work to teach 
her students. I look forward to learning 
of her continued success in the years 
ahead.∑

TRIBUTE TO ELIZABETH MANN 
∑ Mr. RUBIO. Mr. President, today I 
recognize Elizabeth Mann, the Santa 
Rosa County Teacher of the Year at 
Oriole Beach Elementary School in 
Oriole Beach, FL. 
Elizabeth believes children learn best 
when they are working together. She 
provides opportunities throughout the 
school year for her students to team up 
with one another to accomplish a goal. 
She accepts each student for who they 
are and holds high expectations, view-
ing their small victories as the most 
rewarding part of her work. Whether it 
is their first time counting to 20 or 
helping a friend, she believes these mo-
ments make her job fulfilling. 
Elizabeth comes from a family of 
educators. 
Both 
her 
parents 
were 
teachers and instilled in her the drive 
to help others. Her colleagues consider 
her to be every parent’s dream teacher 
for their child because of her dedica-
tion to the children’s success. 
Elizabeth is a student education in-
clusion teacher for first grade at Oriole 
Beach Elementary School. She works 
with special needs students throughout 
the school year and offers group and 
one-on-one instruction across all sub-
ject areas. 
I am grateful for Elizabeth’s great 
work with her students. I extend my 
best wishes to her and look forward to 
learning of her continued good work in 
her future endeavors.∑

TRIBUTE TO KELLI McGAHEY 
∑ Mr. RUBIO. Mr. President, today I 
recognize Kelli McGahey, the Putnam 
County Teacher of the Year at James 
A. Long Elementary School in Palatka, 
FL. 
Kelli’s colleagues note that she has 
an innate ability to connect with stu-
dents struggling academically or devel-
opmentally. She often spends extra 
time helping those students better un-
derstand assignments. Kelli seeks to 
impart her love for reading to her stu-
dents and is passionate about inspiring 
the next generation of avid readers. 
Kelli has taught first grade at James 
A. Long Elementary School for 6 years. 
While Kelli was surprised to learn that 
she received this prestigious recogni-
tion, her students and colleagues con-
sider her an inspiration and know it 
was well deserved. 
I would like to thank Kelli for the 
good work she has done for her stu-
dents and extend my best wishes to 
her. I look forward to hearing of her 
continued success.∑ 
f 
TRIBUTE TO JONATHAN MOTTA 
∑ Mr. RUBIO. Mr. President, today I 
recognize Jonathan Motta, the Osceola 
County Teacher of the Year at NeoCity 
Academy in Kissimmee, FL. 
Jonathan believes it is important 
that his students be prepared for life 
after high school and challenges them 
to apply the principles they learn after 
they leave his classroom. He works to 
incorporate upper level math into prac-
tical business models, technology, and 
other areas that are important to stu-
dents. He considers this integration to 
be the most rewarding part of his work. 
Jonathan also seeks to fill what he 
views as a gap in the traditional teach-
ing format by teaching his students 
other life skills, such as organization 
and public speaking. 
Jonathan finds the unique environ-
ment and approach to learning at 
NeoCity Academy to be a great place 
for his teaching style. He teaches 
mathematics and has incorporated a 
variety of concepts to students in Osce-
ola County for the past 7 years. During 
his tenure, he developed a project- 
based learning curriculum that creates 
assignments involving real-world sce-
narios such as architecture, finance, 
design and manufacturing, and health. 
I thank Jonathan for his passion and 
creative efforts to implement a lifelong 
approach to learning. I wish him all 
the best in the years to come.∑

TRIBUTE TO KAREN NEADS 
∑ Mr. RUBIO. Mr. President, today I 
am pleased to recognize Karen Neads, 
the DeSoto County Teacher of the Year 
from Memorial Elementary School in 
Arcadia, FL. 
At Memorial Elementary School, 
Karen strives to develop a positive en-
vironment in which she is able to moti-
vate her students. As she prefers to 
teach in a way where she is more be-
hind the scenes than upfront, Karen 
was shocked to receive this important 
recognition. She credits her colleagues 
and administrators on their work to 
help teach the school’s youngest stu-
dents to her success. 
Karen was named Teacher of the 
Year in her 25th year of teaching, all of 
which she has taught kindergarten and 
in DeSoto County. Her favorite aspect 
of teaching is watching her students 
grow throughout the year. She notes 
they enter her classroom with a blank 
slate and, by the end of the school 
year, are able to read and write. 
I extend my sincere thanks and grati-
tude to Karen for her dedication to her 
students, and I look forward to hearing 
of her continued success in the years 
ahead.∑

TRIBUTE TO JACOB POELMA 
∑ Mr. RUBIO. Mr. President, today I 
am pleased to honor Jacob Poelma, the 
Monroe County Teacher of the Year 
from Coral Shores High School in 
Tavernier, FL. 
Jacob believes that, as a teacher, his 
impact is greater than the sum of his 
students’ test scores and homework 
grades. He strives to honor a student’s 
individuality while fostering a sense of 
community in the classroom. He knows 
that every student has a unique story 
and focuses on tailoring his teaching to 
engage each student in the best way 
they are able to learn. Jacob works to 
provide 
real-time 
language 
trans-
lations of his lectures so all of his stu-
dents can master the material in their 
native language. 
Jacob has taught biology in Monroe 
County for 4 years. He works with stu-
dents in and out of the classroom by of-
fering 
personalized 
teaching 
and 
mentorship 
opportunities, 
sponsors 
Coral Shores High School’s Gaming 
Club, announces sporting events, and 
volunteers at extracurricular and other 
community activities. 
I extend my deepest gratitude to 
Jacob for his dedication to his students 
and efforts to improve the learning ex-
perience. I look forward to hearing of 
his continued success in the years to 
come.∑

TRIBUTE TO KATHLEEN RULING 
∑ Mr. RUBIO. Mr. President, today I 
recognize Kathleen Ruling, the Union 
County Teacher of the Year from Lake 
Butler Elementary School in Lake But-
ler, FL. 
Kathy believes that every child is 
worthy of respect, as they have a 
unique story to tell. She views her job 
not as a line of work, but a place where 
she is preparing each student for their 
future. Her colleagues describe her as 
having a natural gift for teaching and 
working with children. 
Whether by creating hands-on class-
room experiences or diligently track-
ing each child’s progress, Kathy sup-
ports her student’s educational careers 
and is always willing to help, even 
after they leave her classroom. 
As an elementary special education 
teacher for 38 years, Kathy has left a 
lasting legacy in Union County. In 1985,

she implemented the staggered start

she founded the Tiger Cubs, a club that 
recognizes students for their positive 
attitude and encouragement to peers. 
Both of these programs are still in ef-
fect in the county. 
I express my sincere appreciation to 
Kathy for her many accomplishments 
and years of service to her students. I

TRIBUTE TO JOSIE STUMPF 
∑ Mr. RUBIO. Mr. President, today I 
am pleased to honor Josie Stumpf, the 
Volusia County Teacher of the Year at 
Holly Hill School in Holly Hill, FL. 
Josie teaches fifth grade and has 
taught in Volusia County for nearly 20 
years. She credits her success to Day-
tona Beach mayor Derrick Henry, who 
was her 11th grade teacher. She says 
Mayor Henry changed the course of her 
life, as it was not until she was in his 
class, where music and energy were in-
corporated into his lessons, that she re-
alized learning could be fun. This moti-
vated her to inspire others in the same 
way that he inspired her. 
Josie strives to keep learning fun. An 
example of her creative teaching in-
cludes transforming her classroom to 
mimic a campground, a cafe, and many 
other different environments to better 
engage her students in the learning 
process. 
Josie’s colleagues admire her seem-
ingly natural ability to relate to stu-
dents, which has inspired them to fol-
low her lead. Josie’s enthusiasm for 
education extends beyond her own 
classroom, where she has been known 
to develop curriculum modules for lan-
guage arts and regularly helps other 
teachers. 
I extend my best wishes and grati-
tude to Josie for her dedication to stu-
dents for nearly two decades, and I 
look forward to hearing of her contin-
ued success in the years to come.∑

MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT 
A message from the President of the 
United States was communicated to 
the Senate by Ms. Ridgway, one of his 
secretaries. 
f 
PRESIDENTIAL MESSAGE 
REPORT RELATIVE TO THE CON-
TINUATION OF THE NATIONAL 
EMERGENCY WITH RESPECT TO 
TRANSNATIONAL CRIMINAL OR-
GANIZATIONS THAT WAS ESTAB-
LISHED 
IN 
EXECUTIVE 
ORDER 
13581 ON JULY 24, 2011—PM 55 
The PRESIDING OFFICER laid be-
fore the Senate the following message 
from the President of the United 
States, together with an accompanying 
report; which was referred to the Com-
mittee 
on 
Banking, 
Housing, 
and 
Urban Affairs: 
To the Congress of the United States: 
Section 202(d) of the National Emer-
gencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)) provides 
for the automatic termination of a na-
tional emergency unless, within 90 
days before the anniversary date of its 
declaration, the President publishes in 
the Federal Register and transmits to 
the Congress a notice stating that the 
emergency is to continue in effect be-
yond the anniversary date. In accord-
ance with this provision, I have sent to 
the Federal Register for publication the 
enclosed notice stating that the na-
tional 
emergency 
with 
respect 
to 
transnational criminal organizations 
declared in Executive Order 13581 of 
July 24, 2011, is to continue in effect be-
yond July 24, 2020. 
The 
activities 
of 
significant 
transnational criminal organizations 
have reached such scope and gravity 
that they threaten the stability of 
international political and economic 
systems. Such organizations are be-
coming increasingly sophisticated and 
dangerous to the United States; they 
are increasingly entrenched in the op-
erations of foreign governments and 
the international financial system, 
thereby weakening democratic institu-
tions, degrading the rule of law, and 
undermining economic markets. These 
organizations facilitate and aggravate 
violent civil conflicts and increasingly 
facilitate the activities of other dan-
gerous persons. 
The 
activities 
of 
significant 
transnational criminal organizations 
continue to pose an unusual and ex-
traordinary threat to the national se-
curity, foreign policy, and economy of 
the United States. For these reasons, I 
have determined that it is necessary to 
continue the national emergency de-
clared in Executive Order 13581 with re-
spect to transnational criminal organi-
zations.

STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED 
BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTION 
By Mr. KAINE (for himself and 
Ms. MURKOWSKI): 
S. 4269. A bill to amend the Public 
Health Service Act to improve mater-
nal health and promote safe mother-
hood; to the Committee on Health, 
Education, Labor, and Pensions. 
Mr. KAINE. Mr. President. There are 
significant racial and ethnic inequities 
in maternal and infant mortality rates 
in the U.S. According to the CDC, the 
maternal mortality rate for non-His-
panic Black women in 2018 is more 
than 2.5 times higher than the mater-
nal mortality rate of non-Hispanic 
white women, and the infant mortality 
rate of non-Hispanic Black women is 
more than 2.3 times higher than the in-
fant mortality rate of non-Hispanic 
white women. Any pregnant woman 
choosing to have a child should be able 
to do so safely without regard to in-
come, race, ethnicity, employment sta-
tus, or any other socio-economic fac-
tor.’ 
This is why Senator MURKOWOSKI and 
I are introducing the Mothers and 
Newborns Success Act, which aims to 
reduce maternal and infant mortality, 
ensure that all infants can grow up 
healthy and safe, and protect women’s 
health before, during, and after preg-
nancy. Our legislation supports innova-
tion in maternal health delivery and 
improves data collection on maternal 
mortality and maternal deaths. The 
bill will help ensure that women are 
matched with birthing facilities that 
are risk-appropriate for their par-
ticular needs to improve maternal and 
neonatal care and outcomes. The legis-
lation strengthens support for women 
during the critical postpartum period, 
the year after birth, and will help en-
sure pregnant women get the vaccina-
tions they need and are aware of ma-
ternal health warning signs. The bill 
promotes maternal health research and 
the use of telehealth to help high-risk 
expectant mothers in geographically- 
isolated 
areas. 
The 
Mothers 
and 
Newborns Success Act is a significant 
step toward reducing racial, ethnic, 
and geographic inequities in maternal 
and infant health. I am glad that my 
colleague Rep. Terri Sewell will be in-
troducing companion legislation in the 
House of Representatives. 
Given COV1D–19’s disproportionate 
impact on communities of color and re-
cent research from the CDC which finds 
that pregnant women with COVID–19 
are more likely to be hospitalized and 
admitted to the ICU, this legislation is 
especially timely. 
No woman should fear for her or her 
child’s health because of her race. We 
need to ensure more women of color 
and their children, particularly Black 
women and children, receive equitable 
care. COVID–19 and its impact on preg-
nant women has only underscored the 
need for urgent action. By advancing 
evidence-based policies to improve ma-
ternal and infant health outcomes, this 
bill will work to reduce and eliminate 
preventable maternal and infant mor-
tality in the United States. I’m calling 
on my Senate colleagues to support 
this bill and include it in the next 
coronavirus relief package so we can 
enact positive systemic changes to 
make sure more women and newborns 
thrive and have the maximum chance 
for success. 
By Mr. THUNE (for himself and 
Mr. ENZI): 
S. 4275. A bill to require recipients of 
Pandemic Unemployment Assistance 
to provide employment documentation, 
and for other purposes; to the Com-
mittee on Finance. 
Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the text of the 
bill be printed in the RECORD. 
There being no objection, the text of 
the bill was ordered to be printed in 
the RECORD, as follows:

dents 
through 
eligible 
scholarship- 
granting organizations, and for other 
purposes; to the Committee on Fi-
nance. 
Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, 
today, Senator TIM
SCOTT
of South 
Carolina and I have introduced the 
School Choice Now Act, which does two 
things: It protects students who have 
been attending private schools from 
the heartbreaking loss of scholarships, 
and it gives families more options for 
their children’s education at a time 
that school is more important than 
ever. 
I have been working to find ways to 
help parents pursue the education that 
best meets their child’s needs for a 
long time, since 1979, when I began to 
be the Governor of Tennessee. 
In 1986, we Governors got together in 
something called Time for Results. I 
was chairman of the National Gov-
ernors Association. The vice chairman 
was the Arkansas Governor, Bill Clin-
ton, and we devoted the Governors’ at-
tention for an entire year to one sub-
ject—education. 
There were six points. One of those 
points way back then was to find ways 
to give parents more choices of schools 
for their children. 
Then, later on, in 1992, when Presi-
dent George H.W. Bush was in office 
and I was Education Secretary, I 
helped the President develop some-
thing we called the GI Bill for Kids, 
which was Federal funds for a $1,000 
scholarship to work with cities and 
States, like Milwaukee in Wisconsin, 
that were trying to give low-income 
families more choices of good schools 
for their children. 
Then, my last act as Education Sec-
retary was to notice what they call 
start-from-scratch 
schools 
in 
Min-
nesota, created by the Democratic- 
Farmer-Labor Party. There were about 
a dozen of them, as I remember, and I 
wrote every school district in the coun-
try and asked them to start one of 
these start-from-scratch schools, which 
were the forerunners of today’s public 
charter schools. Today, we have 7,500 
public charter schools. 
Then, in 2004, I tried something I 
called the Pell Grant for Kids, a $500 
scholarship that would follow every 
middle- and low-income child in Amer-
ica to an accredited program of their 
choosing. 
Some people said: Wait a minute. 
You can’t call the Pell grant a voucher. 
I said: That is precisely what the Pell 
grant is. The Pell grant is a voucher 
that a college student can take to any 
accredited college—public, private, or 
religious. Why can’t we do that for ele-
mentary and secondary schools? 
In 2005, we had a hurricane named 
Katrina, creating devastation on the 
gulf coast, and Senator Ted Kennedy 
and I and Senator Landrieu and others 
worked together to provide 1.2 billion 
Federal dollars in one-time emergency 
assistance for the 2005–2006 school year 
so students enrolled in public or non-
public schools—children who were dis-
placed by the hurricane—could enroll 
in public or private schools while their 
families recovered. They got scholar-
ships of up to $6,000. 
And, more recently, I suggested a 
Scholarship for Kids Act. I said: Why 
don’t we give a State like Tennessee, 
Ohio, or North Dakota, the opportunity 
to take most of the Federal dollars and 
turn them into scholarships for the 
lowest income students in their State? 
That scholarship would amount to 
$2,100 if we just took the existing 
money we had and spent it that way. 
So that is the strategy that we fol-
lowed in this country for many, many 
years, ever since 1944, with the GI bill 
for veterans. 
We all remember what that was. The 
veterans came home and a grateful na-
tion gave them a scholarship and said: 
Take it anywhere you want, to any col-
lege or accredited school. Take it to 
Notre Dame, take it to Yeshiva, take it 
to a historically Black college, take it 
to Ohio State, take it to Tennessee, 
take it to the Presbyterian school. 
And they have done that, and the GI 
bill may be one of the most certainly 
successful pieces of legislation ever en-
acted. 
Last year, there were over $28 billion 
in Federal Pell grants and more than 
$91 billion in Federal loans that fol-
lowed students to public and private 
colleges of their choice. 
Now, the Federal Government also 
provides vouchers to help pay for 
childcare. The Child Care and Develop-
ment Block Grant was negotiated by 
John Sununu when he was Chief of 
Staff for H.W. Bush in 1990, and what 
that does is basically give money to 
States, and States then give vouchers, 
just like Pell grants for college, but 
they give them to working moms, and 
they can go pick the childcare center 
that is best for their child. 
The Federal Government, in 2019, 
provided $8.7 billion and States another 
$1.2 to provide vouchers to 1.3 million 
children. 
So I think you can see where I am 
going with this. It is that the idea of 
giving parents choices of schools is not 
a new idea. We have done it in colleges 
since 1944. We do it with childcare. We 
do it in community colleges. Why not 
do it for elementary and secondary 
education? Why not give low-income 
families more of the same choices of 
good schools that wealthy families 
have? 
Now, during COVID–19, children in 
all K–12 schools have been affected by 
the disease. There are 100,000 public 
schools across our country serving 50 
million students. That are another 
35,000 private schools serving 5 million 
students. Many of those schools, public 
and private, are choosing not to reopen 
in person this fall. 
Many schools are failing to provide 
high-quality distance learning. The 
students who will suffer the most from 
this are the low-income children—the 
children from families where both par-
ents work away from home every day 
or where the only parent works away 
from home every day, children with no 
internet, families who can’t afford to 
put a child in a private school if the 
public school is not open. 
These are the parents who have the 
greatest need and the children who 
have the greatest need. We should ad-
dress that need as we think about how 
to deal with COVID–19. 
Just as more families need more op-
tions, there are fewer scholarships 
available to help them choose private 
schools because there has been less 
charitable giving as a result of the pan-
demic. 
So for low-income students attending 
private schools on a scholarship, that 
can mean a heartbreaking end to their 
time at school and a transfer to a new 
school that may not meet their needs 
at all. 
That is why Senator SCOTT and I and 
others of us recommend that Congress 
first provide sufficient funding for all 
of our schools—100,000 public schools 
and 35,000 private—so they can safely 
open this fall with as many students 
physically present as possible. 
I have suggested that the cost of this 
to the taxpayers could be as much as 
$70 billion. The House of Representa-
tives has appropriated $58 billion.

July 22, 2020 
If Congress were to agree on the 
higher number, $70 billion, that would 
be about $1,200 for every one of the 55 
million public and private school stu-
dents in the country. 
The School Choice Now Act that Sen-
ator SCOTT and I are offering is about 
the 5.7 million of those 55 million chil-
dren who attend the 35,000 nonpublic, 
private, or religious schools. It pro-
vides scholarships to students to have 
the opportunity to return to the pri-
vate school they attended before the 
pandemic and gives other students a 
new opportunity to attend private 
school by doing two things: One, pro-
viding one-time emergency funding for 
scholarship-granting 
organizations. 
These are nonprofits that do the impor-
tant work of helping students attend 
private schools in each State. These 
scholarship-granting organizations will 
use this one-time funding to provide 
families with direct educational assist-
ance, including private school tuition 
as well as homeschooling expenses. 
No. 2, this act would provide perma-
nent dollar-for-dollar Federal tax cred-
its for contributions to those scholar-
ship-granting organizations. What this 
means is that any American taxpayer 
who makes a charitable donation to 
one of these nonprofits that provide 
scholarships to students will receive a 
credit on their Federal taxes equal to 
the amount the taxpayer donated. The 
same goes for private companies that 
make donations to these organizations. 
The School Choice Now Act is not a 
Federal mandate. States are free to 
create their own tax credit scholarship 
programs that work for the unique 
needs of students in their States. 
States that don’t want to support 
scholarships to private schools are not 
required to accept these funds. They 
can be returned to the Secretary, and 
the funds will be redistributed to 
States that want the funds. 
This bill is about one of the great 
principles of what it means to be an 
American: the principle of equal oppor-
tunity. For me, equal opportunity 
means creating an environment in 
which the largest number of people can 
begin at the starting line. When every-
one is at the starting line in America, 
anything is possible. Giving children 
more opportunity to attend a better 
school is the real answer to inequality 
in America.

and Mr. KING) submitted the following 
resolution; which was referred to the 
Committee 
on 
Health, 
Education, 
Labor, and Pensions: 
S. RES. 655 
Whereas the United States ratified over 350 
treaties with sovereign indigenous commu-
nities, has broken the promises made in such 
treaties, and has historically failed to carry 
out its trust responsibilities to Native Amer-
icans, including American Indians, Alaska 
Natives, and Native Hawaiians, as made evi-
dent by the chronic and pervasive under-
funding of the Indian Health Service and 
Tribal, Urban Indian, and Native Hawaiian 
health care, the vast health and socio-
economic disparities faced by Native Amer-
ican people, and the inaccessibility of many 
Federal public health and social programs in 
Native American communities; 
Whereas people of Mexican and Puerto 
Rican 
descent, 
who 
became 
Americans 
through conquest, were subject to, but never 
full members of the polity of the United 
States and experienced widespread discrimi-
nation in employment, housing, education, 
and health care; 
Whereas the immoral paradox of slavery 
and freedom is an indelible wrong traced 
throughout the Nation’s history, as African 
Americans lived under the oppressive insti-
tution of slavery from 1619 through 1865, en-
dured the practices and laws of segregation 
during the Jim Crow Era, and continue to 
face the ramifications of systemic racism 
through unjust and discriminatory struc-
tures and policies; 
Whereas, before the enactment of the 
Medicare program, the United States’ health 
care system was highly segregated, and, as 
late as the mid-1960s, hospitals, clinics, and 
doctors’ offices throughout Northern and 
Southern States complied with Jim Crow 
laws and were completely segregated by 
race—leaving Black communities with little 
to no access to health care services; 
Whereas, between 1956 and 1967, the Na-
tional Association for the Advancement of 
Colored People (NAACP) Legal Defense and 
Education Fund litigated a series of court 
cases to eliminate discrimination in hos-
pitals and professional associations; 
Whereas the landmark case Simkins v. 
Moses H. Cone Memorial Hospital, 323 F.2d 
959 (1963), challenged the Federal Govern-
ment’s use of public funds to expand, sup-
port, and sustain segregated hospital care, 
and provided justification for title VI of the 
1964 Civil Rights Act and the Medicare hos-
pital 
certification 
program—establishing 
Medicare hospital racial integration guide-
lines that applied to every hospital that par-
ticipated in the Federal program; 
Whereas, in 1967, President Lyndon B. 
Johnson established the National Advisory 
Commission on Civil Disorders, which con-
cluded that white racism is responsible for 
the pervasive discrimination and segregation 
in employment, education, and housing, re-
sulting in deepened racial division and con-
tinued exclusion of Black communities from 
the benefits of economic progress; 
Whereas language minorities, including 
Latinos, Asian Americans, and Pacific Is-
landers, were not assured non-discriminatory 
access to Federally-funded services, includ-
ing health services, until the signing of Ex-
ecutive Order 13166 in 2000; 
Whereas the Patient Protection and Af-
fordable Care Act included provisions to ex-
pand the Medicaid program and—for the first 
time in the United States—established a 
Federal prohibition against discrimination 
on the basis of race, color, national origin, 
sex, age, or disability in certain health pro-
grams, building on other Federal civil rights 
laws; 
Whereas the Patient Protection and Af-
fordable Care Act required reporting to Con-
gress on health disparities based on race, 
color, national origin, sex, age, or disability; 
Whereas several Federal programs have 
been established to address some, but not all, 
of the health outcomes that are dispropor-
tionately experienced by communities of 
color, including sickle cell disease, tuber-
culosis, infant mortality, and HIV/AIDS; 
Whereas the National Center for Chronic 
Disease Prevention and Health Promotion 
works to raise awareness of health dispari-
ties faced by minority populations in the 
United States, such as Native Americans, 
Asian Americans, Black Americans, and 
Latino Americans, aiming to reduce risk fac-
tors for groups affected by such health dis-
parities; 
Whereas the United States’ health care 
system and other economic and social struc-
tures remain fraught with racism and racial, 
ethnic, sex (including sexual orientation and 
gender identity), and class biases that lead 
to health inequity and health disparities; 
Whereas life expectancy rates for Black 
and Native American people in the United 
States are significantly lower than those of 
white people in the United States; 
Whereas disparities in health outcomes are 
exacerbated for LGBTQIA+ people of color; 
Whereas disparities in health outcomes are 
worsened for people of color with disabilities 
due to bias and inequitable access to health 
care; 
Whereas several States with higher per-
centages of Black, Latino, and Native Amer-
ican populations have not expanded their 
Medicaid programs—continuing to disenfran-
chise minority communities from access to 
health care to this day; 
Whereas 16 States have failed to take ad-
vantage of the Federal option to expand ac-
cess to Medicaid and the Children’s Health 
Insurance Program to lawfully-residing im-
migrant children within the first 5 years of 
lawful status, and 26 States have failed to do 
so for similarly-situated pregnant women; 
Whereas, between 2016 and 2018, the child 
uninsured rate increased from 4.7 percent to 
5.2 percent and the Latino child uninsured 
rate increased from 7.7 percent to 8.1 per-
cent, and children of color are far more like-
ly to be uninsured than white children; 
Whereas a climate of fear and confusion for 
immigrant families due to the public charge 
rule discourages such families from enrolling 
eligible children in Medicaid and the Chil-
dren’s Health Insurance Program; 
Whereas Pacific Islanders from the Freely 
Associated States experience unique health 
disparities resulting from United States nu-
clear weapons tests on their home islands, 
but such people have been categorically de-
nied access to Medicaid and other Federal 
health benefits; 
Whereas the United States has historically 
facilitated outsider status toward Asian 
Americans and Pacific Islanders, such as the 
authorization of the internment of Japanese 
Americans during World War II, which re-
sulted in profound economic, social, and psy-
chological burdens for the people impacted; 
Whereas the history and persistence of rac-
ist and non-scientific medical beliefs are as-
sociated with ongoing racial disparities in 
treatment and health outcomes; 
Whereas implicit racial and ethnic biases 
within the health care system have an im-
pact on the quality of care experienced by 
communities of color, such as the under-
treatment of pain in Black patients; 
Whereas the historical context of unethical 
practices and abuses experienced by Black

patients and research participants, such as 
the Tuskegee Syphilis Study, serve as sym-
bols of the Black community’s mistrust of 
the medical system; 
Whereas women of color continue to face 
attacks, documented throughout history, on 
their prenatal, maternal, and reproductive 
health and rights; 
Whereas 
enslaved 
Black 
women 
were 
forced to endure egregiously unethical and 
cruel treatment, as subjects of insidious 
medical experiments, to advance modern 
gynecology; 
Whereas, through the late 1960s and early 
1980s, physicians routinely sterilized people 
of color, performing excessive and medically 
unnecessary procedures on patients of color 
without their informed consent; 
Whereas 
Black 
and 
Native 
American 
women are 2 to 4 times more likely than 
white women to suffer severe maternal mor-
bidity or die of pregnancy-related complica-
tions, and implicit racial biases and lower 
quality care are contributing factors to the 
health care disparities that lead to these 
outcomes; 
Whereas Black and Native American in-
fants are twice as likely to die as white in-
fants, and the Black infant mortality rate in 
the United States is higher than in 97 coun-
tries worldwide; 
Whereas researchers have developed the 
analytical framework of ‘‘weathering’’ to de-
scribe how the constant stress of racism 
leads to poor health outcomes for Black 
Americans; 
Whereas the daily experience of racism is 
associated with stress, depression, and anx-
iety, and may cause physiological reactivity 
or contribute to chronic health conditions; 
Whereas racism is linked to mental health 
challenges for children and adolescents; 
Whereas children of color are overrepre-
sented in the United States child welfare 
system, and up to 80 percent of children in 
foster care enter State custody with signifi-
cant mental health challenges; 
Whereas disparities in educational access 
and attainment, along with racism experi-
enced in the educational setting, affect the 
trajectory of academic achievement for chil-
dren and adolescents, and ultimately impact 
health and racial inequities in school dis-
cipline, which has long-term consequences 
for children; 
Whereas racism and segregation in the 
United States contribute to poor health out-
comes by segregating Black, Latino, and Na-
tive American communities from oppor-
tunity; 
Whereas, for decades, discriminatory hous-
ing practices, such as redlining, systemically 
excluded people of color from housing, rob-
bing them of capital in the form of low-cost, 
stable mortgages and opportunities to build 
wealth, and the Federal government used its 
financial power to segregate renters in 
newly-built public housing; 
Whereas environmental injustices, such as 
proximity and exposure to toxic waste or 
hazardous air pollutants, continue to harm 
the health of communities of color, low-in-
come communities, and Indigenous commu-
nities around the Nation; 
Whereas social inequities such as differing 
access to quality health care, healthy food 
and safe drinking water, safe neighborhoods, 
education, job security, and reliable trans-
portation affect health risks and outcomes; 
Whereas, during the COVID–19 pandemic, 
the effects of racism and discrimination are 
seen in COVID–19 infection, hospitalization, 
and mortality rates—disproportionately high 
among Black, Latino, and Native American 
populations compared to the overall popu-
lation—exacerbating health disparities and 
highlighting barriers to care for Black, 
Latino, and Native American patients across 
the United States; 
Whereas, because of racial and ethnic dis-
parities, people of color are more likely to 
have pre-existing, preventable, and chronic 
conditions, which lead to higher COVID–19 
morbidity and mortality rates; 
Whereas people of color are overrepre-
sented in the number of people in the United 
States living under poor air quality condi-
tions, which can increase the likelihood of 
COVID–19 morbidity and mortality; 
Whereas the COVID–19 pandemic has wors-
ened barriers for Black, Latino, and Native 
American households that suffer from dis-
proportionately higher rates of food insecu-
rity; 
Whereas Black and Latino workers make 
up a disproportionate number of frontline 
workers, are less likely to receive paid sick 
leave or have the ability to work from home, 
and have been excluded from many forms of 
relief readily available to other groups; 
Whereas people of color are disproportion-
ately impacted by the criminal justice and 
immigration enforcement systems and face a 
higher risk of contracting COVID–19 within 
prison populations and detention centers due 
to the over-incarceration of people of color; 
Whereas, during the COVID–19 pandemic, 
an increased use of anti-Asian rhetoric has 
resulted in Asian Americans being harassed, 
assaulted, and scapegoated for the pandemic; 
Whereas communities of color continue to 
bear the burdens of inequitable social, eco-
nomic, and criminal justice policies, prac-
tices, and investments that cause deep dis-
parities, hurt, harm, danger, and mistrust; 
Whereas over 40 percent of Latinos report 
being discriminated against or harassed be-
cause they are Hispanic; 
Whereas approximately 24 percent of the 
Latino population in the United States iden-
tifies as ‘‘Afro-Latino’’ and is thus poten-
tially subject to both race and national ori-
gin discrimination; 
Whereas, because of racism, Black people 
in the United States share a unique set of 
challenges and experiences that require 
heightened levels of awareness and risk 
while performing everyday tasks—such as 
jogging in neighborhoods, driving while 
Black, or playing in a park—that are not ex-
perienced by other populations; 
Whereas Black people in the United States 
are 3 times more likely to be killed by police 
than white people in the United States, and 
police violence is the 6th leading cause of 
death for young Black men; 
Whereas the police brutality and violence 
experienced by Black people in the United 
States adversely impacts mental health 
among Black communities; 
Whereas Black communities led the Nation 
in mourning the killings of Ahmaud Arbery, 
Breonna 
Taylor, 
George 
Floyd, 
Elijah 
McClain, and countless other Black Ameri-
cans—calling 
for 
justice 
and 
long-term 
changes to dismantle systems of oppression; 
Whereas throughout our Nation’s history, 
people of color have been at the forefront of 
civil rights movements for essential free-
doms, human rights, and equal protection for 
marginalized groups and continue to fight 
for racial and economic justice today; 
Whereas a public health issue is defined as 
meeting the following 4 criteria: 
(1) The condition affects many people, is 
seen as a threat to the public, and is con-
tinuing to increase. 
(2) The condition is distributed unfairly. 
(3) Preventive measures could reduce the 
effects of the condition. 
(4) Those preventive measures are not yet 
in place; 
Whereas racism meets the criteria of a 
public health crisis, and public health ex-
perts agree; 
Whereas a Federal public health crisis dec-
laration defines racism as a pervasive health 
issue and alerts the Nation to the need to 
enact immediate and effective cross-govern-
mental efforts to address the root causes of 
institutional racism and their downstream 
impacts; and 
Whereas such declaration requires the re-
sponse of the Government to engage signifi-
cant resources to empower those commu-
nities that are impacted: Now, therefore, be 
it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) supports the resolutions drafted, intro-
duced, and adopted by cities and localities 
across the Nation declaring racism a public 
health crisis; 
(2) declares racism a public health crisis in 
the United States; 
(3) commits to— 
(A) establishing a nationwide strategy to 
address 
health 
disparities 
and 
inequity 
across all sectors in society; 
(B) dismantling systemic practices and 
policies that perpetuate racism; 
(C) advancing reforms to address years of 
neglectful and apathetic policies that have 
led to poor health outcomes for communities 
of color; and 
(D) promoting efforts to address the social 
determinants 
of 
health—especially 
for 
Black, Latino, and Native American people 
in the United States, and other people of 
color; and 
(4) places a charge on the Nation to move 
forward with urgency to ensure that the 
United States stands firmly in honoring its 
moral purpose of advancing the self-evident 
truths that all people are created equal, that 
they are endowed with certain unalienable 
rights, and that among these are life, lib-
erty, and the pursuit of happiness.

the following resolution; which was re-

S. RES. 656 
Whereas the blueberry is a fruit native to 
North America; 
Whereas blueberries were first— 
(1) managed and harvested as wild blue-
berries by the native Wabanaki through spe-
cialized burning practices that are still used 
in 2020; and 
(2) used fresh and dried in food and medi-
cines by Native Americans, who introduced 
blueberries to early colonists, which led to 
new uses and forms of blueberries, including 
frozen, establishing traditions still observed 
in 2020; 
Whereas the pioneering work conducted in 
New Jersey in the early 1900s by Elizabeth 
White and Dr. Frederick Coville, a botanist 
at the Department of Agriculture, to domes-
ticate wild lowbush blueberries resulted in 
the development of the hybrid for cultivated 
highbush blueberries; 
Whereas, because of those early efforts, 
highbush blueberries are large, sweet, juicy 
berries that can be commercially produced 
and shipped; 
Whereas wild blueberries— 
(1) are small and sweet; and 
(2) are not planted, but still grow and are 
harvested where they have naturally oc-
curred for thousands of years;

IN HONOR OF THE LIFE OF CHIEF 
SHAWN BABENDURE 
HON. KEVIN BRADY 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, July 22, 2020 
Mr. BRADY. Madam Speaker, I rise to 
honor 
the 
life 
and 
service 
of 
Shawn 
Babendure, a husband, father, coach, U.S. 
Army veteran and District Chief of the Spring, 
Texas Fire Department who tragically passed 
away this week much too young and far too 
early. 
A native Texan, born and raised in Houston, 
Shawri leaves a legacy of a lifetime of service 
to his community and his country which began 
when Shawn joined the Champions Fire De-
partment in 1990 while attending Cypress 
Creek High School. 
His service continued when he enlisted in 
the United States Army in 1993. He served 
honorably and well for nearly four years as a 
Communications Repair Specialist with the 
11th Armored Cavalry Regiment at Fort Irwin, 
California, the Army’s National Training Cen-
ter. He distinguished himself as an expert 
marksman and earned his paratrooper wings. 
He was awarded the National Defense Service 
Medal, the Good Conduct Medal, the Army 
Achievement Medal, and the Army Com-
mendation Medal for his service. 
Shortly after his military service, Shawn 
earned his Bachelor of Science degree from 
the University of Houston. Shawn worked in 
the financial services industry where he 
served as Vice President of Wealth Manage-
ment for a global wealth management firm, a 
position he still held at the time of his death. 
In 2007, Shawn chose to serve his commu-
nity once again and returned to public service 
as a fireman at the Spring Fire Department. 
Shawn’s work ethic and professionalism were 
evidenced by his promotion to positions of in-
creasing responsibility at the Spring Fire De-
partment where he impressively earned more 
than ten professional certificates for every 
facet of fire, rescue and emergency service 
and rose in rank from fireman to District Chief. 
Shawn’s love for his community and his 
contagious laughter were hallmarks of his per-
sonality and his service and he passed on his 
care and compassion for others by training 
and mentoring the next generation of fire-
fighters. 
I join the entire Spring community in hon-
oring Chief Babendure’s lifetime of service and 
join his wife, Jessica, and their children, So-
phia and Harrison, in mourning their loss. 
Chief Babendure will be deeply mourned and 
greatly missed.

WILLIAM M. (MAC) THORNBERRY 
NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZA-
TION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2021 
SPEECH OF 
HON. JOHN GARAMENDI 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, July 20, 2020 
Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Speaker, today I rise 
in support of the fiscal year 2021 National De-
fense Authorization Act (NDAA). I would like to 
start by thanking Chairman SMITH, Ranking 
Member THORNBERRY, and the House Armed 
Services Committee staff who have worked 
many long nights putting together this year’s 
NDAA. The bill that is before the House is a 
good bill and I encourage my colleagues to 
support its passage. 
As the Chairman of the Readiness Sub-
committee, I believe the bill upholds our re-
sponsibility to provide congressional oversight 
of and support to the sustainment, logistics, in-
frastructure, and readiness of our military. I’d 
like to take a moment and thank my staff for 
their 
tireless 
work—the 
Readiness 
Sub-
committee 
staff, 
Brian 
Garrett, 
Jeanine 
Womble, Melanie Harris, Jay Vallario, John 
Muller, Dave Sienicki, and Sean Falvey, and 
my personal staff, Bradley Bottoms, Betsy 
Thompson, 
Marcus 
Jones, 
and 
Danusia 
Hubah. I am proud of the Readiness Sub-
committee’s contribution to this year’s bill and 
I’d like to highlight the following provisions. 
The Readiness portion of the bill continues 
to 
emphasize 
the 
need 
to 
address 
vulnerabilities in installation and energy resil-
iency, both in response to climate change and 
to ensure the Department can continue to op-
erate when fuel supplies and utilities are dis-
rupted. The bill: 
requires the Department to report on efforts 
to consider fuel consumption, distribution, and 
logistics and the steps being taken to de-
crease consumption of fossil fuels by 30 per-
cent to reduce the number of resupply con-
voys and oilers required in a contested envi-
ronment; 
requires the Department to institute energy 
metering on critical military facilities to assess 
their energy requirements and to ensure resil-
ient power sources for these facilities. 
strengthens an existing preference for the 
purchase of electric or hybrid vehicles for offi-
cial business on military installations; and 
requires a report on the implementation of 
provisions from last year’s NDAA to include in-
stallation master planning, updates to building 
codes, sea-level rise modeling, and climate 
assessment tools. 
Last year’s NDAA made sweeping reforms 
in response to concerns that courageous mili-
tary families raised regarding the manage-
ment, oversight, and condition of military fam-
ily housing. This year, we pick up where we 
left off. The bill: 
requires a report on known environmental 
hazards in government-owned housing and re-
quires the Department to report on the feasi-
bility of standardizing privatized housing per-
formance metrics; and 
requires partners to put funding of mainte-
nance and recapitalization of housing units 
ahead of fees that enrich corporate manage-
ment in all future and renegotiated privatized 
housing agreements. 
Similarly, we build on previous efforts to ad-
dress PFAS contamination around military in-
stallations. The bill: 
requires the Department of Defense to notify 
the congressional defense committees when 
there has been an uncontrolled release of a 
PFAS-containing firefighting agent that may 
impact human health or the environment; 
requires the Department of Defense to pub-
lish on a public website the results of drinking 
and ground water PFAS testing conducted on 
military installations or former defense sites; 
makes technical corrections to ensure all 
National Guard installations are eligible for 
funding for PFAS remediation in our National 
Guard communities; and 
requires the Department to survey and re-
port on technologies that will help facilitate the 
on-time phase-out of PFAS containing fire-
fighting agents. 
While the Department of Defense talks a lot 
about modernization and development of new 
capabilities, we must ensure that the appro-
priate focus remains on the sustainment of 
these weapon systems and the logistics re-
quired to move and supply them in a conflict. 
To that end, the bill: 
requires the Department to examine and pe-
riodically report on the sustainment and logis-
tics requirements, gaps, and mitigations nec-
essary to support force structure, power pro-
jection, and other elements of the national de-
fense strategy; 
helps ensure Congress continues to receive 
timely and relevant information regarding both

domestic and overseas infrastructure require-
ments and posture of U.S. forces; and re-
quires a report on bulk fuel management strat-
egies in the Indo-Pacific to meet current and 
future requirements. 
In partnership with the Government Ac-
countability Office, the bill leverages their ex-
pertise to assist the subcommittee with contin-
ued oversight on topics that include F–35 op-
erations and sustainment, Air Force use of 
contract air support services, and aviation and 
ship maintenance. The previous reports and 
analytical work produced by GAO helped in-
form the Readiness mark and I’d like to take 
this opportunity to thank the members of the 
GAO’s Defense Capabilities and Management 
team for their support of this subcommittee’s 
oversight work. 
Next, the health and safety of our military 
and civilian personnel remain a priority for this 
subcommittee. Following a review of a number 
of fatal ground vehicle training mishaps, the 
subcommittee is concerned that the Depart-
ment’s approach to collecting, reporting, and 
analyzing vehicle mishap data may be insuffi-
cient and hampers the ability to share lessons 
learned or put in place mitigations to prevent 
future mishaps. To that end, the bill includes 
a reporting requirement that will help clarify re-
sponsibilities for collecting and analyzing mis-
hap data, how data is being used to identify 
mishap trends, and actions the Department is 
taking to standardize data collection. 
In addition to concerns with ground vehicle 
mishaps, the committee has identified critical 
failures and safety issues in the munitions en-
terprise. To start addressing these concerns, 
the bill requires a report on munitions safety 
waivers and mishaps, an assessment of the 
resilience of the munitions enterprise, and 
clarifies the role and authority of the Chairman 
of the Defense Explosives Safety Board. 
The bill also supports the civilian workforce 
of the Department of Defense by addressing a 
pay disparity affecting the Department’s wage- 
grade civilian workforce and including non-title 
5 employees who were left out of last year’s 
Paid Parental Leave provision. 
This year’s NDAA also begins a unified, 
whole-of-government approach that leverages 
the best attributes of the government and 
commercial fleets to increase resiliency in our 
maritime logistics. The bill includes several 
provisions, that together, establish a National 
Maritime Logistics Fleet approach by strength-
ening U.S.-flagged vessel requirements for the 
transportation of military cargo and fuels, cre-
ating a Tanker Security Program to address 
the shortfall in U.S.-flagged, U.S.-crewed tank-
ers, and requiring the Navy to initiate an af-
fordable, domestic built sealift ship. Strength-
ening our maritime logistics will also enhance 
our military’s capabilities by improving the 
over-arching defense industrial base that sup-
ports each branch of our armed services. 
Additionally, this year’s NDAA supports the 
missions at Travis and Beale Air Force Bases 
in my district. The funds authorized in this bill 
will support the new KC–46 mission at Travis 
Air Force Base and enable Beale Air Force 
Base to continue to support intelligence, sur-
veillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) and multi- 
domain operations. 
I’m also pleased this NDAA includes a 3 
percent pay raise for our troops and includes 
language from two of my bills, H.R. 2617, the 
Occupational and Environmental Transparency 
Health Act, to require the DOD and VA to 
retroactively update records based on informa-
tion contained in the Burn Pit Registry, since 
many veterans’ health records do not account 
for their exposures, and H.R. 4710, the Phar-
maceutical Independence Long-Term Readi-
ness Reform Act, to require the DOD to iden-
tify the vulnerabilities faced by our country’s 
dependence on Chinese pharmaceuticals and 
the steps needed to secure the supply chain. 
This bill helps advance our military’s near- 
term readiness goals and drives the Depart-
ment to plan for and take action against long- 
term threats, and with that, I urge my col-
leagues to support the FY21 NDAA.

CELEBRATING 
MARGARET 
AND 
SYLVESTER 
WALORSKI 
ON 
THEIR 65TH WEDDING ANNIVER-
SARY 
HON. JACKIE WALORSKI 
OF INDIANA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, July 22, 2020 
Mrs. WALORSKI. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize Margaret and Sylvester 
‘‘Syl’’ Walorski of Englewood, Colorado, on 
their 65th wedding anniversary. 
Margaret and Syl met at a U.S.O. dance in 
the summer of 1951 just before Syl left for the 
Korean War. Placing their love in God’s 
hands, Margaret and Syl sent each other 
countless letters during Syl’s deployment and 
could not wait to be reunited. Syl returned to 
the U.S. and presented Margaret with a ring 
and a marriage proposal as soon as he could. 
They were married on August 22, 1955. 
To finish school and secure a bright future 
for his family, Syl moved with Margaret to 
South Bend, Indiana, where they had two chil-
dren. However, having briefly stayed at a mili-
tary base in Colorado after being discharged, 
Syl felt drawn to the state’s breathtaking sites, 
fresh air, and freedom. So in 1958 the couple 
moved to Englewood, Colorado, where they 
continued to grow their family and build a 
beautiful life together. A true embodiment of 
the American Dream, Margaret and Syl bought 
their first home in 1959 and have lived there 
ever since. 
Sixty-five years of marriage is a marvelous 
accomplishment that speaks volumes about 
their compassion and the tremendous founda-
tion of respect, gratitude, and faith they share 
with one another. Stronger together, Margaret 
and Syl have found the more love they have 
for each other, the more they have to offer 
others. They have always been active in their 
church and community, and their children 
watched as they led their lives in service to 
the Lord and as shining examples of the 
American spirit. 
Their lasting commitment not only to each 
other but also to their five children, 15 grand-
children, and 17 great-grandchildren is rooted 
in their devotion and faithfulness. Having dedi-
cated themselves to teaching their children 
strong American values, like working hard and 
giving back to those in need, they have 
touched the lives of countless people in their 
community and across the country. I feel 
blessed to know such compassionate, tena-
cious, and whole-hearted people who make 
this nation and the world a better place with 
everything they do. 
Madam Speaker, I would like to extend my 
sincerest congratulations to Aunt Margaret, 
Uncle Syl, and their entire family. It is my 
hope that their love continues to grow stronger 
with each passing year.

REMEMBERING 
THE 
ACHIEVE-
MENTS OF ENTERTAINER AND 
PUBLIC 
SERVANT 
SHIRLEY 
D. 
LOVE 
HON. CAROL D. MILLER 
OF WEST VIRGINIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, July 22, 2020 
Mrs. MILLER. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to posthumously recognize, Mr. Shirley Love. 
Shirley was born to Earl and Winona Love on 
May 15, 1933. The name ‘‘Shirley’’ was sug-
gested by the Love’s family nurse, for his re-
semblance to her husband, Shirley Donnelly. 
Shirley Donnelley was a popular West Virginia 
newspaper columnist during the 1930’s; unbe-
knownst to Earl and Winona at the time, their 
naming of their child not only passed on the 
uniqueness of the Shirley namesake but also 
a destiny for media greatness. 
Shirley Love always had a phenomenal 
voice. Before he was entertaining countless 
West Virginians on Radio & TV, he used his 
voice to serve God every Sunday in Oak Hill 
United Methodist Church’s Choir. The owner 
of WOAY in the early 1950’s was Robert 
Thomas. He was a member of the church’s 
congregation and always paid close attention 
to the charm of Shirley’s voice. After Shirley 
graduated Collins High School in 1952, Robert 
Thomas offered him a once-in-a-life-time-op-
portunity as an announcer on his Network. 
Shirley accepted and quickly became the face 
of WOAY TV & Radio. 
Shirley served WOAY and entertained the 
people of West Virginia from 1952 to 1997. He 
was best known for becoming one of Southern 
West Virginia’s first TV nightly news anchors. 
He also hosted several programs through 
WOAY, including Friday Night Barn Dance, 
West Virginia Band Stand, and Saturday Night 
Wrestling. Of these, Saturday Night Wrestling 
was the most popular. Shirley kept audiences 
watching for decades through the way he han-
dled fan interviews and intense competitor 
interactions. 
Shirley was appointed to represent West 
Virginia’s Senate District 11 in 1994 by Gov-
ernor Caperton. He later retired from WOAY in 
1997 and began to focus fully on public serv-
ice rather than entertainment. Between 1994 
and 2008, Shirley was elected and subse-
quently re-elected to Senate District 11 three 
times. He was later elected to the West Vir-
ginia House of Delegates from 2016 to 2018. 
Between both Chambers, Shirley selflessly 
served the people of Fayette County in the 
West Virginia Legislature for sixteen years. I 
had the honor of working along side him in the 
House of Delegates. I witnessed first-hand his 
integrity, honesty, and straight forwardness in 
the Legislature. He was truly a man of the 
people. 
A list of Shirley’s other accomplishments in-
cludes—One of West Virginia’s Representa-
tives to the National Democratic Convention 
from 1972 to 2016, Fayette County Demo-
cratic Executive Committee Member, West Vir-
ginia State Democratic Executive Committee 
Member, Member of the West Virginia Broad-
casting Hall of Fame, one of Saturday Night 
Live’s first guests in America, a lifetime mem-
ber of the Oak Hill United Methodist Church, 
husband, and father to three children. 
May God bless Shirley Dean Love. I wish I 
could thank him for all he did for the great 
State of West Virginia. He will always be re-
membered by his family, friends, and the 
countless people he impacted throughout his 
life. I send my sincerest condolences to his 
wife, children, and grandchildren.

TRIBUTE TO NOHA KOLKAILAH— 
CALIFORNIA’S 
24TH 
CONGRES-
SIONAL WOMEN OF THE YEAR 
HON. SALUD O. CARBAJAL 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, July 22, 2020 
Mr. CARBAJAL. Madam Speaker, each 
year, through the Women of the Year Award, 
my office extends special recognition to 
women on the Central Coast who have made 
a difference in our community. I would like to 
recognize one outstanding Women of the Year 
Award recipient, Noha Kolkailah of Arroyo 
Grande, California. 
Noha currently serves as the Principal and 
Director of Olive Grove Charter School in San 
Luis Obispo. She has been a fierce champion 
for education and social justice for many 
years. After the 2016 election, Noha mobilized 
the Muslim community to speak out for a posi-
tive and just future for all people at the Wom-
en’s March SLO. The following year, she orga-
nized a ‘‘Get to Know Your Muslim Neighbors’’ 
event attended by over 800 people, advo-
cating for compassion, kindness, commitment 
to diversity and unity, global awareness, and 
responsibility. She also helped start the Mus-
lim Student Association at Cal Poly. 
Noha founded the Peace Academy of the 
Sciences and Arts, which offers an enriching 
summer program for children ages 6 to 11, 
with a focus on self-awareness, global citizen-
ship, social justice, and environmental aware-
ness. Through real-world applications, stu-
dents are empowered to learn more about 
each other, embrace differences, and learn 
how to build on each other’s strengths in a 
way that inspires creative innovation. 
Despite experiencing prejudice, Noha re-
mains a compassionate advocate for a world 
in which we can co-exist in peace and har-
mony, and leads with her heart, courage and 
kindness. She is a strong Muslim woman and 
she is not afraid to speak her truth, setting the 
example for others to do the same. 
Her work on the Central Coast in educating 
the community at large on the issues 
marginalized communities face, her tireless ef-
forts to bring people together in understanding 
and accepting differences, and her resilience 
in facing adversity with grace make Noha a 
wonderful asset to our community. As a cham-
pion for youth, women, and the marginalized, 
we are so lucky to have Noha in our district. 
I ask all Members to join me today in honoring 
an exceptional woman of California’s 24th 
Congressional District, Noha Kolkailah, for her 
incredible service to her community.

TRIBUTE TO REV. DR. C.T. VIVIAN 
HON. DANNY K. DAVIS 
OF ILLINOIS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, July 22, 2020 
Mr. DANNY K. DAVIS of Illinois. Madam 
Speaker, C.T. Vivian was a key member of Dr. 
King’s leadership group at SCBC during the 
height of the movement. He began his activ-
ism in Peoria, Illinois and as many others tal-
ented activist oriented individuals did, he 
found his way to Dr. King and became a val-
ued member of the team. 
Rev. C.T. was a fiery orator who lead 
marches, motivated and inspired crowds and 
was activity engaged in strategy development. 
He was viciously attached by an Alabama 
Sheriff, but held his ground. C.T., as we fondly 
called him, came to Chicago and helped de-
velop the Black Strategy Center with Dr. Ar-
chie Hargraves, Chester Robinson, Rev. 
Jesse Jackson and others. 
I got to know Rev. Vivian in 1975, when a 
group of us spent a month in Nairobi, Kenya

on a study colloquium for a doctoral disserta-
tion writing. Rev. Vivian spent the rest of 
preaching developing social change programs 
and being engaged in activities designed to 
help make the work a better place in which to 
live. Living during the same time as Rev. C.T. 
Vivian and knowing him and his work has 
been gratifying and inspirational. 
He was a great contributor to positive 
change in America and may he rest in peace.

WILLIAM M. (MAC) THORNBERRY 
NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZA-
TION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2021 
SPEECH OF 
HON. PETER A. DeFAZIO 
OF OREGON 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, July 20, 2020 
Mr. DEFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I will vote in 
support of H.R. 6395, the William M. (Mac) 
Thornberry National Defense Authorization Act 
(NDAA) for Fiscal Year (FY) 2021. Make no 
mistake: I have opposed NDAA legislation in 
previous years, and I still have concerns about 
a number of provisions included in this year’s 
legislation, but this year’s Democratic-led leg-
islation also contains numerous policy prior-
ities that I strongly support. 
First, this legislation grants our men and 
women in uniform a well-deserved pay raise of 
3 percent. This is the very least we can do for 
those who continue to make extraordinary 
sacrifices for our country. 
As Chair of the Transportation and Infra-
structure Committee, I fought to successfully 
include vital provisions important to Oregon 
coastal communities. This includes the Mari-
time Transportation System Emergency Relief 
Act, which authorizes the Maritime Administra-
tion to provide financial assistance to stabilize 
and ensure the reliable functioning of the U.S. 
Maritime Transportation System in the event 
of a national emergency or disaster, as well as 
the Elijah E. Cummings Coast Guard Author-
ization Act of 2020, legislation to authorize 
funds for, reinforce, and support the United 
States Coast Guard. 
Given the Transportation and Infrastructure 
Committee’s jurisdiction over the Federal Avia-
tion Administration (FAA), I am proud that this 
legislation makes a long-overdue correction to 
ensure that the more than 45,000 FAA em-
ployees, as well as VA and other federal civil-
ian employees who were inexcusably left out 
of last year’s bill, receive twelve weeks of paid 
parental leave. I am also pleased that this leg-
islation prohibits the Department of Defense 
from excluding any civilian employees from 
their collective bargaining rights. 
As a long-time advocate for strengthening 
Congress’s constitutional authority to declare 
war and limiting executive authority to engage 
in armed conflict without Congress’s consent, 
I strongly support this bill’s provisions to pro-
hibit U.S. participation in the Saudi-led coali-
tion’s war in Yemen without congressional au-
thorization. I also voted in strong support of an 
amendment which was adopted to prohibit 
President Trump’s dangerous and unneces-
sary proposals to initiate new nuclear weap-
ons testing. 
Given President Trump’s ongoing and dis-
turbing use of force on peaceful protesters ex-
ercising their First Amendment rights—includ-
ing his use of National Guard service mem-
bers to quell peaceful protesters outside the 
White House—I am pleased that an amend-
ment which I voted for, and which was adopt-
ed, will add crucial oversight and transparency 
guardrails when a President deploys active 
duty military within the United States. I am 
also a strong supporter of this legislation’s 
provision to require federal law enforcement 
officers deployed in response to public pro-
tests to visibly display their name and agency 
on their uniform. This requirement is especially 
crucial given Trump’s appalling use of uniden-
tifiable federal agents and unmarked vehicles 
to detain peaceful protesters in Portland, Or-
egon. 
I am pleased this legislation includes provi-
sions to bolster our country’s COVID–19 re-
sponse, including granting important funding 
for the Maritime Security Program (MSP) to 
enable MSP carriers to keep their ships fully 
crewed despite the lack of cargo as a result of 
COVID–19. To further increase our country’s 
pandemic preparedness and response, this 
legislation establishes a Pandemic Prepared-
ness and Resilience National Security Fund 
and provides additional funding to the Depart-
ment 
of 
Defense’s 
(DOD’s) 
Cooperative 
Threat Reduction Program to focus on detect-
ing and confronting biological threats. I also 
strongly support an amendment—which I co-
sponsored—to ensure the president finally 
uses the Defense Production Act to its full ex-
tent in order to meet our country’s most critical 
needs to combat COVID–19, including secur-
ing vital personal protective equipment, testing 
supplies, and more for our frontline healthcare 
workers and citizens in Oregon and across the 
country. 
Furthermore, this legislation accelerates the 
closure of the Guantanamo Bay detention fa-
cility by lifting a restriction on transfer of cur-
rent detainees. This unnecessary prison—esti-
mated to be the most expensive in the world— 
costs approximately $540 million each year to 
house 40 prisoners and has been used as a 
top recruiting tool by terrorists. This prison has 
been a black eye for the U.S., eroding rela-
tionships with our allies, undermining U.S. 
missions abroad, and putting U.S. troops and 
citizens at risk of retaliation. 
While Congress must do much more to 
achieve racial justice in this country, H.R. 
6395 takes first steps to move closer to this 
goal. I am pleased that H.R. 6395 takes the 
long-overdue action of requiring the DOD to 
change the names of all military bases and in-
frastructure named for Confederate individuals 
within one year, prohibits display of the Con-
federate flag on DOD installations, and adds 
diversity requirements for DOD military and ci-
vilian personnel. 
This legislation includes hundreds-of-millions 
in funding for the construction of additional 
housing and barracks for training and enlisted 
personnel, as well as for oversight and im-
provement of the Military Housing Privatization 
Initiative (MHPI) program. The bill also in-
cludes a number of provisions to support the 
education of military dependent students, 
childcare services for military dependent chil-
dren, and maternity uniforms for pregnant 
servicemembers. The NDAA. also continues 
Congress’s work to address the military’s cul-
ture of sexual misconduct by including provi-
sions to enhance the prevention of and re-
sponse to incidents of sexual trauma. 
Far too many of our veterans, especially 
those that served in Iraq and Afghanistan, are 
grappling with the serious medical complica-
tions linked to burn pits. While I believe Con-
gress can and must do more to care for these 
veterans, I am pleased that this legislation 
takes modest steps to improve the identifica-
tion of and care for veterans exposed to burn 
pits. 
I am also pleased this bill includes provi-
sions to assist student loan borrowers who 
have privately held debt, providing $10,000 in 
immediate assistance to pay down the student 
loan. These students received no financial re-
lief under the CARES Act. This provision will 
ensure the 200,000 servicemembers who owe 
nearly $3 billion in student loan debt receive 
some form of student debt relief during the 
pandemic. 
This bill includes necessary provisions that 
help to address PFAS and PFOA contamina-
tion on military bases that pose a public health 
threat to our military members and Americans 
living near installations. It requires the DOD to 
make public vital information about the level of 
PFAS contaminates in drinking water and 
groundwater at these sites. Although more can 
always be done to protect our environment, 
the bill makes an effort to fund climate change 
research initiatives and includes several public 
lands bills that will help to preserve and pro-
tect parts of America’s wilderness for genera-
tions to come. It also makes strides toward 
protecting our most spectacular natural treas-
ures, like ensuring the area around the Grand 
Canyon will not be polluted or scarred by min-
ing. 
While I strongly support many provisions in 
this year’s NDAA, I believe this legislation 
should have included additional provisions to 
rein in our bloated and wasteful defense 
spending, take back Congress’s constitutional 
war powers authority, and more. 
I believe this legislation could have made 
responsible cuts to our defense budget without 
jeopardizing the safety of our troops or under-
mining our national security. For years, Con-
gress has continued to increase the Penta-
gon’s budget despite overwhelming evidence 
of its waste and abuse of taxpayer money. 
That’s why I supported an amendment to re-
sponsibly reduce the Pentagon budget while 
retaining exceptions to protect service mem-
bers, civilian employees, and the vital Defense 
Health Program from this reduction. 
In particular, I have always opposed the 
DOD’s 
Overseas 
Contingency 
Operations 
(OCO) account, a fiscally irresponsible fund 
that is not counted in the budget, recklessly 
adds to our mounting debt, and has no con-
gressional/oversight. OCO is a Pentagon slush 
fund that gives a blank check to fund endless 
wars that Congress hasn’t authorized. I will 
continue fighting to finally eliminate this irre-
sponsible fund. 
I have long supported a financial audit of 
the Pentagon. Unlike every other federal

agency, the DOD has yet to pass a financial 
audit. For two years in a row, the Pentagon 
has spectacularly failed full audits, both of 
which highlighted numerous examples of 
waste and abuse. It is ridiculous to provide the 
Pentagon a massive spending increase—as 
this bill does—when the Pentagon cannot 
even account for how it spends taxpayer 
money. That’s why I offered an amendment to 
require and incentivize each DOD component 
to pass an audit by FY25. Unfortunately, my 
amendment did not receive a vote. 
Along with Yemen, I believe this legislation 
should have included more provisions to take 
back Congress’s constitutional war powers au-
thority. That’s why I cosponsored an amend-
ment to prevent the president from using un-
authorized force against Iran and voted in sup-
port of an amendment to accelerate with-
drawal of U.S. troops from Afghanistan. I also 
believe this legislation should have repealed 
the long-outdated 2001 and 2002 authoriza-
tions for the use of military force (AUMFs), as 
well as prohibited funding for the deployment 
of dangerous low-yield nuclear weapons. How-
ever, I am encouraged that this year’s House 
Defense Appropriations bill repeals both the 
2001 and 2002 AUMFs and prevents use of 
funds for any unauthorized use of force 
against Iran. 
I am also disappointed that several amend-
ments I supported were not made in order, in-
cluding amendments to add several diseases 
to the VA’s list of presumptive diseases con-
nected to Agent Orange, to curb the Penta-
gon’s 1033 program that transfers surplus mili-
tary equipment to local law enforcement agen-
cies, to block the Trump administration’s cruel 
ban on transgender individuals serving in the 
military, and my amendment to abolish the 
military draft. I also believe this legislation 
could have done far more to prevent the presi-
dent from raiding billions more in funding for 
his unnecessary, ineffective border wall. 
The bottom line is that fiscal responsibility 
and accountability at the DOD would allow for 
taxpayer funds to be better spent supporting 
the needs of our troops, meeting our obliga-
tions to veterans, and ensuring our legitimate 
defense needs are prioritized while also bol-
stering long-underfunded domestic priorities. I 
strongly encourage the Senate to keep the 
strong House NDAA provisions and not water 
the bill down.

Message from the President: Senate received the

States: 
Transmitting, pursuant to law, a report relative to
