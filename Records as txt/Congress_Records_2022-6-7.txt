DESIGNATION OF THE SPEAKER 
PRO TEMPORE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore laid be-
fore the House the following commu-
nication from the Speaker: 
WASHINGTON, DC, 
June 7, 2022. 
I hereby appoint the Honorable JIMMY PA-
NETTA to act as Speaker pro tempore on this

NANCY PELOSI, 
Speaker of the House of Representatives. 
f 
PRAYER 
The Chaplain, the Reverend Margaret 
Grun Kibben, offered the following 
prayer: 
Almighty God, hear our prayers as 
the country lies divided before You. 
And yet there is not one person in this 
room who doesn’t want to relieve our 
children of fear or to ensure the safety 
of the day-to-day lives of American 
citizens. 
How then do we address faithfully 
the rash of tragedies that have plagued 
our communities and gripped the Na-
tion with turmoil and terror, frustra-
tion, and fear? 
Holy God, how do we respond appro-
priately to the devastation that has in-
filtrated our schools and our play-
grounds, haunted nightclubs, and gro-
cery stores, and taken over city streets 
and neighborhood graduation parties? 
Lord, how do we discern the way to 
peaceful dialogue without our personal 
prejudices getting in the way? 
And how do we avoid our inclination 
to be right but seek instead the wisdom 
of Your righteousness? 
As we approach You, whether from 
the depths of our sadness or the heat of 
our anger, remind us that these days 
and every day belong to You. Though 
the discussions in which we engage 
ourselves seem fraught with discord, 
You alone have the power to bring 
order to our chaos. 
Call us then to set our minds not on 
our own self-interests but to adopt a 
more faithful attitude that leads to life 
and peace—an attitude that comes only 
from Your holy spirit. 
Inspire us to yield ourselves, our de-
liberations, and our lives to Your guid-
ance that our Nation would be re-
stored. 
We pray in the power of Your name 
to serve You faithfully in all that we 
face this day. 
Amen. 
f 
THE JOURNAL 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to section 11(a) of House Resolu-
tion 188, the Journal of the last day’s

f 
PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Will the 
gentleman from South Carolina (Mr. 
WILSON) come forward and lead the 
House in the Pledge of Allegiance. 
Mr. WILSON of South Carolina led 
the Pledge of Allegiance as follows:

United States of America, and to the Repub-
lic for which it stands, one nation under God, 
indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.

HONORING JILLIAN ALBAYATI 
(Mr. CORREA asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. CORREA. Mr. Speaker, today I 
rise to honor Anaheim High School’s 
Jillian Albayati, the young athlete 
making history for women in men’s 
high school baseball. 
Jillian became the first girl to pitch 
in a CIF-Southern Section men’s base-
ball final, allowing one run on eight 
hits in nine innings in a Division 6 
championship for the Anaheim High 
School Colonists. 
She can also hit the ball. At the 
championships, she drove in the Colo-
nists’ run with an RBI single and fin-
ished the season with an average of 
over 300. And she plays first base. 
Jillian was also the first girl to be se-
lected to play in the Orange County 
Men’s All-Star Baseball Game. One of 
her goals is to play for the USA Na-
tional Baseball Team, and she will be 
trying out for that in July. 
With a high school career of 60 
strikeouts in 79 innings, 11 wins in the 
regular season, and four CIF baseball 
wins, we can say that Jillian plays like 
a girl. 
We are proud of Jillian and congratu-
late her. 
Go Colonists. 
f 
GAS PRICES 
(Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania asked 
and was given permission to address 
the House for 1 minute and to revise 
and extend his remarks.) 
Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania. Mr. 
Speaker, this week, as gasoline prices 
climb to over $5 a gallon at home, 
Pennsylvania families are now paying 
twice what they paid when President 
Biden first took office just 18 months 
ago. 
By Biden’s canceling of new drilling 
leases and decision to impose burden-
some standards on our energy pro-
ducers, the President has turned his 
back on the energy crisis that our com-
munities right now are facing. 
A new report out this week finds that 
at this rate, Americans are on track to 
pay over $5,000 a year for gasoline. 
These prices are unsustainable, and in-
stead of addressing the problem, Presi-
dent Biden has chosen to side with the 
far-left activists instead of the work-
ing-class Americans who are paying 
these prices at the pump. 
The answer is clear: We need to 
produce American energy for American 
families to lower the cost of gas and 
stop the runaway inflation that is 
right now crippling our Nation. 
f 
GUN VIOLENCE EPIDEMIC 
(Mr. BLUMENAUER asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
his remarks.) 
Mr. BLUMENAUER. The avalanche 
of horrible news about mass shootings, 
especially at schools, has been painful 
but instructive. 
America is not unique. But what is 
unique is that America has accepted 
the slaughter, unlike Britain, Canada, 
Australia, New Zealand, and Norway, 
who have acted decisively to reduce 
gun violence and proven that it works. 
We have stood by allowing the car-
nage to continue to our shame. Amer-
ica should not be the only rich country 
that cannot protect its children. 
This should be one of the defining 
issues of this election cycle. If can-
didates can’t support simple, common-
sense, and proven steps to reduce gun 
violence, then what is their answer? 
It is no longer acceptable for gun vio-
lence enablers to hide behind thoughts 
and prayers.

minute.) 
Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, with his poll 
numbers tanking, President Biden is 
trying to buy off voters with mass stu-
dent loan forgiveness. While this elitist 
handout may win over his radical pro-
gressive base, it is a slap in the face to 
taxpayers, especially those who never 
went to college or spent years paying 
off their own loans. 
Make no mistake, blanket loan for-
giveness is simply retroactive free col-
lege. 
Why should a farmer in Idaho or a 
construction worker in New Jersey pay 
the tuition bills of an Ivy League law-
yer or a wealthy doctor? 
Taxpayers are already footing the 
bill for Biden’s student loan repayment 
moratorium at the cost of $5 billion 
every month. Now the Biden adminis-
tration wants to take hundreds of bil-
lions more for his student loan forgive-
ness scam. 
This is wrong and unfair. 
f 
INFLATION IS NOT JOE BIDEN’S 
FAULT 
(Mr. COHEN asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. COHEN. Mr. Speaker, during the 
break, I had the opportunity to partici-
pate in the Transatlantic Dialogue. We 
had members of parliaments from 
maybe six or seven different nations: 
Ireland, Germany, Serbia, and Cro-
atia—all over Europe. 
I asked what the rate of inflation 
was, and in every country, it was 8, 9, 
and 10 percent. And I asked them if 
their parliaments didn’t blame Biden 
for it? They laughed. Of course, they 
laughed. 
Inflation is a worldwide problem. We 
are doing what we can. It is caused by 
the awful coronavirus and the effects it 
has had on production in China. And it 
has hurt our opportunities to continue 
our manufacturing as we saw it before. 
Gasoline prices have increased the 
same amount in Europe as they have 
here. 
And is it Joe Biden’s fault? 
No. It is OPEC, and it is Russia. 
Prices have gone up about 30 percent 
since they invaded Ukraine. 
All 
Americans 
should 
want 
and 
should work together to reduce infla-
tion and oil prices. But it is not Joe 
Biden’s fault. It is a worldwide prob-
lem. 
f 
BIDENFLATION 
(Mr. WILSON of South Carolina 
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend his remarks.) 
Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. 
Speaker, costs for everyday products 
and services continue to rise, and 
American families are suffering. Gas 
costs have doubled under Biden, reach-
ing the highest level ever for the price 
of gas today. 
In the last year we have all experi-
enced price increases for everyday 
items, including: eggs up 22 percent, 
chicken up 16 percent, bacon up 17 per-
cent, milk up 14 percent, roasted coffee 
up 14 percent, and breakfast cereal up 
12 percent. 
It is not uncommon for a can of soup 
on the shelf to be marked at 65 cents, 
but at checkout, it registers $1. A Dol-
lar Store had all merchandise for $1 
until Valentine’s Day, but now all mer-
chandise is $1.25. 
Due to policies pushed by Biden and 
Democrats, everyday families are left 
to suffer the effects. America should 
resume the Trump policies of all-of- 
the-above energy. 
In conclusion, God bless our troops 
who successfully protected America for 
20 years in the global war on terrorism 
as it continues moving from the Af-
ghanistan safe haven to America.

VETERANS DESERVE WORLD- 
CLASS HEALTH CARE 
(Mr. MRVAN asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. MRVAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today in appreciation that H.R. 4951, 
the 
VA 
Electronic 
Health 
Record 
Transparency Act, legislation I intro-
duced and was approved by the House 
last year, has now been approved by 
the Senate and is being sent to the 
President’s desk to be signed into law. 
Throughout my career, I have been 
privileged to have close working rela-
tionships with veterans and veteran 
service 
organizations 
throughout 
northwest Indiana. These established 
relationships are what motivated me to 
secure a position to the House Vet-
erans’ Affairs Committee. 
As chairman of the Technology Mod-
ernization Subcommittee, I have seen 
the great need for Congress to conduct 
oversight and have accurate informa-
tion to ensure that the electronic 
health record modernization program 
is able to meet the needs of our vet-
erans. 
I thank the leaders of the Senate for 
also seeing the value of this legisla-
tion. And as we move forward, I look 
forward to obtaining the requested in-
formation and continuing our work to 
ensure that all veterans receive the 
world-class healthcare they deserve.

FOOD SECURITY 
(Mr. LAMALFA asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. LAMALFA. Mr. Speaker, Presi-
dent Biden recently promised us food 
shortages in the United States. This is 
the country that leads the world in 
production. Well, that is one heck of a 
campaign promise being kept. Food 
shortages, along with energy sky-
rocketing; what a reset. 
Indeed, my home State of California, 
which produces so much of what Amer-
ica relies on, due to Federal and State 
policies, the water has been taken 
away. Up on the Klamath Basin, zero 
water allocation. 
I just drove around part of my west 
side of the district the other day, and 
there are miles and miles of open land 
that is not growing rice; that they are 
trying to put all that water toward try-
ing to keep orchards alive. The water-
fowl are not coming in. The jobs are 
not happening; all because of a back-
wards campaign promise, evidently, to 
put food shortages out there for people. 
Empty shelves in the supermarket; it 
is unbelievable that this is what this 
administration—and 
what 
are 
they 
doing? What are they doing? 
We are not getting more water facili-
ties built. We are not getting more 
storage made. No, we are just con-
tinuing down the same path to try and 
save fish that don’t exist in the delta, 
or that are being marketed by people 
catching them up on the rivers and out 
in the ocean. 
I guess that is why everybody is lead-
ing the charge these days in cheering 
for: Let’s go, Brandon. 
f 
SAVING LIVES 
(Ms. JACKSON LEE asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Buffalo, Tulsa, 
Philadelphia. Mr. Speaker, I won’t be 
talking about guns. I will be talking 
about saving lives. 
My deepest sympathy to my col-
league in Texas that represents Uvalde, 
and to the people of Texas. And I am 
going to be repetitive this week. It is 
going to be about saving lives and ex-
plaining to the American people that 
people take guns to kill. It may be sui-
cide, but it is certainly mass murders. 
We are up to 200 mass murders up to 
this date. 
But the most stark of what we see is 
that grocery store shoppers in Buffalo, 
killed by white supremacy and guns, 
automatic weapons; here in Uvalde, 
these precious children, killed by guns, 
automatic weapons. 
We have to pass protecting our chil-
dren’s act, and we must also pass a 7- 
day waiting period, which I will be in-
troducing to deal with automatic weap-
ons because guns kill. 
And the question that all of my col-
leagues must ask: Do you believe in hu-
manity? Do you have courage? And can 
you act? That is the only question to 
save lives.

Mr. SMITH of Missouri. Mr. Speaker, 
as the Republican leader of the House 
Budget Committee, I led a group of 12 
Members of Congress last week to the 
Rio Grande Valley to see firsthand the 
real cost of President Biden’s disas-
trous immigration agenda. 
There were major gaps in border wall 
and open areas that make it easier for 
the Mexican cartels to make millions 
of dollars trafficking humans and ille-
gal drugs over the border. And yet, we 
saw $350 million worth of rusted border 
wall materials sitting unused because 
of President Biden’s illegal decision to 
freeze border wall funding. 
Border Patrol agents told me they 
are seeing 10,000 encounters each week 
in the Rio Grande Valley sector alone, 
including 174 different nationalities 
who have been apprehended on the 
southern border. The rest of the world 
has figured out that our border is not 
secure, whether the Biden administra-
tion realizes it or not. 
I will continue fighting to secure the 
border and protect families from Presi-
dent Biden’s disastrous agenda.

HONORING THE LIFE OF ALBERT 
EARL KLEIN, SR. 
(Mr. CARTER of Georgia asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and 
extend his remarks.) 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, I rise today in memory of Albert 
Earl Klein, Sr., known as Al, a veteran, 
a fellow pharmacist, and a small busi-
ness owner. 
Born in Mt. Pleasant in 1925, Al ac-
quired a love for the outdoors, playing 
multiple sports, and spending his free 
time boating, becoming an accom-
plished fisherman at the young age of 
18. 
Al went on to serve in the Army, 
training at Fort Bragg and eventually 
traveling to Guam as a rescue boat op-
erator. He was honorably discharged 
after receiving multiple citations and 
decorations. 
Upon returning home, Al earned his 
doctorate degree in pharmacy at the 
College of Charleston and obtained his 
Georgia 
pharmacy 
license 
shortly 
thereafter. 
Al opened several drug stores, one of 
them in my beautiful hometown of 
Pooler, Georgia, and he enjoyed a suc-
cessful career of over 60 years. 
After retirement, Al and his wife, 
Ethel, enjoyed traveling, gardening, 
and visiting their four children and 12 
grandchildren. 
Al was a veteran, an honorable busi-
ness owner, and a family man whose 
love for the outdoors made sure he 
lived life to the fullest. He will surely 
be missed. 
f 
NEW YORK’S 22ND DISTRICT CON-
GRESSIONAL ART COMPETITION 
(Ms. TENNEY asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.) 
Ms. TENNEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize the participants of 
this year’s Congressional Art Competi-
tion in New York’s 22nd Congressional 
District. 
Each year, dozens of high school stu-
dents from across the 22nd District 
submit pieces of art that they have 
spent countless hours and put tremen-
dous effort into perfecting; although 
every work of art is abandoned, it is 
never perfect. 
Last year’s winner, Gavin Schiavi 
from New Hartford, submitted a beau-
tiful piece done completely with col-
ored pencil, and our judges were thor-
oughly impressed with the attention to 
detail and the amazing work done by 
Gavin. 
This year, we made a few additions to 
the competition. During the last week 
of April, we held two community art 
shows where the students’ artwork was 
on display for the public. Over 100 peo-
ple attended these viewings, voting on 
two pieces as their favorite; those from 
Gianna Yacobucci of New Hartford, and 
Salwa Nadeem of Vestal. 
Following these events, our inde-
pendent judges voted on the winners. 
The first-place winner was Nadja Wall, 
with her painting ‘‘The Aquarium.’’ In 
second was Anita Grant from New 
Hartford; third, Olivia Muse from Ves-
tal; and fourth, Emily Carlson from 
Holland Patent. Our judges agreed this 
is one of the best years we have seen in 
terms of competition and the quality of 
work submitted. 
I thank all of the teachers and stu-
dents for their work, and the parents as 
well, for their support of these remark-
able students and their fantastic work. 
I look forward to viewing everyone’s 
work from all Members of Congress in 
the hallways of Congress.

POLITICIZING THE UVALDE 
TRAGEDY 
(Mr. ROY asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. ROY. Mr. Speaker, I noticed my 
colleague from Texas down here a little 
bit earlier talking about the tragedy in 
Uvalde. And I can tell you, as someone 
who represents central Texas and the 
district and the county that shares a 
border with Uvalde County, it hits 
close to home. 
But I would note that the President 
of the United States and my colleagues 
have suddenly found Uvalde and south 
Texas on a map. When we have got 
15,000 people in a caravan coming to 
Texas; we have 700-some people, mi-
grants, who have died along the border; 
we have mobile morgues being used in 
south Texas along the Rio Grande; and 
now suddenly, to go exploit a tragedy 
for political purposes, my colleagues 
on the other side of the aisle can find 
Uvalde on a map. Because they sure as 
hell haven’t been able to find Uvalde on 
a map over the last year and a half of 
this administration. 
We will have more to talk this week 
about the politicization of this tragedy 
in Uvalde, and targeting the pretext 
and the false use by my colleague from 
Texas of ‘‘automatic weapons’’ as op-
posed to semi-automatic weapons. 
But let’s be clear: Our borders remain 
wide open, and Americans are dying in 
droves; hundreds and thousands of peo-
ple across this country who are dying 
because of open borders. We will talk 
about it this week.

IMPROVING ACCESS TO WORKERS’ 
COMPENSATION 
FOR 
INJURED 
FEDERAL WORKERS ACT OF 2022 
Mr. COURTNEY. Madam Speaker, I 
move to suspend the rules and pass the

title 5, United States Code, to cover, 
for purposes of workers’ compensation 
under such chapter, services by physi-
cian assistants and nurse practitioners 
provided to injured Federal workers, 
and for other purposes, as amended. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 6087

resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled,

ant to the rule, the gentleman from 
Connecticut (Mr. COURTNEY) and the 
gentleman 
from 
Michigan 
(Mr. 
WALBERG) each will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from Connecticut. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. COURTNEY. Madam Speaker, I 
ask unanimous consent that all Mem-
bers may have 5 legislative days in 
which to revise and extend their re-
marks and insert extraneous material 
on H.R. 6087, the Improving Access to 
Workers’ Compensation for Injured 
Federal Workers Act 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Connecticut? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. COURTNEY. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, today, we are con-
sidering a straightforward bipartisan 
bill that will alleviate some of the bar-
riers Federal workers face seeking 
treatment and care after they have 
been injured on the job. 
Right now, whether we represent 
urban districts or rural districts, we 
are all hearing about the very real 
shortage of physicians, whether it is in 
general practice or specialty practices. 
That is why it is important for Con-
gress to surgically and intelligently re-
form outdated, antiquated policies in 
place that prevent qualified providers 
from treating patients who need their 
care. 
This bill achieves that goal for Fed-
eral employees who need treatment for 
workplace injuries or illness and will 
allow qualified, licensed nurse practi-
tioners and physician assistants to 
treat these patients safely and com-
petently and be reimbursed under the 
Federal Employees’ Compensation Act. 
The bill explicitly states, in section 
2, that such treatment must adhere to 
the scope of practice for nurse practi-
tioners and physician assistants, as de-
fined by State law. I repeat: The bill 
was carefully crafted so that it does 
not encroach on the authority of State 
health licensing boards to determine 
the scope of practice. That is one of the 
reasons why the Committee on Edu-
cation and Labor came together on a 
bipartisan basis to unanimously en-
dorse passage of this bill. 
Right now, injured Federal workers 
who serve our Nation at agencies such 
as the Department of Homeland Secu-
rity, the Postal Service, and our Na-
tional Parks, to name a few, can only 
receive the care they are entitled to 
under the Federal workers’ compensa-
tion law if it is provided by a physi-
cian, and only a physician can certify a 
claim regardless of whether the State 
the worker resides in allows nurse 
practitioners and PAs to practice inde-
pendently. 
As any healthcare patient in America 
knows, nurse practitioners and physi-
cian assistants are a growing portion of 
primary care and healthcare workforce 
nationwide, especially in rural areas. 
Patients are ably and safely treated by 
NPs and PAs in these settings every 
day and having the capability to be 
treated by a nurse practitioner or a 
physician assistant increases access to 
more timely treatment, particularly in 
parts of the country experiencing phy-
sician shortages. 
The benefit of increased access was 
confirmed by the Congressional Budget 
Office in their analysis of this bill, 
which found that it would have no im-
pact on direct spending by the govern-
ment. 
Given the challenges some Federal 
workers have in accessing their Fed-
eral workers’ comp benefits, allowing 
these providers to be reimbursed for 
the care they provide within the scope 
of their practice is an extremely com-
monsense improvement. CBO has even 
stated that this legislation would help 
injured Federal workers return to the 
job faster. In this labor market, any-
thing we can do to improve workers’ 
healthy recovery and job retention is 
worthwhile. 
This bill has been endorsed by the 
National Rural Health Association, the 
American 
Nursing 
Association, 
the 
American Association of Nurse Practi-
tioners, the American Academy of Phy-
sician Assistants, as well as a diverse 
coalition of unions representing Fed-
eral employees, such as the National 
Treasury Employees Union and the Na-
tional Postal Mail Handlers Union. 
Further, the Department of Labor’s 
Office of the Workers’ Compensation 
Programs which administers the Fed-
eral Employees’ Compensation Act for 
Federal workers in agencies as diverse 
as the Pentagon, Department of Home-
land Security, Interior, and Veterans 
Affairs, has confirmed this legislation 
will help alleviate barriers that create 
delays for FECA claimants and would 
expand injured workers access to med-
ical treatment. 
Madam Speaker, I have the honor to 
represent the largest military installa-
tion in New England, Naval Submarine 
Base New London, which employs over 
1,000 civilian Federal workers who per-
form outstanding work to support 16 
attack submarines that deploy from 
that base. 
Some of that work is physically de-
manding, such as firefighters, police, 
and crane operators, and injuries do 
happen. This bill will create healthcare 
parity for those patriots by ensuring 
that they will have their claims han-
dled and treated the same as any other 
workers who reside in Connecticut and 
Rhode Island. This is an overdue and 
important, but commonsense, way to 
bring this program in line with the re-
ality of 21st century healthcare deliv-
ery. 
Madam Speaker, I thank my Repub-
lican counterpart, Mr. WALBERG, for 
his great support and work to bring 
this issue forward. I also thank Chair-
man SCOTT and Ranking Member FOXX 
for their bipartisan work supporting 
this bill and getting it through com-
mittee. 
Madam Speaker, I strongly urge a 
‘‘yes’’ vote on this bipartisan and com-
monsense measure, and I reserve the 
balance of my time. 
Mr. WALBERG. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5243 
June 7, 2022 
is a commonsense bill to improve ac-
cess to care for workers under the Fed-
eral 
Employees’ 
Compensation, 
or 
FECA, program. 
I rise in support of this bill that I 
have co-led with my friend and col-
league, Representative COURTNEY, and 
thank him, his staff, my staff, the staff 
of the Committee on Education and 
Labor for their diligent work on this 
legislation. 
The bill simply allows nurse practi-
tioners or physician assistants to care 
for Federal employees under the Fed-
eral workers’ compensation program so 
long—and I make this clear—so long as 
that care is within their scope of prac-
tice under State law. 
Under current Federal law, only a 
physician can diagnose, certify, and 
oversee the treatment of an injured 
Federal worker receiving compensation 
benefits. This requirement places an 
additional burden on Federal employ-
ees who may have to drive great dis-
tances to receive care from an ap-
proved provider. 
Additionally, it limits the injured in-
dividual’s choice, depriving them from 
receiving healthcare from the provider 
with whom they are most comfortable. 
A majority of States already allow NPs 
and PAs to diagnose, certify an injury, 
and oversee the patient’s treatment 
and care for their State workers’ com-
pensation programs. So it is time that 
the Federal Government do the same 
under the Federal disability program. 
Furthermore, our bill will align the 
FECA program with other Federal pro-
grams. 
Currently, the Federal Government 
allows care provided or overseen by 
PAs and NPs in Medicare, Medicaid, 
the Federal Employee Health Benefits 
Program, and TRICARE. Additionally, 
since 2017, the Social Security Admin-
istration has considered PAs and NPs, 
along with physicians, as acceptable 
sources of information for documenting 
the existence of an impairment for pur-
poses of determining a disability. 
Madam Speaker, across the country, 
nurse practitioners and physician as-
sistants provide critical care, espe-
cially in rural communities where 
there may not be a physician within a 
reasonable distance. In Michigan, there 
are 5,300 practicing physician assist-
ants and nearly 9,000 nurse practi-
tioners. They are an important part of 
our primary care workforce in our 
State. 
Our bill updates Federal law to grant 
Federal employees more choice in se-
lecting their healthcare provider, im-
prove access to care, and enable better 
continuity of care. Again, I sincerely 
thank my colleague, Representative 
COURTNEY, and his staff for their great 
work on this bipartisan, commonsense 
bill. 
Madam Speaker, I urge all Members 
to support it, and I reserve the balance 
of my time. 
Mr. COURTNEY. Madam Speaker, I 
again applaud Mr. WALBERG
for his 
leadership on this legislation. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to 
the gentleman from the great Com-
monwealth of Virginia (Mr. SCOTT), 
chairman of the Committee on Edu-
cation and Labor. 
Mr. 
SCOTT 
of 
Virginia. 
Madam 
Speaker, I thank the gentleman from 
Connecticut for yielding. 
Madam Speaker, more than 2 million 
Federal employees provide key services 
to the public. In fact, during the height 
of the pandemic, Federal workers were 
critical in delivering vaccines, personal 
protective 
equipment, 
and 
other 
COVID relief to the American people. 
So it stands to reason that when a Fed-
eral worker gets sick or injured on the 
job, we are obligated to provide them 
and their families with the resources 
and medical care that they need. 
Today, we can improve that effort by 
providing expanded healthcare access 
for injured Federal workers who are 
seeking healthcare covered by Federal 
workers’ compensation. We live in a 
country where people are increasingly 
turning to nurse practitioners and phy-
sician 
assistants as their primary 
healthcare provider. This is particu-
larly true in rural America where they 
are disproportionately impacted by 
physician shortages. 
Unfortunately, Federal law now lim-
its what can be reimbursed under Fed-
eral workers’ compensation, forcing in-
jured workers to see only a physician 
to certify the injury and disability as 
work-related and to deliver services. It 
is time to correct this lag in access to 
healthcare. After all, core Federal 
healthcare programs, including Medi-
care and the Veterans Affairs’ system, 
already recognize services delivered by 
nurse practitioners and physician as-
sistants if provided within the scope of 
practice allowed by State law. 
This bill would allow nurse practi-
tioners and physician assistants to re-
ceive reimbursement for healthcare 
services they are providing to injured 
Federal workers if, and only if, those 
services are already permissible under 
their State laws. 
Madam Speaker, a ‘‘yes’’ vote on this 
bill is a step to expand the group of 
available healthcare providers con-
sistent with existing State law so that 
we can ensure injured Federal workers 
and their families get the support and 
care they deserve. 
I thank the gentleman from Con-
necticut (Mr. COURTNEY) for his leader-
ship on the bill, along with the distin-
guished member of the Committee on 
Education and Labor, the gentleman 
from Michigan (Mr. WALBERG), and the 
committee’s 
ranking 
member, 
Dr. 
Foxx, for their support of this legisla-
tion. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to support the Improving Ac-
cess to Workers’ Compensation for In-
jured Federal Workers Act. 
Mr. WALBERG. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from 
Maryland (Mr. HARRIS), my friend, the 
MD. 
Mr. HARRIS. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman for yielding the 
time. 
Madam Speaker, I rise with concern 
about H.R. 6087, Improving Access to 
Workers’ Compensation for Injured 
Federal Workers Act. It was mentioned 
that it is fine if healthcare practi-
tioners are qualified to deliver work-
men’s comp. Certainly, in some States, 
nurse practitioners and physician as-
sistants—nurse practitioners, specifi-
cally, can practice without a physician 
oversight, but the question is whether 
that is appropriate for workmen’s com-
pensation. 
Remember, workmen’s compensation 
includes people who have been injured 
or claimed to have been injured on the 
job. These employees deserve the high-
est level of care, the highest level of 
evaluation, of diagnosis, certification, 
and treatment. And what this bill does 
is turns over the qualifications for who 
is going to treat those injured Federal 
workers to the State to make the deci-
sion. Because it says, Well, if in a State 
they decide that a physician assistant 
practicing independently is just fine, 
well, that Federal worker is not going 
to have the benefit of having a physi-
cian involved in that care. 
b 1515 
Madam Speaker, this is a serious pol-
icy debate. This debate should be tak-
ing place, I believe, not on a suspension 
calendar but actually come under a 
regular rule and be debated for whether 
or not this is the way we want to treat 
Federal employees, that we want to 
subject them to a State level of care as 
opposed to a level of care that we think 
is appropriate, again, for an injured 
Federal worker. 
So, Madam Speaker, I include in the 
RECORD a letter from the American 
Medical Association strongly opposing 
H.R. 6087. 
AMERICAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION, 
June 5, 2022. 
Hon. NANCY PELOSI, 
U.S. House of Representatives, 
Washington, DC. 
Hon. KEVIN MCCARTHY, 
U.S. House of Representatives, 
Washington, DC. 
DEAR SPEAKER PELOSI AND MINORITY LEAD-
ER MCCARTHY: On behalf of the physician and 
medical student members of the American 
Medical Association (AMA), I am writing in 
strong opposition to H.R. 6087, the ‘‘Improv-
ing Access to Workers’ Compensation for In-
jured Federal Workers Act.’’ This legislation 
would allow nurse practitioners (NPs) and 
physician assistants (PAs) to diagnose, pre-
scribe, treat, and certify an injury and ex-
tent of disability for purposes of compen-
sating federal workers under the Federal 
Employees’ Compensation Act (FECA). 
Current law prohibits non-physician health 
professionals from making these determina-
tions and reserves this function to physi-
cians who have the education, training, and 
expertise to make these evaluations. The 
AMA remains steadfast in its commitment 
to patients who have said repeatedly that 
they want and expect physicians leading 
their health care team. In a recent survey of 
U.S. voters, 68 percent say it is very impor-
tant for a physician to be involved in their

diagnosis and treatment decisions. However, 
H.R. 6087 effectively removes physicians 
from the care team and sets up our federal 
workers for suboptimal health outcomes and 
increased costs, without improving access to 
care. At a time when inflation is at an all- 
time high and our economy is still strug-
gling to recover from the costs associated 
with the COVID–19 pandemic, now is espe-
cially not the time for Congress to enact this 
type of policy change. 
EDUCATION
MATTERS: PATIENTS
WANT
PHYSI-
CIANS
INVOLVED
IN
THEIR
DIAGNOSIS
AND 
TREATMENT DECISIONS 
The AMA is concerned that H.R. 6087, while 
perhaps well-intentioned for speedier work-
ers’ compensation determinations, will actu-
ally jeopardize patient care. While the bill 
purports to allow NPs and PAs to diagnose, 
prescribe, treat, and certify an injury and ex-
tent of disability within their state scope of 
practice laws, the federal government dic-
tating this scope expansion will have the ef-
fect of setting the benchmark for the states. 
We have seen this repeatedly with Medicare 
coverage determinations, for example, set-
ting the benchmark for private plan cov-
erage determinations. Moreover, while all 
health care professionals play a critical role 
in providing care to patients, and NPs and 
PAs are important members of the care 
team, their skillsets are not interchangeable 
with that of fully educated and trained phy-
sicians. This is fundamentally evident based 
on the difference in education and training 
between the distinct professions. Physicians 
complete four years of medical school plus a 
three-to-seven-year residency program, in-
cluding 10,000–16,000 hours of clinical train-
ing. By contrast, NPs, complete only two to 
three years of education, have no residency 
requirement, and only 500–720 hours of clin-
ical training. The current PA education 
model is two years in length with only 2,000 
hours of clinical care and no residency re-
quirement. Patients expect the most quali-
fied person—physician experts with un-
matched training, education, and experi-
ence—to be diagnosing and treating injured 
federal workers and making often complex 
clinical determinations on the nature of an 
injury and extent of disability. NPs and PAs 
do not have the education and training to 
make these determinations and we should 
not be offering a lower standard of care to 
our federal workers who are injured. 
But it is more than just the vast difference 
in hours of education and training; it is also 
the difference in rigor and standardization 
between medical school/residency and NP 
and PA programs that matter and must be 
assessed. During medical school, students re-
ceive a comprehensive education in the 
classroom and in laboratories, where they 
study the biological, chemical, pharma-
cological, and behavioral aspects of the 
human condition. This period of intense 
study is supplemented by two years of pa-
tient care rotations through different spe-
cialties, during which medical students as-
sist licensed physicians in the care of pa-
tients. During clinical rotations, medical 
students continue to develop their clinical 
judgment 
and 
medical 
decision-making 
skills through direct experience managing 
patients in all aspects of medicine. Fol-
lowing graduation, students must then pass 
a series of examinations to assess a physi-
cian’s readiness for licensure. At this point, 
medical students ‘‘match’’ into a three-to- 
seven-year residency program during which 
they provide care in a select surgical or med-
ical specialty under the supervision of expe-
rienced physician faculty. As resident physi-
cians 
gain 
experience 
and 
demonstrate 
growth in their ability to care for patients, 
they are given greater responsibility and 
independence. NP programs do not have 
similar time-tested standardizations. For ex-
ample, between 2010–2017, the number of NP 
programs grew by more than 30 percent with 
well over half of these programs offered 
mostly or completely online, meaning less 
in-person instruction and hands-on clinical 
experience. In addition, many programs re-
quire students to find their own preceptor to 
meet their practice hours requirement, re-
sulting in much variation among students’ 
clinical experiences. Our injured federal 
workers deserve better—they deserve and 
have a right to have physicians leading their 
health care team. 
INCREASING
SCOPE
OF
PRACTICE
OF
NPS
AND 
PAS CAN LEAD TO INCREASED HEALTH CARE 
COSTS 
There is strong evidence that increasing 
the scope of practice of NPs and PAs has re-
sulted in increased health care costs due to 
overprescribing and overutilization of diag-
nostic imaging and other services. For exam-
ple, a 2020 study published in the Journal of 
Internal Medicine found 3.8 percent of physi-
cians (MDs/DOs) compared to 8.0 percent of 
NPs met at least one definition of overpre-
scribing opioids and 1.3 percent of physicians 
compared to 6.3 percent of NPs prescribed an 
opioid to at least 50 percent of patients. The 
study further found that, in states that allow 
independent prescribing, NPs were 20 times 
more likely to overprescribe opioids than 
those in prescription-restricted states. 
Multiple studies have also shown that NPs 
order more diagnostic imaging than physi-
cians, which increases health care costs and 
threatens patient safety by exposing pa-
tients to unnecessary radiation. For exam-
ple, a study in the Journal of the American 
College of Radiology, which analyzed skel-
etal x-ray utilization for Medicare bene-
ficiaries from 2003 to 2015, found ordering in-
creased substantially—more than 400 per-
cent—by non-physicians, primarily NPs and 
PAs, during this time frame. A separate 
study published in JAMA Internal Medicine 
found NPs ordered more diagnostic imaging 
than primary care physicians following an 
outpatient visit. The study controlled for 
imaging claims that occurred after a referral 
to a specialist. The authors opined this in-
creased utilization may have important 
ramifications on costs, safety, and quality of 
care. They further found greater coordina-
tion in health care teams may produce bet-
ter outcomes than merely expanding NP 
scope of practice alone. 
In addition, a recent study from the Hat-
tiesburg Clinic in Mississippi found that al-
lowing NPs and PAs to function with inde-
pendent patient panels under physician su-
pervision in the primary care setting re-
sulted in higher costs, higher utilization of 
services, and lower quality of care compared 
to panels of patients with a primary care 
physician. Specifically, the study found that 
non-nursing home Medicare ACO patient 
spend was $43 higher per member, per month 
for patients on a NP/PA panel compared to 
those with a primary care physician. Simi-
larly, patients with an NP/PA as their pri-
mary care provider were 1.8 percent more 
likely to visit the ER and had an 8 percent 
higher referral rate to specialists despite 
being younger and healthier than the cohort 
of patients in the primary care physician 
panel. On quality of care, the researchers ex-
amined 10 quality measures and found that 
physicians performed better on 9 of the 10 
measures compared to the non-physicians. 
The findings are clear: NPs and PAs tend 
to prescribe more opioids than physicians, 
order more diagnostic imaging than physi-
cians, 
and 
overprescribe 
antibiotics—all 
which increase health care costs and threat-
en patient safety. The Hattiesburg Clinic 
study further confirms these findings and 
the need for physician-led team-based care. 
Before expanding the scope of practice of all 
NPs and PAs and essentially removing physi-
cians from the care team, we encourage Con-
gress to carefully review these studies. We 
believe you will agree that the results are 
startling and have significant impact on the 
assessment of risk to the health and welfare 
of patients, as well as the impact on the cost 
of health care in the United States. 
Finally, proponents of H.R. 6087 cite rec-
ognition of NPs and PAs within the FECA as 
necessary in order to assist with diagnosing 
and treating patients who contract COVID– 
19 in the workplace. They claim that permit-
ting NPs and PAs to diagnose and treat indi-
viduals suffering from COVID–19 injuries is 
believed to help patients get back to work 
faster so they can continue to provide for 
their families. Yet, COVID–19, a virus that is 
already responsible for the death of over one 
million individuals just in the United States, 
is a complex disease with varying impacts 
based on patient co-morbidities. Further-
more, pre-existing conditions and other com-
plicating health factors have a tremendous 
impact on whether vaccines and therapeutics 
are appropriate for patients who have con-
tracted COVID–19. These complexities high-
light the fact that physician experts are best 
suited to be assessing, diagnosing, and treat-
ing patients in the FECA program. 
SCOPE EXPANSIONS HAVE NOT PROVEN TO 
INCREASE ACCESS TO CARE IN RURAL AREAS 
Proponents of scope expansion have argued 
that legislation like H.R. 6087 is necessary to 
expand access to care. This promise has been 
made for years by NPs and PAs seeking 
scope expansions at the state-level, but it 
has not proven true. In reviewing the actual 
practice locations of primary care physicians 
compared to NPs and PAs, it is clear that 
physicians and non-physicians tend to prac-
tice in the same areas of the state. This is 
true even in those states where, for example, 
NPs can practice without physician involve-
ment. The Graduate Nurse Demonstration 
Project (the Project), conducted by the Cen-
ters for Medicare & Medicaid Services, con-
firmed this as well. One goal of the Project 
was to determine whether increased funding 
for Advanced Practice Registered Nursing 
(APRNs) programs would increase the num-
ber of APRNs practicing in rural areas. The 
results found that this did not happen. In 
fact, only 9 percent of alumni from the pro-
gram went on to work in rural areas. 
Moreover, workforce studies in various 
states have shown a growing number of NPs 
are not entering primary care. For example, 
the Oregon Center for Nursing found only 25 
percent of NPs practice primary care. Simi-
larly, the Center for Health Workforce Stud-
ies conducted a study on the NP workforce 
in New York that found, ‘‘[w]hile the vast 
majority of NPs report a primary care spe-
cialty certification, about one-third of active 
NPs are considered primary care NPs, which 
is based on both NP specialty certification 
and practice setting.’’ In addition, the study 
found newly graduated NPs were more likely 
to enter specialty or subspecialty care rather 
than primary care. In short, the evidence is 
clear that expanding scope for NPs and PAs 
will not necessarily lead to better access to 
care in rural America. 
Rather than supporting an unproven path 
forward, Congress should consider proven so-
lutions to increase access to care, including 
supporting physician-led team-based care. 
Evidence shows that states that require phy-
sician-led team-based care have seen a great-
er overall increase in the number of NPs 
compared to states that allow independent 
practice. The Congressional Budget Office es-
timates the cost of this legislation is zero

and includes in its assumptions that while 
some workers may get services more quick-
ly, increasing costs to the federal govern-
ment, that these workers might also return 
to work more quickly saving the federal gov-
ernment money for a net cost of zero. How-
ever, this analysis fails to take into account 
the cost to the health care system when pa-
tients do not receive the right care at the 
right time. Eliminating physicians from 
workers’ compensation determinations in-
creases this likelihood exponentially and is a 
gamble with the health of our federal work-
ers that Congress should not be willing to 
take. 
ENACTMENT UNDER SUSPENSION OF THE HOUSE 
RULES IS INAPPROPRIATE 
The AMA is also concerned that the House 
of Representatives is attempting to pass 
H.R. 6087 under ‘‘suspension of the rules,’’ a 
procedural tactic that is often used to act 
expeditiously on legislation that is typically 
non-controversial. Bills considered ‘‘under 
suspension’’ receive limited floor debate, all 
floor amendments are prohibited, and a two- 
thirds vote of all members present is re-
quired for final passage. 
H.R. 6087 does not meet the definition of a 
‘‘non-controversial’’ 
bill 
and, 
therefore, 
should not be considered under suspension of 
the rules. First and foremost, the strong con-
cerns we raise in this letter should be suffi-
cient for lawmakers to recognize that legis-
lation that would be detrimental to the 
health and welfare of federal workers should 
not be considered under this fast-track par-
liamentary procedure. While it passed out of 
the House Education and Labor Committee 
in mid-March 2022, H.R. 6087 was formally in-
troduced two months ago and has only gen-
erated 18 total cosponsors. Bills enacted 
under suspension of the rules typically gar-
ner hundreds of cosponsors, thus indicating a 
high level of bipartisan support. It is unclear 
whether a strong collection of bipartisan 
members of the House of Representatives 
support this legislation that inappropriately 
expands non-physician practitioner scope of 
practice. While the AMA opposes final pas-
sage of this legislation, we urge the House of 
Representatives to reject enactment of this 
bill under suspension of the rules. 
CONCLUSION 
For all the reasons above, we strongly en-
courage you to protect the health and safety 
of our injured federal workers and oppose 
passage of H.R. 6087. 
Sincerely, 
JAMES L. MADARA, MD. 
Mr. HARRIS. Madam Speaker, they 
give reasons. They say, look, education 
matters. Patients want physicians in-
volved in their diagnosis and treatment 
decisions. I think that is true. 
They say that increasing the scope of 
practice of nurse practitioners or phy-
sician assistants can lead to increased 
healthcare 
costs, 
specifically 
men-
tioning the fact that there are studies 
now that show that when a nurse prac-
titioner is involved or a physician as-
sistant—— 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentleman has expired. 
Mr. WALBERG. Madam Speaker, I 
yield an additional 30 seconds to the 
gentleman. 
Mr. HARRIS. Madam Speaker, they 
mention that, for instance, opioid over-
prescribing occurs four times as much 
when a nurse practitioner is involved. 
Obviously, in a workers’ comp case 
where injury may be determined, this 
could be significant. This is something 
we should deal with. 
Finally, even the AMA recognized 
that they are concerned that we are at-
tempting to pass this under suspension 
of the rules usually, typically, reserved 
for noncontroversial bills. 
Madam Speaker, I thank the gen-
tleman for yielding me time. 
Mr. COURTNEY. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Just briefly, I agree with the gen-
tleman from Maryland that the goal 
here should be what is best for Federal 
employees, who do critical work for 
our country, but I think also what we 
want is what is best for people who are 
protected by Social Security Disability 
Insurance, by the Federal Employees 
Health Benefits Program, which are 
programs in which independent prac-
tice of nurse practitioners and physi-
cian assistants has been well estab-
lished and, again, subject to scope of 
practice in the State where the patient 
resides. 
Again, this is just simply conforming 
Federal workers’ compensation law 
with existing practice and a whole host 
of other Federal programs involving 
really important populations that all 
of us have a duty to protect. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to 
the gentlewoman from North Carolina 
(Ms. ADAMS), a member of the Edu-
cation and Labor Committee who does 
outstanding work on the Workforce 
Protections Subcommittee as its chair. 
Ms. 
ADAMS. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
I 
thank the gentleman for yielding and 
for his work on this bill. I rise in sup-
port of the Improving Access to Work-
ers’ Compensation for Injured Federal 
Workers Act of 2022, a bill that I am 
proud to have cosponsored. 
North Carolina is home to over 45,000 
Federal employees who are restricted 
from having a nurse practitioner or 
physician assistant diagnose or oversee 
the patient’s treatment and care for 
their workers’ compensation claim. 
North Carolina is one of many States 
that currently authorize nurse practi-
tioners to provide this care for non- 
Federal employees. 
H.R. 6087 will increase patient choice 
for the tens of thousands of Federal 
employees in my State by making the 
Federal Employees’ Compensation Act 
consistent with State law. 
As chairwoman of the Workforce Pro-
tections Subcommittee, I am disheart-
ened to hear that my colleagues on the 
other side of the aisle argue that we 
are rushing this bill. 
H.R. 6087 has gone through the nor-
mal 
legislative 
order. 
My 
sub-
committee held a hearing on this bill 
in December 2021, and the Education 
and Labor Committee held a markup 
on the bill in March just a few months 
ago. 
Of note, the bill passed out of com-
mittee with a bipartisan, unanimous 
voice vote. 
This is a commonsense bill, and I 
urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘yes’’ on 
H.R. 6087. 
Mr. WALBERG. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
I add to the comments about con-
cerns about the care that is being pro-
vided. Repeated studies over the dec-
ades have shown that NPs and PAs pro-
vide outstanding quality of care, im-
prove health outcomes, and increase 
cost-effectiveness. 
Additionally, these healthcare pro-
fessionals have advanced degrees from 
nationally accredited programs that 
include both classroom and clinical ro-
tations and must demonstrate clinical 
competency. 
Once more, if there were legitimate 
concerns about the quality of care, 
whether it is a Federal program or 
State program, provided by NPs and 
PAs to injured workers, then States 
would not license them to treat or di-
agnose these workers under State 
workers’ compensation programs. How-
ever, the vast majority of States do 
recognize nurse practitioners and phy-
sician assistants as eligible providers 
for diagnosing and treating disability 
claims. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to 
the gentleman from North Carolina 
(Mr. MURPHY), my good friend. 
Mr. MURPHY of North Carolina. 
Madam Speaker, I thank the gen-
tleman for allowing me to speak today. 
I rise in opposition to H.R. 6087. I do 
this as a physician where I understand 
that diagnosing, treating, and certi-
fying disability claims takes an ex-
pert’s opinion—not general medicine, 
an expert’s opinion—and physicians 
have exceedingly more training and ex-
perience in dealing with what are truly 
complex medical issues. 
Let’s be very clear: Disability is a 
complex issue. It is a lifelong problem. 
This particular instance requires diag-
nosis, treatment, and evaluations con-
tinually. There is nothing wrong with 
the system that we have in this coun-
try. In many instances, we find that we 
work together well as a team. But I 
think our Federal workers really, in 
this specific avenue, deserve better, 
and I urge them to understand that 
physicians are the best ones to do this. 
Using the claim that there is a physi-
cian shortage should not be an excuse 
to lower what I believe are standards 
for expert care. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to vote ‘‘no’’ on this bill. 
Mr. COURTNEY. Madam Speaker, I 
reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. WALBERG. Madam Speaker, I 
yield such time as she may consume to 
the gentlewoman from North Carolina 
(Ms. FOXX), the ranking member of the 
Education and Labor Committee and 
my good friend and colleague. 
Ms. FOXX. Madam Speaker, I thank 
my colleague from Michigan for yield-
ing. 
I rise in support of this bipartisan 
legislation to allow nurse practitioners 
and physician assistants to act as eligi-
ble providers under the Federal Em-
ployees’ Compensation Act program

within the scope of their practice under 
State law. 
Under current law, nurse practi-
tioners and physician assistants are 
unable to treat Federal workers cov-
ered by FECA, even though most State 
workers’ compensation programs au-
thorize them to provide this care for 
private-sector employees. 
To be clear, H.R. 6087 defers to State 
law and does not expand the scope of 
practice. This legislation aligns FECA 
with other Federal programs that al-
ready include care provided by nurse 
practitioners and physician assistants, 
such as Medicare and the Veterans 
Health Administration program. 
H.R. 6087 would increase healthcare 
access and choice for Federal employ-
ees when many areas of our country 
are grappling with provider shortages, 
especially in rural areas. 
According to the National Rural 
Health Association, nurse practitioners 
and physician assistants account for a 
third of all primary care clinicians 
treating Medicare beneficiaries nation-
wide, and they are closer to half of the 
primary care clinicians in rural areas. 
Improving 
healthcare 
access 
for 
FECA beneficiaries would allow injured 
Federal employees to return to the 
workforce more quickly, benefiting 
both employees and taxpayers. 
I urge my colleagues to support this 
commonsense, bipartisan improvement 
to our Federal workers’ compensation 
program. I thank my committee col-
leagues, Representatives WALBERG and 
COURTNEY, and Chairman SCOTT for ad-
vancing this important legislation. 
Mr. COURTNEY. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Just briefly, again, I thank the rank-
ing member, Congresswoman FOXX, for 
her remarks and Mr. WALBERG, who I 
think very effectively and specifically 
addressed some of the issues that we 
have heard in this brief debate regard-
ing whether or not this is opening the 
door to practitioners who really aren’t 
qualified to engage in the handling of 
workers’ compensation claims. 
Right now, today, there are 27 States 
that actually allow nurse practitioners 
and physician assistants to handle 
workers’ compensation claims under 
State law, including, by the way, North 
Carolina and Maryland. Just going 
down the list, it is from all different re-
gions of the country, and, again, I 
think it has demonstrated that the sys-
tem functions smoothly. As the Con-
gressional Budget Office indicated, it 
allows for quicker care because you 
have more access when you have a 
broader, larger pool of qualified practi-
tioners. 
That is really what this bill is aimed 
at. It is just to make sure that Federal 
workers will have that same oppor-
tunity to access care, particularly 
when they are in underserved parts of 
the country. 
To sort of frame it, I mentioned ear-
lier the New London sub base where 
they have a really sizable firefighters 
contingent there. Again, fires on sub-
marines and Navy ships is a demand-
ing, highly specialized area of practice. 
If they get injured on the job, they do 
not have the same rights as a fire-
fighter who works for the city of New 
London who gets injured on the job, in 
terms of having access to a nurse prac-
titioner or a physician assistant to 
handle that individual’s treatment and 
care and their disability claim. 
That is really what this bill is doing. 
It is just simply establishing parity for 
Federal workers who reside in those 28 
States 
that 
recognize 
independent 
practice by physician assistants and 
nurse practitioners. 
I have some letters of support, 
Madam Speaker, which I include in the 
RECORD: one from the National Postal 
Mail Handlers Union, one from the Na-
tional Treasury Employees Union, one 
from the National Rural Health Asso-
ciation, one from the American Asso-
ciation of Nurse Practitioners, and one 
from the American Association of Phy-
sician Assistants.

HANDLERS UNION, 
Washington, DC. 
Hon. JOE COURTNEY, 
House of Representatives, 
Washington, DC. 
DEAR CONGRESSMAN COURTNEY: On behalf 
of the National Postal Mail Handlers Union, 
which represents over 50,000 mail handlers 
across the country, I write in support of H.R. 
6087, the Improving Access to Workers’ Com-
pensation for injured Federal Workers Act. 
Your legislation is a commonsense solu-
tion to amend the Federal Employees’ Com-
pensation Act to grant injured postal and 
federal workers wider access medical care 
from eligible providers. This will ensure they 
are able to claim workers’ compensation and 
receive necessary care in a timely manner. 
As it can be difficult to expeditiously 
schedule appointments with physicians for 
work-related injuries, H.R. 6087 extends eligi-
ble providers to include physician assistants 
and nurse practitioners. It is an unfortunate 
fact that postal employees are the largest 
group of beneficiaries under current FECA 
regulations. Your legislation will ensure 
those injured on the job will have access to 
medical care and can see their preferred pri-
mary care provider. 
I look forward to seeing H.R. 6087 gain sup-
port within the House Education and Labor 
Committee, and its advancement through 
the House. 
In solidarity, 
PAUL V. HOGROGIAN, 
National President, 
National Postal Mail Handlers Union.

DEAR
REPRESENTATIVE: This week, the 
House of Representatives is expected to vote 
on suspension on the Improving Access to 
Workers’ Compensation for Injured Federal 
Workers Act of 2022 (HR 6087). The National 
Treasury Employees Union (NTEU) strongly 
supports this legislation and urges you to 
vote YES. 
This bill would improve access to benefits 
under the Federal Employees’ Compensation 
Act (FECA), which serves as the workers’ 
compensation program for federal employ-
ees. It does so by allowing workers to have 
their medical care provided by a Nurse Prac-
titioner (NP) or Physician Assistant (PA), as 
well as have NPs and PAs provide certifi-
cation of injury. This bipartisan bill was in-
troduced by Rep. Joseph Courtney (CT) and 
Rep. Timothy Walberg (MI) and passed out of 
the Education & Labor Committee on a bi-
partisan basis. 
Thank you for your consideration of our 
views. Please feel free to contact Kurt 
Vorndran of the NTEU Department of Legis-
lation if you have any questions. 
Sincerely, 
ANTHONY M. REARDON, 
National President.

Re H.R. 6087, the Improving Access to Work-
ers’ Compensation for Injured Federal 
Workers Act, under suspension in the 
House of Representatives. 
Hon. NANCY PELOSI, 
Speaker, 
House of Representatives. 
Hon. KEVIN MCCARTHY, 
Minority Leader, 
House of Representatives. 
DEAR SPEAKER PELOSI AND MINORITY LEAD-
ER MCCARTHY: The National Rural Health 
Association (NRHA) writes in support of 
House passage for H.R. 6087, the Improving 
Access to Workers’ Compensation for Injured 
Federal Workers Act, which is scheduled to 
be considered by the House of Representa-
tives this week. This legislation would allow 
nurse practitioners (NP) and physician as-
sistants (PA) to diagnose, treat, and provide 
care for federal employees who are injured at 
work, consistent with state scope of prac-
tice. In fact, most states already authorize 
NPs to provide this care for non-federal em-
ployees. 
NRHA is a non-profit membership organi-
zation with more than 21,000 members na-
tionwide that provides leadership on rural 
health issues. Our membership includes 
every component of rural America’s health 
care, including rural community hospitals, 
critical access hospitals, doctors, nurses, and 
patients. We provide leadership on rural 
health issues through advocacy, communica-
tions, education, and research. 
NRHA is supportive of this legislation as 
NPs and PAs are common primary care pro-
viders in rural communities. According to 
MedPAC, in 2018 advanced practice reg-
istered nurses (APRN) and PAs accounted for 
a third of all primary care clinicians treat-
ing Medicare beneficiaries nationwide. In 
rural communities, their presence is closer 
to half of the primary care clinicians. Be-
cause of the significant presence of NPs and 
PAs, and the quality of care they provide, 
NRHA urges swift passage of this legislation. 
This commonsense bill will ensure increased 
access to needed services in our rural areas. 
Thank you for your consideration of this 
important legislation. If you have questions, 
please contact Josh Jorgensen.

ALAN MORGAN,

Compensation for injured Federal Workers 
Act. This legislation would retire outdated 
barriers in the Federal Employees’ Com-
pensation Act (FECA) that limit the ability 
of NPs to provide care and treatment for in-
jured or ill federal employees. AANP thanks 
you for you continued efforts to improve the 
health care system for our nation’s federal 
employees. 
Currently, federal employees can select an 
NP as their health care provider under the 
Federal Employees Health Benefits Program 
(FEHPB), and the majority of states author-
ize NPs to provide the diagnosis and treat-
ment for a workplace related injury. How-
ever, contrary to the workers’ compensation 
process in most states, FECA requires that 
only a physician can make the diagnosis, 
certify the injury and extent of the dis-
ability, and oversee the patient’s treatment 
and care. This barrier places an additional 
burden on the over two million federal em-
ployees, 
depriving 
them 
from 
receiving 
health care from their provider of choice, as 
well as hindering timely access to care and 
continuity of care. 
As you know, H.R. 6087 would update the 
federal workers’ compensation program and 
authorize NPs to certify disabilities and 
oversee treatment for injured or ill federal 
employees under FECA. This would improve 
access to health care for injured or ill federal 
employees, particularly in rural and under-
served communities, and better align the 
federal workers’ compensation program with 
the majority of states and FEHBP. By updat-
ing FECA to authorize federal employees to 
select their health care provider of choice 
when they are injured or become ill in the 
course of their federal employment, greater 
access, overall efficiency and better con-
tinuity of care can be achieved. We thank 
you for this impactful legislation and look 
forward to continuing to work with you to 
ensure H.R. 6087 becomes law. 
Thank you again for your tireless efforts 
on behalf of federal employees. Should you 
have comments or questions, please direct 
them to MaryAnne Sapio, V.P. Federal Gov-
ernment Affairs.

JON FANNING, MS, CAE, CNED, 
Chief Executive Officer,

Hon. JOE COURTNEY,

Hon. TIM WALBERG, 
Washington, DC. 
DEAR
REPRESENTATIVES
COURTNEY
AND 
WALBERG: On behalf of the more than 151,000 
PAs (physician assistants) throughout the 
United States, the American Academy of 
PAs (AAPA) lends strong support to H.R. 
6087, the Improving Access to Worker’s Com-
pensation for Injured Federal Workers Act. 
AAPA thanks you for your continued sup-
port of the federal workforce and unwavering 
commitment to ensuring that all Americans 
have access to high-quality healthcare. 
As you know, U.S. federal and postal em-
ployees receive workers compensation cov-
erage through the Federal Employee’s Com-
pensation Act (FECA) for employment-re-
lated injuries and occupational disease. How-
ever, as currently written, FECA does not 
cover medical care provided by PAs within 
the definition of ‘‘medical, surgical, and hos-
pital services . . .’’ and FECA claims signed 
by PAs are routinely denied. This undue re-
striction negatively impacts federal employ-
ees, especially those in rural and under-
served areas, who receive primary care from 
PAs. 
PAs practice in all medical and surgical 
specialties in all 50 states, the District of Co-
lumbia, U.S. territories, and the uniformed 
services. PAs provide high-quality, cost-ef-
fective medical care in every specialty and 
setting, undertake rigorous education and 
clinical training, and are well established as 
medical professionals. PAs are recognized as 
qualified healthcare providers under Medi-
care, Medicaid, and almost every state and 
federal healthcare program, including state 
workers’ compensation programs. PAs are 
also included in the definition of an ‘‘accept-
able medical source’’ by the Social Security 
Administration for the purposes of certifying 
that an individual has a medically deter-
minable impairment. Further, thousands of 
PAs are employed by the federal government 
as healthcare providers and work within the 
Department of Veterans Affairs, the Depart-
ment of Defense, the Public Health Service, 
and Indian Health Services. However, PAs 
are not considered healthcare providers 
within FECA, an oversight that does not 
align with state or other federal programs. 
H.R. 6087 would ensure that federal em-
ployees can access high-quality healthcare 
from the provider of their choice, as well as 
further align FECA with state workers com-
pensation programs which recognize PAs as 
covered providers. It is well within the edu-
cation and training of PAs to provide treat-
ment to federal employees who are injured in 
the course of their work for the government, 
and it is time to remove this outdated and 
unnecessary restriction. 
AAPA appreciates your work and dedica-
tion to the federal workforce and our na-
tion’s healthcare system. If we can be of as-
sistance to you on this or any issue, please 
do not hesitate to contact Tate Heuer, AAPA 
Vice President, Federal Advocacy. 
Sincerely 
LISA M. GABLES, CPA, 
Chief Executive Officer. 
Mr. COURTNEY. Madam Speaker, I 
reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. WALBERG. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
I appreciate that information being 
shared, but I would like to address 
some of the concerns that my good 
friends from the Doc Caucus have pre-
sented. 
We have discussed this in committee 
representing districts that are rural, 
urban, and suburban, and the chal-
lenges that are there. Again, the issue 
of States’ rights and the ability of 
States to make decisions, there is a 
primacy that is there that we ought to 
consider very strongly. 
A majority of States already allow 
nurse practitioners and PAs to diag-
nose, certify an injury, and oversee pa-
tients’ treatment. Furthermore, if we 
are talking about precedent, our bill 
will align the FECA program with 
other Federal programs currently in 
place. Currently, the Federal Govern-
ment allows care provided or overseen 
by PAs and NPs in, I state it again, 
Medicare, Medicaid, the Federal Em-
ployees Health Benefits Program, and 
TRICARE. 
That is significant. Those are text-
book studies on how it is working al-
ready. Adding to this just seems like it 
is justified and very important to do. 
Going back to the States’ concerns, 
as well, if diagnosing or treating a par-
ticular workplace injury is outside of 
the scope of practice for a nurse practi-
tioner or a physician assistant under 
their State’s law, then they would not 
be covered under this bill, plain and 
simple. 
The 
bill 
preserves 
States’ 
rights to make those determinations. 
H.R. 6087 is simply expanding choice, 
important at this time, especially with 
inflation and the cost that is going on 
in coming out of a pandemic and get-
ting in endemic situations. 
The Congressional Budget Office, I 
repeat, noted that the bill would not 
affect direct spending. In fact, CBO 
noted in its score that the bill may re-
sult in injured workers receiving treat-
ment faster and, as my colleague Rep-
resentative COURTNEY said, thereby re-
turning them to work and productivity 
more quickly and reducing the actual 
cost for some FECA costs in the proc-
ess. 
Getting workers healthy and back to 
work is not only good for the indi-
vidual but also good for our economy 
as we look to get through these worri-
some economic times. 
b 1530 
I accept the concerns of the medical 
doctors. I understand that they have 
committed themselves to significant 
training and significant time in the 
classroom and in the hospital itself, 
but we also know that we have come of 
an age where doctors very regularly 
use the services and need the services 
of nurse practitioners and physician as-
sistants. 
There are communities in my dis-
trict, in rural areas, where the doctor 
is a physician assistant. The people ap-
preciate them and receive good care as 
well. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to 
the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. ROD-
NEY DAVIS). 
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. 
Madam Speaker, I thank my good 
friend, Mr. WALBERG, and appreciate 
his leadership on this issue and also, 
the bipartisanship that is being shown 
to the American people today to ad-
dress an issue that is important—to 
Ranking Member FOXX, too—to our 
communities. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in support of 
H.R. 6087 because of what has been said. 
The positive impact that this bill can 
have within our medical communities, 
and giving Americans access to the 
healthcare that they deserve is some-
thing that deserves all of our support. 
This bill would include physician as-
sistants and nurse practitioners in the 
Federal workers’ compensation pro-
gram and put them in line with the 
State scope of practice. It is also going 
to improve access to care for injured 
Federal workers and postal employers, 
especially in the areas that I serve—in 
rural and underserved areas—like cen-
tral and southwestern Illinois. 
Getting people back to work as soon 
as they can once they recover from an 
injury is now more important than 
ever given the record inflation we are 
seeing and the staggering 11.4 million 
open jobs in this country. 
This is a commonsense piece of legis-
lation. I am glad to support the work

DEAR
REPRESENTATIVES
COURTNEY
AND 
WALBERG: On behalf of the Steering Com-
mittee of the Nursing Community Coalition 
(NCC), which represents 63 national nursing 
organizations, we are pleased to support H.R. 
6087, the Improving Access to Workers’ Com-
pensation for Injured Federal Workers Act, 
which would retire outdated barriers in the 
Federal 
Employees’ 
Compensation 
Act 
(FECA) that limit the ability of Nurse Prac-
titioners (NPs) to provide care and treat-
ment for injured or ill federal employees. 
The NCC is a cross section of education, 
practice, research, and regulation within the 
nursing profession representing Registered 
Nurses (RNs), Advanced Practice Registered 
Nurses (APRNs), nurse leaders, students, fac-
ulty, and researchers. We appreciate your 
continued efforts to improve the health care 
system for our nation’s federal employees 
and strongly support passage of H.R. 6087. 
Currently, federal employees can select an 
NP as their health care provider under the 
Federal Employees Health Benefits Program 
(FEHPB), and the majority of states author-
ize NPs to provide the diagnosis and treat-
ment for a workplace related injury. How-
ever, contrary to the workers’ compensation 
process in most states, FECA requires that 
only a physician can make the diagnosis, 
certify the injury and extent of the dis-
ability, and oversee the patient’s treatment 
and care. This barrier places an additional 
burden on the over two million federal em-
ployees, 
depriving 
them 
from 
receiving 
health care from their provider of choice, as 
well as hindering timely access to care and 
continuity of care. 
H.R. 6087 would update the federal workers’ 
compensation program and authorize NPs to 
certify disabilities and oversee treatment for 
injured or ill federal employees under FECA. 
This would improve access to health care for 
injured or ill federal employees, particularly 
in rural and underserved communities, and 
better align the federal workers’ compensa-
tion program with the majority of states and 
FEHBP. By updating FECA to authorize fed-
eral employees to select their health care 
provider of choice when they are injured or 
become ill in the course of their federal em-
ployment, greater access, overall efficiency 
and 
better

be 
achieved. 
We appreciate this important legislation 
and strongly support passage of H.R. 6087, 
the Improving Access to Workers’ Compensa-
tion for Injured Federal Workers Act. Should 
you have any questions or if the Nursing 
Community Coalition can be of any addi-
tional assistance please contact the coali-

Mr. COURTNEY. Madam Speaker, I 
am prepared to close and I reserve the 
balance of my time. 
Mr. WALBERG. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, we have all heard of 
the physician shortage in America. 
Nurse practitioners and physician as-
sistants are a critical component in 
fulfilling the provider gap. There are 
355,000 nurse practitioners and more 
than 150,000 physician assistants across 
the country. 
These healthcare professionals have 
advanced degrees from nationally ac-
credited programs and include both 
classroom and clinical rotations and 
must demonstrate clinical competency. 
Allowing 
nurse 
practitioners 
and 
physician assistants to diagnose, cer-
tify, and treat injured Federal workers 
to the full extent of their State license 
is not only common sense but is smart 
economic policy to ensure workers get 
back to work more quickly and off gov-
ernment supported programs. 
The bill will not remove physicians 
from providing care to an injured 
worker if that is who the patient 
chooses. The bill is simply giving in-
jured workers more choice to get the 
timely care they need. 
The CBO scored the bill as having in-
significant impact on direct spending 
and noted, may result, in fact, in in-
jured workers receiving treatment fast-
er, thereby returning to work more 
quickly and reducing costs for the 
FECA program. 
Lastly, the FECA program is vir-
tually 
the 
last 
remaining 
Federal 
health program that does not recognize 
the role that PAs and NPs play in mod-
ern healthcare delivery. They can al-
ready provide and oversee care in Medi-
care, Medicaid, the Federal Employee 
Health Benefits program, the VA, DOD, 
Indian Health Service, and the Bureau 
of Prisons, and are recognized by the 
Social Security Administration. 
Furthermore, the bill aligns with the 
majority of States which already au-
thorize NPs and PAs to certify and 
oversee healthcare for patients in their 
State 
workers’ 
compensation 
pro-
grams. 
This is a commonsense, bipartisan 
bill that will make the Federal work-
ers’ compensation program more effi-
cient and ensure workers have access 
to a health provider of their choice. 
Madam Speaker, I thank Chairman 
SCOTT, Ranking Member FOXX, and Mr. 
COURTNEY for their support of this bill, 
and I urge the rest of my colleagues to 
support this bill. I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. COURTNEY. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself the balance of my time. 
Mr. WALBERG’s eloquence, and com-
prehensive closing statement I think 
really said it all. I tip my hat to him, 
Ranking Member FOXX, Mr. DAVIS from 
the minority side of the aisle, and the 
speakers on this side that really rep-
resent a bipartisan message that we 
are prepared to get our Federal Em-
ployee 
Workers’ 
Compensation 
Act 
modernized so that the hard work of 
nurse practitioners and physician as-
sistants and the work that they do 
every single day around the country is 
now extended to a critical part of our 
healthcare system and also our Federal 
disability benefits system. 
This is really about giving patients a 
choice. There is nothing in this bill 
that mandates that they can’t go to a 
physician or that they don’t have that 
option. In some areas people just don’t 
have that choice. If you are in a place 
where the only real access is to a phy-
sician assistant or a nurse practitioner, 
sometimes for even a life-threatening 
injury, we need to open the door to 
give people that opportunity. That is 
precisely what this bill does. 
It came out of committee with a 
unanimous vote. I strongly urge all of 
my colleagues from both sides of the 
aisle to follow the lead of the Edu-
cation and Labor Committee and pass 
this bill with an overwhelming major-
ity. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, as a 
steadfast ally of the men and women serving 
in the federal government, I rise in support of 
H.R. 6087, the ‘‘Improving Access to Workers’ 
Compensation for Injured Federal Workers 
Act.’’ 
This bill allows for injured federal workers to 
consult with nurse practitioners or physician 
assistants for the diagnosis and treatment of 
injuries covered by workers’ compensation. 
H.R. 6087 will make a needed correction to 
the Federal Employees Compensation Act, in-
creasing the accessibility of healthcare for 
nearly three million federal employees. 
Nurse practitioners and physician assistants 
represent a growing portion of American pri-
mary care providers, especially for medically 
underserved communities. 
We must prioritize the needs of our invalu-
able federal workers. Lowering the bureau-
cratic obstacles blocking federal workers’ ac-
cess to benefits is a necessary measure to 
protect them. 
When Congress has an opportunity to rem-
edy real-world issues with bipartisan action, 
especially when it improves the lives of gov-
ernment employees, it is our responsibility to 
act. 
H.R. 6087 is especially critical in the face of 
the increasing workplace risks associated with 
COVID–19, in which situation an expanded list 
of approved medical providers can help fill the 
coverage gap. 
The pandemic has already stressed the 
health and wellbeing of federal workers. 
Amending the Federal Employees Compensa-
tion Act is imperative to lessen that burden. 
According to the Office of Personnel Man-
agement, Texas has 143,087 federal workers. 
I will always fight for these workers by stand-
ing up for their access to healthcare.

PPP AND BANK FRAUD ENFORCE-

2022 
Ms. VELA´ ZQUEZ. Madam Speaker, I 
move to suspend the rules and pass the 
bill (H.R. 7352) to amend the Small 
Business Act to extend the statute of 
limitation for fraud by borrowers under 
the Paycheck Protection Program, and 
for other purposes. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 7352 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘PPP and 
Bank Fraud Enforcement Harmonization Act 
of 2022’’. 
SEC. 2. FRAUD ENFORCEMENT HARMONIZATION. 
(a) PAYCHECK PROTECTION PROGRAM.—Sec-
tion 7(a)(36) of the Small Business Act (15

MEYER) each will control 20 minutes.

woman from New York. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Ms. VELA´ ZQUEZ. Madam Speaker, I 
ask unanimous consent that all Mem-
bers have 5 legislative days in which to 
revise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on the meas-
ure under consideration. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from New York? 
There was no objection. 
Ms. VELA´ ZQUEZ. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, I thank all the 
members on the Small Business Com-
mittee for their work and support of 
the bills before us. 
The legislation we are considering is, 
once again, a product of our commit-
tee’s bipartisanship and shows that we 
are committed to our Nation’s entre-
preneurs. 
The seven bipartisan bills we are con-
sidering will promote economic growth 
on our Main Streets in numerous ways. 
The first two reaffirm our commit-
ment to being good stewards of tax-
payer dollars, and the importance of 
holding pandemic fraudsters account-
able for their crimes. 
The second pair of bills under consid-
eration will help small firms attract 
and retain qualified employees by 
boosting apprenticeships and career 
and technical education programs. 
Finally, we will consider three bills 
to improve the Federal procurement 
process and promote opportunities for 
small businesses to secure contracts 
from the Federal Government. 
The first bill under consideration 
today is H.R. 7352, the PPP and Bank 
Fraud Enforcement Harmonization Act 
of 2022, introduced by myself and our 
ranking member from Missouri (Mr. 
LUETKEMEYER). 
H.R. 7352 sets the statute of limita-
tions for all cases of PPP fraud at 10 
years, consistent with the statute of 
limitations for bank fraud. 
Under current law, bank-originated 
PPP fraud is being prosecuted as bank 
fraud, which has a 10-year statute of 
limitations. 
At the same time, PPP loans origi-
nated by nonbank lenders, including 
fintech companies, are often pros-
ecuted as wire fraud, which carries a 5- 
year statute of limitations. 
To address this difference, the bill 
extends the time for prosecutors to 
bring charges to 10 years for all cases 
of PPP fraud, regardless of whether the 
lender was a bank or fintech company. 
SBA’s Office of Inspector General 
identified over 70,000 PPP loans total-
ing over $4.6 billion in potentially 
fraudulent PPP loans, many of which 
originated with fintechs. 
According to researchers at the Uni-
versity of Texas at Austin, fintech 
companies handled 75 percent of PPP 
loans connected to fraud by the DOJ, 
despite originating only 15 percent of 
the loans overall. 
As of March 10, the DOJ’s efforts 
have 
resulted 
in 
criminal 
charges 
against over a thousand defendants 
with alleged losses exceeding $1.1 bil-
lion and over 240 civil investigations 
into more than 1,800 individuals and 
entities for alleged misconduct in con-
nection with pandemic relief loans to-
taling more than $6 billion. 
Given the extent of potential fraud, 
especially among the subset of PPP 
loans originated by nonbank lenders, 
we 
must 
ensure 
prosecutors 
have 
enough time to fully investigate and 
bring fraud charges. 
As of now, the statute of limitations 
for nonbank PPP loans secured in April 
2020 will expire in 2025 in most cases, 
less than 3 years away. That is not 
enough time given the complexity of 
these fraud schemes. 
As the chair of the Small Business 
Committee, I take my role over the 
SBA and its program very seriously. 
That is why I sponsored this bill to 
give the DOJ, FBI, and State and local 
law enforcement the resources and 
time they need to bring these bad ac-
tors to justice. 
Madam Speaker, I thank Ranking 
Member LUETKEMEYER for joining me 
in leading this effort, and to the mem-
bers of the Small Business Committee 
for their support. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to support this bill, and I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
b 1545 
Mr. LUETKEMEYER. Madam Speak-
er, I yield myself such time as I may 
consume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in support of 
H.R. 7352, the PPP and Bank Fraud En-
forcement Harmonization Act of 2022. 
Inflation and price increases con-
tinue to hinder all Americans and espe-
cially small businesses and their work-
ers. Prices at the pump and prices on 
the shelves rattle the mettle of the Na-
tion’s job creators. Month after month, 
small businesses face price increases 
that not only prevent expansion and 
growth but also hamper recovery. 
These economic conditions must im-
prove, and we must get a firm grip on 
reckless spending coming out of Wash-
ington. Similarly, we must take on a 
stronger oversight role when it comes 
to investigating fraudulent COVID–19 
behavior. 
When America’s small 
businesses 
faced State and local COVID shutdown 
orders, Congress moved quickly and 
stood up the Paycheck Protection Pro-
gram. To ensure small businesses and 
their workers received PPP relief in an 
efficient and speedy manner, Congress 
required private-sector lenders to be 
the drivers of the program. The result 
speaks volumes with nearly $800 billion 
disbursed to small businesses. 
As the Republican leader on the Com-
mittee on Small Business, I often hear 
about how important the program was 
for small businesses across our great 
Nation. It was the lifeline that many of 
them needed to be able to survive. 
While most lenders’ fraud defenses 
were strong due to Federal financial 
rules such as Know Your Customer, 
fraudulent behavior did take place. In-
vestigations are underway, but more 
time will be needed and required to 
bring justice to those who defrauded 
the program. 
Depending on the type of lender that 
participated in the program, the cur-
rent statute of limitations ranges from 
5 years for wire fraud that categorizes

June 7, 2022 
many fintech lenders, who have been 
associated with problematic loans, to 
10 years for banks and credit unions 
that fall under bank fraud. 
H.R. 7352, the PPP and Bank Fraud 
Enforcement Harmonization Act of 
2022, takes important steps to create 
an across-the-board 10-year statute of 
limitations on all loans handed out 
through the PPP program. This change 
will ensure all law enforcement and in-
spectors general have the time to track 
down all wrongdoing no matter the 
type of lender. 
H.R. 7352 was created via voice vote 
in committee. I thank the chair for 
treating this issue with the priority it 
deserves and for working with me on 
the bills before us today. This bill is a 
step in the right direction, and I urge 
my colleagues to support it. 
In closing, Madam Speaker, when 
Congress raced to save American small 
businesses, criminal actors lurked in 
the shadows. Although one of the most 
popular COVID–19 relief measures, the 
PPP program, has firmly moved into 
the loan forgiveness period, the inves-
tigations surrounding illicit behavior 
have just begun. 
H.R. 7352 will wisely ensure all loans 
handed out through the program, no 
matter the type of lender, have a stat-
ute of limitations window of 10 years. 
According to some of the most recent 
SBA inspector general reports, nearly 
$4.6 billion of the $800 billion could be 
potentially fraudulent. While these 
numbers will surely change, it is para-
mount that we provide law enforce-
ment the runway to track down all 
fraudulent behavior. These are Amer-
ican taxpayer dollars on the line, and 
they must be protected. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to support this legislation, and 
I yield back the balance of my time. 
Ms. VELA´ ZQUEZ. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself the balance of my time. 
Madam Speaker, we must continue 
supporting the work of our Federal, 
State, and local law enforcement agen-
cies as they investigate and prosecute 
pandemic loan fraud. It appears the 
bulk of PPP loan fraud was originated 
by nonbank lenders and fintech compa-
nies, which may not be prosecuted as 
bank fraud and is therefore subject to a 
much shorter statute of limitations. 
This presents the possibility that 
pandemic loan fraudsters may get off 
the hook because the statute of limita-
tions expired. We simply cannot let 
this happen. This bill would give law 
enforcement agencies the time needed 
to hold fraudsters accountable and 
bring them to justice. 
Once again, I thank our ranking 
member, Mr. LUETKEMEYER, for work-
ing with me to lead this important ef-
fort, and all the members of the Small 
Business Committee for their bipar-
tisan work on this bill. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to vote ‘‘yes,’’ and I yield back 
the balance of my time. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, I rise 
in support of H.R. 7352—the ‘‘PPP and Bank 
Fraud Enforcement Harmonization Act of 
2022’’ extends the statute of limitation and 
provides 
a 
timeframe 
in 
which 
criminal 
charges can be filed against those accused of 
fraud in connection with the ‘‘Paycheck Pro-
tection Program’’ and ‘‘Paycheck Protection 
Program Second Draw Loans’’ program. 
The Paycheck Protection Program com-
monly known as the ‘‘PPP’’ loan was created 
as a part of the CARES Act—the Covid Aid, 
Relief, and Economic Security Act—of March 
2020. 
The PPP loan was established to help small 
businesses survive through the COVID–19 
pandemic of 2020, so that they may be able 
to pay their employees and keep their busi-
nesses operating during the tumultuous chal-
lenges imposed by COVID–19. 
I urge everyone to remember the times be-
fore the recent reemergence of a ‘‘business as 
usual’’ stance that many have now taken, and 
remember the omnipresent news reports 
about the horrific and ever-increasing death 
toll. 
Any person who was willing, for their own fi-
nancial gain, to take advantage of that situa-
tion and the emergency funding that was in-
tended for those who needed it most during 
the gruesome pandemic deserves to be pun-
ished for their heinous actions. 
H.R. 7352 would extend the statute of limi-
tation for prosecution of loans classified within 
the PPP and Economic Injury Disaster Loan 
(EIDL) categories under the Small Business 
Act. 
As it stands now, bank-originated PPP fraud 
is being prosecuted as bank fraud which car-
ries a 10-year statute of limitations. 
In contrast, loans that originated through fi-
nancial 
technology 
avenues—known 
as 
Fintech—are currently subject to only a 5-year 
statute of limitations because they are gov-
erned by wire fraud laws. 
H.R. 7352 will ensure that we are doing our 
duty to uphold justice and gather all necessary 
information and evidence, while extending the 
reach of the law against these violators. 
PPP fraud comes at the expense of all 
Americans, tax-paying Americans who work 
hard for the money they earn. 
H.R. 7352 will ensure that there’s ample 
time allotted for special attention to the com-
plex nature of PPP loan fraud. 
Ensuring that the timeframe is fair and com-
mensurate with the severity of the nature of 
loan fraud, H.R. 7352 will make sure that jus-
tice is served in every regard. 
I ask that each of my colleagues joins me 
in support of H.R. 7352.

question is on the motion offered by 
the gentlewoman from New York (Ms. 
VELA´ ZQUEZ) that the House suspend the

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5251 
June 7, 2022 
Madam Speaker, I rise in support of 
H.R. 7334, the COVID–19 EIDL Fraud 
Statute of Limitations Act of 2022, in-
troduced by the ranking member, Mr. 
LUETKEMEYER, and cosponsored by my-
self. 
As with the PPP and Bank Fraud En-
forcement Harmonization Act, this bill 
will extend the statute of limitations 
for COVID–19 EIDL fraud cases to 10 
years to allow prosecutors more time 
to do their jobs. The bills are com-
panion pieces of legislation and much- 
needed to help law enforcement inves-
tigate and bring fraud charges. 
Congress amended the SBA disaster 
loan program at the start of the pan-
demic to allow small businesses facing 
economic injury due to COVID to apply 
for SBA disaster loans which were 
originally designed for natural disas-
ters. At the same time, SBA lowered 
the guardrails and disbursed funds 
quickly to provide stability to the 
small business economy, which, as we 
all know, was facing unprecedented un-
certainty in 2020. 
In a very short time, the program 
went from one that responds to natural 
disasters in a few, distinct geographic 
areas, depending on the nature of the 
disaster, to one that was responding to 
a nationwide crisis almost overnight. 
Overall, the COVID EIDL program ap-
proved almost 4 million loans totaling 
over $378 billion. 
The SBA administrator transitioned 
the program to the Office of Capital 
Access to dedicate additional manage-
ment capacity. Since that transition, 
the office closed out a backlog of near-
ly 1 million applicants and increased 
loan officer productivity while improv-
ing the customer service experience 
and solidifying robust fraud controls. 
Nevertheless, 
throughout 
the 
pan-
demic, our committee held numerous 
oversight hearings with SBA’s inspec-
tor general who testified that there is 
a great deal of potential fraud in this 
program, and it would be a decades- 
long effort to fully investigate. 
The IG’s office identified $78 billion 
in potentially fraudulent activity in 
the EIDL program as well as over $6 
billion in loans and grants related to 
identity theft allegations. Given the 
degree of potential fraud, we need to 
give prosecutors more time to bring 
fraudsters to justice. This bill will give 
law enforcement the time needed to 
conduct their investigations of COVID 
EIDL fraud. 
That is why I cosponsored this bill 
which will go a long way towards en-
hancing oversight and accountability. 
Madam Speaker, I thank the ranking 
member, Mr. LUETKEMEYER, for intro-
ducing this important measure, and to 
the members of the Small Business 
Committee for unanimously approving 
this important piece of legislation. 
I urge all Members to support this 
bill, and I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. LUETKEMEYER. Madam Speak-
er, I yield myself such time as I may 
consume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in support of 
H.R. 7334, the COVID–19 EIDL Fraud 
Statute of Limitations Act of 2022. 
Similar to the previous bill, the Pay-
check Protection Program, the Small 
Business Administration’s Economic 
Injury Disaster Loan program, known 
as EIDL, was also activated as the Na-
tion’s small businesses were being shut 
down due to COVID–19. However, un-
like PPP, EIDL was a direct loan and 
grant program through the SBA. Un-
fortunately, the SBA acting as a direct 
lender and grantor has been problem-
atic and has resulted in billions of po-
tentially fraudulent dollars flowing to 
criminals. 
In fact, the SBA’s inspector general 
has reported that as much as $84.4 bil-
lion within the $400 billion program 
could be fraudulent. Moreover, over 1 
million applications have been flagged 
for identity theft concerns. This is un-
acceptable and must be addressed. 
H.R. 7334, the COVID–19 EIDL Fraud 
Statute of Limitations Act of 2022 
takes the first step and establishes a 
10-year statute of limitations window 
to ensure law enforcement and the 
SBA’s inspector general have the time 
to investigate all wrongdoing. This 
change is even more important as the 
SBA continues to defer all EIDL pay-
ments, thus clouding the true extent of 
fraud within the program. 
Madam Speaker, I thank the chair 
for working with me on this measure 
which passed out of committee unani-
mously earlier in May. 
If we are to take COVID relief fraud 
seriously, then we need to ensure law 
enforcement has what it needs to catch 
and prosecute all criminals. H.R. 7334 
provides them the time to act. 
Madam Speaker, I wholeheartedly 
believe this bill is instrumental when 
it comes to fraud recoupment. I urge 
my colleagues to support it, and I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Ms. VELA´ ZQUEZ. Madam Speaker, I 
continue to reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. LUETKEMEYER. Madam Speak-
er, I yield such time as he may con-
sume to the gentleman from Pennsyl-
vania (Mr. MEUSER), who is the ranking 
member of the Subcommittee on Eco-
nomic Growth, Tax and Capital Access. 
Mr. MEUSER. Madam Speaker, I 
thank 
the 
ranking 
member, 
Mr. 
LUETKEMEYER, for his leadership on 
this bill and in committee. 
The EIDL program, Madam Speaker, 
was established to deliver relief to 
struggling small businesses during the 
pandemic. This is why I rise today in 
support of H.R. 7334. 
Unlike the public-private partnership 
that was Paycheck Protection Pro-
gram, the EIDL program was a direct 
loan program administered by the 
SBA, not in partnership with private 
lenders. 
The SBA’s inspector general has esti-
mated that there is approximately $84.4 
billion in potential fraudulent EIDL 
activity, over 20 percent of all EIDL 
loans extended. 
With this massive level of potential 
fraud, it is imperative that this House 
passes 
Ranking 
Member 
LUETKE-
MEYER’s bill to extend the current 5- 
year statute of limitations for SBA 
grants and loans to 10 years. In doing 
so we can allow for authorities to in-
vestigate the egregious amount of po-
tential fraud in the EIDL program and 
ensure accountability for those who 
took advantage of the EIDL program 
to defraud the American people. 
Madam Speaker, I note that this bill 
had strong bipartisan support and 
passed out of the Small Business Com-
mittee by voice vote last month. I urge 
my colleagues to support this impor-
tant legislation. 
Ms. VELA´ ZQUEZ. Madam Speaker, I 
continue to reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. LUETKEMEYER. Madam Speak-
er, I yield such time as she may con-
sume to the gentlewoman from New 
York (Ms. TENNEY), who is the ranking 
member of the Subcommittee on Un-
derserved, 
Agricultural, 
and 
Rural 
Business Development. 
b 1600 
Ms. TENNEY. Madam Speaker, since 
the onset of the pandemic, Congress 
has passed several COVID–19 relief bills 
totaling an unprecedented $5.3 trillion. 
While some of this spending was un-
wise, other programs, like the Pay-
check Protection Program, provided 
much-needed relief to employers and 
businesses devastated by the pandemic. 
One particular area of concern is the 
COVID–19 Economic Industry Disaster 
Loan program, otherwise known as 
EIDL. This program, unlike other re-
lief programs, was direct lending by 
the SBA, the Small Business Adminis-
tration. This means the agency did not 
partner with our local banks and credit 
unions and, instead, approved and ad-
ministered these loans directly. 
Since the COVID–19 EIDL funding 
passed, we have learned of countless 
cases of fraud, waste, and abuse. The 
Federal Government is simply not set 
up to be a direct lender. 
This is one reason I introduced the 
House version of the Transparency in 
COVID–19 
Expenditures 
Act, 
which 
would require an audit of all Federal 
COVID–19 relief spending. There is ob-
viously room for improvement in pro-
viding additional oversight and return-
ing fraudulently awarded funds back to 
the taxpayers. 
In 
response, 
Ranking 
Member 
LUETKEMEYER has done great work in-
troducing the COVID–19 Economic In-
dustry Disaster Loans Fraud Statute of 
Limitations Act of 2022 that will help 
fix part of the shortcomings by expand-
ing the statute of limitations for EIDL 
loans and fraud from 6 to 10 years, the 
same as bank fraud. This will give offi-
cials a greater window to track down 
fraudulent activity and hold bad actors 
accountable. 
No one should be wrongly profiting 
from the need to distribute aid during 
this pandemic. The American tax-
payers deserve better, and I applaud

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5252 
June 7, 2022 
the ranking member’s efforts on this. I 
urge all my colleagues to support this. 
Ms. VELA´ ZQUEZ. Madam Speaker, I 
have no further speakers, and I am pre-
pared to close. I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. LUETKEMEYER. Madam Speak-
er, I have no further speakers, and I am 
prepared to close. I yield myself such 
time as I may consume. 
Madam Speaker, fraud associated 
with the EIDL program is a serious 
matter. Due to mismanagement and 
poor oversight capabilities, the EIDL 
program has been overwhelmed with 
fraud. 
As I mentioned earlier, the SBA’s in-
spector general has found more than 
$80 billion within the $400 billion pro-
gram that could potentially be fraudu-
lent. This represents a double-digit 
fraud rate. 
However, recouping these dollars has 
just begun and the current statute of 
limitations is limited. My bill, H.R. 
7334, will ensure the statute of limita-
tions runway is recalibrated and ex-
tended out to 10 years. By passing this 
bill, Congress will allow the time need-
ed to correct all wrongdoing within the 
program. 
I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 
7334, and I yield back the balance of my 
time. 
Ms. VELA´ ZQUEZ. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, our Federal, State, 
and local law enforcement agencies are 
diligently 
investigating 
and 
pros-
ecuting pandemic loan fraud, and we 
must continue to support those efforts, 
whether in the COVID EIDL program 
or the Paycheck Protection Program. 
We all agree that anyone who took 
advantage of this once-in-a-lifetime 
crisis to commit fraud and enrich 
themselves at the expense of hard-
working Main Street businesses must 
be held accountable. 
It is unacceptable to allow anyone to 
get off the hook for defrauding a gov-
ernment relief program simply because 
the statute of limitations expired. We 
cannot let this happen, and we must 
pass this bill. 
Once again, I thank our Ranking 
Member, Mr. LUETKEMEYER, for intro-
ducing this important measure, and I 
am pleased to support it. 
I also thank all the members of the 
Small Business Committee for their bi-
partisan work on this bill, and I urge 
my colleagues to vote ‘‘yes.’’ 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentlewoman from New York (Ms. 
VELA´ ZQUEZ) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 7334. 
The question was taken. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the 
opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being 
in the affirmative, the ayes have it. 
Mrs. GREENE of Georgia. Madam 
Speaker, on that I demand the yeas 
and nays. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to section 3(s) of House Resolution 
8, the yeas and nays are ordered. 
Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, fur-
ther proceedings on this motion are 
postponed.

HUBZONE 
PRICE 
EVALUATION 
PREFERENCE 
CLARIFICATION 
ACT OF 2021 
Ms. VELA´ ZQUEZ. Madam Speaker, I 
move to suspend the rules and pass the 
bill (H.R. 5879) to amend the Small 
Business Act to clarify the application 
of the price evaluation preference for 
qualified HUBZone small business con-
cerns to certain contracts, and for 
other purposes. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 5879 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Hubzone 
Price Evaluation Preference Clarification 
Act of 2021’’. 
SEC. 2. APPLICATION OF PRICE EVALUATION 
PREFERENCE 
FOR 
QUALIFIED 
HUBZONE SMALL BUSINESS CON-
CERNS TO CERTAIN CONTRACTS. 
(a) IN
GENERAL.—Section 31(c)(3) of the 
Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 657a(c)(3)) is 
amended by adding at the end the following 
new subparagraph: 
‘‘(E) APPLICATION TO CERTAIN CONTRACTS.— 
The requirements of subparagraph (A) shall 
apply to an unrestricted order issued under 
an unrestricted multiple award contract or 
the unrestricted portion of a contract that is 
partially set aside for competition restricted 
to small business concerns.’’. 
(b) RULEMAKING.—Not later than 90 days 
after the date of the enactment of this sec-
tion, the Administrator of the Small Busi-
ness Administration shall revise any rule or 
guidance to implement the requirements of 
this section. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentlewoman from 
New York (Ms. VELA´ ZQUEZ) and the 
gentleman from Missouri (Mr. LUETKE-
MEYER) each will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from New York. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Ms. VELA´ ZQUEZ. Madam Speaker, I 
ask unanimous consent that all Mem-
bers may have 5 legislative days in 
which to revise and extend their re-
marks and include extraneous material 
on the measure under consideration. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from New York? 
There was no objection. 
Ms. VELA´ ZQUEZ. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today in sup-
port of H.R. 5879, the HUBZone Price 
Evaluation 
Preference 
Clarification 
Act of 2021. 
The HUBZone program is a con-
tracting assistance program based on 
locality. It helps small businesses in 
urban and rural communities gain pref-
erential access to Federal procurement 
opportunities. By ensuring that small 
businesses in disadvantaged commu-
nities participate in the Federal mar-
ketplace, it, in turn, boosts job cre-
ation and economic growth. 
One of the main incentives of the 
HUBZone program is the price evalua-
tion preference. This tool gives a slight 
competitive advantage to HUBZone 
firms competing against large compa-
nies. In doing so, it meets the objec-
tives of the program because every con-
tract awarded to a qualified HUBZone 
firm is an opportunity for developing 
and 
uplifting 
America’s 
most 
dis-
tressed communities. 
Unfortunately, this tool is not being 
used as often as it should be due to 
agencies misinterpreting that it does 
not apply to orders. There is nothing in 
the Small Business Act that excludes 
the price evaluation preference from 
being used at the ordering level, and it 
is our intention that it be used at that 
level. 
Given the prevalence of government- 
wide and agency-wide vehicles, it is 
now necessary to state in clear and un-
equivocal terms that the price evalua-
tion preference does apply to orders. 
This is precisely the goal of H.R. 5879. 
With this clarification, this legislation 
incentivizes the use of this important 
tool so that one day we can finally 
meet the 3 percent HUBZone con-
tracting goal and, ultimately, bring 
economic development to those com-
munities that need it the most. 
I thank Representatives NEWMAN and 
SALAZAR for leading this effort, which 
will bolster the HUBZone program. 
Madam Speaker, I urge Members to 
support this legislation, and I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. LUETKEMEYER. Madam Speak-
er, I ask unanimous consent that the 
gentleman from Texas (Mr. WILLIAMS) 
be allowed to manage the remainder of 
the time for the minority. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Missouri? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. WILLIAMS of Texas. Madam 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume, and I rise in support of 
H.R. 5879, the HUBZone Price Evalua-
tion Preference Clarification Act of 
2021. 
The SBA’s contracting programs de-
liver for this Nation’s smallest busi-
nesses and the country’s smallest con-
tractors. Unfortunately, consolidation 
with all of the Federal Government’s 
contracting programs continues to be 
problematic. Our committee has exam-
ined many of these programs and has 
offered solutions that would deliver 
change. 
H.R. 5879 takes important steps with-
in the HUBZone program and ensures 
that the 10 percent price preference is 
available on all task orders within 
large multiple award contracts. 
I thank the gentlewoman from Illi-
nois (Ms. NEWMAN) and the gentle-
woman from Florida (Ms. SALAZAR),

June 7, 2022 
the 
ranking 
member 
of 
the 
Sub-
committee on Contracting and Infra-
structure, for working in a collabo-
rative manner to address the HUBZone 
program. Bills like this have the abil-
ity to make a difference within Federal 
contracting, and I commend the Chair 
for bringing this bill forward. 
I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 
5879, and I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Ms. VELA´ ZQUEZ. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman 
from Illinois (Ms. NEWMAN). 
Ms. NEWMAN. Madam Speaker, I 
thank Chairwoman VELA´ ZQUEZ for all 
her great work on the Small Business 
Committee. 
I rise in strong support of my bipar-
tisan bill, the HUBZone Price Evalua-
tion Preference Clarification Act. This 
legislation is designed to expand con-
tracting opportunities to millions of 
small businesses located in historically 
underutilized business zones. 
More specifically, it would clarify 
the program’s price evaluation lan-
guage to ensure adequate spending to-
ward HUBZone small businesses, giving 
more communities the resources they 
need to build vibrantly. We must en-
sure that small business in every com-
munity is and can benefit from Federal 
contracting. 
By passing this legislation, we will 
take a crucial step toward a more equi-
table distribution of resources to small 
businesses throughout our country. I 
urge my colleagues to vote in favor of 
this legislation. 
Mr. WILLIAMS of Texas. Madam 
Speaker, I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Ms. VELA´ ZQUEZ. Madam Speaker, I 
have no further speakers, and I am pre-
pared to close. I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. WILLIAMS of Texas. Madam 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
Federal contracting remains a sig-
nificant endeavor for many of the Na-
tion’s small businesses. H.R. 5879 en-
sures one of these programs, the 
HUBZone program, is ready to assist 
small business contractors. This legis-
lation, which passed favorably out of 
committee by a voice vote, will level 
the playing field within the program. 
I thank the Chair for bringing this 
legislation through regular order, and I 
thank the sponsor and cosponsor for 
working to address these issues. I urge 
my colleagues to support the bill, and 
I yield back the balance of my time. 
Ms. VELA´ ZQUEZ. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
The statutory goal of awarding 3 per-
cent of all prime Federal contracts to 
HUBZone firms has never been met. 
H.R. 5879 will enable agencies to better 
meet this goal by eliminating all ambi-
guity and clarifying that the HUBZone 
price evaluation preference applies to 
orders. 
I commend the gentlewoman from Il-
linois (Ms. NEWMAN), the sponsor of the 
bill, and the gentlewoman from Florida 
(Ms. 
SALAZAR), 
the 
cosponsor, 
for 
working together on this sensible piece 
of legislation. H.R. 5879 will undoubt-
edly strengthen the HUBZone program 
which, in turn, will create jobs and 
stimulate local economies across the 
Nation. 
I urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘yes,’’ 
and I yield back the balance of my 
time. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, I rise 
to speak in support of H.R. 5879 ‘‘Hubzone 
Price Evaluation Preference Clarification Act’’. 
The Small Business Act is instrumental in 
allowing small businesses to remain competi-
tive amid complex markets. 
Small businesses are the engine of our 
economy and exist as the backbone of local 
communities across the nation. They are es-
sential contributors to our society, as we must 
support their growth and progress. 
The Hubzone program supports small busi-
nesses that are part of historically underuti-
lized business zones. These zones are low-in-
come communities that have increased levels 
of poverty and high unemployment rates. 
The program works to target inequities that 
make it at times difficult for small businesses 
within these economically distressed commu-
nities to compete. 
Within the Small Business Act, preferential 
price evaluations are given to small busi-
nesses participating in the Hubzone program. 
Price evaluation preferences ensure that a 
price offered by a qualified Hubzone small 
business entity is deemed lower than the price 
offered by another offeror if the qualified 
Hubzone business’s price is not more than 10 
percent higher than the price offered by the 
otherwise lowest offeror. 
These price evaluation preferences are a 
key feature which allow Hubzone contracts to 
act as an economic boost for small busi-
nesses within high unemployment and low-in-
come areas. 
These price evaluation preferences help 
level the playing field for small businesses that 
are often minority-owned. In Houston alone, 
nearly 35 percent of small businesses are mi-
nority-owned. 
The Hubzone program gives these busi-
nesses a chance to compete in competitive 
markets. In the wake of the COVID–19 pan-
demic, these small businesses need institu-
tional support more than ever. 
H.R. 5879 is necessary to clarify how small 
businesses can be eligible for price evaluation 
preferences outlined in the Small Business 
Act. 
The number of Hubzone locations, or areas 
with historically underutilized business zones, 
has nearly doubled in the past 20 years ac-
cording to the Small Business Administration. 
Small businesses and the communities they 
benefit depend on the success of the Hubzone 
program. It is vital to detail how small busi-
nesses can receive benefits from the program. 
I ask my colleagues to join me in voting for 
passage of H.R. 5879. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentlewoman from New York (Ms. 
VELA´ ZQUEZ) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 5879. 
The question was taken.

H5254 
June 7, 2022 
There was no objection. 
Ms. VELA´ ZQUEZ. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today in sup-
port of H.R. 7622, the Small Business 
Workforce Pipeline Act of 2022, intro-
duced by Mr. CROW and cosponsored by 
Mr. FITZGERALD. 
H.R. 7622 allows small business devel-
opment centers to disseminate infor-
mation from the Department of Labor 
regarding job training programs like 
apprenticeships 
and 
pre-apprentice-
ships, as well as other work-based 
learning opportunities. 
Throughout the past year, small 
businesses have been hit hard by tight-
ening labor markets, often struggling 
to compete with their larger counter-
parts. As the recovery continues, un-
employment drops, and job openings 
grow to record heights, the smaller 
firms in our economy have found it 
harder than ever to recruit and retain 
qualified workers. 
One of the most effective workforce 
training methods used in the U.S. 
today is the registered apprenticeship 
program, an earn-while-you-learn sys-
tem that combines classroom instruc-
tion with on-the-job training. Accord-
ing to the Department of Labor, the 
average starting salary for a graduate 
of an apprenticeship program is $72,000, 
and businesses retain these employees 
at a rate of 92 percent. 
Not only do apprenticeships provide a 
reliable pathway into the middle class 
for workers, but they also provide top- 
quality talent to the business that 
trained them. 
With assistance provided by the 
SBDC network, more small firms will 
have access to resources to attract and 
retain 
high-quality 
talent, 
helping 
them both establish and improve these 
programs for their businesses while 
providing training opportunities and 
job security to workers. 
I thank Mr. CROW for leading on this 
issue with a variety of hearings on the 
topic and for listening to witnesses as 
he worked to craft this legislation with 
Mr. FITZGERALD, Ms. HOULAHAN, and 
Mr. GARBARINO. These bipartisan ef-
forts will have a lasting impact on our 
Main Street firms. 
I urge Members to support this bill, 
and I reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. WILLIAMS of Texas. Madam 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in support of 
H.R. 7622, the Small Business Work-
force Pipeline Act of 2022. 
Small businesses across the country 
are facing labor shortages and skills 
gaps as our Nation remains 820,000 jobs 
short compared to prior to the pan-
demic. 
Just last week, the NFIB reported 
that over half of small businesses have 
unfilled job openings. This is more 
than double the almost 50-year histor-
ical average of 23 percent. Further, of 
those owners hiring or trying to hire, 
92 percent of owners reported few or no 
qualified applicants for the positions 
they were trying to fill. 
The Small Business Administration 
offers multiple resources to small busi-
nesses to help them face the current 
economic headwinds and labor chal-
lenges. One of these resources is the 
small business development centers, 
which have served to be a valuable tool 
for entrepreneurs and offer free train-
ing, counseling, and support for small 
businesses. 
This legislation will further improve 
SBDCs by expanding their ability to 
assist small businesses in establishing 
and improving work-based learning op-
portunities and apprenticeship pro-
grams. 
To be clear, this legislation supports 
all work-based learning opportunities. 
I thank Congressman CROW as well as 
Congressman 
FITZGERALD, 
Congress-
woman HOULAHAN, and Congressman 
GARBARINO for working in a bipartisan 
manner to ensure this bill reached the 
House floor. I also thank the chair for 
advancing this bill. 
Madam Speaker, I encourage all of 
my colleagues to support H.R. 7622, 
which was unanimously reported out of 
our committee. I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Ms. VELA´ ZQUEZ. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from 
Colorado (Mr. CROW). 
Mr. CROW. Madam Speaker, I rise in 
support of H.R. 7622, the Small Busi-
ness Workforce Pipeline Act of 2022. 
As we help small businesses navigate 
the labor shortage, it is more impor-
tant than ever that we support small 
businesses as they work to find quality 
workers and fill positions. 
I am a huge proponent of work-based 
learning opportunities like apprentice-
ships that help small businesses fill job 
openings and help their workers get 
the skills they need so they can sup-
port their families. Work-based learn-
ing opportunities are a great way to at-
tract quality candidates who may not 
be able to attend traditional education 
models. 
The Small Business Workforce Pipe-
line Act of 2022 aims to empower small 
business development centers, like the 
Aurora-South Metro SBDC in my dis-
trict, to help small businesses establish 
and improve their apprenticeship, pre- 
apprenticeship, and job training pro-
grams. 
This bill would help workers gain the 
skills they need for in-demand jobs and 
help small businesses grow their busi-
ness. 
I thank Chairwoman VELA´ ZQUEZ and 
Ranking Member LUETKEMEYER
for 
bringing this bill to the floor and Rep-
resentatives FITZGERALD, HOULAHAN, 
and GARBARINO for their partnership on 
this bill. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to join me in supporting H.R. 
7622. 
Mr. WILLIAMS of Texas. Madam 
Speaker, I yield such time as he may 
consume to my colleague from Wis-
consin (Mr. FITZGERALD), a tireless ad-
vocate for small business in Wisconsin 
and around the country. 
Mr. FITZGERALD. Madam Speaker, 
I thank my colleague from Texas (Mr. 
WILLIAMS) for yielding me time. I 
thank my colleagues, specifically Mr. 
CROW, for co-leading H.R. 7622, the 
Small Business Workforce Pipeline Act 
of 2022. 
The bill would allow small business 
development centers to provide infor-
mation and assistance to small busi-
nesses on how to establish and improve 
work-based learning opportunities. It 
also would enhance apprenticeship pro-
grams, 
pre-apprenticeship 
programs, 
and other job training programs that 
many of us are very familiar with. 
I hear all the time from Wisconsin 
small businesses back in my district 
about how the country’s labor shortage 
is affecting not only the recruitment of 
skilled employees but, in particular, 
manufacturing and, in my district, 
light manufacturing. 
The latest National Federation for 
Independent 
Businesses’ 
economic 
trends report showed that while opti-
mism in recovering to prepandemic 
employment levels is increasing, we 
still are very much behind the eight 
ball. Sixty percent of manufacturing 
firms report unfilled job openings. 
Apprenticeships and other job train-
ing programs provide a solution to ad-
dress the needs of the manufacturing 
sector. Apprenticeships are among the 
most successful forms of workforce de-
velopment, and through paid and on- 
the-job training programs, alongside 
classroom education, we can make sig-
nificant strides. 
This bill would directly benefit man-
ufacturers and other businesses in Wis-
consin’s Fifth District by having ap-
prenticeships and other job-training 
materials readily available to them. 
Madam Speaker, I support the pas-
sage of this bill. 
Ms. VELA´ ZQUEZ. Madam Speaker, I 
reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. WILLIAMS of Texas. Madam 
Speaker, the SBDC program has deliv-
ered for small businesses for many 
years. The Small Business Workforce 
Pipeline Act of 2022 will help combat 
labor shortages by supporting appren-
ticeships and learning opportunities 
through SBDCs. This bill will help 
small businesses grow and equip Amer-
ican workers with new skills. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to support H.R. 7622, and I yield 
back the balance of my time. 
Ms. VELA´ ZQUEZ. Madam Speaker, 
there is no question that small firms 
are facing the most dire consequences 
of a tight labor market. At a time 
when the economy is recovering and 
businesses are seeking to expand their 
operations, lack of access to a highly 
skilled workforce can be frustrating to 
business owners and harmful to their 
recovery. 
Maintaining economic competitive-
ness on the world stage means invest-
ing in our workforce, and nobody is 
better equipped to do that than the

H.R. 7622 empowers SBDCs to expand 
workforce training resources to small 
employers struggling to find workers, 
which will, in turn, grow the skill sets 
of workers and the workforces of busi-
nesses. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to vote ‘‘yes,’’ and I yield back 
the balance of my time. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, I rise 
in support of H.R. 7622, ‘‘The Small Business 
Workforce Pipeline Act of 2022.’’ 
This bill’s purpose is to amend the Small 
Business Act requirements relating to appren-
ticeship program assistance for small business 
development centers, and other purposes. 
The COVID–19 pandemic has resulted in a 
labor shortage, that affected businesses in un-
imaginable ways, especially small businesses. 
Alarmingly, 23 percent of small businesses 
closed due to the pandemic and 20 percent of 
small businesses that were in their first year of 
operation also failed. 
This is why now, more than ever, small 
businesses need our support by updating the 
laws that support them and to encourage ap-
prenticeships. 
I support this bill’s effort to establish a clear 
and concise plan of action for programing and 
other resources from which small businesses 
and their employees can benefit. 
I am in favor of this legislation because ap-
prenticeships are tangible opportunities for 
successful workplace development. They en-
able young workers to gain on-the job training 
with educational resources that deliver prac-
tical experience and skills, equipping them for 
future career opportunities. 
This ‘‘learn as you work’’ style gives access 
to people who may not be able to purse tradi-
tional educational routes. 
Historically, 
apprenticeships 
focused 
on 
skills for a narrow range of industries that 
could also benefit from the academic credit 
and mentorship opportunities. For employers 
finding a hard time hiring qualified employees, 
apprenticeships are a direct investment that 
small businesses realize will successfully im-
pact them. 
Madam Speaker, this bill will provide much 
needed assistance to businesses and enable 
them to continue their good work of providing 
training skills that will allow opportunities for 
employees to succeed in the workplace. This 
legislation will prepare workers for the 21st 
century workforce, while helping businesses 
find the skilled employees they need to com-
pete. 
I urge all of my colleagues to join me in 
supporting passage of H.R. 7622.

GENERAL LEAVE 
Ms. VELA´ ZQUEZ. Madam Speaker, I 
ask unanimous consent that all Mem-
bers may have 5 legislative days in 
which to revise and extend their re-
marks and include extraneous material 
on the measure under consideration. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from New York? 
There was no objection. 
Ms. VELA´ ZQUEZ. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today in sup-
port of H.R. 7664, the Supporting Small 
Business and Career and Technical 
Education Act of 2022, introduced by 
my colleague from Texas (Mr. WIL-
LIAMS) and my colleague from Illinois 
(Ms. NEWMAN). 
After seeing massive layoffs in re-
sponse to the pandemic, businesses are 
starting to expand their operations and 
grow their workforce. Unfortunately, 
this has created one of the tightest 
labor markets in U.S. history, and 
small firms are feeling this acutely. 
Oftentimes, small businesses are not 
only faced with a shortage of appli-
cants, but within that pool, they are 
seeing a shortage of applicants with 
the skill sets they need. 
One of the best strategies for equip-
ping students with skills needed to 
enter a market is career and technical 
education, or CTE. Aimed at secondary 
and postsecondary students, these pro-
grams don’t replace academic training 
but, rather, expand upon it to give 
young people practical skills they can 
use, whether they enter the workforce 
or continue in their studies. 
CTE programs can train students 
with a wide variety of skills in nearly 
every industry, and this program often 
works with local businesses to under-
stand what skills are in demand to 
guide the curriculum. 
This legislation directs small busi-
ness development centers and women’s 
business centers to assist small busi-
nesses in hiring graduates of CTE pro-
grams while also helping program grad-
uates start their own businesses. 
It takes a twofold approach of, one, 
creating a more adequate pipeline of 
trained young people for small busi-
nesses and, two, supporting those stu-
dents who want to launch their own en-
terprise. 
SBDCs and WBCs can help fill the 
gap between training programs and 
small firms by building awareness and 
fostering relationships between the pri-
vate sector and our educational com-
munity. 
Madam Speaker, I thank Mr. WIL-
LIAMS and Ms. NEWMAN for their mean-
ingful work on this bill. I urge Mem-
bers to support this bipartisan piece of 
legislation, and I reserve the balance of 
my time.

Education Act. This important piece of 
legislation will encourage younger gen-
erations to pursue CTE careers, know-
ing they will have support on the back 
end to help find a job. 
Costly 4-year degrees create burden-
some financial obligations and saddle 
students with decades of debt. It is im-
portant individuals have alternatives, 
such as CTE programs, when wanting 
to find meaningful careers at a fraction 
of the cost. 
Skilled labor has become a high-de-
mand market, and our country is in 
need of more plumbers, electricians, 
welders, and other skilled professionals 
who are the lifeblood of our economy. 
This growing skills gap is hurting 
small businesses across the country. 
My bill will fill that void and connect 
graduates to high-demand occupations 
and opportunities that earn good wages 
and will help them provide for their 
family. Additionally, this bill provides 
valuable assistance so CTE graduates 
can translate their skills over to start-
ing their own small business and help 
build long-term careers and employ 
more people. 
I have been a small business owner 
for over 50 years, and I can tell you 
that leading sales meetings, signing 
the fronts of checks, and giving other 
people the opportunity to make a liv-
ing is one of the most rewarding 
things, if not the most rewarding, I 
have ever done. 
The American Dream is built on in-
novation and entrepreneurship, and 
this only continues when the next gen-
eration is willing to better themselves, 
be empowered to take risks, and under-
stand that risk-reward is the dream. 
It is our responsibility to unlock the 
potential of our next generation so we 
can keep America the greatest nation 
in the world and keep it strong. 
I thank Chairwoman VELA´ ZQUEZ and 
Ranking Member LUETKEMEYER
for 
helping to get this bill to the floor. I 
urge all my colleagues to vote in sup-
port of H.R. 7664. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Ms. VELA´ ZQUEZ. Madam Speaker, I 
have no further speakers, and I am pre-
pared to close. I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. WILLIAMS of Texas. Madam 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume to close. 
Madam Speaker, small businesses 
and the American worker are the back-
bone of our economy. By empowering 
the SBA’s resource partners, including 
small business development centers 
and women’s business centers, to en-
gage with the career and technical edu-
cation community, we will replenish 
our skilled workforce and grow our 
economy. 
Madam Speaker, I encourage my col-
leagues to support H.R. 7664, and I yield 
back the balance of my time. 
Ms. VELA´ ZQUEZ. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself the balance of my time to 
close. 
Madam Speaker, while our economy 
continues to recover and job openings 
increase, it is important that we en-
sure there is an adequate pipeline of 
skilled workers in our small firms. 
Fueling our economic recovery relies 
on them having the resources they 
need to thrive, including an adequate 
workforce. H.R. 7664 will go a long way 
in connecting small employers in need 
of workers to these programs and con-
nect 
students 
to 
opportunities 
of 
launching their own firms. 
I thank the gentleman from Texas 
(Mr. WILLIAMS) and the gentlewoman 
from Illinois (Ms. NEWMAN) for their 
hard work on this bill. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to vote ‘‘yes,’’ and I yield back 
the balance of my time. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, I rise 
in support of H.R. 7664, the ‘‘Supporting Small 
Business and Career and Technical Education 
Act of 2022.’’ 
This bill would amend the Small Business 
Act to include requirements relating to grad-
uates of career and technical education pro-
grams, and programs of study for small busi-
ness development centers and women’s busi-
ness centers. 
H.R. 7664 would assist small businesses in 
hiring graduates from career and technical 
education programs, and would assist grad-
uates of these programs in starting up a small 
business. 
Small businesses are the engine of our 
economy, creating two-thirds of the new jobs 
over the last 15 years, accounting for 44 per-
cent of U.S. economic activity. 
According to the U.S. Small Business Asso-
ciation (SBA), small businesses of 500 em-
ployees or fewer make up 99.9 percent of all 
U.S. businesses and 99.7 percent of firms with 
paid employees. 
Not only do small businesses provide mil-
lions of jobs, they also advance careers and 
opportunities. 
Successful small businesses put money 
back into their local community through pay-
checks and taxes, which can support the cre-
ation of new small businesses and improve 
local public services. 
Small business is the portal through which 
many people enter the economic mainstream. 
Business ownership allows individuals, in-
cluding women and minorities, to achieve fi-
nancial success, as well as bolster pride in 
their accomplishments. 
While most small businesses are still owned 
by white males, the past two decades have 
seen a substantial increase in the number of 
businesses owned by women and minorities. 
The more we create opportunities for career 
growth and development from a wide array of 
diverse backgrounds, the more opportunities 
we create for ourselves and our economy. 
A critical workforce challenge currently in 
the United States is the skills gap, particularly 
among jobs that require either a high school 
diploma, postsecondary certificate, or associ-
ate’s degree. 
Jobs requiring these ‘‘middle skills’’ out-
number the adults in the workforce who pos-
sess them, and this gap presents a barrier to 
American economic competitiveness. 
Due to global shifts in technology, automa-
tion and other sectors that had been occurring 
long before the pandemic, employers were 
raising alarms over a growing number of vital 
skills they noticed to be in short supply from 
incoming applicants. 
Graduates from career and technical edu-
cation (CTE) programs are perfectly suited to 
fill this gap. 
CTE programs help students see the rel-
evance of their studies for their future and mo-
tivates them to attend classes and study hard. 
In 2019–20 there were 11.1 million CTE 
participants; 7.6 million at the secondary level 
and 3.5 million at the postsecondary level. 
According to the Texas Education Agency’s 
2016–2017 Academic Excellence Indicator 
System State Profile Report, 1,523,779 sec-
ondary students in Texas (46.3 percent) were 
enrolled in Career and Technical Education 
programs. 
We must make sure our legislation reflects 
the importance and value of small business, 
CTE program graduates, and the role they will 
play in growing our economy. 
I urge all my colleagues to support H.R. 
7664, the Supporting Small Business and Ca-
reer and Technical Education Act of 2022.

woman from New York. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Ms. VELA´ ZQUEZ. Madam Speaker, I 
ask unanimous consent that all Mem-
bers may have 5 legislative days in 
which to revise and extend their re-
marks and include extraneous material 
on the measure under consideration. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from New York? 
There was no objection. 
Ms. VELA´ ZQUEZ. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today in sup-
port of H.R. 7670, the Women-Owned 
Small Business Program Transparency 
Act. 
The Women-Owned Small Business 
program levels the playing field for fe-
male entrepreneurs who compete for 
Federal contracts. Additionally, it as-
sists agencies in meeting the goal of 
awarding 5 percent of all contracts to 
women-owned small businesses. 
While the program has steadily im-
proved, it has faced its fair share of 
delays and challenges. For example, 
the program started operating 10 years 
after its enactment, and since its im-
plementation 12 years ago, the 5 per-
cent goal has only been met twice. 
The Small Business Administration 
implemented a formal certification 
process for the program in 2020, more 
than 5 years after being required to do 
so by Congress. As a result, while the 
agency is making great strides, it still 
has a substantial backlog of applica-
tions and the implementation of cor-
responding 
regulations—especially 
when it comes to program examina-
tions—remains to be seen. 
The importance of the program to 
elevating women-owned small busi-
nesses in the Federal procurement 
arena makes it imperative to conduct 
oversight to ensure the program is 
meeting its legislative intent. H.R. 7670 
will aid Congress in this endeavor by 
establishing reporting requirements to 
better assess the effectiveness of the 
program. 
In particular, H.R. 7670 requires the 
SBA to report on multiple facets of the 
Women-Owned 
Small 
Business 
pro-
gram, including the amount of con-
tracting dollars awarded through the 
program, the number of certifications 
issued, the amount of program exami-
nations conducted, and much more. 
I thank the gentlewoman from Penn-
sylvania (Ms. HOULAHAN) and the gen-
tlewoman from New York (Ms. TENNEY) 
for their bipartisan work on this bill. 
H.R. 7670 is a commonsense piece of 
legislation 
that 
will 
bring 
trans-
parency and accountability to the 
Women-Owned 
Small 
Business 
pro-
gram. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to support this bipartisan bill, 
and I reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. WILLIAMS of Texas. Madam 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
I rise in support of H.R. 7670, the 
Women-Owned Small Business Pro-
gram Transparency Act. 
Federal 
programs, 
and 
especially 
Federal contracting programs, require 
comprehensive and complete reporting 
requirements from executive branch 
agencies. 
This 
information 
ensures 
that not only the programs are meet-
ing congressional intent but also to en-
sure that safeguards and oversight ca-
pabilities are intact. 
H.R. 7670 bolsters the Women-Owned 
Small Business program by enhancing 
the program’s reporting requirements. 
Having more information on how many 
women-owned small businesses are cer-
tified and the amount of fees charged 
by third-party certifiers will only 
strengthen the program. 
I thank the gentlewoman from Penn-
sylvania (Ms. HOULAHAN) and the gen-
tlewoman from New York (Ms. TENNEY) 
for working in a bipartisan manner to 
address the Women-Owned Small Busi-
ness program. I also again would like 
to thank the chair for advancing this 
bill. 
H.R. 7670 is a good government bill 
that will provide more information 
about one of the SBA’s Federal con-
tracting programs. 
I reserve the balance of my time. 
Ms. VELA´ ZQUEZ. Madam Speaker, I 
yield such time as she may consume to 
the gentlewoman from Pennsylvania 
(Ms. HOULAHAN). 
Ms. HOULAHAN. Madam Speaker, I 
proudly rise today to urge my col-
leagues to vote for my straightforward, 
bipartisan bill that supports our Na-
tion’s female entrepreneurs. It is called 
the Women-Owned Small Business Pro-
gram Transparency Act. 
As an engineer myself, and an entre-
preneur and operator, I know very 
much firsthand that data can help us 
to address and understand some of our 
most pressing issues in business. Here 
is what the data says: Year after year, 
women-owned small businesses con-
tinue to be underrepresented when it 
comes to Federal contract funding. In 
other words, the playing field isn’t 
nearly level. 
The good news is that there is al-
ready an initiative that is designed to 
address this. It is called the Women- 
Owned Small Business Federal Con-
tracting Program. This program is pop-
ular and necessary to bridge the dis-
parity in Federal contracts, but it 
needs some additional improvements. 
My bill will do just that by increas-
ing transparency, oversight, and ac-
countability. Through this program, 
the SBA aids other Federal agencies in 
meeting the statutory goal of awarding 
5 percent of Federal contracts to 
women-owned businesses, a goal which 
the chairwoman mentioned has only 
been met twice in history. 
The program has experienced chal-
lenges, including a significant backlog 
of applications and poor visibility of 
the approval numbers by national cer-
tifying entities. Our bipartisan bill will 
address these concerns by requiring the 
SBA to share six critical pieces of in-
formation: 
One, the amount of contracting dol-
lars that are awarded. 
Two, the number of certifications 
that are issued. 
Three, the amount of program exami-
nations that are conducted. 
Four, the number of companies that 
are decertified. 
Five, the number of contracts that 
are incorrectly awarded. 
Simply put, this bill will allow Con-
gress and the SBA to work together to 
help women secure government con-
tracts, especially those in underrep-
resented industries, which include the 
signature crop of our region, the mush-
room industry, and also include under-
represented industries such as the 
dairy product manufacturing industry, 
which is represented by ByHeart, the 
only baby formula manufacturer that

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5258 
June 7, 2022 
has been started in the last 15 years, 
that also happens to be in my district. 
The time is now for us to act, both as 
our female businessowners continue to 
recover from the pandemic and as addi-
tional contracts are issued through the 
historic implementation of the bipar-
tisan Infrastructure Investment and 
Jobs Act. 
Madam Speaker, I thank my col-
league and fellow entrepreneur from 
across the aisle, the gentlewoman from 
New York (Ms. TENNEY) for her part-
nership on this bill that will help level 
the playing field for all female entre-
preneurs across our country. 
I also thank and extend my thanks to 
Chair VELA´ ZQUEZ and Ranking Member 
LUETKEMEYER. 
Mr. WILLIAMS of Texas. Madam 
Speaker, I yield such time as she may 
consume to the gentlewoman from New 
York (Ms. TENNEY), the ranking mem-
ber of the Subcommittee on Under-
served, Agriculture, and Rural Busi-
ness Development. 
Ms. TENNEY. Madam Speaker, I am 
honored to partner with the gentle-
woman 
from 
Pennsylvania 
(Ms. 
HOULAHAN) to introduce the bipartisan 
Women-Owned Small Business Pro-
gram Transparency Act. In 2014 and 
2019, the Government Accountability 
Office found that the Women-Owned 
Small Business program has several 
oversight deficiencies and needs to re-
lease 
more 
in-depth 
performance 
metrics to ensure it addresses the 
needs of women-owned small businesses 
and the taxpayer. 
This 
legislation 
today 
addresses 
these concerns, requiring the Small 
Business Administration to annually 
disclose the total number of businesses 
that are certified as women-owned by 
the SBA, the number certified by third- 
party certifiers, and fees charged by 
third-party 
certifiers, 
the 
dollar 
amount and percent of contracts to 
women-owned small businesses, and 
the information on contracts incor-
rectly awarded. 
For over two decades, the Women- 
Owned Small Business program has set 
aside at least 5 percent Federal con-
tracting dollars for certified women- 
owned small businesses. This plays a 
small, but important, part of ensuring 
that the Federal Government does not 
leave our Nation’s small businesses be-
hind and that we continue to have a ro-
bust and competitive contractor eco-
system to pull from. 
In New York’s 22nd Congressional 
District, small businesses make up 94 
percent of all employers, and I have 
witnessed firsthand the tremendous 
impact of women-owned small busi-
nesses. In fact, my own family business 
is a women-owned business. Whether it 
is Curcio Printing in the Southern Tier 
or AeroMed Technologies in Utica, our 
communities and, yes, our taxpayers 
benefit when women-owned businesses 
thrive. 
With these additional metrics avail-
able to policymakers, it will pave the 
way for future improvements to the 
Women-Owned 
Small 
Business 
pro-
gram. Only through full transparency 
can we ensure that this program works 
effectively and efficiently for small 
businesses and for taxpayers. 
I thank, again, my partner and col-
league, the gentlewoman from Pennsyl-
vania (Ms. HOULAHAN), for cosponsoring 
this great piece of bipartisan legisla-
tion, and I urge my colleagues to join 
us in supporting this. 
b 1645 
Ms. VELA´ ZQUEZ. Madam Speaker, I 
reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. WILLIAMS of Texas. Madam 
Speaker, I am prepared to close, and I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, as I mentioned ear-
lier, it is important for Congress to 
study all of the Small Business Admin-
istration’s Federal contracting pro-
grams regularly. 
H.R. 7670, the Women-Owned Small 
Business Program Transparency Act, 
will enhance our research and assist us 
as we examine this program. The more 
information that we have at our finger-
tips, simply the better. 
Madam Speaker, I urge all my col-
leagues to support this bill, and I yield 
back the balance of my time. 
Ms. VELA´ ZQUEZ. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, long after the en-
actment of the legislation to create the 
Women-Owned Small Business Pro-
gram, women still face inequities when 
it comes to Federal contracting. The 
Women-Owned Small Business Pro-
gram tries to address these inequities. 
Today, we have the opportunity to 
further this mission through H.R. 7670. 
This bill creates a reporting require-
ment through which to measure wheth-
er the program is working as intended. 
I am certain that this oversight mecha-
nism will lead to increased trans-
parency, accountability, and efficiency 
to the benefit of our women-owned 
small business community. That is 
why I thank our committee members 
for their leadership in advancing this 
piece of legislation. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to vote ‘‘yes,’’ and I yield back 
the balance of my time. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, I rise 
in strong support of H.R. 7670, the ‘‘Women- 
Owned Small Business Program Transparency 
Act.’’ 
H.R. 7670 is a bipartisan effort to amend 
the Small Business Act to require the Adminis-
trator of the Small Business Administration 
(SBA) to submit to Congress a report on small 
businesses owned and controlled by women 
including: 
Information as to the amount of contracting 
dollars awarded through the program, 
The number of certifications being issued, 
The amount of program examinations being 
conducted, 
The number of companies being decertified, 
and 
The number of contracts incorrectly award-
ed to industries within the North American In-
dustry Classification System or NAICS codes 
ineligible for the program, as well as any ac-
tions taken by SBA to properly train agency 
personnel. 
The SBA’s report to the Committee on 
Small Business of the House of Representa-
tives and the Committee on Small Business 
and Entrepreneurship of the Senate will equip 
Congress with transparency into the effective-
ness of the program that will enable future im-
provements to the program. 
Established in 2000, the Women-Owned 
Small Business (WOSB) program leveled the 
playing field by providing an opportunity for 
women-owned small businesses to attain fed-
eral contracts in industries where the SBA had 
determined that women entrepreneurs were 
underrepresented. 
Unfortunately, due to administrative neglect 
in the application review and the application 
backlog 
from 
eligible 
businesses, 
many 
women were shut out from attaining contracts. 
Following the U.S. Government Account-
ability Office’s investigation into this matter, 
they concluded that ‘‘By not improving its 
oversight of the WOSB program, SBA is lim-
iting its ability to ensure third-party certifiers 
are following program requirements’’, meaning 
that several contracts that WOSBs had ap-
plied for were inaccessible to women. 
When enacted, H.R. 7670 will reform the 
oversight of the WOSB program to ensure that 
transparency and accountability are high prior-
ities during the contract distribution process. 
I applaud the efforts of my colleagues Rep. 
CHRISSY HOULAHAN and Rep. CLAUDIA TENNEY 
for 
elevating 
the 
voices 
of 
all 
female 
entreprenuers across America, including over 
125,000 female small business owners from 
Houston. 
There has been a long history of women- 
owned small businesses being excluded from 
consideration for federal contracts and partici-
pation in subcontracting. The progress that 
women-owned small businesses had made 
was curtailed by the COVID–19 pandemic, 
and that lost ground must be reversed so that 
women-owned businesses are able to remain 
competitive. 
Now more than ever, it is critical for Con-
gress to stand with America’s small business 
owners to whom we owe a great deal for our 
economic prosperity. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
join me in supporting H.R. 7670. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentlewoman from New York (Ms. 
VELA´ ZQUEZ) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 7670. 
The question was taken. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the 
opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being 
in the affirmative, the ayes have it.

bill (H.R. 7694) to amend the Small 
Business Act to modify the require-
ments relating to the evaluation of the 
subcontracting 
plans 
of 
certain 
offerors, and for other purposes. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 7694 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Strength-
ening Subcontracting for Small Businesses 
Act of 2022’’. 
SEC. 
2. 
EVALUATION 
OF 
SUBCONTRACTING 
PLANS. 
Section 8(d)(4)(G) of the Small Business 
Act (15 U.S.C. 637(d)(4)(G)) is amended— 
(1) in the matter preceding clause (i), by 
striking ‘‘bundled contract’’ and all that fol-
lows through ‘‘for subcontracting’’ and in-
serting ‘‘contract that includes a subcon-
tracting plan required under this para-
graph’’; and 
(2) in clause (i), by striking ‘‘the rate pro-
vided under the subcontracting plan for 
small business participation’’ and inserting 
‘‘the description in the subcontracting plan 
of the extent to which the offeror proposes to 
use small business concerns as subcontrac-
tors (at any tier)’’. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentlewoman from 
New York (Ms. VELA´ ZQUEZ) and the 
gentleman from Texas (Mr. WILLIAMS) 
each will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from New York. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Ms. VELA´ ZQUEZ. Madam Speaker, I 
ask unanimous consent that all Mem-
bers may have 5 legislative days in 
which to revise and extend their re-
marks and include extraneous material 
on the measure under consideration. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from New York? 
There was no objection. 
Ms. VELA´ ZQUEZ. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today in sup-
port of H.R. 7694, the Strengthening 
Subcontracting for Small Businesses 
Act of 2022. Subcontracting plans are 
an important mechanism for small 
business utilization. In fact, for many 
small businesses, subcontracting plans 
represent the only way to participate 
in Federal contracts. That is why the 
Small Business Act requires contrac-
tors to have subcontracting plans in 
certain situations. 
For example, subcontracting plans 
are required for contracts that exceed 
certain 
thresholds, 
have 
subcon-
tracting possibilities, and are awarded 
using 
negotiated 
procedures. 
While 
having these plans in place is an impor-
tant first step, it will not make a dif-
ference if the prime does not imple-
ment them. 
The Small Business Act has a provi-
sion that allows agencies to subject 
prime contractors to liquidated dam-
ages if they do not employ good faith 
efforts to meet the subcontracting 
plans. However, the standard is ambig-
uous and not always enforced. As a re-
sult, primes often face no consequences 
for failing to meet their subcontracting 
plans. That is simply unacceptable. 
We must do more to ensure prime 
contractors comply with their subcon-
tracting plans. This is precisely what 
H.R. 7694 does. It requires agencies to 
evaluate past performance in meeting 
subcontracting plans when considering 
offers for new contract awards. In 
other words, by making sure that pre-
vious compliance with these plans is 
taken into consideration when making 
new awards, it would encourage more 
compliance with subcontracting plans. 
I thank Representative STAUBER and 
Representative MFUME for leading this 
effort, which represents an innovative 
solution to a longstanding problem. 
Madam Speaker, I urge Members to 
support this legislation, and I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. WILLIAMS of Texas. Madam 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in support of 
H.R. 7694. All contractors know the im-
portance of subcontractors. Their work 
responsibilities are crucial to com-
pleting jobs on time and on budget. 
H.R. 7694 translates the importance of 
subcontracting to Federal contracting 
and especially those who participate 
within the SBA’s contracting pro-
grams. Simply put, past performance 
should be acknowledged on all future 
dealings. 
Madam Speaker, I thank the gen-
tleman from Minnesota (Mr. STAUBER), 
my friend, who is one of the biggest ad-
vocates for small businesses and sub-
contractors, and the gentleman from 
Maryland (Mr. MFUME) for working in a 
bipartisan manner to highlight this 
issue. 
I also again thank the chair for 
bringing this bill forward, and I urge 
my colleagues to support H.R. 7694. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Ms. VELA´ ZQUEZ. Madam Speaker, I 
continue to reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. WILLIAMS of Texas. Madam 
Speaker, I yield such time as he may 
consume to the gentleman from Min-
nesota (Mr. STAUBER), one of the big-
gest advocates for small businesses and 
subcontractors. 
Mr. STAUBER. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman for yielding. 
Madam Speaker, thanks to this ad-
ministration’s bad policies, small busi-
nesses 
are 
struggling 
with 
sky-
rocketing inflation, record-high gas 
prices, and supply chain and labor cri-
ses. It is imperative that Congress help 
our small businesses find success de-
spite this economic landscape. One way 
we can do this is by improving the Fed-
eral contract marketplace. 
A common theme we have heard in 
the contracting space is that prime 
contracting opportunities for small 
businesses are dwindling at an alarm-
ing rate. This means that subcon-
tracting opportunities are more impor-
tant than ever for our small businesses. 
While large prime contractors are 
statutorily required to have subcon-
tracting plans, there is little incentive 
for prime contractors to comply with 
their own goals. 
Further, there is no requirement that 
a contracting officer take into consid-
eration a contractor’s past perform-
ance in subcontracting with small busi-
nesses when deliberating new awards. 
While it is laudable that prime con-
tractors have subcontracting plans, 
these plans seem to have minimal in-
fluence on a contractor’s motivation to 
award work to small businesses. 
This bill, the Strengthening Subcon-
tracting for Small Businesses Act, ad-
dresses this problem in a few ways: 
First, the legislation will require the 
consideration of a contractor’s pro-
posed utilization of small businesses in 
its subcontracting plans. 
Second, the legislation will require 
the consideration of the contractor’s 
past performance in meeting its pre-
vious goals. 
In short, this bill creates a strong in-
centive for large prime contractors to 
comply with their own goals since it 
will now impact their ability to win 
new work. 
Madam Speaker, I thank my col-
league, Congressman MFUME, for his 
collaboration on this bill. Together, I 
believe we have created a meaningful 
piece of legislation that will make a 
real and significant impact on small 
businesses, and I look forward to con-
tinuing our relationship. 
Ms. VELA´ ZQUEZ. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from 
Maryland (Mr. MFUME). 
Mr. MFUME. Madam Speaker, I par-
ticularly thank the chair for yielding 
this time but also for her very impor-
tant leadership on the Committee on 
Small Business and for the excellence 
of her example—getting all of us to the 
point of where we are today. 
At a time when, as has been said, 
small businesses are at risk of being 
pushed out of the Federal procurement 
space due to forces outside of their con-
trol, it is imperative that we unite 
across the aisle, as has been stated, to 
stand up for small business concerns 
and to help grow their presence in the 
Federal contracting space where pos-
sible. 
I am very pleased to work with Rep-
resentative STAUBER, the distinguished 
gentleman from Minnesota, who, on 
committee and at this time, jointly 
share an interest in this legislation be-
cause of what it does. I look forward to 
working with Mr. STAUBER in the fu-
ture on other joint endeavors. 
I also thank the staff of the Com-
mittee on Small Business for working 
very hard to pull together this com-
monsense bill that protects small busi-
nesses by incentivizing large prime 
contractors to adhere to their con-
tracting plans. 
Now, some might say, well, why do 
you have to do that? Unfortunately, if 
we don’t do it, they will continue as

they have done, to not adhere to those 
plans, and it hurts the overall small 
business community. 
Currently, prime contractors have 
very little economic incentive to do 
the right things, to abide by their sub-
contracting plans, and these are the 
plans that they, themselves have nego-
tiated. So when prime contractors dis-
regard these pre-negotiated terms, the 
only recourse that we have is to make 
sure that we find a way to involve our-
selves before they are left with their 
only alternative, which is to file a law-
suit. 
Given the nature of the courts, any 
small business relief that may come to 
them could prove to be too little, too 
late. 
Madam Speaker, again, I thank the 
gentleman from Minnesota. This bill 
creates an economic incentive for 
prime contractors to follow their sub-
contracting plans by requiring any 
agency of the government to assess 
those plans and to offer advice and an 
opinion on whether or not they have 
complied. 
The SPEAKER PRO TEMPORE. The 
time of the gentleman has expired. 
Ms. VELA´ ZQUEZ. Madam Speaker, I 
yield an additional 30 seconds to the 
gentleman from Maryland. 
Mr. MFUME. Madam Speaker, by 
amending the language of the Small 
Business Act, by expanding its scope, 
this legislation will give contractors 
that treat small businesses the right 
and the fair way, a greater chance at 
winning Federal contractors. And it 
will hopefully incentivize those con-
tractors that are not, to finally do the 
right thing. 
Madam Speaker, I respectfully ask 
that my colleagues vote in support of 
H.R. 7694, the Strengthening Subcon-
tracting for Small Businesses Act of 
2022. 
Mr. WILLIAMS of Texas. Madam 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume to close. 
Madam Speaker, as contract consoli-
dation continues to build momentum, 
opportunities will continue to falter. 
Overall, this trendline is heading in the 
wrong direction. As a result, the em-
phasis and importance will be placed 
on subcontracting. 
H.R. 7694 takes an important step by 
requiring that past performance is 
taken into account on all future con-
tracts. Congress will need to continue 
to study this issue carefully, and H.R. 
7694 will assist us along the way. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to support this legislation, and 
I yield back the balance of my time. 
Ms. VELA´ ZQUEZ. Madam Speaker, I 
would just say thank you to both gen-
tlemen, Mr. STAUBER and Mr. MFUME, 
for their hard work, and I urge my col-
leagues to support this bill. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, I rise 
in strong support of H.R. 7694, the ‘‘Strength-
ening Subcontracting for Small Businesses Act 
of 2022.’’ 
This legislation would amend the Small 
Business Act to ensure that companies award-
ed government contracts utilize small busi-
nesses in their subcontracting plans. 
H.R. 7694 would ensure that small busi-
nesses are not excluded from the government 
contracting process, which is an important 
concern in Congress. 
With more than 65 percent of small busi-
nesses having experienced at least a mod-
erately negative impact from the COVID–19 
pandemic according to Statista Research, it is 
more vital than ever that we continue to 
strengthen small business. 
This legislation will provide that urgently 
needed support. 
As small businesses account for 44 percent 
of U.S. economic activity, they are the power-
house behind the American workforce, cre-
ating two-thirds of the new jobs over the last 
15 years. 
Small business is vital in times of crisis, giv-
ing our economy the ability to be more flexi-
ble, innovative, and productive. 
In my home district in Houston, there are 
over 600,000 small businesses engaged in in-
dustries across the spectrum. 
Many of these small businesses received 
subcontracts following the devastation of Hur-
ricanes Ike and Harvey, and their work helped 
rebuild Houston as well as restore local eco-
nomic growth. 
Just this week, there was a briefing on the 
COVID–19 pandemic response that under-
scored how important small business sub-
contracts were, and continue to be, to our ca-
pacity for COVID testing, quarantine, and 
much more. 
Small businesses are always serving our 
communities, and this legislation on subcon-
tracting will allow them to do more of what 
they’re already doing: improving life for us all. 
We need legislation that reinforces the value 
and capability that small businesses provide to 
the American economy, especially through 
contracts with the federal government. 
I urge all my colleagues to support H.R. 
7694, the Strengthening Subcontracting for 
Small Businesses Act.

The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr.

GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. NEGUSE. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
have 5 legislative days to revise and ex-
tend their remarks and include extra-
neous material on S. 3823. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Colorado? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. NEGUSE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank Senator DURBIN 
and Senator GRASSLEY for their work 
on this bill. I also thank my colleague 
on the other side of the aisle, Rep-
resentative CLINE, for being the Repub-
lican lead on the bill. 
The Bankruptcy Threshold Adjust-
ment and Technical Corrections Act 
shows that we can still come together 
in a bipartisan and bicameral way and 
make commonsense changes to the law 
that help small businesses on Main 
Street and everyday Americans. 
Before the COVID–19 pandemic, Mr. 
Speaker, many sole proprietors and 
middle-class families who live in high 
cost-of-living areas were ineligible to 
receive chapter 13 bankruptcy protec-
tions because the debt limits were far 
too low. For families forced into bank-
ruptcy who wanted to keep their 
homes, vehicles, or any essential prop-
erty, and were willing to pay off their 
debts under court supervision, chapter 
13 is their only lifeline. The alternative 
for these families can be devastating. 
Many have lost everything, including 
their homes. 
The story is similar for small busi-
nesses. In 2019, the American Bank-
ruptcy Institute’s Commission on Con-
sumer Bankruptcy found that the arti-
ficially low chapter 13 limits were driv-
ing people away from the relief that 
they needed, and they called on this 
Congress to act. 
Sole proprietors who could otherwise 
save their businesses and protect their 
families have been forced to liquidate 
everything because they exceeded the 
debt limits of chapter 13. 
The Small Business Reorganization 
Act of 2019, the SBRA, as the Speaker 
pro tempore knows, created subchapter 
V in chapter 11 bankruptcy, a vol-
untary option for small businesses in 
need of expedited bankruptcy relief. 
But that low debt limit meant that 
many small businesses simply could 
not take advantage of the program. 
The travesty of the pandemic really 
brought the need to increase these debt 
limits into stark relief. The CARES 
Act raised the debt limit threshold 
under the SBRA. That was done on a 
bipartisan basis by this House. It pro-
vided important protections to families 
and homeowners, but those provisions 
were temporary. 
My office has been contacted by 
countless professionals from all over 
the bankruptcy community expressing 
the need for this legislation. The Na-
tional 
Conference 
of 
Bankruptcy 
Judges, an association of the bank-
ruptcy judges of the United States, has 
said that the SBRA was one of the best 
modifications to the Bankruptcy Code 
in recent years. It assisted nearly 3,000 
small businesses across the country 
that were in need of expedited relief 
through the pandemic. The Office of 
the United States Trustee Program 
also reported that more than half of 
these small business debtors received 
successful outcomes through a con-
firmed reorganization plan in 6 months 
or less. 
Despite the success of this program, 
the debt limit increase under the SBRA 
expired earlier this year, just a few 
months ago, on March 27, 2022, which 
created an environment of uncertainty 
and unpredictability within the bank-
ruptcy arena. Today’s legislation retro-
actively restores that higher debt limit 
and extends it for another 2 years, al-
lowing more businesses to take advan-
tage of these protections under court 
supervision. 
This bill passed the Senate by unani-
mous consent, and I certainly hope 
that we can get a similar level of bipar-
tisan support here in the House. This 
bill will make a big difference by al-
lowing families to keep their homes, 
vehicles, and livelihoods intact while 
they repay their debt. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. BENTZ. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, S. 3823 would make 
modest and temporary changes to the 
U.S. Bankruptcy Code. 
First, the bill temporarily increases 
debt limits for small business debtors 
under subchapter V of chapter 11 and 
for 
individual 
debtors 
reorganizing 
debt under chapter 13. 
Subchapter V of the Bankruptcy 
Code is a lower cost reorganization 
bankruptcy option for small busi-
nesses. These businesses don’t have 
deep pockets, and traditional, expen-
sive chapter 11 reorganizations may 
not be feasible. 
Subchapter V is a more affordable 
and streamlined approach, which can 
lead to more successful reorganiza-
tions. That means that both debtors 
and creditors should be better off be-
cause, hopefully, less of the debtor’s es-
tate will go toward professional fees 
and more will be left for the debtor’s 
business and, ultimately, the creditors. 
Subchapter V took effect in February 
2020. At that time, the debt limit for 
those wishing to utilize this more 
streamlined law was just over $2.7 mil-
lion. Due in part to expected trouble 
for small businesses, the CARES Act 
and later legislation temporarily in-
creased the debt limit for subchapter V 
filers to $7.5 million. That temporary 
increase sunsetted in March of this 
year. This bill again extends the $7.5 
million debt limit for another 2 years. 
Likewise, the bill also changes the 
bankruptcy debt limits for chapter 13, 
which is a way for eligible individuals, 
including sole proprietors, to reorga-
nize their debts. The bill removes the 
distinction between secured and unse-
cured debt limits under chapter 13 and 
increases the overall debt limit for 
those who wish to file for their indi-
vidual protection from about $1.9 mil-
lion to $2.75 million. 
Like the adjustment to subchapter V, 
these changes to chapter 13 apply for 
only 2 years. Put simply, Americans 
are having a harder time making ends 
meet due to what I think we would 
agree are mistakes made under the 
Biden administration and Democrats in 
control of Congress. 
Raising the debt limit will allow 
those suffering from these failed poli-
cies to adjust their debts to fit the new

realities of our economy, skyrocketing 
energy and input costs, not enough 
workers, and more. A successful reor-
ganization can leave both debtors and 
creditors better off. 
At the same time, we just don’t have 
certain data about some of these bank-
ruptcy policy changes or their likely 
long-term effects. That is why these 
changes 
to 
our 
Bankruptcy 
Code 
should be temporary. 
An additional 2 years of normal post- 
pandemic bankruptcy activity will give 
us a better understanding of the under-
lying policy issues and will help guide 
the future design of our bankruptcy 
system. 
It is also worth noting that this bill 
did not go through regular order in the 
Judiciary Committee, so it did not ben-
efit from robust oversight or legisla-
tive 
hearings. 
Americans 
are 
best 
served when Federal policy is made 
after careful and focused congressional 
deliberation, something that would 
have occurred in regular order. 
The 
bill 
makes 
clarifications 
to 
small business bankruptcies that relate 
to eligibility, trustee responsibilities, 
and bankruptcy plan requirements. 
These would be permanent. The bill 
also makes accounting-related clari-
fications that will operate to improve 
the U.S. Trustee System Fund. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. NEGUSE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 
minutes to the distinguished gentle-
woman from Texas (Ms. JACKSON LEE). 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the distinguished member of our 
committee, Mr. NEGUSE, for his leader-
ship joining with the Senate, and I 
thank him for yielding, Mr. Speaker. 
This is a fresh start. This is a new op-
portunity in important bipartisan, bi-
cameral legislation that Mr. NEGUSE 
has nurtured and introduced and will 
ensure, under his leadership, that our 
bankruptcy system works for the en-
trepreneurs, small businesses, home-
owners, and American families, who 
are the backbone of this country and of 
the communities where they live and 
work. 
Having the privilege of having served 
on the Judiciary Committee for some 
time, I am reminded of the work that 
we have done, almost like a puzzle put-
ting together a better matrix for the 
American people to be able to renew 
their lives even as they may have the 
necessity of filing for bankruptcy. 
If there is one fundamental principle 
of American bankruptcy law, it is the 
promise of a fresh start, and the fresh 
start is quintessentially an American 
idea. It is a promise that even when 
your best efforts have failed, you are 
not a failure, and you will have a 
chance to get back up and try again. It 
is a promise that your debts will not 
destroy you. 
Increasing the debt limit for small 
businesses electing to file for bank-
ruptcy under subchapter V of chapter 
11 to $7.5 million is long overdue. 
Mr. Speaker, I particularly thank 
Mr. NEGUSE because really small busi-
nesses across America have been rais-
ing this question, making the point 
that it is impossible for them to sur-
vive with the previous cap for indi-
vidual chapter 11 filers of $2.75 million. 
This legislation will provide much- 
needed certainty that the bankruptcy 
system will be responsive to hard-
working Americans and their families 
trying to stay afloat in a world that 
can be turned upside down by global 
economic shocks. 
Just as I started, again, the filing of 
bankruptcy should not cause one to 
never renew again. This legislation, 
with the leadership of Mr. NEGUSE, 
gives our American businesspersons, 
homeowners, and others a fresh start. 
I ask my colleagues to support this 
legislation. 
b 1715 
Mr. NEGUSE. Mr. Speaker, I am pre-
pared to close and I reserve the balance 
of my time. 
Mr. BENTZ. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
back the balance of my time. 
Mr. NEGUSE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself the balance of my time. I will 
simply close by first thanking the dis-
tinguished chairwoman from Texas 
(Ms. JACKSON LEE), who is always so 
articulate and I am grateful for her 
leadership and kind remarks. 
I also thank Mr. CICILLINE, the chair-
man of the subcommittee of jurisdic-
tion, whose leadership was pivotal; and 
as I mentioned before, my Senate part-
ners and Representative CLINE. 
At the end of the day, I think we 
have a real opportunity today to honor 
American ingenuity, entrepreneurship, 
and innovation by providing our small 
businesses across the United States in 
Main Street after Main Street with the 
opportunity and the tools that they 
need to be able to survive. 
Mr. Speaker, I think this bill is a 
small step in that direction. It is bipar-
tisan. It passed the Senate unani-
mously, and I certainly hope that it 
will pass this Chamber unanimously as 
well. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support the bill, and I yield back the 
balance of my time. 
Mr. CICILLINE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong 
support of S. 3823, the ‘‘Bankruptcy Threshold 
Adjustment and Technical Corrections Act.’’ 
This important bipartisan, bicameral legisla-
tion introduced by my colleague, Congress-
man Neguse, will ensure that our bankruptcy 
system works for the entrepreneurs, small 
businesses, homeowners, and American fami-
lies who are the backbone of this country and 
of the communities where they live and work. 
If there is one foundational principle of 
American bankruptcy law, it is the promise of 
the ‘‘fresh start.’’ The fresh start is a 
quintessentially American idea. It is the prom-
ise that even when your best efforts have 
failed, you will have a chance to get back up 
and try again. It is the promise that your debts 
will not destroy you. 
By increasing the debt limit for small busi-
nesses electing to file for bankruptcy under 
subchapter V of Chapter 11 to $7.5 million, 
and for individual Chapter 13 filers to $2.75 
million, this legislation will provide much-need-
ed certainty that the bankruptcy system will be 
responsive to hardworking Americans and 
their families trying to stay afloat in a world 
that can get turned upside down by global 
economic shocks. 
We all benefit from the fresh start. When it 
works as intended, it boosts economic growth, 
reduces unemployment, and encourages inno-
vation and entrepreneurship. This legislation 
represents a major step toward ensuring that 
our bankruptcy system makes good on that 
promise. 
I thank my colleagues, Representatives 
Neguse and Cline, for their leadership on this 
bill and for their work to ensure that small 
businesses and families have meaningful ac-
cess to the bankruptcy process. 
I urge my colleagues to support S. 3823. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from Colorado (Mr. 
NEGUSE) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, S. 3823. 
The question was taken. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the 
opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being 
in the affirmative, the ayes have it. 
Mr. ROY. Mr. Speaker, on that I de-
mand the yeas and nays. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to section 3(s) of House Resolution 
8, the yeas and nays are ordered. 
Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, fur-
ther proceedings on this motion are 
postponed.

TITLE VI—DETERMINATION OF 
BUDGETARY EFFECTS 
SEC. 601. DETERMINATION OF BUDGETARY EF-
FECTS. 
The budgetary effects of this Act, for the 
purpose of complying with the Statutory 
Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010, shall be deter-
mined by reference to the latest statement 
titled ‘‘Budgetary Effects of PAYGO Legisla-
tion’’ for this Act, submitted for printing in 
the Congressional Record by the Chairman of 
the House Budget Committee, provided that 
such statement has been submitted prior to 
the vote on passage. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from Or-
egon (Mr. DEFAZIO) and the gentleman 
from Missouri (Mr. GRAVES) each will 
control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from Oregon. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. DEFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
have 5 legislative days in which to re-
vise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on H.R. 7776, 
as amended. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Oregon? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. DEFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, this will be the fifth 
consecutive 2-year authorization of the 
Water 
Resources 
Development 
Act 
since 2014, a tradition revived by our 
former chair, Bill Shuster. 
I am grateful for the partnership of 
Ranking Member SAM
GRAVES, Sub-
committee Chairwoman GRACE NAPOLI-
TANO, 
and 
Subcommittee 
Ranking 
Member DAVID
ROUZER
for all their 
work in developing this historic Water 
Resources Development Act. 
This legislation builds on the suc-
cesses of previous water bills, moving 
projects from feasibility to construc-
tion. This 2-year cycle is critical to ad-
dressing future water resource needs of 
our Nation. 
This bill authorizes construction of 
18 reports of the Chief of Engineers 
that were studied and transmitted to 
Congress since the last water bill was 
signed into law. These Chief’s reports 
represent thoroughly vetted, locally 
driven projects with highly engaged 
cost-share 
partners.

June 7, 2022 
cover a myriad of purposes from navi-
gation, flood control, levees, ecosystem 
restoration, that will benefit commu-
nities all across the United States of 
America. 
The bill also authorizes 72 new feasi-
bility studies and directs the Corps to 
expedite the completion of 14 ongoing 
studies. It is critical that we keep our 
infrastructure in this Nation up-to- 
date with new challenges—with severe 
weather events, sea level rise, and 
other things—and deal with the chal-
lenges that communities across this 
country endure. 
For two decades, I spent two dec-
ades—actually, I started longer than 
that—Bud Shuster in 1996—trying to 
free up the Harbor Maintenance Trust 
Fund. That is a tax paid by shippers, 
which ultimately is passed on to con-
sumers on the value of imported goods 
which have been impounded for years, 
totaling nearly $10 billion, while our 
harbors need dredging, jetties need re-
building. We finally got that done in 
2020. That was historic. 
It gives the Corps more resources on 
the harbor side, which means they can 
devote a little more of their allocation 
to the inland waterways and to their 
other 40-some-odd billion dollars of 
backlog of critical projects across the 
country. 
It will meet the challenge of climate 
change by rebuilding these navigation 
jetties and breakwaters to new heights 
and dimensions necessary for sea level 
rise and extreme weather. It will study 
the impact of coastal storms on inland 
flooding—which is a particular concern 
of the ranking member—address future 
water supplies in the arid West, which 
is a particular concern of all of us in 
the West, but particularly those fur-
ther south and the chair of the sub-
committee. 
Mr. Speaker, 21st century challenges 
should have 21st century solutions. The 
Corps has been hamstrung in their abil-
ity. We have worked with other Mem-
bers who have heard similar concerns. 
We included a solution in this bill that 
will allow the Corps to be the innova-
tion expert they need to be to address 
our Nation’s ongoing new challenges. 
I am also proud it will continue 
building upon efforts to provide equi-
table project outcomes and flexibility 
for 
communities 
with 
affordability 
concerns. It will address the needs of 
economically disadvantaged minority 
rural Tribal communities in an afford-
able manner. 
In particular, the bill creates a Trib-
al liaison position within each Corps’ 
district office. The Corps often fails to 
consult meaningfully with the Tribes. 
Tribal leaders will have a direct line of 
communication now into the regional 
office and back to the national office 
to get consultation, technical assist-
ance, and information to them. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank Subcommittee 
Chairwoman 
NAPOLITANO
and 
Rep-
resentative STANTON for their tireless 
work advocating for our Tribal commu-
nities. 
For the first time in over a decade, it 
significantly expands the Corps’ envi-
ronmental infrastructure authorities 
to assist more communities in address-
ing drinking water and wastewater 
needs. We need major work in these 
areas. Communities all across Amer-
ica—red, blue, whatever—are suffering, 
and we need these tools to help them. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairwoman 
NAPOLITANO for her effort to help the 
Corps with flexibility and additional 
authorities that will help them meet 
future water supply needs of the arid 
regions of this Nation. We are ration-
ing the Colorado River for the first 
time in history this year. Her input 
and advocacy also brought many of the 
environmental justice provisions to 
this bill—support for Tribal commu-
nities. She has been a tireless advocate 
for meeting the needs of her district 
and her State and the Nation. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank SAM GRAVES—I 
couldn’t have asked for a better part-
ner working on this bill—for his stead-
fast support which has made it pos-
sible. I thank the gentleman from 
North Carolina (Mr. ROUZER) for his 
support and wise input on the bill be-
fore us today. Their input brought in 
critical perspectives. 
We had the subcommittee vice chair 
from 
Georgia, 
Representative 
BOURDEAUX, who brought recreational 
safety concerns at local dams to our 
attention. We had the gentlewoman 
from Georgia (Ms. WILLIAMS), who sup-
ported a watershed-wide study of the 
Chattahoochee River. 
I thank the gentleman from Hawaii 
(Mr. KAHELE), who was an ardent advo-
cate of native Hawaiians and ensuring 
their participation in activities. I 
thank the gentleman for giving us new 
perspectives on that. Representative 
Newman of Illinois worked hard for all 
the Great Lakes. 
Representative CARTER came to the 
table with fresh policy and project 
ideas to help Louisiana deal with nat-
ural disasters, sea level rise, and severe 
weather events. 
Mr. Speaker, this is essential legisla-
tion, and I urge my colleagues to sup-
port it. I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. GRAVES of Missouri. Mr. Speak-
er, I yield myself such time as I may 
consume. 
Mr. Speaker, today I rise in strong 
support of H.R. 7776, the Water Re-
sources Development Act of 2022, or 
WRDA 2022. 
Mr. Speaker, 3 weeks ago we ad-
vanced this bipartisan legislation out 
of committee by voice vote, and I am 
proud to continue the bipartisan tradi-
tion of passing a WRDA bill every 2 
years—as the chairman pointed out— 
something we have done since 2014. 
I thank Chairman DEFAZIO, Water 
Resources 
and 
Environment 
Sub-
committee 
Chair 
NAPOLITANO, 
and 
Ranking Member ROUZER
for all of 
their hard work and support in getting 
this legislation across the finish line 
here in the House. 
WRDA 2022 authorizes water infra-
structure projects and policies that are 
critical to local communities, but also 
provides far-reaching benefits to both 
the region and our national economy. 
With the current supply chain crisis 
and 
surging 
inflation 
our 
country 
faces, it is more important than ever 
that Congress continues to support our 
Nation’s 
water 
infrastructure 
that 
keeps our economy moving and pro-
tects our communities. 
WRDA 2022 supports American com-
petitiveness and our economy by ensur-
ing the reliability and the effectiveness 
of our Nation’s ports and inland water-
ways to move American goods and 
products to those who need them. 
This legislation also boosts flood pro-
duction for our local communities, 
such as those in Missouri’s Sixth Dis-
trict, which is my own district. 
In Missouri, we are at a crossroads of 
the largest rivers in the country—the 
Missouri River and the Mississippi 
River. These rivers are an invaluable 
natural resource that provide drinking 
water, irrigation, and transportation; 
however, they can also be the source of 
some very devastating flooding. 
My constituents are still working to 
recover and rebuild their homes, farms, 
businesses, 
and 
their 
communities 
after devastating flooding that oc-
curred in 2019. 
I know all too well the consequences 
when water resources are mismanaged, 
which is why WRDA 2022 is going to en-
sure that the Corps remains focused on 
its core missions and priorities and ac-
tivities like flood control and naviga-
tion. 
To do this, this bill contains assist-
ance for meeting levee inspection re-
quirements, it examines ways to con-
trol erosion on our rivers, and it sup-
ports Missouri flood control projects. 
These and other provisions in WRDA 
2022 are going to provide benefits not 
only to Missourians, but citizens all 
across the country who depend on 
water resources and infrastructure in 
their daily lives. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank everybody for 
their support in developing this legisla-
tion, and that includes staff on both 
sides of the aisle. 
Specifically, on my team, I acknowl-
edge the work of my staff director, 
Paul Sass, for his leadership of the Re-
publican staff on this bill, and many 
other important bills for that matter, 
over the last 31⁄2 years. 
At the end of this week, Paul will be 
leaving the committee after more than 
20 years of public service on Capitol 
Hill—and all of that time working for 
me in my personal office or on my 
committee staff. I thank him for his 
dedication and his guidance and friend-
ship over the last two decades. He has 
a lot to be proud of as he moves for-
ward onto the next chapter of his ca-
reer. He can look back and be proud of 
all that he has done. I wish him and his 
family nothing but the best. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support 
today’s 
legislation, 
WRDA

Mr. DEFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 
minutes to the gentlewoman from Cali-
fornia (Mrs. NAPOLITANO), who is the 
chair of the subcommittee. 
Mrs. NAPOLITANO. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank Mr. DEFAZIO for yielding. 
Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to join my 
chair, PETER DEFAZIO, Ranking Mem-
ber GRAVES, and the subcommittee’s 
ranking 
member, 
my 
friend, 
Mr. 
ROUZER, and bring to the floor H.R. 
7776, the Water Resources Development 
Act of 2022. 
The Water Resources Development 
Act is our legislative commitment to 
investing in and protecting our com-
munities from flooding events, restor-
ing our environment and ecosystems, 
and keeping our Nation’s competitive-
ness by supporting our ports and har-
bors. 
Through the biennial enactment of 
WRDA legislation, the Transportation 
and Infrastructure Committee has ad-
dressed local, regional, and national 
needs through authorization of new 
U.S. Army Corps of Engineers projects, 
studies, and policies that benefit every 
corner of the Nation. 
We held four hearings in preparation 
for this bill, including a Member Day 
hearing. We had a formal process to re-
ceive legislative, policy, and project 
ideas from Members which resulted in 
1,500 ideas submitted to us by Mem-
bers, so that is quite an accomplish-
ment for our staff to go through. I 
thank all Members for engaging with 
the committee on this bill and advo-
cating for the needs of their districts. 
We were able to incorporate most of 
the requests from Members into the 
bill. 
I am particularly thankful that we 
were able to make a commitment in 
this 
WRDA—thank 
God, 
the 
fifth 
WRDA—to address the needs of Tribal 
and disadvantaged communities. The 
bill requires the Army Corps of Engi-
neers to improve outreach to these 
communities by creating liaison pro-
grams in each Corps district region 
across the country. That is new. 
WRDA includes provisions to develop 
technical assistance programs that 
provide guidance to Tribal commu-
nities on water resource projects, iden-
tify opportunities and challenges on 
existing Corps projects, and provide 
planning assistance for future projects. 
The bill gives Corps personnel the 
training and tools to effectively ad-
dress issues on Tribal lands of ances-
tral, historic, and cultural significance, 
including burial grounds. 
WRDA also continues the effort we 
started over 10 years ago to improve 
water supply at Corps dams by address-
ing managed aquifer replenishment so 
that dams can hold water for recharge 
to local groundwater basins. The bill 
addresses the buildup and removal of 
sediment in reservoirs to improve oper-
ations and capacity of dams. The bill 
requires the Corps to take a particular 
focus on infrastructure in the West, to 
evaluate 
opportunities 
to 
improve 
water management, water supply, and 
address the impacts of climate change. 
Section 116 of the bill continues Con-
gress’ goal of improving dam safety by 
assessing the status of all dams main-
tained by the Corps and determining 
the needs for rehabilitation, retrofit, or 
removal. 
Section 128 of the bill is bipartisan 
legislation my good friend, Ranking 
Member ROUZER, and I introduced ti-
tled H.R. 7762, the Army Corps of Engi-
neers Military Personnel Augmenta-
tion Act. It amends an outdated 1956 
law which is prohibitive against cur-
rent soldiers who have the technical 
skills to provide engineering support to 
the civil works mission of the Army 
Corps. 
In 1956 there were not a lot of NCOs 
with advanced degrees, so it was pre-
sumed that only commissioned officers 
would be properly trained to handle 
civil works responsibilities. However, 
since that time and the development of 
the professional Army, there are many 
NCOs, National Guard officers, and 
warrant officers with advanced engi-
neering and technical skills, and it no 
longer makes sense to exclude them 
from positions in civil works. This 
change is supported by the Secretary of 
the Army, the Chief of Engineers, and 
the National Guard Association of the 
United States. 
The bill also provides for hundreds of 
local concerns throughout the country. 
I am proud that this bill transfers the 
authorization of 31 debris basins in my 
region to the Los Angeles County 
Flood Control District. These debris 
basins are locally owned and have been 
successfully operated and maintained 
by the County of Los Angeles for dec-
ades. This provision will formalize the 
current operations of these debris ba-
sins. 
WRDA also includes authorization 
for the development of storm water, 
sewer, 
and 
ecosystem 
restoration 
projects in the San Gabriel Valley and 
greater Los Angeles County. This will 
improve flood protection and boost 
local water supply at the same time by 
investing in spreading grounds, dam in-
frastructure, 
and 
treatment 
oper-
ations. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank the many peo-
ple who have helped this bill become a 
reality. I thank the leadership at the 
U.S. Army Corps of Engineers—Assist-
ant Secretary Connor and Lieutenant 
General Spellmon—and their incredible 
staff who have worked through over 
1,000 submissions that we received for 
WRDA 2022. 
I am very fortunate to have some of 
the best water leaders in the country 
in my district and southern California 
who provided valuable input for this 
bill, including Colonel Julie Balten and 
David Van Dorpe of the Los Angeles 
District. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support H.R. 7776. 
Mr. GRAVES of Missouri. Mr. Speak-
er, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman 
from North Carolina (Mr. ROUZER), who 
is a member of the Water Resources 
and Environment Subcommittee. 
Mr. ROUZER. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
Chairman DEFAZIO, Chair NAPOLITANO, 
and Ranking Member GRAVES for their 
leadership and work to ensure the 
Water Resources Development Act, 
also known as WRDA for short, con-
tinues to be both bipartisan and bien-
nial. 
Because of this commitment, before 
the House today is H.R. 7776, the Water 
Resources Development Act of 2022. I 
am pleased to be a part of this con-
tinuing bipartisan tradition of passing 
a WRDA every 2 years. Just 3 weeks 
ago this bill passed out of the com-
mittee by voice vote. 
The legislation is a product resulting 
from the input of many Members of 
Congress. It is an example of what can 
be achieved when Congress comes to-
gether to find solutions for their con-
stituents and the American public. 
WRDA bills provide congressional di-
rection to the Army Corps of Engineers 
on the allocations of dollars for water

resource projects and policy across the 
Nation. This legislation authorizes a 
number of Chief’s Reports and studies, 
as well as new environmental infra-
structure projects for the first time 
since 2007. 
In my home State of North Carolina, 
we rely on a significant amount of 
coastal and inland waterway infra-
structure and resources. These bring us 
many benefits, but our communities 
can also face devastating consequences 
from flooding of inland waterways as a 
result. 
WRDA 2022 will help our commu-
nities address these risks by directing 
the Corps to improve management of 
our Nation’s coastal mapping projects 
which provide information to States 
and local communities so they can bet-
ter respond to extreme weather events. 
This program and other provisions in 
this year’s legislation will provide im-
proved flood control and storm damage 
reduction for constituents and stake-
holders all across the country. 
I am pleased to be a part of this bi-
partisan effort, and, again, I thank 
Chairman DEFAZIO and Chair NAPOLI-
TANO for working across the aisle with 
us on this critical commonsense legis-
lation. 
I also want to take a quick moment 
to thank Paul Sass, staff director for 
the minority of the committee who 
will soon be leaving for other opportu-
nities. He has provided many years of 
service and hard work for the people of 
Missouri, Ranking Member GRAVES, 
myself, and all the members of the T & 
I Committee. I thank Paul for his great 
counsel and all the work he has done. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support this bill. 
Mr. DEFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, may I 
ask as to how much time remains on 
my side. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from Oregon has 9 minutes re-
maining. 
Mr. DEFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
21⁄2 minutes to the gentlewoman from 
Georgia (Ms. BOURDEAUX). 
Ms. 
BOURDEAUX. 
Mr. 
Speaker, 
today I rise in support of the Water Re-
sources Development Act of 2022. I am 
grateful 
for 
Chairs 
DEFAZIO
and 
NAPOLITANO
and 
Ranking 
Members 
GRAVES
and ROUZER
as well as the 
Transportation 
and 
Infrastructure 
Committee staff for working with my 
office and me to ensure that some key 
needs for Georgia were met. 
My district specifically is home to 
Lake Lanier and the Buford Dam, 
which are critical resources in the 
Chattahoochee River Basin. The Chat-
tahoochee River supplies 70 percent of 
metro Atlanta’s drinking water, and it 
is hard to overstate how essential the 
lake and river are to the metro area. 
The river is also a key source of water 
for farmers and agriculture throughout 
the State. But according to the Chat-
tahoochee Riverkeeper, more than 1,000 
miles of waterway within the water-
shed do not meet water quality stand-
ards. 
This bill would authorize a water-
shed-based study for the Chattahoo-
chee River Basin which will allow the 
Army Corps of Engineers to assess the 
water resource needs of the basin, in-
cluding ecosystem protection and res-
toration, flood risk management, wa-
tershed protection, water supply, and 
drought preparedness. 
This bill also includes my important 
legislation, Lake Lanier and Upper 
Chattahoochee River Safety Act, which 
would direct the Army Corps to carry 
out a review of potential threats to 
human life and safety from the use of 
the river. Unfortunately, there are 
parts of the river that are extremely 
dangerous, and during a release of 
water from Buford Dam, the Chat-
tahoochee can rise as much as 11 feet 
in 1 minute. Based on the findings of 
this review, the bill would authorize 
the Corps to take measures necessary 
to make the river safer and minimize 
or eliminate some of these hazards. 
Finally, I am proud to see Lake La-
nier included as a focus area in the pre-
viously authorized harmful algal bloom 
demonstration 
program 
which 
will 
allow the Corps to work with local 
stakeholders to research tools for 
freshwater HABs detection, prevention, 
and management which is critical to 
protecting the drinking water of mil-
lions of people. 
Mr. Speaker, the bill before us today 
delivers for my constituents and the 
people of Georgia. It delivers for the 
people of this country. I urge my col-
leagues to vote ‘‘yes.’’ 
Mr. GRAVES of Missouri. Mr. Speak-
er, I yield 11⁄2 minutes to the gentleman 
from Arkansas (Mr. CRAWFORD), who is 
the 
ranking 
member 
of 
the 
sub-
committee. 
Mr. CRAWFORD. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today in support of the Water Re-
sources and Development Act. 
WRDA authorizes projects designed 
to improve the Nation’s water re-
sources infrastructure, including ports 
and harbors, inland waterway naviga-
tion, and flood and storm protection. 
I am thankful to Chairman DEFAZIO 
for working with me to ensure prior-
ities of my district made it into the 
final language, and for the leadership 
of Ranking Member GRAVES
as we 
fought for community-driven water so-
lutions. WRDA is a testament to our 
ability to still pass critical legislation 
and still work in a bipartisan fashion 
to deliver results to the American peo-
ple. I encourage my colleagues to vote 
in favor of H.R. 7776. 
Finally, let me add my voice to those 
recognizing Paul Sass, who is ending 
his 20-year career on Capitol Hill at the 
end of the week as the Republican staff 
director. Since coming to the T&I 
Committee 
with 
Ranking 
Member 
GRAVES, Paul has dedicated countless 
hours to improving, investing in, and 
securing our Nation’s infrastructure. 
He has not only been a valuable asset 
to the Graves staff, but he has been a 
resource to my staff as well and helped 
lead the committee’s commitment to a 
safe and efficient transportation sys-
tem. 
I thank Paul for his years of public 
service, and I wish him all the best in 
his next chapter. 
Mr. DEFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentleman from Cali-
fornia (Mr. GARAMENDI). 
Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Speaker, a big 
thank you to Representatives DEFAZIO, 
NAPOLITANO, 
GRAVES, 
ROUZER, 
and 
their incredible staff who put together 
the Water Resources Development Act 
of 2022. 
There is always talk about congres-
sional dysfunction, and that is cer-
tainly true in the Senate, not here in 
the House of Representatives. This is 
the fifth consecutive biennial WRDA 
that the House has brought to the floor 
since 2014. 
The Water Resources Development 
Act provides key provisions for Solano 
and Yolo Counties, the bay area, the 
Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta, and all 
of California’s Third Congressional Dis-
trict. 
Specifically, the Water Resources De-
velopment Act directs the Army Corps 
of Engineers to examine the economic 
and national security benefits of dredg-
ing the Mare Island Strait channel 
which has not been studied since 1999. 
This is the first step in my ongoing ef-
forts to increase Federal investment 
into Mare Island and its ship repair fa-
cilities for the U.S. Navy and Coast 
Guard, including the $13 million pri-
vate investment announced by the 
Mare Island Dry Dock Company. 
It also authorizes $50 million for en-
vironmentally friendly infrastructure 
projects in the five counties com-
prising the California Delta. Further-
more, it provides construction and au-
thorizes construction for the Lower 
Cache Creek flood risk management 
project with the city of Woodland. It 
doubles Federal funding to $50 million 
to support restoration efforts at the 
Lake Tahoe basin. It requires the 
Army Corps to use more dredged sedi-
ment for beneficial use and to restore 
the San Francisco Bay Area wetlands 
instead of just dumping the dredged 
sediment in the open ocean. 
It authorizes the Army Corps’ na-
tional levee safety initiative to help 
manage flood risk across the entire Na-
tion, including more than 200 miles of 
the Sacramento River which I cur-
rently represent. 
It makes the Sacramento-San Joa-
quin Delta a new focus area for the 
Corps in its effort to combat invasive 
species. Finally, it directs the Army 
Corps to complete long-overdue rec-
ommendations to Congress on finally 
making water supply a purpose of all 
Army Corps reservoirs and related in-
frastructure, which is a critical change 
for Western States like California fac-
ing more frequent and severe droughts 
due to climate change. 
Mr. Speaker, I look forward to work-
ing with the chairs, the ranking mem-
bers, and my colleagues from both par-
ties to get this timely legislation to

President Biden’s desk for signature by 
the end of the calendar year. 
Mr. GRAVES of Missouri. Mr. Speak-
er, I yield 11⁄2 minutes to the gentleman 
from Texas (Mr. BABIN). 
b 1745 
Mr. BABIN. Mr. Speaker, I thank my 
friend from Missouri, Ranking Member 
GRAVES, for yielding me time to speak 
on the 2022 Water Resources Develop-
ment Act. 
As someone who has seen firsthand 
the impact WRDA has had on Ameri-
cans and our communities, I am great-
ly honored to have worked on this 
year’s legislation. 
A major priority for southeast Texas, 
the Texas Coastal Spine, is authorized 
in 
this 
legislation. 
This 
must-do 
project to protect our home State from 
hurricane storm surge and flooding will 
make millions of Texans, as well as our 
State’s most important economic hubs, 
where a huge percentage of our Na-
tion’s gasoline and strategic fuels are 
manufactured, much safer. 
Additionally, this bill expedites vital 
projects at the Port of Houston and the 
Sabine-Neches Waterway, the busiest 
port in the country and where more 
military equipment is shipped than any 
other waterway respectively. 
We need to get this bill across the 
finish line. And I thank Chairman 
DEFAZIO, Ranking Member GRAVES, as 
well as Subcommittee Chairwoman 
NAPOLITANO
and 
Ranking 
Member 
ROUZER and their staffs for everyone’s 
hard work on this bill. 
I also take a moment to thank Paul 
Sass, the departing Republican staff di-
rector, for his many years of service on 
the Transportation and Infrastructure 
Committee. 
Paul’s 
commitment 
to 
mission and dedication to public serv-
ice have improved, not only our com-
mittee, but the Congress as a whole. 
And I wish him the absolute best of 
luck with all of his future endeavors. 
Mr. DEFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from Hawaii 
(Mr. KAHELE). 
Mr. KAHELE. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman for yielding. 
I rise in support of the fiscal year 
2022 Water Resources and Development 
Act, legislation which will invest in 
America’s ports, harbors, and inland 
waterways, as well as build more cli-
mate-resilient communities. 
For the first time ever, WRDA in-
cludes Section 219 environmental infra-
structure projects for the State of Ha-
waii, which will ensure that Maui, 
Kauai, Hawaii and Honolulu County 
are able to address wastewater infra-
structure and confront these chal-
lenges head-on today, because the cost 
of waiting is too great. 
This WRDA will also, for the first 
time ever, include a provision that will 
enable NHOs, or Native Hawaiian Orga-
nizations, to waive local cost-sharing 
requirements of up to $200,000 for crit-
ical environmental projects, which will 
open the doors to new environmental 
restoration projects and career oppor-
tunities in every county. This provi-
sion will help to provide more parity 
between indigenous communities, and I 
applaud its inclusion in this bill. 
I am proud to support this bipartisan 
effort to invest in our ports and har-
bors, build more resilient communities, 
and support our indigenous brothers 
and sisters across the country. 
Mr. GRAVES of Missouri. Mr. Speak-
er, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman 
from Florida (Mr. MAST). 
Mr. MAST. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
both the chairs and the ranking mem-
bers for their work on this piece of leg-
islation and, specifically, helping to 
combat some injustices. 
Injustice number one is this bill 
works to prohibit once and for all, fi-
nally getting rid of all the toxic dis-
charges out of Lake Okeechobee into 
what we call our northern estuaries in 
Florida. That is fixing injustice num-
ber one. 
Injustice number two that this bill 
specifically addresses is, with those 
toxic, poisonous waters there are Corps 
of Engineers personnel that are work-
ing on top of those, sometimes for 8 or 
10 hours a day, for weeks or months on 
end. And it actually requires that a let-
ter be put in the file of those military 
personnel denoting their exposure to 
this so if something happens to them 
down the road they don’t have to fight 
like so many of our servicemembers 
have to fight to get the appropriate 
care. 
So I thank them for their work in 
helping to fix injustices in this specific 
piece of legislation. 
Mr. DEFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I again 
inquire as to the remaining time just 
to check here. We are tight on time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from Oregon has 4 minutes re-
maining. The gentleman from Missouri 
has 101⁄2 minutes remaining. 
Mr. DEFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from Lou-
isiana (Mr. CARTER). 
Mr. 
CARTER 
of 
Louisiana. 
Mr. 
Speaker, in Louisiana, we know the 
awesome power of the water. We also 
know that it is the lifeblood of our Na-
tion’s economy and environment. 
The Army Corps of Engineers is the 
Federal department that most supports 
water management, ecosystem restora-
tion, and flood control, critical issues 
in my region. 
The Water Resources Development 
Act is the mechanism Congress uses for 
these authorizations, and it is a crit-
ical policy for my district. As a mem-
ber of the Transportation and Infra-
structure Committee, I am proud to 
have worked to include important up-
dates for my district in WRDA, such as 
instructing the Corps of Engineers to 
continue paused ecosystem restoration 
on the Mississippi River Gulf Outlet; 
authorizing $136 million for St. John, 
St. Bernard, St. James, St. Charles, 
and Plaquemines Parishes for com-
prehensive treatment facilities and 
water infrastructure. 
And on a personal note, the final 
version included my amendment to im-
prove safety features along the banks 
of the Mississippi River, an important 
move after the recent tragic drowning 
of three children in Algiers in my dis-
trict. 
As we work to untangle supply 
chains and navigate climate change, we 
can’t delay critical water management 
projects. I urge the favorable passage 
of the WRDA act, H.R. 7776. 
Mr. GRAVES of Missouri. Mr. Speak-
er, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman 
from Puerto Rico (Miss GONZA´ LEZ- 
COLO´ N). 
Miss GONZA´ LEZ-COLO´ N. Mr. Speak-
er, I thank the leadership and ranking 
member for allowing all the amend-
ments and the language included in 
this bill. 
WRDA has always been key for infra-
structure development projects in all 
our States and territories, and this 
year’s bill will not be the exception. 
This has been a cornerstone in the 
process of Puerto Rico’s recovery, and 
this legislation enables it to continue 
to do so. 
This bill includes the reauthorization 
of three major flood risk management 
projects in Puerto Rico: Rio Guanajibo 
in Mayaguez, Rio Nigua in Salinas, and 
Rio Grande de Loiza in Gurabo, that 
had waited for funding, in some cases, 
for over a decade, to the point that the 
original authorizations had to be with-
drawn and new validation studies re-
quired. 
The projects had later received fund-
ing for at least their initial stages 
after passage of the Bipartisan Budget 
Act of 2018, but needed this reauthor-
ization so their development can con-
tinue with the planning and design, the 
allocated funding is protected from 
loss, and updated project needs can be 
addressed in the future so they can 
move on construction. 
So by advancing this legislation con-
taining these provisions, this House 
demonstrates its commitment to our 
communities. I look forward for the ap-
proval of this bill. And again, I thank 
all the staff and leadership and the 
ranking member for allowing all these 
amendments. 
Mr. DEFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentlewoman from Flor-
ida (Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ), who has 
done some extraordinary work for her 
district and Florida on this bill. 
Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Mr. 
Speaker, I thank the gentleman for 
yielding. And I congratulate him on 
this incredible work product and a re-
markable career. 
I rise today in support of H.R. 7776, 
the Water Resources Development Act. 
This bill will advance the economic in-
terests of South Florida. 
After more than 20 years of work, the 
Port Everglades deepening and wid-
ening project will enable safe passage 
of next-generation cruise and cargo 
ships, and it is estimated to create 
1,500 good, permanent jobs when it is 
finished. 
This bill authorizes an additional 
$269 million in Federal funding for Port

Everglades to complete the project, 
protect our coral reefs from disruption, 
and begin construction on an overdue 
new Coast Guard station. 
I came to Congress as a young mom, 
and I remember telling my children 
about the potential effects of climate 
change. Now, in 2022, we know that the 
perils of a warming planet are no 
longer just predictions. 
We have over 1,000 miles of levees and 
canals, 150 water control structures, 
and 16 major pump stations providing 
flood protection for 11 million resi-
dents in central and South Florida 
alone. 
A 2009 study identified 18 water con-
trol structures in Miami-Dade and 
Broward Counties alone that are with-
in 6 inches of failure. 
I urge passage of this important bill, 
and I appreciate the opportunity to 
speak in favor of it. 
Mr. GRAVES of Missouri. Mr. Speak-
er, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman 
from Texas (Mr. NEHLS). 
Mr. NEHLS. Mr. Speaker, Hurricane 
Harvey exposed how unprepared our in-
frastructure and flood mitigation ef-
forts were for one of the most strategi-
cally important regions in the Nation. 
Aside from the emotional and psy-
chological toll Harvey inflicted on my 
community, it is estimated that Har-
vey cost $125 billion in damages. 
Instead 
of 
continually 
spending 
money on the back end of tragedies 
that experts agree cost infinitely more, 
I am proud the Federal Government is 
authorizing investments in flood miti-
gation and prevention that will help 
deter another Harvey-like scenario. 
I am also pleased that language in 
section 325 authorizes the Secretary to 
provide technical assistance related to 
non-Federal interests and the removal 
of sediment obstructing inflow chan-
nels to Addicks and Barker Reservoirs. 
In addition to the statutory changes 
for sediment removal, I am proud to 
support the authorization of $19.2 bil-
lion for the Texas coastal protection 
and restoration project. 
The Port of Houston is home to the 
largest petrochemical manufacturing 
complex in the Americas; 42 percent of 
the specialty chemical feedstocks, 27 
percent of the gas, and 60 percent of 
the jet aviation fuel are all produced in 
the region. It is good to see govern-
ment working for the people. 
Mr. DEFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 30 
seconds to the gentleman from Oregon 
(Mr. SCHRADER). 
Mr. SCHRADER. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today in support of this year’s Water 
Resources Development Act, which in-
cludes funding for several critical pri-
orities for my State and my district. 
I am very proud to share that this 
bill authorizes funding to help the city 
of Newport replace its woefully out-
dated and dangerous Big Creek Dam. 
This dam holds the city’s water supply; 
sits right above the city; could com-
pletely wipe out the city in an earth-
quake. 
Funding is also designated for waste-
water treatment and dredging along 
the Oregon coast, particularly in our 
areas that are facing a lot of issues 
with the Pacific Ocean. 
I really appreciate the opportunity to 
present on this report and urge its pas-
sage. 
Mr. GRAVES of Missouri. Mr. Speak-
er, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman 
from New York (Ms. MALLIOTAKIS). 
Ms. MALLIOTAKIS. Mr. Speaker, I 
rise today to support this legislation 
that includes my language to secure 
additional funds for the Staten Island 
seawall to protect my constituents 
from a future hurricane. 
In October, it will be 10 years since 
Hurricane Sandy devastated parts of 
New York City. Particularly hard-hit 
was my borough of Staten Island, 
where 24 lives were lost, hundreds of 
families were displaced, and thousands 
of homes were damaged. 
Since the project’s approval in 2013, 
bureaucratic red tape resulted in costly 
redesigns and repeated delays. This 
vital flood mitigation project is long 
overdue, and I made a commitment 
that when I came to Congress I would 
get it back on track. 
In February, the city and Federal 
Governments came to an agreement on 
the radiation clean-up in Great Kills 
Park, which will allow for construction 
on the project’s levee, floodwall, and 
tide gate. 
This fall, the contract for the first 
phase is expected to be issued so we can 
break ground on the drainage portion 
in South Beach and finally begin this 
long-awaited project that is critical to 
the livelihoods of my constituents, and 
will help reduce flood insurance costs. 
Today, we will ensure that the 
project will be fully funded through 
this bill. I thank my colleagues for 
their support of this legislation. 
Mr. DEFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 30 
seconds 
to 
the 
gentlewoman 
from 
Texas (Ms. JACKSON LEE). 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I 
give great accolades to the chairman 
for his years of service. 
This bill, H.R. 7776, deals with water 
resources infrastructure, makes com-
munities more resilient, and helps in-
digenous minority communities, but 
urban areas as well. 
The first longstanding impact that 
we have had in Texas over the years, 
one of the big ones was Hurricane Ike; 
195 dead, 143 miles per hour and, of 
course, $38 billion. It was, in fact, the 
seventh most expensive hurricane. 
We have continued with the devasta-
tion through Hurricane Harvey. This 
helps us with the Ike Dike and the 
coastal spine. We are saving lives and 
helping people. 
I support this bill because we can live 
on the Gulf Coast. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 7776, 
the ‘‘Water Resources Development Act of 
2022.’’ 
This is the bill costal regions await because 
it outlines what critical infrastructure projects 
will be funded by or in part by the federal gov-
ernment. 
I rise to speak on behalf of the city of Hous-
ton, which was shortchanged by the General 
Land Office of Houston, which has not re-
ceived a single dollar out of $4.3 billion in Hur-
ricane Harvey funding appropriated by this 
body for flood mitigation. 
Houston experienced 25 percent of the 
damage caused by Hurricane Harvey which 
occurred in the city of Houston and twenty-five 
percent occurred in Harris County. 
Harris County did receive its Hurricane Har-
vey Flood mitigation funding, while Houston 
did not receive funding for the billions in dam-
age caused by flood water. 
As the Member of Congress representing 
the 18th Congressional District of Texas, a 
senior member of the House Homeland Secu-
rity Committee, and the person who led the 
successful effort in the House of Representa-
tives to secure the federal disaster funding 
needed to mitigate and recover from the epic 
damage caused by Hurricane Harvey, I ad-
dress this body to say if this has happened to 
the fourth largest city in the Nation, it can hap-
pen to any community. 
When Congress appropriates, there should 
be no light between our decision and the ex-
pending of disaster mitigation funding. 
The funds provided to insure that the same 
level of damage given the same factors are 
not repeated in the future. 
Because of the inexplicable decision by the 
Texas General Land Office (GLO) refusing to 
award to the City of Houston or Harris County 
any of the nearly $1 billion in funding for flood 
mitigation projects from the $4.2 billion grant it 
received from the U.S. Department of Housing 
and Urban Development are not ready for an-
other storm of the size and intensity of Hurri-
cane Harvey. 
I requested that the Department of Housing 
and Urban Development review the propriety 
and legality of the action and Texas GLO and 
suspend it from distribution any of $4.2 billion 
tranche, until after HUD completes its review. 
The review should include a determination 
of whether the decision of the Texas GLO 
complies with Title VI of the 1964 Civil Rights 
Act and the Department’s regulations. 
HUD found that there was nothing it could 
do because of the agreement that the Trump 
Administration entered into with the State of 
Texas. 
It is impossible to justify the decision not to 
award a single dollar out of the $1 billion fund-
ing tranche to the City of Houston and Harris 
County, which are the economic hub of Texas 
and the southwest United States, and which 
accounts for 16.3 percent of the state popu-
lation and more than 44 percent of the popu-
lation directly affected by Hurricane Harvey. 
Hurricane Harvey did not impact all jurisdic-
tions equally. Houston has experienced 5 
major flood events in 5 years, with Harris 
County as the only county affected by disas-
ters in 2015, 2016, 2017, and 2019. The cost 
per-capita of damage in the City of Houston is 
much greater than in rural areas because of 
the infrastructure and density of residential 
and business structures. 
The Texas GLO appears to have forgotten 
or disregarded the damage to Houston and 
Harris County as a result of Hurricane Harvey, 
which dropped 21 trillion gallons of rainfall on 
Texas and Louisiana, most of it on the Hous-
ton Metroplex. 
To put in perspective the devastation 
wrought by Hurricane Harvey, the volume of 
water that fell on Houston and other affected 
areas of Texas and Louisiana could fill more

than 24,000 Astrodomes or supply the water 
for the raging Niagara Falls for 15 days. 
Houston received more than 50 inches of 
rainfall and whole sections of Houston, Beau-
mont, Bayou City, Port Arthur, and other cities 
were underwater for days. 
More than 13,000 people were rescued in 
the Houston area and more than 30,000 per-
sons were forced out of their homes due to 
the storm. In just the first three days of the 
storm, more than 49,000 homes that had suf-
fered flood damage and more than 1,000 
homes were completely destroyed in the 
storm. The cost of removing debris dwarfed 
the $70 million spent by Houston removing de-
bris after Hurricane Ike in 2008. 
Given these facts, it is irrational and uncon-
scionable that Texas GLO awarded nearly $1 
billion in U.S. Housing and Urban Develop-
ment funds to other local governments in 46 
Southeast Texas counties but none to the City 
of Houston. 
I am in support of this bill because it renews 
America’s commitment to our environment by 
funding U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to carry 
out critical infrastructure projects, especially in 
our Nation’s coastal areas and waterways. It 
also prioritizes climate change in the research 
and implementation of the Corps’ work. 
H.R. 7776 will implement long-overdue mod-
ernization of the Corps’ procedures and en-
sure that the economic benefits associated 
with a revitalized infrastructure are specifically 
advancing disadvantaged groups. Section 224 
of this legislation mandates a report on the 
distribution of funds to Small Disadvantaged 
Businesses. 
Those businesses include the thousands of 
small companies owned by people of color 
and indigenous people. This legislation gives 
us the opportunity to recenter our Nation’s in-
frastructure development around black and 
brown business owners who have been per-
petually left behind. 
I am pleased that this legislation requires a 
report to Congress by the Secretary of the 
Army—who oversees the Army Corps of Engi-
neers—that specifies the amount of contract 
and subcontract dollars awarded by the Corps 
to ‘‘small and disadvantaged businesses’’. 
I hope to work with the Senate to further re-
inforce the Army Corps, putting in place reli-
able strong programs and outreach for use of 
MWBE in this work. 
The programs for economic assistance and 
inclusion of MWBE by the Army Corps in 
these infrastructure programs must be done. 
MWBE and stopping flooding work together. 
This transparency will help ensure that small 
businesses owned by people of color are 
given a fair opportunity to compete for contract 
and subcontract dollars in water projects. Fur-
thermore, the report will enable Congress to 
hold the Corps accountable if the share of dol-
lars to small disadvantaged businesses is in-
adequate. 
Projects to research and mitigate flooding 
are critical to my constituents in Houston, as 
flood waters present a perpetual risk to my 
district and the surrounding community. Lev-
ees, bayous, reservoirs, and watersheds must 
all be maintained and reinforced to protect 
Houston from flood risks. Minority-owned busi-
nesses, who face these perpetual risks, must 
be included in the contracts to protect our 
communities from those risks. 
In 2017, when Hurricane Harvey wreaked 
havoc on Houston and the entire coast of 
Texas, it caused more than $125 billion dollars 
in damage and killed 68 Texans. 
As time passes, hurricanes become more 
intense as our planet warms. Funding the 
Corps’ projects will not only help protect com-
munities in Houston by reducing flooding, but 
also by lessening America’s carbon footprint. 
That will make these natural disasters less 
likely to occur. 
H.R. 7776 funds projects in Houston like the 
removing of sediment from the Addicks and 
Barker reservoirs, restoring our coastal re-
gions, and expanding the Houston Ship Chan-
nel. These are critical to the economic viability 
and well-being of millions of people in South 
Texas. 
It is time for Congress to act to save lives 
and protect our communities. This funding will 
dually promote a greener America while also 
working to lift marginalized groups. In doing 
both, we make our Nation a more prosperous 
and equitable place. 
Mr. GRAVES of Missouri. Mr. Speak-
er, can I inquire as to time remaining? 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman has 71⁄2 minutes remaining. 
Mr. GRAVES of Missouri. And the 
time for the other side? 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from Oregon has 11⁄2 minutes re-
maining. 
Mr. GRAVES of Missouri. Mr. Speak-
er, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman 
from Florida (Mr. GIMENEZ). 
Mr. GIMENEZ. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today in support of the Water Re-
sources Development Act to improve 
our ports and harbors, inland waterway 
navigation, flood and storm protection, 
and other pieces of water resources in-
frastructure, all with a focus on locally 
driven projects rather than a nation-
wide partisan wish list. 
This bill is an example of supporting 
real infrastructure, and it goes to 
prove that if we focus on real infra-
structure, Congress can come together 
in a bipartisan manner. 
This legislation has a lot of wins for 
South Florida. In it, we get provisions 
to expedite projects to protect Miami- 
Dade County and Monroe County from 
future storm damage. The flooding this 
past weekend in Miami underscored the 
importance of these projects for our re-
gion, particularly as we begin hurri-
cane season. 
We also doubled funding levels for 
the Florida Keys Water Quality Im-
provement Project to expand sanitary 
sewer systems in the Keys. 
Overall, this legislation will be great-
ly beneficial to South Florida. It is in-
credible what we can accomplish when 
we put political hackery to the side 
and focus on the real needs of the 
American people. I urge my colleagues 
to support this year’s WRDA.

Mr. GRAVES of Missouri. Mr. Speak-
er, I yield 11⁄2 minutes to the gentleman 
from Louisiana (Mr. GRAVES). 
Mr. 
GRAVES 
of 
Louisiana. 
Mr. 
Speaker, this bill is very important 
and includes important hurricane pro-
tection for the Upper Barataria area, 
which is going to help Jefferson, St. 
Charles, and Lafourche Parishes, all 
the way up to Ascension Parish. If this 
had been in place when Hurricane Ida 
made landfall, we would have had fun-
damentally different conditions. 
It is going to make higher, stronger 
levees. In the New Orleans area, $3 bil-
lion in new investments there, which 
we worked on with Congressman CAR-
TER and Congressman SCALISE. 
It clarifies the cost-share for the Mis-
sissippi River-Gulf Outlet, something 
that never should have been in conten-
tion. 
It helps to manage water on the Mis-
sissippi River, expedites the Comite 
project, and makes tens of millions of 
dollars in additional authorizations for 
water and wastewater in the capital, 
river, and bayou regions. 
Mr. Speaker, there are a lot of people 
who helped with this legislation. One of 
them is Paul Sass, and I thank Paul for 
his nearly 20 years of service to this 
House and to this committee. Had he 
not been around working on many of 
these bills, it simply would not have 
happened, and I appreciate it. Having 
worked with the ranking member for 
some period of time, I couldn’t imagine 
working 20 years with him. Amazing. 
Mr. Speaker, I also thank Ranking 
Member SAM GRAVES for his hard work 
on this. I thank Chairman DEFAZIO, 
Tim Petty, Leslie Parker, and Melissa 
Beaumont for their work on this im-
portant legislation. 
This is all about making investments 
of millions of dollars before disasters 
happen in order to prevent billions of 
dollars in disaster recovery and loss of 
life. 
Lastly, I thank Water Resources and 
Environment 
Subcommittee 
Chair 
NAPOLITANO, as well as Ranking Mem-
ber ROUZER, for their hard work on this 
legislation. 
Mr. DEFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. GRAVES of Missouri. Mr. Speak-
er, I yield 11⁄2 minutes to the gentleman 
from Texas (Mr. WEBER). 
Mr. WEBER of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman for yielding. 
Mr. Speaker, maintaining and im-
proving our ports, waterways, and 
water infrastructure is critically im-
portant to the 14th District of Texas, 
as well as to our great State and Na-
tion. Our families, our businesses, and 
the critical infrastructure along the 
upper Texas Gulf Coast will benefit 
from WRDA 2022. 
Of particular importance to Texas, 
and the Nation, quite frankly, is a 
coastal spine. I have heard it several 
ways. It will mitigate the impact of 
major hurricanes and other significant 
water events in and around Galveston 
Bay, just south of the Houston Ship 
Channel, and all the families and the 
vast petrochemical industry that sur-
rounds it. 
In September 2008, Texas 14 was 
slammed by Hurricane Ike along a 
track similar to the deadly 1900 Storm 
of Galveston that cost 5,000 to 8,000 
lives and billions of dollars in damage.

June 7, 2022 
The damage from Ike, and the even 
more catastrophic Hurricane Harvey, 
could have been reduced significantly 
by the proposed coastal barrier that we 
call the Ike Dike. After years and years 
of pushing for this vital barrier system, 
I am proud that it is included in WRDA 
2022. 
While this bill does not reflect all the 
priorities we might prefer, I urge my 
colleagues to vote in favor of this bill. 
I, too, add my order of thanks to both 
sides. This has been a great task, a 
great staff we have. 
Mr. DEFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. GRAVES of Missouri. Mr. Speak-
er, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman 
from California (Mr. LAMALFA). 
Mr. LAMALFA. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
my colleague for yielding. 
Tonight, I join my colleagues in sup-
port of this year’s Water Resources De-
velopment Act. While it may not be 
readily apparent, the threat of storm 
damage and floods remains front and 
center, despite the prolonged drought 
across the Western United States. 
In the wake of wildfires, mudslides 
will bring vegetation down from moun-
tainsides into our public waterways. 
With fewer but more intense storms 
seen this year, the risk of flash floods 
has increased. 
Now, as with many bipartisan bills, 
there are policies and provisions that I 
believe are missing from this measure. 
That work is not done. I will continue 
to push for more control over project 
construction to be given to local water 
agencies; more up-front inclusion of 
Tribes so we can avoid ruining their 
cultural and burial sites, literally 
crushing skulls while working on lev-
ees—this is about basic respect; and for 
the Army Corps and EPA to work with 
our constituents, rather than against 
them, such as penalties for when farm-
ers plow their fields or change crops. 
Indeed, we need to keep this con-
versation going, but I appreciate the 
legislation and the direction we are 
going. 
Mr. DEFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. GRAVES of Missouri. Mr. Speak-
er, I yield myself the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. Speaker, H.R. 7776, or WRDA 
2022, is a very good bipartisan piece of 
legislation that will improve flood con-
trol infrastructure. It is going to im-
prove ports, harbors, and inland water-
ways all across the country. 
This bill provides the support and the 
investment in our country’s water in-
frastructure needed to keep our supply 
chain moving and boost the competi-
tiveness of the American economy. 
When it comes right down to it, this 
bill is a projects bill that was pulled to-
gether based off requests from Mem-
bers from all across the country in the 
House on both sides of the aisle, and 
there isn’t a single line in this bill that 
cannot be attributed to an individual 
Member request. 
I again thank my colleagues and the 
members of the committee for coming 
together to develop this bipartisan leg-
islation. Again, I thank the chairman 
for his work. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge support of this 
important piece of legislation, and I 
yield back the balance of my time. 
Mr. DEFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself the balance of my time. 
Most of what we do here would not be 
possible without the hard work of staff, 
so I would like to take a moment spe-
cifically to thank the staff of the Sub-
committee on Water Resources and En-
vironment that took the lead in devel-
oping WRDA 2022 and ensuring that 
Members’ priorities and national prior-
ities were included: Ryan Seiger, the 
staff director of the subcommittee, who 
worked to enact more of WRDA than 
any other staffer on Capitol Hill; Alexa 
Williams; 
Logan 
Ferree; 
Michael 
Bauman. On the minority side: Ryan 
Hambleton, the minority staff director; 
Leslie Parker; Tim Petty; and Melissa 
Beaumont. Without them and their 
work, we would not be here today. 
Paul Sass has already been thanked a 
number of times, but I congratulate 
him on his 20 years on the Hill and 
wish him well in his next endeavor. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge support, and I 
yield back the balance of my time. 
Ms. JOHNSON of Texas. Madam Speaker, 
nearly 80 percent of our traded goods rely on 
American ports, harbors, and inland water-
ways to reach consumers. 
Therefore, it is incumbent upon us to sup-
port our waterways and ecosystems, improve 
our defenses against floods and extreme 
weather, and create good-paying jobs along 
the way—and that’s what the Water Re-
sources Development Act of 2022 (WRDA) will 
do. 
Specifically, this bill authorizes the construc-
tion of 16 new projects and 72 feasibility stud-
ies approved by the Corps of Engineers and 
expedites the completion of 15 ongoing inves-
tigations. The bill also includes a water re-
source initiative that is very important to my 
constituents and the many residents of North 
Texas. 
The White Rock Lake is a 1,015-acre city 
lake located outside of Dallas. The lake is one 
of the most heavily-used parks in the Dallas 
Parks system. It is home to the Dallas Arbo-
retum, the White Rock Lake Museum, the 
Bath House Cultural Center, a large boat ramp 
and fishing pier, over nine miles of hiking and 
biking trails, a dog park, a picnic area, and pa-
vilions. White Rock Lake has experienced an 
accumulation of sediment since it was last 
dredged in 1998, reducing the overall capacity 
of the lake, with reductions in both its water 
quality and recreational use. And with the pan-
demic increasing the already heavy usage rate 
of the lake, the need to dredge it has never 
been more urgent. 
The goals of the White Rock Lake dredging 
project included in the WRDA are to remove 
sediment from the shoreline to improve main-
tenance, improve water quality to minimize 
negative impacts to aquatic habitat and other 
environmentally sensitive areas, and restore 
the depth of the lake to enhance watersport 
recreation. 
The bill also authorizes $19.2 billion in fund-
ing to restore and protect Texas’ coastline. 
The project is one of the largest in the history 
of the Corps of Engineers and includes im-
provements that reduce risks to public health 
and the economy, restore critical ecosystems, 
advance coastal resiliency, and help prepare 
the state for future damaging weather events. 
I want to commend Chairman DEFAZIO and 
Subcommittee Chairwoman NAPOLITANO
for 
their perseverance in developing this bipar-
tisan bill and getting it to the House floor for 
a vote. 
I strongly support the passage of the Water 
Resources Development Act of 2022 and en-
courage my colleagues to pass a bill that is 
essential to America’s economic competitive-
ness and helps improve the quality of our wa-
terways for all our constituents.

rules and pass the bill, H.R. 7776, as

Capitol Grounds, with respect to the event. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from Or-
egon (Mr. DEFAZIO) and the gentleman 
from Missouri (Mr. GRAVES) each will 
control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from Oregon (Mr. DEFAZIO). 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. DEFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days in which to 
revise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on H. Con. 
Res. 88. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Oregon? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. DEFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, today, we are again 
considering legislation, H. Con. Res. 88, 
to authorize the use of the Capitol 
Grounds for the Greater Washington 
Soap Box Derby. I thank Majority 
Leader HOYER for introducing this res-
olution on behalf of the Washington re-
gional delegation. 
The Greater Washington Soap Box 
Derby is an annual competitive event 
that encourages boys and girls, ages 9 
through 16, to construct and race their 
own soap box vehicles. 
On Capitol Hill, the event has become 
a great tradition in the Washington, 
D.C., metropolitan area over the last 
quarter of a century. It provides a ter-
rific opportunity for children to appre-
ciate the workmanship necessary to 
build the vehicles and enjoy the thrill 
of competition. 
The Greater Washington Soap Box 
Derby organizers will work with the 
Architect of the Capitol and the Cap-
itol Police to ensure appropriate rules 
and regulations are in place and the 
event remains free to the public and 
safe for all those involved. 
Mr. Speaker, I support this legisla-
tion and urge my colleagues to join me. 
I reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. GRAVES of Missouri. Mr. Speak-
er, I yield myself such time as I may 
consume. 
Mr. Speaker, this resolution, as has 
been pointed out, authorizes the use of 
the Capitol Grounds for the annual 
Greater Washington Soap Box Derby 
on June 18, 2022. 
This is a time-honored tradition. 
With the exception of World War II, it 
has run every year since 1934 and pro-
vides children in the greater Wash-
ington area an opportunity to build 
knowledge and character through fair 
and honest competition. 
This is one of the many regional 
competitions across the country to 
qualify children to compete in the All- 
American Soap Box Derby. This is a 
program I participated in some 40-odd 
years ago. It is a good program, and I 
fully endorse it. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge support of the 
legislation, and I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. DEFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from Mary-
land (Mr. HOYER), the majority leader 
and sponsor of this legislation. 
Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the chair and the ranking member for 
bringing this bill to the floor. 
I am honored to bring this resolution 
to the floor every year. It authorizes 
an event, as you have been told, that I 
am proud to support every year. This 
will be the first time it has been held 
since 2019 because of the pandemic. 
That event is the Greater Wash-
ington Soap Box Derby, one of my fa-
vorite events of the year. The Soap Box 
Derby brings families together from 
across the greater Washington metro-
politan area, encouraging kids and 
their adult family members or commu-
nity members to compete in a fun and 
educational race. 
This is my 29th year sponsoring the 
Soap Box Derby resolution. I don’t 
know whether that is a record on the 
Soap Box Derby, but in any event, this 
is the Greater Washington Soap Box 
Derby’s 79th year. 
The race will be held on June 18, and 
you will see soap box racers from ages 
8 to 17 compete in three divisions: 
stock, super stock, and masters. The 
winner from each division, Mr. Speak-
er, will have a chance to compete at 
the national All-American Soap Box 
Derby, which is held each year in 
Akron, Ohio. 
Much of the fun, however, takes 
place even before the race begins. Par-
ticipants spend weeks, perhaps months, 
building and testing their racers at 
home, a wonderful bonding experience 
for kids, parents, grandparents, and 
other family members and those en-
gaged in mentorship in their commu-
nities. 
Soap box derbies have been called the 
greatest amateur racing event in the 
world. They have become a staple of 
the American experience and an impor-
tant piece of Americana. They teach 
sportsmanship, engineering, manufac-
turing, and leadership. 
Oftentimes, racers are sponsored by 
local civic groups, service organiza-
tions, and police or fire departments, 
with members coming out to cheer on 
their hometown participants. 
Mr. Speaker, I am proud to sponsor 
this resolution today that will author-
ize the use of the Grounds of the U.S. 
Capitol for this year’s Soap Box Derby. 
I thank my cosponsors, members of 
the region’s congressional delegation: 
Representatives 
DON
BEYER, 
DAVID 
TRONE, 
GERRY
CONNOLLY, 
ANTHONY 
BROWN, JENNIFER WEXTON, and JAMIE 
RASKIN. 
I am also proud that several Greater 
Washington Soap Box Derby champions 
have come from Maryland’s Fifth Dis-
trict, my district, in recent years, in-
cluding the winners from 2007, 2008, 
2009, 2012, 2013, 2014, and 2018. So my 
guys do pretty well in this race, and 
some of them are gals, by the way. 
Our racers even won a national 
championship in 2007 and 2008. I am ex-
cited to see how the Fifth District rac-
ers do this year, and I am looking for-
ward to seeing their colorful and cre-
ative soap box designs. 
I thank the organizers of the Greater 
Washington Soap Box Derby, as well as 
Chairman DEFAZIO and the Committee 
on Transportation and Infrastructure, 
for their support. I hope every Member, 
as they have in the past, will join in 
supporting this resolution. I invite 
them to join me in cheering on the 
Greater Washington Soap Box Derby 
on June 18. 
Mr. GRAVES of Missouri. Mr. Speak-
er, this resolution authorizes the use of 
the Capitol Grounds for a longstanding 
tradition for the children of the greater 
Washington, D.C., area. 
Once in a while, we do some fun stuff 
here on the floor, and this is one of 
those things. I urge support of the leg-
islation, and I yield back the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. DEFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself the balance of my time. 
Again, I thank the majority leader 
for 
bringing 
this 
legislation. 
I 
misspoke earlier. I thought it had only 
been a quarter of a century. It has been 
29 years. 
That is extraordinary, and this is a 
wonderful event for youth. It does 
bring a little something to Capitol Hill 
other than the day-to-day business, 
which can sometimes be suffocating. 
I urge my colleagues to support this 
legislation unanimously, and I yield 
back the balance of my time. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in 
strong support of H. Con. Res. 88, ‘‘author-
izing the use of Capitol grounds for the Great-
er Washington Soap Box Derby.’’ 
This bill calls for support to hold the tradi-
tional Soap Box Derby association’s free, pub-
lic event on the Capitol grounds. 
The Soap Box Derby international nonprofit 
organization, whose mission is to ‘‘build knowl-
edge and character, and to create meaningful 
experiences through collaboration and fair and 
honest competition,’’ prides itself for allowing 
the race to take place on the most powerful 
hill in the world, Capitol Hill. 
For 88 years, this event has been an oppor-
tunity in which the community comes out to 
support our youth. Annually, our youth get the 
opportunity to participate in the international 
nonprofit’s biggest event. 
Participants who compete range from ages 
9–16 years old and come from the Greater 
Washington, D.C. Metropolitan Area. They 
could potentially have the honor of rep-
resenting D.C. in the National Soap Box Derby 
competition.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5298 
June 7, 2022 
This completely sponsored soap box derby 
event will be free of charge for the public and 
has a flexible date that will ensure it does not 
interfere with the needs of Congress. 
In Texas, anytime we can celebrate our 
youth and their accomplishments, while also 
bringing the community together, it is an op-
portunity fellowship and relationships through 
friendly competition. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join 
me in supporting H. Con. Res. 88, to host the 
traditional, Greater Washington Soap Box 
Derby on our nation’s Capitol grounds, an 
event that will bring the community together 
for a wonderful celebration. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. DEFA-
ZIO) that the House suspend the rules 
and agree to the concurrent resolution, 
H. Con. Res 88. 
The question was taken; and (two- 
thirds being in the affirmative) the 
rules were suspended and the concur-
rent resolution was agreed to. 
A motion to reconsider was laid on 
the table.

ties described in that notice and, as feasible, 
additional activities that are also directly 
related to the direct review of biosimilar bio-
logical product applications and supple-
ments, including additional formal meeting 
types, the direct review of postmarketing 
commitments and requirements, the direct 
review of risk evaluation and mitigation 
strategies, and the direct review of annual 
reports for approved biosimilar biological 
products. Subject to the exceptions in the 
preceding sentence, the Secretary shall not 
include as workload categories in applying

core review activities, including those ac-
tivities that the Secretary referenced for po-
tential future use in such notice but did not 
utilize in setting fees for fiscal year 2021.

paragraph result in fee revenue for a fiscal 
year that is less than the sum of the 
amounts under subsections (b)(1)(A) (the an-
nual base revenue for the fiscal year), 
(b)(1)(B) (the dollar amount of the inflation 
adjustment for the fiscal year), and (b)(1)(C)

Register notice under paragraph (5) the fee 
revenue and fees resulting from the adjust-
ment and the methodologies under this para-
graph.

‘‘(A) INCREASE.—For fiscal year 2023 and 
subsequent fiscal years, the Secretary shall, 
in addition to adjustments under paragraphs 
(1), (2), and (3), further increase the fee rev-
enue and fees if such an adjustment is nec-
essary to provide for at least 10 weeks of op-
erating reserves of carryover user fees for

retary shall decrease such fee revenue and 
fees to provide for not more than 21 weeks of 
such operating reserves.

crease or decrease in fee revenue and fees 
shall be contained in the annual Federal 
Register notice under paragraph (5)(B) estab-

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from 
New Jersey (Mr. PALLONE) and the gen-
tleman from Kentucky (Mr. GUTHRIE) 
each will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from New Jersey. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days in which to 
revise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on H.R. 7667. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from New Jersey? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong 
support of the Food and Drug Amend-
ments of 2022, a bill that recently 
passed out of the Energy and Com-
merce Committee with unanimous sup-
port. This bill will provide the FDA the 
funding it needs to ensure drugs and 
devices are safe and effective. It also 
promotes development of new medical 
products to treat every American, re-
duces the cost of prescription drugs, 
and strengthens program integrity at 
the agency. 
Primarily, the user fee reauthoriza-
tion’s main purpose is to give the agen-
cy funding to conduct product reviews, 
facilitate the development of new prod-
ucts to treat rare diseases, inspect fa-
cilities to ensure they are compliant, 
and monitor medical products on the 
market for continued safety and effec-
tiveness. 
It is essential that the House pass 
this legislation today because funding 
that comes from these user fees expires 
in September. At hearings earlier this 
year, senior FDA officials told us that 
failure to pass this legislation well be-
fore the September deadline could be 
catastrophic to the agency’s operations 
and, more importantly, could limit our 
ability to get patients the medical 
products that they and their doctors 
rely on. 
Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased that 
in addition to coming together to reau-
thorize this funding, we have worked 
across the aisle to come to agreement 
on a wide-ranging package of programs 
to improve biomedical research and de-
velopment, give FDA more tools to 
conduct quality inspections, improve 
the medical product supply chain, im-
prove generic drug competition and ac-
cess, and bring greater transparency 
and program integrity to FDA’s oper-
ations. 
While I do not have time to discuss 
all the provisions in the Food and Drug 
Amendments of 2022, I want to high-
light a few. 
First, the bill includes reforms to the 
accelerated approval program, which I 
first introduced in Congress earlier this 
year. Under the accelerated approval 
pathway, drugs may be approved based 
on a surrogate endpoint, such as an im-
proved lab measurement or visualiza-
tion on an MRI, even though additional 
evidence is still needed to show a clear 
clinical benefit for the patient. If a 
drug is approved under this pathway, 
the sponsor must conduct studies after 
the product is on the market to show 
that the drug actually provides a ben-
efit to patients. This approval pathway 
has led to patients having access to 
groundbreaking treatments for cancer, 
HIV, and other illnesses faster than 
they otherwise would have. 
However, in recent years, it has be-
come clear that some drug sponsors 
have failed to conduct their post-ap-
proval studies in a timely manner, 
while others have conducted studies 
that indicate that the drug is not effec-
tive but are able to keep the product 
on the market for years afterwards. 
Patients deserve to know the drugs 
they are taking are safe and effective. 
Food and Drug Amendments of 2022 en-
sures that the products patients are 
taking are providing a benefit by al-
lowing FDA to require that sponsors 
begin 
adequate 
and 
well-controlled 
post-approval studies before the drug 
goes on the market. The legislation 
will provide greater transparency in 
drug labeling, and it streamlines the 
process for FDA to remove products 
from the market when the sponsors 
have failed to act with due diligence to 
conduct studies or where studies have 
failed to show a benefit to patients. 
The second thing is, this legislation 
ensures that clinical trials for drugs 
and medical devices are representative 
of the people who will use the products. 
The lack of diversity in clinical trials 
is an urgent problem. It compromises 
our ability to understand how drugs 
and diseases affect populations dif-
ferently, compounds health disparities, 
and can hinder innovation and add cost 
burdens into the health system. 
Food and Drug Amendments of 2022 
for the first time will require drug and 
device sponsors to develop a clinical 
trial diversity action plan early in the 
development process and submit the 
plan to FDA. This will help improve 
our understanding of these products 
and lead to better outcomes for all 
Americans. 
Food and Drug Amendments of 2022 
will also help lower drug costs by mak-
ing it easier for generic products to 
come to market. Under current law, ge-
neric drug sponsors sometimes need to 
play a guessing game of the ingredients 
in brand drugs, and this can add 
months on to the generic drug develop-
ment process. Under Food and Drug 
Amendments of 2022, we are making it 
easier for FDA to communicate this in-
formation to drug sponsors, thereby 
speeding up development times for 
generics. The bill will also make it 
easier for generics to come to market 
when a brand drug changes its label at 
the last second in an attempt to limit 
competition. Together, these provi-
sions will produce millions of dollars in 
savings for American families and the 
overall healthcare system. 
This legislation also takes concrete 
action to address the infant formula 
crisis American families are currently 
facing, and which we are so concerned 
about, and will prevent future prob-
lems related to food safety and supply, 
so it’s not just about infant formula, 
but about food safety in general. 
Currently, FDA is operating its food 
safety and other divisions with one

hand tied behind its back when it 
comes to hiring and retaining highly 
qualified 
scientific 
and 
regulatory 
staff. Today, FDA can hire technical 
staff in its drug and medical device 
centers under streamlined processes 
and compete with the private sector in 
terms of salary, but those same flexi-
bilities do not extend to other centers, 
including those overseeing food at the 
FDA. Our bill would extend these to 
the oversight of food, tobacco, and 
other products regulated by the agen-
cy. While we must do more in this area, 
I am pleased that we are able to move 
forward on a bipartisan basis here 
today. I think it is going to make a dif-
ference, Mr. Speaker, not only with in-
fant formula but with so many other 
food products. 
Lastly, Mr. Speaker, I thank my col-
leagues on the Energy and Commerce 
Committee for their cooperation and 
bipartisan work on this package. As I 
said, it passed unanimously out of the 
committee last month, thanks to the 
leadership of Health Subcommittee 
Chairwoman ESHOO, Ranking Member 
GUTHRIE, and the full committee Rank-
ing Member RODGERS. 
When you bring a bill to the floor on 
suspension and it is bipartisan, and it 
was voted out of committee unani-
mously, it might kind of belie the 
amount of work that the staff who are 
here with me today and others put into 
this. This was a lot of work. It wasn’t 
easy to get it done in a timely fashion, 
even though it has unanimous support. 
I hope today everyone will vote for it; 
I do not want anyone to get the im-
pression that this was not an easy 
thing to accomplish because it cer-
tainly was. 
Mr. Speaker, I encourage all Mem-
bers to support this bill, and I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. GUTHRIE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support 
of the Food and Drug Amendments of 
2022, introduced by Chair ESHOO and 
myself. 
This 
legislation 
recently 
passed the full Energy and Commerce 
Committee unanimously. 
The bill will protect access to life-
saving cures, promote innovation, se-
cure our medical supply chains, and 
lower costs for patients. It would also 
reauthorize the Food and Drug Admin-
istration’s medical product user fee 
programs through 2027. 
User fees allow the FDA to collect 
fees from industry in exchange for 
timely review of their drug or device 
applications. Importantly, these fees 
not only permit the FDA to carry out 
drug or device application reviews, but 
they also represent significant percent-
ages of FDA’s total operating budget 
without costing the taxpayer. 
Additionally, according to the Con-
gressional Budget Office, sections of 
the bill will save close to $600 million 
by promoting increased access to ge-
neric drugs. Some of these savings will 
be used for deficit reduction and other 
amounts can be put toward preserving 
access to critical services in the Med-
icaid program, such as telehealth. 
Not only do these agreements help 
save taxpayer dollars, but they also 
yield significant returns on investment 
since they were originally authorized 
by Congress decades ago. For example, 
in 2021 alone, 38 of 50 of the world’s 
novel drugs were first approved in the 
United States. This was made possible 
by the Food and Drug Administration 
Amendments of 2017. 
I am proud to say that the legislation 
includes two of my bills, the Pre-ap-
proval 
Information 
Exchange 
Act, 
which will help reduce the time in 
which patients wait for a drug or a de-
vice to be covered by the insurer after 
it is approved by the FDA. 
The bill before us today also includes 
legislation that Chair PALLONE and I 
have been championing for several 
years to help facilitate the trans-
formation of drug manufacturing proc-
esses, so they are more efficient, less 
costly, and result in improved drug 
quality. The use of continuous manu-
facturing technology will not only 
serve as an incentive for U.S. drug 
manufacturers to bring their produc-
tion back to American soil but will 
also help reduce drug shortages. 
Other important components of the 
Food and Drug Amendments of 2022 re-
quire guidance on the collection of 
real-world evidence for companies with 
products authorized under emergency 
use authorization during the COVID–19 
public health emergency. This can 
serve as a strong foundation for the 
regulatory community in addition to 
drug or device companies to best un-
derstand how products can get ap-
proved more quickly and safely in the 
future. 
Finally, the Food and Drug Amend-
ments of 2022 preserves access to life-
saving therapies approved under the 
accelerated approval pathway. By pre-
serving the pathway, we are giving pa-
tients hope to one day find cures to 
currently incurable diseases, such as 
Alzheimer’s disease or terminal can-
cers. 
As the Chair said, usually when you 
come to the floor on suspension bills, 
they are ones that have great unani-
mous consent with Congress. This has 
gone through the regular process, and 
it has gone through a lot of hard work 
by Members, but I have to say a lot of 
hard work, significant hard work, by 
the men and women who work with us 
here on the committee. We really ap-
preciate the staff’s hard work. 
Although we are here in a suspension 
moment on the floor, I emphasize to 
my colleagues, there has been a lot of 
work, a lot of committee work, a lot of 
subcommittee work, a lot of Member 
work, and a whole lot of staff work to 
make this move forward. I really ap-
preciate that. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support this legislation today, and I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I have 
no additional speakers at this time. I 
continue to reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. GUTHRIE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 
minutes to the gentleman from Indiana 
(Mr. BUCSHON). 
Mr. BUCSHON. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today in support of the bipartisan Food 
and Drug Amendments of 2022. 
This is an important reauthorization 
that is necessary to help drive innova-
tion and make sure patients have con-
tinued access to critical treatments 
and cures. 
I am pleased to see the continued 
focus on innovation this agreement 
brings, as well as its included policies 
like the DIVERSE Trials Act, which I 
helped author, which will help increase 
diverse participation in clinical trials. 
More can be done to protect patients. 
One example being diagnostic testing, 
specifically lab-developed tests. 
For well over 5 years, I have been 
working on the bipartisan VALID Act, 
H.R. 4128, with my colleague DIANA 
DEGETTE, which establishes a risk- 
based regulatory framework for diag-
nostic and laboratory-developed tests. 
This legislation allows for leading- 
edge development and innovation to 
thrive while assuring doctors and pa-
tients have the certainty that their 
test results are analytically and clini-
cally valid. The draft version of the 
user fee agreements introduced in the 
Senate addresses the issue by including 
a version of the VALID Act. 
Mr. Speaker, I again express my 
strong support for the Food and Drug 
Amendments Act of 2022, and I urge my 
colleagues to vote ‘‘yes’’ on this legis-
lation. 
b 1830 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. GUTHRIE. Mr. Speaker, I was in-
correct. 
I 
said 
Mr. 
BUCSHON. 
Dr. 
BUCSHON; his words on healthcare are 
certainly very important to all of us. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the 
gentlewoman from Washington (Mrs. 
RODGERS), my good friend, the Repub-
lican leader of the full Committee on 
Energy and Commerce. 
Mrs. RODGERS of Washington. Mr. 
Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 
7667, the Food and Drug Amendments 
Act. 
The Committee on Energy and Com-
merce plowed the hard ground nec-
essary to legislate in a strong bipar-
tisan way on this bill. We held three 
hearings 
in 
the 
Subcommittee 
on 
Health in February and March. In 
April, we introduced legislation, and 
then over the next week, the sub-
committee voted. 
H.R. 7667 passed out of Committee on 
Energy and Commerce by a vote of 55– 
0, and at each step, members’ ideas 
were included to improve the legisla-
tion. 
Today, we consider a suspension 
print with further improvements. It 
adds another provision for more drug 
manufacturing in America by pro-
viding the regulatory clarity needed

and the training necessary to utilize 
novel manufacturing technologies. 
Overall, the FDA Act will reauthor-
ize four user fee programs created to 
expedite the review of critical medical 
products that people depend on to live 
healthier and longer lives. 
In addition to delivering drugs and 
medical devices to people faster, the 
FDA Act includes policies to lower 
healthcare costs, spur more lifesaving 
innovation, secure our supply chains, 
and provide hope to patients in need of 
breakthrough 
drugs 
and 
therapies. 
Those treatments won’t make it to pa-
tients if FDA doesn’t have the right 
tools to keep up with science, such as 
accelerated approval pathway. 
Chairman PALLONE
and I initially 
had quite different versions for how the 
accelerated approval process should be 
updated, but we focused on where we 
could agree. We streamlined the proc-
ess to remove drugs that no longer 
show effectiveness in post-market stud-
ies and made sure that real-world evi-
dence can be used. We also made sure 
rare diseases aren’t left out of acceler-
ated approval because of a lack of 
knowledge and interest in developing 
the biomarkers necessary. 
Lastly, not only is this legislation 
necessary to preserve patient access to 
new medical breakthroughs, it is fis-
cally responsible. It ensures FDA’s 
timely review of medical products at a 
reduced cost to the taxpayer, and it re-
duces the deficit. 
Many other members have priorities 
included in this legislation. 
Mr. BUCHANAN has a bipartisan bill to 
make sure that we are moving away 
from preclinical testing on animal 
models where alternatives can work 
just as well. 
Messrs. GRIFFITH, CARTER, and HUD-
SON all have legislation to hold FDA 
accountable regarding inspections of 
foreign manufacturing facilities and pi-
lots for FDA to give companies with 
novel 
manufacturing 
technologies 
more certainty. 
Mr. GUTHRIE has a solution included 
to help insurers plan for breakthrough 
future treatments. This will help pa-
tients avoid sticker shock and protect 
earlier access to those treatments. 
These are just some of more than a 
dozen examples of member priorities in 
the FDA Act. I strongly urge support of 
this legislation, and I encourage all of 
my colleagues to vote ‘‘yes.’’ 
Mr. Speaker, this is for patients and 
families in every district and every 
corner of America who are relying on a 
generic drug, a medical device, like a 
pacemaker, or a novel cancer treat-
ment. Those patients are relying on 
Congress to do its job so their drug ap-
proval isn’t stalled. 
I think about all the advocates, the 
hundreds of disease and rare disease 
groups who come to the people’s House 
to share their stories with us. They 
have an extraordinary amount of hope 
in the promise of American innovation 
for new cures and access to treatments. 
For them, I am supporting this legis-
lation, and I am committed to work to 
get this signed into law on time. 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I am 
prepared to close, and I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. GUTHRIE. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, through the years, 
since this medical device fee has been 
put into place, has Congress taken ac-
tion to make sure an agency is effi-
cient; that it does its job to make sure 
that our drugs and medical devices 
have efficacy, but also are safe? So we 
make them more efficient and we have 
drug 
companies, 
device 
companies, 
other companies, generic companies, 
trying to get their devices or their 
pharmaceuticals approved so they can 
bring them on the marketplace that 
are safe and efficient. So this is really 
an example of Congress working to-
gether to move this process forward. 
And the innovations that have come 
out in the last few years, if we look at 
what has gone on in the diabetes world 
with the artificial pancreas, all the 
pumps and insulin devices, to hepatitis 
C, pharmaceuticals and other ways, 
and just so much more, what is going 
to happen in the next 5 years as we 
continue to move this process forward? 
We had a hearing in the Sub-
committee on Health on ALS, and we 
had an ALS patient before us who just 
wants hope. So all of that is accounted 
for in this process. 
We, as Members of Congress, we, as 
members of the Committee on Energy 
and Commerce have worked together 
to make the process streamlined, to 
make sure we have efficient, efficacy, 
and safe products. Our hope and our 
prayers from this is the science will 
come into place so those who testified 
before our committee with rare dis-
eases will have the opportunity and 
hope to be healed. 
I urge my colleagues to support this 
piece of legislation. A lot of hard work 
went into it. A lot of lives can be af-
fected by it. I encourage everyone to 
vote for it. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, I couldn’t agree 
more with what Ranking Member 
GUTHRIE said, and also our full com-
mittee ranking member, Mrs. RODGERS. 
This is a product of a lot of hard work 
on behalf of members, as well as the 
staff that are here, and others. It is 
really great that we are able to do it in 
a timely fashion because we want the 
FDA to be able to operate, not to have 
to put out pink slips because the au-
thorization expires in September. 
This is really a reauthorization that 
does a lot more than just reauthorize 
the current programs. It really is going 
to make a difference in terms of our 
ability to innovate and also affect ac-
cess to generic drugs. 
Madam Speaker, I encourage all 
Members to support the bill. We are 
going to work hard to get this passed 
in the Senate in a timely fashion. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Ms. PIN-
GREE). The question is on the motion 
offered by the gentleman from New 
Jersey (Mr. PALLONE) that the House 
suspend the rules and pass the bill, 
H.R. 7667, as amended. 
The question was taken. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the 
opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being 
in the affirmative, the ayes have it. 
Mr. HARRIS. Madam Speaker, on 
that I demand the yeas and nays. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to section 3(s) of House Resolution 
8, the yeas and nays are ordered. 
Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, fur-
ther proceedings on this motion are 
postponed.

MOMENT OF SILENCE TO HONOR 
THE VICTIMS OF THE UVALDE 
SHOOTING 
(Mr. TONY GONZALES of Texas 
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute.) 
Mr. TONY GONZALES of Texas. 
Madam Speaker, on May 24, 2022, 19 
children and 2 teachers were killed by 
a gunman at Robb Elementary School 
in Uvalde, Texas, my district but a re-
flection of every small town in Amer-
ica. 
As I rise today with my fellow Tex-
ans to honor the victims, I am re-
minded of Matthew 5:4, ‘‘Blessed are 
those who mourn, for they shall be 
comforted.’’ 
I mourn with the Uvalde community 
and pray for healing and comfort for 
the families and the community for the 
loss of: 
Alexandria Rubio; 
Alithia Ramirez; 
Amerie Garza; 
Annabelle Rodriguez; 
Eliahana Torres; 
Eliahna Garcia; 
Jacklyn Cazares; 
Jailah Silguero; 
Jayce Luevanos; 
Jose Flores, Jr.; 
Layla Salazar; 
Makenna Elrod; 
Maite Rodriguez, 
Maranda Mathis; 
Nevaeh Bravo; 
Rojelio Torres; 
Tess Mata; 
Uziyah Garcia; 
Xavier Lopez; 
Eva Mireles; and 
Irma Garcia. 
These were our daughters, sons, sis-
ters, brothers, and mothers who have 
become innocent victims of senseless 
violence. 
Please join us in a moment of silence 
to honor the victims. 
May they rest in peace, and may they 
always be remembered. 
The SPEAKER. The Chair asks all 
Members in the Chamber, as well as 
Members and staff throughout the Cap-
itol, to rise for a moment of silence in 
remembrance of the victims of the re-
cent shootings at Robb Elementary 
School in Uvalde, Texas.

HONORING THE LIFE OF 
CONGRESSMAN JOHN COOKSEY 
(Ms. LETLOW asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Ms. LETLOW. Madam Speaker, on 
Saturday, we lost Congressman John 
Cooksey, a former Member of this body 
and an outstanding American who 
dedicated his life to serving his coun-
try and improving the lives of others. 
John Cooksey was born in Alexan-
dria, Louisiana in 1941, and grew up 
near his father’s sawmill in rural La-
Salle Parish. He attended LSU and 
LSU Medical School and became an 
ophthalmologist. His love for prac-
ticing medicine ran so deep that he 
continued to treat patients for nearly 
50 years. 
Madam Speaker, just yesterday, I 
heard the story of a World War II vet-
eran whose vision had become distorted 
because of his combat injuries. Dr. 
Cooksey treated him, restored the 
man’s vision, and performed the entire 
surgery free of charge. 
Dr. Cooksey also served as a medical 
missionary to Africa, volunteering his 
time and skills to treat those des-
perately in need of medical care. He 
was so moved by his experiences there 
that he returned home and personally 
led the fundraising drive to build a 
modern eye clinic in Kenya. 
Dr. Cooksey had a dedication to serv-
ing others and a deep commitment to 
serving our country. He was a pilot in 
the Air Force and flew missions during 
the Vietnam War. 
In 1996, Dr. Cooksey was elected to 
serve the people of Louisiana’s Fifth 
Congressional District here in the 
House of Representatives. Throughout 
his three terms, he was known for de-
livering 
results 
that 
were 
trans-
formational for our region and always 
going above and beyond to help his 
constituents. 
On a personal level, I will always be 
grateful to John Cooksey for giving my 
late husband, Luke, his start in poli-
tics, instilling a love for the work of 
this Congress in an eager young boy 
from Start, Louisiana. For me, he was 
more than a predecessor, he was a 
trusted mentor, a confidant, and a 
friend.

June 7, 2022 
Madam Speaker, we have lost a dedi-
cated public servant who was an out-
standing Member of this body. In his 
memory, I ask all Members in the 
Chamber to join me in observing a mo-
ment of silence as we honor the incred-
ible life and remarkable accomplish-
ments of Congressman John Cooksey.

HONORING THE SERVICE OF MRS. 
DEANNA DELUNA 
(Mrs. 
CHERFILUS-MCCORMICK 
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute.) 
Mrs. 
CHERFILUS-MCCORMICK. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today to extend 
our eternal gratitude to Mrs. DeAnna 
Deluna for her dedication to our Na-
tion’s children as a 16-year educator for 
our South Florida community. 
She is known to go above and beyond 
to support struggling children and to 
provide everyone, from every back-
ground, with a quality education. 
Education is the one field that makes 
all others possible. Every one of us has 
been shaped by someone who inspired 
our curiosity and helped us find our 
confidence. 
We are inspired by Mrs. Deluna and 
are thankful for her service to our chil-
dren and her dedication to the Broward 
County School District.

CONGRATULATING PAT PECORA 
(Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania 
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend his remarks.) 
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today to con-
gratulate Pat Pecora, Pitt-Johnstown’s 
wrestling coach, on his fourth NCAA 
Division II National Wrestling Coach of 
the Year Award. 
This award is presented to the coach 
who has demonstrated outstanding ef-
fort throughout the season in devel-
oping and elevating their program on 
campus and in the community. Pat has 
previously received this award in 1995, 
1999, and 2019 for his efforts at Pitt- 
Johnstown. 
This season, Pat led the Mountain 
Cats to a 13–1 dual-meet record and the 
program’s 24th NCAA regional title. 
This year’s team won a share of the 
PSAC dual-meet title for their sixth 
straight conference championship. 
This recognition is well-deserved for 
Pat; and he is the all-time winningest 
coach in college wrestling at all divi-
sions of the NCAA. In his 46 years at 
Pitt-Johnstown, he has recorded 631 
victories. 
Madam Speaker, Pat is an incredible 
coach and a great role model for the 
Pitt-Johnstown community. 
Congratulations again on this well- 
deserved recognition and award. 
Go Mountain Cats.

HONORING THE LIFE OF PAULINO 
VILLARREAL, SR. 
(Mr. GARCI´A of Illinois asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute.) 
Mr. 
GARCI´A 
of 
Illinois. 
Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to honor the life 
of Paulino Villarreal, Sr. 
Paulino was a longtime city worker, 
community volunteer, loving father, 
and a longtime Pilsen resident. He saw 
the children of his neighborhood as an 
extension of his own, holding toy and 
school supply drives to help them. 
Paulino represented what the south-
west side of Chicago is all about; hard 
work, humility, and service to family 
and community. 
Paulino left us with an important 
lesson: The people we help, the helping 
hand we extend, is the legacy we leave 
behind. 
Family and friends will remember 
him for his cheerful outlook on life, his 
love for the Cowboys, and Tejano 
music. Above all, Paulino will be re-
membered for his generosity and his 
love of service. 
I express my deepest condolences to 
the Villarreal family. 
Rest in peace, my friend. 
f 
PRESIDENT BIDEN SIMPLY MUST 
DO BETTER 
(Mr. ROSE asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. ROSE. Madam Speaker, the aver-
age price of gasoline has more than 
doubled since President Biden was 
sworn into office. That is not a coinci-
dence. After all, before he took office, 
he told us he would ‘‘end fossil fuel.’’ 
Now, Americans are finding out the 
hard way what happens when we elect 
a President that wants to end fossil 
fuels. The cost of living rises faster 
than we can keep up with because al-
most everything we wear, eat, and use 
is transported using fossil fuels. 
Meanwhile, yesterday, the President 
announced he would be invoking the 
Defense Production Act to make more 
solar panels. Give me a break. 
The President needs to concede his 
war against American energy and allow 
companies to drill and explore for new 
oil. It is that easy. Yet, he refuses. 
President Biden simply must do bet-
ter. 
f 
SOLAR TARIFF SUSPENSION 
(Ms. KAPTUR asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Ms. KAPTUR. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to call out China for its long his-
tory of predatory dumping and tariff 
avoidance. 
We have seen China cheat on this 
game before on everything from steel 
to autos to solar. It hurts American 
workers and American companies that 
I represent in Ohio. 
China is a nation that does not abide 
by global trading rules. Fair trading 
nations must apply strict scrutiny and 
appropriate penalties in response. 
I welcome the administration’s focus 
on boosting manufacturing of critical 
solar components here in America. But 
we cannot encourage a tilting of the 
playing field that favors a country 
whose sinister trade practices have 
crushed the American middle class. 
Ohio’s workers make and build the 
products that make and build America. 
Our Nation must respect them, as well 
as the innovative companies that are 
working to deliver America’s energy 
independence in perpetuity. 
Let’s champion free trade among free 
people. 
f 
AMERICANS ARE LOSING THEIR 
COOL 
(Mr. MEUSER asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. MEUSER. Madam Speaker, as 
Americans 
struggle 
to 
afford 
the 
record-high price of gas and the cost to 
keep their homes comfortable this 
summer, they are losing their cool 
with President Biden’s attempts to de-
velop a plan to tame skyrocketing in-
flation while playing the blame game. 
Harry Truman said and was known 
for ‘‘the buck stops here.’’ The Biden 
mantra seems to be ‘‘pass the buck.’’ 
While the President puts the blame 
on the Federal Reserve for inflation 
and taps the Strategic Petroleum Re-
serve to provide a few pennies a gallon 
off the price of gas, Americans con-
tinue to pay historic prices at the 
pump, face sticker shock at the super-
market, and wonder which utility com-
pany will raise their rates next. 
We have gone from an energy inde-
pendent Nation to one that is at the 
mercy of OPEC and Russia with con-
sequences that are rattling the world 
economy. Yet, the President tells us 
this is the most robust recovery in 
modern history. 
It is time to embrace the truth and 
do what works: Responsible domestic 
energy production; lower taxes to rev 
up our economy; stop the reckless 
spending; and reduce the economic bur-
den on Americans. 
We need the courage to change 
course. 
f 
VITAMIN D DEFICIENCY AND 
COVID 
(Mr. GROTHMAN asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Mr. 
GROTHMAN. 
Well, 
Madam 
Speaker, one more time I will make 
my weekly statement with regard to 
Vitamin D. 
The COVID epidemic is on the down-
slide but, in the most recent week, we 
still had 1,600 Americans die. 
I call America’s attention, and the 
subcommittee dealing with COVID, to 
the fantastic benefits of Vitamin D. 
Israeli studies show people who have 
inadequate Vitamin D levels, under 20 
nanograms per milliliter, are 11 times 
more likely to die of the COVID. And 
we have known about this for 2 years 
now.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5325 
June 7, 2022 
I beg the public health establishment 
to spend a little bit of time talking 
about Vitamin D. I beg the public 
health establishment to check for Vita-
min D levels when people come in. I 
have found people with levels as low as 
16 or 4. By taking Vitamin D supple-
ments, it may save their life. 
I point out to the medical establish-
ment that when I talk to the American 
people back home and they wonder why 
this isn’t being talked about, they be-
lieve it is because there is no money to 
be made in giving a supplement that 
can cost 12 or 13 bucks at Walgreens. 
And it is a sad state of affairs when the 
American public believes that is the 
reason they haven’t been educated on 
this lifesaving supplement.

COMMEMORATING THE 30TH ANNI-
VERSARY OF THE 340B DISCOUNT 
DRUG PROGRAM 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mrs. 
CHERFILUS-MCCORMICK). 
Under 
the 
Speaker’s announced policy of January 
4, 2021, the gentlewoman from Virginia 
(Ms. SPANBERGER) is recognized for 60 
minutes as the designee of the major-
ity leader. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Ms. SPANBERGER. Madam Speaker, 
I ask unanimous consent that all Mem-
bers have 5 legislative days to revise 
and extend their remarks and include 
extraneous material on the subject of 
this Special Order. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from Virginia? 
There was no objection. 
Ms. SPANBERGER. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to speak about the 340B 
program. I rise today to commemorate 
the 30th anniversary of the 340B drug 
discount program, which has supported 
health providers in their mission to 
care for the most vulnerable and low- 
income patients in our communities, 
all at no additional cost to the tax-
payer. 
Tonight, the House will hear stories 
from both Democrats and Republicans 
about how 340B supports the healthcare 
safety net in districts across the coun-
try, including in Virginia’s Seventh 
District. 
In 1992, Congress started the 340B 
program with a simple goal. The 340B 
program has helped hospitals, commu-
nity health centers, and Federal grant-
ees stretch their scarce resources as far 
as possible, helping them reach more 
eligible patients and provide more 
comprehensive services. 
The way it works is simple: 340B re-
quires pharmaceutical companies to 
make 
drugs 
more 
affordable 
for 
healthcare providers serving vulner-
able communities and low-income pa-
tients. By discounting the drugs, these 
providers can stretch their resources 
further and reach even more patients. 
The 340B program is especially im-
portant for providers in rural America. 
In these areas, lower incomes lead to 
higher rates of uncompensated care 
and a disproportionate number of pa-
tients with Medicare and Medicaid. 
Hospitals struggle to maintain costly 
services such as maternity wards and 
trauma centers, and patients at feder-
ally qualified health centers lack the 
resources to access high-cost drugs for 
HIV/AIDS, hemophilia, or diabetes. 
Unfortunately, since the summer of 
2020, at least 16 pharmaceutical compa-
nies have announced or implemented 
restrictions on 340B pricing. Both the 
current Biden administration and the 
previous Trump administration have 
found these restrictions to be unlawful, 
yet HHS has taken no serious enforce-
ment action to prevent or penalize 
these illegal actions. 
Let me be very clear: Every time a 
pharmaceutical company withholds a 
340B discount from an eligible phar-
macy, that company is unlawfully 
overcharging the healthcare safety net 
and withholding resources from the 
most vulnerable patients in our com-
munities. And, in response, we need to 
defend 340B. 
I commend HHS for its commitment 
to protecting the integrity of the 340B 
program, but I urge the agency to pe-
nalize the companies that refuse to 
comply with Federal law. It is the 
right thing to do for the people we 
serve. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to my col-
league from Tennessee (Mr. ROSE). 
b 1945 
Mr. ROSE. Madam Speaker, I thank 
the gentlewoman from Virginia for 
yielding me time to speak on this very 
important and lifesaving program as 
we commemorate the 30th anniversary 
of the creation of the 340B program. 
I applaud the gentlewoman from Vir-
ginia for her leadership on this issue 
and for organizing this opportunity for 
Members on both sides to speak about 
how important this issue is to each of 
our districts. 
I also thank the other Members here 
tonight and those who routinely sup-
port the 340B program. More than 220 
Members of the House recently joined a 
letter to Health and Human Services, 
urging the Department to crack down 
on drug companies denying 340B dis-
counts. By having such a large group of 
Members in support of that letter, to 
which I proudly lent my name, we dem-
onstrated the broad bipartisan support 
the 340B program enjoys across the en-
tire country. 
Madam Speaker, I include the text of 
that letter in the RECORD. 
CONGRESS OF THE UNITED STATES, 
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, 
Washington, DC, February 26, 2021. 
Acting Secretary COCHRAN, 
Department of Health and Human Services, 
Washington, DC. 
DEAR
ACTING
SECRETARY
COCHRAN: We 
write today as leading congressional pro-
ponents of the 340B drug discount program to 
ask you to take immediate action to ensure 
that manufacturers are prohibited from im-
posing unilateral changes to the program in 
direct conflict with congressional intent and 
decades of written guidance. 
We were pleased to see 28 attorneys general 
urge former HHS Secretary Azar to protect 
the 340B programs. We believe that letter 
and the Department’s Office of General 
Counsel’s advisory opinion, released on De-
cember 30 and described below, represent 
some of the most compelling legal argu-
ments for the actions we ask you to take. 
As you know, Congress enacted the 340B 
Drug Pricing Program in 1992 following the 
creation of the Medicaid Drug Rebate Pro-
gram. In order for their drugs to be covered 
by Medicaid, manufacturers are required to 
offer discounts to certain public and non-
profit health care organizations known as 
covered entities, including Federally Quali-
fied Health Centers, Ryan White HIV/AIDS 
Clinics, Medicare/Medicaid Disproportionate 
Share hospitals, rural hospitals, and chil-
dren’s hospitals. According to the legislative 
history, Congress’s intent in creating the 
discount program was to ‘‘stretch scarce fed-
eral resources to reach more eligible pa-
tients and provide more comprehensive serv-
ices.’’ 
The 340B statute requires drug manufac-
turers to ‘‘offer each covered entity covered 
outpatient drugs for purchase at or below 
the applicable ceiling price.’’ There are no 
provisions in the statute that allow manu-
facturers to set conditions or otherwise im-
pede a provider’s ability to access 340B dis-
counts. The Health Resources and Services 
Administration (HRSA), which oversees the 
program, has indicated on multiple occa-
sions, dating back to the early years of the 
program, that the 340B statute requires man-
ufacturers to provide 340B discounts to cov-
ered entities when covered entities purchase 
drugs to be dispensed through contract phar-
macies on a covered entity’s behalf. 
Beginning in the summer of 2020, several 
drug manufacturers began to announce a 
range of actions to avoid honoring 340B dis-
counts for certain drugs, many with the 
highest prices, delivered to covered entities’ 
contract pharmacies. Some manufacturers 
have announced they will no longer ship dis-
counted drugs to contract pharmacies; oth-
ers will ship to only one contract pharmacy 
per covered entity. 
HHS has reviewed manufacturers’ refusals 
to provide 340B discounts to covered entities’ 
contract pharmacies and found them to be 
unlawful. In a December 30th 2020 advisory 
opinion, 
then-general 
counsel 
Robert 
Charrow wrote, ‘‘[T]he core requirement of 
the 340B statute . . . is that manufacturers 
must ‘‘offer’’ covered outpatient drugs at or 
below the ceiling price for ‘‘purchase by’’ 
covered entities. This fundamental require-
ment is not qualified, restricted, or depend-
ent on how the covered entity chooses to dis-
tribute the covered outpatient drugs.’’ 
Unfortunately, publishing the advisory 
opinion has not deterred manufacturers from 
continuing with unlawful price hikes. Many 
covered entities are struggling with severe 
financial losses as a result of the COVID–19 
pandemic. They cannot afford to be unfairly 
targeted by large pharmaceutical corpora-
tions or be forced to pay higher up-front 
costs for the drugs their patients need. 
Furthermore, an information technology 
company has allied with manufacturers to 
change the 340B program from one of upfront 
discounts to post-sale rebates, a change that 
would greatly increase costs for covered en-
tities and give manufacturers tremendous le-
verage over covered entities. Such action is 
inconsistent 
with 
HRSA’s 
long-standing 
guidance that the 340B program is an up- 
front discount program.’’ 
The December 14th letter from the attor-
neys general called on HHS to ‘‘address drug 
manufacturers’ unlawful refusal to provide 
critical drug discounts to covered entities.’’ 
Consistent with that letter, we urge you to: 
1. Begin assessing civil monetary penalties 
on manufacturers that deny 340B pricing to

covered entities in violation of their obliga-
tions under the 340B statute; 
2. Require manufacturers to refund covered 
entities the discounts they have unlawfully 
withheld since 2020; 
3. Halt, through guidance or other means, 
any attempt to unilaterally change 340B up-
front discounts to post sale rebates; and 
4. Immediately seat the Administrative 
Dispute Resolution Panel to begin processing 
disputes within the program. 
As the attorneys general stated in their 
December 14th letter, ‘‘Each day that drug 
manufacturers violate their statutory obli-
gations, vulnerable patients and their health 
care centers are deprived of the essential 
healthcare resources Congress intended to 
provide.’’ Thank you very much for your 
prompt consideration of these important 
matters. 
Mr. ROSE. Madam Speaker, even 
though the 340B program has received 
such overwhelming support from Mem-
bers of Congress, multiple administra-
tions, hospitals, doctors, pharmacists, 
and patients, it still finds itself strug-
gling to survive from relentless efforts 
to undermine its existence by some 
pharmaceutical companies refusing to 
abide by the law. HHS must take im-
mediate enforcement action against all 
of these noncompliant drug companies. 
As many of us here tonight under-
stand, the 340B program is an impor-
tant avenue for offering lower drug 
prices for our most vulnerable citizens. 
It is often a lifeline of financial sup-
port for the small, rural hospitals in 
middle Tennessee and across the coun-
try. These very same hospitals are 
often the only source of care for com-
munities 
in 
expansive 
geographic 
areas. 
I have no other word to describe it 
other than ‘‘unconscionable’’ that com-
panies founded to help sick patients by 
providing lifesaving medication delib-
erately undermine a law to increase af-
fordable access to their lifesaving 
medications. It is truly disgraceful. 
Tonight, we are going to hear more 
about this malpractice. I hope by high-
lighting this issue here on the floor of 
the U.S. House of Representatives, we 
will encourage other Members of the 
House and the Senate to take imme-
diate and decisive action to protect the 
340B program. 
Ms. SPANBERGER. Madam Speaker, 
I thank the gentleman from Tennessee 
for his comments. Certainly, his com-
ments focus so much on the impor-
tance of the 340B program. We know 
that rural hospitals are the lifeblood of 
their communities. They often serve as 
the largest employer in a town and a 
way to keep and attract young people 
to that community. 
Rural hospitals are already in crisis, 
and since 2005, more than 180 rural hos-
pitals have closed their doors. One rea-
son why that number is not higher is 
the 340B program. 
Savings from 340B discounts and 
community pharmacies are half of all 
the savings for rural hospitals. If these 
losses are allowed to stand and grow 
bigger, we will face a real crisis across 
rural America. 
Recent 
actions 
by 
the 
pharma-
ceutical companies threaten the abil-
ity of rural hospitals to stay open, 
costing them, on average, $229,000. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman 
from 
Arizona 
(Mr. 
O’HALLERAN). 
Mr. O’HALLERAN. Madam Speaker, 
I thank Congresswoman SPANBERGER, 
along with the gentleman from Penn-
sylvania, for organizing this Special 
Order hour on the importance of rural 
health outcomes and the programs that 
support them. 
Together, our bipartisan group rises 
today to speak in support of the 340B 
drug discount pricing program. The 
340B 
program 
enables 
community 
health centers to purchase outpatient 
drugs at reduced prices, allowing them 
to ensure that low-income patients 
have access to affordable prescription 
drugs, along with rural hospitals. 
The dollars this program saves must 
also be reinvested directly into the 
health centers themselves, creating an 
influx of much-needed funding that our 
rural-serving 
institutions 
so 
often 
lack—way too often lack. 
There are eight different 340B hos-
pitals in Arizona’s First Congressional 
District, more than any other district 
in our State. In 2018, studies found that 
340B program hospitals accounted for 
84 percent of all hospital care provided 
to Medicaid patients in Arizona. 
From Casa Grande all the way up to 
Page, these hospitals need our help 
now. That is because, currently, sev-
eral drug manufacturers are unlawfully 
withholding or limiting discounts from 
340B-covered entities—I personally do 
not understand this at all—including 
safety-net hospitals and community 
health centers. 
Anybody that lives in rural Arizona 
knows the critical need for hospitals 
and community healthcare centers and 
that they are suffering. 
Today, I am standing with my col-
leagues on both sides of the aisle to 
support this program and in support of 
the PROTECT 340B Act. Our legislation 
would prohibit pharmaceutical entities 
from discriminatory practices against 
340B healthcare centers and hospitals. 
Last year, we sent a letter demand-
ing 
HHS 
take 
immediate 
action 
against manufacturers that refuse to 
comply with their obligation—I repeat, 
‘‘their obligation’’—to provide CHCs 
and rural hospital providers with dis-
counted drugs and require manufactur-
ers to refund the providers for months 
of unlawful overcharges. Today, we are 
speaking in support of these asks yet 
again. 
In my district, the families that re-
ceive care at Banner Casa Grande Med-
ical Center, Cobre Valley Medical Cen-
ter, Flagstaff Medical Center, Little 
Colorado Medical Center, Mt. Graham 
Regional Medical Center, Page Hos-
pital, Summit Healthcare Regional 
Medical Hospital, and White Mountain 
Regional Hospital are counting on us 
to get this done. 
CMS should understand that this is 
required to get done. I am confident we 
can if we work together. 
Ms. SPANBERGER. Madam Speaker, 
I thank my colleague from Arizona for 
speaking about this important program 
and the value that it has across his dis-
trict. 
I am now grateful for the oppor-
tunity to yield to my colleague from 
Pennsylvania. 
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. 
Madam Speaker, first of all, I thank 
my colleague from Virginia for hosting 
and coordinating this time tonight on 
an incredibly important issue for rural 
America. 
Madam Speaker, this year marks the 
30th anniversary of the 340B Federal 
drug pricing program. I am very famil-
iar with this program, having worked 
for 28 years in rural hospitals where 
this 340B program was incredibly im-
portant for consumers, for patients, to 
be able to get access to the medica-
tions that they require but also equally 
important as a lifeline for our rural 
hospitals. 
Rural hospitals today, in my experi-
ence, having worked within these fa-
cilities for almost three decades, most 
hospitals are lucky to break even, espe-
cially rural hospitals. It is very chal-
lenging financially, but we know how 
important they are. 
We know that these tend to be the 
economic engines within our rural 
communities. These are the source of 
great jobs. This is access to quality 
healthcare. When these rural hospitals 
close, 
the 
economic 
impacts, 
the 
healthcare impacts, the health impacts 
are significant and negative for those 
communities. 
I can’t tell you how many times, 
Madam Speaker, I have seen the 340B 
program be the difference between a 
red, losing year, where you bleed 
money, you lose money—and you can 
do that for only so long until a hospital 
has to shutter its doors and lay people 
off—and perhaps breaking even or even 
just a slight margin. 
In rural healthcare, a rural hospital, 
a 1 to 2 percent margin is a banner 
year. It is a great year. That is hardly 
enough to invest in modern, lifesaving 
technology or to invest in your staff to 
recruit and retain those qualified pro-
viders that are the key part of all 
healthcare. It really comes down to the 
providers, having those folks and re-
taining them. 
The 340B program, I can tell you in 
all the decades of my healthcare expe-
rience where I have seen it, has made 
the difference of having a margin to be 
able to keep the lights on; to be able to 
invest in lifesaving advances, tech-
nology, equipment; and, quite frankly, 
retain and recruit the best and the 
brightest. 
This was enacted in 1992, originally. 
The 340B drug pricing program requires 
pharmaceutical companies to provide 
certain healthcare organizations, like 
federally qualified health centers and 
rural hospitals, discounts on their 
drugs in exchange for having their 
drugs covered by Medicaid.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5327 
June 7, 2022 
The program was created with a pur-
pose to ‘‘stretch scarce Federal re-
sources to reach more eligible patients 
and provide more comprehensive serv-
ices’’—a worthy cause, a worthy mis-
sion. 
As the Member representing Penn-
sylvania’s 
15th 
Congressional 
Dis-
trict—it includes 14 counties, nearly 25 
percent of the land mass of the Com-
monwealth—I am a strong advocate for 
the 340B program as it is a lifeline to 
many of my constituents. As I said be-
fore, I have worked within those sys-
tems. I have seen it firsthand. 
Sadly, the 340B program is under at-
tack. Some drug manufacturers have 
stopped honoring the 340B discounts. In 
other words, if a health center receives 
340B savings, it is usually unable to 
keep them because third parties have 
found creative ways to pick the 340B 
savings out of the center’s pockets. 
This is simply unacceptable and hurts 
those who truly need these medica-
tions. 
For these reasons, I am proud to be a 
cosponsor of H.R. 4390, the PROTECT 
340B Act, which prohibits these types 
of practices and ensures 340B savings 
remain where Congress meant them to 
go: with the safety-net providers and 
the medically underserved patients 
that they care for. 
Madam Speaker, I am going to con-
tinue to support policies that strength-
en the 340B program. I am going to 
work to ensure any developments that 
threaten the ability of safety-net pro-
viders to provide critical health serv-
ices, including the many in my con-
gressional district, are stopped in their 
tracks. 
I really very much appreciate the 
gentlewoman from Virginia for her 
leadership on this and all of my col-
leagues who have come together to-
night to defend a program that is about 
access for healthcare consumers and 
access to healthcare in rural America. 
Ms. SPANBERGER. Madam Speaker, 
I thank my colleague from Pennsyl-
vania for his comments. They are so 
important because he was talking 
about the impact that we see when 
pharmaceutical companies do not abide 
by the 340B program. 
We know that hospitals that serve 
more urban areas report that, on aver-
age, they have lost nearly a quarter of 
the 
340B 
resources 
they 
receive 
through partnerships with community 
pharmacies. That is a median loss of $1 
million. 
For critical access hospitals that are 
the only source of hospital care for 
their remote, rural communities, this 
loss is nearly 40 percent, and the me-
dian loss is $220,000. 
These losses of millions of dollars are 
harmful to hospitals with razor-thin 
operating margins, especially the more 
than half that operate in the red even 
with 340B support, echoing and illus-
trating the point made by my col-
league from Pennsylvania. 
To be clear, these losses are going to 
drug companies that continue to report 
excellent results to their shareholders, 
many of whom report double-digit prof-
it margins. We know that that impacts 
hospitals across our communities and 
their ability to serve patients and pro-
vide care. 
I am now pleased to yield time to the 
gentleman from New Hampshire (Mr. 
PAPPAS). 
Mr. PAPPAS. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the Representative for her lead-
ership in organizing this bipartisan 
Special Order hour. 
It is important for us to be together 
here to commemorate the 30th anniver-
sary of the 340B program. We know 
that it has helped to ensure that rural 
communities and low-income individ-
uals in districts like mine and across 
the country have access to the life-
saving 
healthcare 
and 
prescription 
drugs that they need. 
I am also here in strong opposition to 
what these drug companies are doing. 
They are undermining the 340B dis-
counts. I believe it is a violation of the 
law, and it is hurting families in my 
district. 
There are at least 13 pharmaceutical 
companies right now that are unlaw-
fully withholding or limiting discounts 
under the 340B program, and it impacts 
providers and patients in New Hamp-
shire, including our hospitals, our com-
munity health centers, and other pro-
viders who serve our most vulnerable 
neighbors. 
I have heard about this from my con-
stituents who have talked about the 
importance of this program, and I 
think their words tell a pretty power-
ful story. 
In Rockingham County in my dis-
trict, one of my constituents requires 
daily medication. Without 340B, not 
only would she not be able to afford her 
medication, but she would also be 
forced to choose between affording her 
home or affording her own health. 
b 2000 
In Strafford County, in my district, 
there is another New Hampshire resi-
dent who uses the 340B program for in-
sulin for their diabetes. They pay just 
$45 a month for three vials of insulin 
instead of $400 a month for just one 
vial. According to them, ‘‘Everything 
would get turned upside down for me if 
the program ended.’’ 
And because of the 340B program, 
staff at a community health center in 
my district have been able to reduce 
the cost of treatments significantly. 
Specifically, for one patient who has 
lived with a condition since they were 
12 years old, costs were reduced from 
$400 to just about $100. They shared 
this with me: ‘‘I can’t imagine what I 
would do if it weren’t for the 340B pro-
gram helping with the price of my 
medication. Please do everything you 
can to protect this.’’ 
Last year, I signed a letter with over 
220 House Members to protect the 340B 
program and oppose the actions of 
these drug companies. We called on 
HHS to take action to stop these com-
panies from denying these 340B dis-
counts. 
In February, I was very proud to join 
so many of my colleagues in cospon-
soring the PROTECT 340B Act. This 
would stop health insurers and phar-
macy benefit managers from discrimi-
nating against 340B providers, and it 
would protect the health and well- 
being of my constituents and so many 
others across this country that depend 
on this program. 
At a time when pharmaceutical com-
panies are reaping record profits, when 
the cost of prescription drugs con-
tinues to skyrocket, it is just uncon-
scionable that there are corporate ac-
tors who continue to ignore the law 
and stick it to our consumers, our con-
stituents, the patients across this 
country and hand them an astronom-
ical bill. 
We have all got to join together and 
commit ourselves to fighting to lower 
the cost of prescription drugs. This is 
one area where I think Republicans and 
Democrats can come together and pass 
something meaningful. I hope our col-
leagues will heed the stories they have 
heard here tonight. I thank Represent-
ative SPANBERGER for her leadership. 
Ms. SPANBERGER. Madam Speaker, 
I thank Mr. PAPPAS for sharing the sto-
ries that he is hearing directly from his 
district. 
When I asked pharmacists about how 
this program works in practice, we 
were overwhelmed with responses re-
lated to how patients have been able to 
access care through the 340B program. 
I will just give one example as follow- 
up to Mr. PAPPAS’ comments. 
We had a pharmacist say, ‘‘I have 
countless numbers of patients who are 
now able to get their insulin and con-
trol their diabetes because of the 340B 
program.’’ When their local pharmacy 
prices put their insulin costs into the 
range of hundreds of dollars each 
month, this pharmacist, because of the 
340B program, is able to meet the needs 
of these community members with dia-
betes who otherwise would not be able 
to afford their lifesaving medication. 
We have story after story from phar-
macists who recognize the value of this 
program and depend on it in order to 
serve patients throughout Virginia, 
New Hampshire, and throughout the 
country. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman from Illinois (Mr. DANNY
K. 
DAVIS). 
Mr. DANNY K. DAVIS of Illinois. 
Madam Speaker, I commend and thank 
my colleague from Virginia for orga-
nizing this Special Order. 
I am pleased to join with all of my 
colleagues who have spoken strongly in 
favor 
of 
revitalizing, 
reenergizing, 
making sure that the 340B program is 
implemented in a very serious way. 
I welcomed a young intern to my of-
fice this afternoon, and he was coming 
from Tufts University. I shared with 
him the fact that it was Tufts Univer-
sity in Mound Bayou, Mississippi, that 
started the first of the federally quali-
fied health centers and that he was in

a good place. I worked with 2 of them 
personally, and there were only 10 in 
the country at the time. Now, of 
course, we have more than 2,000, and 
they are practically in every State, 
every community, wherever you are. 
I represent a large, urban, low-in-
come community with 23 hospitals, 
many of which are safety net. I think I 
may have more hospitals than any sin-
gle area. A discount for the individuals 
who use these institutions will be more 
than helpful to them, so I urge that we 
continue the program, but I really urge 
that we enforce and make sure that 
they do what they were designed to do. 
Ms. SPANBERGER. Madam Speaker, 
I thank Mr. DAVIS for his comments 
and certainly for bringing up the im-
portant role that federally qualified 
health centers raise in providing care. 
We know that they stretch their scarce 
resources. In fact, one of the federally 
qualified health centers in my district 
in Louisa County has shared with us 
some stories about the impact of this 
program. 
Louisa County is one of the most 
rural counties in my district, and the 
Louisa County Health and Wellness 
Center is a federally qualified health 
center, and it is an invaluable resource 
for Louisa County and our local com-
munity. 
Discounts through the 340B program 
allows the Central Virginia Health 
Services and the Louisa County Health 
and Wellness Center to offset the costs 
of providing nonprofitable services, 
such as dental and behavioral health. 
The savings from 340B allows Central 
Virginia Health Services to have a 
strong clinical pharmacy team that 
provides extensive support with Medi-
care annual wellness visits, medication 
compliance 
with 
complex 
patients, 
managing its hepatitis C program, and 
overseeing diabetic initiatives. Most 
importantly, the 340B savings allows 
Central Virginia Health Services and 
other federally qualified health centers 
to offer substantial sliding fee dis-
counts to patients regardless of wheth-
er or not they have insurance. 
The Federal grant only covers about 
40 percent of the cost of treating a pa-
tient, and the rest comes from 340B 
savings. So let me be clear on that: It 
is the savings that federally qualified 
health centers receive because they are 
able to participate in this program. Be-
cause the drugs that they are pre-
scribing and giving to their patients 
cost less, those savings they are able to 
invest elsewhere. In the case of Louisa 
County, they are putting those dollars 
into dental and behavioral health. 
The intent of the 340B program for 
the past 30 years has been to help 
stretch Federal resources for the ben-
efit of the taxpayer, and this is a great 
example of exactly how that is hap-
pening back home in Virginia’s Sev-
enth District. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman from Illinois (Mr. GARCI´A) to 
speak on this important program. 
Mr. 
GARCI´A 
of 
Illinois. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
I 
thank 
Representative 
SPANBERGER for organizing this Special 
Order. 
I, like the previous speakers, rise in 
support of the 340B drug pricing pro-
gram. This little-known program rep-
resents only about 3 percent of the 
total drug sales in our country, but it 
is one of the most far-reaching health 
programs, especially for folks in my 
district. 
Let me share a story of an elderly pa-
tient at Erie Family Health Centers, 
which is based in my district. She had 
no insurance and struggled to afford 
her diabetes medication. Sadly, this is 
far too common in my district. The 
price jumped to $200, and she could not 
access 
her 
pharmacy 
during 
the 
COVID–19 crisis. But thanks to the 
340B program, this patient now pays $9 
for her medication, and it is delivered 
for free, straight to her home. 
This patient is not alone. Many Erie 
patients would not be able to obtain 
their insulin without the 340B dis-
count. Unfortunately, this program is 
currently under assault on several 
fronts. We have to stand up. And we 
must protect it. 
Community health centers are under 
tremendous pressure to keep their 
doors open while caring for the most 
impacted. The timing could not be 
worse for pharmaceutical manufactur-
ers to undermine such a critical pro-
gram. The 340B program provides life-
saving medication for nearly 1.5 mil-
lion patients of Illinois community 
health centers as well as housing, 
transportation, care management, and 
more. 
We must defend this crucial program. 
It is literally a lifeline for commu-
nities like mine. 
Ms. SPANBERGER. Madam Speaker, 
I thank my colleague from Illinois for 
providing such an important story, il-
lustrating the value of the 340B pro-
gram in Illinois, and those stories exist 
across the country. 
I now yield to the gentleman from 
Tennessee (Mr. ROSE), as we continue 
our discussion about the value of this 
program. 
Mr. ROSE. Madam Speaker, I want to 
talk a little more about the impor-
tance of H.R. 4390, the PROTECT 340B 
Act of 2021, which was introduced by 
the gentleman from West Virginia (Mr. 
MCKINLEY), my friend, and is co-led by 
the gentlewoman from Virginia (Ms. 
SPANBERGER), the lead organizer of this 
Special Order. 
Passage of the PROTECT 340B Act of 
2021 is essential in order to push back 
against recent attacks on the 340B pro-
gram. 
This bill would prohibit pharmacy 
benefit managers, otherwise known as 
PBMs, from discriminating against 
340B providers or their contract phar-
macies. 
The PROTECT 340B Act is supported 
by America’s Essential Hospitals, 340B 
Health, National Association of Com-
munity Health Centers, and Ryan 
White Clinics for 340B Access. To en-
sure PBMs are held accountable, it al-
lows the HHS Secretary to impose civil 
monetary penalties. 
This is the definition of a good bill. It 
has broad, bipartisan support in the 
House as well as among outside groups, 
and it even has an enforcement mecha-
nism that hits the bad actors where it 
hurts them most—their pocketbooks. 
Ms. SPANBERGER. Madam Speaker, 
I thank my colleague from Tennessee. I 
appreciate his talking about the PRO-
TECT 340B program. I was so proud to 
lead this effort. And certainly, as we 
have heard today, Congress’ intention 
for the 340B program is to support safe-
ty net providers and their ability to 
stretch their scarce resources and pro-
vide more comprehensive services to 
vulnerable patients. 
Congress certainly did not intend for 
the 340B program and those discounts 
to subsidize the profits of Fortune 100 
pharmacy benefit managers, and I 
thank Mr. ROSE for recognizing that. 
I was proud to work with my col-
leagues across the aisle to introduce 
PROTECT 340B to stop PBMs from, 
frankly, pickpocketing 340B discounts 
so that we can ensure the benefits of 
340B reach the community health cen-
ters, the HIV/AIDS clinics, and the 
rural hospitals that Congress intended 
to support. 
I thank the gentleman from West 
Virginia (Mr. MCKINLEY), who has been 
an absolute champion of this issue. I 
have been so grateful to work with him 
and his team every step along the way. 
His commitment to West Virginia, the 
safety net hospitals, the rural hos-
pitals, and the communities that rely 
on 340B is apparent through his dedica-
tion to this. 
Our bill is in response to the stories 
that we have heard from pharmacists 
across our districts. PBMs have estab-
lished two tiers of payment for phar-
macy-dispersed drugs, one for chain 
and retail pharmacies unassociated 
with 340B providers, and another sig-
nificantly lower rate for 340B phar-
macies. 
Years of market consolidation have 
given the three leading PBMs incred-
ible market power, and they can effec-
tively dictate terms to smaller 340B 
pharmacies. What that means is PBMs 
are essentially pickpocketing 340B sav-
ings from safety net providers. Instead 
of helping the healthcare safety net 
reach more patients, the 340B savings 
are subsidizing the profits of some of 
the largest, most profitable companies 
in America, and that means that those 
safety net hospitals, those rural hos-
pitals, those federally qualified health 
centers are not able to put those sav-
ings toward care to patients. 
Our PROTECT 340B Act would hold 
PBMs accountable and prevent them 
from applying these predatory business 
practices to the local health centers, 
the rural hospitals, and other Federal 
grantees. It would also create a na-
tional clearinghouse to track 340B dis-
counts and make sure 340B drugs are 
not included in States’ Medicaid rebate 
requests. 
Together, 
these 
changes

would restore the integrity of the pro-
gram and protect the healthcare safety 
net so many of our constituents rely 
on. 
I am proud that for over the past 2 
years many States, including Virginia, 
have 
passed 
laws 
to 
protect 
the 
healthcare safety net from these preda-
tory business practices, but it is not 
enough. A Federal standard is nec-
essary to ensure consistent and broad 
protections for healthcare providers 
and, importantly, to actually ensure 
that we are enforcing the law, and we 
are seeing momentum toward that mo-
ment. Currently, our bill has more 
than 90 cosponsors, and I welcome the 
rest of our colleagues to join our effort. 
Certainly, from tonight, people should 
be able to see this is an issue that 
many people from across the country 
and across the aisle certainly can get 
behind, and I urge my colleagues to 
consider joining us in this legislation. 
b 2015 
Madam Speaker, I am happy to yield 
time back to the gentleman from Ten-
nessee (Mr. ROSE) to continue this con-
versation and education about the 
value of the 340B program. 
Mr. ROSE. Madam Speaker, again, I 
thank the gentlewoman from Virginia 
for yielding, and I join her in calling on 
our colleagues to join us in this effort 
to preserve and protect the 340B pro-
gram. 
I will share a success story that high-
lights how Members worked in a bipar-
tisan way to solve a major issue within 
the 340B program. 
Because of the COVID–19 pandemic, 
some hospitals lost their 340B eligi-
bility due to the influx of COVID–19 pa-
tients that overwhelmed some hos-
pitals and diminished their ability to 
meet the requirements of the 340B pro-
gram. Two of those hospitals were in 
my district in rural Tennessee. How-
ever, the gentlewoman from California, 
Representative 
MATSUI, 
introduced 
H.R. 3203, which was designed to re-
store eligibility to hospitals that lost 
their 340B status due to the pandemic. 
I was proud to lend my name as a co-
sponsor to this bipartisan bill. 
I am happy to report that because of 
this bipartisan support and the leader-
ship of Members like Representative 
MATSUI, this issue was fixed in section 
121 of the Consolidated Appropriations 
Act of 2022. Because of this bipartisan 
effort, I am pleased to report back that 
both hospitals in my district in Ten-
nessee have since regained that 340B 
eligibility. 
Madam Speaker, I hope this story 
shows that Members are capable of pro-
tecting and strengthening the 340B pro-
gram in a bipartisan way. 
Ms. SPANBERGER. Madam Speaker, 
I thank and appreciate the gentleman. 
Madam Speaker, we have been join-
ing together to recognize the impor-
tance of this program, ensuring that it 
is there to serve our communities. And 
I will give an example. 
Virginia Commonwealth University, 
or VCU, is the largest safety net hos-
pital in Virginia, and it serves the 
greatest number of uninsured and Med-
icaid patients in our Commonwealth. 
Nearly three-quarters of VCU’s payor 
mix is public or uninsured. I am proud 
that VCU has been a good steward of 
the discounts it receives through the 
340B program, consistent with Congres-
sional intent that the 340B program be 
used to ensure these discounts can 
stretch Federal resources. 
The 340B program supports VCU’s 
health systems’ commitment to serv-
ing all members of the community, re-
gardless of their ability to pay. And in 
2020 
alone, 
the 
program’s 
savings 
helped VCU Health provide nearly 2,100 
patients with $27,300 discounted or free 
medications and over $64 million in un-
compensated care in fiscal year 2021. 
I am going to repeat that. The pro-
gram savings, the savings that VCU 
was able to get through the 340B pro-
gram, allowed them to provide $64 mil-
lion in uncompensated care. 
VCU has used its 340B discounts to 
stretch its resources and expand pa-
tients’ access to care. For example, in 
just one year, one patient visited 
VCU’s Emergency Department nearly 
50 times. He was homeless, and he had 
multiple chronic conditions; so the 
emergency department referred him to 
VCU’s Health Complex Care Clinic. 
There, thanks to 340B discounts, the 
patient 
received 
significantly 
dis-
counted medications from the hospital 
pharmacy. Meanwhile, the clinic staff 
helped the patient find transitional 
housing and apply for Medicaid cov-
erage. 
Over the next 3 years, the patient 
only had four emergency department 
visits. In 1 year, this man visited the 
emergency room 50 times because it 
was how he was able to get the 
healthcare that he needed. But thanks 
to the 340B program and how well it is 
utilized by hospitals like VCU and hos-
pitals across the country, this man was 
able to get the medicine he needed 
through this program at a discounted 
rate. And the hospital was able to in-
vest its resources in providing care and 
ensuring that this gentleman could get 
the medication he needed for his chron-
ic illness and also find his way into 
transitional housing, apply for Med-
icaid coverage, and over 3 years, he had 
four emergency department visits. 
That is investing in the community, 
in better health outcomes, and this is 
exactly why this program was created. 
The discounts available through 340B 
helped providers like VCU meet the 
needs of their patients and certainly 
uphold the intent of 340B and the pro-
gram as it was created 30 years ago. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman from Tennessee (Mr. ROSE), my 
colleague. 
Mr. ROSE. Madam Speaker, again, I 
thank the gentlewoman from Virginia 
(Ms. SPANBERGER). She has done a com-
mendable job putting tonight’s Special 
Order together, gathering support from 
both sides of the aisle to come speak 
here tonight about the 340B program, 
and being one of the Members leading 
the fight to protect the lifesaving 340B 
program. 
Madam Speaker, by their presence on 
the House floor tonight and the persua-
sive and powerful words they have spo-
ken, these Members have sent the un-
mistakable signal that we are all reso-
lutely prepared to fight on behalf of 
our constituents who benefit from the 
340B program, even if it ruffles some 
powerful feathers. 
If Big Pharma would just play by the 
rules and abide by the law, I am sure 
we wouldn’t be in the position we are 
today. 
However, 
the 
big 
pharma-
ceutical companies aren’t playing by 
the rules, and they are showing no 
signs that they have an interest in 
doing so. 
All we are asking is that they, too, 
are held accountable to the law. That 
is it. Nothing more, nothing less. In 
the meantime, we will continue to push 
back on their brazen attempts to un-
dermine the law because I know we are 
on the right side of this fight. 
I encourage all Members to reach out 
to the Federally qualified health cen-
ters, the Ryan White Clinics, Medicare/ 
Medicaid Disproportionate Share hos-
pitals, rural hospitals, and children’s 
hospitals in your districts that are 340B 
participants. You will find that the 
340B program has an enormous impact 
on communities all across this coun-
try. 
Lastly, I reiterate my support for 
H.R. 4390, the Protect 340B Act, and I 
sincerely beseech House leadership to 
bring the bill to the floor for a vote. 
Ms. SPANBERGER. Madam Speaker, 
I thank Mr. ROSE and his commitment 
to this issue, and I thank him for join-
ing me in this Special Order hour. It 
has really been a wonderful experience 
to hear from our colleagues from 
across the country and across the aisle 
talk about the value of this program. 
Certainly, we heard Mr. THOMPSON of 
Pennsylvania talk about the impact 
that the 340B program has on hospitals; 
their ability to operate, their ability to 
provide their service, and their ability 
to be there for their patients, the im-
portance that this program has to the 
operation of our healthcare system 
here in the United States. 
We heard from Mr. PAPPAS of New 
Hampshire, stories of particular peo-
ple’s experience, that thanks to the 
340B program, patients with a need in 
communities wanting to serve their 
constituents have been able to ensure 
that people who need medication can 
get it through the 340B program. 
Mr. O’HALLERAN
of Arizona high-
lighted the value of this program in 
rural communities across the United 
States. And Mr. DAVIS
of Illinois 
talked about the creation of Federally 
qualified health centers and how vital 
the 340B program is to their ability to 
serve their patients, their commu-
nities, and our communities. 
Mr. GARCI´A of Illinois told a really 
specific story about the impact of 340B 
on a patient with diabetes and what he

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5330 
June 7, 2022 
is hearing directly from constituents. 
And certainly, Mr. ROSE, in our com-
ments back and forth, my colleague 
and I have talked about the value of 
this program, the intent of this pro-
gram, and our efforts to ensure that 
pharmaceutical companies and phar-
macy benefit managers are not break-
ing the law and are not raiding the cof-
fers of the 340B discount program. 
Madam Speaker, I close out tonight 
by just thanking all of the Members 
who came to the floor, all of the Mem-
bers who support legislation to support 
this vital program, and all of the Mem-
bers who recognize the value of the 
340B program within their district. 
Again, I give a very special thanks to 
my friend from Tennessee that helped 
manage the floor during this Special 
Order hour. 
Since it came into being nearly 30 
years ago, 340B has enabled a strong 
healthcare safety net that has served 
thousands of communities and millions 
of patients. It has been a lifeline for 
hospitals, health centers, and clinics 
that serve patients with low incomes, 
especially those who are uninsured or 
on Medicaid and those in rural areas. It 
has done so with strong bipartisan sup-
port and without costing any taxpayer 
dollars. Again, these savings allow our 
communities’ 
hospitals 
to 
stretch 
those Federal dollars, to save those 
Federal dollars. This program does not 
cost a single taxpayer dollar. 
The 340B Drug Pricing Program is a 
success story for patient access to care. 
We should celebrate it. We should pro-
tect it. We should defend 340B. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the re-
mainder of my time.

PRAYER 
The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, of-
fered the following prayer: 
Let us pray. 
Lord, You are our source of hope and 
salvation. So why should we be afraid? 
You have been our fortress when evil 
has seemed to be winning. So why 
should we tremble? Lord, keep us fear-
less even when surrounded by preda-
tory evil. Even when there is violence 
within our Nation, give us confidence 
that Your purposes will prevail. Today, 
use our lawmakers as instruments of 
Your peace. 
Hear this prayer, mighty God, for 
Your faithfulness continues to sustain 
us. 
We pray in our Redeemer’s Name. 
Amen.

RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY LEADER 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The majority leader is recog-

GUN VIOLENCE 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, as the 
Senate’s June work period begins, the 
American people have one question 
front of mind: After years and decades 
of gridlock, will the Senate do some-
thing about our Nation’s gun violence 
epidemic? 
Democrats are ready to take action, 
and soon every single Member of this 
Chamber is going to have to answer 
that question. 
Today is June 7, 2022. It is the 158th 
day of the year. Already—already—this 
year, we have had over 250 mass shoot-
ings—over 250. That is more than one a 
day. 
Two weeks ago, we saw the worst 
school shooting in America since the 
tragedy at Sandy Hook. An 18-year-old 
boy bought two assault rifles for his 
birthday and gunned down 19 children 
in Uvalde, TX—9-year-olds, 10-year- 
olds, 11-year-olds. You see the pictures 
of kids with their sweatshirts, with 
their 
awards, 
with 
their 
trophies. 
Every parent has seen pictures of chil-
dren that age, and to know that they 
are no longer—that they were wiped 
out, that they were brutally mur-
dered—breaks your heart. It just sends 
shivers down your spine. A few hours 
later, after it happened, the parents re-
alized and were told they would never 
see their children again. 
Ten days before that, eleven more 
people were gunned down while grocery 
shopping in Buffalo, simply because of 
the color of their skin. I still can’t get 
out of my mind the 3-year-old I met, 
when I visited Buffalo, who lost his dad 
because his dad made a quick stop to 
the Tops Supermarket to get his son a 
birthday cake. It was his son’s birth-
day. He will never see his dad again 
and will live with that his whole life— 
knowing that his dad was killed in 
order to get him a birthday cake. 
And 
for 
every 
tragedy 
that 
traumatizes the Nation’s collective 
psyche, there are countless others that 
take place outside the national spot-
light. They happen every single day in 
homes and communities in every part 
of this country. Across every neighbor-
hood, every school, every small town, 
every large city, Americans of all per-
suasions are wondering the same thing: 
When is it going to be enough? When 
will Congress find the will to act? One 
party has that will and soon will deter-
mine whether the other side on the 
aisle will join. That is the challenge 
that faces this Chamber as we begin 
this work period. 
Before Memorial Day, I made clear 
that the Senate will vote on gun safety

June 7, 2022 
legislation in the near future. To that 
end, a handful of my Democratic col-
leagues, led by Senator MURPHY, in-
cluding the great work of Senators 
BLUMENTHAL, SINEMA, MANCHIN, COONS, 
HEINRICH, and others, have been hold-
ing extended and substantive talks 
with Republicans to see what we can 
pass in this Chamber that will mean-
ingfully address our Nation’s gunfire 
epidemic. 
I am encouraging my Democratic 
colleagues to keep talking to see if Re-
publicans will work with us to come up 
with something that will make a mean-
ingful change in the lives of the Amer-
ican people and help stop gun violence. 
There is virtual unanimity among Sen-
ate Democrats that getting something 
passed through this Chamber is worth 
pursuing if it will make a tangible dif-
ference in preventing gun violence. 
We know we are not going to get ev-
erything we want. We know the push 
for even more meaningful gun safety 
will continue after this debate, but 
making real progress is very impor-
tant. Senator MURPHY has asked for 
some space to have these bipartisan 
talks continue, and I have given him 
that space. I look forward to discussing 
the status of those talks with my col-
leagues today. 
We owe it to American parents. We 
owe it to American kids. We owe it to 
every single neighborhood, every single 
community, every single household 
that has been ripped apart by gun vio-
lence. This is a tough fight. Neverthe-
less, we have a moral obligation to do 
everything conceivable to break the 
cycle of violence. 
In the wake of the tragedies in 
Uvalde and Buffalo, we have a chance 
to tell the American people that, this 
time, their anguish will not fall on deaf 
ears. We have a chance to tell them we 
hear them; that we, too, are angry and 
we will do everything we can to make 
real progress in the Senate, difficult as 
that is. But it is only going to happen 
if both sides keep working. Only with 
that will hope for a compromise trans-
late into real, concrete legislation. We 
know it is a difficult hurdle to over-
come; but, nevertheless, we must do ev-
erything we can to try and succeed. 
HONORING OUR PACT ACT OF 2021 
Mr. President, now onto the PACT 
Act. Later this morning, the Senate 
will take the first vote to advance one 
of 
the 
most 
important 
veteran 
healthcare bills that this Chamber has 
considered in decades. 
Memorial Day was a little over a 
week ago, the day our Nation honors 
our war dead and rededicates itself for 
caring for those who sacrificed every-
thing to protect our country. Our vet-
erans deserve endless thanks, not just 
through words, but through action. 
Today, toxic chemical exposure is 
one of the most devastating health 
problems impacting our Nation’s vet-
erans. Since 2001, as many as 31⁄2 mil-
lion servicemembers—31⁄2 million—have 
been exposed to toxic smoke, including 
toxic burn pits and Agent Orange. 
Sadly, many of them are unable to get 
the care they need because of outdated 
rules within the Veterans Administra-
tion that determine eligibility for ben-
efits. 
This is long overdue for a change. It 
is something I have been advocating 
for years. And, today, I am thrilled 
that the Senate will vote to begin con-
sideration of the Honoring our PACT 
Act, which my colleagues Senator 
TESTER and Senator MORAN have done 
a great job putting together. Every sin-
gle one of us in this Chamber has heard 
from a military servicemember who 
has 
struggled 
to 
afford 
quality 
healthcare, and this is one of the best 
steps the Senate can take to improve 
the lives of those who have given their 
all for our country. 
The Honoring our PACT Act will be 
one 
of 
the 
largest 
expansions 
in 
healthcare benefits in VA history, and 
it would make sure no military service-
member exposed to toxic chemicals has 
to endure the indignity of carrying the 
burden 
of 
sickness 
and 
treatment 
alone. 
I expect today’s vote will yield 
strong bipartisan support, and once we 
are on this bill—because today is just a 
motion to proceed, not passage of the 
bill yet—there is no reason we can’t 
pass it quickly and without needless 
distraction. 
Once again, I want to thank Senators 
TESTER and MORAN for their leadership 
on this issue. This issue has been im-
portant to me. I have encouraged them, 
and they have worked so well together 
adroitly so that this bill can pass. 
I want to thank every single VSO 
that has advocated for change. And I 
want to thank prominent voices like 
Jon Stewart and John Feal—who I just 
met in my office—who have fiercely ad-
vocated for our veterans. 
We are moving forward today on this 
bill, and it is my hope we can reach 
final passage very quickly. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. Without objection, it is so or-
dered. 
RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER 
The Republican leader is recognized. 
BIDEN ADMINISTRATION 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Back in 2019, while 
running for the White House, President 
Biden made a public promise. Here is 
what he said: 
I guarantee you, we are going to end fossil 
fuels. 
I guarantee you, we are going to end fossil 
fuels. 
Once in office, he wasted no time 
starting down that path, and now 
working families are paying the price. 
During the previous administration, 
under Republican policies, our Nation 
became a net exporter of oil for the 
first time literally in decades. We were 
producing all that we needed and then 
some. The headlines under this all- 
Democratic-controlled government are 
quite different. 
Here are two from January 2021, right 
out of the gate: ‘‘Biden halts oil and 
gas leases [and] permits on US land and 
water.’’ Here is another: ‘‘Biden Order 
Blocks Keystone XL Pipeline.’’ Janu-
ary 2021. 
Here are the headlines more recently. 
From a few weeks ago: ‘‘Biden pulls 3 
offshore oil lease sales, curbing new 
drilling this year.’’ From just this past 
week: ‘‘Biden EPA to make it easier for 
states to block fossil fuel projects.’’ 
So even if oil and gas producers could 
get past the Biden regulatory gauntlet 
to actually explore and produce in this 
country, they likely could not get a 
pipeline approved to move it to mar-
ket. 
President Biden is delivering the 
holy war on domestic American energy 
that he promised on the campaign 
trail. Meanwhile, energy costs and gas 
prices for American families have abso-
lutely skyrocketed. Gas prices have lit-
erally doubled since his administration 
took office. The average price at the 
pump has doubled. 
The President’s staff try to play this 
off as ‘‘Putin’s price hike.’’ How many 
times have we heard that? But the re-
ality is that prices were already climb-
ing steadily long before—long before— 
the escalation in Ukraine; up more 
than $1 per gallon before—before— 
Putin’s escalation. Prices for natural 
gas and other home heating sources 
were likewise elevated all last winter. 
Don’t count on the warmer months 
bringing much relief. Here is what the 
New York Times wrote about a month 
ago. ‘‘Get Ready,’’ the Times said, ‘‘for 
Another Energy Price Spike: High 
Electric Bills.’’ 
Already frustrated and angry about high 
gasoline prices, many Americans are being 
hit by rapidly rising electricity bills . . . the 
biggest annual increase in more than a dec-
ade. 
According to another report, ‘‘the 
Federal Energy Regulatory Commis-
sion predicts electricity prices could 
rise by as much as 233 percent over last 
summer’s power prices. 
And electricity costs aren’t the only 
problem; there is also the question of 
reliability. According to the North 
American Electric Reliability Corpora-
tion, Americans—particularly in the 
West and Midwest—should brace for po-
tentially dangerous electricity black-
outs this summer. 
Once again, you can credit Demo-
crats’ war on fossil fuels. It retired too 
many fossil fuel-powered electricity 
generators too quickly, while replacing 
them with big subsidies for less reliable 
sources of power. 
Just a few days ago, President Biden 
said that soaring gas prices were just 
part of ‘‘an incredible transition that 
will leave us less reliant on fossil 
fuels.’’ Did you hear that, American

workers? Democrats say your financial 
pain is the necessary cost to make 
America more to the liking of the rad-
ical environmental left. 
The Secretary of Energy has naively 
suggested that green energy will leave 
us in a better strategic position than 
fossil fuels. Well, maybe she is not 
aware that more than 80 percent of the 
world’s polysilicon is made in China, 
and about 80 percent of America’s rare 
earth mineral needs are met by Chinese 
imports as well. 
This is why it is such a joke for the 
administration to misuse the Defense 
Production Act to prop up solar panel 
manufacturers. They will just end up 
subsidizing Chinese suppliers upstream. 
Our stockpiles of actual military re-
quirements, like Javelin missiles and 
essential munitions, are being de-
pleted. Production of critical inputs, 
like energetics and solid rocket mo-
tors, is backed up months and even 
years. But instead of using the Defense 
Production Act for our Nation’s de-
fense, the President is using it to indi-
rectly line China’s pocket. 
Washington Democrats are hostile to 
the kinds of domestic mining and drill-
ing that we will need to produce any 
kind of energy here at home, even 
green energy. 
Last year, House Democrats proposed 
a literal dirt tax—dirt tax—that would 
crush domestic minerals and rare earth 
mining. They are so opposed to domes-
tic mining, including for critical and 
rare earth minerals, Democrats lit-
erally tried to tax—listen to this—they 
wanted to tax dirt. Tax dirt. 
So, look, this doesn’t have to be this 
way. The American people know ex-
actly what we need: an all-American 
domestic energy strategy, crude oil re-
sponsibly drilled in America, natural 
gas responsibly fracked in America, 
and more minerals and high-tech com-
ponents responsibly mined in America. 
Democrats have a different plan: less 
production and higher prices. And 
Americans are paying for it literally 
every day. 
UKRAINE 
Mr. President, now on a related mat-
ter, last month, by an overwhelming 
bipartisan margin, the Senate approved 
a package of urgent assistance for 
Ukraine. Then, over the Memorial Day 
State work period, our friends on the 
frontlines marked their 100th day of re-
sisting the latest stab of Russian ag-
gression. 
As colleagues and I can attest from 
our visit with President Zelenskyy and 
his team in Kyiv, the people of Ukraine 
continue to display incredible resil-
ience and incredible bravery. Every 
day, brave Ukrainian soldiers pay the 
ultimate sacrifice to defend the sov-
ereignty of their democratic country. 
Every day, innocent Ukrainians are 
suffering under Russia’s brutal and in-
discriminate assault. 
Over 
a 
hundred 
days 
of 
war, 
Ukraine’s resolve has remained quite 
firm. Can the same be said of the West? 
As Russia pumps more combat power 
to the front, Ukraine’s soldiers need 
more weapons. They need more power-
ful weapons, and they need longer 
range weapons to counter Russia’s of-
fensive forces from safety. We should 
not delay the provision of these life-
saving capabilities. 
Our objective is not to humiliate 
Putin but to help Ukraine defend itself. 
That is what should guide our deci-
sions, not Vladimir Putin’s ego. We 
should not be self-deterred by fears 
that Putin will escalate. Those most 
affected by the risk of escalation are 
the Ukrainians, and they are certainly 
not deterred. They are fighting for 
their lives, and Putin is already indis-
criminately leveling their cities. 
Those concerned with escalation con-
sider what Putin will do to their cities 
if he is not stopped by Ukraine. But 
some of Ukraine’s supporters here in 
the West have yet to learn the lesson. 
Some of our wealthiest NATO members 
have 
dragged 
their 
feet 
in 
greenlighting the sort of military as-
sistance our eastern flank allies have 
delivered willingly and at a tremen-
dous cost. Some eastern flank partners 
have also welcomed millions of Ukrain-
ian refugees into their countries. And 
there is more that wealthy European 
countries can do to help provide mili-
tary, economic, and humanitarian re-
lief in this time of crisis. 
Here at home, the Biden administra-
tion’s hemming and hawing and self-de-
terrence 
has 
slowly, 
incrementally 
given way to a more competent policy, 
but it has come attached to utterly in-
coherent public messaging. 
The 
Biden 
administration 
should 
clarify that it will continue to provide 
Ukraine with long-range rockets so it 
can defend itself—defend itself—from 
massive military barrages that are 
being fired from Ukrainian territory. 
The administration should clarify 
whether it will provide anti-ship mis-
siles so Ukraine can target Russian 
threats to Ukraine’s Black Sea ports 
and the critical export of Ukraine’s 
grain harvest. Putin is weaponizing 
global food shortages, and we can and 
should help the Ukrainians do some-
thing about it. Doing so will send a sig-
nal to hesitant partners that they, too, 
should be providing Ukraine with these 
critical—critical—capabilities. 
But reluctance to get Ukraine what 
it needs is particularly baffling when 
you consider what a Russian victory 
would mean for our own national secu-
rity interest. Letting a vibrant, West-
ern-facing democracy fall into Russian 
control would send the price of our own 
security operations on the continent 
literally through the roof. It would put 
America’s closest allies and trading 
partners one border closer to an auto-
cratic bully. And half a world away, it 
would tell other bullies, like the Chi-
nese Communist Party, that lawless 
conquest of their neighbors isn’t just 
possible; it is actually permitted. 
If America and our allies aren’t will-
ing to do everything we can to help 
Ukraine win before it is too late, we 
will face costly, outsized consequences 
quite soon. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The clerk will call the roll. 
The bill clerk proceeded to call the 
roll. 
Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. Without objection, it is so or-
dered. 
INFLATION 
Mr. 
THUNE. 
Mr. 
President, 
the 
White House has apparently decided to 
spend June focusing on the economy. 
President Biden kicked things off 
with an op-ed in the Wall Street Jour-
nal entitled ‘‘My Plan for Fighting In-
flation.’’ 
Before he gets to the actual ‘‘plan,’’ 
though, the President spends the first 
half of the op-ed touting his supposed 
economic successes. As usual, he takes 
credit for the economy’s recovery from 
COVID-related woes, even though the 
recovery was well underway before he 
became President and was a natural re-
sult of the economy reopening after 
COVID shutdowns. 
He touts job creation figures without 
mentioning the fact that businesses are 
struggling to find workers to fill jobs. 
He touts the number of new small busi-
ness applications in 2021 without men-
tioning that small business optimism 
is at its lowest level since April 2020 at 
the height of the pandemic shutdowns. 
And he mentions ‘‘millions of Ameri-
cans getting jobs with better pay,’’ 
while leaving out the fact that infla-
tion 
continues 
to 
outstrip 
wage 
growth, meaning that, on average, 
Americans are experiencing a de facto 
pay cut. 
In all, he spends multiple paragraphs 
attempting to convince Americans that 
the economy is thriving, which I have 
to think feels pretty meaningless to 
the millions of Americans struggling 
with massive increases in the cost of 
gas, groceries, and other everyday 
goods. 
In fact, a poll released yesterday 
found that just 27 percent of Americans 
believe they have a good chance of im-
proving their standard of living, and it 
is no wonder. The President can talk 
about his supposed economic achieve-
ments all he wants, but that means lit-
tle to Americans who have seen their 
disposable income eaten up by price 
hikes or whose raise failed to keep 
even pace with the increase in the cost 
of living. 
And, of course, the President com-
pletely omits the fact that it was his 
economic plans that helped create our 
current inflation crisis in the first 
place. When President Biden took of-
fice, inflation was at 1.4 percent, well 
within the Federal Reserve’s target in-
flation rate of 2 percent. Today, it is at 
8.3 percent, near a 40-year high. 
And how did we get from there to 
here? In substantial part, via the Presi-
dent’s so-called American Rescue Plan. 
Democrats’ massive partisan spending 
spree flooded the economy with unnec-
essary government money, and the

June 7, 2022 
economy overheated as a result. But 
that is not something the President 
mentions when he talks about fighting 
inflation. 
So what is the President’s so-called 
plan to fight inflation? 
Well, after spending half the op-ed 
touting his supposed economic suc-
cesses, the President finally gets to the 
plan part, and the first part of his 
three-part plan involves having some-
one else address inflation. Controlling 
inflation, the President says, is pri-
marily the job of the Federal Reserve, 
and he is going to leave them alone to 
do that job. 
The next part of the President’s plan 
involves things like fixing broken sup-
ply chains and boosting the productive 
capacity of our economy over time. 
Now, I am a big supporter of improv-
ing our supply chains, which is why I 
have introduced the Ocean Shipping 
Reform Act, which, hopefully, will pass 
the House of Representatives and head 
to the President’s desk soon. But given 
that the President has so far dem-
onstrated little progress in addressing 
supply chain challenges, I am not hold-
ing my breath waiting for the White 
House to take action. 
I am also a big fan of boosting the 
productive capacity of our economy. 
My concern is that the President fails 
to give any examples of how he might 
actually do that. He mentions high gas 
prices, but instead of talking about 
ways to address high energy prices by 
unleashing American energy produc-
tion, he pivots to touting his release 
from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, 
a highly temporary band aid that did 
next to nothing to address the cause of 
high gas prices, except for briefly caus-
ing their rise to what are record highs. 
He also claims Congress can help by 
passing his clean-energy tax credits 
and investments—which he says would 
result in a $500 decrease in utility bills 
for American families. First, nothing 
about the President’s clean-energy tax 
credits is likely to drive down energy 
prices, especially in the near term, and 
Americans can’t afford to wait. 
In fact, for Americans to take advan-
tage of some of these credits, they 
would need to spend more money—on 
an electric car, for example—which is 
how the administration suggests Amer-
icans deal with these historic gas 
prices. 
And the President’s claim that his 
energy tax credits and investments 
would decrease utility bills for Amer-
ican families by $500 is 100 percent 
false. 
And you don’t have to take my word 
for it. The Washington Post Fact 
Checker column gave the President’s 
claim four—four Pinocchios—a rating 
that the Post reserves for, and I quote, 
‘‘whoppers.’’ 
And if the President has the idea 
that his tax credits can somehow magi-
cally move the United States to a place 
that we can abandon gas and oil over-
night, well, he has another thing com-
ing. No matter how much Democrats 
might wish it were otherwise, the fact 
of the matter is that clean energy tech-
nology has simply not advanced to the 
point where we can replace all tradi-
tional energy resources with renew-
ables. And pretending—pretending that 
we don’t need gas and oil—or discour-
aging American oil and gas production 
will only result in higher energy prices 
for American consumers. 
If the President really wanted to re-
duce gas prices and ‘‘boost the produc-
tive capacity of our economy over 
time,’’ as he said in his op-ed, he would 
embrace American energy production, 
including conventional energy produc-
tion. 
Instead, he is doing the opposite. He 
continues to discourage domestic pro-
duction of conventional energy sources 
that Americans rely on. And the result 
is likely to be continued high energy 
prices well into the future. 
Finally, the President turns to the 
third part of his plan to fight inflation, 
and that is reducing the deficit. Unfor-
tunately, it is a little hard to take the 
President seriously on this issue. The 
President touts a Congressional Budget 
Office prediction that the deficit will 
fall by $1.7 trillion this year. 
What the President doesn’t mention 
is that the reason this year’s projected 
deficit drop looks so substantial is be-
cause Democrats inflated the deficit 
last year with their American Rescue 
Plan spending spree. Of course, the def-
icit will look lower this year without a 
massive $1.9 trillion piece of legislation 
financed entirely with deficit spending. 
And I am not getting my hopes up 
about future deficit drops, since many 
Democrats still want to use reconcili-
ation rules to force through another 
big, party-line Democrat spending bill. 
This one is $5 trillion. If they come up 
with a proposal that is anything like 
their original Build Back Better pro-
posal, we will undoubtedly be looking 
at more deficit spending. 
One news outlet had this to say about 
President Biden’s op-ed and his plan to 
reduce the deficit: 
Is it really a ‘plan’ when the President 
points fingers? While the president’s op-ed 
purports to lay out a plan for addressing in-
flation, a close read shows that he actually 
seems to be pushing the burden off on others 
. . . 
That is a fair assessment. Unfortu-
nately, it is pretty par for the course 
for President Biden. He is happy to 
take credit for positive economic num-
bers even when he had nothing to do 
with them, but when it comes to tak-
ing responsibility for a situation, he is 
frequently nowhere to be found. 
He won’t acknowledge that his own 
economic proposal, the American Res-
cue Plan, helped create our inflation 
crisis in the first place. Indeed, he 
largely ignored the inflation crisis 
until it started to become absolutely 
necessary for him to address it, if he 
wanted to survive politically. 
And he has displayed a similar lack 
of ownership of crises on his watch. 
The actions he has taken to weaken 
border security and immigration en-
forcement have helped create an un-
precedented immigration crisis on the 
southern border. 
But from the President’s attitude 
you barely even know that there is a 
problem, much less one that he has a 
particular responsibility to address. 
His hostile attitude toward American 
energy production helped drive up gas 
prices and left families struggling— 
struggling—to fill their cars. Yet the 
President is ready to push off responsi-
bility for conventional energy produc-
tion to other nations, leaving our Na-
tion less secure and even more vulner-
able to price spikes. 
The President closes his op-ed by 
noting: 
The economic policy choices we make 
today will determine whether a sustained re-
covery that benefits all Americans is pos-
sible. 
Well, the President is right about 
that. Unfortunately, it is pretty clear 
that the economic policy choices that 
he is making are wrong. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Ms. 
ROSEN). The clerk will call the roll. 
The bill clerk proceeded to call the 
roll. 
Mr. TESTER. Madam President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
PACT ACT OF 2021 
Mr. 
TESTER. 
Madam 
President, 
today is an important day. This is the 
day that we are going to take up toxic 
exposure in the U.S. Senate. It is a day 
that, quite frankly, should have been 
two decades ago, three decades ago, 
five decades ago, but we are where we 
are. 
The bill we are going to be consid-
ering is the SFC Heath Robinson Hon-
oring Our PACT Act. This bill is the 
most comprehensive toxic exposure 
package for veterans Congress has ever 
considered and hopefully I can say has 
ever delivered. It has literally been 
years in the making. 
I am especially proud of this bill be-
cause it addresses decades of inaction 
and failure by our government to do 
the right thing by the men and women 
who have served this country in uni-
form and stood in harm’s way. 
I want to thank my friend and rank-
ing member of the Senate Veterans’ Af-
fairs Committee, JERRY
MORAN, for 
being able to work together across the 
aisle to deliver what is truly a bipar-
tisan bill that will give veterans of all 
eras the benefits that they have earned 
but maybe even more importantly, the 
benefits that they deserve. 
As chairman of the Senate Veterans’ 
Affairs Committee, there have been few 
issues as important as this one is to 
me. It has been a top priority of mine 
since I first came to Congress and 
started hearing from veterans, their 
families, their advocates, and veterans 
service organizations about exposures

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2799 
June 7, 2022 
to chemical, physical, and environ-
mental hazards as they serve this coun-
try in the line of duty. So let’s talk 
about military toxic exposures and 
why we are here today. 
In World War I, there was a thing 
called mustard gas. In World War II, we 
had radiation. In Vietnam, we had 
Agent Orange. Now we have burn pits— 
massive areas used to dispose of plas-
tics, rubber, jet fuel, and other chemi-
cals in Iraq and Afghanistan and other 
locations around the globe. 
Generation 
after 
generation, 
war 
after war, servicemembers have re-
turned home, only to face yet another 
battle here at home when seeking the 
care and the benefits that they have 
earned and that they desperately need 
because Washington—we, Congress— 
has been unwilling, simply unwilling to 
give the Department of Veterans Af-
fairs the tools they need to take care of 
our veterans. Our men in uniform an-
swered the call of duty. They held up 
their end of the bargain, so we need to 
hold up ours. 
I will never forget what I heard from 
a Vietnam veteran in Montana my very 
first year on the VA Committee. I was 
holding a townhall meeting. This gen-
tleman stood up in the back of the 
room at the townhall, and he said: You 
are not going to treat this generation 
of veterans the way you treated us, the 
Vietnam veterans. 
I remember it because it hit home 
with me. I remember those Vietnam 
soldiers coming home. I remember the 
stories of toxic exposure to Agent Or-
ange. I remember how we knew what 
we needed to do, but, man, it took us a 
long time to get stuff done. In fact, we 
still are dealing with Agent Orange, 
and it is dealt in this bill with hyper-
tension. 
But here we are today treating this 
generation of veterans just like we 
treated the Vietnam veterans and 
other generations of veterans who have 
served this country. As a result of 
turning a blind eye on the needs of our 
veterans, they have died, they have 
died, and they have died due to toxic 
exposure. 
Here are the facts. More than 31⁄2 mil-
lion post-9/11 veterans may have been 
exposed to toxic substances overseas 
during their time in uniform. Seventy- 
five percent of those men and women 
report being exposed to burn pits. As a 
result of these exposures, many vet-
erans suffered from rare, deadly can-
cers, respiratory conditions, and other 
illnesses—let me say it again: rare but 
deadly cancers and respiratory condi-
tions and other illness—sometimes de-
veloping years after they served in the 
military. 
Now, it is easy for me to stand up 
here and talk about cancer—I don’t 
have it; at least I don’t think I have 
it—and talk about respiratory condi-
tions. I don’t have to gasp for air. But 
the truth is, because of these men and 
women’s service to this country in the 
Middle East and their exposures to tox-
ins, they have developed these illnesses 
or if what happens with all the past 
ones, they will develop them in the fu-
ture. Because of that, today, hundreds 
of thousands are going without the 
care and the benefits they need to treat 
these conditions. 
By the way, we are still not address-
ing Agent Orange for veterans suffering 
from 
conditions 
like 
hypertension, 
where the science is clear, and in the 
worst cases, folks are paying with their 
lives. 
Veterans and heroes like SFC Heath 
Robinson, 
for 
whom 
this 
bill 
is 
named—Heath deployed to Kosovo and 
Iraq with the Ohio National Guard, was 
exposed to burn pits, and he died. He 
died in 2020 from toxic exposure. SFC 
Heath Robinson—he was a son; he was 
a husband; he was a father. In fact, we 
heard from his daughter this morning 
at a press conference that Senator 
MORAN was at—a beautiful little girl 
who, in her words, said: I love my dad. 
But yet we didn’t step up. The country 
failed to deliver for him, and we also 
failed to deliver for his family. The sit-
uation has happened with far, far, far 
too much regularity, and that is why 
we are here dealing with this bill. 
The SFC Heath Robinson Honoring 
Our PACT Act will right the wrong for 
our past, for our present, and for our 
future veterans. Here is how it is done: 
This bill will expand eligibility for 
VA healthcare to more than 31⁄2 million 
combat veterans exposed to burn pits 
since 9/11. 
By the way, when I was in Afghani-
stan and we were flying around with 
my good friend Jim Webb when he was 
in this body, we flew to the bases based 
on the smoke coming out of these burn 
pits. 
The toxic exposure was real, it hap-
pened, and it happened to 3.5 million 
combat veterans exposed to since 9/11. 
It will support our post-9/11 and Viet-
nam-era veterans by removing the bur-
den of proof for 23 presumptive condi-
tions caused by toxic exposure, from 
cancers to lung disease. It will also es-
tablish a framework for the establish-
ment of future presumptions of service 
connection related to toxic exposures. 
What does this mean? It means that we 
have had toxic exposures for over 100 
years and maybe even before that, and 
it has taken an act of Congress to get 
these folks the benefits they need. Now 
we are giving the VA the mechanism to 
deal with toxic exposure. 
It will give the VA the tools it needs 
to bolster its workforce, to establish 
more healthcare facilities, to improve 
claims processing, and to better meet 
the immediate and future needs of 
every veteran our VA serves. 
The bottom line is, this bill is far too 
important for this country and for 
those who fought to protect it. 
When it comes to our fighting men 
and women, when it comes to sending 
our folks off to war, we never talk 
about money; we just do it because we 
think it is the right thing to do. They 
are coming back. This bill is going to 
cost $287.6 billion over 10 years, so it is 
a big-ticket item. But the fact is, we 
sent them off to war. We told them we 
were going to take care of them when 
they came back home. There shouldn’t 
be a debate about the money. 
I would agree that we should try to 
figure out ways to pay for as much 
stuff in this body as we can, but the 
truth is, freedom is not free. There is a 
price to pay when we send our men and 
women in uniform to fight wars on our 
behalf, and you don’t have to be a vet-
eran or be exposed to Agent Orange or 
burn pits to understand that price. 
We have been waging war for far too 
long, and now, right now, veterans 
across this country are the ones paying 
for that cost of war, and we can’t wait 
any longer. No more empty promises. 
We have a unique opportunity to make 
history with the passage of this com-
prehensive toxic exposure package that 
will recognize our veterans’ service and 
their sacrifice. We are too close to fail. 
It is time for this body to act. It is 
time we address the true cost of war. 
Our Nation’s veterans and their fami-
lies are counting on it. 
I want to close with one thing. This 
is a big bill. I have been in this body 
long enough to know that if there is a 
big bill, you can always find a reason 
to vote against it, and you can always 
find a reason to vote for it. This is 
more important. If we are going to 
take into account the future of our 
fighting men and women, the future of 
this All-Volunteer military we have, 
the future of the people who have been 
hit by toxic exposure, the future of our 
Vietnam veterans with Agent Orange 
exposure, this is too important to find 
a reason to vote against it. This is 
doing right by our fighting men and 
women in this country. This is doing 
right by our military. This is doing 
right for freedom and democracy. 
Our Nation’s veterans deserve this, 
and maybe just as important, our Na-
tion’s veterans’ families deserve pas-
sage of this bill. 
With that, I will yield the floor to 
the ranking member, Senator MORAN. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Kansas. 
Mr. MORAN. Madam President, I ask 
unanimous consent to speak up to 
whatever additional minutes necessary 
for me to complete my remarks before 
the 11:30 vote. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
Mr. MORAN. Madam President, I cer-
tainly rise this morning, going into 
this afternoon, in advance of a vote on 
a motion to proceed, a cloture vote, on 
the SFC Heath Robinson Honoring Our 
Promise to Address Comprehensive 
Toxics Act of 2022, and I would call 
upon my colleagues to do the same 
thing. 
I appreciate what I just heard from 
the chairman of the Senate Committee 
on Veterans’ Affairs and how he made 
the case for why this is important leg-
islation and why we have little excuse 
not to see its success here in the next 
few days.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2800 
June 7, 2022 
I mentioned last night when I spoke 
on the Senate floor that I am not a vet-
eran. I mentioned that my experience 
in high school in seeing those who are 
just a year or two older than me re-
turning from their service in Vietnam 
caused me to reach a conclusion that I 
would do everything I could in my life 
to compensate for the ill treatment 
those men and women returning from 
service in Southeast Asia received 
from their fellow Americans. I was 
going to pay respect. I was going to 
honor them. I was going to say thank 
you. That is what a 16-year-old kid 
thought he should do to make certain 
that we compensate for those who 
served our country and deserved some-
thing better than what they received. 
I never envisioned being a Member of 
the U.S. Senate, never thought that 
was something that would happen to 
me in my life, but because I now serve 
in this capacity, I have an obligation 
to do much more than saying thank 
you. There is nothing wrong—it is a 
good thing to tell those who served 
‘‘Thank you. I appreciate your service. 
I respect you,’’ but that is just the be-
ginning. 
Certainly, as a member of the Senate 
Veterans’ Affairs Committee and a 
Member of the U.S. Senate, I and all 
my colleagues owe those who served in 
Vietnam and every other battle of our 
Nation more than just saying thank 
you. 
My guess is that nearly all of us, the 
100 of us, probably said these words at 
services across our States on Memorial 
Day weekend. We have said it hundreds 
of times: ‘‘Thank you for your serv-
ice.’’ I will continue to say ‘‘thank you 
for your service’’ hundreds and hun-
dreds of times myself. 
But this week we have the oppor-
tunity to do something significantly 
more and that is to actually provide 
the benefits that men and women who 
served in Vietnam and who served in 
Iraq and Afghanistan and around the 
globe—the benefits they are entitled to 
and the benefits which they des-
perately need. 
We were with a group of veterans— 
certainly a group of veteran organiza-
tions—this morning on the Capitol 
lawn, and, to my knowledge, every vet-
erans service organization, every orga-
nization that represents veterans is 
asking us to pass this legislation. But 
I also was surrounded by family mem-
bers and veterans themselves who have 
experienced horrendous circumstances 
in their lives and their families’ lives 
as a result of exposure to Agent Orange 
in Vietnam and toxic burn pits in Iraq 
and Afghanistan. 
And you can see the challenge that 
people face in their lives because of 
their service. And we no longer have 
the capability, if we ever did, to say: 
No, we can’t help you yet; we will wait 
for—we will wait for more science, 
more medicine; we will wait until the 
Department of Veterans Affairs com-
pletes another study. 
We can’t wait because they can’t 
wait. 
During my time at home over that 
Memorial Day weekend, a Navy vet-
eran said he and his father were both 
exposed to toxic exposures in their 
service to their country and, to their 
knowledge, they have no consequences, 
no physical ailments that resulted 
from that. But they said: Every day we 
worry 
about 
it 
because 
we 
don’t 
think—we don’t know that if we do de-
velop those symptoms, that the De-
partment of Veterans Affairs and, real-
ly, the American people are going to be 
there to take care of us. So every day 
of our lives, knowing that we have been 
exposed to toxic substances during our 
military service—every day we wonder, 
if something does develop, what is 
going to happen to our spouse? what is 
going to happen to our kids? what is 
going to happen to me, the person who 
served, if we don’t know that the VA, 
the Department of Veterans Affairs, is 
going to be there with the benefits that 
we need to care for ourselves, our 
health, and our family members? 
The bill that we take up today is a 
culmination of years of work, and peo-
ple across the country have come to 
their 
Congress 
over 
those 
years, 
knocked on our doors, made phone 
calls, and asked us: Please do some-
thing to take care of someone we love 
who has been exposed to these terrible 
substances and causing death and ill 
health in their lives. 
So, across the Senate, many of us 
have introduced legislation over those 
years, legislation in recent years, and 
with the leadership of our Senate Vet-
erans’ 
Affairs 
Committee, 
we 
had 
begun the process of sorting out bills 
that our colleagues were asking us to 
pass to deal with toxic exposure, and 
now we have combined the best of 
those pieces of legislation from many 
Members of our Senate, members of 
our committee, into the Heath Robin-
son Act. 
We 
have 
incorporated 
important 
fixes to the House version of this bill. 
We have worked to make sure the miti-
gation—this has been one of my con-
cerns from the beginning is how do we 
take care of a lot more veterans who 
desperately need to be cared for and 
not disadvantage other veterans who 
are already waiting in line for services 
at the Department? And we have 
worked to mitigate, to reduce, to 
eliminate those disruptions in VA oper-
ations. 
We have streamlined the disability 
claims process for toxic-exposed vet-
erans. We have prescribed a lasting 
framework for the future VA decisions 
that is transparent and driven by sci-
entific evidence, all with the effort and 
hopefully the consequence of not nega-
tively impacting veterans already in 
our system. This lasting framework is 
a win for veterans, requiring the VA to 
be proactive in evaluating diseases for 
service connections. 
We have had the opportunity, over a 
long period of time, to say: Well, the 
VA has the authority to take care of 
you. That really wasn’t a very good ex-
planation because it never seemed to 
happen fast enough, and in the process 
of us waiting on the Department of 
Veterans Affairs to act, more and more 
service men and women became ill and 
too many died waiting for a result. 
With this bill before us today, we are 
called to act for veterans, and we 
should answer that call. The Heath 
Robinson Act is a solution for a prob-
lem that has plagued veterans for too 
long and left way too many families ei-
ther uncertain about whether they 
would be cared for or actually left 
them without the care they des-
perately need. This is a responsible ap-
proach to fix a broken system that has 
been cobbled together through decades 
of patchwork fixes. As we all tried to 
do something, we never got enough ac-
complished. But we tried, and we have 
put this patchwork system together 
that has failed those who need our 
help. This legislation is our chance to 
make certain that future generations 
of toxic-exposed veterans can get the 
healthcare and disability compensation 
that they deserve without delay. 
Every member of the Senate Com-
mittee on Veterans’ Affairs has voted 
for the original bill in front of our com-
mittee, now nearly a year ago. The bill 
was passed out of committee with the 
understanding that Senator TESTER 
and I would work to find some fixes to 
problems that people recognized. In my 
view, both Republicans and Democrats 
had concerns about certain aspects of 
this legislation, and we have now spent 
the last year and particularly the last 
several months trying to fine-tune this 
bill in a way that certainly reduces 
some damage and fixes the process, in-
creases the assets in personnel and re-
sources that the Department of Vet-
erans Affairs has for determining dis-
ability 
claims 
and 
for 
providing 
healthcare for those who serve. This is 
a better bill as a result of our efforts, 
and I thank Chairman TESTER and my 
committee colleagues for their part-
nership and work to get us where we 
are today. 
There was a lady on the Capitol lawn 
this morning in the group that Senator 
TESTER and I spoke to, and she was 
telling me that her husband was ex-
posed to toxic substances in the Middle 
East, that he is experiencing growing 
symptoms of challenges as a result of 
that exposure. He is waiting to see 
whether this bill passes, and he is hop-
ing that even if he is the last veteran 
alive to see the legislation passed that 
he will have accomplished something 
that is important for him because he 
will pass knowing that the problems he 
is creating for his family due to his 
service are being addressed. 
There is sadness in that, that one 
who is challenged by these conditions 
wants to know that we have done our 
job so that he can know he has done his 
job as a father and a husband. Today 
begins the day in which we can dem-
onstrate that we are capable of doing 
our job, and I ask all of my Republican 
and Democratic colleagues to join me

H.R. 3967 
Mr. KELLY. Madam President, it is 
past due for us to address veterans not 
getting the care they need after suf-
fering an illness caused by toxic expo-
sure. We can do that as soon as this 
week by passing the PACT Act. 
As a retired naval aviator, I know 
firsthand the sacrifice and hard work it 
takes to succeed in our military. I 
knew I wanted to join the military 
from a young age, and after attending 
the U.S. Merchant Marine Academy, 
making that choice was easy for me. 
That is the case for some but not for 
everyone. Many more will say that this 
was the hardest decision that they had 
to make, putting families, school, ca-
reers, or all three through major 
changes in order to serve. 
This is a sacrifice for so many, and 
regardless of how someone comes to 
serving, what follows isn’t easy. We 
spend years training to go to war. For 
me, that was training to fly off of and 
land on an aircraft carrier and put 
bombs on enemy targets. That is what 
I did during Operation Desert Storm, 
flying combat missions off the USS 
Midway in the gulf, to deliver weapons 
on dozens of targets in Iraq and Ku-
wait. 
War is by its very nature dangerous, 
and flying airplanes in combat or con-
ducting ground combat operations is 
very complex. You need to focus on 
completing the mission while also fo-
cusing on your safety and that of your 
team or your crew. There are many op-
portunities to be killed or injured. We 
all get that. The public understands

that. But there are also silent killers 
that affected soldiers, sailors, marines, 
and airmen who served abroad. 
No American soldier goes overseas 
and expects to be put in grave danger 
by their own military, but they were. 
We saw it in Vietnam with Agent Or-
ange. We saw it in the first gulf war 
with toxic exposures that we are still 
grappling to fully understand. It hap-
pened again starting about 20 years ago 
when American soldiers in Iraq and Af-
ghanistan were breathing in toxic 
smoke from American-made burn pits. 
Clouds of smoke containing plastics, 
rubber, medical waste, and chemicals 
billowed, and although the ‘‘stink’’ 
might have been a nuisance, the true 
physiological damage would turn out 
to be much worse. 
We sent young, healthy, and highly 
capable American troops—all of whom 
volunteered—overseas. 
When 
they 
came home, they got sick, and then 
they got sicker, just like in the case of 
SFC Heath Robinson, whose namesake 
and story are behind the PACT Act. 
Our servicemembers had put every-
thing on the line, only to return with 
severe illnesses due to bad decisions. 
When those same servicemembers bat-
tling rare diseases filed claims with the 
VA, they were met with a closed door. 
They were told that it wasn’t a service- 
connected illness, so it wasn’t covered. 
This is shameful, and it is unaccept-
able. That is why this legislation is so 
important. Our military made mis-
takes, and thousands of Americans and 
more than 6,500 Arizonans have paid or 
are continuing to pay the price. 
We must—we must—live up to our 
solemn obligation to look after our 
veterans, and that is what the PACT 
Act will do. This bill will lower the 
threshold for veterans to receive bene-
fits, expand access to VA healthcare, 
strengthen the VA’s ability to process 
claims, create pathways for future pre-
sumptions based on developing medical 
research, and much more. 
So, together, let’s get this bill across 
the finish line for our veterans and 
their families. They deserve better 
from Washington. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Ohio. 
Mr. BROWN. Madam President, I 
want to reiterate and underscore and 
expand on some of the comments made 
by Senator KELLY from Arizona in sup-
port of this legislation. 
We know that, as he said, our serv-
icemembers put their lives and health 
on the line to keep us safe. Even those 
who come home can face long-term 
health risks from their service. Too 
often, we have not provided veterans 
the care and the benefits they have 
earned and deserve, particularly those 
exposed to toxic substances while serv-
ing in uniform. We have the oppor-
tunity this week, finally, to change 
that. 
This week in the Senate, we are on 
the verge of passing the most com-
prehensive expansion of benefits for 
veterans who faced toxic exposure, in 
our 
Nation’s 
history. 
Providing 
healthcare and benefits for veterans 
who suffer from toxic exposure is a cost 
of going to war. We are willing to spend 
a lot of money going to war, as we need 
to, but we have never, never really 
stepped up taking care of our vet-
erans—those who return home—be-
cause it is also costly, but it is what we 
need to do. 
If you were exposed—fundamentally 
this—if you were exposed to toxins 
while serving our country, you deserve 
the benefits you earned, period, no ex-
ceptions. The Senate is finally on the 
verge of recognizing that. 
My office holds roundtables with vet-
erans all over Ohio, and I have heard 
veterans raise this issue again and 
again and again. As many as 31⁄2 mil-
lion servicemembers in this country 
were 
potentially 
exposed 
to 
toxic 
smoke. Time is running out for these 
veterans. 
For years, we have worked to high-
light this long-ignored issue and the 
hurdles veterans faced after burn pits 
and, before that, exposure to Agent Or-
ange. With Agent Orange, we expanded 
VA benefits. We had to do it condition 
by condition and location of service by 
location of service, and it took way, 
way, way too long. Far too many Viet-
nam veterans suffering from toxic ex-
posure to Agent Orange died while Con-
gress continued to slow-walk the kinds 
of benefits we should have done much 
more quickly. Too many veterans were 
left behind. Our veterans deserve bet-
ter. 
This bipartisan bill would guarantee 
that veterans who suffer because of 
toxic exposure will get the VA benefits 
they earned for the first time in our 
country’s history. It would finally ex-
tend VA healthcare eligibility to all 
post-9/11 combat veterans. It would ex-
pand presumptions for veterans ex-
posed to Agent Orange. It would add 23 
burn pit- and toxic exposure-related 
conditions to VA’s list. 
The 
comprehensive 
legislation 
is 
named in honor of Ohio veteran SFC 
Heath 
Robinson, 
who 
deployed 
to 
Kosovo and Iraq with the Ohio Na-
tional Guard. He passed away in 2020 
from cancer as a result of toxic expo-
sure during that military service. 
His widow, Danielle Robinson, has 
been a determined advocate for this 
cause. She was the First Lady’s guest 
at the State of the Union this year, to 
underscore the President’s commit-
ment to getting this done. 
Her mother, Susan Zeier, and Heath’s 
daughter, 
Brielle, 
Susan’s 
grand-
daughter, are here this week, along 
with so many advocates from Ohio, 
like Andrea Neutzling, an Army vet-
eran and advocate from Meigs County. 
Earlier today, Susan and her grand-
daughter, Brielle, the daughter of 
Heath Robinson, and Andrea and Tim 
and others from Ohio were in the Gal-
lery. They are counting on the Senate 
to finally do the right thing. 
This has been a long time coming. It 
will mean that more than 3 million 
toxic-exposed 
veterans 
will 
finally 
have the expanded access to healthcare 
which they deserve and which they 
earned. It is a good first step. It is late 
for veterans who have suffered for 
years. 
I ask my colleagues to join me in fi-
nally keeping our promise to our vet-
erans. We should never forget the debt 
we owe our veterans, and we are hum-
bled by their commitment to service. It 
is time that we ensure that our vet-
erans, after sacrificing so much for our 
country, receive the full benefits and 
care that they deserve and that they 
earned. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Alaska. 
BRUCE’S LAW 
Ms. MURKOWSKI. Madam President, 
I have come to the floor this afternoon 
to speak about a measure that I will be 
introducing this week with my col-
league from California, Senator FEIN-
STEIN. 
We 
have 
entitled 
this 
bill 
Bruce’s Law in memory of a young 
Alaskan, Robert ‘‘Bruce’’ Snodgrass, 
who passed away in Anchorage last Oc-
tober. 
Bruce is the son of Sandy Snodgrass. 
Sandy is with us here today in the Sen-
ate Gallery. 
Bruce and Sandy lived in California 
when Bruce was younger before moving 
back to Alaska. Sandy likes to describe 
Alaska as Bruce’s true home. 
Bruce was a good kid. He was a good 
kid, but, like many good kids, he strug-
gled with alcoholism, he struggled with 
drug addiction, and he and his family 
were far too familiar with this, as his 
grandfather and his father died of the 
same addictions. And despite all of 
this, Bruce started using drugs as a 
teenager, and it really sent his life into 
a downward spiral. But Sandy was al-
ways there. Mom was always there pro-
viding a safe and a comfortable home, 
and yet he was arrested repeatedly and 
ultimately wound up homeless. 
But then, last summer—last summer, 
things turned around. Bruce made the 
choice to get clean. He wanted to get 
his life on track, and Sandy was right 
there, ready to help, as any good mom 
would be. She got Bruce to a detox fa-
cility and then into a local inpatient 
program for treatment. He graduated 
from it, and he moved back home. He 
was able to spend his time at out-
patient meetings. He was in coun-
seling. He liked to ride his mountain 
bike. He received this after he had 
completed the treatment program. 
But then, one day last October, Bruce 
went out for a bike ride, and Sandy re-
members telling him before he went, 
she said, ‘‘Be careful out there.’’ But 
Bruce never came back. He never came 
home. 
On October 20, Bruce’s body was 
found in a grocery store parking lot, 
and just like that—just like that—sud-
denly, heart-wrenchingly, and after 
trying so hard to overcome his demons, 
he was gone—just gone forever. 
And so we grieve with Sandy, who 
lost her only son that day. No parent—

no parent—should have to bear what 
she is going through. 
But the details of Bruce’s death are 
especially tragic because Bruce died 
from 
an 
accidental 
overdose 
of 
fentanyl. 
Fentanyl 
is 
a 
synthetic 
opioid that is 50 times more powerful 
than heroin, 100 times stronger than 
morphine, and it is relatively cheap, 
easy to make. It makes it attractive 
for drug dealers, but it is also just in-
credibly, 
incredibly 
dangerous 
for 
those who come into contact with it. 
Just 2 milligrams, which would fit on 
the end of a pencil, can cause a fatal 
overdose. This is how the Justice De-
partment describes it: 
Fentanyl powder has the power to kill with 
the ingestion, inhalation, or skin absorption 
of just two milligrams. By comparison, a 
sweetener packet found on a restaurant ta-
bletop generally contains 1,000 milligrams 
per packet. 
So just to give you an idea of how 
small a deadly amount can be, a single 
pill, 
with 
just 
trace 
amounts 
of 
fentanyl, can be fatal to the average 
person, which has prompted the Drug 
Enforcement Administration to start a 
campaign that they call a ‘‘One Pill 
Can Kill.’’ This campaign is designed to 
raise public awareness here. 
Now, there is a form of fentanyl that 
is carefully and precisely manufac-
tured. It is prescribed for medical pa-
tients who may be in extreme pain, 
like those who are suffering from late- 
stage cancer. And doctors know—they 
know that they have to be exceedingly 
judicious with their prescription of this 
pharmaceutical fentanyl. But it is this 
other form—the illegal fentanyl—that 
is being made in underground labs and 
sold on the streets. 
Illegal fentanyl is often laced into 
counterfeit pills that are made to look 
like Oxycodone or other frequently 
used and abused opioids. The fake pills 
are difficult to distinguish from the 
real thing without specialized tests be-
cause they are deliberately made to 
look like them. 
According to law enforcement au-
thorities, about 40 percent of those 
pills—of these counterfeit pills—con-
tain a potentially lethal amount of 
fentanyl. 
So you buy a pill, you think it is a 
frequently abused opioid that you have 
taken before, but over 40 percent— 
about 40 percent of these counterfeit 
pills can contain a potentially lethal 
amount of fentanyl. 
Some drug traffickers are also adding 
fentanyl into heroin, into meth, into 
cocaine; and it makes these drugs even 
more deadly, since fentanyl is indistin-
guishable in its powder form. If you 
look 
at 
a 
picture of heroin and 
fentanyl, you cannot tell the dif-
ference. But fentanyl’s presence might 
be the difference between life and 
death. 
It was an official from New Hamp-
shire who said, a couple years ago: You 
don’t know what you are taking. You 
are injecting yourself with a loaded 
gun. 
Now, 
most 
people 
would 
avoid 
fentanyl if they knew what it was ca-
pable of doing to them, but oftentimes 
they don’t even know. They don’t 
know. They have never heard of it or 
they don’t know enough about it or, 
again, they think that they are buying 
a name-brand prescription pill, not 
some deadly knock off. 
It is now fueling a nationwide crisis 
with terrible, terrible impacts in every 
State in the country. 
A few weeks ago, the Wall Street 
Journal reported that drug overdose 
deaths likely reached more than 107,000 
in America last year, an all-time high 
and an increase of 15 percent from just 
2020. 
Roughly 
two-thirds 
of 
those 
deaths were attributable to synthetic 
opioids, led by fentanyl, with an in-
crease of 23 percent year over year. So 
we are just seeing this skyrocket. 
An official with the CDC is quoted in 
that Wall Street Journal story as say-
ing, ‘‘We’ve never seen anything like 
this.’’ ‘‘We’ve never seen anything like 
this.’’ And he is right; we haven’t. Nor 
are we ready to fight it. Fentanyl is 
flowing into America largely from 
China and Mexico, and it is coming in 
at an unprecedented rate—so much so 
that it recently became the leading 
cause of death for Americans aged 18 to 
45, and this was in the midst of the 
pandemic, when we were seeing deaths 
in other areas, but it became the lead-
ing cause of death for young Ameri-
cans. 
And no one—no one—has been spared 
by this growing epidemic. I wish that I 
could say in Alaska, we are far enough 
away, we are remote; but, no. I have 
shared Bruce’s story with you, but he 
is not the only one. Opioid-related 
deaths 
in 
Alaska, 
mostly 
from 
fentanyl, rose by 71 percent between 
2020 and 2021. In my State of Alaska, it 
rose by 71 percent. It now accounts for 
about 60 percent of the drug overdose 
deaths in Alaska. 
Our law enforcement authorities rou-
tinely are intercepting packages with 
fentanyl. They are finding it in An-
chorage, they are finding it in Ketch-
ikan, in other places in the State. 
In April, the Alaska High Intensity 
Drug Trafficking Area Initiative—this 
is what we call the HIDTA initiative— 
had its largest-ever seizure, worth an 
estimated $356,000. Our Governor’s of-
fice has estimated that the 1,244 grams 
of fentanyl seized in January, Feb-
ruary, March of this year, 2022, could 
kill 622,000 Alaskans—622,000 Alaskans. 
That is about 84 percent of our State’s 
population. Think about that. In 3 
months—in 3 months—the amount of 
fentanyl seized could kill 622,000 Alas-
kans or about 84 percent of our State’s 
population. This is awful. This is a 
tragedy at every level. 
This is also an epidemic of the young, 
and I am looking to the young people 
on this floor because I want you to 
hear how frightening, how deadly, 
fentanyl is. According to the Alaska 
Department of Health and Human 
Services, drug overdose deaths rose by 
25 percent among Alaskans aged 15 to 
24 last year—so, basically, your age 
category—and by a staggering 200 per-
cent in young Alaskans between the 
ages of 25 and 34. It is devastating be-
cause behind those numbers are real 
people, like Sandy’s son, like Bruce 
Snodgrass, who should have celebrated 
his 23rd birthday just last week. We 
had beautiful, beautiful weather in An-
chorage. I saw Sandy. She reminded me 
of Bruce’s birthday. And you look 
around and you think about that young 
man lost, gone—gone. 
At least six individuals in the Mat-Su 
Valley who were killed by fentanyl- 
laced heroin in March made news in 
the paper—all just in one story. So, so 
many others killed, gone—gone. 
In the wake of Bruce’s death, Sandy 
has said that she was in shock for sev-
eral months, which is entirely under-
standable. But since then—since then— 
she has decided to tell her story, share 
her heartache, in hopes that other 
moms won’t lose their sons, and so she 
is an advocate. She is an advocate with 
every ounce of her being, and it is 
thanks to her that we are introducing 
Bruce’s law. 
Bruce’s Law starts with education 
and awareness, requiring the Federal 
Government to create a nationwide 
campaign against fentanyl for school- 
aged children, young adults, parents, 
first responders, and care providers. 
The campaign will help illustrate the 
extreme dangers of pills and street 
drugs 
that 
could 
be 
laced 
with 
fentanyl; help prevent drug abuse, in-
cluding through the safe disposal of 
prescription 
medications; 
and 
help 
identify the early-warning signs of ad-
diction. 
Bruce’s Law also authorizes the Sec-
retary of Health and Human Services 
to form an interagency working group 
on fentanyl contamination of illegal 
drugs. This group would consist of Fed-
eral Agencies, State-level HIDTA di-
rectors, parents who have lost loved 
ones to fentanyl overdose deaths, and 
those with lived experience and recov-
ery. It would consult with experts at 
all levels to identify strategies, re-
sources, and supports to address the in-
cidence 
of 
drug 
overdoses 
with 
fentanyl-contaminated drugs. It will 
review current Federal strategies to 
seek improvements to them, particu-
larly when it comes to educating mid-
dle and high school students about the 
profound danger of these drugs. 
The final part of Bruce’s Law author-
izes new community-based coalition 
enhancement grants to help educate 
young people about the risks of street 
drugs laced with fentanyl. This would 
allow the Drug-Free Communities Coa-
litions to access new funding focused 
specifically on fentanyl and to try to 
curb or eradicate its use. 
This is a starting point. It is a start-
ing point. And we have to start because 
we have such a serious problem on our 
hands. We know we have it in Anchor-
age, where Bruce Snodgrass likely 
never knew that he was taking a drug

laced with fentanyl; where the officer 
who met Sandy after Bruce’s body was 
found had just come—he had just come 
from notifying another family of an-
other death caused by another over-
dose. 
We also know that we are not alone. 
This is a national crisis. We know we 
must 
do 
more—more 
to 
prevent 
fentanyl from coming across our bor-
ders; more to prevent fentanyl-laced 
drugs from being sold on the street; 
more to educate Americans, espe-
cially—especially—young adults, espe-
cially youth, about its acute danger; 
and more to address addiction and to 
provide support for recovery. 
As I close, I want to thank Senator 
FEINSTEIN
for being the lead Demo-
cratic sponsor of Bruce’s Law, as well 
as Senator SULLIVAN and Senator HAS-
SAN for agreeing to cosponsor it with 
us. I would encourage every Member of 
the Senate to sign on to this legisla-
tion. 
We acknowledge in Alaska this is a 
problem in our State, and we have to 
acknowledge it in all of our 50 States. 
I urge others to join us in this effort. 
Send us your input on how we might be 
able to strengthen this legislation. 
Again, I want to thank Sandy. I want 
to thank Sandy Snodgrass, who is with 
us today. Joining her are Kim Kovol 
from the Office of the Governor, as well 
as Mike Troster, who is the State of 
Alaska’s 
HIDTA 
director. Each of 
them—each of them—they are such im-
portant advocates. 
We recognize that it is going to take 
all of us doing a lot more than we are 
doing 
now 
to 
raise 
awareness 
of 
fentanyl and turn back this deadly 
tide, but we have to. We have to for our 
communities, for our kids, and for 
Bruce. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from New York. 
H.R. 3967 
Mrs. GILLIBRAND. Madam Presi-
dent, I rise to discuss helping our serv-
icemembers exposed to toxic burn pits. 
Let me tell you about U.S. Army 
SFC Heath Robinson. He was a strong, 
healthy, fit combat medic who served 
tours in Kosovo and Iraq. When he re-
turned home, however, he began experi-
encing fatigue. He started bleeding 
from his ears and nose and completely 
lost his voice. 
After consulting multiple doctors, he 
and his wife were sitting in the exam 
room waiting for test results when the 
doctor came in with tears in his eyes. 
He explained that Sergeant Robinson 
had an extremely rare form of stage IV 
lung cancer and exclaimed: What have 
you been exposed to? Sergeant Robin-
son thought back to his tour in Iraq. 
He remembered seeing and smelling 
smoke from pits the size of football 
fields at his base near Baghdad. 
While serving in Iraq, Afghanistan, 
and beyond, millions of U.S. troops 
have lived and worked near burn pits. 
They are basically burning trash heaps 
that the military has used for decades 
to dispose of everything from human 
waste to trash and electronics and jet 
fuel, and they spew forth many of the 
same dangerous toxins that were at 
Ground Zero after 9/11. 
The VA estimates that 3.5 million 
servicemembers were exposed to burn 
pits around the world, many of them 
veterans who are now suffering from 
permanent injuries and illnesses rang-
ing from chronic bronchitis to cancer. 
But when these veterans seek treat-
ments, they face an often unsurmount-
able burden of proof. 
For SFC Heath Robinson, the VA de-
nied him compensation and prescrip-
tion medications because it wasn’t 
proven that burn pits were the cause of 
his illness. Army Sergeant Robinson 
died in 2020. He was only 39 years old. 
I have heard from many veterans, 
servicemembers, 
and 
their 
families 
who have also been raising the alarm 
about burn pits. Gina Cancelino of New 
York told me about her husband Jo-
seph, who was a Marine Corps veteran, 
an NYPD sergeant, and a dad of two 
girls. In 2017, he developed a very rare, 
very aggressive form of testicular can-
cer, as well as thyroid cancer. He died 
in 2019 when he was just 52. 
This is simply unacceptable. Our 
servicemembers risk their lives to keep 
us safe. All they ask for is care in re-
turn, but our government has failed 
them repeatedly. First, it was Agent 
Orange. Then, it was the Blue Water 
Navy vets. Today, it is burn pits. 
That is why, nearly 2 years ago, I 
started working with Jon Stewart, 
John Feal, and a strong coalition of 
veterans service organizations to craft 
the 
Presumptive 
Benefits 
for 
War 
Fighters Exposed to Burn Pits and 
Other Toxins Act. 
This bill forms the centerpiece of the 
Honoring Our PACT Act, which has 
now been named in honor of Sergeant 
Robinson. The bottom line: It would re-
move the unsurmountable and unrea-
sonable burden of proof for veterans to 
receive care. No longer would these 
selfless 
individuals 
have 
to 
jump 
through hoops to get the care they ac-
tually have already earned. No longer 
would they have to spend hours upon 
hours researching the very diseases 
that are killing them. No longer would 
they have to spend their own money on 
biopsies to prove their illnesses are ex-
posure-related and service-related. No 
longer would they be forced to suffer or 
even die like Sergeant Robinson, Ser-
geant Cancelino, and so many others as 
our Nation and government continue 
to fail them. 
Now we have the opportunity to pass 
this bill here in this Chamber at this 
moment in time. While we have incred-
ible momentum, we still have to make 
sure we get 60 votes on final passage. I 
have been meeting with many of you to 
drum up the support we need for this 
critical bill to get it over the finish 
line. Its passage will represent an enor-
mous victory for servicemembers and 
veterans across the country. 
I am proud of the enormous progress 
we have made in this effort, and I hope 
that all of my colleagues will join us in 
passing the PACT Act, not only for 
Sergeants Robinson and Cancelino but 
for all of the brave men and women 
who are still suffering and dying from 
their exposure to burn pits while serv-
ing this country so honorably. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Connecticut. 
Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Madam Presi-
dent, I want to thank my colleagues 
who have worked with us on a bipar-
tisan basis to bring the SFC Heath 
Robinson Honoring Our Promise to Ad-
dress Comprehensive Toxics Act of 2022 
to the floor for a vote. That is a 
mouthful. The PACT Act is the way it 
is known more colloquially. 
The PACT Act is a profoundly sig-
nificant measure. It is a milestone in 
our dealing with the health and bene-
fits that our veterans deserve. 
We know that the modern battlefield 
is filled with toxins and poison that 
could cause grave injury, and many of 
the afflictions that result from those 
toxins or chemicals are manifested 
only years after a veteran leaves Ac-
tive-Duty service. In fact, cancer, hy-
pertension, skin disease—the list is 
long, and so are the number of years 
when the illnesses can arrive. They are 
latent. They are hidden. Like many 
wounds of war, they are invisible at the 
time. But these brave men and women 
who serve us on the modern battlefield 
experience them at higher rates be-
cause there are more of those toxins 
and chemicals. 
We have seen them, for example, in 
the burn pit. One of my sons, a Marine 
Corps officer in Afghanistan, saw them 
firsthand, described them to me, and 
worried about the effects on him. So 
far he is fine, but the years ahead are 
an unknown for him and for countless 
other men and women who may have 
been exposed. In fact, they may not 
even know that they have been exposed 
to these chemicals and toxins. 
The fact of the matter is that the 
Veterans Administration has resisted 
taking responsibility for these ill-
nesses. It has erected thresholds of 
proof and barriers of evidence for vet-
erans who suffer the effects of the burn 
pit and the other sources of toxic 
chemicals that can inflict such griev-
ous pain and worry on so many of 
them. That is why this legislation is so 
significant—because it will begin to 
right the inaction of the government in 
helping veterans afflicted by toxic ex-
posure. 
We have been here before. We have 
fought year after year after year for 
veterans who were afflicted with the 
results of Agent Orange over the resist-
ance and the opposition of the VA. And 
even after we passed the measure, 
righting those wrongs, the VA resisted 
implementing the law, not under this 
administration, fortunately, but pre-
vious ones. 
I am immensely grateful to this VA 
for its seeming support of this meas-
ure, but I am most grateful to the vet-
erans themselves, the veterans service

organizations that have been at our 
side and have had our back, including 
the Iraq and Afghanistan veterans, 
their 
organization. 
The 
IAVA 
has 
played an important role; likewise, the 
VFW—Veterans of Foreign Wars—the 
American Legion, Disabled American 
Veterans, and others. They are among 
the main rulers who deserve predomi-
nant thanks. 
Chairman TESTER and Ranking Mem-
ber MORAN and our counterparts in the 
House Committee on Veterans Affairs 
have been instrumental in this meas-
ure. In fact, I worked with Senator 
MORAN on this issue when I was the 
ranking member on the Veterans’ Af-
fairs Committee. He saw, along with 
me, the importance of moving forward 
on this issue. 
This inaction has affected countless 
families like Sergeant First Class Rob-
inson’s family. I received a hand-
written note from his young daughter 
yesterday urging me to vote yes on 
‘‘my dad’s bill.’’ Let there be no mis-
take, I am going to be voting yes on 
this bill, and I hope that my colleagues 
on both sides of the aisle will over-
whelmingly join me in voting yes. 
I want to say, in particular, how 
proud I have been to lead legislation, 
along with colleagues like Senator 
TILLIS, to advance particular causes of 
groups of veterans who have been spe-
cifically affected. For example, the 
Palomares nuclear accident in 1966 
caused huge suffering and pain to men 
and women in uniform who were sent 
to clean up a crash or a release of 
bombs. They didn’t explode, but they 
were nuclear weapons, and they had to 
be cleaned up. Their remediation ex-
posed those veterans to radiation, and 
the PACT Act will provide them with 
much needed relief. 
Similarly, there are an estimated 
16,000—that is right; 16,000—U.S. serv-
icemembers deployed to a base in Uz-
bekistan known as K2. It was an old 
Soviet base, which became a dumping 
ground for all kinds of toxic sub-
stances, and they were exposed to 
those substances when they served 
there. 
Now, the old Soviet Union didn’t care 
much about its people—Russia not 
much more—about its people in uni-
form, but we should, and we do. That is 
why the PACT Act would provide care 
to them. 
In 
the 
United 
States 
at 
Camp 
Lejeune, many of our veterans and 
their families were exposed to toxins in 
the water supply. They have been left 
without any real recourse. My friend 
and colleague Senator TILLIS
and I 
worked together on legislation to help 
these thousands of veterans and their 
families impacted by those toxins at 
Camp Lejeune. It was an uphill battle. 
We had to overcome a lot of resistance. 
Again, some of our VA friends didn’t 
see it our way, but my feeling is that 
we had to fight as tenaciously for those 
Camp Lejeune families as marines do 
for us. 
The PACT Act essentially regards 
these kinds of illnesses and inflictions 
as part of the cost of war, and it puts 
the presumption of service-connected 
cause on the side of the veteran be-
cause many of them are making claims 
after the fact, indeed, well after they 
have left the battlefield. The proof is 
much more difficult for them to make 
and much easier for the VA to resist, so 
the burden should be on the VA to 
prove that these illnesses are not serv-
ice connected, not the other way 
around. The presumption has to be in 
favor of the veteran. That is the basic 
fairness here. It levels the playing field 
so that veterans have a fair chance at 
making sure that they receive the 
healthcare and the benefits that they 
deserve and need. 
I am proud that this measure is bi-
partisan. It is long overdue, but it 
moves us in the right direction, and 
maybe it helps to prove that we can 
continue to work productively to-
gether. Certainly, as to veterans, we 
need to do the right thing in recog-
nizing these costs of war. 
This measure is not only an impor-
tant milestone as legislation, but it 
also represents an opportunity to edu-
cate 
our 
country 
about 
invisible 
wounds, about brave men and women 
who serve in combat and come home 
without necessarily a visible wound 
but experience a different kind of hard-
ship and burden. Their sacrifice must 
be recognized. They need healthcare, 
and they deserve it. The benefits that 
they are receiving as a result of this 
measure are extraordinarily and deeply 
well deserved and should be available 
promptly. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
FOR-PROFIT COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES 
Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I 
have been on the floor quite a few 
times about an industry which is con-
troversial: for-profit schools. If you 
want to know about for-profit colleges 
and universities, you have to remember 
two numbers, and the numbers are 
these: 8 and 33. Eight percent of the 
graduates of high schools go to for- 
profit colleges and universities; 33 per-
cent of all the student loan defaults are 
students who started out at for-profit 
colleges and universities. 
They are students who didn’t finish 
or ended up with a worthless degree, 
couldn’t make enough money, and de-
faulted on their student loans. That is 
an industry that deserves close scru-
tiny, because, you see, they operate al-
most exclusively with Federal tax-
payers’ dollars. 
I believe that they have really posed 
an 
unscrupulous 
threat 
to 
unsuspecting students, to taxpayers, 
and to the solvency of Federal student 
aid programs. 
Corinthian Colleges, sounds great, 
doesn’t it? That was one of them, one 
of the largest for-profit college compa-
nies, and one of the worst. 
It operated more than a hundred 
campuses, including six in my home 
State of Illinois, under names like Ev-
erest Colleges, WyoTech, and Heald 
Colleges. 
At its peak, Corinthian enrolled more 
than 110,000 students, raking in a $1.4 
billion sum from the Federal Treasury 
every year, 1.4 billion for Corinthian. 
How did Corinthian attract its stu-
dents? It lied. It invested heavily in 
marketing and advertising. It created a 
business model that relied heavily on 
predatory sales practices. It delib-
erately misled students into taking on 
more debt than they could ever, ever 
repay. 
They lied to potential students about 
the school’s job placement rates. They 
lied about the students’ future salary 
prospects. They lied about whether Co-
rinthian credits could be transferred to 
another college. Most appallingly, Co-
rinthian recruiters were sent out to 
look for the most vulnerable targets: 
high school students whose families 
had no experience with higher edu-
cation—minority students. 
An internal company document de-
scribed 
Corinthian’s 
target 
demo-
graphic as ‘‘isolated people’’ with ‘‘low 
self-esteem.’’ People who have ‘‘few 
people in their lives who care about 
them’’ and people who are ‘‘stuck, un-
able to see and plan for the future.’’ 
They preyed on these people. 
Single moms living close to poverty 
were the best targets. In 2013, Vice 
President KAMALA
HARRIS, who was 
then 
California’s 
attorney 
general, 
sued this company for predatory and 
deceptive business practices. That law-
suit was followed by investigations by 
four different Federal agencies and 
more than 20 State attorneys general 
for consumer fraud on all of their cam-
puses. 
Corinthian’s enrollment numbers and 
stock prices tumbled with these inves-
tigations, and on April 26, 2015, the 
whole Corinthian College house of 
cards 
collapsed. 
The 
company 
an-
nounced abruptly it would close all of 
its schools the following day. 
The announcement left 16,000 stu-
dents stunned and worried about how 
they were ever going to pay off the 
debts they had incurred and about the 
degrees that they wouldn’t be able to 
finish. 
Back in 2015, I called for widespread 
relief for borrowers defrauded by Corin-
thian. And last week, these borrowers 
finally received some long overdue re-
lief. Seven years after they closed Co-
rinthian, they finally got relief from 
the student loans they incurred be-
cause of the fraud of Corinthian Col-
leges. 
In its largest student loan forgive-
ness action ever, the Education Depart-
ment recognized the rot that was at 
the core of Corinthian Colleges and an-
nounced it was going to wipe out $5.8

S2806 
June 7, 2022 
billion in student loan debt owed by 
560,000 borrowers who attended the 
company’s for-profit schools. 
You see, the Federal Government was 
saying to the students: These schools 
are OK. You can borrow Federal money 
going to these schools. 
These students said, well, I couldn’t 
get a Federal loan unless it was a real 
college or university, and, in fact, they 
were wrong. 
For former Corinthian students, this 
loan forgiveness means finally their 
credit scores will start to get above 
sinking, fewer garnished paychecks, 
and calls from collection agencies may 
just slow down. I applaud Education 
Secretary Cardona and President Biden 
for their leadership on this simple issue 
of justice. 
This is the latest step the Biden ad-
ministration has taken to ease the 
crush of student loan debt. 
The administration has used relief 
programs aimed at a variety of bor-
rowers, including public service work-
ers and people with disabilities. It also 
paused loan repayment during the pan-
demic. 
President Biden reportedly is consid-
ering a broader student loan forgive-
ness program that would benefit more 
borrowers, such a program—if it is re-
sponsibly crafted—would be a boon not 
only to individual borrowers and their 
families, but also to our economy. It 
would make it possible for young peo-
ple to finally restart their lives, buy a 
car, maybe even a home, start a busi-
ness, maybe even a family—the kinds 
of investments that make America 
grow the right way. 
I also believe we need to rethink the 
provisions in our Federal bankruptcy 
laws that make student loan debt one 
of the few debts that cannot be dis-
charged in bankruptcy proceedings. If 
you declare bankruptcy, you can basi-
cally be discharged from any obliga-
tion to pay back your mortgage, even 
your mortgage on a second home, your 
car loan, or even money that you bor-
rowed for a boat. You can discharge all 
those in bankruptcies, but you cannot 
discharge your student loan, in all 
practical purposes. 
Bankruptcy should be allowed to be 
used as a last resort for borrowers who 
have no other place to turn. I expect to 
have more to say about that in the 
near future. 
America needs more trained nurses, 
doctors, teachers, engineers, mechan-
ics, and skilled professionals and trade 
workers than ever before. It is in 
America’s national and economic in-
terest to make sure that student loans 
are a prudent investment and to pro-
tect unsuspecting students from un-
scrupulous organizations like these for- 
profit colleges and universities. 
We should have learned our lesson as 
a Nation. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Ohio. 
Mr. PORTMAN. Madam President, I 
ask unanimous consent to speak for up 
to 15 minutes and Senator STABENOW 
for 1 minute prior to the scheduled 
rollcall votes. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
UKRAINE 
Mr. PORTMAN. Madam President, 
last Friday was a grim milestone. It 
was the 100th day of the war in 
Ukraine—a war being waged by Russia 
against an ally in a democratic coun-
try, Ukraine: a hundred days of brutal, 
unrelenting rocket and missile attacks 
throughout Ukraine, including attacks 
on a number of civilian targets like 
hospitals and churches and apartment 
buildings, schools. Tens of thousands of 
Ukrainian citizens and soldiers have 
been killed and entire cities have been 
laid to rubble by the Russian barrages. 
For the 14th straight week when the 
Senate has been in session during this 
war, I come to the Senate floor again 
today to discuss the status of this 
unprovoked and bloody invasion and to 
talk about what our role as Americans 
ought to be. 
First, it can never be emphasized 
enough that the people of Ukraine, pro-
fessional soldiers and civilians and vol-
unteers alike, have demonstrated cour-
age, fortitude, and competence in beat-
ing all expectations in their existential 
battle against the odds to preserve 
their freedom and protect their home-
land. 
I am not surprised because I have 
seen the spirit and bravery of the 
Ukrainian people firsthand. In my 
seven or eight or nine trips to Ukraine, 
including meetings with Ukrainian 
troops on the line of contact before 
this latest invasion, I have seen the 
Ukrainian spirit. To have held off Rus-
sia 
this 
long 
demonstrates 
their 
strength and their resiliency. But at 
this moment in time there is reason for 
concern too. 
President Zelenskyy just said that 
Russia now controls 20 percent of 
Ukraine’s territory. Before the war 
started, Russia controlled just 7 per-
cent of Ukraine, after its illegal annex-
ation of the Crimean Peninsula and the 
creation of a Russian-backed separatist 
government in parts of the Donbas re-
gion in eastern Ukraine. 
If you look at this map, you can see 
here what Russia took in 2014, Crimea 
and part of the Donbas here, and look 
what they have now and look at where 
the battles are occurring. 
I made another trip to the region last 
week, and what I heard was that 
thanks to the fierce Ukrainian resist-
ance, Ukrainians have had success in 
some parts of the country. 
Remember, at one point Kyiv was 
under attack and there were Russian 
troops coming down from Belarus. 
They have been repelled, so there have 
been successes. There is no question 
about it. But Russia has now consoli-
dated its troops and its firepower in 
this area, in the south and in the east, 
and they are making gains—incre-
mental gains, but gains nonetheless. 
This is a crucial point in the war, and 
we have to redouble our efforts and do 
that now to help Ukrainians defend 
themselves, to save Ukrainian lives, 
and to push the Russian invasion back. 
In my trip to the region last week, I 
also visited with U.S. troops and com-
manders in Germany and with heads of 
government, military leaders, and ref-
ugee coordinators in Romania and 
Moldova before traveling to the United 
Kingdom, one of our staunchest allies. 
I thank them for their support. 
While I was in Moldova, I was able to 
cross the border into Ukraine, where I 
met Ukrainian refugees leaving the 
country, but also Ukrainians who were 
actually returning to Ukraine, as the 
place where they lived in this part of 
Ukraine, closer to Kyiv, was relatively 
stable. 
During my visits with the leaders of 
Moldova and Romania, I was able to 
thank each of them for their support in 
Ukraine and to learn more about what 
they need to be more effective partners 
in the region. 
In Germany, visiting with the U.S.- 
European command, I received detailed 
briefings on the state of the war in 
Ukraine, as well as what the United 
States and our allies are doing to sup-
port Ukraine’s brave defenders with 
military assistance. 
I also met with the senior Ukrainian 
liaison there from the Ukrainian mili-
tary who gave me his very frank as-
sessment of the war and what weapons 
his brothers-in-arms absolutely need to 
be able to continue their fight. As I 
mentioned 
earlier, 
Russia’s 
recent 
gains on the eastern side of the coun-
try are cause for serious concern. 
Russia’s mainline effort, again, is 
here in the Donbas region. By all ac-
counts, the Ukrainians are making the 
Russians pay dearly for every inch of 
territory, but they are taking terri-
tory, incrementally, and the Ukrain-
ians, both soldiers and civilians, are 
taking higher casualties. 
The primary reason is the Russian 
artillery has a longer range than the 
artillery that the Ukrainians possess. 
They are able to strike Ukrainian posi-
tions 
from 
safe 
distances 
where 
Ukrainian artillery cannot reach them. 
This unlevel playing field in eastern 
Ukraine must be addressed. 
This is why I have been urging the 
administration and our allies to imme-
diately provide Ukraine with the weap-
ons they are asking for to allow them 
to have a fighting chance against the 
longer range Russian artillery, specifi-
cally longer range advanced rocket ar-
tillery systems. These systems which 
we have are superior or at least on par 
with the Russian artillery in terms of 
distance, accuracy, reload speed, and 
mobility and would help immediately 
to level the playing field for Ukraine. 
I spoke about the need for these 
weapons in my floor speech on May 24. 
I have tweeted about it, I think, six or 
seven times. Finally, after weeks of 
urging that we listen to the Ukrainians 
and provide these systems, I was very 
pleased that the administration an-
nounced last Tuesday that they will

provide Ukraine with high-mobility ar-
tillery rocket systems or HIMARS. But 
I am concerned not just by how long it 
took and continues to take but by how 
long it will take to get these systems 
in place in Ukraine while lives are 
being lost and Ukrainian territory is 
being taken. 
Moreover, the best information that I 
have is that the administration is only 
providing four of these HIMARS sys-
tems, which will have limited impact 
on the battlefield. I hope I am wrong 
about that. I hope there are more on 
the way. But that is the best informa-
tion we have. 
They are also only providing Ukraine 
with midrange missiles, meaning that 
Ukrainian troops will need to fire clos-
er to Russian positions and put them-
selves at greater risk. That may be OK 
because that may be comparable or 
maybe evenly slightly better than the 
Russian artillery, but they are not get-
ting the special, longer range missiles. 
Lastly, we are being told it will take 
time to train Ukrainian soldiers on 
how to operate this advanced system. 
All told, it will take, we are told, 
roughly 2 weeks for these systems to 
arrive in-theater and for Ukrainian 
troops to be sufficiently trained on 
them. In the meantime, Russia’s brutal 
advance will proceed, and Ukrainian 
lives will continue to be lost. 
There is some good news on that 
front from another part of our allied 
front. Just yesterday, the British an-
nounced that they will send several 
multiple launch rocket systems to 
Ukraine, which is a larger version of 
what we are sending. This is very im-
portant. I appreciate what the UK is 
doing, and I also urge other allied 
countries that have this longer range 
capacity to step up as well. 
In addition, this week we learned 
that Spain is ready to send Leopard 
battle tanks and anti-aircraft missiles 
to Ukraine. This is a big change, and 
we appreciate the fact that the Spanish 
military support has been increasing. 
They will also provide training for 
Ukrainian Army officials and soldiers 
on the tanks, according to the report, 
which cites government sources. 
Also, in, Severodonetsk, the city the 
Russians were overrunning last week-
end, reports indicate that the Ukrain-
ians have counterattacked and are put-
ting up a fierce resistance to Russia’s 
assault. 
This is this area right here. 
Although the battle is far from over, 
the Ukrainians are, once again, dem-
onstrating their incredible bravery and 
resolve, showing the world that despite 
being outgunned, they will not give up 
without a fight. 
After my briefings in Germany, I 
traveled to Romania, where I met with 
Prime Minister Ciuca, the Minister of 
Economy, State Secretary of Foreign 
Affairs, members of Parliament, and 
officials and volunteers involved with 
welcoming Ukrainian refugees. 
America could ask for no better 
friend than Romania. Our interests 
align on many issues, including energy 
security, defense spending, food secu-
rity, standing against Russian aggres-
sion, and blocking malign Chinese in-
vestments in critical infrastructure. 
Our relationship is strengthened by the 
Romanian community in the United 
States, including in Ohio, where thou-
sands trace their heritage back to that 
great country. 
Twenty percent of Romania’s energy 
comes from nuclear energy, and the 
country plans to boost that to 40 per-
cent in coming years, with America as 
their partner of choice. I urge the 
Biden administration to do more to 
support Romania’s embrace of nuclear 
energy, especially with regard to the 
Export-Import 
Bank, 
working 
with 
American energy companies. As their 
production increases, I hope that Ro-
mania can be become an energy hub 
that can help wean its neighbors off 
Russian energy. Romania has been 
smart. They have cut their ties with 
both Chinese nuclear energy and tele-
communications companies, fully rec-
ognizing the threat that these compa-
nies pose. And unlike other countries 
in Europe, they are not dependent on 
Russian energy. 
Romania has also been creative in 
finding ways to help Ukraine export its 
grain. This is a huge issue. We all know 
that Ukraine is a large exporter, 
whether it is sunflower oil or whether 
it is corn or whether it is wheat, but 
particularly with regard to wheat. So 
many poor countries around the world 
depend on Ukrainian wheat. 
This photograph, unfortunately, is of 
a bombing attack only about a day and 
a half ago in the area of the Port of 
Odessa. And this is the Russians ex-
ploding a bomb at a grain bin. So they 
are destroying wheat and other grains 
that would be destined for poor coun-
tries in the world. This is what is going 
on today in Ukraine. 
There is something else that is very 
important, and that is the ability of 
Ukraine to export this wheat that they 
do have in bins around the country. I 
discussed this at length with Prime 
Minister Ciuca of Romania. It is ex-
tremely important because he has the 
ability to help with regard to a port in 
Romania to get some of this grain out 
that would normally go out through 
Odessa, which has been mined and has 
been—mined by the Russians. 
So 
here 
we 
are. 
The 
Port 
of 
Constanta is here. This is Romania. 
This is Ukraine. Here is the Port of 
Odessa. Over here is the Donbas, where 
we were earlier. 
This port is actually the largest port 
on the Black Sea. It is difficult to get 
from Odessa to here, but in talking to 
the Prime Minister, he has some great 
ideas on how to deal with this. With 
the blockade of Odessa by Russia, there 
is an opportunity to use rail, to use a 
canal system, and to use roads to get 
the grain to Constanta to be able to ex-
port it. 
I appreciate the fact the Romanians 
are willing to work us on that, and it is 
incredibly important, again, not just to 
Ukraine and their economy to have the 
ability to export, but it is also incred-
ibly important because the dire warn-
ings of global food insecurity and price 
spikes if this blockade continues con-
cerns all of us. It certainly concerns 
this Congress and this administration. 
These poor countries in Africa de-
pend on Ukrainian wheat to avoid food 
shortages. 
Romanian officials told me they in-
tend to work with Ukraine in this 
project, and I appreciate that. 
Malign actors around the world, by 
the way, have used food as a weapon 
over time. The Houthis in Yemen, 
Assad in Syria, and now Putin in Rus-
sia. 
President Putin recently suggested 
that he would only lift his stranglehold 
on these ports, including Odessa, if the 
sanctions were lifted on Russia. 
Let me be clear. Food should never 
be used as leverage in negotiations. 
Russia must lift its blockade imme-
diately without any conditions. Mil-
lions of lives depend on it. I would ex-
pect the administration and allies, in-
cluding Turkey, to be coming up with 
contingency plans now, if they don’t 
have them already, to ensure that this 
wheat can be exported and other grains 
as well. 
When it comes to the administration, 
President Biden has said recently: 
‘‘There is going to have to be a nego-
tiated settlement’’ to end this war. 
I urge the administration not to talk 
about ceding ground in Ukraine. This 
does not signal resolve or clarity; it 
signals weakness. It will not help us 
break the blockade in the Black Sea, 
and it will not help Ukraine win this 
war. We should be doing what we can 
with allies—short of boots on the 
ground—helping the Ukrainians take 
back every inch of territory that Rus-
sia has taken from them since 2014. 
That is fair, just, and what Ukrainian 
officials themselves have been calling 
for. Our allies in Eastern Europe know 
what is at stake here. Romania is a 
great example. A staunch NATO ally, 
Romania is committed to the military 
defense of the alliance and meets 
NATO’s goal of spending 2 percent of 
its GDP on defense. They actually told 
me when I was there that they plan to 
raise it to 2.5 percent in the next few 
years in response to Russia’s invasion 
of Ukraine. 
After Romania, I visited Moldova, 
where I met with Prime Minister 
Gavrilita, the Minister of Internal Af-
fairs, and various parliamentarians. I 
was impressed with what I saw. As I 
told the Prime Minister, Moldova is a 
small country that punches way above 
its weight. Moldova has graciously ac-
cepted almost half a million Ukrainian 
refugees through its border—more per 
capita than any other Nation. 
Unfortunately, the war in Ukraine is 
far from over, and if Russia continues 
to gain ground or opens up an assault 
on Odessa, which many fear, it will 
send another massive wave of refugees 
westward into Moldova.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2808 
June 7, 2022 
While in Moldova, I traveled to 
Palanca, a border crossing that is run 
jointly by Moldovan, Ukrainian, and 
EU Frontex border security guards. 
While at the border, I had the oppor-
tunity to speak with Ukrainians whose 
lives have been turned upside down by 
this war. Some were leaving Moldova, 
some were coming back into Moldova, 
but they all expressed to me their fears 
that Russia will gain ground and ex-
pand their brutal assault to other parts 
of the country, including Odessa, which 
is only about 30 miles away from where 
I was. 
Now, as the war rages on and we 
cross 100 days of this brutal invasion, I 
want to highlight another recent devel-
opment. I have mentioned on this floor 
many times the need for stronger sanc-
tions against Russia, particularly with 
regard to energy but also trade and 
banking. In particular, I have pointed 
out that Europe sends Russia roughly 
$870 million a day in gas and oil re-
ceipts that help fund the Putin war 
machine. 
So I was pleased that late last week 
the European Union took a positive 
step in partially banning Russian oil 
into the EU. Specifically, these phased- 
in sanctions will prohibit the import of 
seaborne crude oil from Russia and pe-
troleum products over the next 8 
months. This phased-in embargo, I be-
lieve, along with countries like Ger-
many that stopped pipeline oil alto-
gether, is expected to impact approxi-
mately 90 percent of Russian oil im-
ports into Europe by the end of this 
year. Combined with the ban on coal 
imports that Russia has agreed to ear-
lier this year, which will take effect in 
August, Europe is undoubtedly making 
progress in cutting off that nearly $1 
billion that goes to Russia to feed the 
war machine. 
Even better, given the situation on 
the ground in Ukraine today, would be 
a full embargo against all Russian en-
ergy immediately, as the United States 
has done, but this is progress. 
Given their greater dependence on 
Russian oil and gas, by the way, Eu-
rope’s energy independence from Rus-
sia will require a different kind of lead-
ership from the United States as we es-
tablish a new energy world order. 
Where the United States can help 
most is to get more energy on the glob-
al market now to help backfill Russia’s 
energy needs and stabilize prices. In-
stead of looking to countries like Iran 
and Venezuela to produce more energy, 
this administration should be pursuing 
policies to expand our domestic oil and 
gas production as well as renewables, 
nuclear, all of the above. And in the 
longer term for our national security 
and that of our allies, the United 
States needs to take steps to lead the 
world in developing and exporting the 
next-generation 
energy 
technologies 
like advanced nuclear and hydrogen. 
The reality is this: It shouldn’t have 
taken a global energy crisis for us to 
realize this. Before this administration 
took office, concerns had been raised 
about the prospect about aggressive or 
idealistic policies that threaten the re-
liability and security of our energy 
supplies here in the United States. We 
need to act, and we need to act now. 
Providing LNG to Europe is key to Eu-
rope being able to wean themselves 
from Russian gas. 
The fact is, we need to unleash Amer-
ican energy. We have the resources 
here to help our friends and allies. We 
can help everyone so that they don’t 
need to take another dime and give it 
to Vladimir Putin’s war machine. 
Right now, Ukrainians continue to 
suffer, and the world must not turn a 
blind eye. According to the United Na-
tions recently, nearly 7 million Ukrain-
ian refugees have fled the country 
since the war began, and another 8 mil-
lion Ukrainians are internally dis-
placed. This invasion has flattened 
beautiful 
cities 
in 
Ukraine, 
like 
Mariupol, where, according to local of-
ficials, at least 22,000 residents have 
been killed. 
I will close with this. I have now 
come to this floor every week since 
just before President Putin put this il-
legal and unprovoked invasion upon 
the people of a democratic Ukraine, 
who just wanted to live in peace with 
their neighbors—their neighbors, by 
the way, including Russia. 
Some have asked me why a Senator 
from Ohio should care about this fight-
ing in Ukraine, and I tell them every 
American should care. This is a fight 
during our generation where democ-
racy is on the line. Some folks here 
may not agree with that; I understand. 
But Ukrainians get it. They know what 
it is like to live under the thumb of an 
authoritarian, of Russia, and they 
broke away from that and toward de-
mocracy in 1991 and again, as we all 
saw, in 2014. I was in Ukraine then in 
2014 right after the Revolution of Dig-
nity, where Ukrainians decided for 
themselves that they wanted to turn to 
us and to Europe to pursue a hopeful 
future of freedom and democracy. Now 
President Putin is trying to extinguish 
that hope. We must not let him. 
I am also motivated by the tens of 
thousands 
of 
Ukrainian-American 
friends and constituents in my home 
State of Ohio, some of whom joined me 
for an update last Friday, where I 
learned more about the amazing Ohio 
volunteer efforts to help Ukraine. 
But even if I didn’t have one con-
stituent of Ukrainian descent or know 
a single Ukrainian, I would be on this 
floor condemning Russia’s atrocities. 
As Russian forces target Ukrainian 
civilians, people from across the globe 
are showing their support and encour-
agement for Ukrainians. In Ohio, we 
have assured Ukrainians that America 
has their back. 
At the Ohio State University, Presi-
dent Kristina Johnson participated in a 
call with President Zelenskyy, and she 
said she asked him how Ohio State 
could help. President Zelenskyy an-
swered with: How about helping to re-
build our cities that have been flat-
tened? What did President Johnson 
say? ‘‘Count on us.’’ That has been the 
consistent theme from the Buckeye 
State—count on us. In fact, student or-
ganizations like the Ukrainian Society 
and Desserts for Donations have held 
fundraisers around the State selling 
buttons, pins, desserts—all of which 
have been donated to the Revived 
Ukrainian Soldiers, a group that pro-
vides medical and humanitarian aid. 
I have listed before on this floor a 
dozen other great causes in Ohio that 
have been helpful with regard to the 
humanitarian effort in Ukraine. Ohio-
ans get it. They know that America 
can’t afford to stay on the sidelines 
and be a spectator. 
I commend the administration for 
the actions taken, but as I have said 
before, we need to do more and more 
quickly. At this crucial time in the 
battle, freedom and democracy are at 
stake and the ability for countries to 
have their territorial integrity re-
spected. America cannot afford to be 
tentative. Instead, we must lead with 
allies in protecting the post-World War 
II order. We are being watched by those 
allies, 41 of whom have joined us in 
helping Ukraine defend itself. But we 
are also being watched by our adver-
saries who must see strength and de-
termination and willingness to lead. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. MUR-
PHY). The Senator from Michigan. 
Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, first 
I want to thank my friend from Ohio 
for his passionate leadership on this 
very, very important issue and the im-
portance of standing with Ukraine. I 
want to thank him for that. 
NOMINATION OF CHAVONDA J. JACOBS-YOUNG 
Mr. President, we are about to vote 
on a very important position in the De-
partment of Agriculture, and I am urg-
ing my colleagues to confirm Dr. 
Chavonda Jacobs-Young as our next 
Under Secretary for Research, Edu-
cation, and Economics at the Depart-
ment of Agriculture. 
It is critical to quickly confirm Dr. 
Jacobs-Young because without Agency 
leadership and senior staff, the re-
search Agencies at USDA can’t do the 
really essential work that our pro-
ducers are counting on. 
Dr. Jacobs-Young is extremely quali-
fied. She has held leadership roles at 
multiple research Agencies at the 
USDA and the White House. She will be 
the first woman of color to serve in the 
USDA’s highest scientific post. 
She was the first African-American 
woman in the country to receive a 
Ph.D. in wood and paper science and 
the first woman of color to serve as the 
Administrator for the Agriculture Re-
search Service. 
She has even got her own statue on 
the National Mall as part of the 
IfThenSheCan exhibit to celebrate con-
temporary 
women 
innovators 
in 
science, technology, engineering, and 
math—her own statue on the Mall. 
Her 
commitment 
to 
science, 
re-
search, and education is a true inspira-
tion.

NOMINATION OF SHALANDA H. BAKER 
Mr. MANCHIN. Mr. President, I am 
pleased to support the nomination of 
Ms. Shalanda Baker to be the Director 
of the Office of Minority Economic Im-
pact at the Department of Energy. 
Congress established the Office of Mi-
nority Economic Impact within the De-
partment of Energy in 1978. Congress 
recognized that the energy shortages 
and rising energy prices we faced at the 
time would have an overwhelming im-
pact on the quality of life for our so-
cially or economically disadvantaged 
citizens. 
The Office of Minority Economic Im-
pact was created to provide a mecha-
nism to ensure that the energy needs of 
minorities were fairly considered and 
addressed. Its goals were, first, to un-
derstand the impacts of our energy 
policies and programs on the quality of 
life in minority communities and, sec-
ond, to ensure that minority business 
enterprises are afforded an equal oppor-
tunity to participate fully in the en-
ergy programs of the Department. 
The position of Director was created 
not only to head this office, but also to 
advise the Secretary of Energy on the 
effect of the energy policies, regula-
tions, and actions of the Department 
on minorities and on how to increase 
minority participation in the Depart-
ment’s programs. The position does not 
carry with it the policy making or reg-
ulatory or adjudicatory powers of 
many other senior offices in the De-
partment of Energy, but it plays an im-
portant role in ensuring that the needs 
of minority and disadvantaged commu-
nities are justly and fairly addressed 
and that they are treated fairly. 
The Director also helps ensure that 
the Department complies with our civil 
rights and equal employment laws and 
that it maintains a diverse workforce 
and inclusive work environment. 
The Department of Energy’s commit-
ment to fairness, equality, and diver-
sity has always been important. But it 
is especially important today, as we 
face record high fuel prices, come to 
grips with the global climate crisis, 
and transform how we fuel our econ-
omy. We must ensure that our energy 
policies do not leave anyone behind or 
impose an unfair or disproportionate 
burden on minority or disadvantaged 
communities. 
I believe Ms. Baker is very well 
qualified for this position. She has 
spent the past decade studying the im-
pact of the transition from fossil fuels 
to cleaner energy resources on dis-
advantaged communities. And she has 
spent the past 17 months serving as the 
Deputy Director for Energy Justice 
and as Secretary Granholm’s Advisor 
on Equity. 
I strongly support her nomination, 
and I urge a favorable vote on her nom-
ination.

The Senator from Rhode Island. 
250TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE ‘‘GASPEE’’ RAID 
Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, 
this week marks the 250th anniversary 
of the first blow struck in the Amer-
ican Colonies’ struggle for independ-
ence from the British Crown. I come to 
the Senate floor every year to com-
memorate this moment because it took 
place in Rhode Island at the hands of 
some brave and bold Rhode Islanders. 
Before recounting the tale of those 
bold Rhode Islanders, I would like to 
acknowledge a special guest with us in 
the Gallery today: Michael Tatham, 
Deputy Head of Mission for the British 
Embassy here in Washington. A lot has 
happened over the last 250 years, and 
Great Britain is now America’s closest 
ally and great, great friend. It is an 
honor to have the Deputy Ambassador 
here today. 
So it was 1772, and the Royal Navy’s 
revenue cutter, the HMS Gaspee, pa-
trolled Narragansett Bay in the wake 
of the Seven Years War, where Great 
Britain had emerged the victor. The 
Crown owed, by some estimates, be-
tween 74 and 133 million pounds. That 
was a colossal burden on the empire’s 
finances. The Gaspee’s mission was to 
collect taxes from the Colonies to help 
repay British debt. 
I will concede that part of the 
Gaspee’s mission was righteous. Rhode 
Island’s rum distilleries formed a cor-
ner of the so-called triangle trade, with 
enslaved people from Africa and sugar 
from the Caribbean forming the other 
legs of this foul business. Rum-running 
to support the slave trade was repug-
nant and a worthy target of British au-
thorities. 
But Britain’s heavy hand reached far 
beyond that. British customs agents 
seized Colonial vessels and cargo at 
whim, leaving rightful owners with no 
recourse to reclaim their property. One 
such owner was John Hancock, whose 
signature would soon become famous. 
Authorities even pressed Colonial sail-
ors into service on His Majesty’s ves-
sels against their will. 
The Gaspee and her captain, Lieuten-
ant William Dudingston, drew par-
ticular ire. One of Dudingston’s first 
acts was to stop the merchant ship For-
tune. Dudingston and his crew roughed 
up the Fortune’s commander, Rufus 
Greene, condemned the ship and her 
cargo, and sent the Fortune to Boston 
for the admiralty to sell. 
This did not please the Fortune’s 
owner, 
Rhode 
Island’s 
Nathanael 
Greene, who would go on to become 
General 
Washington’s 
aide-de-camp 
and wartime administrator and then 
command the southern campaign of the 
Revolutionary War, which he did so ef-
fectively that British General Corn-
wallis would write: 
That damned Greene is more dangerous 
than Washington. 
Dudingston’s reputation only wors-
ened from there. British law awarded 
revenue cutter commanders a share of 
the cargo they seized. Dudingston 
seized so much cargo that he was able 
to nearly double his salary, and he 
earned, along with that bounty, a well- 
deserved 
reputation 
for 
arrogance. 
Soon Rhode Islanders were protesting 
his conduct formally, but those pro-
tests yielded no accommodation. 
On June 9, 1772, simmering anger at 
Dudingston and the Gaspee boiled over. 
Dudingston spotted a small trading 
ship, the Hannah, bound for Provi-
dence. The Gaspee gave chase, and 
Dudingston hailed the Hannah’s cap-
tain, Benjamin Lindsey, and ordered 
the Hannah to submit to a search. Cap-
tain Lindsey declined that invitation 
and ignored the Gaspee’s warning shots 
and sailed on toward Providence. 
Now, the Hannah was smaller and 
lighter than the Gaspee, and Captain 
Lindsey 
was 
more 
familiar 
than 
Dudingston with the waters between 
Newport 
and 
Providence. 
Lindsey 
steered his Hannah across the shallow 
waters outside Namquid Point. The 
Hannah could sail over the shallows, 
but the heavier Gaspee could not. 
Dudingston and his crew ran aground 
on a sandbar off Pawtuxet Cove, 
stranded, as the Sun was setting in a 
falling tide. The Gaspee would need to 
wait for the next day’s high tides to 
lift it free. 
When the Hannah arrived in Provi-
dence, 
Captain 
Lindsey 
summoned 
local patriots to Sabin’s Tavern for re-
freshments and for planning. The re-
sult of the plan was that under the 
leadership of John Brown, later to be 
famous for Brown University, and 
Abraham Whipple, a group of men 
boarded a half dozen longboats to row 
from Providence down to Pawtuxet. 
Through the dark night, with oars muf-
fled, the Rhode Islanders descended on 
the Gaspee. Whipple reputedly called 
out to Dudingston—and I hope the 
young pages will forgive my language, 
but this is apparently the language 
used in that moment: 
I am the sheriff of the county of Kent, God 
damn you. I have got a warrant to apprehend 
you, God damn you; so surrender, God damn 
you. 
I believe I mentioned that the Rhode 
Islanders had fortified themselves at 
Sabin’s Tavern, which might explain 
some of the language. In any event, 
Lieutenant Dudingston refused that in-
vitation so a brief, sharp battle ensued. 
At this moment those 250 years ago, 
Rhode Islanders drew the first blood of 
what would become our revolutionary 
struggle when a musket ball struck 
Lieutenant Dudingston. The Rhode Is-
land patriots boarded the Gaspee. In 
the melee, Dudingston cried out: 
Lord, have mercy upon me—I am done for. 
But he was not. The British sailors 
soon gave up the fight. The Rhode Is-
landers took the crew prisoner and 
ferried the captives to shore. A marker 
still stands at the place where the cap-
tive crew was brought ashore. And 
there, Dudingston received the care of 
a doctor and, ultimately, recovered 
from his wounds. Indeed, Dudingston 
would not only heal, but go on to live 
a long life. He commanded other ves-
sels. He moved back to his native Scot-
land and married and raised four chil-
dren in a coastal town called Elie over-
looking the Firth of Fife and the North 
Sea, but he never patrolled Narragan-
sett Bay again. 
A quick side story. A few years ago, 
a couple from Scotland, Angela and 
Roddy Innes, visited Pawtuxet during 
Gaspee Days, our annual celebration of 
the Gaspee raid, coming up this week-
end. The Inneses are connected through

marriage to the Dudingstons, and An-
gela 
wanted 
to 
see 
what 
the 
Dudingston-Gaspee was all about. 
In Pawtuxet, Rhode Islanders wel-
comed Angela and Roddy with open 
arms. 
Local 
historian 
Dr. 
John 
Concannon invited them to stay. ‘‘It 
was an amazing experience,’’ Angela 
said. ‘‘The people there are incredibly 
friendly.’’ The trip also helped them 
grasp the significance of the Gaspee 
raid on America’s road to revolution. 
And this year, Angela Innes will mark 
the 250th Gaspee anniversary with a 
Gaspee Day party of her own in Scot-
land. 
Well, that left the dreaded Gaspee. 
With the prisoners ashore, the Gaspee 
raiders returned to the stranded ship 
and set her afire. When the fire reached 
her powder magazine, she blew apart, 
and her remains were lost to time and 
tides. Rhode Island was rid of the 
dreaded Gaspee. 
New efforts are underway now to find 
the charred remains of the Gaspee 
using advanced sonar technology. Dr. 
Kathy Abbass of the Rhode Island Ma-
rine Archaeology Project is on the 
case. Dr. Abbass is accomplished in her 
field. Indeed, she may have located 
Captain Cook’s ship, the Endeavor, 
sunk in Newport Harbor. If anyone can 
find the Gaspee or what is left of her, 
it is Dr. Abbass. 
I should offer special thanks to Peter 
Abbott, the British Consul General in 
Boston who, along with representatives 
of the Royal Navy, came to Rhode Is-
land last month for the announcement 
that funds had been raised to find the 
Gaspee. Abbott said: 
Being a British consul in New England 
means you must have broad shoulders. I get 
invited to events that celebrate the Boston 
Massacre and Evacuation Day. But what 
takes the biscuit is commemorating the 
burning of a British ship! 
The Deputy Ambassador should know 
that if, in fact, we do find the Gaspee, 
Rhode Island, a colony no more, in-
tends to courteously seize the vessel 
for further research. 
The Gaspee raid represents Rhode Is-
land’s spirit of independence, which has 
lived in us since Rhode Island’s found-
ing as a refuge of religious tolerance 
from the Massachusetts Colony’s harsh 
theocracy. 
Our 
celebration 
of 
the 
Gaspee Affair represents Rhode Island-
ers’ pride in that spirit, which we share 
willingly, even with a Dudingston de-
scendant. 
Oh, and by the way, this episode 
where 
Rhode 
Islanders 
rode 
down 
through the night to a British ship 
that had been stranded by Rhode Island 
wilds and sacked her and took her crew 
and set her afire and blew her up, that 
all took place more than a year before 
Massachusetts 
colonists 
boarded 
a 
British ship to push tea bales into Bos-
ton Harbor. They pushed tea bales off 
the ship; more than a year earlier, 
Rhode Islanders blew the ship up. I am 
just saying, Mr. President. 
So here is to another 250 years of 
celebrating the Gaspee raiders and to 
more people learning about Rhode Is-
land’s role as a spark of revolution. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

The bill clerk proceeded to call the

TRIBUTE TO LIEUTENANT 
GENERAL GUY C. SWAN III 
Mr. REED. Mr. President, on behalf 
of myself and Senator INHOFE, as chair-
man and ranking member of the Senate 
Armed Services Committee and the co-
chairs of the Senate Army Caucus, it is 
our honor to pay tribute to a great 
leader and exceptional advocate for the 
U.S. Army, LTG Guy C. Swan III, U.S. 
Army, Retired, as he retires from his 
current position as vice president of 
the Association of the United States 
Army, AUSA. For the past 10 years, 
Lieutenant General Swan led education 
and 
professional 
development 
for 
AUSA. Lieutenant General Swan exem-
plifies a lifetime of commitment and 
service to the Nation and to others. 
A 1976 graduate of the U.S. Military 
Academy at West Point, Lieutenant 
General Swan was commissioned as a 
second lieutenant to be an armor offi-
cer. Throughout his distinguished ca-
reer, he was frequently recognized for 
his exemplary leadership skills, hold-
ing command assignments at every 
level and in many theaters. His career 
culminated as the commanding gen-
eral, U.S. Army North/Fifth Army. 
Along the way, he served in critical 
staff assignments such as chief of staff 
and director of operations in Multi-Na-
tional Forces-Iraq and in high visi-
bility roles including commanding gen-
eral, Military District of Washington. 
Placing mission and Nation first, he 
excelled in every endeavor. 
Between assignments leading sol-
diers, Lieutenant General Swan dem-
onstrated his longstanding commit-
ment 
to 
continuous 
learning. 
He 
earned master’s degrees in military art 
and science from the U.S. Army’s 
School of Advanced Military Studies 
and in national security studies from 
Georgetown 
University. 
Seamlessly 
stitching his knowledge gained in aca-
demia with his military experience, 
Lieutenant General Swan made consid-
erable contributions as a thought lead-
er in national security throughout his 
career. He served as a national security 
fellow at the John F. Kennedy School 
of Government at Harvard University 
and as a member of the Council on For-
eign Relations, the Aspen Institute 
Homeland Security Group, and the 
Federal Emergency Management Agen-
cy—FEMA—National Advisory Coun-
cil. 
Following his retirement in Decem-
ber of 2011 from the U.S. Army, Lieu-
tenant General Swan continued to 
serve in support of soldiers, their fami-
lies, Army civilians, and veterans as 
vice president for education at AUSA. 
Through his committed leadership, vi-
sion, and always positive outlook, 
Lieutenant General Swan responded to 
ever-changing interests and needs of 
the Army by expanding and improving 
AUSA’s support for professional devel-
opment and education. His work also 
heightened public interest in the ap-
propriate role of the Army in defense of 
our Nation. His priority programs to 
achieve these goals included creating 
AUSA’s world-class ‘‘ARMY’’ maga-
zine, building a family readiness pro-
gram that reaches out to Army fami-
lies worldwide, refocusing AUSA-spon-
sored writing contests to build critical 
thinking and research skills in the 
Army, expanding the AUSA book pro-
gram to include discussions with au-
thors having expert knowledge on the 
Army and the Nation’s security chal-
lenges, and establishing an AUSA fel-
lowship program to provide profes-
sional development opportunities for 
mid-level Army officers. In developing 
and supporting these diverse efforts, he 
ensured AUSA made the Army, across 
all of its components, a more profes-
sional and capable organization. 
He also continued to give back to his 
alma mater, West Point, serving as a 
Presidentially appointed member of its 
Board of Visitors. In this capacity, he 
contributed to the development of the 
next generation of academy graduates 
entrusted with the privilege of leading 
American soldiers. 
Lieutenant General Swan has served 
the Nation he loves with great distinc-
tion and has been an exemplary leader 
for the servicemembers, families, and 
civilians of the Armed Forces. His 
steady leadership, positive outlook, 
and professionalism have been a sus-
taining source of strength for those he 
has led, coached, mentored, and taught 
through four decades of service. 
On behalf of the Senate and the 
United States of America, we thank 
Lieutenant General Swan, his wife 
Melanie, and their entire family for 
their commitment, sacrifice, and con-
tributions to our Nation. We join our 
colleagues in wishing him a long and 
joyful retirement. Well done.

June 7, 2022 
ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS 
TRIBUTE TO BRIGADIER GENERAL 
LELAND SHEPHERD 
∑ Mr. BOOZMAN. Mr. President, I rise 
to recognize Colonel Leland ‘‘Tony’’ 
Shepherd on his selection as Arkansas 
Army National Guard’s 6th Land Com-
ponent commander and his promotion 
to the rank of brigadier general on 
June 5, 2022. 
On June 12, 2022, General Shepherd 
will assume command of Arkansas 
Army’s eight land power units with a 
force size of 6,700 personnel tasked with 
operational readiness, training, mobili-
zation, and deployments supporting my 
great State and in defense of an even 
greater Nation. This historical selec-
tion makes him the first African-Amer-
ican man to hold such a prestigious po-
sition and only the second African- 
American man to be promoted as a 
general officer in the history of the Ar-
kansas National Guard. 
General Shepherd began his military 
career in the U.S. Army Reserve in 
Philadelphia, PA, on July 23, 1992. He 
then transitioned to the Arkansas 
Army National Guard as an enlisted 
soldier in October 1995 and was com-
missioned to second lieutenant in Au-
gust 1998. General Shepherd has served 
in several positions over the past 27 
years, including assignments as a sig-
nal officer in the 212th Signal Bat-
talion in Little Rock and as part of the 
39th Infantry Brigade Combat Team in 
Malvern, AR. General Shepherd also 
deployed 
twice 
to 
Iraq 
where 
he 
oversaw Camp Victory’s post signal ca-
pabilities. Prior to this selection for 
the 6th Land Component Command, he 
served as the State’s deputy chief of 
staff G–6 overseeing the planning, 
strategy, network architecture, and 
implementation of command, control, 
communications, 
and 
networks 
for 
Army operations. 
General Shepherd received the Order 
of Mercury, Bronze for the highest 
standards of integrity, moral char-
acter, professional competence, and 
selflessness for those who have made 
significant contributions to the U.S. 
Army Signal Corps. This award reflects 
his superior performance and devotion 
to duty throughout his entire profes-
sional career. 
I would like to recognize General 
Shephard’s wife Zandral and children 
Anthony, 
Ryan 
Wells, 
Logan, 
and 
Lukas for their sacrifice and service. It 
is their steadfast support of their hus-
band and dad that enabled his contin-
ued service, ultimately leading to this 
historic promotion. As the son of 
George and Gwendoline Shepherd of 
Guyana, South America, General Shep-
herd is the epitome of the American 
dream which is founded on the belief 
that we all can attain our own version 
of 
success 
and 
achieve 
prosperity 
through hard work. 
General Shepherd, congratulations 
on this new chapter in your career. I 
join my colleagues in the Senate and 
all Arkansans as we express our appre-
ciation for you and your family’s con-
tinued service to our country.∑ 
f 
RECOGNIZING THE HEALTH 
WAGON 
∑ Mr. KAINE. Mr. President, as we con-
tinue our battle with COVID–19, we 
must acknowledge the healthcare heal-
ers that are serving in our rural com-
munities. In particular, I would like to 
highlight the work of the Health 
Wagon in Virginia. The Health Wagon 
is the oldest mobile clinic in the Na-
tion. Their mission is to provide com-
passionate, quality healthcare to medi-
cally underserved people in Appa-
lachia. The Health Wagon works to 
mitigate barriers to healthcare access, 
taking healthcare into the community, 
into places like grocery stores, food 
banks, workplaces, and providing com-
munities in southwest Virginia with 
access to primary, specialty, dental 
and vision care. 
Health Wagon originated 40 years ago 
with Sister Bernadette Kenny of the 
Catholic order Medical Missionaries of 
Mary. Sister Bernie traveled on rural 
mountain roads in her Volkswagen 
Beetle to deliver healthcare to individ-
uals in southwest Virginia. Now, the 
organization employs more than 50 
staff members across four clinics and 
four mobile units. Their average pa-
tient is 41 years old, with 100 percent of 
patients being uninsured or under-
insured. Over the last year, the Health 
Wagon has served 10,857 individual pa-
tients and documented 35,250 patient 
encounters. 
The Health Wagon has also been vital 
in the fight against COVID–19. Since 
March 2020, the Health Wagon has pro-
vided more than 18,000 COVID–19 tests, 
provided 19,567 COVID–19 vaccinations, 
and administered over 5,500 monoclonal 
antibody treatments. They do not bill 
for services, and their programs are 
sustained by grants and donations from 
individuals, corporations, and founda-
tions. The Health Wagon is led by 
president and CEO, Dr. Teresa Tyson. 
Dr. Tyson has served with the Health 
Wagon for 30 years, and under her lead-
ership, the organization has received 
national recognition for its innovative 
projects 
in 
telehealth 
space. 
The 
Health Wagon was the first to deliver a 
virtual wound care clinic and con-
ducted the first FAA-approved drone 
delivery of medications in the United 
States. Dr. Tyson led the largest 
health outreach of its kind in the Na-
tion, as well as providing the first 
telecytoscopy in the world in partner-
ship with University of Virginia. Dr. 
Tyson leads a group of caring and com-
mitted providers. 
Rural communities are the backbone 
of our country, and the Health Wagon 
has served the Appalachia community 
admirably. I thank them for their serv-
ice.∑ 
TRIBUTE TO MARY M. HUNT 
∑ Mr. MANCHIN. Mr. President, I rise 
today to honor the long-time program 
director for community and economic 
development Mary M. Hunt upon her 
retirement after more than 20 remark-
able years of service to the Claude 
Worthington Benedum Foundation. 
I have often said there is no greater 
accomplishment than to find yourself 
in a position to give back to the com-
munity you love. As a Clarksburg na-
tive, Mary Hunt has served the people 
of her community and beyond with pro-
fessionalism, compassion, and respect 
throughout her entire career. 
Mary has never taken any position 
she has held lightly—and has always 
seen herself primarily as a servant of 
the people of West Virginia. She 
worked tirelessly for the Charleston 
mayor’s office of economic and commu-
nity development throughout the late 
‘80s and early ‘90s. Mary found herself 
in the capital city at a pivotal time, 
when major development projects were 
coming to fruition. It is hard to imag-
ine a Charleston today without such 
iconic spaces as Haddad Riverfront 
Park and Capitol Market, but Mary 
was there when the ideas were con-
ceived and helped bring them to re-
ality. 
Mary made her mark in State gov-
ernment, too. In the early 1990s, during 
Gaston Caperton’s administration, she 
worked as executive assistant to the 
cabinet secretary for the West Virginia 
Department of Commerce for 2 years 
and then as the chief of administration 
for the West Virginia Department of 
Environmental Protection for 5 years, 
through 1997. Truly, her legacy of civic 
service is one we should all instill in 
ourselves. 
Throughout her time as program di-
rector at the Benedum Foundation, 
Mary served as an irreplaceable leader 
by advancing the foundation’s existing 
programs and starting new initiatives 
to ensure the organization’s continued 
viability and positive social impact. 
Time and time again, Mary has made 
her devotion to helping others abun-
dantly clear—not only through her phi-
lanthropy projects, but by building new 
partnerships and inviting others into 
the fold—ultimately bolstering her ca-
pacity for good. 
Over the last two decades, Mary has 
helped numerous communities, both in-
ternally and externally, to help them 
make their projects possible. During 
her tenure, she has helped distribute 
grants in almost all 55 of West Vir-
ginia’s counties, supporting nearly 650 
grant projects and touching roughly 
200 organizations. 
With an unrivaled, strong spirit of 
optimism and innovation, her commit-
ment to strengthening our commu-
nities is something to admire. Her 
work has undoubtedly advanced the 
foundation, but more importantly, our 
entire State. I know she has inspired 
many young leaders throughout her il-
lustrious career, and I am confident 
that they will carry the torch to ensure 
a brighter tomorrow.

I will always be grateful to Mary for 
her passion for serving the people of 
West Virginia. While she is retiring and 
everyone is sure to miss her strong 
leadership, Mary Hunt’s unwavering 
dedication will leave a lasting legacy 
on the countless lives she has touched. 
Again, I congratulate Mary for her re-

happiness to Mary and her family in

MOTING 
STRONGER 
ECONOMIC 
RELATIONS 
BETWEEN 
THE 
UNITED STATES AND COUNTRIES 
IN 
LATIN 
AMERICA 
AND 
THE 
CARIBBEAN 
Mr. MENENDEZ (for himself, Mr. 
YOUNG, Mr. KAINE, Mr. HAGERTY, and 
Mr. COONS) submitted the following 
resolution; which was referred to the 
Committee on Foreign Relations: 
S. RES. 661 
Whereas, to maintain the role of the 
United States as a global economic leader 
and protect the national security interests of 
the United States, the United States must 
strengthen economic relations with coun-
tries in the Western Hemisphere; 
Whereas ongoing supply chain disruptions 
resulting from the COVID–19 pandemic dem-
onstrate the need for the United States to 
increase supply chain resiliency through re-
shoring and nearshoring initiatives; 
Whereas, in 2019, the People’s Republic of 
China was the top supplier of goods imported 
into the United States, providing significant 
quantities of rare earth minerals, pharma-
ceutical ingredients, medical equipment, and 
other goods vital to the economic prosperity 
and national security of the United States; 
Whereas the COVID–19 pandemic and pro-
duction outages and shipping disruptions in 
the People’s Republic of China have jeopard-
ized worldwide access to critical goods, con-
tributing to an unprecedented, ongoing sup-
ply chain crisis that has exposed the severe 
risks of concentrating global supply chains 
in the People’s Republic of China; 
Whereas Congress has raised concerns 
about the reliance of the United States on 
global supply chains based in the People’s 
Republic of China; 
Whereas the People’s Republic of China has 
shown its willingness to use critical supplies 
as a political tool to advance the goals of the 
Chinese Communist Party, including when 
the People’s Republic of China— 
(1) threatened to withhold rare earth min-
eral shipments to Japan; and 
(2) utilized personal protective equipment 
and vaccines as a diplomatic tool; 
Whereas findings made pursuant to a sup-
ply chain review required by President Jo-
seph R. Biden, Jr., under Executive Order 
14017 (86 Fed. Reg. 11849) and released on 
June 8, 2021, recommended that, in addition 
to expanding domestic production capacity, 
the United States Government use diplo-
matic and financial tools to cooperate with 
allies to create more diverse, resilient, and 
secure supply chains; 
Whereas 8 of the 13 countries in the world 
that recognize Taiwan are in Latin America 
and the Caribbean, and nearshoring initia-
tives can help decrease the susceptibility of 
such countries to coercive economic pressure 
from the People’s Republic of China;

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2816 
June 7, 2022 
Whereas the United States has free trade 
agreements in effect with 12 countries in 
Latin America and the Caribbean, more than 
in any other geographic region, providing 
significant incentives to relocate inter-
national supply chains that cannot be relo-
cated to the United States to Latin America 
and the Caribbean; 
Whereas, in addition to existing free trade 
agreements and the geographic proximity of 
countries in Latin America and the Carib-
bean to the United States, there are several 
significant advantages for the United States 
Government and United States entities to 
relocate supply chains from the People’s Re-
public of China to the Western Hemisphere, 
including— 
(1) reduced distance to markets in the 
United States, which will lower freight costs, 
enable quicker adaptability to fluctuating 
consumer demand, and reduce the energy 
used to transport goods; 
(2) longstanding bilateral ties and shared 
democratic values, which lessen the risk of 
geopolitical disruptions to supply chains; 
(3) comparative advantages for sourcing 
and manufacturing key critical goods, in-
cluding 
rare 
earth 
minerals, 
pharma-
ceuticals, medical goods, and semiconduc-
tors, when there is a historical inability for 
such goods to be entirely sourced or manu-
factured in the United States; and 
(4) access to a highly qualified and young 
working-age population; 
Whereas the report entitled ‘‘Widening the 
Aperture: Nearshoring in Our ‘Near Abroad’ ’’ 
released by the Wilson Center in April 2021 
provided 
evidence 
that 
increasing 
and 
strengthening supply chains regionally, par-
ticularly in Colombia, Mexico, and other 
countries in the Caribbean and Central 
America, will, on average, create more jobs 
in the United States than international sup-
ply chains located in other geographic re-
gions; 
Whereas switching as few as 15 percent of 
imports into the United States from the top 
10 source countries of such imports outside 
of the Western Hemisphere to countries in 
Latin America and the Caribbean would in-
crease exports from Latin America and the 
Caribbean by $72,000,000,000 annually, helping 
the region recover from the effects of the 
COVID–19 pandemic and reducing pressures 
encouraging migration to the United States; 
Whereas, despite existing and growing op-
portunities for countries in Latin America 
and the Caribbean to become crucial actors 
in global supply chains, including techno-
logical advances that have diminished the 
need to produce in countries with a low cost 
of labor, challenges to nearshoring remain, 
including— 
(1) concerns about the rule of law, corrup-
tion, and criminal activities that discourage 
foreign direct investment or significantly 
raise the costs of shifting production to the 
region; 
(2) concerns about compliance with and en-
forcement of international labor and envi-
ronmental standards; 
(3) underdeveloped physical and digital in-
frastructure; and 
(4) regional economic fragmentation; 
Whereas the governments of several coun-
tries in Latin America and the Caribbean, in-
cluding Colombia, the Dominican Republic, 
and Mexico, have sought to strengthen eco-
nomic relations with the United States and 
launched 
initiatives 
to 
incentivize 
nearshoring; 
Whereas the Inter-American Development 
Bank (commonly known as ‘‘IDB’’) has 
prioritized efforts to encourage nearshoring 
in Latin America and the Caribbean, includ-
ing by— 
(1) making economic integration and the 
strengthening of regional supply chains 1 of 
5 core pillars in the agenda outlined in the 
document entitled ‘‘Vision 2025, Reinvest in 
the Americas’’; 
(2) including nearshoring as a business line 
of IDB Invest for the first time in the history 
of IDB; 
(3) hosting a high-level dialogue with more 
than 500 private sector leaders on December 
2, 2020, to assess how to increase production 
capacity and supply chain resilience in the 
region; and 
(4) launching the largest private sector co-
alition in the history of the IDB to explore 
opportunities for reinvesting in countries in 
the Western Hemisphere, including through 
nearshoring initiatives and a toolkit to 
incentivize and finance nearshoring activi-
ties in the Western Hemisphere; and 
Whereas the United States Government 
can leverage diplomatic, foreign assistance, 
and financing tools to strengthen the par-
ticipation of Latin American and the Carib-
bean in global supply chains and address 
challenges to nearshoring, including through 
the activities of the United States Agency 
for 
International 
Development 
and 
the 
United States International Development Fi-
nance Corporation: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) recognizes that increased tensions be-
tween the United States and the People’s Re-
public of China and the COVID–19 pandemic 
have— 
(A) exposed severe vulnerabilities attrib-
utable to overreliance by the United States 
and other countries on supply chains based 
solely or mainly in the People’s Republic of 
China; and 
(B) heightened the importance of the 
United States diversifying its supply chains 
through reshoring and nearshoring initia-
tives to increase resiliency against future 
disruptions; 
(2) emphasizes that reshoring efforts of suf-
ficient scale to increase domestic production 
capacity and relocate supply chains to the 
United States remain critical and should be 
encouraged and implemented; 
(3) emphasizes that— 
(A) nearshoring efforts should be pursued 
in 
a 
complementary 
fashion 
to 
better 
achieve more resilient, diverse, and secure 
supply chains, particularly for goods un-
likely to be manufactured in the United 
States; 
(B) nearshoring in Latin America and the 
Caribbean, relative to relying on supply 
chains in other geographic regions, has the 
greatest potential to contribute to the eco-
nomic prosperity and security of the United 
States while also advancing the post-pan-
demic economic recovery of countries in the 
Western Hemisphere; 
(C) nearshoring in Latin America and the 
Caribbean provides greater opportunities for 
expanding 
co-production 
operations 
and 
other cooperative business ventures with 
United States entities; and 
(D) nearshoring in Latin America and the 
Caribbean can complement and enhance ef-
forts by the United States to support demo-
cratic consolidation across the region by 
strengthening the rule of law, encouraging 
competitiveness, and raising standards on 
corruption, labor, and environmental issues; 
(4) supports initiatives by the Inter-Amer-
ican Development Bank, governments in 
Latin America and the Caribbean, and the 
private sector to finance, incentivize, or oth-
erwise promote nearshoring in Latin Amer-
ica and the Caribbean; 
(5) encourages the United States Agency 
for 
International 
Development 
and 
the 
United States International Development Fi-
nance 
Corporation 
to 
strengthen 
pro-
grammatic support for initiatives likely to 
facilitate the relocation of global supply 
chains to the Western Hemisphere, including 
through increased collaboration with each 
other, the private sector, the Inter-American 
Development Bank, and countries in Latin 
America and the Caribbean; 
(6) calls for governments in Latin America 
and the Caribbean to increase opportunities 
for nearshoring in the region by— 
(A) modernizing and consolidating physical 
and digital infrastructure; 
(B) combating corruption, strengthening 
the rule of law, enhancing labor and environ-
mental standards, and improving democratic 
governance; and 
(C) pursuing other efforts to facilitate the 
ease of doing business in and attract foreign 
direct investment to the region, including by 
leveraging strong relationships with Taiwan; 
and 
(7) urges the Secretary of State, in coordi-
nation with the United States Agency for 
International 
Development, 
the 
United 
States International Development Finance 
Corporation, and the heads of all other rel-
evant Federal agencies and departments, to 
take a leading role in advancing nearshoring 
in Latin America and the Caribbean, includ-
ing by— 
(A) strengthening support for the activities 
described in paragraph (6); 
(B) engaging with governments in the 
Western Hemisphere to explore opportunities 
to lower trade barriers, streamline customs 
and other regulations, support capacity 
building programs to strengthen environ-
mental and labor standards, establish incen-
tives for mutually beneficial co-production 
arrangements, and facilitate economic inte-
gration of the region; 
(C) strengthening legal regimes and moni-
toring and enforcement measures relating to 
labor standards to ensure that— 
(i) any enhanced sourcing relationship 
with a country does not support or beget 
labor abuse or other human rights abuses, 
such as those found in the People’s Republic 
of China; and 
(ii) 
any 
new 
investment 
under 
a 
nearshoring program has sufficient labor 
standards and benefits the workers in such 
country; 
(D) ensuring that nearshoring activities 
are consistent with efforts to improve supply 
chain energy efficiency, reduce the energy 
used to transport goods, and advance envi-
ronmental sustainability; and 
(E) working in partnership with multilat-
eral development banks and private inves-
tors to create incentives for entities to relo-
cate supply chains from the People’s Repub-
lic of China to the Western Hemisphere, in-
cluding by financing the development of re-
gional technology hubs with strong labor 
and environmental regulations.

June 7, 2022 
Whereas, according to the National Insti-
tute of Mental Health, before the COVID–19 
pandemic, nearly 1 in 5 adults in the United 
States lived with a mental illness; 
Whereas, according to the Centers for Dis-
ease Control and Prevention (referred to in 
this preamble as the ‘‘CDC’’), before the 
COVID–19 pandemic, up to 1 in 5 children 
who were 3 to 17 years of age reported a men-
tal, emotional, developmental, or behavioral 
disorder; 
Whereas, 
according 
to 
the 
CDC, 
the 
COVID–19 pandemic has been associated with 
mental health challenges; 
Whereas the ‘‘Stress in America 2021: 
Stress and Decision-Making during the Pan-
demic’’ poll found that— 
(1) 32 percent of adults, including 48 per-
cent of Millennials, have so much stress 
about the COVID–19 pandemic that they 
struggle to make basic decisions, such as 
what to wear or what to eat; 
(2) 59 percent of adults experienced behav-
ior changes as a result of stress in the past 
month; and 
(3) 63 percent of adults agreed that uncer-
tainty about what the next few months 
would be like caused stress for those individ-
uals; 
Whereas the April 2, 2021, CDC Morbidity 
and Mortality Weekly Report found that, 
during the COVID-19 pandemic, the percent-
age of adults with symptoms of an anxiety or 
a depressive disorder during the 7 days pre-
ceding the study rose from 36.4 percent in 
August 2020 to 41.5 percent in February 2021; 
Whereas a Household Pulse Survey in De-
cember 2021 found that 30.7 percent of adults 
reported symptoms of anxiety or depressive 
disorder, which is up from 11 percent in 2019, 
and, among those adults, 27.8 percent re-
ported an unmet need for counseling or ther-
apy; 
Whereas, according to the CDC, nearly 1 in 
6 children has a mental, behavioral, or devel-
opmental disorder, such as anxiety or depres-
sion, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder 
(commonly referred to as ‘‘ADHD’’), autism 
spectrum disorder (commonly referred to as 
‘‘ASD’’), disruptive behavior disorder, or 
Tourette syndrome; 
Whereas, according to data collected by

mental health during the COVID–19 pan-
demic, and 44 percent of those students re-
ported they persistently felt sad or hopeless; 
Whereas, according to the CDC, mental 
health disorders are chronic conditions, and, 
without proper diagnosis and treatment with

problems at home, in school, and with their 
development; 
Whereas, according to the CDC, children 
with mental, emotional, or behavioral dis-
orders benefit from early diagnosis and

of depression and anxiety symptoms during 
COVID–19 has doubled from pre-pandemic 
rates; 
Whereas, in December 2021, the Surgeon 
General of the Public Health Service, Dr. 
Vivek Murthy, issued a new Surgeon Gen-
eral’s Advisory—

United States have lost a parent or primary 
caregiver to COVID–19, which continues to 
raise concerns about the emotional well- 
being of children; 
Whereas, according to the Health Re-
sources and Services Administration’s Be-
havioral 
Health 
Workforce 
Projections, 
many areas of the United States are cur-
rently experiencing a shortage of behavioral 
health care providers, particularly those 
with experience in treating children and ado-
lescents; 
Whereas a July 2021 survey by the National 
Council for Mental Wellbeing found that, 
during the 12-month period preceding the

health; 
Whereas the number of adults reporting su-
icidal ideation in 2021 increased by 664,000 
when compared with the 2020 dataset; 
Whereas the 2021 National Veteran Suicide 
Prevention Annual Report stated that vet-
erans— 
(1) account for 13.7 percent of suicides 
among United States adults; and 
(2) have a 52.3 percent greater rate of sui-
cide than the non-veteran United States pop-
ulation; 
Whereas individuals between 10 and 24 
years of age account for 14 percent of all sui-
cides; 
Whereas suicide is the ninth leading cause 
of death for adults between 35 and 64 years of 
age, and adults between 35 and 64 years of 
age account for 47.2 percent of all suicides in 
the United States;

were 3 times more likely to report suicidal 
ideation, at 30.6 percent in the month pre-
ceding the study, compared to individuals 
without disabilities, at 8.3 percent; and 
Whereas it would be appropriate to observe 
May 2022 as ‘‘Mental Health Awareness 
Month’’: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) supports the designation of May 2022 as 
‘‘Mental Health Awareness Month’’ to re-
move the stigma associated with mental ill-
ness and place emphasis on scientific find-
ings regarding mental health recovery; 
(2) declares mental health to be a national 
priority; 
(3) recognizes that mental well-being is as 
important as physical well-being for citizens, 
communities, schools, businesses, and the 
economy in the United States; 
(4) applauds the coalescing of national, 
State, local, medical, and faith-based organi-
zations in—

port during the COVID–19 pandemic to indi-
viduals and families affected by mental ill-
ness; and

States Code, and subject to section 1113 of 
such title, for disabilities where there is af-
firmative evidence to establish that a per-
sonal injury suffered or disease contracted in 
line of duty for which there is a recognized 
cause, or for aggravation of a preexisting dis-
ease contracted in line of duty for which 
there is a recognized cause, in the active 
military, naval, air, or space service, during 
a period of war, the United States will pay to 
any veteran thus disabled and who was dis-
charged or released under conditions other 
than dishonorable from the period of service 
in which said injury or disease was incurred, 
or preexisting injury or disease was aggra-
vated, compensation, but no compensation 
shall be paid if the disability is a result of 
the veteran’s own willful misconduct or 
abuse of alcohol or drugs. 
SA 5051. Mr. TESTER (for himself 
and Mr. MORAN) submitted an amend-
ment intended to be proposed by him

perienced a toxic exposure during the active 
military, naval, air, or space service of the 
veteran. 
‘‘(c) ASSESSMENTS.—(1) The Working Group 
shall assess cases of the toxic exposure of 
veterans and their dependents that occurred 
during active military, naval, air, or space 
service, including by conducting ongoing 
surveillance and reviewing such exposure de-
scribed in scientific literature, media re-
ports, information from veterans, and infor-
mation from Congress. 
‘‘(2) The assessments under paragraph (1) 
shall cover suspected and known toxic expo-
sures 
occurring 
during 
active 
military, 
naval, air, or space service, including by 
identifying and evaluating new and emerging 
toxic exposures that are not recognized 
under existing presumptions of service con-
nection. 
‘‘(3) The Working Group may conduct an 
assessment under paragraph (1) in response 
to a comment received under paragraph (2) 
or (3) of subsection (a). 
‘‘(4) The Working Group shall, in consulta-
tion with the Secretary of Defense, on a peri-
odic basis, assess the Individual Longitu-
dinal Exposure Record to ensure the accu-
racy of data collected. 
‘‘(d) DEVELOPMENT OF RECOMMENDATIONS.— 
(1) Following an assessment of a case of the 
toxic exposure of veterans that occurred dur-
ing active military, naval, air, or space serv-
ice under subsection (c), or their dependents, 
the Working Group may develop a rec-
ommendation for formal evaluation under 
section 1173 of this title to conduct a review 
of the health effects related to the case of ex-
posure if the Working Group determines that 
the research may change the current under-
standing of the relationship between an ex-
posure to an environmental hazard and ad-
verse health outcomes in humans. 
‘‘(2) Upon receipt of evidence suggesting 
that previous findings regarding the periods 
and locations of exposure covered by an ex-
isting presumption of service connection are 
no longer supported, the Working Group may 
nominate such evidence for formal evalua-
tion under section 1173 of this title to modify 
the periods and locations. 
‘‘(e) REPORTS BY THE WORKING GROUP.—Not 
less frequently than once each year, the 
Working Group shall submit to the Sec-
retary, the Committee on Veterans’ Affairs 
of the Senate, and the Committee on Vet-
erans’ Affairs of the House of Representa-
tives, and make publicly available, a report 
on— 
‘‘(1) 
recommendations 
developed 
under 
subsection (d), if any; and 
‘‘(2) recommendations for such legislative 
or administrative action as the Working 
Group considers necessary for the Working 
Group to be more effective in carrying out 
the requirements of this section. 
‘‘(f) RESPONSES
BY
SECRETARY.—In re-
sponse to each report submitted under sub-
section (e), the Secretary shall, not later 
than 30 days after receiving the report, ini-
tiate a formal evaluation pursuant to section 
1173 of this title. 
‘‘§ 1173. Formal evaluation of recommenda-
tions 
‘‘(a) FORMAL EVALUATIONS.—The Secretary 
shall establish a process to conduct a formal 
evaluation 
with 
respect 
to 
each 
rec-
ommendation made by the Working Group 
under section 1172 of this title. 
‘‘(b) EVIDENCE, DATA, AND FACTORS.—The 
Secretary shall ensure that each formal 
evaluation under subsection (a) covers the 
following: 
‘‘(1) Scientific evidence, based on the re-
view of available scientific literature, in-
cluding human, toxicological, animal, and 
methodological studies, and other factors. 
‘‘(2) Claims data, based on the review of 
claim rate, grant rate, and service connec-
tion prevalence, and other factors. 
‘‘(3) Other factors the Secretary deter-
mines appropriate, such as— 
‘‘(A) the level of disability and mortality 
caused by the health effects related to the 
case of toxic exposure being evaluated; 
‘‘(B) the quantity and quality of the infor-
mation available and reviewed; 
‘‘(C) the feasibility of and period for gener-
ating relevant information and evidence; 
‘‘(D) whether such health effects are 
combat- or deployment-related; 
‘‘(E) the ubiquity or rarity of the health ef-
fects; and 
‘‘(F) any time frame during which a health 
effect must become manifest. 
‘‘(c) CONDUCT
OF
EVALUATIONS.—(1) The 
Secretary shall ensure that each formal 
evaluation under subsection (a)— 
‘‘(A) reviews scientific evidence in a man-
ner that— 
‘‘(i) conforms to principles of scientific and 
data integrity; 
‘‘(ii) is free from suppression or distortion 
of scientific or technological findings, data, 
information, conclusions, or technical re-
sults; and 
‘‘(B)(i) evaluates the likelihood that a posi-
tive association exists between an illness and 
a toxic exposure while serving in the active 
military, naval, air, or space service; and 
‘‘(ii) assesses the toxic exposures and ill-
nesses and determines whether the evidence 
supports a finding of a positive association 
between the toxic exposure and the illness. 
‘‘(2) In carrying out paragraph (1)(B)(ii), a 
formal evaluation under subsection (a) shall 
include reviewing all relevant data to deter-
mine the strength of evidence for a positive 
association based on the following four cat-
egories: 
‘‘(A) The ‘sufficient’ category, where the 
evidence is sufficient to conclude that a posi-
tive association exists. 
‘‘(B) The ‘equipoise and above’ category, 
where the evidence is sufficient to conclude 
that a positive association is at least as like-
ly as not, but not sufficient to conclude that 
a positive association exists. 
‘‘(C) The ‘below equipoise’ category, where 
the evidence is not sufficient to conclude 
that a positive association is at least as like-
ly as not, or is not sufficient to make a sci-
entifically informed judgment. 
‘‘(D) The ‘against’ category, where the evi-
dence suggests the lack of a positive associa-
tion. 
‘‘(d) RECOMMENDATION FOR ESTABLISHING A 
PRESUMPTION
OF SERVICE CONNECTION.—Not 
later than 120 days after the date on which a 
formal evaluation is commenced, the ele-
ment of the Department that conducts the 
evaluation shall submit to the Secretary a 
recommendation with respect to establishing 
a presumption of service connection for the 
toxic exposure and illness, or modifying an 
existing presumption of service connection, 
covered by the evaluation.

partment hospital care, medical services, or

of this title pursuant to subsection (d)(1)(D) 
of such section using the following eligi-
bility access standards:

eran with a health care provider of the De-
partment— 
‘‘(i) within 30 minutes average driving time 
from the residence of the veteran; and 
‘‘(ii) within 20 days of the date of request 
for such an appointment unless a later date

sultation with the health care provider. 
‘‘(B) With respect to specialty care or spe-
cialty services, if the Department cannot 
schedule an appointment for the covered vet-
eran with a health care provider of the De-
partment— 
‘‘(i) within 60 minutes average driving time 
from the residence of the veteran; and 
‘‘(ii) within 28 days of the date of request 
for such an appointment unless a later date 
has been agreed to by the veteran in con-
sultation with the health care provider. 
‘‘(2) For the purposes of determining the 
eligibility of a covered veteran for care or 
services under paragraph (1), the Secretary 
shall not take into consideration the avail-
ability of telehealth appointments from the 
Department when determining whether the 
Department is able to furnish such care or 
services in a manner that complies with the 
eligibility access standards under such para-
graph.

MUNITY CARE.—(1) Subject to subsection (c),

the veteran; and 
‘‘(ii) within 28 days of the date of request 
for such an appointment unless a later date 
has been agreed to by the veteran. 
‘‘(2) The Secretary shall ensure that— 
‘‘(A) health care providers specified under 
section 1703(c) of this title are able to com-
ply with the applicable access to care stand-
ards under paragraph (1) for such providers; 
and 
‘‘(B) meeting such standards is reflected in 
the contractual requirements of third-party 
administrators. 
‘‘(c) WAIVERS TO ACCESS TO CARE STAND-
ARDS FOR COMMUNITY CARE PROVIDERS.—(1) A 
third-party administrator may request a 
waiver to the requirement to meet the access 
to care standards under subsection (b) if— 
‘‘(A)(i) the scarcity of available providers 
or facilities in the region precludes the 
third-party 
administrator 
from 
meeting 
those access standards; or 
‘‘(ii) the landscape of providers or facilities 
has changed and certain providers or facili-
ties are not available such that the third- 
party administrator is not able to meet 
those access standards; and 
‘‘(B) to address the scarcity of available 
providers or the change in the provider or fa-
cility landscape, as the case may be, the 
third-party administrator has contracted 
with other providers or facilities that may 
not meet those access standards, but are the 
currently available providers or facilities 
most accessible to veterans within the re-
gion of responsibility of the third-party ad-
ministrator. 
‘‘(2) Any waiver requested by a third-party 
administrator under paragraph (1) must be 
requested in writing and submitted to the 
Office of Community Care of the Department 
for approval by that office. 
‘‘(3) As part of any waiver request under 
paragraph (1), a third-party administrator 
must include conclusive evidence and docu-
mentation that the access to care standards 
under subsection (b) cannot be met because 
of scarcity of available providers or changes 
to the landscape of providers or facilities. 
‘‘(4) In evaluating a waiver request under 
paragraph (1), the Secretary shall consider 
the following: 
‘‘(A) The number and geographic distribu-
tion of eligible health care providers avail-
able within the geographic area and spe-
cialty referenced in the waiver request. 
‘‘(B) The prevailing market conditions 
within the geographic area and specialty ref-
erenced in the waiver request, which shall 
include the number and distribution of 
health care providers contracting with other 
health care plans (including commercial 
plans and the Medicare program under title 
XVIII of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 
1395 et seq.)) operating in the geographic 
area and specialty referenced in the waiver 
request. 
‘‘(C) Whether the service area is comprised 
of highly rural, rural, or urban areas or some 
combination of such areas. 
‘‘(D) How significantly the waiver request 
differs from the access to care standards 
under subsection (b). 
‘‘(E) The rates offered to providers in the 
geographic area covered by the waiver. 
‘‘(5) The Secretary shall not consider in-
ability to contract as a valid sole rationale 
for granting a waiver under paragraph (1). 
‘‘(d) CALCULATION
OF DRIVING TIMES
AND 
WAIT TIMES.—(1) For purposes of calculating 
average driving time from the residence of 
the veteran under subsections (a) and (b), the 
Secretary shall use geographic information 
system software. 
‘‘(2) For purposes of calculating the wait 
time for a veteran to schedule an appoint-
ment with the Department under subsection 
(a), the Secretary shall measure from the 
date of request for the appointment unless a 
later date has been agreed to by the veteran 
in consultation with a health care provider 
of the Department to the first next available 
appointment date in the clinic schedule rel-
evant to the requested medical service. 
‘‘(e) PERIODIC REVIEW
OF ACCESS STAND-
ARDS.—Not later than three years after the 
date of the enactment of the Sergeant First 
Class Heath Robinson Honoring our Promise 
to Address Comprehensive Toxics Act of 2022, 
and not less frequently than once every 
three years thereafter, the Secretary shall— 
‘‘(1) conduct a review of the eligibility ac-
cess standards under subsection (a) and the 
access to care standards under subsection (b) 
in consultation with— 
‘‘(A) such Federal entities as the Secretary 
considers appropriate, including the Depart-
ment of Defense, the Department of Health 
and Human Services, and the Centers for 
Medicare & Medicaid Services; 
‘‘(B) entities in the private sector; and 
‘‘(C) other entities that are not part of the 
Federal Government; and 
‘‘(2) submit to the appropriate committees 
of Congress a report on— 
‘‘(A) the findings of the Secretary with re-
spect to the review conducted under para-
graph (1); and 
‘‘(B) such recommendations as the Sec-
retary may have with respect to the eligi-
bility access standards under subsection (a) 
and the access to care standards under sub-
section (b).’’; 
(2) in subsection (f), by striking ‘‘The Sec-
retary’’ and inserting ‘‘COMPLIANCE BY COM-
MUNITY CARE PROVIDERS.—The Secretary’’; 
(3) by striking subsection (g) and inserting 
the following new subsection (g): 
‘‘(g) PUBLICATION OF ACCESS STANDARDS.— 
The Secretary shall publish in the Federal

lished under subsection (a); and

HONORING 
ST. 
PAUL 
POLICE 
CHIEF TODD AXTELL ON THE OC-
CASION OF HIS RETIREMENT 
HON. BETTY McCOLLUM 
OF MINNESOTA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, June 7, 2022 
Ms. MCCOLLUM. Madam Speaker, I rise to 
honor Chief Todd Axtell, upon his retirement 
on June 1 after more than 30 years of service 
to the City of Saint Paul Police Department in-
cluding six years as Chief of Police. A dedi-
cated and respected public servant, his lead-
ership carried the department through many 
tumultuous times as he worked to build trust 
and transparency between the police and the 
Saint Paul community. 
Chief Axtell grew up in Northfield, Min-
nesota, and after pursuing a law enforcement 
degree landed a job with the Saint Paul Police 
Department in 1989. Throughout his time with 
the department, he worked in all three patrol 
districts, the gang unit, narcotics and special 
investigations. After 26 years with the depart-
ment, Axtell was appointed Chief of Police by 
then Saint Paul Mayor Chris Coleman in June 
of 2016. 
As Chief, and throughout his prior leader-
ship positions in the department, he worked 
toward three priorities—community engage-
ment, diversifying the police department and 
addressing gun violence. He launched the 
Law Enforcement Career Path Academy to re-
cruit a more diverse group of young people 
who would normally face obstacles to becom-
ing a police officer, and started the Community 
Outreach Stabilization unit which pairs social 
workers with specially trained officers to work 
with people who are mentally ill, homeless or 
chemically dependent. He has been a con-
sistent advocate for his officers but also held 
them to a high standard, overseeing increased 
training and transparency programs, and al-
ways being quick to acknowledge and respond 
to cases of misconduct. 
Well known for his desire to get to know the 
community he served, Chief Axtell is spoken 
of highly by the city’s religious leaders, elected 
officials, and many local community groups 
representing the diverse population of Saint 
Paul. He has been a steadfast partner to 
many, and our community has benefited great-
ly from his steady leadership. Madam Speak-
er, please join me in rising to pay tribute to 
Chief Todd Axtell as he retires from the Saint 
Paul Police Department after more than three 
decades of public service, and in honor of his 
ongoing commitment to improving public safe-
ty. 
TRIBUTE 
TO 
STEVE 
WAGNER, 
CASA 
FEDERAL 
LEGISLATIVE 
COMMITTEE CHAIR 
HON. SALUD O. CARBAJAL 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, June 7, 2022 
Mr. CARBAJAL. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today in recognition of Steve Wagner, General 
Manager of the Goleta Sanitary District. Steve 
is currently completing his term as the Cali-
fornia Association of Sanitation Agencies’ Fed-
eral Legislative Committee Chair. 
While Steve has been a member of the 
CASA Federal Legislative Committee for many 
years, his committee leadership during the 
past two years helped guide the group through 
unprecedented times due to the COVID–19 
pandemic and our successful support for the 
Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act that 
will lead our Nation’s investment in water infra-
structure. Steve’s tenure saw the successful 
implementation of CASA’ s federal policy prior-
ities that included the introduction of legislation 
to eliminate nondeteriorating single use wet 
wipes that contribute to plastic pollution in our 
environment, working to ensure that the pol-
luter pays principle is preserved when PFAS 
contamination cleanups are initiated, and sup-
porting commonsense approaches to climate 
change, such as water recycling assistance. 
During his time as Chair, the Federal Legis-
lative Committee fulfilled its responsibilities to 
establish CASA’s’ position on federal legisla-
tion that could impact its members, and keep 
policymakers informed on these and other vital 
public health matters. Of special note, in 2022 
Steve oversaw the return of the annual Wash-
ington D.C. policy forum that was disrupted in 
2021 due to pandemic restrictions. Steve per-
formed the duties of Chair while also fulfilling 
his responsibilities as General Manager and 
Principal Engineer for the Goleta Sanitary Dis-
trict. As General Manager, Steve oversees the 
entirety of the District’s 132 miles of waste-
water collection services, as well as the Dis-
trict’s role as the regional treatment facility for 
Goleta Valley. 
Madam Speaker, Steve Wagner leaves 
CASA and Federal Legislative Committee in a 
strong place, well prepared to continue to re-
spond to federal ’legislative and regulatory ac-
tions on behalf of CASA and the tens of mil-
lions of Californians that rely on CASA agen-
cies to deliver water quality and public health 
improvements. I respectfully ask that you join 
me in expressing immense gratitude to Steve 
Wagner for his extraordinary leadership of the 
California Association of Sanitation Agencies’ 
Federal Legislative Committee. 
RECOGNIZING BARRY SCHNEIDER 
HON. CAROLYN B. MALONEY 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, June 7, 2022 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New York. 
Madam Speaker, I rise to pay tribute to Barry 
Schneider, on the occasion of his retirement 
as longtime board member and former Chair 
of Manhattan Community Board 8 (CB8) after 
30 years of dedicated leadership and service. 
Mr. Schneider first began his history of com-
munity engagement after learning of plans to 
convert a vacant lot on 63rd Street to a park-
ing facility. Mr. Schneider joined with fellow 
residents to oppose the plan and express the 
negative impacts it would have on the area 
especially on the congestion at what was al-
ready a busy intersection. This group became 
the East Sixties Neighborhood Association, 
Inc. (ESNA). ESNA was successful in its ef-
forts, and the lot was instead converted into a 
community garden. 
Seeking to have a larger impact on more 
community issues after the success of ESNA, 
Mr. Schneider was appointed to CB8 in 1992. 
Throughout his time on CB8, Mr. Schneider 
was an advocate for community accessibility. 
Mr. Schneider instituted CB8’s attendance at 
District Street Fairs in order to promote famili-
arity and open communication between CB8 
and members of the public. 
Mr. Schneider carried his dedication into the 
work he performed on many of CB8’s Commit-
tees and Task Forces. Mr. Schneider co- 
chaired both the Transportation Committee 
and the Parks and Waterfront Committee, as 
well as serving as co-chair of a joint com-
mittee between CB8 and Manhattan Commu-
nity Board 6 to address issues affecting both 
communities. Mr. Schneider presided as chair 
of the Metropolitan Museum of Art Task Force, 
the Park Avenue Armory Task Force, and the 
Second Avenue Subway Task Force. 
During the construction of the Second Ave-
nue Subway, Mr. Schneider acted as a voice 
for the community. After attending meetings 
with the Metropolitan Transit Authority (MTA) 
and seeing concerns go unaddressed, Mr. 
Schneider advocated for a new meeting for-
mat that would focus on communities being 
heard, listened to, and respected. The new 
format created meetings where the MTA 
would be present at individual tables for the 
proposed neighborhood sites, allowing for di-
rect, local communication with those neighbor-
hoods. The format was effective, with commu-
nity members being able to express the 
unique needs of their neighborhood and the 
MTA responding accordingly directly aiding the 
successful completion of the Second Avenue 
Subway and its opening in 2017. 
Mr. Schneider served as Chair of CB8 from 
1998 to 2000 and focused a lot of energy on 
ensuring that all interactions at the Board were 
respectful especially when issues heightened 
passions. He supported frequent interaction 
between members of CB8 and the public,

while maintaining that discussion should be 
carried out with polite conduct and consider-
ation of others. He is known for his Civility 
sign, which he frequently hung on lecterns to 
facilitate respectful and productive discussion. 
He sought to encourage individuals to speak 
who normally would not, increase engage-
ment, and promote kindness. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in recognizing the accomplishments and 
contributions of Barry Schneider. His dedica-
tion and leadership have helped shape a vi-
brant community for Roosevelt Island and 
Manhattan’s Upper East Side. His presence 
on Community Board 8 will be missed, and he 
leaves a lasting impact with his devoted serv-
ice to his community.

The church was founded in 1947. At that 
time, it was the entry point to south Lexington. 
There weren’t any houses or other buildings in 
the area when the church was built. The 
neighborhood grew up around the church. 
As the congregation gathers to celebrate the 
75th anniversary, I recognize the impact that 
this congregation has made on the Lexington 
community over the years. The church has 
reached thousands of people with food, finan-
cial assistance, and spiritual sustenance. 
I congratulate Senior Pastor Eddie Benton 
and all the members of Rosemont Baptist 
Church in Lexington on their 75th anniversary 
and wish them many more years of successful 
ministry, serving God and reaching out to the 
community. 
HONORING RHETT ROBINSON 
HON. RICK W. ALLEN 
OF GEORGIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, June 7, 2022 
Mr. ALLEN. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
congratulate my constituent, Rhett Robinson, 
upon his acceptance to the United States Mer-
chant Marine Academy. 
As a future midshipman, he will be joining 
the ranks of the world’s most elite naval force, 
guided by the motto: ‘‘Acta Non Verba.’’ 
The service and sacrifice of America’s mili-
tary personnel have safeguarded our nation 
since its inception, defending our way of life 
from Lexington to Normandy. 
A vital part of our Nation’s maritime oper-
ations, the Merchant Marine’s duties are dy-
namic—transporting cargo and passengers 
during peacetime and serving as an auxiliary 
to the United States Navy during times of war. 
I was glad to sponsor Rhett’s nomination, as 
his dynamism reflects the mission of the 
branch which he will soon serve. I am con-
fident that his talents will distinguish him 
among his peers during his time at the Acad-
emy and thereafter. 
I congratulate Rhett, and know that he will 
make this Nation proud.

IN RECOGNITION OF HELEN 
HILTON RAISER 
HON. JACKIE SPEIER 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, June 7, 2022 
Ms. SPEIER. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to recognize a remarkable philanthropist and 
community 
leader, 
Helen 
Hilton 
Raiser. 
Through sheer will and determination she 
helped restore a wasteland into a major new 
public attraction in the City by the Bay: Fran-
cisco Park, a new 4.5 acre jewel at the corner 
of Hyde and Francisco Streets. Helen contrib-
uted in countless ways by fundraising, assist-
ing in design and promoting her vision for this 
new park during its development. 
In addition to Helen, credit goes to hundreds 
of neighbors and the leadership of the Fran-
cisco Park Conservancy, including board 
president Leslie Alspach and all of the original 
and successor board members. $27.5 million 
was raised by these leaders and Helen as 
they sought to tum a long-neglected area into 
a new destination in San Francisco. 
For 80 years this site was a deserted res-
ervoir hosting poison oak, raccoons, and an 
occasional coyote, but otherwise inhospitable 
to visitors. The reservoir was San Francisco’s 
first, built in 1860 and it was crucial during the 
1906 earthquake and fire. However, it was 
abandoned in 1940 after a newer facility was 
built a short distance away. This old reservoir 
remained an eyesore for decades, only to 
begin its renaissance after neighbors orga-
nized in 2011, and after the San Francisco 
Recreation and Parks department assumed 
formal responsibility for the location in 2014. 
What makes Francisco Park so special is 
that numerous community meetings over 
many years led to a special place that will 
serve both residents and likely hundreds of 
thousands of visitors, annually. The park is ad-
jacent to the Hyde Street cable car and visi-
tors from around the globe will probably dis-
embark and enjoy the inspirational views from 
this place of urban greenery. There is also a 
children’s playground, a fenced dog run with 
artificial turf, and a community garden. A 
‘‘heart of San Francisco’’ sculpture is on dis-
play, donated by Helen Hilton Raiser. It was 
created by the artist Laura Lineback. Early 
settlers and the harbor of what was then 
known as Yerba Buena were located nearby, 
so history is at the fingertips of visitors. Inter-
pretive signage offers visitors important histor-
ical facts about the site, educational lessons 
about water conservation, a description of 
views from the location, and other features 
that make the park as much a classroom as 
it is recreational open space. 
While I rise to highlight this park, Ms. Raiser 
and her neighbors, I also note Helen’s long 
history of philanthropy and activism. She is 
well known as a leader at the San Francisco 
Museum of Modern Art and as a major bene-
factor, over decades, of community groups 
from the peninsula through San Francisco. 
It was my good fortune to meet her decades 
ago as she led her campaign against hand-
guns and gun violence. She personally led a 
1982 effort on the California ballot to sharply 
reduce the number of handguns in California, 
and was a board member of Handgun Control, 
Inc. We became personal friends after that ef-
fort. Locally, she was a major volunteer with 
the Girl Scouts of America, the Volunteer Cen-
ter of San Mateo County, at Mills-Peninsula 
Hospital, numerous school associations and 
she served on the Board of Directors of the 
Junior Statesman Foundation as well as the 
Family Service Agency of San Mateo County. 
She has been a major advocate for affordable 
housing through the nonprofit Human Invest-
ment Project. In recognition of her outstanding 
leadership, Helen Hilton Raiser was inducted 
into the San Mateo County Women’s Hall of 
Fame in 1987. 
Madam Speaker and members, we have 
known great adversity in these past years as 
a scourge of nature visited our streets and our 
homes. We watched as nations yielded to the 
pressure of the pestilence, and as national 
and personal economies crumbled under the 
weight of our times. At moments such as 
these, it is important to remember that the 
makers of history are not always those whose 
names are in the headlines. They are often 
neighborhood activists, intent upon improving 
our country one park, one block or one school 
at a time. Throughout her life, whether via art 
or philanthropy, in schools or hospitals, in the 
halls of Congress or the state capitol, Helen 
Hilton Raiser is one of those makers of his-
tory. Let me express my gratitude for her 
friendship and leadership. There is nothing 
truer to our purpose as a nation than civic vir-
tue, and Helen Hilton Raiser is its embodi-
ment.

between India, the world’s largest democracy, 
and the United States, the world’s oldest de-
mocracy, has demonstrated our shared values 
for Rule of Law. 
I grew up with an appreciation of the people 
of India, because my father, First Lieutenant 
Hugh Wilson, served there in the U.S. Army 
Air Corps Flying Tigers in 1944, where he rec-
ognized the industriousness of the citizens of 
India. 
I am particularly grateful for the prosperous 
Indian-American community in South Carolina 
and look forward to its continued growth and 
achievements. In 2014 in New York at Madi-
son Square Garden, I helped welcome Prime 
Minister Narendra Modi, in 2016 in Wash-
ington, I was on the Escort Committee for the 
Prime Minister’s address to Congress, in 2019 
in New Delhi at the Red Fort, I attended In-
dian Independence Day, and in 2019 at the 
Howdy Modi program in Houston at the Astro-
dome, I joined President Donald Trump to rec-
ognize the Prime Minister. 
South Carolina’s first female governor in 
340 years was appropriately Nikki Randhawa 
Haley, who served with distinction. The Indian 
American community, of all immigrant groups 
in the United States, has achieved the highest 
per capita income level. 
I appreciate the visits with India’s Consul 
General Dr. Swati V. Kulkarni of Atlanta and 
Mr. KV Kumar, President and CEO of the In-
dian American International Chamber of Com-
merce to discuss the bilateral relationship be-
tween India and the United States. Bilateral 
trade in goods between the two countries 
crossed the $100 billion mark in 2021, making 
it the largest volume of goods trade in a cal-
endar year in India-U.S. economic history. 
This also represents an almost 45 percent 
jump from 2020, which is the single biggest 
jump of all the U.S. trade partners. Working 
together, Indian industry can build dynamic 
military manufacturing to be independent of 
foreign suppliers. 
The talks with Consul General also covered 
conversation on mass murder by war criminal 
Putin in Ukraine, its implications, and current 
regional developments. 
To take U.S. and India ties forward and to 
realize the full spirit of our strategic partner-
ship, USA and the Republic of India need to 
cooperate more closely in the Indo-Pacific. 
Certainly, there are issues of mutual concern 
with regard to China’s malign goals in the re-
gion, and the partnership to counter these au-
thoritarian aspirations should be robust. 
Throughout her service as India’s Consul 
General, Dr. Kulkarni has been an exemplary 
representative of the Republic of India. She 
was proactive across the southeast promoting 
the shared values of India and America. She 
will be greatly missed upon her departure from 
her post, as she continues her productive 
service for the people of India. 
In the current contest of democracy with 
Rule of Law opposed by authoritarians with 
Rule of Gun, it is more important for coopera-
tion to establish peace through strength. 
STANDING WITH THE PEOPLE OF 
BANGLADESH 
HON. JAMIE RASKIN 
OF MARYLAND 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, June 7, 2022 
Mr. RASKIN. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
in solidarity with the people of Bangladesh. I 
want to voice my support for human rights de-
fenders, members of minority groups, and civil 
society in Bangladesh at this moment when 
the Bangladeshi government is persisting in 
threatening the basic human rights and civil 
liberties of its people. The Bangladeshi gov-
ernment, led by Sheikh Hasina of the Awami 
League, has earned widespread criticism for 
its deteriorating human rights record, and for 
its failure to protect the most vulnerable peo-
ple living in Bangladesh-indigenous people, 
women, religious minorities, activists, and refu-
gees. 
Amnesty International tracks human rights 
abuses in Bangladesh and has noted their ac-
celeration during the pandemic. Under the dra-
conian 
Digital 
Security 
Act 
of 
2018, 
Bangladeshi journalists and other human 
rights defenders are routinely persecuted for 
reporting on corruption or criticizing any of the 
government’s policies. COVID–19 policies 
against public gatherings have been used to 
prevent political meetings, and to quell public 
protests against the government. Violence 
against women and indigenous activists has 
also intensified during the pandemic. 
The Bangladeshi government employs a 
joint task force composed of members of po-
lice, military, and border guards called the 
Rapid Action Battalion, and it has consistently 
failed to address the excesses of these and 
other security forces. The Rapid Action Bat-
talion and other Bangladeshi law enforcement 
entities are alleged to be responsible for more 
than 600 disappearances since 2009 and 
nearly 600 extrajudicial killings since 2018. 
These incidents reportedly target opposition 
party members, journalists, and human rights 
activists. 
Last August, the Tom Lantos Human Rights 
Commission, of which I am a member, hosted 
a briefing on the deeply disturbing uptick in 
enforced disappearances in Bangladesh. Rep-
resentatives from Human Rights Watch and 
the Asian Human Rights Commission partici-
pated, as did Bangladeshi photojournalist and 
activist Shahidul Alam who had been unlaw-
fully arrested after posting criticism of the 
Bangladeshi Government on Facebook, and 
the sister of disappeared opposition leader 
Sajedul Islam Sumon. These violent and ille-
gal forced disappearances have chilling effects 
on free speech, political opposition, and civil 
society. 
On International Human Rights Day last 
year, the U.S. Department of the Treasury an-
nounced sanctions on the Rapid Action Bat-
talion, citing how their actions undermine the 
rule of law and respect for human rights and 
fundamental freedoms. The United Nations re-
ported that since the sanctions against the 
Rapid Action Battalion officials were an-
nounced in December, the Bangladeshi gov-
ernment has responded by launching a retalia-
tory campaign of intimidation and harassment. 
The homes of at least 10 relatives of people 
forcibly disappeared are reported to have 
been raided at night, and some relatives were 
forced to sign statements saying that their 
loved ones had not in fact been forcibly dis-
appeared, 
Today, I ask my colleagues to join me in 
standing with the people of Bangladesh, espe-
cially those bravest and most vulnerable, and 
urging the Bangladeshi government to take 
immediate action to respect the civil rights and 
safety of all the people of Bangladesh.

IN RECOGNITION OF ROBERT 
HUNGERSCHAFER 
HON. RICK LARSEN 
OF WASHINGTON 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, June 7, 2022 
Mr. LARSEN of Washington. Madam Speak-
er, I rise to honor Robert A. Hungerschafer 
from Bellingham, Washington. 
Robert is a dedicated volunteer who has 
served his community with selflessness and 
compassion by donating blood, plasma and 
platelets. 
His contributions are staggering. 
Robert has made 1,100 voluntary donations, 
potentially saving more than 7,900 lives. 
He has donated more than 300 gallons of 
blood, plasma and platelets and traveled over 
74,000 miles to help save lives. 
But Robert is more than a donor. 
He also volunteers by documenting the lives 
of Washington state servicemembers who lost 
their lives in World War I. 
Robert’s donations help save the lives of 
people he will never meet. This selflessness is 
essential to building stronger communities and 
is a reminder that everyone can play a part in 
improving the lives of their neighbors. 
It is my honor to recognize Robert A. 
Hungerschafer for his service to his commu-
nity, Washington state and the United States.

Mr. CARBAJAL. Madam Speaker, each

my office extends special recognition to 
women on the Central Coast who have made 
a difference in our community. I would like to 
recognize one outstanding Women of the Year 
Award recipient, Barbara Levenson, of Pismo 
Beach, California. 
After 
27 
years 
as 
a 
pharmacist 
at 
Atascadero State Hospital, Barbara Levenson 
retired to focus on community service. But 
even before retirement, Barbara was recog-
nized by the Tribune as an Unsung Hero for 
her dedication to serving humane causes. This 
is illustrated by her work with the Wellness 
Kitchen in Atascadero, where food was pre-
pared for residents with special dietary needs 
due to health conditions. She was also a 
member of the Flying Samaritans, a team of 
medical professionals that flies to different 
areas of the world to provide free medical 
services to the needy.

June 7, 2022 
Post retirement, Barbara remains committed 
to providing support and care to those who 
need it most and gives her time and energy to 
a range of organizations nurturing a healthy, 
welcoming community. She is a member of 
the San Luis Obispo NAACP, for which she 
has served as secretary, and is also a mem-
ber of the SLO County Diversity Coalition. 
Barbara served as a Long-Term Care Om-
budsman in San Luis Obispo County for eight 
years, assisting residents of long-term care fa-
cilities and their families to resolve problems 
related to the health, safety, welfare, and 
rights of those in Long Term Care facilities. 
She is now the chair of the San Luis Obispo 
County Behavioral Health Board that evalu-
ates the community’s behavioral health needs, 
services, and facilities and advises the Board 
of Supervisors and the Behavioral Health Ad-
ministrator. 
As a volunteer, Barbara serves organiza-
tions that encourage growth and opportunity. 
For the San Luis Obispo Community Founda-
tion, she reviews scholarship applications and 
even created an endowment in the name of 
her brother, John Renner, supporting students 
who identify at LGBTQ+. Barbara is also a 
member of the Central Coast Circle of Friend-
ship Bridge which provides microfinance, edu-
cation, and health services to build opportuni-
ties. In alignment with United Nations Millen-
nium Development goals, the Central Coast 
Circle empowers Guatemalan women to build 
a better future. Lastly, Barbara is an avid 
reader and South County book club member, 
who volunteers with the Arroyo Grande Li-
brary, organizing donated books for the annual 
book sale. 
I am honored to recognize Barbara, one of 
our community’s ‘‘quiet heroes,’’ for her com-
mitment to improving the lives of so many. I 
ask all Members to join me today in honoring 
an exceptional woman of California’s 24th 
Congressional District, Barbara Levenson, for 
her incredible service to her community.

CELEBRATING THE 57TH 
ANNIVERSARY OF HEAD START 
HON. JERRY McNERNEY 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, June 7, 2022 
Mr. MCNERNEY. Madam Speaker, I ask my 
colleagues to join me in recognizing Head 
Start, a crucial program that celebrated its 
57th anniversary this year. 
Since 1965, Head Start has promoted 
school readiness for children in economically 
disadvantaged families by offering educational, 
nutritional, health, and social services. Head 
Start has served more than 39 million children 
and their families in urban and rural areas in 
all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto 
Rico and the U.S. territories, including Amer-
ican Indian, Alaska Native, migrant and sea-
sonal communities. 
Head Start works with and for the commu-
nities they serve to improve the lives of chil-
dren from birth. Growing from an eight-week 
demonstration project, Head Start now in-
cludes full-day and year-round services, which 
more than one million children and their fami-
lies benefit from each year. A key tenet of the 
program is that it be culturally responsive to 
the communities it serves, and that the com-
munities have an investment in its success. 
The early education services and essential 
support offered by Head Start provides chil-
dren the tools they need for future success. I 
ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing 
Head Start and its staff for their invaluable 
contributions over the past 57 years to build-
ing opportunities so that every child can thrive.

RECOGNIZING THE SERVICE OF 
FRANK SMITH 
HON. ADRIAN SMITH 
OF NEBRASKA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, June 7, 2022 
Mr. SMITH of Nebraska. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to celebrate and honor the service 
of a great Nebraskan, Mr. Frank Smith who 
recently celebrated his 100th birthday. Mr. 
Smith (no relation) was recently recognized by 
the Gage County Board of Supervisors for his 
service to Nebraskans and our country. I am 
honored to have the opportunity to join my fel-
low Nebraskans in thanking Mr. Smith for his 
service. 
On May 5th, he turned 100. A member of 
the Greatest Generation, he was born in 
Omaha and raised in Beatrice. He studied ag-
riculture at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, 
and he enlisted in the Army on June 10, 1942. 
He served during World War II and was 
awarded the World War II campaign medal 
with three Bronze Stars and the Good Con-
duct medal. He was honorably discharged as 
a corporal. Corporal Frank Smith, USA, Re-
tired, enlisted because he loves our great 
country, and his volunteerism has continued in 
the years following his military service. 
Upon returning from tours in Africa and Italy 
with a heavy weapons company, he went on 
to work in farming, then as a prison chaplain. 
When asked about his patriotic dedication, he 
said, ‘‘My government’s important to me, al-
though it’s not always so good as it should be, 
but it’s mine.’’ 
At 100 years old, he continues to volunteer 
with Blue Rivers Area Agency on Aging, deliv-
ering meals to fellow senior citizens every day. 
To put it simply, his life story is extraordinary. 
It would be easy for someone who has done 
and given as much as Frank to sit back and 
relax, but he continues serving others. 
I thank Mr. Smith for all his service and sac-
rifice.

CELEBRATING THE 50TH ANNIVER-
SARY OF THE MINNESOTA HU-
MANITIES CENTER 
HON. BETTY McCOLLUM 
OF MINNESOTA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, June 7, 2022 
Ms. MCCOLLUM. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today in recognition of the Minnesota Human-
ities Center as they celebrate their 50th anni-
versary of ‘‘sparking change’’ in our commu-
nities using the power of the humanities to ex-
plore, interpret, and engage. The Minnesota 
Humanities Center (MHC) is a collaborative 
non-profit working with individuals, organiza-
tions and communities to bring humanities 
programming to all Minnesotans, and is rooted 
in the belief that the humanities have the 
power to connect, bridge differences, interpret 
the complexities of the world and positively 
shape our future. 
Founded by the National Endowment for the 
Humanities in 1971, MHC was one of the very 
first humanities councils in the nation. In their 
first few decades they focused on a range of 
education initiatives that explored Minnesota’s 
people and their history, and used televised or 
in-person programs to enhance the way that 
educators taught about these subjects in their 
classrooms. As MHC continued to grow they 
expanded by creating traveling exhibits and 
public events, bringing in international speak-
ers and publishing books. Their burgeoning 
programming in the 1990s eventually led to 
the opening of their full-service event center in 
the former wing of Gillette Children’s Hospital 
in Saint Paul in 1996. This center on the east 
side of Saint Paul is still the home of the Min-
nesota Humanities Center today, and houses 
a full-service meeting and event center, 15 ad-
ministrative offices and 15 overnight guest 
rooms. 
As MHC moved into the 21st century, their 
programming continued to expand and shift to 
serve the needs of Minnesotans. They began 
to focus on providing culturally responsive and 
linguistically relevant literacy initiatives in 
White and Green Hmong, Somali, Dakota and 
Ojibwe, and they broadened partnerships with 
school districts while engaging new audiences 
in a deeper understanding of history, culture 
and identity. One example of this program-
ming is a documentary they co-produced with 
Twin Cities Public Television called ‘‘Iron 
Range: Minnesota Building America’’ that 
highlights the history and future of the Iron 
Range in northern Minnesota and won an 
Emmy Award for Best Cultural Documentary in 
2009. Another example of their important work 
is their Veteran’s Voices program which began 
in 2013 and honors Minnesota Veterans by 
celebrating their written and spoken stories 
about their experiences serving their country. 
Grant-making is also central to the work of 
MHC. For 50 years they have worked hard to 
champion the work of individuals, nonprofits, 
schools and other collectives across Min-
nesota through their own competitive grants 
and by administering grant funds appropriated 
by the Minnesota Legislature. In the last year, 
MHC distributed over $4.7 million through 180 
grants across Minnesota, and through the 
CARES Act were awarded an additional 
$538,500 to support COVID–19 relief efforts. I 
was proud to vote in favor of those funds, and 
I continue to support funding for the National 
Endowment for the Humanities through my 
role as Vice-Chair of the Interior-Environment 
Appropriations Subcommittee. 
Led today by CEO Kevin Lindsey, MHC 
continues to be a beacon for learning and 
positive change in Minnesota, seeking to fulfill 
their vision of a just society that is connected, 
curious, and compassionate as they look to 
their next 50 years of service to the commu-
nity. Madam Speaker, please join me in recog-
nizing the Minnesota Humanities Center and 
their excellent humanities programming as 
they celebrate their 50th anniversary.

TRIBUTE 
TO 
SIGRID 
WRIGHT— 
CALIFORNIA’S 
24TH 
CONGRES-
SIONAL WOMAN OF THE YEAR 
HON. SALUD O. CARBAJAL 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, June 7, 2022 
Mr. CARBAJAL. Madam Speaker, each 
year, through the Women of the Year Award, 
my office extends special recognition to 
women on the Central Coast who have made 
a difference in our community. I would like to 
recognize one outstanding Women of the Year 
Award recipient, Sigrid Wright of Santa Bar-
bara, California. 
A longtime resident of Santa Barbara, Sigrid 
Wright has been a leader in environmental 
non-profits and climate change advocacy on 
the Central Coast for more than 25 years. 
With the many daunting challenges of the 
growing climate crisis, her leadership has 
guided the community in facing those chal-
lenges. 
Sigrid was named as CEO/executive direc-
tor of the Community Environmental Council 
(CEC) in 2015, becoming the first woman to 
lead the 45-year-old non-profit. Driven by the 
environmental destruction seen along Santa 
Barbara’s coastline due to the 1969 oil spill, 
Sigrid has championed CEC’s mission to 
move the Santa Barbara region away from de-
pendence on fossil fuels in one generation— 
Fossil Free by ’33. As CEO, Sigrid has spear-
headed CEC’s climate goals by educating and 
activating 
the 
Santa 
Barbara 
community 
around sustainable practices, advocating for 
environmentally sound policies and laws, and 
building partnerships with other organizations 
to open new pathways for sustainable trans-
portation, energy, and food systems. 
In her longstanding commitment to resolving 
the climate crisis, Sigrid co-founded the Cen-
tral Coast Climate Justice Network as well as 
the Central Coast Climate Collaborative, de-
voted to advancing social, economic, and en-
vironmental justice. Sigrid’s efforts to effect 
real change in climate advocacy have already 
been recognized by her community. In 2020, 
California Assemblymember Monique Limo´n 
named CEC Non-Profit of the Year. Commu-
nity initiatives sparked by Sigrid and CEC 
have included Santa Barbara’s first ever wind 
farm which is expected to power 53,000 family 
homes with clean, sustainable electricity. 
Where Sigrid sees a need, she takes action 
to fill it. She strategizes and addresses each 
of the root causes of climate change in her 
role as leader of CEC. Her influence over 
Santa Barbara’s local food justice movement 
has led to produce and prepared food being 
redirected to impoverished peoples and fami-
lies in need rather than end up at a landfill. 
Sigrid’s quest to reduce consumption and 
waste has helped expand the Rethink the 
Drink program, providing access to thousands 
of hydration stations across Santa Barbara 
County and environmental education for par-
ticipating schools. She gives so much of her 
time, energy, and resources to serve our com-
munity. She is a worthy candidate for this 
honor and a role model for community leaders 
of all kinds. 
I am honored to recognize Sigrid for her 
continued commitment to environmental and 
climate change advocacy on the Central 
Coast. I ask all Members to join me today in 
honoring an exceptional woman of California’s 
24th Congressional District, Sigrid Wright, for

HONORING MATALIE MILES 
HON. RICK W. ALLEN 
OF GEORGIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, June 7, 2022 
Mr. ALLEN. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
congratulate my constituent, Matalie Miles, 
upon her acceptance to the United States Mili-
tary Academy at West Point. 
As a future cadet, she will be joining the 
ranks of the world’s most fearsome fighting 
force—the United States Army—guided by 
duty, honor, and country. 
The service and sacrifice of America’s mili-
tary personnel have safeguarded our Nation 
since its inception, defending our way of life 
from Lexington to Normandy. 
And throughout our history, American sol-
diers have demonstrated tremendous courage 
and strength, beating back tyranny to the ends 
of the earth. 
I was glad to sponsor Matalie’s nomination 
and I am confident that her talents will distin-
guish her among her peers both during her 
time at West Point and thereafter. 
I congratulate Matalie, and know that she 
will make this Nation proud.

IN RECOGNITION OF DR. CURTIS L. 
JONES, JR. 
HON. SANFORD D. BISHOP, JR. 
OF GEORGIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, June 7, 2022 
Mr. BISHOP of Georgia. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to honor, commend, and extend my 
congratulations to a gifted educator, dedicated 
community leader, and great team builder, Dr. 
Curtis L. Jones, Jr. Dr. Jones retired from his 
role as Superintendent of the Bibb County, 
Georgia School District, and a retirement cele-
bration was held on Friday, May 27, 2022, at 
The Macon Coliseum located at 200 Coliseum 
Drive in Macon, Georgia. 
Born to the union of Reverend Curtis L. 
Jones and Mrs. Roberta Prescott Jones, Dr. 
Jones earned his bachelor’s degree at the 
United States Military Academy at West Point 
and went on to complete a distinguished mili-
tary career in the U.S. Army, retiring as a 
Lieutenant Colonel. He earned a Master of 
Business Administration from Albany State 
University in Albany, Georgia, an Education 
Specialist Degree from Lincoln Memorial Uni-
versity, and a doctorate in Educational Leader-
ship from Nova Southeastern University. 
For nearly two decades, Dr. Jones has been 
an effective and trusted leader in multiple 
roles in public education administration in the 
state of Georgia. He established an impres-
sive career beginning as a JROTC instructor 
with the Griffin-Spalding County School Sys-
tem in Griffin, Georgia, moving to the positions 
of High School Principal, Assistant Super-
intendent, and thereafter, Superintendent of 
Schools. 
On April 6, 2015, he became Super-
intendent of the Bibb County School District in 
Macon, Georgia, and worked tirelessly with 
teachers, administrators, and other support 
staff to transform the students of Bibb County 
into scholars, leaders, and good citizens. 
While leading the Bibb County School District, 
Dr. Jones has worked to enhance literacy and 
classroom learning through the development 
of a District Literacy Plan, which led to student 
growth on the Georgia Milestones Assess-
ments. He led two voter-approved Education 
Special Purpose Local Option Sales Tax 
(ESPLOST) campaigns, which funded the 
opening of six new school buildings and 
countless school renovation projects. His com-
mitment to equity motivated him to secure 
major technology improvements assuring that 
every child has equal access to high-quality 
technology resources. During his tenure as 
Superintendent, the Bibb County School Dis-
trict has made great gains in improving its 
graduation rate from 58.9 percent in 2014 to 
80.67 percent in 2021. 
Under his exceptional leadership, the Dis-
trict has received Georgia’s College Board 
Linking Award for having more than 80 per-
cent of juniors and seniors utilizing Khan 
Academy for SAT preparation (2017); the Dig-
ital School District Survey Award for Large 
Student Population Districts category, and 
along with its Board of Education has been 
named both a Distinguished and Exemplary 
Board by the Georgia School Boards Associa-
tion (2018). Bibb County was featured in The 
District Management Journal, in an article ti-
tled ‘‘Raising Achievement and Addressing 
Equity at Bibb County Schools’’ and as a case 
study with K–12 Insight for its work in improv-
ing stakeholder communications through its 
use of the Let’s Talk! platform. In addition to 
these achievements, seven schools have 
achieved Leader in Me Lighthouse School sta-
tus (2022), and the District has achieved ac-
creditation from AdvancED, (now Cognia), with 
two schools—Skyview and Carter Elementary 
Schools, being recognized as National Ele-
mentary and Secondary Education Act Title I 
Schools of Distinction. 
Dr. Jones’ leadership has made a tremen-
dous impact on the many educators and ad-
ministrators in the District, as numerous lead-
ers and staff members have been recognized 
at the state and national levels, and have 
been invited to serve as leading panelists and 
make presentations on how Bibb has dem-
onstrated success. 
Winston Churchill once said: ‘‘You make 
your living by what you get, you make your life 
by what you give.’’ Dr. Curtis L. Jones, Jr. has 
given so much to the Bibb County School Dis-
trict, its educators, its administrators, and most 
importantly, its students. He has cast a wide 
net in his service as an educator, and Bibb 
County, our state, and our nation are better 
because of his work. 
In addition to his work for the Bibb County 
School District, Dr. Jones is engaged in nu-
merous professional and community organiza-
tions including the Rotary Club of Macon and 
the Kiwanis Club of Macon. He serves on sev-
eral community boards including those for the 
Greater Macon Chamber of Commerce and 
the United Way of Central Georgia. He is a 
past governing board member for The School 
Superintendents Association (AASA) and past 
president of the Georgia School Superintend-
ents Association (GSSA). 
For his work in educational leadership and 
administration, Dr. Jones has received several

2019 National Superintendent of the Year by 
The 
School 
Superintendents 
Association 
(AASA) and the 2019 National Superintendent 
of the Year at AASA’s National Conference on 
Education. 
Dr. Jones has accomplished much in his 
life, but none of this would have been possible 
without the Grace of God and the love and 
support of his wife, Evelyn, their three chil-
dren, and grandchildren. Their support has, no 
doubt, been the wind beneath his wings. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues in the 
House of Representatives to join my wife, Viv-
ian, and me along with the more than 730,000 
people of the Second Congressional District, 
in honoring, commending, and extending our 
sincerest appreciation and best wishes to Dr. 
Curtis L. Jones, Jr. upon the occasion of his 
retirement from an outstanding career in Ele-
mentary and Secondary Education Administra-
tion and his continued service to humanity.

RECOGNIZING KATERINA 
NAFPLIOTI PANAGOPOULOS 
HON. CAROLYN B. MALONEY 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, June 7, 2022 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New York. 
Madam Speaker, I rise to pay tribute to 
Katerina Nafplioti Panagopoulos for her out-
standing 
career 
and 
accomplishments. 
Through her many endeavors and initiatives, 
Ms. Panagopoulos has shown unwavering 
dedication to the Greek community. 
Ms. Panagopoulos was born in Athens, 
Greece and studied at both the Evangelical 
School of Nea Smyrni and the Foreign Lit-
erature Department of the Paul Valery Univer-
sity, in Montpellier, France. She holds an hon-
orary Doctor of Philosophy from Amity Univer-
sity. Ms. Panagopoulos founded the success-
ful business Studio Alta Moda in Athens and 
has since made great accomplishments in the 
sectors of tourism and commerce. 
Outside of her work as an accomplished 
businesswoman, 
Ms. 
Panagopoulos 
has 
served the world of sports extensively. Since 
1998, she has acted as the National Ambas-
sador of Greece in the Council of Europe for 
Sports, Tolerance and Fair Play and has pre-
sided as president of the Panhellenic Wom-
en’s Sports Association ‘‘KALLIPATIRA’’ since 
2005. In 2013, Ms. Panagopoulos signed the 
Memorandum of Cooperation with the Asso-
ciation of Greek Olympians (SEO) and the 
Hellenic Paralympic Committee as the Presi-
dent of KALLIPATIRA. Since that time, her 
work has involved supporting Olympic and 
Paralympic Champions and Winners, the con-
struction of more than 25 athletic venues 
throughout Greece, and providing athletic and 
medical equipment as well as financial support 
to athletic associations. The International 
Olympic 
Committee 
honored 
Ms. 
Panagopoulos in 2012, when she became the 
first Greek recipient of the Woman and Sports 
Award. 
Ms. Panagopoulos has served as Ambas-
sador of the Greek State regarding matters of 
promotion of the international role of Greece 
globally, the creation of new investments and 
the Hellenic Diaspora since 2019. She is the 
Special Advisor to the Prime Minister of 
Greece for Hellenic Diaspora since 2018, and 
President of the International Center for 
Science and Hellenic Values. 
In collaboration with the Hellenic Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs, Ms. Panagopoulos founded an 
initiative to organize a series of lectures in the 
most important centers of the Greek Diaspora 
in the United States. She frequently partici-
pates in conferences and working groups, and 
lectures in schools and foundations nation-
wide. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me 
in 
recognizing 
Katerina 
Nafplioti 
Panagopoulos for her outstanding accomplish-
ments and commitment to representing Hel-
lenic culture in the United States and around 
the world.

CELEBRATING THE 25TH ANNIVER-
SARY OF PRIME TIMERS OF THE 
NATIONAL CAPITAL AREA 
HON. ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON 
OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, June 7, 2022 
Ms. NORTON. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to ask the House of Representatives to join 
me in celebrating the 25th anniversary of 
Prime Timers of the National Capital Area. 
Prime Timers of the National Capital Area 
was founded on December 17, 1996, as a 
chapter of Prime Timers Worldwide, an inter-
national non-profit organization that celebrates 
all human diversity and whose vision is to 
‘‘Bring together mature gay and bisexual men 
for friendship, social activities, support and 
personal growth.’’ 
The mission of Prime Timers of the National 
Capital Area is to provide opportunities for 
older gay and bisexual men to come together 
in a safe and supportive environment regard-
less of race, nationality, sexual orientation, 
physical ability, ethnicity, religion or political af-
filiation. The chapter promotes healthy aging 
through supportive relationships and personal 
enrichment through service to others. 
Madam Speaker, again, I ask the House of 
Representatives to join me in honoring Prime 
Timers of the National Capital Area for its 25 
years of dedicated service, which has ad-
vanced the welfare not only of the LGBTQ 
community in the District of Columbia, but of 
the entire population of the District of Colum-
bia.

RECOGNIZING THE 140TH ANNIVER-
SARY 
OF 
SLEDER’S 
FAMILY 
TAVERN 
HON. JACK BERGMAN 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, June 7, 2022 
Mr. BERGMAN. Madam Speaker, it is my 
honor to recognize the 140th Anniversary of 
Sleder’s Family Tavern of Traverse City, 
Michigan. Through almost a century and a half 
of service and steadfast devotion to their com-
munity, Sleder’s Family Tavern has become a 
local landmark and an indispensable part of 
Michigan’s First District. 
Established in 1882, Sleder’s Family Tav-
ern’s continuous dedication to the local com-
munity has landed the business the title of the 
oldest active restaurant in Michigan. The tav-
ern was started by local wheelwright, Vencil 
Sleder, who came to the United States as a 
Bohemian immigrant and built the tavern with 
the help of his fellow neighbors. The original 
construction of the tavern was made up of 
wooden slabs from sawmills and took approxi-
mately three years to build since many of the 
builders were only available on weekends. 
Sleder’s Family Tavern was owned and op-
erated by the Sleder family for three genera-
tions, until it was sold to Bob and Sylvia 
Classens around the business’s 100th anni-
versary in 1975. The Tavern was then sold to 
Deb and Brian Cairns in May 1992, who even-
tually transferred ownership to their son and 
daughter-in-law, Ryan and Megan Cox, on De-
cember 31, 2019. Throughout the years, the 
business has only had minor renovations and 
additions, and much of the original building 
has been preserved with the help of the com-
munity. Today, the Sleder’s Family Tavern is 
located in the heart of downtown Traverse 
City, and continues to serve locals for their 
food and beverage needs. 
Madam Speaker, it’s my honor to recognize 
Sleder’s Family Tavern for nearly a century 
and a half of success and service to Northern 
Michigan. Michiganders can take great pride in 
knowing the First District is home to such 
dedicated citizens. On behalf of my constitu-
ents, I wish them all the best in their future en-
deavors.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks
E585 
June 7, 2022 
Joseph M. Martin to the United States Army 
and the American people. 
General Joseph M. Martin has served our 
nation honorably for over thirty-five years. A 
native of Dearborn, Michigan, General Martin 
graduated from the United States Military 
Academy in 1986 and commissioned as an 
Armor officer. General Martin successfully led 
and commanded soldiers during peacetime 
and combat at all levels of leadership includ-
ing platoon, company, battalion, brigade, and 
division. 
General Martin’s record of exemplary com-
bat leadership includes Bravo Company, 4th 
Battalion, 37th Armor Regiment, 1st Infantry 
Division during Operation Desert Storm, 1st 
Battalion, 67th Armor Regiment, 4th Infantry 
Division during Operation Iraqi Freedom, 2nd 
Brigade, 1st Infantry Division in Northwest 
Baghdad, Iraq, and the 1st Infantry Division in 
Operation Inherent Resolve. General Martin 
also commanded the Combined Joint Forces 
Land Component Command during the Battle 
of Mosul, leading a multi-national force re-
taking the city from Islamic State militants over 
a seven-month long fight. In total, General 
Martin has led soldiers on a total of five com-
bat deployments to Iraq across different con-
flicts and considers himself to always be a 
‘‘Big Red One’’ soldier from his many years in 
America’s 1st Division. 
General Martin is not just an exceptional 
combat leader, but has also dedicated years 
to developing soldiers and the Army’s future 
leaders. Serving first as an observer controller 
and later as the commanding general of the 
National Training Center in Fort Irwin, Cali-
fornia, General Martin trained and certified 
Army units in a highly realistic combat training 
environment that replicated the type of battle-
field seen by U.S. soldiers over the last thirty 
years. He has also served as an instructor at 
the U.S. Armor Center, training officers and 
developing policy and procedures to increase 
warfighting proficiency. As the Army’s Vice 
Chief of Staff, General Martin has focused on 
the Army’s modernization efforts, building ca-
pabilities for future conflicts during a critical 
time for our national security. 
General Martin and his family have also 
served their communities throughout his distin-
guished career. He was recognized by the 
University of Louisville, where he earned a 
Master of Education in Occupational Training 
and Development in 1997, as their Alumnus of 
the Year for 2021. 
General Martin’s lifetime of service and 
leadership to his fellow soldiers is commend-
able, speaking not only to his patriotism, but 
also to his selfless character. The Army is 
more prepared to face the strategic threats to 
our national security today because of his dec-
ades of dedication to the mission. The Amer-
ican people owe him a debt of gratitude.

HONORING GEORGE WASHINGTON 
GARRETT 
HON. ANDY BARR 
OF KENTUCKY 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, June 7, 2022 
Mr. BARR. Madam Speaker, I rise to honor 
the life of a patriotic American, George Wash-
ington Garrett, as he approaches his 100th 
birthday. Mr. Garrett lives in Montgomery 
County, Kentucky. 
Mr. Garrett was born on June 7, 1922, in 
Mt. Sterling, KY. He was inducted into the 
United States Army on January 29, 1943. Mr. 
Garrett served in Normandy, Northern France, 
Ardennes, Rhineland, and Central Europe as 
part of the 989th Quartermaster Service Co. 
For his brave service to our nation, Mr. Garrett 
was awarded the World War II Victory Medal 
and the European African Middle Eastern 
Service Ribbon with five Bronze Stars. Fol-
lowing the war’s end, he was honorably dis-
charged on November 19, 1945. 
On Veterans Day in 2020, Mr. Garrett was 
presented with a Quilt of Valor Award from the 
Quilts of Valor Foundation in appreciation of 
his service. 
It is my honor to recognize Mr. Garrett, cele-
brate his 100th birthday and thank him for his 
service and sacrifice to our nation during 
World War II. As a part of ‘‘The Greatest Gen-
eration’’, Mr. Garrett and his fellow soldiers 
fought to preserve the freedoms that we enjoy 
today, and we can never thank them enough. 
I am forever grateful for Americans like 
George Washington Garrett.

CELEBRATING LEON VALDRY ON 
HIS 90TH BIRTHDAY 
HON. TROY A. CARTER 
OF LOUISIANA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, June 7, 2022 
Mr. CARTER of Louisiana. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to recognize Mr. Leon E. Valdry, 
on his 90th birthday. 
Mr. Leon E. Valdry, a native of Bueche, 
Louisiana (a country community in Baton 
Rouge Louisiana), born June 7, 1932, cele-
brated his 90th birthday on Saturday June 4, 
2022. The function was held in Louisiana at 
the Valdry Center for Philanthropy located on 
the beautiful campus of Southern University. 
Mr. Valdry came from humble beginnings 
but has established himself as a real estate 
icon currently living in Beverly Hills, California. 
He is a philanthropist and the largest donor to 
his beloved alma mater Southern University in 
which he graduated 1957 in engineering. In 
2019, Southern University opened the doors to 
the Valdry Center School of Philanthropy an 
academically based research center focused 
on Philanthropies named after him and his 
brother. It is the only HBCU Philanthropy Cen-
ter in the country. 
Leon Valdry believes that consistent finan-
cial support from alumni is critical to Southern 
University’s growth and longevity. ‘‘As alumni, 
it is imperative that we give back to the Uni-
versity. Every graduate regardless of the 
amount they are able to give, should make a 
financial contribution annually,’’ said Valdry. 
On March 21, 2015, Leon Valdry made a un-
restricted gift of $100,000 to the Southern Uni-
versity System Foundation’s 1880 Society. 
Valdry is a long-time supporter of the South-
ern University College of Business and a 
member 
of 
the 
1880 
Society, 
P.B.S. 
Pinchback Circle. The P.B.S. Pinchback Circle 
requires an annual cash contribution of no 
less than $25,000 to the Society. He is still a 
member. 
Philanthropy for Valdry has been a way of 
life for more than 50 years. The training he re-
ceived while he was a student at Southern 
University, provided Valdry with an opportunity 
to secure his first job with the Litho Art Com-
pany in Los Angeles, California. Since that 
time, he has made a name for himself in real 
estate development throughout Louisiana and 
California. His real estate ventures consist of 
residential, commercial, and industrial prop-
erties. Valdry is a resident of Beverly Hills, 
California and is President/CEO of Holly Park 
Plaza in Inglewood, California, which is one of 
the largest shopping centers in the city of Los 
Angeles. 
The Valdry Center for Philanthropy at 
Southern Universiy acknowledges the sizable 
contributions that Leon, Warren, and Virginia 
Valdry have made to their alma mater, and the 
need to support excellence in education at 
HBCUs by endeavoring to create a culture of 
philanthropy, promote racial equity, and pro-
vide a trained workforce to help direct volun-
teer action and charitable resources toward 
communities in need. 
He is a member of the Democratic Party 
and has made contributions throughout the 
years. Mr. Valdry looks forward to attending 
any upcoming Democratic functions in Beverly 
Hills. He has blessed both communities in 
Louisiana and Beverly Hills by assisting young 
adults/students with their academic journey. 
He is a devout Catholic and is a member of 
the Usher Team at Good Shepherd Catholic 
Church in Beverly Hills California. He is also 
an Army Veteran. President Biden joined in 
the celebration, celebrating Mr. Valdry for his 
love, kindness, generosity, and time to human-
ity. 
A huge Congratulations and Birthday Wish-
es to Louisiana’s native Son.

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, June 7, 2022 
Mr. ALLEN. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
congratulate my constituent, Zeal Saballa, 
upon his acceptance to the United States Mer-
chant Marine Academy. 
As a future midshipman, he will be joining 
the ranks of the world’s most elite naval force,

The service and sacrifice of America’s mili-
tary personnel have safeguarded our Nation

from Lexington to Normandy. 
A vital part of our nation’s maritime oper-
ations, the Merchant Marine’s duties are dy-
namic—transporting cargo and passengers 
during peacetime and serving as an auxiliary 
to the United States Navy during times of war. 
I was glad to sponsor Zeal’s nomination, as 
his dynamism reflects the mission of the 
branch which he will soon serve. I am con-
fident that his talents will distinguish him 
among his peers during his time at the Acad-
emy and thereafter. 
I congratulate Zeal, and know that he will 
make this Nation proud.

IN RECOGNITION OF THE 
RETIREMENT OF SHEILA CANZIAN 
HON. JACKIE SPEIER 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, June 7, 2022 
Ms. SPEIER. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to recognize Sheila Canzian upon her retire-
ment after 52 years of public service to the 
people of San Mateo. Sheila is the marathon 
runner of parks and recreation directors, hav-
ing started as a summer playground leader 
and moved her way steadily upward over dec-
ades of service. 
She grew up in San Mateo and was hired 
in 1970. About 79,000 residents were served 
by the parks of San Mateo at the time. Today, 
San Mateo has nearly 104,000 residents and 
the recreational amenities of the city have 
grown to meet the needs of this increased 
population. She manages over 35 parks, six 
community centers, the Marina Lagoon, Poplar 
Creek Golf Course, and numerous other 
amenities that make San Mateo a youthful and 
fun place to live on the peninsula. Sheila was 
instrumental in the development of the city’s 
shoreline parks along the bayfront, the senior 
center, and the rebranding of Poplar Creek 
Golf Course. 
While all parks in San Mateo have their own 
character, the crown jewel is the site of the old 
Kohl Mansion, affectionately known as Central 
Park. During the year, families enjoy the win-
ter ice rink, modem and accessible playground 
equipment, and a stunning Japanese Garden 
that draws visitors from around the world. If 
you love Central Park, recognize that Sheila is 
the heart that allows Central Park to live. The 
rose garden and train are beloved and allow 
families to exercise together while enjoying 
amenities unusual in a city the size of San 
Mateo. The community recreation center has 
witnessed countless public events and is a 
gathering place for San Mateo’s seniors. In 
dogged pursuit of keeping Central Park in fine 
fiddle, and even when city finances were 
strained, Sheila did a remarkable job of man-
aging countless koi fish, hundreds of trees and 
numerous city managers. The koi and the 
trees were quick learners. 
If 52 years of professional service do not 
prove the point, in 2021 Sheila was voted into 
the American Academy of Parks and Recre-
ation Administration, a nationwide body dedi-
cated to recognizing distinguished profes-
sionals. The California Parks and Recreation 
Society has inducted her into its Hall of Fame, 
and she once served as its President and 
Secretary. She serves on the board of the San 
Mateo Police Activities League, the San Mateo 
Parks Foundation, and on numerous commu-
nity boards. As children are her professional 
focus, she also gives to the community as a 
board member of Peninsula Family Service 
and the Mills-Peninsula Hospital Foundation. 
She is a second-generation native of San 
Mateo and earned her BA from the University 
of San Francisco and an MPA from Notre 
Dame de Namur University. 
No recitation of her love of community 
would be complete without mentioning her 
heartfelt support of the city’s special relation-
ship with the 101st Airborne Division and the 
sister city relationship San Mateo enjoys with 
Toyonaka, Japan. In recent years, my staff re-
members attending a meeting where the city’s 
little league team took at least 30 minutes to 
explain to the city council the special time that 
the young people of San Mateo had as they 
played against, and with, their youthful coun-
terparts in Toyonaka. Organizers par excel-
lence of this opportunity were Sheila Canzian 
and her colleagues at the San Mateo Parks 
and Recreation Department. 
Along with City Clerk Patricia Olds and com-
munity 
member 
Linda 
Patterson, 
Sheila 
Canzian organizes all events that honor Alpha 
Company, 1st Battalion, 327th Infantry Regi-
ment, 1st Brigade, of the 101st Airborne Divi-
sion. The efforts of Sheila and hundreds of 
other San Mateo residents over the years 
since 1967 have boosted the morale of our 
troops and paid homage to their sacrifice for 
liberty on behalf of us all. 
Madam Speaker, it is my honor to recognize 
Sheila Canzian. If ever there was a case for 
pursuing a life of public service, I ask that we 
look at the public spaces nurtured by Sheila. 
The painter Claude Monet had his garden, 
and he built his life’s work around its beauty. 
Sheila Canzian had a city, and her joyful work 
will be with us for generations yet to come.

DOLLY TRAVIS 
HON. ED PERLMUTTER 
OF COLORADO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, June 7, 2022 
Mr. PERLMUTTER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize Dolly Anderson Travis of 
Lakewood, Colorado who will turn 100 years 
old on June 18, 2022. 
Dolly Anderson Travis was born June 18, 
1922 in Hazleton, Pennsylvania. Dolly’s great- 
grandparents immigrated from Austria and 
Slovakia. Dolly’s parents having only a grade 
school education valued education as a 
means to success in the United States and 
made it a priority for both her and her brother, 
Jan. When Dolly was 11 or so, her parents 
paid for a few piano lessons which they felt 
would provide a creative outlet for her and her 
brother. They both quickly discovered a pro-
digious talent for music. Within a year, Dolly 
and Jan were playing instrumental accompani-
ment for singers on Hazleton’s radio station 
WAZL and at other public events. While at Jul-
liard in the early 1940s, Dolly was recruited to 
participate in numerous musical and entertain-
ment events sponsored by the United Service 
Organization, started in 1941 to entertain sol-
diers, sailors and airmen departing for over-
sees deployment during WWII. She subse-
quently played in many swing-era bands in 
New York City, where she played the piano, 
accordion, guitar and saxophone. 
Dolly married a sailor from Brooklyn, New 
York in the early 1950s and moved to Denver, 
where she fell in love with the mountains and 
the great outdoors. She was fond of western, 
cowboy music and culture, and started a fam-
ily in Thornton, a Denver suburb, where her 
son Mark and daughter June would grow up. 
Dolly loves to shop for unique items and 
collectibles from the many indoor malls that 
dot the Denver landscape. Villa Italia mall in 
Lakewood, a suburb of Denver, was one of 
her favorites, offering a large variety of mer-
chandise at so many price points. She particu-
larly enjoyed the grilled cheese sandwiches 
that Woolworth offered in their restaurants in 
the early days of the mall and throughout their 
Denver locations. She enjoyed taking her chil-
dren to the Sinclair dinosaur exhibit in Villa 
Italia’s parking lot, featuring lifelike recreations 
of dinosaurs which Sinclair would host in Den-
ver and other cities during the 1960s. 
Dolly still plays the piano, walks without as-
sistance, and is addicted to blueberry and 
cherry pies. Dolly has an unfinished concerto 
she’s been composing for years, loves reading 
the funnies, and enjoys perusing tabloids and 
gossip magazines while hanging out at the 
local Starbucks. 
Celebrating 100 years of age is a tremen-
dous milestone and should be celebrated. It is 
my privilege to wish Dolly a very happy birth-
day and wish her all the best in the future.

BUCHANAN HIGH SCHOOL 
CENTENNIAL CELEBRATION 
HON. FRED UPTON 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, June 7, 2022 
Mr. UPTON. Madam Speaker, Buchanan 
High School has produced more than 10,000 
hardworking, bright individuals over the last 
hundred years who have gone on to better our 
community for generations to come. 
One hundred years ago Buchanan High 
School opened its doors for the very first time 
here. Twenty-five classrooms, an auditorium, a 
gymnasium and two offices were quickly filled 
with learning, listening and friendship. Over 
time this building has grown to accommodate 
increased enrollment and the ever-changing 
field of education. 
I would like to personally thank each and 
every educator, administrator and staff mem-
ber who made virtual learning possible for our 
students during the pandemic and laid the 
groundwork for us to return to in-person learn-
ing. It truly is good to be back to some nor-
malcy, but we must not forget the difficulties 
we faced not too long ago. The dedicated 
folks here at Buchanan High School made 
sure that every student had access to the 
internet and a dedicated laptop to learn, mak-
ing sure that no student was left behind. 
Under the leadership of many principals, first 
Floyd Early when Buchanan High School 
opened its doors and a century later under 
Stacey DeMaio, Buchanan High School has 
continued to ‘‘Develop responsible, resilient, 
creative citizens capable of succeeding in a 
global society.’’ 
I am eager to see the accomplishments 
Buchanan High School will achieve over these 
next one hundred years and the progress 
made both here in this building and by alumni 
across the world. 
And lastly, Go Bucks.

RECOGNIZING 
96-YEAR-OLD 
WAR 
HERO JOHN THOMAS WILLETT, A 
SURVIVOR OF THE USS ‘‘LSM- 
169’’ 
SHIP 
THAT 
HAD 
TO 
BE 
EVACUATED AFTER HITTING AN 
ENEMY MINE DURING WWII 
HON. BRIAN HIGGINS 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, June 7, 2022 
Mr. HIGGINS of New York. Madam Speak-
er, I rise today to honor John Thomas Willett, 
a Buffalo native who barely survived when the 
ship he was serving on hit an enemy mine 
while he was serving our great nation as a 
Seaman First Class in the U.S. Navy during 
World War II. 
Mr. Willett was born in Buffalo, New York in 
1926 where he attended high school before 
enlisting in the United States Navy in 1943 at 
the age of 17. He spent most of his service in 
the Asiatic Pacific Theater during World War 
II. He was stationed on the USS LSM–169 
where he participated in numerous battles in-
cluding the Battle of Corregidor, Luzon and 
Manila 
Bay-Bicol 
Operations 
where 
he 
achieved the rank of Seaman First Class. 
On February 15, 1945 the USS LSM–169 
struck a mine off the coast of the Mariveles 
Harbor in the Philippines. A massive explosion 
caused fires on the ship but Seaman First 
Class Willett was on the other side of the ship 
and miraculously survived. The USS LCS–48 
and the USS PC–1133 came to the rescue 
and saved as many service members as pos-
sible. Unfortunately, some service members 
lost their lives. Although he survived, after 
being pulled from the water and helping to 
rescue others, Seaman First Class Willett suf-
fered shrapnel wounds and hearing loss due 
to the explosion but continued his service until 
he was honorably discharged from the Navy 
on April 14, 1946. 
Upon returning home and graduating high 
school, John worked at Buffalo’s grain ele-
vators while attending college at night on the 
GI bill and got married. He enlisted in the Ma-
rine Corps Reserves on February 9, 1951 and 
spent the next few months training at Camp 
Pendleton in California during the Korean con-
flict. He officially was discharged from military 
service on September 1st of the same year he 
returned home to Buffalo to be with his wife 
and four children. He is still married to his wife 
of 73 years, Mildred and his family eventually 
grew to 12 children, 31 grandchildren and 16 
great grandchildren. He worked in the Aero-
space industry for almost 40 years, retiring 
from MOOG to pursue woodworking, athletics 
and volunteer 
work including Meals on 
Wheels, Habitat for Humanity, to name just a 
few. 
I am proud to recognize the bravery of 
World War II Veteran John Thomas Willett.

APPLE AWARD FOR EXCELLENCE 
IN TEACHING 
HON. CHERI BUSTOS 
OF ILLINOIS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, June 7, 2022 
Mrs. BUSTOS. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to recognize Andrew Lister, a teacher from 
Orion High School, for receiving the Golden 
Apple Award for Excellence in Teaching from 
the Golden Apple Foundation. 
The Golden Apple Award for Excellence in 
Teaching recognizes and honors our most out-
standing teachers for the positive and lasting 
impact they have on our students’ lives and 
our community as a whole. Mr. Lister is one 
of 10 award recipients in Illinois—selected out 
of 400 nominations of 9 through 12 grade 
teachers. I’m so glad to see Mr. Lister recog-
nized for inspiring students at Orion High 
School and his overall contributions to the 
Orion community. 
It is because of committed and honorable 
educators such as Mr. Lister that I am espe-
cially proud to serve Illinois’ 17th Congres-
sional District. Madam Speaker, I would like to 
again formally congratulate Andrew Lister for 
receiving the Golden Apple Award for Excel-
lence in Teaching.

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, June 7, 2022 
Mr. ALLEN. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
congratulate my constituent, Jean Morales- 
Ramos, upon his acceptance to the United 
States Naval Academy. 
As a future midshipman, he will be joining 
the ranks of the world’s most elite naval force, 
guided by the motto: ‘‘Semper Fortis’’. 
The service and sacrifice of America’s mili-
tary personnel have safeguarded our Nation

from Lexington to Normandy. 
And 
throughout 
our 
history, 
American 
servicemembers have demonstrated tremen-
dous courage and strength, beating back tyr-
anny to the ends of the earth. 
I was glad to sponsor Jean’s nomination 
and I am confident that his talents will distin-
guish him among his peers during his time at 
the Academy and thereafter. 
I congratulate Jean, and know he will make 
this Nation proud.

RECOGNIZING GAME WARDEN 
AARON KAMMANN 
HON. MATTHEW M. ROSENDALE, SR. 
OF MONTANA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, June 7, 2022 
Mr. ROSENDALE. Madam Speaker, I want 
to recognize the outstanding work of Montana 
Department of Fish, Wildlife & Parks’ Region 
3 Gallatin District Game Warden, Mr. Aaron 
Kammann from Bozeman, Montana. 
Montana’s game wardens have a responsi-
bility to provide protection for Montana’s di-
verse and highly treasured natural resources, 
and Warden Kammann’s actions exemplify 
proper stewardship of the Treasure State and 
commitment to Montana values and outdoor 
traditions. 
In addition, Mr. Kammann regularly brings 
confiscated and damaged wild game to a local 
food bank, FoodArk, which processes and dis-
tributes meat to those in need. His work ethic 
embodies the core principles of duty, selfless-
ness, and resourcefulness, and Montana is 
grateful for his public service. 
I thank Aaron for serving the people of Mon-
tana.

RECOGNIZING CORPORAL PATRICK 
DANIEL MCKEE 
HON. BRIAN K. FITZPATRICK 
OF PENNSYLVANIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, June 7, 2022 
Mr. FITZPATRICK. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize an outstanding constituent 
from my district, Patrick Daniel McKee. After 
29 years of service with the Plumstead Town-
ship Police Department, Corporal McKee is re-
tiring. Born and raised in Plumstead, Patrick 
graduated Central Bucks East High School 
and then began working in the auto repair 
field, finding such success that he owned and 
operated his own repair and service station. In 
December 1992, Patrick decided to attend the 
Montgomery County Community College Po-
lice Academy. By April 1993, he was hired by 
his hometown police department in Plumstead 
Township as a full-time, sworn police officer. 
Throughout his time with the department, he 
served as a Detective and attended numerous 
training programs related to investigations, in-
cluding the highly regarded FBI Intercounty 
Detective Training Program in 1998. By 2004, 
Patrick was promoted to the rank of Corporal 
and given the responsibility of overseeing a 
squad of patrol officers. Patrick also served as 
one of the department’s Firearms Instructors 
and armorer, training law enforcement officers 
in the proper use and safe handling of fire-
arms. 
Throughout Corporal McKee’s career, his 
commitment to service has not gone unno-
ticed. Members of the community writing to 
the department have expressed thanks for 
Patrick’s gracious, friendly, and respectful de-
meanor both in and out of uniform. He has 
also received letters of commendation from 
the Bucks County District Attorneys’ Office 
and the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania 
Board of Probation and Parole, to name just a 
couple. Patrick has proven himself to be an of-
ficer committed to protecting and defending 
his hometown and his neighbors. 
We are incredibly grateful for the positive 
impact that Corporal Patrick Daniel McKee 
has had throughout his long career of public 
service, and we wish him countless blessings 
during his retirement.

EDINBURGH BICENTENNIAL 
HON. GREG PENCE 
OF INDIANA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, June 7, 2022 
Mr. PENCE. Madam Speaker, I rise to rec-
ognize and celebrate the city of Edinburgh on 
the occasion of its grand Bicentennial. 
Edinburgh was the first settlement in John-
son County and was established March 3 
1822. Edinburgh’s history runs rich and deep, 
even boasting Johnson County’s oldest and 
first store. Standing alongside this historical 
store is the Edinburgh Post Office which has 
been in operation since 1823. 
Edinburgh represents the true spirit of 
America with businesses, communities, and 
our very own Camp Atterbury. Business 
thrives here where there were once railroads 
and mills, and where the hardwood veneer in-
dustry still stands. Another famous business 
finds its home here, founded in 1989, Not Just 
Popcorn, which has been recognized not only 
nationally, but globally. 
I would like to honor this great city. From its 
storied history to its present day standing here 
in Indiana, may Edinburgh be celebrated on 
this Bicentennial year.

HONORING 
THE 
SERVICE 
OF 
ISRAEL’S CONSUL GENERAL TO 
THE 
PACIFIC 
NORTHWEST 
SHLOMI KOFMAN 
HON. RO KHANNA 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, June 7, 2022 
Mr. KHANNA. Madam Speaker, today I rise 
to congratulate Israel’s Consul General to the 
Pacific Northwest Shlomi Kofman on the con-
clusion of his term of service, and his return 
on August 1, 2022, to Israel for his next as-
signment. 
Consul General Kofman is the diplomatic 
representative of the State of Israel to the 
states of California (Northern region), Oregon, 
Washington, Alaska, Idaho and Montana. 
During his tenure, he actively promoted 
friendly relationships with government rep-
resentatives from this region, including Mem-
bers of Congress, and he has never hesitated 
to reach out to me to address questions for 
my constituents or serve as a resource on 
issues related to Israel and the Israeli commu-
nity in my district. 
Shlomi Kofman began his appointment as 
Israel’s Consul General to the Pacific North-
west in August 2017. 
He most recently served as a Policy Advisor 
to the Deputy Foreign Ministers based in Jeru-
salem, Israel. 
Over the course of his 24-year diplomatic 
career, Kofman has served as Israel’s Deputy 
Consul General in New York City, Chief of 
Staff to Ambassadors in Washington D.C., 
Deputy Ambassador in Thailand and Deputy 
Consul General in Shanghai. 
His past domestic Foreign Ministry positions 
include Director of North American Economic 
Affairs, Policy Advisor to the Deputy Foreign 
Minister, Diplomatic Advisor & Director of the 
International Department in the Parliament and 
Ministry of National Infrastructure, and the 
Head of the Northeast Asia sector. 
Prior to joining the Foreign Ministry, Kofman 
worked in the High-Tech Industry, rep-
resenting the Israeli company Orbot in South 
Korea, as well as a consultant to a leading 
Israeli company, ECI. 
Kofman holds a Bachelor of Arts in Inter-
national Relations & East Asian studies from 
the Hebrew University in Jerusalem and a 
master’s degree from Webster University— 
Shanghai University of Finance & Economics. 
He also holds an Associate’s engineering de-
gree. 
Shlomi was born in Tbilisi, the capitol of the 
Soviet Republic of Georgia and made Aliya 
(immigrated) to Israel at the age of nine, after 
being refused for three years by Russian au-
thorities. 
During his tenure as Consul General serving 
in the Pacific Northwest, Shlomi Kofman has 
broadened the relationship between Israel and 
the states under his jurisdiction. 
His advocacy and leadership led to a first- 
of-its-kind economic analysis that quantified 
the deeply interconnected California-Israel re-
lationship, which amounts to billions of dollars 
in business activity and trade, and hundreds of 
thousands of Israelis living and working in 
California. 
In a time where we witness increases in 
antisemitism, Holocaust denial, and violence 
against Jews, he has prioritized Holocaust 
education and policies to combat antisemitism 
and anti-Israel sentiment. 
He has been a strong advocate for expand-
ing cooperation between governments and 
businesses in the areas of agriculture, energy, 
innovation, water management, and emer-
gency services mutual aid. 
In 2020, during the height of the wildfire ca-
tastrophe in California, Israel, for the first time 
ever, sent a delegation of firefighters to assist 
in fighting the fires. This was not only a ges-
ture of solidarity and friendship but also a reaf-
firmation of values that both the United States 
and Israel share-which is to stand together 
with allies in times of need. 
In that spirit, he convened high-level sum-
mits with policymakers to promote the sharing 
of COVID–19 strategies. 
He has strengthened Israel’s connections 
with businesses, local communities, univer-
sities, and other academic institutions here in 
the United States. 
Shlomi Kofman worked to increase the num-
ber of delegations of Americans visiting Israel 
to further study firsthand that country as well 
as organize diverse international delegations 
to visit the United States. 
These important exchanges focused on ex-
panding understand of diverse communities 
throughout the world, including people of 
color, women in leadership, the LGBTQ+ com-
munity, labor leaders, and citizen activists 
from Arab countries. 
In addition, I personally have benefitted from 
my meetings with Consul General Kofman, 
where we shared honest conversations about 
the issues of the day. We discussed the com-
mon ties of entrepreneurship between Silicon 
Valley and Israel, and how such cooperation 
can benefit other regions of the world. I hope 
to continue that dialogue with his successor. 
As Shlomi Kofman concludes his tenure in 
San Francisco, I am grateful that he built a 
legacy of friendship, cooperation, and a strong 
willingness to work with people from all back-
grounds and perspectives. 
The United States has greatly benefitted 
from the services of Consul General Shlomi 
Kofman.

Mr. CARBAJAL. Madam Speaker, Harris 
Gelberg, M.D. has been a Santa Barbara resi-
dent since 1978. He has served the commu-
nity as a cardiologist for over 44 years, caring 
for thousands of Santa Barbara residents. 
He has demonstrated extraordinary dedica-
tion to his patients, many of whom he cared

days. He took the extra time to not only treat 
his patients’ heart conditions, but he coordi-
nated their overall health care to help them re-
main healthy, active, and vibrant. He served 
as Chief of the Medical Staff of Cottage Hos-
pital and mentored numerous physicians. De-
spite his busy medical practice, he is devoted 
to Bernice, his spouse since 1971, their chil-
dren, Grant and Laura, and their grand-

years of service to the community, he has re-
tired from the practice of medicine.

M.D. for his years of dedicated service to the 
people of Santa Barbara and commends him 
for his tireless efforts to improve the health 
and well-being of so many residents of our

of Marriage Equality. This past September, the 
New York Historical Society held a ceremonial 
groundbreaking for the American LGBTQ+ 
Museum, New York’s first museum dedicated 
to LGBTQ+ history and culture, which is set to 
open in 2024. This new installation honoring 
Ms. Windsor was made possible through the 
contribution of artifacts from her archive by her 
widow, Judith Kasen-Windsor. 
Edie Windsor first became involved in the 
fight for equality after the 1969 Stonewall 
Riots and quickly emerged as a leader. Her 
historic challenge to the unconstitutional De-
fense of Marriage Act (DOMA) compelled the 
federal government to recognize valid mar-
riages between same sex couples and paved 
the way for marriage equality in the United 
States. 
Ms. Windsor grew up during the Great De-
pression, the youngest of three children in a 
Russian Jewish immigrant family. She re-
ceived her undergraduate degree from Temple 
University and a master’s degree in mathe-
matics from New York University. The fol-
lowing year she began to work at IBM and 
was steadily promoted to the top technical po-
sition during her 16 years at the company. 
In 1963, Edie Windsor met her first wife, 
Thea Spyer. Two years later the couple began 
dating. They became engaged in 1967 despite 
the lack of legal recognition of same sex cou-
ples anywhere in the United States. After the 
1969 Stonewall Rebellion, Ms. Windsor and 
Ms. Spyer became more involved in sup-
porting and advocating for rights for the City’s 
LGBTQ+ community. Ms. Windsor volunteered 
with the LGBTQ+ Community Center, the East 
End Gay Organization, Gay & Lesbian Advo-
cates & Defenders, and the 1994 Gay Games 
in New York. She also served on the board of 
Services & Advocacy for the LGBT GLBT El-
ders (SAGE) and help found Old Queers Act-
ing Up, a social justice skit comedy and im-
provisation group. 
In 2009, Thea Spyer passed away, leaving 
the entirety of her estate to her wife, Edie. 
Due to DOMA, Edie Windsor was prohibited 
from claiming the estate tax exemption for sur-
viving spouses and was faced with a nearly 
half million-dollar tax liability. In 2010, Ms. 
Windsor sued the federal government for a full 
tax refund in a series of court cases that made 
it all the way to the Supreme Court in 2013. 
In 2013, Edie Windsor’s suit was upheld by 
the Supreme Court ruling finding DOMA un-
constitutional. This validation of her decades 
long partnership with Ms. Spyer was not only 
a vindication for Ms. Windsor but for countless 
LGBTQ+ couples around the Nation. Two 
years later, the Supreme Court made marriage 
a constitutional right guaranteed to all Ameri-
cans. In 2016, Ms. Windsor found love again, 
marrying Judith Kasen-Windsor. Ms. Windsor’s 
passing in the fall of 2017 marked the end of 
a truly heroic life spent championing equality. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in recognizing the extraordinary gumption 
and the incomparable advocacy of Ms. Wind-
sor on behalf of the entire LGBTQ+ commu-
nity throughout her long and accomplished life.

HONORING BRYCE DAVIS 
HON. RICK W. ALLEN

Tuesday, June 7, 2022 
Mr. ALLEN. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
congratulate my constituent, Bryce Davis, 
upon his acceptance to the United States Mili-
tary Academy at West Point. 
As a future cadet, he will be joining the 
ranks of the world’s most fearsome fighting 
force—the United States Army—guided by 
duty, honor, and country. 
The service and sacrifice of America’s mili-
tary personnel have safeguarded our Nation 
since its inception, defending our way of life 
from Lexington to Normandy. 
And throughout our history, American sol-
diers have demonstrated tremendous courage 
and strength, beating back tyranny to the ends 
of the earth. 
I was glad to sponsor Bryce’s nomination 
and I am confident that his talents will distin-
guish him among his peers both during his 
time at West Point and thereafter. 
I congratulate Bryce, and know that he will 
make this Nation proud.
