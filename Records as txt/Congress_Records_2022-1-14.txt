PRAYER 
The Chaplain, the Reverend Margaret 
Grun Kibben, offered the following 
prayer: 
Holy God, You have set before us so 
many heroes and legends who have run 
the race faithfully and left behind 
them legacies that have contributed to 
breaking oppressive barriers and free-
ing history from intolerant attitudes. 
On this weekend, we honor the leg-
endary Martin Luther King, Jr., whose 
life and service exemplified faith and 
fortitude in the face of prejudice, 
whose courage and compassion stood 
firm against bigotry and hate. 
You, O Lord, were King’s deliverer, 
and You have promised to deliver us 
from our personal ordeals and tragic 
situations. Call us to heed his words of 
hope, that it is up to us to respond to 
life’s situations not with bitterness, 
but with a commitment to transform 
our suffering into a creative force. 
For You, O Lord, are the creative 
source of our hope. 
Redeem our lives this day. Redeem 
our suffering, our tragedies, our bitter-
ness, that the legacy we leave behind 
would prove as faithful. 
In Your sovereign name we pray. 
Amen.

HONORING THE RETIREMENT OF 
BROWNSTOWN CHARTER TOWN-
SHIP 
SUPERVISOR 
ANDREW 
LINKO 
HON. DEBBIE DINGELL 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, January 14, 2022 
Mrs. DINGELL. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize Supervisor Andrew Linko 
on the occasion of his retirement from the 
Charter Township of Brownstown, Michigan, 
where he has served as supervisor for over a 
decade. His significant contributions to our 
community are worthy of commendation. 
Supervisor Linko began his journey of serv-
ice as a Construction Electrician in the U.S. 
Naval Reserves, where he served from 1983 
until 1993. A graduate of Youngstown State 
University, Wayne State University, and Baker 
College, he studied labor, leadership, electrical 
engineering, and health and human services. 
An active member of his community from a 
young age, he has served in various volunteer 
positions in local politics in Ohio. He was first 
elected to the position of City Councilman in 
Warren, Ohio, where he served as chair of the 
health and welfare committee. 
Supervisor Linko came to find his new home 
in Brownstown Township when he moved to 
Michigan in 1996 to work for Ford Motor Com-
pany. He worked at Ford until his retirement in 
2021. A devoted member of the United Auto 
Workers, he was a Trustee at UAW Local 387 
where he was a leader among his union broth-
ers and sisters and showed his commitment to 
our auto industry. His experience as a leader 
in the labor movement inspired him to run for 
office and show people how workers should 
be treated. Supervisor Linko started out serv-
ing the township on the Zoning Board of Ap-
peals. He became treasurer of the Board of 
Trustees in 2008 and was appointed Township 
Supervisor in 2010. He was subsequently re- 
elected in 2012, 2016, and 2020. During his 
tenure, he has been a champion for public 
safety. As supervisor, he oversaw the comple-
tion of a $6 million recreation campus. His ac-
complishments include reducing the town-
ship’s carbon footprint, welcoming hundreds of 
new residents, encouraging economic invest-
ment, and delivering new jobs for the people 
of 
the 
township. 
Under 
his 
leadership, 
Brownstown Township has become one of the 
fastest growing communities in Wayne Coun-
ty. Supervisor Linko is a member of the 
Woodhaven-Brownstown Rotary and resides 
in Brownstown Township with his wife, Linda. 
Together they have two daughters and one 
granddaughter. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in honoring Supervisor Andrew Linko. We 
are grateful for his years spent serving the citi-
zens of Brownstown Charter Township. Andy 
is someone that I am proud to call a friend, 
and I have depended on him for advice, wis-
dom, and guidance for years. I join with his 
family, friends, and colleagues in extending 
my best wishes to him in retirement.

FRIENDS OF THE EARTH,

DEAR
REPRESENTATIVE: 
On 
behalf 
of 
Friends of the Earth’s millions of members 
and supporters, we write in strong support of 
the House Amendment to the Senate Amend-
ment to H.R. 5746, the Freedom to Vote: 
John R. Lewis Act, which will ensure that 
voters can safely and freely cast their bal-
lots, protect against election sabotage, stop 
partisan gerrymandering, and limit the in-
fluence of dark money in politics so that bil-
lionaires can’t buy elections. 
Guaranteeing a strong and functioning de-
mocracy, including the right to vote, is crit-
ical to ensuring that our government can 
adequately address the many environmental 
challenges our country faces, from climate 
change to environmental justice. 
The Freedom to Vote: John R. Lewis Act 
will ensure that voters can safely and freely 
cast their ballots, protect against election 
sabotage, stop partisan gerrymandering, and 
limit the influence of dark money in politics 
so that billionaires can’t buy elections. 
Nineteen states enacted 34 new laws that 
restrict access to the ballot box in 2021 alone 
and more are under consideration today. 
Candidates are running for top election of-
fices peddling the Big Lie. States are passing 
racially-gerrymandered maps that dilute the 
power of Black and Brown voters. This legis-
lation would fight back against all these at-
tacks and ensure the ability for every Amer-
ican to participate in safe, accessible, and 
transparent elections. 
Our organization fully endorses this bill 
and urges you to support this legislation.

HOUSE
OF
REPRESENTA-
TIVES: 
DEAR
REPRESENTATIVE: The League of 
Women Voters of the United States writes in 
strong support of the House Amendment to 
the Senate Amendment to H.R. 5746, the 
Freedom to Vote: John R. Lewis Act. This 
legislation is critical to the protection our 
democracy. We must ensure that voters can 
safely and freely cast their ballots, stop par-
tisan gerrymandering, and limit the influ-
ence of dark money in politics so that bil-
lionaires cannot buy elections. 
Our country remains in the middle of a 
desperate fight for voting rights. State legis-
latures around the country have introduced 
hundreds of bills designed to create barriers 
and prevent Black, brown, indigenous, and 
other voters from casting their ballots. In 
2021, nineteen states enacted 34 voter sup-
pression laws, and we know more will go into 
effect in the months ahead. 
Right now, redistricting processes across 
the country are underway. This is the first 
redistricting cycle without the full protec-
tions of the Voting Rights Act. Voters are 
not just at risk of losing their freedom to 
vote, but they stand to lose representation 
in the US Congress and in state legislatures. 
Critical legislation like the Freedom to Vote 
Act and the John Lewis Voting Rights Ad-
vancement Act are urgently needed to over-
ride these voter suppression measures, pre-
vent such laws from taking effect in the fu-
ture, and protecting representation in com-
munities across the country. 
Our organization fully endorses this bill 
and urges you to cast your vote in favor of 
this legislation. 
Sincerely, 
VIRGINIA KASE SOLOMO´ N, 
CEO,

of 
Women Voters of the

American 
Women’s 
Forum 
(NAPAWF) is proud to endorse the House 
Amendment to the Senate Amendment to 
H.R. 5746, the Freedom to Vote: John R. 
Lewis Act, and strongly urges you to VOTE 
YES to support our access to the ballot. 
Asian 
Americans 
and 
Pacific 
Islanders 
(AAPI) are the fastest-growing populations 
in the nation, and our ability to make 
choices about issues that impact us is on the 
line. 
NAPAWF is the only national, progressive, 
multi-issue, community organizing and pol-
icy advocacy organization for AAPI women 
and girls in the country. NAPAWF ap-
proaches our work through the reproductive 
justice framework, which is rooted in the 
human right to control our bodies, our sexu-
ality, our gender, and our reproduction. 
Core to NAPAWF’s work is our commit-
ment to building power with AAPI women 
and girls. Through our chapters in Arizona, 
Chicago, Florida, Georgia, Indiana, New 
York City, St. Cloud, and Texas, we center 
our organizing on the AAPI women who are 
most impacted by the issues we work on, 
such as workers with low wages, first-gen-
eration immigrants, and people who speak 
English as a second language. Our base spans 
at least twenty different AAPI ethnic groups 
and is multigenerational. 
This is why protecting voting rights is so 
crucial to us. Many of the issues we care 
about are intrinsically linked to the power of 
voting and NAPAWF is excited that the 
House is advancing this important issue. Our 
communities need support now, please vote 
YES. 
If you have any questions, please contact 
Da Hae Kim, NAPAWF’s Judicial Strategy 
and Legal Advocacy Manager.

SIERRA CLUB,

Re: Sierra Club’s support for the Freedom to 
Vote: John R. Lewis Act. 
DEAR REPRESENTATIVE: On behalf of our 
over 3.8 million members and supporters, I 
write to express our strong support for the 
Freedom to Vote: John R. Lewis Act and 
urge it’s immediate passage. 
This act will ensure every American has 
equitable access to the ballot box, protect 
against election sabotage, prohibit extreme 
partisan gerrymandering and set limits on 
the influence of dark money in politics. Pro-
tecting and strengthening the freedom to 
vote for every American is the bedrock prin-
ciple of our democracy and this Act seeks to 
do just that. 
Last year alone, prompted by the Big Lie, 
over 400 anti-voter bills were introduced with 
19 states enacting more than 30 of those 
laws, all with the intent of rolling back vot-
ing rights for Americans. This year as state 
legislatures convene, more anti-voter bills 
have already been prefiled with more ex-
pected to be introduced and passed in the 
coming weeks/months. Federal legislation is 
desperately needed in order to stop these 
states attacks on voting rights. 
The time is now, we must act swiftly to 
protect the freedom to vote and ensure our 
democracy is equatibly accessible to all 
Americans, regardless of zip code. We urge 
our Representatives on behalf of our 3.8 mil-
lion members and supporters, to not delay 
and immediately pass the Freedom to Vote: 
John R. Lewis Act. 
Sincerely, 
DAN CHU, 
Acting Executive Director,

HONORING ROBYN DOBERNECKER 
AS IOWAN OF THE WEEK 
HON. CYNTHIA AXNE 
OF IOWA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, January 14, 2022 
Mrs. AXNE. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
ask the House of Representatives to join me 
in recognizing Robyn Dobernecker as Iowan 
of the Week. 
An Iowa native, Robyn has had a passion 
for animals for as Long as she could remem-
ber. She got her start as a kennel attendant at 
age 18, working with animals who needed to 
be adopted. She rose up through the ranks 
and became a senior animal control officer, 
where she humanely took animals off the 
streets, got them fed and cleaned, and ready 
for adoption. She decided to broaden her hori-
zons and work at a vet clinic to better under-
stand animal medicine. Through this, she fi-
nally got into the Animal Rescue League 
(ARL) of Iowa, where she is now the interven-
tion coordinator and is responsible for confis-
cating animals abused at facilities in the state 
of Iowa. She is also the official point of contact 
for the rescue efforts for over 500 dogs that 
were confiscated by a puppy mill breeder, who 
received one of the harshest penalties for ani-
mal welfare violations in USDA history. 
After getting three complaints about dog 
abuse in the summer of 2021, Robyn decided 
to investigate. What she found was appall-
ing—animals left alone, abused, and ne-
glected. Finding these dogs had little to no 
water, no food, and inadequate shelter, she 
immediately called the Iowa attorney general, 
whose authorization was required to get into 
the facility and confiscate the animals. With no 
response, she decided to go to the breeder’s 
hearing, where the USDA and DOJ were pros-
ecuting. Hearing that the breeder’s trial will be 
delayed, Robyn barged into a room of the 
courthouse full of federal prosecutors for DOJ 
and said, ‘‘My name is Robyn, my job is to 
help animals get out of abusive homes. But to 
do what I do, I need your authorization and for 
you to get on board, and I need a restraining 
order so I can get ahold of these dogs.’’ This 
was on a Friday. On that next Monday, DOJ 
reached out to her and asked if they could 
work with her to get these dogs out of the fa-
cility. 
After coordinating with government agencies 
and other animal rescue organizations, she 
was able to rescue the first round of dogs on 
October 13th. Once the breeder officially sur-
rendered on November 1st, Robyn went in 
with her team and was able to confiscate the 
rest of the 414 dogs—she got all of them out 
over the next two days. This difficult feat was 
catalyzed by Robyn’s desire to make a dif-
ference for communities. To see those dogs’ 
tails wag for the first time and being able to 
hug and kiss the puppies once they were all 
clean made the process of rescuing them 
worth it. While there is always more work to 
do to counter animal abuse, we can revel in 
the admirable work it takes to rescue those 
who are in harm’s way. 
I 
am 
honored 
to 
designate 
Robyn 
Dobernecker as Iowan of the Week.

SUPPORTING H.R. 6330, THE NON-
MARKET 
ECONOMY 
OVER-
CAPACITY REFORM ACT 
HON. BRIAN HIGGINS 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, January 14, 2022 
Mr. HIGGINS of New York. Madam Speak-
er, I rise today to announce my introduction of 
H.R. 6330, the Nonmarket Economy Over-
capacity Reform Act. 
For too long, the United States has been 
deferential to foreign governments who under-
mine American workers and manufacturers 
through unfair trade practices, targeted sub-
sidization, and excess production capacity. 
This playbook involves undercutting American 
industry, flooding the domestic markets with 
imports, distorting competition, and driving 
competition under. 
Our trade laws allow American manufactur-
ers to seek relief from the International Trade 
Commission only after they’ve sustained mate-
rial injury from uncompetitive trading practices. 
The decline in American manufacturing shows 
these laws to be insufficient. How many dor-
mant American factories could have been 
saved before unfairly subsidized imports flood-
ed U.S. markets? How much wealth has been 
shipped overseas, only to come back in the 
form of goods that put American workers out 
of a job? 
Last year, the United States Trade Rep-
resentative testified before the Ways and 
Means Committee on the need for forward- 
looking trade laws that protect American in-
dustry from price dumping, unfair competition, 
and illegal subsidies. In many cases, we know 
non-market economies intend to undermine 
American workers and our nation’s industrial 
base through unfair means—it is their stated 
policy. 
The Nonmarket Economy Overcapacity Re-
form Act will give the United States the tools 
we need to protect American jobs from the 
looming and established threat of global ex-
cess capacity. This narrowly tailored bill gives 
the United States the right to proactively seek 
antidumping and countervailing duties in dem-
onstrated instances of buildup in excess pro-
duction capacity. By focusing on non-market 
economies, this bill seeks to preserve the ben-
eficial and lawful competitive trading relations 
we have established with our allies and good- 
faith trading partners around the globe. 
Madam Speaker, the United States has a 
responsibility to protect our Nation’s manufac-
turers from unfair trading practices. When put 
on a level playing field, I know American work-
ers can outperform anyone in the world—we 
must support them. I urge my colleagues to 
support H.R. 6330, the Nonmarket Economy 
Overcapacity Reform Act.

HONORING THE LIFE AND LEGACY 
OF MR. JOHN MCDONALD 
HON. DEBBIE DINGELL 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, January 14, 2022 
Mrs. DINGELL. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize the life and legacy of John 
McDonald, Local 1650 president and emeritus 
faculty member at Henry Ford College in 
Dearborn, Michigan. His significant contribu-
tions to Henry Ford College, the greater Dear-
born community, and beyond are worthy of 
commendation. 
After graduating from Detroit Catholic Cen-
tral High School, Mr. McDonald attended 
Henry Ford College and then the University of 
Michigan—Ann Arbor, where he earned bach-
elor’s and master’s degrees in English. He 
began teaching 19th century American lit-
erature and English composition at the college 
in 1969. After gaining tenure in 1971, he be-
came involved in Henry Ford Community Col-
lege American Federation of Teachers’ Local 
1650 and soon became a trusted leader

among his peers. Under his leadership, Mr. 
McDonald was the master negotiator and 
Local 1650 was a force to be reckoned with. 
They negotiated strong contracts featuring 
shared 
governance, 
community 
service, 
wages, post tenure review, distance edu-
cation, intellectual property, and professional 
development. His leadership brought recogni-
tion to the union on a national level, where Mr. 
McDonald served as the American Federation 
of Teachers National Vice President. To cele-
brate his 40th anniversary as president of 
Local 1650, his fellow officers dedicated the 
Library of Labor Studies at Henry Ford Col-
lege in his honor. 
A fixture at Henry Ford College and in Dear-
born, Mr. McDonald was an advocate for edu-
cation and for his community. As he often 
said, ‘‘Henry Ford College is Dearborn’s Col-
lege.’’ He knew that this school opened doors 
for its students and relished in uplifting all who 
crossed his path. The ultimate educator, the 
world was his classroom. Those who knew 
him know of his tenacity, compassion, and 
sharp wit. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in honoring the life of John McDonald, we 
are all thankful for his dedication to education 
and the labor movement. A trusted friend and 
confidante of mine and a giant in our commu-
nity, our thoughts are with his wife, Denise, 
and his family at this time. We are forever 
grateful for his lifetime of work and know that 
his legacy will live on in those who he touched 
at Henry Ford College.

EXTENSION ACT OF 2021 
SPEECH OF 
HON. JAMIE RASKIN 
OF MARYLAND 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, January 13, 2022 
Mr. RASKIN. Madam Speaker, I include in 
the RECORD the following letters of support for 
the Senate Amendment to H.R. 5746. 
DEMOCRACY 21, 
Washington, DC, January 13, 2022. 
DEAR
REPRESENTATIVE: 
Democracy 
21 
strongly supports and urges you to vote for 
the House Amendment to the Senate Amend-
ment to H.R. 5746, the Freedom to Vote: 
John R. Lewis Act and for the rule to bring 
it to the House floor. 
The right of every eligible American to 
vote and have their vote properly counted is 
the cornerstone of our democracy. This fun-
damental right and our democracy are at 
grave risk today. 
In 2021, Republican-controlled state legis-
latures across the country enacted a wave of 
unprecedented voter suppression and elec-
tion sabotage laws in the name of ‘‘election 
integrity.’’ More are expected to be enacted 
in 2022. 
The state laws stemmed from the Trump 
Big Lie that the 2020 presidential election 
was stolen from him, even though there was 
not a shred of evidence to support his dema-
gogic claim. Trump’s own top government 
security officials found that the 2020 election 
‘‘was the most secure in American history.’’ 
The Freedom to Vote: John R. Lewis Act 
would override the state voter suppression 
laws for federal elections and combat the 
state election sabotage laws that empower 
partisan election officials to rig the results 
of federal races. The Act would also prevent 
partisan gerrymandering and provide essen-
tial campaign finance reforms. 
The Act would protect the right of every 
eligible American to vote and preserve our 
democracy. 
Democracy 21 strongly urges you to vote 
for the Freedom to Vote: John R. Lewis Act. 
Sincerely, 
FRED WERTHEIMER, 
President. 
DE¯ MOS, 
January 13, 2022. 
DEAR REPRESENTATIVE: We write in strong 
support of the House Amendment to the Sen-
ate Amendment to H.R. 5746, the Freedom to 
Vote: John R. Lewis Act, which will ensure 
that voters can safely and freely cast their 
ballots, protect against election sabotage, 
stop partisan gerrymandering, and limit the 
influence of dark money in politics so that 
billionaires can’t buy elections. 
Nineteen states enacted 34 new laws that 
restrict access to the ballot box in 2021 alone 
and more are under consideration today. 
Candidates are running for top election of-
fices peddling the Big Lie. States are passing 
racially gerrymandered maps that dilute the 
power of Black and Brown voters. This legis-
lation would fight back against all these at-
tacks and ensure the ability for every Amer-
ican to participate in safe, accessible, and 
transparent elections. 
De¯mos is a think tank that powers the 
movement for a just, inclusive, multiracial 
democracy. De¯mos means ‘‘the people’’ and 
is the root word of democracy. Our name re-
minds us that America’s power is derived 
from the diversity of its people, and that we 
do not have democracy unless all of our peo-
ple can participate meaningfully in the po-
litical process. 
The Freedom to Vote: John R. Lewis Act is 
a major step in the direction of ensuring all 
Americans can participate in our democracy. 
Our organization fully endorses this bill and 
urges you to support this legislation. 
Sincerely, 
TAIFA SMITH BUTLER, 
President, De¯mos.

PROJECT ON GOVERNMENT OVERSIGHT, 
January 13, 2022. 
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, 
Washington, DC. 
DEAR REPRESENTATIVES: I write on behalf 
of the Project On Government Oversight, in 
strong support of the House Amendment to 
the Senate Amendment to H.R. 5746, the 
Freedom to Vote: John R. Lewis Act, which 
will ensure that voters can safely and freely 
cast their ballots, protect against election 
sabotage, stop partisan gerrymandering, and 
limit the influence of dark money in politics. 
This legislation is necessary to protect the 
freedom of all Americans to elect their lead-
ers. 
POGO is a nonpartisan independent watch-
dog that investigates and exposes waste, cor-
ruption, abuse of power, and when the gov-
ernment fails to serve the public or silences 
those who report wrongdoing. We champion 
reforms to achieve a more effective, ethical, 
and accountable federal government that 
safeguards constitutional principles. 
The freedom to vote is under threat across 
the country. In 2021 alone, 19 states enacted 
34 new laws that restrict access to the ballot 
box. More are under consideration today. 
Candidates are running for top election of-
fices spreading dangerous and debunked 
claims of widespread voter fraud. States are 
passing racially gerrymandered maps that 
dilute the power of Black and brown voters. 
This legislation would fight back against all 
these attacks and protect the foundational 
right to participate in safe, accessible, and 
transparent elections. 
Elections allow citizens to choose their 
leaders—and to vote them out of office if 
they abuse their power or act corruptly. Un-
dermining Americans’ ability to cast their 
ballots weakens the single best tool we have 
to hold our government and its leaders ac-
countable. Our elected officials need to stop 
everything else they are doing and prioritize 
efforts to preserve our democracy. 
The Project On Government Oversight 
fully endorses the Freedom to Vote: John R. 
Lewis Act and urges you to support this leg-
islation.
