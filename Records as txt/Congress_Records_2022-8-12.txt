Vol. 168 
WASHINGTON, FRIDAY, AUGUST 12, 2022 
No. 135 
House of Representatives 
The House met at 9 a.m. and was 
called to order by the Speaker. 
f 
PRAYER 
The Chaplain, the Reverend Margaret 
Grun Kibben, offered the following 
prayer: 
Holy God, receive us into Your eter-
nal presence and grant us the discern-
ment of Your direction and the peace 
of Your purpose for the deliberations of 
this day. Silence, if only for a moment, 
all voices but Your own, that we would 
hear Your counsel and receive Your in-
struction without the echoes of com-
peting opinion or the whispers of our 
own self desire. 
Speak in words that we can hear, 
whether in a still, small voice of en-
couragement or a clarion call to ac-
tion, may we receive Your message for 
us today. 
Sway our hearts to Your desire that 
in all we say and do we would strive to 
live into Your will. Then share with us 
the blessing of the sacrament of human 
encounter, that in the outward visible 
signs You provide, a stranger’s selfless 
service, shared laughter with a friend, 
or a random glimpse of the pure beauty 
of Your creation, we would experience 
the inward, invisible grace You offer us 
in each moment. 
Would that Your eyes be open and 
Your ears attentive to the prayers we 
offer in this place, for it is in the prom-
ise of Your name we pray. 
Amen.

lic for which it stands, one nation under God, 
indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.

COMMUNICATION FROM THE 
CLERK OF THE HOUSE 
The SPEAKER laid before the House 
the following communication from the 
Clerk of the House of Representatives: 
OFFICE OF THE CLERK, 
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, 
Washington, DC, August 12, 2022. 
Hon. NANCY PELOSI, 
Speaker, House of Representatives, 
Washington, DC. 
DEAR MADAM SPEAKER: I have the honor to 
transmit herewith a scanned copy of a letter 
received from Mr. Steve Simon, Secretary of 
State of Minnesota, indicating that, accord-
ing to the unofficial results for the Special 
Election held August 9, 2022, the Honorable 
Brad Finstad was elected for Representative 
to Congress for the First Congressional Dis-
trict, State of Minnesota. 
With best wishes, I am, 
Sincerely, 
CHERYL L. JOHNSON, 
Clerk. 
STATE OF MINNESOTA, 
OFFICE OF MINNESOTA SECRETARY OF 
STATE, 
August 10, 2022. 
Hon. CHERYL L. JOHNSON, 
Clerk, House of Representatives, 
Washington, DC. 
DEAR MS. JOHNSON: This is to advise you 
that the unofficial results of the Special 
Election held on Tuesday, August 9, 2022, for 
Representative in Congress from the 1st Con-
gressional District of Minnesota, show that 
Brad Finstad received 59,797 votes, or 50.77% 
of the 117,784 votes cast for that office. 
It would appear from these unofficial re-
sults that Brad Finstad was elected as Rep-
resentative in Congress from the 1st Con-
gressional District of Minnesota. 
To the best of our knowledge and belief, at 
this time, there is no contest to this elec-
tion. 
As soon as the official results are certified 
to this office by all counties involved and 
canvassed by the State Canvassing Board, 
and the times for requesting a recount, filing 
a contest, or the statutorily required seven 
day waiting period, have expired, an official 
Certificate of Election will be prepared for 
transmittal as required by Minnesota law. 
Sincerely, 
STEVE SIMON, 
Secretary of State of Minnesota.

SWEARING IN OF THE HONORABLE 
BRAD FINSTAD OF MINNESOTA, 
AS A MEMBER OF THE HOUSE 
Ms. MCCOLLUM. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that the gentleman 
from Minnesota, the Honorable BRAD 
FINSTAD, be permitted to take the oath 
of office today. 
His certificate of election has not ar-
rived, but there is no contest and no 
question has been raised with regard to 
his election. 
The SPEAKER. Is there objection to 
the request of the gentlewoman from 
Minnesota? 
There was no objection. 
The SPEAKER. Will the Representa-
tive-elect and the members of the Min-
nesota delegation present themselves 
in the well. 
All Members will rise and the Rep-
resentative-elect will please raise his 
right hand. 
BRAD FINSTAD appeared at the bar 
of the House and took the oath of of-
fice, as follows: 
Do you solemnly swear or affirm that you 
will support and defend the Constitution of 
the United States against all enemies, for-
eign and domestic; that you will bear true 
faith and allegiance to the same; that you 
take this obligation freely, without any 
mental reservation or purpose of evasion; 
and that you will well and faithfully dis-

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H7560 
August 12, 2022 
WELCOMING 
THE 
HONORABLE 
BRAD FINSTAD TO THE HOUSE 
OF REPRESENTATIVES 
The SPEAKER. Without objection, 
the gentlewoman from Minnesota (Ms. 
MCCOLLUM) is recognized for 1 minute. 
There was no objection. 
Ms. MCCOLLUM. Madam Speaker, on 
behalf of myself and the entire delega-
tion from Minnesota, I would like to 
welcome Representative BRAD FINSTAD 
to the House of Representatives. 
Hailing from New Ulm, Minnesota, 
Representative FINSTAD
continues a 
proud tradition within the Minnesota 
Congressional Delegation of a life of 
public service and a commitment to 
agricultural issues and rural develop-
ment. 
From 2003 to 2009, he served as a 
member of the Minnesota House of 
Representatives, including a term as 
assistant minority leader. 
In the previous administration, Rep-
resentative FINSTAD
served as Min-
nesota’s Director of USDA Rural De-
velopment. He has also held leadership 
positions in the Center for Rural Pol-
icy and Development and the Min-
nesota Turkey Growers Association. 
And I will brag for a second that Min-
nesota is the largest turkey producer 
in the United States. You don’t have 
Thanksgiving without us. 
Today, Representative FINSTAD con-
tinues a proud generational tradition 
with his wife, Jackie, of running their 
family farm in the New Ulm area, and 
I am sure all the children pitch in and 
help with chores. 
We look forward to warmly wel-
coming Representative FINSTAD and his 
family to Congress. 
Madam Speaker, I now yield to the 
gentleman 
from 
Minnesota 
(Mr. 
EMMER), my colleague. 
Mr. EMMER. Madam Speaker, we 
come together to honor a friend and 
colleague who we lost earlier this year, 
and to welcome a new Member into the 
House of Representatives, our friend, 
Mr. BRAD FINSTAD. 
Six months have passed since we lost 
our friend Jim Hagedorn to cancer, and 
his absence continues to be felt in this 
Chamber 
and 
throughout 
southern 
Minnesota. Our thoughts remain with 
his family, as we all know how signifi-
cant a loss it has been for them and for 
all of us. 
Earlier this week, however, the resi-
dents of Minnesota’s First Congres-
sional District elected BRAD FINSTAD 
to carry out Congressman Hagedorn’s 
legacy of relentless representation in 
the House of Representatives. They 
could not have made a better choice. 
As a fourth generation Minnesotan, 
BRAD truly represents the best values 
of our State. Honesty, integrity, and 
the willingness to answer the call to 
serve. Born and raised on his family 
farm in New Ulm, Minnesota, BRAD 
grew up understanding the importance 
of a hard day’s work, a trade he still 
appreciates and carries with him every 
single day. 
After graduating from the University 
of Minnesota, his work on the family 
farm led BRAD to join the Minnesota 
Farm Bureau and eventually to serve 
three terms in the Minnesota House of 
Representatives. 
In 2017, BRAD was appointed by Presi-
dent Trump as the Director of Rural 
Development of USDA in the State of 
Minnesota. While there, he worked to 
improve the lives of farmers through-
out our home State. That earned him 
the respect and admiration of his com-
munity in southern Minnesota. 
Even through his successful election 
to the House of Representatives, BRAD, 
his wife, Jaclyn, and their seven chil-
dren, continued to operate the family 
farm in New Ulm. He and his wife met 
on a school bus in the second grade, 
and as a husband and father of seven, 
BRAD and Jackie have raised their chil-
dren on the values of faith, family, and 
hard work. 
On behalf of the entire Minnesota 
delegation, please join us in welcoming 
Representative BRAD FINSTAD, his wife, 
Jaclyn, and their seven wonderful chil-
dren to the United States Congress. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman from Minnesota (Mr. FINSTAD), 
our new Representative. 
Mr. FINSTAD. Madam Speaker, I 
thank Leader MCCARTHY, and the Min-
nesota delegation. 
Madam Speaker, it is an extraor-
dinary honor to be here and to be cho-
sen by my southern Minnesota friends, 
families, and neighbors to serve in this 
Congress. 
First, let’s take time to remember 
my predecessor, the late Congressman 
Hagedorn. He was a true fighter for 
southern Minnesota, and he was a 
great example of hard work and what 
we strive to be in Minnesota. 
I thank my wife, Jackie, and these 
hooligans up front, my seven kids. 
Thank you, guys. 
I thank my parents, my brother, sis-
ter-in-law—everyone, just thank you so 
much. We really couldn’t do this with-
out you, so I just appreciate you being 
here and the support and love that you 
have given us our entire lives. 
Madam Speaker, people in my dis-
trict sent a farmer to Congress. I tell 
people that when I wake up, I have dirt 
under my fingernails—sorry, Jackie. I 
don’t clean up that well. But I drive a 
John Deere tractor, and on the farm, 
when we wake up in the morning, we 
know something will be broke. So we 
wake up trying to figure out, How am 
I going to fix things? 
So really, to me, serving in Congress 
is all about that. Rolling up my 
sleeves, taking that farmer mentality, 
figuring what is broke, and how we are 
going to fix it, and move on. That is 
the farmer in me, and that is the 
southern Minnesotan in me, born and 
raised. That is the DNA that Jackie 
and I have had in our generations of 
families that have built a farm and ag-
ribusiness in south central Minnesota. 
We inherited the best country on 
Earth from the last generation. I think 
quite often of those that have given 
blood, sweat, and tears to give us the 
greatest country in the world. As I 
look at my seven children and the chil-
dren across southern Minnesota and 
across this country, I know that we can 
do better, and it is up to us to make 
sure that we are leaving them a better 
country than we have been left. 
Madam Speaker, with that attitude, 
with that work ethic, and with my 
compassion and hope to meet all of you 
and work with you, I just very humbly 
say thank you. I am ready to get to 
work.

REPORT 
ON 
RESOLUTION 
PRO-
VIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF 
SENATE 
AMENDMENT 
TO 
H.R. 
5376, BUILD BACK BETTER ACT 
Mr. MCGOVERN, from the Com-
mittee on Rules, submitted a privi-
leged report (Rept. No. 117–451) on the 
resolution (H. Res. 1316) providing for 
consideration of the Senate amend-
ment to the bill (H.R. 5376) to provide 
for reconciliation pursuant to title II 
of S. Con. Res 14, which was referred to 
the House Calendar and ordered to be 
printed. 
f 
PROVIDING 
FOR 
CONSIDERATION 
OF SENATE AMENDMENT TO H.R. 
5376, BUILD BACK BETTER ACT 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, by di-
rection of the Committee on Rules, I 
call up House Resolution 1316 and ask 
for its immediate consideration. 
The Clerk read the resolution, as fol-
lows: 
H. RES. 1316 
Resolved, That upon adoption of this reso-
lution it shall be in order to take from the 
Speaker’s table the bill (H.R. 5376) to provide 
for reconciliation pursuant to title II of S. 
Con. Res. 14, with the Senate amendment 
thereto, and to consider in the House, with-
out intervention of any point of order, a mo-
tion offered by the chair of the Committee 
on the Budget or his designee that the House 
concur in the Senate amendment. The Sen-
ate amendment and the motion shall be con-
sidered as read. The motion shall be debat-
able for three hours equally divided among 
and controlled by the respective chairs and 
ranking minority members of the Commit-
tees on the Budget, Energy and Commerce, 
and Ways and Means, or their respective des-
ignees. The previous question shall be con-
sidered as ordered on the motion to its adop-
tion without intervening motion. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from Massachusetts is recog-
nized for 1 hour. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, for 
the purpose of debate only, I yield the 
customary 30 minutes to the gen-
tleman from Texas (Mr. BURGESS), 
pending which I yield myself such time 
as I may consume. During consider-
ation of this resolution, all time yield-
ed is for the purpose of debate only. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
be given 5 legislative days to revise and 
extend their remarks. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Massachusetts? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, on 
Wednesday, the Rules Committee met 
and reported a rule, House Resolution 
1316. 
The rule provides for consideration of 
the Senate amendment to H.R. 5376, 
the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022. It 
makes in order a motion offered by the 
chair of the Committee on the Budget 
or his designee that the House concur 
in the Senate amendment to H.R. 5376. 
Finally, it provides 3 hours of debate 
on the motion equally divided among 
and controlled by the respective chairs 
and ranking minority members of the 
Committees on the Budget, Energy and 
Commerce, and Ways and Means, or 
their respective designees. 
Mr. Speaker, for too long too many 
people in this country have felt like 
the work that happens in Washington 
isn’t meant to help them. Like the peo-
ple who work in this city are not on 
their side. You know what? For a long 
time they have been right. For decades, 
corporate special interests and their 
out-of-touch friends in the Republican 
Party have blocked progress in Wash-
ington. They got what was good for the 
rich and powerful, not what was right 
for working families and the middle 
class. 
No more. That time is over. Presi-
dent Biden and Democrats are putting 
people over politics. We are fighting to 
create better jobs, safer communities, 
and a brighter future for our planet. 
This is a historic bill, Mr. Speaker, and 
at the end of the day it is not a com-
plicated vote. It all comes down to 
what your values are. 
Democrats have been fighting for 
years to lower drug prices, and this bill 
lets Medicare negotiate with drug com-
panies to lower the price of prescrip-
tion drugs. It caps the out-of-pocket 
cost of insulin at $35 for people on 
Medicare. It stops excessive price hikes 
on drugs and says, if you are on Medi-
care you won’t have to pay more than 
$2,000 a year for your prescriptions. 
Meanwhile, Republicans oppose this 
bill because it will cut into Big 
Pharma’s corporate profits. Boo-hoo. I 
mean, really? They oppose this bill be-
cause they want to let pharmaceutical 
companies 
continue 
price 
gouging. 
Give me a break. 
This bill listens to the climate ex-
perts who tell us that melting glaciers 
and record heat are not normal. It puts 
us on a path to cutting carbon emis-
sions 40 percent by 2030, helping create 
millions of new jobs along the way. 
This is a huge investment in energy se-
curity made in America by American 
workers that lowers energy costs for 
working families. It is the biggest in-
vestment in fighting climate change in 
history. Ever. This is a turning point in 
the fight to protect our planet. 
Republicans oppose this bill because 
they have never given a damn about 
pollution or climate change—they are 
more interested in protecting Big Oil’s 
bottom line. That is whose side they 
are on. 
Let’s look at healthcare costs. This 
bill cuts healthcare costs for millions 
of people by locking in lower Afford-
able Care Act premiums, saving people 
$800 a year on average. Republicans op-
pose it because they want insurance 
companies to make more money by rip-
ping people off. You can’t make this 
stuff up. 
Democrats want a tax code that is 
fair, where rich and powerful people 
pay what they owe, just like everyone 
else. Honest, hardworking middle-class 
families have to pay their fair share, 
but the top 1 percent dodge $160 billion 
in taxes each year. 
The Republican answer? They want 
to make it easier for the rich and pow-
erful to cheat. Whose side are they on? 
Mr. Speaker, this is historic. It is 
bold. Just so everyone understands, it 
lowers the deficit, and it is fully paid 
for with no new taxes on families mak-
ing $400,000 per year or less, and no new 
taxes on small businesses. Those who 
oppose this bill don’t want to talk 
about how it will help people. Instead, 
they are pushing total made-up BS. 
The money in this bill for the IRS 
isn’t going to result in increased audits 
on anyone making under $400,000 a 
year. Don’t take my word for it. 
Who appointed Charles Rettig, the 
current Commissioner of the IRS? 
Oh, it was Donald Trump. 
Charles Rettig, Trump’s appointee, 
says the money in this bill will go to-
wards better customer support, quicker 
turnaround times, so people can get 
long-overdue refunds, and enforcing tax 
laws against rich people cheating on 
their taxes. Don’t take it from me, 
take it from Trump’s own hand-picked 
IRS Commissioner. 
I get calls into my district office 
every day from people who are frus-
trated that their calls to the IRS go 
unanswered and their tax returns are 
late. This bill will help fix it. Look, 
here is the truth. This bill puts our 
government back on the side of work-
ing people in this country. 
Like I said earlier, this is about val-
ues: Democrats put people over poli-
tics. We are fighting to reduce infla-
tion for the people, lower the cost of 
healthcare 
and 
prescription 
drugs, 
make heating, cooling, and electricity 
bills cheaper, combat climate change 
with green energy, and lower the def-
icit. 
Let’s just tell the truth. Republicans 
are cheering for inflation. Every day 
they come to this floor cheering for us 
to fail. In my opinion, they are cheer-
ing for this administration and this 
country to fail because they think it 
will help them politically. They don’t 
put people over politics. They put Big 
Pharma, oil CEOs, corporate tax evad-
ers, and greedy insurance companies 
over everything else. It is rotten, it is 
wrong, and it is hurting America. 
Enough with the cynicism. This is a 
great day for America. I am proud to 
be here. It is not very often we get to 
pass bills that are going to change the 
course of history for generations to 
come. I will sleep better tonight know-
ing that when we pass this bill we are 
putting people over politics to leave a 
better 
world 
for 
our 
kids 
and 
grandkids. This is a historic moment. 
Let’s get this bill passed and to the 
President’s desk. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my col-
leagues to support this rule, and I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. BURGESS. I thank the gen-
tleman 
from 
Massachusetts

MCGOVERN) for yielding me the cus-
tomary 30 minutes, and I yield myself 
such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, while I recognize we are 
engaged in a very, very partisan exer-
cise and a harsh partisan debate, I do 
want to acknowledge the loss from our 
congressional family of the Represent-
ative from Indiana (Mrs. WALORSKI). I 
so appreciated your presence at her fu-
neral yesterday. I know it was a dif-
ficult time for many of us. We also lost 
two of our congressional staffers, who, 
in many ways, are like family. Emma 
Thomson used to work in my office as 
my communications director. 
It has been a tough week, and now we 
end it with today’s rule providing for 
the consideration of a Senate amend-
ment to H.R. 5376, the so-called Infla-
tion Reduction Act. I say the so-called 
Inflation Reduction Act because you 
would almost need a degree in nano-
metrology, you would almost need a 
micrometer to be able to measure the 
amount of deficit reduction that is in-
cluded in this failed legislation that we 
have in front of us. 
In fact, this is the second time we 
have seen this legislative vehicle. The 
Democrats tried to push through a par-
tisan budget reconciliation. Now, what 
does that mean? 
That means that there is zero input 
from the Republican side of the aisle. 
Why is that important? 
You have a House and a Senate that 
are almost evenly divided. It is 50–50 in 
the Senate. They relied on the Vice 
President’s vote to get this across the 
finish line. As we heard this morning 
at the swearing-in of our new Member, 
you have a bare majority in the House 
of Representatives. 
So don’t try to tell people that this 
has been an exercise that is well 
thought out, that has come through 
the committees of jurisdiction where 
people have had input. No. No Repub-
lican has had any input into this trav-
esty that we have in front of us today. 
Mr. Speaker, I sit on the Budget 
Committee. We did not mark up a 
budget resolution for fiscal year 2022. 
Instead, what happened? 
The budget was deemed passed in a 
rule vote without any—zero—floor con-
sideration. 
This bill is a reconfigured Build Back 
Better Act that the House passed last 
October that didn’t really have the 
breath to rise up off the floor, but 
somehow Senators cut a deal—Demo-
cratic Senators cut a deal with them-
selves—and now we have it on the floor 
today. 
Mr. Speaker, I stress again, this bill 
had no Republican input, and it will 
have a negligible effect on inflation. 
President Biden has stated that this 
bill will reduce inflationary pressures. 
Oh, my God, just make stuff up. What 
do you mean, inflationary pressures? 
That is not the same thing as actu-
ally reducing inflation. In fact, when 
you look at the language of this bill, 
you will recognize that there are 
things started but they are only for a 
short period of time. In reality, we 
know that once something is started it 
never stops up here. If you remove the 
sunset provisions and assume all spend-
ing in this bill is going to be extended 
through the 10-year budget window, 
this bill actually spends $745 billion 
and adds $148 billion to the national 
debt. After Democrats pushed through 
a $1.9 trillion reconciliation package— 
and we all remember when that hap-
pened, February and March of 2021—bil-
lions of dollars more in spending is the 
last thing that American consumers 
need in the middle of record-high infla-
tion. 
To combat inflation, the Federal Re-
serve has had to raise interest rates. 
They were late in starting, they dis-
missed inflation, and they said it was 
transitory; it wasn’t really happening, 
a figment of your imagination. But 
since March they have raised interest 
rates by 2.25 percent, the fastest cumu-
lative rate hike in over 10 years. 
According to the Congressional Budg-
et Office—and we really haven’t heard 
from them much this Congress—but ac-
cording to the Congressional Budget 
Office, the increase in interest rates 
will cost taxpayers an extra $100 billion 
this year alone. 
Let me describe for you what is cost-
ing Americans so much. There are se-
vere negative impacts in implementing 
government drug price controls, which 
are included in this bill. However, what 
most people do not understand is the 
effect this reconciliation package will 
have on healthcare and doctor’s prac-
tices in America. 
At the end of this year, doctors are 
expecting a payment update in Medi-
care that is now calculated to be zero 
percent. Anywhere else in this town, a 
zero percent update is viewed as a pay 
cut because we have 8 to 9 percent in-
flation. Guess what? 
That same inflation affecting house-
hold budgets affects your budget run-
ning a medical practice. In addition to 
that, there is a 4.5 percent Medicare 
conversion factor, which is reduced, 
and the adoption of several changes to 
the evaluation and management of 
Current Procedural Terminology codes. 
The net effect is a big cut to the Na-
tion’s doctors. That is really where we 
should have been focusing some of our 
efforts. Instead, we tell our doctors and 
our nurses: You are our heroes. You got 
us through the coronavirus pandemic— 
the worst pandemic in 100 years. Thank 
you, heroes. Here is your pay cut. And 
the doctors go: Wait. What? 
b 0930 
Under this legislation, we will see 
changes to part B drug reimbursements 
that would lead to an average of a 40 
percent cut for healthcare providers. 
Yet, Wednesday during the Rules Com-
mittee hearing, I offered an amend-
ment with Dr. Murphy to actually fix 
this problem. I thought: Maybe this is 
just an oversight. Maybe they didn’t 
really mean to do this. 
Unfortunately, it was rejected in the 
Rules Committee by a party-line vote. 
The confluence of these cuts threat-
ens the sustainability of medical prac-
tices and will lead to physicians clos-
ing their doors. So let me be quite 
clear about that: A vote for this bill is 
a vote to close medical practices. 
To make matters worse, the pro-
viders who would be affected work in 
fields such as oncology, rheumatology, 
interventional pain management, he-
matology, internal medicine, and gas-
troenterology. I never thought I would 
be up here fighting to save specialty 
practices, especially oncology—com-
munity oncology—which focuses on the 
treatment of cancer. But as these prac-
tices close—and they will close—care 
will shift to hospitals. 
What happens when the care shifts to 
hospitals from the doctors’ offices? 
Oh, it goes up by a factor of about 66 
percent. So instead of saving money, 
we are actually costing money. 
Ultimately, the combined financial 
pressures will result in limited access 
to treatment for patients including 
those in rural areas. 
Following a major pandemic and a 
healthcare 
workforce 
shortage, 
we 
should be encouraging physicians to 
keep their practices open in order to 
have a more stable healthcare system 
that would benefit patients. But, in-
stead, we do exactly the opposite. 
If this bill is signed into law, millions 
of patients could die waiting—waiting 
for those new drugs and cures that will 
no longer be developed in their life-
time. The last bill signed into law by 
President Obama at the end of 2016 was 
the 21st Century Cures Act, something 
that our Committee, the Committee on 
Energy and Commerce, worked on, this 
House passed, everyone was proud of 
the 21st Century Cures Act. We wanted 
to deliver the 21st Century Cures Act 
to patients who had been long-suf-
fering, we wanted to get them there 
faster, and we wanted to get them 
there at lower cost. But now we are 
doing exactly the opposite. 
Millions of patients could die waiting 
for new drugs and new cures. I have 
heard directly from providers that po-
tentially millions of patients will be 
affected if doctors close their doors. 
This bill is anti-doctor and anti-pa-
tient, and we will, unfortunately, see 
those consequences after final passage. 
This reconciliation bill also includes 
numerous Green New Deal provisions: 
There is a tax on natural gas produc-
tion that will be passed on to con-
sumers. Make no mistake about it. It is 
going to make it harder and more ex-
pensive to heat homes, to buy gro-
ceries, and to farm the land. 
This bill establishes a Department of 
Energy loan guarantee at $250 billion 
to support greenhouse gas reduction 
projects. I have been here long enough 
that I remember Solyndra in the 
Obama administration. This was a 
failed investment that cost the Amer-
ican taxpayers $500 million. 
There is also an energy efficiency 
home appliance rebate program to 
allow wealthy Americans to update

their homes to the tune of $9 billion, 
and a $1 billion program to electrify 
garbage trucks and school busses. 
The bill includes $27 billion in a 
greenhouse gas reduction fund at the 
Environmental Protection Agency that 
will be a slush fund for greenhouse 
projects—$27 billion to the Environ-
mental Protection Agency with no 
guardrails and with no oversight and 
we just hope that they are going to fix 
problems. Good luck with that. 
It also reinstates the Superfund ex-
cise tax on crude oil and imported pe-
troleum, and this will result in an addi-
tional $11 billion tax burden on our oil 
and gas industry in the midst of 
record-high gas prices. It is a telling 
mental image that the President was 
forced to go hat in hand over to the 
Middle East, over to Saudi Arabia, and 
ask them to pump more oil. It is not as 
if we ran out here, but the President 
went over to Saudi Arabia hat in hand. 
And how embarrassing: they told him 
they actually weren’t able to produce 
any more than they were right now. 
Last but not least, this bill contains 
a $7,500 tax credit for electric vehicles 
that must be made with a certain per-
centage of minerals mined in the 
United States or countries with U.S. 
free trade agreements. Most of the 
minerals come from China and Russia. 
There is not a single electric vehicle 
currently on the market that complies 
with this provision, and the European 
Union recently warned that this may 
violate the World Trade Organization 
domestic content and local assembly 
rules. 
I could continue but let me highlight 
some of the tax increases that average 
Americans will face. 
This bill creates a 15 percent min-
imum book tax on companies, but it in-
cludes exclusions for Green New Deal 
tax credits. 
A fix to the carried interest loophole 
was axed in the Senate to buy one vote 
and replaced with a 1-year extension of 
the State and local SALT tax cap. This 
was done to appease one Senator. It 
was removed and replaced with a pass-
through loss limitation which will pro-
hibit passthroughs from claiming a cer-
tain amount of after loss. Democrats 
have chosen to protect individuals in 
high-tech States over Main Street busi-
nesses. 
There is also a 1 percent excise tax 
on stock buybacks which will harm re-
tirement investments. 
There are extensions of production 
tax credits for renewables—as if we 
haven’t subsidized them enough al-
ready. 
And $80 billion—$80 billion—for the 
Internal Revenue Service including 
87,000 new agents—new agents who will 
all be members of a Federal employees’ 
union, likely contribute to Democratic 
campaigns, but are not required to be 
CPAs. 
I mean, where in the world do you go 
to make stuff like this up? 
Oh, yes, the United States House of 
Representatives run by Democrats. 
This has a 600 percent IRS funding 
increase over last year and a doubling 
of the number of employees. 
Wouldn’t it be great to double the 
amount of employees in the FAA? 
How many people have recently been 
stuck trying to get from one place to 
another with air travel in this country? 
Instead we are expanding the IRS. 
Currently, the best accounting firms 
are struggling to hire CPAs. How is the 
IRS going to attract qualified individ-
uals? It will only create tax techni-
cians who could be injurious to citizens 
if not properly trained. 
Americans deserve better. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge opposition to the 
rule, and I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I feel as if I just walked 
into the Festivus celebration, the an-
nual airing of grievances. There is so 
much that needs to be responded to. 
Let me just say two things. 
On inflation, last week, five former 
Treasury Secretaries issued a state-
ment—five 
former 
Treasury 
Secre-
taries—urging us to pass this critical 
legislation to ‘‘help increase American 
competitiveness, address our climate 
crisis, lower costs for families, and 
fight inflation.’’ 
Larry Summers was among those 
former Treasury Secretaries who said 
that this bill helps fight inflation. My 
Republican colleagues love to cite Mr. 
Summers but it seems as though they 
only like to acknowledge his analysis 
when he agrees with the point that 
they are trying to make. 
Just on process, I just have to say 
this: Perhaps my friends are forgetting 
the extensive hearings and markups 
that we held during consideration of 
Build Back Better. The Energy and 
Commerce markup alone took 3 days. 
Almost every piece of the Inflation Re-
duction Act was included in some form 
in the original House bill. Of course, it 
is not identical. Unfortunately, we had 
to let the Senate work its will, too. Be-
lieve me, I wish we could send the 
House-passed bill straight to the Presi-
dent’s desk. But I don’t have the time 
to go through an exhaustive list. 
Let me just remind my colleagues of 
just a few of the many provisions that 
this body already considered through 
regular order. The ACA premium re-
duction, prescription drug pricing re-
form, clean energy tax credits, energy- 
efficiency 
rebates, 
funds 
to 
fight 
wildfires, rural energy programs, clean 
vehicle manufacturing, funds to reduce 
air pollution, drought assistance, and a 
lot, lot, lot more. 
Now, I understand that my col-
leagues don’t like this bill, but it has 
gone through regular order, and it is 
way past time that we send it to the 
President’s desk for his signature. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the 
distinguished gentlewoman from Cali-
fornia (Mrs. TORRES), who is a member 
of the House Rules Committee. 
Mrs. TORRES OF California. Mr. 
Speaker, I want to begin my comments 
by thanking President Biden for doing 
what he actually had said that he is 
going to do and delivering for the peo-
ple. I also thank our Vice President 
from California, Kamala Harris, for 
being courageous and splitting that 50/ 
50 Senate. I also recognize the leader-
ship of both Houses that have brought 
us to where we are today to consider a 
Senate amendment to H.R. 5376, the In-
flation Reduction Act, IRA, of 2022. 
This is a critical piece of legislation 
that will help reduce the Federal def-
icit 
and 
tackle 
inflation, 
lower 
healthcare and prescription drug costs, 
and address the climate crisis. The In-
flation Reduction Act will also help 
lower energy bills for working families 
all while changing the Tax Code to en-
sure—to ensure the corporations—you 
know, Mr. Speaker, the ones that can 
donate politically and be considered as 
if they were humans? 
If they are able to give money politi-
cally, then they should be able to also 
pay their own fair share of taxes, and 
the filthy rich should also pay their 
fair share. 
Many families are still struggling to 
make ends meet with the cost of goods 
on the rise, forcing many to choose be-
tween basic necessities like food and 
lifesaving medication to stay healthy. 
Let us not forget that we shut down 
our economy as a result of a massive 
world pandemic. Let us not forget that 
Russia, the bully, has declared war on 
their neighbor; and, yes, China con-
tinues to shut down many of their com-
munities 
as 
a 
result 
of 
high 
coronavirus infections. So inflation is 
high. 
It is disappointing to see that Amer-
ican families pay nearly twice as much 
for their prescription drugs in compari-
son to other developed countries. 
Why is that? 
Because we have been handcuffed be-
cause we are not able to negotiate fair 
pharmaceutical prices. I have even 
heard from my constituents that medi-
cation can be so expensive that in 
many cases they decide to reduce the 
recommended dosage and to decline 
medication altogether. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentlewoman has expired. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
the gentlewoman an additional 30 sec-
onds. 
Mrs. TORRES of California. This is 
unacceptable. The Inflation Reduction 
Act will allow Medicare to negotiate 
prescription drug prices with pharma-
ceutical companies. The cost to seniors 
per year will not exceed $2,000. It also 
caps insulin for them at $35 per month. 
This is a game changer for working 
class people, not only in my commu-
nity but across America. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge everyone to sup-
port this bill and to be proud to help 
American families move forward. 
Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 
minutes to the gentleman from Okla-
homa (Mr. COLE), who is the ranking 
member of the House Rules Com-
mittee.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H7564 
August 12, 2022 
Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, I thank my 
good friend from Texas for yielding. 
(Mr. COLE asked and was given per-
mission to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, it is worth 
asking why we are here at all right 
now, quite frankly. We face no emer-
gency. The government is not about to 
shut down. Nothing in this bill is actu-
ally going to take effect in the imme-
diate future. We are simply here be-
cause my friends on the other side 
want to create the illusion that they 
are doing something positive before the 
midterm election. 
I think they also fear that the Amer-
ican people will actually have a chance 
to look at this monstrosity over a 
month and their own Members would 
then have to go home and give a full 
accounting of what they have done 
here. Sadly, we are going to rush this 
through without appropriate consider-
ation. 
It is worth noting, Mr. Speaker, 180 
of our own Members-plus are not even 
here. They are not here because they 
have submitted a declaration because 
we are in a health emergency. 
What health emergency? 
We have vaccines, we have thera-
peutics, the airports are full of people. 
People are traveling pretty easily, but 
180 Members won’t be here—both par-
ties. Again, that is a sad commentary 
on the manner in which we are oper-
ating this House. 
This bill comes before us in a process 
that I can only describe as lousy. No 
committee of jurisdiction in either the 
Senate or the House has dealt with this 
bill as written. No House Member has 
had any meaningful input in this legis-
lation. The reality is this bill was ne-
gotiated in back rooms by two Sen-
ators and rammed through the Senate 
on a partisan vote. My friends have 
picked it up without changing it, with-
out considering it, and they are going 
to ram it through here today. That is a 
process that they ought to be embar-
rassed by. 
There are two reasons to oppose the 
legislation itself, Mr. Speaker. The 
first is simply because of what is in it. 
The Democrats are repeating the mis-
take they made last year. They are 
going to try and spend their way out of 
inflation—a novel approach. 
b 0945 
We see how well that worked when 
they rammed through the American 
Rescue Plan under reconciliation. It is 
going to work exactly the same way 
again. 
On top of that, we are going to try 
and tax our way out of recession. That 
is a novel, new economic idea: Raise 
taxes while you are in a recession, 
something other administrations of 
both parties have always rejected as a 
bad idea. But my friends, feverishly in-
tent upon action, are going to do it 
here. 
We are going to do one thing, and I 
guess that could start immediately. We 
are going to hire, as my friend from 
Texas suggested, 87,000 new IRS em-
ployees. Only my friends on the other 
side think that is a good idea. Nobody 
thinks 87,000 new IRS agents are going 
to do anything to help us with infla-
tion, or help us with the problems that 
we have in energy, or help us in any 
meaningful way improve the economy 
or the lives of the average American. 
What is not in this bill is another 
reason to vote against it. It does noth-
ing to deal with inflation. Indeed, dur-
ing the Rules Committee, we submitted 
a letter from 280 economists that said 
this is going to make it worse, not bet-
ter. 
They can rely on Mr. Summers. I will 
rely on the 280 economists from both 
parties and every point of view who 
said this is not going to work when it 
comes to inflation. There is nothing in 
this bill that is going to increase en-
ergy production in the United States, 
nothing at all. 
Finally, there is nothing meaningful, 
as my friend from Texas pointed out, 
that will actually reduce the deficit. 
That deficit doesn’t begin to come 
down until 7 years from now under this 
legislation. That assumes everything 
stays the same for 7 years. That is not 
going to happen. 
For those reasons, Mr. Speaker, we 
ought to reject this rule. We ought to 
submit this bill to the appropriate 
committees of jurisdiction in this 
House, allow them to do their work, 
and continue to negotiate with the 
Senate. There is no emergency. There 
is no hurry here. We don’t need to ram 
this through. 
For that reason, Mr. Speaker, I urge 
the rejection of the rule and the rejec-
tion of the underlying legislation. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise to oppose the rule 
to provide for consideration of the Sen-
ate amendment to H.R. 5376, the gross-
ly mis-named Inflation Reduction Act. 
Instead of actually doing something to 
address the current economic crisis, 
the bill is instead yet another partisan 
tax-and-spend bill. My friends on the 
other side of the aisle will tout the def-
icit reduction as good for reducing in-
flation—and that’s true. But the bill 
we are considering isn’t a serious at-
tempt at deficit reduction. Eighty per-
cent of the deficit reduction they claim 
in this bill doesn’t even show up for 
seven years. And the deficit reduction 
they claim is laughable when you con-
sider the one point nine trillion spend-
ing bill they put on American’s credit 
card just last year. Americans need re-
lief now. 
I shouldn’t be surprised but I am dis-
appointed at the Majority’s egregious 
surrender of the House’s institutional 
prerogatives. When you have a process 
that is this bad, you should expect bad 
results. And the process on this bill 
was about as bad as it gets. The bill be-
fore us was written behind closed doors 
with just two senators negotiating its 
provisions. No Member of the House 
had any input into the package, nor did 
any but a few senators. Nor have we 
been given an opportunity to amend 
this package when the Majority com-
pletely rewrote the original bill at the 
Rules Committee, when we first consid-
ered this on the floor in November of 
last year, or today since every Repub-
lican amendment to this package was 
blocked in the rule. Instead, the House 
is preparing to pass exactly what the 
Senate produced behind closed doors. 
At least the Senate had the luxury of a 
CBO score during its consideration. 
The House isn’t even afforded that. 
This is an embarrassment. 
The Majority pushed through a reck-
less one point nine trillion dollar rec-
onciliation bill last year, stubbornly 
insisting it would not lead to inflation, 
even though economists were warning 
us the exact opposite. Today, hard-
working American taxpayers are suf-
fering for their hubris. 
Instead of learning their lesson, the 
Majority is once again pushing another 
foolhardy 
tax-and-spend 
package 
through on partisan lines. They were 
wrong last year and they are wrong 
again this year. Unfortunately, it will 
be the average American who again 
pays the price in the form of more in-
flation, fewer jobs, slower growth, and 
a lower standard of living for every 
family in America. 
It is easy to see why when you think 
about the policies that are actually in-
cluded in this bill. A tax hike on cor-
porations that will inevitably pass 
their increased costs onto consumers. 
A six hundred percent increase in the 
budget of the IRS so they can hire an 
army of eighty-seven thousand new 
agents. Massive spending on Green New 
Deal priorities, including giving sub-
sidies on luxury electric vehicles to 
high-earning individuals. Policies like 
these are bad enough in good times, 
but raising taxes when we are in a re-
cession to give subsidies to the rich to 
buy 
luxury 
electric 
vehicles 
just 
doesn’t make any sense. 
But we should also talk about what is 
not in this bill. Despite the title, 
there’s nothing in this bill that will re-
duce inflation. There’s nothing in this 
bill that will address our current en-
ergy crisis, and in fact, the policies in 
here will make it worse. While my 
friends in the Majority are willing to 
pour tens of billions of dollars into 
Solyndra-style green energy programs, 
there is nothing in this bill that will 
lower the price of gasoline, nothing 
that will make it cheaper to heat and 
cool homes, and nothing that will en-
sure energy independence for America. 
The Majority could have chosen to 
prioritize these things but didn’t. 
Instead, the Majority is showing 
what their priorities truly are. An 
army of new IRS agents to harass tax-
payers at all income levels. A massive 
and unaffordable tax increase that will 
make the recession worse. Massive new 
spending programs on the Green New 
Deal. Subsidies for high-income folks 
to buy luxury electric vehicles. It all 
adds up to a bad deal for taxpayers, a 
bad deal for the economy, and a bad 
deal for the nation.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H7565 
August 12, 2022 
Mr. Speaker, at the end of the day, 
this bill will make inflation worse, not 
better, and will make the recession 
longer and deeper. We should not make 
the exact same error the Majority 
made last year in passing yet another 
tax and spend boondoggle. We cannot 
tax and spend our way out of a reces-
sion, and we cannot tax and spend our 
way into lower inflation. The nation 
has already suffered enough after last 
year’s reconciliation bill. Doing so all 
over again will only make this suf-
fering worse. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
With all due respect, my friend asked 
why we are here in August and what is 
the emergency. Well, the Inflation Re-
duction Act actually addresses an 
emergency that a lot of families are 
faced with right now. 
Rising grocery costs, rising fuel 
costs, those things are emergencies, 
maybe not to people on the other side 
of the aisle here, but they are to a lot 
of families in my district and across 
the country. Rising prescription drug 
prices are an emergency. 
If that is not enough, addressing the 
issue of the climate crisis. I mean, the 
front page of The Washington Post: 
‘‘As U.S. prepares for climate action, 
planet isn’t waiting around.’’ The plan-
et is, literally, on fire, and we are actu-
ally addressing that in a meaningful 
way with this bill, the biggest invest-
ment ever to combat the climate crisis. 
Now, that is an emergency. 
You should talk to young people in 
your district who have been fighting 
passionately to try to get Congress to 
finally address this issue. Talk to your 
farmers in your district. They will tell 
you that climate change is real. 
Maybe my friends would rather be on 
vacation, but we are here, in August, to 
do something meaningful for the Amer-
ican people and for this planet. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the 
gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. 
AUCHINCLOSS). 
Mr. AUCHINCLOSS. Mr. Speaker, the 
Inflation Reduction Act represents the 
biggest climate action in history and 
rightfully boosts offshore wind produc-
tion to meet our renewable energy 
goals. 
First, the bill provides a $10 billion 
investment tax credit for clean energy 
manufacturing facilities. This will ben-
efit wind turbine manufacturers, pro-
pelling a nascent industry that will 
create jobs and clean energy both in 
Massachusetts and across the country. 
Further, the bill provides additional 
tax support to manufacturing projects 
located in energy communities, includ-
ing those that previously housed coal 
power plants, like Brayton Point in my 
district. Offshore wind farms that con-
nect to wholesale electric grids in such 
communities should be eligible for this 
additional support, as well, to maxi-
mize these credits’ impact. 
The Inflation Reduction Act is a gen-
erational step forward in taking on Big 
Oil and Gas and driving our Nation to-
ward a clean energy future. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge the House to join 
me in passing this bill. 
Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 
minutes to the gentlewoman from Min-
nesota (Mrs. FISCHBACH), a fellow mem-
ber of the House Committee on Rules. 
Mrs. FISCHBACH. Mr. Speaker, I 
just wanted to comment that I do talk 
to farmers, and what farmers are talk-
ing to me about is the incredible costs 
of their inputs this year. That is what 
they are talking about. 
They are not coming to me about cli-
mate change. They are coming to me 
about the cost it is for them to do busi-
ness and the inflation they are facing. 
Last year, my Democrat colleagues 
sling-shotted us into record inflation 
with trillions in reckless spending. 
Now, they have the audacity to use 
that very crisis to justify doing it 
again. 
They call this bill the Inflation Re-
duction Act. In reality, this is just an-
other installation of their tax-and- 
spend agenda that got us here in the 
first place. 
This time, they are spending $80 bil-
lion in funding to send 87,000 new IRS 
agents to shake loose change from 
Americans to pay for their spending 
spree. With this new staff, the IRS will 
be bigger than the Pentagon, State De-
partment, FBI, and Border Patrol. 
This new IRS army will increase au-
dits on individuals by more than 1.2 
million, nearly half of which will be on 
Americans making $75,000 per year or 
less. You don’t have to take my word 
for it. This is according to the non-
partisan Congressional Budget Office. 
What do Americans get in return? $3 
billion in grants to promote climate 
justice; $7.5 billion for wealthy families 
to purchase their next Tesla; $1.3 bil-
lion for those same families to boost 
the sale value of their old Tesla; and $1 
billion for electric garbage trucks. 
This bill is riddled with provisions 
that carry the Green New Deal stamp 
of approval. 
This bill is not designed to help the 
country recover. It is not going to help 
American families pay for groceries. It 
is not designed to help American fami-
lies. It is designed to send an army of 
IRS agents after low- and middle-in-
come Americans so Democrats can pay 
for their Green New Deal. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
1 minute to the gentleman from Penn-
sylvania (Mr. LAMB). 
Mr. LAMB. Mr. Speaker, if you were 
in western Pennsylvania for the 2020 
campaign season, you would have seen 
a lot of commercials about what Re-
publicans were going to do on the issue 
of energy and for energy workers and 
what Democrats were going to do. The 
contention was that Republicans were 
going to make us energy dominant, 
that they were going to help all these 
workers and give them more job oppor-
tunities, and that the Democrats were 
going to take all that away. 
So here today, we have a bill that is 
all about energy dominance and energy 
jobs. If you build pipelines, this bill is 
for you because of the increased money 
for carbon capture and hydrogen. 
If you make the steel tube that goes 
into those pipelines, if you work at a 
nuclear power plant, or if you build 
things for the nuclear power plant, this 
bill is for all of you. It strengthens and 
widens our energy portfolio and gives 
us more options at a better price. 
Yet, today’s bill is not a Republican 
bill. It is a Democratic bill. I wish it 
wasn’t only a Democratic bill, but it 
will be because when it comes to the 
needs of these workers and the true 
need for our country to be energy se-
cure, we are the ones doing the job. 
Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentleman from Penn-
sylvania 
(Mr. 
RESCHENTHALER), 
an-
other valuable member of the House 
Committee on Rules. 
Mr. RESCHENTHALER. Mr. Speak-
er, I thank my good friend and fellow 
Rules Committee member for the time. 
Mr. Speaker, 61 percent of Americans 
are living paycheck to paycheck, yet 
here we are today, considering another 
reckless tax-and-spend bill that dou-
bles down on the same failed economic 
policies that brought us to the current 
situation in the first place. 
Under Democrats’ one-party rule, in-
flation has increased nearly 550 per-
cent. Let me repeat that. Inflation has 
increased nearly 550 percent. 
Americans are spending over $2,000 
more a year on gas. Our economy, de-
spite the new definition, is actually in 
a recession. 
Despite what the majority claims, 
this bill will do nothing to reduce the 
record-high inflation that is forcing 
Americans to pay more for just about 
everything. 
But just don’t take my word for it. 
Analysis from the Wharton School 
found this bill will actually increase 
inflation through 2024. This bill will 
also increase taxes on individuals earn-
ing under $400,000 a year while fun-
neling taxpayer dollars to the wealthi-
est Americans. 
Under this bill, coastal elites, mem-
bers from the ruling class, will receive 
$7,500 to buy electric vehicles while ev-
eryday Americans will have to pay 
more at the pump thanks to $12 billion 
in taxes on American energy producers. 
Unsurprisingly, this legislation is 
stuffed full of socialist Big Government 
handouts, including more than $400 bil-
lion for the radical, dangerous Green 
New Deal policies. 
It also provides the IRS with $80 bil-
lion for 87,000 new agents to apparently 
audit just 700 billionaires. The IRS 
doesn’t need 87,000 agents to audit the 
rich; they need 87,000 agents to harass 
the working class and pay for their far- 
left handouts. 
Ultimately, this bill will push our 
Nation deeper into recession and make 
life even more unaffordable for Amer-
ican families. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
oppose this rule. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I in-
clude in the RECORD a New York Times

THE I.R.S. SAYS NEW FUNDING WON’T MEAN 
MORE AUDITS FOR MIDDLE-INCOME AMERICANS 
(By Alan Rappeport) 
WASHINGTON.—Charles P. Rettig, the Inter-
nal Revenue Service commissioner, told Con-
gress on Thursday that the tax collection 
agency would not increase audits of house-
holds earning less than $400,000 if it was 
given the additional $80 billion that law-
makers were considering in a proposed cli-
mate and tax legislation package. 
Providing more funding for the I.R.S. has 
been a top priority of the Biden administra-
tion and has emerged as key way to finance 
some of the policies that Democrats are pro-
posing without raising individual tax rates. 
The additional funding is expected to go to-
ward hiring more enforcement agents to 
crack down on wealthy tax evaders and cor-
porations and to modernize the agency’s an-
tiquated technology. 
‘‘These resources are absolutely not about 
increasing audit scrutiny on small busi-
nesses or middle-income Americans,’’ Mr. 
Retting wrote in a letter to lawmakers. ‘‘As 
we have been planning, our investment of 
these enforcement resources is designed 
around Treasury’s directive that audit rates 
will not rise relative to recent years for 
households making under $400,000.’’ 
That commitment is in keeping with Presi-
dent Biden’s promise not to raise taxes on 
middle-income Americans. 
Mr. Rettig added that better technology 
and customer service at the I.R.S. would 
make honest taxpayers less likely to be au-
dited. 
The I.R.S. funding is projected to raise $124 
billion in additional tax revenue over a dec-
ade. Treasury Department officials believe 
that this estimate is overly conservative and 
that an agency with more robust audit abili-
ties will deter tax cheats. 
Democrats are expected to consider the ad-
ditional funding as part of a new package, 
the Inflation Reduction Act, which includes 
raising taxes on corporations and lowering 
prescription drug costs, among other provi-
sions. The overall package has garnered stiff 
opposition from Republicans and would need 
every Senate Democrat to support it in order 
to pass. 
Among the provisions that Republicans op-
pose is the I.R.S. funding. Republicans have 
a long history of trying to starve the I.R.S. 
of funds and have complained for years that 
it is being used as a political weapon and un-
fairly targets conservative groups. 
The agency’s scrutiny has crossed party 
lines, according to the I.R.S. inspector gen-
eral. But it came under fire again last month 
after The New York Times reported that 
James B. Comey, the former F.B.I. director, 
and his deputy, Andrew G. McCabe—both 
perceived enemies of former President Don-
ald J. Trump—faced rare, exhaustive audits 
during the Trump administration. The I.R.S. 
said Mr. Rettig had not been involved in the 
audits. 
In assailing the proposed legislation, the 
Republican National Committee claimed this 
week that an ‘‘army’’ of 87,000 I.R.S. agents 
would 
‘‘disproportionately 
target 
poorer 
Americans.’’ 
Mr. Rettig, whose term expires later this 
year, insisted on Thursday that those sug-
gestions were unfounded. 
‘‘Large corporate and high-net-worth tax-
payers often engage teams of sophisticated 
representatives pursuing unsettled or some-
times questionable interpretations of tax 
law,’’ he said. ‘‘The integrity and fairness of 
our tax administrative system relies upon 
the ability of our agency to maintain a 
strong, visible, robust enforcement presence 
directed to these and other similarly situ-
ated noncompliant taxpayers.’’

IRS PLANS TO HIRE 10,000 WORKERS TO 
RELIEVE MASSIVE BACKLOG 
(By Fatima Hussein) 
WASHINGTON (AP).—The IRS said Thursday 
it plans to hire 10,000 new workers to help re-
duce a massive backlog that the government 
says will make this tax season the most 
challenging in history. 
The agency released a plan to work down 
the tens of millions of filings that includes 
speeding up the traditionally slow hiring 
process, relying more on automated proc-
esses and bringing on more contract workers 
to help with mailroom and paper processing. 
Getting it done will be the big challenge, tax 
experts say. 
The agency faces a backlog of around 20 
million pieces of correspondence, which is 
more than 15 times as large as in a normal 
filing season, according to the agency. And 
the IRS workforce is the same size it was in 
1970, though the U.S. population has grown 
exponentially and the U.S. tax code has be-
come increasingly complicated. 
Additionally, the need to administer pan-
demic-related programs has imposed an en-
tirely new workload on the agency. 
White House officials have said the agency 
is not equipped to serve taxpayers even in 
nonpandemic years. A senior administration 
official, speaking on condition of anonymity 
Thursday to preview the new IRS plan, said 
processing returns will continue to be a mas-
sive challenge so long as the agency operates 
on 1960s infrastructure. 
The IRS’ latest plan to combat the current 
backlog includes creating a 700–person surge 
team to process new returns, adding 2,000 
contractors to respond to taxpayer questions 
about stimulus and child tax credit pay-
ments and developing new automated voice 
and chat bots to answer taxpayer questions. 
There is no plan to extend the current 
April 18 filing deadline, the senior official 
said. The new IRS plan comes as lawmakers 
have made persistent calls for additional fed-
eral funding for the agency. 
Congress’ mammoth $1.5 trillion omnibus 
package, released early Wednesday, would 
provide $14.3 billion to the Treasury Depart-
ment, including $12.6 billion devoted to the 
IRS. That would be the largest funding in-
crease for the tax agency since 2001. 
However, Republicans have questioned the 
need for additional funding. Florida Sen. 
Rick Scott’s ‘‘11 Point Plan to Rescue Amer-
ica,’’ unveiled in February, proposes a 50% 
cut in funding and workforce at the IRS. 
The White House and Senate Minority 
Leader Mitch McConnell have roundly re-
jected Scott’s idea. 
Caroline Bruckner, a tax professor at the 
American University Kogod School of Busi-
ness, said the agency is ‘‘at a competitive 
disadvantage’’ for finding new staff based on 
its reputation for employees being wholly 
overworked. She said she based this on her 
own survey of tax students she teaches. 
Bruckner said, ‘‘It’s absurd we have put so 
much work on the IRS’’ without giving it the 
necessary resources to help Americans in the 
way that is expected. 
Bruckner says along with increased fund-
ing, the IRS also ‘‘really has to change its 
narrative and the way it talks about its mis-
sion to one of service and being one of the 
most important antipoverty systems that we 
have in the U.S.’’

TRUMP ALLIES ARE ATTACKING BIDEN FOR A 
PLAN TO HIRE 87,000 NEW IRS AGENTS THAT 
DOESN’T EXIST 
(By Eric Cortellessa) 
Since news broke on Monday that the FBI 
searched former President Donald Trump’s 
South Florida home, Republican members of 
Congress and right-wing media figures have 
launched a new line of attack against Demo-
crats: that the Internal Revenue Service in-
tends to use nearly $80 billion in new funding 
to pursue similar intrusions on average 
Americans. Those dollars, Trump allies are 
saying, will go toward the hiring of 87,000 
new IRS agents. 
‘‘Do you make $75,000 or less?’’ tweeted 
House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy. 
‘‘Democrats’’ new army of 87,000 IRS agents 
will be coming for you—with 710,000 new au-
dits for Americans who earn less than $75k.’’ 
Richard Grenell, Trump’s former Acting Di-
rector of National Intelligence, wrote on the 
social media platform: ‘‘The FBI raids 
Trump’s house and the Democrats vote to 
add 87,000 new IRS agents to go after Ameri-
cans. Wake up, America.’’ 
Other high-profile conservatives have in-
sinuated that the Biden administration in-
tends to direct those additional auditors to 
dig up dirt on the President’s political oppo-
nents. ‘‘After todays raid on Mar A Lago 
what do you think the left plans to use those 
87,000 new IRS agents for?’’ tweeted Sen. 
Marco Rubio. 
It’s a notion that has taken off like wild-
fire, signaling what is likely to be a promi-
nent broadside from Republicans against 
Democrats in the midterm elections. 
There’s only one problem. It’s not true. 
The Inflation Reduction Act, a landmark 
climate, health care and tax package that 
passed the Senate on Sunday and is expected 
to head to Biden’s desk after the House ap-
proves it on Friday, includes roughly $78 bil-
lion for the IRS to be phased in over 1O 
years. A Treasury Department report from 
May 2021 estimated that such an investment 
would enable the agency to hire roughly 
87,000 employees by 2031. But most of those 
hires would not be Internal Revenue agents, 
and wouldn’t be new positions. 
According to a Treasury Department offi-
cial, the funds would cover a wide range of 
positions including IT technicians and tax-
payer services support staff, as well as expe-
rienced auditors who would be largely tasked 
with cracking down on corporate and high- 
income tax evaders. ‘‘It is wholly inaccurate 
to describe any of these resources as being 
about increasing audit scrutiny of the mid-
dle class or small businesses,’’ Natasha 
Sarin, a counselor for tax policy and imple-
mentation at the Treasury Department, tells 
TIME. 
At the same time, more than half of the 
agency’s current employees are eligible for 
retirement and are expected to leave the 
agency within the next five years. ‘‘There’s a 
big wave of attrition that’s coming and a lot 
of these resources are just about filling those 
positions,’’ says Sarin, an economist who has 
studied tax avoidance extensively and who 
was tapped by the Biden administration to 
beef up the IRS’s auditing power. 
In all, the IRS might net roughly 20,000 to 
30,000 more employees from the new funding, 
enough to restore the tax-collecting agency’s 
staff to where it was roughly a decade ago. 
The IRS currently has roughly 78,000 em-
ployees. According to John Koskinen, who 
served as IRS commissioner from 2013 to 
2017, that’s down from around 100,000 when he

first started. By the time he resigned four 
years later, he said, it was clear that the 
agency was in the grip of a systematic at-
tempt by the GOP to weaken it. 
‘‘Nobody loves tax collectors,’’ Koskinen 
tells TIME. 
It’s an effort that goes back to 2010, when 
Republicans took back control of the House 
of Representatives and immediately insti-
tuted a series of crippling cuts on the IRS. 
Since then, overall funding for the IRS has 
fallen further, by more than 20 percent, 
while enforcement funding has dropped by 31 
percent. That’s made it easier for high-net- 
worth tax cheats and major corporations to 
avoid federal taxes to the tune of billions of 
dollars. 
‘‘The largest corporations in the United 
States with over $20 billion of assets have 
had their rate of audits go from nearly 100% 
to 50%,’’ says Janet Holtzblattt, a senior fel-
low at the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Cen-
ter. ‘‘Among wealthy individuals who had a 
positive income of a million dollars or more, 
the audit rate fell from 8.4% in 2010 to 2.4% 
in 2019.’’ 
Meanwhile, the employee shortage only 
made it harder for average Americans to 
reach IRS customer support, which has been 
inundated with requests far beyond what the 
staff could handle. ‘‘I used to say there’s no 
Democratic or Republican way to run the 
IRS,’’ Koskinen says. ‘‘The people who are 
significantly disadvantaged are the average 
taxpayers who have a simple question and 
can’t get through. Those are Republicans as 
well as independents and Democrats.’’ As of 
last month, the IRS backlog included 10.2 
million unprocessed individual returns. 
Funding from the Inflation Reduction Act 
will also go toward tech modernization. The 
IRS currently uses technology from the 
1960s, called COBOL, to process and intake 
individual tax returns. According to govern-
ment officials, the agency has struggled to 
find workers who are still equipped to code 
under the antiquated system. 
The increased funding for the IRS is a key 
part of Democrats’ plan to pay for the Infla-
tion Reduction Act. By going more forcefully 
after tax cheats and increasing compliance, 
the Congressional Budget Office estimates 
the agency will increase revenue by $204 bil-
lion over the next decade. 
Yet while the IRS may be in desperate 
need of more funding, it’s not exactly most 
Americans’ favorite government institution. 
Nobody likes to fork over a big check to 
Uncle Sam. Which is a big reason why Re-
publicans are likely to keep hammering this 
point in the coming months, and potentially 
pointing to 87,000 new IRS agents who will 
never materialize. 
‘‘I think a lot of people are going to be 
upset by this across the country and across 
the 
political 
spectrum,’’ 
Hogan 
Gidley, 
Trump’s former White House deputy press 
secretary, tells TIME, when asked about IRS 
funding. He falsely described the Biden ad-
ministration’s plan as hiring ‘‘85,000 IRS 
agents to come after mom-and-pop busi-
nesses.’’ 
But if Gidley’s right, Americans will only 
be angry because of what Republicans are 
telling them about the IRS—not what’s actu-
ally happening there.

FOR OLDER AMERICANS, HEALTH BILL WILL 
BRING SAVINGS AND ‘PEACE OF MIND’ 
(By Sheryl Gay Stolberg and Noah Weiland) 
WASHINGTON.—After Pete Spring was diag-
nosed with dementia in 2016, he and his wife 
emptied their checking account in part to 
pay for his prescription drugs, then ran 
through $60,000 in pension payments before 
resorting to a charge card to help make sure 
Mr. Spring had the heart and Alzheimer’s 
medications he needed to survive—just two 
of the 11 drugs he took. Mr. Spring, of Mari-
etta, Ga., died in April, before the unveiling 
of the tax, climate and health bill that the 
Senate passed over the weekend. The meas-
ure aims to lower the cost of prescription 
drugs for people on Medicare, like him; his 
wife, Gretchen Van Zile, has been left to 
look back on what felt like an outrageous in-
justice. 
‘‘Here seniors are in their golden years,’’ 
said Ms. Van Zile, 74, ‘‘and the only people 
seeing gold are the pharmaceutical compa-
nies.’’ 
Nearly 49 million people, most of them 
older Americans, get prescription drug cov-
erage through Medicare, yet many find that 
it does not go very far. Low-income people 
quality for government subsidies, so those in 
the middle class—people like Mr. Spring and 
Ms. Van Zile—are hit hardest by high drug 
costs. 
The Senate bill, which the House is ex-
pected to pass on Friday, then send to Presi-
dent Biden’s desk, could save many Medicare 
beneficiaries hundreds, if not thousands of 
dollars a year. Its best-known provision 
would empower Medicare to negotiate prices 
with drug makers with the goal of driving 
down costs—a move the pharmaceutical in-
dustry has fought for years, and one that ex-
perts said would help lower costs for bene-
ficiaries. 
But the legislation would also take more 
direct steps to keep money in people’s pock-
etbooks, though they would be phased in 
over time. 
Beginning next year, insulin co-payments 
for Medicare recipients would be capped at 
$35 a month. As of 2024, those with costs high 
enough to qualify for the program’s ‘‘cata-
strophic coverage’’ benefit would no longer 
have to pick up 5 percent of the cost of every 
prescription. And starting in 2025, out-of- 
pocket 
costs 
for 
prescription 
medicines 
would be capped at $2,000 annually. 
‘‘This is a huge policy change and one that 
has been a long time coming,’’ said Dr. 
Stacie Dusetzina, an associate professor of 
health policy at Vanderbilt University. ‘‘For 
people needing high-cost drugs, this will pro-
vide significant financial relief.’’ 
Between 2009 and 2018, the average price 
more than doubled for brand-name prescrip-
tion drugs in Medicare Part D, the program 
that covers products dispensed by phar-
macies, the Congressional Budget Office 
found. Between 2019 and 2020, price increases 
outpaced inflation for half of all drugs cov-
ered by Medicare, according to an analysis 
from the Kaiser Family Foundation. 
Perhaps no drug has been talked about as 
much as insulin, the diabetes medication 
that is more than 100 years old. Prices for in-
sulin and its analogues have risen so fast 
that many diabetes patients who rely on the 
drug put themselves at risk by taking less 
than is prescribed to cut costs. 
More than three million Medicare bene-
ficiaries take one of the 42 different types of 
insulin that are covered by Medicare, accord-
ing to an estimate by the Kaiser Family 
Foundation, which found that the average 
out-of-pocket cost is $54 a month. But for 
some people, the costs are much higher. 
Evelyn Polay, 82, of Merrick, N.Y., spends 
more than $1,200 every three months on four 
different 
diabetes 
medicines, 
including 
Humalog and another type of injectable insu-
lin, which she has been taking for about 30 
years. 
She still works as a part-time bookkeeper 
and counts herself as fortunate. ‘‘It’s not a 
question of do I eat or do I take my medi-
cine,’’ she said. 
But she worries about other people, includ-
ing her own grandchildren, three of whom 
also have diabetes. Democrats tried to apply 
the bill’s proposed $35 co-payment to all in-
sulin prescriptions, including those covered 
by private insurers. But Republican senators 
forced the removal of that language—even 
though seven of them wanted to keep it in 
the bill. To hear the voices of older Ameri-
cans who confront high drug costs month in 
and month out is to hear fear and worry, 
anger and stress. Many say they are figuring 
out how to get by, skipping vacations and 
other niceties for which they saved. 
For Kim Armbruster, 65, who recently re-
tired after a 40-year nursing career, keeping 
down the costs of her medications for diabe-
tes, psoriatic arthritis and Graves’ disease, 
an autoimmune disorder affecting the thy-
roid, has been a scramble since she started 
on Medicare in March. Ms. Armbruster, of 
Cary, Ill., said she had saved extra insulin 
from prescriptions filled when she had com-
mercial insurance, enough to keep costs 
down before a monthly cap kicks in. But her 
other conditions have caused immense finan-
cial strain. 
By June, she had reached Medicare’s 
threshold for catastrophic coverage after 
paying more than $7,000 for Enbrel, a drug 
she takes for the arthritis; Synthroid, which 
she takes for Graves’ disease; Eliquis, for 
atrial fibrillation, insulin and her insulin 
pump. 
‘‘It’s all about thinking ahead, looking for 
alternatives and strategizing the home budg-
et to be able to take the necessary meds,’’ 
she said. Learning to keep up with costs, she 
added, had been like ‘‘baptism by fire, to 
learn everything I can possibly learn about 
it to maneuver drug costs and stay healthy 
without complications.’’ 
The carousel of medications taken by Mr. 
Spring, the dementia patient who died in 
April, included eye-popping price tags for 
drugs including Eliquis, for a heart condi-
tion, and Namenda, an Alzheimer’s drug. Mr. 
Spring also took an antidepressant and 
medications to dull the side effects from 
Namenda. 
Those drugs ran the couple around $1,000 a 
month. Had the $2,000 annual out-of-pocket 
cap been in place when her husband was 
alive, Ms. Van Zile said, they would have 
reached it by March every year. Ms. Van Zile 
retired from her job working for Fulton 
County in Georgia so that she could take 
care of her husband, further cramping their 
savings. ‘‘His sense of humor put a smile on 
my face every day,’’ she said. ‘‘The bitter as-
pect of it was the financial stress.’’ 
Democrats have been promising for years 
to lower the cost of prescription drugs. So 
have some Republicans, including former 
President Donald J. Trump. But the Senate 
bill passed along party lines, without any 
Republican votes. In the 50–50 Senate, Vice 
President Kamala Harris broke the tie vote. 
Republicans, and the pharmaceutical in-
dustry, insist that the measure will stifle in-
novation and reverse progress on therapies 
and treatments, including those for cancer 
care—a high priority for Mr. Biden. The in-
dustry’s main trade group, PhRMA, says the 
bill, which imposes stiff penalties on compa-
nies that refuse to negotiate, amounts to 
government price setting—not negotiation. 
At a media briefing last month, Stephen J. 
Ubl, the chief executive of PhRMA, warned 
that Democrats were ‘‘about to make a his-
toric mistake that will devastate patients 
desperate for new cures.’’ 
But backers of the measure say new treat-
ments are meaningless if patients can’t af-
ford them. The promise of Medicare, enacted 
in 1965, has always been that it would take 
care of older Americans. The prescription 
drug benefit was not added until 2003. 
It includes the provision for catastrophic

spends $7,050 a year out of pocket. The Kaiser 
Family Foundation says that 1.3 million 
Medicare beneficiaries hit the catastrophic 
threshold each year; 1.4 million have out-of- 
pocket costs of $2,000 or more. 
‘‘You rarely hear people complain about 
turning age 65 and going on Medicare; it’s 
often a relief,’’ said Larry Levitt, the foun-
dation’s executive vice president for health 
policy. ‘‘But the way Medicare now works, 
there can be some nasty surprises for people 
with very high drug expenses, and this bill 
will provide a lot of relief.’’ 
A study conducted by Dr. Dusetzina high-
lighted how the middle class gets squeezed. 
She examined 17,076 new prescriptions issued 
between 2012 and 2018 for Part D bene-
ficiaries, and found that those receiving sub-
sidies were nearly twice as likely to obtain 
the prescribed drug within 90 days as those 
without subsidies. 
Among those who did not qualify for sub-
sidies, 30 percent of all prescriptions for can-
cer drugs went unfilled, as did more than 50 
percent of prescriptions to treat immune 
system disorders or high cholesterol. 
Patti Kellerhouse, a 64–year-old in Hender-
son, Nev., was diagnosed with metastatic 
breast cancer in 2017 that had spread to her 
liver. On long-term disability through her 
employer, she had paid $10 a month out of 
pocket for the oral cancer treatment she 
needed. But when she transitioned to a Medi-
care Advantage plan, the medication cost 
more than $3,100 for the first month. 
While she has been able to afford the price 
jump, it has stressed her financial planning. 
She is saving money for a new car, among 
other things. She said she has daughters and 
grandchildren whom she would like to con-
tinue supporting. 
‘‘I worked hard my whole life,’’ she said. 
‘‘These 
are 
high 
co-payments. 
They 
shouldn’t happen when you’re at retirement 
age.’’ 
Many 
Americans 
make 
tough 
choices 
about whether to continue taking drugs they 
need. Bob Miller, a 71 year-old multiple scle-
rosis patient in Prior Lake, Minn., is among 
them. 
Every other day for 12 years, Mr. Miller 
took Betaseron, a brand-name prescription 
drug that can delay the progression of his 
disease by staving off flare-ups of numbness, 
muscle stiffness and other symptoms that 
can leave patients worse off than they were 
before. But the drug was expensive; even 
with his Medicare insurance, it cost more 
than $10,000 a year. 
So he quit taking the drug in 2016 after 
consulting with his doctors, who told him he 
could ‘‘roll the dice’’ and survive without 
it—at least for the time being. Since then, he 
has lived with the unsettling worry that he 
is gambling with his own health. 
‘‘In the background, you don’t know what’s 
going on,’’ Mr. Miller said. ’There might still 
be some damage being done to my nerve fi-
bers.’’ 
When a neurologist recently told him it 
might help to go back on a disease-modi-
fying drug, Mr. Miller told him he would like 
to, if not for the prohibitive cost. The new 
legislation, he said, will deliver something 
he has been longing for: ‘‘Peace of mind.’’ 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, sen-
iors know that this bill will help bring 
down their healthcare and prescription 
drug costs dramatically. Passing this 
bill will be a huge sigh of relief for 34 
million Americans covered by Medi-
care. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the 
gentlewoman from Pennsylvania (Ms. 
SCANLON), a distinguished member of 
the Rules Committee. 
Ms. SCANLON. Mr. Speaker, the 
American people asked, and Democrats 
are delivering. 
I am proud to join my colleagues in 
moving this historic effort to fight cli-
mate change, lower prescription drug 
prices, and reduce the deficit. 
Every district in our country has felt 
the pain of inaction on the growing cli-
mate crisis, from forest fires in the 
West to unprecedented flooding in the 
Midwest and Northeast. 
My district is no exception. Just this 
week, I visited the Brandywine River 
Museum of Art, home of Andrew 
Wyatt’s masterpieces, which, 1 year 
ago, experienced devastating damage 
when extreme weather caused the near-
by river to rise over 18 feet. 
Yesterday, I toured the wetlands at 
John Heinz National Wildlife Refuge to 
discuss measures to address the ever- 
more-frequent flooding being experi-
enced in the nearby Eastwick neighbor-
hood. 
From one end of my district to an-
other, my constituents are seeing the 
devastating impact of climate change 
every single day. Congress must deliver 
results for these people: legislation 
that makes a difference for hard-
working Americans. 
When my Republican colleagues were 
in the majority, they used their con-
trol over this body to pass tax cuts for 
the wealthy and deny healthcare to 
millions of Americans. But Democrats 
have proven over and over they take 
seriously their job to deliver results for 
all of their constituents, and that is 
why we are here today. 
Through tax incentives, grants, and 
loans, the Inflation Reduction Act will 
reduce CO2 emissions by 40 percent by 
2030. This legislation will invest in our 
energy sector to promote innovation 
and renewable energy, and it will do 
this while supporting workers’ unions 
and creating more than 9 million new 
jobs over the next decade. 
The bill will also ensure that vulner-
able communities like Eastwick, most 
likely to feel the impact of a climate 
crisis, will receive the tools and atten-
tion they deserve. 
Beyond addressing climate, the bill 
will radically lower the cost of expen-
sive prescription drugs, help 13 million 
Americans keep their health insurance, 
and empower the IRS to go after 
wealthy corporations and tax cheats. 
Notably, it will do all this while reduc-
ing the budget deficit. 
Mr. Speaker, I am proud to support 
this legislation, and I urge all of my 
colleagues to do the same. 
b 1000 
Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentlewoman from Okla-
homa (Mrs. BICE). 
Mrs. BICE of Oklahoma. Mr. Speaker, 
I thank my colleague for yielding. 
I rise in opposition to the rule to con-
sider the Senate amendment to H.R. 
5376, the so-called Inflation Reduction 
Act. This partisan legislation is full of 
new tax hikes, which will negatively 
impact Oklahomans throughout my 
district. Sadly, the legislation will 
only worsen inflation and further the 
Democrats’ Green New Deal priorities. 
The bill should instead be called the 
Green New Deal lite. 
To make matters worse, the bill will 
not solve the energy crisis our Nation 
is currently facing. It raises the roy-
alty rate for onshore oil and gas leases, 
imposes a new per-acre fee to nominate 
these parcels, and provides billions for 
so-called environmental justice initia-
tives. The legislation also includes a 
natural gas tax, which would make it 
more expensive to heat homes, cook, 
and more. 
Mr. Speaker, for these reasons, I urge 
my colleagues to reject the rule and 
oppose this legislation. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
2 minutes to the gentleman from Colo-
rado (Mr. NEGUSE), a distinguished 
member of the Committee on Rules. 
Mr. NEGUSE. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the chairman for yielding. 
My colleagues on the other side of 
the aisle talk a big game about deficit 
reduction. They used the same par-
liamentary 
procedure, 
budget 
rec-
onciliation, when they were in power 
and in control of this majority, and 
they blew a $2 trillion hole in the def-
icit. 
House Democrats here today, putting 
people over politics, have put a bill on 
the floor that would reduce the deficit 
by billions of dollars. Apparently, that 
is not enough for my colleagues on the 
other side of the aisle. 
This bill will lower costs. It will cre-
ate better-paying jobs for the Amer-
ican people, and it will invest in cli-
mate action and the existential threat 
of our time facing my constituents in 
Colorado. 
Since 1982, Colorado has experienced 
natural disaster after natural disaster 
that has cost our State over $55 billion, 
including the most destructive fire in 
the history of my State just this past 
December. 
It is time for us to take this climate 
crisis seriously. That is exactly what 
this bill does, through investments in 
R&D, through investments in energy 
storage and battery technology, and so 
much more to enable our transition to 
a clean energy future. 
I am proud to support this bill be-
cause I believe it delivers for the Amer-
ican people. Mr. Speaker, I certainly 
urge my colleagues to support it, as 
well. 
Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, if we defeat the pre-
vious question, Republicans will amend 
the rule to allow the House to consider 
an amendment that would stop the IRS 
from hiring 87,000 new agents to target 
and harass lower-income Americans. 
Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous con-
sent to insert the text of the amend-
ment into the RECORD, along with ex-
traneous material, immediately prior 
to the vote on the previous question. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Texas?

August 12, 2022 
There was no objection. 
Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 
minutes to the gentleman from Ne-
braska (Mr. SMITH), who is here to ex-
plain the amendment. 
Mr. SMITH of Nebraska. Mr. Speak-
er, I thank my colleague from Texas 
for yielding me time. 
As Mr. BURGESS pointed out, if we de-
feat the previous question, I will move 
to amend the rule to make in order my 
amendment to strike funding for IRS 
enforcement activities. 
The administration’s own Treasury 
Department 
has 
said 
this 
funding 
would be used to hire 87,000 new IRS 
agents. This has been verified. These 
agents will be focused on targeting 
American families, small businesses, 
farmers, and ranchers with audits. 
Families and small businesses are 
struggling. That is no secret. Inflation 
is at 8.5 percent. Food and gas prices 
are at record highs. Despite this bill’s 
name, reasonable economists agree it 
will do nearly nothing to actually re-
duce inflation, especially in the near 
term. 
Small 
business 
pessimism 
about 
costs and access to workers is at all- 
time highs, and audits would only com-
pound this misery. Estimates put the 
starting cost to a small business being 
audited in the range of $10,000 to 
$75,000. Ridiculous. That is the last 
thing our small businesses need, the 
vast majority of whom follow the law. 
They are law-abiding individuals and 
law-abiding businesses. 
My amendment makes the following 
changes to the bill. 
It strikes the $45 billion for enforce-
ment activities, which include legal 
and litigation support, digital asset 
monitoring, and enforcing criminal 
statutes. Those are audit activities. 
It strikes $25 billion for operation 
support, which includes rent payments, 
printing, postage, and other adminis-
trative activities to support the new 
auditors. It also strikes $104 million for 
the Office of Tax Policy at IRS, the of-
fice which creates new tax regulations. 
It strikes $153 million for the U.S. 
Tax Court, where cases related to these 
new audits would be heard, and it 
strikes $50 million for Treasury to im-
plement these changes. 
Now, let me tell you what this 
amendment would not do. This amend-
ment leaves in place $3.2 billion for 
taxpayer services to help address the 
backlog of nearly 20 million unproc-
essed returns. We agree this backlog is 
a serious problem, and taxpayers need 
better customer service. It leaves in 
place $4.8 billion for badly needed IRS 
systems modernization. 
According to the CBO, the bill would 
still reduce the deficit if we adopt this 
amendment while leaving every other 
provision of the package intact. 
Unless there are Senate Democrats 
who 
believe 
auditing 
families 
and 
small businesses is the single most im-
portant part of this bill, they should 
have no problem expeditiously passing 
it again. 
Because we would only make in order 
this one single amendment, if we defeat 
the previous question, it will only 
delay final passage of the bill by about 
20 minutes. 
Mr. Speaker, I have many serious 
concerns about this bill that the rule 
makes in order, which I will discuss 
later. I find it particularly troubling 
the Democrats think auditing thou-
sands of more American families and 
small businesses is the solution to in-
flation. 
Let’s defeat the previous question 
and help assure law-abiding Americans 
that the IRS isn’t going to show up at 
their doors. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
For anybody to suggest that the IRS 
is somehow coming after people is ab-
surd 
and 
dangerous. 
This 
fear- 
mongering has to stop. 
Yesterday, the top Republican on the 
Senate Judiciary Committee, CHUCK 
GRASSLEY, made this outrageous state-
ment that armed IRS agents will go 
door-to-door with assault rifles after 
this bill passes. All I can say to that is 
everyone grab your tinfoil hats. 
I mean, in response, Senate Finance 
Chairman RON WYDEN said: ‘‘It is unbe-
lievable that we even need to say this, 
but there are not going to be 87,000 
armed IRS agents going door-to-door 
with assault weapons.’’ 
This is funding for answering phone 
calls, upgrading computer systems, and 
getting our constituents the refunds 
that they have been waiting for, for 
months and months. 
I get it. My Republican friends do not 
want to give the IRS the ability to go 
after wealthy tax cheats, big corpora-
tions that are using every loophole pos-
sible to avoid paying taxes. But do you 
know what? Our constituents have to 
pay their fair share. These rich people 
ought to pay their fair share, as well. 
I get it. My Republican friends, when 
they were in charge, passed a $2 trillion 
tax cut to make it easier for the rich 
and powerful to cheat on their taxes. 
This Democratic majority is going to 
make sure they pay their fair share. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the 
gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. JACKSON 
LEE). 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the distinguished chairman for 
yielding. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise enthusiastically 
to support the rule and the underlying 
bill. 
As I do so, let me ask my colleagues 
on the other side of the aisle to join me 
in asking President Trump to lower the 
rhetoric so we don’t have people dying 
every day because of his provocative 
words. 
Let me say, this bill is a miracle of 
success. It is a miracle because we, the 
Democrats, are giving back $300 billion 
to reduce the inflation that was cre-
ated by the Trump tax cut that has 
been killing us for the last couple of 
years. 
I am excited about the idea that 
those who are not paying their fair tax, 
the top 1 percent—$160 billion they do 
not pay—yet we will raise no taxes on 
those making $400,000 or less. 
We 
will 
make 
corporations 
and 
ultrawealthy persons pay their fair 
share through the IRS working to help 
working people. No new taxes on fami-
lies. That is crucial. 
Now, on the underlying bill, I would 
have wanted to offer an amendment 
dealing 
with 
the 
carried 
interest, 
which would have gotten us $14 billion. 
I wanted to make sure that we had the 
$35 limit on insulin and, as well, help 
for Medicaid recipients. 
This is a great bill. I support the rule 
and the underlying bill. 
Mr. Speaker, I would like to commend you 
and Chairman MCGOVERN for the Rule ena-
bling the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, H.R. 
5376, to be considered and voted on the floor 
today. 
Rapid action on the Inflation Reduction Act 
is vital, as it will have a major positive impact 
on quality-of-life for American families, reduce 
inflation for all Americans, and bolster our na-
tional economy and competitiveness for years 
to come. 
This landmark legislation will provide ur-
gently needed relief, as well as many reforms 
and initiatives that will help our nation transi-
tion to its next era of economic success for all 
Americans. 
Even though H.R. 5376 doesn’t include 
every solution that I hoped would be included, 
I wholeheartedly and enthusiastically support 
the rule and the bill because of the over-
whelmingly positive effects that the Inflation 
Reduction Act will have. 
The bill makes historic investments to com-
bat climate change by putting the United 
States on a path to reduce emissions by 40 
percent by 2030, including investments in 
clean energy and energy efficiency that will 
lower household energy costs. 
The bill’s clean energy and emission reduc-
tion programs attack the climate crisis at its 
source—electric utilities, cars, trucks, and 
even methane-producing farm animals—while 
ensuring that rural and disadvantaged commu-
nities share the benefits. 
It would bring electric cars—and the fuel 
costs they save—within the reach of working 
families. It would also lower utility bills, pro-
mote community solar projects, and boost 
America’s clean energy manufacturing base 
and workforce. 
The Inflation Reduction Act will lower the 
costs of prescription drugs by empowering 
Medicare—for the first time—to negotiate 
prices, while limiting out-of-pocket costs and 
price increases. Medicare would negotiate a 
maximum price of high-cost prescription drugs 
for Medicare Part B and Part D that will take 
effect in 2026. This provision will make pre-
scription drugs more accessible and stop drug 
companies from raising the price of prescrip-
tion medicines faster than inflation. 
This legislation will also extend the Afford-
able Care Act’s health insurance premium tax 
credits through 2025. This will avert a huge 
price hike in premiums for the majority of the 
14 million people who have enrolled in ACA 
Marketplace plans. 
The Inflation Reduction Act would create a 
more equitable tax system by applying a 15 
percent minimum tax to corporations with 
more than $1 billion in average annual income

August 12, 2022 
over a three-year period. This would ensure 
that these corporations at least pay roughly 
the same rate as many working taxpayers. 
The bill would also impose a 1 percent ex-
cise tax on corporate stock buybacks, and it 
would enable the IRS to reverse staff cuts and 
ensure compliance with tax laws and regula-
tions. 
By creating a more equitable tax system, 
this legislation will ease the pressure of infla-
tion and allow more Americans to participate 
productively in the economy. Americans over-
whelmingly agree that corporations have paid 
too little for too long. Only in Washington 
would Republicans fight against cutting costs 
for low- and middle-income workers and their 
families in defense of wealthy corporations. 
That point about fundamental equity brings 
me to one of my regrets about this bill. When 
the agreement that led to this bill was an-
nounced in July, it had a provision to close the 
carried interest loophole. That tax code loop-
hole allows managers of private equity and 
other investment funds to pay lower taxes on 
their earnings than those paid by wage and 
salary earners. 
The Senate agreement, as it was first an-
nounced, would have closed the carried inter-
est loophole by extending the required holding 
period to five years, which is more in line with 
how long private equity funds typically hold 
their investments. But unfortunately, the Sen-
ate dropped that provision from the bill, giving 
up $13 billion that it would have raised over 
ten years. 
The carried interest loophole benefits billion-
aires, and by that provision being dropped 
from the bill, billionaires scored a victory worth 
billions of dollars at the time when most Amer-
icans are struggling to make ends meet. 
Obviously, that offends principles of equity 
and fairness, and, if I had the opportunity 
amend H.R. 5376, I would have offered an 
amendment to close the carried interest loop-
hole. 
Another amendment that I would have of-
fered would have lowered the costs of insulin 
for people whose health care coverage is with 
private insurance companies. 
While I am delighted that H.R. 5376 im-
poses a $35 per month cap on the price of in-
sulin for people covered by Medicare, this cap 
should have extended to Americans with pri-
vate insurance. I was very upset that Senate 
Republicans rejected that policy, as it is un-
conscionable to force people to choose be-
tween affording their life-sustaining insulin or 
their other daily needs. Some Americans have 
died because they couldn’t afford their insulin, 
which has been subject to unjustifiable pricing 
practices. 
So, I would have offered an amendment to 
ensure that all Americans, including those with 
private health insurance, benefit from a $35 
per month cap on their insulin costs. 
Finally, I was disappointed that Senator 
RAPHAEL WARNOCK’s amendment about Med-
icaid expansion was not adopted by the Sen-
ate. This amendment sought to close the Med-
icaid coverage gap so that 2.2 million people 
living in poverty, with no affordable health 
care, would be able to see a doctor when they 
are sick, pregnant, or have other health 
needs. 
The third amendment I would have offered 
would have closed the Medicaid coverage gap 
for health care to impoverished Americans 
who have a need for, and the right to, health 
care. Although it is not in this bill, I will con-
tinue to fight for this. 
Even without those three elements, the In-
flation Reduction Act is excellent legislation 
that will be a great leap forward for the Amer-
ican people, particularly for my constituents in 
the 18th Congressional District of Texas, as 
well as for all of America. 
Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from Ne-
braska (Mr. SMITH) for the purposes of 
rebuttal. 
Mr. SMITH of Nebraska. Mr. Speak-
er, it is interesting, in this exchange 
here, the claims being made that this 
bill will just do so many wonderful 
things for our country and that they 
are holding harmless folks making less 
than $400,000. 
The CBO just reported that at least 
$20 billion in savings from this bill will 
come from families making less than 
$400,000 a year, hardly what has been 
stated by the folks advocating for this 
bill. 
We know that the facts point out 
that it is 87,000 new employees, includ-
ing agents, over at the IRS, and these 
full-time equivalents would take place 
by 2031. I am not sure where those folks 
come from, necessarily. I know it has 
been stated that this would fill vacan-
cies or answer retirements for the next 
few years. But why do we need new 
money for that? That should already be 
budgeted. 
Certainly, these agents at the IRS 
have law enforcement authority. They 
have badges that let them walk around 
the magnetometers at the airports. 
Certainly, I would assume they are 
armed, as well. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentleman has expired. 
Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
an additional 30 seconds to the gen-
tleman from Nebraska. 
Mr. SMITH of Nebraska. The Joint 
Committee on Taxation estimates 78 to 
90 percent of new revenue from unre-
ported income will come from folks 
earning less than $200,000 per year. 
I think we need to be very cautious 
as we move forward and grow an agen-
cy that even President Clinton pushed 
back on when he was President, real-
izing that the agency was harassing 
the American people. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I want to make clear to 
my colleagues that, actually, in the 
Senate bill, there was explicit language 
that made it very clear that none of 
this money would be used for audits for 
people earning $400,000 or less or tar-
geting small businesses. But Repub-
licans over in the Senate insisted that 
the language be stripped out, and now 
they are complaining about it. 
But do you know what? I have good 
news for you. 
Mr. Speaker, I include in the RECORD 
a letter from Treasury Secretary Janet 
Yellen that makes it crystal clear that 
that is not what is going to happen, 
along 
with 
a 
letter 
from 
Donald 
Trump’s appointed IRS Commissioner, 
who is still there, who made it very 
clear that it won’t be used for that. 
SECRETARY OF THE TREASURY, 
DEPARTMENT OF THE TREASURY, 
Washington, DC, August 10, 2022. 
CHARLES P. RETTIG, 
Commissioner, Internal Revenue Service, 
Washington, DC. 
DEAR COMMISSIONER: The Inflation Reduc-
tion Act includes much-needed funding for 
the IRS to improve taxpayer service, mod-
ernize outdated technological infrastructure, 
and increase equity in the tax system by en-
forcing the tax laws against those high-earn-
ers, large corporations, and complex partner-
ships who today do not pay what they owe. 
These crucial investments have been a 
focus of the Biden Administration since the 
President’s first day in office, and I was 
heartened to see the legislation pass the Sen-
ate this weekend. 
Notwithstanding the changes that arose 
because of Republican challenges during the 
Byrd process, I write today to confirm the 
commitment that has been a guiding precept 
of the planning that you and your team are 
undertaking: that audit rates will not rise 
relative to recent years for households mak-
ing under $400,000 annually. 
Specifically, I direct that any additional 
resources—including any new personnel or 
auditors that are hired—shall not be used to 
increase the share of small business or 
households below the $400,000 threshold that 
are audited relative to historical levels. This 
means that, contrary to the misinformation 
from opponents of this legislation, small 
business or households earning $400,000 per 
year or less will not see an increase in the 
chances that they are audited. 
Instead, enforcement resources will focus 
on high-end noncompliance. There, sus-
tained, multiyear funding is so critical to 
the agency’s ability to make the invest-
ments needed to pursue a robust attack on 
the tax gap by targeting crucial challenges, 
like large corporations, high-networth indi-
viduals and complex pass-throughs, where 
today the IRS has resources to initiate just 
7,500 audits annually out of more than 4 mil-
lion returns received. 
This is challenging work that requires a 
team of sophisticated revenue agents in 
place to spend thousands of hours poring 
over complicated returns, and it is also work 
that has huge revenue potential: indeed, an 
additional hour auditing someone making 
more than $5 million annually generates an 
estimated $4,500 of additional taxes col-
lected. This is essential work that I know 
the IRS is eager to undertake. 
For regular taxpayers, as you emphasized 
last week, the result of this resource infu-
sion will be a lower likelihood of audit by an 
agency that has the data and technological 
infrastructure in place to target enforcement 
resources where they belong—on the high 
end of the income distribution, where the top 
1 percent alone is estimated to not be paying 
$160 billion in owed taxes each year. That’s 
important as a matter of revenue-raising, 
but it’s also essential as a matter of fairness. 
Crucially, these resources will support a 
much-needed upgrade of technology that is 
decades out-of-date, and an investment in 
taxpayer service so that the IRS is finally 
able to communicate with taxpayers in an 
efficient, timely manner. I look forward to 
working with you on creating new digital 
tools to allow taxpayers to get information 
from the IRS instantaneously and on im-
proving taxpayer service, so the agency is 
well-equipped to answer calls when they 
come in. 
This historic investment in our tax system 
will accomplish two critical objectives. It

Sincerely,

DEPARTMENT OF THE TREASURY, 
INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE, 
Washington DC, August 4, 2022. 
DEAR
MEMBER
OF
THE
UNITED
STATES 
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES: It has been the 
greatest honor of my professional life to 
spend the last four years at the helm of the 
IRS. I am struck each day by the commit-
ment of dedicated IRS employees to helping 
American families. And our employees have 
done all that without the tools to do so effec-
tively. For too long, the agency has not had 
the resources that it needs to ensure the tax 
laws are enforced fairly and that Americans 
receive the level and quality of service they 
deserve. We are the greatest country in the 
world, yet the agency that touches more 
Americans than any other continually strug-
gles to receive sufficient resources to fulfill 
its important mission. 
The resources in the reconciliation pack-
age will get us back to historical norms in 
areas of challenge for the agency—large cor-
porate 
and 
global 
high-net-worth 
tax-
payers—as well as new areas like pass- 
through entities and multinational tax-
payers with international tax issues, where 
we need sophisticated, specialized teams in 
place that are able to unpack complex struc-
tures and identify noncompliance. 
These resources are absolutely not about 
increasing audit scrutiny on small busi-
nesses or middle-income Americans. As 
we’ve been planning, our investment of these 
enforcement resources is designed around 
the Department of the Treasury’s directive 
that audit rates will not rise relative to re-
cent years for households making under 
$400,000. Other resources will be invested in 
employees and IT systems that will allow us 
to better serve all taxpayers, including small 
businesses and middle-income taxpayers. En-
hanced IT systems and taxpayer service will 
actually mean that honest taxpayers will be 
better able to comply with the tax laws, re-
sulting in a lower likelihood of being audited 
and a reduced burden on them. 
Large corporate and high-net-worth tax-
payers often engage teams of sophisticated 
representatives who pursue unsettled or 
sometimes questionable interpretations of 
tax law. The integrity and fairness of our tax 
administrative system relies upon the abil-
ity of our agency to maintain a strong, visi-
ble, robust enforcement presence directed to 
these and other similarly situated taxpayers 
when they are noncompliant. These impor-
tant efforts also support honest taxpayers 
who voluntarily comply with their filing and 
reporting requirements. 
The IRS has fewer front-line, experienced 
examiners in the field than at any time since 
World War II, and fewer employees than at 
any time since the 1970s. Advances in tech-
nology have been helpful but have not kept 
pace with the ever-increasing responsibil-
ities and challenges facing the IRS. As a re-
sult, the IRS has for too long been unable to 
pursue meaningful, impactful examinations 
of large corporate and high-net-worth tax-
payers to ensure they are paying their fair 
share. This creates a direct revenue loss 
from evaders and lessens the potential to 
deter others from pursuing a similar path of 
noncompliance. Every American should sup-
port a fair and impartial system of tax ad-
ministration supported by an appropriately 
resourced tax administrator. In fact, the 
continued success of our country depends, in 
part, upon the success of the agency in ap-
propriately, fairly and impartially enforcing 
the tax laws and in providing meaningful, 
impactful services to every American. 
As an extremely proud American, I’m 
grateful for your support of the IRS and our 
dedicated employees. I cannot be forceful 
enough in emphasizing that these resources 
will be transformative for the agency and for 
American taxpayers. I am available to meet 
with you at your convenience to discuss the 
foregoing. 
Thank you, 
CHARLES P. RETTIG. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, let’s 
stop the misinformation and stop the 
fear-mongering. 
I get it. My Republican friends do not 
want to lower the costs of prescription 
drugs for senior citizens. They don’t 
want to do anything about climate 
change. They don’t want to pay down 
the deficit or the debt. I get it. But we 
do, and the American people do, and I 
am proud of this legislation. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 11⁄2 minutes to 
the gentlewoman from California (Ms. 
WATERS), 
the 
distinguished 
chair-
woman of the Committee on Financial 
Services. 
Ms. WATERS. Mr. Speaker, I rise in 
recognition of the very long and dif-
ficult negotiations that have taken 
place following the Build Back Better 
Act, led by President Biden and the 
Democrats. I applaud all the bene-
ficiaries of the reconciliation bill in 
what is now the Inflation Reduction 
Act. 
This act includes historic climate 
change legislation. It will lower pre-
scription drug costs, reduce the cost of 
Medicare, and, hopefully, force major 
corporations to pay their fair share of 
taxes. 
However, as chairwoman of the Fi-
nancial Services Committee, I have 
worked with members of my com-
mittee and many Members of Congress 
to confront the housing crisis in this 
country. We organized a request for 
$150 billion in the Build Back Better 
Act, which included rental assistance 
with Section 8 vouchers, development 
of more affordable housing units, sup-
port for first-generation home buyers, 
repairs to fix deteriorating public hous-
ing, and fair housing enforcement to 
eliminate discrimination and unlawful 
evictions. 
However, there is not one nickel, not 
one dime, not one dollar, for the devel-
opment of housing in this bill. We can 
no longer afford to have housing as an 
afterthought, a ‘‘nice to have,’’ or sim-
ply something that can wait until 
later. It is foundational to the pros-
perity of families, key to a healthy 
economy, and crucial to fighting infla-
tion. 
Yes, I am disappointed. I am going to 
vote for this bill because so many peo-
ple are going to benefit in different 
ways, but I am disappointed that hous-
ing does not show up anywhere in this 
legislation. 
Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
1 minute to the gentleman from Geor-
gia (Mr. DAVID
SCOTT), the distin-
guished chairman of the Committee on 
Agriculture. 
b 1015 
Mr. DAVID SCOTT of Georgia. Mr. 
Speaker, I thank the gentleman for 
yielding. This is an important bill, and, 
yes, it will bring down inflation. 
Mr. Speaker, we are dealing here 
with basic economics, and unless we 
have multiple forces working simulta-
neously, we will not be able to bring 
down the costs of food particularly. 
I raise this point because, as Chair-
woman WATERS pointed out, it does 
help in terms of prescription drugs. It 
brings down the cost of healthcare. 
Those reflect some of our basic needs. 
It 
helps 
our 
veterans 
with 
their 
healthcare. 
Just as I stepped up and helped to 
deal with the step-up, we are having a 
problem with the front end of our food 
supply chain. We have 17,000 of our 
ranchers and small farmers going out 
of business every year. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentleman has expired. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
the gentleman an additional 15 sec-
onds. 
Mr. DAVID SCOTT of Georgia. Mr. 
Speaker, let me just say that this is 
very important, and it sets the stage 
for this bill working with our lower 
food and fuel costs to continue the 
process. 
Finally, we will have a bill in Sep-
tember that addresses the front line of 
our supply chain that will also bring 
down costs and inflation. 
Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
30 seconds to the gentleman from Ne-
braska (Mr. SMITH) for rebuttal. 
Mr. SMITH of Nebraska. Mr. Speak-
er, let me be very clear that if Sec-
retary Yellen were accurate when she 
said that inflation was transitory, we 
would have no reason to be here right 
now. Obviously, she has backed off 
those comments based on realities, and 
that is what we need to focus on. Now, 
the realities and the facts are not what 
some hopes might be for some legisla-
tion on the floor. 
Mr. Speaker, I include in the RECORD 
documents from the CBO, the JCT, the 
GAO, and the Department of the Treas-
ury. 
CBO has received a number of questions re-
garding our estimate of an amendment of-
fered by Senator Crapo during the floor de-
bate on H.R. 5376 last weekend. That amend-
ment, #5404, would limit the use of addi-
tional funds for the Internal Revenue Serv-
ice. If the amendment had been adopted none 
of the additional funds could have been used 
to audit taxpayers with taxable incomes 
below $400,000. 
CBO did not complete a formal cost esti-
mate in advance of consideration of the 
amendment but the agency did provide the 
following information to the Senate Budget 
Committee: 
CBO estimates that the amendment 5404 
would have the following effects: 
No effect on outlays in the one or ten year 
budget windows; would reduce outlays in the 
five year budget window.

No effect on revenues in the one year budg-

revenues resulting from the provisions of 
section 10301 in the five and ten year budget

No effect on outlays after 2031 but would

CBO has not completed a point estimate of

least $20 billion over the FY2022–FY2031 pe-

CONGRESS OF THE UNITED STATES, 
JOINT COMMITTEE ON TAXATION, 
Washngton, DC, August 17, 2021. 
MEMORANDUM 
To: Redacted. 
From: Thomas A. Barthold. 
Subject: Distributional Information. 
This memorandum responds to your re-
quest for distributional information on a 
proposal 
in 
Treasury’s 
‘‘General 
Expla-
nations of the Administration’s Fiscal Year 
2022 Revenue Proposals’’ (the ‘‘Greenbook’’). 
The proposal, ‘‘Introduce Comprehensive Fi-
nancial Account Reporting to Improve Tax 
Compliance,’’ requires financial institutions 
to report inflows and outflows for every ac-
count with at least $600 of inflows or out-
flows in a year, for tax years beginning after 
December 31, 2022. Although these inflows 
and outflows do not directly correspond to 
any line items on tax returns, the proposal is 
estimated to reduce underreporting of in-
come, particularly on income subject to lit-
tle or no information reporting, such as indi-
vidual business income, self-employment in-
come, and small C corporation income. We 
estimate that the proposal would raise $206 
billion over the 2022–31 budget window. 
We are unable to provide distributional ef-
fects for this proposal because we do not im-
pute unreported income to our individual tax 
model, in part because the distribution of 
unreported income is not well identified. In-
stead, we provide some distributional infor-
mation on the tax gap attributable to the 
types of taxpayers that might be most af-
fected by this proposal. In particular, under-
reporting of non farm proprietor income, i.e., 
Schedule C income, was estimated to con-
tribute $68 billion to the annual $245 billion 
individual income tax underreporting tax 
gap for tax years 2011 to 2013.1
Under-
reporting of Schedule C income also contrib-
utes heavily to the $45 billion self-employ-
ment (SECA) tax underreporting tax gap for 
those same years.2 
The table below presents a distribution of 
estimated tax assessments from representa-
tive random audits related to underreporting 
of Schedule C income. To estimate these tax 
assessments, income adjustments from these 
audits were multiplied by estimated average 
marginal tax rates.3
As the table shows, 
more than half of the assessed amounts are 
estimated to come from taxpayers with re-
ported income between zero and $50,000.4 To 
the extent that taxpayers with sole propri-
etor income tend to have lower income than 
taxpayers with partnership or S corporation 
income, the distribution of the tax assess-
ments related to underreporting of Schedule 
C income might not represent the distribu-
tional effects of the Green Book proposal. To 
provide a fuller picture, the table also pre-
sents a distribution of estimated tax assess-
ments related to underreporting of Schedule 
E income.5 Many random audits of Schedule 
E income did not include entity-level audits. 
Entity-level audits were likely more com-
mon 
among 
smaller, 
single-owner 
busi-
nesses.6 Thus, the Schedule E distribution 
below is incomplete and could skew toward 
lower incomes relative to a hypothetical dis-
tribution resulting from random entity-level 
audits. 
The distributions below are grouped by re-
ported adjusted gross income and therefore 
skew toward lower-income taxpayers rel-
ative to distributions done by true income 
(reported income plus unreported income). 
However, when audit adjustments are added 
to reported income, affected taxpayers tend 
to remain in the reported income group or 
move up only one income group.7

APPENDIX I: OBJECTIVES, SCOPE, AND 
METHODOLOGY 
As discussed below, we analyzed data for 
the most recent years available to determine 
(1) audit rates by selected income categories 
and the reasons for differences across these 
categories, and (2) audit outcomes and re-
sources used for auditing individual tax re-
turns across the income categories and the 
likely reasons for any trends. Our scope of 
work focused on taxpayer income and did not 
include analyzing audits by other character-
istics, such as type of audit, type of auditor, 
or audit location. 
Income levels. The Internal Revenue Serv-
ice’s (IRS) 2020 Data Book Table 17 provides 
data on audit rates and results by various 
groupings of total positive income. However, 
for our analysis and to simplify reporting, 
we developed fewer, broader income cat-
egories 
by 
combining 
IRS’s 
income 
groupings, as shown in table 2. We analyzed 
IRS data using our broader income cat-
egories and compared the results with IRS’s 
groupings. When the finer-level analysis pro-
vided additional insight, we discuss those in-
sights in the report. In general, we used our 
broad income categories throughout the re-
port to discuss general audit trends. 
Similar to IRS, our income categories in-
clude returns with the Earned Income Tax 
Credit (EITC). We also analyzed EITC re-
turns as a separate category because of their 
high volume and improper payment report-
ing. 
A. RESTORING IRS RESOURCES 
The first step in the President’s efforts to 
restore IRS enforcement capability is a sus-
tained, multi-year commitment to rebuild-
ing the IRS. This involves spending nearly 
$80 billion on IRS priorities over the course 
of the decade including hiring new special-
ized enforcement staff, modernizing anti-
quated information technology, and invest-
ing in meaningful taxpayer service—includ-
ing the implementation of the newly ex-
panded credits aimed at providing support to 
American families. Importantly, the addi-
tional resources will go toward enforcement 
against those with the highest incomes, and 
audit rates will not rise relative to recent 
years for those earning less than $400,000 in 
actual income. 
The President’s proposal includes two com-
ponents: a dedicated stream of mandatory 
funds ($72.5 billion over a decade) and a pro-
gram integrity allocation ($6.7 billion over a 
decade). These mechanisms provide for a sus-
tained, multi-year commitment to revital-
izing the IRS that will give the agency the 
certainty it needs to rebuild. 
The IRS proposal includes year-by-year es-
timates of the additional resources that will 
be directed toward the agency as well as the 
specific activities that these resources would 
support. The design ensures that the IRS is 
able to absorb and usefully deploy additional 
resources over the entire 10–year horizon and 
keeps budget growth manageable at around 
10 percent per year. 
SECRETARY OF THE TREASURY, 
DEPARTMENT OF THE TREASURY, 
Washington, DC, August 10, 2022. 
CHARLES P. RETTIG, 
Commissioner, Internal Revenue Service, 
Washington, DC. 
DEAR COMMISSIONER: The Inflation Reduc-
tion Act includes much-needed funding for 
the IRS to improve taxpayer service, mod-
ernize outdated technological infrastructure, 
and increase equity in the tax system by en-
forcing the tax laws against those high-earn-
ers, large corporations, and complex partner-
ships who today do not pay what they owe. 
These crucial investments have been a 
focus of the Biden Administration since the 
President’s first day in office, and I was 
heartened to see the legislation pass the Sen-
ate this weekend. 
Notwithstanding the changes that arose 
because of Republican challenges during the 
Byrd process, I write today to confirm the 
commitment that has been a guiding precept 
of the planning that you and your team are 
undertaking: that audit rates will not rise 
relative to recent years for households mak-
ing under $400,000 annually . 
Specifically, I direct that any additional 
resources—including any new personnel or 
auditors that are hired—shall not be used to 
increase the share of small business or 
households below the $400,000 threshold that 
are audited relative to historical levels. This 
means that, contrary to the misinformation 
from opponents of this legislation, small 
business or households earning $400,000 per 
year or less will not see an increase in the 
chances that they are audited. 
Instead, enforcement resources will focus 
on high-end noncompliance. There, sus-
tained, multi-year funding is so critical to

the agency’s ability to make the invest-
ments needed to pursue a robust attack on 
the tax gap by targeting crucial challenges, 
like large corporations, high-net-worth indi-
viduals and complex pass-throughs, where 
today the IRS has resources to initiate just 
7,500 audits annually out of more than 4 mil-
lion returns received. 
This is challenging work that requires a 
team of sophisticated revenue agents in 
place to spend thousands of hours poring 
over complicated returns, and it is also work 
that has huge revenue potential: indeed, an 
additional hour auditing someone making 
more than $5 million annually generates an 
estimated $4,500 of additional taxes col-
lected. This is essential work that I know 
the IRS is eager to undertake. 
For regular taxpayers, as you emphasized 
last week, the result of this resource infu-
sion will be a lower likelihood of audit by an 
agency that has the data and technological 
infrastructure in place to target enforcement 
resources where they belong—on the high 
end of the income distribution, where the top 
1 percent alone is estimated to not be paying 
$160 billion in owed taxes each year. That’s 
important as a matter of revenue-raising, 
but it’s also essential as a matter of fairness. 
Crucially, these resources will support a 
much-needed upgrade of technology that is 
decades out-of-date, and an investment in 
taxpayer service so that the IRS is finally 
able to communicate with taxpayers in an 
efficient, timely manner. I look forward to 
working with you on creating new digital 
tools to allow taxpayers to get information 
from the IRS instantaneously and on im-
proving taxpayer service, so the agency is 
well-equipped to answer calls when they 
come in. 
This historic investment in our tax system 
will accomplish two critical objectives. It 
will raise substantial revenue to address the 
deficit; and it will create a fairer system, 
where those at the top who do not today 
comply with their tax obligations find it far 
less easy to do so, and where all taxpayers 
receive the service from the IRS that they 
deserve, and that your dedicated workforce 
is eager to deliver. The importance of the 
work ahead cannot be overstated. 
Sincerely, 
JANET L. YELLEN. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I urge 
my colleagues to please stop the 
fearmongering and pandering to the ex-
tremists. 
People are listening when people 
speak on this House floor. We had 
someone show up at an FBI field office 
with a nail gun. Enough of the misin-
formation. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 30 seconds to the 
gentleman from Oregon (Mr. BLU-
MENAUER). 
Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, I 
appreciate the opportunity to make 
one point. The extent to which this is 
a partisan bill is a result of selective 
memory and a willful refusal on the 
part of my Republican colleagues to 
work with us. 
This legislation is replete with items 
that I am proud to have authored with 
Senator GRASSLEY: The small energy 
wind tax credit; 30D in terms of elec-
tric vehicles; the 179 building tax cred-
it. These are historically bipartisan in 
nature. There was a time when the Re-
publicans used to work with us on that. 
They have chosen to move in the oppo-
site direction, to their shame. 
We are going to remedy that today. 
Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, may I 
inquire as to how much time is remain-
ing on each side. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from Texas has 11⁄2 minutes re-
maining. The gentleman from Massa-
chusetts has 41⁄2 minutes remaining. 
Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I in-
clude in the RECORD a Washington Post 
piece titled, ‘‘Climate change’s impact 
intensifies as U.S. prepares to take ac-
tion.’’ 
[From The Washington Post, Aug. 11, 2022] 
CLIMATE CHANGE’S IMPACT INTENSIFIES AS 
U.S. PREPARES TO TAKE ACTION 
(By Chris Mooney, Brady Dennis and Sarah 
Kaplan) 
For residents of the Norwegian archipelago 
of Svalbard, the United States’ recent suc-
cess in clinching a major piece of climate 
change legislation may feel like too little, 
too late. 
Over the past 40 years, as the world’s larg-
est historical emitter of greenhouses gases 
repeatedly failed to take significant action 
on the climate, the region surrounding 
Svalbard has warmed at least four times 
faster than the global average, according to 
significant research published Thursday. 
The study suggests that warming in the 
Arctic is happening at a much faster rate 
than many scientists had expected. And 
while U.S. lawmakers this summer hashed 
out the details of a massive bill to speed 
their nation’s shift toward cleaner energy— 
the culmination of months of deliberations— 
the new findings were just the latest visceral 
reminder that the planet’s changing climate 
isn’t waiting around for human action. 
Recent studies on subjects including tree 
mortality in North America and evidence of 
weakening ice-shelves in Antarctica, com-
bined with a stream of extreme weather 
events that include last month’s European 
heat wave and torrential floods of late in 
Kentucky and South Korea, are providing 
steady evidence of global warming’s inten-
sifying impact on the planet. 
The Arctic is where some of the shifts are 
most severe. 
Svalbard, a cluster of Arctic islands famed 
for populations of polar bears, experienced 
its hottest June on record. A record 40 bil-
lion tons of ice from the archipelago had 
melted into the ocean by the end of July. 
Melting permafrost and unstable mountain 
slopes are threatening homes. 
And that’s just a sampling from a region 
that has warmed at an astounding rate— 
roughly 3 degrees Celsius (5.4 degrees Fahr-
enheit) since 1979. 
‘‘It’s a really vulnerable environment in 
the Arctic, and seeing these numbers, it’s 
worrying,’’ said Antti Lipponen, a scientist 
with the Finnish Meteorological Institute 
who contributed to Thursday’s peer-reviewed 
study published in Communications Earth & 
Environment. 
The study provides sobering context for 
this week’s expected passage by the House of 
Representatives of the Inflation Reduction 
Act. Experts say it is a landmark piece of 
legislation that will drive down U.S. emis-
sions of greenhouse gases by incentivizing 
the purchase of electric vehicles and energy- 
efficient appliances, and a quickening pace 
of renewable-energy installations. Recent es-
timates suggest that the bill could lower 
U.S. greenhouse gas emissions by as much as 
a billion tons per year by the end of 2030. 
But that’s still tiny, compared with the 
more than 2 trillion tons of planet-warming 
carbon dioxide gas that humanity has emit-
ted since the year 1850—a figure that does 
not include any other warming gases, such 
as methane, which also is playing a major 
role in the world’s temperature increases. 
The Inflation Reduction Act will mark ‘‘an 
historic moment’’ for the United States—one 
that hasn’t seemed plausible since President 
Bill Clinton and Vice President Al Gore 
pushed for significant action in the 1990s, 
said Bill Hare, a climate scientist and the 
chief executive at Climate Analytics, a 
prominent science and policy institute. The 
bill could have a global ripple effect that 
spurs other countries to take more ambi-
tious steps, Hare said. 
Yet, Hare noted that the legislation does 
not bring the United States to President 
Biden’s goal of cutting emissions at least in 
half by 2030 from their 2005 levels. It also in-
cludes provisions for additional oil and gas 
drilling and easing permitting processes for 
fossil 
fuel 
infrastructure—contradicting 
findings from the United Nations Intergov-
ernmental Panel on Climate Change that the 
world must nearly eliminate coal and signifi-
cantly slash the use of oil and natural gas to 
have a hope of avoiding catastrophic warm-
ing. 
At the same time, Hare noted, there is an 
ongoing ‘‘rush for gas’’ in Africa and Aus-
tralia ‘‘that is quite inconsistent with the 
Paris agreement,’’ the 2015 accord in which 
nations vowed to progressively lower their 
emissions to avoid dangerous levels of warm-
ing. And Russia’s war in Ukraine has 
prompted a near-term scramble for fossil 
fuels even in relatively climate-conscious 
Europe. 
These forces continue to push the world off 
track from meeting the Paris accord’s most 
ambitious goal: limiting global temperature 
increases to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees 
Fahrenheit) above preindustrial levels. Be-
yond that threshold, experts warn, the world 
faces a future of chronic food crises, esca-
lating natural disasters and collapsing eco-
systems. 
Already, with the world have warmed by 
roughly 1.1 degrees Celsius (2 degrees Fahr-
enheit), deadly climate impacts are unfold-
ing. Europe is broiling amid record-setting 
heat waves that have scorched crops and 
sparked wildfires. At least eight people were 
killed in Seoul as the heaviest rainfall in 
more than 100 years deluged the South Ko-
rean capital. Droughts have ravaged Mexico 
and contributed to a spiraling hunger crisis 
in East Africa. In the United States, people 
are dying of extreme heat, and in over-
whelming Hoods and raging wildfires. 
‘‘This summer is just a horrorscape,’’ said 
Kim Cobb, a climate scientist at Brown Uni-
versity and the lead author of the IPCC’s 
most recent report on the science of climate 
change. ‘‘And I know it won’t be stopping in 
the near term.’’ 
These disasters underscore what an explod-
ing body of scientific research continues to 
show: that adverse climate change continues 
to outpace the plodding progress of political 
action. Even a historic investment such as 
the Inflation Reduction Act, Cobb said, is 
dwarfed by the scale of the crisis. 
‘‘There needs to be an infinite acceleration 
in frequency of this kind of legislation,’’ she 
said. ‘‘I think the planet is sending that mes-
sage pretty loud and clear.’’ 
STARTLING TRENDS IN THE ARCTIC 
Take the new Arctic study, which shows 
that the amplified warming occurring at the 
top of the planet, while long expected, ex-
ceeds what climate models predict by a no-
ticeable margin. ‘‘We suspect that either this 
is an extremely unlikely event, or the cli-
mate models systematically underestimate 
this Arctic amplification,’’ Lipponen said of 
the rapid pace of Arctic warming.

August 12, 2022 
The study takes as its starting point the 
year 1979 because of the availability of sat-
ellite data covering the Arctic. It defines the 
Arctic as the region above the Arctic Circle, 
and the authors acknowledge that if longer 
periods are considered or if the Arctic is de-
fined more broadly, the rate of Arctic warm-
ing can appear somewhat less. 
The warming is most concentrated to the 
east of Svalbard, in the Barents and Kara 
seas, regions that have also seen some of the 
fastest loss of Arctic sea ice. This ice has 
traditionally reflected a huge amount of the 
sun’s heat back into space, keeping the plan-
et cool. But as it vanishes from the sea sur-
face, more sunlight is absorbed by the 
ocean—and then the warmer sea surface sup-
ports even less ice. 
It is one of the most well-known climate 
‘‘feedbacks’’—a phenomenon through which 
an effect of warming contributes to further 
warmth. Although scientists try to account 
for this feedback in the models they use to 
predict future climate change, they might be 
underestimating it. At the extreme, the new 
study finds some regions between Svalbard 
and the Russian island of Novaya Zemlya 
that are warming at a rate of over 1.25 de-
grees Celsius, or 2.25 degrees Fahrenheit, 
every decade, 
That’s massively disruptive to Arctic life, 
human and otherwise. 
But interconnections among the ice, at-
mosphere, land and ocean mean that no part 
of the planet will be unaffected. As extreme 
temperatures bake the carbon-rich perma-
frost of northern landscapes, the thawing 
earth releases carbon dioxide gas. 
Even as people begin to cut their emis-
sions, nature’s emissions have just begun. 
A SUDDEN COLLAPSE 
There’s also concerning news from the 
other pole. 
NASA scientists, led by Chad Greene, have 
derived a technique allowing them to study 
the enormous, sometimes country-size plat-
forms of ice, called ice shelves, that encircle 
Antarctica. These are Earth’s main defenses 
against massive sea level rise, acting as a 
bracing mechanism that holds back Antarc-
tica’s inland ice. 
But the shelves are sustaining severe dam-
age. Several, like Larsen A and B, have col-
lapsed entirely. Thwaites Glacier, Antarc-
tica’s most worrying and perhaps most vul-
nerable spot, has lost about 2 trillion tons of 
ice from its ice shelf, which has dramatically 
retracted inland, new research found. The 
overall area lost from Antarctic ice shelves 
since 1997—about 14,000 square miles—is a 
little bit larger than Maryland and rep-
resents about 2 percent of the total ice shelf 
area. 
As a reminder of these ice shelves’ vulner-
ability, the Conger Ice Shelf in East Antarc-
tica—traditionally thought to be the coldest 
and most stable part of the ice sheet—sud-
denly collapsed this year. 
Conger was not very large for an Antarctic 
shelf—merely the size of a large city. But its 
unexpected collapse—which appears to have 
been triggered by a sudden period of unusual 
warmth—should prompt alarm, scientist say. 
‘‘It means that Antarctica’s ice shelves are 
vulnerable, and they can still surprise us,’’ 
NASA’s Greene, who works at the agency’s 
Jet Propulsion Laboratory, said of the event. 
Greene’s study, which appeared in Nature 
this week, was co-written with colleagues 
from NASA and the University of Tasmania. 
‘‘Conger counters a common expectation 
that ice shelf collapse should only occur 
after a long period of thinning and weak-
ening,’’ he continued. ‘‘Conger tells us that 
ice shelves can collapse without any warning 
signs whatsoever.’’ 
IMPERILED NORTHERN FORESTS 
In another sign of the swiftly shifting cli-
mate, new research this week also details 
how tree species that dominate North Amer-
ican boreal forests—including firs, spruces 
and pines—are experiencing growing stress 
and a decline in the survival of saplings in 
response to rising temperatures and reduced 
rainfall. 
The five-year, open-air experiment details 
how critical trees that have populated the 
southern edge of boreal forests—a key eco-
system for wildlife, timber production and 
for soaking up massive amounts of carbon di-
oxide—are suffering profound impacts as the 
world warms. But the species that are most 
likely to replace them, such as maples, are 
not poised to expand their distribution fast 
enough to fully replace the trees that are on 
their way toward dying out. 
‘‘The species that are most abundant there 
are much more vulnerable to climate change 
than I and other scientists had thought,’’ 
said Peter Reich, a lead author of the study 
also published in Nature and a longtime for-
est ecology professor at the University of 
Minnesota. 
If current trends continue, Reich said, 
swaths of boreal forests ‘‘will be impover-
ished, and they might even fall apart or col-
lapse’’ over the next half-century unless 
warming slows. ‘‘The take-home message for 
me is that a large part of boreal forests, one 
of the largest carbon sinks in the world, is 
probably going to take a pretty good hit in 
the next 40, 50 years, even in a best-case sce-
nario,’’ he said. 
That’s disturbing news, because Earth 
needs to gain forests, not lose them, as peo-
ple try to employ every trick in the book to 
get carbon that is in the atmosphere back 
into plants, soils, rocks and even under-
ground storage caverns. 
Reich sees his most recent findings in a 
broader context: While the climate-focused 
legislation expected to pass in Congress this 
week is a positive, the impacts of climate 
change will continue to accelerate, and they 
will require more far-reaching action. 
Reich called the Inflation Reduction Act a 
‘‘good first step’’ but added that ‘‘even in the 
most optimistic scenario, there’s going to be 
a lot of pain and suffering.’’ 
‘‘It’s going to take an economic toll on 
poor and rich alike in the future,’’ he said. 
‘‘We shouldn’t pat ourselves on the back and 
say, ‘Mission accomplished.’ ’’ 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
1 minute to the distinguished gen-
tleman from Texas (Mr. CASTRO). 
Mr. CASTRO of Texas. Mr. Speaker, 
there are a lot of great things in this 
legislation. I want to focus on one 
thing that is important for San Anto-
nio. 
In 2019, my county, Bexar County, 
had the second-highest death toll from 
diabetes. My grandmother died from 
diabetes. My mom is diabetic. I remem-
ber going with my grandmother, and 
she would inject insulin into herself. 
Sometimes she had trouble paying for 
it and spent days, sometimes several 
days, at the hospital. 
There are so many people—senior 
citizens—in this country who will ben-
efit from the fact that we are capping 
insulin costs at $35 a month and pre-
scription drug costs, humble, hard-
working people who don’t ask a lot 
from us or their government but will 
benefit incredibly from this legislation. 
I say thank you to everybody who 
supported it and who is getting it 
across the finish line. It is going to be 
great for the country. 
Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I don’t 
see any other speakers on our side, so 
I yield to the gentleman for his closing, 
and I reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself the balance of my time. 
Mr. Speaker, as we close out this de-
bate, once again, I acknowledge that I 
have been aided on the floor during 
rule debate by the able services of Ra-
chel Huggins, who, unfortunately, is 
leaving my office at the end of this 
month to join the Foreign Service. Our 
loss is the Foreign Service’s gain, but 
she will continue to serve her country 
and serve her country well. We are so 
grateful for her service that she has 
provided in both my office and at the 
Rules Committee. 
Now, despite the name, this bill will 
do very little to reduce inflation. Ac-
cording to an analysis by the Univer-
sity of Pennsylvania Wharton School, 
the bill increases inflation through 2024 
while having an overall negligible ef-
fect. 
You would almost need to be an 
atomic physicist to be able to measure 
on a molecular level how much this is 
going to reduce inflation, but it is 
going to increase Federal spending. We 
know already the increase in Federal 
spending is what lit the fire of inflation 
in the first place. 
This is a bad bill. Reject the previous 
question so we can take up Mr. SMITH’s 
amendment. Reject the underlying bill. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself the balance of my time. 
The decision before us is simple. I 
don’t know what my friends across the 
aisle find so off-putting about making 
historic investments in healthcare, 
cutting costs at pharmacy counters, 
combating climate change, slashing en-
ergy prices, and reducing the Federal 
deficit. Maybe they are just angry that 
we want to lower costs for the Amer-
ican people by making the wealthy pay 
their fair share. Or maybe it is because 
they know that this bill will put their 
Big Pharma and Big Oil buddies on no-
tice. 
Do you know what? I am proud of 
what we are finally doing here. I am 
proud that we are finally allowing drug 
prices to be negotiated to lower those 
costs. I am proud that we are extending 
the biggest expansion in healthcare 
coverage in a decade. I am proud that 
we are reducing future energy costs for 
thousands of families. I am proud that 
we are making the biggest investment 
to combat climate change ever. 
Today, we are putting people over 
politics. People over politics, that is 
what Democrats are about. Today, we 
are delivering. 
I know it took a while to get us to 
this point. It is a testament to the 
President and the Vice President. It is 
a testament to the Speaker of the 
House and to the Democrats on both 
sides of the Capitol that we are finally 
pushing this across the finish line. It is 
a testament to the climate activists,

especially the young people who have 
been fighting for action. It is a testa-
ment to the senior activists, groups 
like AARP, that have been fighting 
tirelessly to get prescription drug costs 
down lower so seniors don’t have to 
choose 
between 
their 
prescription 
drugs and paying their rent or their 
utility bills. 
We have done it. We have moved the 
ball. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my col-
leagues to seize this opportunity before 
us. Vote for this rule and the under-
lying legislation so that the American 
people can truly have a fair shot in the 
21st century. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote on 
the rule and the previous question. 
The material previously referred to 
by Mr. BURGESS is as follows: 
AMENDMENT TO HOUSE RESOLUTION 1316 
Strike all after the resolving clause 
and insert the following: 
That immediately upon adoption of this 
resolution the Speaker shall, pursuant to 
clause 2(b) of rule XVIII, declare the House 
resolved into the Committee of the Whole 
House on the state of the Union for consider-
ation of the Senate amendment to the bill 
{H.R. 5376) to provide for reconciliation pur-
suant to title II of S. Con. Res. 14. The first 
reading of the Senate amendment shall be 
dispensed with. All points of order against 
consideration of the Senate amendment are 
waived. General debate shall be confined to 
the Senate amendment and shall not exceed 
three hours equally divided among and con-
trolled by the respective chairs and ranking 
minority members of the Committees on the 
Budget, Energy and Commerce, and Ways 
and Means, or their respective designees. 
After general debate the Senate amendment 
shall be considered for amendment under the 
five-minute rule. No amendment to the Sen-
ate amendment shall be in order except the 
amendment specified in section 4 of this res-
olution. That amendment may be offered 
only by Representative Smith of Nebraska or 
his designee, shall be considered as read, 
shall be debatable for 10 minutes equally di-
vided and controlled by the proponent and an 
opponent, shall not be subject to amend-
ment, and shall not be subject to a demand 
for division of the question. All points of 
order against that amendment are waived. 
SEC. 2. Upon disposition of the proposed 
House amendment made in order in the first 
section of this resolution, the Committee of 
the Whole shall rise and report the Senate 
amendment to the House with such amend-
ment as may have been adopted. 
SEC. 3. (a) If the Committee of the Whole 
reports the Senate amendment back to the 
House with an amendment, the pending ques-
tion shall be a motion that the House concur 
in the Senate amendment with such amend-
ment. The previous question shall be consid-
ered as ordered on the motion to its adoption 
without intervening motion. 
(b) If the Committee of the Whole reports 
the Senate amendment back to the House 
without amendment or the question of adop-
tion referred to in subsection (a) fails, the 
pending question shall be a motion that the 
House concur in the Senate amendment. The 
previous question shall be considered as or-
dered on the motion to its adoption without 
intervening motion. 
SEC. 4. The amendment referred to in the 
first section of this resolution is as follows: 
In section 10301(1)(A) of the Senate amend-
ment, strike clauses (ii) and (iii). 
In section 10301 of the Senate amendment, 
strike paragraphs (2), (3), (4), and (5). 
SEC. 5. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not 
apply to the consideration of H.R. 5376. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
back the balance of my time, and I 
move the previous question on the res-
olution. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on ordering the previous 
question. 
The question was taken; and the 
Speaker pro tempore announced that 
the ayes appeared to have it. 
Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, on that 
I demand the yeas and nays. 
The yeas and nays were ordered. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to clause 9 of rule XX, the Chair 
will reduce to 5 minutes the minimum 
time for any electronic vote on the 
question of adoption of the resolution. 
The vote was taken by electronic de-
vice, and there were—yeas 219, nays 
208, not voting 3, as follows:

The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the resolution. 
The question was taken; and the 
Speaker pro tempore announced that 
the ayes appeared to have it. 
Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, on that 
I demand the yeas and nays. 
The yeas and nays were ordered. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to clause 8 of rule XX, further pro-
ceedings on this question will be post-
poned. 
REMEMBERING THE LIVES OF THE 
HONORABLE JACKIE WALORSKI, 
EMMA THOMSON, AND ZACHERY 
POTTS 
(Mr. CARSON asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. CARSON. Madam Speaker, I rise 
as the dean of the Indiana delegation, 
and I am joined by my fellow Hoosiers, 
to recognize our fallen colleague, Jack-
ie Walorski, here on the floor. We also 
recognize 
her 
two 
staffers, 
Emma 
Thomson 
and 
Zachery 
Potts, 
who 
passed away with her while serving the 
constituents of the Second Congres-
sional District. 
Hoosiers mourn the loss of a leader 
known for her kindness, dedicated pub-
lic service, and strong work ethic. We 
all stand together to celebrate the gen-
erous spirits of Jackie, Emma, and 
Zach, and their lives of public service. 
We also lift up their families as they 
deal with this tragic loss. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to my col-
league from Indiana (Mr. BANKS). 
Mr. BANKS. Madam Speaker, yester-
day, many of us celebrated the life of 
Jackie Walorski at the funeral in her 
district. Today, we honor her life on 
the floor of the House of Representa-
tives, where she served for nearly a 
decade. 
Jackie was a giant in Indiana poli-
tics, and she had a giant impact here in 
this institution, as well. Her lifetime of 
public service will be long-remembered, 
from her time on the mission field in 
Romania, to her time at the Indiana 
Statehouse, to the time that she spent 
serving our Nation here with all of us. 
She embodied public service and put-
ting others before herself. Her legacy, 
fighting for the unborn, for our vet-
erans, and for the poor and disabled, is 
a legacy that we will honor here for a 
long time to come. 
We also honor the lives of Zachery 
Potts and Emma Thomson, two staffers 
who should remind all of us of the sac-
rifices that our staffs make to serve 
each of us in our important roles. 
I also want to say to the family of 
Edith Schmucker, who was involved in 
this tragedy as well, that we honor her 
life, the life of your loved ones, as well. 
Tragedies like this one remind us of 
how fleeting and fragile our lives really 
are. But Jackie’s life reminds us that 
we should live it to the fullest, just as 
she did, and that is how we can honor 
her best. 
f 
ANNOUNCEMENT BY THE SPEAKER 
The SPEAKER. The Chair asks all 
Members present in the Chamber, as 
well as Members and staff throughout 
the Capitol, to please rise for a mo-
ment of silence in remembrance of the

ana, along with her staff members, 
Zachery Potts and Emma Thomson.

such list. 
‘‘(B) IF NOT LICENSED AND MARKETED DURING 
THE INITIAL DELAY.— 
‘‘(i) IN GENERAL.—If, during the time period 
between the selected drug publication date on

included on the list as a selected drug pursuant 
to subsection (a) but for subparagraph (A) and 
the selected drug publication date with respect 
to the initial price applicability year that is 1 
year after the initial price applicability year for 
which such biological product would have been

for which the Secretary previously made a high 
likelihood determination under paragraph (3)) 
has not been licensed and marketed under sec-
tion 351(k) of the Public Health Service Act, the 
Secretary shall, at the request of such manufac-
turer—

‘‘(II) evaluate whether, on the basis of clear 
and convincing evidence, the manufacturer of 
such biosimilar biological product has made a 
significant amount of progress (as determined by 
the Secretary) towards both such licensure and 
the marketing of such biosimilar biological prod-
uct (based on information from items described 
in subclauses (I)(bb) and (II) of paragraph 
(1)(B)(ii)) since the receipt by the Secretary of 
the request made by such manufacturer under 
paragraph (1)(B)(i)(I). 
‘‘(ii) SELECTION AND NEGOTIATION.—If the Sec-
retary determines that there is not a high likeli-
hood that such biosimilar biological product will

‘‘(I) the Secretary shall include the biological 
product as a selected drug on the list published 
under subsection (a) with respect to the initial 
price applicability year that is 1 year after the 
initial price applicability year for which such 
biological product would have been included as 
a selected drug on such list but for subpara-
graph (A); and

with respect to the year for which such manu-
facturer would have provided access to a max-
imum fair price for such biological product but 
for subparagraph (A). 
‘‘(iii) SECOND 1-YEAR DELAY.—If the Secretary 
determines that there is a high likelihood that 
such biosimilar biological product will be li-
censed and marketed (as described in clause 
(i)(I)) and a significant amount of progress has 
been made by the manufacturer of such bio-
similar biological product towards such licen-
sure and marketing (as described in clause 
(i)(II)), the Secretary shall delay the inclusion 
of the biological product as a selected drug on 
the list published under subsection (a) until the

publication date with respect to the initial price 
applicability year that is 2 years after the initial 
price applicability year for which such biologi-
cal product would have been included as a se-
lected drug on such list but for this subsection, 
the Secretary determines that such biosimilar bi-
ological product has not been licensed and mar-
keted— 
‘‘(i) the Secretary shall include such biological 
product as a selected drug on such list with re-
spect to the initial price applicability year that 
is 2 years after the initial price applicability 
year for which such biological product would

Secretary delay the inclusion of a biological 
product on the list published under subsection 
(a) for more than 2 years. 
‘‘(ii) EXCLUSION
OF
BIOLOGICAL
PRODUCTS 
THAT TRANSITIONED TO A LONG-MONOPOLY DRUG 
DURING THE DELAY.—In the case of a biological 
product for which the inclusion on the list pub-
lished pursuant to subsection (a) was delayed 
by 1 year under subparagraph (A) and for 
which there would have been a change in status 
to a long-monopoly drug (as defined in section 
1194(c)(5)) if such biological product had been a 
selected drug, in no case may the Secretary pro-
vide for a second 1-year delay under subpara-
graph (B)(iii). 
‘‘(iii) EXCLUSION OF BIOLOGICAL PRODUCTS IF 
MORE THAN 1 YEAR SINCE LICENSURE.—In no case 
shall the Secretary delay the inclusion of a bio-
logical product on the list published under sub-
section (a) if more than 1 year has elapsed since 
the biosimilar biological product has been li-
censed under section 351(k) of the Public Health 
Service Act and marketing has not commenced 
for such biosimilar biological product. 
‘‘(iv) CERTAIN MANUFACTURERS OF BIOSIMILAR 
BIOLOGICAL
PRODUCTS
EXCLUDED.—In no case 
shall the Secretary delay the inclusion of a bio-
logical product as a selected drug on the list 
published under subsection (a) if Secretary de-
termined that the manufacturer of the biosimilar 
biological 
product 
described 
in 
paragraph 
(1)(A)— 
‘‘(I) is the same as the manufacturer of the 
reference product described in such paragraph 
or is treated as being the same pursuant to 
paragraph (1)(C); or

scribed in paragraph (1)(B)(ii)(I)(bb), entered 
into any agreement described in such paragraph 
with the manufacturer of the reference product 
described in paragraph (1)(A) that— 
‘‘(aa) requires or incentivizes the manufac-
turer of the biosimilar biological product to sub-
mit a request described in paragraph (1)(B); or 
‘‘(bb) restricts the quantity (either directly or 
indirectly) of the biosimilar biological product 
that may be sold in the United States over a 
specified period of time. 
‘‘(3) HIGH LIKELIHOOD.—For purposes of this 
subsection, there is a high likelihood described 
in paragraph (1) or paragraph (2), as applica-
ble, if the Secretary finds that— 
‘‘(A) an application for licensure under sec-
tion 351(k) of the Public Health Service Act for 
the biosimilar biological product has been ac-
cepted for review or approved by the Food and 
Drug Administration; and 
‘‘(B) information from items described in sub 
clauses (I)(bb) and (III) of paragraph (1)(B)(ii) 
submitted to the Secretary by the manufacturer 
requesting a delay under such paragraph pro-
vides clear and convincing evidence that such 
biosimilar biological product will, within the 
time period specified under paragraph (1)(A) or 
(2)(B)(i)(I), be marketed.

‘payment amount benchmark period’ were de-
fined under subsection (g)(3) as the first cal-
endar year beginning after the day on which 
the drug was first marketed and subparagraph 
(B) of paragraph (3) shall be applied as if the 
term ‘benchmark period CPI–U’ were defined 
under subsection (g)(4) as if the reference to 
‘January 2021’ under such subsection were a ref-
erence to ‘January of the first year beginning 
after the date on which the drug was first mar-
keted’.

‘‘(i) IN
GENERAL.—In the case of a part D 
rebatable drug that is a line extension of a part

form, the Secretary shall establish a formula for 
determining the rebate amount under paragraph 
(1) and the inflation adjusted payment amount 
under paragraph (3) with respect to such part D 
rebatable drug and an applicable period, con-
sistent with the formula applied under sub-
section (c)(2)(C) of section 1927 for determining 
a rebate obligation for a rebate period under 
such section. 
‘‘(ii) LINE EXTENSION DEFINED.—In this sub-
paragraph, the term ‘line extension’ means, with 
respect to a part D rebatable drug, a new formu-
lation of the drug, such as an extended release 
formulation, but does not include an abuse-de-
terrent formulation of the drug (as determined 
by the Secretary), regardless of whether such 
abuse-deterrent formulation is an extended re-
lease formulation.

D rebatable drug that is a selected drug (as de-
fined in section 1192(c)) with respect to a price 
applicability period (as defined in section

considered to be a selected drug under section 
1192(c), for each applicable period (as defined 
under subsection (g)(7)) beginning after the 
price applicability period with respect to such 
drug, subparagraphs (A) and (B) of paragraph 
(4) shall be applied as if the term ‘payment 
amount benchmark period’ were defined under 
subsection (g)(3) as the last year beginning dur-
ing such price applicability period with respect 
to such selected drug and subparagraph (B) of 
paragraph (3) shall be applied as if the term 
‘benchmark period CPI–U’ were defined under 
subsection (g)(4) as if the reference to ‘January 
2021’ under such subsection were a reference to 
‘January of the last year beginning during such 
price applicability period with respect to such 
drug’. 
‘‘(6) RECONCILIATION IN CASE OF REVISED IN-
FORMATION.—The Secretary shall provide for a 
method and process under which, in the case 
where a PDP sponsor of a prescription drug 
plan or an MA organization offering an MA–PD 
plan submits revisions to the number of units of 
a rebatable covered part D drug dispensed, the 
Secretary determines, pursuant to such revi-
sions, adjustments, if any, to the calculation of 
the amount specified in this subsection for a 
dosage form and strength with respect to such 
part D rebatable drug and an applicable period 
and reconciles any overpayments or underpay-
ments in amounts paid as rebates under this 
subsection. Any identified underpayment shall 
be rectified by the manufacturer not later than 
30 days after the date of receipt from the Sec-
retary of information on such underpayment. 
‘‘(c) REBATE DEPOSITS.—Amounts paid as re-
bates under subsection (b) shall be deposited

tion submitted by—

‘‘(3) PDP sponsors of prescription drug plans 
and MA organization offering MA–PD plans 
under this part. 
‘‘(e) CIVIL MONEY PENALTY.—If a manufac-
turer of a part D rebatable drug has failed to 
comply with the requirement under subsection 
(a)(2) with respect to such drug for an applica-
ble period, the manufacturer shall be subject to 
a civil money penalty in an amount equal to 125 
percent of the amount specified in subsection (b) 
for such drug for such period. The provisions of 
section 1128A (other than subsections (a) (with 
respect to amounts of penalties or additional as-
sessments) and (b)) shall apply to a civil money 
penalty under this subsection in the same man-
ner as such provisions apply to a penalty or 
proceeding under section 1128A(a). 
‘‘(f) LIMITATION ON ADMINISTRATIVE OR JUDI-
CIAL REVIEW.—There shall be no administrative 
or judicial review of any of the following: 
‘‘(1) The determination of units under this 
section.

MOTION TO CONCUR 
Mr. YARMUTH. Mr. Speaker, I have 
a motion at the desk. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Clerk will designate the motion. 
The text of the motion is as follows: 
Mr. YARMUTH moves that the House concur 
in the Senate amendment to H.R. 5376. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to House Resolution 1316, the mo-
tion shall be debatable for 3 hours 
equally divided among and controlled 
by the respective chairs and ranking 
minority members of the Committees 
on the Budget, Energy and Commerce, 
and Ways and Means, or their respec-
tive designees. 
The gentleman from Kentucky (Mr. 
YARMUTH), the gentleman from Mis-
souri (Mr. SMITH), the gentleman from 
New Jersey (Mr. PALLONE), the gentle-
woman from Washington (Mrs. ROD-
GERS), the gentleman from Massachu-
setts (Mr. NEAL), and the gentleman 
from Texas (Mr. BRADY) each will con-
trol 30 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from Kentucky. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. YARMUTH. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
have 5 legislative days within which to 
revise and extend their remarks and in-
sert 
extraneous 
material 
into 
the 
RECORD on the Senate amendment to 
H.R. 5376. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Kentucky? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. YARMUTH. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, the legislation before us 
today is a big deal for American fami-
lies and a big deal for our planet. 
The Inflation Reduction Act will 
lower healthcare costs and energy 
costs for American families. It will 
allow Medicare to negotiate lower pre-
scription drug prices and cap drug 
costs for seniors, saving many Medi-
care beneficiaries hundreds, if not 
thousands, of dollars each year. 
This legislation finally makes the 
biggest corporations start paying their 
fair share in taxes, and it ensures that 
rich tax cheats start paying what they 
owe. 
The Inflation Reduction Act is fis-
cally responsible, fully paid for, and 
has been strongly endorsed by top U.S. 
economists across the political spec-
trum. 
Not one American family making 
less than $400,000 a year will see their 
Federal tax bill increased by this legis-
lation, not by a penny. 
The Inflation Reduction Act is also 
the biggest investment the U.S. Gov-
ernment has ever made to combat cli-
mate change. It leapfrogs us ahead of 
nearly every other country in terms of 
our commitment to tackling this cri-
sis. 
Now, we have seen a lot of Repub-
licans spreading misinformation about 
this legislation, and it is for one reason 
and one reason only: They are scared. 
They know the provisions of this bill 
are overwhelmingly popular, yet be-
cause they consider it a Democratic 
bill, every single one of them will be 
voting against it. This is a crystal- 
clear example of Republicans putting 
party before country. 
Just look at the numbers. 
Mr. Speaker, 77 percent of Americans 
support placing caps on prescription 
drug prices to lower healthcare costs. 
That is a key component of this bill. 
Mr. Speaker, 83 percent of Americans 
support allowing Medicare to negotiate 
drug prices to make healthcare more 
affordable. That is another key compo-
nent of this bill. 
Two-thirds of Americans think the 
government should do more to combat 
climate change. This bill takes on cli-
mate change with the urgency it de-
serves. 
By opposing this bill, Republicans 
are making it very clear where they 
stand: not with the American people, 
not with their priorities or needs, but 
with Big Pharma, with corporate lob-
byists, with tax cheats. 
The American people are on our side. 
They want this bill. Today, in a huge 
victory for them, we will send it to the 
President’s desk to be signed into law. 
Let me remind my Republican col-
leagues what they are voting against. 
They are voting against cutting pre-
scription drug prices for their constitu-
ents—in many cases, for lifesaving 
medication. They are voting against 
combating inflation and lowering en-
ergy costs when American families are 
desperate for us to take action. They 
are voting against providing the larg-
est Federal investment ever to combat 
the climate crisis and its life-threat-
ening consequences. 
I could not be more proud that I will 
not only be voting ‘‘yes’’ on this bill 
but that this historic legislation will 
bear my name. 
With or without Republican support, 
today, we will make a real difference. 
We will use the power of the Federal 
Government to make American lives 
better and our country and planet 
safer. In other words, we will do our 
job. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. SMITH of Missouri. Mr. Speaker, 
I yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Mr. Speaker, before I begin, I will 
take a moment to recognize our col-
league, Jackie Walorski. We come back 
to the Capitol with very heavy hearts. 
Just over a week ago, we lost Jackie 
and two of her staffers, Emma Thom-
son and Zachery Potts, while they were 
in their public service. 
I was lucky enough to serve with 
Jackie on the Ways and Means Com-
mittee and worked with her numerous 
hours. I know that the Ways and Means 
Committee will miss her dearly. The 
people of this body will miss her dear-
ly. I know that the people of Indiana 
will miss her very dearly. 
Mr. Speaker, I will say that Jackie 
was one of the hardest working public 
servants that I have ever met, and 
when she gave you her word, it was 
written and carved in stone. For that, 
she will always be in our hearts. 
Mr. Speaker, as we turn to the legis-
lation before us today, this week, we 
found out inflation remains at a 40- 
year high, having risen 13.7 percent 
since Biden became President. Real 
wages have decreased by 4.5 percent. 
Americans are suffering. Are we here 
debating how to alleviate that suf-
fering? No. We are debating what 
Democrats call the Inflation Reduction 
Act, which everyone from the Congres-
sional Budget Office to 230 different 
economists—even 
Senator 
BERNIE 
SANDERS—says will not actually reduce 
inflation. 
b 1200 
When you strip away the fake sunset 
policies, this bill spends $745 billion 
and adds $146 billion to our debt. It 
adds $54 billion worth of debt just in 
the first 5 years, and 80 percent of their 
‘‘budget deficits’’ don’t even begin 
until after the year 2029. 
So lots of spending up front, lots of 
debt up front, and then maybe savings 
8 years from now. How is that going to 
put out the fire of inflation when the 
price of groceries is up 13.1 percent 
over the past year? 
Senators MANCHIN and SCHUMER, Sec-
retary Yellen, and former President 
Obama are all on record saying you 
don’t raise taxes during a recession. 
But that is exactly what this bill does. 
It includes $599 billion in new taxes and 
budget gimmicks. Half of the tax bur-
den falls on taxpayers making less 
than $400,000 a year. 
The choice this bill puts in front of 
families making less than $200,000 is 
clear. Put the government at the cen-
ter of your healthcare decisions or face 
a $10 billion tax burden. But it gets 
worse. This bill doubles the size of the 
IRS. It doubles the size of the IRS, so 
it can target and audit more middle- 
class families and snoop into their 
bank accounts. I am not sure how sub-
jecting 
Americans 
to 
more 
audits 
solves the inflation crisis. 
Mr. Speaker, in my home State of 
Missouri, this bill would quadruple the 
number of audits, 18,000 more audits on 
hardworking Americans who make less 
than $200,000 a year. Of course, that is 
not the only point of this bill. This is 
about Democrats’ Green New Deal 
agenda. 
My colleagues on the other side will 
come down here today not to talk

about inflation, not to talk about gas 
prices but to instead talk about the 
hundreds of billions of dollars that is 
being spent on radical environmental 
projects. And you know what, they will 
be exactly right. 
Half of the spending—over $400 bil-
lion—goes to things like: 
$3.4 billion for tree equity. Tree eq-
uity, that surely is going to bring down 
gas prices; 
$7.5 billion for new luxury electric ve-
hicles in tax credits for families who 
make up to $300,000 a year. That should 
definitely curtail inflation; 
$27 billion for a national climate 
bank slush fund at the EPA. That 
should definitely help our supply chain 
crisis; 
A $362 million handout to corporate 
America to make their office buildings 
much greener. That will definitely help 
secure our southern border. 
Mr. Speaker, Democrats believe they 
can spend their way out of inflation 
and tax their way out of a recession. It 
will only make the suffering Ameri-
cans face today that much worse. 
This bill is simple. It is welfare for 
the wealthy environmentalists and big 
corporations, paid for by increased 
taxes and audits on middle- and low-in-
come taxpayers. These hardworking 
Americans are the ones that have been 
forgotten under the one-party Demo-
crat rule in Washington. The Wash-
ington and wealthy elites win again. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. YARMUTH. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
2 minutes to the gentlewoman from 
Massachusetts (Ms. CLARK), the Assist-
ant Speaker. 
Ms. CLARK of Massachusetts. Mr. 
Speaker, I thank the chairman for 
yielding. 
Mr. Speaker, this is exactly what the 
American people need. It lowers costs, 
it creates great-paying jobs, and it 
makes our communities safer by ad-
dressing the lethal effects of climate 
change. 
Seniors won’t have to choose between 
putting food on the table and paying 
for their prescription drugs; 
More families are going to be able to 
afford healthcare; 
Homes and cars will be more afford-
able and efficient; 
U.S. companies will be able to create 
great-paying jobs and lead the clean 
technology revolution; 
Billionaires and corporations will fi-
nally have to pay their fair share while 
working people will have more money 
in their pockets; 
Costs will be lower, water will be 
cleaner, green jobs will be plentiful, 
and our future will be brighter. 
In every way, this game-changing bill 
moves America forward. Democrats are 
lowering costs for everyday Americans. 
We are standing up to special interests 
who have blocked cutting the cost of 
prescription drugs over and over again 
and America’s critical transition to 
clean energy. 
We are rebuilding a stronger, greener 
economy. We are infusing the tax sys-
tem with fairness. This is a win for the 
American public. This is a win for peo-
ple over politics. 
Mr. SMITH of Missouri. Mr. Speaker, 
I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman 
from the great State of Iowa (Mrs. 
HINSON). 
Mrs. HINSON. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today in opposition to this so-called In-
flation Reduction Act. 
Last year, we warned that spending 
trillions of dollars would cause prices 
to spike but Democrats did it anyway— 
ramming 
through 
a 
trillion-dollar 
Washington pork buffet, sticking fami-
lies with the bill. 
Now, Speaker PELOSI is arguing for 
yet another tax-and-spending spree, 
wasting hundreds of billions of tax-
payer dollars on Green New Deal prior-
ities and raising taxes on middle-class 
families. 
This will worsen inflation. It sics the 
IRS on hardworking Iowans—adding 
87,000 new IRS agents to target tax-
payers. 
Iowans are begging for us to get 
prices down, but instead, this bill takes 
more of their hard-earned paychecks. 
And for what? So the wealthy can get 
a discount on their electric vehicles? 
So we can increase bureaucracy at the 
EPA to impose new regulations on our 
farmers? 
Mr. Speaker, this bill ignores the 
pain that Iowans are feeling. It is the 
worst policy at the worst possible time. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge a ‘‘no’’ vote on 
this latest tax-and-spending spree. 
Mr. YARMUTH. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
2 minutes to the gentleman from New 
York (Mr. JEFFRIES), the Democratic 
Caucus 
chair, 
and 
a 
distinguished 
member of the Budget Committee. 
Mr. JEFFRIES. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the distinguished chair for yielding and 
for his leadership. 
Mr. Speaker, we are once again get-
ting big things done for everyday 
Americans. 
We passed the American Rescue Plan, 
saved the economy, put shots in arms, 
money in pockets, and kids back in 
school. 
We passed the Infrastructure Invest-
ment and Jobs Act to fix our crumbling 
infrastructure and create millions of 
good-paying jobs. 
We passed gun safety legislation for 
the first time in 30 years that will save 
lives. 
We passed the CHIPS and Science 
Act that will bring back domestic man-
ufacturing jobs to the United States of 
America. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong 
support of the Inflation Reduction Act, 
another transformative bill brought to 
you by your friendly neighborhood 
Democratic Party. 
The Inflation Reduction Act will 
lower energy costs; confront the cli-
mate crisis with the fierce urgency of 
now; set our planet forward on a sus-
tainable trajectory; lower healthcare 
costs by strengthening the Affordable 
Healthcare Act, as well as reducing the 
deficit by $300 billion, and giving Medi-
care the ability to use its bulk-price 
purchasing power to drive down the 
high cost of lifesaving prescription 
drugs. 
It is a big F-ing deal. 
The Inflation Reduction Act is going 
to dramatically improve the lives of 
everyday Americans. We are putting 
people over politics. Fighting to lower 
costs for safer communities and better 
paying jobs. 
My colleagues on the other side of 
the aisle, Republicans, will oppose this 
groundbreaking 
legislation. 
They 
would rather defend Donald Trump 
than defend the American people. 
Vote ‘‘yes’’ on the Inflation Reduc-
tion Act so we can continue to put peo-
ple over politics. 
Mr. SMITH of Missouri. Mr. Speaker, 
I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from 
Virginia (Mr. CLINE). 
Mr. CLINE. Mr. Speaker, I thank the 
gentleman for yielding. 
Mr. Speaker, we know the real story. 
We know what happened a year and a 
half ago when the so-called American 
Rescue Plan was passed—40-year high 
inflation rates resulted. We see now 
what the result is from the Build Back 
Better plan that had no chance of pas-
sage in the Senate. This is the off-
spring of Build Back Better. 
Even BERNIE
SANDERS, a socialist 
who can come up with a million flawed 
excuses to spend your tax dollars, says 
he can’t find a way to even say this 
would reduce inflation one iota. 
We know that instead of fostering 
American 
energy 
independence, 
in-
creasing purchasing power for the 
American family, and reducing infla-
tion, this bill includes: 
$16.5 billion in higher taxes for those 
making less than $200,000 a year; 
$38 billion in new taxes on American 
oil and gas producers, which will be 
passed along to consumers in the form 
of even higher costs for heating homes 
and gas prices, and; 
$480 billion in tax hikes that will hit 
workers through slashed wages. 
Half the bill is Green New Deal cli-
mate change special interest funding, 
including taxpayer-funded subsidies on 
electric vehicle purchases, and; 
$80 billion to double the size of the 
IRS, creating an army of new enforce-
ment agents. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge a ‘‘no’’ vote on 
this horrible legislation. 
Mr. YARMUTH. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
1 minute to the gentlewoman from New 
York (Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY), the 
distinguished chair of the Committee 
on Oversight and Reform. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Mr. Speaker, as chair of the 
Committee on Oversight and Reform, I 
rise in strong, strong support of the In-
flation Reduction Act. 
My committee conducted a 3-year in-
vestigation of prescription drug prices. 
Our findings overwhelmingly support 
the need for this bill’s reforms to curb 
the drug industry’s outrageous pricing 
practices and make prescription drugs 
more affordable for patients and tax-
payers.

These reforms include empowering 
Medicare to negotiate prices for cer-
tain drugs, a step that is long overdue. 
My committee’s investigation into 
the fossil fuel industry showed that Big 
Oil is refusing to take adequate steps 
to cut emissions, even though burning 
fossil fuels is a primary driver of the 
climate crisis. This bill will finally 
bring down emissions from fossil fuels, 
helping our environment. 
I am proud to have championed other 
provisions in the bill, including a his-
toric investment of $3 billion to elec-
trify the Postal Service delivery fleet. 
This will replace tens of thousands of 
gas-guzzling trucks with clean, electric 
vehicles, helping our environment. 
Mr. Speaker, I am honored to cast 
my vote for the Inflation Reduction 
Act today. 
Mr. Speaker, as Chairwoman of the Com-
mittee on Oversight and Reform, I rise in sup-
port of the Inflation Reduction Act. 
My Committee conducted a three-year in-
vestigation of prescription drug pricing. Our 
findings overwhelmingly support the need for 
this bill’s reforms to curb the drug industry’s 
outrageous pricing practices and make pre-
scription drugs more affordable for patients

I’m also proud to have championed other 
provisions in this bill, including a historic in-
vestment of $3 billion to electrify the Postal 
Service delivery fleet. This will replace tens of 
thousands of gas-guzzling trucks with clean 
electric vehicles. 
I am honored to cast my vote for the Infla-
tion Reduction Act today. 
Mr. SMITH of Missouri. Mr. Speaker, 
I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from 
Iowa (Mr. FEENSTRA). 
Mr. 
FEENSTRA. 
Mr. 
Speaker, 
I 
thank Ranking Member SMITH
for 
yielding. 
Mr. Speaker, I would just quickly 
note that I am highly offended by the 
use of the foul language by my Demo-
crat colleague. That is completely un-
acceptable. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong 
opposition to the Democrats’ inflation 
expansion act. This wasteful bill is full 
of liberal priorities that will continue 
to fuel inflation, raise taxes on hard-
working families, and create an army 
of 87,000 IRS agents that will go after 
our families and small businesses. 
Democrats claim that only large cor-
porations will be the target of these 
IRS agents. That is factually false. 
Families and small businesses, who 
don’t have the time or the resources, 
will undergo these invasive audits and 
will bear the brunt of these IRS agents. 
This radical bill will also supercharge 
the Democrats’ Green New Deal agenda 
without making our country energy 
independent again. 
In fact, they would rather import 
dirty foreign oil from Venezuela than 
unleash America’s energy independ-
ence. Sadly, that is the state of today’s 
Democratic Party and their failed lib-
eral agenda. 
Mr. Speaker, as a strong fiscal con-
servative, I urge my colleagues to op-
pose this bill. 
Mr. YARMUTH. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
1 minute to the gentleman from Vir-
ginia (Mr. SCOTT), the distinguished 
chairman of the Committee on Edu-
cation and Labor, and a member of the 
Budget Committee. 
Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, 
with the passage of this bill, Medicare 
will finally be able to negotiate for 
lower drug prices. The bill extends the 
American Rescue Plan’s reduction in 
the cost of insurance under the Afford-
able Care Act, which has helped us 
reach the lowest number of uninsured 
people ever. 
The bill will make the largest ever 
investment to address climate change. 
I am especially pleased with the bill’s 
provisions to turbocharge the develop-
ment of offshore wind. 
As chairman of the Committee on 
Education and Labor, I am encouraged 
by the permanent extension of the 
black lung excise tax. The extension 
will fund future benefits in healthcare 
for miners in southwest Virginia and 
across coal country who are suffering 
from black lung disease. Extending the 
tax will protect the long-term sustain-
ability of the Black Lung Disability 
Trust Fund by ensuring that the coal 
industry does not shift the cost of ben-
efits from coal companies to miners, 
families, or the taxpayer. All of this 
while 
simultaneously 
reducing 
the 
Federal deficit. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support the legislation. 
b 1215 
Mr. SMITH of Missouri. Mr. Speaker, 
I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman 
from Colorado. 
Mrs. BOEBERT. Mr. Speaker, insan-
ity is doing the same thing repeatedly 
and expecting a different result. That 
makes the supporters of this legisla-
tion, by definition, insane. 
Reckless spending in this town is 
what causes inflation. We cannot con-
tinue to increase taxes on the Amer-
ican people and put a target on Amer-
ican energy production while spending 
a historic $370 billion on Green New 
Deal initiatives and expect to lower in-
flation and improve our economy. 
Remember that so-called bipartisan 
infrastructure bill? We spent $200 bil-
lion on Green New Deal initiatives. I 
guess that was just a downpayment on 
this never-ending theft of American 
tax dollars. You are sacrificing Amer-
ican families at the altar of climate 
change. 
Mr. Speaker, isn’t it so? Joe Biden 
himself said the inflation rate is at 
zero percent. What the heck are we 
doing here? Why are we passing this so- 
called Inflation Reduction Act if it is 
at zero percent? 
In fact, it is the inflation enhance-
ment act, and it does the exact oppo-
site of what Americans need right now. 
This is just another con game by the 
Democrats calling something one thing 
and saying another. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentlewoman has expired. 
Mr. SMITH of Missouri. Mr. Speaker, 
I yield an additional 30 seconds to the 
gentlewoman from Colorado. 
Mrs. BOEBERT. Mr. Speaker, this 
bill hires 87,000 new IRS agents, and 
they are armed. The job description 
tells them that they need to be re-
quired to carry a firearm and expect to 
use deadly force if necessary. 
Excessive taxation is theft. The 
chairman said that we are using the 
power of the Federal Government in 
this bill. You are darn right you are. 
You are using the power of the Federal 
Government for armed robbery on the 
taxpayers. I can see why this was 
rushed through committee and put on 
the floor. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentlewoman has again ex-
pired. 
The gentlewoman is no longer recog-
nized. 
Mr. YARMUTH. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I will say in response to 
the gentlewoman from Colorado (Mrs. 
BOEBERT) that this is typical of what 
the Republicans are doing. 
First of all, they are making up num-
bers. There is nowhere anywhere that 
shows that 87,000 new IRS agents are 
going to be hired in this bill. That is a 
totally fabricated number. The idea 
that they are armed—I know that Mrs. 
BOEBERT would like everybody to be 
armed, as they are in her restaurant, 
but that is not what IRS agents do. 
Mr. Speaker, I would implore my Re-
publican colleagues to cut out the 
scare tactics, quit making things up, 
and debate the substance of this bill. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the 
gentleman 
from 
California 
(Mr. 
PETERS), a distinguished member of the 
Budget Committee. 
Mr. PETERS. Mr. Speaker, today, we 
write a bold new chapter in our history 
by passing the Inflation Reduction Act, 
which will substantially lower the cost 
of living for San Diegans and all Amer-
icans. 
We are turning our climate ambition 
into climate action by establishing a 
methane fee to reduce harmful emis-
sions, creating a clean energy tech-
nology bank, and funding wildfire resil-
iency efforts and clean energy infra-
structure. 
Together, these investments will cut 
our greenhouse gas emissions by 40 per-
cent by 2030 and create 1.5 million 
good-paying jobs. 
This legislation is also the largest 
downpayment in deficit reduction since 
I have served in Congress. Importantly, 
the drug pricing reform framework I 
helped author will help seniors at the 
drug counter and protect private-sector 
innovation, and it has earned enough 
votes to pass the Senate.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H7649 
August 12, 2022 
The Inflation Reduction Act is a his-
toric measure. After months of nego-
tiations and hard work, let’s finally get 
this done. Vote ‘‘yes.’’ 
Mr. SMITH of Missouri. Mr. Speaker, 
I include in the RECORD notice from the 
Congressional Budget Office that we re-
ceived just this morning, as a matter of 
fact. Yes, the bill in front of us and the 
numbers it claims does include addi-
tional audits on individuals making 
less than $400,000 a year. 
CBO has received a number of questions re-
garding our estimate of an amendment of-
fered by Senator Crapo during the floor de-
bate on H.R. 5376 last weekend. That amend-
ment, #5404, would limit the use of addi-
tional funds for the Internal Revenue Serv-
ice. If the amendment had been adopted none 
of the additional funds could have been used 
to audit taxpayers with taxable incomes 
below $400,000. 
CBO did not complete a formal cost esti-
mate in advance of consideration of the 
amendment but the agency did provide the 
following information to the Senate Budget 
Committee: 
CBO estimates that the amendment 5404 
would have the following effects: 
No effect on outlays in the one or ten year 
budget windows; would reduce outlays in the 
five year budget window. 
No effect on revenues in the one year budg-
et window; would reduce the ‘‘non-scorable’’ 
revenues resulting from the provisions of 
section 10301 in the five and ten year budget 
windows. 
No effect on outlays after 2031 but would 
decrease the ‘‘non-scorable’’ revenue result-
ing from the provisions of section 10301 after 
2031. 
CBO has not completed a point estimate of 
this amendment but the preliminary assess-
ment indicates that amendment 5404 would 
reduce the ‘‘non-scorable’’ revenues resulting 
from the provisions of section 10301 by at 
least $20 billion over the FY2022–FY2031 pe-
riod. 
Thanks, 
LEIGH ANGRES, 
Director of Legislative Affairs 
Congressional Budget Office. 
Mr. SMITH of Missouri. Mr. Speaker, 
I yield 11⁄2 minutes to the gentleman 
from California (Mr. MCCLINTOCK). 
Mr. MCCLINTOCK. Mr. Speaker, the 
Democrats printed and spent trillions 
of dollars we didn’t have, and they un-
leashed the worst inflation in 40 years. 
They waged war on capitalism and the 
energy industry and produced an eco-
nomic recession. 
Now, they are doubling down on 
these foolish policies. The more that 
some people invest in their mistakes, 
the less willing they are to admit 
them. 
They are adding 87,000 new IRS 
agents—that is larger than the entire 
population of Flint, Michigan—in order 
to collect $200 billion in new taxes, 
mostly from middle-class families and 
shopkeepers who don’t have the re-
sources to contest expensive audits. 
They are adding $300 billion in new 
corporate taxes, which will be passed 
on to families as higher prices, lower 
wages, and lower returns. 
All of this is to give away three-quar-
ters of a trillion dollars more of your 
earnings to their green energy cronies 
and other political supporters. That 
averages about $6,000 per household. 
Just as you cannot drink yourself 
sober, you cannot spend your way out 
of inflation, or tax yourself out of re-
cession, or borrow your way out of 
debt. Yet, that is exactly what the 
Democrats claim they can do. What 
makes them think socialism will work 
any better here than everywhere else 
in the world that it has been tried? 
This bill takes our country further 
into this dismal future, and only more 
suffering and poverty will come of it. 
Mr. YARMUTH. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
1 minute to the gentleman from Michi-
gan (Mr. KILDEE), a distinguished mem-
ber of the Budget Committee. 
Mr. KILDEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in 
support of the Inflation Reduction Act 
to help fight inflation and lower costs 
for the Michigan families and seniors 
that I represent. 
With this bill, we will be able to 
lower healthcare costs for Michigan 
families and seniors. This bill will 
allow Medicare to negotiate the cost of 
prescription drugs, including capping 
the cost of insulin for seniors at $35 a 
month. 
With this bill, we will create good- 
paying jobs to combat the climate cri-
sis. This bill will invest in domestic 
clean energy production and manufac-
turing facilities to lower costs. It will 
support making solar panels at compa-
nies like Hemlock Semiconductor and 
electric vehicles in Michigan, not in 
China. 
With this bill, which is fully paid for, 
we will ensure the biggest corporations 
and the wealthiest individuals pay 
their fair share of taxes. Right now, 55 
of the Nation’s biggest corporations 
pay zero in Federal taxes while making 
billions in profits. A Flint nurse, a 
Saginaw farmer, or a Bay City teacher 
should not pay more in taxes than the 
largest, wealthiest, most profitable 
corporations. 
Mr. Speaker, I support this legisla-
tion. 
Mr. SMITH of Missouri. Mr. Speaker, 
I include in the RECORD a letter from 
the nonpartisan Congressional Budget 
Office, which confirmed that this bill 
will raise the cost of new prescription 
drugs for all Americans. 
U.S. CONGRESS, 
CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET OFFICE, 
Washington, DC, August 4, 2022. 
Re Additional Information About Prescrip-
tion Drug Legislation. 
Hon. JASON SMITH, 
Ranking Member, Committee on the Budget, 
House of Representatives, Washington, DC. 
DEAR CONGRESSMAN: This letter provides 
additional information that you and your 
colleagues requested about subtitle I of the 
reconciliation recommendations of the Sen-
ate Committee on Finance regarding pre-
scription drug legislation. You asked about 
how provisions involving inflation rebates 
and the negotiation of drug prices would af-
fect launch prices for new drugs and the in-
troduction of new generic drugs. You also 
asked how a provision to stabilize premiums 
as a part of the redesign of Medicare’s bene-
fits would affect the federal budget and pre-
miums. 
EFFECT OF THE INFLATION-REBATE AND 
NEGOTIATION PROVISIONS ON LAUNCH PRICES 
The Congressional Budget Office projects 
that the inflation-rebate and negotiation 
provisions would increase the launch prices 
for drugs that are not yet on the market rel-
ative to what such prices would be other-
wise. That effect would primarily be driven 
by the inflation-rebate provisions (sections 
129101 and 129102), which would begin to 
apply to prices within 12 months of a given 
drug’s entering the market. Under those pro-
visions, manufacturers would have an incen-
tive to launch new drugs at a higher price to 
offset slower growth in prices over time. The 
negotiation provision (section 129001) would 
have less of an impact on launch prices, CBO 
expects: Although the ceiling for a drug’s ne-
gotiated price is based on its price from a 
prior year, negotiation could not occur until 
drugs were on the market for a number of 
years—at least 7 for small-molecule drugs 
and 11 for biologics. 
Higher launch prices would primarily af-
fect spending for drugs in the Medicaid pro-
gram, CBO projects, because an increase in 
that program’s basic rebate brought about 
by the higher launch prices would only part-
ly offset those prices. Higher launch prices 
would also tend to affect spending for drugs 
covered by Part B of the Medicare program 
because that program’s payments for those 
drugs are based on the average sales prices. 
Over time, slower price growth would at-
tenuate the effect of higher launch prices. 
In the commercial and Medicare Part D 
segments of the market, spending would be 
less affected by higher launch prices, CBO es-
timates, because manufacturers would have 
more flexibility to manage rebates to maxi-
mize their revenues in those sectors. 
EFFECT OF THE NEGOTIATION PROVISION ON THE 
INTRODUCTION OF NEW GENERIC DRUGS 
CBO has not analyzed the effects of the ne-
gotiation provision on the introduction of 
new generic drugs. In projecting the effects 
of the negotiation provision, CBO estimated 
the share of spending that would be subject 
to negotiation each year and the average re-
duction in prices that would stem from the 
negotiations. But the agency did not analyze 
how the provision would affect prices or 
spending on specific drugs, nor did it quan-
tify any impact on the introduction of new 
generic drugs. 
EFFECTS OF THE PREMIUM-STABILIZATION 
PROVISION 
Under the premium-stabilization provision 
(section 129201), the federal government 
would subsidize any growth in beneficiaries’ 
base premiums for Medicare Part D exceed-
ing 6 percent from one year to the next over 
the 2024–2029 period. The provision subse-
quently would lower the base premium per-
centage (the percentage of the average cost 
of standard Part D coverage that is used to 
calculate beneficiaries’ premiums) to ensure 
that premiums did not grow by more than 6 
percent between 2029 and 2030. That subsidy 
and subsequent reduction in premiums would 
increase federal spending by roughly $40 bil-
lion over the 2024–2031 period, CBO estimates. 
Beneficiaries’ spending on premiums would 
be lower under the premium-stabilization 
provision than it would be without it. 
That estimate is an average effect among 
the possible paths of premiums that CBO 
considered when modeling the uncertainty of 
future outcomes. Under some of those paths, 
premiums would grow by less than 6 percent 
a year, and the provision would have no cost; 
under others, premiums would grow faster, 
and the provision would generate costs.

August 12, 2022 
I hope this information is useful to you 
and your colleagues. Please contact me if 
you have further questions. 
Sincerely, 
PHILLIP L. SWAGEL, 
Director. 
Mr. SMITH of Missouri. Mr. Speaker, 
I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from 
Virginia (Mr. GOOD). 
Mr. GOOD of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, 
the Democrats are determined to make 
inflation worse by continuing their dis-
astrous policies that caused it in the 
first place. Do they not understand the 
concept of pouring gas on a fire? 
Beyond the reckless spending of near-
ly another trillion dollars on top of the 
$30 trillion national debt—there is no 
climate crisis. It is a hoax. This is the 
one 
crisis 
that 
even 
Democrats 
couldn’t create. 
They have been crying about the cli-
mate sky falling for 40 years now, pre-
dicting the world would end in 12 years. 
It is a lie. 
We are the cleanest large energy pro-
ducer in the world, and fossil fuels are 
a wonderful thing. They are essential 
to our economic and national security. 
Worse yet, Democrats want to spend 
$80 billion to hire 87,000 more armed 
IRS agents to terrorize Americans with 
1.2 million more audits of hardworking 
taxpayers. No one in my district has 
ever told me that the one thing we 
need is more IRS agents. 
Mr. Speaker, the American people 
will vote against this bill on November 
8. 
Mr. YARMUTH. Mr. Speaker, we just 
heard the big lie a couple more times 
about 87,000 IRS agents that are going 
to be armed. It is total bunk. Nonsense. 
The Republicans should stop it and tell 
the truth. They are continuing to say 
it. 
I will say one thing. We were in-
formed last week by the Commissioner 
of the IRS, Mr. Rettig, an appointee of 
former President Trump, that audits 
would not increase for anybody making 
under $400,000 a year. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the 
gentlewoman from Washington (Ms. 
JAYAPAL), a distinguished member of 
the Budget Committee. 
Ms. JAYAPAL. Mr. Speaker, today, 
Democrats will take unprecedented and 
urgent action when we pass the Infla-
tion Reduction Act. 
Today, we make good on our promise 
to take on climate change and climate 
justice with historic investments in 
green technologies that will cut carbon 
emissions by 40 percent by 2030, create 
over 9 million good jobs, put $60 billion 
into environmental justice, and cut en-
ergy costs for the average American 
family by almost $1,000 a year. 
Also, for the first time, we take on 
Big Pharma’s price gouging, finally al-
lowing Medicare to negotiate lower 
prescription drug prices, capping the 
cost of insulin, and continuing to make 
healthcare more affordable. All of it is 
paid for with taxes on the largest cor-
porations and the wealthiest. 
We have more to do to complete the 
rest of the President’s agenda on 
childcare, senior care, expanding Medi-
care, and investing in housing. With a 
few more Democrats in the Senate, we 
will get that done, too. 
Today, let’s celebrate this massive 
investment for the people. People over 
politics. Let’s pass this bill. 
Mr. SMITH of Missouri. Mr. Speaker, 
I appreciate the gentlewoman from 
Washington State, and I would just 
like to point out that by doubling the 
size of the IRS and adding 87,000 new 
IRS agents, that will result in more 
than 20,000 of her families in Wash-
ington State who make less than 
$20,000 a year that will be receiving au-
dits. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 11⁄2 minutes to 
the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. 
GROTHMAN). 
Mr. GROTHMAN. Mr. Speaker, the 
87,000 figure is entirely reasonable, 
given we have an $80 billion increase. 
Now, is it exact? It might be 86,500. I 
don’t know. It is a big number. 
First of all, it is that many more peo-
ple monitoring Americans. Anybody 
that wants a free society should be 
afraid of that. 
Secondly, with 86,500 people poking 
around small business, it means that 
much more accountant time that has 
to be paid for by the small businesses. 
It means that many more lawyers 
hired by the small businesses. It is 
really an accountant and legal make- 
work program. Auditing on this scale 
will really change the amount of time 
you have to deal with this. 
Other things, you are getting rid of— 
I am very disappointed—the good pro-
vision you had with regard to carried 
interest. You are finally going after 
some of the billionaires of this coun-
try, and I wish you wouldn’t have 
caved into the Senate and removed 
that provision. That was a very good 
thing. 
Next, you have way too much cor-
porate welfare in here. $134 billion in 
tax credits for so-called favored green 
industries. What is it? It is that many 
more businesses depending upon gov-
ernment, and their way to make money 
is not by providing something the 
American citizen wants. They are mak-
ing money because of tax credits they 
have been given by Congress. 
Otherwise, the bill is full of other big 
spending, as well. There is a 22 percent 
increase in Bureau of Indian Affairs, 22 
percent at a time when we are choking 
on inflation because of excessive gov-
ernment spending. That is one more 
spending program to put in here. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Mem-
bers are reminded to direct their com-
ments to the Chair. 
b 1230 
Mr. YARMUTH. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
1 minute to the gentlewoman from 
California (Ms. LEE), who is a distin-
guished member of the Budget Com-
mittee. 
Ms. LEE of California. Mr. Speaker, I 
rise today to support the Inflation Re-
duction Act of 2022. I thank the chair-
man for yielding his time and also for 
his leadership. 
This historic bill puts people over 
politics by lowering the cost of living 
for necessities like healthcare, cre-
ating good-paying jobs, and ensuring 
that the wealthy and corporations pay 
their fair share of taxes. 
Now, we know that lower-income 
communities and communities of color 
face the brunt of pollution and climate 
change. This bill makes the single larg-
est investment in combating climate 
change and works to reduce carbon pol-
lution by 40 percent by 2030. We still 
have a lot ahead, though, and much 
more work to do, like fighting for in-
vestments that have deep impacts on 
communities of color, such as housing, 
the child tax credit, investments in our 
care economy, universal childcare, and 
insulin caps beyond Medicare which 
disproportionately impacts people of 
color. But make no mistake, this bill 
will make an impact on families and 
our planet. 
It is a shame and disgrace that Re-
publicans won’t vote for this bill. But 
this bill helps Republican constituents 
also. 
So I am so proud today to vote for 
this bill for our Republican constitu-
ents. 
Mr. SMITH of Missouri. Mr. Speaker, 
I include in the RECORD notice from 
over 230 economists that this bill be-
fore us today would only increase infla-
tion. 
[From FOX Business, Aug. 4, 2022] 
OVER 230 ECONOMISTS WARN MANCHIN’S 
SPENDING BILL WILL PERPETUATE INFLATION 
(By Kelly Laco) 
A letter sent to House and Senate leader-
ship from 230 economists argues that the In-
flation Reduction Act is expected to con-
tribute to skyrocketing inflation and will 
burden the U.S. economy, contrary to Presi-
dent Biden and Democrats’ claims. 
The economists wrote in the letter first ob-
tained by Fox News Digital that the U.S. 
economy is at a ‘‘dangerous crossroads’’ and 
the ‘‘inaptly named ‘Inflation Reduction Act 
of 2022’ would do nothing of the sort and in-
stead would perpetuate the same fiscal pol-
icy errors that have helped precipitate the 
current troubling economic climate.’’ 
Sen. Joe Manchin, D–W.Va, announced last 
week he reached an agreement with Senate 
Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D–NY, on 
the $739 billion reconciliation Package after 
more than a year of negotiations among 
Democrats. 
The economic experts point to the $433 bil-
lion in proposed government spending, which 
they argue ‘‘would create immediate infla-
tionary pressures by boosting demand, while 
the supply-side tax hikes would constrain 
supply 
by 
discouraging 
investment 
and 
draining the private sector of much-needed 
resources.’’

they say will undercut efforts to restore 
functioning supply chains.

provisions ‘‘would impose price controls that

threaten healthcare innovation, creating a 
human health toll that would add to the fi-
nancial woes that Americans are already ex-
periencing.’’ 
A few of the notable signers include Nobel 
laureate Vernon Smith, former Chair of the 
Council of Economic Advisers Kevin Hassett, 
former Director of the Office of Management 
and Budget Jim Miller and Robert Heller, 
former president of the Federal Reserve 
Board 1986–1989. 
In addition, professors from the University 
of Chicago, Princeton University, Duke Uni-
versity, the University of Virginia, Columbia 
University and the University of Notre 
Dame, among others, were listed on the let-
ter dated Aug. 3. 
The experts conclude that although they 
agree with an ‘‘urgent’’ need to address infla-
tion, Manchin’s bill is a ‘‘misleading label’’ 
applied to legislation that would achieve the 
‘‘opposite effect’’ 
President Biden urged Congress to pass the 
bill during a virtual roundtable Thursday. 
‘‘My message to Congress is this: Listen to 
the American people,’’ he said. (Jonathan 
Ernst/File Photo/ Reuters) 
The letter was sent to Schumer, Senate 
Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R–Ky., 
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D–Calif., and 
House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R– 
Calif. 
Schumer has touted the Inflation Reduc-
tion Act as an immediate solution to infla-
tion, which reached a new 40-year high last 
month. 
‘‘The Inflation Reduction Act will lower 
inflation, lower the costs of prescription 
drugs, close loopholes long exploited by big 
business who pay no or little taxes,’’ Schu-
mer said Thursday on the Senate floor. 
In addition, Biden urged Congress to pass 
the bill during a virtual roundtable Thurs-
day. ‘‘My message to Congress is this: Listen 
to the American people,’’ he said. 
‘‘This is the strongest bill you can pass to 
lower inflation, continue to cut the deficit, 
reduce health care costs, tackle a climate 
crisis and promote America’s energy secu-
rity and reduce the burdens facing working- 
class and middle-class families,’’ Biden con-
tinued. 
However, Republicans are less enthusiastic 
about the more than $700 billion spending 
and tax package. 
Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell 
told Fox News that the bill raises taxes and 
‘‘calling it an inflation reduction bill is rath-
er laughable.’’ (J. Scott Applewhite) (AP Im-
ages) 
McCarthy told Fox News on Wednesday 
that ‘‘Democrats have no plans to solve all 
the problems they created’’ and Manchin’s 
bill is not the solution. 
In the Senate, McConnell stated this week 
that most of his colleagues were ‘‘somewhat 
shocked’’ about Manchin’s reversal of pre-
vious positions He continued, telling Fox 
News that the bill raises taxes and ‘‘calling 
it an inflation reduction bill is rather laugh-
able.’’ 
‘‘Democrats are catastrophically out of 
touch with what American families actually 
care about. Their approval ratings show it. 
And their reckless taxing and spending spree 
proves it, as well,’’ said McConnell in a 
statement this week. 
The Senate is set to convene on Saturday 
to vote on a procedural motion to move the 
bill forward. It is still unclear if Sen. 
Kyrsten Sinema, D–Ariz., will support the 
legislation, and her vote is necessary for 
final passage of the bill under reconciliation 
rules that would allow a majority to pass. 
Democrats previously touted a letter from 
126 economists supporting Manchin’s bill. 
Mr. SMITH of Missouri. Mr. Speaker, 
I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from 
Florida (Mr. DONALDS). 
Mr. DONALDS. Mr. Speaker, I rise in 
opposition to this terrible bill because 
this terrible bill will increase the cost 
of energy on every hardworking Amer-
ican in the United States. 
This bill actually calls for a doubling 
of the excise tax on oil and on gas, dou-
bling of the royalties on oil and on gas. 
I was in my district yesterday with 
Americans for Prosperity at the True 
Cost of Washington event where they 
actually brought down the price of gas-
oline to $2.38, the price it was before 
Joe Biden took office. I had families in 
my district crying because they could 
finally put gas in their cars and food on 
their dinner table in that day. 
The Democrats come here today, and 
they want to lecture us about putting 
people over politics? 
That is a joke, and it is a lie. 
These tax increases on oil and gas 
will only hurt poor families all across 
America. I don’t care if you are in Se-
attle, Washington; I don’t care if you 
are in Miami, Florida; you could be in 
Chicago, Illinois; New York City; or 
San Francisco, California; those tax in-
creases hurt the very poor among us, 
and the Democrats are cool with it. 
Mr. Speaker, vote ‘‘no’’ on this bill. 
Mr. YARMUTH. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
1 minute to the gentlewoman from 
Texas (Ms. JACKSON LEE), who is a dis-
tinguished member of the Budget Com-
mittee. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I 
want to dispel the myths of the smoke 
and mirrors that are flaming up across 
the way with my friends. 
Do they not recognize the oppor-
tunity that we have for reducing the 
costs of healthcare with subsidies so 
that working families can get the Af-
fordable Care Act? Or excitingly, I am 
so delighted that there is a cap on insu-
lin. Diabetes is raging for those on 
Medicare, and we are going to get those 
on private insurance as well. 
Let’s tell the truth about taxes. No 
taxes on those making $400,000 or less 
but getting the $160 billion in the top 1 
percent that have refused to pay their 
fair share. 
What is this folder? 
These are letters from my county at-
torneys and communities about con-
crete batch facilities put in neighbor-
hoods of Hispanics and African Ameri-
cans by Trinity Gardens in the East 
End and Aldine. This legislation, $60 
billion, will help save these people who 
have been living in their homes and 
losing their homes because environ-
mental toxins like a concrete batch fa-
cility gets put in their neighborhood 
and creates respiratory diseases: asth-
ma, bad grass, and parks that you can’t 
play in. 
Mr. Speaker, I support this legisla-
tion. Why? 
Because it is for the working people 
in America. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise to 
wholeheartedly and enthusiastically support 
the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, H.R. 5376. 
I commend our Democratic colleagues in 
the Senate—whose tireless efforts culminated 
in this landmark legislation—and our Demo-
cratic Caucus in the House, whose commit-
ment to the policies embodied in this legisla-
tion kept the prospect for progress alive and 
ready for action over the past year. 
We persevered to extend health care bene-
fits, limit the cost of medication, combat the 
climate crisis, help impoverished Americans, 
and reduce inflation for all Americans. We 
never relinquished our focus and determina-
tion to help those who are suffering from the 
economic aftershocks of COVID–19. 
Enactment of the Inflation Reduction Act is 
crucial at this vital moment, as Americans 
need the economic relief that this bill will pro-
vide. It will boost quality-of-life for American 
families by reducing costs and inflation, and 
bolstering our national economy and competi-
tiveness for years to come. 
This legislation is truly historic because it 
will dramatically advance major policies and 
programs supported by the vast majority of 
Americans, and it will do so in a fiscally re-
sponsible way, applying much of the revenue 
raised to deficit reduction. 
A key message that this legislation sends is 
that Congress, with Democrats at the helm, is 
focused on providing aid to working Ameri-
cans, middle-income families, impoverished 
Americans, and those who most need a little 
help during challenging times. 
This is a stark contrast from a few years 
ago, when Republicans in control of Congress 
passed bills that gave massive tax breaks to 
the wealthiest people and corporations, and 
helped the rich get richer, while tossing mere 
table scraps to the middle class, and barely a 
few crumbs to Americans suffering in poverty. 
So, I’m delighted that the Inflation Reduction 
Act will provide urgently needed financial relief 
to Americans in need, reforms to address the 
climate crisis, and initiatives that will help our 
nation transition to its next era of success for 
all Americans. 
Among the provisions that will directly ben-
efit family finances across the country are the 
Inflation Reduction Act’s health care reforms, 
initiatives, assistance, and restraints on cost 
increases. 
For the first time after years of efforts by 
Democrats, Medicare will be able to negotiate 
with drug companies to lower the price of 
medications for Americans receiving Medicare. 
Maximum prices for 10 drugs will take effect in 
2026, 15 more drugs in 2027, another 15 in 
2028, and 20 more in 2029 and beyond. 
Manufacturers that do not offer a price 
equal to or less than the maximum fair price 
will be subject to a civil monetary penalty of 
10 times the difference between the offered 
price and the maximum fair price for all of its 
drugs sold in violation of that. 
The IRA will impose rebates on drug com-
panies that increase prices faster than inflation 
to limit annual increases in drug prices for 
people with Medicare. The inflation rebate pro-
vision will be implemented beginning in 2023, 
using 2021 as the base year for determining 
price changes relative to inflation. 
Another major reform is a new $2,000 an-
nual cap on Medicare Part D out-of-pocket 
spending starting in 2025. Currently, there is 
no limit on out-of-pocket spending for prescrip-
tion drugs that seniors need. 
This bill ensures that devastating diagnoses, 
like cancer, will never again mean paying tens 
of thousands out-of-pocket for just one drug, 
which forces Medicare recipients into severe 
financial hardship.

The bill expands the low-income subsidy 
program in Medicare Part D. Currently, it is 
fully available to those earning less than 135 
percent of the federal poverty level, and par-
tially available to those earning less than 150 
percent of that level. The bill eliminates the 
partial subsidy, giving those earning up to 
150% of the poverty level the full low-income 
subsidy in Medicare Part D. 
The bill initiates a major reform to help 
Medicare patients who need insulin and have 
been forced to pay exorbitant costs for their 
life-sustaining supply. 
The Inflation Reduction Act caps out-of- 
pocket costs at $35 per month for insulin co- 
pays under Medicare programs. Cost-sharing 
for Part D plans will be capped at $35 for ap-
proved insulin products starting in 2023. After 
2025, the price will be the lesser of $35, 25 
percent of the maximum fair price, or 25 per-
cent of the negotiated price. From January to 
March 2023, there will be temporary subsidies 
for any cost sharing over $35 per month. 
While I am delighted that H.R. 5376 im-
poses a $35 per month cap on the price of in-
sulin for people covered by Medicare, this cap 
should have extended to Americans with pri-
vate insurance. 
I was very upset that Senate Republicans 
rejected that policy, as it is immoral to side 
with drug companies that force people to 
choose between life-sustaining insulin and 
other daily needs. Some Americans have died 
because they couldn’t afford their insulin, 
which is subject to unjustifiable pricing prac-
tices. 
This bill should have ensured that Ameri-
cans with private health insurance would ben-
efit from a $35 per month cap on their insulin 
costs, and I will continue the fight for this re-
form. 
The Inflation Reduction Act lowers health in-
surance premiums for nearly 13 million low- 
and middle-income Americans whose cov-
erage is from the Affordable Care Act. The bill 
allocates $64 billion to extend tax credits for 
three years, through 2025. 
Recipients saved on average $800 in 2021. 
Monthly premiums were estimated to decrease 
by $50 per person on average in 2022, and 80 
percent of ACA enrollees with the tax credits 
were able to find a plan that amounted to $10 
or less per month. 
This is extremely important because exten-
sion of these credits subsidizing the cost of 
health insurance will prevent 3 million people 
from becoming uninsured due to steep pre-
mium hikes, protecting them from financial 
hardship, and saving the health care system 
from the perilous costs of uncompensated 
care. 
I was dismayed that Senator Warnock’s 
amendment extending Medicaid expansion to 
2.2 million people living in poverty in 12 states 
was not adopted by the Senate. Impoverished 
Americans with no access to affordable health 
care would have been able to see a doctor 
when they are sick, pregnant, or have other 
health needs. We must still close the Medicaid 
coverage gap for Americans who have a need 
for, and the right to, health care. Although it is 
not in this bill, I will continue to fight for this. 
The bill makes historic investments to com-
bat climate change by putting the United 
States on a path to reduce emissions by 40% 
by 2030, investing $369 billion in clean energy 
and energy efficiency to lower household en-
ergy costs, and ensuring that lower-income 
households can benefit from these programs. 
The bill’s clean energy and emission reduc-
tion programs attack the climate crisis at its 
source—electric utilities, cars, trucks, and 
methane emission producers—while ensuring 
that rural and disadvantaged communities 
share the benefits. 
The IRA provides direct consumer incen-
tives to relieve the high costs of energy and 
decrease utility bills by encouraging purchases 
of energy efficient and clean-energy goods, 
with a significant portion of the funding going 
to lower-income households and disadvan-
taged communities. 
The bill includes $9 billion in consumer 
home energy rebate programs, focused on 
low-income consumers, to electrify home ap-
pliances and for energy efficient retrofits. 
The IRA provides 10 years of consumer tax 
credits to make homes energy efficient, using 
clean energy and making heat pumps, rooftop 
solar, 
community 
solar 
projects, 
electric 
HVAC, and efficient water heaters more af-
fordable. 
The bill includes a $4,000 consumer tax 
credit for lower- and middle-income individuals 
to buy used clean-energy vehicles, and up to 
a $7,500 tax credit to buy new clean-energy 
vehicles. This will bring electric cars—and the 
fuel costs they save—within the reach of work-
ing families. 
Additionally, the bill establishes a $1 billion 
grant program to make affordable housing 
more energy efficient. 
The investments in this bill will reduce emis-
sions in every sector of the economy, substan-
tially reducing emissions from electricity gen-
eration, transportation, industrial manufac-
turing, buildings, and agriculture. 
Tax credits are provided for clean sources 
of electricity and energy storage, and roughly 
$30 billion in targeted grant and loan pro-
grams for states and electric utilities to accel-
erate the transition to clean electricity. 
The legislation includes tax credits and 
grants for clean fuels and clean commercial 
vehicles to reduce emissions from all parts of 
the transportation sector. 
The bill provides grants and tax cred-
its to reduce emissions from industrial 
manufacturing processes, including al-
most $6 billion for a new Advanced In-
dustrial Facilities Deployment Pro-
gram to reduce emissions from the 
largest industrial emitters like chem-
ical, steel and cement plants. 
To spur innovation, $27 billion is pro-
vided for a clean energy technology ac-
celerator to aid deployment of tech-
nologies that reduce emissions, espe-
cially in disadvantaged communities. 
The IRA has $9 billion for Federal 
procurement of American-made clean 
products, including $3 billion for zero- 
emission Postal Service vehicles, to 
create a stable market for them. 
The Inflation Reduction Act includes 
over $60 billion for environmental jus-
tice priorities to drive investments 
into disadvantaged communities. 
The bill has $3 billion for Environ-
mental and Climate Justice Block 
Grants that will invest in community- 
led projects in disadvantaged commu-
nities and community capacity build-
ing centers to address disproportionate 
environmental and public health harms 
related 
to 
pollution 
and 
climate 
change. 
The IRA creates Neighborhood Ac-
cess and Equity Grants with $3 billion 
to aid neighborhood equity, safety, and 
affordable transportation access. This 
landmark program addresses a long 
legacy of ignoring environmental jus-
tice concerns in project decision-mak-
ing. The grants aim to reconnect com-
munities divided by infrastructure bar-
riers, mitigate negative impacts of 
transit 
facilities 
or 
construction 
projects on disadvantaged or under-
served communities, and support equi-
table transportation planning and com-
munity engagement activities. 
The bill provides another $3 billion 
for Grants to Reduce Air Pollution at 
Ports to support the purchase and in-
stallation of zero-emission equipment 
and technology at ports. 
The IRA also provides $1 billion for 
clean heavy-duty vehicles, such as 
school and transit buses and garbage 
trucks. 
There is $60 million for Diesel Emis-
sions Reduction Act grants to address 
diesel emissions from goods movement 
facilities like airports and railyards, 
and from vehicles using those facili-
ties. 
The IRA has $236 million for Air Pol-
lution Monitoring that will particu-
larly benefit disadvantaged commu-
nities exposed to areas with persistent 
air pollution. 
The bill includes $50 million to ad-
dress Air Pollution at Schools by moni-
toring and reducing air pollution at 
public schools in low-income and dis-
advantaged communities. 
The bill provides $87 million for the 
Low Emissions Electricity Program to 
support low-income and disadvantaged 
communities, and offer technical as-
sistance to industry, as well as state 
and local governments, as they work to 
reduce greenhouse gas emissions. 
Environmental justice is also central 
to initiatives that aim to decarbonize 
the economy, such as the technology 
accelerator and consumer home energy 
rebate programs, that focus on dis-
advantaged and low-income commu-
nities. Additionally, many of the clean 
energy tax credits include either a 
bonus or set-aside structure to drive 
investments and economic develop-
ment in disadvantaged communities. 
This bill funds energy reliability, 
cleaner energy, and historic invest-
ments in American clean energy manu-
facturing. 
It includes over $60 billion for clean 
energy manufacturing in the U.S. 
across the full supply chain of clean en-
ergy and transportation technologies. 
These manufacturing incentives will 
help alleviate inflation and reduce the 
risk of future price shocks by bringing 
down the cost of clean energy and 
clean vehicles and relieving supply 
chain bottlenecks. 
The IRA invests roughly $30 billion 
for production tax credits to accelerate 
U.S. manufacturing of solar panels, 
wind turbines, batteries, and critical 
minerals processing. 
The bill has a $10 billion investment 
tax credit to build clean technology

The bill also funds $500 million in the 
Defense Production Act for heat pumps 
and critical minerals processing. 
The bill has $2 billion in grants to re-
tool auto manufacturing facilities to 
manufacture clean vehicles, ensuring 
that auto manufacturing jobs stay in 
the communities that rely on them. 
The IRA provides up to $20 billion in 
loans to build new clean vehicle manu-
facturing facilities across the country. 
To spur the next generation of en-
ergy technologies, the bill provides $2 
billion for National Labs to accelerate 
breakthrough energy research. 
To afford these investments and re-
duce the deficit, the Inflation Reduc-
tion Act requires the wealthiest people 
and corporations to pay their fair share 
of taxes, without raising taxes on any-
one making less than $400,000 each 
year. In fact, the non-partisan Joint 
Committee on Taxation reported that, 
in addition to not increasing taxes on 
any family making $400,000 or less, 
taxes on those families would actually 
be reduced by the IRA. 
This would correct the longstanding 
injustice 
of 
hardworking 
American 
families paying their taxes on time 
while wealthy millionaires and billion-
aires avoid paying the taxes they owe 
to the federal government. 
By creating a more equitable tax sys-
tem, this bill will ease the pressure of 
inflation and allow more Americans to 
participate productively in the econ-
omy. Americans overwhelmingly agree 
that corporations have paid too little 
for too long. Only in Washington would 
Republicans fight against cutting costs 
for low- and middle-income workers 
and their families in defense of wealthy 
corporations. 
To fairly and appropriately raise rev-
enues, the bill includes major reforms, 
each of which are sound tax policies. 
The Inflation Reduction Act imposes 
a corporate alternative minimum tax 
on corporations that earn more than $1 
billion in annual profit, but do not pay 
at least a 15 percent tax rate. This 
would apply to about 150 corporations 
that average nearly $9 billion in profit, 
but which paid effective tax rates of 
just 1.1 percent. The minimum tax will 
make sure they pay their fair share, 
and will raise approximately $222 bil-
lion. 
The bill will levy a 1 percent fee on 
stock buybacks by publicly-traded cor-
porations to level the playing field. 
This reform to the tax code, which 
raises $74 billion, would put an end to 
favoring 
buybacks 
for 
rich 
share-
holders and executives over invest-
ments in workers and innovation. 
The legislation will help prevent the 
wealthiest Americans from sheltering 
their nonbusiness income and avoiding 
taxes. By extending the limitation on 
excess business losses for two years, 
the bill would raise an additional $52 
billion. 
This bill also gives the IRS resources 
to rebuild its antiquated systems to 
make the wealthy pay their taxes. By 
investing $80 billion over ten years for 
tax enforcement and compliance, the 
Congressional Budget Office estimates 
the IRS will collect $203 billion. Nearly 
75 percent of Americans believe the 
IRS should conduct more tax audits of 
large corporations and millionaires. 
Recently, the IRS Commissioner em-
phasized that families making under 
$400,000 per year will not see increased 
audits. 
I was upset that the Senate did not 
close the carried interest loophole, 
which lets investment fund managers 
pay lower taxes on their earnings than 
wage earners pay. Billionaires scored a 
win worth billions as others struggle to 
make ends meet. Yet, I am pleased that 
the bill levels the playing field with 
other taxes. 
The Inflation Reduction Act is excel-
lent legislation that will be a great 
leap forward for the American people, 
including for my constituents in the 
18th Congressional District of Texas. 
Mr. SMITH of Missouri. Mr. Speaker, 
I want to point out that by doubling 
the size of the IRS, working people in 
America, 85,000 more families in the 
State of Texas, will face additional au-
dits—these are families who make less 
than $200,000—because of doubling of 
the IRS. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the 
gentleman from Texas (Mr. BURGESS). 
Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman from Missouri for yield-
ing. 
Mr. Speaker, we are hearing that this 
bill is a tax cut. But that only applies 
if you sign up for ObamaCare and par-
ticipate in all the green tax credits. 
But if you don’t, then this bill is a tax 
increase of over $10.5 billion for those 
making under $200,000 a year. 
Despite what you say, there is $80 bil-
lion in this bill for 87,000 new IRS 
agents, and this will disproportionately 
increase audits on low- and middle-in-
come earners at a time when even the 
best CPA firms cannot find qualified 
employees. 
Now, Wednesday in the Rules Com-
mittee, I tried to get an amendment by 
Mr. DAVIDSON of Ohio made in order 
that would require that all of these 
new hires at least be CPAs. This was 
rejected by every Democrat in the 
Rules Committee. 
Mr. Speaker, they are coming after 
you. They are coming after you with 
poorly trained technicians, and it is 
just not right. 
Mr. YARMUTH. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
1 minute to the gentlewoman from 
Florida (Ms. WASSERMAN
SCHULTZ), 
who is a distinguished member of the 
Appropriations Committee. 
Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Mr. 
Speaker, I thank the gentleman for 
yielding. 
Mr. Speaker, I proudly rise to sup-
port legislation that delivers relief to 
every kitchen table across the country, 
cuts healthcare and drug costs, and 
creates millions of good-paying jobs to 
save our planet for future generations. 
In my home State of Florida, the In-
flation Reduction Act hands security 
and peace of mind to millions of sen-
iors in my State. It caps out-of-pocket 
prescription costs and monthly insulin 
costs for Medicare recipients, and fi-
nally allows Medicare to negotiate pre-
scription drug prices. 
Millions 
of 
Floridians 
will 
be 
healthier and more financially secure 
by lowering premiums for 13 million 
Americans with expanded financial 
help 
for 
the 
Affordable 
Care 
Act 
healthcare policies. It will slash energy 
costs and work to stop our warming 
planet 
from 
stealing 
their 
grand-
children’s future. 
This is our biggest shot ever to tack-
le climate change by speeding up clean 
energy transitions and cutting climate 
pollution 40 percent by 2030. 
The Inflation Reduction Act does all 
this by making corporations pay their 
fair share, reducing the deficit, and en-
suring no one who makes less than 
$400,000 will pay one penny more. 
This is game-changing relief for our 
seniors, our climate, and anyone de-
manding tax fairness. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my col-
leagues to pass this lifesaving legisla-
tion. 
Mr. SMITH of Missouri. Mr. Speaker, 
I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from 
Pennsylvania (Mr. SMUCKER), who is a 
great leader on the Budget Committee. 
Mr. SMUCKER. Mr. Speaker, what a 
time to raise taxes and to spend nearly 
$1 trillion more. The economy is in a 
recession, food inflation is up 12.9 per-
cent over the past year, gas is up 49 
percent, and shelter costs rose by 5.7 
percent. 
What will families get instead of re-
lief? 
They will get $10.6 billion in tax in-
creases, and 50 percent more may get 
audited by the IRS. 
Now, the chairman on the other side 
has disputed these 87,000 new agents. I 
would ask him to read page 37 of the 
bill which provides for $45 billion in 
new funding to the IRS, specifically for 
enforcement activities, and ask if he 
will dispute that as well. 
Where does he think $45 billion is 
going to go? 
In fact, we all know the IRS needs a 
lot of help to provide constituent serv-
ices. Fourteen times more dollars are 
going for enforcement than to helping 
them do their job. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentleman has expired. 
Mr. SMITH of Missouri. Mr. Speaker, 
I yield the gentleman from Pennsyl-
vania an additional 15 seconds. 
Mr. SMUCKER. Our Democrat col-
leagues are also falsely insisting this 
bill will not raise taxes on small busi-
nesses or households with incomes 
below $400,000. Yet, during Rules Com-
mittee debate on the bill, a Ways and 
Means Democrat admitted that house-
holds making less than $400,000 per 
year will see a tax increase in this bill. 
He was citing the nonpartisan analysis 
from JCT.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H7654 
August 12, 2022 
Don’t be fooled. This bill is not a 
plan to address inflation. 
Mr. YARMUTH. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
I just want to clarify one thing. It 
seems to me that Republicans just 
don’t want people to pay taxes even if 
they are owed. We know there are hun-
dreds of billions of dollars of owed-but- 
not-paid taxes in this country every 
year. This is an attempt to try and re-
cover some of that money that is owed 
and is not being paid by taxpayers who 
are, in many cases, cheating. 
To be clear, IRS has made no deci-
sions or no announcements regarding 
the potential hiring plans under this 
bill. As I said before, the commissioner 
of the IRS has said that they are not 
going to increase audits of people mak-
ing under $400,000. A lot of this money 
is designed to go to help service the le-
gitimate and lawful taxpayers of this 
country by giving them better service, 
making the IRS more responsive, and 
to upgrading equipment which is now 
50 or 60 years old in many cases. 
So they can continue with this claim 
that we are going to go after taxpayers 
with armed IRS agents, and I know 
that Republicans would like to arm 
every tax agent as they want to arm 
everybody else in this country, but 
that is nonsense. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the 
gentleman 
from 
California 
(Mr. 
KHANNA), who is a distinguished mem-
ber of the Armed Services Committee. 
Mr. KHANNA. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the chairman for his leadership in pass-
ing the most historic climate legisla-
tion in the history of this Nation and 
in the history of the world. 
It is appropriate that it would be 
named after Chairman YARMUTH after 
his distinguished service in this Con-
gress. 
But I also thank all the young people 
out there and the environmental activ-
ists who for so long had no hope that 
this body would do anything. They 
marched, they protested, and they or-
ganized. They deserve credit for the 
$369 billion that will build solar, wind, 
and that will build electric vehicles. 
I understand it is only a down pay-
ment on what we need for climate. I 
understand there is more work to be 
done, so we eliminate fossil fuel sub-
sidies, so we have more of a commit-
ment to environmental justice, and so 
that we don’t have mandates on oil 
leasing. But I am so proud of the young 
folks 
for 
recognizing 
that 
getting 
something done is better than getting 
nothing done. This is the first victory 
in many victories to come, and they 
deserve credit for our passing this bill 
today. 
Mr. SMITH of Missouri. Mr. Speaker, 
I want to point out to the chairman of 
the Budget Committee that—maybe his 
staff has not presented it to him—the 
Congressional Budget Office this morn-
ing—this morning—confirmed that peo-
ple making less than $400,000 a year 
will face more audits. 
You keep saying: Let the facts be 
real, no scare tactics. 
The facts from the Congressional 
Budget Office are that, in fact, your 
legislation is increasing more audits on 
people who make less than $400,000 a 
year. I put it in the RECORD. You can 
read it there. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the 
great gentleman from Georgia (Mr. 
CARTER). 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, I rise today in opposition to the in-
flation expansion act which is threat-
ening the same industries that it pur-
ports to help. 
Washington Democrats who claim to 
champion electric vehicles are pushing 
a bill—you are pushing this bill that 
will threaten an over $5 billion invest-
ment Hyundai is making in the First 
Congressional District of Georgia. 
Now, Mr. Speaker, this is serious. 
This is a $5 billion investment that 
they are threatening. This will be the 
automaker’s first dedicated electric ve-
hicle 
manufacturing 
plant 
in 
the 
United States and will create over 8,000 
jobs upon completion. 
This bill’s new EV tax credit dis-
criminates against and excludes South 
Korea, a key strategic trading partner 
and longtime ally of the United States 
and may actually violate the KORUS 
Free Trade Agreement. 
This burdensome regulation could 
prevent billions of dollars in invest-
ment, thousands of jobs, and affordable 
electric vehicles from coming to mar-
ket in the United States. 
The answer is clear: We need innova-
tion not regulation. The private sector 
is leading the charge. You are messing 
around with a $5 billion investment 
and 8,000 jobs, Mr. Speaker. I hope that 
you will let my colleagues know, Mr. 
Speaker. 
Mr. YARMUTH. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
1 minute to the gentleman from Texas 
(Mr. GREEN), who is the distinguished 
member of the Financial Services Com-
mittee. 
Mr. GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, to 
my friends across the aisle: Where were 
you when your twice impeached Presi-
dent was putting billions of dollars in 
the pockets of the wealthy? 
You complain about drug prices 
being reduced for seniors, complain 
about them having out-of-pocket costs 
capped at $2,000? 
I refuse to allow a bill that is good to 
be defeated by a perfect bill that we 
won’t get. I will support this bill, and I 
ask my colleagues to do so as well. It 
is time to take care of our seniors. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Mem-
bers are again reminded to direct their 
remarks to the Chair. 
Mr. SMITH of Missouri. Mr. Speaker, 
I yield 1 minute to the great gentleman 
from Mississippi (Mr. GUEST). 
Mr. GUEST. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today in strong opposition to this de-
structive piece of legislation. 
Every day I hear from fellow Mis-
sissippians who struggle to buy gas and 
groceries because of inflation fueled by 
the left’s reckless spending. 
Now, instead of acknowledging the 
impact their out-of-control spending 
has had on Americans, my colleagues 
across the aisle are trying to pass leg-
islation that will increase taxes on 
Americans, spend hundreds of billions 
of taxpayer dollars on far-left prior-
ities, and pass legislation that will add 
an army of IRS agents. 
It is time to acknowledge that the 
American people are suffering because 
of legislation exactly like this. 
The American people are tired of this 
economic crisis, and they have been 
clear: Do not raise taxes, do not add to 
this recession with more wasteful 
spending, do not weaponize the IRS, 
and do not vote for this legislation. 
This Congress must listen to the 
American people and vote against this 
bill. 
b 1245 
Mr. YARMUTH. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
1 minute to the gentleman from Wis-
consin (Mr. POCAN), a distinguished 
member of the Appropriations Com-
mittee. 
Mr. POCAN. Mr. Speaker, global in-
flation caused by our reopening due to 
COVID–19 has caused increased prices 
in everything from gasoline to gro-
ceries to healthcare. 
Today, we put people over politics as 
we lessen the impact of global inflation 
on the American people via the Infla-
tion Reduction Act. 
Among the many things it does, it 
addresses some of the drivers of higher 
energy costs while also investing in 
U.S.-based renewable energy that will 
make us more energy independent and 
less dirty. 
It finally allows us to negotiate 
lower prescription drug prices through 
volume purchasing via Medicare while 
capping out-of-pocket drug expenses 
for seniors to no more than $2,000 per 
year. 
We make these big investments by 
ensuring that corporations that have 
often gamed the system pay a minimal 
share of taxes and go after wealthy tax 
cheats who, all too often, have evaded 
their responsibilities. 
I will gladly vote for this bill today. 
It is time to stand up to Big Pharma 
and those energy companies making 
record profits while making our planet 
less safe, and it is important we make 
sure that corporations pay their fair 
share of taxes to reduce the burden on 
working families. 
Mr. SMITH of Missouri. Mr. Speaker, 
I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman 
from Florida (Mrs. CAMMACK), my good 
friend. 
Mrs. CAMMACK. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today in strong opposition to the infla-
tion expansion act. 
It feels a little bit like Groundhog 
Day here on Capitol Hill because it 
wasn’t but about a year ago that we 
found ourselves debating almost this 
very same legislation. It was a bad idea 
then; it is a bad idea now. Even BERNIE 
SANDERS isn’t buying this bill and has 
said that it won’t do much to reduce 
inflation. 
The only difference here really is the 
price tag from a year ago—$745 billion 
in new spending. That is not cheap. Do 
you know what we could do with that? 
You could give every single working 
mom in America a check for $96,000. 
You could give hardworking Amer-
ican seniors, who are, many of them,

now retired and having to go back to 
work, and they are on fixed incomes, 
you could give them $14,000. 
You could give every homeless vet-
eran in America a check for $5.6 mil-
lion with this bill. 
Instead, we are going to double the 
size of the IRS and target hardworking 
families who make $400,000 or less. We 
know it to be a fact. Stop denying it. 
The Senate Democrats refused and re-
jected the amendment that would have 
protected families making $400,000 or 
less. 
Reject this bill. Put Americans first. 
It is time to vote hell no. 
Mr. YARMUTH. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
1 minute to the gentleman from Texas 
(Mr. ALLRED), a distinguished member 
of the Transportation and Infrastruc-
ture Committee. 
Mr. ALLRED. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today in support of the Inflation Re-
duction Act. 
For too long, Congress has refused to 
act while seniors like my mom, who is 
a breast cancer survivor, endured price 
gouging on their medicines while on 
Medicare. 
Today, Democrats in Congress are 
changing that. We are going to stand 
up to Big Pharma and let Medicare ne-
gotiate lower prices and cap out-of- 
pocket costs at $2,000, as well as cap-
ping the cost of insulin. 
For too long, Congress has refused to 
address the climate crisis and invest in 
clean energy. Today, Democrats in 
Congress are changing that. Through 
the largest-ever investment to fight 
climate change, this bill will cut emis-
sions by 40 percent by 2030. It unleashes 
American and, yes, Texas-made clean 
energy while creating 9 million jobs. 
Thanks 
to 
President 
Biden, 
and 
Democrats in Congress, this historic 
legislation will impact our Nation for 
generations to come, all while reducing 
the deficit without raising taxes on 
folks making less than $400,000 a year. 
It is a big deal, and I cannot wait to 
vote ‘‘yes’’ for it. I encourage my col-
leagues to do the same. 
Mr. SMITH of Missouri. Mr. Speaker, 
I yield 11⁄2 minutes to the gentleman 
from Louisiana (Mr. GRAVES), my good 
friend. 
Mr. 
GRAVES 
of 
Louisiana. 
Mr. 
Speaker, I thank the gentleman for 
yielding. 
Mr. Speaker, let’s be clear. Every-
body in this Chamber supports low-
ering prescription drug costs, lowering 
these outrageous costs that all of our 
constituents are paying across the 
country. We all support clean, afford-
able energy and access to those re-
sources. We all support lowering infla-
tion. 
The difference is, where the credi-
bility gap exists, is that the very prob-
lems, the very crisis that our country 
is experiencing today, were actually 
caused by the Biden administration’s 
policies. 
We went from, in my hometown, $1.80 
a gallon for gasoline to, recently, I paid 
$4.20. We have seen a tripling of natural 
gas costs. Their own policies have 
caused this. 
Nearly a quarter of all Americans 
today can’t even afford to pay their 
electricity bills. The Biden administra-
tion policies have caused record infla-
tion, making Americans unable to even 
afford grocery costs. 
The Biden administration policies 
have resulted in higher emissions, not 
lower emissions, as compared to the 
previous administration. Biden admin-
istration policies resulted in this Presi-
dent going to countries like Saudi Ara-
bia and asking them for energy while 
telling 
Americans 
that 
we 
can’t 
produce. 
Mr. Speaker, I can’t help but remi-
nisce over Jack Abramoff, a disgraced 
lobbyist, convicted, who created prob-
lems and then charged clients to fix 
them. The difference between this bill 
and 
Jack 
Abramoff 
is 
that 
Jack 
Abramoff actually fixed problems for 
his clients. 
This bill is a disaster. There is a 
credibility gap. They have caused prob-
lems, and now we are being asked to 
trust them to fix them, and we simply 
can’t. Oppose this legislation. 
Mr. YARMUTH. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
1 minute to the gentleman from Lou-
isiana (Mr. CARTER), a distinguished 
member of the Transportation and In-
frastructure Committee. 
Mr. 
CARTER 
of 
Louisiana. 
Mr. 
Speaker, far too many things in life 
just aren’t fair. However, one thing 
should, frankly, always be fair, and 
that is taxes. 
What should always be fair is access 
to insulin, access to clean energy, and 
relief from the raging energy costs that 
we see across our country. 
This historic Inflation Reduction Act 
is fully paid for by requiring the big-
gest corporations and the ultrawealthy 
to pay their fair share. It does so with-
out any new taxes on small businesses 
or those making under $400,000. I said 
‘‘$400,000.’’ 
We can achieve this goal by strength-
ening IRS enforcement against wealthy 
tax cheats and closing tax loopholes 
exploited by the wealthiest few, 150 
massive corporations. 
In opposing these provisions, my Re-
publican colleagues are, sadly, aligning 
themselves with megacorporations and 
the ultrawealthy and turning their 
backs on the American people. 
I am proud that, with this bill, 
Democrats are once again putting peo-
ple over politics, fighting for the Amer-
ican people. I urge full support for this 
measure. 
Mr. SMITH of Missouri. Mr. Speaker, 
I include in the RECORD analysis from 
the nonpartisan Joint Committee on 
Taxation, which confirms that the bill 
increases taxes by $10.6 billion on indi-
viduals making under $200,000 in 2023 
and increases taxes by $32.6 billion 
across all incomes.

distribution methodology used in this table, see JCX–15–12 and JCX–14–13. 
2 The income concept used to place tax returns into income categories is adjusted gross income (AGI) plus: [1] tax-exempt interest, [2] employer contributions for health plans and life insurance, [3] employer share of FICA tax, [4] work-
ers’ compensation, [5] nontaxable Social Security benefits, [6] insurance value of Medicare benefits, [7] alternative minimum tax preference items, [8] individual share of business taxes, and [9] excluded income of U.S. citizens living 
abroad. Categories are measured at 2021 levels. 
3 Federal taxes are equal to individual income tax (including the outlay portion of refundable credits), employment tax (attributed to employees), excise taxes (attributed to consumers), and corporate income taxes. The estimates of Fed-
eral taxes are preliminary and subject to change. Individuals who are dependents of other taxpayers and taxpayers with negative income are excluded from the analysis. Does not include indirect effects. 
4 The average tax rate is equal to Federal taxes described in footnote (3) divided by income described in footnote (2). 
5 For returns in the $10,000 to $20,000 income category, Federal taxes would increase from ¥$1.336 billion to ¥$1.253 billion.

Mr. SMITH of Missouri. Mr. Speaker, 
I yield 1 minute to the good gentleman 
from Pennsylvania (Mr. MEUSER). 
Mr. 
MEUSER. 
Mr. 
Speaker, 
the 
American people are sick and tired of 
runaway government promises of how 
excessive spending, tax increases, and 
Green New Deal special interest invest-
ments are somehow going to make 
their lives better and reduce inflation. 
Yet, we are here today in this Cham-
ber to raise taxes on the American peo-
ple, hire 87,000 new IRS auditors for-
ever more, Mr. Speaker, and pass over 
a half trillion dollars in new govern-
ment spending, all in the name of the 
Inflation Reduction Act. 
Mr. Speaker, is this some sort of 
joke? Do we actually think that the 
American people believe that? Well, 
they don’t. 
By the way, regarding the $400,000 
less won’t get taxed, if a pass-through 
business makes $400K and the partners 
pay themselves $100,000 each, they will 
fall under the audit initiative by the 
IRS. 
As well, the projections for IRS hir-
ing do not count only taxing those over 
$400K, so the whole thing was made up 
to make it sound better than it is. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge a ‘‘no’’ vote. 
Mr. YARMUTH. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
11⁄2 minutes to the gentleman from Ne-
vada (Mr. HORSFORD), a distinguished 
member of the Budget Committee. 
Mr. HORSFORD. Mr. Speaker, I will 
cast my vote today to lower the cost of 
prescription drugs, tackle the climate 
crisis, and make big corporations pay 
their fair share in taxes while putting 
people over politics. 
Mr. Speaker, my colleagues on the 
other side of the aisle love to rant 
about fiscal responsibility, but the 
facts are clear: Every time a Repub-
lican President and congressional ma-
jority 
collude 
for 
their 
corporate 
friends and the rich elite, our deficits 
soar. So, it is up to Democrats to clean 
up that mess. 
This Inflation Reduction Act is a his-
toric downpayment on deficit reduc-
tion of approximately $300 billion to 
fight inflation. 
For years, Nevadans have seen their 
cost of living rise, while my Republican 
colleagues across the aisle have fo-
cused on giving away tax cuts for the 
wealthy. Well, today, we vote for sen-
iors, in my district and across Amer-
ica, who want one thing from Congress 
right now, and that is to lower pre-
scription drug prices. 
Today, we will cast our votes to pass 
the Inflation Reduction Act because it 
includes an important provision to cap 
out-of-pocket drug costs at $2,000 per 
senior and to cap insulin costs at $35 a 
month for seniors and individuals with 
disabilities. 
Finally, the Inflation Reduction Act 
includes a historic step to combat the 
climate crisis, including $4 billion to 
States like Nevada to combat the ef-
fects of the two-decades-long Western 
drought. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge this body to pass 
this legislation for the people, putting 
people over politics.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H7658 
August 12, 2022 
Mr. SMITH of Missouri. Mr. Speaker, 
I would like to point out to the gen-
tleman from Nevada that since Joe 
Biden has taken the oath of office, his 
reckless spending has led to an infla-
tion crisis that has cost his families in 
Nevada $9,700 per family. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the 
great 
gentleman 
from 
Ohio 
(Mr. 
CAREY). 
Mr. CAREY. Mr. Speaker, Americans 
are in the midst of a recession and the 
worst inflation in over 40 years, yet my 
friends across the aisle are set to pass 
a $745 billion spending bill that will 
raise taxes, fund the Green New Deal 
initiatives, and hire 87,000 IRS agents 
to target Americans—all this while 
doing nothing to reduce inflation and 
adding over $146 billion in debt. 
Now, they say it won’t raise taxes on 
people making less than $400,000, but 
the Joint Committee on Taxation has 
said at least half of all new tax revenue 
raised will come from those earning 
under $400,000. 
Probably the biggest thing for me is 
the 87,000 new IRS agents. To folks 
back in Ohio, I just want to put this in 
a way that you can understand. That is 
10,000 more people than live in the city 
of Parma. That is 17,000 more people 
that live in the city of Canton, 23,000 
more than in Youngstown. 
This is not the Inflation Reduction 
Act. This is the audit America act. 
b 1300 
Mr. YARMUTH. Mr. Speaker, I want 
to respond one more time to these 
claims about 87,000 new IRS agents. 
The IRS has never made any announce-
ment about plans to hire any number 
of agents. The Washington Post fact- 
checker has actually given that claim 
three Pinocchios. Again, these are Re-
publicans making it up to scare the 
American people. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the 
gentlewoman 
from 
Virginia 
(Ms. 
SPANBERGER), a distinguished member 
of the Committee on Agriculture. 
Ms. SPANBERGER. Mr. Speaker, 
today, I am so proud to rise in support 
of the Inflation Reduction Act. 
As chair of the Subcommittee on 
Conservation and Forestry, I am ex-
cited that this bill includes dedicated 
funding to further the role of Virginia’s 
crop and livestock producers in our 
work to protect our planet. 
Farmers are the original conserva-
tionists, and their expertise cannot be 
ignored if we are going to meet our 
shared climate goals while also bring-
ing greater investments to rural Amer-
ica, strengthening our farmers’ bottom 
lines, and lowering the cost of inputs. 
We can make investments in our Na-
tion’s producers by investing in exist-
ing voluntary conservation programs 
at USDA, and that is what this legisla-
tion does. 
I am proud that the conservation 
provisions in this bill reflect multiple 
pieces of legislation that I have cham-
pioned to make possible, including my 
bipartisan REAP Improvement Act. 
These provisions include stronger in-
vestments in the Rural Energy for 
America Program, or REAP, and sup-
port our conservation workforce and 
our Natural Resources Conservation 
Service. These are smart investments 
for the bottom lines of our farmers. 
Mr. SMITH of Missouri. Mr. Speaker, 
I reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. YARMUTH. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
1 minute to the gentleman from New 
York (Mr. JONES), a distinguished 
member of the Committee on the Judi-
ciary. 
Mr. JONES. Mr. Speaker, I am so 
proud to be standing here today in this 
Chamber as we make history for the 
American people. 
Democrats fought so hard for so long 
to get to this moment. Even when 
faced with what many described as in-
surmountable odds, we kept at it. We 
never gave up. We never relented in our 
advocacy. We said we wanted to get 
back to the negotiating table and that 
we wanted to start with climate. 
Now, we will make the biggest cli-
mate investment this Nation has ever 
seen, while creating millions of good- 
paying jobs. The stakes of the climate 
crisis could not be higher, especially 
for low-income communities and com-
munities of color around the country, 
who are always the hardest hit. 
This legislation is also for my grand-
mother, Alice Jones, who worked well 
past the age of retirement just to pay 
for the high cost of prescription drugs 
and medical procedures not fully cov-
ered by Medicare, as we know. Today, 
we will also lower prescription drug 
prices for our seniors. 
This is why I ran for Congress. This 
is government working for the people. 
This is Democrats delivering on our 
promises. 
Mr. 
SMITH 
of 
Missouri. 
Madam 
Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gen-
tleman 
from 
California 
(Mr. 
OBERNOLTE). 
Mr. OBERNOLTE. Madam Speaker, 
new data from the Department of 
Labor released this week indicates that 
inflation in America remains at a 40- 
year high. 
Numerous studies, including one by 
the San Francisco branch of our Fed-
eral Reserve Bank, indicate that the 
reason why Americans disproportion-
ately are suffering from this inflation 
is reckless levels of deficit spending by 
our Federal Government. 
Only the United States Congress 
could respond to the situation with a 
bill that increases Federal spending by 
over $700 billion at the same time it in-
creases taxes on Americans. 
To add insult to injury, our own Con-
gressional Budget Office, as well as the 
University of Pennsylvania Wharton 
School of Business, and hundreds of 
economists, tell us that this bill, the 
so-called Inflation Reduction Act, will 
not actually reduce inflation at all. 
We need to get our fiscal house in 
order and solve the reckless spending 
that is causing this inflation instead of 
taking action that makes the situation 
even worse. I urge a ‘‘no’’ vote. 
Mr. YARMUTH. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman 
from North Carolina (Ms. ROSS), a dis-
tinguished member of the Committee 
on the Judiciary. 
Ms. ROSS. Madam Speaker, I rise to 
support the Inflation Reduction Act. 
This bill is a monumental achieve-
ment that will move America forward, 
making important advances in every-
thing from healthcare costs to energy 
prices to tax fairness. 
Coming from North Carolina, a State 
battered with increasing regularity by 
catastrophic storms, I am especially 
proud that this act represents the most 
significant investment to combat cli-
mate change in U.S. history. 
I am also pleased that this bill in-
cludes a measure that I have cham-
pioned, which will end the prior mora-
torium on offshore wind. The Trump 
administration basically banned North 
Carolina from taking advantage of in-
dustrial-scale offshore wind. Our utili-
ties support it, it is good for our econ-
omy, and it is good for our environ-
ment. This is an important, game- 
changing bill. 
Mr. 
SMITH 
of 
Missouri. 
Madam 
Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gen-
tleman from Georgia (Mr. CLYDE), who 
definitely has experience with the IRS. 
Mr. CLYDE. Madam Speaker, despite 
the White House’s politically moti-
vated propaganda that claims our econ-
omy is in a transition with zero per-
cent inflation, the reality is we are fac-
ing an economic recession and continue 
to battle 40-year high inflation. 
As millions of Americans struggle to 
buy groceries, fill up their gas tanks, 
afford rent, and pay utility bills, 
Democrats are ramming through their 
tax-and-spend bill that will only make 
life worse. 
Now, I know the left can’t quite 
grasp the basics of high school biology, 
but it appears that they also need a 
lesson on the fundamentals of econom-
ics and basic math. 
But I don’t think they are interested 
in their much-needed schooling be-
cause their actions are intentional. 
Time and time again, the left proves 
their priorities lie with Big Govern-
ment socialism, not the American peo-
ple. Through increased IRS audits, 
they are willing to demolish any small 
business, worker, or family that gets in 
their way. 
Madam Speaker, I urge all my col-
leagues to reject fueling inflation and 
reject tax hikes during a recession by 
voting ‘‘no’’ on Democrats’ build back 
broke bill. 
Mr. YARMUTH. Madam Speaker, I 
reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. 
SMITH 
of 
Missouri. 
Madam 
Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gen-
tleman from Texas (Mr. ROY). 
Mr. ROY. Madam Speaker, my Demo-
cratic colleagues own this bill. Let’s be 
clear: 
Tax increases for the average Amer-
ican, check. 
$80 billion to the Internal Revenue 
Service to go after those Americans, to 
hire agents, jobs already posted, check.

August 12, 2022 
Increased 
electricity 
prices, 
in-
creased gas prices, tilted windmills 
with your unicorn energy policies, 
check. 
Increased government and corporate 
control of healthcare, check. 
I hear my colleagues talking about, 
‘‘Oh, we are going to go after pharma.’’ 
Well, what did the CDC say yesterday? 
Don’t worry about all of those man-
dates, don’t worry about all of those 
vaccines, and don’t worry about all the 
quarantines. Sorry, pox on us. 
But my colleagues now today are 
going to dump hundreds of billions of 
dollars into corporate America, screw-
ing over the American people every 
single day with tax audits, increased 
energy prices, and increased taxes. 
Congratulations. Take that to the 
polls. 
Mr. YARMUTH. Madam Speaker, I 
reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. 
SMITH 
of 
Missouri. 
Madam 
Speaker, may I inquire as to how much 
time is remaining? 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Ms. 
UNDERWOOD). The gentleman from Mis-
souri has 1 minute remaining. 
Mr. 
SMITH 
of 
Missouri. 
Madam 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
The solution to the inflation crisis 
that the Democrats have set forward is 
to spend hundreds of billions of more 
dollars and to tax all hardworking 
Americans once again. 
You cannot spend your way out of in-
flation, and you cannot tax your way 
out of recession. But that is the recipe 
that the one-party, Democrat rule in 
Washington, D.C., has suggested for the 
hardworking Americans who are barely 
surviving to put food on their table, 
clothes on their backs, and gasoline in 
their cars. 
I will point out to the chairman that 
his President’s budget outlined an ad-
ditional $80 billion for the IRS. High-
lighted in that budget he wanted 87,000 
IRS agents. That is where the number 
is coming from, from your President, 
who provided a budget. 
I know in the Budget Committee, we 
have never had a hearing on budget for 
the last 31⁄2 years. That is probably why 
you didn’t know 87,000 auditors were in 
the President’s budget. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. YARMUTH. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself the balance of my time. 
Madam Speaker, I want to remind 
my Republican colleagues and the 
American people, once again, what Re-
publicans will be voting against today. 
They will be voting against cutting 
prescription drug prices for their con-
stituents. They will be voting against 
combating inflation and lowering en-
ergy costs. They will be voting against 
the largest Federal investment in deal-
ing with climate crisis in the history of 
this country. 
I cannot believe that I still heard 
from the other side today the hoax 
comment, that climate change is a 
hoax. You would think that as we 
watch what is going on in the world, 
while I watch what is going on in my 
State, when my citizens in eastern 
Kentucky were devastated by historic 
floods, when my citizens in western 
Kentucky were devastated by historic 
tornadoes, all of which scientists have 
said 
were 
exacerbated 
by 
climate 
change, that there are still people who 
deny that climate change exists. 
But for the first time in this country, 
we will show true leadership to the 
world, that we are taking action, and 
we are going to lead the world in com-
bating climate change. 
The 
gentleman 
from 
Texas 
said 
Democrats own this bill. Yes, we do. 
Proud of it. I don’t know one member 
of the Democratic Caucus who is not 
thrilled to death today that we are 
doing what we are doing, because the 
vast majority of the American people 
support what we are doing. The vast 
majority of the American people want 
us to cap out-of-pocket expenses for 
seniors for their medications at $2,000. 
Republicans say no. They are going 
to vote against that. They are going to 
vote against a cap of a $35 copay for in-
sulin. Tens of millions of Americans 
will benefit from that. 
We know that five former Secretaries 
of the Treasury from both Democratic 
and Republican administrations, 126 of 
our Nation’s top economists, including 
seven Nobel Laureates, support the In-
flation Reduction Act. 
On other side, we have Big Pharma, 
corporate lobbyists, tax cheats, and 
congressional Republicans. 
This debate has made clearer than 
ever that Democrats are working to 
make life better for the American peo-
ple while Republicans just don’t care. 
It is as simple as it is harsh. 
This legislation is important, his-
toric, and a significant win for Amer-
ican families and for the planet. 
I will be voting ‘‘yes’’ on the Infla-
tion Reduction Act, and soon we will 
be sending it to President Biden’s desk 
to be signed into law. I know he will be 
proud to do that as well. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from Massachusetts (Mr. NEAL) 
and the gentleman from Texas (Mr. 
BRADY) each will control 30 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from Massachusetts. 
Mr. NEAL. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
As we begin the proceeding here on 
the Ways and Means portion of the leg-
islation, I want to begin by calling at-
tention to the untimely and tragic loss 
of our colleague, Jackie Walorski, and 
two members of her staff. 
Jackie was a force on the committee, 
as well as the ranking member of the 
Subcommittee on Worker and Family 
Support. She led with deep commit-
ment to children and families and was 
well regarded as a member of the com-
munity, a real humanitarian. 
You couldn’t miss her bright smile or 
her booming laugh. She embodied what 
it meant to serve. 
When she called me ‘‘Mr. Chairman,’’ 
as she always did in the hallway, loud-
ly, with a booming voice, I know she 
meant it. 
We were all lucky to have had her as 
a colleague and even luckier to be able 
to call her a friend. 
The families and loved ones of Con-
gresswoman Walorski, Emma Thom-
son, and Zachery Potts remain in our 
thoughts and prayers. May they rest in 
peace, as valued Members of the Ways 
and Means family. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in full support 
of the Inflation Reduction Act. I look 
forward, as I have in the past, to this 
moment, reciting the wisdom that is 
often referenced by me, because the 
words come from another son of Massa-
chusetts, Mr. Webster. 
Over the Speaker’s rostrum that 
adorns 
this 
marvelous 
institution, 
which I love, the quote is simple: ‘‘Let 
us develop the resources of our land, 
call forth its powers, build up its insti-
tutions, and promote all its great in-
terests and see whether we also in our 
day and generation may not perform 
something worthy to be remembered.’’ 
The Inflation Reduction Act is some-
thing worthy of being remembered. 
This is substantive and transformative 
legislation, a reminder to all that in 
the legislative life and its rhythms, we 
generally pursue perfection but accept 
the possible. Part of that is what we 
are marking at this moment. 
This is a historic win for family 
pocketbooks, for Americans’ health, 
and for the future of climate security. 
We fund these gains by ensuring that 
large, profitable companies pay their 
fair share, just like all members of the 
American family are asked to do. 
b 1315 
The Inflation Reduction Act will 
lower costs. For the first time, Medi-
care will negotiate drug prices, and 
there will be a cap on what comes out 
of seniors’ pockets for their lifesaving 
prescriptions. No more rationing or 
forgoing necessary medicines. 
We are lowering healthcare costs for 
millions of low-income and middle-in-
come Americans by extending the Af-
fordable Care Act’s premium tax credit 
enhancements through 2025. 
Let me give you a statistic that is 
compelling. Madam Speaker, 100 per-
cent of the children in Massachusetts 
have health insurance, and 97 percent 
of the adults in Massachusetts have 
health insurance. It polls extraor-
dinarily well in terms of its success ra-
tios because we decided—labor, busi-
ness, Democrat, and Republican—to 
make it work, and we did. 
These enhanced premium credits, 
first enacted by the American Rescue 
Plan, have made way for record-low un-
insured rates that have put hundreds of 
dollars back into the pockets of low- 
and middle-income Americans. 
This legislation will also make the 
largest investment in tackling climate

change that our Nation has ever wit-
nessed. The investments in clean en-
ergy, energy efficiency, and clean man-
ufacturing will generate 9 million 
good-paying jobs. 
These historic wins are achieved with 
sensible and responsible multiyear in-
vestments in the IRS. 
I have been a member of the Ways 
and Means Committee, Madam Speak-
er, for 30 years. Let me give our friends 
an 
interesting 
statistic 
about 
the 
American family. We have the highest 
voluntary 
compliance 
rate 
in 
the 
world. Eighty-six percent of the Amer-
ican people pay their taxes. This idea 
that we are creating 87,000 armed rep-
resentatives of the Federal Govern-
ment to go out and harass the Amer-
ican people is nonsensical. Retirements 
alone are going to require a sub-
stantive investment. The IRS has fewer 
than 20 percent of the employees that 
it once did. 
What is important to remember here 
is this: We want to make sure with this 
investment in the IRS that we con-
tinue to have a high voluntary compli-
ance rate and also to invest in the nec-
essary technology that will allow the 
modeling to make sure compliance re-
mains with us, as well. 
These are historical investments and 
achievements, and they also are going 
to continue our quest on the Demo-
cratic side here for an element of tax 
fairness that will hold people at the 
very top as responsible as the other 
side likes to hold people who receive 
the EITC tax credit in terms of their 
request for audits. We do this simply 
by asking the most powerful among us 
to pay their fair share. This is what a 
full and fair tax administration is 
about. 
The 
American 
people 
have 
been 
through an unthinkable hardship over 
the last 21⁄2 years, but they entrusted 
Joe Biden and congressional Democrats 
to keep them safe and to rebuild our 
economy. 
Here is a fact: On March 11, 2020, Dr. 
Fauci gave his warning. He warned us 
of what was coming. In April 2020, 
America had lost 22 million jobs. Here 
we are, 2 years later, in the Biden ad-
ministration, and every job has been 
returned. There are 10.6 million jobs 
that go unanswered right now in the 
American economy. 
We have bounced back faster than we 
imagined. Not only have all these jobs 
been returned, but for 51 straight days, 
gasoline prices have fallen. 
That is an issue about supply and de-
mand, by the way. It is about inter-
national events, including the Russian 
invasion of Ukraine and supply chains 
across the world. Those chains that I 
have just referenced have been shored 
up, and retailers are starting to real-
istically address some speculation as it 
relates to price. 
Democrats shouldn’t be asked to do 
this alone, but we are being asked to do 
it today alone. 
We are going to hear a lot of Wash-
ington talk from folks on the other 
side that want to address the politics 
of the situation rather than cap the 
cost of insulin for their constituents. 
They want to protect the pocketbooks 
of those who would raise prescription 
drug prices unnecessarily and cut costs 
for workers and their families, which 
we intend to do. 
You are going to hear a lot of spin on 
this bill that has received a lot of en-
dorsements, 
even 
from 
bipartisan 
former Treasury Secretaries, but that 
is because the opponents are out of op-
tions. 
The Inflation Reduction Act sets our 
Nation on a healthier, fairer, and more 
prosperous path. We have heard the 
calls of the American people, and with 
the Inflation Reduction Act, we con-
tinue to win this moment for them in 
its totality. 
Madam Speaker, I urge our col-
leagues to support this legislation, and 
I reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. BRADY. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Madam Speaker, I join Chairman 
NEAL in expressing our heartbreak and 
sorrow in losing Congresswoman Jack-
ie Walorski, our colleague, as well as 
Zachery and Emma. She was so proud 
of her Team Walorski folks. 
The truth of the matter is, Jackie lit 
up every room she was in with her pas-
sion and her brilliance and her friend-
ship and warmness. There is no ques-
tion she could do everything. She was 
all in on everything and worked hard 
to find common ground wherever she 
could. 
Last week was a shocking week and a 
week to mourn. This week is a time to 
celebrate Jackie, her legacy, and her 
life. 
Sadly, 
this 
massive 
Senate 
bill, 
drawn in secret, stuffed with govern-
ment checks to the wealthy and fa-
vored interests, and rushed through 
Congress is a hoax on the American 
people. It fails to reduce inflation, fails 
to reduce the budget deficit, and fails 
to reduce the world’s temperature. 
Who in their right mind raises taxes 
in a recession? The answer is only 
President Biden and his supporters in 
Congress who bungled this economic 
recovery think that is a good idea. You 
remember them. They told you they 
would defeat COVID, that inflation was 
a rich person’s problem, that their $2 
trillion spending spree last spring 
would strengthen the economy. 
Instead, what did their promises de-
liver? The worst inflation in 40 years, a 
recession, 
and 
a 
crippling 
worker 
shortage that continues to hammer 
Main Street businesses. 
Today, we have a shrinking economy, 
shrinking paychecks, and a shrinking 
workforce. 
Families 
are 
skipping 
meals, running up credit card debt to 
pay for daily essentials, delaying re-
tirement, and struggling to afford gas 
just to drive to work. Yet, Democrats 
today insist inflation doesn’t even 
exist. They say it is zero. 
The truth is, most Americans have 
lost confidence in President Biden’s 
failed handling of the economy. By 
contrast, the majority of the jobs in 
the COVID recovery came under Presi-
dent Trump, and under Republican 
leadership, paychecks grew twice as 
fast as prices. The economy was surg-
ing, not shrinking like it is today, and 
600,000 more Americans were working 
than today under this unpopular White 
House. 
Why would you trust the same Demo-
crats responsible for this cruel econ-
omy with another of their misguided 
spending bills? 
While other countries are lowering 
taxes to fight inflation, Democrats im-
posed over $350 billion in taxes that 
land on local manufacturers that build 
right here in America. It will kill jobs, 
slow the economy, and raise prices 
even higher. 
Small businesses, which hire nearly 
half of all workers in America, get 
hammered with $50 billion in new 
taxes. 
Senior citizens and savers will bear 
the impact of $74 billion in new taxes 
that punish companies from investing 
in their stock value. 
All these taxes will hurt the econ-
omy, drive inflation further, and harm 
workers’ paychecks, according to the 
independent Tax Foundation. 
Democrats promise that no American 
will ‘‘see a penny’’ of tax hikes, yet 
Congress’ own budget office debunks 
that claim, confirming the largest bur-
den of higher taxes will come from 
middle-class 
families 
starting 
next 
year. 
President Biden is violating his own 
pledge not to raise taxes on middle- 
class Americans. He is denying that 
truth. 
Yesterday, House Democrats insisted 
there are no new IRS agents funded in 
this bill. Read their lips: No new IRS 
agents. 
They 
say 
it 
is 
all 
fearmongering, and they are just hiring 
replacements. 
Unfortunately, the fact is the IRS 
budget already budgets for those who 
are leaving through attrition, and the 
Treasury Department itself outlines 
the next decade of adding 87,000 new 
IRS agents. That is what this bill 
unleashes. 
In fact, the Congressional Budget Of-
fice reports ‘‘audit rates will increase 
for every income level,’’ that almost 90 
percent 
of 
unreported 
tax 
income 
comes from who? The middle class. 
How will Democrats collect $204 bil-
lion in more taxes? With thousands of 
new agents targeting what I would call 
Walmart shoppers. You know them. 
They are real, hardworking American 
families. They are my constituents. 
They are my neighbors in my district. 
They are living paycheck to paycheck, 
struggling with inflation and higher 
gas prices. They will be hit with over 
700,000 new audits, thanks to a sky-
rocketing surge in IRS agents. 
Maybe 
that 
is 
why 
Democrats 
blocked any language in the Senate 
that protects Walmart shoppers and 
other value-shopping families against

these new IRS audits. But, man, this 
bill, they love the wealthy. If the 
Green New Deal and corporate welfare 
had a baby, it would look like this. 
Nearly one-quarter of a trillion dollars 
in Green New Deal subsidies, govern-
ment handouts, go to the wealthy and 
to the biggest, most successful busi-
nesses in America. 
Look at this: A single working mom 
will pay higher taxes so they can be 
sent in a government check to wealthy 
investors and massive corporations. A 
yardman will send his taxes in a gov-
ernment check to the very well-to-do 
family whose lawn he is cutting so 
they can splurge on an $80,000 luxury 
electric vehicle. 
Incredibly, to fund all these govern-
ment handouts, every Senate Democrat 
and the Vice President chose to impose 
higher taxes on small businesses so 
that 
millionaires 
and 
billionaires 
would be protected from higher State 
and local taxes. 
Everyone facing devastating diseases 
like cancer, Alzheimer’s, ALS, and Par-
kinson’s will pay a deadly price. 
This crazy bill increases the cost of 
healthcare and medicines and kills new 
lifesaving 
cures 
while 
providing 
ObamaCare subsidies for the wealthy 
and those choosing not to return to 
work, making the worker shortage 
harsher. 
Congress’ nonpartisan scorekeeper, 
the Penn Wharton School of Business, 
and the University of Chicago all con-
firm 
the 
government 
price-fixing 
scheme could be a death sentence for 
patients, raising the costs of new 
drugs, crushing innovation, and killing 
hundreds of cures. 
Higher taxes, harassing IRS audits 
on our Walmart shoppers, no relief 
from inflation, all as America battles a 
recession. 
Let me ask again: Do you really 
trust the same President and Demo-
crats who drove this economy into re-
cession and drove prices sky high with 
yet another spending spree? 
Madam Speaker, I strongly urge my 
colleagues to vote ‘‘no’’ on this bill, 
and I reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. NEAL. Madam Speaker, I yield 
11⁄2 minutes to the very accomplished 
gentleman from Connecticut (Mr. LAR-
SON). 
Mr. LARSON of Connecticut. Madam 
Speaker, I start by echoing the senti-
ments that both the chairman and the 
ranking member had about Jackie 
Walorski and how deeply we all feel for 
her and her family and the staff mem-
bers who were lost. 
I congratulate Mr. NEAL
and also 
members of this committee, most nota-
bly 
Mr. 
THOMPSON
and 
Mr. 
BLU-
MENAUER, as well, for their work on cli-
mate 
change 
and 
for 
their 
work 
throughout this period of putting for-
ward consequential legislation. I say 
‘‘consequential’’ in the time I am allot-
ted because I want to talk and focus 
specifically on some of these claims. 
I hope the American people are lis-
tening. You don’t bring about change 
by appealing to the sum total of the 
fears of the American people. You 
bring about change aspirationally and 
by doing something constructive and 
putting forward legislation as opposed 
to putting forward the collective fears 
of a nation and hoping that you might 
be able to exploit those fears for polit-
ical gain. 
The myth that there are 87,000 IRS 
agents, even Trump’s former person re-
jects that. It is nonsense, as Mr. NEAL 
has pointed out. 
What matters to people is when you 
help them directly, like Rod Yearwood 
in West Hartford, Connecticut, who is 
paying $1,400 a month for his insur-
ance, but now, under this bill, is paying 
$20 a month. The real savings he gets 
from that allows him to provide for a 
college education for his children. As-
piration.

Mr. BRADY. Madam Speaker, I in-
clude in the RECORD Page 16 of the De-
partment of the Treasury’s tax compli-
ance plan, which shows the agency in-
tends to hire 87,000 new IRS employees. 
RESTORING IRS RESOURCES 
The first step in the President’s efforts to 
restore IRS enforcement capability is a sus-
tained, multi-year commitment to rebuild-
ing the IRS. This involves spending nearly 
$80 billion on IRS priorities over the course 
of the decade including hiring new special-
ized enforcement staff, modernizing anti-
quated information technology, and invest-
ing in meaningful taxpayer service—includ-
ing the implementation of the newly ex-
panded credits aimed at providing support to 
American families. Importantly, the addi-
tional resources will go toward enforcement 
against those with the highest incomes, and 
audit rates will not rise relative to recent 
years for those earning less than $400,000 in 
actual income. 
The President’s proposal includes two com-
ponents: a dedicated stream of mandatory 
funds ($72.5 billion over a decade) and a pro-
gram integrity allocation ($6.7 billion over a 
decade). These mechanisms provide for a sus-
tained, multi-year commitment to revital-
izing the IRS that will give the agency the 
certainty it needs to rebuild. 
The IRS proposal includes year-by-year es-
timates of the additional resources that will 
be directed toward the agency as well as the 
specific activities that these resources would 
support. The design ensures that the IRS is 
able to absorb and usefully deploy additional 
resources over the entire 10-year horizon and 
keeps budget growth manageable at around 
10 percent per year. 
Mr. BRADY. Madam Speaker, I yield 
1 minute to the gentleman from Okla-
homa (Mr. HERN). 
Mr. HERN. I rise today in strong op-
position to the bill before us today. 
Never in our history has the Federal 
Government responded to a recession 
by raising taxes on Americans. It is 
simply unthinkable. 
Nearly everything our colleagues 
across the aisle have said about this 
bill has been proven false. I have no-
ticed they have stopped calling it the 
inflation legislation because they know 
it is not true. They are hailing it as a 
climate and tax plan. I will give them 
that because this legislation will raise 
American taxes and give that money to 
handpicked socialist green companies. 
I wouldn’t be proud of that if I were 
them. 
What this bill will absolutely do is 
not reduce inflation. In fact, even lib-
eral economists are warning it will do 
the exact opposite. 
Just today, 56 percent of Democrats 
and 91 percent of Independents are now 
gravely concerned with the direction of 
our economy. I have received thou-
sands of phone calls, text messages, 
and emails from my constituents over 
the last week pleading with me to stop 
this bill from passing. They understand 
what half of this Chamber does not. 
When the Federal Government spends 
more, American families have less. I 
find nothing redeemable in this legisla-
tion and, therefore, I urge my col-
leagues to vote a resounding ‘‘no.’’ 
Mr. NEAL. Madam Speaker, I yield 
11⁄2 minutes to the gentleman from Or-
egon (Mr. BLUMENAUER), who has had a 
profound influence on the renewable 
energy part of this legislation. 
Mr. BLUMENAUER. Madam Speaker, 
I thank the chairman, and I appreciate 
his leadership and his courtesy. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
this 
legislative 
package is something that refuses to 
die. It will reduce inflation, lower en-
ergy costs, and lower the cost of pre-
scription drugs. But it is not just about 
inflation, it is about addressing the cli-
mate crisis and the crisis of confidence 
in government. 
Last week, President Biden met with 
some of the foremost experts on the 
Presidency and American democracy to 
better understand the critical state 
that we are now in with the future of 
our democracy and how we avoid its 
destruction. 
We have our moment of making 
American history now. It is our mo-
ment for the future of our planet, for 
our children and grandchildren, and 
ourselves. 
I am pleased to have worked for over 
a decade on these provisions dealing 
with green energy, investment tax 
credits, energy efficiency in commer-
cial buildings, and legislation to make 
polluters pay by reinstating the Super-
fund tax. 
Seniors and working families will see 
significant savings by allowing Medi-
care to negotiate drug prices and cap-
ping the monthly cost of prescriptions, 
something the Republicans made ille-
gal in 2004. 
And critically, it takes steps to re-
store the ability of the IRS to function, 
closing the $400 billion tax gap and not 
making the American public pay for 
poor customer service because of their 
mindless attack on this important in-
stitution. 
Because the Inflation Reduction Act 
represents more than the sum of these 
individual provisions, it is proof that 
our system works and that the United 
States has the capacity to solve our 
most pressing challenges in the years 
ahead just when we need it most.

clude in the RECORD

U.S. CONGRESS, 
CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET OFFICE, 
Washington, DC, August 4, 2022. 
Re Economic Analysis of Budget Reconcili-
ation Legislation 
Hon. LINDSEY GRAHAM, 
Ranking Member, Committee on the Budget, 
U.S. Senate, Washington, DC. 
DEAR
SENATOR: Yesterday, the Congres-
sional Budget Office published a cost esti-
mate for H.R. 5376, the Inflation Reduction 
Act of 2022, which is the latest version of the 
reconciliation legislation in the Senate.1 
This letter provides answers to four ques-
tions you asked related to that bill and 
broader economic conditions. 
IS THE UNITED STATES CURRENTLY IN A 
RECESSION? 
The U.S. economy shows signs of slowing, 
but whether the economy is currently in a 
recession is difficult to say. It is possible 
that, in retrospect, it will become apparent 
that the economy moved into recession 
sometime this year. However, that is not 
clear from data that were available at the 
beginning of August. Some key metrics indi-
cate a decline in economic activity as the 
first half of this year progressed, whereas 
others indicate continued growth, though 
generally at a slower rate than previously. 
Real gross domestic product (that is, GDP 
adjusted to remove the effects of inflation) 
and industrial production have both de-
clined. In particular, real GDP declined by 
an average of 1.25 percent (at an annual rate) 
in the first two quarters of 2022. Industrial 
production grew from January to April, was 
essentially unchanged in May, and then de-
clined in June. 
Other key indicators of economic activity 
have continued to increase in the first half of 
2022, though generally at a slower rate than 
they had previously. For instance, real gross 
domestic income (GDI) increased at an an-
nual rate of 1.8 percent in the first quarter of 
2022 after growing by an average rate of 6.3 
percent in the second half of 2021.2 (Second- 
quarter data for GDI are not yet available.) 
Real personal income minus transfer pay-
ments to people by federal, state, and local 
governments grew at an average annual rate 
of 0.5 percent in the first half of 2022 versus 
3.1 percent in the second half of 2021. And 
real personal consumption expenditures grew 
at an average annual rate of 1.4 percent in 
the first half of 2022 (with somewhat slower 
growth in the second quarter than in the 
first), compared with 2.2 percent in the sec-
ond half of 2021. One reason for the decelera-
tion in personal consumption expenditures is 
higher inflation, which has eroded con-
sumers’ purchasing power. Another reason is 
that real disposable personal income has de-
clined in the first half of 2022. Savings accu-
mulated during the coronavirus pandemic, 
including from transfer payments, have con-
tinued to support consumption. 
The labor market remains tight, with low 
unemployment and elevated job vacancies, 
but both measures have softened in recent 
months. Net gains in nonfarm payroll em-
ployment averaged 375,000 jobs per month in 
the second quarter of 2022 compared with 
539,000 jobs, on net, added per month in the 
first quarter and 590,000 jobs, on net, added 
per month in the second half of 2021. In June 
2022, the unemployment rate was 3.6 percent 
(unchanged 
since 
March 
and 
near 
its 
prepandemic low) and there were about 1.8 
job vacancies for every unemployed worker 
(one of the highest readings in the near 22- 
year history of this series though down from 
its highest level of 2.0 in March). 
HOW WOULD ENACTING THE BILL AFFECT 
INFLATION IN 2022 AND 2023? 
In calendar year 2022, enacting the bill 
would have a negligible effect on inflation, 
in CBO’s assessment. In calendar year 2023, 
inflation would probably be between 0.1 per-
centage point lower and 0.1 percentage point 
higher under the bill than it would be under 
current law, CBO estimates. That range of 
likely outcomes reflects uncertainty about 
how various provisions of the bill would af-
fect overall demand and output, the supply 
of labor, the persistence of disruptions in the 
supply of goods and services, and how the 
Federal Reserve would respond to offset any 
increase in inflationary pressure. Respon-
siveness to the enhancement of health insur-
ance subsidies established by the Affordable 
Care Act is the most important factor boost-
ing inflationary pressure, and responsiveness 
to the new alternative minimum tax on cor-
porations is the most important factor re-
ducing inflationary pressure. The range ap-
plies to multiple measures of inflation: the 
GDP price index, the personal consumption 
expenditures price index, and the consumer 
price index for all urban consumers. 
In its analysis of the inflationary effects of 
the bill, CBO used an approach similar to 
that underlying the agency’s estimates of 
the short-term effects of legislation enacted 
in 2021.3 The agency augmented its analysis 
to account for the effects of supply disrup-
tions and for the amount of tightness or 
slack in the economy on the inflationary ef-
fects of fiscal policy. 
Key inputs into the analysis of inflation 
were the effects of the bill on overall demand 
for goods and services. In the short term, 
changes in fiscal policies affect the economy 
primarily by influencing the demand for 
goods and services by consumers, businesses, 
and governments, which leads to changes in 
output. Factors increasing overall demand 
push inflation up and those decreasing over-
all demand push inflation down. To estimate 
the effects of changes in federal spending and 
revenues on overall demand and output, CBO 
considered evidence about the effects of 
similar policies in the past and used results 
produced by macroeconomic models.4 
CBO expects different provisions of the leg-
islation to affect overall demand and output 
differently.5 For example, provisions that di-
rectly increase government purchases of 
goods and services would add to overall de-
mand on a dollar-for-dollar basis. Increases 
in financial support to people, such as 
through enhanced health insurance sub-
sidies, would boost spending more among 
lower-income people than among higher-in-
come people, partly because lower-income 
households typically consume a higher frac-
tion of their additional disposable income 
than higher-income households do. Thus, fi-
nancial assistance to lower-income house-
holds would boost the overall demand for 
goods and services more than financial as-
sistance to higher-income households would. 
Changes to business taxes that affect after- 
tax profits on past investments—as opposed 
to the return on new investments—would 
have relatively small effects on overall de-
mand, in CBO’s assessment. 
CBO used its estimates of the bill’s net ef-
fects on the deficit as the starting point for 
its analysis of overall effects on demand (see 
Table 1). The enhanced health insurance sub-
sidies and energy-related subsidies were the 
largest contributors to increases in the def-
icit. The new alternative minimum tax on 
corporations was the largest contributor to 
reductions in the deficit. For each dollar 
change in the deficit, the increases in sub-
sidies would probably have larger effects on 
overall demand (boosting it) than the in-
creases in revenues (which would reduce 
overall demand). Those factors could con-
tribute to the effects on output and inflation 
being positive even when the overall deficit 
was reduced.

Data source: Congressional Budget Office. 
The estimated budgetary effects are of H.R. 5376, as amended in the na-
ture of a substitute (ERN22335) and posted on the website of the Senate 
Majority Leader on July 27, 2022. Components may not sum to totals be-
cause of rounding. 
The budgetary effects in fiscal years 2023 and 2024 informed CBO’s 
analysis of the economic effects in calendar year 2023. The analysis in-
cluded the effects on the deficit from higher revenues resulting from in-
creased funding for the Internal Revenue Service. Under guidelines agreed to 
by the legislative and executive branches, those effects are not included in 
the total line from CBO’s cost estimate reporting the net effect on the def-
icit. Thus, the effects shown in the memorandum are additional. Those reve-
nues constitute a shift in resources from the private sector to the govern-
ment that would reduce demand and thus reduce inflationary pressure. 
Enacting the bill would also reduce some 
businesses’ incentives to invest through 
changes in the after-tax return on private in-
vestment, pushing down output and infla-
tion. (See the answer to the fourth question 
in this letter for further discussion.) In addi-
tion, enacting the bill would reduce the in-
centives of some people to work, mainly be-
cause of the enhanced health insurance sub-
sidies, pushing down output and pushing up 
inflation. 
Enacting the bill would affect economic 
activity and inflation beyond 2023. CBO has 
not evaluated those effects. 
WHAT IS THE HIGHEST AMOUNT OF INCOME THAT 
PEOPLE QUALIFYING FOR EXPANDED HEALTH 
INSURANCE SUBSIDIES WOULD EARN? 
The answer to your question depends on 
people’s age and geographic location, and the 
number of enrollees in the family. On the 
basis of nationwide average premiums pro-
jected for 2023 under the bill, CBO estimates 
the following: 
A 64-year-old would receive a premium tax 
credit if his or her income did not exceed 
$163,700 in that year. 
A 21-year-old would receive a premium tax 
credit if his or her income did not exceed 
$54,600. 
A family of four consisting of individuals 
ages 50, 50, 21, and 21 would receive a pre-
mium tax credit if their household income 
was no greater than $304,100. 
A younger family of four, consisting of 
people ages 24, 24, 5, and 5, would receive a 
premium tax credit if the household’s in-
come was no more than $192,700. 
Premium tax credits are used to lower peo-
ple’s out-of-pocket monthly premium con-
tributions for health insurance obtained 
through the marketplaces established by the 
Affordable Care Act. The amount of the cred-
it is calculated as the difference between the 
benchmark premium for health insurance 
(that is, the premium for the second-lowest- 
cost silver plan available in a region) for the 
individual or family and a specified max-
imum contribution, expressed as a percent-
age of modified adjusted gross income. Those 
benchmark premiums are also a function of 
age, geographic location, and the number of 
enrollees. For example, the premium for a 64- 
year-old is three times that for a 21-year-old 
in most states. The premium tax credit is

thus correspondingly larger for older people 
than for younger people. 
The likelihood that the benchmark pre-
mium will exceed a person’s maximum con-
tribution—and that the person will therefore 
receive a premium tax credit—declines at 
higher income levels. For those whose in-
come is above 400 percent of the federal pov-
erty guideline, or $54,400 for a single person 
in 2023, their maximum contribution would 
be 8.5 percent of income through 2025 under 
the bill. 
This analysis is based on nationwide aver-
age premiums. For people living in states 
with premiums that are above or below the 
average, the income at which they would no 
longer be eligible for a premium tax credit 
would be higher or lower. 
WHAT EFFECT WOULD A NEW ALTERNATIVE MIN-
IMUM TAX ON CORPORATIONS HAVE ON BUSI-
NESS INVESTMENT AND GDP? 
Section 10101 of H.R. 5376 would increase 
taxes on corporations by imposing a new al-
ternative minimum tax equal to 15 percent 
of income reported on financial statements 
by certain large corporations—specifically, 
those whose adjusted financial statement in-
come exceeds $1 billion. The staff of the 
Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT) esti-
mates that the provision would increase fed-
eral revenues by $313.1 billion over the 2023– 
2031 period (with $96.6 billion of that amount 
being generated in fiscal years 2023 and 2024). 
JCT has projected that approximately 150 
corporations would be subject to the new tax 
each year and that just under half of the rev-
enues would come from the manufacturing 
sector.6 
In CBO’s assessment, the proposed new cor-
porate minimum tax would reduce the incen-
tive for those large corporations to invest, 
primarily by limiting the tax benefit of ac-
celerated depreciation and by decreasing the 
after-tax return on their new investment. 
According to the generally accepted ac-
counting principles that are used for pre-
paring financial statements, firms must de-
duct the cost of investments over the full 
useful life of the asset. In contrast, various 
provisions 
of 
the 
tax 
code—including 
‘‘bonus’’ depreciation—allow firms to deduct 
investment expenses more quickly, increas-
ing the tax benefit of those deductions and 
the expected after-tax return on the invest-
ments. By setting a new minimum tax, sec-
tion 10101 would limit the tax benefit of ac-
celerated depreciation for affected corpora-
tions and, all else being equal, reduce their 
business investment. 
The provision would also affect private in-
vestment by increasing federal revenues and, 
all else being equal, by reducing the federal 
deficit and the amount of federal debt. Less 
government borrowing would increase the 
amount of funds available for private invest-
ment and put downward pressure on interest 
rates, which would have a positive effect on 
business investment, in CBO’s view. 
The net effect on business investment, and 
hence on GDP, would depend on the relative 
magnitudes of the direct incentive effect and 
the indirect effect resulting from the change 
in the federal budget deficit. Additionally, 
the net effect would depend on overall eco-
nomic conditions. 
Other provisions of the Inflation Reduction 
Act would also affect incentives to invest. 
Thus, the legislation’s overall impact on 
business investment and GDP would differ 
from that of just this provision considered 
by itself. 
I hope that this information is useful to 
you. 
Sincerely, 
PHILLIP L. SWAGEL, 
Director.

Mr. BRADY. Madam Speaker, I yield 
1 minute to the gentleman from Texas 
(Mr. ARRINGTON). 
Mr. ARRINGTON. Madam Speaker, 
the last time my Democrat colleagues 
used reconciliation to jam through a 
massive partisan spending spree, it was 
under the pretense of COVID recovery. 
Not only did they ‘‘fail to rescue Amer-
ica,’’ they destroyed our recovery ef-
forts and sent us spiraling into reces-
sion. 
Now, in the aftermath of their self- 
inflicted economic disaster, my Demo-
crat colleagues’ response is to run the 
same play and expect a different result. 
Another false promise under the 
guise of a grandiose title, the Inflation 
Reduction Act. 
Nobody in America, Madam Speaker, 
believes that this bill will reduce infla-
tion. In fact, it is going to make infla-
tion worse by imposing massive tax 
hikes on U.S. job creators, strangling 
domestic 
oil 
and 
gas 
production, 
unleashing an army of tens of thou-
sands of IRS agents to shake down 
working families and small businesses, 
handing out hundreds of billions of dol-
lars in Green New Deal giveaways that 
will jeopardize America’s energy secu-
rity, putting America in the same posi-
tion of weakness as our European al-
lies. 
Mark my words, Madam Speaker, 
this bill will further fuel inflation, 
deepen our recession, cripple our com-
petitiveness, and increase costs at the 
pump. 
Mr. NEAL. Madam Speaker, I yield 
11⁄2 minutes to the gentleman from Wis-
consin (Mr. KIND), who is retiring but 
has made many valued contributions to 
our Nation and committee. 
Mr. KIND. Madam Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman for yielding. 
Madam Speaker, as a dear friend of 
Jackie Walorski, I share in the grief of 
her passing and her staff’s passing. It is 
very tragic. 
Madam Speaker, this Inflation Re-
duction Act is historic legislation. It 
puts people over politics by lowering 
families’ kitchen-table costs from pre-
scription drugs to their energy ex-
penses, creates millions of good-paying 
jobs, delivers the most significant ac-
tion to combat climate change when 
Mother Nature is screaming at us to 
take action today, and it substantially 
reduces the deficit by over $300 billion. 
Now, on that last point, Madam 
Speaker, not once has a Republican-led 
Congress brought a reconciliation bill 
to the floor that was paid for, let alone 
reduces the national deficit. 
In fact, as an example, when they 
passed their prescription drug bill in 
2004, not only did they not pay for it, 
not one nickel of it was offset. Over 
$400 billion, the largest expansion of 
entitlement funding since the creation 
of Social Security and Medicare, but 
there were no offsets. 
When we passed the Affordable Care 
Act a little over 10 years ago, not only 
did we pay for it, but we also reduced 
the deficit. Just this week, it was an-
nounced that health uninsured rates is 
at an all-time historic low for our 
country, no less due to that Affordable 
Care Act. 
Madam Speaker, they made that pre-
scription drug bill even worse when 
they passed it by inserting language in 
it that specifically made it illegal for 
us to discuss prices or negotiate prices 
with the drug companies. This bill 
changes that today by allowing once 
and for all some price negotiation with 
the drug companies to deliver real re-
lief for our seniors. 
Madam Speaker, I encourage my col-
leagues to support this legislation. 
Mr. BRADY. Madam Speaker, I in-
clude in the RECORD the Joint Com-
mittee 
on 
Taxation 
analysis 
that 
shows that families earning $75,000 or 
$100,000 are four times more likely to 
have a tax hike under this bill than a 
tax cut. 
NONPARTISAN
TAX
SCOREKEEPER: AVERAGE 
WORKING FAMILY IS MORE LIKELY TO BE 
WORSE OFF THAN BETTER OFF UNDER DEMO-
CRATS’ TAX PLAN 
Working families will be worse off under 
Democrats’ higher taxes, according to a new 
analysis from the nonpartisan Joint Com-
mittee on Taxation. This is another dev-
astating blow for families after the Congres-
sional Budget Office revealed that Demo-
crats’ supercharged IRS expects to grab $20 
billion from lower- and middle-income earn-
ers. 
WORKING FAMILIES AT HIGH RISK OF TAX HIKES 
Democrats have once again tried to hide 
the real effects of this bill. New analysis 
from the nonpartisan Joint Committee on 
Taxation (JCT) shows that the average 
working family is more likely to be worse-off 
than better-off under Democrats’ tax plan. 
For 
median-income 
families 
earning 
$50,000–$75,000, households are 33 percent 
more likely to have a tax hike than a tax 
cut. 
It gets worse for every dollar earned—fami-
lies earning $75,000–$100,000 are four times 
more likely to have a tax hike than a tax 
cut, and families earning $100,000–$200,000 are 
more than ten times more likely to have a 
tax hike than a tax cut. 
The bill does nothing—or makes things 
worse—for regular working families. More 
than 92 percent of households with incomes 
under $200,000 get no benefit—or a tax hike— 
under Democrats’ bill. 
What’s more, these tax hikes on working 
families do not include the bill’s superfund 
or methane taxes on American energy, which 
disproportionately harm middle- and lower- 
income households through higher prices at 
the pump and bigger utility bills.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H7664 
August 12, 2022 
HIGH-INCOME HOUSEHOLDS ENJOY BIG BENEFITS 
The JCT analysis shows the landscaping 
company owner and his workers pay more, 
while the wealthy homeowner gets checks 
from Washington for the solar panels on 
their roof. That’s because the ‘‘winners’’ 
under Democrat’s tax plan are the earners at 
the very top. Democrat’s reckless spending 
plan includes more than $250 billion in Green 
New Deal subsidies that benefit the wealthy 
the most. 
The percentage of $1 million-plus house-
holds getting a tax cut (19.4 percent) is twice 
as high as any other income group. 
The group with the next highest proportion 
of tax cuts is those earning $500,000–$1 mil-
lion. 
Over the long term, 72.5 percent of house-
holds with income over $1 million will re-
ceive a tax cut. 
MORE BAD NEWS: $10.6 BILLION IN TAX HIKES ON 
WORKING FAMILIES NEXT YEAR 
Separate analysis by JCT isolates the ef-
fects of Democrats’ tax plan without the 
Obamacare subsidies that flow to a limited 
number of households in an attempt to bribe 
them into one-size-fits-all Obamacare plans. 
In 2023, Democrats would increase the total 
tax burden on Americans under $200,000 in in-
come by $10.6 billion. 
Mr. BRADY. Madam Speaker, I yield 
1 minute to the gentleman from Ten-
nessee (Mr. KUSTOFF). 
Mr. KUSTOFF. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the ranking member for yield-
ing. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today in 
strong opposition to what the Demo-
crats call the Inflation Reduction Act 
which is really the inflation expansion 
act. 
Americans are grappling with an 
economy in recession and the highest 
inflation that we have seen in 40 years. 
We are experiencing worker shortages, 
empty grocery shelves, and higher en-
ergy prices. Now Congressional Demo-
crats are doubling down on this out-of- 
control spending that led to this eco-
nomic crisis. 
This package that we are voting on 
today will raise taxes on hardworking, 
middle-class families. It will authorize 
87,000 new IRS agents to target individ-
uals and small businesses. It will re-
duce lifesaving healthcare innovation 
by allowing the government to impose 
price controls on drugs. It will hurt en-
ergy producers. And it will certainly 
worsen inflation. 
I am voting against this fundamen-
tally flawed and defective package be-
cause families, farmers, and small busi-
nesses 
across 
west 
Tennessee 
and 
across the Nation need real solutions 
to these problems, not more taxes and 
not more government spending. 
Mr. NEAL. Madam Speaker, the bill 
we are considering in the House today, 
the Inflation Reduction Act, started in 
the House of Representatives as the 
Build Back Better Act. 
Three years ago, all Democratic Members 
of the Ways and Means Committee introduced 
the GREEN Act as the Committee’s con-
sensus legislation for tax priorities relating to 
climate, clean energy, and energy efficiency. 
The GREEN Act was reintroduced, again with 
all Ways and Means Democrats, in the 117th 
Congress. 
The GREEN Act formed the base of the cli-
mate and energy subtitle of the Build Back 
Better Act, which the Ways and Means Com-
mittee marked up in September 2021 and 
passed out of the House, following significant 
input from the Senate, in November 2021. 
Many provisions of Subtitle D of the Inflation 
Reduction Act remain substantially similar to 
those that the House developed and passed. 
As the Chairman of the Ways and Means 
Committee, I wish to offer additional detail on 
the legislative intent behind certain provisions 
included in this legislation. 
This legislation provides long-term exten-
sions of tax credits for renewable technologies 
such as solar, wind, geothermal, and hydro-
power by extending section 45 and section 48 
and enacting their successor credits under 
sec. 45Y and section 48E. These provisions 
were drafted with the goal of unleashing clean 
energy deployment, in line with President 
Biden’s pledge of a 50–52 percent reduction 
from 2005 levels in economy-wide net green-
house gas pollution in 2030. Additionally, this 
legislation provides enhanced credit amounts 
for projects additional goals, such as those 
meeting domestic content requirements or lo-
cated in energy communities. 
Currently, these renewable energy tax cred-
its often remain out of reach for low-income 
communities, which disproportionately bear 
the burden of pollution. The Committee be-
lieves that our renewable energy deployment 
should align with President Biden’s Justice40 
initiative, which aims to deliver 40 percent of 
the overall benefits of federal investments in 
climate and clean energy to disadvantaged 
communities. To achieve these goals, we 
must bring all resources to bear across all 
agencies—the Department of the Treasury, 
the Department of Energy, the Environmental 
Protection Agency, the White House Council 
on Environmental Quality, and more. For ex-
ample, the Council on Environmental Quality 
has developed a tool to assist federal agen-
cies with best targeting resources towards dis-
advantaged communities. 
This goal is closely aligned with a provision 
that I am proud to have worked with Rep. 
DANNY DAVIS to include in this legislation. H.R. 
5183, provides an enhanced investment tax 
credit for projects in connection with low-in-
come communities, and is included in new 
section 45(e) and section 48E(h) in this legis-
lation. It draws on the success in California of 
a clean energy program that helps hundreds 
of thousands of low-income residents in multi-
family housing enjoy the cost savings and en-
vironmental advantages of solar. 
This program provides allocated bonus 
credits for projects benefiting low-income resi-
dents, including multifamily housing, commu-
nity solar, and individual low-income residen-
tial homeowners. The Committee intends that 
the program prioritize low-income individuals 
and communities throughout the selection 
process. Low-income individuals can benefit 
from this legislation in multiple ways, including 
in the form of lower electricity bills, reduction 
in locally harmful air pollution, inclusive eco-
nomic opportunities through training and em-
ployment on such projects, and benefits to the 
community proven through active engagement 
and outreach to community members. Thus, in 
selecting projects for allocation, the Committee 
intends for the Secretary to take into account 
which projects demonstrate the greatest health 
and economic benefits for disadvantaged indi-
viduals (including benefits related to the ability 
to withstand extreme weather events); the 
greatest employment and wages for such indi-
viduals; and the greatest engagement with 
and outreach to such individuals, including 
through partnerships with local governments, 
community-based organizations, and Indian 
tribal governments. 
Additionally, this legislation is designed to 
provide maximum flexibility to the Secretary in 
designing an efficient application and alloca-
tion process to meet the needs of low-income 
residents. Specifically, the legislation is in-
tended to allow residential rooftop providers to 
identify potential customers in qualifying cen-
sus tracts and submit applications to serve 
these customers up-front, before these busi-
nesses have contractually engaged these cus-
tomers. My understanding is that these busi-
nesses will need to know if they have received 
a credit allocation before they can offer the 
benefits of the credit to these customers so 
that businesses can provide customers accu-
rate pricing information and cost savings to 
low-income customers. 
This legislation also makes several impor-
tant additions to the property eligible under the 
section 48 investment tax credit and its suc-
cessor credit, section 48E. 
The first is the addition of energy storage 
technologies. This provision originated as H.R. 
1684, the Energy Storage Tax Incentive and 
Deployment, as advanced by Representatives 
MIKE DOYLE and EARL BLUMENAUER, and in-
cluded in the GREEN Act and the Build Back 
Better Act. It is the Committee’s intent that the 
technologies included in H.R. 1684, such as 
pumped hydropower, are considered energy 
storage technologies for this legislation. 
Pumped-storage hydroelectric facilities are 
sometimes called water batteries. Electricity is 
used to pump water from a lower to an upper 
reservoir. When needed, this water is then re-
leased and run through turbines to convert the 
stored energy back into electricity. 
The definition of energy storage tech-
nologies includes ‘‘property . . . which re-
ceives, stores, and delivers energy for conver-
sion 
to 
electricity’’ 
under 
new 
section 
48(c)(6)(A)(i). Thus, it is the Committee’s in-
tent such property not only include the two 
reservoirs as well as the pipe and pump to 
move the water uphill, but also the turbines 
and step-up transformer to convert the stored 
energy back into electricity. 
Additionally, relating to the coordination of 
the credit for energy storage technologies and 
the section 45 production tax credit, the Com-
mittee intends that a credit is allowed for en-
ergy storage technology under section 48 re-
gardless of whether it is part of a facility for 
which a credit under section 45 is or has been 
allowed. 
The 
second 
is 
the 
addition 
of 
electrochromatic glass, also known as dy-
namic glass, to section 48(a)(3)(A)(ii). It is the 
Committee’s intent that the basis for such 
property should include the cost of the glass 
itself including the devices, the wiring and 
other components necessary for the glass to 
change its light transmittance properties, as 
well as the window frame and the capitalized 
costs for the installation of these and any 
other related components. 
Additionally, this legislation creates new 
section 45W, the credit for qualified commer-
cial clean vehicles, to incentivize clean vehi-
cles and mobile machinery. In including mobile

machinery, 
the 
Committee 
intends 
to 
incentivize cleaner farm equipment, construc-
tion equipment, and other equipment. As the 
Secretary develops regulations or other guid-
ance to carry out the purposes of this section, 
the Committee believes it is appropriate to 
consider industry standards when applying 
rules in the section that reference vehicles. 
For example, the Secretary may look estab-
lished methods of determining equipment 
weight for purposes of determining credit limits 
based upon gross vehicle weights and may 
allow, as a substitute, other commonly used 
identification or serial numbers when admin-
istering the vehicle identification number re-
quIrements. 
This legislation is historic, and I look forward 
to seeing the impact these, and the many 
other clean energy incentives contained in this 
bill, have on our carbon reduction goals in the 
coming years. 
Mr. NEAL. Madam Speaker, I yield 
11⁄2 minutes to the gentleman from New 
Jersey (Mr. PASCRELL), who is always 
pleased to let us know what he is 
thinking. 
Mr. PASCRELL. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the chairman for yielding. 
Madam Speaker, the American peo-
ple put Democrats in charge to raise 
our Nation from its knees—unless we 
have short memories. 
We are putting people over powerful 
interests. We are rebuilding our econ-
omy for working families. We are pro-
viding historically low healthcare pre-
miums for nearly 12 million Ameri-
cans, including over 20,000 in my own 
district of New Jersey. 
We are making the single largest in-
vestment in clean energy to secure a 
livable future. Our planet is at the 
precipice of catastrophe. So we are 
combating climate change and creating 
9 million jobs in the process. 
Not bad, Madam Speaker, not bad. 
Our bill includes legislation I happen 
to champion to expand zero-emission 
nuclear energy and offshore wind, 
where New Jersey leads the way. I 
worked on a bipartisan basis on those 
two issues, and there is nothing said 
today about that by my friends on the 
other side. 
For years, Republicans sabotaged the 
IRS. The record is clear. They safe-
guarded loopholes to help a privileged 
few pay a pittance in taxes. And that 
ends today. 
Five years ago, Republicans passed a 
$2 trillion tax scam for the rich and the 
corporate tycoons. Today, we are clos-
ing the tax gap and providing tax fair-
ness. 
Democrats are making prescription 
drugs affordable. 
Democrats are lowering healthcare 
costs. 
God bless our great country. 
Mr. BRADY. Madam Speaker, I in-
clude in the RECORD a letter from the 
Congressional Budget Office, which 
confirms this bill will actually increase 
the cost of new drugs. 
U.S. CONGRESS, 
CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET OFFICE, 
Washington, DC, August 4, 2022. 
Re Additional Information About Prescrip-
tion Drug Legislation 
Hon. JASON SMITH, 
Ranking Member, Committee on the Budget, 
U.S. House of Representatives, Washington, DC. 
DEAR CONGRESSMAN: This letter provides 
additional information that you and your 
colleagues requested about subtitle I of the 
reconciliation recommendations of the Sen-
ate Committee on Finance regarding pre-
scription drug legislation. You asked about 
how provisions involving inflation rebates 
and the negotiation of drug prices would af-
fect launch prices for new drugs and the in-
troduction of new generic drugs. You also 
asked how a provision to stabilize premiums 
as a part of the redesign of Medicare’s bene-
fits would affect the federal budget and pre-
miums. 
EFFECT OF THE INFLATION-REBATE AND 
NEGOTIATION PROVISIONS ON LAUNCH PRICES 
The Congressional Budget Office projects 
that the inflation-rebate and negotiation 
provisions would increase the launch prices 
for drugs that are not yet on the market rel-
ative to what such prices would be other-
wise. That effect would primarily be driven 
by the inflation-rebate provisions (sections 
129101 and 129102), which would begin to 
apply to prices within 12 months of a given 
drug’s entering the market. Under those pro-
visions, manufacturers would have an incen-
tive to launch new drugs at a higher price to 
offset slower growth in prices over time. The 
negotiation provision (section 129001) would 
have less of an impact on launch prices, CBO 
expects: Although the ceiling for a drug’s ne-
gotiated price is based on its price from a 
prior year, negotiation could not occur until 
drugs were on the market for a number of 
years—at least 7 for small-molecule drugs 
and 11 for biologics. 
Higher launch prices would primarily af-
fect spending for drugs in the Medicaid pro-
gram, CBO projects, because an increase in 
that program’s basic rebate brought about 
by the higher launch prices would only part-
ly offset those prices. Higher launch prices 
would also tend to affect spending for drugs 
covered by Part B of the Medicare program 
because that program’s payments for those 
drugs are based on the average sales prices. 
Over time, slower price growth would at-
tenuate the effect of higher launch prices. 
In the commercial and Medicare Part D 
segments of the market, spending would be 
less affected by higher launch prices, CBO es-
timates, because manufacturers would have 
more flexibility to manage rebates to maxi-
mize their revenues in those sectors. 
EFFECT OF THE NEGOTIATION PROVISION ON THE 
INTRODUCTION OF NEW GENERIC DRUGS 
CBO has not analyzed the effects of the ne-
gotiation provision on the introduction of 
new generic drugs. In projecting the effects 
of the negotiation provision, CBO estimated 
the share of spending that would be subject 
to negotiation each year and the average re-
duction in prices that would stem from the 
negotiations. But the agency did not analyze 
how the provision would affect prices or 
spending on specific drugs, nor did it quan-
tify any impact on the introduction of new 
generic drugs. 
EFFECTS OF THE PREMIUM-STABILIZATION 
PROVISION 
Under the premium-stabilization provision 
(section 129201), the federal government 
would subsidize any growth in beneficiaries’ 
base premiums for Medicare Part D exceed-
ing 6 percent from one year to the next over 
the 2024–2029 period. The provision subse-
quently would lower the base premium per-
centage (the percentage of the average cost 
of standard Part D coverage that is used to 
calculate beneficiaries’ premiums) to ensure 
that premiums did not grow by more than 6 
percent between 2029 and 2030. That subsidy 
and subsequent reduction in premiums would 
increase federal spending by roughly $40 bil-
lion over the 2024–2031 period, CBO estimates. 
Beneficiaries’ spending on premiums would 
be lower under the premium-stabilization 
provision than it would be without it. 
That estimate is an average effect among 
the possible paths of premiums that CBO 
considered when modeling the uncertainty of 
future outcomes. Under some of those paths, 
premiums would grow by less than 6 percent 
a year, and the provision would have no cost; 
under others, premiums would grow faster, 
and the provision would generate costs. 
I hope this information is useful to you 
and your colleagues. Please contact me if 
you have further questions. 
Sincerely, 
PHILLIP L. SWAGEL, 
Director. 
Mr. BRADY. Madam Speaker, I yield 
1 minute to the gentleman from Ari-
zona (Mr. SCHWEIKERT), my colleague 
on the Committee on Ways and Means. 
Mr. SCHWEIKERT. Madam Speaker, 
for everyone here, this is a subsidy bill. 
And this is the classic difference be-
tween the left and the right. They are 
functionally subsidizing. We on the 
right actually want to change the mar-
ket. We want competition. 
So I am going to pull out one very 
simple example. In here, we have $2.5 
billion of subsidies for our ports to get 
greener and more efficient. But then 
the Democrats slip in language that 
says human-operated, meaning you are 
not going to take on the unions, you 
are not actually going to make it more 
efficient, you are not going to actually 
embrace disruption and technology. 
We keep coming to the floor and 
talking about things that would make 
our ports greener, faster, more effi-
cient, feed the supply chain—these 
electric rail cars, except you function-
ally just made them not happen. 
This is a subsidy for those unions, 
those folks who right checks to the 
left. You claim you are making the en-
vironment better and cleaner, but then 
you build the very barriers in the lan-
guage that stop those good things from 
happening. 
Mr. NEAL. Madam Speaker, I yield 
11⁄2 minutes to the gentleman from Illi-
nois (Mr. DANNY K. DAVIS), one of the 
most talented members of the com-
mittee. 
Mr. DANNY K. DAVIS of Illinois. 
Madam Speaker, I associate myself 
with the remarks made by my col-
leagues relative to our tragic loss of 
Representative Walorski who was the 
ranking member of the subcommittee 
that I chair. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in strong sup-
port of the Inflation Reduction Act of 
2022. This is the most transformative 
piece of legislation that I have seen. It 
lowers family healthcare costs, reduces 
drug and energy costs, makes the larg-
est investment in addressing climate 
change in the history of this country, 
and cuts carbon emissions by 40 per-
cent.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H7666 
August 12, 2022 
This bill would create millions of 
good-paying, union jobs and stimulate 
economic 
growth 
and 
development 
across the Nation. It incentivizes man-
ufacturing and reduces our reliance 
upon foreign-made products. 
This bill does what we have been try-
ing to do for years, and that is, it em-
powers Medicare to negotiate the price 
of prescription drugs. Millions of sen-
iors and disabled individuals will ben-
efit from this provision alone, not to 
mention what the monthly cap on the 
price of insulin would do for millions of 
others. 
Madam Speaker, this bill would cut 
the deficit and lower inflation, will not 
cost the average taxpayer one addi-
tional cent, unless they earn $400,000 
annually or more. One feature of this 
bill that I am especially proud of is the 
enhanced tax credit to bring solar and 
wind energy to low-income commu-
nities. This tax credit will assist these 
communities. 
Madam Speaker, this is a great bill, 
and I urge its passage. 
Mr. BRADY. Madam Speaker, I in-
clude in the RECORD a Congressional 
Budget Office report from this morn-
ing, while we were on the House floor, 
which confirms IRS audits will gen-
erate tens of billions of dollars for mid-
dle-class families making less than 
$400,000. 
CBO has received a number of questions re-
garding our estimate of an amendment of-
fered by Senator Crapo during the floor de-
bate on H.R. 5376 last weekend. That amend-
ment, #5404, would limit the use of addi-
tional funds for the Internal Revenue Serv-
ice. If the amendment had been adopted none 
of the additional funds could have been used 
to audit taxpayers with taxable incomes 
below $400,000. 
CBO did not complete a formal cost esti-
mate in advance of consideration of the 
amendment but the agency did provide the 
following information to the Senate Budget 
Committee: 
CBO estimates that the amendment 5404 
would have the following effects: 
No effect on outlays in the one or ten year 
budget windows; would reduce outlays in the 
five year budget window. 
No effect on revenues in the one year budg-
et window; would reduce the ‘‘non-scorable’’ 
revenues resulting from the provisions of 
section 10301 in the five and ten year budget 
windows. 
No effect on outlays after 2031 but would 
decrease the ‘‘non-scorable’’ revenue result-
ing from the provisions of section 10301 after 
2031. 
CBO has not completed a point estimate of 
this amendment but the preliminary assess-
ment indicates that amendment 5404 would 
reduce the ‘‘non-scorable’’ revenues resulting 
from the provisions of section 10301 by at 
least $20 billion over the FY2022–FY2031 pe-
riod. 
Thanks, 
LEIGH ANGRES, 
Director of Legislative Affairs, 
Congressional Budget Office. 
Mr. BRADY. Madam Speaker, I yield 
1 minute to the gentleman from Penn-
sylvania (Mr. KELLY), my colleague 
from the Committee on Ways and 
Means. 
b 1345 
Mr. KELLY of Pennsylvania. Madam 
Speaker, I thank my friend from Texas, 
and I hate to see him leave because he 
has been so productive. 
Madam Speaker, it is interesting. We 
had the talk and hear it going back and 
forth about what the IRS is not going 
to do. I would just tell my fellow citi-
zens—and I am not going to talk to the 
other side because we shouldn’t be 
doing that anyway. 
There is something wrong whenever 
we look at the money that is being 
spent to hire agents for enforcement. I 
would tell my fellow citizens: Be 
afraid. Be very afraid. If the events of 
this week don’t shake you to the bot-
tom as to what this government can do 
to you whenever it chooses to do it and 
however it chooses to do it, understand 
that this agency, the IRS, is the most 
feared agency in the United States 
Government. It is incredible the power 
that it wields. 
It is incredible that it is going to in-
crease the number of enforcement offi-
cers. They are not coming in to help 
with the processing because all of us in 
Congress, including my friends on the 
other side, have been doing the work of 
the IRS for the IRS. They haven’t been 
back to work full time for 21⁄2 years. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my friends on 
both sides of the aisle to vote ‘‘no’’ on 
this monstrosity that does not do any-
thing about inflation but continues to 
harass 
hardworking 
American 
tax-
payers. 
Mr. NEAL. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Madam Speaker, this is misinforma-
tion about the IRS. They need the 
funding to better serve the American 
people. The idea that, all of a sudden, 
there is an army of IRS agents that is 
coming after the American family 
doesn’t stand up under the magnifying 
glass of critical analysis. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 11⁄2 minutes 
to the gentleman from New York (Mr. 
HIGGINS), a really capable member of 
the Ways and Means Committee. 
Mr. HIGGINS of New York. Madam 
Speaker, the 1970 Clean Air Act was 
passed by a Democratic-led Congress 
and a Republican President after mil-
lions of Americans demanded change. 
Five decades later, a new generation of 
Americans is calling on Congress to act 
on our Nation’s biggest challenges. The 
Inflation Reduction Act is not just a 
good climate bill; it is also a major 
achievement. 
To address the climate crisis, it 
makes a $369 billion investment toward 
decarbonizing our Nation. The bill ad-
dresses environmental justice. Every-
one should benefit from a cleaner envi-
ronment, especially those who are vul-
nerable to disease because of where 
they live. 
The bill finally helps Medicare nego-
tiate a better deal on drug prices. This 
provision will save lives and help sen-
iors enjoy their retirement without 
fear of poverty due to the cost of their 
medications. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to support this legislation, 
which is vital to our Nation’s future. 
Mr. BRADY. Madam Speaker, I in-
clude in the RECORD the following re-
port from 2020 from a group that tracks 
government spending, which details 
how the IRS is currently armed with 
4,600 guns and 5 million rounds of am-
munition. That is not fear-mongering; 
these are the facts. 
IRS HAS 4,600 GUNS AND FIVE MILION ROUNDS 
OF AMMO: WILL DEM BILL GROW ARSENAL? 
The IRS has 4,600 guns and five million 
rounds of ammunition according to a report 
from OpenTheBooks published in 2020. With 
Democrats on the verge of passing $80 billion 
in additional funding to facilitate the hiring 
of 87,000 new agents, how much will this arse-
nal grow? 
The Democrats’ push to increase the size 
and power of the IRS has significant crimi-
nal justice and basic due process ramifica-
tions. 
An OpenTheBooks report titled The Mili-
tarization of U.S. Executive Agencies shows 
that, even without the proposed $80 billion 
increase in funding, the IRS Criminal Inves-
tigation Division (IRS-CI) is already heavily 
armed at the expense of the American tax-
payer. 
The current 4,600-gun stockpile includes: 
3,282 pistols 
621 shotguns 
539 rifles 
15 fully automatic firearms 
4 revolvers 
According to the Government Account-
ability Office the ammunition breakdown is 
as follows: 
Pistol and revolver rounds: 3,151,500 
Rifle rounds: 1,472,050 
Shotgun rounds: 367,750 
Fully automatic firearm rounds: 56,000 
When OpenTheBooks directly asked the 
IRS for an accounting of its gun locker, the 
agency responded, ‘‘We don’t have one [an in-
ventory], but could create one for you, if im-
portant.’’ 
There are seven reasons to be concerned 
about the IRS having more power, more 
money, and more guns: 
1. IRS FAILS TO ENSURE ARMED AGENTS RECEIVE 
REQUIRED FIREARMS TRAINING 
In order to carry or use an IRS-owned 
weapon, agents must: engage in handgun fir-
ing training at least once each quarter, 
shoot at least the minimum of 75 percentage 
points on the firearms qualifying test using 
the issued handgun during two nonconsecu-
tive quarters, participate in biannual fire-
arms building entry exercises, participate in 
an annual briefing on firearms safety and se-
curity policies and IRS-CI’s directives and 
procedures regarding the safe handling and 
storage of firearms, and participate in a 
briefing each quarter regarding the policy of 
discharging a firearm at a moving vehicle. 
IRS-CI’s National Criminal Investigation 
Training Academy (NCITA) is responsible for 
implementing the formalized firearms train-
ing and qualification program nationwide. 
This includes developing the firearm quali-
fication requirements they are expected to 
meet and the training special agents will un-
dergo. Despite these requirements, CI agents 
have regularly failed to stay up to date on 
training or report incidents, endangering the 
taxpayers they are supposed to protect. 
According to reports from the Treasury In-
spector General for Tax Administration 
(TIGTA), the IRS has repeatedly failed to en-
sure that procedures relating to firearms are 
properly followed: 
‘‘there is no national-level review of fire-
arms training records to ensure that all spe-
cial agents meet the qualification require-
ments.’’ 
Special agents are required to surrender 
their weapons when they fail to participate

in this training, however this often does not 
happen. 
As noted by the Inspector General: 
‘‘However, there is currently little con-
sequence for special agents who fail to meet 
the training requirements listed on the 
checklist.’’ 
The Inspector General noted the IRS failed 
to secure the firearms of those who did not 
meet their requirements: 
‘‘controls did not ensure that CI personnel 
properly 
secured 
firearms 
when 
special 
agents failed to meet the biannual standard 
qualification requirement. CI was only able 
to provide evidence that firearms were sur-
rendered in nine of the 27 instances when 
special agents did not qualify. The Criminal 
Investigation Management Information Sys-
tem was only updated to reflect the custody 
change in four of those nine instances. 
The Inspector General noted that the IRS 
lapses torpedo its ability to effectively try 
cases: 
‘‘Court decisions in the past have held law 
enforcement entities liable because their law 
enforcement agents did not have training 
that reflected the environment that they 
would likely encounter, such as training in-
volving moving targets and low-light condi-
tions. Other court decisions underscored the 
importance of properly documenting fire-
arms training. One decision dismissed the 
claims against a law enforcement entity that 
maintained thorough records that showed 
the law enforcement personnel had been 
trained. Another decision upheld a jury’s 
conclusion that undocumented police train-
ing did not constitute adequate training.’’ 
The IRS failure to conduct proper internal 
oversight of its weapons could have grave 
consequences for the public. As noted by the 
Inspector General: 
‘‘If there is insufficient oversight, special 
agents in possession of firearms who are not 
properly trained and qualified could endan-
ger other special agents and the public.’’ 
2. IRS AGENTS ACCIDENTALLY FIRE THEIR WEAP-
ONS MORE OFTEN THAN THEY INTENTIONALLY 
FIRE THEM 
A TIGTA report found that special agents 
at the IRS Criminal Investigation Division 
(IRS-CI) accidentally fired their weapons 
more often than they intentionally fired 
them: 
‘‘According to documentation provided by 
all 26 CI field offices, the NCITA, and the 
TIGTA OI, there were a total of eight fire-
arm discharges classified as intentional use 
of force incidents and 11 discharges classified 
as accidental during FYs 2009 through 2011.’’ 
3. IRS CONCEALS DETAILS OF ACCIDENTAL GUN 
DISCHARGES 
The agency’s lackadaisical approach to 
firearm safety has led to easily preventable 
accidents. The Inspector General cryptically 
references IRS accidental discharges that 
caused ‘‘property damage or personal in-
jury’’: 
‘‘In three of the four accidental discharges 
that were not reported, the accidental dis-
charges may have resulted in property dam-
age or personal injury.’’ 
The details of these incidents are—for 
some reason—redacted in the report: 
IRS–CI management is required to be noti-
fied when a special agent discharges their 
weapon. CI must report all accidental dis-
charge incidents externally to the TIGTA OI 
and internally to the NCITA and the Direc-
tor of Field Operations. Despite these direc-
tives, CI did not always properly disclose ac-
cidental discharges: 
‘‘we found that four accidental discharges 
were not properly reported. This included 
two that were not reported to both to the 
TIGTA OI and the NCITA. one that was not 
reported to the TIGTA OI, and one that was 
not reported internally to the NCITA.’’ 
4. IRS AGENTS DO NOT ALWAYS UNDERGO REME-
DIAL
TRAINING
AFTER
DISCHARGES
DUE
TO 
AGENT NEGLIGENCE 
Compounding their mistakes, agents did 
not always provide remedial training when 
an accidental discharge occurred. Even when 
they did undergo training, the standards re-
mained wildly inconsistent. The Inspector 
General found that: 
‘‘two of the four use of force coordinators 
stated that they may require the special 
agent to participate in some type of reme-
dial training, one stated that the special 
agent would be counseled, and one stated 
that there would be no additional training 
required.’’ 
5. IRS HAS A HISTORY OF VIOLATING BASIC DUE 
PROCESS RIGHTS 
In a 2017 report, the IRS–CI was shown to 
have regularly violated taxpayers’ rights and 
skirted or ignored due process requirements 
when investigating taxpayers for allegedly 
violating the existing $10,000 currency trans-
action reporting requirements 
TIGTA found that only 8 percent of inves-
tigations uncovered violations of tax law. In 
many cases, IRS–CI had not considered rea-
sonable 
explanations 
from 
those 
inves-
tigated, property owners were not ade-
quately informed of their rights nor in-
formed of seizure of their property, and out-
comes in cases lacked consistency, violating 
the Eighth Amendment to the Constitution. 
6. IRS HAS APPALLING EVIDENCE STORAGE 
HABITS 
The IRS Criminal Investigation Division 
(IRS–CI) was repeatedly found to leave crit-
ical evidence sitting around in break rooms, 
hallways and stacked outside cubicles, ac-
cording to a report by the Treasury Inspec-
tor General for Tax Administration (TIGTA). 
In addition, the report found that CI offices 
did not maintain an Evidence Access Control 
Log to record access to areas where evidence 
is stored: 
During our walkthroughs at the CI offices, 
we observed that some sites had evidence 
placed in hallways. stacked outside cubicles, 
and in break rooms. In addition, seven of the 
nine offices did not keep grand jury material 
in a separate, secure area. The grand jury 
material was intermingled with non-grand 
jury evidence and other case file informa-
tion. 
The agency’s careless approach to evidence 
storage has grave ramifications, as noted by 
the Inspector General: 
In order for a seized item to be admissible 
as evidence, it is necessary to prove that the 
item is in the same condition as when it was 
seized. If evidence is not stored properly, evi-
dence may have been inappropriately dis-
closed, lost, tampered with, or stolen. In ad-
dition, the chain of custody could be called 
into question, which could result in the item 
being deemed inadmissible in court. 
The report suggests the IRS is an outlier in 
terms of its sloppy handling of evidence, 
compared to other federal law enforcement 
agencies: 
In addition, we interviewed representatives 
from two other Federal law enforcement 
agencies to gain an understanding of how 
they maintained their chain of custody. It 
was apparent from these interviews that 
both Federal agencies have an extensive 
chain of custody process. For example, each 
agency limits access to the locked evidence 
room, which is maintained by an evidence 
custodian. If evidence needs to be removed 
from the room, an agent must gain access 
through the evidence custodian and a record 
of that access is maintained. This process 
helps ensure that evidence does not become 
lost or misplaced and helps keep the chain of 
custody from being broken. 
Each IRS–CI special agent has the author-
ity to investigate, inquire, and receive infor-
mation. Of the investigative techniques 
available to agents, one of the most fre-
quently used is the authority to conduct 
searches and issue search and seizure war-
rants. 
The Federal Government is responsible for 
properly maintaining the chain of custody 
for any seized items. CI agents must be able 
to prove it is the same item that was seized 
and that the item is in the same condition as 
when it was seized in order for that seized 
item to be admissible as evidence. 
Grand jury-related evidence must be kept 
separate from other non-grand jury evidence. 
Despite these clear directives, the CI has 
routinely ignored protocol, violating the 
rights of the taxpayers they are supposed to 
protect. 
7. IRS HAS CONDUCTED MANY ARMED RAIDS ON 
INNOCENT AMERICANS 
In the late 1990s, the IRS came under scru-
tiny for the harsh tactics it used to enforce 
the tax code. With tens of billion in new 
funding, it is not hard to see how these 
abuses could return. 
A 1998 article by Washington Post noted 
many small business owners were harassed 
by the IRS, only for the agency to find no 
evidence of wrongdoing. 
‘‘An Oklahoma tax-return preparer, a 
Texas oilman and a Virginia restaurateur 
told lawmakers how raiding parties of armed 
agents from the IRS Criminal Investigation 
Division barged into their homes or offices, 
frightened their employees and families—and 
ultimately came up empty-handed.’’ 
‘‘Two of the men said they later found that 
former employees had precipitated the raids, 
and that the IRS had done little or no check-
ing on their informants’ credibility. The 
third witness said he never could determine 
why he was targeted.’’ 
One man described over a dozen armed IRS 
officials raiding his offices, seizing business 
documents, and harassing clients and em-
ployees: 
‘‘Richard Gardner, whose company pre-
pares 4,500 to 6,000 tax returns each year, 
said that one morning in 1995, he was called 
out of a meeting. He found 15 IRS agents and 
a half-dozen U.S. marshals in his lobby, ‘‘all 
armed and wearing those jackets that say in 
bright letters IRS’ or U.S. Marshal’ on the 
back.’’ 
‘‘They seized his client records, computers, 
personal papers and other files, he said, and 
held them for two years while the IRS inves-
tigation continued. Gardner was able to buy 
new computers and continue in business, but 
the damage to his business was extensive. He 
said IRS agents went to clients and de-
manded they wear hidden microphones when 
meeting with Gardner; they hauled his wife 
before a grand jury; and his employees were 
told they would be able to buy his business 
cheaply because he would be out of business 
soon.’’ 
These were not isolated cases. A 1998 arti-
cle by the New York Times described ‘‘mili-
tary style raids’’ by IRS agents against tax-
payers who were accused of nonviolent be-
havior 
The Senate Finance Committee held a se-
ries of IRS oversight hearings in 1998. Among 
many witnesses to abuses carried out by 
armed IRS agents, a Virginia restaurant 
owner testified the following on April 29, 
1998: 
‘‘Armed agents, accompanied by drug-sniff-
ing dogs, stormed my restaurants during 
breakfast, ordered patrons out of the res-
taurant, and began interrogating my em-
ployees. 
The IRS impounded my records, my cash 
registers, and my computers.’’

‘‘When the raid occurred at my home, the 
front door was torn from the hinges, my dogs 
were impounded, along with my safe and 12 
years of my personal income tax returns and 
supporting documents.’’ 
Giving more money, power and guns to an 
agency with a terrible firearms safety record 
and a terrible due process record is alarming 
to law-abiding Americans. 
Mr. BRADY. Madam Speaker, I yield 
1 minute to the gentleman from Penn-
sylvania (Mr. SMUCKER). 
Mr. 
SMUCKER. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
there are so many things wrong with 
the policies in this bill. It will cer-
tainly punish Americans’ pocketbooks 
through 
record-high 
inflation, 
new 
taxes, and an army of IRS agents. It 
can get even worse. 
This drug price setting regime in the 
bill, which I want to speak about brief-
ly, may very well put American lives 
at risk. The CBO agreed. Fewer drugs 
will be developed as a result of the 
policies in this bill. 
According to a study from the Uni-
versity of Chicago, government price 
controls in the bill will block 342 new 
cures from reaching market over the 
coming decades. That means that our 
constituents and family members who 
are battling diseases like cancer or 
Alzheimer’s may well be left with no 
hope of finding a cure. 
The university estimates that block-
ing these cures will collectively take 
330 million years off of Americans’ 
lives. That is 1 year per American, 
which, by the way, is a toll 31 times 
worse than the COVID–19 pandemic. 
American innovation and ingenuity 
got this country out of the COVID–19 
pandemic. This bill abandons free en-
terprise in favor of socialism and will 
cost the taxpayer too many dollars and 
cancer patients too many years. 
Mr. NEAL. Madam Speaker, a re-
minder that there are, I believe, almost 
600,425 Medicare beneficiaries who have 
diabetes in Pennsylvania. It is impor-
tant that the bill that we have caps in-
sulin costs. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 11⁄2 minutes 
to the gentlewoman from Alabama (Ms. 
SEWELL), a terrific member of the com-
mittee. 
Ms. SEWELL. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today in strong support of the Inflation 
Reduction Act. 
This 
transformational 
legislation 
will lower healthcare costs for millions 
of Americans and thousands of Ala-
bamians by extending ACA tax credits 
for an additional 3 years and reducing 
the prescription drug costs for our sen-
iors by allowing HHS, for the first 
time, to negotiate drug prices with 
pharmaceutical companies and capping 
out-of-pocket drug costs to $2,000 per 
year. This is a big deal for American 
families and especially the families 
that I represent in Alabama. 
This bill is also the single largest cli-
mate investment in America’s history. 
This bill includes my Carbon Capture 
and Sequestration Expansion Act that 
will extend the 45 credit eligibilities 
for carbon capture projects to 2023. 
When I think about all the great 
things that are in this particular bill, 
it is truly transformational for the 
people that I represent and for the 
American people. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to vote in favor of this bill. 
Let’s put people first over politics. 
Mr. BRADY. Madam Speaker, I in-
clude in the RECORD
the following 
Joint Committee on Taxation analysis 
that shows that American manufactur-
ers are hardest hit by the Democrats’ 
made in America tax—$200 billion—and 
they will pay over half of that tax. 
CONGRESS OF THE UNITED STATES, 
JOINT COMMITTEE ON TAXATION, 
Washington, DC, August 11, 2022. 
MEMORANDUM 
To: Redacted 
From: Thomas A. Barthold 
Subject: Revenue Estimate 
This memorandum is in response to your 
request for an estimate of how the burden of 
the corporate minimum financial statement 
income tax as contained in section 10101 of 
an amendment in the nature of a substitute 
to H.R. 5376. ‘‘An Act to Provide for Rec-
onciliation Pursuant to Title II of S. Con. 
Res. 14’’ as passed by the Senate on August 
7, 2022, would fall across different industrial 
sectors. 
Business income tax returns ask taxpayers 
to report the industry in which they are pri-
marily engaged, identifying the industry by 
the code numbers established under the 
North American Industrial Classification 
System (‘‘NAICS code’’). This is self-reported 
and the Internal Revenue Service does not 
verify the accuracy of the classification stat-
ed by the taxpayer. The NAICS code system 
allows data to be aggregated at different lev-
els of general categorization. Two-digit 
codes are the broadest categorization. For 
example, code 31 encompasses all manufac-
turing. As we project that only approxi-
mately 150 taxpayers annually will be sub-
ject to the proposed book minimum tax, in 
the accompanying table we generally report 
results by two-digit reporting to protect the 
privacy of the tax return data on which we 
base our analysis. 
We estimate the corporate minimum finan-
cial statement income tax as contained in 
the amendment in the nature of a substitute 
to H.R. 5376 as passed by the Senate would 
have the following effect on Federal fiscal 
year budget receipts.

Madam Speaker, I rise in opposition to 
this reckless bill today. I want to 
speak specifically to one issue, and 
that is medicine. 
As a practicing physician, I have seen 
miraculous 
curative 
advancements 
made in medicine over the last 15 
years. This partisan package will de-
stroy medical innovation and cripple 
independent private physicians. Up to 
342 new lifesaving drugs will be pre-
vented by this bill. 
We all agree that the cost of medi-
cine is way too high in this country, 
but instead of attacking the real 
causes, we are now going to be shifting 
Medicare dollars away from doctors, 
those who actually take care of pa-
tients, and give them to insurance 
companies and Green New Deal poli-
cies. 
Some physicians will see, on average, 
a 40 percent reduction in reimburse-
ment. Given the constant threats of 
Medicare cuts for physicians, who the 
hell would want to practice medicine 
or could afford to practice medicine in 
this country anymore? 
This scheme will have long-lasting 
negative impacts on patients, physi-
cians, and the solvency of Medicare, 
and it will set a dangerous precedent 
for future medicine to use Medicare as 
a piggy bank to subsidize unrelated 
policies. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to vote ‘‘no’’ on this bill.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H7669 
August 12, 2022 
Mr. NEAL. Madam Speaker, I yield 
11⁄2 minutes to the gentlewoman from 
Washington (Ms. DELBENE), who is well 
known for her work in the renewable 
energy field. 
Ms. DELBENE. Madam Speaker, Con-
gresswoman Jackie Walorski was a 
friend, and I send my deepest condo-
lences to her family and the families of 
Zackery Potts and Emma Thomson. 
Madam Speaker, the Inflation Reduc-
tion Act is nothing less than historic 
and shows our constituents that gov-
ernance can still work for them. 
The bill extends the Affordable Care 
Act insurance subsidies that have 
saved 13 million Americans an average 
of $800 a year on health coverage. 
It will enable the U.S. to cut green-
house gas emissions by 40 percent by 
2030 through investments like my clean 
hydrogen provision and make it more 
affordable for families to purchase en-
ergy and cost-saving products like 
electric vehicles and solar panels. 
These are provisions that the New 
Democrat Coalition and I have been 
calling for from the beginning. For our 
seniors, the bill will lower the costs of 
prescription drugs by allowing Medi-
care to negotiate lower prices and will 
cap out-of-pocket drug spending at 
$2,000 annually. These are tangible ben-
efits for Americans. 
The legislation is fully paid for by 
ensuring corporations pay their fair 
share and providing the IRS with the 
resources it needs after decades of Re-
publican-driven budget cuts. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to support this bill. I remind 
my colleagues that there are 533,775 
Medicare beneficiaries with diabetes in 
North Carolina, but the gentleman re-
mains against this bill capping insulin 
costs and Medicare at $35 per month. 
Mr. BRADY. Madam Speaker, I in-
clude in the RECORD the following let-
ter of opposition, which represents 
America’s independent natural gas and 
oil production industry, which says 
this bill will only exacerbate—make 
worse—our Nation’s energy crisis. 
August 11, 2022. 
Hon. NANCY PELOSI, 
Speaker, House of Representatives, 
Washington, DC. 
Hon. KEVIN MCCARTHY, 
Republican Leader, House of Representatives, 
Washington, DC. 
DEAR SPEAKER PELOSI AND LEADER MCCAR-
THY: The undersigned trade associations, rep-
resenting thousands of businesses across the 
United States that collectively employ mil-
lions of Americans, write to express our op-
position to the Inflation Reduction Act 
(IRA) as passed by the U.S. Senate. Further, 
we write to urge you to reconsider policies 
within the legislation before proceeding. 
The United States has experienced its sec-
ond consecutive quarter of negative GDP 
growth, and American consumers are facing 
record high inflation. We share the goal of 
addressing climate change, as evidenced in 
the policies we support and in the actions 
that we take every day. However, the consid-
erable tax increases and new government 
spending in the IRA amount to the wrong 
policies at the wrong time. 
We are also facing the most significant 
global energy crisis since the 1970’s, and U.S. 
energy security—and that of our strategic 
allies abroad—is being put to the test. Fur-
ther, U.S. energy costs have increased 40 per-
cent over the past twelve months, creating a 
serious strain on American household in-
comes. 
With these current conditions as the back-
drop for this legislation, there are several 
specific policies included in the IRA which 
are particularly troubling and deserve re- 
consideration. We would like to draw your 
attention to three such provisions: 
1. The IRA imposes a new corporate min-
imum tax, increasing taxes on Americans by 
more than $300 billion over the next 10 years. 
As President Obama noted in 2009, ‘‘the last 
thing you want to do is raise taxes in the 
middle of a recession.’’ 
2. The IRA imposes an $11.7 billion tax on 
crude oil and petroleum products. At a time 
of record-high energy prices, Congress should 
not add additional costs on American energy 
companies competing globally. 
3. The IRA imposes additional constraints 
on the ability of companies to develop and 
produce the energy that Americans need to 
fuel our economy and strengthen our energy 
security. This includes increased fees on do-
mestic production and the establishment of a 
new $6.3 billion natural gas tax. 
Finally, the IRA fails to address permit-
ting reform, which is desperately needed and 
is essential to effectively deliver affordable, 
reliable energy to consumers in a growing 
economy. 
To date, neither the House nor the Senate 
have introduced comprehensive permitting 
reform legislation. We urge Congress to 
quickly consider and pass permitting reform 
without delay. 
For the above-stated reasons, we express 
our opposition to the IRA and request that 
you reconsider passage of this legislation.

Mr. BRADY. Madam Speaker, I yield 
1 minute to the gentleman from Geor-
gia (Mr. CLYDE). 
Mr. CLYDE. Madam Speaker, one of 
the most egregious provisions in this 
socialist spending bill includes pro-
viding $80 billion to the IRS for hiring 
87,000 new agents to audit hardworking 
Americans. 
After my small business was wrong-
fully targeted by the IRS back in 2013, 
I know a thing or two about how bur-
densome and costly battles with the 
IRS can be. I will tell you, it is a gruel-
ing fight that most Americans simply 
cannot endure. 
This is precisely why I introduced an 
amendment to eliminate the IRS en-
forcement provision in this severely 
misguided legislation. The Democrats 
rejected it, confirming their intent to 
supercharge IRS audits in order to pay 
for their Big Government socialist 
agenda. 
This week has also proven just how 
corrupt our Federal agencies are and 
the length they are willing to go to 
persecute political opponents. 
Think about it: If the left will 
weaponize the FBI to raid President 
Trump’s personal residence, they will 
surely weaponize the IRS’ new 87,000 
agents, many of whom will be trained 
in the use of deadly force, to go after 
any American citizen. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to vote ‘‘no’’ on supersizing 
and weaponizing the IRS against the 
American people. 
Mr. NEAL. Madam Speaker, I yield 
11⁄2 minutes to the gentlewoman from 
California (Ms. CHU), whose work in the 
arena of renewable energy is well 
known. 
Ms. CHU. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today in strong support of the Inflation 
Reduction Act. 
This historic legislation will make 
real, tangible differences in the lives 
and livelihoods of people back home in 
southern California and across the Na-
tion. It is imperative we pass this once- 
in-a-generation bill today. 
The American people are struggling 
to afford medications, health insur-
ance, and their energy expenses, all 
while battling the impacts of climate 
change every day. They are desperate 
for Congress to take action to address 
the real challenges they are facing in 
their everyday lives. 
This is exactly what this bill does. It 
lowers the costs of prescription drugs 
for seniors to no more than $2,000 year-
ly. It curbs the rising costs of utilities

wide

It 
makes 
healthcare more affordable for millions 
of Americans by shoring up the Afford-
able Care Act. 
Today, we are going to combat cli-
mate change, ensure corporations pay 
their fair share, and reduce prices for 
workers and families. In fact, we are 
making the largest and most ambitious 
investment in clean and renewable en-
ergy in our Nation’s history, finally re-
versing years of underinvestment at 
the IRS and building a fairer tax sys-
tem that will invest in workers with-
out raising taxes on families and small 
businesses. 
Today, we are delivering on a prom-
ise made to Americans by passing this 
critical bill. We must commit to put-
ting 
people 
over 
politics. 
Madam 
Speaker, I urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote on this 
bill.

SENATE-PASSED
INFLATION

ACT: 
ESTIMATES
OF
BUDGETARY
AND
MACRO-
ECONOMIC EFFECTS 
KEY POINTS 
PWBM estimates that the Senate-Passed 
Inflation Reduction Act, as written, would 
reduce cumulative deficits by $264 billion 
over the 10–year budget window. 
The Act would have no meaningful effect 
on inflation in the near term but would re-
duce inflation by around 0.1 percentage 
points by the middle of the first decade. 
These point estimates, however, are not sta-
tistically different from zero, indicating a 
low level of confidence that the legislation 
would have any measurable impact on infla-
tion. 
Relative to current law, the Act would 
slightly reduce GDP in the first decade while 
slightly increasing GDP by 2050. These esti-
mates include the impact of debt reduction, 
carbon reduction, and tax incentives on in-
vestments and working hours. 
Most, but not all, of the tax increases fall 
on higher income households. However, fu-
ture generations, including higher-income 
households, gain from the improved econ-
omy, including a reduction in carbon emis-
sions. 
INTRODUCTION 
On Sunday August 7th, the U.S. Senate 
passed the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 
under FY2022 budget reconciliation instruc-
tions. PWBM recently analyzed a previous 
version of the bill. We also compared our 
analysis against that of the Joint Tax Com-
mittee and Congressional Budget Office who 
use an older economics baseline from July 
2021. 
In this brief, PWBM analyzes the budg-
etary, macroeconomic, and distributional ef-
fects of the final Senate passed version. In 
line with the previously released version of 
the bill, the Act provides for new spending 
and tax incentives related to the adoption of 
clean energy technology, both at the indus-
trial and consumer level. It extends a tem-
porary expansion of Affordable Care Act 
(ACA) health insurance subsidies for an addi-
tional two years. To offset these deficit-in-
creasing initiatives, the bill imposes new 
taxes on certain businesses, reduces govern-
ment outlays on prescription drugs through 
pricing reforms. It also provides for new IRS 
funding which PWBM estimates would in-
crease revenue collections above new out-
lays. 
PROVISION DESCRIPTIONS AND ESTIMATED 
BUDGETARY EFFECTS 
The final version of the Act makes several 
key amendments to the version we pre-
viously analyzed. First, the new corporate 
minimum tax no longer restricts the tax 
benefit of accelerated depreciation, and pri-
vate equity firms are exempted from the tax. 
Second, the carried interest provision was 
removed. Third, new revenue raising provi-
sions (a tax on stock buybacks and a restric-
tion on pass-through loss deductions) were 
added. Fourth, due to Senate rules, drug 
price inflation caps for private insurance 
plans were removed. 
More specifically, the Act proposes the fol-
lowing policy changes: 
Extension of expanded ACA subsidies. Ex-
tends the temporary expansion of Premium 
Tax Credits through 2025. The expansion, 
which offers eligibility to households above 
400 percent of the poverty line, is scheduled 
to expire at the end of 2022 under current 
law. 
Climate and energy provisions. Includes 
tax rebates and credits to lower energy costs 
for households; tax credits, research, loans, 
and grants to increase domestic manufac-
turing capacity for wind turbines, solar pan-
els, batteries, and other essential compo-
nents of clean energy production and stor-
age; tax credits to reduce carbon emissions; 
programs to reduce the environmental im-
pact of agriculture; a new fee on methane 
emissions; and more. 
Minimum tax on corporations’ book in-
come. Creates a new 15 percent corporate al-
ternative minimum tax based on the finan-
cial statement income of corporations with 
at least $1 billion in such income. Allows for 
bonus and accelerated depreciation deduc-
tions when calculating taxable book income. 
Tax on share repurchases. Imposes a new 1 
percent tax on corporations’ net repurchase 
of stock. 
Extension of excess noncorporate losses 
limitation. Extends the limitation on the de-
duction of pass-through losses through tax 
year 2028, which under current law is sched-
uled to expire at the end of 2026. The max-
imum deductible loss, which is indexed to in-
flation, is $540,000 for married taxpayers in 
2022. 
Prescription drug price reforms. Allows 
Medicare to negotiate the price of certain 
prescription drugs; limits the price growth of 
certain drugs paid covered under Medicare to 
inflation; repeals the implementation of a 
‘‘rebate rule’’ scheduled to increase drug-re-
lated Medicare outlays beginning in 2027; re-
designs Medicare Part D benefit formula and 
caps out-of-pocket costs for beneficiaries. 
IRS funding. Appropriates approximately 
$80 billion over the next decade for IRS en-
forcement activities including the hiring and 
training of new auditors, IT systems mod-
ernization, and taxpayer services. 
Table 1 presents PWBM’s estimate of con-
ventional budgetary effects over the 10-year 
budget window defined in the FY2022 rec-
onciliation instructions. We estimate the 
Act would reduce cumulative noninterest 
deficits by $264 billion from FY2022 through 
FY2031. 
ESTIMATED EFFECTS ON INFLATION 
We estimate that the Inflation Reduction 
Act as passed by the Senate would have a 
very modest impact on inflation over the 
next decade. The Act produces some upward 
pressure on prices in 2023 and 2024, but its ef-
fects are too small to meaningfully affect 
measured the Personal Consumption Expend-
itures (PCE) inflation rate as reported by the 
Bureau of Economic Analysis. The Act would 
reduce annual inflation by around 0.1 per-
centage points in about five years, once 
major deficit-reducing provisions of the leg-
islation are fully implemented, but the Act 
would have no measurable impact on infla-
tion after 2028. All these point estimates are 
not statistically different from zero, indi-
cating a low level of confidence that the leg-
islation would have a measurable impact on 
inflation. 
OTHER MACROECONOMIC EFFECTS 
Government spending rises because of the 
climate-related spending and the extension 
of the ACA subsidies are greater than the 
savings from prescription drug pricing re-
forms. However, additional tax revenues are 
greater than the spending increases, which 
leads to a decrease in government debt. Gov-
ernment debt goes down by 4.1 percent in 
2040 and 8 percent in 2050, which crowds-in 
investment in productive private capital. 
The provisions which increase taxes on 
business activity lower the after-tax return 
to investment, which offsets the positive ef-
fects on investment from lower government 
debt. Net of these two effects, private pro-
ductive capital declines by 0.2 percent in 
2031, is unchanged in 2040 and increases by 0.3 
percent in 2050. The drop in productive cap-
ital in 2031 leads to a 0.1 percent decline in 
GDP. 
Nonetheless, as government debt declines, 
private capital increases by 0.3 percent by 
2050, and workers become more productive. 
Higher worker productivity is reflected in 
wages that increase by 0.1 percent in the 
same year. Moreover, the increase in private 
capital combined with the accumulated pro-
ductivity increases from the climate and en-
ergy effects, described in a previous brief, 
leads to an increase in GDP, which grows 0.1 
percent in 2050. 
DISTRIBUTIONAL TAX EFFECTS: CONVENTIONAL 
ESTIMATES 
The Inflation Reduction Act contains a 
wide array of subsidies, taxes, and pricing re-
forms, each with varying impacts on house-
holds and businesses. For example, some 
large businesses would face higher tax bills; 
individuals buying certain health insurance 
plans would face lower out-of-pocket costs; 
some households who evade taxes would be 
made to pay; and pharmaceutical companies 
would earn lower revenues. Though not re-
sponsible for remitting taxes assessed on 
business activity, households bear some of 
the economic burden of such taxes. Share-
holders receive lower after-tax returns, 
and workers earn lower wages with 
fewer productivity-enhancing invest-
ments. 
Distributional analysis traditionally fo-
cuses on the effects of revenue-raising tax 
provisions since attempting to allocate all 
spending—including for roads, education, na-
tional defense, some transfer programs, and 
the bill inherited by future payers for cur-
rent deficits—is challenging and subjective. 
Put differently, distributional analysis typi-
cally is not intended to be a holistic inci-
dence. Instead, distributional analysis at-
tempts to estimate answers the narrower 
question: for a given set of spending benefits

and change in debt, who finances the costs 
under the explicitly stated revenue provi-
sions in the bill? In the case of this Act, the 
revenue is raised from the corporate min-
imum tax as well as the tax on share repur-
chases. 
Conventional distributional analysis meas-
ures the long-run incidence of tax increases 
imposed at a single point in time. PWBM as-
sumes that 75 percent of corporate income 
taxes are borne by owners of capital with the 
remainder borne by labor—magnitudes con-
sistent 
with 
empirical 
research 
and 
scorekeeping convention. We apply this inci-
dence assumption when analyzing the cor-
porate minimum tax provision. However, for 
the stock buyback tax, we assume that 
shareholders bear 100 percent of the burden 
because it is assessed on a discretionary bal-
ance sheet transaction rather than on in-
come from economic production. 
We find that all income groups would bear 
some of the additional burden of the 2023 rev-
enue-raising business tax changes. Average 
burden ranges from $5 for the lowest quin-
tile, to $55 for the middle quintile, to $61,520 
for the top 0.1 percent of tax units. At lower 
incomes, the tax incidence largely reflects 
lower wages over time relative to baseline, 
whereas at high income the tax incidence 
mostly reflects more immediate changes in 
the value of financial assets. 
DISTRIBUTIONAL EFFECTS: DYNAMIC ESTIMATES 
PWBM’s 
dynamic 
distribution 
metric 
shows how benefits and costs accrue across 
generations when accounting for macro-
economic effects, including the increase in 
productivity from lowering carbon emissions 
relative to baseline. While this analysis is 
less granular than conventional distribu-
tional analysis, the dynamic ‘‘equivalent 
variation’’ measure captures important dy-
namics like lifetime income trajectories, the 
‘‘insurance value’’ of means-tested benefits 
and changes in wages and returns to capital 
investments. 
Table 4 reports the equivalent variation for 
households at different ages (relative to the 
year 2022) and incomes. Each value shown in 
Table 1 corresponds to the one-time benefit 
that the corresponding household receives 
from the legislation. For example, the value 
of ¥$700 for a household age 40 in the bottom 
income quintile indicates that this house-
hold is worse off by $700 under this legisla-
tion, including at age 40 and the remainder 
of his or her lifetime. Put differently, this 
household is indifferent between the adop-
tion of the Inflation Reduction Act and mak-
ing a one-time payment of $700 that avoids 
the adoption of the Act. However, a house-
hold in the bottom quintile who is born in 20 
years (¥20 age in 2022) would be $1,900 better 
off. 
Notice two main effects that vary by both 
income and generation: 
First, current workers and retirees prefer 
current law over the provisions in the Infla-
tion Reduction Act. People alive today bear 
the burden of business tax increases in the 
form of lower investment returns and lower 
wages in the near term. However, future gen-
erations gain from the adoption of the Act, 
including positive gains to capital formation 
from reducing the debt as well as the in-
crease in total factor productivity from re-
ducing carbon emissions relative to baseline. 
Second, current higher-income households 
bear a substantially larger share of the tax 
burden while future higher-income house-
holds also gain the most from the improved 
economy. In the long run, the Inflation Re-
duction Act leads to lower government debt, 
higher wages, higher total factor produc-
tivity and higher GDP. Although older work-
ers and retirees prefer current law, this 
growth leads to significant gains for younger 
households in all income brackets. As lower 
government debt crowds in additional pro-
ductive private capital, wages increase. In 
addition, these younger workers begin to 
benefit from the accumulating productivity 
benefits from climate investments. There-
fore, workers in the future will receive high-
er wages and income, which is reflected in 
larger equivalent variations for younger co-
horts of workers. 
Mr. BRADY. Madam Speaker, I yield 
1 minute to the gentleman from Ten-
nessee (Mr. ROSE). 
Mr. ROSE. Madam Speaker, Ten-
nesseans are hurting from the sky-
rocketing cost of living everywhere 
they turn. Now, it seems as if the 
United States has entered into a spend-
ing-induced recession caused by the ir-
responsible fiscal policies of President 
Biden and congressional Democrats. 
Instead of focusing on passing mean-
ingful and impactful legislation to help 
lower the cost of living, we are voting 
on a bill that spends hundreds of bil-
lions of taxpayer dollars. 
The bill will do nothing to help ease 
the pain my neighbors in Tennessee are 
experiencing and, in fact, is likely to 
increase inflation even more and push 
prices on everything even higher. 
It gives a tax break to wealthy Amer-
icans who can already afford to pur-
chase expensive electric cars. It also 
increases taxes amidst a recession, 
which will only make it worse, and it 
allows the IRS to hire an army of 87,000 
new Federal agents to go after the mid-
dle class. 
Madam Speaker, I will be voting 
‘‘no,’’ and I urge my colleagues to do so 
as well. 
b 1400 
Mr. NEAL. Madam Speaker, I yield 3 
minutes to the gentleman from South 
Carolina (Mr. CLYBURN), the majority 
whip of the Democratic Caucus, whose 
district I have visited. 
Mr. CLYBURN. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman for yielding the 
time. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today in full 
support of the Inflation Reduction Act. 
There are few days during a congres-
sional career that feel truly historic. 
For me this is one of them. We have 
passed other historic legislation to 
help our economy overcome the pan-
demic, create jobs, repair and invest in 
our infrastructure, and bolster critical 
supply chains. Passage of the Inflation 
Reduction Act, however, will lead to 
the transformative change Democrats 
in Congress have been working with 
President Biden to achieve for the past 
year and a half. 
The Inflation Reduction Act will 
check inflation by reducing the deficit 
by $300 billion over the next decade. It 
achieves that by ensuring tax fairness 
that requires corporations to pay a 
minimum tax of 15 percent and pro-
tecting families making less than 
$400,000 a year from paying even one 
penny more in taxes. 
In addition, the Inflation Reduction 
Act will assist families by extending 
subsidies for the purchase of health in-
surance through the Affordable Care 
Act. Seniors on Medicare will benefit 
from the government’s ability to nego-
tiate prescription drug prices and by 
capping out-of-pocket drug costs at 
$2,000 per year. 
Having experienced my late wife’s 30- 
year battle with diabetes, I am espe-
cially pleased this bill would cap insu-
lin costs at $35 per month for those on 
Medicare. 
This is a giant step forward, but we 
will continue working to overcome the 
Republican opposition that blocks ex-
tending the same lifesaving measures 
to those on private insurance. 
Finally, this bill will cut climate pol-
lution by 40 percent by 2030. It does so 
by building a new, clean energy econ-
omy that invests in a healthy future 
for all our citizens, creating more than 
9 million new jobs. 
This legislation creates a nuclear 
production tax credit for existing reac-
tors, ensuring that my home State of 
South Carolina continues to be a leader 
in clean energy generation while also 
making electricity affordable and ac-
cessible. 
It also puts $60 billion toward envi-
ronmental justice to help commu-
nities, especially communities of color, 
address the legacy of pollution in their 
neighborhoods. 
I believe today we are demonstrating 
what we Democrats mean when we say 
we are putting people over politics, 
while our Republican colleagues con-
tinue to put their politics over the peo-
ple’s health and well-being. 
Madam Speaker, I am proud to stand 
with the people of America and help 
with this bill. 
Mr. 
BRADY. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
I 
would note that every Democrat in 
Congress, in the House and Senate, 
strongly opposed providing prescrip-
tion drugs for seniors in Medicare part 
D, and then-Leader PELOSI at the time 
said, it would end Medicare as we know 
it to help seniors with these lifesaving 
medicines. 
Madam Speaker, I include in the 
RECORD the following study from the 
University of Chicago which shows the 
Democrats’ drug pricing scheme and 
controls could kill up to 342 cures, 
many of them lifesaving cures, in the 
next two decades alone.

THE EVIDENCE BASE ON THE IMPACT OF PRICE 
CONTROLS ON MEDICAL INNOVATION 
(By Tomas J. Philipson and Troy Durie) 
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
This issue brief reviews the evidence on the 
impact of price controls on biopharma-
ceutical innovation and calibrates what this 
evidence implies for recent price control pro-
posals in the US. A large academic literature 
estimates the effect of future drug revenues 
on R&D spending with a mid-range effect of 
a 1 percent reduction in revenue leading to a 
1.5 percent reduction in R&D activity. Using 
the range of such effects found in the lit-
erature we find the proposed price controls 
of US bill HR3, the Lower Drug Costs Now 
Act, would lead to a 29 to 60 percent reduc-
tion in R&D from 2021 to 2039 which trans-
lates into 167 to 342 fewer new drug approvals

during that period. The mid-range effect of 
the evidence implies a 44.6 percent decline in 
R&D and 254 fewer new drug approvals. As a 
benchmark on the large size of the adverse 
health effects this implies, we conservatively 
find the loss in life from the price controls 
the next 10 years is 20 times larger than the 
loss from COVID–19 to date in the US. We 
argue this is a conservatively low estimate 
of the impact of such proposals even though 
it is as much as a ten times larger reduction 
in new drugs compared to a recent CBO anal-
ysis. 
SECTION 1: INTRODUCTION 
A national debate has emerged again about 
the effect of price controls on pharma-
ceutical innovation. Many proponents of 
price controls for pharmaceutical drugs 
argue that they do not impact innovation 
while opponents argue they will lead to 
fewer new drugs. This issue brief attempts to 
provide insight into the likely effects of re-
cent price control proposals by analyzing 
how the debate can be informed by basic eco-
nomics and the prevailing empirical evi-
dence. 
While the United States has less stringent 
price regulations when compared to other 
nations, the Biden Administration has re-
cently announced plans to lower drug prices 
through policies similar to those outlined in 
a recent bill referred to as the Lower Drug 
Costs Now Act (H.R. 3) that passed the House 
of Representatives in December 2019 and was 
reintroduced in April 2021. This proposal 
would create price controls for the govern-
ment’s highest expenditure drugs and then 
apply price controls to firms conducting pri-
vate sector transactions. This issue brief re-
views the evidence on how sensitive innova-
tion is to changes in revenues and applies 
the evidence to estimate the effect of pro-
posed price controls. 
SECTION 2: EVIDENCE BASE ON REVENUE 
EFFECTS ON INNOVATION 
Biopharmaceutical 
companies 
routinely 
project future market size and profits for 
their products to determine the rate of re-
turn on investment (ROI) from R&D. A large 
body of evidence suggests that these market 
practices translate into a predictable posi-
tive relationship between realized revenues 
and R&D spending in the economy in general 
and for biomedical innovation in particular. 
A rich academic literature quantifies this 
relationship between future revenues and 
pharmaceutical innovation. For assessing 
evidence related to revenue effects on R&D, 
it is important to recognize that global prof-
its drive innovation and that revenues from 
different countries have different effects on 
those global profits because of different prof-
it margins across countries. Expected earn-
ings, not revenues, drive R&D investments. 
Therefore, decreases in US revenue will have 
larger effects on global profits than revenue 
losses in price controlled markets in Europe 
due to higher profit margins in the US. Gold-
man and Lakdawalla (2018) find that pharma-
ceutical profits in the United States ac-
counts for 64 to 78 percent of global profits, 
similar to an estimate from the Council of 
Economic 
Advisers 
(CEA) 
(2018). 
Con-
sequently, the evidence finds that studies fo-
cusing on US revenue losses show larger 
R&D effects than those studying revenue 
losses in Europe. 
In particular, a set of papers looks at the 
expansion of the Medicare prescription drug 
benefit, Medicare Part D, which provides the 
most relevant evidence for assessing the rev-
enue effects of Medicare policy changes. 
They find that companies recognized this ex-
pansion and increased innovation in drugs 
treating diseases prevalent in the elderly 
population more so than innovation in non- 
elderly diseases (Blume-Kohout and Sood 
2013). Quantifying that relationship, a 1 per-
cent increase in market size due to Medicare 
Part D leads to a 2.8 percent increase in new 
drug approvals. Another often cited paper 
finds a 1 percent increase in potential mar-
ket size leads to a 4–6 percent increase in the 
entry of new drugs (Acemoglu and Linn 2004) 
in the US. Though other studies have found 
lower effects in Europe of the relationship 
between potential market size and the num-
ber of new treatments, a clear strong posi-
tive relationship exists (Dubois et al. 2015). 
Other studies show that a 1 percent increase 
in price leads to a 0.22–1.33 percent increase 
in innovation. Another extensive literature 
illustrates how companies change their in-
vestments in lower quality drugs due to 
price controls and other regulations that de-
crease how much can be charged for high- 
quality drugs. 
We synthesized the evidence base by com-
puting the average R&D elasticity with re-
spect to revenue estimated from 10 different 
studies looking at the effect of a price 
change, expected market, and overall rev-
enue on R&D. Table 1 illustrates the elastic-
ities used from each paper, and the average 
elasticity across these 10 studies is 1.54. 
Note: Acemoglu and Linn (2004) find an 
elasticity range of 4–6 based on if all ap-
proved including generics are included or 
not. We take the midpoint of this range. Ab-
bott and Vernon (2005) find a price cut of 40 
to 50 percent lowers R&D by 30 to 60 percent. 
Taking the midpoint of these numbers gives 
a 45 percent price cut leads to a 45 percent 
decrease in R&D, or an elasticity of 1. 
To assess the impact on the number of new 
drugs from reductions in R&D spending, a 
common approach is to divide the reduction 
in R&D spending by an estimate of the costs 
of bringing a drug to market. This is a useful 
approach and implies a proportional reduc-
tion in new drugs to the reduction in R&D 
spending regardless of the particular cost per 
drug. In other words, using this method-
ology, a 10 percent reduction in R&D spend-
ing leads to 10 percent fewer drugs regardless 
of the cost per drug estimate used. The elas-
ticity of R&D spending with respect to rev-
enue in this case therefore also represents 
the elasticity of new drugs to revenue. 
Despite the evidence, there is some debate 
among law makers concerning whether rev-
enue or price controls affect innovation at 
all. However, the evidence is consistent with 
common market practices of biopharma-
ceutical innovation—a positive relationship 
between investment and earnings. Such mar-
ket practices include the use of net present 
value (NPV) calculations to determine a new 
drug’s ROI. Biopharmaceutical companies 
determine the demand for new drug thera-
pies by analyzing the prevalence of disease, 
insurance coverage of the population af-
fected by the disease, and reimbursement by 
payers managing patients’ care. The pharma-
ceutical industry spent more than $91 billion 
on R&D in 2020. In obtaining such R&D fund-
ing, companies have relied on venture cap-
ital funding, licensing agreements, or merg-
ers and acquisitions as well as their own rev-
enue. All rely on ROI assessments to evalu-
ate R&D investments. Indeed, markets rou-
tinely assess the enterprise value of firms by 
estimating the present value of expected 
cash flows across all business lines and 
projects. 
SECTION 3: CALIBRATION OF THE IMPACT ON 
INNOVATION OF PROPOSED US PRICE CONTROLS 
This section evaluates what the evidence 
implies for the innovation effects of proposed 
US price controls. We calibrate that the 
price controls implemented in the United 
States would lead to a 29.2 to 60.0 percent re-
duction in R&D from 2021 to 2039. This 
equates to $952.2 billion to $2.0 trillion in lost 
R&D spending and 167 to 342 fewer new drug 
approvals during this period. This means an-
nual new drug approvals will be 11.7 to 24.0 
percent lower per year from 2021 to 2029 and 
45.0 to 92.4 percent lower from 2030 to 2039. 
We discuss how these findings, as well as 
findings from other studies, differ from CBO 
(2019), which finds only 37 fewer new drug ap-
provals over this time period, which is 550.2 
to 1,024 percent lower than our estimates. 
Our estimates are conservative as the entire 
evidence base is considered and not only the 
evidence base for the more R&D sensitive US 
market. 
It should be noted, however, that making 
comparisons to CBO estimates is made more 
difficult due to the highly non-transparent 
discussion of their underlying analysis, 
which makes third-party replication of their 
results impossible. This ‘‘black-box’’ nature 
of analysis is often the case with government 
reports and raises larger issues with the dif-
ficulty for private parties and taxpayers— 
who funded the analysis—being able to as-
sess their accuracy. In contrast, we believe 
the presentation of the evidence discussed 
above, and the innovation effects they di-
rectly imply, is highly transparent as it sim-
ply documents the findings of the studies 
and their implied effects. 
3.1 The Proposed US Price Controls 
The United States has fewer restrictions 
on price than other countries, but the Biden 
Administration has announced their goal to 
lower drug prices through greater price regu-
lation, as set forth in a recent bill referred to 
as H.R. 3. This proposal would change the 
way certain single-source brand drugs are 
priced for Medicare beneficiaries by requir-
ing drug manufacturers to ‘‘negotiate’’ drug 
prices with the Secretary of Health and 
Human Services. A prohibitive excise tax of 
65 to 95 percent will be applied to a com-
pany’s annual gross sales if they refuse to 
negotiate, making the requirement largely 
equivalent to mandatory price controls. 
Drug prices set by the Secretary may not ex-
ceed the prices in specified countries by 
more than 20 percent and price increases 
would be capped at the rate of inflation (CBO 
2021). 
In addition, these price controls would also 
be extended to private transactions by em-
ployer-based plans as stated on August 12, 
2021 by President Biden and as implied by 
the proposed legislation. Private payers can 
choose the lower prices negotiated by the 
government, which they presumably will. 
3.2 CBO’s Estimated Effects and Alternative Es-
timated Effects of the Proposed Price Con-
trols 
CBO (2019) previously estimated that a 
drop in future revenues due to H.R. 3 would 
lead to 8 fewer drugs from 2020 to 2029, which 
would then expand to 30 fewer drugs from 
2030 to 2039). In August 2021, CBO (2021b) up-
dated its estimated impact of price negotia-
tions to be 2 fewer drugs in the first decade 
(0.5 percent), 23 fewer in the second decade (5 
percent), and 34 fewer drugs in the third dec-
ade (8 percent). Since the development proc-
ess takes about a decade, the long run effects 
of the bill will be larger than its short-run 
effects. To align these estimates with our 
time period of 2021–2039, we lower their esti-
mate to 7 fewer drugs from 2021 to 2029 and 
keep the estimate of 30 fewer drugs from 2030 
to 2039. 
Consistent with our analysis, other ana-
lysts’ assessments of CBO’s 2019 analysis of 
H.R. 3 conclude that CBO (2019) likely under-
estimates the impact of H.R. 3. Charles River 
Associates (2021) finds the CBO study under-
estimates the company revenue impact by 
assuming companies will be able to set their 
price at the high end of the allowed price

range, and that companies will be able to in-
crease their non-U.S. price. Both assump-
tions may not be true due to uncertainty 
around behavioral responses in negotiations. 
Further, for the loss-of-revenue impact on 
R&D, CBO extrapolates price control effects 
from smaller markets, and they do not ac-
count for the larger impact on targeted dis-
ease groups most impacted by the policy like 
rare diseases and oncology. CBO’s analysis 
relies on Dubois et al. (2015) to estimate the 
effect of H.R. 3 on R&D, but CRA notes that 
this estimated effect is smaller than most of 
the other literature, too dependent on spe-
cific assumptions, and may not be as rel-
evant to a policy of H.R. 3’s magnitude. 
Other analysts’ estimates of the impact of 
the price controls introduced in H.R. 3 show 
a considerably larger impact on global reve-
nues and R&D than assumed by CBO. Stengel 
et al. (2020) estimate drug manufacturer rev-
enues would fall 34 to 44 percent, which 
would equate to about $1.3 to $1.7 trillion in 
total lost global revenues from 2020–2029. 
Vital Transformation (2021) estimates annual 
earnings would fall 56 percent, or on average 
$102 billion a year, starting in the year 2024. 
This fall in earnings when fitted to past data 
would have lowered new approved drug 
therapies in their sample from 68 new drugs 
to 7 new drugs, an 89.7 percent decline from 
2010 to 2019. 
3.3 Effects of the Proposed Price Controls Im-
plied by the Evidence Base 
In light of the reported shortcomings in 
the CBO (2019) report, we used the broader 
evidence base discussed in this issue brief to 
assess the effect H.R. 3’s proposed price con-
trols would have on innovation. We create a 
range of the estimated drop in global drug 
manufacturer revenues by taking the CBO’s 
lower estimate of 19 percent and the mid-
point revenue effect of alternative studies, 39 
percent, from Stengel et al. (2020). 
As discussed earlier, a conservatively low 
estimate of the elasticity of revenue on ei-
ther R&D or the introduction of new drugs is 
1.5 based on current evidence. We apply this 
elasticity to the 19 to 39 percent decline in 
revenues to derive a percentage reduction in 
R&D. This percentage reduction is thereafter 
used to calibrate the reduction in absolute 
R&D spending or number of approved drugs 
which is applied to the CBO baseline trend in 
absolute values. In other words, the reduc-
tion in R&D spending and the number of new 
drug approvals during 2021 to 2039 is obtained 
by determining how much would be lost in 
each of those measures with the number of 
approved drugs being compared to CBOs 
baseline trends given the percent reduction 
in R&D. We create our own trend for R&D 
spending by taking a time series from 
PhRMA’s 2021 Membership Survey showing 
pharmaceutical R&D spending from 2000–2019 
and calculated the compound annual growth 
rate to get a trend for expected R&D spend-
ing through 2039. We then applied the impact 
on R&D to each year and summed these val-
ues to get a total. For new drug approvals, 
we use the 30 new drug approvals baseline 
from CBO (2019) and applied the impact on 
R&D for each year and summed. 
Table 2 illustrates our main findings. 
Using the average elasticity on the 19 to 39 
percent drop in global revenues, innovation 
through R&D is expected to drop 29 to 60 per-
cent. Using the middle of our range, this 
would equate to lost R&D spending of up to 
$1.5 trillion. We find that this drop in spend-
ing will lead to 167 to 342 fewer new drug ap-
provals. 
Our estimates are therefore 550.2 percent 
to 1024.0 percent larger than CBO (2019)’s es-
timated 37 fewer new drug approvals, ad-
justed to our time period. CBO (2019) points 
out that lower R&D spending will take time 
to be reflected in new drug approvals due to 
the long development process, so the reduc-
tion in revenue results in 7 fewer new drug 
approval, 18.9 percent of their total estimate, 
in the first 9 years and 30 more in the fol-
lowing decade, 81.l percent of their total esti-
mate. We assume this breakdown as well, so 
new drug approvals will fall by 32 to 65 ap-
provals from 2021 to 2029 and 135 to 277 ap-
provals from 2030 to 2039. These significant 
drops in new drug approvals will lead to 
delays in needed drug therapies, resulting in 
worse health outcomes for patients. 
The failure to discover and get new drug 
approvals leads to worse health outcomes. 
CEA (2019) did an early analysis of H.R. 3 
finding 375 million to 100 million life years 
lost due to this policy’s impact on R&D 
spending through 2029. For comparison, 
using death data through September 22, 2021, 
SARS–CoV–2 has directly reduced health 
outcomes by 7.5 million life years. The 7.5 
million life years lost is only just over 10 
percent as large as the midpoint of CEA 
(2019)’s estimate due to H.R. 3. We calculate 
this loss in life years by applying life expect-
ancy estimates conditional on age from CDC 
to the age distribution of deaths from SARS– 
CoV–2 from CDC updated through September 
22, 2021. Then we multiply the life expect-
ancy at each age grouping by the number of 
deaths and sum to get 7.5 million life years 
lost. A prior study shows how every $2,000 
spent on pharmaceutical research and devel-
opment increases population health by one 
statistical life-year (Lichtenberg 2002). When 
applied to our R&D spending estimates, this 
would lead to 159.3 million to 326.9 million 
life years lost by 2029 which increases to 476.1 
million 
to 
977.2 
million 
by 
2039. 
This 
amounts to the direct negative health effects 
of SARS–CoV–2 to be only 3.1 percent as 
large as our midpoint estimate by 2029 and 
1.0 percent as large by 2039. Price controls 
have significant health costs to the U.S. pop-
ulation. 
Our analysis likely underestimates true in-
novation effects, which, if considered fully 
could make our findings even further away 
from the CBO estimates. This is because the 
average R&D elasticity of 1.5 used included 
studies of non-U.S. markets with lower earn-
ings effects than U.S. markets. Given that 
the U.S. has higher margins, price controls 
are expected to have a larger impact on earn-
ings. Thus, only using the larger estimated 
elasticities from U.S. markets, which would 
double the elasticity of 1.5, would yield pro-
portionally larger differences between the 
evidence base and the CBO estimates. 
Mr. BRADY. Madam Speaker, I yield 
1 minute to the gentleman from Flor-
ida (Mr. RUTHERFORD). 
Mr. RUTHERFORD. Madam Speaker, 
I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today in 
strong 
opposition 
to 
this 
reckless 
spending bill, which, contrary to its 
name, will do absolutely nothing to ad-
dress inflation. In fact, the bill before 
us today will further threaten the pros-
perity of hardworking, middle-class 
taxpayers. 
The same leaders who drove this 
economy into a recession are back. But 
this time, it is another failed plan to 
raise taxes, build more bureaucracy, 
and create a government slush fund 
with taxpayer dollars. 
We need to call this bill what it is. It 
is a $700-billion debacle that will drive 
up costs for everyone, double the size 
of the IRS, attack medical innovation, 
as you have already heard, and use $350 
billion to implement the Green New 
Deal all while giving handouts to the 
wealthy. 
Hardworking Americans across the 
country are facing the reality of rising 
prices and a nationwide recession. 
They deserve leaders who are focusing 
on the lives of everyday Americans, 
not politicians who pander to the 
President and his failed policies. 
Madam Speaker, I urge a ‘‘no’’ vote 
on this egregious bill. 
Mr. NEAL. Madam Speaker, I yield 
11⁄2 minutes to the distinguished gen-
tleman 
from 
Pennsylvania 
(Mr. 
BRENDAN F. BOYLE). 
Mr. BRENDAN F. BOYLE of Pennsyl-
vania. Madam Speaker, the word ‘‘his-
toric’’ is probably overused at times. 
Really, it is a day like today when the 
word ‘‘historic’’ is warranted. 
For decades, politicians of both par-
ties talked about giving Medicare the 
ability to negotiate prescription drugs 
to bring down the costs for seniors. 
Today, in this bill, we are doing it. 
For decades, politicians talked about 
capping the amount of money seniors 
paid every year on prescription drugs. 
Some in my district in Philadelphia 
pay $5,000 a year, $10,000 a year. This 
bill caps it at no more than $2,000 a 
year. 
Again, for decades, politicians talked 
about the need to address climate 
change and to make a large invest-
ment, so that we can finally tackle this 
existential challenge for America and 
for the world. Here in this bill we are 
doing it: the largest single investment 
to address climate change in our Na-
tion’s history. 
I know that on social media and on 
TV, it tends to be the performative pol-
itics that get most of the attention, 
that helps breed cynicism within our 
constituents. It is legislation like this 
that makes a difference in people’s 
lives. This is why we are here as law-
makers: to do the people’s business.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H7674 
August 12, 2022 
Mr. BRADY. Madam Speaker, I yield 
1 minute to the gentleman from Ohio 
(Mr. DAVIDSON). 
Mr. DAVIDSON. Madam Speaker, 
this bill will not reduce inflation. It 
will pull us deeper into the current re-
cession and take America further in 
the wrong direction. It is simply more 
government and less freedom. 
In the past year, inflation has ex-
ceeded 13 percent, and real wages have 
effectively fallen by 4.5 percent. The 
Federal Reserve and Big Government 
combined to fuel inflation, and now 
people are being crushed by these high 
prices. You cannot spend your way out 
of inflation. 
But that is exactly what this bill 
tries to do with $745 billion in new 
spending. It raises taxes in a recession. 
And it gives more than six times the 
agency’s current annual budget for the 
IRS. It is going to more than double 
audits on families. 
Instead of addressing the 32 percent 
increase in energy prices by increasing 
domestic production, this bill spends 
billions on Green New Deal pet projects 
like a $27 billion EPA-run Climate 
Bank and a $250-billion federally run 
Department of Energy loan program. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues, please oppose this bill. 
Mr. NEAL. Madam Speaker, I yield 
11⁄2 minutes to the gentleman from Vir-
ginia (Mr. BEYER), who has had a pro-
found influence on this legislation and 
knows it inside and out. 
Mr. BEYER. Madam Speaker, today 
we protect the world for future genera-
tions. 
Madam Speaker, the Inflation Reduc-
tion Act will do untold good for the Na-
tion and for the American people. This 
is our generation’s signature contribu-
tion to American history, our Social 
Security Act, or Civil Rights Act, or 
even the Bill of Rights. 
The act will lower healthcare costs, 
reduce prescription drug prices, and 
create jobs. We have emphatically put 
people over politics. 
Much like a proposal I introduced 
with Senators ELIZABETH WARREN and 
ANGUS KING, it will actually reduce the 
deficit by preventing tax avoidance for 
the biggest corporations in this coun-
try, requiring them to shoulder their 
fair burden of the tax responsibility. 
Most importantly, Congress is finally 
taking the sweeping, ambitious action 
we desperately need to prevent the 
worst effects of the climate crisis. We 
are passing the most important envi-
ronmental bill in history. 
I am privileged to serve on Chairman 
NEAL’s brilliant and enlightened Ways 
and Means Committee. I am proud of 
the diverse tax credit provisions I 
partnered with my distinguished Mem-
bers and friends. 
These are the parts of the act which 
will 
have 
enormous 
climate 
con-
sequences: 
They will accelerate the adoption of 
zero emission mid-size trucks, vans, 
and other commercial vehicles. 
They will scale up direct air capture 
technology to remove carbon pollution 
directly from the atmosphere. 
They will incentivize the reduction of 
emissions from commercial buildings. 
These provisions and the bill as a 
whole will create huge numbers of 
good-paying jobs. 
Then there is the big picture. This 
bill will put us on a path to reduce our 
target emissions and actually help save 
the planet. 
Madam Speaker, I thank my col-
leagues for their support. 
Mr. BRADY. Madam Speaker, I in-
clude in the RECORD the following edi-
torial from The Wall Street Journal, 
which shows this bill will only reduce 
global temperatures by, at best, 0.028 
degrees Fahrenheit throughout this 
century and as little as 0.0009 degrees 
over the entire century. 
[From The Wall Street Journal] 
TILTING AT CLIMATE WINDMILLS 
Nearly all of Washington—Democrats, the 
press, lobbyists—is taking a victory lap with 
Senate passage of the Schumer-Manchin tax, 
climate and drug price control bill. The cli-
mate lobby is especially thrilled, claiming a 
historic victory that will reduce tempera-
tures, hold back the rising sea, and save the 
planet. 
Or, maybe not. Our contributor Bjorn 
Lomborg looked at the Rhodium Group esti-
mate for CO2 emissions reductions from 
Schumer-Manchin policies. He then plugged 
them into the United Nations climate model 
to measure the impact on global tempera-
ture by 2100. He finds the bill will reduce the 
estimated global temperature rise at the end 
of this century by all of 0.028 degrees Fahr-
enheit in the optimistic case. In the pessi-
mistic case, the temperature difference will 
be 0.0009 degrees Fahrenheit. 
In other words, the climate provisions in 
this ballyhooed legislation will have no no-
table impact on the climate. 
This isn’t surprising. No matter what the 
U.S. does to reduce greenhouse-gas emis-
sions, it will be dwarfed by what the rest of 
the world does. China, India and Africa 
aren’t about to stop burning fossil fuels as 
they develop, and China is sprinting ahead to 
build huge new coal capacity despite its 
pledge to start reducing emissions after 2030. 
Barring a breakthrough in battery or other 
technology, carbon emissions will continue 
to increase. No one knows how much the 
Earth’s temperature will warm, though even 
the U.N. model has modified its estimates 
from the apocalyptic predictions of some 
years ago. 
Schumer-Manchin won’t reduce inflation, 
won’t reduce the budget deficit, and it won’t 
reduce the world’s temperature. What it will 
do is transfer some $369 billion from tax-
payers and drug companies to the pockets of 
green energy businesses and investors. It will 
tighten the hold that politicians have on the 
allocation of capital, as they pick winners 
and losers with their grants and tax credits. 
Everyone will get a nice warm feeling as 
they pretend they are cooling the climate. 
Mr. BRADY. Madam Speaker, I yield 
1 minute to the gentlewoman from New 
York (Ms. MALLIOTAKIS). 
Ms. MALLIOTAKIS. Madam Speaker, 
at a time when the country is facing a 
40-year high rate of inflation, Ameri-
cans are struggling, the economy is 
contracting, and we are in a recession, 
they are jamming through a $750-bil-
lion bill with a slush fund that will 
only further fuel inflation, lead to 
higher energy costs, and drive up man-
ufacturing costs as a supply chain cri-
sis persists. 
What a lousy idea to raise taxes dur-
ing a recession. This will not just hit 
businesses, but families earning as lit-
tle as $50,000, and that is exactly why 
this bill is doubling the IRS by 87,000 
agents. 
This is a level that is: 
More than the population of Biden’s 
entire hometown of Scranton, Pennsyl-
vania. 
More than the fans that can fill the 
MetLife Stadium where the Giants 
play. 
Three times the staff at the Pen-
tagon. 
Four times the Border Patrol agents 
when we have a border crisis; and 
Eight times the drug enforcement 
agents when fentanyl is taking record 
lives of young Americans. 
This bill does not include one cop as 
crime is skyrocketing in cities like 
mine. 
This Congress is disconnected with 
the real problems that Americans face. 
To call this the Inflation Reduction 
Act is a lie. 
Mr. NEAL. Madam Speaker, I yield 
11⁄2 minutes to the gentleman from Illi-
nois (Mr. SCHNEIDER), who is a very 
valued member of the Ways and Means 
Committee. 
Mr. SCHNEIDER. Madam Speaker, I 
proudly rise today in support of the In-
flation Reduction Act. This historic 
bill will lower the cost of energy and 
healthcare for millions of Americans. 
Just as important, it makes the largest 
ever investment in tackling the cli-
mate crisis, helping us cut carbon 
emissions by 40 percent by 2030. 
These historic investments will im-
prove the lives of hardworking Ameri-
cans, all while reducing our deficit by 
$300 billion. 
This bill will allow the HHS Sec-
retary to negotiate the prices of some 
of the most expensive drugs. It caps the 
price of insulin at $35 for Americans on 
Medicare. It also includes expanded 
coverage 
for 
low-income 
Medicare 
beneficiaries, which I have championed 
for years. 
On climate change, I am particularly 
proud that this bill includes my legis-
lation, the Sustainable Skies Act, that 
will help dramatically reduce green-
house gas emissions from aviation, 
which today accounts for 2 percent of 
the world’s annual emissions. 
The bill also tackles the high energy 
costs that Americans face with invest-
ments in consumer home energy, from 
rooftop solar panels to electric HVAC 
systems. 
Let me repeat: this bill is entirely 
and responsibly paid for and then some. 
Again, our deficit will be cut by more 
than $300 billion by the action Congress 
is taking today. 
Madam Speaker, Americans have 
been hard hit by a once-in-a-century 
pandemic and then by the consequent 
effects of global inflation and supply 
chain crises. And every year the im-
pacts of climate change become more 
severe and more costly. Americans 
need relief.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H7675 
August 12, 2022 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to vote for the Inflation Reduc-
tion Act and give our fellow citizens 
the relief they deserve. 
Mr. BRADY. Madam Speaker, I in-
clude in the RECORD the following arti-
cle by Americans for Tax Reform, 
which debunks the Inflation Reduction 
Act by describing the top five budget 
gimmicks in this bill, showing over 
$330 billion in fake savings, more than 
the so-called deficit reduction in the 
bill. 
5 GIMMICKS IN DEMOCRATS’ RECONCILIATION 
BILL 
Democrats’ reconciliation bill, improperly 
named the ‘‘Inflation Reduction Act,’’ con-
tains numerous gimmicks designed to de-
ceive voters and circumvent congressional 
rules. 
This bill uses several budget gimmicks: a 
short extension of Obamacare subsidies, a re-
peal of the ‘‘rebate rule’’ that never has nor 
never will go into effect, and supersizing the 
Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to ‘‘solve’’ an 
overstated tax gap, This bill attempts to cir-
cumvent the Byrd rule by erroneously call-
ing a mandate ‘‘a tax.’’ The bill would also 
violate President Biden’s tax pledge to not 
raise taxes on anyone making less than 
$400,000 a year. 
1. THE OBAMACARE SUBSIDIES IN THIS BILL ARE 
ONLY EXTENDED UNTIL 2025, DESPITE EXPEC-
TATIONS
THAT
THEY
WILL
BE
EXTENDED 
AGAIN. 
In the American Rescue Plan (ARP), Presi-
dent Biden and congressional Democrats ex-
panded 
Obamacare 
subsidies—specifically 
the advanced refundable premium tax cred-
it—by increasing benefits for households at 
every income level and expanding them to 
households earning more than 400 percent of 
the federal poverty level. Because these en-
hanced benefits are set to expire later this 
year, Democrats are attempting to extend 
them through 2025 in this legislation. 
Once these expanded subsidies have been in 
place for five years total, it will be ex-
tremely difficult to get rid of them. Given 
the high likelihood—and expectation—that 
these subsidies will be extended once they’re 
set to expire again, the three-year extension 
is a clear gimmick. 
If the expanded subsidies were extended in-
definitely, the 10-year budget deficit reduc-
tion falls from $248 billion to $89 billion, ac-
cording to the Penn Wharton Budget Model. 
2. THE BILL REPEALS THE ‘‘REBATE RULE,’’ DE-
SPITE THE FACT THAT IT WAS NEVER GOING 
INTO EFFECT. 
Under the Trump administration, the HHS 
released the rebate rule which sought to 
lower drug prices by altering payments from 
drugmakers to pharmacy benefit managers. 
The 
Trump 
administration 
never 
went 
through with this rule nor has the Biden ad-
ministration taken it back up again (to be 
clear, they never will). 
Even so, Democrats claim the repeal would 
reduce the deficit by $120 billion. Clearly, it 
would not. 
Already, between the likely extension of 
Obamacare subsidies and this rebate rule, 
the bill doesn’t actually reduce the deficit at 
all. 
3. THE IRS WOULD BE SUPERSIZED TO SOLVE AN 
OVERSTATED ‘‘TAX GAP.’’ 
The Joint Committee on Taxation esti-
mates that $80 billion in additional funding 
to the IRS would increase tax revenue by 
$125 billion. While increasing tax enforce-
ment would certainly raise more money from 
unsuspecting small businesses, the Left has 
assumed that this can and will be done 
through 
increased 
enforcement 
on 
the 
wealthy. 
In reality, wealthy individuals and large 
corporations are almost always tax compli-
ant. The wealthy and large corporations al-
ready have armies of lawyers and account-
ants that ensure they legally take advantage 
of the plethora of credits and deductions of-
fered by the tax code. Further, the IRS al-
ready audits the largest corporations at high 
rates. It doesn’t matter how much more the 
agency receives in funding—they will not 
find violations in the law that do not exist. 
Thus, the IRS won’t find much more rev-
enue from their big targets. 
Additional funding will instead be used for 
invasive, time-consuming, and non-fruitful 
audits of middle-class Americans and small 
businesses. The IRS previously announced a 
goal to increase small business audits by 50 
percent. 
As previously reported by CNBC, experts 
say a fattened-up IRS would go after small 
businesses that necessarily depend on cash 
transactions. 
4. THE BILL IMPLEMENTS PRICE CONTROLS 
THROUGH A 95 PERCENT TAX, 
The bill would give the Health and Human 
Services Secretary the authority to ‘‘nego-
tiate’’ the price of prescription drugs on be-
half of Medicare. By ‘‘negotiation,’’ Demo-
crats mean drug manufacturers will pay a 95 
percent excise tax on prescription drug prof-
its unless they accept price controls set by 
the Department of Health and Human Serv-
ices (HHS). In 2023, the Secretary would be 
able to determine the prices of 10 prescrip-
tion drugs. The determined price would go 
into effect in 2026. The number of drugs the 
HHS Secretary could set prices for would 
then increase to 15 in 2028 and 20 in 2029. 
That tax itself is forecasted to raise zero 
revenue. Neither the JCT analysis nor any 
independent analyses estimate that any 
company would pay this exorbitant tax. A 95 
percent ‘‘tax’’ on revenue is just a stick to 
enforce a mandate for government price con-
trols. This is a way to circumvent the Byrd 
rule, which requires that all the provisions 
in a reconciliation bill directly change fed-
eral spending or revenue. While a tax is obvi-
ously protected under this rule, it’s not clear 
that mandates of this kind are. 
5. THE RECONCILIATION BILL RAISES TAXES ON 
THOSE MAKING LESS THAN $400,000, VIOLATING 
PRESIDENT BIDEN’S TAX PLEDGE. 
Throughout the ten-year window, the JCT 
estimates that nearly every single income 
group will see their taxes raised. Those 
Americans making less than $200,000 will see 
their taxes raised by nearly $17 billion. For 
those making between $200,000 and $500,000 
(as the JCT doesn’t cut off brackets at 
$400,000), their taxes would increase by an-
other $14 billion. 
Senate Finance Ranking Member Mike 
Crapo (R–Idaho) rightly points out that at 
least half of all new tax revenue raised by 
this bill would come from those earning 
under $400,000. 
Clearly, this tax hike violates President 
Biden’s pledge not to raise one penny of 
taxes on any American earning less than 
$400,000 per year. 
If Biden and Harris want to keep their 
pledge, they must veto the bill or instruct 
Democrats to change the bill. 
Mr. BRADY. I yield 1 minute to the 
gentleman 
from 
Tennessee 
(Mr. 
FLEISCHMANN). 
b 1415 
Mr. FLEISCHMANN. Madam Speak-
er, the dying ember that is the Demo-
cratic majority in both Houses once 
again seeks to burn the American peo-
ple. $80 billion for the IRS, and they 
champion it. 
I will stand with the hardworking 
American people of this Nation. Demo-
crats, you can have the IRS. 
Raising taxes at a time of recession, 
at a time of economic gloom, I will 
stand with the hardworking entre-
preneurs of America any time over 
raising taxes. 
Madam Speaker, the American peo-
ple know better. The American people 
deserve better. The American people 
will get better in November. I urge a 
‘‘no’’ vote on this bill. 
Mr. NEAL. Madam Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the very capable gentle-
woman 
from 
New 
York 
(Ms. 
VELA´ ZQUEZ). 
Ms. VELA´ ZQUEZ. Madam Speaker, I 
rise in strong support of this historic 
legislation. 
The climate crisis is the single-most 
important issue facing our future, the 
future we will all share, Democrats and 
Republicans. 
I understand this is a down payment 
on climate action and more needs to be 
done, but let’s focus on what this bill 
does. It lowers the cost of healthcare 
and prescription drugs. It lowers en-
ergy costs and delivers the largest-ever 
climate action by investing in domes-
tic energy production and manufac-
turing while reducing carbon emissions 
by roughly 40 percent by 2030. It lowers 
the deficit and helps fight inflation by 
making a historic payment on deficit 
reduction of $300 billion. We do this by 
making the biggest corporations and 
ultrawealthy pay their fair share in 
taxes. 
Enough with the fear-mongering by 
the other side. Let’s get this done on 
behalf of hardworking families across 
America. 
Mr. BRADY. Madam Speaker, I in-
clude the following polling reality 
study in the RECORD, which shows that 
once Americans learn the details of the 
so-called Medicare negotiation, which 
is price setting, that their choices and 
access to lifesaving cures will be lim-
ited, public support for negotiation 
plummets. 
ANALYSIS: AMERICANS DON’T SUPPORT SUR-
RENDERING
INNOVATION
FOR
DEMOCRATS’ 
DRUG PRICE CONTROLS 
Democrats are selling their socialist drug 
pricing scheme as a way to lower prices, but 
Americans oppose it once they learn that 
this kills cures and life-improving treat-
ments. 
What they aren’t telling you is this: Their 
drug price control scheme will kill innova-
tion, mean fewer new treatments and cures, 
and a loss of jobs in the biopharma industry. 
Once Americans learn about these con-
sequences they reject it outright. Further-
more, this isn’t a ‘‘negotiation’’—Democrats’ 
proposal 
has 
Washington 
dictate 
prices 
under threat of exorbitantly higher taxes on 
medical innovators. 
KEY TAKEAWAYS: 
The vast majority of Americans oppose govern-
ment negotiation if it results in fewer new 
medicines being developed in the future 
A 50-state Morning Consult/PhRMA poll 
shows two thirds of Americans oppose price 
controls if they put the government in

charge and take away power from doctors to 
prescribe medicines that best meet the needs 
of patients. 
The Kaiser Family Foundation also finds 
that Democrats’ price control scheme drops 
in popularity the moment respondents see 
that it could lead to less research and devel-
opment of new drugs or limit access to newer 
prescription drugs. 
A March 2022 Ipsos/PhRMA poll reveals 
only 14 percent of Americans support Wash-
ington price controls if they limit their ac-
cess to newer prescription medicines. Even if 
it ‘‘only’’ delays access, only 15 percent sup-
port the proposal then. 
The same poll shows that seniors are even 
more skeptical—10 percent support the price 
controls when they learn of how it delays 
people’s access to new medicines. 
Numerous studies show the proposal would kill 
new treatments, including a University of 
Chicago study that shows the number going 
up to 342 
Democrats’ price-fixing scheme would kill 
up to 342 cures, according to a study by the 
University of Chicago, yet they claim it’s 
merely a ‘‘negotiating’’ approach that would 
lower the price of drugs. 
A new study from Vital Transformation 
finds that if drug price controls under con-
sideration in the Senate had been enacted 
during the last decade, only six of 110 cur-
rently approved therapies would have made 
it to patients. 
Loss of innovation = a death sentence for 
patients. Looking at CMS drug utilization 
data from 2016 to 2020 of the types of drugs 
expected to be most impacted by Democrats’ 
price fixing, even the most conservative esti-
mates of innovation lost from these policies 
could have left over 42 million patients with-
out the medicine they needed. 
Surrendering in the fight against cancer: 
The Council of State Bio Associations writes 
that socialist drug price controls will get in 
the way of the fight against cancer: ‘‘In on-
cology alone, the University of Chicago 
found that price controls would reduce over-
all annual cancer R&D spending by about 
$18.1 billion, or 31.8 percent.’’ 
They continue: ‘‘The specter of govern-
ment price setting threatens to undermine a 
sector that has created over 1.8 million jobs 
across all 50 states and that represents a 
large portion of our nation’s Gross Domestic 
Product (GDP)—generating an economic out-
put of approximately $2.6 trillion annually.’’ 
Limiting patients’ access to low-cost medi-
cines: Back in March, medical innovators 
wrote to Congress that ‘‘The untested ap-
proach in the House-passed Build Back Bet-
ter Act (H.R. 5376) does not address these 
challenges and could in fact harm future sav-
ings from generic and biosimilar medicines. 
The Build Back Better Act’s approach to di-
rect negotiations in Medicare and inflation- 
based penalties, as passed by the House, 
would alter the incentive for generic and bio-
similar manufacturers to develop new medi-
cines [. . .] and is misguided and would limit 
patients’ access to low-cost medicines.’’ 
The Bipartisan Solution That Works: The 
Lower Costs, More Cures Act (H.R. 19) low-
ers costs for all prescription drugs 
Every provision in H.R. 19 is bipartisan. It 
will lower health care costs and ensure 
America leads in health care innovation for 
more cures and treatments. 
It gives patients more drug price trans-
parency and ensures public disclosure of drug 
costs and discounts. 
It increases low-cost options by bringing 
more generic and biosimilar competition to 
the marketplace fast. 
It caps seniors’ out-of-pocket costs for in-
sulin at $50 per month. 
It allows high deductible health insurance 
plans to cover insulin before the deductible 
kicks in. 
A new large-scale survey of 20,000 Ameri-
cans covering all 50 states and 435 Congres-
sional districts shows a majority of Ameri-
cans find health care coverage costs unrea-
sonable and a priority health care issue for 
policymakers to address today. The survey 
also shows that a majority of voters in every 
state and district oppose Medicare ‘‘negotia-
tion’’ once they learn the policy could harm 
access and innovation. 
Here are the key findings from the survey: 
A majority of Americans in every state 
and the District of Columbia oppose govern-
ment ‘‘negotiation’’ as a way to address 
health care costs if it could: 
Take away power from doctors to prescribe 
the medicines that best meet the needs of 
their patients, and instead put the govern-
ment in charge of those decisions—on aver-
age 66% oppose. 
Limit people’s access to newer prescription 
drugs—on average 64% oppose. 
Reduce access to medicines for seniors and 
people with disabilities—on average 62% op-
pose. 
Americans concerned with rising health 
care costs believe Congress should prioritize 
reducing the overall cost of coverage: 
30% of Americans, on average, are con-
cerned with out-of-pocket costs not covered 
by insurance and 29% are concerned with the 
cost of health insurance premiums. 
66% of Americans, on average, believe Con-
gress should focus on reducing the overall 
cost of health care coverage, (23% of Ameri-
cans want them to focus on prescription drug 
costs, and 13% don’t know enough to say). 
66% of Americans from all states and Con-
gressional districts, on average, find their 
out-of-pocket health care costs ‘‘unreason-
able.’’ 
Americans are clear in their opposition to 
so-called Medicare ‘‘negotiation’’ policies. 
They want Congress to focus on patient-cen-
tered solutions that address the real health 
care issues they face, like rising out-of-pock-
et costs and health insurance premiums, 
while preserving access, innovation and 
choice. Learn how at PhRMA.org/BetterWay. 
Mr. BRADY. Madam Speaker, I yield 
1 minute to the gentleman from Texas 
(Mr. GOHMERT). 
Mr. GOHMERT. Madam Speaker, this 
is the bill, 728 pages, that we got from 
the Senate this week. Has anybody 
read it? 
Come on. That is over a billion dol-
lars average per page. That ain’t gold; 
that is fool’s gold. 
Look, more IRS agents, as Art Laffer 
said years ago, that is not going to in-
crease the amount of revenue to the 
government, and, in fact, when you say 
it is going after the ultrarich, what 
happens is the ultrarich are the only 
ones that can avoid paying taxes. They 
can hire attorneys, accountants. They 
can move, change their business struc-
ture. It comes right back to the middle 
class every time. 
These same policies are the reasons 
that the average Black household in 
the 8 years of Obama lost 30 percent of 
their net worth. 
We keep hearing from the other side 
that there is this runaway inflation, 
and this ugly bill is going to stop it. 
Well, our President said it is zero per-
cent inflation. Somebody is lying. We 
will find out who. 
Mr. NEAL. I will be the first to ac-
knowledge that, Madam Speaker. I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. BRADY. Madam Speaker, on be-
half of many diabetes patients, I in-
clude the following article in the 
RECORD, which includes a quote from 
my 
fellow 
Texan, 
Representative 
LLOYD DOGGETT, where he accurately 
states that the insulin caps policy in-
cluded in this bill ‘‘does not lower the 
price of insulin by one penny,’’ but, 
rather, shifts costs to others. 
INSULIN COPAY CAP PASSES HOUSE HURDLE, 
BUT SENATE LOOKS FOR A BROADER BILL 
(By Michael McAuliff) 
The chances of passing election-year legis-
lation to help people afford insulin—which 
weeks ago seemed mired in political fight-
ing—are looking brighter as a bipartisan ef-
fort to tackle the issue takes root in the 
Senate. 
That effort is still in the early stages, but 
it is moving forward with the support of Sen-
ate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, who 
tapped Sens. Susan Collins (R-Maine) and 
Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.) to craft a com-
promise that members of both parties could 
accept. Adding pressure to the Senate’s ef-
forts was a vote by the House on March 31 to 
pass a different bill that caps out-of-pocket 
insulin costs for many patients with insur-
ance at $35 a month. 
Collins said in an interview March 30 that 
the two senators had come up with an out-
line based on a bill they worked on three 
years ago that goes beyond capping what di-
abetes patients pay and aims to bring down 
the prices drugmakers charge. 
‘‘It tackles the broader issue of the high 
list price for insulin, and the conflicts of in-
terests that occur in the chain from manu-
facturer to the consumer buying it at the 
pharmacy counter,’’ Collins said. 
The idea of reducing patients’ out-of-pock-
et insulin costs is immensely popular, and 
more than half of the public sees it as a ‘‘top 
priority’’ for Congress, according to a KFF 
poll out last week. 
It had been a key selling point of President 
Joe Biden’s Build Back Better plan, but 
when that legislation stalled, Biden and 
Schumer gave Sen. Raphael Warnock (D-Ga.) 
an open lane to promote a stand-alone meas-
ure identical to the House bill that caps in-
sulin costs at $35 a month for people with 
private insurance and Medicare coverage. 
The political climate, however, presented 
roadblocks. The odds that a bill sponsored by 
a Democrat facing a tough reelection in the 
fall could get enough Republicans in the Sen-
ate on board seemed slim, and even some 
Democrats were nervous about stripping the 
insulin provisions from a possible revised 
version of the Build Back Better bill. So 
Schumer embraced a different option from 
Collins and Shaheen that would include a 
cap on out-of-pocket costs and possibly draw 
more votes. 
Insulin prices have spiked dramatically 
since the early 2000s, with Americans paying 
10 times what people in other developed 
countries pay. 
Although Collins said details are still 
being worked out, her legislation would be 
based on the pair’s earlier bill, the Insulin 
Price Reduction Act of 2019, which aimed to 
roll insulin costs back to what they were in 
2006. It would have done that by barring re-
bate payments for insulin to pharmacy ben-
efit managers—those intermediaries who ne-
gotiate price breaks for insurance companies 
and determine which drugs the insurance 
plans cover. 
Collins and other critics of PBMs believe 
they inflate prices because they favor high-
er-priced drugs from which they can extract 
a larger rebate and therefore more profit, 
which gives drugmakers extra incentive to 
raise list prices.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H7677 
August 12, 2022 
Under that 2019 plan, drug manufacturers 
who agreed to return to 2006 costs could then 
raise prices each year only at the rate of 
medical inflation. The senators estimated 
the plan would lead to a 75 percent cut in 
prices from those listed in 2020. 
‘‘There’s a very complex system which es-
sentially encourages high list prices, because 
the pharmacy benefit managers frequently 
receive a percentage of the list price,’’ Col-
lins said. ‘‘So their incentive is to choose one 
that is higher-cost. And so we are trying to 
address that broader issue, as well as looking 
at the out-of-pocket costs.’’ 
Warnock’s proposal to cap the cost of insu-
lin is silent on list prices and benefit man-
agers, an omission some Democrats com-
plained about even as they voted for the 
similar bill in the House. They noted that 
since insurers would likely be forced to ab-
sorb the costs no longer paid by patients, the 
companies would likely raise premiums. 
‘‘This bill does not lower the price of insu-
lin by one penny,’’ said Rep. Lloyd Doggett 
(D-Texas). ‘‘It just shifts the burden of pay-
ing for the insulin off of the shoulders of in-
sured insulin users, and shifts it on to the 
rest of all of us who are paying insurance 
premiums.’’ 
Collins also noted that the uninsured 
would not benefit from the House cap, which 
applies to Medicare and insurance companies 
but doesn’t affect drugmakers’ prices. 
‘‘It doesn’t help someone who’s unin-
sured,’’ Collins said. ‘‘When you address the 
high list price, then it’s going to help more 
people.’’ 
Collins warned that much could change as 
lawmakers keep working with various stake-
holders on a final bill, including diabetes ad-
vocacy groups, the Centers for Medicare & 
Medicaid Services, and the Congressional 
Budget Office. And as caps on out-of-pocket 
expenses and list-price changes start inter-
acting, things get complicated, indeed. 
‘‘We’re talking to CBO, which says it’s so 
complex that they need a new model,’’ Col-
lins said. 
The politics also remains tricky. Collins 
and Shaheen never got their measure close 
to the Senate floor in 2019 and 2020 when Sen-
ate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell was 
majority leader. They did attract some 
praise from both sides of the aisle, and con-
servative North Dakota Republican Sen. 
Kevin Cramer was a co-sponsor. 
While that opens the door to GOP support, 
Collins said she was still only at the stage of 
circulating among her colleagues what she 
called a discussion draft. 
Republicans in the House who voted 
against the $35-cap bill panned it as a polit-
ical stunt, saying Democrats should have ad-
vanced ideas that had been worked on with 
Republicans. 
Such objections could not block the bill in 
the House. But in the Senate, Democrats 
command only 50 votes, and it would take 60 
to pass the legislation. 
Although GOP members of the upper 
chamber might also be opposed to Warnock’s 
bill, one of the House sponsors argued that 
having the House advance a dramatic cut in 
insulin costs—with the support of only a 
dozen Republicans—would raise the stakes 
for the Senate. 
‘‘If 10 Republicans stand between Ameri-
cans being able to get access to insulin or 
not, that’s a good question for 10 Republican 
[senators] to have to answer when they go 
back home,’’ Rep. Dan Kildee (D-Mich.) said 
ahead of the House vote. ‘‘So we’re gonna 
pass this bill, and this will put the pressure 
on the Senate to act.’’ 
He and his fellow Democratic co-sponsors 
also signaled their willingness to take a 
measure that included the Shaheen and Col-
lins additions. 
‘‘Any train that’s leaving the station that 
gets folks affordable insulin—I’m open to 
any vehicle,’’ Kildee said. ‘‘We think this is 
a solution that would work. How it gets to 
the president’s desk, I’m agnostic on that 
question. Any way we can get it there.’’ 
Mr. BRADY. Madam Speaker, I yield 
1 minute to the gentleman from Ohio 
(Mr. JORDAN). 
Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, who 
are they going to harass? Who are 
these thousands of IRS bureaucrats, 
leftwing bureaucrats, Lois Lerners at 
the IRS, who are they going to harass? 
Middle-class families. 
We know who it is going to be. It is 
that assistant football coach at the 
local high school who teaches history 
and who has this side business. He 
mows lawns in the summer. He paints 
houses in the summer. He pays his 
taxes, but he is going to get harassed. 
We know how this works. We have 
seen it before. 
This bill raises taxes. It creates a 
whole new bureaucracy to go after tax-
payers. Such a deal, using your tax 
money to come after you, the taxpayer. 
Such a deal for the taxpayer. 
My guess is they will all be working 
remotely. They won’t have to pay the 
$5 to drive to work like people in our 
districts do. They will be working re-
motely, drinking their fancy coffee, 
going after the guy who is helping kids 
and has this side business in the sum-
mer. That is who this is going to come 
after, and we all know it. Everyone 
knows it. The country knows it. 
This is disgusting. I hope y’all vote 
‘‘no.’’ 
Mr. NEAL. Madam Speaker, I con-
tinue to reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. BRADY. Madam Speaker, on be-
half of seniors who rely on generic 
drugs, I include in the RECORD the fol-
lowing letter from generic and bio-
similar manufacturers, which explains 
the price controls in this Democrat bill 
will reduce competition from lower- 
cost generic and biosimilar medicines. 
That means fewer options for patients 
and worsening drug shortages. 
THE BIOSIMILARS COUNCIL, 
Washington, DC, July 11, 2022. 
Hon. CHARLES E. SCHUMER, 
Majority Leader, U.S. Senate, 
Washington, DC. 
DEAR LEADER SCHUMER: The Association 
for Accessible Medicines (AAM) and its 
Biosimilars Council share in the goal of low-
ering prescription drug costs for America’s 
patients and seniors. However, in an effort to 
target high prices on brand-name drugs, the 
proposed prescription drugs reforms—in par-
ticular the Medicare negotiations frame-
work—being considered as part of a revised 
reconciliation package will reduce patient 
savings from lower-cost generic and bio-
similar medicines. Even though competition 
from generic and biosimilar medicines is the 
only proven solution to consistently lower 
the cost of prescription drugs, the proposed 
price setting scheme will reduce competi-
tion, harm future savings from generic and 
biosimilar medicines, and increase costs for 
employers and patients with private insur-
ance. We thus urge all U.S. Senators to op-
pose the prescription drug reforms under 
consideration as part of a revised Build Back 
Better reconciliation package. 
America’s patients rightfully expect Con-
gress to address the ever-increasing prices of 
brandname prescription drugs. High launch 
prices on new brand biologics, combined with 
an increasing trend of anti-competitive pat-
ent and rebate ploys designed to delay or 
prevent competition from more affordable 
biosimilars and generics, are keeping access 
to medicines out of reach for too many pa-
tients. These dynamics are compounded by 
flawed policies that reward health plans and 
pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) for the 
use of high-cost, high-rebate brand drugs and 
that allow plans and PBMs to raise out-of- 
pocket costs for generics, even as the prices 
for those same generics are falling. As a re-
sult, patients, including Medicare’s seniors, 
are missing out on billions of dollars in sav-
ings from biosimilars and generic drugs each 
year. However, the proposed price setting ap-
proach fails to adequately address these 
challenges, while dampening future competi-
tion and reducing savings from generic and 
biosimilar medicines. 
NEGOTIATIONS FRAMEWORK INCREASES UNCER-
TAINTY FOR GENERIC AND BIOSIMILAR DEVEL-
OPERS 
The proposal increases the risks associated 
with developing generic and biosimilars 
without addressing the fundamental barriers 
to competition from lower-cost medicines, 
such as abuses of the patent system and 
brand rebate traps. The proposed timelines 
for when the Secretary can initiate the price 
setting process will significantly increase 
the risk to develop new lower-cost generics 
and biosimilars. Although the proposal ex-
empts drugs with generic or biosimilar com-
petition from the price setting process, the 
bill 
only 
does 
so 
through 
unrealistic 
timelines for that competition to enter the 
market. For many complex generics and 
biosimilars, it can take 8–10 years to develop 
new, more affordable medicines. And it can 
take many more years to conclude patent 
litigation and then launch a complex generic 
or biosimilar medicine. But the new price 
setting process would not begin until years 
after a developer commits to developing a 
lower-cost generic or biosimilar. This means 
that generic and biosimilar manufacturers 
will have no way to know whether a brand- 
name drug will be selected for negotiation or 
what the negotiated price may be. This dy-
namic fundamentally changes the ability of 
generic and biosimilar manufacturers to 
plan and make investment decisions that can 
be up to and exceed $250 million per drug. 
While the revised bill includes a provision 
that could allow for a temporary delay of the 
negotiated price if the Secretary determines 
a biosimilar launch was imminent, there are 
a number of limitations on the provision 
make it difficult to utilize. By way of exam-
ple, a biosimilar developer would need to 
show a ‘‘high likelihood’’ of biosimilar com-
petition by a ‘‘clear and convincing’’ evi-
dentiary standard. Moreover, the narrow 
two-year window to launch does not appro-
priately account for how long it takes devel-
opers to challenge brand-name patents. 
Large patent estates and time-consuming 
patent litigation are currently and will con-
tinue to prevent biosimilars from being able 
to launch within two years of receiving FDA 
approval. These dynamics will likely deter 
manufacturers from making investments in 
biosimilar and generic medicines in some in-
stances—and will result in less competition 
and ultimately higher costs for patients.

biosimilars are expected to launch for a 
range of treatments for patients with diabe-
tes, arthritis, macular degeneration, oncol-
ogy and more. In the next few years, 42 
biosimilars are on track to launch. Gold- 
standard data firm IQVIA estimates bio-
similar savings of $30 billion annually as a 
result. In comparison, the Congressional 
Budget Office estimates the negotiations 
framework saves $18–24 billion per year from 
2028 to 2031. Thus, more savings is projected 
from market-based competition than from 
the Build Back Better proposal and it starts 
now. In addition, as more complex generics, 
biosimilars, and interchangeable biologics 
become available, there is the potential for 
even greater savings to the U.S. health care 
system as providers and payers take advan-
tage of the opportunities to increase access 
and reduce costs for patients. 
NEGOTIATIONS
FRAMEWORK
INCREASES
COSTS 
ON EMPLOYERS AND PATIENTS WITH PRIVATE 
COVERAGE 
Reduced competition from generic and bio-
similar medicines impacts all patients, not 
only Medicare beneficiaries. The dampening 
effect this legislation would have on com-
petition would cause employers and patients 
with private insurance to lose savings these 
populations have historically enjoyed from 
robust generic competition and growing bio-
similar competition. Instead, there may be 
fewer new, more affordable generic and bio-
similar medicines, leaving the commercial 
and employer markets captive to the high 
cost of brand-name drugs. 
When reviewing a nearly identical proposal 
in the House-passed Build Back Better Act, 
AAM’s Biosimilars Council assessed the po-
tential lost savings to the commercial mar-
ket for medicines used to treat asthma 
(Xolair) and rheumatoid arthritis (Orencia), 
as examples. For just two products, lost sav-
ings would be between $4-$7 billion between 
2027–2030. This is lost savings that would oth-
erwise be used to lower patient out of pocket 
costs and reduce insurance premiums for em-
ployers and employees. 
For these reasons, we must oppose the 
Medicare negotiations framework and its im-
pact on patient access to lower-cost medi-
cines. There are other bipartisan steps to ad-
dress patent abuse and brand rebate traps 
that are already under discussion in Con-
gress that can meaningfully reduce drugs 
costs without harming generic and bio-
similar savings. We strongly encourage Con-
gress to reconsider its approach. 
Sincerely, 
DAN LEONARD, 
President and CEO. 
Mr. BRADY. Madam Speaker, I yield 
1 minute to the gentleman from Ten-
nessee (Mr. BURCHETT). 
Mr. BURCHETT. Madam Speaker, 
following JIM JORDAN is like why no-
body wanted to follow Jimi Hendrix at 
Woodstock. It is going to be tough. 
But you never reduce burdens or in-
flation by increasing taxes $740 billion. 
It is estimated that there is a $4,500 in-
crease on the average family under this 
proposal. Instead, you simply create 
more government that never goes 
away. 
This is not an inflation reduction 
act. It is a woke climate bill that will 
increase inflation, Madam Speaker. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
my 
Democrat 
friends seem to have forgotten that 
capitalism is not the enemy; we are. 
I would also remind my colleagues 
across the aisle that, in Tennessee, we 
reduced taxes and regulations, and now 
we have record surpluses. Individuals 
and businesses are moving from your 
district to mine as fast as they can get 
there. 
Madam Speaker, the ranking mem-
ber, who I call chairman, will be in-
credibly missed here in these Halls, but 
also more so out on the baseball field. 
Mr. NEAL. Madam Speaker, I am 
prepared to close. I reserve the balance 
of my time. 
Mr. BRADY. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself the balance of my time. 
I include in the RECORD the following 
list of 586 credible voices of opposition 
to this bill. They include business lead-
ers, taxpayer advocates, economists, 
and thought leaders who all say this

Mr. BRADY. I include in the RECORD 
the following letter from dozens of 
Main Street businesses opposing the 
Democrats’ bill because of the IRS’ tar-
geting of their business under the bill 
and tax hikes on small businesses. 
August 11, 2022. 
Hon. NANCY PELOSI, 
Speaker of the House, 
House of Representatives, 
Washington, DC. 
Hon. KEVIN MCCARTHY, 
House Minority Leader, House of Representa-
tives, 
Washington, DC. 
Hon. CHARLES SCHUMER, 
Senate Majority Leader, U.S. Senate, 
Washington, DC. 
Hon. MITCH MCCONNELL, 
Senate Minority Leader, U.S. Senate, 
Washington, DC. 
DEAR SPEAKER PELOSI, LEADER MCCARTHY, 
LEADER SCHUMER, AND LEADER MCCONNELL: 
The 
undersigned 
organizations 
represent 
millions of Main Street businesses and em-
ploy tens of millions of workers and we op-
pose the Senate-passed Inflation Reduction 
Act. 
Inflation is at 40-year highs, we have had 
two consecutive quarters of negative eco-
nomic growth, and we are witnessing a 
shrinking small business sector, yet the In-
flation Reduction Act does nothing to ad-
dress these immediate issues even as it in-
creases the burden of the tax code shouldered 
by America’s small and family-owned busi-
nesses. 
The Biden Administration claims the sav-
ings in the IRA are ‘‘front-loaded’’ and will 
reduce the deficit in the short-term, helping 
to ease inflationary pressures. That is sim-
ply not the case. Recent analysis by the Con-
gressional Budget Office, Penn-Wharton, and 
others shows the Inflation Reduction Act 
would increase prices in the short term and 
do little to bring them down in the long run. 
At the same time, the bill would give the 
IRS an additional $80 billion in funding, 
more than half of which would pay for thou-
sands of additional IRS agents to conduct 
millions of additional audits. We support ad-
dressing the tax gap and oppose illegal tax 
evasion, but as former National Taxpayer 
Advocate Nina Olson observed recently, it is 
wrong and counterproductive to characterize 
the entire tax gap as willful tax evasion. 
From experience, we know many, if not 
most, of these additional audits will be con-
ducted on the owners of family businesses 
who have fully complied with the tax code. 
Finally, the Warner Amendment adopted 
at the last minute presented the Senate with 
a clear choice between Wall Street and Main 
Street, and the Senate chose Wall Street. 
The amendment extends for two years the 
Section 461(l) cap on losses a business owner 
is permitted to claim. This $52 billion tax 
hike on pass-through businesses was adopted 
with almost no consideration, and the reve-
nues it raises were used to offset the cost of 
exempting private equity investors from the 
fifteen-percent corporate minimum tax. The 
cap on active pass-through less deductions is 
bad policy at any time, but it is particularly 
harmful when the economy is weak and an 
increasing number of businesses are suffering 
losses. The timing of this amendment’s adop-
tion could not have been worse. 
The Inflation Reduction Act would fail to 
reduce price pressures even as it raises the 
cost of the tax code to small and family-

Mr. BRADY. Madam Speaker, a year 
ago, we met to consider another disas-
trous version of this bill. Since then, 
American families and Main Street 
businesses have been facing and con-
tinue to face historic inflation and, 
now, a recession. 
This bill is a hoax on the American 
people. Americans who are suffering 
the most in President Biden’s cruel 
economy will soon know this firsthand. 
They will know it because inflation 
will get worse, according to the Penn 
Wharton School of Business analysis. 
Parents sitting up at night will no-
tice higher taxes, fewer jobs, and lower 
wages as they pay for the vast major-
ity of any new revenue collected under 
this bill, according to Congress’ own 
nonpartisan scorekeeper. 
A middle-income single mom with 
two kids who runs her own business 
will know it when she comes home 
from Walmart and finds a letter from 
the IRS telling her she is under audit. 
Seniors and loved ones with life- 
threatening illnesses will arrive at the 
pharmacy counter and break into a 
sweat when they see they cannot afford 
their medicine. 
Families with loved ones newly diag-
nosed with Alzheimer’s, or cancer, or 
ALS, and desperately seeking treat-
ment will wonder whether the cure for 
their disease will ever come. 
The wealthiest and the biggest for-
eign-owned corporations will do just

fine. They are getting hundreds of bil-
lions of dollars of government hand-
outs under this bill. After all, they get 
the government checks paid for by the 
middle-class taxpayers who are getting 
squeezed. 
This is a sad day for struggling 
American families and Main Street 
businesses. 
This 
economy 
is 
cruel 
enough, but by voting to turn this hoax 
into law, Congress is inflicting one 
more act of cruelty. 
Madam Speaker, I urge opposition to 
this bill, and I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
Mr. NEAL. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself the balance of my time. 
This is a big day, and this is a big 
deal. We are putting people out front 
and making good on the promises we 
have made, lowering drug prices and 
investing in our climate. 
A mountain-high pile of legislative 
achievements have we: the American 
Rescue Plan, the CHIPS and Science 
Act, and now this achievement for the 
American people. 
Lyndon Johnson was right: ‘‘Yester-
day is not ours to recover, but tomor-
row is ours to win or lose.’’ 
With the Inflation Reduction Act 
headed to the President’s desk—and 
give Joe Biden credit—we stand here 
assured that tomorrow is ours to win. 
We have had bold dreams in this Con-
gress, and we have delivered big on 
those dreams. None of this would have 
been possible without the dedication 
and expertise of the staff of the Ways 
and Means Committee, the best in the 
business. They have worked nonstop 
for 2 years for the American people, 
and today, their hard work is on dis-
play for the world to witness and await 
the President’s signature. 
The Inflation Reduction Act sets our 
Nation on a healthier, fairer, and more 
prosperous path. 
Madam Speaker, I urge our col-
leagues to support this critical legisla-
tion, and I yield back the balance of 
my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from New Jersey (Mr. PALLONE) 
and the gentleman from Kentucky (Mr. 
GUTHRIE) will each control 30 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from New Jersey. 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself 3 minutes. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in strong sup-
port of H.R. 5376, the Inflation Reduc-
tion Act. This is landmark legislation 
that is going to help reduce costs for 
American families while finally aggres-
sively tackling the climate crisis. 
Madam Speaker, we simply cannot 
wait any longer to confront the cli-
mate crisis. Extreme weather events 
are becoming more frequent and more 
extreme. There are record-high tem-
peratures across the Nation this sum-
mer. These extreme weather events 
cost families their loved ones, their 
homes, and their livelihoods. 
This bill is the single largest invest-
ment in climate action in American 
history. We heard from the Ways and 
Means Committee about the tax cred-
its, the investment production tax 
credits for renewables, for electric ve-
hicles. I want to talk about the provi-
sions from the Energy and Commerce 
Committee. 
The bill makes unparalleled invest-
ments in climate, clean energy, and en-
vironmental justice so that we can 
slash climate pollution and meet our 
aggressive climate goals. 
I want to highlight some of the 
things: a methane emissions reduction 
program, a greenhouse gas reduction 
fund to promote new green technology, 
investing in manufacturing that is 
green, reducing industrial emissions; a 
program for States and government en-
tities to reduce climate pollution, a 
program for clean heavy-duty vehicles 
for trucks and school buses to make 
them less polluting, an appliance and 
building efficiency rebate to try to deal 
with emissions from buildings and ap-
pliances, an industrial emissions reduc-
tion program; environmental and cli-
mate justice block grants, and also 
provisions to deal with ports that are a 
major source of pollution. 
All of these are designed, basically, 
to try to create clean jobs and to re-
duce energy costs for the average fam-
ily. We estimate it at about $1,800 a 
year. It is estimated that this bill will 
actually reduce the pollution of green-
house gases into the climate by 40 per-
cent, in terms of what the U.S. has 
emitted since 2005. 
It goes very far toward achieving our 
goals as a Nation, toward reducing the 
problem of greenhouse gas emissions. 
b 1430 
In addition to that, the Inflation Re-
duction Act is also one of the most sig-
nificant pieces of healthcare legisla-
tion moved through Congress in over a 
decade. I want to stress this: It breaks 
Big Pharma’s monopoly on prescrip-
tion drug prices. 
The bill will lower prescription drug 
costs for seniors by finally empowering 
Medicare to negotiate the cost of pre-
scription 
drugs. 
It 
also 
caps 
the 
amount that seniors pay at $2,000 annu-
ally, caps the cost of insulin at $35 a 
month, and penalizes companies that 
unfairly hike prices by forcing them to 
pay a rebate to the Federal Govern-
ment if their prices rise more than in-
flation. 
This legislation is necessary because, 
nearly 20 years ago, Republicans pre-
vented the Federal Government from 
negotiating prices for seniors. So, 
today, we are finally leveling the play-
ing field to ensure seniors are no longer 
forced to choose between putting food 
on their tables and their life savings. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentleman has expired. 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself an additional 30 seconds. 
Finally, I want to say that this legis-
lation will also dramatically lower the 
cost of healthcare for millions of 
Americans by extending enhanced Af-
fordable Care Act marketplace pre-
mium subsidies. 
These enhanced subsidies are making 
a real difference for families, delivering 
an average savings of $2,400 a year for 
a family of four. They are set to expire 
at the end of the year, but this bill ex-
tends them through the end of 2025. 
Madam Speaker, this legislation lays 
the foundation for a cleaner, more 
prosperous future for all Americans. I 
urge my colleagues to support it, and I 
reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. GUTHRIE. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself 5 minutes. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today in 
strong opposition to H.R. 5376, the mis-
labeled Inflation Reduction Act. 
This is another reckless tax and 
spending spree that is not being accu-
rately portrayed to the American peo-
ple by Democrats. 
Washington Democrats are trying to 
convince Americans that adding more 
reckless government spending and rais-
ing taxes during a recession will com-
bat inflation. Even nonpartisan organi-
zations say this bill will have virtually 
no impact on inflation and at least half 
of the expected tax revenue for next 
year is estimated to come from Ameri-
cans making less than $400,000 a year. 
Americans will see more IRS audits 
because this bill gives the IRS the abil-
ity to hire an army of new IRS agents. 
People should pay the taxes they owe, 
but instead of an army of IRS agents 
focusing on auditing low- to middle-in-
come Americans, we need to put our re-
sources into hiring more Border Patrol 
officers to protect the border and stop 
the flow of illicit drugs such as 
fentanyl. 
More troubling parts of this bill are 
the healthcare provisions. I strongly 
disagree with using Medicare money to 
pay for ObamaCare subsidies for the 
wealthy. I introduced an amendment to 
keep Medicare savings in Medicare, 
which is already at risk of insolvency 
in the very near future. Unfortunately, 
House Democrats didn’t even give this 
amendment a chance to be considered. 
While Democrats praise government 
price setting, or, as they call it, nego-
tiation, they fail to mention that such 
policies would lead to at least 15 fewer 
drugs coming to market, according to 
the nonpartisan Congressional Budget 
Office. 
What are the 15 cures? Could it be the 
cure for Alzheimer’s? Could it be the 
cure for diabetes? It could be. 
They also won’t mention that the 
nonpartisan CBO said this bill will lead 
to higher prices on new drugs. 
Finally, Democrats are voting to give 
Secretary Becerra a $3 billion slush 
fund to set drug prices, despite HHS 
botching the response to the COVID–19 
pandemic, including politicizing guid-
ance that kept schools closed and 
young children masked in Head Start 
programs. 
How can anyone support giving bil-
lions of dollars in more unrestricted 
authority to HHS that we know will 
lead to fewer cures for our loved ones? 
Let me be clear: We absolutely need 
to address the cost of prescription

medication. In the Energy and Com-
merce Committee, there is a bipartisan 
bill ready to go, H.R. 19, that could 
achieve this, but the Democrats have 
repeatedly refused to bring the bill to 
the floor for a vote. 
Our country is also facing an energy 
crisis created by President Biden and 
Washington Democrats’ war on Amer-
ican energy. Despite this, the Demo-
crats’ solution is to double down on the 
nearly $400 billion to be spent on far- 
left Green New Deal policies and im-
pose billions of dollars of tax increases 
on energy that will be passed to con-
sumers. 
Unbelievably, even as energy prices 
are at historically high levels, they 
have included a new tax on natural gas 
and revived a tax on petroleum prod-
ucts that will cost consumers tens of 
billions of dollars. 
I filed an amendment to exempt our 
defense bases from this natural gas tax, 
but again, Democrats refused even to 
consider it. 
Democrats want to create a $27 bil-
lion slush fund at the EPA for a na-
tional climate bank to subsidize the 
solar energy that is heavily dominated 
by the Chinese Communist Party and 
even spend $9 billion in rebates for 
wealthy Americans to green up their 
homes with new appliances and electric 
vehicles. 
To conclude, this legislation not only 
crushes hope for patients and their 
families living with devastating dis-
eases that currently lack a treatment 
or a cure, but it also significantly un-
dermines our economic and national 
security. 
I cannot vote for the more appro-
priately named inflation expansion act. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues 
to join me in opposing it, and I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 11⁄2 minutes to the gentlewoman 
from Delaware (Ms. BLUNT ROCHESTER), 
my neighbor from the State of Dela-
ware and a member of the Committee 
on Energy and Commerce. 
Ms. BLUNT ROCHESTER. Madam 
Speaker, today, I rise in support of the 
Inflation Reduction Act. 
Oh, what a day in America. From 
lowering prescription drug prices for 
seniors, to closing tax loopholes on the 
wealthiest corporations, to making the 
largest investment in clean energy in 
history to tackle the climate crisis, the 
Inflation Reduction Act will help im-
prove the lives of every single Amer-
ican. It will do it all while paying down 
the deficit. 
I am particularly proud that the bill 
includes my climate smart ports provi-
sions 
with 
my 
colleague, 
Ms. 
BARRAGA´ N, 
which 
invests 
in 
ports 
across the Nation, like the Port of Wil-
mington, allowing them to upgrade 
their facilities, lower their carbon foot-
print, and create more good-paying 
union jobs. 
Madam Speaker, in a session of Con-
gress that has already seen remarkable 
landmark legislation passed, the Infla-
tion Reduction Act is the capstone of 
our efforts to deliver. With this bill, we 
continue to put people over politics. 
Mr. GUTHRIE. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from 
Michigan (Mr. UPTON), the chair emer-
itus of the Committee on Energy and 
Commerce, who is retiring. We are 
going to miss him. 
Mr. UPTON. Madam Speaker, does 
anyone actually believe this bill is 
going to reduce inflation? 
I didn’t think so. 
Those of you that know me know 
that I am not afraid to work across the 
aisle on important legislation that 
helps Americans, whether it was the 
21st Century Cures Act, the CHIPS Act, 
the veterans’ PACT Act, or the infra-
structure bill. Unfortunately, the bill 
that we are debating right now was not 
created in that same bipartisan man-
ner. 
Our economy is in a fragile state as 
we emerge from this pandemic. We 
have seen decades-high inflation that is 
crushing Main Street and squeezing the 
middle class. Now is not the time to 
raise taxes to the tune of over $16 bil-
lion on middle-income folks around the 
country. 
The Inflation Reduction Act does 
nothing to fix the insidious problems 
at the IRS. Instead, they are going to 
throw more than $80 billion to hire 
more agents who are going to be tasked 
with hounding taxpayers who report 
passthrough business income through 
Schedule C and Schedule E. These folks 
are, by and large, middle-income, fam-
ily-owned small business owners who 
busted their butts to keep their doors 
open through the pandemic, and now 
we are sending the cavalry after them, 
leading to higher compliance costs and 
time wasted that will increase costs for 
all Americans. 
The IRS needs to be focused on clear-
ing the backlog of millions of personal 
and business returns. I have literally 
helped hundreds of constituents who 
have been waiting 1 to 2 years for their 
tax refunds. 
With respect to inflation, a number 
of nonpartisan sources, including some 
previously touted by supporters of this 
bill, have said that this bill will cause 
inflation to increase over the first cou-
ple of years. 
The energy sector has seen the brunt 
of this increase, with gas prices climb-
ing more than $2.30 a gallon and nat-
ural gas prices going up close to dou-
ble. 
On Wednesday, I offered an amend-
ment at the Committee on Rules that 
would direct the bill not to go into ef-
fect until the Secretary of Energy can 
certify that energy prices are below the 
costs of 2021. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues 
to vote ‘‘no.’’ 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentleman from 
Illinois (Mr. CASTEN). 
Mr. CASTEN. Madam Speaker, last 
November, our House delegation went 
to Glasgow for the COP26 conference. 
We told the world that we were back, 
that we had rejoined the Paris climate 
accord, and that we were committed to 
building back better and committed to 
putting science over politics. It felt 
pretty good. 
But to be blunt, the world didn’t be-
lieve us. As we sat at that press con-
ference, all of these reporters from Eu-
rope said: What about the Senate? 
What about the filibuster? What if Re-
publicans take over in the midterms? 
They had heard this song before. 
They admired our enthusiasm, but as 
you know, Madam Speaker, they really 
didn’t share it. 
Today, we are going to prove them 
wrong. We are going to remind them 
what the United States is capable of. 
We 
are 
about 
to 
pass 
the 
most 
impactful climate bill ever. You all 
should be proud of that. You were here 
to share this moment with us. We are 
on the path to reducing CO2 emissions 
by 40 percent by 2030. That is a really 
big deal. 
But it is only a start because 40 per-
cent ain’t enough. We have reestab-
lished U.S. credibility today, but we 
still have to establish U.S. leadership. 
The measure of our success is not what 
we pass today; it is whether the planet 
is cooler tomorrow. 
Today, we remind the world and our-
selves what we are capable of. I hope 
we celebrate. But tomorrow, let’s get 
back to work. 
Mr. GUTHRIE. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 11⁄2
minutes to the gentleman 
from California (Mr. RUIZ), a member 
of the Committee on Energy and Com-
merce. 
Mr. RUIZ. Madam Speaker, as a doc-
tor, I have taken care of many patients 
who put their lives and health at risk 
because they couldn’t afford their 
medication, patients who either ration 
their medicine or didn’t get a prescrip-
tion filled at all. 
I will never forget one woman who 
was so proud to tell me that she was 
able to make her insulin last longer be-
cause she would only take half a dose 
at a time in order to make it last. This 
is unacceptable. 
No one should have to choose be-
tween whether to take their medicine 
and put food on their table or between 
their health and not being able to pay 
their bills. 
That is why I support the Inflation 
Reduction Act, which will give seniors 
the relief that they need from sky-
rocketing drug costs. It ensures that 
people on Medicare with diabetes won’t 
have to pay more than $35 a month for 
their insulin. It requires the Secretary 
of HHS to negotiate drug prices for ex-
pensive Medicare drugs, lowering costs 
for seniors and people with disabilities, 
and it caps out-of-pocket spending at 
$2,000 per year for Medicare part D. 
These important steps will help en-
sure that all seniors have access to life-
saving and health-saving medications, 
regardless of how much money they 
have.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H7682 
August 12, 2022 
That is not all this bill does. This bill 
will make transformational invest-
ments to combat climate change and 
reduce our carbon emissions. It will 
push automakers to make their elec-
tric vehicle batteries with domestic 
materials, like the lithium we are ex-
tracting at the southern end of the 
Salton Sea in Imperial County. 
With this bill and the lithium in my 
district, we can power our clean energy 
future here in America with American 
materials. 
Mr. GUTHRIE. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from 
Texas (Mr. BURGESS), my good friend 
on the Committee on Energy and Com-
merce. 
Mr. BURGESS. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman from Kentucky 
for yielding. 
Madam Speaker, I include in the 
RECORD a letter submitted by the mem-
bers of the House GOP Doctors Caucus. 
CONGRESS OF THE UNITED STATES, 
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, 
Washington, DC, August 6, 2022. 
Hon. CHUCK SCHUMER, 
Majority Leader, U.S. Senate, 
Washington, DC. 
Hon. NANCY PELOSI, 
Speaker of the House, House of Representatives, 
Washington, DC. 
DEAR
LEADER
SCHUMER
AND
SPEAKER 
PELOSI: We write to express our strong oppo-
sition to the government drug price control 
policies in your reconciliation package. As 
medical providers and Members of Congress, 
we are deeply concerned with the harm these 
provisions will cause to patients across the 
country. 
The GOP Doctors Caucus has continuously 
worked to ensure that physician practices 
can stay open to continue treating patients. 
We have heard directly from providers that 
the cuts proposed in this bill will jeopardize 
patient access to care. According to Avalere, 
changes to the Medicare Part B physician- 
administered 
drug 
reimbursement 
would 
lead to an average cut of 39.8 percent for 
health care providers. The confluence of 
these cuts, including the 0 percent payment 
update, the reduction of the 4.5 percent 
Medicare conversion factor, and the adoption 
of several changes to the Evaluation and 
Management (E/M) Current Procedural Ter-
minology codes, threatens the sustainability 
of medical practices and will lead to physi-
cians closing their doors. 
It is irresponsible to divert seniors’ Medi-
care dollars to pay subsidies to non-Medicare 
insurance companies, yet this plan would do 
just that. The proposal will take ‘‘savings’’ 
from the drug price controls in the Medicare 
program to pay for expanded health insur-
ance subsidies under the Affordable Care Act 
(ACA). This is money going to insurance 
companies and their bottom line; this is not 
money going directly towards care in any 
way. These expanded subsidies were origi-
nally part of the inflation-creating American 
Rescue Plan Act (ARPA). ARPA removed the 
income cap restricting access to premium 
tax credits, opening the door to taxpayer- 
funded subsidies for some of the wealthiest 
Americans. Some families making more than 
$500,000 annually now have access to ex-
panded ACA subsidies, and they will con-
tinue to if this proposal goes through. Rob-
bing Medicare to enhance the profit for in-
surance company shareholders and execu-
tives does nothing to improve anyone’s 
health. To us, this is unconscionable. 
If this plan is passed into law, millions of 
patients could die waiting for new drugs and 
cures that will no longer be developed in 
their lifetime. Government price controls 
have consequences. The Congressional Budg-
et Office has conservatively estimated that 
15 fewer drugs will be developed over the 
next 30 years under this bill, Another study 
found that only six out of 11 currently ap-
proved therapies would have been brought to 
the market if this framework were in place. 
Any cure lost is one too many. As Members 
of Congress who have been involved in pa-
tient care, we understand the real-world im-
pact that this will have on patients. Many of 
us have treated patients with chronic and 
life-threatening diseases. We’ve seen expen-
sive surgeries and intensive inpatient care be 
eliminated by the development of new thera-
pies. This development and innovation will 
all but go away, leaving patients without 
hope for improved quality of life and long- 
term savings. 
We remain concerned that this proposal 
will also put the government in control of 
Americans’ medical decisions. This is an-
other clear example of a policy crafted by 
politicians who have never seen a patient. 
The bill calls for a 95 percent excise tax if 
drug companies do not accept the price gov-
ernment bureaucrats put in place. Top down, 
‘‘take it or leave it’’ government price nego-
tiation isn’t a negotiation at all—it’s gov-
ernment price fixing. 
This reconciliation package under consid-
eration applies upward pressure on drug pric-
ing. The bill subjects a company to negotia-
tion once its seven-year exclusivity expires. 
As a result, companies could introduce drugs 
into the marketplace with high list prices, 
causing premium increases for healthier in-
dividuals enrolled in employer-sponsored 
plans. 
In summary, this reconciliation package 
will have grave consequences for patients 
and patient care: 
This price setting scheme put forth in this 
bill will endanger patient access to care by 
cutting provider reimbursement on impacted 
Part B drugs by an average of forty percent. 
The bill does nothing to address other on-
going Medicare provider payment cuts set to 
begin in 2023. 
If this plan is passed into law, millions of 
patients could die waiting for new drugs and 
cures that will no longer be developed in 
their lifetime. 
Government 
price 
controls 
have 
con-
sequences, and one lost cure is one too many. 
This plan robs Medicare to pay subsidies to 
insurance companies and other non-health 
related expenditures. 
As medical providers in Congress, we urge 
you to recognize the danger this proposal 
will have on patients. We can and should 
work on a bipartisan basis to lower drug 
costs without sacrificing the cures and treat-
ments that will provide for a healthier fu-
ture.

Mr. BURGESS. Madam Speaker, this 
is a letter that explains how healthcare 
policies included in the Inflation Re-
duction Act would affect American pa-
tients. There are 21 healthcare profes-
sionals who signed this letter. 
It is remarkable that none of our 
concerns were considered—all were ig-
nored—not only as Members of the 
House and Senate but as healthcare 
professionals, as well. 
The point of the letter is that this 
legislation will do the exact opposite of 
what the Democrats intend. Unfortu-
nately, the legislation will kill re-
search and development, reduce qual-
ity of care, and threaten patient access 
to lifesaving drugs. 
Under this legislation, we are going 
to see changes to part B drug reim-
bursements that will lead to an aver-
age of a 40 percent cut for healthcare 
providers, doctors who provide care to 
Medicare patients in their offices. 
Currently, part B reimbursements for 
administering drugs in a physician’s of-
fice are a calculation based on the av-
erage sales price plus 6 percent. Under 
this new system, part B payments to 
physicians are going to be calculated 
off of the maximum fair price. It is an 
attractive term, but no one knows 
what it means. It is yet to be deter-
mined by whom? The Secretary of 
Health and Human Services. We have 
all seen how trustworthy they have 
been over the past 2 years. 
The current 6 percent average sales 
price add-on payments to physicians, 
which is what doctors have come to 
rely on now to run their practices, will 
be based on a significantly lower gov-
ernment-set price versus the tradi-
tional market-priced ASP. This results 
in significantly lower payments to phy-
sicians. 
Now, Wednesday afternoon late, at 
the Committee on Rules, I offered an 
amendment with Dr. MURPHY to fix 
this problem. Unfortunately, that was 
rejected on a party-line vote. 
These payment cuts threaten the sus-
tainability of medical practices and 
will lead—let me say that again—will 
lead to physicians closing their doors. 
When practices close, the patient need 
does not disappear. Care will then shift 
to hospitals. 
b 1445 
This will ultimately lead to an in-
crease in healthcare costs and a de-
crease in the quality of care provided, 
and it will limit access to treatments 
for patients across the country. 
From experience working in private 
practice, I can attest that there are 
significant consequences of consolida-
tion. Here is the bottom line: Demo-
crats are using Medicare as a piggy 
bank to pay for other things. What

other things? Oh, like subsidies to in-
surance companies. They want to re-
ward insurance companies and punish 
doctors. It makes no sense. 
This legislation will do the exact op-
posite of what Democrats intend. It is 
going to kill research and develop-
ment. It is going to reduce the quality 
of care. It is going to threaten patient 
access to lifesaving drugs. 
As the most senior doctor in Con-
gress and someone who deeply cares 
about the well-being of American pa-
tients, this bill is antidoctor and 
antipatient. We will live to see the con-
sequences of this after final passage, I 
promise you that. 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 11⁄2
minutes to the gentleman 
from Florida (Mr. SOTO), another mem-
ber of the Energy and Commerce Com-
mittee. 
Mr. SOTO. Madam Speaker, we have 
been elected to Congress to solve the 
greatest challenges of our time, and 
today, we are doing just that. 
We are taking action to combat cli-
mate change. 
We are taking action to lower drug 
prices for seniors with a $2,000 cap on 
out-of-pocket expenses. 
We 
are 
taking 
action 
to 
keep 
ObamaCare affordable for millions of 
Floridians. 
We are taking action by increasing 
vaccine access with our HAPPY Act. 
We are doing it all while reducing the 
deficit by over $300 billion over the 
next 10 years. 
We are lowering costs; we are fight-
ing inflation; and we are saving the 
planet. This is the largest investment 
to resolve the climate crisis in our Na-
tion’s history. It will reduce carbon 
emissions by 40 percent by 2030. 
When generations look back years 
from now, they will read that this was 
a turning point. How many more cat-
egory 5 hurricanes, how many more 
massive wildfires, deadly floods, dried- 
up rivers, and record heat waves do you 
need? 
How many more seniors have to get 
sick or die because they can’t afford 
their medication? 
How many more families have to be 
kicked off their health insurance? 
How much longer before you all get 
it? 
We are not waiting any longer. The 
Republicans’ plan is to do nothing. In 
contrast, we in the Democratic major-
ity will lead. Today, we will act. 
Today, we will do what is necessary to 
protect this generation and the next. 
Mr. GUTHRIE. Madam Speaker, I in-
clude in the RECORD an editorial from 
The Wall Street Journal titled, ‘‘Tilt-
ing at Climate Windmills,’’ which 
notes that the massive spending bill re-
duces global temperatures at the most 
by 0.28 degrees. 
[From the Wall Street Journal] 
TILTING AT CLIMATE WINDMILLS 
SHUMER-MANCHIN WILL HAVE LITTLE EFFECT ON 
THE WORLD’S TEMPERATURE 
(By Editorial Board) 
Nearly all of Washington—Democrats, the 
press, lobbyists—is taking a victory lap with 
Senate passage of the Schumer-Manchin tax, 
climate and drug price control bill. The cli-
mate lobby is especially thrilled, claiming a 
historic victory that will reduce tempera-
tures, hold back the rising sea, and save the 
planet. 
Or, maybe not. Our contributor Bjorn 
Lomborg looked at the Rhodium Group esti-
mate for CO2 emissions reductions from 
Schumer-Manchin policies. He then plugged 
them into the United Nations climate model 
to measure the impact on global tempera-
ture by 2100. He finds the bill will reduce the 
estimated global temperature rise at the end 
of this century by all of 0.028 degrees Fahr-
enheit in the optimistic case. In the pessi-
mistic case, the temperature difference will 
be 0.0009 degrees Fahrenheit. 
In other words, the climate provisions in 
this ballyhooed legislation will have no no-
table impact on the climate. 
This isn’t surprising. No matter what the 
U.S. does to reduce greenhouse-gas emis-
sions, it will be dwarfed by what the rest of 
the world does. China, India and Africa 
aren’t about to stop burning fossil fuels as 
they develop, and China is sprinting ahead to 
build huge new coal capacity despite its 
pledge to start reducing emissions after 2030. 
Barring a breakthrough in battery or other 
technology, carbon emissions will continue 
to increase. No one knows how much the 
Earth’s temperature will warm, though even 
the U.N. model has modified its estimates 
from the apocalyptic predictions of some 
years ago. 
Schumer-Manchin won’t reduce inflation, 
won’t reduce the budget deficit, and it won’t 
reduce the world’s temperature. What it will 
do is transfer some $369 billion from tax-
payers and drug companies to the pockets of 
green energy businesses and investors. It will 
tighten the hold that politicians have on the 
allocation of capital, as they pick winners 
and losers with their grants and tax credits. 
Everyone will get a nice warm feeling as 
they pretend they are cooling the climate. 
Mr. GUTHRIE. This bill will not do 
what those on the floor today have said 
it will do. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to 
the gentlewoman from Iowa (Mrs. MIL-
LER-MEEKS). 
Mrs. 
MILLER-MEEKS. 
Madam 
Speaker, I thank Representative GUTH-
RIE for yielding me time. 
I rise today in opposition to H.R. 
5376, the Inflation Reduction Act. 
As a physician and former director of 
the Iowa Department of Public Health, 
I am uniquely positioned to understand 
the true implications of this bill and 
how this bill will affect both doctors 
and patients, and rural Iowans are no 
exception. 
Interestingly, I just heard my col-
league talk about how families may be 
kicked off their healthcare, and it 
doesn’t seem to me that my colleagues 
on the other side of the aisle cared 
about that when they passed the Af-
fordable Care Act and premiums rose 
dramatically. 
Allowing the Federal Government to 
set limits on drug pricing will limit 
competition and drastically reduce in-
novation within the pharmaceutical in-
dustry. Innovation also comes even 
after FDA approval to determine if 
drugs can be used for more than just 
their initial purpose. 
Additionally, narrowing the drug for-
mulary by drug pricing through Medi-
care and negotiations will end up tak-
ing medications that you may already 
be prescribed and taking successfully, 
taking them off of the formulary and 
not being covered. 
Let me also illustrate, when Medi-
care part D went into effect, the fact 
that there was not a negotiation by 
Medicare allowed generic drugs as low 
as $4 a medication. That was tremen-
dously helpful to millions of seniors 
and continues to this day. 
The United States is the leading de-
veloper of new drugs, but without mar-
ket competition, American companies 
will lose the incentive to undergo cut-
ting-edge research. 
What does that mean to the average 
person? It means fewer cures for rare 
diseases or debilitating diseases. Fewer 
cures, less treatment for debilitating 
diseases. 
Inevitably, the United States will be-
come 
dependent 
on 
countries 
like 
China for pharmaceutical research and 
development, and patients will be lim-
ited in their options. Didn’t we already 
see that through the pandemic? 
Additionally, this bill will extend 
ObamaCare subsidies enacted in the 
American Rescue Plan, which do not 
have income restrictions. Rather than 
helping those who are most in need, 
the wealthiest Americans will continue 
to receive the largest average benefit. 
This enormous spending package is 
bad for Iowans, bad for the economy, 
bad for hardworking Americans, and 
bad for the future of American innova-
tion. 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman 
from California (Ms. ESHOO), who is the 
chair of our Health Subcommittee. 
Ms. ESHOO. Madam Speaker, I first 
thank the chairman of the Energy and 
Commerce Committee, Mr. PALLONE, 
for his leadership and all of my col-
leagues on the committee who have 
worked so hard. 
I think today is a hallelujah day, and 
I say this because two of the greatest 
challenges facing our country are the 
following. 
The climate crisis: This is the single 
largest investment to take on the cli-
mate crisis head-on. I hear from chil-
dren as young as first graders in my 
district caring about this issue. Two 
years ago this time, I had 77,000 evac-
uees from the wildfires in my congres-
sional district. Taking on the climate 
crisis is absolutely essential. 
Seniors, the Medicare beneficiaries, 
we are changing their prescription drug 
prices today because Medicare will be 
able to directly negotiate and bring the 
prices down. 
Cap insulin at $35 a month—Senate 
Republicans sabotaged that cap on in-
sulin for all Americans. I don’t know 
how any politician can go home and 
brag about that. 
The out-of-pocket costs for Medicare 
beneficiaries will not exceed $2,000 a 
year. 
We are investing in the IRS. My con-
stituents have been waiting for too

long for their refunds. Added staff is 
going to expedite the services that the 
IRS and the American people need 
from the IRS. 
Finally, 
deficit 
reduction—yes, 
America, this is paid for. 
This is truly a hallelujah day. This is 
a red, white, and blue bill. It is good for 
all Americans, and it will advance our 
collective future of America. 
Ms. ESHOO. Madam Speaker, our Nation 
has major challenges that have kept me 
awake at night. 
The clarion call from young climate activists 
concerned they won’t have a planet to grow 
old on. I’ve heard seniors describe their inabil-
ity to afford their prescription drugs. 
Today, we change all this by the largest and 
boldest effort to address climate change in 
American history. It honors our commitments 
under the Paris Agreement by investing $369 
billion in tax credits, loans, and grants to re-
duce greenhouse gas emissions by 40 percent 
by 2030. 
For seniors, the Inflation Reduction Act re-
duces prescription drug costs through policies 
developed by the Health Subcommittee I 
chair. Over the past three years, we held six 
hearings focused on this challenge. 
The hearings brought forward the fact that 
our Nation has been held back for 20 years by 
a law that prohibits Medicare from negotiating 
directly with drug companies. Not anymore. 
The bill also ensures Medicare beneficiaries 
won’t pay more than $2,000 annually for pre-
scription drugs, and no more than $35 for in-
sulin every month. 
This legislation also lowers health care pre-
miums by strengthening the Affordable Care 
Act to save an average of $800 per year for 
13 million people. 
Finally, the entire legislation is paid for by 
making billion-dollar companies pay their fair 
share and lowers the federal deficit by more 
than $300 billion. 
Throughout my service in Congress, my top 
priorities have been to grow our economy, 
make health care more affordable, and ad-
dress climate change. Today’s transformative 
legislation meets these challenges, and I urge 
my colleagues to vote for it. 
Mr. GUTHRIE. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 11⁄2 minutes to the gentlewoman 
from Florida (Ms. CASTOR), who chairs 
the Select Committee on the Climate 
Crisis. 
Ms. CASTOR of Florida. Madam 
Speaker, as chair of the Select Com-
mittee on the Climate Crisis and as a 
mom, I am proud to say the Inflation 
Reduction Act is a big climate deal. 
This is the largest investment in 
clean energy and climate solutions 
ever in U.S. history, and it comes at a 
crucial time. 
We must urgently slash climate pol-
lution to avoid the worst impacts and 
to lower costs, create good-paying jobs, 
and build safer, more resilient commu-
nities. 
Today, I am optimistic that America 
will lead the world in solving the cli-
mate crisis, and I thank the young peo-
ple all across this country who pushed 
us to take this historic step. 
The Inflation Reduction Act is also 
good news for Floridians, as Democrats 
will lower the costs of prescription 
drugs, empower Medicare to negotiate 
drug prices, institute a $2,000 cap, and 
much more. 
It is a big deal for the 2.8 million Flo-
ridians 
who 
purchase 
high-quality 
health coverage under the Affordable 
Care Act. With these tax credits, those 
policies will be more affordable. 
Yes, this is good news indeed, a true 
people over politics moment for all of 
our neighbors, their health, their pock-
etbooks, and the obligation we have to 
our kids to provide a livable planet. 
I thank Speaker PELOSI for her vision 
for the Select Committee on the Cli-
mate Crisis, and I also thank Chairman 
FRANK PALLONE and my colleagues for 
their inspiring work. 
Madam Speaker, I urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote. 
Mr. GUTHRIE. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
This bill drives a massive build-out of 
unreliable wind and solar power, not 
nuclear, not natural gas, and not base-
load power. 
I include in the RECORD a report from 
the North American Electric Reli-
ability Corporation, the authority on 
electric reliability, which underscores 
the risk of blackouts from the over-
supply of weather-dependent energy. 
[From North American Electric Reliability 
Corporation, May 2022] 
2022 SUMMER RELIABILITY ASSESSMENT 
KEY FINDINGS 
NERC’s annual SRA covers the upcoming 
four-month (June-September) summer pe-
riod. This assessment provides an evaluation 
of generation resource and transmission sys-
tem adequacy and energy sufficiency to meet 
projected summer peak demands and oper-
ating reserves This assessment identifies po-
tential reliability issues of interest and re-
gional topics of concern. While the scope of 
this seasonal assessment is focused on the 
upcoming summer, the key findings are con-
sistent with risks and issues that NERC has 
highlighted in the 2021 Long-Term Reli-
ability Assessment and other earlier reli-
ability assessments and reports. 
The following findings are NERC and the 
ERO Enterprise’s independent evaluation of 
electricity generation and transmission ca-
pacity and potential operational concerns 
that may need to be addressed for the 2022 
summer. 
Summer Resource Adequacy Assessment and En-
ergy Risk Analysis 
Midcontinent ISO (MISO) faces a capacity 
shortfall in its North and Central areas, re-
sulting in high risk of energy emergencies 
during peak summer conditions. Capacity 
shortfall projections reported in the 2021 
LTRA and as far back as the 2018 LTRA have 
continued Load serving entities in 4 of 11 
zones entered the annual planning resource 
auction (PRA) in April 2022 without enough 
owned or contracted capacity to cover their 
requirements. Across MISO, peak demand 
projections have increased by 1.7 percent 
since last summer due in part to a return to 
normal demand patterns that have been al-
tered in prior years by the pandemic. How-
ever, more impactful is the drop in capacity 
in the most recent PRA: MISO will have 3,200 
MW (2.3 percent) less generation capacity 
than in the summer of 2021. System opera-
tors in MISO are more likely to need oper-
ating mitigations, such as load modifying re-
sources or non-firm imports, to meet reserve 
requirements under normal peak summer 
conditions. 
More 
extreme 
temperatures, 
higher generation outages, or low wind con-
ditions expose the MISO North and Central 
areas to higher risk of temporary operator- 
initiated load shedding to maintain system 
reliability. 
At the start of the summer, a key trans-
mission line connecting MISO’s northern and 
southern areas will be out of service. Res-
toration continues on a 4–mile section of 500 
kV transmission line that was damaged by a 
tornado during severe storms on December 
10, 2021. The transmission outage affects 1,000 
MW of firm transfers between the Mid-
western and Southern MISO system that in-
cludes parts of Arkansas, Louisiana, and 
Mississippi. The transmission line is ex-
pected to be restored at the end of June 2022. 
Anticipated resource capacity in Saskatch-
ewan will be strained to meet peak demand 
projections, which have risen by over 7.5 per-
cent since 2021. SaskPower is projected to re-
main above their planning reserve margin 
threshold and have sufficient operating re-
serves for normal peak conditions. However, 
external assistance is expected to be needed 
in extreme conditions that cause above-nor-
mal generator outages or demand. 
Drought conditions create heightened reli-
ability risk for the summer. Drought exists 
or threatens wide areas of North America, 
resulting in unique challenges to area elec-
tricity supplies and potential impacts on de-
mand: 
Energy output from hydro generators 
throughout most of the Western United 
States is being affected by widespread 
drought and below-normal snowpack. Dry 
hydrological conditions threaten the avail-
ability of hydroelectricity for transfers 
throughout the Western Interconnection. 
Some assessment areas, including WECC’s 
California-Mexico (CA/MX) and Southwest 
Reserve Sharing Group (SRSG), depend on 
substantial electricity imports to meet de-
mand on hot summer evenings and other 
times when variable energy resource (e.g., 
wind, solar) output is diminishing. In the 
event of wide-area extreme heat event, all 
U.S. assessment areas in the Western Inter-
connection are at risk of energy emergencies 
due to the limited supply of electricity avail-
able for transfer. 
Extreme drought across much of Texas can 
produce weather conditions that are favor-
able to prolonged, wide-area heat events and 
extreme peak electricity demand. Resource 
additions to the ERCOT system in recent 
years-predominantly solar and some wind— 
have raised Anticipated Reserve Margins 
above Reference Margin Levels and ease con-
cerns of capacity shortfalls for normal peak 
demand. However, extreme heat increases 
peak demand and can be accompanied by 
weather patterns that lead to increased 
forced outages or reduced energy output 
from resources of all types. A combination of 
extreme peak demand, low wind, and high 
outage rates from thermal generators could 
require system operators to use emergency 
procedures, up to and including temporary 
manual load shedding. 
As drought conditions continue over the 
Missouri River Basin, output from thermal 
generators that use the Missouri River for 
cooling in Southwest Power Pool (SPP) may 
be affected in summer months. Low water 
levels in the river can impact generators 
with once-through cooling and lead to re-
duced output capacity. Energy output from 
hydro generators on the river can also be af-
fected by drought conservation measures im-
plemented in the reservoir system. Outages 
and reduced output from thermal and hydro 
generation could lead to energy shortfalls at 
peak demand. Periods of above normal wind

generator output may give some relief, how-
ever, this energy is not assured. System op-
erators could require emergency procedures 
to meet peak demand during periods of high 
generator unavailability. 
All other areas have sufficient resources to 
manage normal summer peak demand and 
are at low risk of energy shortfalls from 
more extreme demand or generation outage 
conditions. 
Anticipated 
Reserve 
Margins 
meet or surpass the Reference Margin Level, 
indicating that planned resources in these 
areas are adequate to manage the risk of a 
capacity deficiency under normal conditions. 
Furthermore, based on risk scenario analysis 
in these areas, resources and energy appear 
adequate. 
Other Reliability Issues for Summer 
Supply chain issues and commissioning 
challenges on new resource and transmission 
projects are a concern in areas where com-
pletion is needed for reliability during sum-
mer peak periods. Assessment areas report 
that 
some 
generation 
and 
transmission 
projects are being impacted by product un-
availability, 
shipping 
delays, 
and 
labor 
shortages. At the time of this assessment 
publication, WECC-CA/MX, and WECC-SRSG 
have sizeable amounts of generation capac-
ity in development and included in their re-
source projections for summer. In Texas 
(ERCOT), transmission expansion projects 
are underway to alleviate transmission con-
straints and maintain system stability as 
the BPS is adapted to rapid growth in new 
generation; delays or cancellations of trans-
mission projects can cause transmission sys-
tem congestion during peak conditions and 
affect the ability to serve load in localized 
areas. Should project delays emerge, affected 
Generator Owners (GOs) and Transmission 
Owners must communicate changes to Bal-
ancing Authorities (BAs), Transmission Op-
erators, and Reliability Coordinators, so 
that impacts are understood and steps are 
taken to reduce risks of capacity deficiencies 
or energy shortfalls. 
Coal-fired GOs are having difficulty ob-
taining fuel and non-fuel consumables as 
supply chains are stressed. No specific BPS 
reliability impacts are currently foreseen; 
however, coal stockpiles at power plants are 
relatively low compared to historical levels. 
Some owners and operators report challenges 
in arranging replenishment due to mine clo-
sures, rail shipping limitations, and in-
creased coal exports. Some GOs have imple-
mented 
controls 
to 
maintain 
sufficient 
stocks for peak months while BAs and Reli-
ability Coordinators are continuing to con-
duct fuel surveys and monitoring the situa-
tion. 
The electricity and other critical infra-
structure sectors face cyber security threats 
from Russia and other potential actors amid 
heightened geopolitical tensions in addition 
to ongoing cyber risks. Russian attackers 
may be planning or attempting malicious 
cyber activity to gain access and disrupt the 
electric grid in North America in retaliation 
for support to Ukraine. The Electricity In-
frastructure Sharing and Analysis Center (E- 
ISAC) continues to exchange information 
with its members and has posted commu-
nications and guidance from government 
partners and other advisories on its Portal. 
E-ISAC members are encouraged to check in 
regularly to receive updates and to actively 
share information regarding threats and 
other malicious activities with the E-ISAC 
to enable broader communication with other 
sector participants and government part-
ners. 
Unexpected tripping of solar photovoltaic 
(PV) resources during grid disturbances 
continues to be a reliability concern. In May 
and June 2021, the Texas Interconnection ex-
perienced widespread solar PV loss events 
like those previously observed in the Cali-
fornia area. Similarly, four additional solar 
PV loss events occurred between June and 
August 2021 in California. 
Mr. GUTHRIE. This bill does not do 
what Democrats say it will do. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to 
the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. 
SCALISE), the Republican whip. 
Mr. SCALISE. Madam Speaker, I 
thank my friend from Kentucky (Mr. 
GUTHRIE) for yielding. 
I rise in strong opposition to this bill 
that will absolutely increase the def-
icit. It will absolutely increase infla-
tion, and this bill will absolutely in-
crease energy costs. In fact, they have 
a multibillion-dollar new tax on en-
ergy. 
I haven’t heard one person in Amer-
ica saying they want to pay more 
money for gasoline, yet they are put-
ting billions in new taxes on energy, so 
you will not only be paying more for 
gasoline, but you will be paying more 
for utility bills for your household, 
which are already skyrocketing be-
cause of President Biden and Speaker 
PELOSI’s radical, far-left spending they 
have already done the last year and a 
half. 
But it doesn’t end there. 
$250 billion in cuts to Medicare 
drugs—that is right. For seniors, this 
bill cuts $250 billion out of Medicare 
drug spending to help people in higher 
income brackets be eligible for more 
ObamaCare subsidies, so a massive 
wealth transfer away from seniors to 
higher-income people to get subsidies 
for ObamaCare. 
Then let’s talk about these 87,000 IRS 
agents. You think of just about any 
NFL stadium in America filled com-
pletely with new IRS agents. That is 
right, more than doubling the size of 
the IRS to go after lower-income peo-
ple. They love saying on the other side: 
Don’t worry. It is not going to touch 
them. 
There is only one problem: It doesn’t 
stand up to the facts. 
There was an amendment in the Sen-
ate, right here, very simple, a one-page 
amendment to protect people making 
under $400,000 from new audits by the 
IRS. This amendment was voted down 
on a party-line vote because they want 
that army of 87,000 IRS agents going 
after lower-income people. 
In fact, the smoking gun came out 
this morning. They don’t have a full 
CBO report on this bill. You heard the 
old adage that you have to pass the bill 
to find out what is in it. That is what 
they are doing today. That is why they 
are rushing this bill through today. It 
doesn’t even have a review from the 
Congressional Budget Office. 
But just a few hours ago, we got this. 
It was a confirmation that the IRS 
agents will be getting about $20 billion 
in new taxes from people making less 
than $400,000. That is right. The CBO 
just confirmed it a few hours ago. 
President Biden made that promise 
multiple times: If you make under 
$400,000, don’t worry; your taxes don’t 
go up. This bill breaks President 
Biden’s promise. It is confirmed by the 
CBO. 
There was an amendment to stop it 
from happening, and every Democrat 
voted against it. They wouldn’t allow 
us to bring that amendment here on 
the floor because they are ramming it 
through because they don’t want peo-
ple to know what is inside of this bill. 
$700-plus billion in new taxes—budget 
gimmicks that say, for the new taxes 
over 10 years, they are only going to 
account for 3 years of spending, which 
means if you account for the full 10 
years, it increases the deficit. Of 
course, during inflation times and this 
crisis we are facing economically, this 
bill will increase inflation and gas 
prices. 
Let’s reject the bill and go back to 
the drawing board. 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 11⁄2 minutes to the gentlewoman 
from New York (Ms. CLARKE), a mem-
ber of the Energy and Commerce Com-
mittee. 
Ms. CLARKE of New York. Madam 
Speaker, I thank the chairman for 
yielding. I rise today in support of H.R. 
5376, the Inflation Reduction Act of 
2022. 
This monumental generational in-
vestment in our Nation’s future will 
lower prescription drug prices and en-
ergy costs, extend healthcare coverage 
for millions of Americans, and deliver 
a vital down payment of resources in 
our stand against the climate crisis, all 
while creating millions of well-paying 
jobs across America. 
Moreover, it makes good on our 
promise to always fight for this coun-
try’s most vulnerable communities, 
now and forever. 
The journey to today has been chal-
lenging, to say the least, but I am at 
long last elated to know that the 
change Americans need and demand is 
finally here. 
Thanks to the hard work and cease-
less resolve of President Joe Biden, my 
Democratic colleagues on the Senate 
side, and every individual who took se-
riously their duty to fight tooth and 
nail to better the lives of every Amer-
ican in our care, our pursuit of 
progress has never been stronger. 
For communities of color, our sen-
iors, pregnant and postpartum people, 
individuals and families living on low 
wages, and everyone else who has long 
borne the brunt of too many hardships 
to list, this legislation represents the 
initial steps they have long and des-
perately awaited. 
b 1500 
The Inflation Reduction Act will pre-
vent thousands of premature deaths by 
improving air quality in densely popu-
lated communities with high environ-
mental justice needs. 
Mr. GUTHRIE. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from 
Ohio (Mr. LATTA), a member of the 
Committee on Energy and Commerce.

August 12, 2022 
Mr. LATTA. Madam Speaker, I rise 
in opposition to H.R. 5367, a bill the 
Democrats claim will reduce inflation 
when, in reality, it will do the exact 
opposite. 
American families are struggling to 
keep the lights on at home. Far too 
many people in this country are wor-
rying about the costs associated with 
putting food on their table and gas in 
their tanks. And yet, the majority has 
decided now is the time to double down 
on their tax-and-spend policies with 
American taxpayers footing the bill. 
It is also concerning that this bill 
promotes anti-American energy poli-
cies. It will put aside $250 billion at the 
Department of Energy to subsidize the 
rush to green energy. This is picking 
winners and losers in the energy mar-
ket and will scare away investments in 
baseload power sources. 
American small businesses need ac-
cess to more reliable energy, not less. 
If the grid becomes too reliant on 
intermittent green energy sources, we 
will begin to see manufacturers shutter 
their operations. 
Although it is hard to see how this 
bill could be salvaged, I did offer an 
amendment to try to prevent this out-
come. My amendment would have re-
quired the Secretary of Energy to cer-
tify that the bill would not negatively 
impact electric grid reliability before 
funding could be used. 
Considering 
the 
devastating 
con-
sequences that would result for Amer-
ican families and businesses, it makes 
perfect sense that the government 
should do its due diligence in exam-
ining all possible outcomes. 
Unfortunately, the majority chose 
not to consider my amendment on the 
House floor today. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to vote ‘‘no’’ on this legislation 
because it will increase taxes on Amer-
ican families, institute price controls 
that will block innovation and medical 
cures, promote irresponsible spending 
on Green New Deal carve-outs and pro-
vide significant risks to the electric 
grid. 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 11⁄2
minutes to the gentleman 
from Oregon (Mr. SCHRADER), a mem-
ber of the Committee on Energy and 
Commerce. 
Mr. SCHRADER. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today in complete support of H.R. 
5376, the Inflation Reduction Act. 
During my time in Congress, I have 
dedicated my service to improving our 
healthcare system and working to 
lower the cost of prescription drugs. I 
am ecstatic that the bill before us 
today includes my and Representative 
PETERS
drug price reduction frame-
work that will finally rein in the cost 
of prescription drugs for our seniors 
and protect pharmaceutical innova-
tion, contrary to what the other side 
will tell you. 
The Medicare drug cost reductions 
will be transformative. The bill will 
allow Medicare to finally negotiate 
drug prices and the practice of raising 
prices in the Medicare program beyond 
the rising inflation and provide lasting 
financial relief to our most vulnerable 
seniors by establishing a $2,000 out-of- 
pocket maximum for spending on pre-
scription drugs. 
The prescription drug cost portions 
of this bill will also preserve scientific 
creativity and the innovation eco-
system that has been essential to the 
domestic job-preserving development 
of life changing and lifesaving treat-
ments and cures. 
And the close to $300 billion in deficit 
reduction from this portion of the bill 
will be huge for the overall viability of 
our troubled Medicare system going 
forward. This will be the biggest im-
provement to Medicare since the incep-
tion of part D almost 20 years ago. I am 
proud to have been a leading advocate 
to deliver relief on the high cost of pre-
scription drugs. 
Madam Speaker, I thank my col-
leagues in both Chambers who worked 
with me directly to get this across the 
finish line. 
Mr. GUTHRIE. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from 
Florida 
(Mr. 
BILIRAKIS), 
my 
good 
friend. 
Mr. BILIRAKIS. Madam Speaker, I 
thank my good friend from the great 
State of Kentucky as well. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today in 
strong opposition to the inflation, re-
cession, IRS army act. 
As the American people struggle to 
put food on their tables and gas in 
their cars, Democrats bring us here 
today to raise Americans’ taxes and de-
stabilize our prescription drug market. 
My colleagues across the aisle want 
everyone to believe that this bill will 
drive down the cost of drugs, but they 
fail to mention that this policy will se-
verely stifle innovation, unfortunately. 
As a proud advocate for individuals 
suffering with cancer, rare diseases, 
and neurodegenerative diseases, such 
as ALS, Alzheimer’s, and Parkinson’s, 
I am committed to seeing cures come 
to market. But policies like this one 
will heartlessly jeopardize the likeli-
hood of these breakthroughs. 
I would like to see my Democratic 
colleagues work with us on the produc-
tive policy solutions found in the 
Lower Costs, More Cures Act, which 
would drive down the cost of drugs for 
the American people but would not de-
stroy the innovative research and de-
velopment that is uniquely American. 
Sadly, it seems more thought was 
put into targeting average Americans 
with an IRS army and over 1 million 
new audits than in helping them find 
cures for their life-threatening ail-
ments, unfortunately. 
Floridians deserve better. And the 
American people deserve better than 
this bogus piece of legislation that will 
raise taxes and reduce the number of 
cures and treatments coming to mar-
ket. 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 11⁄2 minutes to the gentlewoman 
from Michigan (Mrs. DINGELL), a mem-
ber from the Committee on Energy and 
Commerce. 
Mrs. DINGELL. Madam Speaker, I 
rise in strong support of the Inflation 
Reduction Act. This landmark package 
is finally on the House floor after over 
a year of hard work and rolling up our 
sleeves. 
This bill will serve all Americans by 
bringing down energy and health costs, 
reversing inflation, reducing the def-
icit, cleaning up our environment, and 
sparking a new, clean energy economy. 
It is responsibly paid for, and middle- 
class families will not see any in-
creased taxes. 
This is a defining moment for tack-
ling the climate crisis. This bold legis-
lation represents the single largest in-
vestment in clean energy, environ-
mental justice, and climate actions in 
American history, including the Green-
house Gas Reduction Fund and in-
creased investments in both the ATVM 
loan program, and the Domestic Manu-
facturing Conversion Grant program, 
based on legislation I helped write. 
The automotive industry is fully 
committed to going electric. While this 
legislation may pose some challenges 
in the short term, it will strengthen 
the long-term trajectory of the auto-
motive industry, our domestic supply 
chains, and American manufacturing. 
It is bringing jobs home, strength-
ening our supply chain, and reducing 
our dependency on foreign manufac-
turing. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to support this legislation. 
Mr. GUTHRIE. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from 
Ohio (Mr. JOHNSON), my good friend, 
Mr. 
JOHNSON 
of 
Ohio. 
Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to highlight my 
amendment that the minority refuses 
to even bring to a vote. My amendment 
is simple. It would amend this so-called 
Inflation Reduction Act by striking 
from the bill the Methane Emissions 
Reduction Program, which is a fancy 
term for what could be more accu-
rately described as attacks on Amer-
ican natural gas. 
In my district in eastern and south-
eastern Ohio, oil and gas workers get 
up every day to produce our valuable 
natural resources that are used to gen-
erate 
electricity, 
power 
manufac-
turing, heat and cool our homes, cook 
our food, and more recently, to use our 
American natural gas to rescue our Eu-
ropean allies who now find themselves 
under 
Vladimir 
Putin’s 
tyrannical 
thumb. 
This methane tax jeopardizes all of 
this, and it represents yet another at-
tack by the majority on American fos-
sil fuels that have brought more people 
out of poverty around the world than 
any other energy source around the 
planet. 
When I talk to producers in my dis-
trict, I give them a lot of credit. These 
companies, without being asked, are 
quite literally innovating every day. 
They use state-of-the-art technology to 
capture as much of their methane

emissions as possible, and they are 
proud to do it. 
And what is their reward? Well, they 
get a new tax anyway. It is also worth 
noting that the EPA is already work-
ing on rulemaking for regulating meth-
ane emissions, and the authors of this 
bill knew that—all to appease the rad-
ical environmentalist left. 
Madam Speaker, I want to be clear 
that this isn’t, ‘‘a methane reduction 
program.’’ It is a massive tax on Amer-
ican producers, American businesses, 
and American workers. It is a tax on 
job creators in Ohio. It is a tax on 
hardworking Americans trying to heat 
and cool our homes, and a tax on feed-
ing our families, and a tax on the 
American way of life. 
We should strike this provision from 
the bill. 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 11⁄2 minutes to the gentlewoman 
from Minnesota (Ms. CRAIG), a member 
of the Committee on Energy and Com-
merce. 
Ms. CRAIG. Madam Speaker, today is 
the day that we deliver on many of our 
promises to the American people. We 
are 
going 
to 
lower 
the 
cost 
of 
healthcare for millions of Americans. 
We are going to invest in American en-
ergy independence and reduce carbon 
emissions. We are going to do this in a 
responsible way, as we reduce the def-
icit in the process. 
The Inflation Reduction Act takes 
historic strides to make healthcare 
more affordable by capping the cost of 
insulin at $35 a month for those on 
Medicare. Capping out-of-pocket drug 
costs for our Nation’s seniors at $2,000 
a year, and empowering Medicare to 
negotiate drug prices for our seniors. 
We also extend the ACA tax credit, 
ensuring that we continue along the 
path of these historic rates of unin-
sured in our Nation. We are going to 
make the largest investment in clean 
energy in our Nation’s history, reduce 
carbon emissions by 40 percent this 
decade, and invest in biofuels infra-
structure for Minnesota’s family farm-
ers. 
Madam Speaker, I say to my col-
leagues, today, the will of our constitu-
ents will prevail over special inter-
ests—at least on this side of the aisle. 
Madam Speaker, this legislation will 
make a real difference in reducing 
costs for working families. I am proud 
to support it, and I encourage my col-
leagues to do the same. 
Mr. GUTHRIE. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 11⁄2 minutes to the gentlewoman 
from Washington State (Ms. SCHRIER). 
Ms. SCHRIER. Madam Speaker, I am 
so excited to vote today for this cli-
mate and healthcare bill, and here is 
why: This bill is the answer to the 
questions that my constituents have 
been asking since day one. 
Here is what I am hearing: 
Dr. Schrier, you have diabetes, too. I 
can’t afford my insulin. I am having to 
ration at the end of the month. Won’t 
you do something about it? 
Well, here is the answer: $35-a-month 
insulin. 
Dr. Schrier, I am a senior. I have a 
fixed income. I can’t afford these high 
drug prices. Why can’t Medicare nego-
tiate them? 
Well, here is your answer: Medicare 
getting the power to negotiate the cost 
of prescription drugs. 
Also: Dr. Schrier, I am a senior. 
There are too many out-of-pocket costs 
for me. 
This caps them at $2,000. 
And finally, right now, we have fires 
burning in Washington State. And I 
have farmers who have seen reduced 
crop yields because of extreme heat. 
They say: Dr. Schrier, can’t you do 
something about climate? 
And here is the answer: The biggest 
investment in climate solutions that 
we have ever had. 
This bill brings relief. It brings finan-
cial relief to families who are feeling 
the high inflation in gas prices. 
And you know how it does it? By fi-
nally making sure that the wealthiest 
corporations pay their fair share of 
taxes, and it does it without raising 
tax on middle-class families. 
Madam Speaker, I am so excited 
about this bill because it answers the 
requests of the people I represent, and 
that is why I am so excited to vote for 
it today. 
b 1515 
Mr. GUTHRIE. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from 
Texas (Mr. PFLUGER). 
Mr. PFLUGER. Madam Speaker, I 
rise to speak against this so-called In-
flation Reduction Act, a piece of legis-
lation that weakens America, weakens 
our businesses, increases the cost of en-
ergy for all Americans and our fami-
lies, and funds a new 87,000-person 
army of IRS agents that are coming 
after low- and middle-income families. 
Here is a pretty good rule of thumb 
for this legislation. If you are one of 
Biden’s chosen Green New Deal compa-
nies, you are probably going to get a 
handout from American taxpayers. But 
for small, independent American en-
ergy producers in districts like mine, 
the Permian Basin, your reward for 
keeping the lights on is a new, poorly 
conceived natural gas tax that will 
raise the cost of everything and give 
China an edge on our American manu-
facturers. 
In fact, I offered an amendment to 
strike this provision, but Democrats 
voted it down in the Rules Committee, 
voting against U.S. energy and voting 
for foreign energy. 
The Democrat response is tax credits 
for the rich, a slush fund for loans to 
their favorite green companies, and 
more regulatory red tape to drive up 
energy costs for all of us. 
Families have to decide whether to 
fill up their tanks or to pay for every-
day essentials at grocery stores be-
cause of high gas prices due to Presi-
dent Biden’s policies. 
The crowning achievement of this 
legislation won’t be inflation reduc-
tion. It will be making America more 
dependent on our adversaries, more de-
pendent on our adversaries for energy, 
dependent on China for medical manu-
facturing and supply chain issues, and 
dependent on China for critical min-
erals. 
If the Democrats’ goal is to reduce 
baseload, reliable power sources and in-
crease our dependency on foreign na-
tions, they are succeeding. If their goal 
is to create regulatory red tape to 
drive up energy costs for Main Street 
businesses and families, once again, 
they are succeeding. If their goal is to 
help American families and small busi-
nesses, this piece of legislation is a 
fail. 
America asked for relief, and instead, 
Democrats will deliver new and higher 
taxes that will be enforced by an 87,000- 
person IRS army. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues 
to 
vote 
for 
America 
and 
against this bill. 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 11⁄2 minutes to the gentlewoman 
from Texas (Mrs. FLETCHER), a member 
of the Energy and Commerce Com-
mittee. 
Mrs. FLETCHER. Madam Speaker, 
today is a historic day. Today, we will 
vote on the question of whether to 
allow Medicare to negotiate the price 
of prescription drugs and cap out-of- 
pocket costs for seniors; lower the cost 
of healthcare; implement smart energy 
policy to reduce emissions, fight cli-
mate change, and spur energy innova-
tion; invest in American manufac-
turing; and reduce our deficit spending 
by $300 billion. 
We answer these questions ‘‘yes’’ by 
voting for the Inflation Reduction Act. 
As the representative of the energy 
capital of the world, where we lead in 
energy technology and investment, I 
want to respond to some of the things 
that we have just heard. 
I am particularly proud of the work 
that we have done here to ensure that 
the historic methane emissions reduc-
tion program will actually reduce 
greenhouse gas emissions, make it pos-
sible for energy companies of all sizes 
to reduce their emissions through a 
grant program, and ensure that the 
United States remains the global lead-
er in energy production and in energy 
innovation and technology. 
We do this by voting together for this 
historic bill today. 
Mr. GUTHRIE. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentleman from 
California (Mr. GARAMENDI). 
Mr. GARAMENDI. Madam Speaker, 
the historic Inflation Reduction Act 
lowers everyday costs Americans are 
struggling to afford by cutting the 
price of prescription drugs, by making 
the largest-ever investment in climate 
action, and by reducing inflation—all 
of this without raising taxes on middle- 
class Americans and also paying down 
the national debt. 
For too long, the price of lifesaving 
prescription 
drugs 
has 
bankrupted

American families. No more. This bill 
caps out-of-pocket drug costs at $2,000 
and allows Medicare finally to directly 
negotiate the price of drugs. 
Similarly, we must address the in-
creasing costs Americans are bearing 
at the hands of climate change. This 
bill’s $369 billion investment in climate 
action will unleash a renaissance in 
clean energy technology, creating mil-
lions of new, high-paying manufac-
turing jobs, and build the next genera-
tion of American energy and transpor-
tation. 
Madam Speaker, I support this legis-
lation, and I call upon my colleagues, 
Democrats and Republicans, to pass 
this legislation. 
Mr. GUTHRIE. Madam Speaker, I in-
clude in the RECORD a Bloomberg News 
story reporting how power costs are al-
ready forcing U.S. factories to shut 
down, featuring an aluminum mill in 
my district, in Hawesville, Kentucky. 
This underscores the risk to our Na-
tion’s competitiveness that these poli-
cies bring about, and this bill will not 
do what those on the floor say that it 
will do. 
[From Bloomberg News, July 7, 2022] 
THE US INDUSTRIAL COMPLEX IS STARTING TO 
BUCKLE FROM HIGH POWER COSTS 
(By Joe Deaux and Naureen S Malik) 
It was only a matter of time, really. 
Europe’s fertilizer plants, steel mills, and 
chemical manufacturers were the first to 
succumb. Massive paper mills, soybean proc-
essors, and electronics factories in Asia went 
dark. 
Now soaring natural gas and electricity 
prices are starting to hit the US industrial 
complex. 
On June 22, 600 workers at the second-larg-
est aluminum mill in America, accounting 
for 20 percent of US supply, learned they 
were losing their jobs because the plant can’t 
afford an electricity tab that’s tripled in a 
matter of months. Century Aluminum Co. 
says it’ll idle the Hawesville, Kentucky, mill 
for as long as a year, taking out the biggest 
of its three US sites. A shutdown like this 
can take a month as workers carefully swirl 
the molten metal into storage so it doesn’t 
solidify in pipes and vessels and turn the en-
tire facility into a useless brick. Restarting 
takes another six to nine months. For this 
reason, owners don’t halt operations unless 
they’ve exhausted all other options. 
It’s the most poignant signal yet of what’s 
to come-but not the only one. 
At least two steel mills have begun sus-
pending some operations to cut energy costs, 
according to one industry executive, who 
asked not to be identified because the infor-
mation isn’t public. In May, a group of fac-
tories across the US Midwest warned federal 
energy regulators that some were on the 
verge of closing for the summer or longer be-
cause of what they described as ‘‘unjust and 
unreasonable’’ electricity costs. They asked 
to be wholly absolved of some power fees-a 
request that, if granted, would be unprece-
dented. 
It’s no wonder. By the beginning of June, 
natural gas prices had tripled what they 
were a year earlier, threatening households 
and businesses alike with some of the biggest 
utility bills they’ve ever seen. This summer, 
electricity rates for industrial customers are 
set to hit their highest levels ever, based on 
US government forecasts. Because US plants 
and factories depend on both electricity and 
gas, this could very well be the moment the 
rug’s pulled out from under American indus-
try. 
Manufacturing overtime hours have al-
ready declined for three straight months, the 
longest downward stretch since 2015, and a 
measure of US manufacturing activity weak-
ened in June to a two-year low as new orders 
contracted. A week after Century’s an-
nouncement, the nation’s largest aluminum 
producer Alcoa Corp. said it’s closing a third 
of its production at a mill in Indiana because 
of ‘‘operational challenges.’’ 
These headwinds could eventually threaten 
what some see as a longer-term boom in US 
manufacturing as corporations look to re-
duce their dependence on China. Executives 
are highlighting plans to relocate production 
at a greater clip this year than they even did 
in the first six months of the pandemic, but 
energy and labor costs will pose challenges 
for any company looking to build a new op-
eration in the US. 
Manufacturing isn’t the bellwether of the 
US economy it once was. The plants that 70 
years ago employed more than a third of the 
nation’s labor force now account for about 8 
percent of nonfarm workers. An industrial 
downturn on its own won’t tip us into a re-
cession, but it could if combined with weak-
ness in other sectors. While the might of 
American industry has significantly weak-
ened over the years, it still accounts for 
more than a tenth of US gross domestic 
product-and for that reason holds an outsize 
place in the hearts of politicians whose fac-
tory visits are a perennial staple of cam-
paigns. 
Plants will try to operate more efficiently 
to lower their utility bills, but there are lim-
its to how much they can save. In a lot of re-
gions, industrial users aren’t just paying for 
the power they use; they’re also paying for 
what’s known as capacity, essentially an in-
surance policy that keeps enough power on 
the grid for the most extreme of demand 
days. (Think hot summer days when every-
one’s air conditioners are blasting.) And with 
wholesale energy prices near the highest lev-
els since 2008 and aging power plants shut-
ting, those insurance premiums are growing 
exponentially, particularly in the middle of 
the country where much of the country’s in-
dustrial operations lie. 
One potential bright spot, or an indication 
of how desperate industrial companies are 
becoming: 
Some 
are 
partnering 
with 
startups 
to 
explore 
alternative 
energy 
sources: Nature Energy says it expects to 
start building facilities this year to collect 
and convert cow dung and crop waste into re-
newable natural gas. Power Edison, which is 
proposing to stack massive batteries on 
barges that can be shipped around to cus-
tomers in need, is attracting more attention. 
As Katie Coleman, an attorney for Texas 
Association of Manufacturers, puts it, her 
members have three big cost drivers: taxes, 
electricity, and labor. Those three vary in 
proportion over time, she says, ‘‘but right 
now, electricity is an even larger factor than 
normal.’’ Some companies with multiple fac-
tories are trying to decide which plants to 
keep running this summer based on how 
cheap they can get their electricity, she 
says, and some may decide which to perma-
nently close. Such is the case for Century, 
which will keep operations running in Ice-
land where power is incredibly cheap because 
of local renewable energy resources. 
There is a lot to blame for this year’s surge 
in US energy prices: Russia’s invasion of 
Ukraine; the ensuing surge in US natural gas 
exports to markets overseas; extreme weath-
er brought on by climate change; aging fos-
sil-fuel-fired power plants retiring at a 
record pace. They’re all coinciding with a 
sharp rebound in post-pandemic demand. 
One group of manufacturers will say they 
told us so. The Industrial Energy Consumers 
of America has been calling on the Biden ad-
ministration for months to limit the amount 
of gas US energy suppliers send overseas, 
warning that exports would eventually lead 
to supply shortages at home. But a measure 
like that would set a dangerous precedent 
and threaten the billions of dollar of invest-
ments in liquefied natural gas terminals 
along US shores. Shipments overseas have so 
far remained unfettered. 
How severe of an industrial downturn we’re 
heading into depends on a lot of variables 
-chief among them being how long energy 
prices remain high. Milder weather, fewer 
power plant disruptions, and more solar and 
wind farm deployments could shift the nat-
ural gas market back into an era of lower 
prices and improve the fortunes of manufac-
turers. Today, we are far from that. 
Michael Harris, whose firm Unified Energy 
Services LLC buys fuel for industrial clients, 
says costs have risen so high that some are 
having to put millions of dollars of credit on 
the line to secure power and gas contracts. 
‘‘That can be devastating for a corporation,’’ 
he says. ‘‘I don’t see any scenario, absent ex-
plosions at US LNG facilities’’ that trap sup-
plies at home, in which gas prices are headed 
lower in the long term. 
Mr. GUTHRIE. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from 
Georgia (Mr. CARTER). 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today in strong opposi-
tion to the inflation expansion act, 
which includes deeply troubling pro-
posals that will kneecap medical inno-
vation and harm patients’ access to 
cures. 
Madam Speaker, for 40 years, I was 
behind the counter. I was the one who 
had to tell the patient how much their 
prescription was going to be. I was the 
one who witnessed the senior citizens 
trying to make a decision between buy-
ing their medication or buying their 
groceries. I was the one who had to tell 
the mother how much the antibiotic 
was going to be and see her in tears 
trying to find the money to pay for 
that antibiotic. I know all too well 
about prescription drug prices. 
Today, I am behind the podium as my 
Democratic colleagues decide whether 
to 
mortgage 
those 
same 
patients’ 
health and well-being for a political 
win. This is immoral, and it must be 
stopped. 
The United States leads the world in 
medical innovation. I have watched it, 
and I have seen it as terminal illnesses 
became treatable with a simple pill. I 
have seen the relief on a patient’s face 
when they heard that a new treatment 
is available for their once incurable 
disease. This bill eradicates hope. 
Madam Speaker, we need to help 
lower drug prices and costs for pa-
tients, but this legislation goes about 
it in all the wrong ways. Pharma-
ceutical companies are the drivers of 
innovation that deliver lifesaving cures 
to patients. However, this legislation 
will result in dozens, possibly hun-
dreds, of fewer cures over the next dec-
ade. 
I tried to fix this self-imposed prob-
lem 
in 
the 
Rules 
Committee 
on 
Wednesday, but it was rejected. I also 
introduced an amendment to block the

Federal Government from funding rad-
ical green lobbying groups, but that 
was rejected. 
There is no excuse for the Federal 
Government to steal billions of dollars 
from taxpayers, including $1.5 billion 
in funding for tree equity, while infla-
tion sits at a 40-year high. 
Medical professionals are sworn to do 
no harm. It is time Congress took the 
same oath and quit our assault on tax-
payers and mostly on patients. 
Madam Speaker, I urge a ‘‘no’’ vote. 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentleman from 
Maryland (Mr. MFUME). 
Mr. MFUME. Madam Speaker, this is 
really about people over politics today, 
and I am glad that people all over the 
country are watching and listening to 
this debate. 
It is not about the wealthy, the well- 
connected, and the well-off. It is about 
people who believe, like many of us, 
that we have gone too far without low-
ering the cost of medicine for everyday 
people by reducing and capping costs 
where they are—the $35 cap on insu-
lin—and finding a way to close the real 
gap that exists in terms of affordable 
care and extension of the subsidies and 
making sure that we are really tack-
ling the climate crisis by providing the 
things that will allow consumers and 
homeowners to do what they need to 
find a way to take advantage of the tax 
subsidies. 
Most of all, it says to everyone else 
that this is completely paid for. This is 
not a tax bill. It is paid for. It is paid 
for by making sure that the wealthiest 
and corporations that really get out of 
paying taxes don’t get out of paying 
taxes anymore. 
It is not about the wealthy, the well- 
connected, and the well-off. It is about 
people all over this country, in Balti-
more and elsewhere, who want and 
need this legislation. 
Mr. GUTHRIE. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentleman from 
Indiana (Mr. MRVAN). 
Mr. MRVAN. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today in support of the Inflation Re-
duction Act, the historic measure that 
takes action to lower costs for individ-
uals and families in northwest Indiana 
and throughout our Nation. 
Of particular importance to me are 
the provisions that finally address the 
unfair disadvantage our seniors face 
when deciding between missing a meal 
or missing a prescription drug. 
As a local elected official, I sat at the 
table with individuals making those 
choices, and we were able to find solu-
tions. I appreciate more than anything 
that, under this legislation, Medicare 
will negotiate certain prescription drug 
prices, limit out-of-pocket costs for in-
sulin at $35 per month, and, for the 
first time ever, cap Medicare part D 
out-of-pocket drug costs at $2,000. It is 
to the seniors’ advantage to have this 
passed. 
This is real progress that provides 
real relief to seniors, and I urge my 
colleagues to join me in supporting 
this critical legislation. 
Mr. GUTHRIE. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from 
Ohio (Mr. BALDERSON). 
Mr. BALDERSON. Madam Speaker, I 
rise in opposition to H.R. 5376. Today, 
we are voting on a bill that achieves 
the exact opposite of what its name im-
plies. 
Here is what is in their $745 billion 
inflation reduction plan. 
It raises taxes on businesses in the 
midst of a recession. It forces us into a 
socialist drug-pricing scheme, leading 
to fewer lifesaving cures, higher costs, 
and less hope. It hires 87,000 more IRS 
agents to spy on you. It makes it more 
expensive to heat your home with a 
new tax on American natural gas. It 
wastes $27 billion on the EPA climate 
bank charged with handing out all of 
your tax dollars to woke energy cor-
porations. 
They are throwing your hard-earned 
money at their Green New Deal dreams 
while carrying out their misguided 
threats to eliminate fossil fuels. Just 
look at Europe’s energy crisis to see 
the true cost of the rush-to-green agen-
da. 
Rather than unleashing America’s 
abundant energy resources, this legis-
lation raises taxes on energy produc-
tion and imposes restrictions on local 
producers in my district and in Ohio. 
Instead of helping bring down prices at 
the pump for hardworking Americans, 
this bill gives away $7,500 tax credits 
for the wealthy to buy and upgrade 
their electric vehicles. 
What does all of this mean for Ohio-
ans? Higher prices, energy insecurity, 
and tax hikes. 
Madam Speaker, this bill only makes 
matters worse. I urge a ‘‘no’’ vote on 
H.R. 5376. 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentleman from 
New Jersey (Mr. KIM). 
Mr. KIM of New Jersey. Madam 
Speaker, in 2018, I was at a home in a 
retirement community along the Jer-
sey Shore. A gentleman pulled me 
aside and, in a whispered voice, shared 
with me that he pays over $500 a month 
for prescription drugs and couldn’t 
keep up. He resorted to halving his 
pills. 
He told me he was a proud man, but 
I could hear a quiver in his voice be-
cause he felt bad that he couldn’t pro-
vide for himself and his wife. He said he 
worked hard for his entire life, but he 
can’t do this on his own. 
I told him that it was not his fault, 
that prices had been skyrocketing, 
that Medicare had not been able to ne-
gotiate prices, and that here in the 
richest, most powerful Nation in the 
world, those who worked hard over the 
course of their lives are left to fend for 
themselves, halving their medication. 
How sad is that? 
I come to the floor of the House 
today to say that this stops here. 
Medicare will be able to negotiate, 
and because of that gentleman and 
many others I heard from, I decided to 
help author the provision to cap the 
out-of-pocket costs for seniors at $2,000 
a year, which is about $166 a month. 
Seniors have been waiting too long, 
and it is time now to get this done. 
Mr. GUTHRIE. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, may 
I inquire how much time is remaining 
on both sides. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Ms. 
HOULAHAN). The gentleman from New 
Jersey has 5 minutes remaining. The 
gentleman from Kentucky has 4 min-
utes remaining. 
b 1530 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentleman from 
Ohio (Mr. RYAN). 
Mr. RYAN. Madam Speaker, this is 
an American bill—apple pie; mom; 
baseball; and red, white, and blue. This 
is for the exhausted majority of the 
people in this country: Democrats, Re-
publicans, and Independents versus the 
extremists. 
Madam Speaker, if you think that 
this town has been spending too much 
money and we need to reduce the def-
icit, we do that by hundreds of billions 
of dollars. If you think seniors are tak-
ing it on the chin, we help them with 
prescription drugs and $35 insulin pay-
ments. If you think we need to increase 
the production of natural gas, that is 
in this bill to create jobs here, lower 
costs here, and export to Europe and 
the rest of the world to knock Putin’s 
knees out from under him. 
The most exciting thing in this bill is 
we double down on finally having an 
industrial policy in this country to 
out-compete China. We are going to 
build things. On top of the infrastruc-
ture bill and the CHIPS Act, we are 
going to build electric vehicles, elec-
tric cars, and electric tractors. With 
batteries, solar, and wind, we are going 
to rebuild the middle class. 
While the other side wants to defund 
the FBI, we want to fund our kids’ fu-
ture here in the United States. 
Mr. GUTHRIE. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, there is nothing in 
the bill that increases our production 
of natural gas. The Methane Emissions 
Reduction Program is a natural gas tax 
that will impact the entire economy. 
The natural gas tax will make every-
thing more expensive for American 
families. The natural gas tax will in-
crease the price of fuel, fertilizer, and 
food. 
Madam Speaker, 180 million Ameri-
cans use natural gas to heat homes and 
run appliances. About 51⁄2 million busi-
nesses use it to run their workplaces 
and manufacturing facilities. 
This bill will give EPA sweeping au-
thority to expand the natural gas tax 
to other sectors, including agriculture. 
There are no guardrails to prevent the 
EPA from ratcheting up the natural 
gas tax in years ahead.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H7690 
August 12, 2022 
Madam Speaker, I yield 21⁄2 minutes 
to the gentlewoman from the State of 
Tennessee (Mrs. HARSHBARGER). 
Mrs. 
HARSHBARGER. 
Madam 
Speaker, I rise today in opposition to 
the far-left inflation expansion act. 
This bill is detrimental to Ameri-
cans’ wallets and their ability just to 
keep their heads above water. This bill 
is 
littered 
with 
economy-crushing 
measures that cater to climate extrem-
ists and Socialists. This tax will im-
pact every single part of our lives. It 
will be more expensive to heat our 
homes, to buy basic necessities, and it 
will even de-incentivize manufacturing 
of thousands upon thousands of goods 
that we use every day. 
This bill is chock-full of Green New 
Deal slush funds with no account-
ability and no transparency. We cannot 
afford to pour billions that we don’t 
have into programs that cut our gas 
and oil industry off at the knees—an 
industry 
that 
is 
already 
suffering 
greatly under the Biden administra-
tion. 
This attack on our refineries could 
lead to even higher gas prices. I know 
that is hard to believe, but it is true. It 
leaves us exposed and more reliant on 
our enemies. 
This bill is problematic from start to 
finish, but as a licensed pharmacist for 
over 30 years, the most concerning part 
of this Socialist scheme is that the 
government will now have authority to 
set pricing on lifesaving medication. 
And when they set the price, it is going 
to be out of the reach of the Americans 
who need it the most. The tip of the 
day is you never want the government 
in control of pricing anything. 
This act will directly take away hope 
from seniors and as many as 100-plus 
cures will be in jeopardy. There will be 
no incentive for companies to develop 
cures for rare and ultra-rare diseases. 
This bill encourages drug companies to 
spend less on research and development 
and more on navigating the politics of 
it all. 
Americans are already being forced 
to choose between purchasing groceries 
or purchasing their prescriptions, and 
the last thing anyone needs is higher 
prices for prescriptions and rising in-
surance premiums. 
Members on the other side of the 
aisle continue to push an agenda that 
America does not want. This bill is 
horrendous. It is an abomination that 
Democrats would go to such lengths— 
as far as risking the health and the 
safety of the people they swore an oath 
to represent—just to push their radical 
liberal agenda. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to consider the lives that will 
be negatively impacted by this radical 
bill and hope to see all the Members of 
the House of Representatives make the 
right decision for America with a ‘‘no’’ 
vote on this far-left inflation expansion 
act. 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself 1 minute. 
Madam Speaker, I just want to take 
this opportunity to thank my com-
mittee staff who worked so hard on 
this legislation for so many years. This 
day would not be possible if it wasn’t 
for their dedication and constant perse-
verance: Tiffany Guarascio, Waverly 
Gordon, Rick Kessler, Una Lee, Jac-
quelyn Bolen, Saha Khaterzai, Rick 
Van 
Buren, 
Tuley 
Wright, 
Caitlin 
Haberman, Adam Fischer, Anthony 
Gutierrez, 
Tyler 
O’Connor, 
Medha 
Surampudy, Jacqueline Cohen, Dustin 
Maghamfar, Timia Crisp, and Brendan 
Larkin. 
Let me just say, Madam Speaker, I 
am still waiting for a couple more 
speakers. I just want to say that I can-
not emphasize enough the significance 
of this legislation in terms of reducing 
costs for seniors through negotiated 
prices for Medicare, extending the Af-
fordable Care Act, which has made so 
many people have health insurance 
who didn’t have it before, and also ad-
dressing climate change, which is real-
ly the greatest crisis of our time. There 
is nothing that could be more signifi-
cant in this legislation. 
Madam Speaker, I would inquire how 
much time is remaining. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from New Jersey has 3 minutes 
remaining. The gentleman from Ken-
tucky has 1 minute remaining. 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. GUTHRIE. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentleman from 
California (Mr. MCCARTHY), who is one 
of my good friends here in Congress, a 
great leader, and the Republican leader 
in the House of Representatives. 
Mr. MCCARTHY. Madam Speaker, 
today feels like a little deja vu. 
It feels like we are sitting back—was 
it February of last year? 
America is on a brink. The world is 
warning the majority party if they fol-
low through with more of their spend-
ing they could create inflation in 
America. 
It wasn’t just on our side of the aisle 
that warned you. No. The former Sec-
retary of the Treasury warned you that 
if you went through with that $2 tril-
lion that inflation would rise and 
America would be harmed. But nobody 
listened on the other side. 
They were proud. They were going to 
cheer. They were going to get elected. 
They were going to win based upon 
this. They went ahead and they passed 
that bill with one-party control in the 
House and in the Senate, and the Presi-
dent signed it. 
If you listened to Steve Rattner, a 
Democratic 
adviser 
to 
Obama, 
he 
called it the original sin of inflation. 
Listen to the American public. 
Madam Speaker, I hope every single 
Member asks their constituents: Could 
they give 1 month’s salary up? 
Could they afford to give a month’s 
salary up? 
I would love it, Madam Speaker, if 
the Members would come back and tell 
me anyone who says ‘‘yes’’ to that. 
But the sad part about it, Madam 
Speaker, is everybody in America who 
is paid on a salary just lost more than 
1 month because it was deja vu all over 
again. It was exactly that vote that 
took more than 1 month’s salary from 
every American that is paid monthly. 
We have got a President, Madam 
Speaker, who thinks that inflation is 
zero. I guess that is why we are back to 
where we are again. 
Today the people’s House should be 
working to answer our country’s call 
to address the rising prices of gas, gro-
ceries, and just about anything else 
that Americans buy. I haven’t heard 
one debate on this floor today about 
how we are going to lower the gasoline 
price. I am not sure, but I guess, 
Madam Speaker, on the Democratic 
side they think if they raise taxes then 
somehow that will make the price go 
down and not up. They have been prov-
en to be wrong. 
Instead, Madam Speaker, moments 
from now we will take up this mis-
guided, tone-deaf bill. I believe it is the 
largest tone-deaf bill I have ever seen 
in this Chamber in 232 years. 
Democrats more than any other ma-
jority in history are addicted to spend-
ing other people’s money regardless of 
what we as a country can afford. 
Madam Speaker, I almost see glee in 
their eyes. I know there are not a lot of 
them here because they can vote by 
proxy. It is the only Chamber in the 
history of America that has ever al-
lowed that—not even on the Senate 
side, not even during war, and not even 
during plague, but this body has, and 
this body continued it. They just ex-
tended it. This bill wasn’t debated 
here. It wasn’t talked about. But a lot 
of people are going to phone it in. 
They started this Congress with tril-
lions in wasteful spending that caused 
runaway inflation. 
Their answer was to blame everybody 
else. 
Now, their answer is just to deny 
there is inflation and just say it is 
zero. But today, now they are choosing 
to end the session by spending half a 
trillion dollars more of your money, 
raising taxes on the middle class, and 
giving hand-outs to their liberal allies. 
Madam Speaker, unlike most of the 
Democrats, I have read this bill past 
the title. The facts about this bill are 
just astonishing. It sends $27 billion to 
a fraudulent national climate bank. 
Put that in perspective: that is triple 
the size of the EPA’s current annual 
budget. 
Madam Speaker, as I go across the 
country I look to the gas stations and 
see people cry about how much it is 
costing them. 
You chose to raise it higher but not 
to give relief to the American public by 
lowering the gas price. 
Along with that slush fund, it hands 
out tax credits like candy with no ac-
countability. But when it comes to 
natural gas, which heats our homes 
and cooks our food, it raises taxes to 
fund their Socialist scams. 
Madam Speaker, your energy prices 
will now go through the roof.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H7691 
August 12, 2022 
Madam Speaker, I look forward to 
hearing how every Democrat who votes 
for this bill—be it in person or how 
they phone it in by proxy—explain it to 
their constituents this winter when 
they are making a choice about wheth-
er they pay the energy to heat their 
homes or they cut back on the gas to 
fill their tank or they no longer even 
buy the food at the grocery store be-
cause it just comes too high, they have 
to change. 
Madam Speaker, as they continue to 
raise trillions after trillions, when ev-
erybody warns them what they do is 
wrong, they don’t care. They just want 
to double down on the mistakes they 
have already made. 
Don’t expect drug prices to come 
down either. This bill would cut treat-
ments and hinder new cures by giving 
bureaucrats the power to decide what 
drugs seniors can access. It reduces 
your options and raises your costs. 
That is okay because that is their 
philosophy. They know best. Just like 
they knew best when they thought $2 
trillion would help. They called it the 
American Rescue Plan. 
You now have time to see what you 
have done. 
Explain to me in the American Res-
cue Plan when it raised inflation and 
that took 1 month’s salary from the 
American public, what did it rescue? 
b 1545 
Who did it help? 
Answer me this question: Is America 
better off today than they were 2 years 
ago? Is the price of gasoline lower? It 
is? 
The price of gasoline is lower today 
than it was 2 years ago? I guess you be-
lieve inflation is zero, too. I am not 
quite sure about your math. 
Is grocery lower than it was 2 years 
ago? Are the car prices lower than it 
was 2 years ago? Are your food prices? 
I would love a natural debate right 
here. Why don’t we have that? Because 
the American people are having a chal-
lenge. 
You know, one of the most successful 
businesses in America is Walmart. 
When Walmart wants to look at where 
the economy is in America, they don’t 
go hire economists. You know what 
they do? They just check the data of 
Americans and what they buy. And for 
those who answered yes, you ought to 
study it, too. 
You know what? They just look at 
four products. They look at hamburger 
buns, hotdog buns, whole wheat, and 
white bread. And you know what? If 
the hamburger buns sales go down and 
the hot dog buns sales go down and the 
whole wheat sales go down, but the 
white bread sales go up, you are in an 
economic crisis. You know why? Be-
cause people no longer can make the 
decision to have hamburgers with ham-
burger buns. They have to put the 
white bread there. 
For all of you who said yes, why 
don’t you get out of Washington for a 
moment and go ask your constituents 
if they are better off today than they 
were 2 years ago; because no, gas is not 
lower. Gas is higher. And no, the car 
prices are higher, and their food prices 
are higher, and they are going up each 
and every day. 
I can’t believe you would say yes. 
You probably believe the American 
Rescue Plan was a good bill. You prob-
ably believe it is Putin’s fault, too. 
Passing this bill today means more 
expensive bills for Americans tomor-
row, and everyone who says otherwise 
isn’t telling the truth. 
But of all the bad parts of this 700- 
page bill, the massive expansion of the 
IRS is the most chilling. 
Madam Speaker, I wonder if we could 
ask the same question and, oh, boy, I 
imagine America will ask that in just 
roughly 87 more days. They won’t just 
ask it, they will answer the question, 
even if it is not asked; if they are bet-
ter off than they were 2 years ago. 
But they will probably ask the ques-
tion: Is America better off with 87,000 
more IRS agents? 
Currently, the IRS has almost 80,000 
employees. So you are going to smile; 
you are going to vote for it. A lot of 
you are going to mail it in because you 
are just going to vote by proxy. You 
are going to pass a bill you never de-
bated by people voting by proxy. 
You are going to double the size of 
the IRS. They have 80,000 employees. 
You know what the IRS also has? 4,600 
guns, 5 million rounds of ammunition. 
Why? 
Democrats want to double its already 
massive size. You are going to spend 
$80 billion of hard-earned American 
taxpayer money to hire an army of 
87,000 new IRS agents. 
Why would you even propose that? 
Because you say, oh, it pays for the 
bill. 
Madam Speaker, I have got plenty of 
time. 
I think I will. I appreciate the en-
couragement because I think America 
needs the encouragement, because you 
know what? America actually needs a 
plan that works. 
Why, if you passed an American Res-
cue Plan that caused inflation that we 
haven’t seen in 41 years—why, if you 
went after the fossil fuel of America 
that raised the price of gasoline that 
Americans haven’t seen before—why do 
you keep harming the American pub-
lic? And you think doing the exact 
same thing is your answer to save it? 
But while this bill doubles the num-
ber of IRS personnel, it does not ex-
pand due process protections for the 
American people. Worse, it includes no 
income floor for who can be audited. 
Some of the same people on the other 
side of the aisle, Madam Speaker, who 
say we are better off than we were 2 
years ago, that somehow—I don’t know 
where they get their gas, but they said 
their gas price is lower. Let me know, 
because I need to fill my tank up. 
So when you say that you are not 
going to go after every American to 
audit, you are not being honest, just 
like you are not being honest about 
what you did to cause the pain to this 
country. And you have no plan to solve 
it. You simply double down to the 
exact same thing you did before. 
Based upon the past numbers, we 
know this would mean 710,000 new au-
dits for people who make under $75,000. 
So someone who makes under $75,000, 
you think they need to pay for this. So 
what you are going to do is not trust 
them. 
Madam Speaker, you say you don’t 
trust the American public, but you are 
not going to hire all these people for 
the IRS so they could be there to help 
people fill out their tax returns. No, 
these people are going to audit them. 
We are going to double the size, and 
they are going to go after you. 
You see, there is a philosophy here, 
Madam Speaker. One side of this aisle 
believes in the American people. One 
side thinks they know best. Even when 
the gas prices have risen, you think it 
is lower. 
I am sorry to tell you, Madam Speak-
er, the President even admitted the gas 
price is higher, but he thought it was a 
good thing. It was a good thing. Be-
cause you think everybody can go out 
and buy a new car. 
Well, we are going to audit you be-
cause we need to go after you because 
we think you are not fair, you are not 
honest, and we are going to make you 
pay for something else. Just pay for 
the things we care most about. 
It costs individuals thousands of dol-
lars in attorneys’ fees and compliance 
costs just to be audited by the IRS. 
Imagine what you would do with an 
extra $10,000 a year. Imagine how much 
better you could have used it than the 
Federal Government. 
And somehow you think it is best. 
You think it is best. 
That is how Democrats pay for their 
pet projects. Your pocketbook is their 
plan to fund more inflationary spend-
ing. 
This is just a train wreck just wait-
ing to happen. And with this new 
power, the IRS will snoop around in 
your bank account, in your Venmo, 
your small business, and then the gov-
ernment will shake you down for every 
last cent. 
You know, in light of this week’s 
events, let me ask: Do you really trust 
this administration, the IRS, to be fair, 
to not abuse their power? 
I hope that I am wrong, but history 
doesn’t lie. 
Madam Speaker, as I travel the coun-
try, a lot of people know different 
names of people who work at the IRS, 
Lois Lerner, and others. And even when 
it comes to light, government is power-
ful, government is big, government can 
take, as you have proven. You have 
taken so much from the American pub-
lic. But now you want to intimidate 
them. 
I have watched Democrats weaponize 
the government before, and I don’t 
trust them now. 
Madam Speaker, mark my words. 
Long after the headlines of this week

fade, we will look back on this very 
day and on this bill as the one that 
broke the camel’s back. 
I am sure, Madam Speaker, as the 
months progress, there will be new 
blame, there will be new problems. It 
will be those who own the gas station. 
You will probably blame the small 
families that had to buy the natural 
gas for their price going higher. 
Somehow 
you 
will 
blame 
Putin 
again, and somehow you will tell the 
American public, no, your price isn’t 
higher; you are actually better off, 
there is zero inflation, even though you 
take home less and everything costs 
more. 
Let me tell you about the future the 
Democrats want for America, the fu-
ture that we can expect if this bill 
passes, much like the one before. 
When wealthy Americans are getting 
tax breaks to buy luxury cars but you 
can’t afford to even fill up your tank, 
blame this bill, blame the Democrats. 
When store shelves are empty be-
cause more American manufacturers 
have gone under, blame this bill, blame 
the Democrats. 
When government agents are knock-
ing at your door and threatening your 
business, blame this bill, blame the 
Democrats. 
And when your loved ones are left 
without the cures they need to fight a 
rare disease, blame this bill, and blame 
the Democrats. 
My friends, that is the exact choice 
for us today. Now, I know a few Demo-
crats showed up. And, hopefully, all 
those who are voting by proxy are 
watching on TV, because they must be 
home sick, because that is what they 
said. I hope they spent the time to read 
it. 
I don’t know if they read the Amer-
ican Rescue Plan, but they know the 
damage they have done. America feels 
it each and every day. 
Madam Speaker, I guess the next 
question would be—it will be inter-
esting to hear the answer from the 
other side. If you think gas is cheaper 
than it was 2 years ago, if you think 
the prices at the grocery store are 
lower than it was 2 years ago, do you 
think the border is more secure than it 
was 2 years ago? 
Someone said yes. 
Madam Speaker, I am going to intro-
duce a bill to rename this place 
fantasyland. I hope when you go home, 
I hope you take the smirks off, and I 
hope you actually read your obituaries 
because fentanyl has now become the 
number one killer of Americans be-
tween the ages of 18 and 45. It is not 
something to smirk about. 
I am sure you got power; you are in 
the majority. But you abuse the power, 
Madam 
Speaker. 
When 
you 
abuse 
power like that, people die. Every walk 
of life, we are seeing it day in and day 
out. 
I remember the headline of six col-
lege kids down in Florida this summer. 
They weren’t in a fraternity. They 
weren’t in a sorority. They were in the 
military academy. Six of them OD’d. 
Four of them took the drug; two did 
not. Two simply gave them mouth to 
mouth. 
You think it is important to double 
the size of the IRS, but you are not 
going to do one thing for the border? 
I remember right after you took the 
power, you took over the House, the 
Senate, and the White House, and you 
decided to change the policies. We 
watched what has come across the bor-
der. I took a trip down there. 
I remember going, talking to the 
agents. They were telling me they have 
never seen anything like this before. I 
said: What do you mean? 
They said: We are catching people on 
the terrorist watch list. I said: What? 
On the terrorist watch list? Really? I 
didn’t know there was that many peo-
ple on the terrorist watch list just 
from the triangle of Central America. 
No, no, no, no, no. We are catching 
them from Yemen. People come from 
160 different countries across this bor-
der now. They bring their fentanyl 
from China. 
I went and did a press conference, 
and I talked about that. 
Madam Speaker, I thought people 
from both sides of the aisle would be 
very concerned about hearing people on 
the terrorist watch list are coming into 
America, knowing what has happened 
in this country before, and we would 
want to keep it safe. 
I was shocked. They didn’t ask me 
for more information. They just simply 
called me a liar. 
b 1600 
We provided the proof. Nobody apolo-
gized. That is okay. You don’t need to 
apologize, but I wish you would do 
something about it. They continued to 
stay silent. Then they fought to even 
get more information. 
But I fear to tell you that that is 
happening each and every day. There is 
not one new piece of money in here to 
secure that any more. That will stop as 
colleges open back up and as college 
students on the weekend go to their 
Snapchat, think they are buying a 
Xanax, and they don’t wake up the 
next morning. But that is okay because 
you just gave a break to one of your 
big donors who makes a lot of money 
and is going to buy an electric car. It 
is okay because you feel good about 
what you are going to do. I guess that 
is why you don’t show up to vote; you 
just vote by proxy. 
A vote for this bill is a vote to help 
the well-connected get further and fur-
ther ahead while leaving needs of hard- 
working American families behind. 
Yet, you could be forgiven for not un-
derstanding the gravity of today’s 
vote. For such a supposedly historic oc-
casion, few Democrats even bothered to 
show up. 
Look around this Chamber, Madam 
Speaker. The floor is nearly empty. 
If Democrats really, truthfully want 
to raise taxes on Americans during a 
recession, that is their choice. That is 
the power they have. They have proven 
it time and again, and they will do it. 
The very least you can do, Madam 
Speaker, is show up in person if you 
are going to vote ‘‘yes.’’ Show up in 
person to the American public. For 
those who chant: ‘‘Yes, gasoline is 
lower than it was 2 years ago; yes, the 
border is safer than it was 2 years ago,’’ 
don’t say it when the cameras are off. 
Don’t say it when people can’t see who 
is saying it. Go to the mikes. If you be-
lieve it, go to the mikes and say it. 
Better yet, tell your district about it 
because they know differently. Amer-
ica knows differently. 
But if you want to vote ‘‘yes,’’ you 
should have the courage and the de-
cency to show up and do that in person. 
Yet, Madam Speaker, Speaker PELOSI 
extended 
proxy 
voting 
again 
on 
Wednesday, 
allowing 
Democrats 
to 
hide their faces and vote to take your 
money from the comfort of their sum-
mer vacations. 
‘‘Absolute 
power 
corrupts 
abso-
lutely,’’ Madam Speaker. That is a fa-
mous quote. 
There are lots of lessons people learn. 
Normally, the lesson you learn the 
most is when you cause the most pain. 
I guess creating inflation you haven’t 
had in 41 years, creating shortages 
where there is no baby formula, gas 
prices that we haven’t seen since 
Jimmy Carter was in office, a border 
that is wide open, a government, 
Madam Speaker, that had an Attorney 
General call parents terrorists be-
cause—what did they do? 
They went to a school board meeting. 
Why would they go? 
Why would parents go to a school 
board meeting? 
Because they wanted to know what 
was happening in their kids’ education, 
the lost learning of the years of the 
pandemic. 
If you question authority, you are 
going to be called a terrorist. 
How far would we go to be able to 
have the rights to do that? 
We are going to find an organization, 
a union, that will send us a letter so we 
can do it. But when the public finds out 
why, the union pulls their letter back. 
But the AG doesn’t pull back their 
power because they have power, they 
should use it. 
Is that why you want to double the 
size of the IRS? 
Is that why you want to double the 
size of the IRS, to go after Americans, 
to use it? 
Earlier today, we had 80 Democrats 
use a proxy vote. As we approach this 
final vote on this bill, depending on 
how long I speak, I expect that number 
might increase. 
If you think about it, that is the 
story of this Democrat majority. They 
will destroy our economy and mort-
gage your future but can’t be person-
ally bothered to show up, to make the 
trip to D.C. to do their jobs. 
What a disgrace. What a disgrace. 
I will promise the American public 
that that will all change. If you run for

office, if you are going to ask them to 
lend their vote and to lend their voice 
to go to Washington for 2 years to rep-
resent them, you are going to show up. 
And do you know what? The bills are 
going to be in committee. The bills are 
going to be read. They are going to be 
debated on the floor, and you are not 
going to hide in your vacation home 
and raise taxes on the American public. 
I will even go further. We will lower 
your gas prices. We will make America 
energy independent. We won’t punish 
natural gas. If you care about the envi-
ronment, American natural gas is 41 
percent cleaner than Russian natural 
gas. We will make an abundance of it. 
So those people who are living on a 
$75,000 income who have watched it get 
dwindled under your leadership, under 
your American Rescue Plan that sim-
ply took a whole month’s salary away 
from them, and where they had no say, 
you celebrated it, you cheered it, and 
then you blamed everybody else for 
what you created. We will tell you it 
will cost less. 
For the parent that wakes up that 
morning—maybe it is a phone call or 
maybe their kid is home, who doesn’t 
wake up because they went out and 
purchased 
something 
that 
wasn’t 
fentanyl 
but 
it 
was 
laced 
with 
fentanyl, we will make sure that stops. 
It is August. Right now is normally 
the time people have barbecues, but 
now the price is high. Now people ques-
tion whether to even get the hotdog 
buns. 
They are going to turn on the TV, 
they are going to watch an empty 
Chamber, and they are going to read 
online that 80 Democrats took that va-
cation and voted to raise more taxes, 
voted to spend more of their money, 
and looked into the camera and smiled 
and said: 
We know best. We want to take more of 
your money because we have got to hire and 
double the size of the IRS because we want 
them to knock on your door because we 
think you are not honest and because we 
think you can pay more. 
And if you don’t, we have got an AG that 
will come after you. If you go to that school 
board meeting, we will look in your eyes, we 
will take your name down, and we will won-
der why you care about your kids’ education. 
Madam Speaker, that will end, too, 
because we are going to provide the 
American public with a parents’ bill of 
rights. We think that parents should 
have a say in their kids’ education. We 
think that parents should know what is 
being 
taught 
at 
their 
children’s 
schools. 
Madam Speaker, I even watched, 
under this leadership, a Democrat who 
voted by proxy who wasn’t even in 
America. 
So I wondered: Were they in another 
country to get healthcare? Were they 
sick? 
No, no, no. They were in France at a 
wedding when they phoned that vote 
in. I wasn’t quite sure. 
Do you think at the wedding the 
Member was reading the bill on the 
phone so that Member knew how to 
vote? 
I am not sure it came through com-
mittee. I don’t know how much debate 
they had on this because the Senate 
did this bill. What a disgrace. 
Madam Speaker, I urge all my col-
leagues to reject this out-of-touch bill, 
reject the crushing new taxes, reject 
the ballooning of government, and re-
ject the spending on things that we 
don’t need with money we don’t have. 
Madam Speaker, I can wait, if you 
need to continue. 
But most of all, I urge my colleagues 
to remember this day. Remember this 
day because it will be the last time the 
House will operate so recklessly and ir-
responsibly. 
A new day is coming with a new plan 
to put America back on the right 
track. It will be a commitment to 
America that there will be fiscal re-
sponsibility and there will be energy 
independence where your gasoline price 
will be lower and plentiful, that your 
home heating costs will lower and not 
rise; and that we won’t pick one energy 
over the other. It will be all of the 
above so America can be stronger. 
Your border will be secure because 
fentanyl and terrorists will not be com-
ing across. This border is a national se-
curity issue. 
We will focus on bringing the supply 
chain from China back to America, 
which is not what this bill does. This 
bill takes American taxpayer money 
and sends it to China. You triple the 
size of the EPA. I imagine China is 
cheering, because they see their econ-
omy is going to rise. Their government 
doesn’t have to vote for a stimulus, be-
cause that is exactly what you are 
doing here. 
What is even greater, China will look 
and say: Well, can we make sure Amer-
ica can send all that money here? 
Don’t worry, the Democrats doubled 
the size of the IRS. They will get that 
money and make sure it comes. 
In the commitment to America, we 
believe people show up to go to work 
and that you earn your paycheck. You 
don’t phone it in. 
Madam Speaker, when I handed the 
gavel to Speaker PELOSI last year, I 
said that a House distracted could not 
govern. Today, as this majority jams 
through yet another partisan spending 
spree, it is clear to me that an absent 
House cannot lead. 
I trust the American people. I know 
it is the people who will render the ul-
timate verdict on today’s actions. 
When they do 87 days from now, my 
Democratic colleagues will have only 
themselves to blame. 
Madam Speaker, I am not sure what 
is happening on your side of the aisle 
that Members actually believe gasoline 
is less than it was 2 years ago. 
Madam Speaker, I am not sure what 
is happening on your side of the aisle 
that your colleagues believe the border 
is more secure than it was 2 years ago. 
Madam Speaker, I am not sure what 
is happening on your side of the aisle 
that your colleagues believe the price 
of groceries is less than it was 2 years 
ago. 
Madam Speaker, I am not sure what 
is happening on the other side of the 
aisle that your colleagues believe dou-
bling the size of the IRS is a positive 
thing. 
b 1615 
Yes, I come from a different party, 
and yes, I have a different philosophy, 
but we are all Americans. Madam 
Speaker, you are going inflict this pain 
on every single American. 
Madam Speaker, I am not sure if 
your side of the aisle thinks this is 
going to do anything to lower the price 
of inflation. I do know, Madam Speak-
er, one person on the other side of the 
aisle in the other Chamber, BERNIE 
SANDERS, spoke the truth and said it 
won’t. 
I know on your side of the aisle, 
Madam Speaker, not everybody be-
lieves the same. The former Secretary 
of the Treasury warned you before you 
did the American Rescue Plan that it 
would bring inflation, and he was right. 
Even the current Secretary of the 
Treasury finally apologized and said 
they were wrong. 
The President said it was going to be 
transitory. He said it had peaked. He 
said it was everybody else’s fault, but 
now he says it is zero. 
Madam Speaker, I guess I do under-
stand why your side of the aisle now 
believes all that. I just know America 
doesn’t. Because every day America 
goes to the grocery store, the price has 
increased. Every week when they fill 
up their gas tank, the price is higher. 
Every month when they cash their 
check, it doesn’t go as far. 
Madam Speaker, if the border was 
really more secure than it was 2 years 
ago, why is the D.C. mayor now asking 
for the National Guard when she 
wouldn’t even ask for it when there 
were riots in the streets? 
Madam Speaker, my colleagues on 
the other side can lie to me, but they 
can’t lie to America. Eighty-seven days 
from now it doesn’t matter how you 
try to answer those questions. The 
American people will. 
I remember when we were at this 
stage once before. We had somebody in 
the White House that put a sweater on 
and told us to turn the heater down, 
that the best days were behind us as 
Americans. 
I watched another person walk to the 
podium and say no pastels, fly the bold 
colors, and go to that shining city on 
the hill. 
We know what America is. And we 
are more than a country. We are an 
idea, an idea so powerful that we can 
overcome all the pain that you have 
caused. 
It won’t be easy. And I will offer this 
invitation. For all the bad votes you 
have taken, when the change comes, we 
will welcome you to correct the mis-
takes you have made. Because you will 
be in committee. Maybe you will learn 
that gas prices are higher. Maybe you 
will learn that groceries cost more. 
You will be here to vote so you will

August 12, 2022 
hear the debate. Maybe I can’t blame 
you for thinking that if you don’t have 
to show up. 
Madam Speaker, there are a lot of 
days on this floor that change the 
course of history. In the last 2 years, 
that history has not been bright. Infla-
tion, a 41-year-history high. Do you un-
derstand what that does to the Amer-
ican public? Do you understand the 
pain that it causes? Do you understand 
the choices that people have to make? 
I heard the story of a young family, 
their daughter has cancer. For her 
treatment they have to drive a long 
way. She was crying one day because 
she heard her parents talking about 
making the decision to take out loans 
they cannot afford to pay for the gaso-
line that your side of the aisle thinks 
costs them less but costs them more, 
the choices they had to make because 
you titled a bill ‘‘American Rescue 
Plan’’ that only inflicts pain, and you 
just doubled down. 
Madam Speaker, I would respect the 
other side of the aisle much greater if 
they would at least do exactly what 
Secretary Yellen did, apologize for 
your mistake and change course. 
Don’t double down. Don’t make the 
same mistake three, four times like 
you are going to do today. At the very 
least—at the very least, if you are 
going to vote ‘‘yes,’’ do it in person. Do 
it in person. Read the bill. Put it 
through committee. 
Madam Speaker, I have watched this 
body take on big issues. We have got 
some of the biggest issues before us 
today. You continue to make it just a 
partisan action, one that even your 
side of the aisle has warned you 
against. But somehow you want to cel-
ebrate it. 
Madam Speaker, in my office in a 
conference room, I have this painting 
of Washington crossing the Delaware. 
You all know the famous painting. It 
sits 8 feet by 16 feet. If you study his-
tory, you will know that it happened 
Christmas 1776. The artist who painted 
that 
famous 
painting 
wasn’t 
even 
American. He wasn’t there. He had no 
iPhone that day to take a photo. The 
person who painted the painting is a 
German immigrant who lived in Amer-
ica but went back to Germany. His 
name is Emanuel Leutze. 
Do you know why he painted that 
painting? Because he understood Amer-
ica was more than a country, that 
America was an idea. He wanted Ger-
many to have a revolution based upon 
the values of America, of freedom, of 
individual rights, of a stand against 
tyranny, that government would be of 
the people, by the people, for the peo-
ple. 
His talent was art, so he thought he 
would paint this painting to inspire the 
Germans to have this revolution. Now, 
historians will tell you he gets it incor-
rect. He puts 13 people in a rowboat. 
Why would he pick the number 13? 
Thirteen colonies. But he only shows 
you 12 faces. 
If you look at the painting, he puts 
Washington in a rowboat, but histo-
rians will tell you Washington prob-
ably crossed in a Durham boat. If you 
look at the Delaware, it kind of looks 
like the Rhine. But he is German. We 
will give him a break for that. He puts 
Washington in a ceremonial uniform 
with his hand on his chest standing up 
in a rowboat crossing the Delaware in 
the middle of winter. He looks so stoic. 
If you look at Washington in that 
painting, you would almost say you 
would follow this man anywhere. You 
would think he had never lost a battle 
or a fight. But for the students of his-
tory, they understand at that moment 
in time, Washington had never won a 
battle. We had never won one fight as 
a country. But that was our first vic-
tory, as we surprised the Hessians. 
But what I would like you to see next 
time is who is in the boat. The second 
person is wearing a beret. He is Scot-
tish. The person directly across from 
him in the green jacket, he is African 
American. You come down the boat, 
and in the middle of the boat, the per-
son who almost looks the strongest, 
rowing in the red, is a woman. In the 
very back, the very last person, is a 
Native American. 
I cannot tell you from a historical 
point of view if they were in the boat 
that night. But to this young immi-
grant who had lived in America, that is 
who he believed would be in the boat. 
Now, the second to last person in the 
boat, he has a hand across his face. It 
is the hand of the 13th person nobody 
sees. What this artist was saying— 
Emanuel, I believe—Here we are, not a 
country but an idea, having lost every 
battle before but willing to create a 
Nation. Why? To go against the tyr-
anny of a government that will tax you 
with no say, a government that became 
so big it can inflict pain upon you, tell 
you what to do, that we would risk it 
on our holiest of night. 
Here is a hand. Would you get in and 
join us? 
That is as true today as it was then. 
The challenge that we face right now is 
you are making that government big. 
You are doubling the size of the IRS. 
You are going against every single rea-
son people were in that boat willing to 
risk their lives for a government of the 
people, by the people, for the people, a 
government that was created in a 
country that was conceived in liberty 
and dedicated to the proposition that 
we are all equal, because you think you 
know what is best. 
I can only imagine what those indi-
viduals would think today, that you 
would put a bill on the floor that didn’t 
go through committee. You put a bill 
on the floor that would double the size 
of the IRS, that could go after the 
American public, that has no set on an 
income, that 710,000 people under the 
income of $75,000 are now going to be 
audited because you want them to pay 
for what you think is best, that you’re 
going to tax, with no limit on income, 
some 
family 
that 
already 
lost 
a 
month’s salary based upon your past 
actions because of inflation. 
You are going to make them choose 
how cold. You are going back to 
Jimmy Carter. You are simply telling 
the American public to put that sweat-
er on, turn that heater down. But to 
your elite donors, you are going to give 
them the tax credit from those IRS 
agents so they can go buy a new Tesla. 
That is what you are doing in this bill. 
But 4 to 6 months from now, you will 
blame somebody else for it. The good 
news is, there will be a new Congress 
with a new ability to change all that, 
that will provide the American public a 
commitment to America, a new plan to 
put this country back in the right di-
rection. 
Madam Speaker, with whatever hap-
pens today—and I can only guess, if 
you have all the votes in your pocket 
that people don’t have to show up, one 
or two people can determine the out-
come. But, Madam Speaker, I implore 
upon you—I don’t know what happens 
in your conference—please allow the 
American public to come in to simply 
tell you and explain to you that, no, 
gas is not lower, groceries do not cost 
less, and the money does not go as far 
as it did before. 
Maybe that is why I can only under-
stand, if you truly believe that, that 
you would vote ‘‘yes.’’ For everybody 
else that is living in the real America, 
they will vote ‘‘no.’’ And 87 days from 
now, I believe most of America will 
have the answer to that question, too, 
with a new Congress and a new plan. 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, may 
I inquire how much time is remaining? 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Ms. JA-
COBS
of California). The gentleman 
from New Jersey has 3 minutes remain-
ing. The time of the gentleman from 
Kentucky has expired. 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself 1 minute. 
I will speak briefly before I introduce 
our two leaders who have done so much 
on the Democratic side to make this 
bill a possibility today. The Republican 
leader said that we should listen to our 
constituents. Well, we have. 
Yesterday, I was at a senior center in 
Woodbridge, and a woman came up to 
me and said: You know, Congressman 
PALLONE, I spend $1,500 a month on pre-
scription drugs. And I was able to say 
to her: I am going to be in Washington 
tomorrow. I am going to vote on a bill 
that is going to cap your expenditures 
at $2,000 a year. 
Then I had another woman in a tele-
health meeting earlier in the week who 
told me that she was so hot, because in 
New Jersey we have had the worst 
drought and the highest temperatures 
that we know in years, and she said: I 
have to go to a cooling center because 
of the heat, because of my health and 
the impact on my health. 
b 1630 
I was able to say to her: Look, it is 
going to take a while, but tomorrow— 
this Friday—I am going to vote on a 
bill that is going to address the climate 
change and the heating and the warm-
ing of this planet.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H7695 
August 12, 2022 
Madam Speaker, I want to thank our 
two leaders for what they have done to 
bring this about today. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to 
the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. 
HOYER). 
Mr. 
HOYER. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
I 
thank the gentleman for yielding. 
Today will be the culmination of the 
meeting of promises that President 
Biden made to the American people re-
sulting in some 7 to 8 million more peo-
ple voting for President Biden than the 
incumbent President. 
My colleagues, we have just heard 
from the leader of the party of: You are 
on your own. 
The leader who just spoke voted 
against the American Rescue Plan that 
put money in the pockets of American 
families, put American children back 
to school, and resulted in our not wear-
ing masks today by—with some excep-
tions—putting vaccine in arms. 
The leader who just spoke voted 
‘‘no,’’ as did every one of his col-
leagues. They said ‘‘no’’ to money to 
help families not fall through the 
cracks, to help them afford their gro-
ceries, to help them afford to pay their 
mortgage, and to send their kids to 
school. 
They voted ‘‘no’’ to make sure those 
vaccines were in arms. 
They voted ‘‘no’’ to help small busi-
nesses, restaurants, and others be lift-
ed up. The party of: You are on your 
own, America. 
And yes, when they came to office, 
what did they try to do in 2017? 
Repeal healthcare support for the 
American people. 
We are doing the opposite. We plead 
guilty. 
The leader of the Republican Party 
who just spoke voted ‘‘no’’ on the in-
frastructure bill to respond to building 
roads and bridges and to making sure 
they are maintained and safe; to re-
spond to broadband to make sure that 
rural areas are connected, and with air-
ports to make sure we had a grid that 
made us competitive. 
The gentleman who just spoke voted 
‘‘no.’’ 
As far as the CHIPS bill, the gen-
tleman talked about China. China was 
lobbying against the CHIPS bill. The 
minority leader voted ‘‘no’’ on the 
CHIPS bill, which was a bill to make 
America competitive and create hun-
dreds of thousands of jobs. That was bi-
partisan in the House by a small degree 
and in the Senate, as well. But the mi-
nority leader voted ‘‘no.’’ 
So I must say that I am not shocked 
that he is voting ‘‘no’’ on this bill, 
which is aimed at helping Americans 
with their healthcare, which is one of 
the greatest reasons for inflation. 
I 
am 
not 
surprised 
that 
he 
mischaracterized the reaction on this 
side of the aisle when he said gas prices 
were high and haven’t come down. In 
fact, in the last 40 days, they have 
come down 20 percent. 
The gentleman is shaking his head, 
no, no, they haven’t. I don’t know 
where he is buying gas, but they have 
come down from $5 to $4, and in some 
cases less than $4. 
Is that too high? 
Yes, it is. 
Should we be concerned about that? 
Yes, we should be. 
We passed two bills. One was a bill to 
make sure that we didn’t have price 
gouging. No American wants to see 
price gouging. 
The minority leader voted ‘‘no’’ on 
that bill. 
We offered another bill that dealt 
with food and fuel prices and to try to 
make sure that we have delivery sys-
tems and supply chains that worked. 
The minority leader and his col-
leagues voted ‘‘no’’—not everyone. 
We had a bill on this floor that tried 
to help and is going to help millions of 
veterans who had been exposed to toxic 
burn pits—cancer, heart disease, and 
lung disease. The minority leader, it 
will not shock you, voted ‘‘no’’ to help 
veterans. 
We had another bill on the floor to 
make sure that we could preclude and 
try to help women who had violent acts 
committed against them. It may not 
surprise you that the leader of the 
party of: You are on your own voted 
‘‘no’’ on the Violence Against Women 
Act. 
It is time to say ‘‘yes,’’ yes to the 
people, to focus on people and not on 
the politics of 87 days from now. 
That is what this is about: politics 
pure—well, impure—and simple. 
It is time for us to say ‘‘yes’’ to 
bringing prices down. 
Now, I want to add just a couple of 
things, and I want to talk about the 
four pieces of legislation that are 
changing America for the better. 
He wrings his hands about the awful 
situation that America is in. 
In January of 2021, before Joe Biden 
became President of the United States, 
unemployment was 6.4 percent. During 
the course of the Trump administra-
tion, we had lost 2.8 million jobs; a net 
loss after 4 years—net loss. 
Over the last 18 months, we have cre-
ated 9.5 million jobs. That is almost a 
12 million-job turnaround, to the best, 
to the good, to the appreciation of abil-
ity of Americans to get jobs. 
And he mentioned something about 
gas prices. 
Are they high? 
They are. 
Let me tell you when they were high-
er. In July of 2008 they were higher. 
Hear me. Go check the records. $4.14, 
which in real dollars today would be 
$5.62 under George Bush. 
Are prices too high? 
They are. 
Do we want to bring them down? 
Yes, we do. That is why we fought 
price gouging on food and fuel, both of 
which 
the 
minority 
leader 
voted 
against. 
As I said, unemployment in January 
was 6.4 percent. It is now 3.5 percent; 
halved. 
Is inflation too high? 
It is. 
We passed a bill. Some people said, 
Well, that is going to cause inflation. 
What it caused was people didn’t fall 
through the cracks. They were able to 
pay their bills. They were able to send 
their kids back to school. That is what 
it did. That is what the American peo-
ple are going to remember, that the 
Democratic Party was there for them 
and the Republican Party was not. 
Then we talk about this money that 
we are going to give to IRS, which has 
been reduced 20 percent under the Re-
publican leadership when they were in 
charge. 
What did they reduce? 
Enforcement. 
Why? 
Because they didn’t want their big, 
fat cat people to be caught not paying 
their fair share. 
Yes, Mr. and Mrs. America, you are 
paying a higher price because some 
people pay nothing. You don’t think 
that is fair, and we don’t think it is 
fair. And, yes, we want to make sure 
the rules are followed. 
In order to have the rules followed, 
you need referees. And when you have 
100-some-odd million taxpayers, you 
need a number of people to find that 
out and make sure that you obey the 
law. 
Yes, we support that. We believe in 
facts, and we believe in truth. 
There is a Republican leader—no 
longer a leader—who believed in facts 
and truth, and LIZ CHENEY was fired 
from her position because she told the 
truth and confronted a former Presi-
dent who promotes lying. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
when 
President 
Biden took office with a Democratic 
Congress, we promised the American 
people results. We are delivering. We 
promised we would make progress on 
the issues where progress has been 
stalled for far too long. We promised, 
in short, responsible government that 
gets things done ‘‘for the people.’’ Peo-
ple, not politics. We promised respon-
sible government that puts the needs of 
our people over politics. 
Over the past 18 months, many have 
questioned whether that would even be 
possible. Our country is too divided, 
they said, to achieve big goals and 
enact really consequential legislation 
that benefits the American people and 
our economy. 
Madam Speaker, 9.5 million new jobs 
in 18 months. 
Over these same 18 months, however, 
our Democratic majorities and the 
Biden-Harris administration have prov-
en those doubters wrong. 
The legislation we will pass today 
and send to the President’s desk is the 
fourth leg of a table of support and op-
portunity Democrats have built for the 
American people. 
The first leg was the American Res-
cue Plan. That law put more than 200 
million shots in arms and made it safe 
again for workers to go back to their 
jobs, for students and teachers to go 
back to school, and for entrepreneurs

August 12, 2022 
to take risks and invest in their busi-
nesses. It worked. 
Since then, we have seen record job 
growth. As I have said, 9.5 million jobs 
have been created since last January. 
That is the largest number of jobs cre-
ated in 18 months in the history of our 
country and the lowest rate of employ-
ment in half a century. Only Repub-
licans could call that failure, because 
it wasn’t their success. 
More Americans are working today 
than at any point in our history. We 
also cut child poverty in half. Perhaps 
that is not seen as a success by the 
other side of the aisle. 
Next, we brought Democrats and Re-
publicans together in a historic effort 
to enact the bipartisan infrastructure 
plan, which is already rebuilding roads, 
bridges, transit systems, seaports, and 
airports in every corner of our country, 
after President Trump said in 2016 that 
he was going to do a trillion dollars. 
In 2017 it didn’t happen. In 2018 it 
didn’t happen. In 2019 it didn’t happen. 
The Republicans were in charge of 
the House, Senate, and the Presidency 
of the United States. 
Inattention and disrepair. For years, 
we heard people talking about ‘‘infra-
structure weeks.’’ 
Do you remember that? 
The minority leader and others: We 
are going to have an infrastructure 
week. 
It never happened. 
Last November, we put people over 
politics and got it done. That decision 
was so successful that even many of 
the Republicans who voted against it 
are cutting ribbons that will facilitate 
commerce and improve the lives of 
their constituents, even though they 
didn’t support the bill. 
One side effect of the pandemic was 
to magnify the cracks in our economic 
system and our reliance on the unreli-
able in our supply chains. 
Any family trying to buy a new car 
or trying to budget for a new appliance 
in the last year or two understands 
what that means. 
And by the way, on inflation, Europe 
didn’t have the rescue plan. Asia didn’t 
have the rescue plan. Other nations 
didn’t have the rescue plan. 
Guess what, Madam Speaker? 
All of them are experiencing infla-
tion, half of them greater inflation 
than is present in the United States of 
America. 
Does that mean we have to stop our 
efforts to reduce it? 
Of course not. 
Is it hurting our people? 
It is. 
Are empty shelves on grocery stores 
troubling? 
They are. 
b 1645 
Rather than blame one another, per-
haps we ought to look at the real vil-
lain, and that was the pandemic. 
Earlier this week, President Biden 
signed the CHIPS and Science Act, the 
third leg of our table of support and op-
portunity, into law. 
That bipartisan legislation will ease 
inflation by bringing manufacturing 
and sources of critical components and 
products back to the United States so 
that we make them in America, and 
our workers make it in America. 
It means that we won’t cede the next 
century of innovation to China or any-
body else. China—let me repeat—lob-
bied against that bill, and almost every 
Republican voted against that bill, just 
like China wanted. 
Instead, American labor and Amer-
ican innovation will continue to lead 
the world in research, innovation, and 
advanced manufacturing and continue 
to draw the brightest minds from 
around the world. That also will mean 
lower costs for American families. 
The CHIPS and Science Act was an-
other significant piece of legislation 
under the Make It In America agenda. 
It is hard to think that somebody 
would vote against all four of these 
bills—a promise made to America and 
a promise that they relied on and they 
voted for in an election—not a poll, not 
a survey, and not a focus group—in an 
election. 
That is because it gets to the heart of 
what government is supposed to do: 
help provide our workers, businesses, 
and people with the tools and con-
fidence to make it in America. 
Today, we are going to send to Presi-
dent Biden the legislation that rep-
resents the fourth leg of our table of 
support and opportunity: the Inflation 
Reduction Act. As its name suggests, it 
will further help lower costs for Ameri-
cans. 
First, it will lower healthcare costs 
by extending the cost-saving premium 
tax credits under the Affordable Care 
Act that we included in the American 
Rescue Plan, which has gotten us to 92 
percent coverage in America. And, very 
frankly, it would be higher if there 
weren’t States who had refused to pro-
vide the Medicaid opportunity for citi-
zens who fell in the middle of the in-
come spectrum. 
We included that, of course, but our 
Republican friends in the United States 
Senate would not agree to it. This bill 
will provide for quality, affordable 
healthcare to almost every person in 
the United States, irrespective of their 
income. 
The national uninsured rate has fall-
en, as I said, to an all-time low of 8 per-
cent, with 5.2 million Americans gain-
ing coverage since the start of the 
Biden-Harris administration—in large 
part due to having made those cost- 
saving premium tax credits more wide-
ly available. 
My understanding is our Republican 
friends are going to vote against this 
bill. Millions of people will be unable 
to afford their insurance. That is ex-
tended by 3 years. 
Next, it brings down the cost of pre-
scription drugs by allowing Medicare 
for the first time ever—but not unique-
ly because the Veterans Affairs does 
that, and it makes sense—to negotiate 
lower prices from manufacturers. 
Democrats have been working for 
decades to achieve this goal. As I men-
tioned at the outset of my remarks, 
our majority is delivering on that 
promise. 
The bill also caps the cost of insulin 
at $35 a month. It would have been ex-
tended to everybody, but our Repub-
lican friends refuse to support that al-
ternative, so it is only going to apply 
to Medicare at the beginning. We are 
not going to stop. We also capped the 
cost at $2,000 a year for seniors on 
Medicare. We want to extend that to 
the private market as well, and we will 
work on that. 
Madam Speaker, this is a historic 
achievement that will save lives and 
allow more seniors to access life-saving 
and life-sustaining medications. 
Additionally, the Inflation Reduction 
Act is the largest single investment ad-
dressing the climate crisis that any na-
tion has ever made. I don’t know how 
it was at your place, but with tempera-
tures of 95, 96, 97, and 98 degrees and 
high humidity, we have a climate cri-
sis. The deniers have undermined our 
ability to respond. This bill responds. 
It responds consistent with the desires 
of the American people. 
It will bring down the cost of energy 
for Americans by investing in devel-
oping and deploying cleaner, more sus-
tainable energy technologies like elec-
tric vehicles and solar panels. 
At the same time, we are doing it 
without raising the deficit. In fact, the 
legislation reduces the deficit by clos-
ing loopholes so the largest corpora-
tions with profits over a billion dollars 
will pay a minimum tax rate of just 15 
percent. The rate is 21 percent on cor-
porations, but if they get over a billion 
dollars, they are going to pay at least 
15 percent. Why? Because we protect 
their shipping lanes with our Navy. We 
protect their roads that they transport 
goods across. They get a lot from their 
taxes, just as we all do. Maybe that is 
why the Republicans don’t like this 
bill. 
That is well below the regular 21 per-
cent tax, as I said. We do it all while 
ensuring that individuals and families 
earning less than $400,000 a year won’t 
see a single tax increase. Let me repeat 
that. Nobody making less than $400,000 
a year will see a tax increase. 
Those four legs: the rescue plan, the 
infrastructure bill, the CHIPS bill, and 
now this reduction in inflation act will 
provide for growth, opportunity, and 
competitiveness for our economy and 
for our people. 
There is, however, another critical 
piece of legislation that helps keep 
that table sturdy. Let us recap this list 
of major enactments: 
Getting Americans back to work 
from the pandemic. That is what we 
did. 
Securing long-overdue infrastructure 
investments. That is what we did. 
Easing 
the 
inflation 
by 
helping 
American companies build more chips, 
semiconductors, 
and 
other 
critical 
components here instead of importing

them from unreliable countries. Over 
100,000 new jobs. That is what we did. 
Reducing 
inflation 
by 
lowering 
healthcare prescription drug and en-
ergy costs while combating the climate 
crisis. That is what we did. We will 
keep on doing it for the American peo-
ple in the next Congress. 
In addition to all these, the Demo-
crat-led House has passed many, many 
more important bills that have yet to 
be considered in the Senate—blocked 
by Republicans. 
Today, with the Inflation Reduction 
Act, we will answer any who still doubt 
whether we can deliver on our prom-
ises. 
Today, Democrats and this adminis-
tration are showing that we can and 
will continue to put people over poli-
tics and ensure that our people can 
make it in America. Vote for America. 
Vote for the American people. Vote for 
this bill. 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, to 
close the debate, I yield 1 minute to 
the gentlewoman from California (Ms. 
PELOSI), the Speaker of the House, who 
has done so much to bring this bill to 
final passage today. 
Ms. 
PELOSI. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
I 
thank you for your tremendous leader-
ship and the other chairs for bringing 
this legislation to the floor. 
The hour is growing late, and as a 
courtesy to my colleagues, I intend to 
shorten my remarks. For those that I 
shorten the remarks, I promise to put 
them in the RECORD if you promise to 
read them. 
Let me also begin by saying that I 
associate myself with the remarks of 
all of my Democratic colleagues, and 
that covers a lot of territory. 
Madam Speaker, under the visionary 
leadership of President Biden, Demo-
crats have forged historic progress for 
America’s families. 
First, we enacted our life-saving 
American Rescue Plan: to propel us out 
of the pandemic by putting money in 
pockets, vaccines in arms, children 
safely in school, and people back to 
work. 
Next, we secured the transformative 
bipartisan infrastructure package to 
create good-paying union jobs rebuild-
ing our Nation. 
This week, President Biden signed 
the CHIPS and Science Act, which de-
clares 
our 
economic 
independence, 
strengthens our national security, and 
enhances our families’ financial future. 
We also honored the valiant service of 
our men and women in uniform with 
the PACT Act. 
Today, Madam Speaker, is a day of 
celebration, a day we take another 
giant step in our momentous agenda. 
Our Inflation Reduction Act is a ro-
bust, cost-cutting package that meets 
the moment: ensuring that our families 
thrive and that our planet survives. 
This is landmark legislation which 
we send to the President’s desk, and it 
is a resounding victory for America’s 
families 
starting 
at 
their 
kitchen 
table. What it means to you—to our 
constituents, to people out there whom 
we serve in terms of healthcare—if you 
are one of Medicare’s 64 million enroll-
ees, this bill brings down the out-of- 
pocket costs in prescription drugs. 
We do this by empowering the Sec-
retary of HHS to negotiate lower 
prices, at long last. We have been fight-
ing for this for years. We do so by cap-
ping out-of-pocket prescription drug 
costs. And you, our constituents, will 
not pay one more cent for life-saving 
medication. This includes a $35 cap on 
insulin copays. 
We do this by banning drug manufac-
turers from raising prices faster than 
inflation, protecting you against preda-
tory price hikes. Make no mistake: 
these measures are a big blow to Big 
Pharma, which has had a stranglehold 
for decades, preventing us from making 
this move. Now we have relaxed that 
stranglehold a bit—there is more to be 
done—but we give more leverage and 
more breathing room to America’s 
families. 
At the same time, this bill locks in 
lower premiums that Democrats se-
cured first in the rescue package. To-
gether, lowering the cost of prescrip-
tion drugs and healthcare premiums 
are vital strides in our fight for eco-
nomic justice. This is particularly im-
portant to low-income communities, 
underserved communities, and commu-
nities of color. 
In doing so, we honor the call of Dr. 
King, who said: ‘‘Of all the forms of in-
equality, injustice in health is the 
most shocking and the most inhumane 
because it often results in physical 
death.’’ 
The inflation bill is a plan divided 
into three parts: Prescription drugs 
and healthcare; second, the most con-
sequential climate action in the his-
tory of our Congress of our country. 
Doing these two things will reduce the 
deficit. At the same time, this legisla-
tion advances President Biden’s and 
Democrats’ relentless commitment to 
putting justice first. 
All of these crucial investments are 
fully paid for by making sure the ultra- 
rich and biggest corporations pay their 
fair share. 
The climate provisions will make a 
meaningful difference for America’s 
working families. I am going to put 
that in the RECORD, if you promise to 
read it, but it is about clean air and 
clean water for our children. It is about 
9 million good-paying union jobs. It is 
about preventing conflict over re-
sources and habitat. It is about val-
ues—values espoused by Pope Francis 
when he said earlier this summer that 
our planet has reached a ‘‘breaking 
point’’ in the fight against climate cri-
sis. Extreme weather continues to 
wreak havoc across the country and 
around the world, and it is clear the 
costs of inaction far outweigh the costs 
of action. 
The bill saves the planet while keep-
ing more money in your pockets. For 
working families, you will save an av-
erage of $1,000 a year and lower energy 
bills. For underserved communities, 
this bill invests $60 billion in environ-
mental justice initiatives to ensure 
that everyone enjoys the benefits of a 
cleaner, green economy. 
b 1700 
Again, the bill pays down the deficit 
by $300 billion in the first decade. 
Here is what it means to you: it low-
ers the deficit and drives down infla-
tion in the long term. 
These monumental investments for 
families and healthcare are fully paid 
for ensuring the biggest corporations 
and wealthiest pay their fair share. 
That is an estimate of about $160 bil-
lion a year of taxes that are unlawfully 
not paid. Right now families are being 
harmed by corporate profiteering. 
But let me just say that I don’t want 
you to take it from me. I want you to 
take it from a large number of econo-
mists—126—including 
seven 
Nobel 
Prize winners and three former chairs 
of the Council of Economic Advisers in 
a letter urging passage of this bill. 
I want you to hear this, my Repub-
lican friends, because clearly you don’t 
know this. But now that you do, per-
haps you will change your comments. 
These investments will fight infla-
tion and lower costs for American fam-
ilies while setting the stage for strong, 
stable, and broadly-shared, long-term 
economic growth. 
Madam Speaker, I include in the 
RECORD their letter.

DEAR SENATE MAJORITY LEADER SCHUMER, 
SENATE
MINORITY
LEADER
MCCONNELL, 
SPEAKER PELOSI, AND HOUSE MINORITY LEAD-
ER MCCARTHY: We write to strongly urge you 
and your colleagues in Congress to swiftly 
pass the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022. This 
historic legislation makes crucial invest-
ments in energy, health care, and in shoring 
up the nation’s tax system. These invest-
ments will fight inflation and lower costs for 
American families while setting the stage 
for strong, stable, and broadly-shared long- 
term economic growth. 
This legislation represents the single big-
gest step to date in tackling the climate cri-
sis. It makes key investments to incentivize 
the transition to cleaner energy sources and 
greater efficiency. It also invests in the cur-
rent energy distribution system to make it 
more resilient, lowers energy costs for fami-
lies, and helps protect U.S. family budgets 
against future shocks. 
This legislation will quickly and notice-
ably bring down health care costs for fami-
lies. It allows Medicare to negotiate lower 
prices with pharmaceutical companies, re-
duces Medicare out-of-pocket costs for drugs, 
and reduces insurance costs for 13 million 
Americans by building on provisions in the 
Affordable Care Act.

These investments would be more than 
fully paid for. The revenue raised to finance 
them would come exclusively from wealthy 
individuals and corporations. Further, the 
revenue stems from enhanced tax enforce-
ment 
and 
closing 
some 
of 
the 
most 
distortionary loopholes in the tax code. 
This proposal addresses some of the coun-
try’s biggest challenges at a significant 
scale. And because it is deficit-reducing, it 
does so while putting downward pressure on 
inflation. We strongly recommend Congress 
act decisively to build a stronger economy 
by passing the Inflation Reduction Act as 
soon as possible.

Ms. PELOSI. Another point I want to 
make is I hear them saying that this is 
going to be such a thing about the au-
dits. Despite the Republicans’ des-
perate falsehoods, this bill does not in-
crease IRS audits on America’s work-
ing families. The IRS commissioner 
himself, a Republican appointed by 
Donald Trump, said these resources are 
absolutely not about increasing audit 
scrutiny on small businesses or middle- 
income Americans. 
So there you have it. 
So I would just say at the end of all 
of this, I ask these questions: 
When you hear about what this 
means to America’s working families, 
how can you vote against lowering 
healthcare costs and prescription drugs 
costs for seniors and underserved com-
munities as we continue to fight infla-
tion? 
How can you vote with pharma at the 
cost of America’s seniors and Amer-
ica’s working families? 
How can you vote against protecting 
future generations from rising sea lev-
els, raging wildfires, and crippling 
drought? 
How can you vote against reducing 
the deficit and asking billionaires, 
companies, and wealthy avoiders of 
taxes to pay their fair share? 
I am not talking about people who 
work the system. I am talking about 
people who illegally do not pay their 
taxes. 
So, Madam Speaker, every Member 
of this body is confronted with a 
choice. We either put people over poli-
tics or politics over people. For cen-
turies, Members of Congress have stood 
exactly where we stand facing the 
exact same decision as they con-
structed the pillars of America’s econ-
omy and safety: Social Security, Medi-
care, Medicaid, and the Affordable Care 
Act, things that the Republicans op-
posed all along the way. 
This bill, the Inflation Reduction 
Act, a package for the people, increases 
the leverage of the public interest over 
special interests and expands the prom-
ise of health and financial security now 
and for generations to come. 
Madam Speaker, I urge every Mem-
ber 
to 
put 
aside 
their 
misunder-
standing of this and vote for the Infla-
tion Reduction Act as we send this his-
toric legislation to President Biden’s 
desk for signature this evening for him 
to sign into law. 
Madam Speaker, under the visionary leader-
ship of President Biden, Democrats have 
forged historic progress for America’s families. 
First, we enacted our life-saving American 
Rescue Plan: to propel us out of the pandemic 
by putting money in pockets, vaccines in 
arms, children safely back to school and peo-
ple safely back to work. 
Next, we secured a transformative Infra-
structure package: to create good-paying 
union jobs rebuilding our nation—in a way that 
strengthens our middle class, advances justice 
and protects the environment. 
This week, President Biden signed the 
CHIPS and Science Act, which declares our 
economic independence, strengthens our na-
tional security and enhances our families’ fi-
nancial future. We also honored the valiant 
service of our heroic veterans with the PACT 
Act. 
And today, we proudly take another giant 
step in our momentous agenda. 
Our Inflation Reduction Act is a robust cost- 
cutting package that meets this moment: en-
suring that our families thrive and that our 
planet survives.

August 12, 2022 
HEALTH CARE: PRESCRIPTION DRUGS 
This landmark legislation, which we send to 
the President’s desk today, is a resounding 
victory for America’s families—starting at the 
kitchen table. 
Here’s what the Inflation Reduction Act 
means to you in terms of health care. 
If you are one of Medicare’s 64 million en-
rollees, this bill will bring down your out-of- 
pocket costs for prescription drugs. 
We do so by empowering the HHS Sec-
retary to negotiate for lower drug prices—a 
long-standing House Democratic priority. 
We do so by capping your out-of-pocket 
prescription drug costs at $2,000, so you will 
not pay one cent more for life-saving medica-
tion. This includes a $35 per month cap on in-
sulin co-pays. 
And we do so by banning drug manufac-
tures from raising prices faster than inflation, 
protecting you against predatory price hikes. 
Make no mistake: these provisions will strike 
a big blow to Big Pharma, while giving families 
more breathing room in their budgets. 
HEALTH CARE: ACA SUBSIDIES 
At the same time, the Inflation Reduction 
Act also locks in lower premiums that Demo-
crats secured in our Rescue package. 
If you are one of 13 million working Ameri-
cans who has affordable coverage under the 
ACA: you’ll be able to keep your insurance— 
and you’ll continue to save $800 per year on 
your premium. 
Together, lowering the costs of prescription 
drugs and health premiums are vital strides in 
the fight for economic justice. 
Indeed, these benefits will flow heavily to 
those most in need: vulnerable seniors, under-
served communities and communities of color. 
And in doing so, we honor the call of Dr. 
King, who said: ‘‘Of all the forms of inequality, 
injustice in health is the most shocking and in-
human because it often results in physical 
death.’’ 
IRA OVERVIEW 
The Inflation Reduction Act is a plan divided 
into three parts: 
first—as I just discussed—lowering the cost 
of prescription drugs and health care pre-
miums 
second, delivering the most consequential 
climate action in history 
and third, dramatically reducing the deficit. 
At the same time, this legislation advances 
President Biden and Democrats’ relentless 
commitment to putting justice first. 
And all of these crucial investments are fully 
paid-for by making sure the ultra-rich and big-
gest corporations pay their fair share. 
To my House Democratic colleagues, make 
no mistake: this important progress rests on 
the foundation that we built—with the Build 
Back Better Act last fall and in the last Con-
gress. 
So let us salute the tenacious and tireless 
leadership of our Chairs, Members and staff, 
who helped make this joyous day possible. 
CLIMATE ACTION 
The climate provisions in the Inflation Re-
duction Act will also make a meaningful dif-
ference for America’s working families. 
Our bill cuts carbon pollution by 40 percent 
by 2030—and powers our nation toward a 
clean energy future. 
It’s about health: clean air and clean water 
for our children 
It’s about jobs: 9 million good-paying union 
jobs 
It’s about security: preventing conflict over 
resources and habitat 
And it’s about values: passing on a healthy 
planet to future generations 
As Pope Francis said earlier this summer, 
our planet has reached a ‘‘breaking point’’ in 
the fight against the climate crisis. As extreme 
weather continues to wreak havoc across our 
country and around the world, it is clear the 
costs of inaction far outweigh the costs of ac-
tion. 
This bill saves the planet, while keeping 
more money in your pockets. 
For working families: you’ll save an average 
of $1000 per year on your energy bills by the 
end of the decade. 
For our farmers: this bill supports you in cul-
tivating a diverse, climate-friendly agriculture 
system—which will help address food inflation. 
For underserved communities: this bill in-
vests $60 billion in environmental justice initia-
tives to ensure everyone will share in the ben-
efits of our transition to a cleaner, greener 
economy. 
In doing so, we ensure we not only mitigate 
a far more catastrophic future—but build a 
safe, sustainable planet for our children and 
grandchildren. 
DEFICIT REDUCTION 
America’s working families will also 
greatly benefit from the Inflation Re-
duction Act’s historic investment to 
get our fiscal house in order. 
This bill pays down the deficit by 
$300 billion over the first decade. 
And nonpartisan analysis shows that 
it will reduce the deficit by nearly $2 
trillion over two decades decade. 
Here’s what that means to you: slash-
ing the deficit will drive down inflation 
in the long-term. 
This builds on the progress Demo-
crats have already forged: with our na-
tion on track to slash the deficit by a 
record $1.5 trillion this year alone. 
Meanwhile, Democrats’ record of fis-
cal responsibility stands in sharp con-
trast to the Trump Tax Scam, which 
ballooned the deficit by nearly $2 tril-
lion and left working families behind. 
PAYING THEIR FAIR SHARE 
These monumental investments for 
our families—in health care, climate 
action and deficit reduction—are fully 
paid for by ensuring the biggest cor-
porations and the wealthiest few pay 
their fair share. 
Right now, families are being harmed 
by corporate profiteering with impu-
nity: billion-dollar companies paying 
little-to-no taxes, while jacking up 
prices and refusing to fairly pay their 
workers. 
That’s why we’re closing loopholes 
by implementing: a 15 percent cor-
porate minimum tax only on billion- 
dolar companies; and a 1 percent tax on 
stock buybacks, which enrich execu-
tives and shareholders. 
We’re also taking on ultra-rich tax 
cheats, ensuring they can’t continue to 
dodge what they owe to our nation: an 
estimated $160 billion each year. 
Let me be clear: this bill does not 
raise taxes on anyone making less than 
$400,000 a year, honoring the Presi-
dent’s promise to America’s families. 
And despite Republicans’ desperate 
falsehoods, this bill does not increase 
IRS audits on America’s working fami-
lies. 
Treasury Secretary Yellen has di-
rected the IRS Commissioner not to in-
crease the audit rate for households 
making under $400,000 a year. 
And the IRS Commissioner himself— 
a Republican appointed by Trump— 
said: ‘‘These resources are absolutely 
not about increasing audit scrutiny on 
small 
businesses 
or 
middle-income 
Americans.’’ 
FIGHTING INFLATION 
The provisions in this legislation are 
a powerful force to fight inflation. 
It is encouraging that prices at the 
pump have fallen for nearly sixty days 
straight—and that the latest data 
shows 0 percent inflation in July. 
But Democrats know that higher 
prices still weigh heavy on America’s 
families. And now, we take another 
strong step to further drive down 
kitchen table costs. 
OUTSIDE SUPPORT 
But don’t take my word for it. 
Take the word of 126 economists—in-
cluding seven Nobel Prize winners, 
three former chairs of the Council of 
Economic Advisers and two farmer 
Treasury Secretaries. 
In a letter urging passage of this bill, 
they wrote: ‘‘These investments will 
fight inflation and lower costs for 
American families—while setting the 
stage for strong, stable, and broadly- 
shared long-term economic growth.’’ 
PUBLIC SUPPORT 
And proudly, the American people 
are with us: 
Three-quarters support our action to 
lower prescription drug costs, 
Two-thirds support our clean energy 
provisions, 
60 percent support billion-dollar com-
panies paying their fair share. 
GOP OPPOSITION 
But sadly, our colleagues across the 
aisle clearly prefer to keep costs for 
families sky-high. 
Senate 
Republicans 
unanimously 
voted against this bill. And now, House 
Republican 
Leaders 
are 
whipping 
against it. 
Their opposition is unconscionable. 
How could anyone vote against low-
ering health care costs on seniors and 
underserved communities as we con-
tinue to fight inflation? 
How could anyone vote against pro-
tecting future generations from rising 
sea levels, raging wildfires and crip-
pling droughts? 
How could anyone vote against re-
ducing 
the 
deficit 
or 
asking 
billiondollar companies and wealthy 
tax cheats to pay their fair share? 
CLOSE: PEOPLE OVER POLITICS 
Madam Speaker, today, every Mem-
ber of this body will be confronted with 
a basic choice. Will you put People 
Over Politics—or Politics Over People? 
For centuries, Members of Congress 
have stood exactly where we stand 
now, facing this exact same decision, 
as they constructed the pillars of the 
American economy and society. Social

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H7700 
August 12, 2022 
Security. Medicare and Medicaid. The 
Affordable Care Act. 
Today, the Congress carries forward 
this all-American tradition. 
The Inflation Reduction Act is a 
package For The People: 
Increasing the leverage of the public 
interest over the special interest, 
And expanding the promise of health 
and financial security, now and for 
generations to come. 
So I urge every Member to put aside 
partisan difference—put People Over 
Politics—and vote YES on the Infla-
tion Reduction Act, as we send this 
historic 
legislation 
to 
President 
Biden’s desk for his signature. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, today, I rise 
in strong support of the Inflation Reduction 
Act—landmark legislation that will have a last-
ing impact on our planet and help lower costs 
for Americans in New York City and across 
our country. From lowering prescription drug 
prices and health care costs for working fami-
lies to including the most significant climate in-
vestment in our nation’s history, the Inflation 
Reduction Act includes policies I have long 
fought for. 
With this legislation, our nation can finally 
rise to the seriousness of the moment in our 
fight against climate change by making the 
large-scale investments needed to reduce 
greenhouse gas emissions by 40 percent by 
2030, lower energy costs for families, and cre-
ate millions of good-paying clean energy jobs 
across our country. 
I am thrilled that with this legislation, our 
government will finally be able to negotiate the 
prices of some of our nation’s costliest pre-
scription drugs—drugs that have been on the 
market for years and reap billions of dollars in 
sales from Medicare alone. I am proud that 
the Inflation Reduction Act will bring down 
health care costs for over 3.7 million New 
Yorkers and will result in enormous savings 
for taxpayers. 
With the passage of this bill, Democrats are 
showing American families that our federal 
government can deliver for the people, not just 
special corporate interests. 
I look forward to voting to pass this historic 
legislation. 
Mr. DAVID SCOTT
of Georgia. Madam 
Speaker, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 
before us today makes historic investments in 
climate change mitigation, our critical forestry 
and conservation programs, rural commu-
nities, and energy and biofuels infrastructure. 
This package makes important investments 
in our oversubscribed farm bill conservation 
programs. By expanding participation in these 
programs and providing increased technical 
assistance funding, farmers will more readily 
be able to employ proven conservation prac-
tices on their land, reduce greenhouse gas 
emissions, and sequester carbon. I have al-
ways believed that agriculture should be the 
tip of the spear in addressing the harmful ef-
fects of climate change. This legislation helps 
make that a reality. 
My colleagues may complain about the 
steps we had to take to ensure this additional 
funding for our farm bill conservation pro-
grams, I would note that our colleagues on the 
other side have similarly extended the author-
ization of farm bill authorizations, but in those 
cases, it was to cut funding from them. In this 
exercise, we are including additional funding, 
which will be beneficial as we look to writing 
the 2023 Farm Bill. 
Major investments in forestry will also help 
to combat climate change, reduce risk of cata-
strophic wildfire, and ensure that our public 
and private lands have the tools they need to 
continue to serve as our largest carbon sinks. 
In addition to the carbon benefits, this bill 
helps restore forest ecosystems, improve wa-
tershed health, and enhance wildlife habitat by 
providing much needed funding. Additionally, 
the forestry provisions of the bill will help bring 
rural prosperity to many parts of our Nation by 
ensuring that we are developing new, innova-
tive, wood products, and by making sure that 
underserved communities can benefit from 
emerging climate mitigation markets. This bill 
makes sure that urban communities have ac-
cess to forestry programs by providing needed 
funding for Urban and Community Forestry. 
Expanding the tree canopy in urban areas is 
one of the cheapest and most effective ways 
to address temperature impacts and air quality 
issues, and I’m sorry some of my colleagues 
don’t recognize that. 
The Inflation Reduction Act’s investments in 
rural communities, energy, and biofuels will 
help lower energy bills, increase the efficiency 
of energy systems, and provide opportunities 
for farmers and small business owners to em-
ploy emission reducing technology in their op-
erations. Increasing energy efficiency is good 
for their bottom lines and good for the climate. 
This legislation also provides significant sup-
port for rural electric cooperatives as they 
transition to renewable and zero emission en-
ergy systems, and it also increases access to 
clean biofuels across the nation. 
This bill provides expedited relief to direct 
and guaranteed farm loan borrowers at risk of 
losing their farming operations. It also allows 
USDA to help farmers and ranchers who have 
suffered discrimination in Farm Service Agen-
cy farm loan programs. It requires USDA to 
use one or more nongovernmental entities to 
help provide this assistance. 
Lastly, it builds upon the American Rescue 
Plan efforts to increase access to capital and 
land for our beginning and underserved pro-
ducers by expanding access to technical as-
sistance, financial training, cooperative devel-
opment, and assistance to address heirs’ 
property issues. And part of this effort includes 
bolstering the capacity at our 1890 and 1994 
Land Grant, Insular Area, and other Minority- 
Serving Institutions in the areas of research, 
education and extension. 
I want to thank the Members of the Agri-
culture Committee for their hard work on this 
legislation. And I also want to thank the Agri-
culture Committee staff who have dedicated 
many hours over the last year to helping see 
this legislation through to its passage today. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New York. 
Madam Speaker, I want to highlight the long- 
overdue reforms contained in this legislation to 
make lifesaving medicine affordable for the 
millions of Medicare beneficiaries in this coun-
try. 
First, it will cap copayments for insulin prod-
ucts at $35 per month. My Committee’s inves-
tigation found that, since the 1990s, insulin 
manufacturers have been raising the price of 
this life-saving medicine, despite no improve-
ments to the drug, while making record profits. 
This price gouging has harmed Americans, 
and capping out-of-pocket costs is an impor-
tant step to reducing insulin costs for seniors 
and people with disabilities. 
The Inflation Reduction Act is also an in-
credible step forward in our efforts to protect 
Americans from being overburdened with high 
out-of-pocket costs and healthcare-related ex-
penses. For the first time, it would limit a 
beneficiary’s out-of-pocket costs for prescrip-
tion drugs covered by Medicare Part D to 
$2,000 a year. My Committee’s investigation 
found that drug companies’ price increases 
have imposed thousands of dollars in annual 
out-of-pocket costs on patients, especially for 
drugs that treat cancer or chronic conditions. 
This annual cap will provide much-needed fi-
nancial protection, especially for the millions of 
beneficiaries who take high price drugs for 
cancer, rare diseases, or chronic conditions. 
Additionally, the Inflation Reduction Act will 
make health insurance coverage more afford-
able for millions of Americans by extending 
key Affordable Care Act (ACA) tax credits 
through 2025, building on the important 
progress made by the American Rescue Plan 
signed into law last March. By providing tax 
credits for millions of consumers purchasing 
coverage through an ACA marketplace, the 
American Rescue Plan expanded access to 
health insurance and made it significantly 
more affordable. 
Since passage of the American Rescue 
Plan, four out of five consumers were able to 
find an ACA marketplace plan for $10 or less 
per month. These savings allowed nearly 6 
million new consumers to sign up for market-
place coverage during the first year of the 
Biden-Harris Administration. This year, a 
record 14.5 million consumers have signed up 
for marketplace coverage, and the national un-
insured rate recently reached a record low of 
8.0 percent. The Inflation Reduction Act ex-
tends these critical benefits for millions of 
Americans, and continues our work to ensure 
that all people in this country have access to 
health insurance coverage. 
As Chairwoman, I was also proud to include 
$50 million dollars in the Inflation Reduction 
Act to ensure that the economic and environ-
mental benefits of funding across the Inflation 
Reduction Act are spread equitably. For dec-
ades, low-income communities and commu-
nities of color have suffered from chronic 
underinvestment while being forced to suffer 
the most severe health and economic impacts 
of pollution and climate change. 
We won’t stand for that any longer. The In-
flation Reduction Act will lower costs, create 
better-paying jobs, and build healthier, more 
sustainable communities. With my Commit-
tee’s oversight funding included, we can make 
sure these benefits are being spread fairly and 
that clean energy investments support envi-
ronmental justice communities that need them 
the most. 
Finally, my Committee worked to include al-
most a billion dollars to support for the deploy-
ment of emerging sustainable technologies to 
reduce emissions while also saving taxpayer 
dollars. This good government provision will 
support innovation to drive down the cost of 
clean energy solutions, which is better for con-
sumers and better for our children’s future. 
This is all accomplished alongside inflation- 
fighting measures that will cut the nation’s def-
icit by a historic $300 billion without raising 
taxes on small businesses or on a single per-
son or family in the middle class. The Inflation 
Reduction Act closes loopholes that have al-
lowed billionaire corporations to avoid paying 
their minimum fair share of income tax.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H7701 
August 12, 2022 
Thanks to this transformative legislation and 
today’s historic vote, those days are behind 
us, and better days of a more fair and pros-
perous nation are ahead. It is an honor to 
send this legislation to the President’s desk. 
Ms. DeLAURO. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today in strong support of H.R. 5376, the Infla-
tion Reduction Act. For years, Americans have 
faced rising costs at grocery stores, phar-
macies, and in recent months, at the gas 
pump. Today, we will send this legislation to 
the President’s desk to be signed into law so 
we can provide necessary relief to hard-
working people across the country. 
The Inflation Reduction Act takes historic 
steps to reduce the deficit and fight inflation, 
invest in domestic energy production and 
manufacturing, and tackle the climate crisis by 
reducing carbon emissions by roughly 40 per-
cent by 2030. The bill will also lower prescrip-
tion drug and health care costs by finally al-
lowing Medicare to negotiate prescription drug 
prices and extending the expanded Affordable 
Care Act program for three years. 
Notably, this legislation makes sure that the 
biggest corporations and billionaires pay 
taxes. It establishes a 15 percent corporate 
minimum tax and invests in Internal Revenue 
Service tax enforcement to ensure that the 
biggest corporations, the ultra-wealthy, and 
rich tax cheats pay their fair share. Large cor-
porations have been using inflation as an ex-
cuse to abuse their market power, jacking up 
prices for American consumers at the grocery 
store, the pharmacy, and at the gas pump. 
This law puts taxpayer dollars back into the 
pockets of working families. 
My vote today comes with a promise to my 
constituents in Connecticut and to the Amer-
ican people—I will continue the fight for com-
mon sense, proven solutions like the Child 
Tax Credit in the days and weeks to come. As 
I have said before, as American families face 
rising costs, the expanded Child Tax Credit is 
one of our best tools to help them face these 
challenges. We still have so much work to do 
to address the problems being faced today by 
working families. 
Today is an important step forward, and I 
am proud to cast my vote in support of this 
critical legislation. 
Mr. HILL. Madam Speaker, I rise today in 
opposition of what I call the Inflation ‘‘Produc-
tion’’ Act. 
There are obvious problems of increasing 
taxes in a recession, expanding Obamacare, 
innovation killing price controls on drugs, and 
its attacks on American energy. 
Hard working families, farmers, and small 
business owners in central Arkansas are going 
to bear the brunt of citizens being audited at 
the highest rates due to more than doubling 
the size of the IRS and it’s increase in fund-
ing. 
What do we think the IRS is going to do 
with this increase in staff and $45 billion in 
new enforcement funding? 
No agency needs six times its current fund-
ing to answer phone calls and improve cus-
tomer service. 
I have seen claims that as long as you don’t 
cheat on your taxes then you have nothing to 
worry about. 
Clearly, they have never faced the harass-
ment and excruciating process of an IRS 
audit. 
We must defeat this legislation. 
Mr. DANNY K. DAVIS of Illinois. Madam 
Speaker, I ran for Congress to help people in 
Chicago, in Illinois, and across the country. 
The Inflation Reduction Act represents a trans-
formative investment in families, workers, busi-
nesses, and the planet that will improve health 
and well-being, advance economic and envi-
ronmental justice, meaningfully address cli-
mate change, and grow our economy while 
asking the wealthiest and most secure to pay 
their fair share. 
As a member of the Ways and Means Com-
mittee, I am deeply honored to have played an 
active role in advancing these policies that im-
prove the health of Americans, workers, our 
economy, and the environment. The pandemic 
has harmed tens of millions of Americans— 
disproportionately hurting African Americans 
and other communities of color, women, sen-
iors, and children. This bill meets immediate 
needs for lower costs for health care, medica-
tions, and energy as well as long-term needs 
for good-paying jobs, a healthy environment, a 
fairer tax system, and deficit and inflation re-
duction. 
As a former health care professional, I am 
proud to vote for this bill that would achieve 
several important goals in healthcare. The 
Secretary of Health and Human Services 
(HHS) would have the power to negotiate cer-
tain high-cost prescription drugs for seniors 
and people with disabilities that are Medicare 
beneficiaries. It would enhance premium tax 
credits, subsidies for people who buy insur-
ance on the Affordable Care Act market-
places, for three additional years. This is to 
extend the enacted legislative measure by 
Congress and President Biden last year to 
help people during the COVID–19 pandemic. 
Medicare recipients would not have to pay 
more than $35 per month of their out-of-pock-
et costs for insulin. Drug companies will have 
to pay a rebate to Medicare if their prices in-
crease faster than inflation, and place caps on 
Medicare Part D out-of-pocket drug purchases 
at $2,000 yearly. There will be no copayments 
for vaccines in Medicare Part D, Medicaid and 
the Children’s Health Insurance Program 
(CHIP). Each of these health provisions di-
rectly helps people spend less of their money 
on healthcare costs and slows the price in-
creases of medicines, giving Chicagoans, Illi-
noisans, and Americans extra money to meet 
their needs and improve their well-being. 
As 
the 
representative 
of 
communities 
harmed by high energy costs and pollution, I 
am proud to vote for this bill that will save the 
average American household hundreds in en-
ergy bills, reduce emissions by 40 percent by 
2030, generate enormous public health bene-
fits via reduced air pollution, and grow our 
clean energy economy by spurring 9 million 
jobs. 
I am pleased that this legislation includes 
my bill, the Low-Income Housing Renewable 
Energy Credit Act (LIHREC) of 2021, to pro-
vide a larger tax credit for those businesses 
investing in new wind and solar projects in 
low-to-moderate income (LMI) communities. I 
am confident that this provision will help the 
tax code advance environmental and eco-
nomic justice by bringing the economic and 
environmental benefits of solar energy to low- 
income individuals and communities, spread-
ing the benefits of clean and affordable energy 
to households like those that I represent that 
have far too often been neglected by clean 
energy providers. Current renewable tax bene-
fits typically remain out of reach for low-in-
come communities, which also experience 
greater power-generated pollution. The new 
provision would provide an enhanced Invest-
ment Tax Credit to solar projects benefiting 
low-income residents, including multifamily 
housing, community solar homes, and indi-
vidual low-income residential homeowners. 
Some of the leading companies in this sec-
tor have raised the need for additional guid-
ance related to the use of the credit for 
projects benefiting low-income homeowners to 
ensure that the program within the reconcili-
ation bill will provide environmental justice al-
locations in a manner that provide businesses 
sufficient certainty to make the necessary in-
vestments in LMI communities. The central 
concern is clarity that businesses offering roof-
top solar to LMI homeowners will receive the 
credit allocation prior to engaging with poten-
tial customers so that businesses can honestly 
convey the expected energy costs. Critical to 
the success of this new program will be par-
ticipation by those businesses providing resi-
dential rooftop solar. 
My intent in drafting the LIHREC Act, the 
basis for the provision included in the rec-
onciliation bill, was to ensure that residential 
rooftop solar businesses would be in a posi-
tion to leap into service of LMI communities 
when the bill is signed into law. As such, the 
legislation is designed to provide maximum 
flexibility to Treasury in designing the applica-
tion and allocation process for the bonus 10 
percent credit. Specifically, the legislation is in-
tended to allow residential rooftop providers to 
identify potential customers in qualifying cen-
sus tracts and submit applications to serve 
these customers up-front, before these busi-
nesses have engaged these potential cus-
tomers. My understanding is that these busi-
nesses will need to know if they have received 
a credit allocation before they can offer the 
benefits of rooftop solar to new customers in 
LMI areas to provide accurate pricing informa-
tion to low-income customers. Without cer-
tainty in the availability of the credit allocation, 
low-income homeowners are at risk of enter-
ing deals with shifting costs or of not having 
the opportunities at all given the uncertainty 
for businesses. So today, I make clear my un-
derstanding that the negotiated text gives 
Treasury the necessary flexibility to award al-
locations up-front so that businesses can 
make new investments in LMI communities 
knowing that they will be in a position to claim 
the bonus credit. 
I also received questions from an insurance 
company in Illinois about whether companies 
that only prepare what is known as statutory 
accounting statements would be required to 
produce GAAP statements or a hybrid of 
GAAP. It is my understanding that the legisla-
tion provides that applicable financial state-
ments required to be filed with state insurance 
regulators will be recognized as applicable fi-
nancial statements for purposes of the new 
book minimum tax. State insurance regulators 
already are subject to a robust regulatory fi-
nancial statement requirement to ensure the 
continued protection of insurance consumers. 
After enactment, I will work to convey this un-
derstanding to the executive branch. 
I am honored to vote for this once-in-a-gen-
eration legislation. I came to Congress to 
make this type of momentous change. I urge 
my colleagues to pass it. 
Mr. CUELLAR. Madam Speaker, I would 
like to clarify for any of my colleagues who 
might be concerned that these three offshore

lease sales provided through the Inflation Re-
duction Act are somehow being rushed 
through or will be conducted with insufficient 
administrative process. That is simply not the 
case. 
These sales were scheduled under the 
Obama Administration under the 2017–2022 
five-year plan. That Interior department sub-
jected the plan to a large programmatic envi-
ronmental impact statement. They then under-
went a multi-sale EIS. These sales then also 
went through a supplemental EIS. Thus, the 
idea that any further process should be re-
quired is just not credible and that is why the 
bill requires them to occur by a date certain. 
It is in our national interest to do so as 
quickly as possible so that the energy crisis 
does not become even worse and so that the 
fuel and revenue these sales will generate can 
find their way into our economy sooner than 
later. 
Mrs. DINGELL. Madam Speaker, I rise in 
strong support of the Inflation Reduction Act 
we are considering today and would like to 
speak specifically to the inclusion of the 
Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, which is 
based on important legislation I authored to 
address the climate crisis. 
The Inflation Reduction Act appropriates 
$27 billion to the Environmental Protection 
Agency (EPA) to finance climate specific 
projects that will reduce carbon emissions, 
which will be dispensed through the Green-
house Gas (GHG) Reduction Fund. The GHG 
Reduction Fund is the product of more than 
13 years of legislative effort by numerous 
members of the House and Senate and pro-
vides resources to fulfill the vision and mission 
of this legislative effort to capitalize a national 
climate bank that will support a swift transition 
to an equitable, clean-energy economy, 
In the House, the GHG Reduction Fund is 
based on H.R. 806, the Clean Energy and 
Sustainability Accelerator Act. I introduced this 
important legislation to provide the maximum 
funding possible to and capitalize a single 
independent, non-profit national financing insti-
tution (‘‘NNFI’’)—the first ever national green 
bank—that would in turn make its financial 
and technical resources available to commu-
nities across the country. It is our hope, as the 
administration implements the GHG Reduction 
Fund, it will consider the benefits and structure 
of the Clean Energy and Sustainability Accel-
erator Act. 
It is our hope the Environmental Protection 
Agency would make awards through the GHG 
Reduction Fund to capitalize a single NNFI, as 
intended under the Clean Energy and Sustain-
ability Accelerator Act, and for that NNFI to 
use that capitalization funding to leverage pri-
vate investment in amounts several times 
greater than the initial public investment. Once 
capitalized, the bill requires the entity to make 
direct investments into qualified projects at the 
national, regional, state, and local levels and, 
importantly, to make indirect investments into 
such projects by providing financial and tech-
nical assistance to an open, inclusive, and 
ever-expanding network of state and local 
nonprofit financial institutions—including exist-
ing and newly established green banks and 
community development finance institutions— 
that are committed to making investments in 
the products that will compose the clean 
power platform on which the economy must 
run. 
The GHG Reduction Fund makes an historic 
investment into low income and disadvantaged 
communities as well, mandating that at least 
40 percent of the over $20 billion be used to 
benefit qualified projects and the financing en-
tities that support qualified projects within 
these communities, but we expect that the full 
investment in these communities will be far 
larger through leverage and investments from 
the remainder of the Fund. 
The GHG Reduction Fund, and the Amer-
ican people, would benefit most and achieve 
its purpose most effectively through the cap-
italization of a single independent NNFI, as 
originally intended in the Clean Energy and 
Sustainability Accelerator Act. A single inde-
pendent NNFI will not be limited by any juris-
dictional boundary—no community is beyond 
its reach. Therefore, the NNFI approach could 
directly invest in qualified projects anywhere in 
the United States that would otherwise lack 
funding. In addition, the NNFI approach can 
indirectly invest in any community by providing 
the funding and technical assistance nec-
essary to establish new financial institutions 
and further capitalize and strengthen existing 
ones. The NNFI would grow a diverse, open, 
and inclusive network of state and local green 
banks and other mission driven financing enti-
ties. 
Capitalizing a single independent NNFI at 
scale, through the GHG Reduction Fund, 
would also enable public investment to be le-
veraged more efficiently which, in turn, drives 
much greater private capital investment in 
qualified projects, whether at the national, re-
gional, state, or local level. And the Inflation 
Reduction Act requires the entity to ‘‘retain, 
manage, recycle, and monetize all repayments 
and other revenue’’ generated using the cap-
italization grant. We count on EPA to assure 
that the NNFI will be subject to the appropriate 
regulations and requirements that would apply 
to similar non-profit institutions that have been 
capitalized with federal or nonfederal dollars. 
At the same time, the relationship between 
EPA and the single independent nonprofit na-
tional financing institution should be designed 
to preserve its operational flexibility and ability 
to respond quickly to market conditions to exe-
cute with the speed that the climate crisis de-
mands. 
Finally, the Inflation Reduction Act sets a 
180-day period for EPA to complete all these 
steps: establish the GHG Reduction Fund, 
issue a grant solicitation, award capitalization 
grants, and disburse the funds. These aggres-
sive deadlines were established because the 
GHG Reduction Fund cannot achieve its pur-
pose unless the full amount of funds appro-
priated to this program are put into use 
through a NNFI approach immediately. Dis-
bursing all the funds within 180 days though a 
single independent NNFI, as originally in-
tended under the Clean Energy and Sustain-
ability Accelerator Act will ensure that we can 
expeditiously address the urgent threat of cat-
astrophic climate change, in an equitable man-
ner, on day 181. A swift disbursement of the 
maximum funding amount possible will allow 
the climate bank to leverage more private fi-
nancing—thereby ensuring our public invest-
ment has a far reaching impact. 
The impacts of climate change have created 
an emergency situation that poses a substan-
tial danger to the health and safety of the 
American public, and the award and disburse-
ment of the maximum amount of funds appro-
priated to the GHG Reduction Fund cannot be 
delayed. We recognize that the timeline will 
require EPA, at every step in the grant proc-
ess, to evaluate approaches that can reduce 
the amount of time that it would otherwise 
take to complete that step—and it is our inten-
tion that EPA will utilize all legally-authorized 
strategies that are necessary to ensure the full 
amount of the funding is disbursed on time. 
Mr. THOMPSON of California. Madam 
Speaker, I strongly support H.R. 5376, the In-
flation Reduction Act of 2022. 
I am particularly pleased that the legislation 
before the House includes major provisions of 
my GREEN Act, including incentives for a vast 
array of clean and renewable energy sources. 
This legislation represents the most sweep-
ing and ambitious climate policy ever to pass 
the Congress. 
It reduces our dependence on fossil fuels 
while accelerating the development of solar, 
wind, and other renewable energy sources. 
And it incentivizes individuals to limit green-
house gas emissions from their homes, their 
businesses, and their vehicles. 
I am also extremely supportive of the health 
care provisions in this bill. 
Allowing Medicare to negotiate the price of 
prescription drugs has been a priority for 
Democrats in Congress for decades—and this 
bill not only ensures that seniors don’t go 
broke paying for their medicines, but also 
saves taxpayers hundreds of billions of dol-
lars. 
Given the negotiations of the past 18 
months, this bill could not accommodate every 
single priority or proposal. 
And I am hopeful that my colleagues will 
work with me moving forward to ensure that 
the corporate minimum tax—a policy I sup-
port—does not inadvertently burden compa-
nies, like some in my district, who suffered se-
vere net operating losses in previous years 
due to natural disaster. 
This bill is a tremendous step forward for 
our country. It pays down our deficit, reduces 
the cost of prescription drugs, extends health 
insurance subsidies for low-income Americans 
and invests hundreds of billions of dollars in 
clean and renewable energy. 
I am proud to have helped author this legis-
lation, and I strongly support its passage. 
Mr. WELCH. Madam Speaker, as many of 
my colleagues know, I have worked for years 
to protect patient access to pharmacies across 
this nation. It is the intent of the United States 
House that this legislation, and in particular, 
Section 
1860D–14C(c). 
MANUFACTURER 
DISCOUNT PROGRAM shall operate in the 
same manner as the Medicare Part D Cov-
erage Gap Discount Program found under 42 
USC 1395w–114a. CMS shall implement this 
provision to operate in the same manner with 
respect to a pharmacy. In that way, this sec-
tion shall not result in any reduction in phar-
macy reimbursement or require or permit price 
concessions or other remuneration from the 
pharmacy. We will convey this intent to the 
Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services as 
they develop the rules that will govern this dis-
count program. I will continue to look for addi-
tional ways to help patients and to preserve 
and protect our pharmacies that are so essen-
tial to communities across Vermont and our 
country. 
Ms. BONAMICI. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today in support of a transformational piece of 
legislation, the Inflation Reduction Act.

ments will reduce costs for families and indi-
viduals, expand access to affordable health

care, strengthen domestic energy production 
and manufacturing, and reduce the federal 
deficit. This plan will also reduce carbon emis-
sions to address the climate crisis and move 
us toward a better, healthier, and more secure 
future for Oregonians and people across the 
country. 
The coronavirus (COVID–19) pandemic ex-
acerbated longstanding economic inequities, 
and working families have been facing the 
consequences. Economic inflation caused by 
increased consumer demand, global supply 
chain disruptions, and Russia’s unprovoked in-
vasion of Ukraine have shifted global markets, 
affecting everyday costs. Higher prices are 
straining household budgets and depriving 
workers of the full benefits of our growing 
economy. The Inflation Reduction Act will 
lower costs for health care, prescription drugs, 
and consumer energy, and make robust in-
vestments in energy security and climate solu-
tions, including for disadvantaged and rural 
communities. 
In the Pacific Northwest, climate change is 
not a distant threat; it’s our current reality. The 
Inflation Reduction Act acknowledges the 
scale of the climate crisis by investing nearly 
$375 billion in a clean energy future. It will 
lower consumer energy costs with clean en-
ergy tax credits, and decarbonize every sector 
of the economy to reduce 40 percent of U.S. 
carbon emissions by 2030. Importantly, the In-
flation Reduction Act will invest $60 billion in 
environmental justice and climate resilient so-
lutions through sustainable agriculture, coast-
al, home energy, and transportation priorities 
to bolster rural communities and individuals 
disproportionately affected by climate change. 
Through economy-wide investments in agri-
culture, coastal restoration, energy, manufac-
turing, and transportation, this pivotal legisla-
tion will help the U.S. combat climate change 
while creating new, good paying jobs and miti-
gating climate inequities. 
Everyone in the United States should have 
access to quality, affordable health care. To 
make health care more affordable, the Inflation 
Reduction Act will extend important health 
policies passed in the American Rescue Plan 
for an additional three years. These policies 
include eliminating the cap on subsidies for 
health insurance coverage under the Afford-
able Care Act, which will benefit up to four mil-
lion Americans. Additionally, rising prescription 
drug costs are a burden for many Americans, 
particularly seniors. Too often, excessive drug 
prices force families to choose between their 
health and other necessities, like food and 
housing. That’s unacceptable. The Inflation 
Reduction Act will reduce the price of prescrip-
tion drugs by allowing Medicare to negotiate 
drug prices for certain medications, and will 
cap seniors’ out-of-pocket costs to $2,000 a 
year. The bill also caps insulin costs at $35 
per month for Medicare beneficiaries. The In-
flation Reduction Act will stabilize Medicare 
Part D by holding annual premium growth to 
current levels, which will incentivize drug man-
ufacturers and insurers to keep drug prices 
low. 
These historic investments will be paid for 
by making our tax code more progressive, 
rather than regressive. With the tax provisions 
in this bill, the very largest corporations, cur-
rently contributing as little as one percent in 
taxes, will pay a minimum rate rather than 
take advantage of loopholes. After the Repub-
licans’ 2017 tax bill was signed into law, cor-
porations spent more than $1 trillion on stock 
buybacks in 2018. The Inflation Reduction Act 
will help correct the missed opportunities of 
the so-called Tax Cuts and Jobs Act by estab-
lishing a tax on stock buybacks. It will also 
strengthen the Internal Revenue Service to 
enforce existing tax laws, improve customer 
service, speed access to tax refunds, and re-
duce abuse of the tax code. Improving tax fair-
ness will bolster domestic investments in our 
economy while also reducing the deficit. 
The Inflation Reduction Act makes tremen-
dous progress, but it does not address all of 
the important priorities of the people of NW 
Oregon and across the country, including 
needed investments in workforce development 
and child care. I will continue working on 
those important priorities, but in the meantime, 
I look forward to making significant progress 
by working with my colleagues in Congress 
and partners in the Biden-Harris Administra-
tion to pass the Inflation Reduction Act.

tion, fees, or other charges paid to or for 
them by the educational institution or by 
the Department of Veterans Affairs under 
this title or under chapter 1606 of title 10, ex-
cept with respect to tuition, fees, or other

retary determines has a history of offering

‘‘(2) The Secretary may waive the require-
ments of paragraph (1), in whole or in part,

ulations which the Secretary shall prescribe, 
it to be in the interest of the eligible veteran

‘‘(3)(A) The Secretary shall establish a 
process by which an educational institution 
may request a review of a determination 
that the educational institution does not 
meet the requirements of paragraph (1). 
‘‘(B) An educational institution that re-
quests a review under subparagraph (A)— 
‘‘(i) shall request the review not later than 
30 days after the start of the term, quarter,

educational institution believes the Depart-
ment should have taken into account when

respect to any mitigating circumstances. 
‘‘(C) The Under Secretary of Benefits shall 
issue an initial decision for each review re-
quested under subparagraph (A) by not later 
than 30 days after the date of the request, to 
the extent feasible.

quest the Secretary to review the decision by 
the Under Secretary under subparagraph (C).

requested and, pursuant to such review, shall

‘‘(E) The Secretary shall carry out this 
paragraph without regard to any review 
process carried out by the Secretary under

sons receiving assistance under this title or 
under chapter 1606 of title 10 who are en-
rolled in such institution equals 35 percent 
or less of the total student enrollment at 
such institution (computed separately for 
the main campus and any branch or exten-
sion of such institution).

any course offered by an educational institu-
tion if— 
‘‘(i) the majority of courses offered by the 
educational institution are approved under

JACKIE WALORSKI VA CLINIC 
Mr. TAKANO. Madam Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that the Com-
mittee on Veterans’ Affairs be dis-
charged from further consideration of 
the bill (H.R. 8656) to designate the 
clinic of the Department of Veterans 
Affairs in Mishawaka, Indiana, as the 
‘‘Jackie Walorski VA Clinic’’, and ask 
for its immediate consideration in the 
House. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from California? 
There was no objection. 
The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 8656 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. FINDINGS. 
Congress finds the following: 
(1) Jackie Walorski was born August 17, 
1963, in South Bend, Indiana.

raised by her parents, Martha, who worked 
at a local grocery store, and Raymond, an 
Air Force veteran and firefighter who owned 
an appliance store. 
(3) Jackie Walorski graduated from James 
Whitcomb Riley High School in 1981 and is 
an alumna of Taylor University. 
(4) Upon her graduation, Jackie Walorski

in South Bend and later worked for local 
chapters of the Humane Society and Cham-
ber of Commerce as well as served as a devel-
opment officer for area universities. 
(5) In 2000, she and her husband Dean 
Swihart moved to Romania and founded Im-
pact International, a nonprofit foundation 
that provided medical supplies and attention 
to impoverished children while they served 
as missionaries there for four years. 
(6) In 2004, she was elected to the Indiana 
House of Representatives and subsequently 
reelected to that office every two years 
where she served three full terms in office. 
(7) In 2012, she was elected to the United 
States House of Representatives and subse-
quently reelected to that office until her 
death in a tragic car accident in 2022. 
(8) During her service in the United States 
House of Representatives, she was a pas-
sionate advocate for all her constituents, but 
especially veterans in the area. 
(9) During her service in the United States

HONORING PATRIC T. POWELL 
HON. MIKE THOMPSON 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, August 12, 2022 
Mr. THOMPSON of California. Madam 
Speaker, I am joined with Speaker PELOSI as 
we rise to honor Patric Powell and celebrate 
the 45th anniversary of his floral business, 
Bloomers. He is an inspiring leader in the 
community, creating both beauty and change 
through his work at Bloomers. 
Born in St. Helena and eventually moving to 
San Francisco, Mr. Powell has always been 
passionate about flowers. His first job working 
after school was at a St. Helena flower shop, 
and when he moved, he continued to work in 
flower shops across San Francisco. In 1977, 
he established Bloomers. The small florist 
shop was originally located on Sacramento 
Street, eventually moving to its permanent lo-
cation on Washington Street. Now, it occupies 
a pre-earthquake building constructed in 1900. 
Overtime, Bloomers has evolved to include 
ribbons, baskets, antiques, and even a gallery 
area for artists and authors to share their 
works. Bloomers is a beloved community 
asset and resource. 
Under Mr. Powell’s leadership, Bloomers 
has regularly contributed to a variety of local 
non-profit organizations. These past 45 years, 
Mr. Powell has demonstrated a remarkable 
dedication to serving his community. Beyond 
non-profit work, Bloomers is a full participant 
in multiple life cycle events, resulting in mul-
tiple generations of families becoming loyal 
patrons of the shop. 
Bloomers’ excellence goes beyond the cus-
tomer experience. The staff are equally im-
pressive. Their long tenures at the store ex-
emplify this, with three employees serving for 
30+ years, 2 for 20+ years, and 1 for 15+ 
years. This longevity is a testament to Mr. 
Powell’s inspired leadership and the care with 
which the business is operated and managed. 
In addition to being a successful business 
owner, Mr. Powell is a devoted husband to his 
wife, Mary, a proud father to his children, Blair 
and Alex, and loving grandfather to Zoe, Luke, 
Mathilda and Lucie. 
Madam Speaker, Patric Powell works in-
credibly hard for the individuals and commu-
nity he serves. He and his store, Bloomers, 
have been a remarkable part of San Francisco 
for over 45 years. It is therefore fitting and 
proper that we honor him and his staff here 
today.

RECOGNIZING MS. GERI KILSDONK 
HON. HALEY M. STEVENS 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, August 12, 2022 
Ms. STEVENS. Madam Speaker, it is my 
great honor to rise in recognition of Ms. Geri 
Kilsdonk, a spirited resident of Plymouth, 
Michigan, who has dedicated herself to nu-
merous causes that benefit Michigan’s 11th 
District. Ms. Kilsdonk has made an immense 
impact on the lives of those around her, and 
I am thrilled to join the community in cele-
brating Ms. Kilsdonk for her many contribu-
tions to her fellow Americans. 
In 1943, Ms. Geri Kilsdonk was born to Mr. 
Joseph Kilsdonk and Ms. Loretta Kilsdonk. 
Her father was a member of the International 
Brotherhood of Teamsters, as a ‘‘milk man’’ in 
Illinois, while her mother worked hard raising 
Geri and her two brothers at their home in 
Evanston, Illinois. Geri was prepared for her 
life of service through her Catholic School 
education, instilling in her values that guided 
her through her adult life and activism. 
In 1968, Geri Kilsdonk married John Flinn, 
beginning their 33-year marriage. The couple 
made Southeast Michigan their home after de-
parting Illinois. Taking advantage of an FHA 
loan, Ms. Kilsdonk submitted a $2,000 down 
payment on their first Michigan house, making 
Dearborn Heights, Michigan their new commu-
nity. Like many in Metropolitan Detroit, the 
family made their living by working in the auto-
motive industry. Ms. Kilsdonk was proud of 
her husband’s 33-year career at Ford Motor 
Company, eventually earning him an execu-
tive-level position. In 1974, the family chose 
the Northville/Plymouth area as their perma-
nent residence, launching a nearly-50-year ca-
reer for Ms. Kilsdonk as a prolific activist and 
promoter of the community. 
A new chapter began with the passing of 
Geri’s husband, John, in September of 2001. 
Geri bravely delivered her husband’s eulogy 
before returning to what she did best, advo-
cating for a better society. As a member of an 
automotive family, Geri understood the impor-
tance of the industry to the lives of many of 
her neighbors. During the automotive financial 
crisis, Geri lost the healthcare coverage she 
earned as a surviving spouse of a Ford re-
tiree. Geri knew that her neighbors were also 
feeling the strain from the struggling auto-
motive industry, so she created her own script 
and called her neighbors to discuss these im-
portant issues and urge them to take action 
through civic participation. 
Described as a ‘‘doer’’ by those who know 
her, Geri donates immense amounts of time to 
the causes that she valued. She has sup-
ported Ronald McDonald House Charities for 
many years, along with contributions to the 
arts and culture through her support of the 
Plymouth Historical Museum and the Penn 
Theater. Geri’s impact extends to education, 
as well, having created a nursing scholarship 
for future medical professionals and part of the 
Schoolcraft College Foundation. Many in 
Michigan’s 11th District and across the state 
have benefitted from expanded educational 
opportunities, gained access to critical serv-
ices, and engaged with the vibrant cultural ex-
periences that have been supported by Ms. 
Kilsdonk. 
Madam Speaker, Geri continues to bring 
about positive change to Michigan’s 11th Dis-
trict with her ongoing contributions to civics, 
health, and the arts. Please join me in thank-
ing Geri for her commitment to strengthening 
our communities.

HONORING KIERRA JONES- 
WILLIAMS 
HON. BENNIE G. THOMPSON 
OF MISSISSIPPI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, August 12, 2022 
Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to honor a tenacious and 
self-motivated leader, Kierra Jones-Williams. 
Kierra has shown what can be done through 
hard work, dedication, and a desire to achieve 
success. 
Kierra Jones-Williams, a native of Cleve-
land, the daughter of a single parent, said her 
passion for helping others stems from her 
Delta roots; volunteering and mentoring in the 
MS Delta, and being crowned Miss Tougaloo 
College (2017–2018). She attended Tougaloo 
College, where she received a full ride and 
other scholarships including the Congressional 
Black Caucus Scholarship. Her journey contin-
ued when she enrolled in Jackson State Uni-
versity’s School of Public Health (SPH), which 
is the only SPH in Mississippi. Her concentra-
tion was Behavioral Health Promotion and 
Education within the Department of Behavioral 
and Environmental Health. With a strong de-
sire to impact public health and practice medi-
cine, Kierra Jones-Williams, wanted to return 
to the Mississippi Delta as a medical doctor 
because she’s seen how the lack of education 
and resources can impact the health of com-
munities. 
She was then accepted into the University 
of Mississippi Medical Center (UMMC) School 
of Medicine Fall 2019. Kierra was awarded 
two scholarships totaling $41,000 annually to 
help achieve her goal of becoming a physi-
cian. She has also been awarded $30,000 per 
year toward her tuition by the Mississippi 
Rural Physicians Scholarship Program and 
$11,000 per year by the Robert M. Hearing 
Support 
Foundation 
Minority 
Scholarship. 
Jones-Williams is also a Daniel Hale Williams 
Scholar in the Jackson Heart Study Graduate 
Training and Education Center. Kierra plans to 
return to a rural area of Mississippi to practice. 
As many who have paved the path before her, 
she plans to integrate public health with clin-
ical care in her practice. She wants the legacy 
of her career to be labeled as a physician who 
considers the influences of culture and genet-
ics on patient health and one that primarily 
generates a professional relationship of trust, 
understanding, and sound medical treatment 
practices with her patients. While enrolled as 
a medical student at UMMC, Kierra has 
served as Vice President of UMMC Student 
National Medical Association, Advocacy Chair 
of UMMC Obstetrics and Gynecology Interest 
Group, Community Liaison for Rural Scholars, 
received the Dee and Bill Keeton Award (for

APPRECIATING CONGRESSWOMAN 
JACKIE WALORSKI 
HON. JOE WILSON 
OF SOUTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, August 12, 2022 
Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Madam 
Speaker, last week Congress experienced a 
personal loss with the death of Congress-
woman Jackie Walorski, one of our greatest 
Members. Many of us lost a dear friend. 
Jackie has been memorialized with extraor-
dinary, deserved tributes. Congresswoman 
ANN WAGNER praised, ‘‘Jackie was a no non-
sense, get it done woman.’’ 
Republican Study Committee Chairman JIM 
BANKS correctly cited, ‘‘[Jackie] embodied what 
it means to be a public servant.’’ Republican 
Leader KEVIN MCCARTHY praised her passion, 
‘‘empowering children and families, running a 
foundation in Romania . . . fighting for justice 
from fentanyl victims.’’ 
Republican Whip STEVE SCALISE praised 
Jackie for ‘‘her kindness, tenacity, and com-
mitment to helping others’’ as a valued mem-
ber of the Whip team. 
Ways and Means Republican Leader KEVIN 
BRADY thoughtfully stated, ‘‘God took a special 
angel home today. Congresswoman Jackie 
Walorski was a happy Hoosier who would light 
up the room with her joy, passion, brilliance, 
and love of life.’’ 
I will always cherish leading a delegation 
with Jackie to Poland where her Polish herit-
age was beloved. She and her husband Dean 
were a great team in helping liberate Eastern 
Europe for America. 
God Bless our Troops. We will never forget 
September 11th as the Global War on Ter-
rorism continues moving from a safe haven in 
Afghanistan to America.

HONORING 1440 KEYS 75TH 
ANNIVERSARY 
HON. MICHAEL CLOUD 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, August 12, 2022 
Mr. CLOUD. Madam Speaker, today, I wish 
to honor the 75th anniversary of Corpus Chris-
ti’s home of talk radio, 1440 KEYS. 
On August 14, 1947, the Federal Commu-
nications Commission (FCC) approved KEYS 
to move from the 1490 frequency it was origi-
nally granted, to its new frequency at 1440. 
With this change, KEYS also increased its 
power from 250 watts to 500 watts, improving 
its reach and beginning to increase its influ-
ence in the community. 
For now over 75 years, KEYS has remained 
on air at 1440 AM, serving the public through-
out wars, hurricanes, and natural disasters. 
KEYS was founded primarily as a music 
and entertainment station but has evolved to 
become a key voice in the Coastal Bend com-
munity with its talk radio programming. 
A leading voice heard all throughout the re-
gion is none other than Corpus Christi’s very 
own, Bob Jones. 
For over 25 of those 75 years, the Bob 
Jones Show has provided an engaging, in-
formative, and entertaining platform for South 
Texans to discuss different topics and news of 
the day. 
1440 KEYS became a legacy station de-
pended on by the community for local, state, 
national and international news and informa-
tion. 
In addition, KEYS has not only increased its 
power to 1000 watts, but it can now be heard 
on FM broadcasting at 98.7. 
1440 KEYS has become a pillar of the 
South Texas region, and it is a privilege to 
honor their service to their community for the 
past 75 years.

HOMETOWN HERO—SCOTT AND 
ELLEN CHOI 
HON. BETH VAN DUYNE 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, August 12, 2022 
Ms. VAN DUYNE. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize Scott and Ellen Choi of 
Colleyville, Texas. 
In 2018, the husband-and-wife duo opened 
up Honey Teriyaki, a restaurant serving Japa-
nese cuisine inspired by Scott’s mother’s old 
recipes. 
However, aside from serving delicious 
meals, Scott and Ellen have gone above and 
beyond to carry out their philosophy on life: 
give back to the community they love so 
much. 
On many occasions, they have provided 
food for the brave servicemen and women at 
the Colleyville Police Department. During the 
2021 winter storms in North Texas, they pro-
vided free food to those without electricity. 
When tornadoes struck Kentucky in December 
of 2021, they even rented a U-Haul and drove 
700 miles to provide their incredible food to 
the victims. 
Scott and Ellen’s compassion and gen-
erosity should serve as an inspiration to all of 
us in North Texas. They love their community 
and do not hesitate to selflessly display that. 
I thank them both, and hope to visit their in-
credible restaurant one day soon.

HONORING CARLENE PALMER 
HON. BENNIE G. THOMPSON 
OF MISSISSIPPI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, August 12, 2022 
Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to honor a legend, Mrs. 
Carlene Palmer. Mrs. Palmer has shown what 
can be done through hard work, dedication, 
determination, and a desire to be a trailblazer. 
Mrs. Carlene Palmer was born on October 
3, 1926. She is the first female African Amer-
ican to own a dry-cleaning business known as 
Southside Cleaners in the Freetown Commu-
nity of Crystal Springs, MS. During segrega-
tion times in Crystal Springs, Freetown was 
known as the part of town that African Ameri-
cans owned businesses such as cafes, hair 
salons, cab services, dry cleaning, laundry 
buildings, etc. 
Mrs. Palmer proudly served her community 
with this business for 47 years from 1962 until 
her health caused her to retire in 2009. At the 
ripe age of 95 years old, Mrs. Palmer still 
looks forward to making her famous Sunday 
dinner every week. She is a true crown jewel 
of Crystal Springs, MS. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in recognizing Mrs. Carlene Palmer for her 
outstanding service and history making in 
Crystal Springs, Mississippi.

FRANK HOADLEY TRIBUTE 
HON. GWEN MOORE 
OF WISCONSIN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, August 12, 2022 
Ms. MOORE of Wisconsin. Madam Speak-
er, I rise today in memoriam of Frank Hoadley, 
a longtime resident of Lodi, WI, and legend in 
public finance circles. 
Frank served the State of Wisconsin from 
1988 to 2013 as the Capital Finance Director 
under 4 Democratic and Republican gov-
ernors. His dedication to a strong, robust cap-
ital finance program ensured that our state 
was on solid fiscal standing and able to serve 
the citizens of Wisconsin through the construc-
tion and maintenance of important public facili-
ties and infrastructure projects. 
Wisconsin benefited enormously from Mr. 
Hoadley’s exemplary stewardship of public fi-
nances, but so did the entire public finance 
community as Frank led numerous industry ef-
forts to enhance market practices and disclo-
sure standards as a member and Chairman of 
the Government Finance Officers Associa-
tion’s Debt Management Committee. He also 
contributed mightily over the years to initia-
tives at the National Association of State 
Treasurers’ State Debt Management Network, 
and the Council for Infrastructure Financing 
Authorities. 
I had the pleasure of working with Frank on 
numerous occasions through the years on 
projects to strengthen the municipal bond mar-
ket, such as maintaining the tax-exemption of 
municipal bonds, Dodd-Frank municipal advi-
sor rules and regulations, and various other 
key public finance issues where congressional 
actions could help states responsibly finance 
public works projects. He truly did enrich com-
munities throughout the country, including Mil-
waukee, with his generosity of knowledge and 
dedication to public service. 
While Frank was not a native son of Wis-
consin, his family has a long history in the 
state. His great-great grandfather, Edmund 
Ross, worked at the Milwaukee Free Demo-
crat and the Milwaukee Daily Sentinel news-
papers in the middle 1800s. At the time, Mr. 
Ross contributed to numerous anti-slavery ef-
forts in Wisconsin and around the country. 
Frank will be remembered for the extraor-
dinary contributions he made across our great 
state and to the public finance community. I 
extend my condolences to Frank’s wife, Eliza-
beth, his daughters, Marci and Jessica, and 
their families, and Frank’s extended family.

CELEBRATING 35 YEARS OF RON-
ALD 
MCDONALD 
HOUSE 
CHAR-
ITIES OF SOUTHERN COLORADO 
HON. DOUG LAMBORN 
OF COLORADO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, August 12, 2022 
Mr. LAMBORN. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize the Ronald McDonald 
House 
Charities 
of 
Southern 
Colorado 
(RMHCSC) for 35 years of providing a safe, 
comfortable, and caring place for families of 
critically ill children from around the nation re-
ceiving treatment in Southern Colorado. 
The Ronald McDonald House Charities of 
Southern Colorado has a unique history, from 
when it was first conceptualized, funded, built, 
and opened to serve families in need. A local 
pediatrician, Dr. Don Genrich, believed that 
families in the Pikes Peak region would greatly 
benefit from a Ronald McDonald House 
(RMH), so he recruited a small start-up team 
to help him make the dream a reality. Nancy 
Parker Brummett, a local business executive, 
and Steve Bigari, a U.S. Army soldier sta-
tioned at Fort Carson, joined forces with Dr. 
Genrich and began their work. The team was 
highly motivated to lead this effort and inti-
mately familiar with the grace-filled mission 
and the warm welcome a Ronald McDonald 
House offers to families in need. The Bigari’s 
infant daughter Sara had already endured sev-
eral life-saving surgeries at Children’s Hospital 
in Denver, and another RMH had lovingly 
hosted the family. 
The trio began sharing the vision and rais-
ing funds. By the grace of God and the gen-
erosity of community philanthropists, the first 
Ronald McDonald House of Southern Colo-
rado opened at 311 N. Logan Street in Colo-
rado Springs. Significant donors included 
McDonald’s restaurants, the Junior League, 
Memorial Hospital, and countless other gen-
erous families and businesses. 
On February 14, 1987, they opened the 
‘‘House that Love Built.’’ Their mission was 
simple: keep families and their critically ill chil-
dren close to each other and provide the sup-
port and resources they most need. Signifi-
cantly, Steve’s then three-year-old daughter, 
Sara, cut the ribbon at the opening ceremony. 
It was a joyous occasion for the entire Pikes 
Peak region. 
Since then, Ronald McDonald Charities of 
Southern Colorado has provided Christ-like 
hope, grace, hospitality, and comfort to every 
family member who has walked through its 
doors. RMHCSC has been a home for more 
than 11,500 families in the first 35 years of its 
existence. 
In 2008, RMHCSC opened the first Ronald 
McDonald Family Room with UCHealth at Me-
morial Hospital Central. Then, St. Francis 
Medical Center opened a second Family 
Room location in their facility. Soon after, Chil-
dren’s Hospital opened up a third Family 
Room, which provides a caring space within 
each hospital for parents, just footsteps away 
from their child. The charity’s cornerstone pro-
grams are vital in meeting the needs of criti-
cally ill children and their families. 
On August 19, 2019, RMHCSC opened the 
doors to their new location at 4223 Royal Pine 
Drive, within walking distance from the new 
Children’s Hospital in Colorado Springs. The 
20-bedroom facility was made possible by cor-
porate donations, grants, and thoughtful gifts 
from private donors. The new facility nearly 
doubles the number of rooms available for 
families. Under the direction of Executive Di-
rector Beth Alessio, who has led the charity 
for the last 20 years, RMHCSC has positioned 
itself to serve families in need for decades to 
come. 
Current President of the Board, Sara 
(Bigari) Cornell—a source of heart and com-
passion behind it all—is living, breathing proof 
that an organization like RMHCSC truly makes 
a difference. Throughout her 38 years, Sara 
has endured over 40 lifesaving surgeries. 
Ronald McDonald House was there for her 
family so that they could focus their love and 
attention on their child when it was most crit-
ical. 
The doors to the Ronald McDonald House 
of Southern Colorado have been open to 
those in need for 35 years. I commend the ef-
fort of Dr. Genrich, Nancy Parker Brummett, 
Steve Bigari, Sara (Bigari) Cornell, Beth 
Alessio, and all of the past and current lead-
ers, board members, staff members, donors, 
and volunteers. Their work has made the 
‘‘House that Love Built’’ a massive success. 
Madam Speaker, I ask that my colleagues 
in Congress join me in congratulating the Ron-
ald McDonald House Charities of Southern 
Colorado for their tireless, godly work making 
Southern Colorado a better place for children 
and families to live.

INTRODUCTION OF THE FARMERS 
MARKET AND FOOD BANK LOCAL 
REVITALIZATION ACT OF 2022 
HON. MARCY KAPTUR 
OF OHIO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, August 12, 2022 
Ms. KAPTUR. Madam Speaker, access to 
affordable, nutritious food is essential to lead-
ing a long and healthy life. Every day, more 
and more Americans are visiting their local 
farmers’ markets and food stands for their 
daily needs. 
As food prices have risen, families and sen-
iors have shouldered a heavier burden when 
shopping at the grocery store. That is why the 
Senior Farmers’ Market Nutrition Program 
(SFMNP) and the Women, Infant, and Chil-
dren Farmers’ Market Program (FMNP) are so 
critical. For more than 20 years, these tried 
and true programs have connected families 
and seniors with food produced by their neigh-
boring farmers benefiting both in a remarkable 
partnership. 
As we kick off National Farmers Market 
Week, I am excited to introduce the Farmers 
Market and Food Bank Local Revitalization 
Act to enhance these programs for the Amer-
ican people. My bill maintains and continues 
current funding for SFMNP, while authorizing 
up to an additional $100 million annually 
through 2028. Furthermore, my bill signifi-
cantly increases the minimum and maximum 
individual benefit amounts for both SFMNP 
and FMNP. 
Recognizing the vital role farmers’ markets 
and food stands play in big cities and small 
towns all across the country, the Farmers Mar-
ket and Food Bank Local Revitalization Act 
strengthens our support for the programs that 
bring together local farmers and the commu-
nities they feed. 
By empowering the U.S. Department of Ag-
riculture to provide new infrastructure loans 
and grants, my bill also invests to expand ex-
isting farmers’ markets and food stands and 
provide opportunities for new ones to grow. 
Finally, my bill establishes a pilot program 
for food banks to contract with local farmers— 
allowing those most in need to receive fresh 
produce and meals. 
The Farmers Market and Food Bank Local 
Revitalization Act is a win-win for all—lifting up 
farmers who make and grow and feed families 
and seniors right in their neighborhoods.

sponders. Lieutenant Butler was recently ap-
pointed to the Michigan Professional Fire 
Fighters Union Behavioral Health Committee,

tions for PEER support teams across the 
state.

African American supervisor since Reconstruc-
tion and retired on December 31, 2007. In ad-
dition to being supervisor, Mr. Welch served 
on the Mississippi Association of Supervisors 
board and was elected to represent seven 
counties on the Central Mississippi Planning 
and Development District legislative com-
mittee. 
Since 
retiring, 
Supervisor 
Welch

fishing. Though his joy is participating in out-
door activities, he is known for always willing 
to be a wise counsel and lend a helping hand.

me in recognizing Mr. Manuel Welch for his 
outstanding service in Crystal Springs, Mis-

PERSONAL EXPLANATION 
HON. GREG PENCE 
OF INDIANA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, August 12, 2022 
Mr. PENCE. Madam Speaker, I am not re-
corded for Roll Call vote No. 418, Roll Call 
vote No. 419, and Roll Call vote No. 420 on 
Friday, August 12, 2022. Since my first day in 
office, I have been squarely focused on what 
I was sent here to do: Represent Hoosiers of 
the 6th Congressional District of Indiana. Un-
fortunately, the out-of-control spending bill 
being rammed through Congress is wrong for 
Hoosiers and wrong for America. Our Nation 
does not need more taxes, does not need 
more spending, and certainly does not need 
more liberal pet-projects being forced upon us 
by the radical left. 
I am wholeheartedly opposed to H.R. 5376, 
the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022—this tax 
and spending spree will push our country fur-
ther into a recession, fuel our rampant infla-
tion, and slow economic growth to a halt. 
Democrats in Washington are intent on crush-
ing the American dream with out-of-control 
wasteful government spending. Instead, we 
should be focusing our efforts on reining in in-
flation for hardworking families, lowering the 
costs of energy through domestic energy pro-
duction, and incentivizing common sense free 
market solutions to spur economic prosperity 
in our communities. 
Had l been present, I would have voted Nay 
on Ordering the Previous Question on H. Res. 
1316 (Roll Call No. 418), Nay on Adoption of 
H. Res. 1316 (Roll Call No. 419), and Nay on 
Final Passage of H.R. 5376 (Roll Call No. 
420).

COMMEMORATING THE LIFE OF 
MICHAEL MORRISON 
HON. PAUL A. GOSAR 
OF ARIZONA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, August 12, 2022 
Mr. GOSAR. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to honor the life of Michael Morrison. Michael 
was a contributor to the common good in a 
myriad of ways. He served his country in the 
Army and the Navy. He continued his career 
in law enforcement at the Monterey County 
Sheriff’s Department and returned overseas to 
work in the securing of U.S. Embassies in Afri-
ca. After seven years in Africa, he founded a 
very successful security company in Arizona 
that still exists to this day—Lionheart Security 
Services. 
I got to know Michael at numerous 
roundtables and town halls throughout the 
years. He was a very sharp guy, who even 
helped me draft legislation shoring up security 
at U.S. Embassies. From my first interactions 
with him, I understood that nothing would stop 
this man from accomplishing the thing he sets 
his mind out to do. I am not at all surprised 
by the enormous success that Lionheart Secu-
rity Services enjoys. 
I do not think that I have ever witnessed a 
resume that screamed patriot more than Mi-
chael—veteran, protector of U.S. government 
officials abroad, dabbler in legislation. When I 
imagine a modern-day pioneer, I think of Mi-
chael. To his family and friends, I offer my sin-
cerest condolences and prayers. This America 
we love is what it is thanks to generous serv-
ants like Michael.

acknowledge and celebrate the exemplary 
leadership and faith-based work of Dr. Corletta

thedral in Michigan’s 13th District Strong for

Expansion; Women who Soar and the founder 
and chancellor of Kingdom and Faith Bible 
College in Detroit, which trains school min-
isters to become leaders. 
In short, Dr. Corletta Vaughn has become a 
pillar in the community and internationally. Her 
work has demonstrated her passion for teach-
ing, preaching, and leadership development 
which strives to create a better future for our 
communities. Please join me in recognition of 
her outstanding achievement. 
HONORING EARL ‘‘SKIP’’ COOPER 
II 
HON. MAXINE WATERS 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, August 12, 2022 
Ms. WATERS. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to honor Earl ‘‘Skip’’ Cooper II for his out-
standing service over many decades to the Af-
rican American business community in the 
United States. 
On August 20, 2022, fifty years to the day 
after Mr. Cooper moved to Los Angeles from 
Oakland, CA, he will be honored by the Black 
Business Association (BBA) in a celebration of 
his 50 years of activism and service. 
Mr. Cooper and I have known each other 
and worked together on numerous projects for 
more than 45 years. We first met when I was 
the Chief of Staff for Los Angeles City Coun-
cilman David Cunningham, and we developed 
an excellent working relationship. Mr. Cooper 
continued to be a trusted advisor when I was 
elected to the California State Assembly and 
then to the United States Congress. 
Before joining the BBA, Mr. Cooper served 
his country in the Vietnam War, was an in-
structor at California State University Los An-
geles and earned a Master’s degree in Busi-
ness Administration from the University of 
Southern California (USC), with an emphasis 
on entrepreneurship. Mr. Cooper’s primary 
focus all these years, has been assisting 
Black businesses survive and grow. 
Founded in 1970, the Black Business Asso-
ciation, headquartered in Los Angeles, is the 
oldest active ethnic business support organi-
zation in the state of California. Originally 
named the Black Businessmen’s Association 
of Los Angeles, the BBA was one of the first 
business groups of any ethnicity to recognize 
and honor the contributions of female entre-
preneurs. Mr. Cooper joined the BBA in 1974, 
became its President/CEO in 1976 and was 
named Executive Director in 1992. 
Always an innovator, Mr. Cooper has contin-
ued to be an effective advocate for the ad-
vancement of minority business enterprise on 
a local, state, and national level. He led the 
first ‘‘trade mission’’ of African Americans to 
meet with the Congressional Black Caucus 
and the White House in the 1970s. He has 
been a close ally and advisor to African Amer-
ican leaders, from Mayor Tom Bradley to Con-
gresswoman Yvonne Brathwaite-Burke, from 
California Speaker Willie Brown to Congress-
woman BARBARA LEE. He is the publisher/edi-
tor of the award-winning Black Business News 
magazine and is quick to assist policy makers 
in crafting legislation that makes it easier for 
minority businesses to succeed. A 100 percent 
Disabled Vietnam Veteran, Mr. Cooper is 
known to most community leaders for his 
sense of humor, his cultural pride, and his un-
abashed devotion to God. He is a savvy and 
intelligent observer of culture, politics, eco-
nomics, and business. His positive, selfless, 
and inspiring energy has contributed much to 
California’s Black community for more than 
half a century. 
I salute Earl ‘‘Skip’’ Cooper II upon BBA’s 
celebration of his 50th anniversary in Los An-
geles and look forward to more opportunities 
to work together in his role as President Emer-
itus and Chairman of BBA’s Board of Direc-
tors.

HONORING MR. AND MRS. FRANK 
LOUELLA WILLIAMS FAMILY TREE 
HON. BENNIE G. THOMPSON 
OF MISSISSIPPI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, August 12, 2022 
Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to honor the family leg-
acy of Mr. and Mrs. Frank Louella Williams’ 
family tree. 
The recorded history of Doc and Rebecca 
Williams and Frank and Louella Williams, 
sons, and daughters of Mississippi soil with 
roots in Yazoo County emanates from the 
Phillip Plantation, now known as the Phillip 
Farm, located in Yazoo County in Mississippi’s 
Second Congressional District. Their descend-
ants, Tommie, ‘‘Doc James, Frank, Jr., Mag-
nolia, Randolph, Laura, Lillie, and Adam (A.C.) 
and their sons and daughters have borne fruit 
up to the 7th generation of progeny with Mis-
sissippi ties. 
The Williams Family descendants from Mis-
sissippi, Illinois, Indiana, New York, Maryland, 
Pennsylvania, Florida, and Texas gathered in 
Washington, D.C., our Nation’s Capital, to cel-
ebrate family and history in the month of July 
2022. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in honoring the family legacy of Mr. and 
Mrs. Frank Louella Williams.

HONORING THE TAHOE FIRE AND 
FUELS TEAM 
HON. TOM McCLINTOCK 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, August 12, 2022 
Mr. MCCLINTOCK. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize the groundbreaking work of 
the Tahoe Fire and Fuels Team in the Lake 
Tahoe Basin. 
The Tahoe Fire and Fuels Team is a group 
of dedicated professionals who have protected 
the homes and businesses of the Tahoe com-
munity for over a decade. Since its founding in 
2008, they have treated over 65,000 acres in 
the Lake Tahoe Basin’s wildland-urban inter-
face. This includes forest thinning by both 
hand and machine, as well as prescribed 
burns. Over twelve years, they have invested 
$133 million into forest health community 
projects to reduce fuels in the forests and pro-
tect the Lake Tahoe region from wildfires. 
Most importantly, the Tahoe Fire and Fuels 
Team played an integral part on the evening 
of August 30, 2021, when the Caldor Fire 
reached the Tahoe Basin with a destruction 
path of 200,000 burned acres and 1,000 de-
stroyed structures left behind it. On this day, 
this team sprang into action to defend the 
communities of Christmas Valley, Meyers, and 
South Lake Tahoe. Remarkably, they success-
fully saved all structures in South Lake Tahoe 
from the destruction of the fire. This was all 
made possible because of their prior efforts to 
reduce forest fuels and increase defenses 
around homes and community buildings. With-
out their past and present efforts, the totality 
of the destruction in these Lake Tahoe com-
munities would be unimaginable. 
The Tahoe Fire and Fuels Team under-
stands, and has demonstrated for years, the 
importance of proactive forest management in 
preventing wildfires. These efforts have pro-
tected communities in the Tahoe Basin and 
significantly improved the resilience of the sur-
rounding landscape. 
Madam Speaker, it is impossible to over-
state the necessity of fire protection or to 
measure the countless contributions this team 
has made to our community. It has been my 
privilege to represent such a dedicated group 
who continuously defends one of California’s 
most remarkable natural treasures. I thank 
Tahoe Fire and Fuels Team for their extraor-
dinary impact on the Lake Tahoe community, 
and the countless individuals they have pro-
tected due to their tireless efforts.

RECOGNIZING ADAM BERG ON HIS 
DEPARTURE 
HON. ROSA L. DeLAURO 
OF CONNECTICUT 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, August 12, 2022 
Ms. DELAURO. Madam Speaker, I rise as 
Chair of the House Appropriations Committee, 
and on behalf of the Members of the Com-
mittee and its staff, to pay tribute to Adam 
Berg as he concludes 15 years of service to 
the House of Representatives. 
Adam began his career with the House 
Committee on Rules, serving under the late 
Chairwoman Louise Slaughter and current 
Chairman JIM
MCGOVERN. Adam faithfully 
served the Rules Committee for 10 years, 
where he began his tenure as an Intern and 
eventually served as Deputy Staff Director and 
Counsel. Throughout his tenure there, he 
found time to attend Georgetown University 
Law Center and the McCourt School of Public 
Policy in the evenings, earning his Juris Doc-
tor and Master of Public Policy in 2010. 
Adam eventually saw the light and, in 2017, 
joined the Appropriations Committee under 
then Ranking Member Lowey. Adam has faith-
fully served as Chief Counsel to the Demo-
cratic staff in the minority and for the current 
majority of the Appropriations Committee for 
the last 5 years. 
During this time, Adam has provided vital 
counsel to me and my colleagues, helping 
guide Floor procedure and shepherd numer-
ous Appropriations bills through the legislative 
process. 
I speak for myself, and I am sure his col-
leagues and other Members, when I say we 
will miss Adam upon his transition. 
I am excited for what the future holds for 
Adam and wish him, his wife Erika, and his 
daughters Ariel and Leila all the best. 
I extend my congratulations to Adam on an 
outstanding congressional career. His country 
thanks him for his hard work.

HONORING THE PUBLIC SERVICE 
OF COUNTY EXECUTIVE JESSIE 
WALLACE 
HON. MARK E. GREEN 
OF TENNESSEE 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, August 12, 2022 
Mr. GREEN of Tennessee. Madam Speak-
er, I rise today to recognize County Executive 
Jessie Wallace for his distinguished career in 
service to the people of Humphreys County, 
Tennessee. 
Mr. Wallace was born to Harris Edwin Wal-
lace and Sara Jane Pewitt Wallace in 
McEwen, Tennessee. Being born and raised 
with his three brothers in Humphreys County, 
he was truly connected to the community and 
well-situated for public service. 
Prior to his tenure as the County Executive, 
Mr. Wallace rose through the ranks of the 
Humphreys County Telephone Company/TDS 
Telecom, starting as a technician and later be-
coming the West Tennessee District Manager. 
He worked hard for the Company for 36 years, 
proving himself to be a diligent and reliable 
worker. 
His hard work and exemplary career did not 
go unnoticed. In 1998, he was elected by his 
community to represent the 4th District on the 
Humphreys County Commission. He served 
ten of his twelve years of commendable serv-
ice on the commission as the Chairman of the 
Public Works and Safety Committee, which 
ensured that the County was a safe place for 
families and businesses to thrive. 
Following his service on the Commission, 
Mr. Wallace was elected as the Humphreys 
County Executive in 2010. Having won the 
trust of his community, he was tasked with the 
duty leading the County toward greater pros-
perity and a higher quality of life, which he 
worked hard to achieve. In the space of only 
eight years, Mr. Wallace’s leadership took the 
unemployment rate of 10.5 percent down to 
only 3.8 percent. 
Having a vast array of skills, a drive for ex-
cellence, and a strong work ethic, Mr. Wallace 
wore many hats during his time as County Ex-
ecutive. He served as Vice Chairman of the 
Workforce Essentials Board of Directors and 
the Middle Tennessee Mayors’ Caucus, and 
also as a member on the board of directors for 
the Meriwether Lewis Electric Cooperative and 
MLConnect. He served on many other boards, 
councils, and corporations, sacrificing his time 
for the good of all Tennesseans. 
Few have worked as hard and tirelessly as 
Mr. Wallace, and fewer still as public servants. 
His tenure as County Executive, however, was 
not without hardships. Mr. Wallace led the 
County through devastating floods in 2019 and 
2021, which caused irreversible damage to the 
property and lives of Humphreys County con-
stituents. In the recent 2021 flood, the County 
lost 20 precious lives. 
But through his steadfast leadership and 
hard work, the County is recovering and re-
building, and Mr. Wallace has ensured that the 
County is in a better place now than when he 
was born into it. He is an exemplar of public 
service, commitment, and capable leadership, 
so it is fitting that we honor him as he con-
cludes his long career of service. On behalf of 
the United States Congress, I congratulate 
County Executive Jessie Wallace on the occa-
sion of his retirement and thank him for his 
service to the people of Humphreys County 
and to all of Tennessee.

IN RECOGNITION OF THE LIFE OF 
RUFUS C. GREEN, II 
HON. SANFORD D. BISHOP, JR. 
OF GEORGIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, August 12, 2022 
Mr. BISHOP of Georgia. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to honor a loving husband, dedi-
cated father, outstanding educator, tireless 
community leader, and dear of friend of long-
standing, Rufus Cullen Green, II. Sadly, he 
passed away on July 28, 2022. A homegoing 
service to celebrate his extraordinary life will 
be held on Saturday, August 13, 2022, at 
10:00 am on the campus of Fort Valley State 
University in the University’s Heath and Phys-
ical Education Complex. 
Mr. Green was born to the union of Lottie 
Hicks Green McCoy and Rufus C. Green, Sr. 
A highly learned man, Mr. Green received his 
Bachelor of Science Degree from Fort Valley 
State College (now university) and a Master of 
Science Degree from the University of Geor-
gia. He also did further studies at Brown Uni-
versity. 
Mr. Green made a difference in the lives of 
our most precious resources, our young peo-
ple. He knew that ‘‘Young people may be forty 
percent of our population, but they are one 
hundred percent of our futures.’’ He began his 
storied career in education as a teacher of 
science and later as the principal of D.F. 
Douglas High School. His final position in his 
educational administration journey was as the 
Assistant Superintendent of the Taylor County 
School System. 
His career in educational administration may 
have ended, but his love of helping people did 
not. Throughout his life he gave his all to 
causes that he loved, and in which he be-
lieved. He epitomized ‘‘manly deeds, scholar-
ship, and love for all mankind as a life mem-
ber of Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity, Inc. He was 
also a member of Sigma Pi Phi Fraternity, the 
Georgia High School Accrediting Commission, 
and the Georgia Kiwanis Club. 
Commissioner Green also served as an 
elected official, serving both on the Taylor 
County Board of Education and the Board of 
Commissioners. 
He loved Fort Valley State University and 
was a member of the Fort Valley State Univer-
sity Foundation. He gave so much to the Uni-
versity and the Wildcat family will miss him im-
mensely. 
But most importantly, Mr. Green was a man 
of faith who put God first in his life. And in 
turn, God blessed him with a wonderful life. 
He was a dedicated member of the St. Phillip 
AME Church. 
Shirley Chisholm once said that ‘‘Service is 
the rent that we pay for the space that we oc-
cupy here on this earth.’’ Rufus Green paid his 
rent, and he paid it well. Mr. Green also treat-
ed people how they deserved to be treated. 
George Washington Carver once said that 
‘‘How far you go in life depends on tender with 
the young, compassionate with the aged, sym-
pathetic with the striving, and tolerant of the 
weak and strong. Because someday in your 
life you will have been all of these.’’ Rufus 
Green went far in life because he never 
swayed from this philosophy in dealing with 
people. 
Mr. Green led a wonderful life but none of 
this would have been possible without the love 
of God and his wonderful family to include his 
loving wife, Bernice S. Green, and his chil-
dren; Rufus C. Green, III, Marcus, and Dr. Lori 
Green. I know that his entire family will miss 
him dearly. 
On a personal note, Mr. Green was my 
friend for many years. He has never told me 
only what I wanted to hear, but he always told 
me what he felt I needed to hear. I will be for-
ever grateful for his wise advice and sage 
counsel. I will miss him dearly. 
Madam Speaker, I ask that my colleagues 
in the House of Representatives join my wife, 
Vivian, and me, along with the people of the 
Second Congressional District of Georgia, in 
paying tribute to the life of Mr. Rufus Cullen 
Green, II and in extending our deepest sym-
pathies to his family, friends, and loved ones 
during this difficult time of bereavement. More-
over, we pray that we will be consoled and 
comforted by an abiding faith and the Holy 
Spirit in the days, weeks, and months ahead.

HONORING LATAISHA JACKSON 
HON. BENNIE G. THOMPSON 
OF MISSISSIPPI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, August 12, 2022 
Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to honor a tenacious and 
innovative woman, Representative Lataisha 
Jackson. 
Lataisha Jackson was born August 4, 1983, 
in Fort Ord, California. At birth, her young par-
ents Ernest Jackson, Sr. and Jennette Jack-
son, and her only sibling Ernest Jackson, were 
stationed at former United States Army post 
on Monterey Bay of the Pacific Ocean. Most 
of the family’s military life was in Berlin, Ger-
many, and where her parents began instilling 
into her and her brother the importance of 
family, faith, and fortitude. The family moved 
to Como, Mississippi, after her father was hon-
orably discharged form the army due to a 
service-connected injury. Representative Jack-
son recalls her mother and father’s greatest 
exemplary measures of the importance of fam-
ily, faith, and fortitude during this time. Rep. 
Jackson credits her strong faith and fortitude 
of her late father and her mother. 
She graduated from North Panola High 
School in 2001. After graduating high school, 
she attended Northwest Community College 
during the summer and then started Alabama 
State University in Montgomery, AL, in August. 
A month after starting college Rep. Jackson’s 
father died at the age of 37 from cancer. Jack-
son honored her father and his sacrifices by 
graduating form Alabama State University in 
2005 with a B.S. in English Language Arts 
Education, and in 2007 with her Master’s in 
Educational Leadership. 
Rep. Jackson’s grandmother Elnora Lee 
Jackson, a longtime educator, encouraged her 
to teach. So, Jackson taught middle and high 
school students in Troy and Montgomery, AL. 
During her time in the classroom, she often re-
flected on educational inequities that she ex-
perienced as a student herself and as an edu-
cator. After working with the City Colleges of 
Chicago and the City of Chicago providing 
summer learning enrichment, Jackson decided 
to return to Mississippi and provide edu-
cational support services to students in rural 
communities to aid them in escaping poverty 
through educational opportunities. Her efforts 
began in 2009 with Back-to-School rallies. 
Then, in September 2010, she founded EDU-
CATE Social and Public Policy, Inc. with her 
brother, Ernest Jackson; Jessica Fitzhugh; 
Paige Dugger; Pedres Finley; and Alvin Jack-
son, Jr. As CEO of EDUCATE, Inc., she has 
led many efforts to provide after school, sum-
mer enrichment, college and career readiness 
opportunities, AAU Basketball, food and trans-
portation security, and other community en-
gagement opportunities. 
In 2013, Mississippi House of Representa-
tives, District 11 seat was vacated by the 
death of former Representative Joe Gardner, 
Jackson ran a successful campaign while 
grieving the death of her maternal grand-
mother Bessie Eppenger. She was sworn into 
the Mississippi House of Representatives on 
April 26, 2013. 
She currently serves as the Vice Chair of In-
vestigate State Offices and serves on Appro-
priations, Judiciary B, Universities and Col-
leges, Local and Private Legislation, and Pub-
lic Property committees. After joining her col-
leagues in legislative efforts to enhance the 
quality of life for Mississippians, Representa-
tive Jackson realize how important it was for 
her to fulfill her childhood dream and become 
an attorney. So, Rep. Jackson enrolled in the 
summer of 2014 at the University of Mis-
sissippi School of Law and graduated in De-
cember 2017 with her juris doctor degree. 
In 2014, the National Foundation of Women 
Legislation recognized Rep. Jackson as an 
Elected Woman of Excellence, and she cur-
rently serves as the Mississippi State Director 
for the organization. In 2018, the American 
Council of Young Political Leaders chose her 
as a member of their seven-member delega-
tion to travel to China and Taiwan, and to join 
a network of over 8,500 alumni in 128 coun-
tries and territories. Rep. Jackson tenure in-
cludes legislative effort to increase dignity for 
incarcerated women, infrastructure improve-
ment and development specifically for low tax 
base communities, economic and workforce 
development, and education reform. She has 
collaborated with several advocates and orga-
nizations to elevate conversations and aware-
ness of the needs of incarcerated women by 
providing a Hope Luncheon for Incarcerated 
Women in Central Correctional Facility in 
Pearl, MS, for the past four years. In 2021, 
she traveled to Ghana, then to Nigeria in 2022 
to encourage trade and business efforts be-
tween those in diaspora. Jackson is currently 
working with German leaders to consider Mis-
sissippi for German American industries. 
Rep. Jackson enjoys gleaning wisdom from 
her grandfather, Mack Holt, and being an ora-
tor while encouraging others through spoken 
words. She has used the power of words and 
faith during her commencement speeches at 
her alma maters Alabama State University in 
2019 and North Panola High School, at sev-
eral churches and events, and she looking to 
be in the commencement speaker for North-
west Community College’s Summer Gradua-
tion on August 1, 2022. 
Rep. Jackson is the proud godmother of two 
amazingly gifted and talented godchildren- 
Cedquavious Hunter and Lauren Perry, that 
she loves dearly. She is an active member of 
Askew Grove M.B. Baptist Church in Sarah, 
MS. As a Beta Pi initiated member of Alpha 
Kappa Alpha Sorority Incorporated, she con-
tinues her service to all mankind as a member

APPRECIATING INDIA 
HON. JOE WILSON 
OF SOUTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, August 12, 2022 
Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Madam 
Speaker, August 15th is a significant date in 
world history as it marks the 75th Anniversary 
of the independence of the Republic of India. 
The landmark occasion is being celebrated as 
an historic democratic victory in a festival 
called Azadi Ka Amrit Mahotsav. 
America especially rejoices for the people of 
India as the world’s oldest democracy cele-
brates the world’s largest democracy. 2022 is 
especially significant as democracies (rule of 
law) are threatened by authoritarians (rule of 
gun), exemplified by war criminal Putin mur-
derously invading Ukraine, the Chinese Com-
munist Party threatening Taiwan, and Iranian 
theocrats chanting Death to Israel, Death to 
America. World chaos is also a threat to the 
people of India. 
As the son of a U.S. Army Air Corps mem-
ber in the Flying Tigers who served in India 
and China, I grew up with an appreciation of 
the work ethic my father recognized in India. 
As a real estate attorney in South Carolina, I 
welcomed new investors who bought hotels 
and motels creating jobs across the state. 
In Congress I chaired the largest country 
Caucus, the Caucus of India and Indian Amer-
icans. I will be forever grateful to have been 
with Governor Nikki Haley (America’s second 
Indian American Governor) to welcome Prime 
Minister Narendra Modi to Center Ring of 
Madison Square Garden in New York City. I 
was also on the escort committee for the 
Prime Minister’s address to Congress. I was 
present with President Donald Trump for the 
historic ’Howdy Modi’ celebration in Houston, 
Texas, with over 50,000 Indian-Americans in 
attendance. Additionally, I attended the Prime 
Minister’s 2019 Independence Day address at 
the Red Fort in New Delhi, India. 
Over the years, I have had the opportunity 
to serve with the Consul General of India in 
Atlanta, Dr. Swati V. Kulkarni, who is pas-
sionate for the people of India. 
The 75th Anniversary is an opportunity for 
the shared values of India and America to be 
fulfilled. President Donald Trump correctly 
identified the Indo-Pacific Command as a way 
to promote Indian-U.S. military cooperation for 
Peace Through Strength. India’s proven indus-
trial capabilities provide an opportunity to re-
duce dependence on foreign military sales. 
The future is bright for the people of India 
and with our shared values of democracy, the 
future is bright for a strong alliance of India 
and America. 
HONORING THE LIFE OF JOE 
PARADISO 
HON. JOE COURTNEY 
OF CONNECTICUT 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, August 12, 2022 
Mr. COURTNEY. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to pay tribute to a true hometown hero 
of 
Eastern 
Connecticut, 
attorney 
Joseph 
Paradiso, of Stafford Springs, Connecticut, 
who passed away sadly but peacefully at his 
home on Monday, August 8, 2022, at the age 
of 87. 
Born a Stafford Springs native to Joseph Sr. 
and Rachele Paradiso, Joe was always des-
tined to serve as a steward of his community. 
Having graduated from Cheshire Academy, he 
was educated and trained in the Jesuit tradi-
tion at the College of Holy Cross and George-
town Law in Washington, D.C. That tradition 
which infuses the highest standards of learn-
ing with a deep ethical core, clearly molded 
Joe’s thoughtful, caring approach to the prac-
tice of law and his interaction with people from 
all walks of life. 
A gentleman who was captivated by oppor-
tunities to serve in any form, Joe joined the 
U.S. Army after earning his law degree. Upon 
his discharge, the pull of his roots in his home 
state of Connecticut brought him back to Staf-
ford Springs to begin his career in law. Joe in 
many ways was a Stafford Springs version of 
the iconic small-town lawyer, Atticus Finch 
from ‘‘To Kill a Mockingbird.’’ Joe wore the 
badge of his alma mater with a sense of duty, 
gaining a reputation as a balanced, fair-mind-
ed prosecutor with a deep fidelity to the law. 
Madam Speaker, as a lawyer practicing in the 
same Tolland County community as Joe, I 
spent a lot of time in the courtrooms with him, 
working on cases that are a staple to small 
town America. I was fortunate enough over 
many years of working side by side, to earn 
Joe’s friendship and get a close-up view of ex-
actly who Joe was during his 37-year-long ca-
reer as a prosecutor in the Rockville Superior 
Court system. I can attest, Madam Speaker, to 
the vibrant spirit that was Joe’s heart—his 
fierce stance for taking the moral path regard-
less of the forces in opposition, and his re-
spect for both people and clients regardless of 
their identity or background. Joe was both 
highly competent and fair, causing residents 
from all over the surrounding region to seek 
out his help in their moments of need. His big 
heart was willing to help them all. 
A beloved pillar of the community in Staf-
ford, Joe wore many hats outside of his own 
practice. Even as I left the court room to run 
for public office, it is worth noting that I, too, 
continued to have dealings with him under his 
various roles within the community. Reflective 
of his lifelong passion to lift the voices of 
those around him, he was a staunch advocate 
for individuals with disabilities. Joe in fact co- 
founded Journey Found, a nonprofit organiza-
tion with a mission to advance disability sup-
port services for individuals. Journey Found 
was organized in 2013 to fill the void left by 
a facility closure, which would have resulted in 
the disruption of the lives of more than 250 cli-
ents and staff, had Joe and the team at Jour-
ney Found not stepped in. Outside of his elec-
tive roles of advocacy, Joe remained involved 
and a known constant in Stafford through sev-
eral other roles, including, for example, his 
regular commitment to community outings, in-
volvement in numerous benefit societies, 
membership within the Stafford Rotary Club 
and tenure on the Stafford Public Schools 
Board of Education. 
Madam Speaker, it has been an honor to 
know and represent constituents of Eastern 
Connecticut like Joe Paradiso. He has been 
an inspiration and guiding light for countless 
members of our surrounding community, and 
his altruistic presence will be sorely missed. 
Predeceased by his wife Donna, Joe is sur-
vived by his three children, Joseph Paradiso 
III, Christopher Paradiso, and Rachel Paradiso 
as well as their respective families. Though we 
will mourn the enormous void left in his wake, 
it is an honor to join with his family and com-
munity in carrying his memory forward, 
purposing it as an example for others. To that 
end, I ask that my colleagues in the House 
join me in saying farewell to an old friend and 
mentor, Joe Paradiso.

IN REMEMBRANCE OF AUDENCIO 
SUAREZ DIAZ, JR. 
HON. JOAQUIN CASTRO 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, August 12, 2022 
Mr. CASTRO of Texas. Madam Speaker, 
today I rise in honor of Audencio Suarez Diaz, 
Jr. who passed away on August 2, 2022, after 
a long battle with cancer. He is survived by his 
wife of 49 years, Mary Stella; his son Rolando 
and daughter-in-law Amy; his daughter Leticia 
and grandson Rhys, and his brother, Daniel. 
He is also survived by nieces, nephews, and 
extended family. A man of conviction and 
courage, his loss is felt in our hometown of 
San Antonio, Texas. He will be greatly missed. 
Audencio Diaz was born on February 19, 
1952, in San Antonio. Audencio served honor-
ably in the United States Marine Corps during 
the Vietnam War. After leaving the service, he 
worked for the United States Postal Service 
and the San Antonio Independent School Dis-
trict. Later, he started his own janitorial busi-
ness. Audencio was known in the community 
for his many philanthropic activities and his 
strong support for our Veterans. For the past 
decade, Audencio devoted his time to serving 
other Veterans as Vice President of the Edge-
wood District Veterans group. Audencio was 
also known for his love of baseball, devoting 
many years to the Spanish American Baseball 
League. He was an active baseball player in 
the league during the 1960s and 1970s and 
later served as a board member in the 1990s. 
Madam Speaker, please join me in recog-
nizing the life of Audencio Suarez Diaz, Jr. Al-
though I am saddened by his loss, I know his 
legacy will last for years to come. I thank 
Audencio for his service and efforts to make 
San Antonio a better place. May God bless 
him and his loved ones.

CONGRATULATING 
HUCKLEBERRY’S 
PIZZA 
ON 
30 
YEARS 
OF 
SERVICE 
TO 
THE 
QUAD CITIES COMMUNITY 
HON. CHERI BUSTOS 
OF ILLINOIS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, August 12, 2022 
Mrs. BUSTOS. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to congratulate Huckleberry’s Pizza in Rock Is-
land, Illinois for having provided excellent cus-
tomer service, delicious pizza and calzones 
and lasting memories to residents of the Quad 
Cities community for 30 years. 
Located 
in 
downtown 
Rock 
Island, 
Huckleberry’s Pizza has been a staple in the 
Quad Cities region since it opened. The res-
taurant’s owner, Jon Keim, has been instru-
mental in growing the popular eatery into what 
it is today. He purchased the restaurant’s cur-
rent building three decades ago, and despite 
it not originally being a restaurant, he built a 
kitchen, knocked down interior walls, and 
worked tirelessly to make his vision a reality. 
As it continued to grow, so did his dedication 
to his business and his desire to forge a din-
ing environment that would unify the region. 
When the COVID–19 pandemic and ensuing 
labor shortage challenged small businesses 
like Huckleberry’s Pizza, it forced the iconic 
dining room to close. But once again, Mr. 
Keim did not relent. Thirty years later, his res-
taurant is still serving customers. I look for-
ward to Huckleberry’s Pizza’s continued pres-
ence in downtown Rock Island for many years 
to come. 
It is because of seminal establishments 
such as Huckleberry’s Pizza that I am espe-
cially proud to serve Illinois’ 17th Congres-
sional District. Madam Speaker, I would like 
to, again, formally congratulate Huckleberry’s 
Pizza in Rock Island for their contributions to 
the Quad Cities community for over 30 years.

HONORING LATISHA RUDD BOOTHE 
HON. BENNIE G. THOMPSON 
OF MISSISSIPPI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, August 12, 2022 
Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to honor a tenacious and 
self-motivated leader, Latisha Rudd Boothe. 
Latisha Rudd Boothe, born LaTisha Lasha 
Rudd, on May 30, 1977, in Batesville, Mis-
sissippi, to Mr. Clarence Leon Rudd, Jr. and 
Mrs. Mary Frances Rudd. 
She is the wife of Leonard Boothe; mother 
of Tyler Douglass Rudd and Kyla Maree 
Rudd; stepmother to Anderson Boothe and 
Christopher Boothe; sister of Darryl Leon 
Rudd, Dwayne Dupree Rudd and the late Der-
rick Demoyne Rudd; and the granddaughter of 
the late Mr. Clarence Rudd, Sr. and Mrs. Betty 
Jean Rudd, and the late Mr. Frank Douglass 
Oliver and Mrs. Marie Towns Oliver. 
Latisha attended grade school in the South 
Panola School District, where she graduated 
in May 1996. She then attended Northwest 
Mississippi Community College in Senatobia, 
MS, where she received an Associate of Arts 
Degree. She graduated with honors (Phi Theta 
Kappa) in May 1998. Next, Latisha attended 
Mississippi State University in Mississippi 
State, MS, where she received a Bachelor of 
Arts degree. She graduated with honors 
(Magna Cum Laude) in May 2000. She re-
ceived her Master of Education degree from 
Grand Canyon University in Phoenix, AZ, 
where she graduated with honors in October 
2010. Latisha is also overwhelmingly thankful 
that she was not born in a time in which she 
was privy to segregation and the harsh reali-
ties of poverty and extreme racial tensions as 
her parents and grandparents were. The sto-
ries were so powerful and impactful to Latisha 
that she and her grandmother, Marie Towns 
Oliver, decided to write a biography entitled, 
83 Years in the South, which is a compilation 
of her grandmother’s historv and experiences 
living in Mississippi. Once Latisha graduated 
from Mississippi State University, she moved 
to North Hollywood, CA, where she was hired 
as an Extra on the television sitcom, My Wife 
and Kids. Although the role of an Extra did not 
afford her the airtime in which she desired, 
she had the privilege to meet and consistently 
share the same spaces with well-known enter-
tainers and actors. 
In 2002, Latisha was sitting in her living 
room, in herapartment in North Hollywood, 
when she began to think of home and of mov-
ing back home, so that she could have a con-
sistent hand in raising her son, as he was still 
living in Mississippi with her mother. After 
months of pondering the move, she made the 
decision to return to Mississippi. It seemed as 
if it was instantaneous that her mother began 
to have on-going conversations with Latisha 
about securing a job in the field of education. 
She would also remind Latisha of how she be-
lieves that Latisha is meant to be a teacher. 
Latisha’s mother’s words eventuallv sparked a 
fire inside of Latisha, and in 2003, Latisha ap-
plied for and was given the opportunity to 
serve as Biology teacher in the North Panola 
School District in Sardis, MS, where 99 per-
cent of her students were African American 
and over 85 percent of them were poverty 
stricken. Due to Latisha’s unique teaching 
styles and unorthodox teaching methods, her 
students scored amongst the highest, annu-
ally, on the Biology state test. Something that 
had never been accomplished before in this 
school district. Indeed, Latisha’s mother was 
right; teaching was Latisha’s calling and ca-
reer niche. 
In 2010, Latisha transitioned to the Quitman 
County School District in Marks, MS, where 
she served as Special Education Itinerant/In-
clusion teacher until 2016, where she began 
her tenure as the school district’s Special Edu-
cation Director. Working with students with 
disabilities has proven to be a humbling yet 
meaningful experience for Latisha. Her plans 
to continue to ensure that students with dis-
abilities have a fair chance at meeting their 
goals in life is one of Latisha’s career commit-
ments. In 2018, Quitman County School Dis-
trict ranked No. 3 in the State of Mississippi 
for producing the highest number of students 
with disabilities to graduate with a Traditional 
High School Diploma. This is quite an accom-
plishment and one of the first of its kind for 
this school district. 
In 2018, Latisha also became one of the 
eight Mediators and IEP Facilitators for the 
state of Mississippi, a position in which she 
presently holds. In this position, she is af-
forded the opportunity to work with school dis-
tricts, parents, and students with disabilities 
across the state of Mississippi in increasing 
their knowledge of Special Education. 
Longing to become a part of a society much 
larger than herself in which she could work 
with other likeminded individuals in an effort to 
continue to make positive differences in the 
lives of others, was an opportunity in which 
Latisha searched far and wide. Then in 2007, 
she found just that. Latisha discovered an or-
ganization 
whose 
mission 
and 
purpose 
matched her very own, Delta Sigma Theta So-
rority, Inc. 
Latisha Rudd Boothe may not have all of 
the accolades as many others; she may not 
have the acronyms in the front and in the back 
of her name; however, she is very proud of 
her past and her present, and she is excitedly 
looking forward to her future. She has made 
and is continuing to make positive and life 
changing differences in the lives of many, and 
in the words of encouragement that Latisha 
often shares with the young people in which 
she encounters, ‘‘The Best is Yet to Come.’’ 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in recognizing Latisha Rudd Boothe for her 
dedication to serving her community and this 
great state.

HOMETOWN HERO—GARLAND ISD 
HON. BETH VAN DUYNE 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, August 12, 2022 
Ms. VAN DUYNE. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize Garland ISD for its dedica-
tion to ensure our North Texas veterans are 
set up for success when they return home. 
Last month, after recognizing the statewide 
struggle to find employees, Garland ISD 
partnered with Soldiers to Sidelines—a non-
profit aimed at helping soldiers get the train-
ing, credentialing, and even the networking 
needed to build post military careers in coach-
ing. 
I have met with several veterans’ groups 
across North Texas, and they have all ex-
pressed the immense challenges they face 
transitioning into civilian life. By partnering with 
Soldiers to Sidelines, Garland ISD has af-
firmed its commitment to helping the heroes of 
North Texas overcome this obstacle. 
It is imperative we lift up and support the 
veterans who have risked it all for our country. 
I’d like to thank Garland ISD for going above 
and beyond to do exactly that.

HONORING JOE JOHNSON 
HON. H. MORGAN GRIFFITH

Mr. GRIFFITH. Madam Speaker, I rise today

Abingdon, Virginia, who passed away at the 
age of 90 on August 4, 2022. My friend and 
former colleague was a true gentleman with a 
distinguished record of longtime service to 
Southwest Virginia. 
Joseph Pickett Johnson, Jr., was born in 
Hayter’s Gap, Virginia, on December 12, 
1931, to Joseph Pickett Johnson, Sr., and 
Gray Henderson Johnson. He served in the 
United States Air Force from 1951 to 1955, 
during which he spent a period in the Marshall

Islands while nuclear tests took place. After 
his service, Joe returned to Virginia to earn a 
bachelor’s degree at Emory & Henry College, 
my alma mater as well, and a law degree at 
the University of Richmond. 
In 1960, Joe started practicing law in 
Abingdon. Five years later, he was elected to 
the Virginia House of Delegates. Joe served 
on the House Police and Militia Committee 
and was a ranking member of the Roads 
Committee and the Insurance and Banking 
Committee. Traveling between Abingdon and 
Richmond was more time-consuming then 
than now, so in 1969 Joe chose not to run 
again in order to help his wife Ann raise their 
three children Mary Jo, Joe III, and Sage. 
From 1971 to 1989, he served as a substitute 
judge for the 28th General District Court. 
Twenty years after leaving the House of 
Delegates, he was elected to it again and re-
tained his seat until retiring in 2014. He served 
on the Finance, Courts of Justice, Commerce 
and Labor, and Rules Committees. As a dele-
gate from 1994 to 2011, I saw firsthand how 
effective Joe could be. In his unfailingly friend-
ly manner, he championed the needs of 
Southwest Virginia. He worked to set up and 
served as a member of the Virginia Tobacco 
Commission, was a major contributor to estab-
lishing the community college system, and 
helped establish the Southwest Virginia Higher 
Education Center in Abingdon. Although a 
Democrat, he was well-liked by colleagues on 
both sides of the aisle, including me. After his 
passing, Republicans who served with him or 
succeeded him have been effusive in their 
tributes to this gentleman who did so much for 
our region. 
In addition to his service as an elected offi-
cial, Joe led or was involved in numerous civic 
and community organizations. He was a mem-
ber of American Legion Post No. 12 in 
Abingdon and served as post commander. As 
a loyal alumnus of Emory & Henry, he served 
on its Board of Trustees for fourteen years, 
chairing the board for eight. At the Abingdon 
Baptist Church he devoutly worshipped at for 
more than 45 years, he taught Sunday school 
and served on the Council of Deacons. He 
was a president of the Washington County Bar 
Association and a member of the Virginia Bar 
Association. Other organizations he was a 
member of included the Abingdon Civitans, 
Abingdon Masonic Lodge No. 48, Kazim 
Shriners, Abingdon Chapter No. 182 Order of 
Eastern Star, and McCabe Lodge No. 56 Inde-

CELEBRATING 250 YEARS OF THE 
LAUREL 
HILL 
PRESBYTERIAN 
CHURCH 
HON. GUY RESCHENTHALER 
OF PENNSYLVANIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, August 12, 2022 
Mr. RESCHENTHALER. Madam Speaker, I 
rise to recognize the Laurel Hill Presbyterian 
Church and congratulate its congregation for 
250 years of service to God and their commu-
nity in southwestern Pennsylvania. 
The Laurel Hill Presbyterian Church was 
built in 1772 by Scotch-Irish immigrants, and 
the original log structure was the first Pres-
byterian Church west of the Allegheny Moun-
tains. The church was rebuilt in 1782, 1852, 
and 1898 as the congregation grew. Where 
the church once featured beeswax-coated win-
dows, its sanctuary is now home to 110-year- 
old English stained-glass windows and an or-
nate chimney. 
In 2012, Pittsburgh’s Heinz History Center 
featured the Laurel Hill Presbyterian Church 
for its profound influence on southwestern 
Pennsylvania. During the 19th and 20th cen-
turies, the church funded the Laurel Hill Acad-
emy. William A. Clark attended this private 
school and later became a United States Sen-
ator from Montana. 
The church’s cemetery serves as a testa-
ment to the history of the region and our Na-
tion. The 7-acre burial ground is the final rest-
ing place for veterans of the French and In-
dian War, with several graves belonging to 
Native Americans. Other headstones mark the 
resting places of those who joined the fight for 
independence during the American Revolution. 
The Laurel Hill Cemetery is also home to 
Americans who fought to preserve our Union 
during the Civil War. The headstones of these 
veterans serve as a reminder of the struggles 
that strengthened our great Nation. 
Madam Speaker, the story of the Laurel Hill 
Presbyterian Church is uniquely American. 
The church has stood as a testament to its 
faith for 250 years, and I look forward to what 
the next chapter has in store for its congrega-
tion and community.

RECOGNIZING 100 YEARS OF SAN 
JACINTO GIRL SCOUTS 
HON. SYLVIA R. GARCIA 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, August 12, 2022 
Ms. GARCIA of Texas. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to recognize 100 years of the Girl 
Scouts of San Jacinto Council, in the 29th 
Texas Congressional District. 
The Girl Scouts of San Jacinto Council was 
founded in 1922 by Corinne Fonde and 
Frances Mann Law. This year, 2022, marks a 
full century of the council empowering girls 
across my district. The San Jacinto Council is 
a community-based organization and is one of 
the country’s largest girl scout councils, with 
more than 35,000 girl members and 14,000 
adult members. It serves 26 counties across 
Southwest Texas, including Houston and Har-
ris counties and aims to build girls of ‘‘cour-
age, confidence, and character, who make the 
world a better place.’’ 
The Girl Scouts of San Jacinto Council pro-
vides girls of all backgrounds the opportunity 
to explore the outdoors, STEM-based learning, 
entrepreneurship, and valuable life skill les-
sons. Through these girl scout programs, 
Texan girls of all ages establish strong rela-
tionships and abilities that they will carry with 
them beyond their girl scout years. Girls are 
encouraged to find their passions, tackle a 
wide range of challenges, and express them-
selves through various activities and pro-
grams. The council is also committed to diver-
sity and inclusion, and works to engage in crit-
ical conversations with members about how to 
ensure inclusivity through Girl Scout values. 
Madam Speaker, I ask that my colleagues 
join me in commending the Girl Scouts of San 
Jacinto Council for 100 years of service to 
girls across local Texas communities, and 
wish them all the best in their future endeav-
ors.

HONORING BEALE AIR FORCE 
BASE 
HON. DOUG LaMALFA 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, August 12, 2022 
Mr. LAMALFA. Madam Speaker, today I 
would like to recognize the 75th anniversary of 
the U.S. Air Force and the positive contribu-
tion of Beale Air Force Base to the Yuba Sut-
ter Community since 1942. 
For 75 years, American Airmen and women 
have excelled as they execute the Air Force 
mission to fly, fight, and win—delivering air-
power anytime, anywhere in defense of our 
nation. 
Airmen and women are called to ‘‘innovate, 
accelerate, and thrive’’ as the U.S. Air Force 
and Department of the Air Force approach 
their 75th anniversaries on September 18, 
2022. Airmen and women will always be there 
to provide America with the airpower it needs 
to defend the Nation, deter or defeat our ad-
versaries, reassure our partners and allies, 
and help diplomacy proceed from a position of 
strength. 
Airmen and women continue to push tech-
nological and cultural boundaries which make 
America the leader in airpower and space 
power. Innovation is an integral part of how 
we train and employ our squadrons, develop 
our capabilities, and continue to move toward 
an even more effective Air Force. 
From their inception 75 years ago, the U.S. 
Air Force and Department of the Air Force 
have excelled at keeping pace with rapid 
changes in technology and in the demands 
placed on the Air Force’s five core missions: 
air superiority; global strike; rapid global mobil-
ity; intelligence, surveillance, and reconnais-
sance; and command and control. 
Camp Beale opened in October 1942 as a 
training site for the 13th Armored and the 81st 
and 96th Infantry Divisions. Today Beale Air 
Force Base is home for the U–2 Dragon Lady, 
T–38 Talon and RQ–4 Global Hawk. The 
base, covering nearly 23,000 acres, is home 
to more than 4,500 military personnel. Beale 
AFB has an unique name and mission, a his-
toric past, and a promising future. 
I recognize the 75th anniversary of the U.S. 
Air Force and the positive contribution of 
Beale Air Force Base to the Yuba Sutter Com-
munity since 1942. I am proud to represent 
this Air Force Base.

PEACE BETWEEN RUSSIA AND 
UKRAINE 
HON. PAUL A. GOSAR 
OF ARIZONA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, August 12, 2022 
Mr. GOSAR. Madam Speaker, it is an obvi-
ous fact that the conflict in Ukraine has led to 
an inordinate amount of human suffering. As 
much as global elites insincerely bemoan the 
death and devastation, their tinkering and 
meddling in Eastern Europe—treating coun-
tries with long, complicated histories almost as 
pieces on a chess board—has done nothing to 
bring about peace. 
With the American working class suffering 
from crippling inflation and still reeling from 
unconstitutional and abusive lockdowns, send-
ing billions of dollars to a country 6,000 miles 
away takes ‘‘out-of-touch’’ to a new level. 
Could what happened in Afghanistan—billions 
of dollars-worth of defense equipment squan-
dered and left in the hands of our enemies— 
occur again in Ukraine? Two large French ar-
tillery units have already been captured by the 
Russians. Is that a foretaste of another Af-
ghanistan-like debacle? 
Politically correct politicians on both sides of 
the aisle are constantly preaching about the 
need to send more arms, more aid, more sup-
port to Ukraine. One word that is noticeably 
absent is the word ‘‘peace.’’ Instead of con-
stant finger pointing, world leaders should be 
doing all in their power to facilitate negotia-
tions and make reasoned arguments for why 
peace benefits both countries. 
The problem with peace is that the Biden 
administration would no longer have a distrac-
tion to their horrific domestic crises—ridiculous 
inflation, a tepid housing market, a weak sup-
ply chain, an invasion of criminal illegal aliens, 
failing public schools, and a deadly drug epi-
demic, to name a few. 
The obstinacy implicit in this conflict— 
Putin’s insistence on Donbas and Zelensky’s 
determination to oppose him—highlights the 
error of attempting to intrude in foreign affairs 
not connected to American security. An 
amendment I offered to the National Defense 
Authorization Act requires the Biden adminis-
tration to explain their objectives that would 
justify involvement in a country thousands of 
miles away. It was ignored. 
America’s military strength has served as a 
deterrent to hostile foreign powers over its his-
tory. However, aid to Ukraine has depleted 
military stockpiles. A quarter of Stinger mis-
siles and a third of Javelins have been sent to 
Ukraine. An expert from the Center for Stra-
tegic and International Studies estimates that 
it could take 32 months to restock the Jave-
lins. And that was when the U.S. had only 
spent $2.6 billion total. Now, the tally isup to 
$63 billion. Imagine how strong our military 
would be if that money was invested here at 
home. 
The United States is weaker as a result of 
interference in Eastern Europe. Russia is de-
pleted. Ukraine is devastated. Sending money 
to Ukraine extends and fuels war. Can peace 
be 
obtained 
through 
diplomatic 
means? 
Maybe. But U.S. military involvement has only 
worsened the conflict.

HONORING THE LIFE OF DEPUTY 
ANDREW PEERY 
HON. DOUG LAMBORN 
OF COLORADO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, August 12, 2022 
Mr. LAMBORN. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today on behalf of Congressman KEVIN 
MCCARTHY and myself, to honor the life of El 
Paso County Sheriff Deputy Andrew Peery. 
Deputy Peery was tragically killed in the line of 
duty on August 7, 2022, in Colorado Springs, 
Colorado. 
Andrew Peery was born in Frazier Park, 
California, on December 12, 1982, to parents 
David and Sandy Peery. He graduated from 
Frazier Mountain High School in 2001. 
After graduating, Andrew joined the United 
States Army. He became part of the pres-
tigious 173rd Airborne Unit based out of 
Vicenza, Italy, where he served as an 11B In-
fantryman. Andrew and his platoon were some 
of the first boots on the ground during the air-
borne assault into Iraq in March of 2003. He 
later served with the 4th Infantry Division at 
Fort Carson, Colorado. 
While in the Army, Andrew held a top-secret 
clearance, developing and executing over 600 
operations to maintain foreign relations in sup-
port of Operation Iraqi Freedom. Andrew 
Peery served three tours of duty in Iraq. Dur-
ing the first two tours, he was a sniper. 
A decorated veteran, Andrew was awarded 
seven Army Commendation Medals, three 
Army Achievement Medals, and a Meritorious 
Service Medal for his service. Andrew medi-
cally retired from the Army as a Staff Sergeant 
in 2013. 
Andrew then returned to Bakersfield, Cali-
fornia, to work as a police officer and served 
in the Gang Unit for the Bakersfield Police De-
partment from 2013 until 2016. While at the 
Bakersfield Police Department, Andrew re-
ceived a commendation for his life-saving ef-
forts helping a stabbing victim. He also volun-
teered over 100 hours of his time for the Cali-
fornia Special Olympics. 
In November of 2016, Andrew was hired on 
with the El Paso County Sheriff’s Office as a 
lateral transfer from the Bakersfield Police De-
partment. He was assigned to the midnight 
shift on patrol and later transferred to the Tac-
tical Support Unit, becoming a part of the aux-
iliary SWAT team. After becoming a full-time 
SWAT Team member, Deputy Peery served 
as the Sniper Team Leader. Additionally, An-
drew was assigned to the Gang Unit, served

as a Field Training Officer, a Firearms Instruc-
tor, and a Close Quarter Battle Instructor. 
During his time at the El Paso County Sher-
iffs Office, Andrew was awarded numerous 
commendations, including five letters of appre-
ciation, three Coins of Excellence, two Distin-
guished Service Awards, two Commander Ci-
tations, and a Leadership Award. 
Andrew met his wife, Meghan, a school-
teacher, in November of 2004 in Colorado 
Springs. They were married in July of 2005. 
Together, they have two children, Matthew 
and Amy. Andrew was passionate about 
mountain biking, music, and spending time 
with his family and friends. According to his 
wife Meghan, ‘‘Andrew was an adrenaline 
junky.’’ He loved watching his son, Matthew, 
run cross-country and track and supported 
Amy as she pursued gymnastics. Matthew 
shares a love of mountain biking with his fa-
ther. Andrew deeply loved his family, his com-
munity, and our great nation. 
Andrew is survived by the love of his life, 
his wife Meghan; his children Matthew and 
Amy; his mother Sandy Peery; his siblings 
Matthew 
Peery 
(Chelsea), 
Mark 
Peery 
(Gabriela), Donovan Peery, and Sarah (Peery) 
Beagley (Brad); and many nieces and neph-
ews. He is preceded in death by his brother 
Davey Peery; and his father, David, who 
served over 20 years with the Los Angeles 
Police Department and later as an investigator 
with the Kern County District Attorney’s Office. 
Andrew was a great asset to the El Paso 
County Sheriff’s Office and the Bakersfield Po-
lice Department and showed his commitment 
to the department with enthusiasm and dedi-
cation. He is remembered as a man of prin-
ciple and honor who served both his commu-
nity and his country heroically. 
Madam Speaker, we ask our colleagues in 
Congress to join us in mourning the loss of El 
Paso County Sheriff Deputy Andrew Peery 
and in standing with the Thin Blue Line.

HONORING 
THE 
FIFTIETH 
ANNI-
VERSARY OF THE ARMSTRONG 
AIR AND SPACE MUSEUM 
HON. JIM JORDAN 
OF OHIO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, August 12, 2022 
Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, fifty-three 
years ago this summer, Commander Neil Arm-
strong and his Apollo 11 crewmates achieved 
something once thought impossible: Success-
fully landing on the moon and returning safely 
to Earth. They succeeded despite the life- 
threatening dangers they faced and the count-
less things that could have gone wrong during 
their mission. 
I am especially honored to represent Neil 
Armstrong’s birthplace: Wapakoneta, Ohio, 
which takes great pride in being the home of 
the Armstrong Air and Space Museum. Pro-
posed by then-Ohio Governor James A. 
Rhodes and built with matching funds from 
area residents, the museum opened on July 
20, 1972—three years to the day after the his-
toric first moon landing. 
Now under the stewardship of the non-profit 
Armstrong Air and Space Museum Associa-
tion, the museum has expanded through the 
last half-century to celebrate not just the ca-
reer of Neil Armstrong but also the contribu-
tions of many other Ohioans to aviation and 
space exploration. 
This year’s Summer Moon Festival, held 
from July 12 to July 17, featured several spe-
cial events at the museum in celebration of its 
anniversary—including meet-and-greets with 
astronauts, new displays of artifacts from the 
museum’s opening, and a drivable lunar rover 
replica. A July 20 gala at the museum was 
headlined by Larry Connor of Dayton, Axiom 
Mission 1 astronaut and founder and man-
aging partner of The Connor Group. 
Madam Speaker, on behalf of the people of 
Ohio’s Fourth Congressional District, I thank 
the staff and countless supporters of the Arm-
strong Air and Space Museum for their ongo-
ing work to celebrate the life and lasting im-
pact of Neil Armstrong, a man who ‘‘took a 
small step but left a giant legacy.’’

overall effectiveness of leadership for local 
elected/appointed officials. She and her staff 
has developed a maturing relationship in voter 
education and outreach with the Humphreys 
County Board of Supervisors, the Humphreys 
County public and private schools, as well as 
several other local and statewide political enti-
ties. She has diligently worked to promote 
more voter registration update awareness and, 
certainly, more African American election voter 
participation. 
Lastly, Timaka’s office works, in concert, 
with the Humphreys County Board of Super-
visors and any other entities necessary to pro-
mote and provide better opportunities for eco-
nomic and social developments. 
In June 2007, Timaka was appointed by MS 
Supreme Court Chief Justice, the Honorable 
Jess Dickinson to the MS Access to Justice 
Commission. This commission formed to iden-
tify the current and future needs of the legal 
services communities, as well as developing a 
strategic statewide plan for the delivery of 
legal services to the poor in Mississippi. 
Timaka has committee memberships and af-
filiations of the following: 
Member of Mississippi Circuit Clerk’s As-
sociation; Mississippi Election Commission 
Association-Associate Member; Active Mem-
ber of Mississippi Legislative Action Com-
mittee of Circuit Clerks; Current Member of 
the Federal U.S. Election Assistance Com-
mission and Standards Board; Former Mem-

Belzoni, MS, who is also a retired Transpor-
tation Director HCSD. They have two daugh-
ters—Ms. Sylvia LaSarah, 8th Grade Science 
Teacher, at McNair Middle School, and Mrs. 
Gabriel Nicole Harrington, Sergeant United 
State Army; one son-n-law, TiQuay Har-
rington, Sergeant United States Army; and 
one Bouncy Grandbaby Girl, Miss Melonie 
Rose Harrington. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in recognizing Timaka James-Jones for 
her leadership, service, and dedication to 
Humphreys County and the State of Mis-
sissippi.

HONORING CORNERSTONE 
INDUCTEE JEROME DUNKLIN 
HON. CONNIE CONWAY 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, August 12, 2022 
Ms. CONWAY. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize Dr. Jerome (Jerry) Dunklin, 
M.D., for his induction into the Fresno City 
College Football Wall of Fame. 
A lifelong Fresnan and football fan, Dr. 
Dunklin was born and raised in Fresno, Cali-
fornia, where he graduated from San Joaquin 
Memorial High School and was a member of 
the 1974 Valley Champion football team. He 
attended Fresno City College and Santa Clara 
University before graduating from Creighton 
University in Omaha, Nebraska with a Bach-
elor of Science degree in Biology. 
Upon completing his undergraduate edu-
cation, Jerry attended medical school at 
Creighton University and graduated in 1985. 
After medical school, he continued his study of 
medicine as a transitional intern at the Michi-
gan State University Kalamazoo Center. Jerry 
was accepted into the orthopedic surgery resi-
dency program at the University of Missouri in 
Kansas City where he trained under the sur-
geon known for developing the modem tech-
nique for ACL reconstruction. While com-
pleting his residency, he also worked with the 
team physicians for the Kansas City Royals 
and the Kansas City Chiefs as well as on the 
faculty of the University of Missouri in Kansas 
City. He eventually made his way back to his 
home state of California and completed a fel-
lowship in sports medicine and ski trauma at 
the Tahoe Fracture and Orthopedic Medical 
Clinic. 
In 1992, Dr. Dunklin returned to his home-
town of Fresno and founded a solo practice in 
orthopedic surgery. In 2001, he became a

HONORING PHILIP BRYCE OF THE 
NEW HAMPSHIRE DIVISION OF 
PARKS AND RECREATION 
HON. CHRIS PAPPAS 
OF NEW HAMPSHIRE 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, August 12, 2022 
Mr. PAPPAS. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to honor Philip Bryce of the New Hampshire 
Division of Parks and Recreation who is retir-
ing after 25 years of service to the community. 
Prior to his most recent service as the Director 
of the Division of Parks and Recreation for the 
past 11 years, Philip served his community as 
the Director of the Division of Forest and 
Lands. 
Philip has dedicated his distinguished career 
to preserving our state’s public lands. His love 
of nature began when he spent summers with 
his grandparents in Ontario and continued to 
grow as he studied forestry at the University of 
Maine. During his tenure as Director of the Di-
vision of Parks and Recreation Philip man-
aged nearly 100 parks, including lakes, beach-
es, trails, and forests, and oversaw a $30 mil-
lion operating budget that is entirely self-fund-
ed. 
New Hampshire’s state parks provide Gran-
ite Staters with outstanding educational and 
inspirational experiences. They provide vital 
services in the conservation of our natural 
lands and are special places of cultural and 
natural significance. Philip’s leadership and 
dedication has been integral to the continued 
success of these parks. 
On behalf of my constituents in New Hamp-
shire’s First Congressional District, I want to 
thank Philip for his continued dedication to the 
Granite State. I congratulate him again on his 
incredible career and wish him the best in re-
tirement.

HONORING DR. JOHN M. PERKINS 
HON. BENNIE G. THOMPSON 
OF MISSISSIPPI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, August 12, 2022 
Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to honor a tenacious and 
innovative gentleman, Dr. John M. Perkins. 
Dr. John Perkins (91–June 16, 1930) has 
been married to his wife, Dr. Vera Mae, for 
over 71 years (1951). In 1983, while in Cali-
fornia, John and Vera Mae, along with his 
family and a few friends and other major sup-
porters, established the John M. Perkins 
Foundation for Reconciliation & Development 
(now called John and Vera Mae Perkins Foun-
dation) for the sole purpose of supporting their 
mission of advancing the principles of Chris-
tian community development (CCD) and Rec-
onciliation throughout the world. The Founda-
tion is now headed by his three daughters, 
Elizabeth, Priscilla and Deborah Perkins, who 
function as Co-Presidents. The Foundation is 
committed to spreading the wholistic Gospel of 
Jesus Christ. 
John M. Perkins was born in 1930, a share-
cropper’s son who grew up in New Hebron, 
Mississippi amidst dire poverty. His mother 
died of a malnutrition disease called Pellagra 
when John was only 7 months old. Fleeing to 
California at age 17 after his older brother’s 
murder at the hands of a town marshal, he 
vowed never to return. However after his con-
version to Christianity in 1957 and three-year 
discipleship, he and his young family returned 
to his home State of Mississippi in 1960 to 
share the Good News of God’s love. While in 
Mississippi, his outspoken nature, as well as 
his support and leadership in Civil Rights dem-
onstrations and voter registrations, resulted in 
repeated 
harassments, 
beatings 
and 
imprisonments. 
Drs. John and Vera Mae Perkins, with the 
support of friends, have founded many min-
istries, which focus on Christian community 
development, multi-ethnic church planting, 
health care, education, leadership develop-
ment, legal assistant, thrift stores, low-income 
housing development, and training centers.

group of Christian leaders from across Amer-
ica that was bonded by one significant com-
mitment—expressing the love of Christ in 
America’s poor communities, not at arm’s 
length, but at the grass-roots level. An asso-
ciation was formed and the Christian Commu-
nity Development Association (CCDA) held its 
first annual national conference in Chicago in

REMEMBERING THE LIFE OF MR. 
JAMES C. ALLGOOD, JR. 
HON. TRENT KELLY 
OF MISSISSIPPI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, August 12, 2022 
Mr. KELLY of Misissippi. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to honor the life of Mr. James C. 
Allgood, Jr. of Lafayette County. His family de-
scribes James as loving, caring, considerate, 
and loyal. He enjoyed fishing and tinkering in 
his shop, but his passion was cooking. 
Christmas was James favorite holiday. He 
spent countless hours planning and putting to-
gether a spectacular light show. Everyone 
from the community would drive out each year 
to watch the light show he designed, and to 
admire his talented, hard work. Above all 
things, his family and the Lafayette County 
community were most important to him. His 
legacy is absolute in all the lives he touched. 
James was the epitome of Lafayette County 
citizenship. He served his community faithfully, 
proudly, and confidently for over 30 years, 
most recently being the Emergency Manage-
ment Director for the city of Oxford. James’ 
guidance, counsel, and competence were re-
assuring in the wake of many crises, including 
the COVID Pandemic of 2020. James stated 
in April of 2020, ‘‘This is a team effort, and we 
will not win this as individuals but as a com-
munity that is not only a team but a family. We 
all pull together, or we all fall apart. The city, 
county, and university are all part of one big 
family, and working together as a team, we 
keep that family together and safe.’’ His ac-
tions during the pandemic resulted in him 
being named an ‘‘Oxford Hero’’ by the Ole 
Miss Pix. 
James is survived by his wife, Linda Musick 
Allgood, of Oxford; his daughter, Angie 
(Jesse) Crouse, of Oxford; his sisters, Patti 
Reedy, of Gore Springs, MS, Penny (Keith) 
Henley, of Banner, MS, and Pamela Barnett, 
of Sanford, FL; a host of nieces and nephews 
and great-nieces and nephews.

V–J DAY ANNIVERSARY 
HON. KEVIN HERN 
OF OKLAHOMA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, August 12, 2022 
Mr. HERN. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
commemorate the 77th anniversary of V–J 
Day on August 14, 2022. Without the sac-
rifices of our service members on that day, 
and on the horrific days of World War II lead-
ing up to it, we would not be a free people. 
Victory over Japan Day, V–J Day, marked 
the triumph of American forces and the end of 
the most consequential war in modern history. 
This day commemorates the signing of Ja-
pan’s surrender aboard the USS Missouri in 
Tokyo Bay in 1945. 
Our veteran community in Oklahoma es-
teems this day as all Americans should. Fewer 
and fewer members of the greatest generation 
are with us today, and those we have left are 
American treasures to admire. 
Frank Reisinger, a veteran himself, is one 
such treasure who has coordinated the re-
membrance of this historic moment in Broken 
Arrow for many years. Frank still remembers 
celebrating the initial V–J Day in downtown 
Tulsa with his father 77 years ago as an 18- 
year-old young man. This memory is forever 
seared into Frank’s mind and the inspiration of 
that glorious moment has lasted him a lifetime. 
Now he inspires countless others to revere our 
great American flag and the freedoms it rep-
resents. 
I am thankful for this event and the work of 
Frank Reisinger, and the city of Broken Arrow 
to honor this day.

RECOGNITION 
OF 
THE 
50TH 
WEDDING 
ANNIVERSARY 
OF 
GREG AND CHERYL POTTS 
HON. MIKE ROGERS 
OF ALABAMA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, August 12, 2022 
Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to recognize the 50th wedding an-
niversary of Greg and Cheryl Potts. 
Miss Cheryl Lee Kriner and 2LT Gregory F. 
Potts were married on August 2, 1972, at 
Central United Methodist Church in Richmond, 
Indiana. 
The honeymoon was spent en route to Ab-
erdeen Proving Ground, Maryland, where 2LT 
Potts reported for active duty in the U.S. Army 
Ordnance Corps 3 days later. 
After more than 28 years of U.S. Army ac-
tive military service for Greg and over 20 
years of DoD civilian service for Cheryl, they 
decided in the autumn of 2000 to settle in re-
tirement in Alabama, in great part because of 
the warm welcome and exceptional hospitality 
they experienced during their 2-year assign-
ment at Anniston Army Depot in the late 
1990s. 
Retirement has been anything but quiet for 
them as Cheryl continues to be very active in 
her church, Jacksonville First United Meth-
odist, and on the Advisory Board for OPAC 
(Oxford Performing Arts Center) after having 
served in various capacities in other commu-
nity organizations. Greg is also active in the 
same church and serves as Chairman of the 
Farley L. Berman Foundation after also being 
active on several other local entities. 
After retiring from BAE Systems in 2008, 
Greg and Cheryl decided to create GFP Con-
sulting, a niche business development advi-
sory and consulting firm focused on assisting 
small and other businesses in the national se-
curity space. They are proud to be entering 
GFP Consulting’s 15th year of continuous op-
eration. 
Cheryl and Greg consider themselves richly 
blessed to be part of the life and fabric of East 
Central Alabama. 
Madam Speaker, please join me in recog-
nizing my friends, Greg and Cheryl, and wish-
ing them a happy 50th anniversary.

HONORING HENRY HUERTA 
HON. LINDA T. SA´NCHEZ 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, August 12, 2022 
Ms. SA´ NCHEZ. Madam Speaker, it is with a 
heavy heart that I rise to honor the life of the 
late Henry Perez Huerta. Henry was one of 
the most important voices in the labor move-
ment in California. He led an incredible life 
protecting the rights of working families in 
Southern and Northern California and inspired 
other leaders to follow in his footsteps. 
Henry was a child of the farm worker move-
ment. At 16, Henry watched his father orga-
nize a massive rally in Gonzales, California 
where Cesar Chavez spoke to farmworkers. 
From that moment, Henry was inspired to live 
a life where he fought for workers. Outraged 
by the disenfranchisement of farmworker fami-
lies like his own, Henry became the youngest 
deputy registrar in the state of California. He 
registered countless farm workers to vote and 
make their voices heard. 
After graduating from the University of Or-
egon, where Henry was one of the very few 
Mexican-Americans on campus, he worked for 
the State of California’s Department of Indus-
trial Relations for 31 years. His work was so 
impactful to so many—often acting as a one- 
person investigation team for the Labor Com-
mission. Thinking of his own family’s experi-
ence, Henry felt a deep sense of fulfillment 
helping farm workers receive wages they were 
unfairly denied. 
While working in San Francisco, Henry 
quickly ascended to Senior Deputy Labor 
Commissioner, investigating the workplace 
conditions of sweat shops, agricultural compa-
nies, car washes and construction sites. Henry 
always understood the importance of empow-
ering workers, which led him to lead the 
charge in unionizing carwash workers in LA. 
Henry and his wife, Martha, eventually set-
tled down in Whittier, California, but Henry’s 
passion for political change and empowering 
working families never faded. 
In his final months of life, Henry continued 
to register voters, and volunteer countless 
hours to get out the vote. As a result of his 
tireless activism, Henry was honored by the 
Los Angeles County Democratic Party as 
‘‘Democrat of the Year.’’ 
Henry was such a great activist not just be-
cause of the time he spent on work, but also 
the time he invested in mentorship, friendship, 
and guidance to local leaders. I am proud to 
have called Henry a friend and a role model. 
Henry Huerta left us too soon. His absence 
is greatly felt by my community, but his legacy 
as a voice for the disenfranchised will be re-
membered for generations. I join Henry’s wife, 
Martha, his 2 children, Enrique Jr., and 
Zenaida, and all his family and friends in cele-
brating the difference he made in our commu-
nity through a full and meaningful life.

RECOGNIZING LIEUTENANT 
GENERAL STEVE GILLAND 
HON. CHERI BUSTOS 
OF ILLINOIS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, August 12, 2022 
Mrs. BUSTOS. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to recognize Lieutenant General Steve Gilland 
on having taken command as the 61st Super-
intendent in the history of the U.S. Military 
Academy in West Point, New York. 
Born in Rock Island and a graduate of 
Sherrard High School, LT GEN Gilland earned 
a Bachelor of Science degree from the U.S. 
Military Academy and later, a Master’s degree 
in military operational art and science from the 
Air Force’s Air Command and Staff College. 
He was commissioned from West Point in 
1990, which marked the official start of his 
service in the U.S. Army. Since then, LT GEN 
Gilland has deployed numerous times and 
supported multiple operations across the Mid-
dle East and Northern Africa. Most recently, 
he was the Deputy Commander of III Corps at 
Fort Hood in Texas from July 2021, until June 
2022. LT GEN Gilland has received many 
awards and decorations throughout his service 
including the Army Distinguished Service 
Medal, Defense Superior Service Medal, Le-
gion of Merit, Defense Meritorious Service 
Medal, Army Commendation Medal with V De-
vice, Bronze Star Medal, Meritorious Service 
Medal, Military Free Fall Jumpmaster Badge, 
and the Combat Infantryman’s Badge. He was 
confirmed for promotion to Lieutenant General 
in June 2022. On June 27, 2022, he assumed 
his duties as Superintendent of the U.S. Mili-
tary Academy. LT GEN Steve Gilland is a 
hero and will perform admirably in his new ca-
pacity. 
It is because of honorable and dedicated 
leaders such as LT GEN Steve Gilland of the 
U.S. Military Academy that I am especially 
proud to serve Illinois’ 17th Congressional Dis-
trict. Madam Speaker, I would like to, again, 
formally congratulate him as the newest Su-
perintendent of the U.S. Military Academy.

HONORING MR. EARL TILLMAN 
HON. BARRY LOUDERMILK 
OF GEORGIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, August 12, 2022 
Mr. LOUDERMILK. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor my dear friend Mr. Earl Till-
man, an accomplished business and commu-
nity leader, civilian flight instructor, and long- 
time member of the Georgia Wing of the Civil 
Air Patrol. 
Mr. Tillman has been an icon of the Rome 
and Floyd County community for decades. As 
an avid aviation enthusiast, he has operated 
the Tillman Aviation University at Richard. B 
Russell Regional Airport in Rome for over 
twenty-five years and has made countless 
contributions to the operations and advance-
ment of the airport. As a long-time member of 
the Civil Air Patrol myself, as well as being a 
fellow aviator, I can personally attest to Mr. 
Tillman’s unwavering dedication to the airport 
and the entire community. 
Hailing from Pierce County, Georgia, Earl 
graduated from Mt. Berry School for the Boys 
in 1952. He later attended Jacksonville Univer-
sity and the University of Florida. After college, 
Earl proudly served our nation in the United 
States Army. Mr. Tillman then returned to the 
private sector where he took a position at 
State Mutual Insurance, until 1999, when he 
returned to his alma-mater, Mt. Berry School, 
to serve as Special Assistant to the President. 
Outside of his professional careers, Mr. Till-
man’s passion has been to share his knowl-
edge of aviation, especially to the youth of the 
community. When my family served as volun-
teers in the Civil Air Patrol, Mr. Tillman gave 
my daughter her first official flight lesson. 
Throughout the years, Mr. Tillman has used 
his passion, knowledge, and experience in 
aviation to serve others. As an influential 
member of the Civil Air Patrol for more than 
fifty years, he conducted numerous aerial 
search-and-rescue missions, as well as teach-
ing aviation and leadership skills to young ca-
dets and adult volunteers. He also worked 
with local Boy Scout Troops to help young 
men earn their aviation merit badges and in-
spire them to serve their communities. 
The impact Mr. Tillman has had on this 
community is immeasurable, from the number 
of people he helped to pursue careers in avia-
tion, to his service as a Deacon at the First 
Baptist Church, he has touched, encouraged, 
and inspired so many. 
His selfless dedication and commitment to 
Rome, Floyd County, and the state of Geor-
gia, have made our community and state bet-
ter and stronger. I am happy to call him a 
friend; and, on behalf of all Georgians, and my 
colleagues in the U.S. House of Representa-
tives, I am honored to acknowledge and thank 
him for his lifetime of service.

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, August 12, 2022 
Mr. CLYBURN. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to pay tribute to a dedicated public serv-
ant, highly respected educator and a longtime 
personal friend. Recently retired Orangeburg 
County Councilman Willie B. Owens, Sr.

South Carolina State College. He went on to 
earn his E.D. from the Citadel and did further 
study at Clemson University and the University 
of South Carolina. 
I knew Willie B. from our days together on 
the campus of South Carolina State where we 
both were active as students in campus activi-
ties and civil rights protests in Orangeburg 
County. He continued his activism throughout 
his life participating in voter registration drives 
and taking people to the polls to vote. He was 
also a Life Member of the NAACP, and always 
stood up against injustices. 
Willie B. spent his professional career work-
ing in education. He began in the public

Richard Carroll High School and Bamberg- 
Ehrhardt High School. He served as Bamberg- 
Ehrhardt High School’s Director of Transpor-

munity Center, which was dedicated just 2- 
days before he retired from Council. 
Willie B. was very active in the community. 
He was a member of the South Carolina As-
sociation for Community Developers, the Na-
tional Association of Student Affairs Profes-
sionals, the South Carolina Task Force for the 
Study of School Incentive Programs, the 
South Carolina Department of Education Ad-
vance Placement Advisory Committee, and 
served as an Orangeburg Calhoun Technical 
College Area Commissioner. Other leadership 
positions included President of South Carolina 
AA Athletic Association, Chairman of the Re-
gional Medical Center Board of Trustees, and 
Chairman of Orangeburg County Peoples As-
sault on Drugs. He was also a member of 
Omega Psi Phi Fraternity. 
His outstanding contributions were recog-
nized by numerous awards including the Mar-
tin Luther King Jr. Distinguished Service 
Award, the Outstanding Achievement Award in 
Education, the Excellence in Education Award, 
the Outstanding Service Award from Bamberg 
Job Corps, the Omega Man of the Year, the 
South Carolina Future Farmers of America 
Honorary Degree, the Outstanding Young Ed-
ucator Award, the South Carolina Vocational 
Agriculture Teachers Association Outstanding

Branchville, South Carolina at an early age. 
He was married to Arminta Owens for 59 
years. They have three sons, Willie B. Owens, 
Jr., Derrick Owens, and Greg Nell and two 
granddaughters. 
Madam Speaker, I ask that you and our col-
leagues join me in celebrating the life and leg-
acy of Willie B. Owens, Sr. He spent his entire 
adult life serving Orangeburg County, South 
Carolina, and his contributions made a dif-
ference in countless lives. Many future gen-
erations will benefit from the leadership of 
Willie B., and that is a great testament to a life 
well lived. 
REMEMBERING THE LIFE OF MR. 
JAMES PAUL MASON 
HON. TRENT KELLY 
OF MISSISSIPPI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, August 12, 2022 
Mr. KELLY of Mississippi. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to honor the life of Mr. James Paul 
Mason. Mr. Mason was a life-long resident of 
Neshoba County, Mississippi. His parents, 
Mrs. Mary Ethel Graham Mason, and Mr. 
James (Jim) Presley Mason, both advanced 
education in their home county; his mother as 
a teacher, and his father as a member of the 
school board. 
James Paul was a star athlete at Neshoba 
Central High School and was recruited to play 
football at the University of Mississippi (Ole 
Miss) by the legendary John Howard Vaught. 
Upon graduating from Ole Miss, Mr. Mason 
returned to his high school alma mater as an 
assistant football coach for 5 years, then em-
barked upon a distinguished career with the 
U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Farm Service 
Agency. 
Mr. Mason is recognized for his long service 
to his county, state, and Nation as executive 
director of the USDA’s Farm Service Agency 
for Neshoba and Kemper counties until his re-
tirement in December 2018. His service was 
exemplary. 
Outside his role with the USDA, Mr. Mason 
was a dedicated husband to his wife of 49 
years, Judy Clark Mason, and a loving father 
to his 2 daughters, Yancey and Corby. 
James Paul was a proud member of the Ole 
Miss ‘‘M Club,’’ a club for athletic letter win-
ners at the University of Mississippi. He was 
a loyal supporter of the University, attending 
an untold number of sporting events as a sea-
son ticket holder for football, basketball, and 
baseball. There was not a bigger Rebel fan. 
James Paul was generous to his friends. He 
also had a ‘‘Never-met-a-stranger’’ personality 
which endeared him to those who met him. He 
was loved and admired by a multitude of fam-
ily, friends, and colleagues. Mr. James Paul 
Mason will always be remembered as a hus-
band, father, and friend. There was none finer. 
On behalf of a grateful Nation, we commend 
and thank Mr. James Paul Mason for his dec-
ades of service to his country.

CELEBRATING 
THE 
150TH 
ANNI-
VERSARY OF REGIONS HOSPITAL 
HON. BETTY McCOLLUM 
OF MINNESOTA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, August 12, 2022 
Ms. MCCOLLUM. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor Regions Hospital in Saint Paul, 
Minnesota on the momentous occasion of its 
150th anniversary of service to the East Metro 
area. The dedication of the entire staff— 
nurses, doctors, technicians, support staff, ad-
ministration and more—has made Regions a 
pillar of quality and innovative care in Min-
nesota. 
Established as ‘‘City and County Hospital’’ 
in 1872 by the Ramsey County Board of Com-
missioners, the hospital’s history began in a 
stone mansion with only two doctors in Saint 
Paul’s West Seventh neighborhood. In 1965, it 
moved to its current location in downtown 
Saint Paul, and twenty years later it was re-
named Regions Hospital. 
Throughout its 150 years, Regions has 
come to play a unique and life-saving role in 
our community as the East Metro safety net 
hospital and the only Level 1 Trauma Center. 
There are more than 26,000 hospital admis-
sions per year, and more than 13,000 cases 
at the Surgery Center. Regions focuses on 
leading-edge treatments and ongoing research 
to continue to provide the best innovative care 
for their patients. The hospital is nationally 
recognized for many programs including the 
Approved Emergency Residency Program that 
is educating the next generation of emergency 
medicine physicians, the Cancer Research 
Center, which leads the way in equitable clin-
ical trials and seeks to reduce barriers to clin-
ical research opportunities to better serve the 
diverse Twin Cities community, and the Bum 
Center where patients receive the highest 
level of specialized care and the physical and 
emotional support needed to heal. And in 
2020, the Regions Hospital Family Birth Cen-
ter opened as a 160,000 square foot, state-of- 
the-art facility for labor and delivery. 
Regions is a hospital that consistently 
shows up for communities in need. One exam-
ple of this is the Lee and Penny Anderson 
HeroCare Program which honors military fami-
lies by providing medical services for veterans, 
members of the military and their families, 
connecting them to mental health services and 
medical resources specific to their needs. Dur-
ing the COVID–19 pandemic, Regions an-
swered the call to serve by researching pos-
sible treatment options to offer hope and im-
prove patient care. 
Madam Speaker, please join me in paying 
tribute to the incredible health care profes-
sionals and support staff of Regions Hospital 
as they celebrate 150 years of quality care, 
and as they continue to work to fulfill their mis-
sion of improving health and well-being in 
partnership with their patients and the commu-
nity.

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, August 12, 2022 
Mr. HIGGINS of New York. Madam Speak-
er, I rise today to pay tribute to Thomas 
‘‘Tom’’ Smith. a committed public servant, de-
voted husband and father, and a trusted friend 
and advisor to so many in government and 
politics in his hometown of Buffalo, NY, who

A key advisor in the administration of Buf-
falo Mayor Byron Brown, Tom was known 
widely for his keen insight, his commitment to 
public service, his loyalty, and his kindness 
and decency. Through his long and distin-
guished career, Tom developed a deep and 
impressive understanding of all facets of mu-
nicipal administration which he employed to 
benefit of all of the residents of the city of Buf-
falo. He will be dearly missed. 
Tom Smith is survived by his beloved wife 
of 12 years, Jessica Maglietto Smith, his sons 
Jack and Drew, his parents Dennis and Shir-
ley Smith; and his brothers Dennis and Doug.

We join them in mourning this terrible loss, 
and recalling his loyalty, his kindness and his 
fundamental goodness. 
I count myself lucky, as so many do, to 
have known Tom and to have benefited from 
his expertise and sound judgement. Through 
sharing his gifts of time and talent, he made 
his city a better place, and untold future gen-
erations will be the beneficiaries of his efforts. 
Tom’s good work touched every corner of his 
native City. 
Madam Speaker, Tom Smith was a great 
man; he was an exemplary father, husband, 
son and brother to his family, and a loyal 
friend to so many and talented and dedicated 
public 
servant 
for 
the 
benefit 
of 
all 
Buffalonians. Those of us who were privileged 
to have known him are better for it.

HONORING MR. JUSTIN FURROW 
HON. CHARLES J. ‘‘CHUCK’’ 
FLEISCHMANN 
OF TENNESSEE 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, August 12, 2022 
Mr. FLEISCHMANN. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to congratulate Justin Furrow on his 
years of service to the Chattanooga Area 
Chamber of Commerce. 
For the past five years Justin has served as 
chair of the Chamber’s public policy committee 
during a time of unprecedented transition. He 
helped stand up a new department within the 
organization, oversaw staff changes, and 
worked tirelessly to help guide the Chamber 
as it worked to improve the environment for 
the business community in Chattanooga and 
Hamilton County. He was also chair of the 
committee when the Chattanooga Area Cham-
ber of Commerce was named the ACCE Na-
tional Chamber of the Year in 2017. 
He has balanced his volunteer time with a 
full-time law practice, chairing the labor and 
employment 
law 
section 
at 
Chambliss, 
Bahner, & Stophel law firm in Chattanooga. A 
native of the area, he is a graduate of the Uni-
versity of Tennessee in Chattanooga and got 
his law degree at the University of Tennessee 
in Knoxville. 
Justin’s service to the Chattanooga area is 
commendable and I am privileged to recog-
nize his years of distinguished service. I look 
forward to seeing him continue to serve bis 
community in the years to come.

HONORING THE 100TH 
ANNIVERSARY OF LINCOLN 
HON. DEBBIE DINGELL 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, August 12, 2022 
Mrs. DINGELL. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize Ford Motor Company’s lux-
ury vehicle division Lincoln on the occasion of 
their 100th Anniversary. Their century of suc-
cess is worthy of commendation. 
In 1922, Henry Ford’s son Edsel Ford 
bought 
the 
Lincoln 
Motor 
Company 
headquartered in Dearborn, Michigan, with the 
goal of manufacturing luxury cars. Throughout 
the years, the Lincoln Motor Company has 
grown to become one of the top luxury vehicle 
brands. Lincoln’s cars are nationally recog-
nized for their elegance and have been the 
car of choice for many prominent figures such 
as President Calvin Coolidge and several 
other United States Presidents. The first to 
debut features such as center-opening coach 
doors, electric gauges, keyless entry, and 
symphonic chimes, Lincoln’s new innovations 
have made a significant impact on the auto-
motive industry. 
To celebrate their 100 years of success, 
Lincoln is launching a year-long collection of 
events worldwide. As part of their celebration, 
Lincoln’s cars will also be featured at the 71st 
Pebble Beach Concours d’ Elegance in Cali-
fornia, where the brand’s iconic designs dating 
back to 1922 will be put on public display, and 
they will unveil their vision for their second 
century of operation. Looking ahead to a 
cleaner future, Lincoln is also reimagining their 
brand in the 21st century by shifting their 
focus toward vehicle electrification and service 
connections. By 2030, Lincoln plans to have a 
fully electric global portfolio supported by their 
new zero-emission Lincoln Star Concept. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in honoring Lincoln as they celebrate 100 
years of excellence. We are grateful for their 
decades of service to our community, and 
wish Lincoln continued success in the years 
ahead.

HONORING THE PUBLIC SERVICE 
OF MAYOR JIM DURRETT 
HON. MARK E. GREEN 
OF TENNESSEE 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, August 12, 2022 
Mr. GREEN of Tennessee. Madam Speak-
er, I rise today to recognize Mayor Jim Durrett 
for his distinguished career in service to the 
people of Montgomery County, Tennessee. 
Mayor Durrett is truly a man of Montgomery 
County. It is there that he was born and 
raised, there that he and his wife raised their 
3 children, there that he attends church, and 
there that he lives today. Both of his parents 
were public servants in the County; his father 
served 26 years on the Clarksville City Council 
and his mother worked the election polls for 
as long as he could remember. Public service 
is in his blood. 
He began his career early in life, shoveling 
asphalt for the City of Clarksville while attend-
ing Clarksville High School. He attended Aus-
tin Peay State University in Montgomery 
County, and upon graduation, he started work 
full-time for the City of Clarksville. He served 
as the Director of Streets for 20 years, later 
becoming Chief of Staff for the City. 
Mayor Durrett was elected by the people of 
Montgomery County in August 2014, though it 
was not an easy first term. Within months of 
his election, Hemlock Semiconductor an-
nounced they were pulling out their $1.2 billion 
facility—a sharp blow to the community. Within 
one year of this notice, however, and after 
much hard work by Mayor Durrett and his 
team, Google announced their plans to move 
to Montgomery County. Since then, LG, 
Shinhung, and Pantos have all joined Google. 
His tenure as Mayor has undoubtedly im-
proved the lives of Montgomery County resi-
dents. From projects such as the Downtown 
Commons, a public field in the middle of 
downtown Clarksville, to the ongoing F&M 
Bank Arena, Mayor Durrett’s vision for the 
County is coming alive. From just 2019 to 
today, Mayor Durrett’s efforts have added or 
announced 6,700 new jobs in the County, 
amounting to $2 billion in capital investment. 
As a veteran myself, I am especially grateful 
for Mayor Durrett’s leadership in support of 
our servicemembers. Montgomery County has 
a large population of servicemembers and vet-
erans, due to the location of Fort Campbell. 
Under his leadership, the County was 1 of 
only 7 communities worldwide to be recog-
nized with an Army Community Partnership 
Award. 
Mayor Durrett embodies what it means to 
be a servant-leader in one’s community. 
Through over 31 years of public service, and 
8 years as County Mayor, Jim Durrett’s career 
is an example to us all. It is fitting that we 
honor him as he concludes a long and effec-
tive career. On behalf of the United States 
Congress, I congratulate Mayor Durrett on the 
occasion of his retirement and thank him for 
his service to the people of Montgomery 
County.

HONORING MEGAN PALMER 
HON. ELISSA SLOTKIN 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, August 12, 2022 
Ms. SLOTKIN. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to honor the memory of Megan Palmer, a 
young woman whose life, though cut tragically 
short, was rich, full, and committed to building 
stronger, healthier communities. 
Megan was the substance abuse prevention 
coordinator with the Livingston County Com-
munity Alliance, a county-wide anti-drug coali-
tion dedicated to establishing and promoting 
healthy community norms concerning the use 
of alcohol, drugs, and tobacco. She passed 
away at age 40 on January 8, 2022, one 
month after being diagnosed with an aggres-
sive form of cancer. While the grief is still raw, 
it’s her life and the work that continues, fueled 
by her memory and her spirit, that we cele-
brate today. 
Social work is defined as providing services 
to individuals, groups, and communities by 
helping people address the problems they 
face in their everyday lives. This was Megan’s 
chosen profession, but it was also clearly her 
vocation. From her college years at Western 
Michigan University, where she volunteered to 
build homes for low-income families, worked 
to further her church’s mission, and to support 
social justice causes, to her graduate studies 
at the University of Michigan, where she took 
an internship working to end food insecurity, 
Megan was a social worker before she was a 
social worker. 
While she held different positions in her ca-
reer, the goal was always the same, as 
Megan recognized the inherent value of every 
individual and sought to provide supportive 
services to help them be their best self. She 
helped get locally sourced produce on the 
menu for a juvenile rehabilitation center, coun-
seled teenagers facing homelessness, and de-
voted the final decade of her life to youth sub-
stance abuse prevention. 
Rooted in advocacy, constantly committed 
to staring injustice in the face, Megan was

both optimistic and realistic, believing she 
could make the world around her better, while 
also meeting people exactly where they were. 
She brought enthusiasm, humor, and more 
than a touch of sarcasm to every task, every 
meeting, and every project she touched. She 
was beloved by her coworkers, her friends, 
and her family, and she will never be forgot-
ten. 
I offer my condolences to all those who 
mourn her loss, and on behalf of a grateful 
community, it is my honor to recognize her 
story in the People’s House. Let it be known 
to all that Megan Palmer was a social worker 
who made a difference.

HONORING CADEN D. NELSON 
HON. BENNIE G. THOMPSON 
OF MISSISSIPPI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, August 12, 2022 
Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to honor a tenacious and 
exceptional student, Caden D. Nelson. 
Caden Nelson was born July 10, 2006, in 
Greenville, Mississippi. He is currently in the 
11th grade at O’Bannon High School. He is 
among a family of 10 siblings, but grew up in 
a household of 4—his sister, Haley; his dad, 
David; his mom, Alicia; and himself. His mom 
is an educator, as she has been an educator 
for 20 years. His dad is a veteran, who has 
served in the military for over 20 years, and 
he is the pastor at Bethlehem MB Church. 
Haley is a student in middle school. 
Growing up, Caden had to realize a lot of 
things, one was being born with a condition 
called albinism, which is a lack of pigment in 
the skin that can also affect the eyesight. 
Growing up wasn’t easy. He couldn’t see all 
that well and he struggled in many subjects 
because of his lack of vision. Caden was 
blessed to have amazing people in his life to 
sacrifice their time and assist him. 
With the help of teachers and family, he 
was able to accomplish many things like pass-
ing the 3rd grade reading gate, along with 
having the highest scores in his class. This 
memory stands out and made Caden happy 
because growing up he was insecure, with no 
confidence in himself. 
Once in high school, Caden started to grow 
and became more sociable. He gives credit to 
God for having a chance to be introduced to 
many opportunities in his community. He 
joined the Mayor’s Youth Council in Green-
ville, MS. He made many friends and got to 
see how the community really works. ‘‘How 
amazingly warm, it felt to be a part of a com-
munity like this one,’’ said Caden. He got a 
chance to go to Mississippi State University 
this summer to learn about physics. Also, he 
recently got the position as Lieutenant Gov-
ernor for Mississippi Youth Council. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in recognizing Caden Nelson for his pas-
sion, dedication for success, and desire to 
make a difference in the community. 
RECOGNITION OF PAMELA KLYN 
HON. FRED UPTON 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, August 12, 2022 
Mr. UPTON. Madam Speaker, I rise today in 
recognition of Pamela Klyn upon her receipt of 
the Good Scout Award. Pamela Klyn has dedi-
cated her life to bettering Southwest Michigan 
through her work with the Whirlpool Corpora-
tion. A graduate of Michigan Technological 
University, Pam came to Benton Harbor in 
1993 with a sharp mind and has brought the 
corporation to new heights locally as well as 
internationally. 
In addition to her incredible work ethic, Pam 
is also an accomplished scholar. She com-
pleted her master’s degree in mechanical en-
gineering from the University of Michigan in 
1995. She also achieved an Executive MBA 
from Bowling Green State University. At the 
start of this year, Pam was named Senior Vice 
President of Corporate Relations and Sustain-
ability for Whirlpool Corporation. 
Pam was raised by an Eagle Scout. Her fa-
ther taught her to ‘‘always be prepared’’ and to 
‘‘leave things better than you found them.’’ It’s 
clear that she has reflected these lessons in 
everything she does. In addition to heading 
corporate relations and sustainability for Whirl-
pool Corporation, Pam is also an active Board 
member of the Boys & Girls Club of Benton 
Harbor and a Trustee for the Whirlpool Foun-
dation. Pam also serves on the External Advi-
sory Board for the Dean of Engineering at her 
alma mater, Michigan Tech, and as a board 
member for the American Association of 
Home Appliances and the Board of Directors 
for Patrick Industries. 
Congratulations to Pam. There truly is no 
one more fitting to receive the honor of the 
Good Scout Award.

RECOGNIZING NATIONAL HOTEL 
EMPLOYEE DAY 
HON. RALPH NORMAN 
OF SOUTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, August 12, 2022 
Mr. NORMAN. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to recognize the outstanding work of hotel em-
ployees and the contributions of these hard- 
working men and women who provide critical 
service, welcoming guests at hotels across the 
country, and ensuring that travel is possible. I 
express my support for the designation of 
September 1, 2022, as National Hotel Em-
ployee Day. 
It is true that hotel workers are a vital part 
of the American economy; they are crucial to 
enabling travel ranging from family vacations 
to business meetings. 
Hotel workers also served as frontline work-
ers during the COVID–19 pandemic, ensuring 
other first responders and healthcare workers 
had a clean and comfortable place to stay 
while performing their duties. More impor-
tantly, nearly two million hotel workers across 
the country are driving the hotel industry’s re-
covery and helping to rebuild their commu-
nities from the COVID–19 pandemic. 
The hotel industry and the AHLA Founda-
tion provide opportunities for training and ad-
vancement for hotel workers across the indus-
try. 
I concur that September 1, 2022 would be 
an appropriate date to designate as National 
Hotel Employee Day for all the reasons above, 
and more.

HONORING THE LATE WILLIAM 
‘‘BILL’’ VICHKO 
HON. ANDY KIM 
OF NEW JERSEY 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, August 12, 2022 
Mr. KIM of New Jersey. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to honor the late William ‘‘Bill’’ 
Vichko, a beloved member of our community 
who passed away on June 29, 2022. He is 
survived by Katie, his wife of 48 years, his 
children Kara and Timothy, and his grand-
children Zoey and Edward. He also leaves be-
hind his siblings Bob, Bev, Kathy, and Jay. 
A resident of Burlington County for most of 
his life, Bill was born in Riverside, NJ and 
graduated from Burlington High School and 
Burlington County College. He built a wonder-
ful life for his family from the first moment he 
bought a house with his wife until his passing. 
Bill cherished every moment with his family 
and treasured his weekend trips taking the 
kids fishing and coaching their little league 
baseball teams. 
For years, Bill worked as an expeditor for 
Stone and Webster Engineering, United Engi-
neers, and Shaw Group. Bill was the epitome 
of what it meant to be a hard worker and was 
able to see the country through work travel 
throughout his illustrious career. Beyond his 
work, Bill was devoted to serving our commu-
nity, fellow servicemembers, and veterans. He 
served in the U.S. Navy during the Vietnam 
War and was a lifelong Veterans of Foreign 
Wars (VFW) member at Scully Bozarth Post 
1817, where he spent time as a Trustee. Even 
beyond his service, for 47 years Bill was 
known for wearing a silver bracelet with Colo-
nel Roy A. Knight Jr’s name on it after pur-
chasing 
it 
from 
a 
fundraiser 
for 
servicemembers who were declared prisoners 
of war or missing in action. Bill was as com-
mitted to his fellow Vietnam veterans as any-
one and sought out opportunities to honor 
their memory and service in any way possible. 
After his honorable discharge, Bill volun-
teered as a docent on the USS Battleship 
New Jersey in Camden for nine years, where 
he could be found greeting visitors in the Cap-
tain’s Cabin. He would often take extra time to 
speak with fellow veterans who served on the 
ship and brightened the days of their children 
and grandchildren. It was evident that his care 
for his family, his job, and his country were 
sources of great pride and passion to all who 
knew him. 
Bill was a kind soul who inspired kindness 
and service in those he touched. We were 
lucky to live with Bill as part of our community. 
My heart goes out to Bill’s entire family and for 
those that knew him, even for the most fleet-
ing moments; he will be missed.

HONORING PHYLLIS METCALFE 
HON. JARED HUFFMAN 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, August 12, 2022 
Mr. HUFFMAN. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor Phyllis Metcalfe in celebration 
of her extraordinary life and commitment to 
serving her community. 
Phyllis Metcalfe was born and grew up in 
New York State. She obtained a degree in ar-
chitectural design at the Pratt Institute in New 
York City. In 1967, Phyllis moved to Marin 
County and began her decades of service and 
political activism in her local community while 
raising her three children, Keith, Ryan, and 
Kathy. In addition to her work as a political 
consultant, Phyllis also served as an elected 
official on the College of Marin Board of Trust-
ees from 1979 to 2003 and was a member of 
the Corte Madera Planning Commission from 
2012 until the time of her death. 
Always an active political advocate, Phyllis 
was deeply involved in local and state elec-
tions and grassroots efforts to promote de-
mocracy and election campaign reform. She 
was also involved in a number of local organi-
zations that aimed to improve the welfare of 
women and local communities including the 
Marin Coalition, Marin Forum, National Wom-
en’s Political Caucus, Marin Center for Inde-
pendent Living, Exodus Residential Treatment 
for Autism, Marin County Chamber of Com-
merce, American Red Cross, United Way of 
the Bay Area and the Golden Gate Theo-
logical Seminary. 
Madam Speaker, there is no doubt that

CONGRATULATING 
CANDICE 
DIDUCH 
FOR 
WINNING 
A 
NA-
TIONAL WRESTLING TITLE 
HON. CHERI BUSTOS 
OF ILLINOIS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, August 12, 2022 
Mrs. BUSTOS. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to recognize Candice Diduch for winning a na-
tional wrestling title. 
Candice Diduch was one of 15 qualifiers 
from Illinois with the opportunity to compete at 
the national tournament to become a national 
champion in girls wrestling. Candice went 10– 
1 at a 10-day national tournament in Fargo, 
North Dakota, making her one of the top fe-
male wrestlers in the nation. With her excep-
tional athleticism, Candice Diduch is one of 
three girls’ IHSA state champions from the 
Freeport area that qualified for nationals, 
along with 11 boys from the region. Candice 
is known for being competitive and has made 
a name for herself in two sports. She started 
on Freeport’s girls’ soccer team in her first 
year, helping the Pretzels win NIC–10 and Re-
gional Championships. Now she is the 16U 
U.S. Nationals women’s freestyle champion. 
As a former athlete, I applaud Candice for her 
accomplishments and skills in athletics. I com-
mend her talent and dedication to her sport 
and I am proud to see her achieve such an 
esteemed title. 
Madam Speaker, I am proud to congratulate 
Candice Diduch for winning a national title for 
women’s wrestling. I am proud to serve Illinois’ 
17th Congressional District and incredibly 
pleased to recognize the hard work of hard- 
working athletes like Candice.

CELEBRATING JANE CLARK ON 
HER YEARS OF SERVICE 
HON. BILL HUIZENGA 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, August 12, 2022 
Mr. HUIZENGA. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize and congratulate Jane 
Clark on her exemplary career and decades of 
service to the West Michigan community. It is 
an honor to express my gratitude to Ms. Clark 
for her dedication, commitment, and hard work 
towards advancing West Michigan. 
In 1990, Ms. Clark began her West Michi-
gan business career with the Holland Area 
Chamber of Commerce, before guiding its 
merger into the Michigan West Coast Cham-
ber. Throughout her career, she has filled the 
critical roles of Membership Director, Vice 
President, and President of the organization. 
She has worked hard to shape the Chamber 
of Commerce into a pillar of the community. 
Under her leadership, the Chamber was 
named the Outstanding Chamber of the Year 
for Michigan in 2018 and, in multiple years, 
the Chamber received a 5-star accreditation 
from the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. 
On top of her many years at the Chamber 
of Commerce, Ms. Clark has also devoted her 
time to serving on the boards of several cher-
ished West Michigan institutions, including the 
Holland Museum, Holland Hospital, and the 
Tulip Time Festival. Recently, her efforts were 
highlighted by the Grand Rapids Business 
Journal, who named her as one of the most 
influential women in West Michigan. 
Throughout her career, Ms. Clark has 
strived to help guide, mentor, and develop the 
1,250 West Michigan businesses that she rep-
resents. 
Madam Speaker, please join me in thanking 
Jane Clark for her years of dedicated service 
to the West Michigan community. Her strong 
leadership has helped propel the West Michi-
gan business community to where it is today.

RECOGNIZING MR. ALVIN L. ALCE 
FOR 
RECEIVING 
THE 
PURPLE 
HEART 
HON. CARLOS A. GIMENEZ 
OF FLORIDA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, August 12, 2022 
Mr. GIMENEZ. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to honor Mr. Alvin L. Alce, SPC5, a native of 
Key West and an Army Veteran who served in 
Vietnam. On August 8, 2022, Mr. Alce was 
formally presented with the Purple Heart—the 
oldest military medal still awarded to service 
members—at Harvey Government Center in 
Key West. This medal recognizes Mr. Alce’s 
extraordinary service and sacrifice after being 
wounded as a direct result of enemy action in 
Vietnam. 
Mr. Alce was born in Key West on Decem-
ber 17, 1949. At age 18, he was drafted into 
the Army and served in the 3rd Battalion, 1st 
Infantry, Americal Division, and the 101st Air-
borne Division. Mr. Alce received decorations 
for his military service from both the United 
States Armed Forces and the government of 
South Vietnam, including the Vietnam Cam-
paign Medal, the Republic of Vietnam Gal-
lantry Cross Unit Citation with Palm, and the 
Vietnam Service Medal with three bronze 
service stars. 
Mr. Alce was wounded in the Battle for 
Hamburger Hill, which began on May 11th, 
1969. Paratroopers of the 101st Airborne Divi-
sion fought the North Vietnamese for control 
of the jungle hill in western Vietnam. Bitter 
fighting ensued for ten days, as North Viet-
namese forces beat back repeated American 
attacks. On May 20th, American forces with 
South Vietnamese reinforcements finally cap-
tured the hill, and the enemy retreated across 
the border to Laos. Mr. Alce was hit many 
times by enemy small arms fire during the bat-
tle. American casualties at Hamburger Hill 
numbered 72 killed and 372 wounded. 
In December 2019, Monroe County Vet-
erans Affairs discovered Mr. Alce had never 
received a Purple Heart. Monroe County Vet-
erans Affairs successfully petitioned the De-
partment of the Army to correct Mr. Alce’s 
record and award him the prestigious medal. 
This ceremony is the culmination of their ef-
forts, and I want to thank Monroe County Vet-
erans Affairs for their diligence on behalf of 
Mr. Alce. 
What an honor it is to recognize Mr. Alce for 
his sacrifice. He bravely put his life on the line 
serving his Nation in Vietnam, and this long 
overdue medal recognizes his courage. Let 
this ceremony inspire all of us to serve our 
country however we can as Mr. Alce did.
