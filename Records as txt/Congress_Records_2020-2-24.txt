READING OF WASHINGTON’S 
FAREWELL ADDRESS 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
WICKER). Pursuant to the order of the 
Senate of January 24, 1901, as modified 
by the order of February 4, 2020, the 
junior Senator from Wisconsin, Ms. 
BALDWIN, will now read Washington’s 
Farewell Address. 
Ms. BALDWIN, at the rostrum, read 
the Farewell Address as follows: 
To the people of the United States: 
FRIENDS
AND FELLOW-CITIZENS: The 
period for a new election of a citizen to 
administer the executive government 
of the United States being not far dis-
tant, and the time actually arrived 
when your thoughts must be employed 
in designating the person who is to be 
clothed with that important trust, it 
appears to me proper, especially as it 
may conduce to a more distinct expres-
sion of the public voice, that I should 
now apprise you of the resolution I 
have formed, to decline being consid-
ered among the number of those out of 
whom a choice is to be made. 
I beg you at the same time to do me 
the justice to be assured that this reso-
lution has not been taken without a 
strict regard to all the considerations 
appertaining to the relation which 
binds a dutiful citizen to his country— 
and that, in withdrawing the tender of 
service which silence in my situation 
might imply, I am influenced by no 
diminution of zeal for your future in-
terest, no deficiency of grateful respect 
for your past kindness, but am sup-
ported by a full conviction that the 
step is compatible with both. 
The acceptance of, and continuance 
hitherto in, the office to which your 
suffrages have twice called me have 
been a uniform sacrifice of inclination 
to the opinion of duty and to a def-
erence for what appeared to be your de-
sire. I constantly hoped that it would 
have been much earlier in my power, 
consistently with motives which I was 
not at liberty to disregard, to return to 
that retirement from which I had been 
reluctantly drawn. The strength of my 
inclination to do this, previous to the 
last election, had even led to the prepa-
ration of an address to declare it to 
you; but mature reflection on the then 
perplexed and critical posture of our 
affairs with foreign nations, and the 
unanimous advice of persons entitled 
to my confidence, impelled me to aban-
don the idea. 
I rejoice that the state of your con-
cerns, external as well as internal, no 
longer renders the pursuit of inclina-
tion incompatible with the sentiment 
of duty or propriety and am persuaded, 
whatever partiality may be retained 
for my services, that in the present cir-
cumstances of our country you will not 
disapprove my determination to retire. 
The impressions with which I first 
undertook the arduous trust were ex-
plained on the proper occasion. In the 
discharge of this trust, I will only say 
that I have, with good intentions, con-
tributed towards the organization and 
administration of the government the 
best exertions of which a very fallible 
judgment was capable. Not unconscious 
in the outset of the inferiority of my 
qualifications, experience in my own 
eyes, perhaps still more in the eyes of 
others, has strengthened the motives 
to diffidence of myself, and every day 
the increasing weight of years admon-
ishes me more and more that the shade 
of retirement is as necessary to me as 
it will be welcome. Satisfied that if 
any circumstances have given peculiar

value to my services, they were tem-
porary, I have the consolation to be-
lieve that, while choice and prudence 
invite me to quit the political scene, 
patriotism does not forbid it. 
In looking forward to the moment 
which is intended to terminate the ca-
reer of my public life, my feelings do 
not permit me to suspend the deep ac-
knowledgment of that debt of gratitude 
which I owe to my beloved country for 
the many honors it has conferred upon 
me, still more for the steadfast con-
fidence with which it has supported me 
and for the opportunities I have thence 
enjoyed of manifesting my inviolable 
attachment by services faithful and 
persevering, though in usefulness un-
equal to my zeal. If benefits have re-
sulted to our country from these serv-
ices, let it always be remembered to 
your praise and as an instructive exam-
ple in our annals that, under cir-
cumstances in which the passions agi-
tated in every direction were liable to 
mislead, 
amidst 
appearances 
some-
times dubious, vicissitudes of fortune 
often discouraging, in situations in 
which not unfrequently want of success 
has countenanced the spirit of criti-
cism, the constancy of your support 
was the essential prop of the efforts 
and a guarantee of the plans by which 
they were effected. Profoundly pene-
trated with this idea, I shall carry it 
with me to my grave as a strong incite-
ment to unceasing vows that Heaven 
may continue to you the choicest to-
kens of its beneficence; that your 
union and brotherly affection may be 
perpetual; that the free constitution, 
which is the work of your hands, may 
be sacredly maintained; that its admin-
istration in every department may be 
stamped with wisdom and virtue; that, 
in fine, the happiness of the people of 
these states, under the auspices of lib-
erty, may be made complete by so care-
ful a preservation and so prudent a use 
of this blessing as will acquire to them 
the glory of recommending it to the ap-
plause, the affection, and adoption of 
every nation which is yet a stranger to 
it. 
Here, perhaps, I ought to stop. But a 
solicitude for your welfare, which can-
not end but with my life, and the ap-
prehension of danger natural to that 
solicitude, urge me on an occasion like 
the present to offer to your solemn 
contemplation, and to recommend to 
your frequent review, some sentiments 
which are the result of much reflec-
tion, of no inconsiderable observation, 
and which appear to me all important 
to the permanency of your felicity as a 
people. These will be offered to you 
with the more freedom as you can only 
see in them the disinterested warnings 
of a parting friend, who can possibly 
have no personal motive to bias his 
counsel. Nor can I forget, as an encour-
agement to it, your indulgent recep-
tion of my sentiments on a former and 
not dissimilar occasion. 
Interwoven as is the love of liberty 
with every ligament of your hearts, no 
recommendation of mine is necessary 
to fortify or confirm the attachment. 
The unity of government which con-
stitutes you one people is also now 
dear to you. It is justly so; for it is a 
main pillar in the edifice of your real 
independence, the support of your tran-
quility at home, your peace abroad, of 
your safety, of your prosperity, of that 
very liberty which you so highly prize. 
But as it is easy to foresee that, from 
different causes and from different 
quarters, much pains will be taken, 
many artifices employed, to weaken in 
your minds the conviction of this 
truth; as this is the point in your polit-
ical fortress against which the bat-
teries of internal and external enemies 
will be most constantly and actively 
(though often covertly and insidiously) 
directed, it is of infinite moment that 
you should properly estimate the im-
mense value of your national Union to 
your collective and individual happi-
ness; that you should cherish a cordial, 
habitual, and immovable attachment 
to it; accustoming yourselves to think 
and speak of it as of the palladium of 
your political safety and prosperity; 
watching for its preservation with jeal-
ous anxiety; discountenancing what-
ever may suggest even a suspicion that 
it can in any event be abandoned; and 
indignantly frowning upon the first 
dawning of every attempt to alienate 
any portion of our country from the 
rest, or to enfeeble the sacred ties 
which now link together the various 
parts. 
For this you have every inducement 
of sympathy and interest. Citizens by 
birth or choice of a common country, 
that country has a right to concentrate 
your affections. The name of American, 
which belongs to you in your national 
capacity, must always exalt the just 
pride of patriotism more than any ap-
pellation derived from local discrimi-
nations. With slight shades of dif-
ference, you have the same religion, 
manners, habits, and political prin-
ciples. You have in a common cause 
fought and triumphed together. The 
independence and liberty you possess 
are the work of joint councils and joint 
efforts—of common dangers, sufferings, 
and successes. 
But these considerations, however 
powerfully they address themselves to 
your 
sensibility, 
are 
greatly 
out-
weighed by those which apply more im-
mediately to your interest. Here every 
portion of our country finds the most 
commanding 
motives 
for 
carefully 
guarding and preserving the Union of 
the whole. 
The North, in an unrestrained inter-
course with the South, protected by the 
equal laws of a common government, 
finds in the productions of the latter 
great additional resources of maritime 
and commercial enterprise and pre-
cious materials of manufacturing in-
dustry. The South in the same inter-
course, benefitting by the agency of 
the North, sees its agriculture grow and 
its commerce expand. Turning partly 
into its own channels the seamen of 
the North, it finds its particular navi-
gation invigorated; and while it con-
tributes, in different ways, to nourish 
and increase the general mass of the 
national navigation, it looks forward 
to 
the 
protection 
of 
a 
maritime 
strength to which itself is unequally 
adapted. The East, in a like intercourse 
with the West, already finds, and in the 
progressive improvement of interior 
communications by land and water will 
more and more find a valuable vent for 
the commodities which it brings from 
abroad or manufactures at home. The 
West derives from the East supplies req-
uisite to its growth and comfort—and 
what is perhaps of still greater con-
sequence, it must of necessity owe the 
secure enjoyment of indispensable out-
lets for its own productions to the 
weight, influence, and the future mari-
time strength of the Atlantic side of 
the Union, directed by an indissoluble 
community of interest as one nation. 
Any other tenure by which the West 
can hold this essential advantage, 
whether derived from its own separate 
strength or from an apostate and un-
natural connection with any foreign 
power, must be intrinsically precar-
ious. 
While then every part of our country 
thus feels an immediate and particular 
interest in union, all the parts com-
bined cannot fail to find in the united 
mass of means and efforts greater 
strength, greater resource, proportion-
ably greater security from external 
danger, a less frequent interruption of 
their peace by foreign nations; and, 
what is of inestimable value! they must 
derive from union an exemption from 
those broils and wars between them-
selves 
which 
so 
frequently 
afflict 
neighboring countries not tied together 
by the same government, which their 
own rivalships alone would be suffi-
cient to produce, but which opposite 
foreign alliances, attachments, and in-
trigues would stimulate and embitter. 
Hence likewise they will avoid the ne-
cessity of those overgrown military es-
tablishments, which under any form of 
government are inauspicious to liberty, 
and which are to be regarded as par-
ticularly hostile to republican liberty. 
In this sense it is, that your Union 
ought to be considered as a main prop 
of your liberty, and that the love of the 
one ought to endear to you the preser-
vation of the other. 
These considerations speak a persua-
sive language to every reflecting and 
virtuous mind and exhibit the continu-
ance of the Union as a primary object 
of patriotic desire. Is there a doubt 
whether a common government can 
embrace so large a sphere? Let experi-
ence solve it. To listen to mere specu-
lation in such a case were criminal. We 
are authorized to hope that a proper 
organization of the whole, with the 
auxiliary agency of governments for 
the respective subdivisions, will afford 
a happy issue to the experiment. It is 
well worth a fair and full experiment. 
With such powerful and obvious mo-
tives to union affecting all parts of our 
country, while experience shall not 
have 
demonstrated 
its 
imprac-
ticability, there will always be reason

S1093 
February 24, 2020 
to distrust the patriotism of those who 
in any quarter may endeavor to weak-
en its bands. 
In contemplating the causes which 
may disturb our Union, it occurs as 
matter of serious concern that any 
ground should have been furnished for 
characterizing parties by geographical 
discriminations—northern and southern— 
Atlantic and western; whence designing 
men may endeavor to excite a belief 
that there is a real difference of local 
interests and views. One of the expedi-
ents of party to acquire influence with-
in particular districts is to misrepre-
sent the opinions and aims of other dis-
tricts. You cannot shield yourselves 
too much against the jealousies and 
heart burnings which spring from these 
misrepresentations. 
They 
tend 
to 
render alien to each other those who 
ought to be bound together by fra-
ternal affection. The inhabitants of our 
western country have lately had a use-
ful lesson on this head. They have seen 
in the negotiation by the executive— 
and in the unanimous ratification by 
the Senate—of the treaty with Spain, 
and in the universal satisfaction at 
that event throughout the United 
States, a decisive proof how unfounded 
were the suspicions propagated among 
them of a policy in the general govern-
ment and in the Atlantic states un-
friendly to their interests in regard to 
the Mississippi. They have been wit-
nesses to the formation of two treaties, 
that with Great Britain and that with 
Spain, which secure to them every-
thing they could desire, in respect to 
our foreign relations, towards con-
firming their prosperity. Will it not be 
their wisdom to rely for the preserva-
tion of these advantages on the Union 
by which they were procured? Will they 
not henceforth be deaf to those advis-
ers, if such there are, who would sever 
them from their brethren and connect 
them with aliens? 
To the efficacy and permanency of 
your Union, a government for the 
whole is indispensable. No alliances, 
however strict, between the parts can 
be an adequate substitute. They must 
inevitably experience the infractions 
and interruptions which all alliances in 
all times have experienced. Sensible of 
this momentous truth, you have im-
proved upon your first essay by the 
adoption of a Constitution of govern-
ment 
better 
calculated 
than 
your 
former for an intimate Union and for 
the efficacious management of your 
common concerns. This government, 
the 
offspring 
of 
our 
own 
choice 
uninfluenced 
and 
unawed, 
adopted 
upon full investigation and mature de-
liberation, completely free in its prin-
ciples, in the distribution of its powers 
uniting security with energy, and con-
taining within itself a provision for its 
own amendment, has a just claim to 
your confidence and your support. Re-
spect for its authority, compliance 
with its laws, acquiescence in its meas-
ures, are duties enjoined by the funda-
mental maxims of true liberty. The 
basis of our political systems is the 
right of the people to make and to 
alter their constitutions of govern-
ment. But the Constitution which at 
any time exists, until changed by an 
explicit and authentic act of the whole 
people, is sacredly obligatory upon all. 
The very idea of the power and the 
right of the people to establish govern-
ment presupposes the duty of every in-
dividual to obey the established gov-
ernment. 
All obstructions to the execution of 
the laws, all combinations and associa-
tions under whatever plausible char-
acter with the real design to direct, 
control, counteract, or awe the regular 
deliberation and action of the con-
stituted authorities, are destructive of 
this fundamental principle and of fatal 
tendency. They serve to organize fac-
tion; to give it an artificial and ex-
traordinary force; to put in the place of 
the delegated will of the nation the 
will of a party, often a small but artful 
and enterprising minority of the com-
munity; and, according to the alter-
nate triumphs of different parties, to 
make the public administration the 
mirror of the ill concerted and incon-
gruous projects of faction, rather than 
the organ of consistent and wholesome 
plans digested by common councils and 
modified by mutual interests. However 
combinations or associations of the 
above description may now and then 
answer popular ends, they are likely, in 
the course of time and things, to be-
come potent engines by which cunning, 
ambitious, and unprincipled men will 
be enabled to subvert the power of the 
people and to usurp for themselves the 
reins of government, destroying after-
wards the very engines which have lift-
ed them to unjust dominion. 
Towards the preservation of your 
government and the permanency of 
your present happy state, it is req-
uisite not only that you steadily dis-
countenance irregular oppositions to 
its acknowledged authority but also 
that you resist with care the spirit of 
innovation upon its principles, however 
specious the pretexts. One method of 
assault may be to effect in the forms of 
the Constitution alterations which will 
impair the energy of the system and 
thus to undermine what cannot be di-
rectly overthrown. In all the changes 
to which you may be invited, remem-
ber that time and habit are at least as 
necessary to fix the true character of 
governments as of other human insti-
tutions, that experience is the surest 
standard by which to test the real 
tendency of the existing constitution 
of a country, that facility in changes 
upon the credit of mere hypotheses and 
opinion exposes to perpetual change 
from the endless variety of hypotheses 
and opinion; and remember, especially, 
that for the efficient management of 
your common interests in a country so 
extensive as ours, a government of as 
much vigor as is consistent with the 
perfect security of liberty is indispen-
sable; liberty itself will find in such a 
government, with powers properly dis-
tributed and adjusted, its surest guard-
ian. It is indeed little else than a name, 
where the government is too feeble to 
withstand the enterprises of faction, to 
confine each member of the society 
within the limits prescribed by the 
laws, and to maintain all in the secure 
and tranquil enjoyment of the rights of 
person and property. 
I have already intimated to you the 
danger of parties in the state, with par-
ticular reference to the founding of 
them on geographical discriminations. 
Let me now take a more comprehen-
sive view and warn you in the most sol-
emn manner against the baneful effects 
of the spirit of party, generally. 
This spirit, unfortunately, is insepa-
rable from our nature, having its root 
in the strongest passions of the human 
mind. It exists under different shapes 
in all governments, more or less sti-
fled, controlled, or repressed; but in 
those of the popular form it is seen in 
its greatest rankness and is truly their 
worst enemy. 
The alternate domination of one fac-
tion over another, sharpened by the 
spirit of revenge natural to party dis-
sension, which in different ages and 
countries has perpetrated the most 
horrid enormities, is itself a frightful 
despotism. But this leads at length to a 
more formal and permanent despotism. 
The disorders and miseries which re-
sult gradually incline the minds of men 
to seek security and repose in the abso-
lute power of an individual; and sooner 
or later the chief of some prevailing 
faction, more able or more fortunate 
than his competitors, turns this dis-
position to the purposes of his own ele-
vation on the ruins of public liberty. 
Without looking forward to an ex-
tremity of this kind (which neverthe-
less ought not to be entirely out of 
sight) the common and continual mis-
chiefs of the spirit of party are suffi-
cient to make it the interest and the 
duty of a wise people to discourage and 
restrain it. 
It serves always to distract the pub-
lic councils and enfeeble the public ad-
ministration. It agitates the commu-
nity with ill founded jealousies and 
false alarms, kindles the animosity of 
one part against another, foments oc-
casionally riot and insurrection. It 
opens the door to foreign influence and 
corruption, which find a facilitated ac-
cess to the government itself through 
the channels of party passions. Thus 
the policy and the will of one country 
are subjected to the policy and will of 
another. 
There is an opinion that parties in 
free countries are useful checks upon 
the administration of the government 
and serve to keep alive the spirit of lib-
erty. This within certain limits is prob-
ably true—and in governments of a mo-
narchical cast patriotism may look 
with indulgence, if not with favor, 
upon the spirit of party. But in those of 
the popular character, in governments 
purely elective, it is a spirit not to be 
encouraged. From their natural tend-
ency, it is certain there will always be 
enough of that spirit for every salutary

purpose. And there being constant dan-
ger of excess, the effort ought to be by 
force of public opinion to mitigate and 
assuage it. A fire not to be quenched, it 
demands a uniform vigilance to pre-
vent its bursting into a flame, lest in-
stead of warming it should consume. 
It is important, likewise, that the 
habits of thinking in a free country 
should inspire caution in those en-
trusted with its administration to con-
fine themselves within their respective 
constitutional spheres, avoiding in the 
exercise of the powers of one depart-
ment to encroach upon another. The 
spirit of encroachment tends to con-
solidate the powers of all the depart-
ments in one and thus to create, what-
ever the form of government, a real 
despotism. A just estimate of that love 
of power and proneness to abuse it 
which predominates in the human 
heart is sufficient to satisfy us of the 
truth of this position. The necessity of 
reciprocal checks in the exercise of po-
litical power, by dividing and distrib-
uting it into different depositories and 
constituting each the guardian of the 
public weal against invasions by the 
others, has been evinced by experi-
ments ancient and modern, some of 
them in our country and under our own 
eyes. To preserve them must be as nec-
essary as to institute them. If in the 
opinion of the people the distribution 
or modification of the constitutional 
powers be in any particular wrong, let 
it be corrected by an amendment in the 
way which the Constitution designates. 
But let there be no change by usurpa-
tion; for though this, in one instance, 
may be the instrument of good, it is 
the customary weapon by which free 
governments are destroyed. The prece-
dent must always greatly overbalance 
in permanent evil any partial or tran-
sient benefit which the use can at any 
time yield. 
Of all the dispositions and habits 
which lead to political prosperity, reli-
gion and morality are indispensable 
supports. In vain would that man claim 
the tribute of patriotism who should 
labor to subvert these great pillars of 
human happiness, these firmest props 
of the duties of men and citizens. The 
mere politician, equally with the pious 
man, ought to respect and to cherish 
them. A volume could not trace all 
their connections with private and pub-
lic felicity. Let it simply be asked 
where is the security for property, for 
reputation, for life, if the sense of reli-
gious obligation desert the oaths, which 
are the instruments of investigation in 
courts of justice? And let us with cau-
tion indulge the supposition that mo-
rality can be maintained without reli-
gion. Whatever may be conceded to the 
influence of refined education on minds 
of peculiar structure, reason and expe-
rience both forbid us to expect that na-
tional morality can prevail in exclu-
sion of religious principle. 
It is substantially true that virtue or 
morality is a necessary spring of pop-
ular government. The rule indeed ex-
tends with more or less force to every 
species of free government. Who that is 
a sincere friend to it can look with in-
difference upon attempts to shake the 
foundation of the fabric? 
Promote then, as an object of pri-
mary importance, institutions for the 
general diffusion of knowledge. In pro-
portion as the structure of a govern-
ment gives force to public opinion, it is 
essential that public opinion should be 
enlightened. 
As 
a 
very 
important 
source 
of 
strength and security, cherish public 
credit. One method of preserving it is 
to use it as sparingly as possible, 
avoiding occasions of expense by culti-
vating peace, but remembering also 
that timely disbursements to prepare 
for danger frequently prevent much 
greater 
disbursements 
to 
repel 
it; 
avoiding likewise the accumulation of 
debt, not only by shunning occasions of 
expense, but by vigorous exertions in 
time of peace to discharge the debts 
which unavoidable wars may have oc-
casioned, not ungenerously throwing 
upon posterity the burden which we 
ourselves ought to bear. The execution 
of these maxims belongs to your rep-
resentatives, but it is necessary that 
public opinion should cooperate. To fa-
cilitate to them the performance of 
their duty, it is essential that you 
should practically bear in mind that 
towards the payment of debts there 
must be revenue; that to have revenue 
there must be taxes; that no taxes can 
be devised which are not more or less 
inconvenient and unpleasant; that the 
intrinsic embarrassment inseparable 
from the selection of the proper objects 
(which is always a choice of difficul-
ties) ought to be a decisive motive for 
a candid construction of the conduct of 
the government in making it, and for a 
spirit of acquiescence in the measures 
for obtaining revenue which the public 
exigencies may at any time dictate. 
Observe good faith and justice to-
wards all nations; cultivate peace and 
harmony with all; religion and moral-
ity enjoin this conduct, and can it be 
that good policy does not equally en-
join it? It will be worthy of a free, en-
lightened, and, at no distant period, a 
great nation, to give to mankind the 
magnanimous and too novel example of 
a people always guided by an exalted 
justice and benevolence. Who can doubt 
that in the course of time and things 
the fruits of such a plan would richly 
repay any temporary advantages which 
might be lost by a steady adherence to 
it? Can it be, that Providence has not 
connected the permanent felicity of a 
nation with its virtue? The experiment, 
at least, is recommended by every sen-
timent which ennobles human nature. 
Alas! is it rendered impossible by its 
vices? 
In the execution of such a plan noth-
ing is more essential than that perma-
nent, inveterate antipathies against 
particular nations and passionate at-
tachments for others should be ex-
cluded and that in place of them just 
and 
amicable 
feelings 
towards 
all 
should be cultivated. The nation which 
indulges towards another an habitual 
hatred, or an habitual fondness, is in 
some degree a slave. It is a slave to its 
animosity or to its affection, either of 
which is sufficient to lead it astray 
from its duty and its interest. Antip-
athy in one nation against another dis-
poses each more readily to offer insult 
and injury, to lay hold of slight causes 
of umbrage, and to be haughty and in-
tractable when accidental or trifling 
occasions of dispute occur. Hence fre-
quent collisions, obstinate, envenomed, 
and 
bloody 
contests. 
The 
nation, 
prompted by ill will and resentment, 
sometimes impels to war the govern-
ment, contrary to the best calculations 
of policy. The government sometimes 
participates in the national propensity 
and adopts through passion what rea-
son would reject; at other times, it 
makes the animosity of the nation sub-
servient to projects of hostility insti-
gated by pride, ambition and other sin-
ister and pernicious motives. The peace 
often, sometimes perhaps the liberty, 
of nations has been the victim. 
So likewise, a passionate attachment 
of one nation for another produces a 
variety of evils. Sympathy for the fa-
vorite nation, facilitating the illusion 
of an imaginary common interest in 
cases where no real common interest 
exists and infusing into one the enmi-
ties of the other, betrays the former 
into a participation in the quarrels and 
wars of the latter, without adequate in-
ducement or justification. It leads also 
to concessions to the favorite nation of 
privileges denied to others, which is 
apt doubly to injure the nation making 
the concessions, by unnecessarily part-
ing with what ought to have been re-
tained and by exciting jealousy, ill 
will, and a disposition to retaliate in 
the parties from whom equal privileges 
are withheld. And it gives to ambi-
tious, corrupted, or deluded citizens 
(who devote themselves to the favorite 
nation) facility to betray or sacrifice 
the interests of their own country 
without odium, sometimes even with 
popularity, gilding with the appear-
ances of a virtuous sense of obligation, 
a commendable deference for public 
opinion, or a laudable zeal for public 
good, the base or foolish compliances 
of ambition, corruption, or infatuation. 
As avenues to foreign influence in in-
numerable ways, such attachments are 
particularly alarming to the truly en-
lightened and independent patriot. How 
many opportunities do they afford to 
tamper with domestic factions, to prac-
tice the arts of seduction, to mislead 
public opinion, to influence or awe the 
public councils! Such an attachment of 
a small or weak towards a great and 
powerful nation dooms the former to be 
the satellite of the latter. 
Against the insidious wiles of foreign 
influence (I conjure you to believe me, 
fellow citizens) the jealousy of a free 
people ought to be constantly awake, 
since history and experience prove that 
foreign influence is one of the most 
baneful foes of republican government. 
But that jealousy to be useful must be

impartial; else it becomes the instru-
ment of the very influence to be avoid-
ed, instead of a defense against it. Ex-
cessive partiality for one foreign na-
tion and excessive dislike of another 
cause those whom they actuate to see 
danger only on one side, and serve to 
veil and even second the arts of influ-
ence on the other. Real patriots, who 
may resist the intrigues of the favor-
ite, are liable to become suspected and 
odious, while its tools and dupes usurp 
the applause and confidence of the peo-
ple to surrender their interests. 
The great rule of conduct for us in re-
gard to foreign nations is, in extending 
our commercial relations, to have with 
them as little political connection as 
possible. So far as we have already 
formed engagements, let them be ful-
filled with perfect good faith. Here let 
us stop. 
Europe has a set of primary inter-
ests, which to us have none or a very 
remote relation. Hence she must be en-
gaged in frequent controversies, the 
causes of which are essentially foreign 
to our concerns. Hence therefore it 
must be unwise in us to implicate our-
selves, by artificial ties, in the ordi-
nary vicissitudes of her politics or the 
ordinary combinations and collisions of 
her friendships or enmities. 
Our detached and distant situation 
invites and enables us to pursue a dif-
ferent course. If we remain one people 
under an efficient government, the pe-
riod is not far off when we may defy 
material injury from external annoy-
ance; when we may take such an atti-
tude as will cause the neutrality we 
may at any time resolve upon to be 
scrupulously respected; when bellig-
erent nations, under the impossibility 
of making acquisitions upon us, will 
not lightly hazard the giving us provo-
cation; when we may choose peace or 
war, as our interest guided by justice 
shall counsel. 
Why forgo the advantages of so pecu-
liar a situation? Why quit our own to 
stand upon foreign ground? Why, by 
interweaving our destiny with that of 
any part of Europe, entangle our peace 
and prosperity in the toils of European 
ambition, rival-ship, interest, humor, 
or caprice? 
It is our true policy to steer clear of 
permanent alliances with any portion 
of the foreign world—so far, I mean, as 
we are now at liberty to do it, for let 
me not be understood as capable of pa-
tronizing infidelity to existing engage-
ments (I hold the maxim no less appli-
cable to public than to private affairs, 
that honesty is always the best pol-
icy)—I repeat it therefore, let those en-
gagements be observed in their genuine 
sense. But in my opinion it is unneces-
sary and would be unwise to extend 
them. 
Taking care always to keep our-
selves, by suitable establishments, on a 
respectably defensive posture, we may 
safely trust to temporary alliances for 
extraordinary emergencies. 
Harmony, liberal intercourse with all 
nations, are recommended by policy, 
humanity, and interest. But even our 
commercial policy should hold an 
equal and impartial hand: neither seek-
ing nor granting exclusive favors or 
preferences; consulting the natural 
course of things; diffusing and diversi-
fying by gentle means the streams of 
commerce but forcing nothing; estab-
lishing with powers so disposed—in 
order to give to trade a stable course, 
to define the rights of our merchants, 
and to enable the government to sup-
port them—conventional rules of inter-
course, the best that present cir-
cumstances and mutual opinion will 
permit, but temporary, and liable to be 
from time to time abandoned or varied, 
as experience and circumstances shall 
dictate; constantly keeping in view, 
that it is folly in one nation to look for 
disinterested favors from another— 
that it must pay with a portion of its 
independence for whatever it may ac-
cept under that character—that by 
such acceptance it may place itself in 
the condition of having given equiva-
lents for nominal favors and yet of 
being reproached with ingratitude for 
not giving more. There can be no great-
er error than to expect or calculate 
upon real favors from nation to nation. 
It is an illusion which experience must 
cure, which a just pride ought to dis-
card. 
In offering to you, my countrymen, 
these counsels of an old and affec-
tionate friend, I dare not hope they 
will make the strong and lasting im-
pression I could wish—that they will 
control the usual current of the pas-
sions or prevent our nation from run-
ning the course which has hitherto 
marked the destiny of nations. But if I 
may even flatter myself that they may 
be productive of some partial benefit, 
some occasional good, that they may 
now and then recur to moderate the 
fury of party spirit, to warn against 
the mischiefs of foreign intrigue, to 
guard against the impostures of pre-
tended patriotism—this hope will be a 
full recompense for the solicitude for 
your welfare by which they have been 
dictated. 
How far in the discharge of my offi-
cial duties I have been guided by the 
principles which have been delineated, 
the public records and other evidences 
of my conduct must witness to you and 
to the world. To myself, the assurance 
of my own conscience is that I have at 
least believed myself to be guided by 
them. 
In relation to the still subsisting war 
in Europe, my proclamation of the 22d 
of April 1793 is the index to my plan. 
Sanctioned by your approving voice 
and by that of your representatives in 
both houses of Congress, the spirit of 
that measure has continually governed 
me, uninfluenced by any attempts to 
deter or divert me from it. 
After deliberate examination with 
the aid of the best lights I could ob-
tain, I was well satisfied that our coun-
try, under all the circumstances of the 
case, had a right to take—and was 
bound in duty and interest to take—a 
neutral position. Having taken it, I de-
termined, as far as should depend upon 
me, to maintain it with moderation, 
perseverence, and firmness. 
The considerations which respect the 
right to hold this conduct it is not nec-
essary on this occasion to detail. I will 
only observe that, according to my un-
derstanding of the matter, that right, 
so far from being denied by any of the 
belligerent powers, has been virtually 
admitted by all. 
The duty of holding a neutral con-
duct may be inferred, without anything 
more, from the obligation which jus-
tice and humanity impose on every na-
tion, in cases in which it is free to act, 
to maintain inviolate the relations of 
peace and amity towards other nations. 
The inducements of interest for ob-
serving that conduct will best be re-
ferred to your own reflections and ex-
perience. With me, a predominant mo-
tive has been to endeavor to gain time 
to our country to settle and mature its 
yet recent institutions and to progress 
without interruption to that degree of 
strength and consistency which is nec-
essary to give it, humanly speaking, 
the command of its own fortunes. 
Though in reviewing the incidents of 
my administration I am unconscious of 
intentional error, I am nevertheless 
too sensible of my defects not to think 
it probable that I may have committed 
many errors. Whatever they may be, I 
fervently beseech the Almighty to 
avert or mitigate the evils to which 
they may tend. I shall also carry with 
me the hope that my country will 
never cease to view them with indul-
gence and that, after forty-five years of 
my life dedicated to its service with an 
upright zeal, the faults of incompetent 
abilities will be consigned to oblivion, 
as myself must soon be to the man-
sions of rest. 
Relying on its kindness in this as in 
other things, and actuated by that fer-
vent love towards it which is so nat-
ural to a man who views in it the na-
tive soil of himself and his progenitors 
for several generations, I anticipate 
with pleasing expectation that retreat, 
in which I promise myself to realize 
without alloy the sweet enjoyment of 
partaking in the midst of my fellow 
citizens the benign influence of good 
laws under a free government—the ever 
favorite object of my heart, and the 
happy reward, as I trust, of our mutual 
cares, labors and dangers.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1096 
February 24, 2020 
tenure as Acting Director of National 
Intelligence and Director of National 
Counterterrorism 
Center 
concluded 
last week. 
Joe Maguire spent 36 years serving 
our Nation as a U.S. Navy special oper-
ator. His leadership record included 
SEAL Team 2 and the U.S. Navy Spe-
cial Warfare Command, where he guid-
ed some of our Nation’s most sensitive 
military operations. 
Admiral Maguire retired from the 
Navy in 2010, but it was not long before 
public service came calling again. In 
2018, the President asked him to direct 
the NCTC. The Senate confirmed him 
on a voice vote. 
He took on an even more challenging 
assignment 
last 
summer 
when 
he 
agreed to follow our former colleague 
Senator Dan Coats and act in the role 
of the DNI. 
Our Nation asks our intelligence 
community to fulfill an enormous 
array of sensitive missions. These men 
and women work day and night to pro-
tect the homeland from terrorists. 
They fight nuclear proliferation. They 
keep watch on dangerous adversaries, 
like Russia and China. They guard 
against what hostile intelligence serv-
ices are doing in our Nation, and they 
work to protect American elections 
from foreign interference that seeks to 
sow division and chaos and reduce pub-
lic confidence in our democracy. 
Recent reports suggest that adver-
saries, including Russia, are likely con-
tinuing efforts aimed at dividing Amer-
icans, sowing chaos in our politics, and 
undermining confidence in our elec-
tions. Fortunately, in stark contrast to 
the failures of the Obama administra-
tion in 2016, the Trump administration, 
once again, appears to be doing the 
right thing—in this case, by promptly 
providing a specific counterintelligence 
briefing to a Democratic Presidential 
candidate in question. This is just the 
latest example of the vigilance and the 
action we have seen from this adminis-
tration on this crucial issue. 
In parallel with hundreds of millions 
that Congress has appropriated in new 
election security assistance for State 
and local authorities, the administra-
tion has taken major proactive steps. 
The Treasury Department has sanc-
tioned numerous Russian entities in-
volved in the 2016 interference. The De-
partment of Homeland Security has 
worked closely with States, local juris-
dictions, and the private sector to bol-
ster our cyber security defenses. 
The Obama administration’s naive 
and belated efforts failed to deter or to 
defend against Russian interference in 
2016 and failed to provide substantive 
counterintelligence briefings to the 
Trump and Clinton campaigns. By con-
trast, the Trump administration has 
been vigilant and appears to be pro-
viding timely warnings to candidates 
affected by foreign intelligence activi-
ties. This is critically important work, 
and it wouldn’t be possible without the 
hard work of our intelligence commu-
nity to identify the hostile activities. 
This is just one of many critical 
tasks the intelligence community per-
forms for our country. Our country is 
safer and stronger when they have the 
tools and the resources they need and 
leadership that understands that polit-
ical bias must have no quarter in intel-
ligence work and that all Americans’ 
rights need protecting. 
f 
SENATE LEGISLATIVE AGENDA 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, now 
on another matter, this week the Sen-
ate will continue to fulfill both of our 
constitutional charges: We will vote on 
important legislation, and we will pro-
vide advice and consent on a number of 
Presidential 
nominations. 
We 
will 
begin with two nominations to the 
Federal bench in U.S. territories. 
Judge Robert Molloy, who currently 
sits on the U.S. Virgin Islands Superior 
Court, is nominated to serve on the 
U.S. District Court for the Virgin Is-
lands for a term of 10 years. Judge 
Silvia Carreno-Coll currently serves as 
a U.S. magistrate judge for the District 
of Puerto Rico and has been nominated 
to be a U.S. district judge. Both nomi-
nations were reported out of com-
mittee on a voice vote. 
This week we will also consider Kath-
arine MacGregor, the President’s nomi-
nee to be Deputy Secretary of the Inte-
rior, and Travis Greaves, a nominee to 
serve as judge on the U.S. Tax Court 
for a term of 15 years. 
But first, following the first two 
nominations, the Senate will turn to 
important legislation put forward by 
Senators GRAHAM and SASSE to expand 
protections for innocent lives. Senator 
GRAHAM’s Pain-Capable Unborn Child 
Protection Act would finally remove 
the United States from a list of only 
seven nations, including China and 
North Korea, that permit elective abor-
tion after 20 weeks. It would bring our 
Nation’s regard for the unborn off this 
sad and radical fringe and bring us 
more in line with the global main-
stream. 
I do not believe this legislation 
should be controversial, but even less 
controversial 
should 
be 
Senator 
SASSE’s Born-Alive Abortion Survivors 
Protection Act. It would simply ensure 
that infants who survive abortion at-
tempts receive the same level of profes-
sional care as any other children. 
My colleagues and I will have more 
to say on this subject in the days 
ahead, but I will urge all Senators to 
join me in supporting these nominees 
and these pieces of legislation when we 
vote on them this week. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Ms. 
ERNST). The clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. CASEY. Madam President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded.

objection, it is so ordered.

BLACK HISTORY MONTH 
Mr. CASEY. Madam President, I rise 
today 
to 
celebrate 
Black 
History 
Month and to pay tribute to Penn-
sylvanians whose work has made a real 
difference in our Commonwealth. 
This year we will honor three indi-
viduals who have dedicated themselves 
to uplifting the lives of others. We 
know that Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., 
once said: ‘‘Life’s most persistent and 
urgent question is: ‘What are you doing 
for others?’ ’’ For purposes of today’s 
remarks, I will substitute one word. I 
will substitute the word ‘‘children’’ for 
the word ‘‘others’’ and ask: What are 
you doing for our children? 
It is an important question, not only 
for those of us who gather for Black 
History Month today and to celebrate 
this month, but it is also an important 
question for every Member of Congress 
to ask themselves. 
This year we are going to honor these 
three Pennsylvanians: Kathy Elliott, 
Rosemary 
Browne, 
and 
Ellyn 
Jo 
Waller. All three have dedicated their 
lives to answering this urgent question 
and to building pathways toward hope 
for children in their communities. 
I can think of no calling more impor-
tant and no mission more essential 
than this one: to help our children. It 
is an honor for me to have the privilege 
to recognize these remarkable Penn-
sylvanians. They are beacons in their 
communities, and they are each, in 
their own way, an inspiration to me in 
my work in the Senate and, I know, to 
the work of our staff as well. 
American children face a crisis cre-
ated by policy choices made by adults 
over now several decades. Despite low 
unemployment and overall economic 
growth, children are being left out and 
left behind. Almost half of young chil-
dren in the United States of America 
live in poverty or near poverty, with 
infants and toddlers at greatest risk.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1097 
February 24, 2020 
Nearly half of children live in those 
circumstances. 
According to the Census Bureau’s 
‘‘Supplemental 
Poverty 
Measure,’’ 
which takes into account many of the 
government programs designed to as-
sist low-income families and individ-
uals, 
childhood 
poverty 
worsened— 
worsened—in 2017 for the first time 
since the Great Recession. 
Poverty harms children both imme-
diately and for a lifetime, the National 
Academies of Science, Engineering, 
and Medicine concluded in their 2019 
seminal report, ‘‘A Roadmap to Reduc-
ing Child Poverty.’’ They found that 
poverty itself, especially when it oc-
curs in early childhood or is persistent 
over time, is damaging to children in 
ways that last a lifetime. 
Specifically, the report finds the fol-
lowing—and I am quoting the National 
Academies of Science, Engineering, 
and Medicine: ‘‘We find overwhelming 
evidence . . . that . . . a child growing 
up in a family whose income is below 
the poverty line experiences worse out-
comes than a child from a wealthier 
family in virtually every dimension, 
from physical and mental health, to 
educational attainment and labor mar-
ket success, to risky behaviors and de-
linquency.’’ 
This is a crisis of untapped potential 
opportunities. It is a crisis, as well, of 
contributions not made. When a child 
faces needless obstacles to becoming 
the person he or she might become, it 
is a profound tragedy that affects all of 
us because we are denying not just that 
child but also that family, that child’s 
family, their community, and our 
country the contributions that child 
could make if we were investing in that 
child. 
Over time, corrupt forces have per-
verted the basic notions of freedom 
while creating a society that works for 
corporate interests rather than our 
children’s best interests. Freedom, as 
we know, is not simply the right to be 
left alone. Real freedom must include 
the opportunity—the affirmative abil-
ity—to achieve one’s dreams. 
A country that claims to support the 
freedom of its people must provide op-
portunities to its citizens. For exam-
ple, in his second inaugural address, 
President Obama said the following: 
We do not believe that in this country free-
dom is reserved for the lucky, or happiness 
for the few. We recognize that no matter how 
responsibly we live our lives, any one of us, 
at any time, may face a job loss, or a sudden 
illness, or a home swept away in a terrible 
storm. The commitments we make to each 
other . . . these things do not sap our initia-
tive, they strengthen us. They don’t make us 
a nation of takers; they free us to take the 
risks that make this country great. 
President Obama was right, and he 
knew then that there were and are 
today extraordinary people across the 
country who are working to give our 
children the opportunity to achieve 
and grow and contribute so much to 
our Nation. 
Today I will speak about three 
women who are doing this work in the 
Commonwealth of Pennsylvania: first, 
Rosemary Browne of Harrisburg, Penn-
sylvania. For over 35 years, Rosemary 
Browne has been a leader in South Cen-
tral Pennsylvania. During that time, 
she has held a number of critical roles 
in both the government sector and the 
nonprofit sector. 
She is currently the President and 
CEO of Alder Health Services, the mis-
sion of which is to improve the health 
and well-being of persons living with 
HIV/AIDS and members of the LGBTQ 
community in a culturally competent, 
affirming, and empowering environ-
ment. The agency provides behavioral 
health, primary care, case manage-
ment, wellness services, HIV/STD test-
ing and treatment, family planning, 
and a host of other programs. 
Critically, Alder Health provides a 
safe haven for LGBTQ youth, and we 
know that significant progress has 
been made in advancing the rights of 
LGBTQ 
individuals. 
However, 
the 
progress has been uneven, and we are 
still falling far short, for example, in 
serving transgender young people, es-
pecially transgender young people of 
color who face disproportionally higher 
rates of suicide and violence. Alder 
Health, under Rosemary Browne’s lead-
ership, has played an indispensable role 
in helping us better understand the 
challenges of LGBTQ adolescents and 
providing them with the services they 
need. 
In 2018 Rosemary was appointed to 
Governor Tom Wolf’s Pennsylvania 
Commission on LGBTQ Affairs, the 
first-of-its-kind statewide commission 
in the Nation. Rosemary’s work at 
Alder builds on her primary work at 
the Highmark Foundation, where she 
led efforts to address emerging commu-
nity health challenges and to make 
sure that uninsured and underserved 
populations in South Central Pennsyl-
vania had the attention and the serv-
ices that they needed. In this capacity, 
she spearheaded efforts to address bul-
lying in our schools and our commu-
nities as a public health problem and 
also provided leadership on a strategy 
to reduce childhood obesity through 
school and community-based partner-
ships. 
Prior to her work at Highmark Foun-
dation, Rosemary spent a decade at the 
Foundation for Enhancing Commu-
nities as a program officer and then di-
rector of programs and community in-
vestment, where she oversaw tens of 
millions of investment in community 
services and tuition assistance, giving 
hundreds of area college-bound stu-
dents the opportunity to pursue higher 
education. 
Over her career, Rosemary Browne 
has heeded the call of service and lent 
her considerable passion and expertise 
in many different capacities. Whatever 
the role, the work has been the same: 
putting a spotlight on the needs of the 
underserved 
populations—LGBTQ 
youth, girls of color, and other under-
served populations who lack access to 
healthcare, higher education—and al-
ways—always—helping them to obtain 
the services they need and to remove 
the obstacles that stand between them 
and their full potential. 
Service has always been a part of 
Rosemary’s work, believing, as she 
does, that we are given resources and 
influence not for ourselves but for oth-
ers. 
Also, like Rosemary Browne, Dr. 
Kathi Elliott’s career has been defined 
by her service to others and to the chil-
dren and young people of Pennsylvania. 
In this case, in Southwestern Pennsyl-
vania. Kathi came to this work natu-
rally, having had those values instilled 
in her by her late mother, the former 
police commander of Pittsburgh, Gwen 
Elliott. 
We have had South Central Pennsyl-
vania with Rosemary Browne. Now we 
are in Southwestern Pennsylvania with 
Dr. Kathi Elliott. 
Kathi’s mom, Gwen, the late police 
commander, was herself a trailblazer 
and someone whose story also should 
be told. We don’t have time for two sto-
ries in one family today, but I will tell 
part of Gwen’s story as well. 
Gwen was one of the first African- 
American women officers in the Pitts-
burgh Police Department, joining the 
department in 1976 and eventually ris-
ing to the rank of commander. In 2002, 
Gwen founded Gwen’s Girls, an organi-
zation dedicated to empowering girls 
and young women through holistic, 
gender-specific programs, education, 
and experiences through after school— 
school and community-based program-
ming throughout the communities in 
Southwestern 
Pennsylvania. 
Gwen’s 
Girls has grown to provide service 
throughout the region with sites in 
Pittsburgh, 
Wilkinsburg, 
and 
Clarendon, PA. 
Given her mother’s leadership, it is 
no surprise that Dr. Kathi Elliott has 
demonstrated the same commitment to 
and passion for leadership, develop-
ment, and empowerment of girls. 
Prior to accepting the position of 
CEO of Gwen’s Girls in 2015, Kathi 
spent years providing leadership in so-
cial service, community, and indi-
vidual mental health treatment. Kathi 
began her career as a victim advocate 
at the Center for Victims, working 
mostly in the juvenile justice space. 
She also remains a practicing psy-
chiatric nurse practitioner. In that ca-
pacity, she provides psychiatric evalua-
tions, medication management, and 
clinical 
consultation 
services 
and 
treatment at the VA of Pittsburgh— 
their outpatient mental health clinic. 
Dr. Elliott completed dual master’s 
degrees in nursing and social work 
from the University of Pittsburgh and 
earned a doctor of nursing practice de-
gree from Chatham University in 2014. 
Through 
Dr. 
Elliott’s 
leadership, 
Gwen’s Girls has become recognized as 
a frontrunner in the integration of evi-
dence-based, clinical prevention and 
intervention policies and practices that 
enhance the child and social welfare 
system.

February 24, 2020 
Gwen’s Girls convenes an annual eq-
uity summit for Black girls to address 
the racial and gender biases that exist 
within the juvenile justice, health and 
wellness, child welfare, and education 
systems. 
Dr. Elliott has also remained a con-
stant leading force and convener of the 
Black Girls Equity Alliance—a collabo-
ration of over 75 stakeholders com-
mitted to addressing systemic inequi-
ties in the juvenile justice, child wel-
fare, education, and healthcare sys-
tems. 
Dr. Elliott currently serves on the 
board of trustees at Chatham Univer-
sity. In December 2017, she was ap-
pointed by Mayor Bill Peduto to serve 
as a commissioner on the newly formed 
Gender Equity Commission for the City 
of Pittsburgh. 
Our third honoree today, Dr. Ellyn Jo 
Waller, though she was born in Queens, 
NY, we are proud to call her a daughter 
of Pennsylvania. Many in Philadelphia 
know her as a member and a leader at 
Enon Tabernacle Baptist Church, as 
well as the partner, in both life and 
ministry, of Dr. Alyn Waller, senior 
pastor of Enon Tabernacle Baptist 
Church. Ellyn Jo Waller earned a bach-
elor of special education from Ohio 
University, a master of education in 
curriculum, 
instruction, 
and 
tech-
nology in education, and a doctor of 
education and curriculum, instruction, 
and technology in education, with an 
emphasis on literary education, from 
Temple University. 
Dr. Waller has devoted her passion 
and her time to promoting women’s 
education and empowerment. She has 
especially devoted much of her time to 
combating human trafficking, both 
here in the United States and inter-
nationally. She is an active member of 
the Philadelphia Anti-Human Traf-
ficking Coalition and serves as cochair 
of the religion subcommittee. 
In 2011, Dr. Waller founded She’s My 
Sister, an anti-human trafficking min-
istry at Enon Tabernacle. She’s My 
Sister works to ensure that the faith 
community in Greater Philadelphia is 
aware of the issue of human trafficking 
and also partners with the Greater 
Philadelphia Salvation Army on the 
issue of participating in street out-
reach, supporting and strengthening 
the drop-in centers, and advocating on 
behalf of victims of human trafficking 
and sexual exploitation. 
In October of 2015, under Dr. Waller’s 
leadership, the ministry hosted its In-
augural Human Trafficking Awareness 
5K Walk/Run to raise funds for a tran-
sitional residential program for young 
women exiting the life and aging out of 
the child welfare system. 
Internationally, Dr. Waller regularly 
participates in rescue and restoration 
efforts in Italy and South Africa. Dr. 
Waller also serves on a number of 
boards and provides community leader-
ship in other ways. She is a member of 
the board of the City School in Phila-
delphia, on the advisory committee of 
the United Negro College Funds, Dela-
ware Valley Women of Faith for Edu-
cation annual luncheon, and is presi-
dent of the Charitas Foundation, which 
is the philanthropic Waller family 
foundation established to positively 
impact the lives of individuals by sow-
ing financial seeds into organizations 
that change lives through their mis-
sions. 
Dr. Waller has served on the Founda-
tion Board of the Community College 
of Philadelphia since 2014 and currently 
serves as the president of the Founda-
tion Board. 
Each of our honorees today—these 
three remarkable women—have worked 
tirelessly to ensure that our children 
can flourish and can fulfill their poten-
tial. When others may look the other 
way or even wash their hands of the 
solemn duty to help our children, our 
honorees have instead volunteered for 
service over and over again. 
To refer back to the first question I 
started with, ‘‘What are you doing for 
our children,’’ each of us has an obliga-
tion to answer that question. Each of 
our three honorees today have an-
swered that question by devoting their 
lives to the urgent work of helping our 
children. 
These 
three 
remarkable 
women—all Pennsylvanians—have pro-
vided pathways to hope. For that, we 
owe them our deepest gratitude. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
ABORTION 
Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, this 
week, the Senate will vote on two bills 
that will protect our most vulnerable 
citizens—literally, our babies. The first 
bill we will vote on is the Born-Alive 
Abortion Survivors Protection Act, 
which was introduced by our colleague 
from Nebraska, Senator SASSE. 
This 
legislation 
is 
simple 
and 
straightforward. It requires physicians 
and healthcare providers to treat ba-
bies who survive an abortion with the 
same lifesaving care that other infants 
born at the same stage receive. While 
you might be forgiven for wondering, 
why would we need such a bill; surely, 
that standard must already exist in our 
law—unfortunately, no. There are no 
Federal laws requiring healthcare pro-
viders to care for abortion survivors, 
just as they would for any other infant 
in their care. 
One of the most notorious reasons 
why we need this law sits in the Gov-
ernor’s mansion in Virginia. About this 
time 
last 
year, 
our 
country 
was 
shocked and outraged by comments 
made by Gov. Ralph Northam—a pedia-
trician, believe it or not—about what 
should happen when a baby is delivered 
and survives an abortion. He said: 
The infant would be delivered. The infant 
would be kept comfortable. The infant would 
be resuscitated if that’s what the mother and 
family desired. And then a discussion would 
ensue between the physicians and the moth-
er. 
Rather than immediately doing ev-
erything possible to save the baby, to 
provide the same sort of care he would 
to any infant, he wants to sit around 
and decide whether the baby will live 
or die. That is not healthcare; that is 
infanticide. Voting for the Born-Alive 
Abortion Survivors Protection Act is 
how each Member of this Chamber can 
go on record to say they are against 
killing innocent babies. 
While some are desperately trying to 
paint this as an anti-abortion bill, 
which would infringe on women’s re-
productive rights, those claims could 
not be further from the truth. There is 
nothing in this bill about limiting ac-
cess to abortion, no mention of first, 
second, or third trimester abortions, 
nothing 
about 
overturning 
Roe 
v. 
Wade. 
There is one goal with this legisla-
tion and one goal only: to give every 
baby a fighting chance. In a rational 
world, we wouldn’t be having this dis-
cussion 
but 
would, 
rather, 
unani-
mously be condemning this practice for 
the evil that it is. I am proud to be an 
original cosponsor of the bill and, once 
again, vote to stop the practice of in-
fanticide and protect babies who sur-
vive abortions alive. 
We will be voting on a second bill, 
which will provide protections for un-
born children that are practiced in al-
most all of the civilized world. This is 
the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protec-
tion Act that would make it a crime 
for doctors to perform abortions on un-
born babies at or beyond 20 weeks. 
There is significant medical research 
that shows that unborn children at this 
stage experience pain. At 5 months into 
a pregnancy, these babies are beyond 
halfway to delivery. 
One of President’s Trump’s guests at 
the State of the Union a few weeks ago 
was 2-year-old Ellie Schneider—one of 
the youngest babies to survive in the 
United States. Ellie was born at 21 
weeks and 6 days—just 13 days beyond 
the point in time we are discussing. 
She weighed less than a pound at birth 
and is living proof of the medical 
achievements and advancements that 
have improved the chance of survival 
for extremely premature babies. 
Ellie and her mother Robin are an ex-
ample of the impact this legislation 
would have on the lives of many Amer-
icans families. Unfortunately, just as 
our Democratic colleagues have tried 
to deceive the American people about 
the purpose of the Born-Alive Abortion 
Survivors Protection Act, they are try-
ing to mislead everyone about what 
this bill would do as well. 
First, this bill would apply only to 
elective abortions, not those involving 
rape or incest or where the life of the 
mother could be in danger. It in no way 
places the mother in legal jeopardy for 
seeking an abortion. It clearly and 
solely 
places 
responsibility 
on 
healthcare providers.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1099 
February 24, 2020 
Passing 
this 
legislation 
wouldn’t 
make the United States an extreme 
outlier when it comes to abortion prac-
tices. In fact, it would put us in line 
with international norms. Currently, 
only seven countries in the world allow 
elective abortions after 20 weeks. One, 
of course, is the United States. The 
other countries on the list should make 
all of us second-guess allowing abor-
tions beyond 20 weeks—China, Viet-
nam, North Korea. Countries with a 
history of human rights violations are 
hardly the model we should aspire to. 
It is time to give every baby a chance 
to live and stop doctors from per-
forming abortions on infants who feel 
pain. I am proud to be a cosponsor of 
both of these bills and stand with my 
colleagues in the fight for human life. 
Our friend from Montana, Senator 
DAINES, established the first-ever Sen-
ate Pro-Life Caucus to fight for the 
lives of our most vulnerable citizens. A 
couple of weeks ago, he said: ‘‘These 
back-to-back votes will present an op-
portunity for Senate Democrats and all 
of us to show the American people 
whether there are any limits at all to 
radical abortion extremism.’’ We will 
soon learn the answer. 
I appreciate our colleagues—Senator 
SASSE, Senator GRAHAM, and Senator 
DAINES—for their leadership on this 
legislation and for consistently fight-
ing for the most vulnerable among us. 
I will be a proud ‘‘yes’’ vote on both of 
these bills—yes to protecting newborn 
babies, yes to equal medical care for all 
infants, and yes to a fighting chance 
for all babies. 
CORONAVIRUS 
Madam President, we are returning 
to Washington, DC, from time spent in 
our States. I was happy, for one, to get 
time to spend in Texas with constitu-
ents. I traveled the State, as I am sure 
many of us did, traveling from Mid-
land, to Ft. Worth, to Corpus Christi, 
and a number of spots in between. 
Texas is a pretty big place, so it takes 
a little time to move around, but it is 
really great to be able to hear from the 
folks I represent—the folks we all rep-
resent—about what they care about the 
most. 
One of the most interesting things to 
me is how little they talk about what 
is talked about inside the bubble here 
known as Washington, DC. In San An-
tonio, for example, I met with State 
and local officials to discuss their 
growing concerns over coronavirus. 
Lackland Air Force Base is one of the 
designated locations where Americans 
evacuated from overseas with sus-
pected exposure to coronavirus are 
being held under the first Federal quar-
antine in more than 50 years. Folks 
were naturally concerned about the 
fact that these evacuees were sched-
uled to be transported to local civilian 
hospitals for testing rather than re-
maining on the base where they are 
quarantined. In our meeting, we were 
able to speak with not only the mayor 
and two council persons, but we were 
able to speak with officials from the 
Department of Health and Human 
Services and the Defense Department 
about these concerns, and I am glad we 
were able to come up with a better so-
lution. The Department of Health and 
Human Services has now updated their 
protocol to ensure that testing for 
coronavirus will be conducted at Joint 
Base Lackland’s quarantine housing, so 
evacuees will not be sent to hospitals 
in the area for their tests. 
I appreciate my colleagues at the 
city who have been working overtime 
to keep their residents there safe. I am 
grateful to the administration for ad-
dressing our concerns and being re-
sponsive to those questions. 
On the very day we met, 90 evacuees 
were released from quarantine, and I 
am happy they are finally headed 
home. I am sure I am not as happy as 
they are after being quarantined. We 
owe a huge thank-you to the medical 
professionals who have and will con-
tinue to care for those in quarantine 
and to the Bexar County and San Anto-
nio officials who are working to safe-
guard public health. 
PRESCRIPTION DRUG COSTS 
Madam President, I traveled up I–35 
and was in Ft. Worth at the Northside 
Community Health Center to hear 
about an entirely different healthcare 
challenge, which is high prescription 
drug costs. 
I met with local healthcare profes-
sionals, advocates, and patients to hear 
about their experiences with these ris-
ing costs, and I have introduced legis-
lation to address them. For example, 
we heard from Randall Barker and his 
daughter Emma, who both have diabe-
tes. They need insulin. They told me 
that one bottle of insulin costs up-
wards of $281. Randall continues to 
make sacrifices to afford the lifesaving 
drugs he and Emma need to lead 
healthy lives. 
As I mentioned, to address the high 
costs of prescription drugs, I intro-
duced a bipartisan bill with our col-
league, Senator BLUMENTHAL from Con-
necticut, called the Affordable Pre-
scriptions for Patients Act. The pur-
pose of the bill is straight forward: to 
stop drug companies from gaming the 
patent system to keep their profits 
high. 
Patents, of course, are granted for 
scientific innovations in order to en-
courage more of them. What happens 
under the period of a patent is that 
whatever the item is—in this case, a 
drug—that company reserves the right 
to sell it exclusively, without any com-
petition, in order to recoup its costs 
and incentivize innovation when it 
comes to these drugs. But when compa-
nies game the system by establishing 
patent thickets—multiple patents used 
to unfairly block competition—this 
prevents new drugs, as well as com-
peting drugs at a lower price, from en-
tering the market. 
For example, the most widely pre-
scribed drug in America is called 
HUMIRA. It has more than 120 dif-
ferent patents, for no real purpose 
other than extending that period of ex-
clusivity as long as possible to con-
tinue to make money. In Europe, there 
are five competing products, but in 
America, there is only HUMIRA. That 
is a patent thicket. That is gaming the 
system, and it is hurting American 
consumers. 
I 
appreciate 
the 
support 
from 
healthcare providers and advocates and 
patients I heard from in Ft. Worth. 
They encourage us to get our work 
done sooner rather than later. 
I have come to the floor twice and 
asked unanimous consent to pass the 
bill. It was voted unanimously out of 
the Judiciary Committee. The Demo-
cratic leader blocked it both times. I 
hope he will reconsider his position. I 
am sure his constituents in New York 
would like a little bit of a break when 
it comes to prescription drug costs. I 
happen to think it has to do more with 
the upcoming election than it does the 
merits of the legislation. 
E-CIGARETTES 
Madam President, I traveled to a 
couple of other Texas cities, where I 
was able to talk to people about the 
rise of e-cigarette use, particularly 
among teens. In Corpus Christi along 
the gulf coast and in Odessa in deep 
West Texas, I met with a range of local 
officials, 
health 
professionals, 
and 
community advocates about the im-
pact of teen vaping. 
One study found that in the Permian 
Basin, in the middle of the Odessa area, 
about half of high school students used 
e-cigarettes and 25 percent of them had 
vaped in the past month. This study 
found that in schools, the average age 
of first-time e-cigarette users is just 13 
years old. E-cigarettes—even the closed 
systems, where you can’t add other in-
gredients, like the psychoactive ingre-
dient in marijuana, THC—even in the 
closed systems that are designed to de-
liver only nicotine, nicotine is an ad-
dictive drug. When children get access 
to these addictive drugs, it may well 
end up being a gateway to other use— 
whether it is tobacco or other drug 
use—later in life. It certainly encour-
ages them to remain a user of this nic-
otine delivery device. 
I have introduced legislation called 
the Preventing Online Sales of E-Ciga-
rettes to Children Act, which would 
make it difficult for children to get 
their hands on these devices, particu-
larly when they buy them over the 
internet. All it does is apply the same 
safeguards already in place for online 
purchases of tobacco—it applies that to 
e-cigarettes. Customers would have to 
verify their age at the time of deliv-
ery—a practice which, shockingly, does 
not currently exist. 
A recent survey published in the 
American Journal of Health Promotion 
found that 32 percent of underage e-cig-
arette users reported purchasing prod-
ucts online, making online sales the 
single largest source of purchases for 
underage users. We recently raised the 
age from 18 to 21 to get access to these 
e-cigarettes, but still, as these studies

indicate, use of e-cigarettes and vaping 
devices is epidemic in our middle 
schools and our high schools. It is dan-
gerous to the physical and mental 
health of our children. That is some-
thing you would think we would be 
able to address. If we are going to turn 
the tide on e-cigarettes and prevent 
more young people from facing their 
deadly health consequences, passage of 
this legislation is a necessary first 
step. 
STATE WORK PERIOD 
Madam President, when I was home 
in San Antonio, I was able to help cele-
brate the investiture of one of our new-
est Federal judges, Jason Pulliam, who 
filled the vacancy in the Western Dis-
trict of Texas. Then I got to spend a 
little time in Midland with folks and 
talk about the importance of our oil 
and gas industry and why innovation in 
that space and concern about conserva-
tion and the environment were not mu-
tually exclusive. 
At each step along the way, I was 
able to hear from countless other Tex-
ans about changes they would like to 
see coming out of Washington. They 
encouraged us to try to work together 
and avoid some of the partisan gridlock 
we have seen that characterized so 
much of the recent impeachment pro-
ceedings. It was a great week re-
charging at home. I came back ready 
to get back to work. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

The

The senior assistant legislative clerk

Mr. BOOZMAN. Madam President, I

VETERANS 
Mr. BOOZMAN. Madam President, 
the Disabled American Veterans is 
celebrating 100 years of helping mili-
tary veterans, and I rise to recognize 
this remarkable occasion. 
Throughout its history, the DAV has 
been influential in identifying ways to 
best support our veterans—from push-
ing for the consolidation of veterans 
programs, in its early years, to direct 
outreach to veterans in communities 
with the launch of the Field Service 
Unit Program, to pressing for more 
funding for VA healthcare and benefits. 
There has been so much progress in 
advancing veterans services thanks to 
the DAV’s efforts. The organization’s 
members and partners have a lot to be 
proud of. DAV members have been 
leading advocates for injured and ill 
veterans and their families, which has 
made a difference for countless wound-
ed warriors. The DAV’s advocacy has 
helped and continues to build better 
lives for disabled veterans. We are 
thankful for the more than 1 million 
DAV members and auxiliary members 
who are doing great work to ensure our 
country keeps the promise we made to 
the men and women who have served in 
uniform. 
This week, members of the DAV De-
partment of Arkansas are visiting the 
Nation’s Capital to share the organiza-
tion’s legislative priorities for 2020. 
They are part of an extensive network 
that has been influential in identifying 
how the Department of Veterans Af-
fairs can strengthen its services. They 
are among the DAV members from 
across the country who are in Wash-
ington, DC, to advocate on behalf of 
veterans. 
There is simply no substitute for 
coming to our Nation’s Capital and vis-
iting with Members of Congress to let 
them know of DAV’s priorities. These 
include strengthening veterans mental 
healthcare and suicide prevention pro-
grams, improving benefits and services 
for women veterans and ensuring vet-
erans who have been exposed to toxic 
substances receive full and timely ben-
efits. The good news is we are working 
on these priorities because we all agree 
that our veterans deserve nothing less 
than quality care and the benefits they 
have earned. 
Last month, the Senate’s Committee 
on Veterans’ Affairs advanced the Com-
mander John Scott Hannon Veterans 
Mental Health Care Improvement Act. 
This comprehensive legislation will 
strengthen our ability to provide vet-
erans with the mental healthcare they 
need. It includes language Senator 
WARNER and I authored to leverage the 
services of veteran-serving nonprofits 
and other community networks in our 
overall strategy to reduce veteran sui-
cides. 
VA Ranking Member TESTER and I 
are also working to improve services to 
our women veterans. Our Deborah 
Sampson Act legislation would elimi-
nate barriers to care and services that 
many women veterans face and would 
help to ensure the VA could address 
the needs for women, which is so crit-
ical because they are more likely to 
face homelessness, unemployment, and 
to go without needed healthcare. We 
are pleased to have the support of the 
DAV for this important legislation. 
I am proud to cosponsor the Veterans 
Burn Pit Exposure Recognition Act, 
which would allow veterans who suffer 
from the effects of burn pits to get the 
benefits and services they have earned. 
I encourage my colleagues to support 
these bills so we can provide the re-
sources that have been promised to our 
veterans. 
For years, the DAV members have 
supported the passage of the Blue 
Water Navy bill. Thanks, in part, to 
their advocacy, Congress approved this 
critical legislation last year that ex-
tends benefits to more veterans who 
were exposed to toxic chemicals during 
the Vietnam war. 
The DAV’s attention extends beyond 
the Halls of Congress. Its National 
Service Program helps to direct serv-
ices to veterans across the country. 
I applaud the efforts of the more than 
11,000 DAV members in Arkansas whose 
outreach is helping veterans to under-
stand and access their benefits. They 
have spent countless hours in advising 
fellow veterans about the assistance 
they qualify for and in helping them 
fill out the paperwork to secure those 
benefits through the VA. 
One of the well-known services pro-
vided by the DAV is the transportation 
of veterans to VA medical centers and 
hospitals. In rural States like Arkan-
sas, the services these volunteers offer 
is 
critical 
to 
meeting 
veterans’ 
healthcare needs. The Arkansas fleet is 
made up of 16 vans. Last year, more 
than 6,600 veterans were driven to med-
ical appointments with the help of vol-
unteers who logged more than 18,000 
hours behind the wheel. 
I look forward to continuing to work 
with DAV members as Congress crafts 
and reforms policies to improve serv-
ices for veterans and their families. 
This country made a promise to our 
veterans that we must live up to, and I 
am proud to join with the DAV to en-
sure we follow through on that com-
mitment. In working together, we can 
find solutions and take action to de-
liver the results veterans have earned 
and expect. We will continue looking 
to the DAV to understand how we can 
improve the lives of the men and 
women who have served in uniform. 
As a member of the Senate Com-
mittee on Veterans’ Affairs and as 
chairman of the Senate Appropriations 
subcommittee that oversees VA fund-
ing, I have seen the dedication of the 
DAV to support disabled veterans in 
Arkansas and across the country. I am 
proud to recognize the DAV on its 100 
years of engaging veterans, in its advo-
cating to advance benefits, services, 
and care, and in its making a positive 
difference in the lives of veterans and 
their families. 
REMEMBERING CHARLES PORTIS 
Madam President, on a separate sub-
ject, I also pay tribute to an Arkansas 
veteran who is one of the State’s most 
famous 
sons—literary 
icon 
Charles 
Portis. Mr. Portis, the author best 
known for his 1968 Western novel ‘‘True 
Grit,’’ passed away on February 17, 
2020. 
Born in December 1933, in El Dorado, 
AR, Portis spent his childhood in 
southern Arkansas. He enlisted in the 
Marine Corps and served as an infan-
tryman and, during the Korean war, 
reached the rank of sergeant before his 
discharge in 1955. Following his mili-
tary service, he attended the Univer-
sity of Arkansas and wrote for the stu-
dent newspaper, the Arkansas Trav-
eler. He graduated from the university 
in 1958 with a degree in journalism. 
After graduating, Portis began his 
career as a reporter. He first worked at 
the Arkansas Gazette and then at the 
New York Herald Tribune. Though he 
voluntarily ended his journalism career 
in 1964, he used the skills and tools he 
had acquired as a reporter when he re-
turned home to Arkansas to begin 
writing fiction. 
His most celebrated work is the 
Western classic ‘‘True Grit.’’ This book 
chronicles the efforts of a Yell County

teenager, Mattie Ross, along with U.S. 
Marshal Rooster Cogburn, to avenge 
the death of Mattie’s father at the 
hands of a drifter. The novel incor-
porates distinct references that are fa-
miliar to many Arkansans, and it de-
picts life on the frontier in what was 
then the wild, wild West. It was later 
adapted into film in 1969 and 2010. 
While it is his most well-known work, 
Mr. Portis also wrote four other novels 
and several shorter works of fiction 
and nonfiction. 
During his career, Portis was hon-
ored with the Oxford American’s first 
Lifetime Achievement in Southern Lit-
erature award and was presented with 
the Porter Prize’s 30th Anniversary 
Lifetime Achievement Award. ‘‘True 
Grit’’ has been praised as ‘‘one of the 
great American novels.’’ 
I take this opportunity to say how 
proud we are of Charles Portis and his 
legacy as an acclaimed writer and sto-
ryteller. My thoughts and prayers are 
with his friends and family as they re-
member and reflect on his life. I hope 
they find comfort in the fact that Mr. 
Portis has left a profound, lasting 
mark on Arkansas, as well as within 
our Nation’s culture and literary tradi-
tions. 
Charles Portis had a remarkable ca-
reer that will be remembered for a long 
time to come. I wish to honor him and 
his loved ones today and help to cele-
brate his life. On behalf of all Arkan-
sans, we celebrate Charles Portis and 
his notable contributions to our State. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Kansas. 
Mr. MORAN. Madam President, I am 
pleased to have arrived on the Senate 
floor just a bit early to have heard the 
Senator from Arkansas, Mr. BOOZMAN, 
pay tribute to the DAV, Disabled 
American Veterans, and I very much 
want to join in his comments. 
I will also take a moment to thank 
him for his continual service for vet-
erans, not only for those of Arkansas 
but of our Nation, and to recognize 
that he and I, since our days in the 
House of Representatives, have worked 
together on veterans’ issues and both 
now find ourselves in positions in the 
hopes that we can do even more. 
To Senator BOOZMAN, I say thank you 
for his continued efforts in making 
sure that all who serve our Nation have 
a better future and that the Depart-
ment of Veterans Affairs, as well as the 
American people, do everything they 
can to make sure that what they are 
entitled to they will receive. So I 
thank the Senator from Arkansas. 
TRIBUTE TO KENT CORNISH 
Madam President, I come to the floor 
to congratulate and pay tribute to a 
Kansan, Kent Cornish. He is retiring as 
the President of the Kansas Associa-
tion of Broadcasters. 
He has spent the last 40 years in the 
broadcast business and the past 12 at 
the KAB in his advocating on behalf of 
broadcasters across our State. His dedi-
cation to making certain that rural 
communities in Kansas have access to 
quality broadcasting programming is a 
testament to his commitment to rural 
America at large. I, in particular, find 
that very pleasing as we know how im-
portant broadcasting is—local broad-
casting in particular—to the future and 
well-being of the citizens of Kansas 
and, particularly, to those who live in 
our smallest communities. 
Kent is widely recognized as one of 
the most knowledgeable and effective 
advocates for broadcasting in our State 
and around the country. He has been a 
leading voice in Topeka and Wash-
ington, DC, and is someone whom I 
hold in high regard. 
Kent is a native of Topeka who dedi-
cated his life to broadcasting at an 
early age. With dreams of becoming a 
sportscaster, Kent attended the Uni-
versity of Kansas, where he earned a 
degree in journalism. He later attended 
Washburn University School of Law. 
After joining his hometown station, 
WIBW, as an intern, Kent worked his 
way up through the ranks to become a 
news reporter, anchor, and, eventually, 
an assistant news director. He also 
spent time at WDAF in Kansas City 
and later returned to WIBW. He left 
the station in 1980 and turned his at-
tention to sales. He served as executive 
director of the Kansas Manufactured 
Housing Institute, but he could not 
keep his passions in the background. 
He left that job to return to broad-
casting. 
Four 
years 
after 
leaving 
WIBW, he rejoined the station at which 
he would ultimately be named program 
director and operations manager. He 
later took over as general manager of 
KTKA, 
in Topeka, and eventually 
moved to Wichita to manage two tele-
vision stations. After having spent dec-
ades running broadcast stations that 
Kansans from all over our State have 
relied on for both local and national 
news, he became the president and ex-
ecutive director of the Kansas Associa-
tion of Broadcasters in 2008. 
Kent has had a long and successful 
career. He has earned esteemed awards, 
including the Grover Cobb Award from 
the University of Kansas. He has also 
served in numerous leadership capac-
ities, including as the former president 
of the National Alliance of State 
Broadcasters Associations and as the 
former chairman of the Greater Topeka 
Chamber of Commerce and of the To-
peka Community Foundation. 
Kent has been a powerful voice in the 
Nation’s Capital for critical Federal 
policy, all framed in the larger lens of 
improving communities’ access—peo-
ple’s access—to quality broadcasting. 
Like the rest of us from rural States 
like Kansas, Kent knows how quickly 
these communities can be forgotten 
and has always been determined to en-
sure access to local information, news, 
and weather. 
I am proud to call Kent a friend, and 
I look forward to seeing where his life 
now takes him. We meet many people 
in the business that we are in here in 
the U.S. Senate and in politics in gen-
eral. Kent is one of those whom you ap-
preciate from the first day you become 
acquainted with him. He is straight-
forward and honest and tells it like it 
is. He is there to be supportive but is 
there to provide the necessary informa-
tion for me and others to make the 
best decisions, not just on behalf of 
broadcasters but for those they serve 
in their communities. 
I add my voice to the well-deserved 
praise that he has received and will 
continue to receive. Congratulations 
and thank you to Kent for all his work. 
On behalf of Kansas broadcasters, 
you are highly regarded by them and 
their listeners. Your efforts have bene-
fited Kansans and have improved our 
Nation. You will be missed at the Kan-
sas Association of Broadcasters, but I 
have no doubt you will continue to 
make your community a better place. 
I look forward to many more years of 
friendship and working together on be-
half of Kansans, and I thank you for 
your friendship and for all you have 
done to make our State a better place. 
I yield the floor. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
BOOZMAN). The Senator from Arkansas. 
ABORTION 
Mr. COTTON. Mr. President, this 
week the Senate has another chance to 
vote on basic pro-life protections for 
babies, both born and unborn. 
This week we have another choice to 
live up to our Nation’s highest prin-
ciple—that every person has the right 
to life—or to stoop down to a narrow 
vision of humanity peddled by the 
abortion industry and its cronies. 
The first bill we are considering—the 
Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection 
Act—would prohibit abortions after 20 
weeks of pregnancy, when there is 
clear, scientific evidence that these 
young babies can feel pain in their 
mother’s womb. 
The abortion lobby and all of its de-
fenders will dispute this science, claim-
ing that babies or fetuses—which is the 
euphemism they like to use for ba-
bies—can’t feel pain at all or at least 
until the very latest stages of preg-
nancy. Anyone pedaling that myth 
must have never visited a neonatal in-
tensive care unit, or the NICU, as they 
are usually called. Ask any one of 
those NICU nurses who cares for little 
preemies, even micro-preemies, and 
they will tell you how they can hold 
that small infant sometimes even in 
the palm of their hands, and they can 
see it grimace at a poke or a prod, 
maybe even slap away a tube or a nee-
dle as they approach—just as older kids 
do, just as some grownups do. 
The undeniable fact of fetal pain in 
these young babies influences every as-
pect of how we care for the young in 
our hospitals. We swaddle them with 
only the softest fabrics because their 
little bodies are so easily stimulated. 
We give them pain medicine during 
surgery, whether they are in the womb

or outside it. But we offer no such com-
fort during abortions, even in the lat-
est stages of pregnancy, when abortion-
ists crush a baby’s skull and dis-
member it. 
Indeed, a scientific paper published 
earlier this year in the Journal of Med-
ical Ethics noted a curious fact: Abor-
tion is the only—the only—invasive 
procedure performed on unborn infants 
without pain medication. Then again, 
abortion is unusual in so many ways, 
as so few hospital procedures are de-
signed to end a life, not to save a life. 
Are we comfortable with this state of 
affairs? Are we comfortable with the 
fact that more than 11,000 abortions 
were performed after 21 weeks when, 
again, we have clear, scientific evi-
dence that these babies feel pain and 
that many of them could survive out-
side their mother’s womb? 
I would suggest the American people 
are not comfortable with this situa-
tion, and we can do something about it 
in the U.S. Senate this week. 
The second bill we are voting on, 
called the Born-Alive Abortion Sur-
vivors Protection Act, is even more 
modest but perhaps even more urgent. 
This bill would simply protect babies 
when they are born alive during an 
abortion. 
I know it is amazing to even hear 
this, but there are rare and horrible 
cases in which babies are intended to 
be aborted, yet they are born alive, and 
the doctors are under no obligation to 
provide medical care for that young 
baby with a spark of God living in its 
soul. So this bill would simply obligate 
abortionists to render lifesaving med-
ical care to a baby struggling for life 
on the operating table. It would require 
abortionists to act as those babies’ 
friends and their doctors, consistent 
with their oath—not act like the 
baby’s mortal enemy. 
Of course, the abortion lobby will tell 
you: Oh, this never occurs. All of their 
defenders in the media will say that it 
never occurs. But if you are being hon-
est, the facts are, they do occur. 
The implication here is clear. They 
simply want us to look away from this 
horror. That doesn’t mean we should, 
though, because, in fact, we do know— 
we do know—that babies can survive 
abortions. We have the numbers to 
prove it from a handful of States that 
require abortionists to confess when 
they fail to kill a baby in the mother’s 
womb and, instead, murder it on the 
operating table. 
In Florida, 11 babies were born alive 
during abortions in 2017; another 6 were 
reportedly born alive in 2018; and an-
other 2, last year. There were 19 pre-
cious little babies born alive during 
abortions in just 1 State in just 3 years. 
Other States have reported dozens 
more cases. 
Still, the abortion industry will dis-
miss these lives as a mere rounding 
error: Let’s not even focus on it. It is 
not a serious matter. 
But forgive us if most Americans see 
the matter differently. These are pre-
cious little children, made in the image 
of God and endowed by him with the 
same worth and dignity as you and me 
and all of us. 
We have a duty to these little chil-
dren. We have a duty not to look away 
from them. 
These pro-life bills are modest and 
humane. They have the strong support 
of the American people—clear majori-
ties. But the real reason we must pro-
tect these babies is not because it is 
popular but because it is right. 
Every human being is created equal 
and deserves recognition and protec-
tion under our laws. It says so right in 
the preamble to our Declaration of 
Independence. 
Our country doesn’t always live up to 
that noble principle. But right now we 
have an opportunity to live up to it 
just a little bit more, if only in just a 
few more cases—but those cases in 
which life is most vulnerable and most 
innocent. 
So I urge my colleagues to seize this 
opportunity and protect life by ac-
knowledging the humanity of these 
precious little children. We must not 
look away any longer. 
I yield the floor. 
RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
Democratic leader is recognized. 
CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, well, 
the World Health Organization has now 
reported that there are 79,000 cases of 
coronavirus across at least 30 coun-
tries, with at least 53 confirmed cases 
here in United States. 
As the virus continues to spread, the 
global economy is already beginning to 
suffer. All of the warning lights are 
flashing bright red. We are staring 
down a potential pandemic, and the ad-
ministration has no plan. We have a 
crisis of coronavirus, and President 
Trump has no plan, no urgency, no un-
derstanding of the facts or how to co-
ordinate a response. 
We 
must 
get 
a 
handle 
on 
the 
coronavirus and make sure the United 
States is fully prepared to deal with its 
potentially far-reaching consequences, 
but the Trump administration has been 
asleep at the wheel. 
President 
Trump, 
good 
morning. 
There is a pandemic of coronavirus. 
Where are you? Where is your plan? 
It is just amazing. As the crisis grows 
and grows, we hear nothing. 
Coronavirus testing kits have not 
been widely distributed to our hos-
pitals and public health labs. 
President Trump’s State Department 
overruled the recommendations of the 
scientists in the CDC and allowed in-
fected passengers from a cruise ship to 
be flown back into the United States. 
Amazingly, at a time when we know 
that these pandemics can spread, this 
administration cut the CDC—the agen-
cy in charge of fighting these global vi-
ruses—with a 16-percent senseless cut 
to its budget. 
My fellow Americans, that is what 
they do on all these things. They just 
cut, and then the President tries to 
claim credit after we restore the 
money. He did it in his State of the 
Union. He was claiming, because of his 
great work with NIH, we are curing 
cancer. He has cut the NIH every budg-
et, including this one. 
It is a disgrace how this man can say 
one thing and do another and con-
founding that it doesn’t catch up with 
him with too many Americans and 
none of my colleagues on this side of 
the aisle, and it is probably, right now, 
most dangerous and most egregious 
when it comes to coronavirus. 
It wasn’t just that the President cut 
CDC last year. It follows years of dras-
tic cuts to the global health division at 
CDC by the Trump administration. 
In 2018, CDC was forced to reduce the 
numbers of countries it operated in 
from 49 to 10. That is how bad it is. 
We have crises, and we have a world 
that is different, and this administra-
tion, instead of stepping up to the 
plate, runs away, listening to the clar-
ion call of the far right: Just cut, cut, 
cut, cut, cut, no matter how it affects 
people. 
In 2018, even worse, President Trump 
ordered the National Security Council 
to scupper its entire global health se-
curity unit and asked the Department 
of Homeland Security to do the same. 
We don’t have epidemic teams in the 
National Security Council or DHS. 
I hope and pray to God that corona 
doesn’t spread here, but if it does, we 
have been inadequately prepared be-
cause of President Trump’s lack of 
leadership, 
lack 
of 
understanding 
science, lack of ability to listen to ex-
perts and do something about them in-
stead of being concerned—it seems all 
the time—with his own ego. 
The President has not even taken the 
simple, sensible step of designating a 
single official to lead response efforts. 
In 2014, President Obama made the 
smart decision to appoint Ron Klain to 
lead an interagency response to the 
Ebola outbreak. But President Trump, 
in contrast, has hollowed out so many 
agencies that one of the key figures re-
sponding 
to 
coronavirus 
is 
Ken 
Cuccinelli, an immigrant hard-liner 
with no experience in public health. 
Unbelievable. A man totally unpre-
pared for coronavirus, an ideologue—a 
rightwing, nasty ideologue who has 
spent his career kicking around immi-
grants—is now in charge of our fight 
against coronavirus. This is after the 
President cut CDC, eliminated the 
global health security units in Home-
land Security and at the NSC, and we 
are in trouble. 
President Trump has not only failed 
to marshal a capable domestic response 
to the coronavirus; he has been slow to 
take action to confront the virus 
abroad. We all know that the best 
thing to do is to stop it from spreading 
abroad before it spreads to these 
United States. 
Of course, the President—ego above 
anything else—has been afraid to criti-
cize President Xi or the Communist

Party of China for silencing dissent 
and obscuring the truth about the 
coronavirus—where it originated. When 
China obscures the truth, it puts Amer-
icans in danger. Where is President 
Trump’s voice? 
The videos emerging from behind the 
Chinese Communist Party’s internet 
wall show Chinese people pleading— 
pleading—with the international com-
munity to expose the scope and scale of 
this epidemic. 
The response so far by the Trump ad-
ministration is exactly what happens 
when science skeptics with alternate 
facts try to run emergency response 
that 
requires 
expertise, 
planning, 
knowledge, money, cooperation, and 
science-based actions. 
But being anti-science is not just 
rhetoric. It hurts us. It hurts every 
American in many ways, and that is 
what President Trump and his adminis-
tration do, and our Republican col-
leagues just blithely go along. 
After months of tiptoeing around the 
Chinese Communist Party, after 3 
years of cutting funding for our epi-
demic response programs, President 
Trump simply has left the United 
States unprepared to confront a pos-
sible epidemic like corona. 
I will have more to say this week 
about what the administration must do 
to right the ship. 
NATIONAL DEFENSE 
Mr. President, on another front, 
again, the frustration of how this ad-
ministration has conducted itself is un-
precedented. I know some of my col-
leagues like to say that it is just like 
Obama. It isn’t even close. 
Here are some more examples, unfor-
tunately, on the trampling of the rule 
of law in this country. 
Emboldened by the refusal of Senate 
Republicans to hold him accountable in 
his 
impeachment 
trial, 
President 
Trump has been interfering with the 
Justice Department and retaliating 
against officials in his administration 
who dare testify truthfully before Con-
gress. 
In the short week that we have spent 
in recess, the President has managed to 
plunge our country even deeper into 
chaos and certainly has shown the need 
for having a trial during impeachment 
with witnesses and documents, getting 
the truth and not rubberstamping 
President Trump’s behavior. 
The President continued to purge his 
administration, firing officials who re-
fused to pledge allegiance to the Presi-
dent over their allegiance to the Con-
stitution. 
The 
President 
classified 
Bolton’s book in another blatant at-
tempt to cover up the facts. This is 
what dictatorships do—dictatorships. 
They say something is classified; they 
hide the truth. It is a disgrace. 
The President continued to abuse the 
pardon power, in one instance com-
muting the sentence of a notoriously 
corrupt former official without rhyme 
or reason. Maybe most egregious of all, 
the President, angered that the Direc-
tor of National Intelligence had the 
gall to conduct a bipartisan briefing for 
the House Intelligence Committee on 
foreign interference in our elections, 
replaced him with a political lackey— 
a yes-man as the head of DNI, where 
truth needs to be spoken probably 
more than any other place in the gov-
ernment. He has no experience in the 
intelligence community and is simply 
known as an acolyte to President 
Trump. 
With each of these actions—I hate to 
say it, but it is true; any objective per-
son will know—President Trump brings 
our Nation closer and closer and closer 
to a banana republic, a government not 
of laws but of one man, a government 
where officials are asked to swear loy-
alty not to our country or the Con-
stitution but to the President himself, 
a country where truth is obscured or 
covered up or deemed fake simply be-
cause it is not flattering to the Presi-
dent and is not what he wants to hear. 
President Trump’s decision to dis-
miss the DNI Director, the Director of 
National Intelligence, is particularly 
pernicious. Our intelligence commu-
nity is an institution that is supposed 
to report on threats to our country 
with accuracy, without regard to poli-
tics, to speak truth to power, to pro-
tect us. For the President to install a 
yes-man at the top of the intelligence 
community, to politicize a part of our 
government designed to be apolitical, 
to so debase the morale of the brave 
men and women in the CIA and the 
NSA, many of whom risk their lives for 
our safety, is a disgrace. 
There are media reports that our in-
telligence community has found that 
Putin continues to engage in activities 
to influence the outcome of our elec-
tion. That is reportedly what former 
DNI McGuire’s team was briefing Con-
gress about. 
So today, along with my Democratic 
colleagues on the Banking and Foreign 
Relations Committees, I am sending a 
letter to Secretary Pompeo and Sec-
retary Mnuchin urging them to impose 
new sanctions on Putin and his cronies 
using 
existing 
sanctions 
authority. 
They have it; they can do it. Let me re-
peat that. The Trump administration 
has broad authority to impose sanc-
tions for meddling in our elections. It 
does not need new legislative tools or 
approval. 
Our 
message 
is 
clear: 
Secretary 
Mnuchin, impose sanctions now. 
No one on the Intelligence Com-
mittee, Democrat or Republican, has 
disputed that Russia is attempting to 
interfere in our elections. Most say 
Russia has already started to do so. So 
this should be an easy, bipartisan ef-
fort. We are being attacked today in 
real time by foreign adversaries. This 
is not about party politics. It is not 
about what Trump doesn’t want to 
hear. The Russians wanted him to win 
in 2016 and in all likelihood will want 
him to win in 2020. It is about the oath 
we swear to defend our Republic. Amer-
icans—I don’t care what their party, 
what their ideology—if they start be-
lieving our elections are not on the 
level, this democracy will be in big 
trouble. 
I hope my Republican colleagues will 
join us. The administration could im-
pose 
sanctions 
tomorrow, 
and 
it 
should. A repeat performance of 2016— 
another campaign of foreign influence 
in our elections—is perhaps the great-
est threat to our democracy. The 
Founding Fathers thought so. Read 
what James Madison said. 
We demand that Secretary Pompeo 
and Secretary Mnuchin identify and 
target all those determined to be re-
sponsible for ongoing election inter-
ference. Anything less would be an ab-
dication of their responsibility, their 
sacred, solemn responsibility to pro-
tect and defend the United States from 
the serious threat to our national secu-
rity and the integrity of our electoral 
process. 
I yield the floor.

LIFESPAN RESPITE CARE 
REAUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2019 
Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise 
today to urge passage of bipartisan, 
compassionate legislation that I intro-
duced on April 2 of last year with my 
colleague 
from 
Wisconsin, 
Senator 
BALDWIN, to reauthorize the Lifespan 
Respite Care Program. This program 
provides respite services to family 
members who are caring for loved ones 
with special needs. Oftentimes, they 
are taking care of a spouse with Alz-
heimer’s disease or a child with several 
disabilities, and it is a 24/7 job. They 
need a break, they need help, and that 
is what respite service is all about. 
This is not a new program. It has 
long been a bipartisan priority, and our 
bill is widely supported by a total of 
100 leading caregiver and respite orga-
nizations across the country. 
The 
Senate 
Health, 
Education, 
Labor, and Pensions Committee re-
ported our bill unanimously on October 
31 of last year, and we have been work-
ing since then to secure its passage by 
the full Senate. It cleared the Repub-
lican side of the aisle on December 17, 
but the bill has been stalled on the 
other side of the aisle due to an un-
known objection by an anonymous 
Senator, making it very difficult to re-
solve. If you don’t know who has 
lodged the objection and you don’t 
know what the concern is, it becomes 
impossible to resolve it. Thankfully, I 
am pleased to report that the objection 
has now been lifted, and we are poised 
to pass this bill that will help our sen-
iors caring for a spouse with Alz-
heimer’s or another disease, as well as 
parents caring for children with dis-
abilities. 
Our bill would authorize $10 million 
annually for the Lifespan Respite Care 
Program over the next 5 years to assist 
States in establishing or enhancing 
statewide lifespan respite programs.

February 24, 2020 
years ago, 37 States plus the District of 
Columbia have received grants to in-
crease the availability and quality of 
respite services. Failing to reauthorize 
this program would put this funding in 
jeopardy. 
While respite care is the No. 1 service 
caregivers say they need, 85 percent of 
our Nation’s caregivers have not re-
ceived any respite services at all. Res-
pite care has been shown to help sus-
tain family caregivers’ health and well- 
being and avoid and delay out-of-home 
placement for those for whom they are 
caring. 
From families caring for children 
with disabilities to those caring for 
older adults, the need for respite care 
today continues to grow. Our bipar-
tisan legislation would help the 45 mil-
lion caregivers in our country who pro-
vide an estimated $470 billion in un-
compensated care each year. 
As a Senator representing the State 
with the oldest median age in our Na-
tion and as chairman of the Senate 
Aging Committee, the well-being of our 
seniors and their caregivers is among 
my top priorities. The need for respite 
care continues to outpace available re-
sources. This program is an attempt to 
provide a modest amount of Federal 
grant money toward this goal. 
Along with Senator BALDWIN, this bi-
partisan bill is cosponsored by Sen-
ators MURRAY, REED, and SINEMA. More 
than 50 national stakeholders have 
signed a letter urging immediate pas-
sage of the bill, including the ARCH 
National Respite Coalition, the AARP, 
Easterseals, The Arc, and the Elizabeth 
Dole Foundation. In addition, State- 
based organizations representing con-
stituents across the country have also 
signed this letter. 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-
sent to have this letter printed in the 
RECORD. 
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the 
RECORD, as follows: 
FEBRUARY 24, 2020. 
Re Lifespan Respite Care Program Reauthor-
ization Act (S. 995). 
Hon. MITCH MCCONNELL, 
Majority Leader, U.S. Senate, 
Washington, DC. 
Hon. LAMAR ALEXANDER, 
Chairman, Committee on Health, Education, 
Labor and Pensions, U.S. Senate, Wash-

DEAR LEADER MCCONNELL, LEADER SCHU-
MER, CHAIRMAN ALEXANDER, RANKING MEM-
BER MURRAY, SENATOR COLLINS, AND SENATOR 
BALDWIN: We, the undersigned national, 
state and local organizations representing 
all ages and disabilities, are writing to offer 
our support for the bipartisan Lifespan Res-
pite Care Reauthorization Act (S. 995) to re-
authorize the Lifespan Respite Care Program 
at $50 million over five years. We are very 
grateful that with your strong support, the 
bill was unanimously approved by the Senate 
Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Com-
mittee last October, and we now urge the 
Senate to take swift action to pass the bill. 
We also want to acknowledge and express 
our deep gratitude to Rep. James Langevin 
for his championing of Lifespan Respite in 
the House since 2003, when he first intro-
duced the Lifespan Respite Care Act in Con-
gress. He continued to lead the effort with 
subsequent reauthorization bills in every 
Congress since 2011. 
Every day, millions of American families 
are faced with unexpected illness, disease, or 
disability. A soldier is injured in war, a 
spouse develops multiple sclerosis or Alz-
heimer’s disease, or a child is diagnosed with 
a developmental or physical disability or 
chronic illness. These are but a few examples 
of events that can forever change an individ-
ual’s and family’s trajectory. 
While each situation is unique, the one 
thing that they often have in common is the 
incredible role family caregivers play. Forty- 
three million family caregivers provide a 
vast majority of our nation’s long-term care, 
permitting individuals of all ages to remain 
in their communities and avoid or delay 
nursing home or foster care placements. 
While the benefits of family caregiving are 
plentiful, caregiving can take its toll. Res-
pite—short-term care that offers individuals 
or family members temporary relief from the 
daily routine and stress of providing care—is 
a critical component to bolstering family 
stability and maintaining family caregiver 
health and well-being. Respite is a fre-
quently requested support service among 
family caregivers, but 85% of family care-
givers of adults receive no respite and the 
percentage is similar for parents caring for 
their children with special needs. 
The 
Lifespan 
Respite 
Care 
Program, 
though competitive grants to states to es-
tablish or enhance statewide Lifespan Res-
pite systems, work to maximize existing re-
sources and help ensure that quality respite 
is available and accessible to all family care-
givers. With more than half of care recipi-
ents under age 75 and more than one-third 
under age 50, Lifespan Respite rightly recog-
nizes caregiving as a lifespan issue and 
serves families regardless of age or dis-
ability. 
Though the program has been drastically 
underfunded since its inception, thirty-seven 
states and the District of Columbia have re-
ceived grants and are engaged in impressive 
work such as identifying and coordinating 
respite services available through various 
state agencies, including veterans caregiver 
services; helping unserved families pay for 
respite through participant-directed voucher 
programs; addressing the workforce shortage 
by recruiting and training respite workers 
and volunteers; and building capacity by 
awarding mini-grants to community and 
faith-based agencies for new services; and 
raising awareness about respite through pub-
lic education campaigns. Enactment of the 
Lifespan Respite Care Reauthorization Act is 
necessary to continue this excellent momen-
tum, better coordinate and supply respite 
care to our nation’s 43 million family care-
givers through statewide Lifespan Respite 
programs and ensure that states are able to 
sustain the great work they have begun and 
still allow new states to receive a grant. 
We thank you for your commitment to in-
dividuals living with disabilities, older indi-
viduals in need of assistance and support, 
and the loved ones who care for them and we 
look forward to continuing to work with you 
as the bill moves forward. If you would like

Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I have 
shared how important it is that we pass 
this legislation, the Lifespan Respite 
Care Reauthorization Act of 2019, with-
out further delay, and I urge my col-
leagues to support the bill. 
Mr. President, as if in legislative ses-
sion, I ask unanimous consent that the 
Senate proceed to the immediate con-
sideration of Calendar No. 283, S. 995. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will report the bill by title. 
The legislative clerk read as follows: 
A bill (S. 995) to amend title XXIX of the 
Public Health Service Act to reauthorize the 
program under such title relating to lifespan 
respite care. 
There being no objection, the Senate 
proceeded to consider the bill, which 
had been reported from the Committee 
on Health, Education, Labor, and Pen-
sions, with an amendment to strike all 
after the enacting clause and insert in 
lieu thereof the following: 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Lifespan Res-
pite Care Reauthorization Act of 2019’’. 
SEC. 2. REAUTHORIZATION OF LIFESPAN RES-
PITE CARE PROGRAM. 
(a) DATA COLLECTION AND REPORTING.—Sec-
tion 2904 of the Public Health Service Act (42 
U.S.C. 300ii–3) is amended to read as follows: 
‘‘SEC. 2904. DATA COLLECTION AND REPORTING. 
‘‘(a) IN GENERAL.—Each State agency award-
ed a grant or cooperative agreement under sec-
tion 2902 shall report such data, information, 
and metrics as the Secretary may require for 
purposes of— 
‘‘(1) evaluating State programs and activities 
funded pursuant to such grant or cooperative 
agreement, including any results pursuant to 
section 2902(d)(2)(B)(xii); and 
‘‘(2) identifying effective programs and activi-
ties funded pursuant to section 2902. 
‘‘(b) REPORT.—Not later than October 1, 2023, 
the Secretary shall submit a report to the Com-
mittee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pen-
sions of the Senate and the Committee on En-
ergy and Commerce of the House of Representa-
tives regarding the outcomes of the programs 
and activities funded pursuant to section 2902, 
including any effective programs and activities 
identified.’’. 
(b) FUNDING.—Section 2905 of the Public 
Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 300ii–4) is amend-
ed by striking ‘‘title’’ and all that follows 
through 
the 
period 
and 
inserting 
‘‘title, 
$10,000,000 for each of fiscal years 2020 through 
fiscal year 2024.’’. 
Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the com-
mittee-reported substitute amendment 
be agreed to and that the bill, as 
amended, be considered read a third 
time. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
Without objection, it is so ordered. 
The committee-reported amendment, 
in the nature of a substitute, was 
agreed to. 
The bill, as amended, was ordered to 
be engrossed for a third reading and 
was read the third time. 
Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I know 
of no further debate on the bill, as 
amended. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
further debate? 
If not, the question is, Shall the bill 
pass? 
The bill (S. 995), as amended, was 
passed. 
Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the motion to 
reconsider be considered made and laid 
upon the table. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered.

EXECUTIVE CALENDAR—Continued 
Ms. COLLINS. Thank you, Mr. Presi-
dent. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Oregon. 
Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, we are 
running a little bit behind, so I would 
ask unanimous consent to speak for up 
to 10 minutes, which reflects the 
amount of time we are running behind. 
I ask unanimous consent to speak for 
up to 10 minutes. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
WOMEN’S HEALTHCARE 
Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, this 
week, the Senate is having yet another 
debate 
on 
legislation 
to 
restrict 
healthcare for women, and I am going 
to take just a few minutes to talk 
about what this debate is really all 
about. 
The old Republican slogan was ‘‘a 
chicken in every pot.’’ The new Repub-
lican slogan is ‘‘a Republican in every 
examining room.’’ 
The Senate has done remarkably lit-
tle legislating while under the recent 
control of the other party, but some-
how, some way, there always seems to 
be time to have an attack on women’s 
healthcare. It has come up again and 
again, and it is always the same basic 
proposition on offer: Republican politi-
cians trying to somehow squeeze them-
selves in between women and their 
physicians. 
My view is that the government 
ought to make sure that women can 
get healthcare from the doctors they 
trust and that politicians ought to stay 
out of things. Roe v. Wade says that is 
supposed to be the law of the land when 
it comes to access to abortion. More 
than four decades of settled law says 
that these are choices to be made by 
women and their doctors, and the ideo-
logical agendas of politicians ought to 
have nothing to do with it. The legisla-
tion up for debate this week, based on 
yet another far-right cause, says the 
opposite. Amongst other problems, one 
of the proposals on offer this week 
would actually criminalize the practice 
of intensely personal healthcare. It 
would essentially say to doctors: Just 
throw out your training. Throw it 
away. Discard your medical judgment, 
and forget what is in the patient’s best 
interest. 
Rightwing politicians are going to 
call the shots in the exam room. Doc-
tors who provide necessary medical 
treatment and care that can be life-
saving could be thrown in jail if they 
run afoul of these new ideological gov-
ernment standards. 
Now, this isn’t a debate just here in 
the Senate. There have been hundreds 
of bills brought forward in States 
across the country restricting women’s 
healthcare, including safe and legal 
abortion. Among the people hit hardest 
by these proposals are the millions of 
women in this country who are every 
single day walking an economic tight-
rope. If they can’t see the doctor they 
trust and if their local Planned Parent-
hood clinic is forced to shutter its 
doors because of these harsh new rules, 
they may not have anywhere else to 
turn to for vital healthcare. It is an-
other way in which the far right and 
the Republican agenda supporting it 
goes back to the days when healthcare 
was really just for the healthy and the 
wealthy. 
Bottom line: This debate is fun-
damentally about whether the govern-
ment gets to control women’s bodies. It 
is a dangerous, in my view, unconstitu-
tional proposition that just throws in 
the garbage can decades of settled law. 
This Republican majority has proved 
that we can always find time here in 
the 
Senate 
to 
go 
after 
women’s 
healthcare with ideological bills, re-
gardless of what other healthcare chal-
lenges Americans are facing at home. 
I guarantee that across this country 
right now there are persons lined up at

pharmacy counters with every last 
penny they have who know they are 
about to get mugged when it comes to 
paying for the cost of prescription med-
icine. Millions of Americans struggle 
to pay for their medications, but the 
majority 
leader 
of 
this 
body 
has 
blocked our best efforts to give them a 
hand. Instead, the Senate is debating 
yet another ideological attack on wom-
en’s healthcare that really has no 
chance of becoming law. 
The likelihood is these attacks, in 
my view, based on what we know, are 
going to keep coming. It will only get 
more serious in the months ahead. 
Four more years of Donald Trump 
would mean the end of Roe v. Wade. It 
would guarantee more healthcare dis-
crimination against women, and it 
would mean a whole lot more govern-
ment control over women’s bodies. 
Again and again, we would see the gov-
ernment in the exam room. I urge my 
colleagues to reject these proposals 
when they come up. 
I yield the floor. 
CLOTURE MOTION 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Pursuant 
to rule XXII, the Chair lays before the 
Senate the pending cloture motion, 
which the clerk will state. 
The legislative clerk read as follows: 
CLOTURE MOTION 
We, the undersigned Senators, in accord-
ance with the provisions of rule XXII of the 
Standing Rules of the Senate, do hereby 
move to bring to a close debate on the nomi-
nation of Robert Anthony Molloy, of the Vir-
gin Islands, to be Judge for the District

The PRESIDING OFFICER. By unan-
imous consent, the mandatory quorum

The question is, Is it the sense of the 
Senate that debate on the nomination 
of Robert Anthony Molloy, of the Vir-

Court of the Virgin Islands for a term 
of ten years, shall be brought to a 
close? 
The yeas and nays are mandatory

ABORTION 
Mr. CRUZ. Mr. President, I rise today 
for every child who has been denied the 
chance to live; the little boys and the 
little girls who never got the chance to 
breathe a breath of air, to live life; 
never got the chance to grow up to be 
athletes, doctors, poets, or inventors; 
never got the chance to live their own 
unique lives. 
This year marks the 47th tragic anni-
versary of Roe v. Wade, the Supreme 
Court decision that forced on all 50 
States abortion on demand and has 
tragically led to the loss of life of over 
60 million unborn children. Since that 
decision, so much life has been lost. So 
many unborn and even newborn babies 
have suffered. 
In recent years, we have seen the 
Democratic Party not listening to the 
concerns of a great many people of 
good will on both sides of the party 
but, rather, radicalize. We have seen 
leading contenders for the Presidential 
nomination in the Democratic field de-
clare that pro-life Democrats are no 
longer welcome in the party. We have 
seen far too many Democrats embrace 
extreme positions on abortion—abor-
tion up until the moment of birth and 
even, horrifically, after that. 
I think the radicalization of today’s 
Democratic Party was made crystal 
clear for a great many Americans with 
the radio interview that Virginia Gov-
ernor Ralph Northam did on January 30 
of last year. In that interview, Gov-
ernor Northam was speaking in favor 
of a bill that would allow abortion 
when a mother was already in labor. 
Stop and think about this for a mo-
ment. There have been debates about 
abortion for a long, long time. A moth-
er in labor, in the process of delivering 
a child, this bill would allow a doctor 
to kill that child instead of delivering 
the child in the midst of labor. For a 
great many people, even Americans 
who identify as pro-choice, the idea of 
killing a child while the mother is in 
labor delivering the infant is horrifying 
beyond words. But Governor Northam 
didn’t end there. He wasn’t content 
simply 
with 
saying 
that 
abortion 
should be allowed even in the midst of 
birth. He went further. He said on that 
radio interview: 
The infant would be delivered. The infant 
would be kept comfortable. The infant would 
be resuscitated if that’s what the mother and 
the family desired. And then a discussion 
would ensue between the physicians and the 
mother. 
Now, so nobody is lost on what Gov-
ernor Northam was saying, he was de-
scribing 
something 
that 
has 
euphemistically been called post-birth 
abortion. He was describing his view of 
the right way to approach delivering a 
child, which is a child who is delivered, 
who is outside the womb, who is 
breathing and crying and living. That 
is an infant. And Governor Northam 
calmly, with virtually no emotion 
whatsoever, described comforting that 
infant and then having a conversation 
about whether to deny that child the 
necessary care to live or simply to cal-
lously let a newborn infant die. 
For virtually every American, that is 
a concept that is so extreme, that is so 
radical, 
that—other 
than 
elected 
Democrats who have decided to em-
brace a radical view of abortion in all 
circumstances—almost 
every 
other 
American would be, rightly, horrified 
by the notion of a doctor allowing a 
newborn infant outside the womb to 
die. That was Governor Northam’s po-
sition. 
Well, tomorrow the Senate has an op-
portunity to speak out against those 
extreme, radical positions, to say this 
isn’t OK, to draw a line, to find what 
should be some degree of common 
ground. We are going to be voting on 
two bills in the Senate tomorrow: the 
Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protec-
tion Act and the Pain-Capable Unborn 
Child Protection Act. 
I am proud to be an original cospon-
sor of both pieces of legislation. Those 
are both commonsense pieces of legis-
lation that would work to restore fun-
damental rights for the unborn and for 
newborn babies. They are simple pieces 
of legislation. 
The Born-Alive Abortion Survivors 
Protection Act requires doctors to pro-
vide medical care to infants who sur-
vive attempted abortion procedures. It

would help make sure that, when an in-
fant has already been born, when the 
infant is alive, is breathing, is crying, 
is outside the womb, that that child re-
ceives the medical attention he or she 
needs. 
The second bill is the Pain-Capable 
Unborn Child Protection Act that 
would ban late-term abortions that re-
sult in pain and suffering and agony for 
an unborn child. 
What you will not hear from congres-
sional 
Democrats 
is 
that 
after 
5 
months, an unborn child’s toes and 
eyelids and fingers and eyelashes have 
already formed. He or she has a heart-
beat and can feel pain, and science con-
firms this. We know that these late- 
term abortions, embraced by more and 
more radical partisans, produce pain 
and suffering and agony. We should not 
be a part of allowing the deliberate in-
fliction of pain on a little girl or a lit-
tle boy. 
These two proposals, in any sane and 
rational world, would be agreed to 
unanimously. If you look at the last 3 
years, we have seen enormous victories 
when it has come to defending life, 
when it has come to confirming 192 new 
Federal judges committed to following 
the law in the Constitution; when it 
has come to restricting taxpayer fund-
ing of Planned Parenthood, the largest 
provider of abortions in this country; 
when it has come to defending the reli-
gious liberties of Americans all across 
this country, including the Little Sis-
ters of the Poor. We are making major 
steps in the right direction, but we can 
go further. We can agree on these com-
monsense provisions. We can also test 
whether Senate Democrats agree with 
their colleagues running for President, 
whether Senate Democrats agree with 
the chairman of the Democratic Na-
tional Committee, who has said: If you 
are a pro-life Democrat, get out of the 
party; you are not welcome. 
I can tell you in Texas, I certainly 
welcome pro-life Democrats to speak 
up for their values and defend their 
values, and we should come together 
behind commonsense propositions that 
say we should not be committing pro-
cedures that result in pain and agony 
and 
suffering, 
that 
science 
dem-
onstrates causes that suffering, and we 
should not be allowing newborn infants 
to die because medical care is denied to 
those children. 
This should bring us together. I urge 
our colleagues on both sides of the 
aisle to stand together for life—every 
life, as a precious, unique gift from 
God. Every life, whether the child has 
a disability, whether the child is val-
ued or not, that child should be valued, 
should be protected because that child 
is precious. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Washington. 
WOMEN’S HEALTHCARE 
Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, it 
must be a day that ends in ‘‘Y’’ be-
cause, once again, Republican Senators 
are pushing for backward, ideological 
bills to restrict a women’s constitu-
tional right to abortion. Once again, 
Republicans are peddling a ban that is 
blatantly 
unconstitutional. 
Once 
again, they are pretending we don’t al-
ready have laws on the books that pro-
tect infants and are using that as a 
pretext to drum up fear and misunder-
standing about one of the most heart-
breaking situations a family can face, 
and are pushing for anti-doctor, anti- 
women, anti-family legislation. 
Once again, I am here on behalf of 
women and men across the country to 
deliver the same message we have al-
ready made clear countless times: not 
on our watch. Majority Leader MITCH 
MCCONNELL has indicated he wants to 
pivot to legislating, which makes these 
two 
atrocious 
bills 
an 
interesting 
choice because all 100 Senators know 
they are going absolutely nowhere. The 
truth is, Republicans’ charade today is 
not actually about passing laws any 
more than it is about people’s health or 
medical science or what is best for pa-
tients. It is really about Republicans’ 
crass political calculation that they 
can fire up their far-right base with an 
all-out 
war 
against 
the 
constitu-
tionally protected right to safe, legal 
abortion. 
The two bills differ in some signifi-
cant ways, but they have the same con-
sequences. They would criminalize— 
criminalize—abortion, take deeply per-
sonal, often painful decisions out of the 
hands of parents and use scare tactics 
and misinformation to try to weaken 
strong public support for Roe. 
Another thing they have in common? 
They have already been panned by 
leading medical groups. The American 
College of Obstetricians and Gyne-
cologists has called one of these bills 
‘‘an unconstitutional attempt to in-
timidate health care providers and pre-
vent them from providing the safe care 
their patients want and need.’’ And 
they have said the other is ‘‘a gross 
legislative interference into the prac-
tice of medicine.’’ 
It is not just medical experts. Fami-
lies across the country have actually 
faced these decisions, have spoken out 
to make clear politicians should have 
no part in them. Pressing for these 
awful bills year after year may be 
nothing more than a cynical political 
tactic for Republicans, but passing 
them would be an unconscionable exer-
cise in cruelty to the people who would 
actually be affected: 
People like Judy, who is from my 
home 
State 
of 
Washington. 
Judy 
learned over 20 weeks into her preg-
nancy that her son’s organs were not 
developing properly. One lung was 20 
percent formed. The other was missing 
entirely. 
People like Kate, whose doctor in-
formed her that if her daughter sur-
vived birth, she would not be able to 
walk, talk, or swallow and likely would 
not even be comfortable enough to 
sleep. 
People like Lindsay, who learned her 
daughter had a fast-growing, inoper-
able tumor growing into her brain and 
heart and lungs, wrapping around her 
neck and eyes and chest, and making 
her odds of survival incredibly slim. 
People like Darla, who was pregnant 
with twins when she got the unthink-
able news that one of her twins had se-
rious medical complications. Not ter-
minating that pregnancy could put her 
other twin’s healthcare at risk. 
Those are just a few of many stories. 
There are more families across the 
country who have struggled with the 
painful reality that the child they have 
hoped for cannot survive. Each of them 
has spoken out to underscore that in 
those wrenching moments, they want-
ed to make the decision that was best 
for their child and their family, with 
their healthcare provider. But each of 
these bills would take the ability to 
make the decision best for that child 
and family away from women like 
Judy, Kate, Lindsay, and Darla. Those 
bills would prevent doctors from offer-
ing the best medical advice, all because 
extreme politicians are more concerned 
with spreading misinformation and fir-
ing up their base than they are with 
actual women’s lives. In other words, 
in the most private moments of per-
sonal tragedy, these bills would take 
precedence over a family’s wishes as 
they grieve. 
To the politicians supporting these 
bills, I have to ask: How dare you think 
your opinion is more important here 
than the knowledge of medical experts 
and the wishes of the family who is af-
fected? 
I don’t understand how anyone can 
think, instead of letting patients make 
their own very personal decisions, that 
they should have that decision made 
for them by President Trump and Vice 
President PENCE. That is exactly what 
we are talking about today. Why? Even 
though Roe v. Wade has been the law of 
the land for almost a half a century, 
even though a large majority of people 
do not want to see that landmark deci-
sion overturned, Republicans think 
somehow they can benefit politically 
and fire up the most ideological ele-
ments of their base by using every tool 
imaginable to chip away at the right to 
safe—safe—legal abortion. 
I am here to say they can try, but 
women, medical experts, and those of 
us elected officials who trust them are 
not going to stop calling these bills 
what they are: anti-women, anti-doc-
tor, and anti-family. We are going to 
make clear we oppose every single one 
of their efforts to further chip away at 
access to safe, legal abortion under 
Roe: every extreme, cruel abortion ban, 
every fearmongering effort to gin up 
controversy and pretend we don’t al-
ready protect infants, every far-right 
judge they try to pack onto the courts 
to chip away at Roe v. Wade, every bar-
rier to care and information like Presi-
dent Trump’s title X gag rule, and 
every new shameful scheme they con-
coct in their all-out war on access to 
reproductive healthcare.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1108 
February 24, 2020 
Whatever 
Republicans 
try 
next, 
Democrats are going to continue fight-
ing alongside women and men across 
the country to protect their ability to 
make their own decisions about their 
own families, continue standing up for 
doctors’ ability to practice medicine 
without politicians getting in the way, 
and lifting up the stories of real people, 
like Judy and Kate and Lindsey, Darla, 
and many others—so Republicans can’t 
ignore them. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from New Hampshire. 
Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, I am 
really disappointed to feel like I need 
to come to the floor today to respond 
to these anti-women, anti-family bills 
that have been introduced. Not only 
would these bills interfere with a wom-
an’s ability to make her own reproduc-
tive choices, they would threaten doc-
tors with prison time if they perform 
abortion services that women have a 
constitutional right to receive. 
These bills are dangerous, extreme, 
and they are part of an ongoing effort 
by this administration to overturn Roe 
v. Wade. We don’t need this legislation 
to prevent the killing of infants. 
Let’s be very clear. Infanticide is al-
ready illegal under Federal law. In 
fact, prosecutions have occurred under 
the current law that prevents infan-
ticide. This legislation would do noth-
ing but set up ambiguous standards for 
cases that are often medical emer-
gencies and add uncertainty to laws 
that are already on the books to pro-
hibit infanticide. 
This uncertainty will have a chilling 
effect on the ability of women to access 
the services they need in the United 
States. The legislation we are voting 
on would also imprison doctors for up 
to 5 years for performing abortions 
after a woman is 20 weeks pregnant, 
even 
though—even 
though 
Federal 
courts have ruled that this 20-week 
abortion ban, as is proposed under one 
of these bills, would violate the Con-
stitution. 
The 20-week abortion ban bill would 
only allow for exceptions for minors 
who are victims of rape or incest if 
those young women report that rape or 
incest to the police. For adult women, 
the rape exception would only apply if 
she waits 48 hours and gets counseling 
from a healthcare provider that her 
government—not that she or her fam-
ily but the government—determines is 
acceptable. 
These exceptions are just shameful 
because my colleagues know, as I do, 
that almost three-quarters of rape and 
sexual assaults are never reported, 
often because women have legitimate 
fears of being victimized again. They 
fear the rapist or the person who has 
assaulted them. 
More broadly, it is really this simple: 
We should not be putting doctors in 
prison for providing a woman with the 
reproductive care she chooses. We must 
always remember that abortions that 
are performed later in pregnancy are 
almost always done as a result of se-
vere fetal diagnoses and the serious 
risk that the pregnancy poses to the 
life of the woman. 
This isn’t a decision that any woman 
or family wants to be in a position to 
make. It is tragic, and it is heart-
breaking. The fact that these bills 
would demean the women who have to 
make these decisions by suggesting 
that this is something that govern-
ment should decide for them instead of 
the woman with her family and with 
her doctor is nothing but tragic. I don’t 
understand how people can think the 
government is better positioned to 
make these personal decisions than 
women and families and their doctors. 
Protecting 
pregnant 
women, 
new 
mothers, and children is about more 
than scoring political points with anti- 
choice legislation. It is about ensuring 
that women have access to maternity 
care. That means prenatal care. It 
means having access to affordable 
healthcare coverage. That is why this 
legislation rings so hollow. People who 
are speaking on the floor who are sup-
porting these bills are not talking 
about improving the lives of women 
and children. 
Right now, this administration is in 
court, backing a lawsuit that would 
tear down the Affordable Care Act de-
spite the fact that there is no alter-
native if the ACA is struck down. If the 
administration and States succeed in 
striking down the Affordable Care Act, 
we are going to go back to the days 
when insurance companies can exclude 
maternity care from coverage and 
when women can be charged higher 
premiums than men. If they succeed, 
the Medicaid expansion would be gone, 
and States would have fewer dollars to 
cover more people at a time when 43 
percent of childbirths in this country 
are covered and paid for by Medicaid. 
These are the fundamental issues 
that are at stake for women and fami-
lies across this country. Given these 
stakes, I am disappointed that here we 
are again, debating two anti-choice 
bills that the Senate already rejected 
in 2018 and 2019. Nothing has changed 
since then. This is time that is being 
used, as the Senator from Washington 
said, just to try and stir up the base of 
some of the Senators who are in this 
Chamber. 
If my colleagues were serious about 
protecting mothers and children, they 
would join in supporting efforts to en-
sure that the healthcare coverage that 
families rely on isn’t ripped away in 
court. I urge my colleagues to oppose 
these bills and to vote no when they 
are considered on the floor. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from New Jersey. 
RUSSIA 
Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I 
come to the floor today with a sense of 
urgency. Our next national election is 
a little more than 8 months away. We 
know from public reporting that Rus-
sia is back to its 2016 playbook and 
working to interfere again. What some 
called a political Pearl Harbor in 2016 
is in the process of happening again. It 
is happening to us again. 
I notice that every Member of the 
Senate has Washington’s Farewell Ad-
dress. It is an annual ritual in which 
that address is read by Members. It is 
interesting, in the introduction, that 
one of the things Washington warned 
about is interference by foreign powers 
in 
the 
Nation’s 
domestic 
affairs; 
George Washington, President, one of 
the Founders of our country, wrote 
back then about the interference of for-
eign powers in our domestic affairs. 
This isn’t about the Kremlin helping 
Donald Trump, although we know that 
was their preference the last time. But 
it has become increasingly clear that 
at least at this point, chaos is the true 
goal. We haven’t seen anything that 
may have changed what their pref-
erence was 4 years ago. Nothing that 
the President has done should be a rea-
son for them not to want to see him be 
reelected 
again. 
But 
regardless 
of 
whether that is or is not the case, 
chaos is part of their goal. Rendering 
our democracy incapable of standing 
up to bullies abroad is their goal. 
What is this administration’s re-
sponse? Is it paralysis? No, it is any-
thing but. This administration now ap-
pears to be engaged in a proactive 
strategy to deny this body access to in-
formation on this interference. With 
the appointment of Ric Grenell to 
serve as Acting Director of National 
Intelligence, 
the 
administration 
is 
sending a clear message to the Amer-
ican people, to the Congress, and to 
governments around the world that our 
intelligence services are now political 
commodities to be manipulated and 
used to gain electoral advantage. Amid 
all of the oversight challenges we face 
with this administration, we will likely 
look back on this decision as perhaps 
one of the most consequential and 
most damaging to our democratic in-
stitutions, and that is saying a lot 
about this White House. 
These reports of Russian interference 
do not come as a surprise. They should 
not find us flatfooted. Several of us 
have introduced sanctions legislation 
that would deter such Russian behavior 
from happening. The DASKA bill that I 
introduced with Senator GRAHAM had 
broad bipartisan support and passed 
out of the Senate Foreign Relations 
Committee with a strong bipartisan 
vote and is waiting on the Senate floor 
for action. 
What are we waiting for? The elec-
tion is 8 months away. What are we 
waiting for? We are waiting for respon-
sible Senators to defend our democ-
racy, waiting for a vote. Yet it sits 
here, and it is an outrage. 
Inaction at this very precarious stage 
in our democratic story violates the 
very oath that Members swore to up-
hold upon their election. Inaction by 
this body at this time is truly unimagi-
nable. Yet here we are with this lack of 
will to stand up for our national secu-
rity, this lack of will to defend our

democratic institutions, this lack of 
will to fulfill the oath to our country. 
History will not judge well the Senate 
in this hour. 
Only Americans should decide Amer-
ican elections—no one else, no foreign 
power, no foreign player, no foreign in-
dividual. Only Americans should decide 
American elections. I think that is a 
pretty simple proposition, but it is a 
powerful one. 
Our legislation and others are not 
the only tools available to the Presi-
dent. If he decided to stand up for our 
democratic 
institutions, 
existing 
CAATSA legislation includes several 
sanction mandates already on the 
books that could be used. Obama and 
Trump era Executive orders are sitting 
on the shelf, gathering dust. Both 
could be employed right this minute to 
impose crippling sanctions on Russia 
to send a clear message: Do not mess 
with our elections or there are serious 
consequences. 
But what is the message from this 
White House in response to public re-
porting that Russia is again inter-
fering? Is it following the laws that 
Congress has passed, full implementa-
tion of CAATSA, crippling sanctions on 
the Kremlin, full activation of all the 
powers involved and Executive orders? 
No, no. Instead, the President decided 
to fire the guy who delivered the news 
to Congress and replace him with a po-
litical sycophant. This would be like 
FDR dismissing the congressional dec-
laration of war after Pearl Harbor and 
firing members of his staff who re-
ported on the Japanese attack. It is 
pretty astounding. 
Never before have we had a President 
so transparently willing to bow down 
to a foreign foe, unwilling to challenge 
in the collective national interest and 
security of the United States, in the 
collective democracy of our country. 
The core of our democracy is citizen 
participation in casting a vote to de-
cide who governs them, from the Presi-
dent to the Congress, to local States 
and mayors. When that is eroded by 
the engagement of a foreign govern-
ment—a foreign government that is ne-
farious in its activities and consequen-
tial in its actions—it undermines the 
very essence of our democracy. 
I don’t care who they are helping. 
They are supposedly helping, according 
to the press reports, Senator SANDERS 
as well. That is wrong. I don’t want 
them helping anybody in our country. I 
don’t want them engaged on behalf of 
anyone in our country. 
Never before have I seen a President 
unwilling to challenge Putin and Rus-
sia. Never before have I seen a Presi-
dent so willing to sacrifice national se-
curity for his own political gain. And 
every single Member in this body who 
does not stand up and hold him to ac-
count and try to make sure that we 
pass legislation and challenge the 
President to ultimately sign it and 
enact it and to pursue the law as it is 
already on the books in terms of 
CAATSA, to pursue the Executive 
order powers that exist today—which 
would send an incredibly powerful mes-
sage if invoked—is complicit. We will 
have to bear the judgment of history. I 
expect the judgment will be rather 
harsh. 
For myself, I am going to do every-
thing possible to ensure that our elec-
tions are sacrosanct and that they do 
not have the interference of a foreign 
power. I do not want to be among those 
whom history is going to judge very 
harshly for being silent in the face of 
an invasion of information and efforts 
to undermine our elections. In any 
other context, we would consider it a 
war. I consider it no less. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

LIVAN). The clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll.

Mr. DAINES. Mr. President, I ask

loquy with my Senate colleagues. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
ABORTION 
Mr. DAINES. Mr. President, we are 
here today to discuss two pieces of leg-
islation that will be voted on tomorrow 
in the U.S. Senate. These two impor-
tant bills address the issue of life, a 
most basic human right—the Pain-Ca-
pable Unborn Child Protection Act and 
the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Pro-
tection Act. 
This first bill, the Pain-Capable Un-
born Child Protection Act, would end 
the barbaric practice of late-term abor-
tions after 5 months. It is a time, in 
fact, that the science tells us that ba-
bies feel pain. 
The second bill, the Born-Alive Abor-
tion Survivors Protection Act, will 
protect babies who are born alive after 
surviving botched abortions. 
These 
back-to-back 
votes 
will 
present an opportunity for every Sen-
ator and, more specifically, for nearly 
every one of the Senate Democrats to 
show the American people whether 
they believe there are any—any—limits 
to radical abortion practices. 
I am joined this evening by several of 
my esteemed Senate colleagues and 
good friends: Senator ERNST of Iowa, 
Senator SASSE of Nebraska, and Sen-
ator BRAUN of Indiana. These folks, 
like me, know how important it is that 
we protect the sanctity of life and put 
an end to the cruel practice of late- 
term abortions and the horrific act of 
infanticide. 
I founded the Senate Pro-Life Caucus 
last year because I believe the U.S. 
Senate needed to take bolder action to 
protect human life. 
In fact, at the State of the Union Ad-
dress, President Trump invited Ellie 
Schneider and her mother, from Mis-
souri, as his guests. Ellie’s mother 
stood proudly as the President shared 
their story and the miracle it was that 
Ellie was with us that night, healthy 
and thriving. 
You see, Ellie was born at 21 weeks 
and 6 days. In fact, she is one of the 
youngest premature babies to survive 
in the United States. Despite the odds 
being stacked against her, Ellie was 
given a chance at life. Thanks to the 
grace of God, she is alive and she is 
healthy today. 
Ellie’s story and the stories of so 
many others like her underscore how 
important it is that we put an end to 
this very cruel practice of late-term 
abortion. It is heartbreaking to know 
that here in America—in the United 
States of America—nearly 12,000 chil-
dren a year are lost to late-term abor-
tions. 
At 20 weeks, science tells us, these 
babies can suck their thumbs. They 
can feel pain. They can yawn. They can 
stretch. They can make faces. 
In fact, if you have a smartphone, if 
you are watching tonight, just Google 
20weekbaby—2–0–W-E-E-K-B-A-B-Y. 
Here is one of the images that will 
show up on your smartphone. That is 
what a 20-week baby looks like. 
It is unconscionable that preborn ba-
bies, after 5 months of pregnancy, can 
be killed, even though they are capable 
of feeling pain. 
In fact, during this age, preborn ba-
bies are oftentimes given anesthesia if 
there is fetal surgery involved. 
Now, here is one of the shocking sta-
tistics. The United States is only one 
of 
seven—seven—countries 
in 
the 
world, which include North Korea and 
China, that allow these barbaric late- 
term abortions after 20 weeks. That is 
a list we don’t want to be on, but we 
are. As Americans, we must strive for 
better. This isn’t political. This is 
about working to ensure that every 
single child has a chance at life. 
The Pain-Capable Unborn Child Pro-
tection Act is a commonsense bill and 
has overwhelming public support. Do 
you realize public attitude and opinion 
on abortion and late-term abortion 
keeps swinging in the pro-life direc-
tion? Why is that? 
Well, perhaps one reason is because 
technology has gotten so much better, 
and 3D ultrasounds give us such a clear 
picture of what is happening there in 
the womb. 
Look at this picture right here. The 
images are very clear. I believe in a 
principle that people believe what they 
discover for themselves. Technology is 
helping young people see that what we 
are talking about here is a baby. It is 
life. 
Sixty-two percent of voters oppose 
late-term abortion. This bill is some-
thing that I firmly believe every Re-
publican and every Democrat can get 
behind. Why can’t we at least come to-
gether on late-term abortion and ban-
ning it? Passing this bill would be a 
major step forward for the pro-life 
cause. 
The next bill we are voting on tomor-
row is the Born-Alive Abortion Sur-
vivors Protection Act.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1110 
February 24, 2020 
Back home in Montana, this piece of 
legislation moved through our State 
legislature up to our Governor’s desk. 
It was called the ‘‘Baby Born Alive’’ 
bill. It is the same thing. It mandates 
that if a baby is born alive following a 
botched abortion, the doctor must pro-
tect that baby and give the same med-
ical care that any other baby would re-
ceive. 
Is that really too much to ask for? 
Honestly, the fact that we are having 
this debate on the floor of the U.S. 
Senate is astonishing. The American 
people agree. In fact, 77 percent of pro- 
abortion advocates believe that babies 
born alive should be medically pro-
tected. 
Sadly, today there are States that do 
not offer protections for babies born 
alive. In fact, just earlier this month, 
in Colorado, State legislators killed a 
bill that would grant legal protections 
for babies born alive after abortions. 
I would like to turn to my colleague 
from Iowa, Senator JONI ERNST. She 
has been an unwavering, relentless 
champion for life, and she has been a 
dear friend. She is a great colleague 
and a great leader on this issue of pro-
tecting the most vulnerable—these lit-
tle babies. 
Senator ERNST, would you agree with 
me that Senate Democrats should join 
us in voting for these commonsense 
bills that protect innocent human life? 
Ms. 
ERNST. 
Absolutely, 
Senator 
DAINES, and I am proud to join you on 
the floor for this colloquy this evening. 
I will take your place, and I have just 
a few words that I would love to share 
on these bills as well and protecting 
our unborn. 
Again, I would like to thank the Sen-
ator from Montana for arranging this 
colloquy. 
We want to get into some of these 
commonsense measures that we are 
speaking about this evening. I appre-
ciate the Senator from Montana’s 
words, and it is astounding that we are 
even having this debate on the floor of 
the Senate. 
Very, very commonsense, lifesaving 
measures are coming before us this 
week, and, first, I would like to step 
back a little bit and take a moment to 
answer the one key, big-picture ques-
tion at the center of this debate and 
the debate that we have over life, and 
the basic question there: Is life valu-
able? And my answer to that question 
is absolutely. 
I see value in every single life, and 
we all have different ideas on how we 
measure the value of life, but I can boil 
it down a little bit. Some folks would 
say it is what a human being will bring 
to this world. Now, what that is can be 
determined by different measures, but 
what impact does a person have. 
Now, some, of course, will see celeb-
rities. They will see athletes. They will 
see trailblazers and scientists and say: 
Wow, they have made their mark on 
the world, and they contribute so 
much. There is so much impact there. 
But then I see it in everyday, com-
mon people at home in Iowa, as well. I 
even reflect upon folks like a friend of 
my daughter’s who grew up in our 
small community of Stanton. He has 
Down syndrome, and yet he contrib-
uted so much—and still does to this 
day—in our home community. He is 
our hometown spirit coordinator at 
every football game, and he is leading 
everyone in their cheers and sup-
porting our hometown teams. And this 
young man brings so much joy to ev-
eryone. I would say that his life has 
made a huge impact on all who know 
him. We can think of the smallest 
among us as well, that baby in the 
womb, and how does that baby make 
an impact. As a mother, I know that 
fellow mothers can relate to this as 
well, but that baby makes an impact 
even in the womb. The experience of 
pregnancy can change a woman for-
ever, not just physically but mentally 
and emotionally. 
Women I talk to will often comment 
on the amazing feeling and bond they 
will have with that child who is grow-
ing in their womb. They experience 
that heartbeat in the womb. And even 
to the effects that maybe we don’t like 
to reflect on—I remember the swollen 
ankles I had in the last month of preg-
nancy. No offense to Fred Flintstone, 
but I had Fred Flintstone feet. Even 
things like that we can reflect on. But 
the impact of having that child stays 
with me. It changed me forever. 
I know that other mothers know that 
whether it is from the beginning of a 
pregnancy with a healthy, full-term 
child or whether it is a scary pre-
mature birth or, for some, the difficult 
and life-ending decision to abort, the 
fact remains that the tiny human 
being carried within us has forever left 
a mark on their mother. This truth 
spurs me on to fight even harder to 
protect the undeniable value that 
every human life has. Every human life 
has value. 
So today I stand with my pro-life col-
leagues 
in 
asking 
our 
pro-choice 
friends—many of whom are mothers 
and fathers themselves—to meet us in 
the middle. We may not be able to get 
on the same page when it comes to rec-
ognizing the inherent value each of 
these lives holds, but surely we can 
agree that protecting our most vulner-
able from painful death is a unifying 
and humanitarian cause. 
What I would like to do is just tell 
you the story of my fellow Iowan, 
Micah Pickering. Micah is joining us 
on the Hill this week, and I encourage 
all of my colleagues to take some time 
to meet this incredible boy. He will be 
on the Hill tomorrow. 
When I first met Micah, he was just 
a couple years old, and his family had 
brought him into my office. I had this 
picture. I had just this picture in my 
office. Micah, then 2 years old, ran over 
to this picture, not knowing it was he, 
and he pointed at it and he said: ‘‘A 
baby!’’ 
I started to cry, and I said: ‘‘Yes, 
Micah, that is a baby.’’ 
Today Micah is happy, healthy, and 
he is 7 years old. He was born at 22 
weeks, and that is the age of some of 
the 
babies 
we 
are 
talking 
about 
today—born at 22 weeks. When Micah 
was born, he was literally the size of a 
bag of M&Ms, a tiny baby. 
Folks, can’t we all agree that this is 
a baby and that babies like Micah who 
survive a premature birth at 20 to 22 
weeks—we are talking about those who 
survive at 20 weeks, which is more than 
halfway through pregnancy—are de-
serving of protection? I agree with 
that. 
The only difference between Micah 
and the more than 10,000 children who 
are aborted after 22 weeks’ gestation— 
which is what Micah was—the dif-
ference, the dividing factor, is that 
Micah was wanted by his parents. His 
parents, Danielle and Clayton, saw his 
inherent value. 
The Pain-Capable Unborn Child Pro-
tection Act is a measure that should 
meet the approval standard of my pro- 
choice friends because supporting this 
bill means giving all of the Micah 
Pickerings of the world an equal, fight-
ing chance. The degree to which a child 
of any age is wanted does not diminish 
their value, and we have an obligation 
as lawmakers to protect their right to 
life. 
But if we cannot come together in 
support of a bill that protects viable 
babies from abortion at the point when 
they feel pain, then surely, surely a 
baby who survives an abortion attempt 
deserves the same degree of care as any 
other newborn. Folks, just think about 
it. These babies, their lives—they have 
already survived a horrific abortion at-
tempt and have been given a second 
chance at life. But without our putting 
the necessary protections in place, 
these precious babies can literally be 
left to die. Those in the medical field 
who fail to care for these precious 
newborns need to be held accountable. 
Senator SASSE has helped lead the 
way in protecting these living babies 
with his Born-Alive Abortion Survivors 
Protection Act, a commonsense bill 
that I proudly support. Given that we 
have an estimated 143 babies who died 
between 2003 and 2014 after surviving 
abortion, it is clear that we need to 
strengthen the current law. These ba-
bies deserve the basic medical standard 
of care regardless of how wanted they 
may have been. 
I implore you to think about the 
issue of life in a new way, one that is 
very simple. When you think about ev-
eryone you have come into contact 
with, whether it is your family, your 
friends, your coworkers, your spouse, 
even yourself, every single person was 
at one time a defenseless child in their 
mother’s womb. Every life, from the 
baby who has just been conceived, to 
each and every one of you in this room 
tonight, has value. Whether you are 
that star athlete, whether you are that 
scientist 
making 
new 
discoveries, 
whether you are that hometown cheer-
leader, every life has value. 
To my Senate colleagues, we have 
had this debate before, but I ask that

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1111 
February 24, 2020 
you consider these bills with new eyes 
focused on the inherent value of life. 
You have the opportunity to save lives, 
and I hope you will join me in doing so. 
I thank the Senator from Montana 
for raising this issue this evening, and 
I am proud to be a ‘‘yes’’ vote on both 
of these tremendous bills. I hope we 
can get others to join us in that effort. 
Thank you, Senator. 
I yield the floor. 
Mr. DAINES. Senator, thank you, 
and thanks for your very moving story 
about Micah Pickering. It helps to take 
these ideas and translate them directly 
into these children today, whom you 
can see there as a little baby. 
There are critics of the born-alive 
bill who would say this horrible act 
that we described here tonight simply 
doesn’t happen. For those who say 
that, they should talk to somebody 
named Melissa Oden. In fact, just last 
year when we had the born-alive bill on 
the floor of the Senate, I was coming 
down to speak on behalf of the bill. I 
was just about maybe 50 feet from 
where I am standing right now, outside 
the doors of the Senate, as I was mak-
ing my way to speak, and guess who 
was standing outside the door of the 
Senate. It was Melissa Oden. She is a 
beautiful mother today. She survived a 
saline-infusion abortion as a little baby 
at about 5 months. She was left for 
dead, and she was discarded—this was 
in Kansas City, MO—until a hospital 
nurse heard her little cries. This nurse 
saved Melissa’s life, for which we are 
very thankful. It was quite an experi-
ence to meet her just outside these 
Chamber doors. Now Melissa herself is 
a mother. 
I believe we have a duty, an obliga-
tion to protect life and particularly the 
most innocent life and the most vul-
nerable life, like a little baby who can 
be born alive as a result of a botched 
abortion attempt. 
It is my hope that the Members of 
this body, Republicans and Democrats, 
will vote to support and defend this 
most basic human right and recognize 
that late-term abortions—I recognize 
this is a very divisive issue in this 
country, but I would think that on the 
issue of late-term abortions, on the 
issue of babies born alive as a result of 
botched abortions—can we at least 
come together where public opinion 
overwhelmingly supports both and say, 
let’s stop these barbaric practices. 
These are extreme positions. They 
should be outlawed in this country. We 
can no longer simply stand by as our 
children—we talk about children in 
this country losing their lives to abor-
tion and infanticide. 
As Americans, we have an obligation 
to honor our Nation’s founding promise 
enshrined in our Declaration of Inde-
pendence that all men and all women 
and all human life are created equal 
and endowed by our Creator with these 
certain inalienable rights—life, liberty, 
and the pursuit of happiness. Think 
about it this way: Of these important 
rights, you can’t have liberty and the 
pursuit of happiness without first hav-
ing the right to life. This right to life 
is the first and most important of these 
inalienable rights. 
So I urge my colleagues to join us in 
supporting these commonsense bills to 
stop this brutal violence of late-term 
abortions of pain-capable babies. That 
is why it is called the Pain-Capable 
Act. Babies are capable of feeling pain 
at about 20 weeks. That is why, when 
in utero surgery is performed, they ad-
minister anesthesia—because the baby 
is feeling pain. That is where we are 
drawing the line with these bills to 
stop late-term abortion and also babies 
who are born alive—which isn’t about 
abortion; this is about infanticide. We 
must protect these innocent babies, 
standing for life, standing for those 
who are most vulnerable. 
I see that my colleague from Ne-
braska, Senator SASSE, has come to the 
floor. Senator SASSE authored the baby 
born alive bill. I am grateful Senator 
SASSE is joining us here tonight in this 
colloquy. 
Senator SASSE, can you explain the 
importance of passing the bill you have 
authored? 
Mr. SASSE. Thank you, Senator 
DAINES of Montana and Senator ERNST 
of Iowa. I know Senator BRAUN is going 
to be here shortly. I want to speak 
about both pieces of legislation we are 
going to be considering tomorrow. 
Both of them are very important to 
distinguish. I know it has been brought 
up a few times tonight, but just to be 
sure we are all on the same page, Sen-
ator GRAHAM’s Pain-Capable Unborn 
Child Protection Act is a very impor-
tant piece of legislation, and I think 
my Born-Alive Abortion Survivor’s 
Protection Act—both of them, which 
my colleagues here have spoken on, are 
very important pieces of legislation. 
They are important pieces of legisla-
tion, but they are distinct and have to 
be clarified to the American people, via 
the press, on how they differ. 
These two bills are different, but 
they are connected by a simple ques-
tion, which is, Will the Senate vote to-
morrow to protect babies? This is 
about as straightforward a question as 
you can possibly have. Will the Senate 
vote tomorrow to protect babies? 
Let’s talk first about Senator GRA-
HAM’s legislation. Every mom and dad 
knows what it is like to see your child 
hurt, to see somebody fall down, maybe 
with something as minor as a scraped 
knee or a burnt hand on the stove or a 
finger slammed in a car door or a bed-
room door. You know that experience 
of a deep breath that is going to be fol-
lowed by the piercing cry. Something 
drops in the pit of your stomach. Every 
parent knows this feeling. You want to 
scoop them up. You want to grab them. 
You want to hold them, and you want 
to take away the pain. You would take 
Tenex for the pain, if you could, to pro-
tect your baby from that pain. You 
want to make it stop, and you want 
them to know that they are going to be 
okay. When your child hurts, you hurt, 
and it is far worse to watch your child 
hurting than to feel the pain yourself. 
So we have this gut feeling when it 
comes to pain. When we see someone 
hurting, we know this is not the way 
the world is supposed to be. Pain is not 
natural. This is not the order of things 
as it was meant to be, and so our heart 
leaps at the sight of someone in pain— 
not just a child, but especially when it 
is a child, a family member, or a 
friend, or even a complete stranger. 
When you see somebody in pain, we 
want to make it stop. Human beings 
are compassionate; that is, we feel 
along with others. When they suffer, 
we suffer, and so we reach out to pro-
tect. We want to give comfort. 
Tomorrow, we have the opportunity 
to extend that reach of care and com-
fort and protection. The Pain-Capable 
Unborn Child Protection Act would 
protect babies as early as 20 weeks into 
pregnancy—that is halfway through— 
by inscribing in law our responsibility 
to protect innocent babies in the womb 
from the pain that is inflicted by abor-
tion. 
The responsibility that we have when 
a 2-year-old skins her knee is also a re-
sponsibility that we have when a 20- 
week-old baby in the womb is threat-
ened. The science is clear: Modern med-
icine is allowing surgeons to perform 
operations on in utero babies, and 
these 
intricate, 
amazing—amazing— 
little operations available nowadays 
are saving the lives of thousands of ba-
bies with what would have once been 
fatal conditions. These surgeons fre-
quently administer drugs to the baby, 
just like they do to the mother. These 
doctors are treating two patients—not 
just one—and they do everything in 
their power not just to advance the 
health of both of the patients but to 
protect both of the patients from pain. 
They want to be sure that both pa-
tients are safe and comfortable and as 
well cared for as possible. 
Science has shown us that these ba-
bies feel pain, and the Pain-Capable 
Unborn Child Protection Act is a sim-
ple recognition that, although the baby 
in the womb might be mostly invisible 
to us, we are not blind to her needs. We 
have a responsibility to spread that 
umbrella of law over every vulnerable 
person, no matter how small. Size 
doesn’t determine dignity or worth. 
The question before us tomorrow is, 
Will the U.S. Senate vote to protect 
these babies? It is pretty simple. You 
are going to hear lots of crazy com-
mentary talking about other stuff than 
what we are actually voting on tomor-
row, but what we are voting on is, 
Should the U.S. Senate vote to protect 
these babies? I plan to vote in favor of 
compassion because I believe that 
being pro-mom and pro-baby and being 
pro-science are all bundled up together. 
So tomorrow, we are going to consider 
compassionate pro-science and pro- 
baby legislation, and I implore my col-
leagues, all 100 of us, ought to be doing 
the same. 
I also know that, although I am 
unapologetically pro-life, many of my

February 24, 2020 
colleagues in this body are not. So to-
night, I also want us to talk about a 
different piece of legislation. It is mo-
tivated by that same care and that 
same concern with having the U.S. 
Senate vote to protect babies. It is ac-
tually a different piece of legislation 
than Senator GRAHAM’s important pro- 
life anti-abortion piece of legislation. I 
want to talk about this second piece of 
legislation. 
Even if you are unwilling to vote to 
defend unborn babies, I hope that my 
colleagues would at least consider join-
ing with us in voting to protect babies 
that have already been born. Senator 
GRAHAM’s legislation is about pro-
tecting babies in utero. We have got a 
second piece of legislation before us to-
morrow that is about protecting babies 
after they have already been born. 
Will we acknowledge that a baby out-
side the womb should not be left to die? 
That is what the Born-Alive Abortion 
Survivors Protection Act is actually 
about. One year ago tomorrow, the 
U.S. 
Senate, 
sadly, 
shamefully, 
shrugged its shoulders at babies who 
had already been born after botched 
abortions. A bipartisan majority in 
this body—let’s be clear—a bipartisan 
majority voted in favor of protecting 
these babies, but we didn’t have enough 
votes. We didn’t have enough votes vot-
ing with us in this Chamber to break 
the filibuster in favor of infanticide. 
That is what happened a year ago to-
morrow in this Chamber. 
Today, there is nothing in our Fed-
eral law that criminalizes the denial of 
care to a baby that has survived an 
abortion, so when a baby lives through 
an abortion procedure and ends up born 
and is outside mom, there is nothing in 
Federal law that criminalizes denying 
care to those babies and allowing her 
or him to die, and we have to change 
that. 
This second bill tomorrow is not ac-
tually about abortion. It is not about 
Roe v. Wade. It is about something dif-
ferent. It is about what happens after 
an abortion that didn’t succeed in ter-
minating the baby’s life. When a baby 
survives and is lying on that table cold 
and naked and alone, what does our so-
ciety do? Are we a country that pro-
tects babies that are alive—born out-
side the womb after having survived a 
botched abortion—are we a country 
that says it is okay to just sit back and 
allow that baby to die? That baby that 
is fighting for life, is it okay for us to 
just let that baby die? It is a plain and 
simple question, and we all know what 
the right answer is. There are hard 
calls that we consider in this body 
sometimes. There are a lot of gray 
issues. This isn’t one of them. This 
isn’t a hard call. 
Since last year’s vote, we have 
brought before this body testimony 
from medical experts who have been in-
volved in abortion procedures and who 
have had in their hands 1-pound little 
babies that had survived abortions. 
That was the purpose of the Senate Ju-
diciary Committee’s hearing on this 
bill 2 weeks ago. In that, we heard tes-
timony that made clear why this bill is 
necessary, and it made clear that the 
other side actually can’t confront the 
arguments head on. That is what hap-
pened 2 weeks ago in the Senate Judici-
ary Committee. 
We were looking at the text of this 
bill. We had in front of us medical ex-
perts who had the experience with peo-
ple who had babies who had survived 
abortions, and they talked about what 
happened in their clinics. Everybody 
who spoke against the Abortion Sur-
vivors Protection Act didn’t talk about 
the bill at all. They talked about all 
these other things. Some of them 
aren’t actually hard debates, but none 
of them had anything to do with the 
legislation that we were actually con-
sidering. That is because they couldn’t 
actually defend opposing a bill that the 
purpose is simply to prohibit infan-
ticide. 
That is why Planned Parenthood, 
NARAL, and the Big Abortion doctors’ 
lobby resorted to simple misinforma-
tion. That is all the hearing was by 
those who were opposed to the legisla-
tion. They say that what we are trying 
to do is prevent something that doesn’t 
happen. That is not true. That is a 
myth. There are 8 States where we 
have some reporting information. We 
should 
have 
reporting 
information 
from all 50 States, but in the 8 States 
that we have, we have information 
about the babies that survive abortions 
and what happens to them. They 
wouldn’t confront those facts, so they 
just made these blanket statements 
that this legislation deals with some-
thing that doesn’t happen, but it does, 
which is why we had a hearing and why 
we brought in experts. 
Then the opponents of this legisla-
tion talked about completely unrelated 
things. They said that there are no 
such things as abortion survivors. We 
would like to introduce you to some of 
them. Perhaps they should also consult 
the CDC’s records. Of the several 
States I mentioned, there were eight 
that reported data on survivors. 
Or they should talk to the Abortion 
Survivors Network. They should look 
into the eyes of spouses and friends and 
neighbors and coworkers and parents 
who are abortion survivors, and they 
should try to tell them that what we 
are doing is pointless or a waste. They 
can’t do that because their position is 
morally indefensible. 
Who are the spouses and friends and 
neighbors who are not here today be-
cause they did not receive lifesaving 
medical care in their first moments of 
life? The terms of the Born-Alive Abor-
tion Survivors Protection Act are sim-
ple: A child born alive during a botched 
abortion would be given the same level 
of care that is provided to any other 
baby born at that same gestational 
stage. That is it. That is all the second 
piece of legislation we are going to deal 
with tomorrow does. 
It says, when a baby survives an 
abortion, that baby should get the 
same level of medical care that is pro-
vided to any other baby at the same 
stage of gestational development. That 
is all it does. It doesn’t create, as oppo-
nents charge, some mandate to prolong 
the suffering of a dying child. It 
doesn’t do anything like that. It sim-
ply says, if a baby survives an abor-
tion, it has to get the same level of 
medical care that would be provided to 
any other baby at the same stage of 
gestational care that had parents that 
wanted that baby. It doesn’t force the 
doctor to do anything that violates 
medical best practice. It simply says 
that a baby who survives an abortion is 
a baby and should be treated as such, 
as a baby, with care and compassion. 
Do Senators in this Chamber believe 
their own campaign slogans? Our col-
league from Vermont, who is on the 
verge of becoming the standard-bearer 
for the Democratic Party in our coun-
try, has declared: ‘‘The mark of a great 
Nation is how it treats its most vulner-
able people.’’ 
Senator SANDERS is right. America is 
dedicated to the proposition that all 
men and women, all boys and girls, are 
created equal—even the littlest ones, 
even if they happen to come into the 
world in the most horrific of cir-
cumstances and even if they are crip-
pled or inconvenient or unwanted. 
America recognizes the immeasurable 
dignity of every human being, regard-
less of race or sex or creed or ability. If 
we are hemming and hawing about 
whether it is okay to let children die of 
neglect, we know we have lost part of 
our soul. 
Tomorrow, we have a chance to rec-
ognize and secure the dignity of some 
of the most vulnerable members of our 
society. We have a chance to protect 
those babies who come into the world 
under the worst of conditions, and we 
have the chance to extend to them the 
possibility of life and of love. Tomor-
row, we can speak up for the voiceless. 
We can defend the defenseless. We can 
come to the aid of the innocent. 
This is not about Roe. This is not 
about politics. It is about a simple 
question: Will the U.S. Senate, tomor-
row, stand for the proposition that ba-
bies are babies and they deserve care? 
Will the Senate vote tomorrow to pro-
tect babies? 
I defer to my colleague from the 
State to the east, Iowa, Senator ERNST. 
Ms. ERNST. I thank Mr. SASSE, the 
great Senator from Nebraska. I want to 
thank him for joining the colloquy and 
for offering the bill that would save 
these babies that, as he described, are 
born in horrific circumstances. But a 
baby is a baby, and it is undeniable. 
I do hope that we have a number of 
our friends and colleagues from across 
the aisle join us tomorrow in that vote 
and say that, yes, this is a life that de-
serves dignity and a chance and an op-
portunity. That is what we are asking 
for. So thank you very much for your 
work there. 
We will continue our colloquy. We 
have another speaker that is joining us

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1113 
February 24, 2020 
from the great State of Indiana. I will 
yield to the junior Senator. 
Mr. BRAUN. Mr. President, a little 
over a month ago—or a year ago—I was 
here with Senator SASSE and asked for 
a unanimous consent vote. I was here, 
mostly curious to see who might object 
to a bill that wants born alive—where 
you do everything you can to keep that 
child alive. I was appalled then, and 
here again, we are talking about the 
same thing, but I think we have got 
room for optimism. 
We have got two bills that have got-
ten, I think, more support at this stage 
of the game than in a long time. First 
on the Pain Capable bill, last month, 
two researchers, with broadly different 
views on abortion, published research 
in the Journal of Medical Ethics, stat-
ing 
conclusively 
that 
‘‘the 
neuro-
science cannot definitely rule out fetal 
pain before 24 weeks.’’ 
As we continue to learn more about 
the science of when unborn children 
can feel pain in the womb, the moral 
imperative to provide a cutoff point for 
abortions grows stronger and stronger. 
I hope that my colleagues, especially 
on the other side of the aisle, will not 
deny science by allowing abortions to 
be performed on unborn children capa-
ble of feeling pain. 
The Born Alive bill—again, we are 
closer than ever. On a procedural vote, 
we have 53 votes, bipartisan, almost 
there, with 3 Republicans not able to 
vote. So, theoretically, 56 votes pos-
sibly. I stepped up here a year ago, and 
I do it again because I also sense, 
across the country, things are starting 
to change. 
Millennials are now leaning towards 
what the solemnity and sanctity of life 
is about, and I think, if we just take 
guidance from that younger genera-
tion, it ought to be able to move four 
Senators to get in line and do what 
seems to be so clear from a moral point 
of view. 
Some will say that a bill to ensure 
medical care for babies born after 
failed abortions is unnecessary because 
it doesn’t happen that often. That is 
not a good reason. It doesn’t matter 
how common it is. It matters if it is 
right or wrong. Even if my colleagues 
do not agree with me that every baby 
conceived has the right to be born, we 
should at least agree that every baby 
that is born has a right to live. If you 
go back a few years ago, 2015, there 
were 38 votes for the same bill. In 2017, 
there were 36. A little over a year ago, 
there were 53, or 56, however you want 
to look at it. 
I plead to citizens across this coun-
try, just as I did a little over a year 
ago, to get ahold of your Senators. In 
States where the sanctity of life—the 
solemnity of life—is important, get 
ahold of your Senators and tell them 
that we need their votes. 
I yield the floor. 
Ms. ERNST. Thank you very much to 
the junior Senator from Indiana. We 
really appreciate his efforts on these 
bills as well. 
Again, I think all of us would agree 
that these are commonsense pieces of 
legislation, and we would love to see 
some 
movement 
coming 
from 
our 
friends on the left. 
We have had a wonderful colloquy 
this evening. 
Of course, again, thanks to the Sen-
ator from Montana, Mr. DAINES, for 
leading this colloquy and for sharing 
his time with us this evening as we 
have talked about some of these meas-
ures. 
To the junior Senator from the great 
State of Nebraska, as well, Mr. SASSE, 
thank you so much for authoring the 
Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Act. 
And thanks to Senator LINDSEY GRA-
HAM, of course, for authoring his pain- 
capable bill. 
Again, we have talked this evening 
about those two bills that really hit 
close to home. I did happen to sit 
through the Judiciary Committee hear-
ing that was led by Senator SASSE a 
couple of weeks ago, where we did talk 
about the Born-Alive Abortion Sur-
vivors Act. It was true that so many of 
our friends across the aisle were de-
flecting on the legislation. They were 
talking about a woman’s right to 
choose. They were talking about being 
pro-choice and supporting abortion. 
The bottom line is, this is not a bill 
that has anything to do with those top-
ics. This is about saving babies who are 
born alive after a botched abortion at-
tempt. So I think we have to make 
that very clear as we move through to-
morrow’s proceedings. 
Again, thank you for the colloquy 
this evening. It has been very helpful 
in expressing our views about the 
rights of these babies to live and to 
make a difference in our world. 
With that, we will close out the col-
loquy, again thanking those who are 
supporting the bills, as well as those 
who joined us here on the floor this 
evening. 
ORDER OF PROCEDURE 
Ms. ERNST. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous 
consent 
that 
notwith-
standing the provisions of rule XXII, at 
11:30 a.m. on Tuesday, February 25, the 
Senate vote on the following: one, con-
firmation of Executive Calendar No. 
384; two, cloture on Executive Calendar 
No. 491; three, cloture on Executive 
Calendar No. 569; further, that if clo-
ture is invoked on the nominations and 
following the third vote in the series, 
the Senate stand in recess until 2:15 
p.m. to accommodate the weekly party 
luncheons; that following the lunch re-
cess, the Senate resume legislative ses-
sion and consideration of the motion to 
proceed to S. 3275 and the time from 
2:15 p.m. until 3:30 p.m. be equally di-
vided between the two leaders or their 
designees. 
I further ask unanimous consent that 
at 3:30 p.m., cloture on the motions to 
proceed to S. 3275 and S. 311 ripen and 
that following the votes on those mo-
tions to invoke cloture, the Senate 
vote on the following: one, confirma-
tion of Executive Calendar No. 491; 
two, confirmation of Executive Cal-
endar No. 569; and, three, cloture on 
Executive Calendar No. 416. 
I further ask unanimous consent that 
if cloture is invoked on the Greaves 
nomination, the vote on confirmation 
occur at 1:45 p.m. on Thursday, Feb-
ruary 27; further, that if any nomina-
tion is confirmed, the motion to recon-
sider be considered made and laid upon 
the table and the President be imme-
diately notified of the Senate’s action. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
DAINES). Without objection, it is so or-
dered. 
f 
LEGISLATIVE SESSION 
MORNING BUSINESS 
Ms. ERNST. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the Senate 
proceed to legislative session for a pe-
riod of morning business, with Sen-
ators permitted to speak therein for up 
to 10 minutes each. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
f 
LITHUANIAN AND ESTONIAN 
INDEPENDENCE DAYS 
Mr. 
GRASSLEY. 
Mr. 
President, 
today is Estonia’s 102nd Independence 
Day. 
Lithuania celebrated 102 years of 
continuous statehood on the 16th, and 
Latvia will in November. 
This is significant not just because 
the Baltic States are close American 
allies with shared values; it is worth 
noting because Russia has been waging 
war on historical truth. 
Vladimir Putin recently made the ab-
surd claim that Poland was to blame 
for World War II. 
In 1992, Boris Yeltsin made public the 
secret annex to the Molotov-Ribben-
trop Pact, making it clear that the 
Nazis and Soviets colluded to carve up 
Poland and the Baltics. 
That also puts to lie the myth that 
the Baltics ‘‘joined’’ the Soviet Union. 
The United States recognized them as 
occupied sovereign states. 
We ought to continue to defend their 
sovereignty as well as historical truth. 
f 
WAR POWERS RESOLUTION 
Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I 
rise to elaborate on my statement of 
February 13 in support of S. J. Res. 68. 
This resolution puts the Senate on 
record with regard to war powers and 
Iran in the wake of the U.S. strike 
against Islamic Revolutionary Guard 
Corps Commander Qasem Soleimani on 
January 2, 2020. 
The resolution, which directs the 
President to terminate the use of U.S. 
Armed Forces for hostilities against 
Iran, passed the Senate with a strong 
bipartisan majority. This bipartisan 
consensus is a testament to Senator 
KAINE’s leadership, and I commend him 
for that.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1114 
February 24, 2020 
It is also a reflection of the Senate’s 
deep concern about the risk of a broad-
er military conflict between the United 
States and Iran. 
There is no dispute that Soleimani 
was an enemy of the United States, but 
this extraordinary killing of a high- 
ranking foreign military official nearly 
brought us to the brink of war. The 
strike would be justified if it had been 
necessary to defend against an immi-
nent attack against the United States, 
but the administration has failed to 
provide any persuasive evidence of such 
a threat. 
Instead, the administration appears 
to be laying the foundation for further 
military action against Iran, without 
coming to Congress. Let’s be clear: It is 
not just that there is no existing au-
thorization. To the extent that the ad-
ministration 
continues 
to 
confront 
Iran militarily, it is doing so in direct 
opposition to Congress—both the House 
and Senate have now passed bipartisan 
resolutions directing the President to 
terminate hostilities with Iran—and 
without the support of the American 
people. 
With that in mind, I would like to ad-
dress some of the features of S.J. Res. 
68, as well as the administration’s legal 
rationale for the Soleimani strike and 
why that rationale is so problematic. 
Before doing so, I want to take a step 
back and make sure that everyone un-
derstands 
the 
real 
world 
impact. 
Today, over 100 service men and women 
are suffering from traumatic brain in-
juries incurred during an Iranian retal-
iatory attack over Soleimani. My heart 
goes out to them and their families. 
Thankfully there were no American 
casualties, but we will not be so lucky 
if President Trump stumbles into a 
broader conflict with Iran. 
So when I raise the alarm over this 
administration’s actions, it is not aca-
demic. It is about our sons and daugh-
ters, husbands and wives, and brothers 
and sisters serving in harm’s way. It is 
about honoring their service with more 
than just words. It is about ensuring 
that they are not needlessly put in 
danger by an arrogant and lawless ad-
ministration that refuses to recognize 
any limitation on its ability to drag 
our country into war. 
S.J. Res. 68 has a number of impor-
tant features. I will highlight three of 
them briefly. 
First, this resolution established a 
new precedent in the Senate. 
The 
War 
Powers 
Resolution, 
as 
amended, provides for privileged con-
sideration of joint resolutions that di-
rect the President, in broad terms, to 
stop the use of U.S. forces in specified 
hostilities. The only such privileged 
resolutions in the Senate prior to S.J. 
Res. 68 mandated that the President 
‘‘remove’’ U.S. forces from hostilities. 
The operative language of S.J. Res. 68 
uses a variation of that language. In-
stead of ‘‘remove,’’ it directs the Presi-
dent to ‘‘terminate’’ the use of U.S. 
forces for hostilities. 
In a failed bid to prevent privileged 
consideration of S.J. Res. 68, the Re-
publican majority asserted, in effect, 
that ‘‘remove from hostilities’’ was a 
term of art and that privilege was 
available only for resolutions that used 
that specific phrase. That rigid ap-
proach is inconsistent with the over-
arching purpose of the War Powers 
Resolution—for Congress to reconfirm 
and reassert its constitutional powers 
over the use of force—and contrary to 
the statutory framework and legisla-
tive history of the War Powers Resolu-
tion. The statute does not prescribe 
specific language, and the legislative 
record is full of examples of the inter-
changeable use of ‘‘remove,’’ ‘‘termi-
nate,’’ and multiple other synonymous 
terms. 
Ultimately, the Senate moved for-
ward with consideration of S.J. Res 68 
on a privileged and expedited basis. 
This precedent is noteworthy for two 
reasons: First, it clarifies that there 
are no magic words required for privi-
lege. This means that a resolution that 
requires the President to stop the use 
of U.S. Armed Forces in hostilities will 
not be deprived of expedited consider-
ation in the Senate over semantics. 
Second, it provides a degree of flexi-
bility for Senators who seek to stop 
such hostilities. For example, ‘‘termi-
nate’’ or other synonyms may be more 
appropriate than ‘‘remove’’ for certain 
situations, 
like 
cyber 
operations, 
where implying a need for or requiring 
the physical removal of forces may not 
be practicable or desirable. 
Second, S. J. Res. 68 includes a rule 
of construction stating that it does not 
prevent the United States from defend-
ing itself against imminent attack. 
This is a critical feature. While we can-
not abide by this President or any 
President usurping Congress’ role and 
responsibility to authorize the use of 
force, the United States always has the 
right to defend itself against an ongo-
ing or imminent attack. 
In tandem with this rule of construc-
tion, the Senate adopted an amend-
ment offered by Senator Risch that 
added 
the 
following 
finding: 
‘‘The 
President has a constitutional respon-
sibility to take actions to defend the 
United States, its territories, posses-
sions, citizens, service members, and 
diplomats from attack.’’ 
The responsibility to ‘‘take actions’’ 
in defense of the United States and our 
people and interests is a core function 
of the Presidency. This responsibility 
includes the full range of resources 
available to the executive branch—di-
plomacy, 
law 
enforcement, 
intel-
ligence, military force, and beyond. 
Each type of action is subject to dif-
ferent legal and constitutional consid-
erations, and the President never has a 
blank check. He or she is obligated to 
act consistently with the law and the 
Constitution at all times, even when in 
defense of the country. When using 
military force in self-defense, this 
means his or her actions must be in re-
sponse to an attack or imminent at-
tack unless Congress has explicitly au-
thorized some other action. Against 
this backdrop, the Risch amendment is 
consistent with both the rule of con-
struction in S.J. Res. 68 and the con-
stitutional balance between Congress 
and the executive branch over the use 
of force. 
For these reasons, I voted in favor of 
the Risch amendment and am not sur-
prised it passed overwhelmingly. 
While Senate passage of S. J. Res. 68 
is a major step against an unnecessary 
and unauthorized war with Iran, I am 
concerned that the administration may 
not heed the message. At minimum, its 
legal rationale for the Soleimani strike 
suggests that it is attempting to lay 
the foundation for further military ac-
tion against Iran. 
The administration has publicly as-
serted 
three 
legal 
bases 
for 
the 
Soleimani strike, but none of them add 
up. 
First, let me address the 2002 Iraq au-
thorization 
to 
use 
military 
force, 
AUMF, a law that this administration 
has distorted beyond recognition. 
The administration has stated that 
the 2002 AUMF is a valid legal basis for 
the 
Soleimani 
strike 
because 
Soleimani was a threat ‘‘emanating 
from Iraq.’’ I am sorry to say that does 
not pass the laugh test. 
Congress passed the 2002 AUMF for a 
single purpose—to address the threat 
posed by Saddam Hussein’s alleged 
weapons of mass destruction. Nothing 
about the law, its text, or its legisla-
tive history suggests that it ever au-
thorize or was intended to authorize 
the use of force against Iran. 
I know because I was there. I debated 
the AUMF, and I voted against it. But 
even the most staunch supporters 
would never have claimed that the au-
thorization to use force against Sad-
dam Hussein in 2002 extended to the 
killing of a senior Iranian commander 
18 years later. 
The administration also cites article 
II of the Constitution as a legal basis 
for the Soleimani strike. Article II 
would be available to the extent the 
strike was necessary to defend against 
an imminent attack; however, as I 
noted earlier, nearly 2 months have 
passed, and Congress and the American 
people are still waiting for proof—proof 
that such an attack was, in fact, immi-
nent and, if so, that killing Soleimani 
was required to prevent the attack. 
Perhaps not surprisingly, given the 
lack of supporting evidence, the admin-
istration does not limit its article II 
claim to self-defense. Like other recent 
administrations, it asserts that the 
Constitution empowers the President 
to use military force ‘‘to protect im-
portant national interests.’’ 
But what kind of legal standard is 
this? 
At best, ‘‘protecting important na-
tional interests’’ sets an incredibly low 
bar for the most consequential of ac-
tions. At worst, it is a self-serving 
power grab that the President can use 
to justify military action anywhere in 
the world without congressional au-
thorization.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1115 
February 24, 2020 
We should not be surprised—this 
‘‘standard’’ was concocted by and for 
the executive branch to maximize the 
President’s ability to use military 
force without congressional authoriza-
tion. It does not reflect a neutral anal-
ysis of the separation of power, it has 
not been tested in the courts, and it 
has not been approved by Congress. 
Just a few weeks ago, in this very 
Chamber, we listened as the Presi-
dent’s defense lawyers argued during 
the impeachment trial that steps taken 
in support of the President’s reelection 
are inherently in the national interest. 
That was a shocking and frightening 
claim in the impeachment context. But 
now consider it in the context of send-
ing the men and women of our Armed 
Forces into harm’s way. 
Surely the Constitution does not au-
thorize the President to use force in 
support of his or her reelection. Surely, 
it does not. Then again, this adminis-
tration has been unable or unwilling to 
identify any limits on its purported ar-
ticle II authority, any instance in 
which it would concede that it needs 
Congress to authorize the use of force. 
Finally, I refer you to Secretary 
Pompeo’s January 17, 2020, appearance 
on the Hugh Hewitt radio show. While 
on air, Secretary Pompeo insinuated 
that the designation of the IRGC as a 
foreign terrorist organization, FTO, 
served as a legal basis to target IRGC 
members, 
presumably 
including 
Soleimani. 
FTO designations are administrative 
actions taken pursuant to the Immi-
gration and Nationality Act; they are 
clearly not congressional authoriza-
tions for the use of military force. 
Now, I was hoping that Secretary 
Pompeo himself or a State Department 
official on his behalf would issue a sim-
ple clarification and acknowledge what 
we all know: An FTO designation has 
no bearing on whether this or any ad-
ministration can use military force, 
period. 
I have written the Secretary on this 
question, and I have posed the same 
question to the State Department’s 
Acting Legal Adviser. We continue to 
await a response, and I must say that 
the delay does not leave me with much 
confidence that we will receive the 
right answer. 
As so clearly demonstrated by the 
flimsy legal rationale advanced in rela-
tion to the Soleimani strike, we cannot 
rely on this administration or any ad-
ministration to guard Congress’ pre-
rogatives over war powers. 
I am hopeful that the Soleimani 
strike and the Senate debate over S.J. 
Res. 68 will serve as a wake-up call. I 
am hopeful that all of our colleagues in 
this Chamber and in the House will 
work to reassert Congress’ role over 
the use of force. 
We owe it to the Constitution, we 
owe it to the American people, and we 
owe it to the men and women who fight 
and die on our behalf.

RECOGNIZING 175 YEARS OF 
HOSPITALITY IN FRENCH LICK 
Mr. YOUNG. Mr. President, I rise to 
recognize 175 years of tourism, history, 
and hospitality that the French Lick 
Resort has brought to my home State 
of Indiana. 
In 1832, two Hoosier brothers, Thom-
as and Dr. William Bowles, purchased 
1,500 acres of property near French 
Lick, IN. Part of the property’s allure 
was the abundant mineral springs load-
ed with Epsom salt and sulfur. As a 
physician, Dr. Bowles became intrigued 
by the medicinal benefits that the min-
eral springs possessed, which famously 
turned into the Hoosier tonic Pluto 
Water. In 1845, the brothers welcomed 
their first guests after building a 
unique, 
three-story, 
wood-framed 
hotel. 
In 1901, a small group of investors, in-
cluding 
former 
Indianapolis 
mayor 
Tom Taggart, bought the property 
from 
the 
Bowles 
brothers. 
Mayor 
Taggart’s vision and political expertise 
aided in the development of the hotel 
and the expansion of the Monon Rail-
road from Chicago to the front en-
trance, encouraging more tourists to 
‘‘take to the waters.’’ By 1905, the 
French Link Springs Hotel had become 
a grand destination, and its services 
were greatly sought after by all of Indi-
ana society. Soon enough, it had 
gained worldwide recognition. With the 
hotel’s stunning success, Donald James 
Ross, ‘‘the Michelangelo of golf course 
design’’ and a member of the World 
Golf Hall of Fame, was hired to build 
the French Lick Springs Golf Course. 
In 1924, the course hosted a PGA cham-
pionship, attracting more national at-
tention and further success. By 1931, 
the hotel became the unofficial head-
quarters of the national Democratic 
Party and became the site for the 1931 
Democratic Governor’s Conference. As 
a socialite destination, numerous nota-
ble guests visited the springs, including 
Franklin D. Roosevelt, Harry S. Tru-
man, Ronald Reagan, John Barrymore, 
and Howard Hughes. 
Because of its heritage of tourism 
and hospitality, in 2003 the French 
Lick Springs Hotel was added to the 
National Register of Historic Places—a 
distinction of notable merit. In 2005, 
the French Lick Springs Hotel and its 
former competitor, the West Baden 
Springs Hotel, were purchased by the 
Cook Group, Inc., a family-owned com-
pany headquartered in Bloomington, 
IN. After a complete 1-year renovation, 
the French Lick Resort was born, con-
tinuing its legacy of attracting visitors 
from the around the world to Southern 
Indiana with a variety of events. 
The French Lick Resort and its 
world-class amenities have served mil-
lions of guests and has greatly added to 
the cultural history of the United 
States. On behalf of the State of Indi-
ana, I wish the resort continued suc-
cess for another 175 years and beyond. 
f 
TRIBUTE TO BETTY COLBERT 
Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, 
today I wish to recognize Ms. Betty 
Colbert on the occasion of her retire-
ment from her position as program as-
sistant for the U.S. Senate Youth Pro-
gram, USSYP, after 57 years of re-
markable service. 
Ms. Colbert started working for the 
USSYP during its first program in 1963 
and has continued her impressive ten-
ure ever since. With her guidance, the 
program has provided unparalleled edu-
cational opportunities and experiences 
for countless high school students. 
Her involvement with the program 
started thanks to her late husband, Mr. 
George Colbert, a Tuskegee airman 
who served as Mr. Randy Hearst’s driv-
er while Mr. Hearst was helping to de-
velop the USSYP. Despite working full 
time with the National Institutes of 
Health, Ms. Colbert took leave each 
year in order to devote herself to the 
USSYP’s administration. A thoughtful, 
giving woman, she took a hands-on ap-
proach, doing everything from taking 
calls from Senate offices and the White 
House to making sure each partici-
pating student got an individual flag 
flown over the Capitol to recognize 
their accomplishment. 
The success of USSYP alumni is in 
part thanks to Ms. Colbert’s tireless ef-
forts. I participate in the program 
every year, including serving as co-
chair in 2019, and I can attest firsthand 
to her unfailing work ethic and the 
level of care she puts in to every aspect 
of the USSYP. 
Students, Senators, and staff mem-
bers have all bore witness to Ms. 
Colbert’s extraordinary commitment 
to her role. Not only does she ensure 
everything runs smoothly for all in-
volved, but she also focuses on the 
small details. Her driven, considerate 
nature plays a significant part in giv-
ing students the most enjoyable and 
transformative experience possible. Ms. 
Colbert leaves behind a legacy that 
will continue to positively shape the 
USSYP for years to come. 
I applaud her over half a century of 
service and hope my colleagues will 
join me in congratulating Ms. Betty 
Colbert on her well-earned retirement.

ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS 
TRIBUTE TO TROY WAYMAN 
∑ Mr. CASSIDY. Mr. President, I rise 
today to congratulate the CEO and 
president of One Acadiana, 1A, Troy 
Wayman, and the entire 1A organiza-
tion for the distinguished honor of be-
coming an accredited economic devel-
opment organization, AEDO. 1A has 
joined the ranks of only 66 economic 
groups in the world to earn the AEDO 
standing. 
In 2015, the Greater Lafayette Cham-
ber of Commerce’s board of directors 
ventured out to create an organization 
that would embody its longstanding 
mission—to be the leading force in the 
improvement of the business environ-
ment as well as the economic health 
and development of the region. Over 
the last 5 years, 1A has grown to more 
than 800 investors, members, and part-
ners 
while 
serving 
the 
9-parish 
Acadiana region. After a yearlong proc-
ess, 1A was recognized and was awarded 
as an AEDO, cementing its place 
among the best of the best in the in-
dustry. 
Being honored and recognized by the 
International Economic Development 
Council, IEDC, as an AEDO speaks vol-
umes to who they are as an organiza-
tion. The dedication and passion that 
drives these members is a testament to 
their organization and speaks volumes 
to all of Louisiana. Congratulations, 
One Acadiana, on becoming an AEDO. I 
look forward to witnessing what the fu-
ture holds for 1A and the entire 
Acadiana region.∑

TRIBUTE TO WILLIAM GASTON 
CAPERTON III 
∑ Mr. MANCHIN. Mr. President, it is a 
great privilege of mine to rise and 
honor the legacy of one of the most in-
fluential, generous, and inspiring West 
Virginians I have ever had the pleasure 
of calling a dear friend: William Gaston 
Caperton IIII. My friend Gaston turns 
80 years young on February 21, 2020, 
and it is an honor to celebrate his leg-
acy with my fellow West Virginians. 
It would be difficult to find anyone as 
knowledgeable or dedicated to our 
home State as Gaston. The son of Eliza 
and William Gaston Caperton, Jr., Gas-
ton was born and raised with his sister, 
Cary, in our home State’s capital, 
Charleston. I have always said there is 
no greater accomplishment in the 
world than to be in a position to give 
back to the community you love, that 
made you who you are. That is what 
made Gaston the wonderful, inspiring, 
and generous person he was. After at-
tending Episcopal High School in Alex-
andria, VA, and the University of 
North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Gaston 
returned home to join the family busi-
ness. 
Under 
his 
leadership, 
the 
McDonough-Caperton Insurance Group 
became 
the 
10th 
largest 
privately 
owned insurance brokerage firm in the 
United States. Along the way, he 
owned and operated a bank and a mort-
gage company. 
The people of the home State that 
Gaston and I share have an exceptional 
can-do spirit, a neighborly love that is 
unrelenting, and are grounded by the 
same core principle: to help others be 
the best they can be. That is Gaston’s 
legacy as a public servant and as a 
leader. After a successful business ca-
reer in finance and insurance, Gaston 
was elected as West Virginia’s 31st 
Governor in 1988 and quickly revolu-
tionized West Virginia’s education sys-
tem. During the 8 years of his adminis-
tration, the average teacher salary 
went from 49th in the Nation to 31st. 
He launched one of the country’s ear-
liest and most comprehensive basic 
skills computer initiatives, as well as 
invested more than $800 million into 
building, modernizing, and improving 
school facilities throughout the State. 
He also conducted an aggressive pro-
gram of international trade missions to 
promote the export of West Virginia 
products. Gaston’s focus on investing 
in the future paid off, adding almost 
90,000 jobs between 1989 and 1997, low-
ering the unemployment rate to its 
lowest level in 17 years, and increasing 
total investment by new and expanded 
businesses by more than $3.9 billion. 
Throughout the years, we bonded 
over our passion for public service, for 
inspiring the next generation of lead-
ers, and we share the common goal of 
helping the rest of the country discover 
all that West Virginia has to offer. 
Gaston left office in 1997 and spent 2 
years teaching at Harvard and Colum-
bia Universities before becoming the 
eighth president of the College Board 
in 1999. As president, he helped trans-
form the century-old institution into a 
mission-driven, student-first operation 
promoting college success and oppor-
tunity for all Americans. During his 13 
years of leadership, the College Board 
touched the lives of students in nearly 
27,000 high schools and colleges, pro-
moted the importance of writing by 
adding a writing section to the SAT. 
and doubled the number of students 
succeeding in Advanced Placement. 
Gaston’s leadership also renewed the 
organization’s focus on education in a 
globalized marketplace by initiating a 
new series of AP world language and 
culture course, as well as embarking on 
a historic education exchange program 
with China. 
During his more than 20 years in gov-
ernment and education, Gaston chaired 
the Democratic Governor’s Association 
and the Southern Regional Education 
Board, participated in the executive 
committee of the National Governors 
Association, received 10 honorary doc-
toral degrees, and has been presented 
with numerous awards, including the 
1996 
Computerworld 
Smithsonian 
Award for his tireless efforts to intro-
duce technology into the classroom, 
the 2007 James Bryant Conant Award 
for his significant contributions to the 
quality of education in the United 
States and the 2012 Policy Maker of the 
Year by the National Association of 
School Boards of Education. 
After retiring from the College Board 
in 2012, Gaston moved back to his 
hometown and served on the board of 
directors of a variety of U.S. corpora-
tions. He has two sons, Gat and John, 
and is the proud grandfather of Eliza, 
Katie, Evie, Ella, and Genavieve. 
I can’t speak enough to what a good- 
hearted, wonderful person he truly is. I 
always think of Gaston as true renais-
sance 
man; 
no 
matter 
the 
cir-
cumstances, he kept a cool head and a 
warm demeanor, always able to discern 
the most honorable path forward. He 
has always been one of West Virginia’s 
most proud representatives, no matter 
where life has taken him. Again, it is a 
privilege to join the people of the 
Mountain State in celebrating Gaston 
Caperton’s life and legacy and to wish 
him a very happy 80th birthday.∑
