FACING CATASTROPHE ON 
SOUTHERN BORDER 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Pennsylvania (Mr. JOYCE) for 5 min-
utes. 
Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania. Madam 
Speaker, despite what the Biden ad-
ministration would like the American 
people to believe, our Nation is facing 
a catastrophe on the southern border. 
Last month alone, U.S. Border Pro-
tection officers encountered more than 
100,000 migrants attempting to cross 
the border illegally. This is a 173 per-
cent increase from last February. 
Right now, the Office of Refugee Re-
settlement shelters that house unac-
companied migrant children are reach-
ing capacity. Our border agents are 
being diverted from their posts to care 
for record numbers of teenagers and 
children who are illegally crossing our 
border. 
This escalating crisis is rooted right 
here in Washington, D.C., more than 
1,700 miles away from that border. As 
we witness unprecedented groups of mi-
grants reaching the United States, 
there is no question that the Presi-
dent’s weak border security stance has 
heightened this so-called challenge. 
By reversing the Trump administra-
tion’s actions to bolster security on 
the southern border and halting con-
struction of the border wall, the cur-
rent administration is sending a clear 
message to the world that America’s 
border, unfortunately, is wide open. 
Innocent people, and cartels and 
human 
traffickers 
who 
prey 
upon 
them, pay attention to what we say 
here in Washington. Words have con-
sequences. Rhetoric has ramifications. 
What is happening on the southern 
border is both a humanitarian and se-
curity crisis. It is simply inhumane for 
politicians to incentivize the dan-
gerous trek across Central America to 
the southern border. 
Those who attempt the journey face 
treacherous conditions, gang violence, 
and unthinkable danger. As my friend, 
Republican leader KEVIN
MCCARTHY, 
said at the border just yesterday, ‘‘This 
is human heartbreak.’’ 
As the situation worsens, the limited 
resources on the border are being 
pulled away from protecting the Amer-
ican people. The Biden administration 
is prioritizing illegal immigrants over 
the American people. As U.S. Customs 
and Border Protection leadership shifts 
to caring for migrants, there are fewer 
officers 
focusing 
on 
apprehending 
threats. 
This is not only a human trafficking 
crisis; it is also a drug trafficking cri-
sis. The illicit drugs, including deadly 
methamphetamine, 
cocaine, 
and 
fentanyl, that come across the porous 
southern border are killing Pennsylva-
nians in the streets of Altoona, Johns-
town, Bedford, Chambersburg, Gettys-
burg, and Somerset, and throughout 
my district. 
Just this weekend, Border Patrol 
agents apprehended two individuals at-
tempting to smuggle nearly 8 pounds of 
methamphetamine across the border. 
By preventing these drugs from reach-
ing American communities, we likely 
saved lives. What would have happened 
if these suspects hadn’t been caught? 
Clearly, we need more, and not less, 
security on our southern border. 
As our Nation continues to combat 
the COVID–19 pandemic, Congress can-
not afford to stand back and allow the 
border crisis to get even worse. We 
need safer, stronger, and more secure 
communities 
in 
Pennsylvania 
and 
across the country. 
Here is the truth: The border crisis 
has consequences beyond the border. 
Inaction is not the correct action. Bor-
der security is national security. 
f 
FAREWELL TO CONGRESS 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
New Mexico (Ms. HAALAND) for 5 min-
utes. 
Ms. HAALAND. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to deliver my final remarks 
on the floor of the people’s House. 
I am humbled to have spent the last 
2 years in this Chamber, where I proud-
ly served New Mexico, alongside my 
colleagues past and present in the New 
Mexico delegation. I am thankful to 
Senators MARTIN
HEINRICH
and BEN 
RAY LUJA´ N, in particular, for helping 
to build support for my confirmation, 
and to former Senator Tom Udall for 
his years of friendship and mentorship. 
I love New Mexico. Not only is it my 
home, where I raised my child, went to

H1368 
March 16, 2021 
college, started a small business, and 
started organizing, it is my ancestral 
homeland. 
As a 35th-generation New Mexican, 
and not unlike the other families with 
roots in our State, I have a deep con-
nection to the land, air, and water that 
sustains our communities. My ances-
tors settled there because they were 
drawn to the once-mighty Rio Grande 
and the sacred places that dot the 
sandstone mesas and granite moun-
tains. 
That is why I made the most of my 
time in Congress. I spent every oppor-
tunity meeting with families, listening 
to small business owners, learning 
about our tech industry, connecting 
with brave servicemembers and vet-
erans, and working to deliver for the 
people. 
When I was a little girl, none of this 
crossed my mind as a possibility for 
me. I wasn’t one of the students picked 
out to apply to college. In fact, I didn’t 
apply to college until I was 28. I was 
constantly struggling to make ends 
meet, and I raised my child as a single 
mom. 
Growing up, Native women rarely 
held Federal leadership positions, and 
now little girls everywhere will know 
that they can run for Congress and win 
and that this country holds promise for 
everyone. 
In fact, it is the unique experiences 
and struggles that make good leaders 
and why I became an organizer in the 
first place. I believe that it is the fact 
that I relied on food stamps to feed my 
family that makes me qualified to ad-
vocate for families like mine. It is the 
fact that I overcame addiction that 
makes me qualified to help people who 
are in their own struggles. It is the fact 
that I know what it is like to be indige-
nous that makes me qualified to advo-
cate for our country to meet its trust 
responsibility. 
The beauty of this Chamber is that 
each Member of Congress brings their 
unique experiences to the table and ad-
vocates for the causes we know best. 
With Speaker NANCY PELOSI’s brilliant 
leadership, House Natural Resources 
Committee Chair RAU´ L GRIJALVA’S wis-
dom, and House Armed Services Com-
mittee Chair ADAM SMITH’s guidance, 
and all the leadership here in the 
House, I had the opportunity to make a 
real difference for communities every-
where by addressing climate change; 
protecting voting rights; fighting for 
racial, environmental, and economic 
justice; and providing urgent COVID 
relief for millions of people. 
I am also thankful for the collabora-
tion and mentorship of my colleagues 
across the aisle, including Representa-
tive TOM COLE and the dean of the 
House, DON YOUNG, and my colleagues 
on the House Armed Services and Nat-
ural Resources Committees. 
We worked in a bipartisan way to ad-
dress issues, including missing and 
murdered indigenous women and ensur-
ing that our servicemen and -women 
and military families have the re-
sources that they need. 
To my colleagues in the Tri-Caucus, 
thank you for embracing the issues fac-
ing Native Americans and working to 
address longstanding disparities in our 
communities. 
I am proud that, with the support of 
my colleagues, several of my bills be-
came law: the Not Invisible Act; Rent 
the Camo, a pilot program for pregnant 
servicemembers in the 2021 NDAA; the 
PROGRESS for Indian Tribes Act; pro-
visions from my Military Housing 
Oversight and Servicemember Protec-
tion Act in the 2020 NDAA; the Native 
American Business Incubators Act; and 
the Veterans Affairs Tribal Advisory 
Committee Act. 
I thought I would have more time 
here, but we are called to service in dif-
ferent ways. 
Though I am excited to become the 
first Native American Cabinet Sec-
retary in history, I am also sad to 
leave this Chamber. As a twice-elected 
Member of Congress, it has been both a 
pleasure and privilege to serve along-
side you in our quest to improve the 
lives of the American people. 
I want each of you to know that I am 
grateful for the knowledge you shared 
with me, the friendship, and the work 
we accomplished together, and I will 
miss all of you dearly. 
I wouldn’t be here today without my 
extraordinary staff in Albuquerque and 
here at the Capitol, the Natural Re-
sources Committee staff, and the House 
Armed Services Committee staff. They 
all put in very long hours on behalf of 
our State and our country. My legisla-
tive accomplishments are also their ac-
complishments. 
Additionally, thanks to all of the 
staff who work right here on the floor, 
whose dedication and experience keep 
our Congress running. I am so grateful 
to all of you. 
To New Mexico, thank you. Thank 
you to the activists, supporters, fami-
lies, and communities that make our 
State an incredible place to call home.

CONGRATULATING JIM SCHMITT 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Florida (Mr. RUTHERFORD) for 5 min-
utes. 
Mr. RUTHERFORD. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to congratulate Mr. Jim 
Schmitt for being named Teacher of 
the Year in Duval County. 
Mr. Schmitt received this honor for 
his work teaching global perspectives 
and research at Mandarin High School. 
Serving as a teacher for 28 years, Mr. 
Schmitt has dedicated his career to im-
proving both student learning and the 
methods teachers use to educate their 
students. 
During the COVID–19 pandemic, Mr. 
Schmitt has demonstrated his leader-
ship ability by creating a discussion 
forum for teachers to share strategies, 
ensuring that teachers and students 
are prepared to learn in an in-class or 
online environment. 
On behalf of the Fourth Congres-
sional District of Florida, I thank Mr. 
Schmitt for his dedication to educating 
the students of northeast Florida and 
for his commitment to the success of 
his students and peers alike. 
CONGRATULATING ALI PRESSEL 
Mr. RUTHERFORD. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to congratulate Ms. Ali 
Pressel for being named Teacher of the 
Year in St. Johns County. 
Ms. Pressel received this honor for 
her work teaching biology and agri-
culture at Creekside High School. 
As a teacher for more than 15 years, 
Ms. Pressel worked tirelessly to help 
bring exciting educational opportuni-
ties in STEM to her students and to en-
courage them to engage their curi-
osity. 
The 
philosophy 
that 
guides 
Ms. 
Pressel’s work is that all students 
should have limitless opportunities to 
make connections in their commu-
nities through exploration and dis-
covery. 
On behalf of the Fourth Congres-
sional District of Florida, I thank Ms. 
Pressel for her dedication to educating 
the students of northeast Florida and 
for her commitment to the success of 
her students and peers alike. 
CONGRATULATING KRISTAN CRONIN 
Mr. RUTHERFORD. Madam Speaker, 
I 
rise 
today 
to 
congratulate 
Ms. 
Kristan Cronin for being named Teach-
er of the Year in Nassau County. 
Ms. Cronin received this honor for 
her work teaching fourth grade math, 
science, and social studies at Wildlight 
Elementary School. 
Ms. Cronin has been a teacher for 17 
years and is committed to guiding her 
students as they recognize and develop 
their talents and abilities. Ms. Cronin 
creates a hands-on work environment 
for her students to succeed, develops a 
love for knowledge, and helps them 
apply what they have learned to every-
day life. 
On behalf of the Fourth Congres-
sional District of Florida, I thank Ms. 
Cronin for her dedication to educating 
the students of northeast Florida and 
for her commitment to the success of 
her students and peers alike.

COMMONSENSE SOLUTIONS TO 
GUN VIOLENCE CRISIS 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
Illinois (Ms. UNDERWOOD) for 5 minutes. 
Ms. UNDERWOOD. Madam Speaker, I 
rise to call on our colleagues in the 
Senate to swiftly pass H.R. 8, the Bi-
partisan Background Checks Act; and 
H.R. 1446, the Enhanced Background 
Checks Act. 
These bills are bipartisan, common-
sense solutions to our Nation’s gun vio-
lence crisis. Together, they accomplish 
what the vast majority of Americans 
want, to keep guns out of the wrong 
hands. I was proud to cosponsor both 
bills and vote for them when they 
passed the House last week. Now it is 
time for the Senate to take action.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H1369 
March 16, 2021 
In 2020, the Gun Violence Archive re-
ported more than 40,000 deaths caused 
by gun violence, including over 1,300 
children. Yet, despite the fact that gun 
violence continues to rise—and 90 per-
cent of Americans, including 80 percent 
of gun owners support universal back-
ground checks—Republicans in Con-
gress have spent years blocking bipar-
tisan legislation to close our biggest 
loopholes and keep our communities 
safe. 
Gun violence is preventable, yet it is 
such a tragically routine occurrence in 
this country that every community has 
a story. Mine is no exception. 
I recently joined the Aurora Histor-
ical Society in Illinois to pay tribute 
to the five people murdered and the 
seven heroic first responders who were 
injured 2 years ago during a shooting 
at the Henry Pratt Company. 
The mayor of Aurora, Richard Irvin, 
said after the shooting that ‘‘we as a 
society cannot allow these horrific acts 
to become commonplace.’’ 
Yet, 
absurdly, 
we 
have 
already 
reached the point in which this un-
speakable tragedy in Illinois is not 
even 
America’s 
most 
lethal 
mass 
shooting in a town named Aurora. So I 
call on my colleagues in the Senate to 
take action with us so that our chil-
dren can someday live in a country in 
which gun violence is no longer com-
monplace. 
Madam Speaker, as a nurse, I am 
thrilled that, in 2019, we finally di-
rected Federal funding toward public 
health research on gun violence, for 
the first time in two decades. This type 
of research is critical for evidence- 
based policymaking, and I will keep 
fighting to make sure that that fund-
ing continues. But studying the prob-
lem is just the first step in our work to 
solve it. It is already past time to 
make simple changes that we already 
know work. 
Madam Speaker, background checks 
are a simple, effective way to keep 
guns out of the wrong hands. A 1995 
Connecticut law requiring background 
checks for firearm purchases was asso-
ciated with a 40 percent decline in gun 
homicides and a 15 percent drop in gun 
suicides. Meanwhile, when Missouri re-
pealed a similar law in 2007, gun homi-
cides jumped by 23 percent, while fire-
arm suicides rose by 16 percent. Homi-
cides and suicides by other means 
stayed flat in both States; only gun vi-
olence changed. 
I wish all our public health crises had 
such a clear, straightforward solution. 
Madam Speaker, H.R. 8 would require 
a lifesaving background check for 
every gun sale, while H.R. 1446 would 
give the FBI more time to complete 
those checks before a single sale goes 
through. These bills would not add any 
new restrictions on who can buy a gun 
or what kind of gun that they can 
have. Rather, it would make it easier 
to enforce our existing gun laws and 
stop guns from being sold to people 
who are already prohibited from own-
ing one. 
Madam Speaker, I am not willing to 
wait for the next murderer to attack 
the next church in the next Charleston. 
I am not willing to wait for the next 
angry employee to murder his cowork-
ers at the next Henry Pratt in the next 
Aurora, Illinois. I am not willing to 
wait for the next Aurora, Colorado, or 
the next Pulse Nightclub, or the next 
Parkland, or the next Tree of Life, or 
the next Sandy Hook. I am also not 
willing to wait for more women to be 
murdered by their abusers, or for more 
children to be lost to gun violence. 
I am done waiting. My constituents 
are done waiting. Enough is enough. 
Americans deserve to feel safe in 
their schools, in their houses of wor-
ship, in their movie theaters, in their 
workplaces, and in their homes. We can 
no longer live in a country where any 
building can so easily become a battle-
field. 
Madam Speaker, my colleagues and I 
in the House voted last week for a safer 
future for our children. Now I call on 
my colleagues in the Senate to save 
lives and send H.R. 8 and H.R. 1446 to 
the President’s desk.

prayer: 
Gracious God, as we approach an-
other week of legislation, we pray with 
the psalmist Your favor on each leader 
in this Chamber. Endow them with 
Your righteousness, that the judg-
ments of their hearts and the words of 
their mouths will demonstrate Your 
defense of the disheartened. 
Grant them an understanding of Your 
perfect justice, that their legislation 
would reflect Your deep affection for 
those in need of Your salvation. May 
the words we speak to one another and 
the motions put forward be as refresh-
ing as rain on a mown field. And may 
their decisions, their actions, and their 
passionate hearts serve this Nation as 
showers watering the earth. 
Bless each and all of us that in all we 
say, in all that we do, in everything we 
accomplish this week would give honor 
to Your glorious name. 
We offer this prayer to You in the 
strength of that name. 
Amen.

SUPPORT THE NUTRITION CARE 
ACT 
(Ms. BLUNT ROCHESTER asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute.) 
Ms. BLUNT ROCHESTER. Madam 
Speaker, March is National Nutrition 
Month, and I am proud to join my col-
leagues, Representatives JUDY CHU and 
JACKIE WALORSKI, in leading H.R. 1551, 
the Nutrition Counseling Aiding Re-
covery for Eating Disorders Act, or the 
Nutrition CARE Act for short. 
Madam Speaker, eating disorders ac-
count for one death every 52 minutes 
and can impact the lives of individuals 
across their lifespan. This mental ill-
ness does not discriminate, but long-
standing health inequities, implicit 
bias, and stigma contribute to why 
people of color with eating disorders 
are half as likely to be diagnosed or to 
receive treatment. 
The Nutrition CARE Act would pro-
vide Medicare part B coverage for med-
ical nutrition therapy for beneficiaries 
with eating disorders, meaning hun-
dreds of thousands of Medicare bene-
ficiaries who identify as Black, indige-
nous, or people of color would have 
coverage of a key treatment compo-
nent. 
Madam Speaker, I am proud to help 
lead this effort, and I urge my col-
leagues to cosponsor H.R. 1551 and 
bring it to the floor of this Congress.

Mr. MURPHY of North Carolina. 
Madam Speaker, as we speak, at Presi-
dent Biden’s behest, thousands of mi-
grants are crossing our border illegally 
and being detained in facilities that 
are well over capacity. 
Besides the many adults, the real vic-

sent by drug cartels to this country. 
These children are often used by car-
tels to smuggle drugs or money, and 
many are being sold into essential slav-
ery with the promise of easy and safe 
passage to the U.S. 
Does the President not care about 
the problem of juvenile human traf-
ficking occurring at the border? 
For years, Democrats and media 
types slammed the Trump administra-
tion for keeping kids in cages. Their 
righteous indignation is conspicuously 
absent from today’s discourse, as they 
are now referring euphemistically in 
the press to the ‘‘migrant detention 
centers.’’ Amazingly, you have to have 
a negative COVID test to fly into the 
country, but you can be COVID-posi-
tive and enter illegally. 
Madam Speaker, the basic reality is 
this: We need to know who is in our 
country. We are a country of laws. 
‘‘Catch and release’’ has now become a 
national security threat. Even CNN is 
calling this a crisis. 
I urge the Biden administration to 
admit this is a crisis and fix the prob-
lem it has caused.

CONGRATULATING 
BOYDEN-HULL 
AND 
WESTERN 
CHRISTIAN 
SCHOOLS 
(Mr. FEENSTRA asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. FEENSTRA. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to celebrate something that 
hasn’t happened in Iowa for over 110 
years. 
Last Friday night, two schools from 
the same community met in the Boys 
Class 2A State Basketball Champion-
ship. It just so happened that the two 
schools are from my hometown, Hull, 
Iowa, a community of 2,500 people. The 
game was an incredible game where 
Western Christian ended up winning by 
6 points at the end. 
With this win, Wolfpack, from West-
ern Christian, set another record, being 
the first school to have 10 State cham-
pionships in the State. 
Congratulations to Boyden-Hull on 
an incredible season, and congratula-
tions to Western Christian on being the 
2A State Champions of Iowa. Both 
teams make me proud. Both teams 
make Iowa proud. Both teams make 
Hull proud. 
Madam Speaker, I can truly say this: 
Hull, Iowa, is the capital of basketball 
in Iowa.

RECOGNIZING LEW COHEN AND 
MAGNES GLENN 
(Mr. SESSIONS asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. SESSIONS. Madam Speaker, one 
month ago, the entire State of Texas 
was blanketed with a polar vortex that 
plunged temperatures to single digits 
for over 120 hours. Six inches of ice, 
combined with nine inches of snow, 
were common as far south as San Anto-
nio, Texas. Within a day, all 254 coun-
ties in Texas were under a State and 
Federal emergency declaration. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today to give 
thanks to heroes who heard and saw 
this crisis and did something about it. 
Two heroes—Chairman Lew Cohen, 
and his partner, Magnes Glenn, from 
Hawaiian Springs Water—sprung into 
action. A simple call as a result of our 
friendship resulted in over 8,000 water 
bottles being shipped to Leon County, 
Texas; and 8,500 bottles of water being 
shipped to Freestone County, Texas. 
Help they were. Thank you to so 
many who were just like these two he-
roes who helped Texas in her time of 
need.

COMMEMORATING K9 VETERANS 
DAY 
(Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania 
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend his remarks.) 
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today to recog-
nize this past Saturday, March 13, as 
K9 Veterans Day, an opportunity to 
commemorate the working dogs that 
support our men and women in uni-
form. 
This year marks the 79th anniversary 
of the establishment of the K9 Corps. 
In 1942, following the attack on Pearl 
Harbor, the Army began training for 
the K9 Corps, originally known as the 
War Dog Program. In the years that 
passed, the K9 Corps has become a vital 
part of our Armed Forces operations. 
Perhaps one of the well-known mili-
tary K9s is Conan, whose efforts led to 
the success of the 2019 al-Baghdadi 
raid. 
Following their service, these retired 
dogs often serve as support animals to 
servicemembers who may be suffering 
from PTSD and other disabilities, both 
mental and physical. 
Madam Speaker, our veterans can 
greatly benefit from the assistance and 
companionship that a dog provides, and 
our K9 veterans benefit from their new-
found forever homes. Our K9 veterans 
have served our country, and they, too, 
deserve to be honored for their service.

RESIGNATION FROM THE HOUSE 
OF REPRESENTATIVES 
The SPEAKER pro tempore laid be-
fore the House the following resigna-
tion from the House of Representa-
tives: 
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, 
March 16, 2021. 
Hon. NANCY PELOSI, 
Speaker of the House, 
Washington DC. 
DEAR SPEAKER PELOSI: A short time from 
now, I will be sworn in as the 54th Secretary 
of the U.S. Department of the Interior. As 
such, I respectfully offer my resignation 
from the seat representing New Mexico’s 1st 
Congressional District in the United States 
House of Representatives effective imme-
diately. 
I am excited to become the first Native 
American cabinet secretary in history, al-
though I also feel a sense of sadness in pre-
paring for this new role. As a twice elected 
member of Congress, it has been the pleasure 
and privilege of a lifetime to serve alongside 
you and my colleagues in our quest to im-
prove the lives of the American people and 
find ways to both protect and advance the 
greatest democracy in history. 
As the daughter of a 30-year combat Ma-
rine who grew up traveling our country, and 
a single mom who relied on food stamps to 
get by, I never imagined a day like this. I am 
grateful for my time here in the House. I am 
grateful for the love and support of many 
people, and most notably, I am a proud New 
Mexican. 
As a volunteer, activist, and organizer for 
more than twenty years, it was my proudest 
professional moment to be elected as one of 
the first two Native American women to 
serve in Congress. I feel immensely satisfied 
to have been a part of what our Democratic 
House Majority accomplished in a short pe-
riod of time. With your brilliant leadership, 
I have had the opportunity to help move leg-
islation forward on critical issues like cli-
mate change, voting rights, racial and eco-
nomic justice, and most recently COVID re-
lief for millions of Americans. I’m also proud 
to have worked in a bipartisan manner to 
help address the crisis of Missing and Mur-
dered Indigenous Women and ensure the men 
and women serving in our nation’s military 
and their families have the support they 
need. The professional alliances and personal 
friendships I have made during my time in 
the People’s House will last a lifetime. 
I know that my work as a member of the 
Natural Resources Committee and as Chair 
of the Subcommittee on National Parks, 
Forests, and Public Lands has helped prepare 
me for my new role in the Biden Administra-
tion, and I am grateful to my colleagues for 
those opportunities. The honor and responsi-
bility that President Biden has bestowed on 
me to serve the country in this way is pro-
found, humbling, and exhilarating. 
Many thanks to you and all of my col-
leagues for your support and your friendship.

TO 
UNITED 
STATES 
CAPITOL 
POLICE 
AND 
THOSE 
WHO 
PROTECTED 
THE 
U.S. CAPITOL ON JANUARY 6, 2021 
Ms. WATERS. Mr. Speaker, I move to 
suspend the rules and pass the bill 
(H.R. 1085) to award three congres-
sional gold medals to the United States 
Capitol Police and those who protected 
the U.S. Capitol on January 6, 2021, as 
amended. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 1085 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. FINDINGS. 
The Congress finds the following: 
(1) Every day, the United States Capitol 
Police (‘‘Capitol Police’’) protects the U.S. 
Capitol, Members of Congress, congressional 
staff and institutional staff, journalists, and 
the visiting public. 
(2) On January 6, 2021, a mob of insurrec-
tionists forced its way into the U.S. Capitol 
building and congressional office buildings 
and engaged in acts of vandalism, looting, 
and violently attacked Capitol Police offi-
cers. 
(3) The sacrifice of heroes including Cap-
itol Police Officers Brian Sicknick and How-
ard Liebengood, Metropolitan Police Depart-
ment Officer Jeffrey Smith, and those who 
sustained injuries, and the courage of Cap-
itol Police Officer Eugene Goodman, exem-
plify the patriotism and the commitment of 
Capitol Police officers, and those of other 
law enforcement agencies, to risk their lives 
in service of our country. 
(4) Up to seven Americans died following 
this violent attack, and more than 140 law 
enforcement officers suffered physical inju-
ries, including 15 officers who were hospital-
ized. 
(5) The desecration of the U.S. Capitol, 
which is the temple of our American Democ-
racy, and the violence targeting Congress are 
horrors that will forever stain our Nation’s 
history. 
SEC. 2. CONGRESSIONAL GOLD MEDALS. 
(a) 
PRESENTATION
AUTHORIZATION.—The 
Speaker of the House of Representatives and 
the President pro tempore of the Senate

who protected the U.S. Capitol on January 6, 
2021.

tion’’ for this Act, submitted for printing in

such statement has been submitted prior to 
the vote on passage. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentlewoman from 
California (Ms. WATERS) and the gen-
tleman from Kentucky (Mr. BARR) each 
will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from California. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Ms. WATERS. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days in which to 
revise and extend their remarks on this 
legislation and to insert extraneous 
material thereon. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from California? 
There was no objection. 
Ms. WATERS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentlewoman from Cali-
fornia (Ms. PELOSI), the distinguished 
Speaker of the House, who is also the 
sponsor of this legislation. 
Ms. PELOSI. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentlewoman from California for 
her leadership in bringing this legisla-
tion to the floor where we can recog-
nize the patriotism and heroism of 
members of the Capitol Police force, 
and I thank her for facilitating this 
honor. 
This usually takes a much longer pe-
riod of time, but because of the gentle-
woman from California, the chair of 
the Financial Services Committee, this 
is on a faster track, and it needs to be. 
As you know, Mr. Speaker, January 6 
was one of the darkest and deadliest 
days in American history. The waging 
of the violent insurrection against the 
United States Capitol and our very de-
mocracy on that day was a profound 
horror that nearly defies comprehen-
sion.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H1372 
March 16, 2021 
That day, the country witnessed the 
gleeful desecration of our temple of de-
mocracy. We observed Members of Con-
gress flee for their lives, as staff and 
support 
workers 
barricaded 
behind 
doors and hid under furniture. 
We saw how over 140 members of law 
enforcement were physically harmed 
while defending our democracy and 
how several lost their lives. 
January 6 was a day of horror and 
heartbreak. But because of these cou-
rageous men and women, it was also a 
moment of extraordinary heroism. 
That day, the United States Capitol 
Police force put themselves between us 
and the violence. They risked their 
safety and their lives for others with 
the utmost selflessness, and they did so 
because they were patriots, the type of 
Americans who heard the call to serve 
and answered it, putting country above 
self: 
Heroes like Capitol Police Officer 
Brian Sicknick, described by his broth-
er as someone who ‘‘spent his life try-
ing to help other people.’’ Our sym-
pathies go out to his family. 
Heroes like Capitol Police Officer 
Howie Liebengood, honored as ‘‘an ex-
ample of selfless service’’ and beloved 
by Senators for being ‘‘one of the most 
kindest and thoughtful people’’ they 
had ever met. Our sympathies as well. 
Heroes like Metropolitan Police Offi-
cer Jeffrey Smith, a 12-year veteran of 
the force, known by all as the type of 
officer who would never hesitate to 
help those in need. He made that sac-
rifice. 
Heroes like Metropolitan Police Offi-
cer Daniel Hodges, whom I had the 
privilege of meeting and thanking, who 
was beaten and crushed nearly to 
death, who said about protecting our 
democracy on January 6: ‘‘If it wasn’t 
my job, I would have done it for free.’’ 
Heroes like Capitol Police Officer Eu-
gene Goodman. We all saw his heroism 
as he drew the mob away from Sen-
ators, saving lives, again, in an act of 
profound heroism. 
May the courage of these heroes al-
ways remain an inspiration to us, and 
may we always remember the valor of 
the fallen, which made them martyrs 
for our democracy. 
I feel very honored to be sponsoring 
this legislation. The Speaker rarely 
sponsors legislation, certainly cospon-
sors hardly ever. 
Today, united in grief and gratitude, 
the House is honoring these heroes as 
we pass legislation to bestow upon 
them the Congressional Gold Medal, 
the highest honor this Congress can 
give. 
The service of our men and women in 
uniform of the Capitol Police force and 
other services that day brings honor to 
our democracy, and their accepting 
this medal will bring luster to this 
award. 
Over 300 Members of Congress have 
already cosponsored this legislation in 
a bipartisan fashion, including Mr. 
MCCARTHY and Mr. SCALISE, the Repub-
lican leadership, and that is a tribute 
to the great respect that we all have 
for the Capitol Police force. 
We also saw that respect reflected in 
the presence of so many distinguished 
leaders who came to the Capitol when 
Officer Brian Sicknick was honored 
with a lying-in-state ceremony in the 
rotunda. Among those leaders was the 
President of the United States, Joe 
Biden, and Dr. Biden as well. 
Let me end by returning to January 
6. That day was also the Feast of the 
Epiphany, a holy day of revelation in 
the church. It remains my hope that 
that day of violence will provide a rev-
elation of healing for our Nation. 
In a spirit of healing, that evening, 
as the House returned to the Chamber 
to complete our duty to the Constitu-
tion and to the American people to 
validate the election, I invoked the 
Song of St. Francis, the patron saint of 
the city I am proud to represent, San 
Francisco. The Song of St. Francis is 
the anthem of our city. 
Lord, make me a channel of Thy peace. 
Where there is darkness, let me bring light; 
Where there is hatred, let me bring love; 
Where there is despair, let me bring hope. 
We were blessed by the heroism of 
our law enforcement officers that day 
when they brought light, hope, love, 
and peace to our grieving Nation. 
The Congress promises the families 
that we will always remember, as we 
have remembered Gibson and Chestnut. 
Every year, we honor them for the sac-
rifice they made to protect this Capitol 
and our democracy. As we always re-
member and honor their service, with 
this legislation we will ensure that 
their heroism will be forever etched in 
the history of our country. 
I urge a huge bipartisan vote on this 
legislation. I thank the distinguished 
chairwoman for enabling us to bring 
this to the floor, affording us that 
honor to associate ourselves with the 
heroism of the U.S. Capitol Police. 
Mr. BARR. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 
1085, a bill to award Congressional Gold 
Medals to the United States Capitol 
Police and those who protected the 
Capitol on January 6, 2021. 
I thank Speaker PELOSI for bringing 
this legislation to the floor in a timely 
manner, and I thank the chairwoman 
of the Financial Services Committee, 
my friend, the gentlewoman from Cali-
fornia (Ms. WATERS). 
What happened to this institution on 
January 6 was horrific. This building is 
a working monument to our Nation’s 
Founding Fathers and our principles. It 
is a testament to the freedoms we hold 
dear. 
Mr. Speaker, the brave men and 
women who stood and faced danger on 
January 6 deserve to be recognized for 
their actions. Without their coura-
geousness, many of us here today could 
have been seriously injured or worse. 
When I say ‘‘us,’’ Mr. Speaker, I don’t 
just mean Members of Congress. I mean 
the staff; I mean the administrative 
personnel and peaceful visitors. 
Once H.R. 1085 is enacted, a Congres-
sional Gold Medal will be displayed at 
the U.S. Capitol Police headquarters, 
another will be displayed at the D.C. 
Metropolitan Police headquarters, and 
the third will be given to the Smithso-
nian Institution, so everyone who vis-
its D.C. will be reminded of the bravery 
shown that day. 
We have seen bravery from the Cap-
itol Police many times before. January 
24, 1998, we were reminded of Officers 
Chestnut and Gibson; a few years ago, 
on a baseball field, Crystal Griner and 
Special Agent David Bailey. These men 
and women are heroic. They put their 
lives in danger, and January 6 was cer-
tainly no exception to that. 
I speak for all of my colleagues when 
I say thank you. Thank you to each 
and every officer who was here on Jan-
uary 6. Your bravery will not be forgot-
ten. The U.S. Capitol Police and those 
who protected us on January 6 deserve 
Congressional Gold Medals. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support this bill, and I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Ms. WATERS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, every day the men and 
women of the United States Capitol 
Police protect the United States Cap-
itol. They protect us; they protect our 
staff; and they protect journalists and 
other visitors who come into the peo-
ple’s House. 
On January 6, 2021, the United States 
Capitol 
building 
was 
attacked 
by 
armed insurrectionists who attacked 
Capitol Police Officers and engaged in 
acts of looting and vandalism. 
On that day, we witnessed the cour-
age, patriotism, and commitment to 
service exemplified by Members of the 
Capitol Police, Metropolitan Police, 
and other law enforcement agencies, 
who risked their lives and sustained in-
juries as they sought to protect those 
trapped in the Capitol. 
We honor these officers who sus-
tained injuries in the line of duty, and 
we honor the sacrifices of heroes, in-
cluding Capitol Police Officers Brian 
Sicknick and Howard Liebengood and 
Metropolitan Police Department Offi-
cer Jeffrey Smith. And, finally, we 
honor Capitol Police Officer Eugene 
Goodman, whose quick thinking and 
selfless action undoubtedly saved the 
lives of many. 
This legislation authorizes the De-
partment of Treasury to mint three 
Congressional Gold Medals to be given 
to the United States Capitol Police, 
Metropolitan Police Department of the 
District of Columbia, and the Smithso-
nian Institution, so that we may never 
forget the valor and courage displayed 
by the brave men and women who pro-
tected the Capitol on January 6, 2021. 
I thank Speaker PELOSI for intro-
ducing this bill. This is one of the most 
important bills that we could ever put 
before the Congress of the United 
States, and I urge Members to vote 
‘‘yes.’’ 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H1373 
March 16, 2021 
Mr. BARR. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the 
balance of my time. 
b 1515 
Ms. WATERS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentlewoman from the 
District of Columbia (Ms. NORTON). 
Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, I rise to 
honor the police who are to receive 
Congressional Gold Medals: The U.S. 
Capitol Police, the Metropolitan Police 
Department of the District of Colum-
bia, and the other law enforcement 
agencies 
that 
participated 
in 
pro-
tecting the Capitol on January 6, 2021. 
The insurrection that day halted the 
final leg of congressional business de-
claring Joe Biden President of the 
United States. Yet, Congress was able 
to continue with its business that 
evening and early the next morning be-
cause of the help of the law enforce-
ment officers we honor here today. 
Then-President Donald Trump urged 
the crowd to the Capitol and delayed 
using his authority to deploy the D.C. 
National Guard in the country’s mo-
ment of crisis. As a result, I have re-
introduced a bill that would give the 
mayor of the District of Columbia con-
trol over the D.C. National Guard, and 
I am hopeful that this bill will be 
brought to the floor during this Con-
gress. 
It cannot be forgotten that the dam-
age done would have been worse were it 
not for the Metropolitan Police Depart-
ment, our local police, funded by D.C. 
taxpayers, who were was responsible 
for indispensable intervention when 
most Federal police forces did not ap-
pear, saving lives at the Capitol on 
January 6. I appreciate this recogni-
tion for the work of our local police 
force. An important way to reward 
them would be to ensure that the peo-
ple they protect in the Nation’s capital 
are given full and equal rights by pass-
ing the D.C. statehood bill. 
Congratulations again to the Metro-
politan Police Department of the Dis-
trict of Columbia, the U.S. Capitol Po-
lice, and the other law enforcement 
agencies on these congressional gold 
medals, which are well deserved for the 
protection they provided to our democ-
racy on January 6. 
Mr. BARR. Madam Speaker, once 
again, we are reminded of the dangers 
that law enforcement face every single 
day, and January 6 was one of those 
days. 
Our thoughts and prayers continue to 
go out to the family of Brian Sicknick, 
a true hero to our country, a great em-
blem of the bravery and heroism of the 
Capitol Hill Police. Again, he will be 
remembered fondly by this institution 
and by the American people for his sac-
rifice for freedom. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Ms. WATERS. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from 
Virginia (Mr. BEYER). 
Mr. BEYER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today in support of H.R. 1085, awarding 
three Congressional Gold Medals to the 
law enforcement agencies and officers 
who protected the Capitol during the 
armed assault on January 6, 2021. 
The bravery displayed by the U.S. 
Capitol Police, Metropolitan Police De-
partment, and other responding agen-
cies helped save countless lives that 
day. Two heroes who were there that 
day were my constituents, and ulti-
mately they lost their lives as a result 
of the attack. 
United States Capitol Police Officer 
Brian D. Sicknick died from the phys-
ical injuries he sustained while engag-
ing with the attackers on January 6. 
His face was drenched at close range by 
bear spray. 
Metropolitan Police Officer Jeffrey 
Smith, who responded to the attack at 
the Capitol from Georgetown, who was 
dragged into the mob and beaten, died 
by suicide just a few days later. His 
death reminds us that not all wounds 
sustained that day were visible. The in-
visible damage to those who engaged 
with the insurrectionists is very real 
and may last a lifetime. 
I mourn both of their losses deeply. 
We must ensure that we honor the sac-
rifices they and others made. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to support this bill to award 
the gold medals to the U.S. Capitol and 
Metropolitan Police Departments and 
to honor the courage shown by those 
who protected us on January 6. 
Mr. BARR. Madam Speaker, I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Ms. WATERS. Madam Speaker, may 
I inquire, through the Chair, if my col-
league has any remaining speakers on 
his side? 
Mr. BARR. Madam Speaker, I have 
no further speakers at this time, and I 
am prepared to close. 
Ms. WATERS. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself the balance of my time. 
In 
closing, 
I 
commend 
Speaker 
PELOSI for bringing forward this bipar-
tisan legislation, acknowledging the 
bravery displayed by the men and 
women who protected the Capitol on 
January 6. It is through their leader-
ship and decisive action on that day 
that many lives, including my own, 
were saved. 
I urge all Members to honor the sac-
rifices and courage displayed by mem-
bers of the Capitol Police, Metropoli-
tan Police, and other law enforcement 
agencies on January 6 by voting ‘‘yes’’ 
on H.R. 1085. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. BARR. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself the balance of my time. 
I, too, urge my colleagues to support 
this legislation and to award the Cap-
itol Police with the Congressional 
Medal of Honor. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Ms. 
CLARKE of New York). The question is 
on the motion offered by the gentle-

The question was taken. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the 
opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being 
in the affirmative, the ayes have it. 
Mr. BIGGS. Madam Speaker, on that 
I demand the yeas and nays. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to section 3(s) of House Resolution 
8, the yeas and nays are ordered. 
Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, fur-

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H1374 
March 16, 2021 
There was no objection. 
Ms. VELA´ ZQUEZ. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in support of 
the bill before us today, H.R. 1799, the 
PPP Extension Act of 2021. 
Let 
me 
begin 
by 
saying 
that, 
throughout my tenure on the com-
mittee, we have been able to set aside 
our differences and work together on 
behalf of small businesses. I am com-
mitted to doing that again this Con-
gress. Our small firms deserve nothing 
less. 
I want to welcome our new ranking 
member, Mr. LUETKEMEYER, back to 
the committee. I look forward to work-
ing with him this Congress to provide 
our Nation’s entrepreneurs with mean-
ingful assistance. I would also like to 
thank the ranking member for working 
with me in a bipartisan manner to fur-
ther extend the Paycheck Protection 
Program for small businesses that are 
still struggling. 
Over the past year, the PPP helped 
millions of small business owners re-
tain employees and meet business ex-
penses as economic activity slowed 
down during the pandemic. 
Seeing that value and impact, Con-
gress, on a bipartisan basis, extended 
the program multiple times, including 
a brief extension last summer and, 
most recently, through March 31 under 
the Economic Aid Act. 
We heard last week that some par-
ticipating lenders have begun to wind 
down their PPP operations in advance 
of this deadline, limiting the relief op-
tions available to entrepreneurs at a 
time when many still need help. 
I understand why this is. Lenders 
want to be able to focus their efforts on 
processing existing applications and 
work 
through 
thousands 
of 
holds, 
which remain outstanding on these ap-
plications. 
But I must stress that far too many 
small businesses, especially the small-
est of the small, remain in desperate 
need for relief. This is simply not the 
time to let this valuable program ex-
pire, especially as thousands of timely 
loan applications are still sitting in 
SBA’s queue. 
That is why I am pleased the bill be-
fore us today takes into account the 
arguments we have heard from all 
sides, both the lending community and 
the small business owners in commu-
nities like mine, who are still search-
ing for help. 
Specifically, today’s bill extends the 
application deadline to May 31, giving 
employers an additional 2 months to 
apply for PPP loans. It gives the SBA 
an additional 30 days to review, proc-
ess, and approve loan applications sub-
mitted by the May 31 deadline. 
This approach is supported by a coa-
lition of over 90 groups, representing 
virtually all sides of the small business 
economy, including local chambers of 
commerce, 
retail 
and 
other 
businessowner associations, and the 
lending community. 
I would like to reiterate my thanks 
to Mr. LUETKEMEYER and his team for 
their cooperation on securing this im-
portant 
achievement 
for 
America’s 
small businesses. I also want to thank 
two first-term Congresswomen on our 
committee, Ms. BOURDEAUX and Mrs. 
KIM of California, for leading the way 
at the committee level on these discus-
sions and for introducing this impor-
tant bill. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to support it, and I reserve the 
balance of my time. 
Mr. LUETKEMEYER. Madam Speak-
er, I yield myself such time as I may 
consume. I rise in support of H.R. 1799, 
the PPP Extension Act of 2021, as 
amended. 
The Paycheck Protection Program 
has proven to be a successful rescue 
vessel for millions of small businesses 
across the country. When COVID–19 
wiped out their operations, their plans, 
and their next steps, the PPP provided 
stability and confidence to small busi-
nesses in a time of darkness. 
With over two rounds of funding, the 
program has provided 71⁄2 million loans 
for approximately $687 billion. Accord-
ing to the SBA’s own statistics, the 
program assisted or saved roughly 50 
million American jobs from April of 
last year to August of last year. 
This has been a monumental task for 
the SBA and the Department of Treas-
ury. However, more work needs to be 
done to ensure this program can wrap 
up smoothly for small businesses and 
lenders. 
Currently, PPP loans are facing 
lengthy delays as error codes force 
multiple back-and-forth conversations 
between small businesses, lenders, and 
the SBA. It is these cross-checks that 
are creating uncertainty as to how the 
loans will proceed. 
Complicating this even further, the 
PPP is set to expire 2 weeks from to-
morrow, and the SBA is reporting that 
the end date will prevent all loans that 
are currently in the pipeline from 
being processed. 
b 1530 
Under no circumstances should an 
American small business that applied 
for a PPP loan have their loan dis-
carded due to a bureaucratic technical 
delay at the SBA. Simply put, if they 
completed their PPP paperwork on 
time, their loans should be considered. 
To correct this, H.R. 1799, the PPP 
Extension Act, provides a 30-day exclu-
sive window for the SBA to fully proc-
ess and consider all PPP applications 
that are received before the program 
concludes. 
Additionally, given the current de-
mand for the PPP and the billions of 
dollars remaining within the program, 
H.R. 1799 extends the application win-
dow for 60 days. 
As a reminder, Congress reformed 
and replenished the PPP in December 
with the Consolidated Appropriations 
Act, providing the program with $284.5 
billion. This funding should be reserved 
solely for American small businesses 
and should remain available to them 
through a program that is proven to be 
successful. 
I thank Chair VELA´ ZQUEZ for working 
in a collaborative manner with me to 
ensure the program remains available 
to the hardest-hit small businesses 
through May 31 and that the SBA will 
have enough time to fully consider and 
address all error codes. 
Additionally, I look forward to work-
ing with Chair VELA´ ZQUEZ to address 
other PPP issues in the coming weeks. 
I applaud the gentlewoman from 
California (Mrs. KIM) and the gentle-
woman from Georgia (Ms. BOURDEAUX) 
for working efficiently and in a bipar-
tisan manner to address these issues 
that are creating uncertainty across 
the Nation. 
I urge and recommend all of my col-
leagues to support H.R. 1799, and I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Ms. VELA´ ZQUEZ. Madam Speaker, I 
yield such time as she may consume to 
the gentlewoman from Georgia (Ms. 
BOURDEAUX). 
Ms. BOURDEAUX. Madam Speaker, I 
thank Chairwoman VELA´ ZQUEZ, Rank-
ing Member LUETKEMEYER, and Rep-
resentative KIM for joining me in intro-
ducing the bipartisan Paycheck Pro-
tection Program Extension Act. 
In 2 weeks, the Paycheck Protection 
Program, also known as PPP, applica-
tion period will expire, taking away 
much-needed help from thousands of 
small businesses that are struggling to 
keep the doors open and employees on 
the payroll. 
The PPP Extension Act would extend 
the application period for another 2 
months, ensuring that those small 
businesses can continue to apply for 
critical financial assistance until May 
31. It also provides an additional 30 
days for the Small Business Adminis-
tration to process applications sub-
mitted by May 31. 
PPP loans have provided a lifeline to 
mom-and-pop businesses across the 
country, including those in my dis-
trict, that are simply trying to survive 
an unprecedented health and economic 
crisis. 
In Georgia alone, the Paycheck Pro-
tection Program has provided more 
than 260,000 forgivable loans for nearly 
$19 billion since the program was cre-
ated last year. Without that money, we 
would have lost thousands more of the 
small businesses that make up the 
foundation of our communities. 
I hear every day from small busi-
nesses in Gwinnett and Forsyth Coun-
ties who are simply struggling to sur-
vive. This bill has its origins in a con-
versation that I had with local business 
owners Tony Rodriguez and his wife, 
Ann-Carol 
Pence, 
who 
own 
Lawrenceville’s Aurora Theatre. 
In early February, they reached out 
to me, concerned about the March 31 
PPP deadline. The Aurora Theatre is 
hoping to receive support through the 
shuttered venue operator grant pro-
gram, but due to some delays in

March 16, 2021 
launching that program, they were 
concerned that with the PPP applica-
tion period set to end on March 31, 
they could potentially miss out on crit-
ical financial assistance. 
While this was one of the first times 
I heard from businesses in my district 
about the March 31 deadline, it was 
certainly not the last. As I talked to 
my colleagues on both sides of the 
aisle, we realized we were hearing the 
same thing from small businesses and 
lenders across the country: They need-
ed more time to make sure we are 
reaching as many businesses as pos-
sible. 
Last year, Chairwoman VELA´ ZQUEZ, 
along with Members on both sides of 
the aisle, made significant improve-
ments to the PPP loans in order to pro-
tect small businesses. Recently, Presi-
dent Biden made changes enhancing ac-
cess to the PPP loans for the smallest 
of small businesses, many of which are 
minority-owned and women-led busi-
nesses, 
such 
as 
the 
ones 
located 
throughout my district. 
The data show that it is working: 73.5 
percent of the loans distributed in 2021 
are under $50,000, almost 5 percent 
higher than what that number was last 
year. Now is not the time to stop fight-
ing for the mom-and-pop stores, res-
taurants, and businesses across the 
country. 
Some examples of situations that 
this bill will address include a local 
pre-prepared food company that has 
not applied for a PPP loan because of 
how the loan amounts were initially 
calculated for sole proprietorships. 
Thanks to President Biden’s changes 
to the loan calculation formula, this 
business would now qualify for a for-
givable loan. However, because of the 
March 31 deadline, some lenders are re-
luctant to help out because it is such a 
short timeframe to evaluate and proc-
ess these loans. 
Another 
performance 
venue 
in 
Gwinnett County was pleased to learn 
that the American Rescue Plan we just 
passed would now allow them to access 
both the shuttered venue operator 
grant program and the PPP program, 
but now they are scrambling to get 
their loan application in by March 31. 
This bill allows additional time to 
get funding to the small businesses 
that need it most. This bill is sup-
ported by a number of leading business 
organizations, 
including 
the 
U.S. 
Chamber of Commerce, the National 
Federation of Independent Business, 
the International Franchise Associa-
tion, the National Restaurant Associa-
tion, and Small Business Majority, as 
well as over 90 additional organiza-
tions. 
Last, I also want to appreciate and 
point out that this bill is bipartisan. In 
this time of deep division in our coun-
try, we have all come together to do 
what is right for our communities, and 
I hope that we can build on this mo-
ment as we continue to tackle the 
challenges that face our Nation. 
I 
thank 
Chairwoman 
VELA´ ZQUEZ, 
Ranking Member LUETKEMEYER, Con-
gresswoman KIM, and the House Com-
mittee 
on 
Small 
Business 
for 
partnering to protect small businesses. 
I urge my colleagues on both sides of 
the aisle to support H.R. 1799, the PPP 
Extension Act of 2021. 
Mr. LUETKEMEYER. Madam Speak-
er, I yield such time as she may con-
sume to the gentlewoman from Cali-
fornia (Mrs. KIM). 
Mrs. 
KIM 
of 
California. 
Madam 
Speaker, I thank Ranking Member 
LUETKEMEYER
for yielding. I thank 
Representative 
LUETKEMEYER
and 
Chairwoman VELA´ ZQUEZ for their lead-
ership on the Small Business Com-
mittee. I look forward to working with 
all of them to strengthen small busi-
nesses across the country. 
I rise today in strong support of H.R. 
1799, the Paycheck Protection Program 
Extension Act of 2021. I was proud to 
introduce this bipartisan bill with Rep-
resentative 
CAROLYN
BOURDEAUX, 
Ranking Member LUETKEMEYER, and 
Chairwoman VELA´ ZQUEZ to extend the 
PPP deadline for new applications 
from March 31 to May 31, and to pro-
vide the Small Business Administra-
tion an additional 30 days to process 
PPP applications. 
Much of the importance of why this 
bipartisan legislation is needed was al-
ready spoken about, but I think it is 
important, so I am going to say a few 
words about the State of California 
that I represent. 
Forty 
thousand 
small 
businesses 
have closed in California during the 
COVID–19 pandemic, and half of those 
closures are permanent. The Paycheck 
Protection Program has been a lifeline 
for small businesses to keep their doors 
open as we safely reopen our commu-
nities. 
As the Biden administration an-
nounced five changes to PPP on Feb-
ruary 22, the looming March 31 dead-
line does not give our small businesses 
the time to adjust to the new guidance 
listed by the SBA. This bill provides 
small businesses and lenders with the 
time needed to process PPP loans and 
adjust to the recent changes. 
As a small business owner myself, I 
understand the challenges that small 
businesses face each day. Our bipar-
tisan bill provides Main Street with 
the opportunity to overcome the pan-
demic and thrive. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to support H.R. 1799 and put 
Main Street on a path to recovery. 
Ms. VELA´ ZQUEZ. Madam Speaker, I 
reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. LUETKEMEYER. Madam Speak-
er, I yield such time as he may con-
sume to the gentleman from Minnesota 
(Mr. HAGEDORN). 
Mr. HAGEDORN. Madam Speaker, I 
thank my friend from Missouri for 
yielding. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today in sup-
port of H.R. 1799, the PPP Extension 
Act of 2021. 
This targeted, bipartisan 60-day Pay-
check Protection Program extension is 
exactly the type of relief that Congress 
should be focused on providing. This 
bill contrasts sharply with the nearly 
$2 trillion partisan monstrosity of pro-
gressive wish list policies this body 
passed just a week ago. 
With optimism on the vaccine front, 
Governors around the country finally 
loosening their arbitrary restrictions 
on small businesses and schools, and $1 
trillion from previous relief measures 
still unspent, this bill is a responsible 
and appropriate way to ensure relief 
reaches our small businesses that are 
most in need. Our small businesses 
must have the tools necessary to com-
pete and contribute to our local econo-
mies as we move past this pandemic. 
Ms. VELA´ ZQUEZ. Madam Speaker, I 
reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. LUETKEMEYER. Madam Speak-
er, I yield such time as she may con-
sume to the gentlewoman from New 
York (Ms. TENNEY). 
Ms. TENNEY. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to support H.R. 1799, the Pay-
check Protection Program Extension 
Act of 2021. 
This bipartisan legislation will ex-
tend the PPP application period, allow-
ing the Small Business Administration 
more time to process loans. The PPP 
has been a vital tool for small busi-
nesses across the country and through-
out New York’s 22nd Congressional Dis-
trict. 
Extending the application period will 
give small business owners the tools 
they need to continue paying their em-
ployees and keep their doors open, 
helping to reopen our economy even 
faster. 
In my home State of New York, PPP 
has provided 140,000 loans, totaling $12 
billion, and saved hundreds of thou-
sands of jobs. PPP has been an effec-
tive, bipartisan COVID–19 relief pro-
gram, and I am pleased to cosponsor 
this legislation. It will extend relief to 
small businesses that need it the most. 
As a member of the House Small 
Business Committee, one of my top pri-
orities in Congress is to deliver tar-
geted relief to families and small busi-
nesses across New York’s 22nd District. 
H.R. 1799 does just that. It will ensure 
that the remaining $120 billion in PPP 
funds under the CARES Act gets to the 
small businesses that desperately need 
it. 
As we look to reopen our economy 
and get back to normal after a tremen-
dously difficult year, particularly in 
my district, where over 94 percent of 
the jobs are created by small business 
owners, this will make all the dif-
ference. 
I thank Chairwoman VELA´ ZQUEZ, my 
friend from New York; Ranking Mem-
ber LUETKEMEYER; and everyone who is 
joining on this legislation. I appreciate 
your leadership. As a small business 
owner, I am grateful. 
Ms. VELA´ ZQUEZ. Madam Speaker, I 
have no further speakers, and I am pre-
pared to close. 
Mr. LUETKEMEYER. Madam Speak-
er, I yield myself the balance of my 
time.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H1376 
March 16, 2021 
Madam Speaker, through no fault of 
their own, small businesses were forced 
to change how they operated in the 
face of COVID–19. Some adapted; some 
had to change their product lines; and 
unfortunately, some had to close. 
As a response, Congress created the 
bipartisan Paycheck Protection Pro-
gram. Its impact and effectiveness 
have been instrumental to the small 
business economy. 
With technical difficulties plaguing 
applications and a fast-approaching 
deadline, H.R. 1799 provides a targeted, 
straightforward approach to addressing 
these issues. 
H.R. 1799 will extend the PPP for 60 
days through May 31 and extend a 30- 
day exclusive window to the SBA in 
order to address all outstanding PPP 
applications. 
The program was always meant to be 
temporary 
assistance 
to 
struggling 
small businesses. The PPP Extension 
Act will provide small businesses and 
lenders the confidence they need while 
also creating a plan for a smooth con-
clusion of the program. 
As America continues to open up and 
recover, small businesses will drive our 
economic recovery forward. 
Madam Speaker, I would be remiss if 
I didn’t point out that this bill stands 
as one of the most impactful bipartisan 
pieces of legislation to advance in Con-
gress this year. I thank Chairwoman 
VELA´ ZQUEZ for her sincere efforts and 
hard work on this. I look forward to 
working with her, on a bipartisan 
basis, on other issues for the remainder 
of our term here. And I hope that this 
bipartisan product will serve as a 
prime example of what can get done in 
Washington when both sides come to-
gether and talk through the issues. 
Madam Speaker, I recommend and 
urge my colleagues to support H.R. 
1799, and I yield back the balance of my 
time. 
b 1545 
Ms. VELA´ ZQUEZ. Madam Speaker, 
with over 95 million COVID–19 vaccine 
doses administered as of last week, the 
country is finally starting to see the 
light at the end of the tunnel. 
Entrepreneurs are feeling more hope-
ful that if they can just get through 
the rest of 2021, that 2022 can be a year 
of growth for them. 
But, put simply, the small business 
economy is not there yet, and many of 
the smaller firms continue to report a 
need for economic relief. 
Today’s 2-month extension of the 
PPP application deadline, from March 
31 to May 31, will help small firms ac-
cess much-needed relief to meet their 
expenses and put them in a position to 
fully reopen as soon as it is safe to do 
so. The additional 30-day period will 
give the SBA the flexibility it needs to 
process and approve the loans sub-
mitted by the new May 31 deadline. 
Once again, I thank Ms. BOURDEAUX 
of Georgia and Mrs. KIM of California 
for their leadership on this important 
issue. 
I also thank the ranking member, 
Mr. LUETKEMEYER, for his unwavering 
commitment to our Nation’s 30 million 
small businesses and his bipartisan co-
operation on this bill. I look forward to 
working with him on legislation that 
will provide a retroactive fix for Sched-
ule C borrowers and also allow farmers 
and ranchers to use gross income to 
maximize PPP assistance. 
Madam Speaker, I encourage all my 
colleagues to vote ‘‘yes,’’ and I yield 
back the balance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentlewoman from New York (Ms. 
VELA´ ZQUEZ) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 1799, as 
amended. 
The question was taken. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the 
opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being 
in the affirmative, the ayes have it. 
Mr. BIGGS. Madam Speaker, on that 
I demand the yeas and nays. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-

SEC. 302. REPORT AND GUIDANCE ON UNREGU-
LATED CUSTODY TRANSFERS. 
The Child Abuse Prevention and Treat-

U.S.C. 5111 et seq.) is amended by inserting 
after section 201 the following: 
‘‘SEC. 202. REPORT AND GUIDANCE ON UNREGU-
LATED CUSTODY TRANSFERS. 
‘‘(a) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of 
Congress that: 
‘‘(1) Some adopted children may be at risk 
of experiencing an unregulated custody 
transfer because the challenges associated 
with adoptions (including the child’s mental 
health needs and the difficulties many fami-
lies face in acquiring support services) may 
lead families to seek out unregulated cus-
tody transfers. 
‘‘(2) Some adopted children experience 
trauma, and the disruption and placement in 
another home by unregulated custody trans-
fer creates additional trauma and instability 
for children. 
‘‘(3) Children who experience an unregu-
lated custody transfer may be placed with 
families who have not completed required 
child welfare or criminal background checks 
or clearances. 
‘‘(4) Social services agencies and courts are 
often unaware of the placement of children 
through unregulated custody transfer and 
therefore do not conduct assessments on the 
child’s safety and well-being in such place-
ments. 
‘‘(5) Such lack of placement oversight 
places a child at risk for future abuse and in-
creases the chance that the child may expe-
rience— 
‘‘(A) abuse or neglect; 
‘‘(B) contact with unsafe adults or youth; 
and 
‘‘(C) exposure to unsafe or isolated envi-
ronments. 
‘‘(6) The caregivers with whom a child is 
placed through unregulated custody transfer 
often have no legal responsibility with re-
spect to such child, placing the child at risk 
for additional unregulated custody transfers. 
‘‘(7) Such caregivers also may not have 
complete records with respect to such child,

GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. 
SCOTT 
of 
Virginia. 
Madam 
Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that 
all Members may have 5 legislative 
days in which to revise and extend 
their remarks and include extraneous 
material on the measure under consid-
eration. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Virginia? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. 
SCOTT 
of 
Virginia. 
Madam 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today in sup-
port of the Stronger Child Abuse Pre-
vention and Treatment Act, or Strong-
er CAPTA. 
One of the most basic responsibilities 
as public servants is to protect chil-
dren from physical and emotional trau-
ma of child abuse and neglect. 
Unfortunately, at the beginning of 
the last decade, we saw a disturbing 
rise in rates of child maltreatment, 
which coincided with the devastating 
opioid epidemic. Now the COVID–19 
pandemic is not only reaffirming the 
urgent need to address the growing cri-
sis, but also, across the country, fami-
lies are coping with severe financial 
and emotional challenges. State child 
protective 
services 
agencies, 
which 
have been chronically underfunded, are 
also struggling to help families while 
keeping caseworkers safe. 
Stronger CAPTA is a bipartisan solu-
tion we need to prevent child abuse and 
neglect from happening in the first 
place and to provide better treatments 
to address child abuse when it takes 
place. 
This legislation provides States with 
the resources they need to expand lo-
cally 
driven 
prevention 
strategies, 
which will help strengthen families and 
improve child protective services. It 
also invests in child protective services 
so that they can ensure that case-
workers will have the resources to both 
help children and keep themselves safe. 
The legislation also streamlines com-
munications between child protective 
services across the country so that 
critical information is not lost across 
State lines. 
Such a system would have likely 
saved the life of Heaven Watkins, an 11- 
year-old girl from my community, who 
tragically died because local child pro-
tective services had no way of knowing 
that her parents had a history of child 
abuse in another State. 
Finally, Stronger CAPTA builds on 
our bipartisan commitment to keeping 
families together when it is in the best 
interest of the child. 
Madam Speaker, we must do every-
thing in our power to ensure that our 
Nation’s children learn and grow in 
healthy environments. That is why, 
last Congress, both Democrats and Re-
publicans worked together to pass 
Stronger CAPTA with broad bipartisan 
support. Our bipartisan effort to pass 
this bill again this year demonstrates 
that, no matter our party affiliations, 
we can all agree that Congress must do 
everything we can to support children 
and families. 
To that end, I thank the sub-
committee chair, Ms. BONAMICI; and 
ranking subcommittee member, Mr. 
COMER, for their leadership on this key 
priority for our committees. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to support Stronger Child 
Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act, 
and I reserve the balance of my time. 
Ms. FOXX. Madam Speaker, I thank 
my colleague from Virginia, and I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today as a 
partner in important work to prevent 
and treat child abuse through the bi-
partisan Stronger Child Abuse Preven-
tion and Treatment Act, or Stronger 
CAPTA. 
Child abuse and neglect are heart-
breaking, immoral, and inexcusable. 
No child should ever have to endure 
pain and suffering at the hands of a 
parent or caregiver, yet, unfortunately, 
such behavior continues to affect mil-
lions of children across the country. 
This bill, Stronger CAPTA, is focused 
on doing what Congress can do to see 
that no child experiences the dreadful 
impacts caused by neglect and abuse. 
This legislation is the result of bipar-
tisan collaboration among members of 
the Committee on Education and Labor 
and will strengthen Federal efforts to 
recognize, prevent, and treat child 
abuse and neglect nationwide. 
While we have a variety of perspec-
tives represented on the committee, I 
believe this compromise will benefit 
children and families and maintain im-
portant protections for parents and 
faith-based providers of care to fami-
lies. 
Importantly, Stronger CAPTA not 
only protects children, but it also 
maintains and strengthens parental 
rights. While there are certainly in-
stances where intervention is nec-
essary, this legislation includes impor-
tant safeguards to limit unsubstan-
tiated or false reports and provides 
education to child protective service 
workers about the rights of parents 
and families. 
The first priority of the Federal Gov-
ernment should always be to protect 
and respect the family unit, while fos-
tering an environment for both parents 
and 
children 
to 
thrive. 
Stronger 
CAPTA gives a holistic view of child 
abuse and neglect, providing States 
with resources designed to strengthen 
families and keep children with those 
who love them most. 
CAPTA was originally enacted in 
1974, to support the development of 
programs aimed at prevention, assess-
ment, investigation, prosecution, and 
treatment of child abuse and neglect.

H1388 
March 16, 2021 
Stronger CAPTA seeks to continue this 
important work while putting more 
emphasis on prevention so that abuse 
and neglect can be stopped before it 
happens. 
Madam Speaker, the need to pass 
this legislation and send it to the 
President’s desk is urgent. According 
to the Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention, heightened stress, school 
closures, loss of income, and social iso-
lation resulting from the COVID–19 
pandemic have increased the risk for 
child abuse and neglect. 
The rate of child maltreatment has 
ticked up in recent years, devastating 
families and communities across the 
country and underscoring the necessity 
to open America’s schools safely. With-
out teachers interacting with students 
every day, an entire line of defense 
against neglect and abuse is lost. 
Additionally, due to the increased de-
mand on their services, State child pro-
tective service agencies are struggling 
to respond to the growing number of 
reports they receive each year. 
That is why we are here. Stronger 
CAPTA will help States address the re-
cent and devastating rise in child abuse 
and neglect by improving the quality 
of child protective services and build-
ing networks of prevention services de-
signed to strengthen American fami-
lies. 
It improves collaboration between 
States regarding accountability, sup-
ports the development of strategies and 
best practices for reducing rates of 
abuse and neglect linked to parents’ 
substance abuse disorder, and ensures 
that no child is removed from a family 
solely because of their economic situa-
tion or without a judicial order, except 
in cases of imminent harm. 
Furthermore, the bill seeks to pre-
vent and treat child abuse by engaging 
the community. We want to prevent 
abuse before it ever happens, and one of 
the best ways to accomplish that goal 
is to ensure that communities and par-
ents work together in the planning, im-
plementation, and evaluation of pre-
vention services. 
I believe every Member of this body 
wishes to live in a world where laws 
like Stronger CAPTA are not nec-
essary. Unfortunately, we do not live 
in such a world, but it is reassuring 
that during times of extreme political 
divisiveness, we can come together for 
the greater good. 
Madam Speaker, I acknowledge the 
hard work done on both sides of the 
aisle to author this bipartisan legisla-
tion aimed at protecting some of our 
most vulnerable citizens. Protecting 
America’s children from abuse and ne-
glect is something we can all agree is 
of paramount importance, and I am 
glad we could work together on such a 
meaningful initiative. 
Madam Speaker, I urge all Members 
to support the Stronger CAPTA, and I 
reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. 
SCOTT 
of 
Virginia. 
Madam 
Speaker, I yield such time as she may 
consume to the gentlewoman from 
Georgia (Mrs. MCBATH), a distinguished 
member of the Committee on Edu-
cation and Labor. 
Mrs. MCBATH. Madam Speaker, I 
thank Chairman SCOTT for yielding. I 
appreciate it. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today in sup-
port of H.R. 485, the Stronger Child 
Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act. 
Children are our future teachers, doc-
tors, police officers, and Members of 
Congress. It is our responsibility to en-
sure that they can live, learn, and grow 
up in a safe environment. 
In fiscal year 2020, in my home State 
of Georgia, it actually ranked second 
in the country for the number of calls 
to child abuse hotlines. 
That is why I was so proud to intro-
duce an amendment in the Committee 
on Education and Labor last Congress 
with my colleague, the gentlewoman 
from New York (Ms. STEFANIK), that 
would establish a national child abuse 
hotline. I am excited that same lan-
guage was once again included in this 
year’s Stronger CAPTA legislation. 
Madam Speaker, our bill will create 
a grant program for a national child 
abuse hotline, for the establishment 
and operation of a 24-hour hotline for 
victims of child abuse. Their families 
and caregivers, parents, youth, man-
dated reporters, and any other con-
cerned community member can call or 
text the national child abuse hotline 
when looking for immediate help and 
support during moments of crisis and 
moments of doubt. 
The 
COVID–19 
pandemic 
has 
in-
creased the risk factors that lead to 
child abuse, as millions are experi-
encing elevated levels of stress due in 
part to job and income loss, or even the 
loss of a loved one. Before the pan-
demic, teachers, social workers, and 
members of the community who regu-
larly interacted with children and 
youth were able to identify the in-
stances of child abuse and record them 
and report them accordingly. However, 
as we maintain social distancing to 
keep ourselves and our loved ones safe, 
it is much harder for those individuals, 
who once interacted with our youth, to 
identify such abuse. 
That is why we must continue to in-
vest in child abuse and prevention serv-
ices, such as the national child abuse 
hotline that Congressman STEFANIK 
and 
I 
have 
included 
in 
Stronger 
CAPTA. 
b 1600 
We do not yet know the full extent to 
which the COVID–19 pandemic will im-
pact our children, but we need to make 
sure that we are fully prepared to take 
care of them no matter what. 
As my esteemed colleague, Rep-
resentative FOXX, has just made men-
tion of, we know that additional 
stressors with COVID–19 pose more 
conflicts in our homes, and thereby 
adding additional opportunities for 
child abuse. Now is not the time to re-
duce funding or support for these well- 
needed services. Our Nation’s children 
need us now more than ever. 
And I am so grateful, even though I 
no longer have my child with me, I am 
so grateful to be able to encourage my 
colleagues to stand and support this 
well-meaning legislation so that I can 
take part in saving the lives and pro-
tecting children that may not even be 
my own. 
Stronger CAPTA is bipartisan legis-
lation that provides critical protec-
tions and resources to families and 
children across our Nation to prevent 
and end child abuse. With the passage 
of this bipartisan legislation, we are 
just one step closer to saving our chil-
dren’s lives. Stronger CAPTA is impor-
tant, not only for my home State of 
Georgia, but for the Nation. 
Together we must ensure the safety 
of our Nation’s children, they are our 
future. If we, as a Nation, do not pro-
tect the most vulnerable in the least of 
these, then who are we? Who are we in 
the eyes of the Nation? And who are we 
in the eyes of the world? Together we 
must ensure the safety of our Nation’s 
children. 
Madam Speaker, I encourage all of 
my colleagues, both Republicans and 
Democrats, to support this very vital, 
well-meaning and important legisla-
tion. 
Ms. FOXX. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Madam Speaker, no child should ever 
have to endure the pain of abuse or ne-
glect by a parent or caregiver, and that 
is why today’s work is so important. 
By passing today’s bill, we are fo-
cused on protecting the most vulner-
able citizens among us and give them a 
voice here in Congress. 
The bipartisan Stronger CAPTA bol-
sters prevention efforts and stream-
lines current assurances and require-
ments so States can focus on serving 
and providing treatment to children 
rather than spending more time filling 
out paperwork. 
Child abuse and neglect has no place 
in America’s homes, and it is my hope 
that today’s legislation will signifi-
cantly reduce the number of children 
who must cope with the devastating 
impacts of abuse and neglect. 
Madam Speaker, I thank my col-
leagues on both sides of the aisle for 
their hard work on this critical legisla-
tion. Again, I urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote, and I 
yield back the balance of my time. 
Mr. 
SCOTT 
of 
Virginia. 
Madam 
Speaker, I yield myself the balance of 
my time. 
Madam Speaker, I, once again, want 
to thank Ms. BONAMICI and Mr. COMER, 
as well as Ms. STEVENS, Ms. STEFANIK, 
Ms. SCHRIER, Mr. JOHNSON, and Rank-
ing Member FOXX for their leadership 
in advancing this bill. 
Stronger CAPTA will make signifi-
cant improvements in existing law by 
authorizing record levels of funding for 
prevention as well as treating child 
abuse, increasing accountability to 
make sure States are using the money 
effectively, and closing gaps in the law 
that will put vulnerable children in 
danger.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H1389 
March 16, 2021 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to support the legislation, and 
I yield back the balance of my time. 
Ms. MOORE of Wisconsin. Madam Speak-
er, I am pleased to rise today in strong sup-
port of the CAPTA reauthorization measure 
that is before the House today. 
I want to thank Chairman SCOTT and Rank-
ing Member FOXX for their leadership and for 
the bipartisan work on this legislation that has 
brought us to this point. 
This measure provides an overdue but crit-
ical reauthorization of programs authorized 
under the Child Abuse Prevention and Treat-
ment Act (CAPTA). These changes would, 
among others, address child abuse and ne-
glect related to families impacted by sub-
stance use disorders, racial bias in the child 
protective services system, and improving ef-
forts to combat child sexual abuse. 
The bill also contains language based on 
my Family Poverty is Not Child Neglect Act, 
which aims to stop families from being ripped 
apart not because of neglect or abuse, but for 
issues rooted in poverty. In these situations, 
services to help families and support them and 
their children are a much better approach than 
family separation. 
I appreciate the support from the chairman 
and bipartisan support and efforts of Rep. 
SUSIE LEE and Rep. BOB GOOD to ensure this 
language was included in the bill. 
I also worked with Rep. JOSEPH MORELLE 
and Rep. VAN TAYLOR to include the Study 
and Report on Marital Age of Consent exam-
ining the prevalence of forced child marriages 
in the United States and their impact on chil-
dren’s safety and well-being. 
I am pleased that we are taking steps to re-
fresh and strengthen our efforts, with states 
and local authorities, to protect our children. I 
urge my colleagues to vote yes. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. 
SCOTT) that the House suspend the

the ayes appeared to have it. 
Mrs. GREENE of Georgia. Madam 
Speaker, on that I demand the yeas 
and nays. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-

Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, fur-

Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010, shall be deter-
mined by reference to the latest statement 
titled ‘‘Budgetary Effects of PAYGO Legisla-

the Congressional Record by the Chairman of 
the House Budget Committee, provided that 
such statement has been submitted prior to 
the vote on passage. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from 
New York (Mr. NADLER) and the gen-
tleman from California (Mr. ISSA) each 
will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from New York. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
have 5 legislative days in which to re-
vise and extend their remarks and to 
include extraneous material on H.R. 
1651. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from New York? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
H.R. 
1651, 
the 
COVID–19 Bankruptcy Relief Extension 
Act of 2021, is bipartisan legislation to 
temporarily extend, until March 27, 
2022, the COVID–19 bankruptcy relief 
provisions enacted as part of the 
CARES Act in the December 2020 omni-
bus appropriations bill. 
Since the bankruptcy provisions of 
the CARES Act will expire next week, 
it is urgent for Congress to ensure that 
families and small businesses do not 
lose access to these economic lifelines. 
These provisions were enacted last 
year to provide critical relief to fami-
lies and small businesses forced into 
bankruptcy because of the ongoing 
pandemic. For example, they help en-
sure that Federal COVID-related relief 
payments are used by families to get 
through this pandemic instead of being 
seized by creditors. They also help peo-
ple stay in their homes and ensure that 
their utilities are not shut off. 
In addition, these provisions protect 
individuals and creditors alike from 
the effects of the pandemic derailing 
the 
court-ordered 
repayment 
plans 
that promise a way out of chapter 13 
bankruptcy. 
They will also allow more small busi-
nesses 
to 
take 
advantage 
of 
the 
streamlined process established by the 
Small Business Reorganization Act. 
Extending these necessary protec-
tions until March of next year will pro-
vide much-needed certainty that the 
bankruptcy system will remain respon-
sive to debtors and creditors alike dur-
ing this extraordinarily disruptive cri-
sis. 
I thank Mr. CLINE for his work with 
me on this bill, and for his work to en-
sure that small businesses have mean-
ingful access to the bankruptcy proc-
ess. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to support this urgently needed 
bill, and I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. ISSA. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Madam Speaker, this pandemic, ev-
eryone knows, has uprooted lives and 
caused untold destruction to families, 
to workers, and to small businesses. 
And many see the partisan behavior as 
destructive during this time, and they 
often do not see the bipartisan behav-
ior. 
Today’s extension, H.R. 1651, is an ex-
ample of bipartisan behavior on behalf 
of the American people. Repeated and 
lengthy government shutdowns in re-
sponse to the pandemic have dev-
astated the ability of millions to work, 
pay bills, and support their families, 
and keep their small businesses afloat. 
In my home State of California, the 
restaurant industry has seen more than 
one out of four restaurants shutter 
their doors forever. 
In 2020, Congress passed five bipar-
tisan 
COVID 
relief 
packages. 
The 
CARES Act allowed a variety of tem-
porary relief measures for families and 
small businesses. When it was passed, 
we believed that, in fact, once the vac-
cine was available, that we would be 
able to put this behind us. But today, 
when over 10 percent of Americans 
have received a vaccine, we now know 
that the road to full recovery is longer 
ahead of us even after we begin going 
to work. 
So allowing small businesses to file 
chapter 11 bankruptcy by increasing 
the maximum debt ceiling, excluding 
Federal COVID relief payments from 
income 
calculations, 
and 
allowing 
debtors to file chapter 13 to modify 
their payment plans are only some of 
the critical items that the CARES Act 
did. Today we are making sure these 
will continue until March of 2022. 
This bill also extends through 2022 
bankruptcy relief provisions included 
in the December 2020 COVID relief 
package. This extension will provide

individuals and businesses with cer-
tainty and simplicity as they look at 
an economic recovery that, although it 
is underway, may be long. 
Enacting this bill will assist debtors 
and businesses of all sorts, as Ameri-
cans and their firms continue to ad-
dress economic realities. This bill is bi-
partisan, and the bill recognizes that 
even businesses which have remained 
up and running often find themselves 
in a ripple effect of other bankruptcies 
or failures by companies that have 
been shut down. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
I 
strongly 
rec-
ommend the passage of this bill, and I 
reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. ISSA. Madam Speaker, I yield 3 
minutes to the gentleman from Vir-
ginia (Mr. CLINE), one of the coauthors 
of this bill. 
Mr. CLINE. Madam Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman from California, my 
friend, for his work on this issue, and I 
thank the chairman for his work on 
this issue and their great leadership on 
this important initiative. 
Madam Speaker, in 2010, the National 
Bankruptcy Conference Small Business 
Working Group released and presented 
to Congress a report that identified a 
problem regarding small businesses and 
the bankruptcy law, and recommended 
amendments to the code to add a new 
chapter for small business reorganiza-
tions. 
As a result of this recommendation, I 
introduced the Small Business Reorga-
nization Act, which was signed into 
law in August of 2019, and I am pleased 
to say it has been a great success for 
small businesses. 
It is my understanding that 80 per-
cent of small business debtors have 
chosen to proceed under subchapter V, 
and preliminary data indicates that 
these cases are achieving confirmation 
far more often than small businesses 
who filed prior to SBRA. 
However, the Small Business Reorga-
nization 
Act 
implemented 
only 
a 
month before the COVID–19 pandemic 
caused the State-mandated temporary 
closure of thousands of businesses. 
b 1615 
Seeing the need to ensure that this 
new 
lifeline 
would 
be 
even 
more 
impactful, the CARES Act passed in 
March 2020 increased the amount of 
debt a business can have to be eligible 
for small business bankruptcy proce-
dures from $2.7 million to $7.5 million 
and allowed debtors experiencing hard-
ship because of COVID–19 to modify 
bankruptcy reorganization plans en-
tered into before the law was enacted. 
I have heard from bankruptcy judges 
and lawyers in the Western District of 
Virginia who have said that their expe-
rience with the Small Business Reorga-
nization Act has been extremely posi-
tive. According to the American Bank-
ruptcy Institute, as of last Sunday, 
1,651 cases have been filed. 
In addition, according to the Federal 
Judicial Center’s Integrated Database, 
as of September 30, 2020, there were 759 
subchapter V cases filed in the 6 
months from the time the debt limit 
was raised to the end of fiscal year 
2020, with information on liabilities 
available for 548 of these cases. Of 
those, 28 percent involved debtors 
whose liabilities exceeded the original 
limit of $2.7 million. These debtors 
would not have been eligible for sub-
chapter V without the temporary in-
crease provided by the CARES Act. 
Without this bill to keep the debt 
limit at $7.5 million for another year 
while we continue to navigate this pan-
demic, about 30 percent of businesses 
that would choose to use it would no 
longer be eligible. 
Preservation of the business benefits 
both the creditor, which should receive 
a higher recovery because of the debt-
or’s restructuring than they would if 
the business liquidated, and the debtor, 
who will now be able to remain in busi-
ness rather than liquidating. 
Our districts depend on their small 
businesses. They are hotels, conven-
ience stores, restaurants, and phar-
macies. Those who endeavor to open 
and run a small business are proud of 
their work and their standing in our 
communities. 
Unfortunately, they also take on a 
sometimes-insurmountable 
financial 
burden. As we have seen over the last 
year, when they are forced to close, it 
has a great impact on the rest of us. 
That is why the year-end spending and 
relief package omitted recovery rebate 
payments from bankruptcy estates and 
blocked utilities from stopping or de-
nying service to some individuals in 
bankruptcy. This bill would extend 
those provisions by 3 months but 
wouldn’t affect other provisions in that 
law that are already scheduled to ex-
pire later in 2022. 
I am proud to have introduced this 
legislation along with Chairman NAD-
LER to support our small businesses 
and our families, and I urge its pas-
sage. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
have no further speakers. 
Mr. ISSA. Madam Speaker, both 
sides of the aisle are united behind this 
good, sensible extension of law. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
I 
strongly 
rec-
ommend that all of our Members vote 
for it, and I yield back the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, this 
bill will provide critical relief to the 
small businesses and families forced 
into bankruptcy because of the ongoing 
pandemic. These provisions help make 
sure that the pandemic does not derail 
the path to a fresh start that the bank-
ruptcy code promises for individuals 
and businesses alike. 
As Mr. ISSA said, this is bipartisan 
legislation. I am aware of no opposition 
to it whatsoever. 
Madam Speaker, I hope all of my col-
leagues will support this urgently 
needed bill, and I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from New York (Mr. 
NADLER) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 1651, as 
amended. 
The question was taken. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the 
opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being 
in the affirmative, the ayes have it. 
Mrs. GREENE of Georgia. Madam 
Speaker, on that I demand the yeas 
and nays. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to section 3(s) of House Resolution 
8, the yeas and nays are ordered. 
Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, fur-
ther proceedings on this motion are

titled ‘‘Budgetary Effects of PAYGO Legisla-
tion’’ for this Act, submitted for printing in 
the Congressional Record by the Chairman of 
the House Budget Committee, provided that 
such statement has been submitted prior to 
the vote on passage. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from 
New York (Mr. NADLER) and the gen-
tleman from California (Mr. ISSA) each 
will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from New York. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
have 5 legislative days to revise and ex-
tend their remarks and include extra-
neous material on H.R. 1652. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from New York? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, the VOCA Fix to 
Sustain the Crime Victims Fund Act 
would support vital victim service pro-
grams by preventing future cuts to al-
ready diminished Federal victim serv-
ice grants. 
Grants under the Victims of Crime 
Act, or VOCA, are the primary source 
of Federal funding for thousands of vic-
tim service providers around the coun-
try, including programs serving vic-
tims of domestic violence, sexual as-
sault, child abuse, trafficking, and 
drunk driving. VOCA grants also fund 
victim compensation, including paying 
medical bills, covering lost wages, and 
paying for funeral costs. 
These critical grants are not tax-
payer-funded. Instead, they are paid 
out of the Crime Victims Fund, or 
CVF, which is funded, in turn, through 
Federal criminal fines, forfeited bail 
bonds, penalties, and special assess-
ments collected by U.S. Attorneys’ Of-
fices, Federal U.S. courts, and the Fed-
eral Bureau of Prisons. 
Over the past several years, however, 
deposits into the CVF have dropped 
significantly, leading to corresponding 
cuts in grants to victim service pro-
viders. This is, in part, because the 
Federal Government has increased its 
reliance in recent years on deferred 
prosecution and nonprosecution agree-
ments, the penalties from which are 
not deposited into the CVF. 
This legislation would shore up fund-
ing for this critical fund by requiring 
DOJ to deposit penalties from these de-
ferred prosecution and nonprosecution 
agreements into the CVF, in addition 
to the funds currently deposited from 
other sources. 
Not only does this legislation ensure 
the CVF is more financially stable, it 
would also make much-needed im-
provements to victim compensation 
and services. For example, it would in-
crease the statutory amount awarded 
to victim compensation programs, and 
it expands the range of victims eligible 
for compensation. It also allows States 
to request a no-cost extension from the 
Attorney General, as allowed for other 
Department of Justice formula grant 
programs, to ensure that States can 
thoughtfully and effectively distribute 
victim service grants without being pe-
nalized. 
Other improvements include waiving 
matching requirements for the dura-
tion of the COVID–19 crisis, plus 1 addi-
tional year, and additional discretion 
for the States which administer VOCA 
funds to further waive matching re-
quirements once this initial waiver pe-
riod expires. 
All of these provisions would sub-
stantially improve the program’s effec-
tiveness and would enable it to offer 
more services to more people. 
I want to thank the gentleman from 
Pennsylvania (Mr. FITZPATRICK), the 
gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. JACKSON 
LEE), and the other bipartisan cospon-
sors of this important legislation for 
their support. I also want to thank our 
colleagues in the Senate, including 
Senator DURBIN, the lead sponsor, and 
Senator GRAHAM, for their efforts to 
pass this bill in that Chamber as well. 
This bipartisan and bicameral legis-
lation ensures that programs and serv-
ices assisting victims of crime are fully 
funded and are better-supported, with 
no new taxpayer dollars. 
Madam Speaker, I urge all of my col-
leagues to support this legislation, and 
I reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. ISSA. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Madam Speaker, so often, we hear 
criminals should pay for what they 
have done wrong. This is exactly what 
the Victims of Crime Act has done. 
Since 1984, it has provided the ability 
to collect fines and fees against those 
very perpetrators and apply it toward 
the solution and, in fact, the remedi-
ation of the damage they have done. No 
amount of money makes up for the 
crimes they have committed, but cer-
tainly, this goes a long way. 
Today, we are dealing with the tend-
ency within Article II, within the exec-
utive branch, that when money is 
available, to see if they can’t move it 
to where they would like to spend it 
rather than the clear intent of Con-
gress. 
I would like to thank Chairman NAD-
LER and Congresswoman WAGNER for 
their work on making sure that this 
bill does just that. It puts the money 
back where it was originally intended. 
For instance, VOCA supports shelters 
for victims of domestic violence, which 
affects more than 12 million adults 
each year. VOCA funding is also used 
to support services for victims of child 
abuse and sexual assaults. 
In all, more than 6,000 organizations 
nationwide are funded through this 
act. However, because funding has fluc-
tuated and at times has been diverted 
by the Department of Justice, this, in 
fact, will both increase and stabilize 
those funds. 
Over the years, Congress has adjusted 
funding flowing in and out of this ac-
count in an attempt to create cer-
tainty for support for these programs. 
Unfortunately, we haven’t always suc-
ceeded, and I am not without some rec-
ognition that today will not be the last 
time we come back to say that Con-
gress, on a completely nonpartisan 
basis, really means it: These penalties 
and fines need to get to the organiza-
tions that deal with the victims. 
Today’s bill will do just that. We 
stand, on a bipartisan basis, ready to 
ensure that we do that again. 
Madam Speaker, I would like to 
thank the chairman, Congresswoman 
WAGNER, and all the others who worked 
so diligently on this bill. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman 
from Texas (Ms. JACKSON LEE).

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H1392 
March 16, 2021 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, 
across America, we can hear the cries 
of those who have been victims of 
crime. It is not in any way distin-
guished by communities, race, age, or 
sex. It prevails in our society. 
I am reminded of the tragedy of two 
brothers on a crime spree killing a man 
and kidnapping a woman. Those are 
victims of crimes. Their families are 
victims of crimes. 
I can assure you, Madam Speaker, 
that we stand collectively, as Members 
of Congress, recognizing that VOCA is 
crucial to responding to restorative 
justice for victims. 
The Federal grants used to support 
victim services through VOCA have de-
creased significantly over the past sev-
eral years. Further drastic cuts to 
VOCA funding are expected as the non-
taxpayer-funded pool from which these 
grants originated, the Crime Victims 
Fund, is running dry. 
I am delighted to be an original co-
sponsor with Chairman NADLER, Mr. 
FITZPATRICK, and Ms. SCANLON, and to 
have 
worked 
with 
Congresswoman 
WAGNER over the years on this very im-
portant legislation. 
Further drastic cuts to VOCA are ex-
pected as the nontaxpayer-funded pool 
from which these grants originate, the 
Crime Victims Fund, is running dry. 
The Crime Victims Fund serves as an 
example of true justice because the 
money used to support victims comes, 
not from taxpayer dollars but, rather, 
from the criminal fines and penalties 
paid by federally convicted offenders. 
The Crime Victims Fund has shrunk 
rapidly in recent years and continues 
to decline because, rather than pros-
ecuting cases, the Department of Jus-
tice increasingly settles cases through 
deferred prosecution and nonprosecu-
tion agreements, and the monetary 
penalties associated with these agree-
ments are deposited in the Treasury 
rather than the Crime Victims Fund. 
We don’t want to pit one form of re-
form against one great need. These 
agreements may diminish the ability 
of VOCA to be funded because of the 
lack of dollars going into the fund. The 
crimes for which these penalties are 
derived are the same whether they are 
prosecuted or settled, and the funding 
should be given to serve victims. 
The VOCA Fix Act of 2021 fixes this 
by ensuring that monetary penalties 
associated 
with 
deferred 
and 
non-
prosecution agreements go into the 
Crime Victims Fund instead of into the 
Treasury. It is common sense. Victims 
are outcrying their need for relief. 
This simple fix will prevent future 
funding cuts that jeopardize programs’ 
abilities to serve their communities 
and will help address the many growing 
and unmet needs of victims and sur-
vivors, including survivors of domestic 
violence. 
We will be on the floor tomorrow 
with the opportunity to vote on the re-
authorization of the Violence Against 
Women Act. There are countless exam-
ples in domestic violence, stalking, 
sexual assault, and sex trafficking that 
show that victims are in need. Victims 
are elders, victims are young, victims 
are families, and victims are mothers 
and fathers. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Ms. SE-
WELL). The time of the gentlewoman 
has expired. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield the gentlewoman an additional 1 
minute. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. We are doing so 
because we recognize the urgency and 
dire need faced by victims and sur-
vivors throughout this country during 
a pinnacle moment caused by the pan-
demic. 
The numbers of domestic violence 
have gone up in cities like Houston and 
San Antonio and in States like Oregon 
and New York. We should recognize 
that cooperation on this legislation, in 
terms of improving the funding, is ab-
solutely crucial. 
Without the VOCA fix of 2021, sur-
vivors of domestic violence and sexual 
assault will inevitably lose access to 
victim support services. It is leaving 
victims and survivors without options 
for safety and valuable opportunities 
to help them in their victimization if 
we don’t fund this and change this 
process. 
The VOCA fix will rebuild lives, and 
it will save the lives of children who 
have been impacted by violence against 
their family members. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of 
H.R. 1652, or the ‘‘VOCA Fix Act of 2021,’’ a 
critical piece of legislation designed to curtail 
and prevent future cuts to an already dimin-
ished federal victim service grants program. 
This legislation must pass, because VOCA 
grants provides compensation to victims of 
crime at critical moments of desperate need. 
VOCA funds could help compensate the 
only surviving victim of Robert Lee Haskell 
who, driven by vengeance, fatally shot six 
members of his ex-wife’s family in Texas, in-
cluding four children. 
The survivor of Haskell’s rampage, a girl of 
only fifteen, was shot in the head and only 
survived by playing dead. 
VOCA funds could help compensate the 
wife and two children of a man killed in a 
home intrusion in Harris County, Texas, after 
an intruder entered the family’s home, ordered 
the wife and children to lock themselves into 
a room, and then proceeded to shoot their 
husband and father. 
VOCA funds could help compensate a 
woman who was abducted in Houston and 
forced to drive to an ATM at gunpoint, where 
she withdrew cash to give to her abductors. 
VOCA funds could help compensate innu-
merable victims and survivors of federal 
crimes, but only if we pass this legislation. 
VOCA grants have been vital in their sup-
port of traditional victim service providers 
across the nation, particularly for those organi-
zations serving victims of domestic violence, 
sexual assault, child abuse, trafficking, and 
drunk driving. 
VOCA grants also fund victim compensa-
tion, which helps survivors pay medical bills, 
missed wages, and in the most severe cases, 
funeral costs. 
However, the federal grants used to support 
victim services through VOCA have decreased 
significantly over the past several years. 
Further drastic cuts to VOCA funding are 
expected, as the non-taxpayer-funded pool 
from which these grants originate, the Crime 
Victims Fund, is running dry. 
The Crime Victims Fund serves as an ex-
ample of true justice, because the money 
used to support victims comes not from tax-
payer dollars but rather from the criminal fines 
and penalties paid by federally convicted of-
fenders. 
The Crime Victims Fund has shrunk rapidly 
in recent years and continues to decline, be-
cause rather than prosecuting cases, the De-
partment of Justice increasingly settles cases 
through deferred prosecution and non-pros-
ecution agreements, and the monetary pen-
alties associated with these agreements are 
deposited into the Treasury rather than the 
Crime Victims Fund. 
These agreements deny funding to victim 
services, which is contrary to the spirit of 
VOCA: monetary penalties from crimes should 
go to serve victims of crimes. 
The crimes from which these penalties are 
derived are the same, whether they are pros-
ecuted or settled, and the funding should be 
going to serve victims. 
The VOCA Fix Act of 2021 fixes this by en-
suring that monetary penalties associated with 
deferred and non-prosecution agreements go 
into the Crime Victims Fund instead of into the 
Treasury. 
This simple fix will prevent future funding 
cuts that jeopardize programs’ abilities to 
serve their communities and will help address 
the many growing and unmet needs of victims 
and survivors, including survivors of domestic 
violence. 
VICTIM COOPERATION 
This legislation not only recognizes that it is 
the victims of crime that bear the brunt of the 
drastic cuts being made, but also that we must 
protect those victims that have the courage to 
come forward and work together with the au-
thorities to bring justice to their offenders. 
Victims who cooperate with authorities often 
fear for their own safety and face pain at re-
visited trauma, and this legislation recognizes 
that rather than putting victims in further dan-
ger, we create for them a safe environment— 
both physically and emotionally. 
Victims may be intimidated by law enforce-
ment or other government agencies, but if we 
want victims to fully and freely cooperate with 
the authorities, we must ensure that victims 
feel protected and that there is no risk of be-
coming retraumatized. 
We must also make sure that if victims co-
operate with authorities, then measures to en-
sure the safety of victims will be provided in 
our government agencies working in tandem 
with victim service providers. 
Tomorrow, the House will vote on H.R. 
1620, which will reauthorize the Violence 
Against Women Act (VA WA) of 1994. 
We are doing so because we recognize the 
urgency and dire need faced by the victims 
and survivors throughout this country during a 
significant moment of ongoing domestic vio-
lence caused by this pandemic and experi-
enced by both women and men. 
Although local victim services agencies are 
there to help, they are facing record numbers 
of clients as well as the economic con-
sequences of the pandemic. 
Without the VOCA Fix Act of 2021, sur-
vivors of domestic violence and sexual assault 
will inevitably lose access to victim support

services, leaving victims and survivors without 
options for safety and vulnerable to further vic-
timization. 
Madam Speaker, the time is now to deliver 
access to the services victims and survivors 
so desperately need during a critical moment 
when the need for victim assistance has sky-
rocketed, and programs are being forced to 
cut lifesaving services for victims. 
Yes, it will be the fair assessment of 
justice. That is what we are here to do; 
fair operatives of justice. So I ask my 
colleagues to support this legislation 
and to join us tomorrow to support the 
Violence Against Women Act, to recog-
nize that it is our job to promote jus-
tice. 
b 1630 
Mr. ISSA. Madam Speaker, it is now 
my pleasure to yield 5 minutes to the 
gentlewoman from Missouri (Mrs. WAG-
NER), who has done so much on this 
bill. 
Mrs. WAGNER. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman from California 
for yielding. A good friend in Congress 
for years, we are so glad to have the 
gentleman back. 
I also thank Chairman NADLER for 
leading this legislation, along with so 
many others. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in support of 
H.R. 1652, the VOCA Fix to Sustain the 
Crime Victims Fund Act. I am proud to 
co-lead this critical legislation, which 
will ensure that victims of serious 
crimes can continue to access the serv-
ices that they need to heal and rebuild 
their lives. 
The Victims of Crime Act, or VOCA, 
grants are the primary source of sup-
port for programs dedicated to sur-
vivors of domestic abuse, sexual as-
sault, trafficking, child abuse, and 
other very traumatic crimes. 
These grants are funded by Federal 
criminal monetary penalties, not by 
taxpayers. However, with the Depart-
ment of Justice increasingly seeking 
nonprosecution and deferred-prosecu-
tion agreements instead of prosecuting 
Federal crimes, VOCA grants are fac-
ing catastrophic cuts. 
In my own home State of Missouri, 
we are expecting a 25 percent cut to 
VOCA funds in the upcoming year if 
this bill is not signed into law. Mis-
souri law enforcement and victim serv-
ice providers, along with prosecutors, 
need Congress to enact this legislation 
so they can protect and care for their 
communities. 
If we do not act swiftly to stabilize 
the VOCA funding, thousands of Ameri-
cans will be unable to access lifesaving 
services. These programs have never 
been more important. The pandemic 
has put women and children, in par-
ticular, at an increased risk of abuse 
and domestic violence. We cannot leave 
victims without support during fright-
ening and vulnerable times. 
This bipartisan and bicameral legis-
lation will help those victims recover 
as our justice system prosecutes the 
criminals responsible, which is why I 
am also hopeful that when the Senate 
passes this, we will have the oppor-
tunity to actually make this law. 
I am grateful that the House is tak-
ing swift action to secure services for 
victims. Again, I urge my colleagues to 
support the VOCA Fix to Sustain the 
Crime Victims Fund Act. 
Mr. ISSA. Madam Speaker, in clos-
ing, I urge passage of this bill, I rec-
ommend that all Members vote ‘‘yes,’’ 
and I yield back the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself the balance of my time for 
the purpose of closing. 
Last year, all 56 State and territorial 
attorneys general sent a letter to Con-
gress warning us that the balance and 
financial health of the Crime Victims 
Fund is in jeopardy and urging that we 
act swiftly to address the problem. 
They explained any decrease in the 
funds available for distribution results 
in a decrease in the number of victims 
and survivors that are served, as well 
as potential loss of essential staff in 
victim service programs. 
The VOCA Fix to Sustain the Crime 
Victims Fund Act heeds their call and 
would ensure that this fund has the re-
sources it needs to continue delivering 
essential services to victims of crime. 
This important legislation is supported 
by more than 1,670 national, regional, 
State, territorial, and local organiza-
tions. 
I thank all of my colleagues who 
have supported this bill. I am aware of 
no opposition to this bill at all, and I 
urge all of my colleagues to support it. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from New York (Mr. 
NADLER) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 1652, as 
amended. 
The question was taken. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the 
opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being 
in the affirmative, the ayes have it. 
Mrs. GREENE of Georgia. Madam 
Speaker, on that I demand the yeas 
and nays. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to section 3(s) of House Resolution 
8, the yeas and nays are ordered. 
Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, fur-
ther proceedings on this motion are

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from California? 
There was no objection. 
Mrs. TORRES of California. Madam 
Speaker, today, the Rules Committee 
met and reported a rule, House Resolu-
tion 233, providing for consideration of 
H.R. 1620 under a structured rule. The 
rule self-executes a manager’s amend-
ment by Chairman NADLER, makes in 
order 41 amendments, and provides en 
bloc authority to Chairman NADLER. 
b 1645 
The rule also provides for consider-
ation of H.R. 6, H.R. 1603, and H.J. Res. 
17, under closed rules. 
The rule provides 1 hour of debate 
each, equally divided and controlled by 
the chair and ranking member of the 
Committee on the Judiciary or their 
designees for H.R. 1620, H.R. 6, H.R. 
1603, and H.J. Res. 17. 
The rule provides for one motion to 
recommit on each bill. The rule also 
self-executes a manager’s amendment 
by Chairman NADLER for H.R. 1603. 
The rule provides for consideration of 
H.R. 1868 under a closed rule. It also 
provides 1 hour of debate equally di-
vided and controlled by the chair and 
ranking member of the Committee on 
the Budget or their designees. 
Finally, the rule provides that H.R. 
232 is hereby adopted and extends the 
deadline for the committee funding 
resolution until April 22, 2021. 
Madam Speaker, we are here today to 
protect the vulnerable among us, to 
strengthen the foundation of our de-
mocracy, and ensure humane working 
conditions for the people who feed 
America. 
We are here to live up to our best 
ideals as a Nation by creating protec-
tions against some of the worst threats 
that a person can face, threats like do-
mestic violence. 
In the minute that I have been talk-
ing, 20 people in this country have been 
abused by their partner. By the time 
we are done tonight, that number will 
be over a thousand. 
As someone who worked as a 911 dis-
patcher for nearly 18 years, as someone 
who has been on the other end of the 
line from domestic violence, as some-
one who has heard gunshots silence a 
young girl’s screams for help, I am tell-
ing you, the thousand people victim-
ized while we are here tonight need and 
deserve our help. 
That is exactly what the Violence 
Against Women Act does. It makes 
vital new investments in prevention. It 
strengthens essential protections for 
the most vulnerable among us, includ-
ing immigrant, LGBTQ, and Native 
American women, and it improves serv-
ices for victims, prevents abusers and 
stalkers from getting firearms, and 
much, much more. 
VAWA is one of many vital protec-
tions we will discuss today, but it isn’t 
the only one. 
Madam Speaker, this September will 
mark 100 years since an amendment 
was first proposed for our Constitution 
to guarantee women equal rights with 
men. It finally passed Congress in 1972. 
This simple amendment, which reads 
in part, ‘‘Equality of rights under the 
law shall not be denied or abridged,’’ is 
being held up on a technicality. States 
took so long to sign on that the arbi-
trary deadline that was set by Con-
gress, this body, has passed, even as 38 
States have ratified the amendment. 
Congress created this problem, and 
Congress must fix it. H.J. Res. 79 will 
remove the deadline for ratification 
and finally allow us to ensure women 
are treated as equals to men in our de-
mocracy. 
The need for equal rights under the 
law is not debatable. Too often, we 
have seen the results of unfair and un-
equal policies for women. This bill will 
help end those injustices. 
As we strive to make our Nation a 
more perfect union, we need to con-
sider how we treat immigrants, too. 
Immigrants are the invisible backbone 
of this country. They are our family 
members, our neighbors, our frontline 
workers, woven into every aspect of 
the American fabric. 
Dreamers grew up in our commu-
nities. They pledge allegiance to our 
flag. They played in our fields, prayed 
in our churches, and worked in our 
stores. They want to contribute to the 
only Nation that they have ever called 
home. 
The American Dream and Promise 
Act helps them do that. It creates a 
pathway to citizenship for our Dream-
ers. And it updates our temporary pro-
tected status and deferred enforced de-
parture laws to prevent devastating de-
portations. 
The fact is, too often the contribu-
tions of aspiring Americans are left out 
of our dialogue about immigrants. But 
this pandemic has put a spotlight on 
just how vital they are. 
Without immigrants working our 
fields, your last meal would have 
looked much different. Without them 
enduring record-setting temperatures, 
facing threats of wildfires, and doing it 
all without proper PPE, the price you 
pay to feed your family would go way 
up.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H1395 
March 16, 2021 
Deaths among Latino farmworkers 
increased by 60 percent during the pan-
demic. They are sacrificing their lives 
to feed us. The question is: What are 
we willing to do in return? 
The Farm Workforce Modernization 
Act creates a pathway to legal status 
for more than a million farmworkers 
and addresses our future labor needs by 
modernizing our outdated system for 
temporary workers. This bill will give 
farmworkers the dignity and recogni-
tion they deserve, while giving our 
farmers the stability they need to run 
their businesses. 
Now, before I move on to another 
topic, I want to say something about 
my personal immigration story. Just 
like many other Dreamers, I was sent 
here by my parents to escape the vio-
lence my family faced in Guatemala. I 
know exactly what it is like to decide 
between the violence and poverty of 
staying or the dangers and unknowns 
of trying to immigrate here. 
What I know is that we cannot legis-
late a solution for immigration when 
we ignore the factors that drive it. 
Strongmen, 
narco-traffickers, 
have 
taken hold in Central America, and the 
rule of law is under assault. 
The organizations that once fought 
to hold corrupt actors accountable 
have been dismantled, and their former 
employees are now being pursued by 
those very same corrupt actors. Attor-
neys General, unfortunately, are asy-
lum seekers in our own country. 
We don’t just have a responsibility to 
help stabilize the region; it is impera-
tive if we are ever to stop the rush of 
people trying to come here. 
I will close by saying every policy I 
describe today is a policy I am truly 
proud of. Just like the American Res-
cue Plan did last week, Democrats are 
making clear, with our actions, exactly 
what our priorities are. 
It doesn’t matter how good our agen-
da is if we can’t deliver on the bills we 
pass. The one thing standing in our 
way right now is an inside-the-beltway 
term called ‘‘PAYGO.’’ If we don’t ad-
dress it now, it will trigger massive 
cuts. It goes without saying that this 
would be completely unacceptable at a 
time when Americans are in urgent 
need of more support, not less. 
Republicans passed legislation in 2017 
to avoid PAYGO, in order to provide 
tax cuts for the filthy rich, so they 
clearly understand the need to avoid 
draconian cuts. I expect them to join 
us in preventing them. 
H.R. 1868, the final bill we are here to 
discuss today, will do exactly that. I 
look forward to a fruitful debate on 
these bills. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mrs. FISCHBACH. Madam Speaker, I 
thank my colleague from the Rules 
Committee, the Representative from 
California, for yielding me the cus-
tomary 30 minutes, and I yield myself 
such time as I may consume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in opposition 
to the rule, a continuation of the 
Democrats’ weeks-long partisan push 
to fulfill their partisan wish list. 
First up is H.R. 1620, the Violence 
Against Women Reauthorization Act, 
which is a highly divisive distortion of 
the original Violence Against Women 
Act, that will jeopardize the safety of 
women. 
By extending services to men who 
identify as women and allowing them 
to utilize programs that were designed 
to protect vulnerable women, the bill 
puts the safety of women at risk. The 
bill expands the definition of domestic 
violence to include economic and emo-
tional duress, driving needed resources 
away from combatting violent crimes 
against 
women 
and 
promoting 
an 
unproven restorative justice approach 
instead. 
Democrats have told us again and 
again that it is time to rethink our ap-
proach to law enforcement. But the 
same Democrats who want to defund 
the police are now pushing this un-
funded mandate, to the tune of hun-
dreds of millions of dollars, upon law 
enforcement. That doesn’t help anyone. 
Next is H.J. Res. 17, which removes 
the established deadline for the ratifi-
cation of the equal rights amendment. 
As the deadline for States to ratify the 
ERA has long passed, the constitu-
tionality of this legislation is suspect, 
at best. Congress does not have the au-
thority to simply extend the deadline 
some four decades later. 
I also have concerns about this 
amendment radicalizing gender to en-
shrine pro-abortion rights in the Con-
stitution. I do not need a constitu-
tional amendment to tell me I am 
equal. The Constitution and Federal 
law already require equal protection 
for all Americans. 
If my colleagues on the other side 
were serious about the equal rights 
amendment, they would ensure that 
the process for adoption was done en-
tirely by the book, rather than saying 
‘‘good enough,’’ as they move forward 
in this questionable manner. 
Next, H.R. 6, the American Dream 
and Promise Act of 2021, will provide 
amnesty to millions of illegal immi-
grants, incentivize illegal border cross-
ings, and worsen the surge of illegal 
immigration we are currently seeing. 
The bill will provide green cards to 
criminal aliens at a time when the 
southern 
border 
is 
already 
over-
whelmed, costing taxpayers hundreds 
of billions more. 
H.R. 1868 addresses the very real 
budgetary consequences of last week’s 
massive 
partisan 
spending 
package 
being signed into law. While we can all 
agree that we should avoid cuts to 
mandatory spending that have been 
automatically triggered by this level of 
spending, there was an opportunity to 
work across the aisle on a bipartisan 
solution. It is unfortunate that the ma-
jority has chosen, once again, to forge 
ahead on their own with highly par-
tisan policies. 
For these reasons, Madam Speaker, I 
urge my colleagues to think twice be-
fore supporting this rule. We can do 
better for the American people. 
Finally, I want to address H.R. 1603, 
the Farm Workforce Modernization 
Act, a bipartisan effort to reform our 
agricultural worker programs to ad-
dress the workforce needs of our agri-
cultural community. 
While I appreciate the efforts of my 
colleagues, 
including 
my 
colleague 
from the State of Washington, Con-
gressman NEWHOUSE, and others on 
both sides of the aisle to negotiate in 
good faith on this legislation, I will 
point out that this bill is not without 
its flaws. It does not address the al-
ready high cost of the H–2A program to 
make it a more economical solution to 
producers. 
It introduces a new private right of 
action against employers that risks 
costly litigation that our producers 
cannot afford. These types of issues are 
why stakeholders, such as the Amer-
ican Farm Bureau, have concerns with 
this legislation. Make no mistake, a 
viable workforce for our agriculture in-
dustry is a national security issue. 
However, I would like my colleagues to 
recognize that, with the current lan-
guage, this bill is not the end-all and 
be-all solution for our farmers and 
ranchers. While this legislation may 
pass the full floor this week as it 
stands, I hope our counterparts in the 
other body improve the bill before it is 
sent to the President. 
Madam Speaker, I urge opposition to 
this rule, and I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
b 1700 
Mrs. TORRES of California. Madam 
Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gen-
tlewoman from Texas (Ms. JACKSON 
LEE). 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, 
I thank the manager of the bill for her 
leadership and the rule. 
Let me, first of all, rise in support of 
H.R. 6 because there are millions of 
young people waiting for this relief in 
the DACA promise. 
The American Dream and Promise 
Act is long overdue. These are nurses 
and doctors, these are hardworking 
young people, these are college stu-
dents who are ready to serve America. 
Let me also rise in support of the 
Farm Workforce Modernization Act for 
the many, many farmers across Amer-
ica who are supporting that and need-
ing that. 
And I don’t know who would be 
against making sure that there are no 
Medicare cuts as we proceed to give a 
lifeline 
to 
the 
American 
people 
through the American Rescue Act. I 
stand solidly behind that bill. 
But let me spend most of my time, 
Madam Speaker, on the question of the 
Violence Against Women Act, H.R. 
1620, and H.J. Res. 17. 
First of all, there is no divisiveness, 
and I really stand openly against that 
interpretation. Is there divisiveness on 
helping rape victims across America 
who, as President Biden has said, live

in States that are not blue States or 
red States, but they live with the 
scourge of domestic violence, one of 
the most dangerous calls that police of-
ficers make? 
In 2018, we could not get the Violence 
Against Women Act, which I wrote, to 
the 
floor 
because 
our 
Republican 
friends would not proceed. At that time 
there was a Republican President, a 
Republican House, and a Republican 
Senate. Nothing happened, and women 
suffered. 
My women’s center right now is 
teeming with women who are impacted 
by domestic violence during this pan-
demic. They are crying out for this leg-
islation, and they don’t see divisive-
ness. 
What they do see is enhanced legal 
assistance. 
What they do see is $110 million for 
rape prevention. 
What they do see is intervention, 
with training for men and boys. 
They see a space that provides train-
ing and refuge for culturally distinct 
women who are victimized who can go 
to a quiet, calm place and deal with 
culturally 
sensitive 
counselors 
and 
others. 
What they see is cooperation between 
the victim and law enforcement by pro-
viding and making sure that they have 
the kinds of resources and legal rep-
resentation that is necessary. No one 
goes 
without 
legal 
representation, 
whether they are immigrant or Native 
American. 
They see an enhanced response to the 
victimization 
of 
Native 
American 
women who, in fact, there are those 
who victimize them on their particular 
reservation or pueblo and then run off 
outside of that, and they are not pros-
ecuted. We changed that. 
They see the closing of the boyfriend 
loophole. 
They see the taking away of guns 
from stalkers. 
Yes, this is a lifeline. The Violence 
Against Women Act, constitutionally 
grounded, due-process protected for 
those who may be accused, but it is 
legislation that women have been wait-
ing for. 
This bill expired in 2018. We wrote it 
in 2018, we built on it in the last Con-
gress, and the amendments that were 
both Republican and Democrat are still 
in this bill because we believe in bipar-
tisanship, and it is a bipartisan bill 
with Members from the Republican 
Conference, who are in this bill in 
terms of cosponsors. 
As it relates to H.J. Res. 17, let me 
say that Congress has the authority to 
extend the deadline for ratification of 
the ERA. 
The ERA says that women do not 
have to live in discomfort and live 
under equality and live in inequality. 
They live in a Nation of equality, and 
they live in inequality in housing, in 
income, in access to credit, in employ-
ment, in many ways. Why are we con-
tinuing this in the 21st century? 
So what does H.J. Res. 17 do? It ex-
tends the deadline for the compliance 
with the equal rights amendment for 
the States to be able to reach the 38 
margin. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentlewoman has expired. 
Mrs. TORRES of California. Madam 
Speaker, I yield an additional 1 minute 
to the gentlewoman from Texas. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. It extends that 
time beyond the time that was last ex-
tended. When we extended that time, 
we extended it by majority vote in the 
United States Congress. 
A decision came out just recently 
about the fact that the deadline had 
expired, but what it did say is that the 
deadline was created by Congress and 
that Congress obviously has that au-
thority. 
When we researched this in 1978 in 
the Judiciary Committee, there was no 
requirement that that extension of the 
deadline 
constitutionally 
require 
a 
two-thirds supermajority vote. Simple 
majority. Are you going to suggest 
that women now should be denied the 
ERA when a number of States have al-
ready sanctioned this? There are some 
States that have rescinded, but that 
will be the jurisdiction of the United 
States Congress when appropriate. 
I ask my colleagues to support 
VAWA, H.R. 1620, and H.J. Res. 17, re-
moving the deadline for the ratifica-
tion of the equal rights amendment. It 
is time for VAWA. It is time for the 
ERA. 
Mrs. FISCHBACH. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from 
Oklahoma (Mr. COLE), the ranking 
member of the Rules Committee. 
Mr. COLE. Madam Speaker, I rise in 
strong opposition to this rule. This 
rule and the accompanying legislation, 
sadly, is not about passing law. It is 
about making a point. 
All five of the bills dealt with in this 
rule have not been marked up by any 
committee in this Congress at all, and 
all of them are filled with poison pills 
that are designed to make sure most 
Republicans will not vote for them, and 
they cannot pass the Senate of the 
United States. 
The two bills dealing with illegal im-
migration will not just help DACA peo-
ple, it will legalize millions of people in 
this country illegally. 
The measure on ERA, the timeline 
ran out for that 42 years ago. This mat-
ter cannot be reversed now. 
Frankly, the matter dealing with the 
budget, as my friend from Minnesota 
suggested, we said last week you are 
going to run into this problem, you are 
going to cut Medicare. There are bil-
lions of dollars of wasted spending in 
that reconciliation bill that could ac-
tually offset those cuts. We should be 
considering that. 
Let me turn now to the Violence 
Against Women Act, Madam Speaker. I 
have been one of the strongest sup-
porters of that legislation since I ar-
rived in Congress, and I particularly 
am pleased with some of the measures 
dealing with Native American women, 
particularly some of the changes in 
this bill that extend it to children, that 
extend it to Tribal law enforcement of-
ficers. Those are good changes. 
But there are other measures coupled 
with 
it 
dealing 
with 
the 
Second 
Amendment or dealing with, frankly, 
people that are not biologically female 
that will put this bill at risk on this 
floor and certainly in the United 
States Senate. 
Madam Speaker, none of this was 
ever designed to become law. Two 
years ago, we made that mistake. 
Three years ago, actually, a little over 
two years ago, in 2018, and none of the 
good things happened. Let’s not make 
that mistake again. Let’s reject this 
rule. Let’s modify these bills. Let’s 
send the Senate something it can work 
with and pass. If we do that, we have a 
chance of not making a point, but of 
actually making law that benefits 
every single American. 
Mrs. TORRES of California. Madam 
Speaker, let the RECORD
show that 
Oklahoma’s Fourth District has 146,168 
eligible Medicare beneficiaries that 
will be harmed if H.R. 1868 does not 
pass. 
Let the RECORD
show that Min-
nesota’s Seventh District has 152,451 el-
igible Medicare beneficiaries that will 
also be harmed if H.R. 1868 does not 
pass. 
Madam Speaker, I include in the 
RECORD an October 18, 2019, USA Today 
article entitled, ‘‘1 in 3 American In-
dian and Alaska Native women will be 
raped, but survivors rarely find justice 
on tribal lands.’’ 
[From USA TODAY, Oct. 18, 2019] 
1 IN 3 AMERICAN INDIAN AND ALASKA NATIVE 
WOMEN WILL BE RAPED, BUT SURVIVORS 
RARELY FIND JUSTICE ON TRIBAL LANDS 
(By Maren Machles, Carrie Cochran, Angela 
M. Hill and Suzette Brewer) 
Twila Szymanski lowered the scope on her 
rifle, took aim and hit a target in the dis-
tance. The shooting range is where she and 
her husband go to relax and forget the things 
they worry about, she said. 
Some experiences are hard to shake. 
‘‘To trust somebody you know after a sex-
ual assault happens . . . it has been so dif-
ficult to work through that,’’ Szymanski 
said. 
Szymanski, 40, has lived on the Fort Peck 
Reservation in northeast Montana since she 
was born and is an enrolled member of the 
Fort Peck Assiniboine and Sioux tribes. She 
said she’s been assaulted three times. 
‘‘I was a victim when I was 13, a victim 
when I was 14 and a victim when I was 34,’’ 
she said. 
Twila Szymanski is a lifelong resident of 
the Fort Peck Reservation. ‘‘Native women 
have told me that what you do when you 
raise a daughter in this environment is you 
prepare her for what to do when she’s raped— 
not if, but when,’’ said Sarah Deer, Univer-
sity of Kansas professor and author of ‘‘The 
Beginning and End of Rape: Confronting Sex-
ual Violence in Native America.’’ 
More than half of American Indian and 
Alaska Native women will experience sexual 
violence in their lifetimes, according to the 
Department of Justice. 
‘‘You talk to Native women who have lived 
their whole lives on a reservation, and they 
say, ‘I can’t think of anyone, any woman 
that I know who hasn’t been victimized in 
this way,’ ’’ said Deer, a citizen of the 
Muscogee (Creek) Nation of Oklahoma.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H1397 
March 16, 2021 
National data on sex crimes in tribal com-
munities is scarce, so Newsy spent 18 months 
focused on two reservations: the Fort Peck 
Reservation 
in 
Montana 
and 
the 
Fort 
Berthold Reservation in North Dakota. After 
analyzing exclusively obtained documents 
and conducting dozens of interviews, a stark 
picture emerged. 
Sexual assault investigations can fall 
through the cracks when tribes and the fed-
eral government fail to work together. Even 
for those few cases that end in a conviction 
in tribal court, federal law prevents most 
courts from sentencing perpetrators to more 
than a year. 
Survivors who come forward to report as-
saults often find themselves trapped in small 
communities with their perpetrators, and 
several said the broken legal system contrib-
uted to their trauma. 
The federal government has a unique polit-
ical and legal relationship with the 573 feder-
ally recognized tribes. The tribes are sov-
ereign and have jurisdiction over their citi-
zens and land, but the federal government 
has a treaty obligation to help protect the 
lives of tribal members. This legal doctrine, 
called the ‘‘trust responsibility,’’ goes back 
to the treaties the United States signed with 
tribal nations in the 18th and 19th centuries. 
The array of Supreme Court decisions and 
federal laws that followed resulted in a com-
plicated legal arrangement among federal, 
state and tribal jurisdictions, making it dif-
ficult for survivors of sexual assault to find 
justice. 
Sarah Deer is author of ‘‘The Beginning 
and End of Rape: Confronting Sexual Vio-
lence in Native America.’’ ‘‘A lot of times, 
when I try to explain it, people don’t even 
believe me because it’s so bizarre,’’ Deer 
said. ‘‘And the reason it’s bizarre is because 
there’s been this patchwork of laws that 
don’t talk to each other over the last cen-
tury.’’ 
ONLY ONE YEAR 
The tribal courthouse on the Fort Peck 
reservation is a small brick building. The 
front desk is lined with pamphlets about dat-
ing violence and sexual assault. 
‘‘The trauma that has developed over the 
generations . . . some of the assaults are 
generational, and they’re within the same 
home,’’ said Chief Judge Stacie Smith, a 
member of the Fort Peck Assiniboine and 
Sioux tribes. ‘‘Pretend it wasn’t there, and 
maybe it’ll go away, you know, the next gen-
eration, it won’t happen again. But it con-
tinues.’’ 
Smith wants to break the cycle, but tribal 
courts face major restrictions, including a 
one-year limit on sentences regardless of the 
crime and almost no jurisdiction over non- 
Indians. 
Stacie Smith is chief judge of the Fort 
Peck Tribal Court. ‘‘When you think about 
rape and you think about somebody who is a 
perpetrator of that kind of crime, and you 
think, ‘What do they deserve?’ one year 
doesn’t usually sound like the right answer,’’ 
Deer said. 
In 2010, the sentencing cap was expanded to 
three years per offense through the Tribal 
Law and Order Act as long as the tribes met 
certain requirements. Only 16 tribes have im-
plemented the three-year sentencing en-
hancement. 
Fort Peck is one of them. 
When the law took effect, there were no at-
torneys, no one with a law degree in the 
court system. 
Smith decided to leave her young daugh-
ters to attend law school hundreds of miles 
away. This would help the tribal court meet 
the federal requirements and give it more 
authority. 
The tribal court was able to hand out 
three-year sentences starting in late 2012. 
From 2013–2018, there were three sexual as-
sault convictions, but none of them had en-
hanced sentences. The longest sentence was 
still one year. 
‘‘We use the enhanced sentencing sparingly 
because we want it to have meaning,’’ said 
Scott Seifert, a member of the Comanche 
Nation of Oklahoma and Fort Peck’s lead 
tribal prosecutor. 
GOING FEDERAL 
Tribal court is not the only option for 
those seeking justice for sexual assault. In 
most cases, the FBI, Bureau of lndian Affairs 
(BIA) and U.S. attorneys’ offices are feder-
ally mandated to work with the tribes to in-
vestigate and prosecute ‘‘major crimes,’’ 
which include sexual assault. 
‘‘So if you have a rape case or a child sex 
abuse case and you do want to see that per-
petrator put away, the best possibility for 
you is that it will go federal,’’ Deer said. 
That responsibility falls to the U.S. attor-
neys’ offices, which have seen their funding 
and staffing in Indian communities cut by 
more than 40% in the past seven years, ac-
cording to the Department of Justice. 
Data Newsy obtained from the DOJ shows 
that the Montana U.S. Attorney’s Office de-
clined 64% of cases of sexual assault in the 
past four fiscal years. 
Kurt Alme is the U.S. attorney for Mon-
tana. The U.S. attorney for Montana, Kurt 
Alme, said a lot of cases are declined because 
of weak or insufficient evidence, ‘‘and it is 
something that has to be worked on,’’ he 
said. 
According to the BIA, tribal courts re-
ceived less than 5% of the funding that was 
needed in 2016. Law enforcement received 
22% of what was needed, and jails received 
less than 50%. 
Less than half of the law enforcement 
agencies that the bureau funds and oversees 
are properly staffed, said Charles Addington, 
director of the BIA Office of Justice Service 
and a member of the Cherokee Nation. 
In August 2018, Fort Peck tribal police had 
funding for 21 positions, but nine of them 
were vacant, said Ken Trottier, criminal in-
vestigations supervisor for the Fort Peck 
Tribes and a member of the Turtle Mountain 
Band of Chippewa. 
‘‘We have a hiring pool that is literally 
nothing here on the reservation, even though 
we open it up to off-reservation people,’’ he 
said. ‘‘There’s no houses for sale. No houses 
for rent. Where’s that person going to live?’’ 
Constant turnover and understaffing can 
lead to an under trained police department, 
Deer said. 
‘‘[The survivor is] waiting for help. They 
don’t know if help is coming. They don’t 
know if the help is going to be compas-
sionate and trained,’’ Deer said. ‘‘The system 
is not feeling like a safe, productive system 
to them anymore.’’ 
Big money but little justice Three hours 
east of Fort Peck, the Fort Berthold Res-
ervation in North Dakota sits on the Bakken 
oil basin and has an annual budget of $400 
million. The reservation is home to the 
Mandan, Hidatsa and Arikara Nation, or the 
Three Affiliated Tribes. 
Driving around the remote reservation, 
council member Monica Mayer pointed to a 
multimillion-dollar housing project that she 
said will soon have an aquatic center, base-
ball diamonds and mini golf. 
A $17 million public safety and judicial 
center was built, and staffing increased in 
the court system. In the past three years, 
the reservation has hired more than a dozen 
additional officers to help an understaffed 
police department. 
Monica Mayer is a tribal council member 
on the Fort Berthold Reservation. Despite 
this financial independence, the justice sys-
tem appears to be failing sexual assault sur-
vivors who report. 
‘‘At every level, we are not adequately 
functioning to provide the services that are 
needed in a critical situation,’’ Mayer said. 
The Fort Berthold tribal court does not 
have enhanced sentencing. The court sen-
tenced three people for sexual assault from 
2013 to mid–2018, according to court records. 
Sentences ranged from eight days to six 
months. 
The tribes’ relationship with its federal 
partners—the BIA, the FBI and the U.S. at-
torneys—is crucial to helping survivors get 
justice. Based on interviews and records ob-
tained from federal and tribal agencies, it’s 
unclear whether all sexual assaults on Fort 
Berthold were fully investigated by any 
agency in the past six years. 
The tribes are supposed to refer every 
major crime to either the BIA or the FBI for 
investigations. Both are charged with over-
seeing all major criminal investigations on 
Fort Berthold and will determine which 
agency takes the lead. 
The 
tribal 
criminal 
investigators 
had 
records of 66 sexual assault cases from Janu-
ary 2016 to September 2018. The BIA had 
records of only 10 investigations during that 
same time period. The FBI declined to pro-
vide any records. 
After Newsy asked about the status of 
these cases, Three Affiliated Tribes Police 
Capt. Grace Her Many Horses, a member of 
the Oglala Sioux tribe from the Pine Ridge 
Reservation, said she would do a case file re-
view. 
‘‘The priority for me, right now, is to go 
through those case files to find out what’s 
been declined, why, and is there anything we 
can do to make it happen,’’ she said. ‘‘I guess 
part of that is on me, too. I should know this 
by now.’’ 
Her Many Horses said she finished the case 
file review nearly a year later, but she did 
not provide the details of what she found, 
nor did she disclose whether the police re-
ferred all 66 cases up to their federal part-
ners. 
Exactly one week after Newsy’s last trip to 
Fort Berthold, during which reporters asked 
how sexual assaults and rapes are handled on 
the reservation, the Department of Justice 
and the BIA released a joint statement say-
ing, ‘‘A number of concerns have been raised 
about public safety and criminal investiga-
tions on the Fort Berthold Reservation.’’ 
Citing ‘‘the high rate of violence against 
women and children,’’ it said the BIA was in-
creasing the number of special agents from 
‘‘one to two.’’ As of the start of October, no 
second agent had started working on Fort 
Berthold. 
The U.S. Commission on Civil Rights 
issued two reports on funding in Indian com-
munities, one in 2003 and an update in De-
cember 2018, called ‘‘Broken Promises.’’ The 
report said, ‘‘The federal government con-
tinues to fail to support adequately the so-
cial and economic well-being of Native 
Americans,’’ and this ‘‘contributes to the in-
equities observed in Native American com-
munities.’’ 
TRYING TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE 
Twila Szymanski works as the deputy 
court administrator for the Fort Peck Tribal 
Court, maintaining records and stats. 
Szymanski reported only one of her three 
assaults—the one when she was 14. Her case 
made it into federal court. 
The defendant pleaded guilty in 1995. He 
was sentenced to three years’ probation and 
no prison time. 
Twila Szymanski is the deputy court ad-
ministrator for the Fort Peck Tribal Court. 
‘‘Justice wasn’t served, in my opinion,’’ she 
said. ‘‘He was back in the community quick-
ly, and I had to see him when this was all 
fresh.’’

Szymanski is confronted with the memory 
of what happened to her each time a case 
comes up and each time she sees her perpe-
trator in the community. 
She said she uses her position in the court 
to go through cases and stop them from 
dropping through the cracks, and she is run-
ning for Fort Peck associate judge in the 
election this month. 
‘‘When the system has failed you time and 
time and time again, you don’t feel empow-
ered,’’ Deer said. ‘‘It feels like a disconnect 
between this moment of ‘Me Too’ and the re-
ality of lndian country and sexual assault.’’

creating a pathway to citizenship for 
millions of people who entered this 
country illegally, while it does nothing 
to enforce our immigration laws or se-
cure our borders. 
You heard that right. This bill does 
nothing to enforce our immigration 
laws. It does nothing to secure our bor-
ders. And it does so as a record number 
of illegal immigrants pour across our 
Southern 
border. 
And 
yet, 
House 
Democrats are passing a bill that will 
further incentivize illegal immigration 
and will worsen the Biden border crisis. 
The numbers speak for themselves. 
Over 100,000 migrants were encountered 
at 
our 
Southern 
border 
just 
last 
month. The CBP facility in Donna, 
Texas, was at 729 percent capacity last 
week. Let me repeat that. That facility 
was at 729 percent capacity. 
And, alarmingly, CBP confirmed that 
four people were arrested at the border, 
three of whom were from Yemen, one 
of whom was from Serbia, and those in-
dividuals matched the names on the 
FBI’s Terrorist Screening Database. 
So despite my liberal progressive col-
leagues’ claims to the contrary, this 
surge is directly the result of the Biden 
administration’s decision to halt the 
border wall construction, to reimple-
ment 
Obama-era 
catch-and-release 
policies, 
and 
to 
cancel 
President 
Trump’s asylum agreements. 
This Chamber should work to address 
the border crisis going on, Biden’s bor-
der crisis. We should not pass legisla-
tion that encourages and rewards ille-
gal 
immigration 
and 
further 
incentivizes this crisis, yet that is 
what H.R. 6, in fact, does. This bill 
places the interest of those who broke 
our laws above the interests of those 
who followed them. 
It has no enforcement provisions. It 
includes loopholes to give green cards 
to gang members and criminals. It even 
puts U.S. taxpayers on the hook for 
grant programs to help illegal immi-
grants obtain green cards. 
Again, H.R. 6 would do absolutely 
nothing to address President Biden’s 
border security and humanitarian cri-
sis at the Southern border. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to vote ‘‘no’’ on the rule and 
vote ‘‘no’’ on H.R. 6. 
Mrs. TORRES of California. Madam 
Speaker, the situation at the border 
has nothing to do with the Dream and 
Promise Act. If anything, former Presi-
dent Trump’s attempt to eliminate all 
resources contributed to the crisis at 
the border. The Dream and Promise 
Act does not apply to future migrants, 
just those who were already in the 
country before 2021. 
This Dream and Promise Act has a 
very high criminal bar. An applicant is 
disqualified if they have any one of the 
following: A felony conviction, one 
misdemeanor 
conviction 
involving 
moral turpitude, more than two mis-
demeanors, or one misdemeanor for do-
mestic violence. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mrs. FISCHBACH. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman 
from Missouri (Mrs. WAGNER). 
Mrs. WAGNER. Madam Speaker, I 
rise in stark opposition to H.J. Res. 17, 
which would retroactively and uncon-
stitutionally remove the deadline to 
ratify the equal rights amendment. 
Ratification 
of 
the 
equal 
rights 
amendment will expand taxpayer-fund-
ed abortions and imperil basic pro-life 
protections that States have enacted 
based on the will of their people 
through their State legislatures. 
I am a committed defender of rights 
for women and girls, and I have led ef-
forts in Congress to end sex trafficking, 
address the rape kit backlog, and help 
women balance staying in the work-
force and caring for their children. 
As a mother and as a proud grandma, 
I want my sweet granddaughter to feel 
secure in the knowledge that she is en-
titled to the same rights and opportu-
nities as men. 
b 1715 
However, I cannot support this at-
tempt to circumvent the amendment 
process and enshrine access to tax-
payer-funded abortion in the Constitu-
tion by a simple majority vote rather 
than with the required support of two- 
thirds of Congress or the States. 
Congress has twice given States time 
to ratify the equal rights amendment, 
but the deadline has long since passed. 
While some States ratified the ERA 
after the deadline, others—up to five— 
have withdrawn their ratification. 
I strongly agree and associate myself 
with the late Supreme Court Justice 
Ruth Bader Ginsburg’s words when she 
made the point: ‘‘If you count a late-
comer on the plus side, how can you 
disregard States that said, ‘We have 
changed our minds’?’’ 
If Democrats want to test the long-
standing bipartisan agreement on lim-
iting taxpayer-funded abortions, they 
should follow Justice Ginsburg’s guid-
ance and start the process over, just as 
our Founders intended. 
I urge my colleagues to oppose this 
legislation. 
Madam Speaker, I would also like to 
set the record straight when it comes 
to the Violence Against Women Act, or 
VAWA. My amendment was removed, 
in a partisan fashion, from VAWA this 
Congress, 
stripping 
vital 
sex 
traf-
ficking funding for victims, for chil-
dren. This has always been included, 
and it was stripped out and not allowed 
in the amendment process. Also not al-
lowed was my PRENDA amendment 
that would have stopped sex selection 
in the womb taking the lives of young 
girls. 
Madam Speaker, I urge opposition to 
this legislation. 
Mrs. TORRES of California. Madam 
Speaker, my colleagues across the aisle 
are not supportive of provisions to pro-
tect LGBTQ-plus individuals in this 
bill, but LGBTQ-plus members of our 
community experience domestic vio-
lence, too. Abusers do not discriminate 
based on sexual orientation, and nei-
ther should this body. 
Legislators who oppose equality are 
trying to turn this into a debate about 
abortion to distract from the issue at 
hand. I would like to clarify that the 
ERA doesn’t include any requirement 
to provide specific healthcare services, 
including abortion. It is about equality 
under the law. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mrs. FISCHBACH. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentleman from 
New Jersey (Mr. SMITH). 
Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Madam 
Speaker, the most recent Marist poll 
found that 7 in 10 Americans, including 
nearly half who identify as pro-choice, 
want significant restrictions on abor-
tion. Yet, the ERA as written will be 
used in an aggressive litigation strat-
egy to nullify those restrictions, in-
cluding the Hyde amendment, waiting 
periods, parental involvement, wom-
en’s right-to-know laws, conscience 
rights, and the late-term abortion bans 
like the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban 
Act. 
NARAL Pro-Choice America has said: 
‘‘The ERA would reinforce the con-
stitutional right to abortion’’ and ‘‘re-
quire judges to strike down anti-abor-
tion laws.’’ 
The 
National 
Organization 
for 
Women said: ‘‘An ERA—properly inter-
preted—could negate the hundreds of 
laws that have passed restricting ac-
cess to abortion.’’ 
Abortion activists, Madam Speaker, 
successfully litigated using State ERAs 
in both New Mexico and Connecticut to 
compel taxpayers to pay for abortion 
on demand. 
Last year, Justice Ruth Bader Gins-
burg spoke on the legal impermis-
sibility of extending the deadline for 
ratification and said she ‘‘would like it 
to start over.’’ I couldn’t agree more. 
Madam Speaker, two leaders of the Na-
tional Organization for Women (NOW) wrote: 
‘‘During the 1972 ERA ratification campaign, 
several prominent women’s leaders denied 
that an ERA would apply to abortion . . .’’. 
Ever since, pro-abortion leaders have large-
ly ignored, trivialized, or denied the fact that

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H1399 
March 16, 2021 
activists plan to aggressively use the federal 
ERA as currently written in a litigation strategy 
to overturn all pro-life laws and policies includ-
ing restrictions supported by huge majorities of 
Americans. According to the most recent 
Marist poll (January 2021): 
7 in 10 Americans including nearly half who 
identify as pro-choice want significant restric-
tions on abortion, 
58 percent of all Americans oppose using 
tax dollars for abortion, 
55 percent want to ban abortion after 20 
weeks, 
70 percent of Americans oppose abortion if 
the child will be born with Down Syndrome, 
80 percent of Americans believe that laws 
can protect both a pregnant woman and the 
life of her unborn child. 
While I fundamentally disagree with abortion 
activists who refuse to recognize an unborn 
child’s inherent dignity, worth, and value, at 
least both sides now agree that the ERA as 
written will be used in court to promote abor-
tion. 
NARAL—Pro-Choice America said: ‘‘The 
ERA would reinforce the constitutional right to 
abortion . . . (and) require judges to strike 
down anti-abortion laws . . .’’. 
The National Right to Life Committee states 
that ‘‘the proposed federal ERA would invali-
date the federal Hyde Amendment and a state 
restrictions on tax-funded abortions.’’ 
As director of reproductive-justice initiatives 
and National Women’s Law Center senior 
counsel Kelli Garcia said, the ERA would help 
create a basis to challenge abortion restric-
tions.’’ 
And NOW said: ‘‘An ERA—properly inter-
preted—could negate the hundreds of laws 
that have passed restricting access to abortion 
. . .’’. 
Those laws restricting abortion include the 
Hyde Amendment, waiting periods, parental 
involvement, women’s right to know laws, con-
science rights including the Weldon Amend-
ment and any late term abortion ban like the 
Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act of 2003. 
Should the ERA be ratified without clarifying 
abortion-neutral language—to wit: ‘‘Nothing in 
this Article shall be construed to grant or se-
cure any right relating to abortion or the fund-
ing thereof’’—it is absolutely clear that abor-
tion activists will use the ERA as they have 
successfully used state ERAs in both New 
Mexico and Connecticut—to force taxpayers to 
pay for abortion on demand. 
By now, my colleagues know that: 
The Supreme Court of New Mexico ruled in 
1998 that the state was required to fund abor-
tion based solely on the state ERA and said 
the law ‘‘undoubtedly singles out . . . a gen-
der-linked condition that is unique to women’’ 
and, therefore, ‘‘violates the Equal Rights 
Amendment.’’ 
In like manner, the Supreme Court of Con-
necticut invalidated its state ban on abortion 
funding and wrote in 1986: ‘‘it is therefore 
clear, under the Connecticut ERA, that the 
regulation excepting . . . abortions from the 
Medicaid 
program 
discriminates 
against 
women.’’ 
Today in Pennsylvania, activists are suing to 
eviscerate the abortion funding restriction in 
that state claiming that the Hyde-type restric-
tion violates the Pennsylvania Equal Rights 
Amendment. 
I believe that all human beings—especially 
the weakest and most vulnerable including un-
born baby girls and boys—deserve respect, 
empathy, compassion, and protection from vi-
olence. 
Madam Speaker, last year, Supreme Court 
Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg spoke on the 
legal impermissibility of extending the deadline 
for ratification and that she ‘‘would like it to 
start over’’. 
According to Vox, Justice Ginsburg said, 
There’s too much controversy about late-
comers, plus, a number of states have with-
drawn their ratification. So, if you count a late-
comer on the plus side, how can you dis-
regard states that said ’we’ve changed our 
minds?’ ’’ 
Five states—Idaho, Kentucky, Nebraska, 
Tennessee, and South Dakota—voted to ratify 
the ERA but later rescinded that ratification. 
I strongly believe in equal rights for women. 
I’ve introduced the ERA with the abortion-neu-
tral language I mentioned a moment ago. 
Over the course of many years, I have con-
sistently sponsored and promoted women’s 
rights legislation to ensure equal pay for equal 
work including most recently, the Paycheck 
Fairness Act. 
In the struggle against wage discrimination, 
I voted in favor of the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay 
Act. 
To help ensure that women are not dis-
advantaged in their careers because of time 
taken to attend to their families, I was an early 
and strong advocate of multiple legislative ini-
tiatives to provide family medical leave—in-
cluding the groundbreaking bill that became 
law, the Family and Medical Leave Act. 
I voted to ensure that women’s rights are 
protected in higher education by strongly sup-
porting Title IX. 
I have supported legislation to amend pen-
sion and tax policies that negatively impact 
women, and I supported numerous bills to es-
tablish certain rights for sexual assault sur-
vivors including the Survivors’ Bill of Rights 
which is now law. 
Since the mid-1990s, I have led the effort to 
end the barbaric practice of human trafficking, 
a human rights abuse that is an unimaginable 
exploitation of women and girls that thrives on 
greed, disrespect, and secrecy. 
Twenty years ago, the U.S. Congress ap-
proved and the President signed legislation 
that I authored—the Trafficking Victims Protec-
tion Act of 2000—a comprehensive whole-of- 
government initiative to combat sex and labor 
trafficking in the United States and around the 
world. 
The Violence Against Women Act (See Divi-
sion B) was reauthorized and significantly ex-
panded by my law. Last Congress, I cospon-
sored the Violence Against Women Extension 
Act of 2019. 
In 2019, I authored another bill that was 
signed into law-my fifth major law on human 
trafficking—The Frederick Douglass Trafficking 
Victims Prevention and Protection Act. 
After a young college student from my dis-
trict, Samantha Josephson, was brutally mur-
dered by the driver of what she thought was 
her Uber ride, I introduced Sami’s Law which 
passed the House—but never got a vote in 
the Senate—to make the ride share industry 
safer for all. In recent months, it has been 
shocking to learn that thousands of women 
who use Lyft or Uber have been sexually as-
saulted and some have been murdered. I re-
introduced Sami’s Law in February. 
Yesterday, it was reported that another 
woman was sexually assaulted in Ft. Lauder-
dale by an ‘‘off-duty’’ Uber driver. 
Ensuring equal rights for women and seri-
ous protections against violence requires laws, 
policies, and spending priorities to achieve 
those noble and necessary goals—without 
putting unborn baby girls and boys at risk of 
death. 
Mrs. TORRES of California. Madam 
Speaker, I include in the RECORD a 
March 16 USA Today opinion piece 
from activists Dolores Huerta, Carol 
Jenkins, and Eleanor Smeal titled 
‘‘There is no deadline on women’s 
equality. Add the equal rights amend-
ment to the Constitution.’’ 
[From USA TODAY, March 16, 2021] 
THERE’S NO DEADLINE ON WOMEN’S EQUALITY. 
ADD THE EQUAL RIGHTS AMENDMENT TO THE 
CONSTITUTION. 
(By Dolores Huerta, Carol Jenkins and 
Eleanor Smeal) 
For the second time in a century, a global 
pandemic has occurred at the height of a de-
termined movement to expand women’s 
rights under the U.S. Constitution. The 1918 
flu pandemic nearly halted the drive for rati-
fication of the 19th Amendment on women’s 
suffrage. 
But 
advocates 
rallied, 
lobbied 
President Woodrow Wilson for support and 
urged Congress to pass a joint resolution 
adopting the amendment. That was followed 
by ratification by the states and final certifi-
cation in August 1920. 
Today, the campaign for ratification of the 
Equal Rights Amendment is in the middle of 
another global pandemic with women losing 
jobs at a much higher rate than men, espe-
cially affecting women of color. In these first 
100 days of the Biden-Harris administration 
and during Women’s History Month, there is 
a real opportunity to make constitutional 
history again with lasting change for wom-
en’s rights and gender equality by adding the 
ERA to the Constitution. 
No rights denied ’on account of sex’ 
Congress approved the ERA in 1972. It says, 
very simply, that ‘‘equality of rights under 
the law shall not be denied or abridged by 
the United States or any state on account of 
sex.’’ 
President Joe Biden and Congress now 
have the opportunity to rally as well. This 
week, the House of Representatives will con-
sider a joint resolution clearing the way for 
the ERA to be added to the Constitution. If 
the Senate also adopts the resolution, it 
could become part of the Constitution this 
year. 
The ERA won ratification by the necessary 
three-fourths of the states when Virginia be-
came the 38th state last year. Earlier, Ne-
vada ratified in 2017 and Illinois in 2018. How-
ever, the ERA has yet to be formally en-
shrined into the Constitution because of an 
arbitrary timeline in the amendment’s pre-
amble—not the legislative text sent to the 
states for approval—which set 1979 for ratifi-
cation. Congress changed the timeline by ex-
tending it to 1982. 
Congress can again weigh in by removing 
the timeline and recognizing the final three 
states, because Article V of the Constitution 
puts the amending process with the Congress 
and ratification with the states.

But a U.S. district judge ruled this month 
that the three states did not have standing 
to bring the case, and the 1982 deadline re-
mains in effect. 
Now is the time for Congress to recognize

March 16, 2021 
House and Senate should approve a joint res-
olution ‘‘removing the deadline for the rati-
fication of the equal rights amendment.’’ 
The measure, introduced in the House in 
January, already has more than 200 co-spon-
sors. 
The vast majority of Americans across de-
mographic and partisan lines agree that 
women should have equal rights with men in 
this country. In a 2020 Pew Research Center 
survey, more than 9 in 10 U.S. adults said it 
is very important (79%) or somewhat impor-
tant (18%). Fully 78% of U.S. adults—includ-
ing majorities of women, men, Republicans 
and Democrats—favored adding the ERA to 
the Constitution. 
‘All men would be tyrants if they could’ 
Abigail Adams is often quoted as saying, 
‘‘Remember the Ladies.’’ In March of 1776, 
she wrote more than these three words to her 
husband, John, just months before the Dec-
laration of Independence was adopted and as 
he was engaged in drafting the U.S. Con-
stitution. She had some ideas about what 
should be included ‘‘in the new code of laws’ 
he was making: ‘‘I desire you would remem-
ber the ladies and be more generous and fa-
vorable to them than your ancestors. . . . 
Remember, all men would be tyrants if they 
could. If particular care and attention is not 
paid to the ladies, we are determined to 
formant a rebellion, and will not hold our-
selves bound by any laws in which we have 
no voice or representation.’’ 
That rebellion has been taking place 
through the hundreds of peaceful ERA 
marches and rallies that led up to the 2017 
Women’s March, events that galvanized mil-
lions of women and men nationwide to new 
levels of political activism. The #MeToo 
movement sparked public outrage over sex-
ual assault and misogyny in the workplace. 
In 2020, women again far outnumbered men 
as voters with a gender gap that has become 
decisive in presidential, Senate and House 
elections. And women and men alike sup-
ported the Equal Rights Amendment by 
electing a pro-ERA majority of members in 
the House and Senate. 
An estimated 1 million more women than 
men have lost their jobs during the COVID– 
19 lockdowns, and the pandemic shows that 
most essential workers are women, most of 
them are Black and Latina, and most still 
have the majority of caregiving responsibil-
ities. These along with other economic reali-
ties make constitutional rights for women 
more urgent than ever before. 
The pandemic has sparked a reexamination 
of the role of government and the need for 
social safety net and economic policies that 
work for all. In short, the new reality of 2021 
demands that Congress approve the ERA res-
olution. It will mark a historic commitment 
to women’s rights by ensuring equality 
under the law for current and future genera-
tions. 
Mrs. TORRES of California. Madam 
Speaker, COVID’s impact on women 
shows the continued need for equality. 
We have the power to remove the ERA 
ratification deadline and make it a re-
ality. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mrs. FISCHBACH. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
If we defeat the previous question, I 
will offer an amendment to the rule to 
provide for consideration of Congress-
woman MILLER-MEEKS’ H.R. 1897, the 
REACT Act. 
Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous 
consent to insert the text of my 
amendment in the RECORD, along with 
extraneous 
material, 
immediately 
prior to the vote on the previous ques-
tion. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from Minnesota? 
There was no objection. 
Mrs. FISCHBACH. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 5 minutes to the gentlewoman 
from Iowa (Mrs. MILLER-MEEKS) to 
speak further on the amendment. 
Mrs. 
MILLER-MEEKS. 
Madam 
Speaker, I thank my good friend, Con-
gresswoman FISCHBACH, for yielding me 
time. 
I urge my colleagues to defeat the 
previous question so we can take up 
my bill, H.R. 1897, the REACT Act. 
My bill would require the Depart-
ment of Homeland Security to test all 
migrants illegally crossing our border 
who they plan to release into our com-
munities for COVID–19. 
Yesterday, I traveled to El Paso, 
Texas, to meet with the men and 
women of the United States Customs 
and Border Protection. I saw firsthand 
the crisis they are facing and believe it 
is our job as Congress to do everything 
in our power to address it. 
CBP is currently encountering more 
than 3,000 migrants on average per day, 
which is rapidly approaching levels 
seen at the height of the 2019 crisis. To 
put 
this 
in 
perspective, 
President 
Obama’s Secretary of Homeland Secu-
rity, Jeh Johnson, stated during his 
tenure that 1,000 apprehensions a day 
was considered a bad day. We are at 
more than three times that now, and 
on top of it, we continue to face a glob-
al pandemic. 
In February, CBP encountered over 
100,000 migrants on the southwest bor-
der trying to illegally enter our coun-
try. This does not include those mi-
grants who may have gotten away or 
evaded detection, some of whom may 
be positive for COVID–19. 
The Department of Homeland Secu-
rity announced today that we are on 
track to encounter the highest number 
of migrants along the southwest border 
in the last 20 years. Seasonally, migra-
tion gets worse in the spring months of 
April and May, so we are likely to see 
these numbers increase over the com-
ing months. 
Yesterday, I heard directly from the 
Border Patrol agents that few, if any, 
of the thousands of migrants we saw in 
CBP custody are being tested for 
COVID–19. These migrants, and chil-
dren, in particular, are being held in fa-
cilities that are already at capacity, 
and often for longer than the 72-hour 
limit permitted by law. According to 
recent reports, as of March 8, 185 mi-
grants 
released 
into 
Brownsville, 
Texas, have tested positive for COVID– 
19. 
Border security and immigration is 
not an issue that only affects border 
States. It affects every community 
across the country. If the Biden admin-
istration continues to release these mi-
grants, they will not stay in our border 
communities. Instead, they will travel 
to every State. Without proper testing 
and quarantine, they are likely to 
bring COVID–19 with them, and the 
communities to which they are trans-
ferred are unaware. 
As a physician and former director of 
the Iowa Department of Public Health, 
I know that the COVID–19 pandemic is 
not yet over. We must ensure that any 
individuals the Biden administration 
insists on releasing into our commu-
nities do not have COVID–19. This is 
also why I support reinstating the 
PAUSE Act, to prevent the introduc-
tion of new COVID–19 cases from Can-
ada and Mexico. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to support this legislation to 
require that we keep all of our commu-
nities and these migrants safe and to 
stop spreading COVID–19 by voting 
‘‘no’’ on the previous question. 
Mrs. TORRES of California. Madam 
Speaker, President Biden inherited a 
dismantled and gutted immigration 
system. 
The 
prior 
administration’s 
strategy of cruelty, chaos, and confu-
sion was ineffective and set the stage 
for our current challenges. 
I include in the RECORD a March 15 
Columbus Dispatch article titled ‘‘Un-
documented immigrants pay billions in 
taxes each year—and have been for 25 
years.’’ 
[From the Columbus Dispatch, Mar. 15, 2021] 
UNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANTS PAY BILLIONS IN 
TAXES EACH YEAR—AND HAVE BEEN FOR 25 
YEARS 
(By Danae King) 
Every year, Arturo pays thousands of dol-
lars in taxes from the revenue produced by 
his central Ohio-based painting company. 
But he will never receive Social Security 
benefits. Or Medicare. Or Medicaid. 
That’s because Arturo, whose last name is 
not being used for his safety, is an undocu-
mented immigrant from Mexico—one of 
about 6 million who pay taxes annually, ac-
cording to the Congressional Budget Office. 
Jorge Beltran is a Columbus tax preparer 
who is certified by the IRS to file taxes for 
undocumented immigrants. He hopes to 
shatter misconceptions about immigrants 
not paying taxes and being drains on society. 
A report from the office shows that 50% to 
75% of undocumented immigrants pay bil-
lions in taxes each year—and have been since 
the Internal Revenue Service created a pro-
gram 25 years ago allowing people without a 
Social Security number to file taxes. 
When it comes to state and local taxes, un-
documented immigrants pay more than $11 
billion a year, according to a 2017 report 
from the Institute on Taxation and Eco-
nomic Policy, a nonpartisan nonprofit based 
in Washington, D.C. In Ohio, they paid $83.2 
million in state and local taxes in 2017, ac-
cording to the institute. 
Jorge Beltran, left, reviews tax documents 
with client Ana Narciso. Beltran is a Colum-
bus tax preparer who is certified by the IRS

He hopes to shatter misconceptions about 
immigrants not paying taxes and being 
drains on society. Narciso has legal status to 
be in the United States.

welfare.’ That’s not the case,’’ said Jessica 
Rodriguez Bell, a Columbus immigration at-
torney who has undocumented clients. 
‘‘These people are not eligible for those 
benefits, and many times they’re paying into 
the system like we are. It’s frustrating to 
hear that a lot.’’ 
Still, many attorneys recommend their un-
documented clients pay taxes, Rodriguez 
Bell said. 
‘‘The reason for that is that, one, it’s in-
come they’ve been paying in and are likely 
entitled to a refund of some sort,’’ Rodriguez 
Bell said. ‘‘Then, also because in the future, 
even if they don’t have a current immigra-
tion case pending or even if they’re not eligi-
ble for relief at this time . . . oftentimes you 
want to demonstrate good moral character 
and that you’ve been an upstanding citizen 
while you’ve been here.’’ 
Years of tax returns also establish that a 
person has been living in the United States, 
she said. 
To some, though, the issue is not whether 
or not undocumented immigrants pay taxes, 
said Mark Krikorian, executive director of 
the Center for Immigration Studies, a Wash-
ington, D.C.-based conservative think tank. 
‘‘There’s this sort of implicit assumption 
that if you pay your taxes everything else is 
fine,’’ he said. ‘‘Paying your taxes doesn’t 
wipe away everything else that you’ve 
done.’’ 
Krikorian said that the real question is 
what is the balance of taxes undocumented 
immigrants pay versus the services they con-
sume. 
‘‘There’s no real debate about less-skilled 
workers,’’ he said. ‘‘Whether they’re legal or 
illegal, they use more in services than they 
pay in taxes.’’ 
A 2010 report from another Washington, 
D.C., think tank, the Brookings Institution, 
however, suggests that while U.S.-citizen 
children of undocumented immigrants can be 
costly when they’re young, those costs are 
paid out through a lifetime of taxes. 
The mere act of filing taxes could be seen 
as a risk for undocumented immigrants be-
cause it could result in the federal govern-
ment pursing legal action to return the im-
migrants to their home country. But Rodri-
guez-Bell said she hasn’t seen any such nega-
tive consequences. 
‘‘The IRS is a separate department, so it’s 
not something where we’ve ever seen infor-
mation exchanged between the IRS and, say, 
ICE,’’ she said, referring to Immigration and 
Customs Enforcement. ‘‘This is not some-
thing that’s going to get you in trouble, and 
you’re not doing something illegal by doing 
that. It can only help your situation in the 
future if you are filing.’’ 
In 1996, the IRS created the Individual Tax-
payer Identification Number (ITIN) to allow 
people working in the United States without 
Social Security numbers to pay taxes. It is a 
9-digit number, the same length as a Social 
Security number, issued only to those who 
are not eligible for Social Security numbers. 
In order to help undocumented immigrants 
get a tax ID number and file, the IRS cer-
tifies what are called acceptance agents. 
There are 13 in Columbus, 79 in Ohio and 
more than 5,000 nationwide. 
Jorge Beltran, the owner of Belmont Serv-
ices LLC, a tax preparation company on Co-
lumbus’ Northwest Side, has been a certified 
acceptance agent with the IRS since 2008. 
The vast majority of Beltran’s clients are 
undocumented immigrants, and he’s pas-
sionate about letting people know that they 
pay taxes. 
‘‘Imagine if more people knew this,’’ 
Beltran said. ‘‘These are not people asking 
for a handout. They’re not asking for unem-
ployment. They’re not asking for any bene-
fits. Even if they wanted to, they couldn’t.’’ 
Consider his clients Javier and Norma— 
whose first names only are being used, as 
with other undocumented immigrants in this 
story, for their safety—who both worked in 
food service before the pandemic. In March 
2020, Javier got laid off but had no access to 
unemployment or COVID–19 relief payments 
due to his status. Over the course of the rest 
of the year, he worked six different jobs to 
support his family, which includes their 
three U.S.-born children. 
The couple made $56,369 in 2020 and got a 
refund of $3,337, which made a big difference 
in their lives, Beltran said, possibly paying 
for five months of their rent. If they had So-
cial Security numbers, they could’ve gotten 
$6,900 in federal COVID relief payments in 
2020 to help support their family, Beltran 
said. 
‘‘They contribute to all of our commu-
nities,’’ he said. ‘‘They pay the school sys-
tem from their taxes. They pay for the roads 
from their taxes, and they spend money they 
make in the grocery stores and movie thea-
ters and everywhere but nobody knows about 
it.’’ 
Beltran shared the story of another two of 
his clients, Cirilo and Patricia, who live in 
Mount Vernon and have been in the country 
for almost 20 years. Cirilo works two jobs as 
a cook, but only made $26,784 last year, pay-
ing $3,706 in taxes. His earnings had to sup-
port his six children—four of whom have De-
ferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) 
status, allowing them to work and go to 
school legally, and two of whom were born in 
the United States. 
Nicole, who owns a painting business with 
her 
undocumented 
immigrant 
husband, 
Arturo, both pose for a portrait on Friday, 
March 12, 2021. Undocumented immigrants 
pay taxes and own businesses that employ 
people and help the local economy. 
Arturo and his wife, Nicole, a U.S. citizen 
whose family is from Mexico and who owns 
their 
painting 
company 
with 
him, 
are 
Beltran’s clients as well. They employ 47 
people and paid $118,250 in estimated taxes 
this year, according to Beltran. 
‘‘Talk about being productive members of 
society,’’ he said. ‘‘Forty-seven people can 
feed their families, help pay the schools, 
whatever, with the employment they have 
and that’s generated by this company. 
More than $11,000 from the family’s taxes 
went to the city of Columbus. 
The couple started their business after 
Arturo got injured in his job as a butcher 
and was fired. He started working for a 
friend as a painter, but had always dreamed 
of working for himself and owning a busi-
ness. So, with the help of a friend, they 
started their own business six years ago and 
now support themselves and their four chil-
dren. 
‘‘He comes from nothing in Mexico. His 
parents are farmers, and he has just a middle 
school, almost high school education,’’ Ni-
cole said, of her husband. ‘‘It was really im-
portant for him not to be stuck. He came to 
the United States to make something for 
himself, to provide a better future for his 
children.’’ 
Immigrants are here to make the country 
better, Nicole said. 
‘‘This is what makes America great,’’ she 
said. ‘‘immigrants coming here and finding 
their way and helping the country prosper, 
too.’’ 
Mrs. TORRES of California. Madam 
Speaker, during the last 4 years, mil-
lions of immigrants faced uncertainty 
as the Trump administration pursued 
cruel immigration policies. With pas-
sage of H.R. 6, we are beginning a new 
chapter in our Nation’s immigration 
policy. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mrs. FISCHBACH. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from 
New York (Mr. KATKO). 
Mr. KATKO. Madam Speaker, I will 
note, in response to my colleagues 
across the aisle, that there is nothing 
wrong with enforcing the immigration 
laws that are on the books. That is all 
we are talking about doing at the bor-
der, and keeping the border secure. 
Madam Speaker, yesterday, I visited 
the southern border, and what I saw 
was unacceptable, full stop. I witnessed 
the dangerous and rapidly growing im-
pacts of Biden’s border crisis. 
I spoke to Border Patrol agents on 
the front line of the crisis and wit-
nessed firsthand what they are up 
against. Thousands of migrants are 
showing up every week, hanging onto 
the words and promises of President 
Biden’s goal of relaxing border restric-
tions. 
Our 
Border 
Patrol 
agents 
are 
underresourced and overwhelmed. They 
have been put in an untenable situa-
tion, with little regard for their health 
or safety. 
Department of Homeland Security 
Secretary 
Mayorkas 
recently 
an-
nounced the Department would begin 
allocating FEMA resources. FEMA is 
the agency that is in charge of over-
seeing the pandemic and delivering 
vaccines to our American citizens. He 
has taken resources away from Amer-
ican citizens to deal with this crisis on 
the border. If FEMA is involved, it is, 
by definition, a disaster. 
Last week, senior Department of 
Homeland Security officials told the 
committee that Customs and Border 
Protection doesn’t have the capacity to 
test and quarantine migrants in their 
custody, and that there was no plan-
ning being done to ensure migrants are 
not released by the Federal Govern-
ment at the border if they are COVID– 
19 positive. Thousands have been re-
leased. 
I saw with my own eyes hundreds of 
people in this facility. Not a single one 
was tested. And only half of the Border 
Patrol agents have been inoculated. We 
don’t know how many have COVID–19, 
and quite frankly, I don’t think they 
want to know. 
In the midst of the ongoing pan-
demic, it is the Department’s job to en-
sure it doesn’t release anyone who is 
COVID–19 positive. For this reason, I 
support efforts to defeat the previous 
question and bring up commonsense 
legislation to require that any indi-
vidual released from CBP or ICE cus-
tody tests negative for COVID–19. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentleman has expired. 
Mrs. FISCHBACH. Madam Speaker, I 
yield an additional 30 seconds to the 
gentleman 
from 
New 
York 
(Mr. 
KATKO).

dent Biden’s knee-jerk reversal of pro-
ductive, effective border security poli-
cies from the previous administration

was a political calculation that has, 
quite frankly, backfired and created a 
humanitarian, 
security, 
and 
public 
health crisis. 
We can’t allow our Nation’s progress 
in overcoming the ongoing pandemic to 
be undermined by dangerous policies 
allowing individuals with COVID–19 to 
be released into our communities. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to vote to defeat the previous 
question. 
Mrs. TORRES of California. Madam 
Speaker, I include in the RECORD a 
statement by Department of Homeland 
Security 
Secretary 
Alejandro 
N. 
Mayorkas in which he states the many 
issues associated with the southern 
border and what we are doing to ad-
dress those issues. 
For example, Border Patrol facilities 
and border personnel that had not had 
complete access to a COVID–19 vaccine 
now have complete access to the vac-
cine. It talks about the disruptions of 
the previous administration and their 
lack of commitment to deal with ten-
der-age children and many other issues 
that could help inform this conversa-
tion moving forward. 
[From the U.S. Department of Homeland 
Security, Mar. 16, 2021] 
STATEMENT
BY
HOMELAND
SECURITY
SEC-
RETARY ALEJANDRO N. MAYORKAS REGARD-
ING THE SITUATION AT THE SOUTHWEST BOR-
DER 
There is understandably a great deal of at-
tention currently focused on the southwest 
border. I want to share the facts, the work 
that we in the Department of Homeland Se-
curity (DHS) and across the government are 
doing, and our plan of action. Our personnel 
remain steadfast in devotion of their talent 
and efforts in the service of our nation. 
The situation at the southwest border is 
difficult. We are working around the clock to 
manage it and we will continue to do so. 
That is our job. We are making progress and 
we are executing on our plan. It will take 
time and we will not waver in our commit-
ment to succeed. 
We will also not waver in our values and 
our principles as a Nation. Our goal is a safe, 
legal, and orderly immigration system that 
is based on our bedrock priorities: to keep 
our borders secure, address the plight of chil-
dren as the law requires, and enable families 
to be together. As noted by the President in 
his Executive Order, ‘‘securing our borders 
does not require us to ignore the humanity 
of those who seek to cross them.’’ We are 
both a nation of laws and a nation of immi-
grants. That is one of our proudest tradi-
tions. 
THE FACTS 
We are on pace to encounter more individ-
uals on the southwest border than we have in 
the last 20 years. We are expelling most sin-
gle adults and families. We are not expelling 
unaccompanied children. We are securing 
our border, executing the Centers for Disease 
Control and Prevention’s (CDC) public health 
authority to safeguard the American public 
and the migrants themselves, and protecting 
the children. We have more work to do. 
This is not new. We have experienced mi-
gration surges before—in 2019, 2014, and be-
fore then as well. Since April 2020, the num-
ber of encounters at the southwest border 
has been steadily increasing. Border Patrol 
Agents are working around the clock to 
process the flow at the border and I have 
great respect for their tireless efforts. To un-
derstand the situation, it is important to 
identify who is arriving at our southwest 
border and how we are following the law to 
manage different types of border encounters. 
SINGLE ADULTS 
The majority of those apprehended at the 
southwest border are single adults who are 
currently being expelled under the CDC’s au-
thority to manage the public health crisis of 
the COVID–19 pandemic. Pursuant to that 
authority under Title 42 of the United States 
Code, single adults from Mexico and the 
Northern Triangle countries of El Salvador, 
Guatemala, and Honduras are swiftly ex-
pelled to Mexico. Single adults from other 
countries are expelled by plane to their 
countries of origin if Mexico does not accept 
them. There are limited exceptions to our 
use of the CDC’s expulsion authority. For ex-
ample, we do not expel individuals with cer-
tain acute vulnerabilities. 
The expulsion of single adults does not 
pose an operational challenge for the Border 
Patrol because of the speed and minimal 
processing burden of their expulsion. 
FAMILIES 
Families apprehended at the southwest 
border are also currently being expelled 
under the CDC’s Title 42 authority. Families 
from Mexico and the Northern Triangle 
countries are expelled to Mexico unless Mex-
ico does not have the capacity to receive the 
families. Families from countries other than 
Mexico or the Northern Triangle are expelled 
by plane to their countries of origin. Excep-
tions can be made when a family member has 
an acute vulnerability. 
Mexico’s limited capacity has strained our 
resources, including in the Rio Grande Val-
ley area of Texas. When Mexico’s capacity is 
reached, we process the families and place 
them in immigration proceedings here in the 
United States. We have partnered with 
communitybased organizations to test the 
family members and quarantine them as 
needed under COVID-19 protocols. In some 
locations, the processing of individuals who 
are part of a family unit has strained our 
border resources. I explain below additional 
challenges we have encountered and the 
steps we have taken to solve this problem. 
UNACCOMPANIED CHILDREN 
We are encountering many unaccompanied 
children at our southwest border every day. 
A child who is under the age of 18 and not ac-
companied by their parent or legal guardian 
is considered under the law to be an unac-
companied child. We are encountering six- 
and sevenyear-old children, for example, ar-
riving at our border without an adult. They 
are vulnerable children and we have ended 
the prior administration’s practice of expel-
ling them. 
An unaccompanied child is brought to a 
Border Patrol facility and processed for 
transfer to the Department of Health and 
Human Services (HHS). Customs and Border 
Protection is a passthrough and is required 
to transfer the child to HHS within 72 hours 
of apprehension. HHS holds the child for 
testing and quarantine, and shelters the 
child until the child is placed with a sponsor 
here in the United States. In more than 80 
percent of cases, the child has a family mem-
ber in the United States. In more than 40 
percent of cases, that family member is a 
parent or legal guardian. These are children 
being reunited with their families who will 
care for them. 
The children then go through immigration 
proceedings where they are able to present a 
claim for relief under the law. 
The Border Patrol facilities have become 
crowded with children and the 72–hour time-
frame for the transfer of children from the 
Border Patrol to HHS is not always met. 
HHS has not had the capacity to intake the 
number of unaccompanied children we have 
been encountering. I describe below the ac-
tions we have taken and the plans we are 
executing to handle this difficult situation 
successfully. 
WHY THE CHALLENGE IS ESPECIALLY DIFFICULT 
NOW 
Poverty, high levels of violence, and cor-
ruption in Mexico and the Northern Triangle 
countries have propelled migration to our 
southwest border for years. The adverse con-
ditions have continued to deteriorate. Two 
damaging hurricanes that hit Honduras and 
swept through the region made the living 
conditions there even worse, causing more 
children and families to flee. 
The COVID–19 pandemic has made the situ-
ation more complicated. There are restric-
tions and protocols that need to be followed. 
The physical distancing protocol, for exam-
ple, imposes space and other limitations on 
our facilities and operations. 
The prior administration completely dis-
mantled the asylum system. The system was 
gutted, facilities were closed, and they cru-
elly expelled young children into the hands 
of traffickers. We have had to rebuild the en-
tire system, including the policies and proce-
dures required to administer the asylum 
laws that Congress passed long ago. 
The prior administration tore down the 
lawful pathways that had been developed for 
children to come to the United States in a 
safe, efficient, and orderly way. It tore down, 
for example, the Central American Minors 
program that avoided the need for children 
to take the dangerous journey to our south-
west border. 
The previous administration also cut for-
eign aid funding to the Northern Triangle. 
No longer did we resource efforts in El Sal-
vador, Guatemala, and Honduras to tackle 
the root causes of people fleeing their homes. 
And, there were no plans to protect our 
front-line personnel against the COVID–19 
pandemic. There was no appropriate plan-
ning for the pandemic at all. 
As difficult as the border situation is now, 
we are addressing it. We have acted and we 
have made progress. We have no illusions 
about how hard it is, and we know it will 
take time. We will get it done. We will do so 
adhering to the law and our fundamental 
values. We have an incredibly dedicated and 
talented workforce. 
ACTIONS WE HAVE TAKEN 
In less than two months, Customs and Bor-
der Protection stood-up an additional facil-
ity in Donna, Texas to process unaccom-
panied children and families. We deployed 
additional personnel to provide oversight, 
care, and transportation assistance for unac-
companied minors pending transfer to HHS 
custody. 
We are standing up additional facilities in 
Texas and Arizona to shelter unaccompanied 
children and families. We are working with 
Mexico to increase its capacity to receive ex-
pelled families. We partnered with commu-
nity-based organizations to test and quar-
antine families that Mexico has not had the 
capacity to receive. We have developed a 
framework for partnering with local mayors 
and public health officials to pay for 100% of 
the expense for testing, isolation, and quar-
antine for migrants. ICE has also developed 
additional facilities to provide testing, local 
transportation, immigration document as-
sistance, orientation, travel coordination in 
the interior, and mechanisms to support 
oversight of the migrant families who are 
not expelled. 
Working with Mexico and international or-
ganizations, we built a system in which mi-
grants who were forced to remain in Mexico 
and denied a chance to seek protection under

the previous administration can now use a 
virtual platform—using their phones—to reg-
ister. They do not need to take the dan-
gerous journey to the border. The individuals 
are tested, processed, and transported to a 
port of entry safely and out of the hands of 
traffickers. We succeeded in processing the 
individuals who were in the Matamoros camp 
in Mexico. This is the roadmap going forward 
for a system that is safe, orderly, and fair. 
To protect our own workforce, we launched 
Operation Vaccinate Our Workforce (VOW) 
in late January. At the beginning of this ad-
ministration, less than 2 percent of our 
frontline personnel were vaccinated. Now 
more than 25 percent of our frontline per-
sonnel have been vaccinated. 
We directed the Federal Emergency Man-
agement Agency (FEMA) to assist HHS in 
developing the capacity to meet the surge of 
unaccompanied children. FEMA already es-
tablished one new facility for HHS to shelter 
700 children. They have identified and are 
currently adding additional facilities. We are 
working with HHS to more efficiently iden-
tify and screen sponsors for children. In two 
days, we recruited more than 560 DHS volun-
teers to support HHS in our collective efforts 
to address the needs of the unaccompanied 
children. 
We are restarting and expanding the Cen-
tral American Minors program. It creates a 
lawful pathway for children to come to the 
United States without having to take the 
dangerous journey. Under this expansion, 
children will be processed in their home 
countries and brought to the United States 
in a safe and orderly way. 
In addition, DHS and HHS terminated a 
2018 agreement that had a chilling effect on 
potential sponsors—typically a parent or 
close relative—from coming forward to care 
for an unaccompanied child placed in an HHS 
shelter. In its place, DHS and HHS signed a 
new Memorandum of Agreement that pro-
motes the safe and timely transfer of chil-
dren. It keeps safeguards designed to ensure 
children are unified with properly vetted 
sponsors who can safely care for them while 
they await immigration proceedings. 
THE PATH FORWARD 
We are creating joint processing centers so 
that children can be placed in HHS care im-
mediately after Border Patrol encounters 
them. We are also identifying and equipping 
additional facilities for HHS to shelter unac-
companied children until they are placed 
with family or sponsors. These are short- 
term solutions to address the surge of unac-
companied children. 
Longer term, we are working with Mexico 
and international organizations to expand 
our new virtual platform so that unaccom-
panied children can access it without having 
to take the dangerous journey to our border. 
As mentioned, we are expanding the Central 
American Minors program to permit more 
children to be processed in their home coun-
tries and if eligible, brought to the United 
States in a safe and orderly way. 
We are developing additional legal and safe 
pathways for children and others to reach 
the United States. While we are building a 
formal refugee program throughout the re-
gion, we are working with Mexico, the 
Northern Triangle countries, and inter-
national organizations to establish proc-
essing centers in those countries so that in-
dividuals can be screened through them and 
brought to the United States if they qualify 
for relief under our humanitarian laws and 
other authorities. 
For years, the asylum system has been 
badly in need of reengineering. In addition to 
improving the process by which unaccom-
panied children are placed with family or 
sponsors, we will be issuing a new regulation 
shortly and taking other measures to imple-
ment the long needed systemic reforms. We 
will shorten from years to months the time 
it takes to adjudicate an asylum claim while 
ensuring procedural safeguards and enhanc-
ing access to counsel. 
President Biden laid out a vision of a 
‘‘multi-pronged approach toward managing 
migration throughout North and Central 
America that reflects the Nation’s highest 
values.’’ To that end, we are working with 
the Departments of Health and Human Serv-
ices, Justice, and State in an all-of-govern-
ment effort to not only address the current 
situation at our southwest border, but to in-
stitute longer-term solutions to irregular 
migration from countries in our hemisphere 
that are suffering worsening conditions. This 
is powerfully exemplified by the President’s 
goal to invest $4 billion in the Northern Tri-
angle countries to address the root causes of 
migration. 
CONCLUSION 
The situation we are currently facing at 
the southwest border is a difficult one. We 
are tackling it. We are keeping our borders 
secure, enforcing our laws, and staying true 
to our values and principles. We can do so be-
cause of the incredible talent and unwaver-
ing dedication of our workforce. 
I came to this country as an infant, 
brought by parents who understood the hope 
and promise of America. Today, young chil-
dren are arriving at our border with that 
same hope. We can do this. 
Mrs. TORRES of California. Madam 
Speaker, I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
b 1730 
Mrs. FISCHBACH. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman 
from New Mexico (Ms. HERRELL). 
Ms. HERRELL. Madam Speaker, I 
rise because I am concerned about the 
release of aliens into my community 
without COVID–19 testing. 
Dr. MILLER-MEEKS’ changes to this 
legislation are vital to protecting 
Americans from the spread of COVID– 
19. 
As our Nation continues to deal with 
the COVID–19 pandemic, our State is 
still largely locked down, our schools 
are shuttered, and many of our busi-
nesses have been closed due to orders 
from State and local officials. 
In many areas along the border, the 
CBP has restarted catch and release in 
the midst of this unprecedented pan-
demic. This is completely illogical, es-
pecially while American citizens con-
tinue to live under such restrictions. In 
fact, again, I can point to a double 
standard. 
Madam Speaker, it is very unfair to 
think that we want to do something to 
protect these young families, these un-
accompanied children, when we know 
for a fact that they are coming across 
the border at the age 1, 3, and 5 alone, 
without any supervision. We know for 
a fact that they are being raped and 
pillaged along the way. And if we feel 
that is somehow a benefit to the chil-
dren, let alone being exposed in coming 
into this Nation with COVID, then we 
are fooling not only ourselves, but, 
again, the American people. We aren’t 
just putting the immigrants in harm’s 
way, but also the American people. 
Madam Speaker, we should be more 
mindful of what is happening. This is a 
health pandemic we are living in. This 
is a crisis. We have suicide rates that 
we have never seen before amongst stu-
dents. Our businesses are shut down. 
We must do something to protect the 
American people first. 
We also must protect the migrants. 
But allowing our borders to be porous 
without the COVID testing is, again, a 
mistake, not only for the Nation, but 
for the migrants trying to come here. 
It is dangerous for both Americans and 
migrants. 
We deserve better than that in Amer-
ica. Our Americans deserve better than 
that. And we must support Dr. MILLER- 
MEEKS’ bill and insist that there is 
COVID testing before migrants are re-
leased into America. 
Mrs. TORRES of California. Madam 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
Madam Speaker, as difficult as the 
situation is at our southern border, we 
are addressing it. 
The Biden administration has acted, 
and they have made progress. They 
have no illusions about how hard it is, 
because they inherited a dismantled 
program. And to protect our own work-
force, they have launched Operation 
Vaccinate our Workers, VOW, in late 
January. 
At the beginning of the Biden admin-
istration, less than 2 percent of our 
frontline personnel were vaccinated. 
To date, more than 25 percent of our 
frontline personnel have been vac-
cinated. That is leadership. That is not 
avoidance of the problem that we face. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mrs. FISCHBACH. Madam Speaker, I 
am prepared to close, and I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. 
Madam Speaker, in closing, there is a 
crisis at our border. Whether the 
Democrats acknowledge it or not, our 
border patrol agents are overwhelmed, 
detention facilities are way over capac-
ity, and COVID–19 is spreading un-
checked throughout. This puts the 
health of both individuals detained and 
the border agents at risk. 
We currently require a negative 
COVID test to travel in the U.S. So 
why should the southern border be any 
different? 
The border crisis is a direct result of 
the administration’s lax immigration 
policy, and it is putting our commu-
nities at further risk of contracting 
COVID–19. 
Madam Speaker, I urge a ‘‘no’’ vote 
on the previous question, and a ‘‘no’’ 
vote on the underlying measure. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mrs. TORRES of California. Madam 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
Last week, we passed a historic 
American Rescue Plan, which set out a 
vision of who we are as a nation. We 
are a country that can conquer this 
virus, a country that cares about elimi-
nating childhood poverty, and a coun-
try that is dedicated to ensuring that

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H1404 
March 16, 2021 
everyone—everyone, not just the rich— 
are able to emerge from the pandemic 
and do better. 
The bills before us today are a con-
tinuation of this vision of a country 
committed to doing better for the peo-
ple. Too many people in America live 
in fear, fear because they are not pro-
tected under the law, but these bills be-
fore us today say: ‘‘No more.’’ 
The Violence Against Women Reau-
thorization Act says to domestic abuse 
survivors: ‘‘You are safe. You are going 
to be safe.’’ 
H.J. Res. 17, which removes the dead-
line for the ratification of the equal 
rights amendment says to women: 
‘‘You are equal.’’ ‘‘We are equal.’’ 
The Dream and Promise Act says to 
Dreamers: ‘‘You, too, can have a shot 
at the American Dream.’’ 
And the Farm Workforce Moderniza-
tion Act tells our farm workers: ‘‘You 
can do your job without fear of depor-
tation.’’ 
H.R. 1868 tells Americans: ‘‘Don’t 
worry about draconian cuts. Let’s 
focus on recovery.’’ 
Madam Speaker, the bills before us 
today will continue the Democratic 
Congress’ work to do better by all the 
American people. 
Madam Speaker, I urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote 
on the rule and the previous question. 
The material previously referred to 
by Mrs. FISCHBACH is as follows: 
AMENDMENT TO HOUSE RESOLUTION 233 
At the end of the resolution, add the fol-
lowing: 
SEC. 11. Immediately upon adoption of this 
resolution, the House shall proceed to the 
consideration in the House of the bill (H.R. 
1897) to require a diagnostic test for COVID– 
19 for an inadmissible alien released from the 
custody of the United States Customs and 
Border Protection or the United States Im-
migration and Customs Enforcement, and for 
other purposes. All points of order against 
consideration of the bill are waived. The bill 
shall be considered as read. All points of 
order against provisions in the bill are 
waived. The previous question shall be con-
sidered as ordered on the bill and on any 
amendment thereto to final passage without 
intervening motion except: (1) one hour of 
debate equally divided and controlled by the 
chair and ranking minority member of the 
Committee on the Judiciary; and (2) one mo-
tion to recommit. 
SEC. 12. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not 
apply to the consideration of H.R. 1897. 
Mrs. TORRES of California. Madam 
Speaker, I yield back the balance of 
my time, and I move the previous ques-
tion on the resolution. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on ordering the previous 
question.

I rise today to pose a question to my 
good friend, the Senator from Wis-
consin. 
It amazes me that in the conspicuous 
and confirmed insurrection of January 
6, when there were persons who were 
literally attacking and beating law en-
forcement officers in plain view; seek-
ing to kill the Vice President, the 
Speaker, and Members of Congress; and 
throwing off racial epithets, that Sen-
ator from Wisconsin seemed to be con-
fused. 
He was not afraid of the insurrection-
ists, who were beating police officers, 
but he would be afraid of young people 
of Black Lives Matter, who were fight-
ing for social justice, and allegedly 
those who were Antifa, which is really 
an ideology. 
It strikes me quite amazing that this 
individual would not understand that 
that is racist. That is racism. 
I would hope that if a Senator takes 
an oath to serve the people of the 
United States of America and his own 
State that is very diverse that he 
would correct that kind of behavior 
and that he would, in fact, not be 
someone who would offer to say that 
Black Lives Matter is worthy of being 
frightened of. 
No, they are not. They are fighting 
for social justice. They are fighting for 
what is right. I think the gentleman 
needs to get corrected in what he is 
thinking.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H1408 
March 16, 2021 
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today to recog-
nize Mr. Vincent Speranza, a 101st Air-
borne Division paratrooper, a Battle of 
the Bulge legend, and now a frequent 
flyer out of the Abraham Lincoln Cap-
ital Airport in Springfield, Illinois. 
Mr. Speranza is 95 years old and usu-
ally flies out of Abraham Lincoln on 
his way to travel the world or to jump 
out of airplanes like last year with the 
U.S. Army’s Golden Knights. 
Just a few weeks ago, I had the honor 
of being on the same flight as he was. 
TSA Officers Martin Derhake and 
Deanna Victor love Mr. Speranza and 
know he will always have a new story 
to brighten their day and lift their 
spirits. 
Mr. Speranza grew up in Staten Is-
land but now lives in Sherman, Illinois. 
He became a paratrooper after basic 
training and joined the 101st just prior 
to the Battle of the Bulge, where his 
actions have cemented his legacy to 
this day. Mr. Speranza filled up his 
Army helmet with beer from a tap in 
Bastogne for his friend who was wound-
ed. Later, Airborne Beer was born be-
cause of Speranza’s efforts. Madam 
Speaker, I urge you to look this story 
up if you haven’t already. 
I thank Mr. Speranza for his service 
to our country, for the way his pres-
ence brightens everyone’s day, and for 
helping his fellow troops find a beer 
during the Battle of the Bulge. 
Cheers to many more years, my 
friend.

SCHOOL TESTING 
(Mr. AUCHINCLOSS asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Mr. AUCHINCLOSS. Madam Speaker, 
the American Rescue Plan is going to 
help get kids back to full, in-person 
learning in Massachusetts’ Fourth Con-
gressional District. Since even before 
taking office, opening the schools has 
been my top district priority. 
With the rescue plan, we are not only 
boosting the production of vaccines 
that protect teachers and staff, but we 
are also providing money for HVAC up-
grades and for ongoing COVID surveil-
lance testing in the schools. This test-
ing catches outbreaks early and breaks 
transmission chains. It provides con-
fidence and transparency as we reopen. 
I am proud that scientists and opera-
tors in my district are developing these 
cutting-edge, low-cost school testing 
technologies, 
including 
at 
Ginkgo 
Bioworks, CIC Health, and Project Bea-
con. Classrooms must open, and they 
must be safe for students and teachers 
alike. With vaccines and testing, they 
will be. 
f 
REAUTHORIZATION OF VAWA 
(Mr. FITZPATRICK asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
his remarks.) 
Mr. FITZPATRICK. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today in strong support of the re-
authorization of the Violence Against 
Women Act, my legislation, which will 
be on this House floor tomorrow. 
Madam Speaker, for years, VAWA 
has been instrumental in safeguarding 
women and children from abuse, an-
guish, and violence, and has resulted in 
the saving of millions of lives. 
Madam Speaker, in my own district 
in Bucks County, Pennsylvania, A 
Woman’s Place has served as a life-
saving resource for over 40 years; and 
NOVA, the Network of Victim Assist-
ance, has helped over 3,600 victims— 
neither of which would be able to do 
their work without the help of VAWA 
and the reauthorization. 
Madam Speaker, in August of 2018, 7- 
year-old Kayden Mancuso of Bucks 
County was murdered by her father 
after being awarded partial, unsuper-
vised custody, despite a documented 
history of violence. She was a beautiful 
young girl whose life was taken from 
us. 
Kayden’s Law is included in this bill 
and takes steps to improve our re-
sponse to the failures of State courts 
to protect children in custody pro-
ceedings. 
Madam Speaker, VAWA is lifesaving 
legislation, and I implore my col-
leagues and all of my friends who we 
have built relationships with on both 
sides of the aisle to join me tomorrow 
in supporting this legislation. 
f 
REMEMBERING MICHAEL 
SCARBROUGH 
(Mr. CARTER of Georgia asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and 
extend his remarks.) 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to remember and 
honor an important voice of Tybee Is-
land, 
Georgia. 
Michael, 
or 
Mike, 
Scarbrough passed away on March 4. 
He was born in Birmingham, Ala-
bama, but eventually moved to Nor-
cross, Georgia, where he became vice 
president of Marathon Construction. 
Mike later moved to Tybee Island in 
1992, where he and his lovely wife, Iris, 
became owners of Lazaretto Creek Ma-
rina. 
There, 
they 
created 
Captain 
Mike’s Dolphin Tours. 
Captain Mike’s Dolphin Tours was 
voted the best adventure tour on Tybee 
Island for 9 straight years, and it was 
all thanks to Mike’s tireless contribu-
tions and engaging persona. 
Mike was an active member of the 
Tybee Island Republican Club, Tybee 
Island American Legion, and the Alee 
Temple Shriners. 
I am thankful for his wonderful con-
tributions to Tybee Island for the last 
few decades. 
My thoughts and prayers go out to 
his family, friends, and all who knew 
him during this most difficult time. 
f 
PRESIDENT TRUMP 
(Mr. LAMALFA asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. LAMALFA. President Trump is 
owed yet another apology from fake 
news outlets. The recent revelation 
about the Washington Post and its re-
traction 
and 
other 
disinformation 
sources going with a made-up narrative 
from ‘‘sources’’ in the Georgia election 
scandal prove, once again, that no act 
is out of bounds for the media, Demo-
crats, and others with Trump derange-
ment syndrome in their effort to dis-
credit President Trump. The Wash-
ington Post even went so far as to 
criticize all conservative media for not 
covering this story. 
Two distorted accounts of phone calls 
by President Trump got us two phony, 
baseless impeachment proceedings by 
this House. With no real review, wit-
ness testimony, or anything else re-
sembling due process in the bum-rush 
to have round two of impeachment, the 
blatant political usage of this process 
is a stain on this institution and should 
be an embarrassment to all who drove 
it. 
Apologies are owed not only to Presi-
dent Trump, but, more importantly, to 
the citizens of the United States, who 
lived through a year of being clamped 
down, their jobs lost and damaged, sav-
ings used up, and a giant legacy of def-
icit and death that this institution 
should be tackling. 
Instead, many weeks and costs wast-
ed on two impeachments in two years 
in the House. Shame on this institu-
tion for fulfilling this fake news. 
f 
HONORING THE SERVICE OF 
JUDGE JEFF BURDETTE 
(Mr. COMER asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. COMER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize my very good 
friend, Judge Jeff Burdette, from Mt. 
Vernon, 
Kentucky, 
in 
Rockcastle 
County, upon his retirement as circuit 
court judge after 30 years of distin-
guished service to the good people of 
the Commonwealth of Kentucky. 
Judge Burdette’s circuit court dis-
trict comprised Rockcastle, Lincoln, 
and Pulaski Counties. 
Judge Burdette was considered a con-
stitutional scholar who was respected 
by everyone, not just on the bench and 
in the legal community, but everyone 
in the community in southern Ken-
tucky. 
He was instrumental in launching 
the 28th Circuit Adult Drug Court and 
the rocket docket. 
Judge Burdette has been someone I 
have always looked up to, and I wish 
him the very best in his retirement. I 
thank him on behalf of the United 
States House of Representatives for his 
service to the good people of Kentucky.

Let us pray. 
Father of life, awaken in our Sen-

its new challenges and hopes. May they 
see in the challenges opportunities to 
grow in grace and in a deeper knowl-
edge of You. May they find in their 
hopes seeds to plant that will bring a 
harvest of healing to our land. Lord, 
fill their working hours with Your re-
deeming radiance and their hearts with 
Your peace. Keep them safe, for they 
have found in You a refuge. Instruct

EXECUTIVE SESSION 
EXECUTIVE CALENDAR 
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under 
the previous order, the Senate will pro-
ceed to executive session to resume 
consideration of the following nomina-
tion, which the clerk will report. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
read 
the 
nomination 
of 
Isabella 
Casillas Guzman, of California, to be 
Administrator of the Small Business 
Administration. 
RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY LEADER 
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The 
majority leader is recognized. 
(Mr. WARNOCK assumed the Chair.) 
NOMINATION OF ISABELLA CASILLAS GUZMAN 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, the 
COVID–19 pandemic has revealed just 
how important the Federal Govern-
ment can be in helping workers, fami-
lies, and businesses during a time of 
crisis. Congress has passed trillions of 
dollars in urgent relief, and we have re-
lied on Federal Agencies to implement 
that 
aid 
quickly, 
reliably, 
com-
petently. 
So, while it might not normally be as 
high profile as other Cabinet-level 
Agencies, the Small Business Adminis-
tration has recently been in the spot-
light. Over the last 12 months, the 
Small Business Administration has 
overseen two pandemic-related pro-
grams that will dole out more than $1 
trillion to our Nation’s small busi-
nesses, nonprofits, and religious insti-
tutions. Moving forward, it will play a 
prominent role in implementing the 
American Rescue Plan. 
Today, the Senate will vote on Presi-
dent Biden’s nominee to take on that 
important job: Ms. Isabella Guzman. 
Ms. Guzman could not be more ready. 
She comes from a family of small busi-
ness owners herself. Her dad ran his 
own veterinary clinic. Not only is Ms. 
Guzman a veteran of the Small Busi-
ness Administration, in serving as the 
Deputy Chief of Staff in the Obama ad-
ministration, she has just finished a 
stint as a top official at California’s Of-
fice of Business and Economic Develop-
ment, helping support the fifth largest 
economy in the world. 
For many Americans, opening and 
operating a business of their own is 
part of the American dream. I have 
every 
confidence 
that, 
under 
Ms. 
Guzman’s leadership, the SBA will help 
small business owners hold onto their 
dreams until our economy comes roar-
ing back. 
AMERICAN RESCUE PLAN ACT OF 2021 
Mr. President, this morning, I also 
want to continue the theme of high-
lighting aspects of the American Res-
cue Plan that have not received enough 
attention. 
We have heard a lot about the 
progress we have made on vaccines. I 
read, this morning, that 109 million 
Americans have received at least one 
vaccination, so we are well on the path 
to getting Americans vaccinated, and 
checks have gone out the door. I was 
on a call with people from central 
Brooklyn—Bed-Stuy and Brownsville— 
last night, and many had already re-
ceived their checks. It was very much 
needed. It was very much welcomed. 
As President Biden announced yes-
terday, on the vaccines, we have had 
100 million shots in people’s arms and 
100 million checks in people’s pockets. 
Let’s say that again. That sounds good 
to me—100 million shots in people’s 
arms and 100 million checks in people’s 
pockets. The Democrats are delivering 
what we promised. 
Now, we have heard a lot about how 
the American Rescue Plan will help 
Americans who need it the most. The 
20 percent of Americans at the lowest 
levels of income will receive the high-
est levels of support. It is about time. 
We had the mirror image of that when 
our Republican colleagues ran the Sen-
ate, where the top 1 percent did the 
best and the bottom 20 percent was to-
tally ignored. That is backward. God 
bless the people who are in the top 1 
percent, but they don’t need the help. 
It is the people struggling to feed their 
families, pay the rent, and help the 
kids in school who need the help. We 
are doing it for the first time in a 
while. Experts predict that child pov-
erty could be cut in half. Meanwhile,

the top 1 percent of Americans will see 
an income boost of zero percent. As I 
said, God bless them, but they are 
doing fine already. They are doing fine 
already. 
And we have heard a lot about how 
the American Rescue Plan will prime 
the American economy to come roaring 
back. Economists are already pro-
jecting that economic growth could 
double as a result of the American Res-
cue Plan. When over 75–85, I think it 
is—percent of Americans get some 
checks, the money goes out. It starts 
revitalizing our economy. People shop 
in the stores, eat at the restaurants, 
even begin to travel and see their rel-
atives, maybe, for the first time if peo-
ple are vaccinated. 
Wow, this is great news. This is great 
news. I think that America is turning 
the corner, and I think the attitude of 
Americans is turning the corner as 
well. People now see a brighter future 
for this country and their regions. 
Today, though, as I said, there is so 
much in this bill that, every day, I 
want to focus on something else that 
may not be focused upon. Since the 
Senate is set to vote on the confirma-
tion of the new SBA Administrator, 
today is a good opportunity to expand 
on just how the American Rescue Plan 
will help our Nation’s 30 million small 
businesses. 
We all know that small businesses 
have been some of the hardest hit enti-
ties by the pandemic. Early in the cri-
sis, 80 percent of small businesses—four 
out of five—reported having to close 
their doors at one point. Just the other 
day, I heard of a local New York busi-
ness owner who was forced to close up 
shop after surviving most of the pan-
demic. You could hear the pain in his 
voice. He poured his entire soul into 
this business. I know. This hits home 
for me. 
My dad was a small business man. He 
struggled. He had a little extermi-
nating business all through my grow-
ing years—from the day I was born 
until the day I left the house. My 
brother, sister, and I still have vivid 
memories of Dad’s pacing the floor on 
Sunday nights at 2 a.m. because he 
hated going to work on Monday morn-
ing—so many challenges, so much 
thrown at him, and not much he could 
do about it. He was wondering how he 
would actually provide for his family. 
Praise God, he retired at around 70. He 
is now 97. He has been a happy man for 
these last 27 years. God is good, as the 
Presiding Officer knows better than 
most of us, but he struggled. 
So, when I hear about the anguish of 
small business people, I will never for-
get. I would work there sometimes— 
weekends, summers. He sent me out to 
collect checks from a landlord who had 
had three or four smaller buildings, 
and my dad’s company had done the ex-
terminating. The guy hadn’t paid for 6 
months. I traveled, and it took me 
about an hour to an hour and a half on 
two buses to get to this man’s door. I 
knocked. He opened the door. 
I said, you know: I am CHUCK SCHU-
MER, the son of Abe Schumer of Cen-
tury Exterminating. You owe us 6 
months. We have been doing a good job 
of exterminating your house. 
Do you know what he said to me? 
Your dad is a small business man. He 
can’t afford a lawyer. He can’t afford 
anything to go after me. I am not pay-
ing. 
This is the anguish that small busi-
ness people face, so we need to help 
them. We need to help them. 
That is one of the many reasons I am 
so proud of the American Rescue 
Plan—because it provides tens of bil-
lions of dollars in support for small 
businesses that have suffered during 
the pandemic. The American Rescue 
Plan is nothing short of a lifeline for 
Main Street businesses from one end of 
this country to the other: Main Street 
businesses in rural America, Main 
Street businesses in suburban America, 
and Main Street businesses in urban 
America and in our inner cities. It is a 
lifeline. 
For starters, the American Rescue 
Plan 
provides 
$30 
billion 
for 
res-
taurants and bars through the RES-
TAURANTS Act—the first bipartisan 
amendment added to the bill—spon-
sored by Senators SINEMA and WICKER. 
The American Rescue Plan also in-
cludes more than $1 billion in addi-
tional support for our Nation’s small 
theaters and venues, adding to a grant 
program I helped create in December 
called the Save our Stages Act. These 
independent art venues, restaurants, 
and places like that—churches—are the 
hardest hit because that is where peo-
ple gather. When they are not gath-
ering, there is no income whether it be 
the money they pay the small business, 
the checks they pay at the restaurants 
or the money they leave on the collec-
tion plates, when they are not there, in 
our religious institutions. So this is a 
good thing. 
I want to say one more thing about 
Save our Stages. It not only includes 
more money for Save our Stages; it in-
cludes an amendment I authored to 
allow venue owners to apply for aid 
through Save our Stages without los-
ing eligibility for traditional small 
business grants through the PPP. So 
that is a change that our arts institu-
tions and our independent venues and 
theaters should know—that they could 
get both the PPP and Save our Stages. 
Now, these venues, the small busi-
nesses of many types, the nonprofits, 
they are the lifeblood of our commu-
nities. They were the first to close; 
they will be the last to open. 
I am hopeful that the support we 
passed in the American Rescue Plan 
will help our small businesses, our the-
aters, our music venues, and our res-
taurants to hold on until we can all 
gather safely once again. 
That is not all. The American Rescue 
Plan provides $15 billion in flexible, 
targeted grants to help small busi-
nesses that have had a hard time ac-
cessing relief over the last 12 months, 
including most nonprofits and church-
es. Up to 90 percent of minority-owned 
small businesses will qualify for this 
funding, closing the racial gap and 
keeping local economies from deterio-
rating further. 
We invest $10 billion in State, local, 
and Tribal small business financing 
programs. 
We expand the employee retention 
tax credit so that businesses of any size 
can more easily keep their workers on 
the payroll because that one doesn’t 
have an employee number limit. 
Finally, we bolstered and expanded 
the popular Paycheck Protection Pro-
gram to include more nonprofits, in-
cluding labor and agricultural organi-
zations that unfortunately, in Decem-
ber, 
our 
Republican 
colleagues 
wouldn’t let in. 
In a nutshell, the American Rescue 
Plan provides a colossal boost for our 
Nation’s small businesses and will 
make sure that all of them, not just 
those with the right connections, can 
access relief. It will help millions of 
Americans keep their jobs, retain their 
incomes, and support their families 
during this recovery. 
Now, we know many of these busi-
nesses are not out of the woods yet. 
There is still some time until our coun-
try can fully open up, until families eat 
inside their favorite restaurant or col-
leagues can meet at a bar for happy 
hour, until we can see one of our favor-
ite performers put on a concert. But we 
are already seeing signs of hope. 
As a Washington Post headline an-
nounced recently, ‘‘Companies are scal-
ing back layoffs because of [the Amer-
ican Rescue Plan].’’ Let me say that 
again, proudly and happily. ‘‘Compa-
nies are scaling back layoffs because of 
[the American Rescue Plan],’’ and the 
Senate, I assure the American people, 
is going to keep working to make sure 
that the support for our businesses re-
mains intact over the next few months. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

The

The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, I

FILIBUSTER 
Mr. 
MCCONNELL. 
Mr. 
President, 
today I would like to begin with a few 
quotations. 
The legislative filibuster . . . is the most 
important distinction between the Senate 
and the House. Without the 60-vote threshold 
for 
legislation, 
the 
Senate 
becomes 
a 
majoritarian institution like the House, 
much more subject to the whims of short- 
term electoral change. No Senator would 
like to see that happen. So let’s find a way 
to further protect the 60-vote rule for legisla-
tion.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1533 
March 16, 2021 
That was the current Democratic 
leader, Senator SCHUMER, in April of 
2017, less than 4 years ago. 
Now, here is another quote, Mr. 
President: 
What about [the] nuclear option doing 
away with the filibuster? 
I can tell you that would be the end of the 
Senate as it was originally devised and cre-
ated going back to our Founding Fathers. We 
have to acknowledge our respect for the mi-
nority, and that is what the Senate tries to 
do in its composition and in its procedure. 
That was the assistant Democratic 
leader, Senator DURBIN, in 2018, about 3 
years ago. 
A few years ago, 33 Members of the 
Democratic side signed a letter insist-
ing that ‘‘we preserve existing rules, 
practices, and traditions’’ regarding 
legislation. Now, under pressure from 
the outside, many of our Democratic 
colleagues are abandoning their stated 
principles as fast as possible. 
Yesterday, Senator DURBIN said the 
filibuster is not a core principle but 
‘‘an offhanded clerical suggestion.’’ An 
offhanded clerical suggestion. 
A number of Senate Democrats are 
trying to pressure the senior Senators 
from West Virginia and Arizona to 
abandon their own very recent commit-
ments to honor this central rule of the 
Senate. 
The Framers designed the Senate to 
require deliberation, to force coopera-
tion, and to ensure that Federal laws 
in our big, diverse country earn broad 
enough buy-in to receive the lasting 
consent of the government. James 
Madison said the Senate should be a 
‘‘complicated 
check’’ 
against 
‘‘im-
proper acts of legislation.’’ Thomas 
Jefferson said that ‘‘great innovations 
should not be forced on slender majori-
ties.’’ 
Senate Democrats parroted all these 
arguments when they were the ones 
benefiting from minority protection. 
When President Trump pressed Repub-
licans to kill the filibuster, our Demo-
cratic colleagues cried foul. When our 
Republican majority stood on principle 
and refused to wreck the rules, our 
Democratic colleagues happily used 
the filibuster themselves. In some 
cases, they flat-out blocked legislation, 
like Senator TIM SCOTT’s police reform 
bill. In many other cases, Democrats 
did what minority parties always do 
and leveraged the existence of the fili-
buster to influence must-pass legisla-
tion long before it got to the floor. 
There is so much emphasis on the 
most extreme bills that either party 
might pass with a simple majority. 
People forget that the Senate’s 60-vote 
threshold is the only reason—the only 
reason—that any routine, must-pass 
legislation is bipartisan except during 
divided government. Big funding deals, 
appropriations bills, farm bills, high-
way bills, the NDAA—the Senate’s 60- 
vote threshold backstops all of it. It is 
not just about controversial items; it is 
about everything we do. 
The Senate Democrats who are pres-
suring our colleagues from Arizona and 
West Virginia to reverse themselves 
are not just arguing for some proce-
dural tweak, not a procedural tweak; 
they are arguing for a radically less 
stable and less consensus-driven sys-
tem of government. Forget about en-
during laws with broad support; noth-
ing in Federal law would ever be set-
tled. 
Does anyone really believe the Amer-
ican people were voting for an entirely 
new system of government by electing 
Joe Biden to the White House and a 50– 
50 Senate? This is a 50–50 Senate. There 
was no mandate to completely trans-
form America by the American people 
on November 3. That may be what a 
few liberal activists want, but does 
anyone believe that millions of Ameri-
cans thought that is what they were 
electing? Of course not. 
There is an ironic element to this 
whole conversation. Some Democratic 
Senators seem to imagine this would 
be a tidy tradeoff. If they could just 
break the rules on a razor-thin major-
ity, sure, it might damage the institu-
tion, but then nothing would stand be-
tween them and their entire agenda—a 
new era of fast-track policymaking. 
But anyone who really knows the Sen-
ate knows that is not what would hap-
pen. 
So let me say this very clearly for all 
99 of my colleagues: Nobody serving in 
this Chamber can even begin—can even 
begin—to imagine what a completely 
scorched-earth Senate would look like. 
None of us have served 1 minute in 
the 
Senate 
that 
was 
completely 
drained of comity and consent. This is 
an institution that requires unanimous 
consent to turn the lights on before 
noon, to proceed with a garden-variety 
floor speech, to dispense with the read-
ing of lengthy legislative text, to 
schedule committee business, and to 
move even noncontroversial nominees 
at anything besides a snail’s pace. 
So I want our colleagues to imagine 
a world where every single task—every 
one 
of 
them—requires 
a 
physical 
quorum, which, by the way, the Vice 
President does not count in deter-
mining a quorum. Everything that 
Democratic Senates did to Presidents 
Bush and Trump and everything the 
Republican Senate did to President 
Obama would be child’s play compared 
to the disaster that Democrats would 
create for their own priorities if—if— 
they break the Senate. 
So this is not a tradeoff between 
trampling etiquette but then getting to 
quickly transform the country. That is 
a false choice. Even the most basic as-
pects of our colleagues’ agenda, the 
most mundane tasks of the Biden Pres-
idency, would actually be harder— 
harder—not easier for Democrats in a 
post-nuclear Senate that is 50–50, dead 
even. 
If the Democrats break the rules to 
kill rule XXII on a 50–50 basis, then we 
will use every other rule to make tens 
of millions of Americans’ voices heard. 
Perhaps the majority would come after 
the other rules next. Perhaps rule XXII 
would just be the first domino of many, 
until the Senate ceases to be distinct 
from the House in any respect. This 
chaos would not open up an express 
lane to liberal change. It would not 
open up an express lane for the Biden 
Presidency to speed into the history 
books. The Senate would be more like 
a 100-car pileup—nothing moving. 
And then there is the small matter 
that majorities are actually never per-
manent. The last time a Democratic 
leader was trying to start a nuclear ex-
change, I remember offering a warning. 
I said my colleagues would regret it a 
lot sooner than they thought. In just a 
few years and a few Supreme Court va-
cancies later, many of my Democratic 
colleagues said publicly that they did. 
Touching the hot stove again would 
yield the same result but even more 
dramatic. 
As soon as Republicans wound up 
back in the saddle, we wouldn’t just 
erase every liberal change that hurt 
the country. We would strengthen 
America with all kinds of conservative 
policies, with zero—zero—input from 
the other side. How about this: nation-
wide right-to-work for working Ameri-
cans; defunding Planned Parenthood 
and sanctuary cities on day one; a 
whole new era of domestic energy pro-
duction; sweeping new protections for 
conscience and the right to life of the 
unborn; concealed-carry reciprocity in 
all 50 States and the District of Colum-
bia; and massive hardening of the secu-
rity on our southern border. 
We saw during amendment votes, 
just days ago, that some commonsense 
Republican positions actually enjoy 
more support right now than some of 
the Democratic committee chairs’ pri-
orities, and this is with them in the 
majority. 
So 
the 
pendulum 
would 
swing both ways, and it would swing 
hard. 
My colleagues and I have refused to 
kill the Senate for instant gratifi-
cation. In 2017 and in 2018, I was lobbied 
to do exactly what Democrats want to 
do now. A sitting President leaned on 
me to do it. He tweeted about it. What 
did I do? I said to the President at that 
time: No. I said ‘‘no’’ repeatedly, be-
cause being a U.S. Senator comes with 
higher duties than steamrolling any 
obstacle to short-term power. I meant 
it. Republicans meant it. 
Less than 2 months ago, two of our 
Democratic colleagues said they mean 
it too. If they keep their word, we have 
a bipartisan majority that can put 
principle first and keep the Senate 
safe. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I ask

S1534 
March 16, 2021 
DEATH TAX 
Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, last week 
I introduced a bill to permanently re-
peal the death tax. 
I have been pushing to repeal the 
death tax for a long time because I 
have seen the consequences the tax can 
have for family farms and ranches and 
for family businesses. And I am proud 
that we protected a lot of family farms 
and businesses 3 years ago with the Tax 
Cuts and Jobs Act by doubling the 
death tax exemption, but the death tax 
is still a big problem. 
First of all, the change we made to 
the death tax in the Tax Cuts and Jobs 
Act isn’t permanent. The increased ex-
emption level expires at the end of 2025. 
Second, Democrats, who are always 
eager to seize any possible revenue 
source, have proposed not merely re-
turning the exemption to its previous 
level but reducing it even further. And 
that would be a big problem for a lot of 
family farms and businesses. 
The death tax is a fundamentally 
flawed idea, both in theory and in prac-
tice. Every American, of course, has an 
obligation to pay taxes to help support 
our government, but there should be a 
limit to how many times the govern-
ment can tax you. And death should 
not be a taxable event. 
The money you leave at your death 
has already been taxed by the govern-
ment at least once, which makes the 
death tax double taxation. 
People who support the death tax 
tend to talk as if the death tax only af-
fects the fabulously wealthy, but that 
isn’t the case. Small- and medium- 
sized businesses, family farms, and 
ranches spend a lot of time and money 
on estate planning to avoid being hit 
by this tax. Farmers and ranchers in 
my State know, without careful and 
costly planning, the Federal Govern-
ment can come around after their 
death demanding a staggering 40 per-
cent of their taxable estate, and their 
children won’t have the money to pay 
without risking the farm or the ranch. 
Why? Well, farming and ranching is 
often a cash-poor business. 
A 
farmer 
might, 
technically, 
be 
worth several million dollars, but the 
vast majority of that is land and farm-
ing equipment. Only a small fraction of 
it is money in the bank. 
The Farm Bureau reports that over 
the past 10 years, the value of farmland 
has increased by nearly 50 percent. It is 
completely possible that a farmer’s 
land 
might 
have 
substantially 
in-
creased in value over the past decade, 
while his income has barely increased 
at all or, with commodity prices the 
past few years, they may have been los-
ing money. In fact, it is perfectly pos-
sible that in a bad year, a farm with 
several million dollars’ worth of land 
might barely break even income-wise. 
So what happens when a farmer dies? 
Well, the Federal Government will 
claim up to 40 percent of his taxable es-
tate. But his liquid assets—in other 
words, the cash he has available—will 
likely not come close to covering the 
tax bill from the Federal Government. 
And so the only thing left for his chil-
dren to do will be to start selling off 
farm equipment and land. In some 
cases, they will be able to keep the 
farm, just a smaller version of it. In 
others, they may have to sell off the 
family farm entirely. The same thing 
can happen with family-owned busi-
nesses. 
In the case of a larger family-owned 
business, the business owner may be 
worth $15 or $20 million, but only a 
small fraction of that may be money in 
the bank. The vast majority may be 
tied up in the business. In that case, 
when the Federal Government comes 
around demanding 40 percent of the 
taxable estate, all the money that that 
business owner had in the bank won’t 
even come close to covering the tax 
bill. 
To pay the Federal Government, the 
owner’s descendants will have to sell 
off part or all of the family business. 
And this can happen again and again. 
Think about a business that was 
started half a century ago and passed 
down from father to daughter, to 
grandson. With every death, the Fed-
eral Government will have come de-
manding a big chunk of that estate. By 
the time you get to the third genera-
tion, the business may be struggling to 
stay afloat if it is still around at all. 
I recently read testimony from a 
business owner who stated that, with-
out death tax reform, the family com-
pany will end with him. Why? Because 
the company will have to be sold to 
meet the tax bill the Federal Govern-
ment will hand his descendants. The 
company has already faced the death 
tax multiple times in its history and 
given millions upon millions to the 
Federal Government. This next death 
tax bill will be the death blow. 
I am proud that Republicans im-
proved the death tax situation for a lot 
of family farms and businesses by pass-
ing estate tax reform in the Tax Cuts 
and Jobs Act, but doubling the exemp-
tion is not enough. There are still fam-
ily farms and businesses out there that 
aren’t protected from this tax. And in 
my view, losing even one family farm 
or ranch or business to the death tax is 
one too many, not to mention the fact 
that in less than 5 years, the expanded 
exemption will expire putting many 
farms and businesses back in the tax’s 
crosshairs. 
Family farms and businesses play a 
vital role in the economy and in com-
munities. Family farms and ranches 
are the lifeblood literally of rural com-
munities in South Dakota. They are a 
source of jobs. They provide support for 
local businesses. They help build up 
local schools and local infrastructure. 
Losing a local farm can hit rural com-
munities very hard. 
It is mind-boggling that the Federal 
Government imposes a tax that pun-
ishes all the things we should be en-
couraging. The death tax punishes hard 
work. It punishes success. It punishes 
innovation. ‘‘Success’’ should not be a 
dirty word, and families and employees 
should not be punished because a fam-
ily has worked hard and built up a suc-
cessful farm or ranch or business. 
On top of all this, the death tax is an 
inefficient tax that raises a small 
amount of revenue while placing a very 
large burden on farmers and ranchers 
and small business men and women. 
Repealing the death tax is an idea 
that has won bipartisan support in the 
past, including support from more than 
one sitting Democratic Senator. I hope 
it will win bipartisan support in this 
Congress as well. And I will continue to 
fight to ensure that no family farm or 
business has to worry about this pun-
ishing tax. 
I said it before, and I will say it 
again: One family farm or business lost 
is one too many. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

The

Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask to 
speak as if in morning business. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
FILIBUSTER 
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, it is 
flattering when the Republican Senate 
leader comes to the floor and mentions 
your name, and Senator MCCONNELL 
did just that this morning. 
The issue was the filibuster. Senator 
MCCONNELL found a quote several years 
ago where I spoke in favor of the fili-
buster to protect minority rights in 
the Senate. It is true. I did say that. It 
was based on life experience. Having al-
ready served in the Senate for a num-
ber of years, I came to understand how 
it evolved as one of the procedures in 
the Senate. 
But I have to say to you that my im-
pression of the filibuster changed, and 
the reason it changed was none other 
than the Republican Senate majority 
leader, now minority leader, Senator 
MCCONNELL. You see, the filibuster 
really was created in the Senate 
through its own rules, as I explained 
yesterday, and it came to define the 
Senate in this respect. The Founding 
Fathers looked to the Senate to pro-
vide 
two 
representatives—literally, 
Senators—from each State, regardless 
of population, so smaller States, back 
in the original Colonies, like Delaware, 
would have the same number of Sen-
ators as a large State, like Virginia. 
That was their intention. 
So the protection of minority rights 
was kind of built into the definition of 
the U.S. Senate, and the filibuster be-
came its manifestation in the daily 
procedure of the Senate. Under that fil-
ibuster, of course, one Senator could 
stop the debate, or at least slow it

S1535 
March 16, 2021 
down, by insisting on a filibuster, only 
to be stopped by an extraordinary ma-
jority of the Senate voting to return to 
the regular business. 
That was the case in 1957 because, in 
August of 1957, Senator Strom Thur-
mond took to the floor of this U.S. 
Senate and initiated the longest fili-
buster in its history. For 24 hours and 
18 minutes, the man stood by his desk 
and spoke without stopping. He didn’t 
have any permission to leave the floor 
for any reason and certainly couldn’t 
sit down without losing his filibuster. 
He did it. He did it for the wrong rea-
son, I am afraid, because he was trying 
to stop the march of civil rights in this 
country, but he did it. Determinedly, 
he achieved that goal. 
When he did, in 1957, that was the 
broken fifth filibuster in the history of 
the Senate in the previous five decades. 
In other words, if you went back to 1919 
and all the way to 1957, Strom Thur-
mond’s was the fifth time in history a 
filibuster was broken. Once every dec-
ade, a filibuster was broken on the Sen-
ate floor. 
Well, that world has changed—dra-
matically changed. We can now have 
five filibusters in a couple of weeks. We 
now have, on average, 80 filibusters a 
year because of the urging and direc-
tion of the Senator from Kentucky, 
Senator MCCONNELL. He has institu-
tionalized the filibuster to the point 
where it is now the normal course of 
business, not an extraordinary proce-
dure. 
I recounted the fact that I introduced 
the DREAM Act 20 years ago—20 years 
ago. DURBIN, what kind of a Senator 
are you that in 20 years you can’t pass 
the DREAM Act? Well, I brought it to 
the Senate floor on five different occa-
sions, and on five different occasions it 
was stopped by the filibuster. Other 
Members can tell the story of their leg-
islative experience on the floor too. 
The point I am getting to is this: It 
wasn’t until Senator MCCONNELL and 
the Republicans who follow him de-
cided to make the filibuster just daily 
business in the Senate that it was 
abused to the point where the Senate 
stopped doing regular legislative busi-
ness. 
I would like Senator MCCONNELL to 
come to the floor the next opportunity 
he has and explain this to me. In the 
last calendar year, 2020, the Senate 
considered 29 amendments on the floor 
of the Senate in the entire year. Now, 
that doesn’t count a vote-arama, which 
is an aberration that I don’t think 
would ever be accused of being delib-
erative. But 29 regular-order amend-
ments during the course of a year—em-
barrassing, isn’t it? When you think of 
this great so-called debating society, 29 
times we brought an amendment to the 
floor? Well, it was an improvement—an 
improvement over the previous year, a 
30-percent improvement, in fact—be-
cause in the year 2019, under Senator 
MCCONNELL’s leadership, we had 22 
amendments. 
So when Senator MCCONNELL
and 
others come to the floor and plead for 
us to hang on to the traditions of the 
Senate, I would tell you that their in-
terpretation of the traditions is stran-
gling this body. They have beaten the 
old filibuster to the point where it is 
hardly recognizable and is now the reg-
ular order of business in the U.S. Sen-
ate. 
That is why many of us, frustrated 
with having worked so hard to come 
here, wanting to do the best we can to 
represent the people who have sent us 
here, are so frustrated by the current 
state of procedure. And for Senator 
MCCONNELL and other Republicans to 
come to the floor and plead for hanging 
on to this tradition is actually plead-
ing for the Senate to continue to do 
less and less each year. 
There are those of us now in control 
on the majority side—the bare major-
ity side—on the Democratic side, who 
really believe there is much more to be 
done in the Senate. The American peo-
ple expect us to respond. 
Now, you might ask: Well, how did 
you pass the American Rescue Plan if 
there is a filibuster used so frequently? 
It was under a process called reconcili-
ation, which depends on a majority 
vote. You can’t filibuster under the 
reconciliation. That is why this amaz-
ing bill, this new law, the American 
Rescue Plan by President Biden, is so 
sweeping in its reach. We had to try to 
combine, under this law, so many pro-
visions that had been affected by the 
pandemic and the state of the economy 
because we knew that returning to the 
regular order of business with the fili-
buster looming every single day would 
tie our hands just as sure as we have 
seen in the past several years. 
So, Senator MCCONNELL, thank you 
for mentioning my name, but if I be-
came skeptical of the filibuster, it is 
because of your use of it. I hope that 
you understand that you can’t have it 
both ways. It can’t be a rare procedure 
and be a procedure that dominates the 
actual business of the Senate as this 
has done for so many years. 
CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. President, last year I came to the 
floor on multiple occasions to ask con-
sent for a simple, sensible resolution. 
It called for the United States to co-
operate in global efforts to address the 
COVID pandemic. At that time, that 
point was obvious, and it is even more 
obvious today. 
Pandemics 
don’t 
respect 
borders. 
None of us is safe from highly infec-
tious diseases until all of us are safe. 
That is especially important to keep in 
mind as we begin to turn a corner here 
in America. 
Last week, during his first address to 
the Nation, President Biden announced 
that all adults in America over the age 
of 18 will be eligible for vaccinations on 
May 1 of this year. If all goes to plan, 
we can look forward, as President 
Biden mentioned, to a Fourth of July 
with family and close friends at a close 
distance. 
Considering what they inherited, the 
Biden administration deserves credit 
for dramatically scaling up vaccina-
tions in America. The administration 
helped to strike a historic partnership 
between rival drugmakers, ramped up 
manufacture of the vaccine, and im-
proved coordination with State offi-
cials everywhere. 
We are seeing a world of difference 
that this makes. When you put com-
petent, qualified leadership in charge 
in the White House and in State cap-
itols, good things happen. Our weekly 
vaccine shipments in Illinois have 
nearly doubled. The Federal Govern-
ment has erected a mass vaccination 
site at the United Center in Chicago. It 
has also supported partnerships with 
community health centers and retail 
pharmacies to expand access to vac-
cines. A cautious hopefulness is wash-
ing over America, but we can’t lose 
momentum in our fight against COVID. 
To put this pandemic really behind 
us and to bury it in history, we need to 
lend a hand to the many poor nations 
that have yet to receive a single dose 
of vaccine. The inequities are stark. 
Ten countries have accounted for 75 
percent of the total vaccinations ad-
ministered worldwide, while approxi-
mately 100 countries have yet to ad-
minister any vaccine doses. This dan-
gerous shortfall has the potential to 
undermine the good work that is hap-
pening here in America. Closing this 
gap is not only the right and moral 
thing to do, it is the safest and smart-
est thing to do to stop the threat 
COVID, and its increasingly contagious 
variants, pose to us all. 
Remember back a little over a year 
ago, an obscure city in China generated 
a virus—we think they did—that ended 
up circling the world many times over 
and changing life on this planet. 
Last month, I received a briefing 
from Dr. Fauci on the new genetic 
mutations of COVID–19. He shared 
troubling news about variants that are 
emerging 
in 
the 
United 
Kingdom, 
South Africa, and Brazil. Some of them 
may have more resistance to our cur-
rent vaccines than we care to see. He 
warned that if we fail to stamp out the 
virus globally, then we will continue to 
see risks within our own borders. 
Variants of the virus could counteract 
the tremendous progress we have made 
and the progress that we are poised to 
make in the near future. 
As I said at the outset, viruses don’t 
recognize borders. Crushing the virus 
in other countries is a strategic invest-
ment in our own national safety and 
security. President Biden understands 
this. He is serious about addressing the 
virus first in America and then around 
the world. He has set us on a pace to 
vaccinate all eligible Americans over 
the course of the next several months. 
Let me urge those who are hesitant 
or skeptical as to whether it is the 
right thing to do, do it, please—for 
yourself, for those you love, and for 
this Nation. 
President Biden wisely halted Presi-
dent Trump’s withdrawal from the 
World Health Organization. He joined

the global COVAX vaccine effort, and 
he allocated significant funding toward 
global vaccination efforts, funding that 
is expanded under the American Rescue 
Plan, which we passed just a few weeks 
ago in the Senate. 
Secretary of the Treasury Janet 
Yellen recently announced that the 
United States will support the issuance 
of special drawing rights, a type of IMF 
foreign exchange reserve that can help 
poor countries buy vaccines and weath-
er the economic fallout from the pan-
demic, a welcome move that I encour-
aged and was a coauthor of with Sen-
ator 
SANDERS
and 
Congressman 
‘‘CHUY’’ GARCI´A. 
Just last week, the President an-
nounced a partnership with key allies 
in the Pacific region to provide at least 
1 billion COVID vaccines in countries 
in Asia. This is prescient, global lead-
ership long overdue. The President’s 
actions will save lives here at home 
and abroad, and these investments will 
fuel a global economic recovery, which 
we all want to see. 
To understand why a global strategy 
is called for, look at history. Some of 
you who are witnessing this statement 
on the floor at home may be old 
enough to have a distinct circular scar 
on your upper arm. Maybe you have 
seen it on the arms of a parent or 
grandparent. That mark is a relic from 
one of the world’s greatest public 
health victories: the eradication of the 
deadly smallpox virus. 
The fact that so few people living 
today remember the death and misery 
caused by that disease is a testament 
to the global public health strategy 
that stopped it. Smallpox was one of 
the most devastating diseases to afflict 
mankind. It is estimated to have killed 
up to 300 million people in the 20th cen-
tury, 500 million people in the last hun-
dred years. 
In 1967, the World Health Organiza-
tion launched a historic international 
effort to eradicate it. It was one of the 
most successful public health initia-
tives in human history. Next month 
marks the 41st anniversary of that his-
toric achievement. 
In the years since, America has led 
similar global efforts to stamp out dis-
eases like polio and Ebola. If we follow 
in these footsteps, historians will one 
day add COVID to the top of that list of 
historic achievements. 
Pursuing a global strategy is the 
most effective way—maybe the only 
way—to accelerate vaccine production 
and distribution in every corner of the 
world. By sharing our wealth of knowl-
edge and resources with the world, we 
reap 
lifesaving 
benefits, 
not 
just 
around the world but right here at 
home. 
We all know public health is bigger 
than partisanship and always has been. 
In the 2000s, for example, I called on 
then-President Bush to help stem the 
scourge of AIDS around the world 
through the historic PEPFAR Pro-
gram. At the time, many of my Repub-
lican friends in the Senate supported 
it. I hope and expect that they will do 
the same when it comes to supporting 
the global effort against COVID–19. The 
moment calls for nothing less. 
Public 
health 
experts 
understand 
that. 
President 
Biden 
understands 
that. I know we here in Congress un-
derstand that. We can end the threat of 
COVID once and for all. It is within our 
power. 
UNITED STATES POSTAL SERVICE 
Mr. President, let me start this 
statement by saying I am a fan of the 
U.S. 
Postal 
Service. 
I 
have 
been 
throughout my life. I believe the men 
and women who make the Postal Serv-
ice work do a great service to this 
country and distinguish us from many 
countries in the world that don’t have 
anything near our service or reliability 
in delivering the mail. Having said 
that, and believe it to my inner being, 
the Postal Service needs to take a hard 
look at what is going on within their 
ranks today. 
Last month, the U.S. Postal Service 
Great Lakes area sent out the postal 
equivalent of an SOS. It put out the 
call to mail carriers in five sur-
rounding States asking for letter car-
riers to come to my State of Illinois to 
help deliver a huge backlog of undeliv-
ered mail. It also called for mail car-
riers to help deliver Chicago’s mail on 
Sundays. 
Ken Labbe is one of the mail carriers 
who answered that call for help. Mr. 
Labbe has been a mail carrier in Mount 
Prospect, IL, just outside of Chicago, 
for 28 years. He is the president of the 
local letter carriers union. He is also 
quite an athlete. In 2002, he was the 
only male mail carrier on the USPS- 
sponsored professional cycling team. 
He volunteered for the last Sunday in 
February. He figured he had the knowl-
edge and endurance to help reduce the 
mail backlog that had plagued the 
Postal Service in Chicago. What he dis-
covered, he said, stunned him. At every 
home he delivered to, he stuffed 20 to 30 
pieces of mail in the mailbox. He 
worked 12 hours on that Sunday, from 
6 a.m. to 6 p.m., sunup to sundown, 
without a break, even for lunch. Still, 
he couldn’t complete the assigned 
workload; the sheer volume of back-
logged mail was too great. Inside the 
local post office, Ken said, he found 
packages stacked everywhere. Some 
appeared to have been there for a 
month or more. The entire situation 
looked, in his words, ‘‘like an episode 
of ‘Extreme Hoarders.’’’ ‘‘A crisis.’’ 
Chicagoland is not the only postal 
chaos location. Nearly 9 months after a 
new Postmaster General unveiled his 
surprise reorganization plan, postal 
service in much of the Nation is er-
ratic. Delays are longer than ever. 
The delivery times have shrunk to 
historic lows since Louis DeJoy took 
over last June. At the end of December, 
the Agency had an on-time rate of 38 
percent for nonlocal mail. What was it 
1 year earlier? Ninety-two percent. A 
92-percent on-time rate descended to 38 
percent 
under 
Postmaster 
General 
DeJoy. 
Before Louis DeJoy took over, 91 per-
cent of Postal Service customers gave 
USPS high marks—one of the highest 
approval ratings of any government 
Agency. 
Today, 
postal 
customers 
across America—certainly in my State 
of Illinois—customers wait anxiously 
for important checks and bills that ar-
rive weeks late, if at all. They check 
tracking websites to search for delayed 
packages, only to read that the pack-
age is ‘‘out for delivery.’’ 
In some neighborhoods in Chicago, 
residents have given up hope of receiv-
ing mail at home. They stand in line 
for hours at the local post office to try 
to retrieve their mail themselves. 
Often, even that doesn’t work. 
Tracey Otis is one of those people. 
One day last month, she was one of 40 
customers—40—waiting in line at the 
Postal Service station in the Gresham 
neighborhood on the South Side of Chi-
cago. Ms. Otis hadn’t had regular mail 
delivery since Christmas. She waited in 
line for hours, hoping to retrieve a 
package of diabetic test strips before 
her current supply ran out. She told a 
Chicago Sun-Times reporter that she 
would volunteer to sort the mail if it 
would help. She went home empty-
handed that day, still not sure where 
her package was or when, if ever, she 
might see it. 
Last month, my staff in Chicago esti-
mated that there might be 300 pieces of 
mail sitting undelivered in four Chi-
cago postal facilities. We based that on 
the number of complaints we received 
in our office. After that, the Postal In-
spector General released a report that 
showed we were wrong. There weren’t 
300 letters in postal limbo in these fa-
cilities; there were 19,000 undelivered 
pieces of mail in those four facilities. 
Since then, in my State, the chaos 
has stretched way beyond Chicago. We 
hear from all over the State: Spring-
field, 
Champaign-Urbana, 
Belleville, 
East St. Louis, Quincy, Peoria, the 
Quad 
Cities, 
and 
Rockford. 
These 
delays in Illinois and across America 
are causing real hardship for tens of 
millions of Americans waiting for mail 
delivery. 
Patients 
and 
pharmacists 
complain about late medication. Peo-
ple are getting dinged for late mort-
gage and utility payments and forced 
to pay late fees. Insurance policies are 
being canceled because of late pay-
ments. Small business owners are 
forced to wait weeks or months for 
payments. Others are flooded with calls 
and emails from customers wondering 
where their packages are—a good way 
to lose business. 
Who is Louis DeJoy, the mastermind 
of this mess? Did he come through the 
ranks of the Postal Service, like four 
Postmasters General before him? No. 
His qualifications? He is a former logis-
tics executive who donated millions of 
dollars to Donald Trump and the Re-
publicans—no experience working at 
the 
Postal 
Service 
before 
Donald 
Trump tapped him to head this Agency 
last June. 
One month later, in the middle of a 
pandemic that turned postal deliveries

March 16, 2021 
into a lifeline for many, Mr. DeJoy un-
veiled a radical plan to reorganize the 
Postal Service, after only 1 month in 
the job and no experience in the De-
partment. He slashed overtime hours, 
prohibited late and extra mail delivery 
trips, and set stricter delivery sched-
ules. 
In August, with no public expla-
nation, the Postal Service began re-
moving mail-sorting machines from 
postal facilities around the country, re-
ducing their ability to process mail. 
Amazingly, the Postal Service Inspec-
tor 
General 
determined 
that 
the 
changes were ordered with no analysis 
and no understanding of how they 
might affect timeliness of mail deliv-
ery. A Federal lawsuit forced the Agen-
cy to put the changes on hold until 
after the election. 
On February 6, Mr. DeJoy was quoted 
in the Washington Post saying that his 
new plan for reorganizing the Postal 
Service would be ready for public re-
lease ‘‘as early as next week.’’ He said 
that on February 6. We are still wait-
ing for it, waiting for the DeJoy plan 
to shape up the Postal Service. It is 
like waiting for a lost package. 
We know some of the biggest changes 
he intends to propose because he has 
confirmed them publicly. The DeJoy 
plan for shaping up the post office is 
expected to call for the following: more 
service cuts, higher prices, and slower 
mail delivery. If that sounds like a 
winning combination to you, I have 
some vintage computers to sell to your 
business. In short, this is not a solu-
tion; this is sabotage of an essential 
public service, and we shouldn’t tol-
erate it. 
Well, America has a new President 
who understands that affordable, effi-
cient postal service is essential to 
America. Five days after taking office, 
President Biden replaced the Chair of 
the Postal Regulatory Commission. 
Late last month, he filled three vacan-
cies of the Postal Service Board of Gov-
ernors, the body that hires the Post-
master General and oversees the Postal 
Service. 
I encourage President Biden to make 
all the changes necessary to rescue the 
Postal Service. Mr. DeJoy has offered a 
stream of excuses for the chaos that 
has fallen the Postal Service since he 
showed up. He says it is the pandemic, 
the Christmas holidays, bad weather, 
an election that saw a record number 
of Americans vote by mail. He has a 
list as long as your arm. 
I would remind him that in 1864, we 
held a national election in the middle 
of a Civil War, and 150,000 Union Army 
troops voted absentee from the field. 
The Postal Service is as old as America 
itself. It has proven that it can adapt 
to crises with the right leadership. If 
Mr. DeJoy cannot or will not provide 
that leadership, I respectfully suggest 
he step down. 
I yield the floor. 
Mr. LEAHY. I suggest the absence of 
a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to 
call the roll. 
Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
NOMINATION OF ISABELLA CASILLAS GUZMAN 
Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I 
rise in support of Isabella Guzman, cur-
rently the director of California’s Of-
fice of the Small Business Advocate— 
the Presiding Officer’s State—to be the 
Administrator of the U.S. Small Busi-
ness Administration. 
We all know the importance of small 
businesses and how they have been hit 
so hard during this pandemic. Small 
businesses employ nearly half of all 
private sector workers and make out-
sized contributions to the innovation 
that makes America’s economy strong. 
Yet the coronavirus has put millions of 
people out of business, hundreds of 
thousands 
of 
these 
mom-and-pop, 
brick-and-mortar retail shops out of 
business, and restaurants out of busi-
ness. 
We are so pleased that there is, as we 
say in Minnesota, a lighthouse that we 
are looking to now. I was up in Duluth 
on Sunday, and instead of the light at 
the end of the tunnel, which so many of 
us talk about with regard to the end of 
this pandemic, the mayor there re-
ferred to it as a lighthouse, for they 
have a lot of lighthouses on Lake Supe-
rior. The end of this pandemic is our 
lighthouse. We see the blinking lights 
from a distance, but we know we are 
not there yet. To get there, we not only 
need to get this vaccine to every per-
son—and the President has said we will 
have vaccines available by the end of 
May for every adult in America—but 
we have to get it distributed, and our 
pandemic bill certainly is going to be a 
major step toward getting that done. 
We also need to get our business 
economy back in order. We need to be 
able to not be so far down in the 
ground that we can’t climb out of 
where we are. That is why having Ms. 
Guzman in place—someone with her 
record and her ability to lead and who 
served as the Deputy Chief of Staff and 
as the Senior Adviser at the Small 
Business Administration during the 
Obama administration—is so impor-
tant. 
She will oversee the Paycheck Pro-
tection Program, which we established 
on a bipartisan basis in March of 2020 
as part of the CARES Act, as she un-
derstands the need for greater equity 
in loan distribution and has shown a 
commitment to transparency and accu-
rate loan data. She has made clear that 
she will make the Paycheck Protection 
Program more accessible to businesses 
that have traditionally not had access 
to the banking relationships needed to 
secure loans and grants. 
Very significantly to me and to those 
of us who worked on the Save our 
Stages bill, including Senator CORNYN 
of Texas, who led the bill with me, she 
has made clear that she will move on 
the grant program immediately. We 
have been working with the staff there, 
and we have given these venues that 
have been shuttered—the first to close 
and the last to reopen—the ability to 
access PPP loans, which is really im-
portant right now. We also want to get 
the grant program out immediately— 
get that money out—and distribute 
over $16 billion in grants. Our venues 
can’t wait. They need that relief. Ms. 
Guzman will be key to leading our way 
out of this and helping Senator SCHU-
MER with his theaters in New York to 
the Fargo Theatre in North Dakota. 
We need to get this done. 
We just passed restaurant relief as 
part of the American Rescue Plan—a 
major, major bill—with the $28.6 billion 
Restaurant Revitalization Fund, which 
is going to be so key. I was at The 
Block Food & Drink restaurant in 
Saint Louis Park on Sunday and then 
headed up to Duluth, to the Boat Club, 
with the mayor and the owners of the 
Boat Club. There were stories I heard 
of servers who had been laid off, then 
came back, laid off, then came back, 
and there were stories I heard about 
the owners of some of these res-
taurants in their taking out repeated 
loans. They are hanging in there, and 
we need to have their backs. 
One out of six restaurants in this 
country has permanently closed down 
during the pandemic. As the leader of 
the antitrust subcommittee in the Sen-
ate, we don’t want to just give all of 
our food service and action in the res-
taurant area to the big guys. We are 
pleased we have successful restaurant 
chains in this country, but that can’t 
be the only thing we have. That is why 
helping these smaller venues is so im-
portant. 
Ms. Guzman gets that. She is a life-
long proponent of small businesses and 
is the daughter of a small business 
owner. As a former entrepreneur, this 
makes her the right person for this job 
at a pivotal time in the life of our 
country. She has the backing of the 
U.S. Chamber of Commerce and numer-
ous trade organizations. I know her 
leadership at the SBA will put our 
struggling businesses in the best hands. 
I ask my colleagues to support the 
nomination of Isabella Guzman to be 
Administrator of the Small Business 
Administration. The Presiding Officer 
must be proud to have someone who 
has done such good work in California 
in this job. We are excited about her 
and what she can do. 
NOMINATION OF XAVIER BECERRA 
Mr. President, today, I rise to speak 
in support of Xavier Becerra’s nomina-
tion to serve as Secretary of Health 
and Human Services (HHS). 
Attorney General Becerra will bring 
a fresh perspective to HHS at a critical 
time during this pandemic. While there 
is light at the end of the tunnel with 
the distribution of the coronavirus vac-
cines, there is still work to do to end 
this pandemic and put our country on a 
road to recovery, and that is where At-
torney General Becerra’s leadership 
will be crucial.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1538 
March 16, 2021 
Attorney General Becerra’s 12 terms 
in the U.S. House of Representatives 
gave him a solid foundation in knowing 
how to set agendas and achieve results, 
which we saw deployed in his work as a 
key leader on the Committee on Ways 
and Means, ranking member of the 
Subcommittee on Social Security, and 
chair of the House Democratic Caucus. 
He helped to expand the Children’s 
Health Insurance Program, modernize 
and strengthen Medicare, and helped 
pass the Affordable Care Act. His com-
mitment to the letter and spirit of this 
law is something he carried into his 
role as California Attorney General, 
fighting to maintain his State’s ability 
to bring millions of previously unin-
sured residents under the ACA’s um-
brella. 
Last November, he led the defense of 
the Affordable Care Act in the U.S. Su-
preme Court on behalf of 20 States and 
the District of Columbia. His tweet 
after the oral arguments concisely 
sums up the national importance of his 
effort: ‘‘The ACA saves lives. It is the 
law of the land.’’ He brings a strong 
commitment to using the law and regu-
latory tools to make access to health 
care and other vital services equi-
table—the very thing that makes our 
nation strong. 
I look forward to working with him 
on ensuring that everyone has access 
to quality and affordable healthcare, 
and I know he will be a partner in the 
fight against the coronavirus and our 
goal of getting all eligible Americans 
vaccinated, 
even 
in 
hard-to-reach 
areas. 
Last week, President Biden signed 
into law the American Rescue Plan 
Act, which included major funding to 
address the Nation’s worsening mental 
health and addiction crisis. This is a 
high priority of mine and an issue with 
which Attorney General Becerra has 
firsthand experience. He started his ca-
reer as a legal aid attorney in Massa-
chusetts, supporting clients contending 
with mental health issues. I am eager 
to work with him on this issue. 
Addressing the skyrocketing costs of 
prescription drugs is another area 
where Attorney General Becerra has 
shown key leadership. He and I share a 
belief that fairer competition means 
increased access to affordable prescrip-
tion drugs and better public health. As 
California Attorney General, he inves-
tigated and brought enforcement ac-
tions against drug manufacturers’ anti-
competitive business practices to help 
reduce drug prices and ensure that peo-
ple have access to the drugs they need. 
In March 2020, he led a bipartisan group 
of 46 State attorneys general who suc-
cessfully advocated before the U.S. Su-
preme Court to uphold the rights of 
States to regulate and address the ris-
ing cost of prescription drugs. 
The United States must do more to 
ensure that new technologies have ap-
propriate privacy and security protec-
tions for health data. At a September 
2020 hearing on the need for Federal 
data privacy legislation, Attorney Gen-
eral Becerra told me and other mem-
bers of the Senate Committee on Com-
merce, Science, and Transportation 
that ‘‘every consumer should be able to 
own and control his or her data’’ and 
that ‘‘if we decide that we don’t want 
anyone to use [our data], it’s our 
choosing.’’ His testimony was reas-
suring, and I look forward to working 
with him to ensure consumers can have 
peace of mind when it comes to the se-
curity of their personal health data. 
Given the pandemic’ s spotlight on 
the vulnerability of our Nation’s sen-
iors, I am eager to work with the Biden 
administration to improve the safety 
and well-being of older Americans. 
When my 92-year-old dad, living in a 
memory care facility, was diagnosed 
with COVID–19 last year, I was only 
able to visit him through a window. He 
recognized me, but he just didn’t un-
derstand why we couldn’t be in the 
same room together. Tens of thousands 
of families have been through these 
wrenching situations over the past 
year and want to see the Federal Gov-
ernment doing more. Attorney General 
Becerra recently moved to make the 
California Department of Justice Med-
icaid Fraud Control Unit a full-fledged 
division, underscoring his commitment 
to protecting seniors and people with 
disabilities. I know his leadership will 
place the needs of seniors front and 
center. 
Attorney General Becerra has the ex-
pertise and experience and the enforce-
ment and regulatory savvy to handle 
the job of protecting public health, 
strengthening our hospitals and health 
care system, making sure people have 
access to quality, affordable health 
care, and supporting our health care 
workers. And as the first Latino to 
lead the Department of Health and 
Human Services, he will bring a per-
sonal understanding of the immediate 
need for equitable access to care. 
With that, I ask my colleagues to 
support 
the 
nomination: 
Xavier 
Becerra as Secretary of Health and 
Human Services. Thank you. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

NOMINATION OF ISABELLA CASILLAS GUZMAN 
Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I rise to 
voice my strong support for Isabella 
Guzman’s nomination to serve as Ad-
ministrator of the Small Business Ad-
ministration. 
Our Nation passed the 1-year mark of 
COVID–19’s being declared a national 
emergency last Saturday, March 13, 
and, thankfully, the American people 
can now see the light at the end of the 
tunnel. Already, more than 20 percent 
of all Americans have received at least 
one COVID–19 vaccine dose, with an av-
erage of more than 2.39 million addi-
tional doses being administered each 
day. We can see the light at the end of 
the tunnel, but we are not there yet. 
The COVID–19 pandemic has deci-
mated American small businesses, and 
the worst effects have been felt by the 
most vulnerable small businesses, espe-
cially those in Black, Latino, Native, 
and rural communities, so the SBA 
must continue to be a lifeline in the 
coming months. That is why it is im-
portant that we confirm Ms. Guzman’s 
nomination, so she can provide the per-
manent, steady leadership the SBA 
needs right now. 
When we passed the CARES Act, Con-
gress tasked the SBA with one of the 
most important aspects of our COVID– 
19 relief effort. We knew we had to sup-
port our small businesses because the 
public health restrictions on public 
gatherings, which have saved thou-
sands of lives and kept our commu-
nities safe, have been especially chal-
lenging for small businesses. We had to 
help small businesses so that, when we 
get out of this pandemic, when our 
economy returns, our small businesses 
will emerge in a position to help our 
economy recover and continue to grow. 
The CARES Act included $377 billion 
in funds for small businesses and cre-
ated the Paycheck Protection Pro-
gram, the EIDL advance program, and 
the small business debt relief program 
to help small businesses that had tradi-
tional SBA loans, like the 7(a) and 504. 
In April, we passed legislation to re-
plenish the PPP, EIDL, and the EIDL 
advance grant program with $370 bil-
lion in additional funds. Then, in De-
cember, we passed the bipartisan Eco-
nomic Aid Act to provide another $325 
billion to support small businesses, 
allow for second round PPP loans, and 
create the Shuttered Venue Operators 
Grant Program. In total last year, Con-
gress appropriated more than $1 tril-
lion to the SBA for COVID–19 relief 
programs. 
Since the passage of the CARES Act, 
the SBA has approved more than 7.5 
million PPP loans worth more than 
$687 billion and more than 3.7 million 
EIDL loans worth more than $200 bil-
lion. These loans and grants have saved 
millions of jobs and prevented millions 
of small businesses from closing their 
doors. 
I want to thank the SBA personnel 
who have worked long hours, including 
nights and weekends, to implement 
these critical programs. 
SBA still has a lot of work left to do. 
As I mentioned, the December bill cre-
ated the Shuttered Venue Operators 
Grant Program, which we expect the 
SBA to open in the coming weeks. 
SBA also has to open a new $28.6 bil-
lion grant program for restaurants and 
bars, which was created by the historic 
American Rescue Plan.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1539 
March 16, 2021 
The plan appropriated an additional 
$50 billion in economic relief for small 
businesses, including $15 billion to tar-
geted EIDL advance grants, an addi-
tional $7.25 billion to PPP, and $1.25 
billion for shuttered venue grants. 
The plan also required SBA to launch 
a Community Navigator Pilot Pro-
gram, which is designed to help small 
businesses in underserved and under-
banked 
communities 
access 
the 
COVID–19 relief resources available to 
them. These programs will be key to 
our economic recovery. 
That brings me to Mrs. Guzman’s 
nomination. Mrs. Guzman has decades 
of 
experience 
working 
with, 
sup-
porting, and founding small businesses, 
which have prepared her to lead the 
SBA during this moment. 
Most recently, Mrs. Guzman was the 
State of California’s director of the Of-
fice of Small Business Advocate, where 
she oversaw implementation of the 
State’s COVID–19 Relief Grant Pro-
gram. 
Mrs. Guzman also helped lead SBA 
during 
the 
Obama 
administration, 
serving as the Deputy Chief of Staff 
and Senior Advisor for 3 years, from 
2014 through 2017. 
During her nomination hearing last 
month, Mrs. Guzman demonstrated her 
commitment to ensuring that SBA’s 
relief programs, as well as its tradi-
tional loan programs, are implemented 
equitably and that they help small 
businesses in Black, Latino, Native, 
rural, and other underserved commu-
nities overcome the historic barriers 
they face. 
She is committed to ensuring the 
Agency has the right systems, tech-
nology, and operating procedures in 
place to advance the mission and reach 
all of our small businesses. 
And she is committed to ‘‘ensure 
funds get into the hands of small busi-
nesses who have been hurt the most by 
the pandemic and the economic crisis 
through no fault of their own.’’ 
As we learned during the pandemic, 
SBA has a key role to play in our Na-
tion’s effort to fight systems of in-
equality that prevent many entre-
preneurs in underserved and under-
banked communities from starting and 
growing successful businesses. 
Mrs. Guzman will be an advocate for 
small businesses in these communities 
within the administration, and she will 
be a strong partner to us in Congress as 
we build better capacity to support 
small businesses through the coming 
economic recovery. 
Mrs. Guzman’s commitment to eq-
uity and her deep knowledge of the 
needs of small businesses and the best 
policies to help them are why she re-
ceived bipartisan praise during her 
nomination hearing and was advanced 
by the committee by a bipartisan vote. 
Mrs. Guzman has earned broad sup-
port from the small business commu-
nity. Her nomination has been en-
dorsed by the U.S. Chamber of Com-
merce, U.S. Hispanic Chamber, the U.S. 
Black Chamber, the National Small 
Business Association, the Small Busi-
ness Majority, the National Federation 
of Independent Businesses, and many 
other small business advocacy groups. 
SBA needs an Administrator who can 
hit the ground running, and I am con-
fident Mrs. Guzman is exactly the right 
person for the job. 
I urge my colleagues who have spo-
ken with small business owners who 
still need support from the SBA—and I 
am sure everyone has—to join me and 
vote to confirm Mrs. Guzman as the 
SBA Administrator. 
I yield the floor.

NOMINATION OF ISABELLA CASILLAS GUZMAN 
Ms. ROSEN. Madam President, I 
stand here today in support of Isabel 
Guzman’s nomination to serve as SBA 
Administrator. 
This pandemic has been challenging 
for our communities, and it has been 
especially devastating for our small 
businesses. We urgently need a leader 
who is experienced and prepared for the 
work ahead, someone who will hit the 
ground running to revive and restore 
our small businesses and bring back 
jobs, and Isabel Guzman is exactly the 
right person for this task. 
Having previously served in the U.S. 
Small Business Administration, Mrs. 
Guzman knows the Agency well. She 
understands the struggles that small 
businesses and workers face, not just 
during this pandemic but also their 
day-to-day needs. She will use the 
Agency’s tools to support small busi-
nesses, and she will fight fiercely on 
their behalf. 
Ninety-nine percent of Nevada busi-
nesses are small businesses. This is a 
diverse community that embodies the 
entrepreneurial spirit of our State, and 
over the last year they have faced ob-
stacle after obstacle. Thousands of Ne-
vada business owners have called my 
office for help. 
These small business owners are— 
well, they are people. They are people 
who have poured their hard-earned 
money into starting businesses. They

March 16, 2021 
are people who have dedicated their 
lives to building a business from the 
ground up. They are people whose 
shops and stores and services—well, 
they are cornerstones for our commu-
nities. And now, through no fault of 
their own, these small business owners 
are left wondering if their businesses 
are going to make it. 
Last week, President Biden signed 
the American Rescue Plan into law. 
This is a major win for small busi-
nesses across the country. It includes 
targeted support for Black, Latino, 
AAPI, and minority-owned businesses, 
as well as support for businesses in our 
rural communities. Over $1 billion in 
grants are in there to save our stages 
and independent live venues. There is 
over $7 billion for the Paycheck Pro-
tection Program. There is $15 billion 
for EIDL Advance grants and $25 bil-
lion to keep restaurants afloat. 
This will provide real relief to small 
business owners, employees, and the 
families that they provide for, that 
count on them. For so many, this addi-
tional aid will mean the difference be-
tween a business keeping its doors open 
or closing them forever. 
And now we need an SBA Adminis-
trator who will see that this relief is 
delivered swiftly and fully. I am con-
fident that Isabel Guzman will be an 
asset in bringing our small businesses 
back. 
We must also do more for our small 
businesses, which is why, if confirmed, 
I look forward to working with Mrs. 
Guzman and the SBA to remove the 
cap on EIDL loans and to provide full 
EIDL Advance grants to all eligible 
small businesses, giving greater access 
to the relief that all our small business 
owners need. The EIDL and EIDL Ad-
vance Programs have helped countless 
small businesses in Nevada and in 
States across the country through 
these tough times, but the arbitrary 
caps on these loans and grants are pre-
venting small businesses from receiv-
ing the funding assistance they need to 
properly recover. 
Full EIDL loans and grants are what 
Congress intended when we passed the 
CARES Act 1 year ago. It is what we 
promised small businesses at the begin-
ning of the pandemic. So we owe it to 
America’s small businesses and work-
ers to keep our word, and I know Isabel 
Guzman is the right person to help us 
keep this promise. 
As we continue on the road to recov-
ery, made possible by the American 
Rescue Plan, I urge my colleagues to 
confirm Mrs. Guzman’s nomination so 
that she can immediately get to work 
for our small businesses. 
Thank you. 
I yield to the Senator from Oregon. 
Mr. WYDEN. Madam President, I cer-
tainly share the good Senator’s views 
with respect to Mrs. Guzman as well. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Oregon. 
NOMINATION OF KATHERINE C. TAI 
Mr. WYDEN. Madam President, the 
Senate will soon take a procedural vote 
on the nomination of Katherine C. Tai 
to serve as the next U.S. Trade Rep-
resentative. 
For Senators who watched any of Ms. 
Tai’s nomination hearing before the 
committee, you will know that Ms. Tai 
has a whole lot of fans on both sides of 
the aisle here in the Senate. So I am 
just going to take a few minutes to dis-
cuss some of the reasons why I think 
Ms. Tai is a terrific choice for this job. 
First, she knows that the name of the 
game when it comes to this country’s 
trade policy is protecting and creating 
high-skill, high-wage jobs. Our country 
saw, for the past 4 years, that a strat-
egy of sending mean tweets and acting 
on chaos does not translate into more 
good jobs. Under President Biden, and 
with Katherine Tai leading USTR, I am 
confident we will have a more effective 
approach. 
Ms. Tai also has exactly the right ex-
perience for the job. She led crack-
downs against China’s trade cheating 
and job rip-offs. As the top trade staff-
er on the Ways and Means Committee, 
she was at the forefront to improve the 
new NAFTA when the Trump adminis-
tration handed to Congress a deal that 
just wasn’t strong enough for Amer-
ican workers. She already has a long 
track record of achieving wins for 
America’s workers, businesses, farm-
ers, and ranchers. 
Second, Ms. Tai has committed to 
the Finance Committee that she will 
work to bring more transparency to 
trade policy. Bringing more sunlight to 
the country’s trade agreements ought 
to be a priority that every Senator 
shares. That is why I am glad that 
President Biden has chosen somebody 
with congressional experience for the 
role of USTR. 
The Constitution gives the Congress 
authority over international trade. Un-
fortunately, Congress, over the years, 
has delegated some of its power to the 
executive branch. So what that means 
is, now, all sides need to work together 
as partners, with open channels of com-
munication, accountability, and trans-
parency. And when I talk about trans-
parency, I am talking about trans-
parency with the American people. I 
know that Ms. Tai will continue to 
raise the bar for transparency and com-
munication with Congress because she 
has been on our side of policymaking, 
and she has already proved that that 
kind of openness and accountability is 
a key priority for her. 
With a former Senator in the White 
House and a former House staffer at 
USTR, I believe there would be a pro-
ductive partnership with Congress so 
we can get trade done right and make 
sure that trade policy creates those 
high-skill, high-wage jobs that are a 
priority for every elected official. 
Finally, there is another Finance 
Committee priority that I will just 
mention. On Thursday, the committee 
will hold a hearing on the subject of 
stamping out forced labor around the 
world. Forced labor is evil, it is mor-
ally repugnant, and it is a direct at-
tack on workers in our country be-
cause, when American workers have to 
compete against slave labor, everybody 
loses. It is truly a race to absolute rock 
bottom when it comes to labor rights. 
Ms. Tai is committed to President 
Biden’s Build Back Better agenda. A 
key part of that agenda is ensuring 
that our workers are competing on a 
level playing field with the rest of the 
world. It is certainly not a level play-
ing field when other countries are pro-
ducing goods with slave labor. 
Our government has laws on the 
books that can crack down on coun-
tries using slave labor and keep those 
products out of our market, but it is 
going to require an unwavering com-
mitment to tough trade enforcement. 
This will continue to be an area of spe-
cial focus for the Finance Committee. 
Our colleague Senator BROWN and I 
have worked on this issue for a long, 
long time. I know Ms. Tai is committed 
to working with us on it, and I know 
that she will work with colleagues on 
the other side of the aisle on this and 
other issues. It is an opportunity to 
stand up for what is right around the 
world and protect American jobs and 
wages at the same time. 
So Katherine Tai is qualified. She 
has the right diversity of experience. 
She has her priorities right, which is to 
get more American workers into the 
winner’s circle of trade policy, and she 
is going to do it in a way that pro-
motes openness, accountability, and 
transparency. 
I believe Ms. Tai is going to have 
strong bipartisan support here in the 
Senate when we vote in just a few min-
utes. I want Senators on both sides of 
the aisle to know that Ms. Tai has con-
sistently, throughout her time in pub-
lic service, worked in a bipartisan way 
with respect to ensuring that, at a 
time when modern communications 
and transportation have, to some ex-
tent, shrunk the world and trade has 
gotten to be more and more important, 
she is going to be on the side of work-
ers. She is going to be on the side of 
trade done right. I am with her 100 per-
cent of the way. 
I urge all Senators to support Kath-
erine Tai for this crucial post at USTR. 
I yield the floor.

NOMINATION OF KATHERINE C. TAI 
Mr. CARPER. Madam President, I am 
delighted to rise today in full support 
of Katherine Tai, President Biden’s 
nominee to be our next U.S. Trade Rep-
resentative. 
As my colleagues are well aware, 
trade is an issue that impacts every 
corner of our country and, indeed, 
every corner of our globe. Roughly 75 
percent—listen to this—75 percent of 
the world’s purchasing power and over 
95 percent of the world’s consumers lie 
outside of our country’s borders. If the 
United States is going to continue to 
be successful, we need to be able to tap 
into those markets and expand trading 
opportunities while ensuring a level 
playing field for American businesses 
and, I might say, for American con-
sumers as well. 
In Delaware, the First State, and 
throughout our Nation, trade policies 
affect how American businesses, both 
large and small—be they financial 
services, 
tech 
companies, 
workers, 
farmers, manufacturers—can compete 
in the global economy. But thanks to 
President Trump’s haphazard trade 
wars over the last 4 years, American 
farmers, manufacturers, producers, and 
consumers too often have been left 
hanging in the balance—a situation 
that has been exasperated by this pan-
demic. 
Now more than ever, all of them are 
in need of greater certainty and pre-
dictability. For the last 30, 40 years 
that I have served as Delaware’s Treas-
urer, Congressman, Governor, and Sen-
ator, when I ask businesses what they 
want or need, more often than not, 
they 
say 
‘‘certainty 
and 
predict-
ability.’’ For the last 4 years, we have 
had too little of both. 
Instead of the chaotic approach of 
the last 4 years, we need strategic and 
thoughtful trade policies. That is why 
President Biden has nominated Kath-
erine Tai, an experienced public serv-
ant and trade expert, to serve as our 
Nation’s top trade official. Katherine 
will be a steady hand at the U.S. Trade 
Rep’s Office, and as a key member of 
the Biden administration, she will 
make sure that our trade policies ben-
efit all Americans and leave no one be-
hind. She will work hard to help jump- 
start our economy and ensure that 
American goods and services can reach 
international markets and that we can 
compete on a level playing field. 
Katherine comes to this role with an 
exceptional breadth and depth of rel-
evant trade expertise. She has earned a 
remarkable reputation as an expert in 
her field and is a leader who is re-
spected by Democrats and Republicans 
alike in this Chamber and in the House 
of Representatives. 
In her previous role, Katherine was 
chief trade counsel for the House Ways 
and Means Committee. There, she was 
a lead negotiator on the USMCA, U.S.- 
Mexico-Canada-America Trade Agree-
ment, which notably passed Congress 
with overwhelming bipartisan support, 
in no smart part because of her efforts. 
Members of my own staff are grateful 
for the opportunity to work with Kath-
erine to secure historically strong en-
vironmental provisions, including new 
monitoring and enforcement tools in 
the USMCA, which will help make sure

that alleged environmental violations 
will be investigated and remedied in a 
timely manner. These new tools and re-
sources will help ensure that environ-
mental protections are not just words 
on a piece of paper but policies that 
will actually be put into practice and 
consistently maintained well into the 
future. 
As chairman of both the Environ-
ment and Public Works Committee and 
the Finance Subcommittee on Inter-
national Trade, I look forward to work-
ing with my colleagues and with Kath-
erine Tai and her team to build on the 
progress that was made in the USMCA. 
Another immense trade challenge 
that we face now is to effectively 
counter China’s unfair trade practices 
and its expanding influence in inter-
national trade. Since joining the World 
Trade Organization, the WTO, in 2001, 
China has proven to be a bad actor 
time and again. I believe that, working 
with our allies in the Pacific Rim in a 
spirit similar to the Trans-Pacific 
Partnership, we can more effectively 
ensure that China adheres to its trade 
commitments with us and with the rest 
of the world. 
Katherine has the expertise to help 
make that happen. Her prior experi-
ence as U.S. Trade Rep’s Chief Counsel 
for China Trade Enforcement, where 
she led efforts to hold China account-
able at the WTO for its unfair trade 
practices, is going to prove to be a tre-
mendous asset for our Nation. 
We would be lucky to have Katherine 
Tai, a committed public servant, rep-
resent our Nation on the world stage. 
As a daughter of immigrants and the 
first woman of color to be nominated 
to serve as U.S. Trade Rep, Katherine 
often cites her parents, also both pub-
lic servants, as her inspiration. 
In her testimony to the Finance 
Committee that I serve on, Katherine 
said—I want to quote her. Here is what 
she said. Speaking of her parents, she 
said: 
I am proud of their service to the nation 
that welcomed them. And I am proud to live 
in a country where, in just one generation, 
their daughter could grow up to represent 
the United States and our interests around 
the globe. 
Those are her words. 
I, too, am proud to serve in a country 
where this is possible. 
Simply put, Katherine has decades of 
experience in trade, years of experience 
working in trade in a bipartisan fash-
ion, and a keen understanding of the 
role Congress can play alongside the 
administration to implement success-
ful trade policies. 
As the world grapples with the great-
est economic downturn since the Great 
Depression, it is more important now 
than ever to have a leader at the U.S. 
Trade Rep’s Office who will work with 
Congress to advance a trade agenda 
that uplifts American workers in every 
corner of our country, spurs domestic 
manufacturing, and improves environ-
mental and labor standards throughout 
the world. 
Given Katherine’s track record and 
many years of experience working 
across the aisle in Congress, I am con-
fident that she has the broad support 
necessary to be a highly skilled and ef-
fective U.S. Trade Representative as 
she takes on the many trade challenges 
that we face, and I invite my col-
leagues to join me in voting to confirm 
Katherine Tai to serve as our next 
Trade Representative. 
If I could, do I have a few more min-
utes to speak? 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. You do. 
Mr. CARPER. Madam President, my 
legislative director is a woman named 
Xiao. Lucy is her first name, Lucy 
Xiao. She said to me several months 
ago, after the election—Joe Biden was 
elected—she said: You know, we were 
working on the USMCA last year. We 
worked with a woman who was a very 
senior member of the House Ways and 
Means Committee staff to help make 
sure the environmental provisions in 
the law are not only strong but en-
forceable. 
She said: The woman we worked with 
is a top staff person on the House Ways 
and Means Committee. Her name is 
Katherine Tai. 
Lucy said to me: I think that Kath-
erine Tai might make a good U.S. 
Trade Rep and may make a very inter-
esting human story as well. 
I have huge respect for Lucy’s judg-
ment, and I turned around and I called 
on the phone the chairman of the Ways 
and Means Committee, an old col-
league from my days in the House, 
RICHARD NEAL. 
I said: RICHARD, does the name 
‘‘Katherine Tai’’ mean anything to 
you? 
He said: Oh, yes. She is a great mem-
ber of my staff. 
I said: She has been suggested as 
someone who might serve as the U.S. 
Trade Rep. What do you think? 
He said: She would be excellent. She 
would be excellent. 
The next call I made was to Ted 
Kaufman, former U.S. Senator, former 
chief of staff to Joe Biden for many 
years, and the interim Senator in this 
body for 2 years after Joe was elected 
Vice President. I called former Senator 
Kaufman, who was in charge of the 
transition for the Biden team, and I 
said: Ted, I think I have a good name 
for Trade Rep. 
I explained who Katherine Tai was 
and her history and her work experi-
ence and what Chairman RICHARD NEAL 
said about her. 
I said: She might be a keeper. 
A week later, he called me and he 
said: We are getting all kinds of great 
comments about Katherine Tai. 
He said: You know, I think you don’t 
always have the best judgment, TOM 
CARPER, but I think in this case, maybe 
you are like a blind squirrel that occa-
sionally finds a nugget. 
And I think maybe in this case, I 
have, with the strong support and help 
of Lucy. 
So that is the story. That is my 
Katherine Tai story. She is a keeper, 
and we are lucky to have her. She will 
succeed if confirmed. She will succeed 
Robert 
Lighthizer 
and 
Michael 
Froman, our immediate past two Trade 
Reps. Those are big shoes to fill, but 
she is very well prepared to fill them. 
With that, I suggest the absence of a 
quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The bill clerk proceeded to call the 
roll. 
Mr. COTTON. Madam President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
NOMINATION OF XAVIER BECERRA 
Mr. COTTON. Madam President, the 
Senate is considering the nomination 
of California Attorney General Xavier 
Becerra to be Secretary of the Depart-
ment of Health and Human Services. 
Without question, the Senate should 
reject this nomination. 
In the midst of this pandemic, Amer-
ica deserves a Health Secretary who is 
solely—solely focused on getting shots 
in arms, getting kids back to school, 
and getting parents back to work. But 
that is not Mr. Becerra. 
Over his long career in politics, his 
primary passion has been ramming 
through a radical, far-left agenda and 
using the power of his office to per-
secute his political enemies. 
Mr. Becerra would be in charge of ad-
ministering the Nation’s health pro-
grams, but he has virtually no experi-
ence or expertise in healthcare. His 
only experience responding to the pan-
demic, as far as I can tell, has been his 
enforcement of California’s excessive 
and traumatizing lockdowns over the 
last year. 
Mr. Becerra has been California’s top 
cop, overseeing the most draconian and 
unconstitutional series of lockdowns 
anywhere in our country. He has shut-
tered churches while liquor stores and 
marijuana dispensaries remain open. 
He has destroyed small, family-owned 
businesses while enriching massive cor-
porations. 
In the false name of public health, he 
has rigorously enforced unscientific 
and unproductive measures that have 
ruined the lives of Californians. Today, 
California’s unemployment rate stands 
at 9 percent—45 percent higher than 
the national average, nearly two times 
higher than our unemployment rate in 
Arkansas. That is the result of bad pol-
icy. And jobless Californians have Xa-
vier Becerra and Gavin Newsom to 
thank for their struggles. 
If Mr. Becerra’s record as attorney 
general is any indication, every Amer-
ican should be alarmed by how this 
nominee would fight the pandemic— 
not with science, compassion, or com-
mon sense but with crushing political 
force. Few Americans believe that Cali-
fornia’s lockdown commissar deserves 
a promotion. Unfortunately, the Sen-
ate may just give him one. 
Mr. Becerra is also a vocal advocate 
for the socialist takeover of healthcare

S1543 
March 16, 2021 
known euphemistically as Medicare for 
All. He supports destroying union 
healthcare plans, crushing Medicare 
Advantage, 
and 
ultimately 
taking 
away your health insurance on the job, 
which covers, I would add, 158 million 
Americans. This disastrous boondoggle 
would cost $34 trillion and would inevi-
tably result in the rationing of care, 
hurting senior citizens most of all. 
Medicare for All would, in reality, re-
sult in Medicare for None. 
Last year, President Biden acknowl-
edged that Medicare for All would yield 
massive tax hikes for middle-class fam-
ilies. Yet Joe Biden selected a sup-
porter of this disastrous Medicare for 
All plan to be his top Cabinet official 
on healthcare. 
And, of course, Mr. Becerra wouldn’t 
be a Biden administration nominee if 
he didn’t also support open borders. 
But he has gone further on open bor-
ders than even most of the other Biden 
administration officials, saying out 
loud what so many Democrats silently 
believe. He has openly argued for the 
decriminalization of illegal immigra-
tion. He has even stated with a straight 
face that illegal immigration does ab-
solutely no harm at all, directly or in-
directly, to American citizens. If Mr. 
Becerra really believes that, he is 
hopelessly naive and needs to get out a 
little more. 
He can start by talking to the mil-
lions of Americans who are out of work 
or whose wages have stagnated thanks 
to competition from illegal aliens. He 
could also visit the graves of thousands 
of Americans killed by Mexican drugs 
and terrorized by gangs like MS–13. If 
confirmed, Mr. Becerra would oversee 
our Nation’s response to the drug crisis 
and the maintenance of many migrant 
detention facilities. His radical open 
borders advocacy would make matters 
worse on both fronts. It would also fuel 
the ever-growing surge of unvetted, un-
tested, and unvaccinated illegal aliens 
into 
our 
Nation, 
spreading 
the 
coronavirus in our communities just as 
it looks like we are about to turn the 
corner on this pandemic. 
Finally, Mr. Becerra holds opinions 
on abortion that are unacceptable, un-
just, and far outside the mainstream. 
As a Member of Congress, he voted in 
favor of partial-birth abortion—a dis-
turbing and deadly procedure per-
formed in the very last stages of preg-
nancy. As California’s attorney gen-
eral, he tried to destroy anyone who 
opposed his extreme position on this 
issue. He brought 15 felony charges 
against pro-life, undercover journalists 
who exposed Planned Parenthood’s ille-
gal and disgusting sale of baby body 
parts—a move that even the liberal Los 
Angeles Times called ‘‘disturbingly ag-
gressive.’’ He defended an unconstitu-
tional law that would have forced pro- 
life crisis pregnancy centers to adver-
tise for abortions, the very thing it is 
their mission to oppose—something 
that the U.S. Supreme Court called a 
‘‘serious threat’’ to freedom of speech. 
He even sued to force an order of 
nuns, the Little Sisters of the Poor, to 
purchase healthcare coverage that vio-
lated their sincerely held religious be-
liefs. And when he was asked about all 
of this in the Senate, like any bully, he 
tried to cover it up, denying that he 
sued the Little Sisters at all. If he will 
sue the Little Sisters, then what will 
he do to you and your family? 
A few of my colleagues have indi-
cated that they will vote for Mr. 
Becerra, despite disagreeing with these 
radical views. Perhaps they think 
those are just his personal beliefs, that 
he won’t practice what he preaches. 
Perhaps they think he won’t under-
mine pro-life protections like the Hyde 
Amendment and use his office to per-
secute Catholic nuns. I would ask those 
colleagues to look at Mr. Becerra’s 
record, not the words he utters to get 
their vote, and then to reconsider their 
support because any honest assessment 
will show that Xavier Becerra is a par-
tisan cultural warrior who has consist-
ently abused his office to punish his en-
emies and to enact far-left policies in 
Congress and in California. 
If the Senate confirms his nomina-
tion, they will be empowering Mr. 
Becerra 
to 
bring 
California’s 
lockdowns, lawsuits, and liberal poli-
cies to all of our 50 States, and that 
would be a disaster for our country. 
I will close with a simple request for 
President Biden, who campaigned on 
unity and ending a terrible pandemic: 
Merely do what you said you would do. 
Send us a nominee who will unify the 
country and bring consensus, not one 
who will scrape by on the slimmest of 
majorities. Send us a nominee who is 
actually a healthcare expert, and the 
Senate will gladly consider them. Xa-
vier Becerra is not that nominee, and 
the Senate should reject his nomina-
tion resoundingly. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The bill clerk proceeded to call the 
roll. 
Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. MUR-
PHY). Without objection, it is so or-
dered. 
ELECTION SECURITY 
Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, about 1 
year ago today, Congress was in the 
midst of a debate about the most effec-
tive way to respond to COVID–19. On a 
call with his colleagues, the House ma-
jority whip, Mr. CLYBURN, reportedly 
laid out his vision about how his cau-
cus in the House should proceed. He 
said, it is reported: This is a tremen-
dous opportunity to restructure things 
to fit our vision. 
For American families, this pan-
demic has been an unmistakable trag-
edy, one characterized by lost lives and 
lost livelihoods, but, apparently, for 
some, it is viewed as a tremendous op-
portunity. 
The partisan $1.9 trillion bill that 
was signed into law last week is proof 
that, apparently, the Democrats in 
Congress and in the White House agree. 
After all, this legislation includes a 
long list of non-COVID-related prior-
ities, again, completely unrelated to 
the crisis at hand: blank checks for 
mismanaged union pension funds, fund-
ing 
for 
climate 
justice, 
backdoor 
money for Planned Parenthood, an ex-
clusive paid leave program for govern-
ment bureaucrats, and the list goes on 
and on. 
Before the bill was even signed into 
law, folks from the other side of the 
aisle started advocating making many 
of the provisions permanent. This is an 
emergency measure, supposedly, but 
folks advocated making those tem-
porary provisions permanent, further 
proof that this is more than just a pan-
demic relief response; this is about, in 
the words of Mr. CLYBURN, restruc-
turing government as we know it. 
But it doesn’t stop there. Now our 
Democratic colleagues in the House 
and some in the Senate apparently 
want to hijack the State and Federal 
election system, starting with making 
temporary pandemic election responses 
permanent. Of course, our elections are 
run at the State and local level. As a 
matter of fact, I recall, given the ef-
forts of the Russian intelligence serv-
ices to interfere with our election in 
2016, one of the strengths of our system 
was its dispersed nature, suggesting, in 
other words, that if it had been a single 
system, it would have been much easier 
for our adversaries to interfere—and 
particularly in the cyber realm. 
But we know, as a result of the pan-
demic, 
States 
made 
provisional 
changes to their 2020 election processes 
to make sure that people could safely 
exercise their right to vote. In my 
State, we extended early voting. We al-
lowed voters to submit mail-in ballots 
in designated drop boxes. 
Several States, of course, expanded 
eligibility for mail-in voting. Some, 
like California, took things even fur-
ther and sent mail-in ballots to every 
registered voter. At the time, these 
changes were billed as temporary, 
given the unique and extraordinary na-
ture of the challenges presented by the 
pandemic, but as the House minority 
whip has said, this pandemic, appar-
ently, is viewed as a tremendous oppor-
tunity to restructure the way we run 
and conduct elections. 
House Democrats have passed legisla-
tion to make many of the temporary 
changes in the 2020 elections perma-
nent and add a list of other so-called 
reforms in order to federalize our 
State- and local-run elections. This is 
in the face of article I of the Constitu-
tion that explicitly gives the States 
the power to regulate the times, places, 
and manner of holding elections. 
Yet this 791-page document creates a 
one-size-fits-all mandate for all States. 
It actually preempts State law, start-
ing with mail-in balloting. Any person 
in any State could request a mail-in 
ballot for any reason. There is no need 
to say why you can’t vote in person,

March 16, 2021 
which is the current policy in most 
States. 
Those ballots would not, under this 
bill, even have to be mailed in by the 
voter or dropped in a State-sanctioned 
ballot box because this legislation le-
galizes ballot harvesting, which means 
that mail-in ballots could be collected 
by paid activists or campaign staffers 
or anyone who has a stake in the out-
come of the election. 
It goes so far as to specify that 
States may not put any limit on how 
many voted and sealed absentee ballots 
any designated person can return. It 
really sounds like an invitation to 
fraud, and you can see how this could 
go badly pretty quickly. Maybe the 
ballot gets turned in with thousands of 
others. Maybe it is altered. Maybe it 
ends up in the trash. It is hard to say. 
That gets to one of the root problems 
with this legislation is it does create 
limitless opportunities for fraud. Every 
single ballot cast illegally or due to 
fraud undercuts and neutralizes every 
legally cast ballot. 
One way this bill removes some of 
the most basic requirements of most 
States’ 
ballot 
integrity 
safeguards 
against election fraud is by removing 
any requirement of identification. This 
was, we should recall, one of the main 
recommendations of the bipartisan 2005 
Commission on Federal Election Re-
form, cochaired by former President 
Jimmy Carter and former Secretary of 
State James Baker III. The Commis-
sion recommended that voters should 
be required to present photo ID cards 
and that States should provide free 
cards to voters who did not have a driv-
er’s license. 
In order to vote in person, most 
States require voters to produce some 
valid form of identification. I know 
mine does. In Texas, there are three op-
tions—actually, several options: a driv-
er’s license, a passport, a military ID, a 
citizenship certificate, and other forms 
of government-issued ID. If, for some 
reason, you can’t obtain one of these 
forms of ID, there is still a process in 
place to allow a person to vote by pre-
senting other documents, making sure 
that they identify the person casting 
the ballot. 
Matching the name of an eligible 
voter with the name on a valid form of 
ID is a commonsense safeguard against 
fraud but one which this legislation 
seeks to eliminate. If you go to a con-
venience store and want to buy a six- 
pack of beer or if you want to buy ciga-
rettes or you want to get on an air-
plane, you have to present an ID card, 
but this bill eliminates that require-
ment when it comes to the most sacred 
duty and privilege that we have as citi-
zens, and that is to vote. 
This legislation stops States from re-
quiring voters to provide proof of iden-
tification. Just sign a piece of paper 
saying you are who you are, and no one 
can ask any questions. On top of that, 
this bill would require the States to 
automatically register anyone in their 
databases, for everything from DMV to 
public assistance programs. Well, we 
know these databases are not limited 
to registered voters or even eligible 
voters. That could include people ille-
gally present in the country because 
some States allow a driver’s license to 
be issued to noncitizens who are not le-
gally present in the country. These 
databases include other noncitizens 
and others not eligible to vote, not to 
mention the fact that those who are al-
ready registered to vote could be reg-
istered again and again. 
And even if there are duplicate reg-
istrations or if someone passes away or 
moves, States would not be allowed to 
clean up the voter rolls within 6 
months of an election. Just when you 
think things can’t get any crazier, they 
do. 
Our Democratic colleagues are pro-
posing that the taxpayers fund their 
elections. A lot of companies have a 
match program for charitable giving. If 
an employee donates to a charity of 
their choice, then the company will 
match that donation dollar for dollar. 
The same principle applies except, in-
stead of a charity getting the money, 
under this proposed legislation, it is 
now a political candidate. Instead of a 
company footing the bill, it is the tax-
payers, and instead of an exact match, 
it is up to $6 for every $1 donated. That 
means if someone donates 200 bucks to 
their preferred candidate, Federal tax-
payers will wind up coughing up $1,200. 
Well, I think there are a lot of better 
uses for government tax dollars. They 
can go to support crime victims or sup-
port the response to the humanitarian 
crisis at the border, which we are expe-
riencing right now. But, no, the pro-
posal in this legislation is, let’s use it 
to elect them. 
Then there are the campaign vouch-
ers. This bill creates a new program 
that provides eligible voters with a $25 
voucher to donate to the campaign of 
their choosing—again, more govern-
ment, taxpayer-funded election activi-
ties. 
I could go on and on. 
This legislation also alters the funda-
mental structure of the Federal Elec-
tion Commission to remove any need 
for bipartisanship or consensus build-
ing. It undermines trust and account-
ability in elections. It implements a 
new financial disclosure policy that 
even the American Civil Liberties 
Union says ‘‘could directly interfere 
with the ability of many to engage in 
political speech about causes that they 
care about.’’ That is the ACLU. 
Above all, this bill amounts to noth-
ing more than a Federal hijacking of 
State elections. I can promise you, 
folks in my State don’t want Speaker 
PELOSI or Majority Leader SCHUMER to 
determine how elections are run in our 
State. They want accountable leaders 
in our State, elected by and account-
able to them, to determine the best 
way to conduct free and fair elections. 
Following the last two Presidential 
campaigns, the side that lost had ex-
pressed concerns about election secu-
rity. A partisan attempt to overhaul 
our entire election system is hardly a 
confidence-building exercise. This bill 
is not a serious attempt to improve se-
curity and accountability in our elec-
tions; rather, it is a partisan power 
grab that will do serious damage to our 
Republic. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from New Jersey. 
RACISM 
Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I 
take no pleasure in coming to the floor 
today. We in the Senate take pride in 
our decorum and our sense of comity 
with each other, so much so that we 
often twist ourselves into pretzels to 
avoid saying anything that might be 
interpreted as a criticism of another 
Senator. Yet there comes a time when 
these verbal gymnastics simply won’t 
do. You are either going to speak the 
truth or fail to do justice to the values 
you hold dear. 
What one of our colleagues said last 
week about the events of January 6 was 
felt by many to be racist and hurtful— 
a stain on the office he is so fortunate 
to hold. 
Look, I get that no one likes to be 
called racist, but sometimes there is 
just no other way to describe the use of 
bigoted tropes that for generations 
have threatened Black lives by stoking 
White fear of African Americans and 
Black men in particular. 
On a radio show, our colleague ex-
plained that he never feared for his 
safety during the January 6 insurrec-
tion of the U.S. Capitol. But make no 
mistake, 
under 
different 
cir-
cumstances, he would have been afraid. 
He said: 
Now, had the tables been turned—now, Joe, 
this will get me in trouble—had the tables 
been turned and President Trump won the 
election and those were tens of thousands of 
Black Lives Matter and antifa protesters, I 
might have been a little concerned. 
Is that not racism? 
I don’t think the Senator is ignorant 
of the fact that for centuries in this 
country, White supremacy has thrived 
on using fear to justify oppression, dis-
crimination, and violence against peo-
ple of color. I do, however, think my 
colleague may be ignorant of the pain 
caused by his comments and unaware 
of how they compound the trauma that 
so many still feel in the wake of the 
events of January 6. 
Because I do not think I can do jus-
tice to that pain, I want to share with 
you an email I received this weekend. 
It is from one of the most devoted pub-
lic servants I have ever had the pleas-
ure of working with, an African-Amer-
ican member of my staff. His name is 
Keith Roachford. He has devoted near-
ly three and one-half decades to serv-
ing the people of New Jersey in Con-
gress and his community as a faithful 
churchgoer and Boy Scout leader. It 
reads: 
Senator, 
I would not normally send you an email 
like this but I am at a loss of how to express

March 16, 2021 
the outrage and hurt I am feeling from the 
comments made by Senator JOHNSON that he 
would have been more afraid on January 6th 
if the insurrectionists would have been from 
Black Lives Matter. 
I am blessed to be on your staff and have 
had the opportunity to serve as a staff mem-
ber in the NJ delegation for 34 years, but this 
is the most painful thing I have ever heard 
being said by a US Senator. 
I could not imagine that the horrible and 
painful events from [January] 6th could be 
replicated in a statement from a sitting 
member of the Senate. 
However, Johnson’s comment is worse 
than the image of the insurrectionists walk-
ing through the Capitol building with the 
confederate flag. 
He is perpetrating the racist trope that the 
country should fear black people. 
I have experienced what it is like to have 
a taxi cab pass you by in order to pick up 
white passengers who are further down the 
block of where you are standing. 
Nothing can describe the feeling when you 
have entered a store and having store clerks 
watch your every step while shopping. 
Sandy— 
That is his wife— 
and I have had the conversations with our 
sons when they were young about how to 
enter a store; not look suspicious; keep your 
hands out of your pockets until you make 
your purchase; or how to respond and talk to 
police officers in any interaction. 
I have had the difficult conversation of ex-
plaining to a young black scouter in our 
scout troop why a white campground store 
clerk accused him of not paying for an item 
because he was black. 
[This] type of hate speech is [not] new. The 
hardest part of what he said is that in 2021, 
a United States Senator would so freely ex-
press this type of hate out loud. 
I am so grateful for our officers who en-
dured so many injuries on [January] 6th, and 
I pray that they will recover physically and 
mentally. 
They are going through so much right now, 
I feel guilty that my email to you might 
sound shallow because of the pain they are 
trying to overcome. 
I understand that the Senate works best 
when both sides can find common ground, 
but how do [you] really reach common 
ground when [such views can be held]? 
Again, I am sorry for reaching out late on 
Saturday evening, but I needed to share this 
with you. 
Keith. 
To read these pained words both 
broke my heart and boiled my blood. 
Thousands of people of color serve in 
the U.S. Capitol workforce. They are 
legislative staffers like Keith and Cap-
itol Police officers and maintenance 
workers, cafeteria staff, and so much 
more. I should not have to stand here 
and remind anyone that many of them 
feared for their lives on January 6. But 
not Senator JOHNSON. He felt no fear. 
He wasn’t afraid because, and I quote: 
I knew those are people that love this 
country, that truly respect law enforcement, 
would never do anything to break the law, so 
I wasn’t concerned. 
People who love this country do not 
desecrate our most sacred democratic 
institutions and display symbols of ra-
cial hatred like the Confederate flag in 
the halls of Congress. People who re-
spect law enforcement do not assault 
Capitol Police officers, beat them with-
in inches of death, and hurl ugly epi-
thets at officers of color. And people 
who would never do anything to break 
the law would not try to overturn the 
rule of law, plot to kill elected offi-
cials, and stop the peaceful transfer of 
power as instructed by the Constitu-
tion of the United States. 
Now, I know what some rightwing 
media pundits and some of my Repub-
lican colleagues will say. They say it 
every time they are asked to accept 
some responsibility for perpetuating 
the lies told by President Trump that 
inspired the violent events of January 
6. 
They say: What about Black Lives 
Matter? 
They say: Well, what about it? 
Well, I say: Well, what about it? 
The violent picture they paint of this 
movement could not be more divorced 
from reality. At this point, several rep-
utable studies have confirmed that the 
protests launched in the wake of 
George Floyd’s chilling murder were 
overwhelmingly peaceful. I repeat: The 
Black Lives Matter movement is over-
whelmingly peaceful. I know many 
people don’t care about facts these 
days, but it is the truth. 
One study out of Harvard University 
analyzed 7,305 Black Lives Matter pro-
tests. The conclusion? Allow me to 
quote Professor Erica Chenoweth. She 
said: 
Only 3.7 percent of the protests involved 
property damage or [some form of] van-
dalism. Some portion of these involved nei-
ther police nor protesters, but people engag-
ing in vandalism or looting alongside the 
protests. In short, our data suggest that 96.3 
percent of events involved no property dam-
age or police injuries, and in 97.7 percent of 
events, no injuries were reported among par-
ticipants, bystanders or police. 
Likewise, the Armed Conflict Loca-
tion & Event Data Project—an organi-
zation I might add is partially funded 
by the U.S. Department of State’s Bu-
reau of Conflict and Stabilization Oper-
ations—examined 7,750 different Black 
Lives Matter demonstrations across 
the Nation last summer. They found 
just 3 percent of those protests associ-
ated with any violence or property de-
struction whatsoever. They also con-
cluded that police departments ‘‘dis-
proportionately used force while inter-
vening in demonstrations associated 
with the [Black Lives Matter] move-
ment relative to other types of dem-
onstrations.’’ 
Indeed, on January 6, as we waited 
for hours for backup from the National 
Guard and other law enforcement agen-
cies to come to the aid of Congress, I 
know that I am not the only one who 
could not help but think of the violent, 
government-sanctioned 
crackdowns 
that met Black Lives Matter protesters 
last summer. 
The bottom line is that these lies 
casting Black Lives Matter as violent 
have already done real damage. They 
have convinced millions of Americans 
that they should fear those who march 
under the banner of this movement for 
justice, when really it is the resurgence 
of violent White supremacy that should 
be Americans’ real cause for alarm. 
Indeed, last October, the Department 
of Homeland Security issued a report 
confirming that White supremacists 
pose the most lethal domestic terror 
threat to the American people. Re-
search from the Center for Strategic 
and International Studies finds that 
White supremacists and their sympa-
thizers carried out two-thirds of ter-
rorist plots and attacks in 2020. 
In the weeks since January 6, we 
have learned that far-right extremist 
groups that regularly preach White su-
premacy, such as the Oath Keepers and 
the Proud Boys, played a major role in 
plotting and executing the attack on 
the U.S. Capitol. 
Every Member of this body owes 
their life to the sacrifices made that 
afternoon by Capitol Police officers, in-
cluding officers of color. At least 100 of-
ficers were physically injured in the 
January 6 attack. One officer, a vet-
eran and fellow New Jerseyan named 
Brian Sicknick, later succumbed to the 
injuries he sustained. Two others sub-
sequently committed suicide. Hundreds 
of officers now carry with them invis-
ible scars from the trauma they en-
dured that day—scars that may not 
fade for years or even decades. 
For one of our colleagues to cast 
those who attacked the Capitol as 
harmless patriots while stroking fear 
of Black Americans is like rubbing salt 
in an open wound. 
Everybody in this body should know 
that when you perpetuate such racist 
tropes, you contribute to a culture 
that gives people permission to treat 
Black Americans as suspicious and 
their lives as expendable. We in the 
Senate are supposed to hold ourselves 
to a higher standard. We are supposed 
to advance America’s long march to-
ward a more perfect Union, not coddle 
and cater to those who would take us 
backwards, and we are supposed to 
stand up for the truth. That is what 
brought me to the floor today. 
I hope Members of this body on both 
sides of the aisle will join me in mak-
ing sure that we do not debase the in-
stitution and the people we are called 
to serve—all the people—for whom so 
much pain has existed for years and ex-
ists still today. 
With that, I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Oklahoma. 
BORDER SECURITY 
Mr. LANKFORD. Mr. President, on 
January 20 of this year, President 
Biden declared the repeal of an emer-
gency action at our southwest border. 
He withdrew that and said there is no 
emergency that currently exists there 
and paused all funding for the border 
wall system construction—stopped it. 
Wherever it was that day, it ended that 
day. 
The same day, he announced a 100- 
day moratorium on deportations in the 
country—stopped that. Within a few 
days, the courts stepped in and a Fed-
eral court said that you can’t just stop 
actually executing faithfully the laws 
of the United States. The court halted

March 16, 2021 
then his halt of a moratorium on de-
portations. In this case, his actual re-
quest for a moratorium on deportation 
halt was for those who had actually 
gone all the way through the court sys-
tem and a Federal court had asked 
them to be removed from the United 
States. That is what President Biden 
was trying to stop. 
Federal courts then stepped in and 
said that when the courts said they had 
to be removed, the executive branch 
can’t just ignore that. They have to ac-
tually be removed. 
That opened the flood gates. Those 
two announcements together—that we 
are not going to do any more border 
construction, that we are going to stop 
that, and the announcement of the 
moratorium—started the process of a 
stir in Central America among the 
human smugglers to get the word out 
to say this President is going to allow 
to let people in and it is going to be dif-
ferent. 
Why would I say that and why would 
they say that? Because even in the 
time when I was sitting down with now 
Secretary Mayorkas in his hearings be-
fore he was actually confirmed, I asked 
him in those hearings: If there is a 
caravan coming to the United States 
right now with hundreds of people in it 
and growing, what is your message to 
them if you became the Secretary of 
DHS? What would you want to make 
sure those folks heard? 
His response to me in that hearing 
was: I would tell them to wait. Not yet. 
Not yet. 
The coyotes didn’t hear it that way. 
They accelerated pushing people. 
What is actually happening on the 
border? 
Last weekend, I spent the weekend in 
Arizona 
just 
south 
of 
Tucson 
in 
Nogales, a small little town of 26,000 
people that sits right on the border 
with Mexico. It is 26,000 on the Amer-
ican side, but on the Mexican side it is 
a city of 450,000. It is a very large com-
munity on that side and, literally, they 
have built up the community directly 
against the border. 
Much of that border fencing has been 
there a very long time. They built 
properties directly against that fence. 
They are Mexicans. They can do that. 
That is their property to be able to do 
that. That is not the issue. 
The interesting thing was to visit 
with folks from HHS taking care of the 
unaccompanied minors in the area, to 
visit with Customs and Border Protec-
tion that are actually handling the 
cross-border transition, and with Bor-
der Patrol leadership to go through 
that area and see it. 
Let me tell you a couple of things I 
saw this weekend to help you get the 
context. The folks who I visited with at 
HHS, who are there taking care of the 
unaccompanied minors coming in—and 
we are seeing a significant surge of un-
accompanied minors because the Biden 
administration has changed the policy 
and said that if you are 18 years old 
and up, because of the pandemic, we 
are not going to allow you in. It is 
called title 42 authority. The Trump 
administration actually put that in 
place and said: During the time of the 
pandemic, we are trying to limit cross- 
border traffic. You can’t just come in. 
The Biden team changed that and 
said: If you are 18 and up, you can’t 
come in immediately. If you are 17 and 
down, you can. 
So we are seeing a massive surge of 
unaccompanied minors right now. It is 
literally an invitation to say: You can 
come, but don’t bring your family with 
you. 
When I sat down with the folks at 
HHS there, who are doing a fantastic 
job with the best they can to be able to 
take care of those kids, I asked them: 
What are you seeing? 
The vast majority of the kids that 
they are seeing coming across the bor-
der are 16- and 17-year-old males. When 
you hear the term, ‘‘We’ve got all these 
kids coming across the border,’’ some-
times, as Americans, we think these 
are 5-year-olds crossing the border. 
They are not. The vast majority of 
them are 16- and 17-year-old males 
coming across the border. They are 
also being transported to individuals 
who are here in the country who are 
family members and who are already 
present here in the country. Most of 
those are also illegally present in the 
country. They are uncles and aunts. 
They are cousins and brothers and sis-
ters who are already here because we 
have separate categories of how we ac-
tually transition those kids to someone 
who can take care of them before we 
have the court hearing. Most of those 
court hearings will take 2 the years. 
They are crossing the border, these 16- 
and 17-year-old males, and being con-
nected with an uncle who is already 
here and many times, illegally, as well. 
They will have the next 2 years to be 
here before they have a court hearing 
and be able to go through the process— 
if they come to the court hearing. 
When I visited with the folks at Cus-
toms and Border Protection, they were 
frustrated with the lack of funding 
that has been given to them to be able 
to take care of the needs for that par-
ticular facility and help manage the 
number of people who are coming 
through. They need additional assist-
ance because in that very old facility, 
they need additional barriers to just 
help them manage the flow of people as 
they come through. 
When I visited with Border Patrol, 
we drove just a couple of miles out into 
the desert, just to the west of this town 
of 450,000 people, to go see the new 
fence that is being constructed. It may 
be hard to see it in this, but miles and 
miles of new fencing are going in. 
But on the day of January 20, con-
struction was halted. In this particular 
area, there are miles and miles of fenc-
ing except for these gaps in the fence. 
Those gaps were put in there to be 
gates. So if they have to take care of 
the fence, they can get access to both 
sides of this. These miles and miles of 
fencing are done except for the gate 
area, and, literally, the steel for the 
gates are laying on the ground. 
Why in the world would you do con-
struction and have it stop to say you 
can build everything except close the 
gates? 
The Border Patrol team has literally 
drug over some of the steel just to be 
able to stack it in front of the gaps 
that are in the fence here to keep vehi-
cles from driving through and try to 
put different barriers there and try to 
slow down the traffic. 
For every one of these gaps along 
these miles and miles of fence, they are 
having to assign a Border Patrol agent 
there just to be able to sit at that gap 
because it is the obvious place to lit-
erally be able to walk through the 
fence. 
There is only one reason that you 
would have a fence like this for miles 
and miles and leave it open as a gap— 
to allow people through. Worse than 
that, all the way through this con-
struction area is just a dirt path they 
used for construction. But in the con-
tract itself, it was set up to allow for 
the fence construction first. Remem-
ber, this is a wall system. There is 
technology and wall. 
Walls are medieval, I get that, but 
there is a reason we still use fences in 
our backyard and still a reason we use 
fences as barriers because they work. 
They slow people down from actually 
crossing that barrier. 
But it is a wall system in place. For 
miles and miles and miles in the con-
tract and as it is written, they put up 
the fence first, close up the gates sec-
ond, and then they finish the road so 
Border 
Patrol 
can 
actually 
pass 
through here, even when it rains in this 
area, to have a simple road passage 
there. Then they put in ground-based 
sensors so they can detect when people 
are walking across. Then they put in 
lights and cameras—all the technology 
we talk about in this room. I can’t re-
member how many times I have heard 
my Democratic colleagues say: Fences 
are old. Let’s just do the technology. 
Technology can help manage this. 
In this situation, the contract is out 
and done. The fence is already in-
stalled, except for the gates, but no 
technology is there. So, literally, the 
Biden team stops before what even 
they claim is the effective part to stop 
people illegally crossing the border. 
The $1.6 billion was paused—that $1.6 
that goes to simply closing the gates 
and installing the technology. That is 
what remains. This is nonsensical. 
I understand the Biden team and 
some of my Democratic colleagues 
want a more open border. They have 
been clear on that. This does not pro-
vide security for our Nation. This is 
the result of saying: I don’t want any 
more wall. 
This is a nonsensical system on our 
southern border, with literally open 
areas that you could drive a truck 
through 
and 
where 
Border 
Patrol 
agents have to then sit at. Rather than

monitor large areas, they are stuck 
monitoring the open door. 
Listen, we can have arguments about 
immigration, but, supposedly, we all 
agree we should have border security— 
at least we used to. This doesn’t make 
sense. But this is now the reality, and 
it will sit like this for we don’t know 
how long—maybe forever—until we as 
a nation determine this has to change. 
It is an open invitation. 
Have things really changed signifi-
cantly on the border? Let me give you 
an example that is pre-COVID—pre- 
COVID, February of last year, before 
COVID came through. So don’t say 
that things have changed in COVID. In 
February of 2020, we had under 40,000 
people who were apprehended crossing 
our southern border that month—under 
40,000 pre-COVID. That is a transition 
and an arrest process. 
This February, with the only thing 
changing being the change of Presi-
dents, we had over 100,000 people ille-
gally crossing the border. One year 
later, we go from less than 40,000 to 
over 100,000. 
This is a manufactured crisis that is 
happening on our border: a halting of 
closing up the holes in the fence; state-
ments that we are going to do a mora-
torium, that we are not going to have 
anyone deported anymore; changing 
the rules on unaccompanied minors to 
basically invite them to come into the 
United States; and, again, statements 
like, ‘‘Caravans, I will just tell them to 
pause; we are not quite ready for you 
yet.’’ 
That is really not going to be a pause 
at all. That is going to be an invita-
tion. That is not me saying that. It is 
the thousands and thousands of people 
who are coming to be able to connect 
with relatives who are already here and 
to be able to walk through a process, to 
be able to go around our visa applica-
tion process and go around legal immi-
gration. 
I remind us as a country that we 
allow a million people a year to legally 
come to the United States and become 
citizens—a million people a year. We 
are not a stingy nation in engaging 
with legal immigration. There is a 
right way to do it, and we welcome 
people to do it the right way. This is 
welcoming people to do it the wrong 
way, and that does not help our secu-
rity as a nation. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Wyoming. 
BUDGET 
Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I 
come to the floor to talk about Presi-
dent Biden’s runaway spending pro-
posals. 
Of course, as a conservative Repub-
lican, when I look at this thing, I have 
to say: Wait a second. This is not some-
thing that I can support in any way. 
We have a 50–50 Senate here in the 
United States. The Democrats have 
won a narrow margin in the House, but 
the Democrats in Washington are act-
ing like they have won in a landslide 
and have a national mandate. They do 
not. If there is any mandate when you 
have a 50–50 Senate and when you have 
such a narrow range in the numbers be-
tween the Republicans and the Demo-
crats in the House, you would say it is 
a mandate to move to the middle. That 
is what the American people voted for. 
They said: Let’s get to the middle. 
Let’s find solutions to move our coun-
try forward. 
It does seem, to me, what the Demo-
crats are doing is an unprecedented 
overreach. The Democrats have only 
had control in Washington for about a 
month and a half, and it has already 
cost the American people $1.9 trillion. 
It is an astonishingly large figure. It 
was supposed to be for coronavirus re-
lief, but 1 percent of the money went 
for vaccines, and only 9 percent went 
to actually fighting the coronavirus. 
Yet, before they passed the bill, that is 
what the Democrats said it was for. It 
does seem to be the oldest page in the 
Democratic playbook. 
We all remember the old ObamaCare 
bill and debate and discussion. They 
said it was a tax. When they needed 
votes in Congress, they said it wasn’t a 
tax. Then they realized they were 
going to lose in court, and they said it 
was a tax all over again. Well, we have 
seen the same playbook here. They said 
we needed more coronavirus relief, and 
then they passed this liberal wish list. 
Once they had the votes, they admitted 
the bill was not about coronavirus 
medical relief, healthcare relief or vac-
cines or fighting the disease. No—a lib-
eral wish list. 
Now, don’t just take my word for it. 
The 
Democratic 
majority 
leader, 
standing right there, called it a ‘‘turn-
ing point’’ that transforms the United 
States. The White House Press Sec-
retary called it the ‘‘most progressive 
bill in American history.’’ One Demo-
cratic leader in the House called it an 
‘‘ideological revolution.’’ I guess they 
forgot it was supposed to be about the 
coronavirus. It doesn’t sound like 
coronavirus healthcare relief to me. 
After the bill passed, Speaker PELOSI 
admitted this was the same bill that 
she put forward last summer. Back 
then, the New York Times looked at it 
and called it ‘‘more a messaging docu-
ment than a viable piece of legisla-
tion.’’ POLITICO called it a ‘‘Demo-
cratic wish list filled up with all the 
party’s favorite policies.’’ 
This was never a coronavirus relief 
bill. They used the coronavirus to 
cover the payoff to all of the most pow-
erful people in the Democratic Party: 
$85 billion to union pension plans, irre-
sponsibly run; $26 billion for California 
Gavin Newsom; $12.5 billion for New 
York and Governor Andrew Cuomo; a 
big payoff for teachers unions and po-
tentially millions for Planned Parent-
hood. 
President Biden signed the bill, and 
then he gave a speech a few hours 
later. In effect, he admitted the bill 
doesn’t get us 1 day closer to reopening 
our country. This is what this was sup-
posed to be about—getting kids back to 
school, getting people back to work, 
and getting the virus behind us. Presi-
dent Biden said ‘‘there is a good 
chance’’ that small groups of people 
can get together outside in July. Well, 
he said, ‘‘that doesn’t mean large 
events.’’ 
The Democrats spent $1.9 trillion, 
and, once again, they moved the goal-
posts. Congress has already paid for 
enough vaccines for every American to 
get vaccinated by the end of May. The 
Centers for Disease Control and Pre-
vention says that getting vaccinated 
means getting your life back. This is 
what they told us. It means you can 
have indoor gatherings without masks. 
America needs to be fully open before 
the Fourth of July. 
The Democrats haven’t even finished 
their victory lap over the spending bill, 
and they are already telling us they 
want more. Here are just a few exam-
ples of what they propose to do, not 
with their money but with the Amer-
ican people’s money—the taxpayers’ 
money, the hard-earned dollars of the 
people who go to work every day and 
send their tax dollars to Washington. 
In their $1.9 trillion wish list, the 
Democrats tried to double the min-
imum wage by Federal mandate. They 
failed, but they are going to keep try-
ing. 
Now, of course, the Office of Manage-
ment and Budget, which took a look at 
this thing, said: Well, if they had suc-
ceeded, it would have forced 1.4 million 
Americans who have jobs right now to 
be out of their jobs because, when you 
mandate a doubling of the minimum 
wage, small businesses are either going 
to have to close or lay off certain peo-
ple so they can pay the wages to others 
in an effort to keep the doors open. It 
means less tax revenue overall for the 
country, and it means more spending 
for unemployment insurance. If you 
add it up, it would increase the na-
tional debt by about an additional $54 
billion. 
In their $1.9 trillion wish list, the 
Democrats also wrote a big check to 
the teachers unions. 
Now, they actually didn’t need the 
money because, in the five bipartisan 
coronavirus bills that we have passed 
in overwhelming majorities, we sent 
schools 
$113 
billion. 
The 
schools 
haven’t even spent most of that money 
yet. In fact, they have only spent about 
$16 billion of the $113 billion. There is 
almost $100 billion yet to spend. On top 
of that, the Democrats have just put up 
another $170 billion in their wish list. If 
you add it up, that is nearly $270 bil-
lion to spend with no promise—none— 
to reopen the schools. 
The Democratic leader wants to for-
give $1 trillion in student loans. Sub-
sidizing student loans just lets colleges 
raise prices. That is exactly what 
would happen if Leader SCHUMER’s plan 
were to become law. Colleges don’t 
need to raise prices. They need to lower 
the cost of education. 
Senator SANDERS has an even more 
radical proposal. He wants to forgive

all Federal student loans, and that 
would cost $1.6 trillion. Forgive them 
all. Just forgive all of the loans. It 
doesn’t matter. Rich or poor, forgive 
all of the loans. Well, that would drive 
up the price of tuition even higher. If it 
allows colleges to get the money di-
rectly from the Federal Government 
without having to go through the stu-
dents, the costs will escalate dramati-
cally. 
Let me remind my Democratic col-
leagues that most Americans don’t 
have college degrees. Yet, under the 
Democratic plan, all taxpayers—all 
taxpayers—would have to pay for the 
college tuitions for all of the students, 
including those who have families who 
can clearly afford to pay the tuitions 
to the colleges which they attend. It 
doesn’t matter. If you go to the most 
exclusive college or if you go to your 
State college, if you have a debt, we 
are going to get rid of it, says the 
Democratic proposal, and the hard- 
working taxpayers of America are 
going to be stuck with the bill. Count 
me out on that one. 
The Democrats want to take tax dol-
lars from people who don’t have college 
degrees or who never went to college 
and give it to the leftwing professors at 
so many universities, and this is 
wrong. 
President Biden also wants to double 
down 
on 
ObamaCare. 
He 
thinks 
ObamaCare didn’t go far enough. Ac-
cording to one estimate, President 
Biden’s healthcare plan would cost 
about an additional $2.25 trillion. These 
are astronomically large figures. His 
housing plan would cost $640 billion. 
The Democrats have proposed another 
$2 trillion in infrastructure spending. 
One Democratic Senator even called 
for doubling that amount—$4 trillion 
in new infrastructure spending. 
This is just the tip of the iceberg. I 
could go on and on. If you add up all of 
the new spending proposals by the 
Democrats and the White House and 
the Senate, it could cost nearly $12 
trillion. By the end of this year, the 
national debt is going to be bigger than 
our economy, and we have the biggest 
economy in the world. Even before the 
Democrats passed their wish list, we 
were on track this year to have the 
second biggest deficit since World War 
II. 
When the Democrats increase spend-
ing, we know what is next—massive 
tax increases on the American public. 
We heard it yesterday in the news. It 
was in the headlines. That is President 
Biden’s plan—the first major tax in-
crease in 28 years. He is proposing the 
biggest tax increase since 1993. He 
wants to raise taxes on businesses and 
on families, and he even wants to res-
urrect the death tax. Let me remind 
President Biden what happened after 
1993. A year later, the Republicans 
took back the House and took back the 
Senate. 
The 2020 elections were close. The 
American people didn’t vote for this 
radical agenda, and it is a radical agen-
da. They didn’t vote for $12 trillion in 
new spending and new taxes with in-
creased tax rates and increased taxes 
on long-term investments like your 
home and increased taxes like the 
death tax—oh—and more money for the 
IRS so it can send agents to inves-
tigate the American public even fur-
ther. 
I would urge the Biden administra-
tion and my Democratic colleagues to 
listen to the people and to the people 
from whom I hear every weekend in 
Wyoming. It is time to put down the 
credit card. It is time to stop the 
spending spree. It is time to move to 
the middle to solve problems—that 
would be best for our Nation if we 
would address them—for the people of 
this great Nation. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
BORDER SECURITY 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, we 
welcome about a million immigrants 
every year. We welcome them because 
they come here, abiding by our laws, 
and we need immigrants. We have been 
a welcoming country for a long time, 
but I come to the floor to speak about 
the ongoing crisis at our southern bor-
der—a crisis that, I think, this admin-
istration doesn’t want to admit is a 
crisis. Because of some changes in pol-
icy, we have that crisis, and that crisis 
is people entering our country in viola-
tion of our laws. 
Since taking office, this administra-
tion has advanced policies that have 
undermined immigration enforcement. 
These policies undermine efforts to se-
cure our southern border, and they en-
courage illegal immigration into our 
country. President Biden has signaled 
that, when it comes to immigration 
that violates our laws, the United 
States is open for business. Speaker 
PELOSI and House Democrats are dou-
bling down on that position this very 
week. They are working to pass several 
mass amnesty bills that contain no 
provisions related to securing the bor-
der. 
It turns out that people are finally 
paying attention. U.S. Customs and 
Border Protection recently confirmed 
that it had encountered over 100,000 mi-
grants attempting to cross the south-
ern border in February—the first full 
month of this new administration. 
That is the highest total for the month 
of February since 2006. News reports 
are 
that 
Democrats 
are 
blaming 
Trump’s policies for this situation that 
we are in. Yet the number of single 
adults encountered at the southern 
border was up 175 percent compared to 
last February. The number of family 
units was up 170 percent, and the num-
ber of unaccompanied alien children 
was up 171 percent. 
The 
Department 
of 
Health 
and 
Human Services, which is responsible 
for the care of the unaccompanied chil-
dren after they arrive in the United 
States, had 7,300 unaccompanied chil-
dren referrals in February. That is the 
highest number of February referrals 
in the history of the program. 
As of late last week, Health and 
Human Services had over 8,500 unac-
companied children in its facilities. 
As of this past weekend, more than 
4,200 were being held by the Customs 
and Border Patrol holding facilities, 
with nearly 3,000 being held past the 
legal limit of 72 hours. 
These are the ‘‘kids in cages,’’ whom 
many of our Democratic colleagues 
were so outraged about a few years 
ago, blaming Trump, even though the 
so-called cages were created in the 
Obama administration, just being re-
used again. 
Curiously, we are not seeing nearly 
as much outrage now as we saw during 
the Trump episode. Where is our fair 
and balanced press today? 
Reports emerged late last week that 
one Border Patrol facility in Texas was 
operating at 729 percent of pandemic 
capacity. Many minors who had been in 
custody for over 5 days were reportedly 
able to shower only once. 
If this were happening during the 
Trump administration, our Democratic 
colleagues would be expressing their 
anger and their outrage on any media 
outlet that they could find. But be-
cause this crisis is happening as a re-
sult of President Biden’s policies, we 
have mostly silence. 
President 
Biden’s 
border 
crisis 
reaches beyond just these staggering 
numbers that I have given you. First, 
it is a humanitarian tragedy—a crisis. 
The Biden administration’s policies 
have incentivized unaccompanied chil-
dren and family units to make an in-
credibly dangerous trip to our southern 
borders. 
On March 10, Reuters reported that 
the Mexican Government is worried 
that the Biden administration’s asy-
lum policies ‘‘are stoking illegal immi-
gration and creating business for orga-
nized crime’’—from the Mexican Gov-
ernment, reported by Reuters. 
There is no doubt that cartels are 
profiting greatly from this trafficking. 
One Mexican official was quoted as 
saying: ‘‘Migrants have become a com-
modity.’’ 
The article went on to discuss how 
gangs are ‘‘diversifying methods of 
smuggling’’ and how smugglers are ad-
vising migrants on how to more easily 
apply for asylum in the United States, 
including by bringing children. 
It also described how higher con-
centrations of migrants in areas near 
the U.S.-Mexican border have encour-
aged gangs to recruit some migrants as 
drug mules and to kidnap other mi-
grants. For what? For money. This is a 
tragedy, and it is a tragedy created in 
just recent weeks by changes of poli-
cies at the border by this new adminis-
tration.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1549 
March 16, 2021 
Second, President Biden’s border cri-
sis presents a public health threat in 
the middle of a pandemic. 
Recent reports have indicated that 
the administration plans to turn two 
Texas facilities, where migrant family 
units are being held, into rapid proc-
essing centers. The plan is to hold the 
family units for 3 days or less. 
It is unclear if all of these migrants 
are being tested for COVID–19, when 
they are being tested, how they are 
being tested, and how they are being 
handled if they test positively. 
Recent media reports also indicate 
that 100 undocumented immigrants 
who were released by the Department 
of Homeland Security into the United 
States later tested positive for the 
virus. In these times, as we are all con-
cerned about the pandemic, it can’t be 
acceptable. 
Finally, President Biden’s border cri-
sis has created a situation that is over-
whelming the men and women who 
work to protect our borders. It is 
straining the resources of agencies that 
must cope with the results of this ad-
ministration’s misguided immigration 
policies. 
One of the most important respon-
sibilities of the Federal Government 
and any Presidential administration, 
Republican or Democrat, is to enforce 
our immigration laws in ways that en-
sure the sovereignty of our borders, 
protects the American people, and, 
lastly, discourages illegal immigration. 
It is clear that this administration has 
failed to live up to this responsibility. 
I hope that President Biden changes 
course and begins to work with Con-
gress in a bipartisan way to secure our 
borders and, at the same time, reform 
our laws in ways that discourage this 
violation of our immigration laws by 
people just willy-nilly crossing the bor-
der, even being invited here. If they in-
stead continue on their present course, 
this will be just the first of many bor-
der surges to come over the next 4 
years. 
What we need is to keep our doors 
open, as we have done for decades with 
legal immigrants, and do everything 
we can to discourage people from com-
ing here in violation of our laws. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. MAR-
KEY). The clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to 
call the roll. 
Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
The Senator from Ohio. 
JOBS ACT 
Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, I am 
here on the floor today to talk about 
workforce training, a critical issue al-
ways but particularly now as we get to 
the point where we are coming out of 
the COVID–19 crisis, the economy is 
picking up, and we need more workers 
in this country. 
It is a significant issue to be able to 
help individuals to be able to achieve 
their God-given potential in life, but 
also it is really important to our econ-
omy because workforce is one of the 
big challenges we have. So to be able to 
get good-paying benefits for those 
workers, it is important but also to 
help our economy fully recover from 
the effects of the COVID–19 pandemic. 
It has been over a year now since the 
pandemic changed all of our lives. In 
the early weeks and months of that cri-
sis, it looked like things were going to 
continue to be really tough. I stayed in 
touch with business owners and work-
ers across my home State of Ohio to 
hear how they were handling the clo-
sures, the layoffs, the other painful 
side effects of the crisis in those early 
months. Finally, things are getting 
better, and we are beginning to see 
more reopenings. 
In Ohio, we just learned that people 
are going to be able to get vaccinations 
if they are 40 years old or older versus 
60 years old and older as of the end of 
the week. And within another 10 days, 
everybody 16 years and up will be able 
to get a vaccine. And we have opened 
up some wonderful mass vaccination 
centers. I volunteered at one on Satur-
day. I spent 5 hours directing people 
and heard a lot of emotional stories 
about people really excited about get-
ting back to their families—grand-
parents 
being 
able 
to 
see 
their 
grandkids for the first time in a year 
and the opposite, children being able to 
visit their parents or grandparents for 
the first time since the COVID–19 crisis 
hit, and people excited about getting 
back to work and back to school. So we 
are going to be able to see this because 
of Operation Warp Speed and the heroic 
efforts of our medical researchers and 
begin to help move our economy for-
ward. 
In fact, we just found out that the 
economy added a healthy 379,000 jobs in 
February. That was encouraging. And 
more and more businesses, again, are 
reopening and replacing the signs that 
said ‘‘Closed Because of COVID’’ with 
signs that now say ‘‘Help Wanted.’’ 
I was at a hearing today, and the rep-
resentative from the National Associa-
tion of Manufacturers told us that 
there are over 500,000 manufacturing 
jobs that are being offered right now. 
In other words, there is a shortage of 
manufacturing skills right now. So 
that is a good thing in the sense that 
that means there will be opportunity, 
but we have to have the skills to be 
able to fill those jobs. 
Perhaps most promising, the non-
partisan Congressional Budget Office, 
called CBO—it is a group around here 
that gives us advice on the economy— 
said that even without the most recent 
spending package, the $1.9 trillion 
package, that the economy is going to 
recover to where it was prepandemic by 
midyear. So by June 30, they think the 
economy will be back to where it was 
prepandemic. And we had a good econ-
omy then. In February, a year ago, we 
had the 19th straight month of wage 
growth of 3 percent or more. We had 3.5 
percent unemployment, a 50-year low. 
We had historically low unemployment 
for Blacks, Hispanics. We had the low-
est poverty rate we had in 60 years. 
Things are going well, not just for the 
economy but bringing people out of the 
sidelines and in to work. But, obvi-
ously, the pandemic hit hard. And, 
now, as the economy begins to recover 
again, we have to be sure that people 
have the skills they need to take ad-
vantage of a growing economy. 
The pro-growth policies that we have 
had along the way, including the tax 
cuts, tax reform, regulatory relief, had 
helped to make sure that economy was 
not just strong but also inclusive. So 
we have to keep that up as well. 
But just as the biggest challenge pre- 
COVID, when we had a strong economy, 
was finding workers with needed skills, 
we are back there again. So if we want 
to get back to the kind of economy we 
all want, the workforce challenge has 
to be addressed. 
In fact, again, I think it will be an 
even bigger challenge now because dur-
ing COVID–19, there has been a disloca-
tion in the economy. Some jobs have 
been lost, and people have to find new 
jobs and develop skills. Some are going 
to have to leave the hospitality indus-
try, for instance, and they might want 
to go into the tech sector or go into 
the 
manufacturing 
sector 
or 
the 
healthcare sector. So that ability to 
shift jobs and develop skills is more 
important than ever. 
I am hearing it from employers all 
over Ohio; that as unemployment con-
tinues to fall, there are thousands of 
job openings for positions like welders 
and machinists in our manufacturing 
plants. I mentioned the national figure 
of 500,000 jobs are available right now, 
so we are certainly seeing that in Ohio 
in our factories, medical technicians in 
hospitals, a lot of interest in techs and 
in people who are willing to work in 
healthcare to help others, computer 
programmers, coders. Almost every 
sector of the economy is looking for 
people who have coding skills. So these 
are the kinds of jobs that economists 
call the midlevel skills; you know, they 
need more than a high school degree, 
for sure, but don’t need a college de-
gree. And they actually are jobs that 
pay quite well with good benefits. So 
these are the kinds of jobs that we need 
to be sure that we are providing out 
there. 
The supply of skilled workers in that 
category, students pursuing post-high 
school certificates in one of these 
skilled areas, falls way short. They call 
it the skills gap. And it is holding back 
our economy from reaching its poten-
tial, just as it is holding back individ-
uals from achieving their potential. 
There was one study from 2019 that 
found that the skills gap could cause us 
to miss out on nearly $1.2 trillion of 
economic output over the next, at that 
point, 10 years. So, unfortunately, that 
skills gap hasn’t been closed. In fact,

again, I think it is more important 
than ever that we address it. 
The best option, I think, is to tackle 
it head-on by getting more people en-
rolled in these programs that can pro-
vide the skills training and equip them 
with the specialized skills that they 
need. 
When people hear the words ‘‘skills 
training,’’ their first thought is often 
of career and technical education, CTE. 
There are some great CTE programs 
around the country. Some in my gen-
eration called it vocational education, 
but this is not your father’s Olds-
mobile. This is not the same old voca-
tional education; this is high-tech 
stuff. It is really exciting what is going 
on. These programs are run by middle 
schools and by high schools that teach 
students an incredible variety of skills: 
health sciences, business management, 
culinary arts, manufacturing skills. By 
the way, they are incredibly popular. 
The good programs are really oversub-
scribed. 
One data point that I found inter-
esting said that 92 percent of high 
school students are taking at least 
some kind of skills training course 
from the CTE programs. That doesn’t 
mean 92 percent are enrolled full time 
in CTE but taking at least some of 
those courses. 
I have visited those schools all over 
Ohio. Again, they are exciting. They 
are specialized high schools that offer 
students a more specialized path than 
the traditional path that many stu-
dents are encouraged to take, which 
would be to try to get a 4-year college 
degree. 
By the way, again, this path, this 
specialized path, where you get these 
skills, leads to no student debt—assum-
ing you could find a way to pay for the 
skills training, which we will talk 
about in a second—and a good job with 
good pay and good benefits, as opposed 
to many people who go to college and 
end up having a lot of debt and not 
having a degree that enables them to 
get the kind of job that they want. So 
it is a great option to do CTE and to 
get the skills training. 
I am cofounder and cochair of what 
we call the Senate CTE Caucus, Career 
and Technical Education Caucus, with 
my colleague Senator TIM
KAINE
of 
Virginia. And we have worked to 
strengthen CTE programs, made them 
more accessible, made them more af-
fordable, provided more Federal help 
for them. We have gone now from 2 to 
more than 29 Senators in our CTE Cau-
cus. Our goal is to increase awareness 
of these CTE programs and the skills 
training they provide and get students 
interested in that kind of career train-
ing, provide the resources and opportu-
nities that will then provide them what 
they need for good jobs with good pay. 
We have also worked together on bi-
partisan legislation to make sure that 
the Federal Government is a better 
partner to States and local commu-
nities as they work to ensure these 
young people have the skills to find 
good jobs. 
But CTE at the high school level 
alone isn’t going to solve our work-
force needs. Most industry-recognized 
certificates require more than the CTE 
training. They require a higher level of 
training. And CTE programs, as out-
standing as they can be, are usually in-
accessible to Americans who are no 
longer of high school age but would 
stand to benefit greatly from these 
skills programs. So people who are out 
of high school, adults, to get that more 
advanced certificate or to help older 
learners, the best option is to instead 
attend a certificate-granting technical 
workforce training program, the kind 
offered by your community college or 
your technical school. 
These programs are outstanding. At 
Ohio technical schools, like the East-
land-Fairfield Career Center, the Van-
tage Community College, the Delaware 
Area Career Center, Stark State, and 
others, I have spoken to students in 
technical programs who tell me how 
excited they are to put these skills to 
work. Unfortunately, individuals po-
tentially interested in these programs 
often cannot afford to make the invest-
ment in that education without some 
financial assistance. 
I talked to Dr. Para Jones today. She 
is with Stark State in Summit County, 
Akron, OH. She told me an interesting 
story. She said that they have a real 
need in that area of Ohio, and, frankly, 
around the country, for truckdrivers. 
So for people to have the certificate, 
which is called a CDL—commercial 
truckdrivers license—they had open-
ings in their courses, but it was $5,000. 
It cost $5,000 to get a CDL. And even 
though these students would be mak-
ing that $5,000 and more in the coming 
years because truck driving is going to 
be quite a good career for them—50-,
60-, 70,000 bucks a year, plus benefits, 
depending on how much they are will-
ing to drive—the 5,000 bucks was just 
too much of a burden, too high a hur-
dle. So her view is: You guys have to 
help us to be able to help students get 
into the programs they want to get 
into. 
I remember talking to a welder at a 
career and technical high school pro-
gram. It was a woman, 1 of 2 women in 
a class of 12 people—10 guys, 2 women. 
She was doing some pretty sophisti-
cated welding, but she said she wanted 
to take it to the next level; she wanted 
to be an underwater welder, which pays 
a lot. We are talking over a hundred 
thousand bucks a year, easily; yet she 
couldn’t get the skills at the high 
school level. 
And when she was offered a Pell 
grant to go to college, she decided to 
take that instead, even though she 
wanted to be a welder. The government 
couldn’t help her go to welding school. 
And this welding school was expensive. 
It makes the $5,000 for getting the CDL 
look like nothing. So it was tens of 
thousands of dollars to get this ad-
vanced certificate. 
But she was offered the Pell grant to 
go to college, so she was going to col-
lege, even though she would rather be a 
welder. By the way, these welders are 
highly sought after by the energy in-
dustry and others. 
So it is one of those examples where, 
if we could direct some of these Fed-
eral resources, not taking it away from 
colleges or universities but into our 
training programs, it would make so 
much sense, particularly for low-in-
come students. And that is how I get to 
the Pell grants. 
So Senator KAINE and I have intro-
duced legislation that is called the 
Jumpstart Our Businesses by Sup-
porting Students Act, or the JOBS Act. 
So we came up with an acronym so we 
could end up with the JOBS Act. 
It makes all the sense in the world. It 
says that instead of getting a Pell 
grant that can only be used for going 
to a college or university, you should 
be able to get a Pell grant to get one of 
these 
shorter-term, 
industry-recog-
nized certificates. They have to be 
high-quality, industry recognized. I 
think it would be much better for the 
students and certainly much better for 
the economy. Those are the middle 
skills that we need so desperately. Yet 
we are not supporting those students. 
By the way, of those students who 
end up going to college with a Pell 
grant, they say that fewer than half 
end up getting a college degree in the 
end. Why? Well, the Pell doesn’t pay 
for your full expenses. There are very 
few colleges in Ohio where you can use 
a Pell and get through without having 
significant additional expenses on top 
of that. 
It is tough, and a lot of people drop 
out to be able to go back to work, as 
opposed to these career and training 
programs where, No. 1, you are looking 
down the tunnel and you can see the 
light at the end of the tunnel. You 
have got 10 weeks in this training pro-
gram. You can get there. And you see 
at the end of that—to mix my meta-
phors here, you see the rainbow at the 
end of that, which is a job, a great job, 
with good benefits. Plus, the $6,400 
from the Pell Program pays for it. For 
the most part, these programs are fully 
paid for by the Pell grant. So it is a 
really good idea. 
And the JOBS Act is something Sen-
ator TIM KAINE and I have introduced 
before and we are introducing again 
this week. We want these low-income 
students to be able to get what they 
need to be able to get the good jobs, 
and we want our economy to be able to 
get those positions filled so that we 
can continue to grow our economy as a 
country. 
By the way, it doesn’t mean these 
students aren’t going to go on to a col-
lege or university. I was in a CTE pro-
gram several years ago talking to some 
students, one of whom was going to a 
local manufacturer who was a supplier 
to GE Aviation, which makes aircraft 
engines. He ended up going—50,000 
bucks a year at the time, good bene-
fits—to this manufacturer. He was 
learning welding and other skills. 
Well, that company ended up paying 
for his college later, which I later

found out, which is not atypical. So it 
is a good example of where it doesn’t 
mean you are not going to go to col-
lege. Some people will want to, and 
some people won’t. This young man 
wanted to get an engineering degree, 
and the company was happy to help 
him do that to be able to come back to 
that company and to provide those 
skills. 
So whether it is learning how to con-
duct HVAC installation, how to oper-
ate factory machinery, how to program 
computers, these programs teach stu-
dents practical, transferrable skills to 
be able to keep our economy moving. 
Increasing access to the skills train-
ing through the JOBS Act can also 
serve to lend a helping hand for those 
who have lost their jobs due to COVID– 
19. As I said earlier, many jobs have 
come back and are continuing to come 
back as we reopen our economy, but we 
are still down about nine, nine and a 
half million jobs from before the pan-
demic. 
Some are at businesses that are now 
closed or in industries that have strug-
gled 
and 
may 
be 
fundamentally 
changed as a result of the pandemic. In 
other words, some of these jobs won’t 
come back, so people need to re-up 
their skills training. Folks who had 
those jobs, giving them the option to 
invest in a new skill set through tech-
nical education funded by a Pell grant 
is a ray of hope, a chance for them to 
get back on their feet, to find new, ex-
citing, good-paying jobs. 
I am pleased to say the JOBS Act has 
been endorsed by the National Skills 
Coalition, the Association for Career 
and Technical Education, the Associa-
tion of Community College Trustees— 
in fact, last year, it was their No. 1 pri-
ority, among the community colleges— 
the American Association of Commu-
nity Colleges, and other groups. 
The reason the JOBS Act has this 
kind of strong support is it is the best 
proposal out there that will help fill 
the skills gap we have right now. It 
will cover programs that, at a min-
imum, require 150 hours and 8 weeks to 
complete. Alternative proposals se-
verely limit the programs by requiring 
them to have too many hours, 320 
hours. Ohio community colleges have 
told me none of their short-term train-
ing programs would qualify under that 
higher number of hour requirement. 
Programs like welding, precision ma-
chining, and electrical trades—we need 
the JOBS Act now. As we work to get 
our economy back up to speed, passing 
the JOBS Act is a top priority for Sen-
ator KAINE, for myself, and for other 
Members on both sides of the aisle. 
Let’s be sure that we work together 
to get this legislations across the fin-
ish line. It just makes too much sense. 
It is going to help tens of thousands of 
people have better opportunities. It is 
going to help our economy fill the crit-
ical jobs it needs to recover. 
We need to seize this opportunity, 
seize it now, get this economy back on 
track, and ensure Ohioans and all 
Americans have this opportunity to de-
velop the skills to grow in the career of 
their choice and fulfill their potential 
in life. 
I yield back.

fore the Committee shall be heard in public 
session, except as provided in Rule 2.1. 
5.4. No confirmation hearing shall be held 
sooner than seven calendar days after receipt 
of the background questionnaire and finan-
cial disclosure statement unless the time 
limit is waived by a majority vote of the 
Committee. 
5.5. The Committee vote on the confirma-
tion shall not be sooner than 48 hours after 
the Committee has received transcripts of 
the confirmation hearing unless the time 
limit is waived by unanimous consent of the 
Committee. 
5.6. No nomination shall be reported to the 
Senate unless the nominee has filed a re-
sponse to the Committee’s background ques-
tionnaire and financial disclosure statement 
with the Committee. 
RULE 6. INVESTIGATIONS 
No investigation shall be initiated by the 
Committee unless at least five members of 
the Committee have specifically requested 
the Chairman or the Vice Chairman to au-
thorize such an investigation. Authorized in-
vestigations may be conducted by members 
of the Committee and/or designated Com-
mittee staff members. 
RULE 7. SUBPOENAS 
Subpoenas authorized by the Committee 
for the attendance of witnesses or the pro-
duction of memoranda, documents, records, 
or any other material may be issued by the 
Chairman, the Vice Chairman, or any mem-
ber of the Committee designated by the 
Chairman, and may be served by any person 
designated by the Chairman, Vice Chairman 
or member issuing the subpoenas. Each sub-
poena shall have attached thereto a copy of 
S. Res. 400 of the 94th Congress, and a copy 
of these rules. 
RULE 8. PROCEDURES RELATED TO THE TAKING 
OF TESTIMONY 
8.1. Notice.—Witnesses required to appear 
before the Committee shall be given reason-
able notice and all witnesses shall be fur-
nished a copy of these Rules. 
8.2. Oath or Affirmation.—At the direction 
of the Chairman or Vice Chairman, testi-
mony of witnesses may be given under oath 
or affirmation which may be administered 
by any member of the Committee. 
8.3. Questioning.—Committee questioning 
of witnesses shall be conducted by members 
of the Committee and such Committee staff 
as are authorized by the Chairman, Vice 
Chairman, or the presiding member. 
8.4. Counsel for the Witness.—(a) Gen-
erally. Any witness may be accompanied by 
counsel, subject to the requirement of para-
graph (b). 
(b) Counsel Clearances Required. In the 
event that a meeting of the Committee has 
been closed because the subject matter was 
classified in nature, counsel accompanying a 
witness before the Committee must possess 
the requisite security clearance and provide 
proof of such clearance to the Committee at 
least 24 hours prior to the meeting at which 
the counsel intends to be present. A witness 
who is unable to obtain counsel may inform 
the Committee of such fact. If the witness 
informs the Committee of this fact at least 
24 hours prior to his or her appearance before 
the Committee, the Committee shall then 
endeavor to obtain voluntary counsel for the 
witness. Failure to obtain such counsel will 
not excuse the witness from appearing and 
testifying. 
(c) Conduct of Counsel for the Witness. 
Counsel for witnesses appearing before the 
Committee shall conduct themselves in an 
ethical and professional manner at all times 
in their dealings with the Committee. Fail-
ure to do so shall, upon a finding to that ef-
fect by a majority of the members present, 
subject such counsel to disciplinary action 
which may include warning, censure, re-
moval, or a recommendation of contempt 
proceedings. 
(d) Role of Counsel for Witness. There shall 
be no direct or cross-examination by counsel 
for the witness. However, counsel for the 
witness may submit any question in writing 
to the Committee and request the Com-
mittee to propound such question to the 
counsel’s client or to any other witness. The 
counsel for the witness also may suggest the 
presentation of other evidence or the calling 
of other witnesses. The Committee may use 
or dispose of such questions or suggestions 
as it deems appropriate. 
8.5. Statements by Witnesses.—Witnesses 
may make brief and relevant statements at 
the beginning and conclusion of their testi-
mony. Such statements shall not exceed a 
reasonable period of time as determined by 
the Chairman, or other presiding members. 
Any witness required or desiring to make a 
prepared or written statement for the record 
of the proceedings shall file a paper and elec-
tronic copy with the Clerk of the Committee, 
and insofar as practicable and consistent 
with the notice given, shall do so at least 48 
hours in advance of his or her appearance be-
fore the Committee, unless the Chairman 
and Vice Chairman determine there is good 
cause for noncompliance with the 48 hours 
requirement. 
8.6. Objections and Rulings.—Any objection 
raised by a witness or counsel shall be ruled 
upon by the Chairman or other presiding 
member, and such ruling shall be the ruling 
of the Committee unless a majority of the 
Committee present overrules the ruling of 
the chair. 
8.7. Inspection and Correction.—All wit-
nesses testifying before the Committee shall 
be given a reasonable opportunity to inspect, 
in the office of the Committee, the tran-
script of their testimony to determine 
whether such testimony was correctly tran-
scribed. The witness may be accompanied by 
counsel. Any corrections the witness desires 
to make in the transcript shall be submitted 
in writing to the Committee within five days 
from the date when the transcript was made 
available to the witness. Corrections shall be 
limited to grammar and minor editing, and 
may not be made to change the substance of 
the testimony. Any questions arising with 
respect to such corrections shall be decided 
by the Chairman. Upon request, the Com-
mittee may provide to a witness those parts 
of testimony given by that witness in execu-
tive session which are subsequently quoted 
or made part of a public record, at the ex-
pense of the witness. 
8.8. Requests To Testify.—The Committee 
will consider requests to testify on any mat-
ter or measure pending before the Com-
mittee. A person who believes that testi-
mony or other evidence presented at a public 
hearing, or any comment made by a Com-
mittee member or a member of the Com-
mittee staff, may tend to affect adversely 
that person’s reputation, may request in 
writing to appear personally before the Com-
mittee to testify or may file a sworn state-
ment of facts relevant to the testimony, evi-
dence, or comment, or may submit to the 
Chairman proposed questions in writing for 
the questioning of other witnesses. The Com-
mittee shall take such action as it deems ap-
propriate. 
8.9. 
Contempt 
Procedures.—No

sion of the Committee may only be author-
ized in accordance with Section 8 of S. Res.

10.5. The members of the Committee staff 
shall not discuss either the substance or pro-
cedure of the work of the Committee with 
any person not a member of the Committee

gress, and to abide by the Committee’s code 
of conduct. 
10.7. As a precondition for employment on 
the Committee, each member of the Com-
mittee staff must agree in writing to notify 
the Committee of any request for testimony, 
either during service as a member of the 
Committee staff or at any time thereafter 
with respect to information obtained by vir-
tue of employment as a member of the Com-
mittee staff. Such information shall not be 
disclosed in response to such requests, except 
as directed by the Committee in accordance 
with Section 8 of S. Res. 400 of the 94th Con-
gress and the provisions of these rules or, in 
the event of the termination of the Com-
mittee, in such manner as may be deter-
mined by the Senate. 
10.8. The Committee shall immediately 
consider action to be taken in the case of 
any member of the Committee staff who fails 
to conform to any of these Rules. Such dis-
ciplinary action may include, but shall not 
be limited to, revocation of the Committee

icy by any member of the Committee staff 
shall be grounds for termination of employ-
ment. Further, any illegal use of controlled 
substances by a member of the Committee 
staff, within the workplace or otherwise, 
shall result in reconsideration of the secu-
rity clearance of any such staff member and 
may constitute grounds for termination of 
employment with the Committee. 
10.11. All personnel actions affecting the 
staff of the Committee shall be made free 
from any discrimination based on race, 
color, religion, sex, national origin, age, 
handicap, or disability.

the Senate to determine whether there is 
substantial credible evidence which provides 
substantial cause for the Select Committee 
to conclude that a violation within the juris-
diction of the Select Committee has oc-
curred; and 
(3) the term ‘‘adjudicatory review’’ means 
a proceeding undertaken by the Select Com-
mittee after a finding, on the basis of a pre-
liminary inquiry, that there is substantial 
credible evidence which provides substantial 
cause for the Select Committee to conclude 
that a violation within the jurisdiction of 
the Select Committee has occurred. 
(c) (1) No— 
(A) adjudicatory review of conduct of a 
Member or officer of the Senate may be con-
ducted; 
(B) report, resolution, or recommendation 
relating to such an adjudicatory review of 
conduct may be made; and 
(C) letter of admonition pursuant to sub-
section (d)(3) may be issued, unless approved 
by the affirmative recorded vote of no fewer 
than 4 members of the Select Committee.

(d)(1) When the Select Committee receives 
a sworn complaint or other allegation or in-
formation about a Member, officer, or em-
ployee of the Senate, it shall promptly con-
duct a preliminary inquiry into matters 
raised by that complaint, allegation, or in-
formation. The preliminary inquiry shall be 
of duration and scope necessary to determine 
whether there is substantial credible evi-
dence which provides substantial cause for 
the Select Committee to conclude that a vio-

Committee has occurred. The Select Com-
mittee may delegate to the chairman and 
vice chairman the discretion to determine 
the appropriate duration, scope, and conduct

chairman and vice chairman the authority, 
on behalf of the Select Committee, to dis-
miss any matter that they determine, after a 
preliminary inquiry, lacks substantial merit. 
The Select Committee shall inform the indi-
vidual who provided to the Select Committee 
the complaint, allegation, or information, 
and the individual who is the subject of the 
complaint, allegation, or information, of the 
dismissal, together with an explanation of 
the basis for the dismissal. 
(3) If as a result of a preliminary inquiry 
under paragraph (1), the Select Committee 
determines that a violation is in advertent, 
technical, or other wise of a de minim is na-
ture, the Select Committee may dispose of 
the matter by issuing a public or private let-
ter of admonition, which shall not be consid-

(2) All testimony and action relating to a 
complaint or allegation shall be kept secret 
and shall not be released by the Committee 
to any individual or group, whether govern-
mental or private, except the respondent, 
without the approval of a majority of the 
Committee, until such time as a report to

mittee Sensitive and Classified Materials.)

member of the Committee shall be given a 
reasonable opportunity to have separate

(k) INELIGIBILITY OR DISQUALIFICA-
TION OF MEMBERS AND STAFF:

review relating to (i) the conduct of (I) such 
member; (II) any officer or employee the 
member supervises; or (ii) any complaint 
filed by the member; and 
(B) the determinations and recommenda-
tions of the Committee with respect to any 
preliminary inquiry or adjudicatory review 
described in subparagraph (A). 
For purposes of this paragraph, a member 
of the committee and an officer of the Sen-
ate shall be deemed to supervise any officer 
or employee consistent with the provision of 
paragraph 12 of Rule XXXVII of the Standing 
Rules of the Senate. 
(2) In any Committee proceeding appears 
to relate to a member of the Committee in a 
manner described in subparagraph (1) of this 
paragraph, the staff shall prepare a report to 
the Chairman and Vice Chairman. If either 
the Chairman or the Vice Chairman con-
cludes from the report that it appears that 
the member may be ineligible, the member 
shall be notified in writing of the nature of 
the particular proceeding and the reason 
that it appears that the member may be in-
eligible to participate in it. If the member 
agrees that he or she is ineligible, the mem-
ber shall so notify the Chairman or Vice 
Chairman. If the member believes that he or 
she is not ineligible, he or she may explain 
the reasons to the Chairman and Vice Chair-
man, and if they both agree that the member 
is not ineligible, the member shall continue 
to serve. But if either the Chairman or Vice 
Chairman continues to believe that the 
member is ineligible, while the member be-
lieves that he or she is not ineligible, the 
matter shall be promptly referred to the 
Committee. The member shall present his or 
her arguments to the Committee in execu-
tive session. Any contested questions con-
cerning a member’s eligibility shall be de-
cided by a majority vote of the Committee, 
meeting in executive session, with the mem-
ber in question not participating. 
(3) A member of the Committee may, at 
the discretion of the member, disqualify 
himself or herself from participating in any 
preliminary inquiry or adjudicatory review 
pending before the Committee and the deter-
minations and recommendations of the Com-
mittee with respect to any such preliminary 
inquiry or adjudicatory review. 
(4) Whenever any member of the Com-
mittee is ineligible under paragraph (1) to 
participate in any preliminary inquiry or ad-
judicatory review, or disqualifies himself or 
herself under paragraph (3) from partici-
pating in any preliminary inquiry or adju-
dicatory review, another Senator shall be ap-
pointed by the Senate to serve as a member 
of the Committee solely for purposes of such 
preliminary inquiry or adjudicatory review 
and the determinations and recommenda-
tions of the Committee with respect to such 
preliminary inquiry or adjudicatory review. 
Any member of the Senate appointed for 
such purposes shall be of the same party as 
the member who is ineligible or disqualifies 
himself or herself. 
(5) The President of the Senate shall be 
given written notice of the ineligibility or 
disqualification of any member from any 
preliminary inquiry, adjudicatory review, or 
other proceeding requiring the appointment 
of another member in accordance with sub-
paragraph (k)(4).

mittee proceeding that the staff director or

lated thereto concerning a Member or officer 
of the Senate. In any such case an absent 
member’s vote may be announced solely for 
the purpose of recording the member’s posi-
tion and such announced votes shall not be 
counted for or against the motion. 
(2) On matters other than matters listed in

(4) supply all documents in the possession

or in support of his or her allegations as an

RULE 3: PROCEDURES FOR CONDUCTING 
A PRELIMINARY INQUIRY 
(a) DEFINITION OF PRELIMINARY IN-
QUIRY: A ‘‘preliminary inquiry’’ is a pro-
ceeding undertaken by the Committee fol-
lowing the receipt of a complaint or allega-
tion of, or information about, misconduct by 
a Member, officer, or employee of the Senate 
to determine whether there is substantial 
credible evidence which provides substantial 
cause for the Committee to conclude that a 
violation within the jurisdiction of the Com-
mittee has occurred. 
(b) BASIS FOR PRELIMINARY INQUIRY: 
The Committee shall promptly commence a 
preliminary inquiry whenever it has received 
a sworn complaint, or other allegation of, or 
information about, alleged misconduct or 
violations pursuant to Rule 2. 
(c) SCOPE OF PRELIMINARY INQUIRY: 
(1) The preliminary inquiry shall be of such 
duration and scope as is necessary to deter-
mine whether there is substantial credible 
evidence which provides substantial cause 
for the Committee to conclude that a viola-
tion within the jurisdiction of the Com-
mittee has occurred. The Chairman and Vice 
Chairman, acting jointly, on behalf of the 
Committee may supervise and determine the 
appropriate duration, scope, and conduct of a 
preliminary inquiry. Whether a preliminary 
inquiry is conducted jointly by the Chairman 
and Vice Chairman or by the Committee as 
a whole, the day to day supervision of a pre-
liminary inquiry rests with the Chairman 
and Vice Chairman, acting jointly. 
(2) A preliminary inquiry may include any 
inquiries, 
interviews, 
sworn 
statements, 
depositions, or subpoenas deemed appro-
priate to obtain information upon which to 
make any determination provided for by this 
Rule. 
(d) OPPORTUNITY FOR RESPONSE: A 
preliminary inquiry may include an oppor-
tunity for any known respondent or his or 
her designated representative to present ei-
ther a written or oral statement, or to re-
spond orally to questions from the Com-
mittee. Such an oral statement or answers 
shall be transcribed and signed by the person 
providing the statement or answers. 
(e) STATUS REPORTS: The Committee 
staff or outside counsel shall periodically re-
port to the Committee in the form and ac-
cording to the schedule prescribed by the 
Committee. The reports shall be confiden-
tial. 
(f) FINAL REPORT: When the preliminary 
inquiry is completed, the staff or outside 
counsel shall make a confidential report, 
oral or written, to the Committee on find-
ings and recommendations, as appropriate. 
(g) COMMITTEE ACTION: As soon as prac-
ticable following submission of the report on 
the preliminary inquiry, the Committee 
shall determine by a recorded vote whether 
there is substantial credible evidence which 
provides substantial cause for the Com-
mittee to conclude that a violation within 
the jurisdiction of the Committee has oc-
curred. The Committee may make any of the 
following determinations: 
(1) The Committee may determine that 
there is not such substantial credible evi-
dence and, in such case, the Committee shall 
dismiss the matter. The Committee, or 
Chairman and Vice Chairman acting jointly 
on behalf of the Committee, may dismiss any 
matter which, after a preliminary inquiry, is 
determined to lack substantial merit. The 
Committee shall inform the complainant of 
the dismissal. 
(2) The Committee may determine that 
there is such substantial credible evidence, 
but that the alleged violation is inadvertent, 
technical, or otherwise of a de minimis na-
ture. In such case, the Committee may dis-
pose of the matter by issuing a public or pri-
vate letter of admonition, which shall not be 
considered discipline and which shall not be 
subject to appeal to the Senate. The issuance 
of a letter of admonition must be approved 
by the affirmative recorded vote of no fewer 
than four members of the Committee voting. 
(3) The Committee may determine that 
there is such substantial credible evidence 
and that the matter cannot be appropriately 
disposed of under paragraph (2). In such case, 
the Committee shall promptly initiate an 
adjudicatory review in accordance with Rule 
4. No adjudicatory review of conduct of a 
Member, officer, or employee of the Senate 
may be initiated except by the affirmative 
recorded vote of not less than four members 
of the Committee. 
RULE 4: PROCEDURES FOR CONDUCTING 
AN ADJUDICATORY REVIEW 
(a) DEFINITION OF ADJUDICATORY RE-
VIEW: An ‘‘adjudicatory review’’ is a pro-
ceeding undertaken by the Committee after 
a finding, on the basis of a preliminary in-
quiry, that there is substantial cause for the 
Committee to conclude that a violation 
within the jurisdiction of the Committee has 
occurred. 
(b) SCOPE OF ADJUDICATORY REVIEW: 
When the Committee decides to conduct an 
adjudicatory review, it shall be of such dura-
tion and scope as is necessary for the Com-
mittee to determine whether a violation 
within its jurisdiction has occurred. An adju-
dicatory review shall be conducted by out-
side counsel as authorized by section 3(b)(1) 
of Senate Resolution 338 unless the Com-
mittee determines not to use outside coun-
sel. In the course of the adjudicatory review,

designated outside counsel, or if the Com-
mittee determines not to use outside coun-
sel, the Committee or its staff, may conduct 
any inquiries or interviews, take sworn 
statements, use compulsory process as de-
scribed in Rule 6, or take any other actions 
that the Committee deems appropriate to se-
cure the evidence necessary to make a deter-
mination. 
(c) NOTICE TO RESPONDENT: The Com-
mittee shall give written notice to any 
known respondent who is the subject of an 
adjudicatory review. The notice shall be sent 
to the respondent no later than five working 
days after the Committee has voted to con-
duct an adjudicatory review. The notice 
shall include a statement of the nature of 
the possible violation, and description of the 
evidence indicating that a possible violation 
occurred. The Committee may offer the re-
spondent an opportunity to present a state-
ment, orally or in writing, or to respond to 
questions from members of the Committee, 
the Committee staff, or outside counsel. 
(d) RIGHT TO A HEARING: The Com-
mittee shall accord a respondent an oppor-
tunity for a hearing before it recommends 
disciplinary action against that respondent 
to the Senate or before it imposes an order of 
restitution or reprimand (not requiring dis-
cipline by the full Senate). 
(e) 
PROGRESS 
REPORTS 
TO 
COM-
MITTEE: The Committee staff or outside 
counsel shall periodically report to the Com-
mittee concerning the progress of the adju-
dicatory review. Such reports shall be deliv-
ered to the Committee in the form and ac-
cording to the schedule prescribed by the 
Committee, and shall be confidential. 
(f) FINAL REPORT OF ADJUDICATORY 
REVIEW TO COMMITTEE: Upon completion 
of an adjudicatory review, including any 
hearings held pursuant to Rule 5, the outside 
counsel or the staff shall submit a confiden-
tial written report to the Committee, which 
shall detail the factual findings of the adju-
dicatory review and which may recommend 
disciplinary action, if appropriate. Findings 
of fact of the adjudicatory review shall be de-
tailed in this report whether or not discipli-
nary action is recommended. 
(g) COMMITTEE ACTION: 
(1) As soon as practicable following sub-
mission of the report of the staff or outside 
counsel on the adjudicatory review, the Com-
mittee shall prepare and submit a report to 
the Senate, including a recommendation or 
proposed resolution to the Senate concerning 
disciplinary action, if appropriate. A report 
shall be issued, stating in detail the Commit-
tee’s findings of fact, whether or not discipli-
nary action is recommended. The report 
shall also explain fully the reasons under-
lying the Committee’s recommendation con-
cerning disciplinary action, if any. No adju-
dicatory review of conduct of a Member, offi-
cer or employee of the Senate may be con-
ducted, or report or resolution or rec-
ommendation relating to such an adjudica-
tory review of conduct may be made, except 
by the affirmative recorded vote of not less 
than four members of the Committee. 
(2) Pursuant to S. Res. 338, as amended, 
section 2(a), subsections (2), (3), and (4), after 
receipt of the report prescribed by paragraph 
(f) of this rule, the Committee may make 
any of the following recommendations for 
disciplinary action or issue an order for rep-
rimand or restitution, as follows: 
(i) In the case of a Member, a recommenda-
tion to the Senate for expulsion, censure, 
payment of restitution, recommendation to 
a Member’s party conference regarding the 
Member’s seniority or positions of responsi-
bility, or a combination of these; 
(ii) In the case of an officer or employee, a 
recommendation to the Senate of dismissal, 
suspension, payment of restitution, or a 
combination of these; 
(iii) In the case where the Committee de-
termines, after according to the Member, of-
ficer, or employee due notice and oppor-
tunity for a hearing, that misconduct oc-
curred warranting discipline less serious 
than discipline by the full Senate, and sub-
ject to the provisions of paragraph (h) of this 
rule relating to appeal, by a unanimous vote 
of six members order that a Member, officer 
or employee be reprimanded or pay restitu-
tion or both; 
(iv) In the case where the Committee de-
termines that misconduct is inadvertent, 
technical, or otherwise of a de minimis na-
ture, issue a public or private letter of admo-
nition to a Member, officer or employee, 
which shall not be subject to appeal to the 
Senate. 
(3) In the case where the Committee deter-
mines, upon consideration of all the evi-
dence, that the facts do not warrant a find-
ing that there is substantial credible evi-
dence which provides substantial cause for

within the jurisdiction of the Committee has 
occurred, the Committee may dismiss the 
matter.

the Committee shall provide the following 
information and documents to the respond-
ent, if any: 
(i) a list of proposed witnesses to be called 
at the hearing; 
(ii) copies of all documents expected to be 
introduced as exhibits at the hearing; and 
(iii) a brief statement as to the nature of 
the testimony expected to be given by each 
witness to be called at the hearing. 
(B) At least two working days prior to the 
commencement of an adjudicatory hearing, 
the respondent, if any, shall provide the in-
formation and documents described in divi-
sions (i), (ii) and (iii) of subparagraph (A) to 
the Committee. 
(C) At the discretion of the Committee, the 
information and documents to be exchanged 
under this paragraph shall be subject to an 
appropriate agreement limiting access and 
disclosure. 
(D) If a respondent refuses to provide the 
information and documents to the Com-
mittee (see (A) and (B) of this subparagraph), 
or if a respondent or other individual vio-
lates an agreement limiting access and dis-
closure, the Committee, by majority vote, 
may recommend to the Senate that the of-
fender be cited for contempt of Congress. 
(3) SWEARING OF WITNESSES: All wit-
nesses who testify at adjudicatory hearings 
shall be sworn unless the Presiding Officer, 
for good cause, decides that a witness does 
not have to be sworn. 
(4) RIGHT TO COUNSEL: Any witness at 
an adjudicatory hearing may be accom-
panied by counsel of his or her own choosing, 
who shall be permitted to advise the witness 
of his or her legal rights during the testi-
mony. 
(5) RIGHT TO CROSS-EXAMINE AND 
CALL WITNESSES: 
(A) In adjudicatory hearings, any respond-
ent and any other person who obtains the 
permission of the Committee, may person-
ally or through counsel cross-examine wit-

witnesses in his or her own behalf. 
(B) A respondent may apply to the Com-
mittee for the issuance of subpoenas for the 
appearance of witnesses or the production of 
documents on his or her behalf. An applica-
tion shall be approved upon a concise show-
ing by the respondent that the proposed tes-
timony or evidence is relevant and appro-
priate, as determined by the Chairman and 
Vice Chairman. 
(C) With respect to witnesses called by a 
respondent, or other individual given permis-
sion by the Committee, each such witness 
shall first be examined by the party who 
called the witness or by that party’s counsel. 
(D) At least one working day before a 
witness’s scheduled appearance, a witness or 
a witness’s counsel may submit to the Com-
mittee written questions proposed to be 
asked of that witness. If the Committee de-
termines that it is necessary, such questions 
may be asked by any member of the Com-
mittee, or by any Committee staff member if 
directed by a Committee member. The wit-
ness or witness’s counsel may also submit 
additional sworn testimony for the record 
within twenty-four hours after the last day 
that the witness has testified. The insertion 
of such testimony in that day’s record is sub-
ject to the approval of the Chairman and 
Vice Chairman acting jointly within five 
days after the testimony is received. 
(6) ADMISSIBILITY OF EVIDENCE: 
(A) The object of the hearing shall be to as-
certain the truth. Any evidence that may be 
relevant and probative shall be admissible 
unless privileged under the Federal Rules of 
Evidence. Rules of evidence shall not be ap-
plied strictly, but the Presiding Officer shall 
exclude irrelevant or unduly repetitious tes-
timony. Objections going only to the weight 
that should be given evidence will not justify 
its exclusion. 
(B) The Presiding Officer shall rule upon 
any question of the admissibility of testi-
mony or other evidence presented to the 
Committee. Such rulings shall be final un-
less reversed or modified by a recorded vote

mittee before the recess of that day’s hear-
ings.

the Committee shall be guided by the stand-
ards and procedures of Rule 412 of the Fed-
eral Rules of Evidence, except that the Com-
mittee may admit evidence subject to the 
provisions of this paragraph only upon a de-
termination of not less than four members of 
the full Committee that the interests of jus-
tice require that such evidence be admitted. 
(7) SUPPLEMENTARY HEARING PROCE-
DURES: The Committee may adopt any ad-
ditional special hearing procedures that it 
deems necessary or appropriate to a par-
ticular adjudicatory hearing. Copies of such 
supplementary procedures shall be furnished 
to witnesses and respondents, and shall be 
made available upon request to any member 
of the public. 
(k) TRANSCRIPTS: 
(1) An accurate stenographic or recorded 
transcript shall be made of all public and ex-
ecutive hearings. Any member of the Com-
mittee, Committee staff member, outside 
counsel retained by the Committee, or wit-
ness may examine a copy of the transcript 
retained by the Committee of his or her own 
remarks and may suggest to the official re-
porter any typographical or transcription er-
rors. If the reporter declines to make the re-
quested corrections, the member, staff mem-
ber, outside counsel or witness may request 
a ruling by the Chairman and Vice Chair-
man, acting jointly. Any member or witness 
shall return the transcript with suggested 
corrections to the Committee offices within 
five working days after receipt of the tran-
script, or as soon thereafter as is practicable. 
If the testimony was given in executive ses-
sion, the member or witness may only in-
spect the transcript at a location determined 
by the Chairman and Vice Chairman, acting 
jointly. Any questions arising with respect 
to the processing and correction of tran-
scripts shall be decided by the Chairman and 
Vice Chairman, acting jointly. 
(2) Except for the record of a hearing which 
is closed to the public, each transcript shall 
be printed as soon as is practicable after re-
ceipt of the corrected version. The Chairman 
and Vice Chairman, acting jointly, may 
order the transcript of a hearing to be print-
ed without the corrections of a member or 
witness if they determine that such member 
or witness has been afforded a reasonable 
time to correct such transcript and such 
transcript has not been returned within such 
time. 
(3) The Committee shall furnish each wit-
ness, at no cost, one transcript copy of that 
witness’s testimony given at a public hear-
ing. If the testimony was given in executive 
session, then a transcript copy shall be pro-
vided upon request, subject to appropriate 
conditions and restrictions prescribed by the 
Chairman and Vice Chairman. If any indi-
vidual violates such conditions and restric-
tions, the Committee may recommend by 
majority vote that he or she be cited for con-
tempt of Congress.

mony taken and documents produced shall 
be deemed for the purpose of these rules to 
have been received in a closed or executive 
session of the Committee. The Committee 
shall not initiate procedures leading to 
criminal or civil enforcement proceedings for 
a witness’s failure to appear, or to testify, or

notice was accompanied by a subpoena au-
thorized for issuance by the Committee, or

nesses may be accompanied at a deposition

administered by an individual authorized by 
law to administer oaths, or administered by 
any member of the Committee if one is 
present. Questions maybe propounded by any 
person or persons who are authorized to take 
depositions for the Committee. If a witness 
objects to a question and refuses to testify, 
or refuses to produce a document, any mem-
ber of the Committee who is present may 
rule on the objection and, if the objection is 
overruled, direct the witness to answer the 
question or produce the document. If no

Chairman and Vice Chairman, acting jointly, 
to take the deposition may proceed with the 
deposition, or may, at that time or at a sub-
sequent time, seek a ruling by telephone or 
otherwise on the objection from the Chair-
man or Vice Chairman of the Committee, 
who may refer the matter to the Committee 
or rule on the objection. If the Chairman or 
Vice Chairman, or the Committee upon re-
ferral, overrules the objection, the Chair-
man, Vice Chairman, or the Committee as 
the case may be, may direct the witness to 
answer the question or produce the docu-

cedures leading to civil or criminal enforce-
ment unless the witness refuses to testify or 
produce documents after having been di-
rected to do so.

and the transcriber shall certify that the 
transcript is a true record of the testimony. 
The transcript with these certifications shall 
be filed with the chief clerk of the Com-
mittee, and the witness shall be furnished 
with access to a copy at the Committee’s of-
fices for review. Upon inspecting the tran-
script, within a time limit set by the Chair-
man and Vice Chairman, acting jointly, a 
witness may request in writing changes in 
the transcript to correct errors in tran-
scription. The witness may also bring to the 
attention of the Committee errors of fact in 
the witness’s testimony by submitting a 
sworn statement about those facts with a re-
quest that it be attached to the transcript. 
The Chairman and Vice Chairman, acting 
jointly, may rule on the witness’s request, 
and the changes or attachments allowed 
shall be certified by the Committee’s chief 
clerk. If the witness fails to make any re-
quest under this paragraph within the time 
limit set, this fact shall be noted by the 
Committee’s chief clerk. Any person author-
ized by the Committee may stipulate with 
the witness to changes in this procedure.

CONFIRMATION OF MERRICK 
BRIAN GARLAND 
Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, I voted 
against the nomination of Merrick 
Garland to be Attorney General be-
cause 
President 
Biden’s 
campaign 
promises included permitting the De-
partment of Justice to take unilateral 
and unconstitutional actions to in-
fringe upon Second Amendment rights. 
Gun control advocacy groups applaud 
these promises and encourage even 
more executive actions to erode the 
right to keep and bear firearms. Absent 
an explicit promise from Judge Gar-
land to respect the Second Amend-
ment, my oath to defend the Constitu-
tion prevented me from voting to con-
firm him as Attorney General. 
CONFIRMATION OF DEBRA ANNE 
HAALAND 
Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Mr. President, we 
urgently need a qualified and effective 
leader ready to protect our natural re-
sources, conserve public lands, and col-
laborate with our Tribal nations. Presi-
dent Biden’s nominee to lead the De-
partment of the Interior is just the per-
son for the job, Congresswoman Debra 
Haaland. She will quickly restore con-
fidence in the Department and reaffirm 
its mission to manage and conserve our 
public land and do its part to confront 
climate change. 
Congresswoman Haaland would be 
the first Native American Cabinet Sec-
retary, and she is no stranger to break-
ing barriers. Haaland was one of the 
first two Native women elected to Con-
gress in 2018. Prior to her congressional 
tenure, Haaland was the first Chair-
woman elected to the Laguna Develop-
ment Corporation Board of Directors 
and the first Native woman elected to 
lead a State party, as chairwoman of 
the New Mexico Democratic Party. She 
brought her progressive values of sus-
tainability and environmental protec-
tion to each of her positions, and I be-
lieve she will do the same for the De-
partment of the Interior. 
During her tenure as vice chair of the 
House 
Committee 
on 
Natural 
Re-
sources, Haaland led legislative efforts, 
like the ANTIQUITIES Act and the 
30x30 Resolution, to protect and con-
serve our national monuments, public 
lands, and oceans. Additionally, the 
Congresswoman has prioritized envi-
ronmental justice and Tribal inclusion 
throughout her career. She introduced

the Environmental Justice in Rec-
reational Permitting Act to increase 
access to public lands for all commu-
nities and fight environmental injus-
tice. Given the Department’s history of 
failing to engage with indigenous com-
munities while enacting harmful public 
lands policies, Haaland will bring a new 
era of equity and inclusion to the De-
partment of the Interior. 
Last Congress, I worked to enact the 
Chesapeake WILD Act, which author-
izes up to $15 million annually for a 
new grant program managed by the 
U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to do 
fish and wildlife habitat restoration in 
the Chesapeake Bay watershed. I look 
forward to working with Haaland to 
see that this program is fully funded 
and well implemented. 
The Department of the Interior man-
ages over 500 million acres of public 
land, and Haaland’s record shows she is 
prepared to take on this role. For these 
reasons, I support Debra Haaland’s 
nomination for Secretary of the Inte-
rior.

AMERICAN RESCUE PLAN ACT OF 
2021—BUDGETARY REVISIONS 
Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, sec-
tion 3001 of S. Con. Res. 5, the fiscal 
year 2021 congressional budget resolu-
tion, allows the chairman of the Senate 
Budget Committee to revise the alloca-
tions, aggregates, and levels in the 
budget resolution for legislation con-
sidered under the resolution’s rec-
onciliation instructions. 
I find that Senate Amendment No. 
1378 fulfills the conditions found in sec-
tion 3001 of S. Con. Res. 5. Accordingly, 
I am revising the allocations for the 
reconciled committees and other en-
forceable budgetary levels to account 
for the budgetary effects of the amend-
ment. 
I ask unanimous consent that the ac-
companying tables, which provide de-
tails about the adjustments, be printed 
in the RECORD. 
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the 
RECORD, as follows:

BUDGETARY REVISIONS 
Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, sec-
tion 3001 of S. Con. Res. 5, the fiscal 
year 2021 congressional budget resolu-
tion, allows the chairman of the Senate 
Budget Committee to revise the alloca-
tions, aggregates, and levels in the 
budget resolution for legislation con-
sidered under the resolution’s rec-
onciliation instructions. 
I find that H.R. 1319, the American 
Rescue Plan Act of 2021, as passed by 
the Senate, meets the conditions found 
in section 3001 of S. Con. Res. 5. Ac-
cordingly, I am revising the allocations 
for the reconciled committees and 
other enforceable budgetary levels to 
account for the budgetary effects of the 
bill. This adjustment reflects the esti-
mate of the bill provided by the Con-
gressional Budget Office on March 10, 
2021. 
This adjustment supersedes the ad-
justments I previously made for the 
processing of S. Amdts. 891 and 1378 to 
H.R. 1319 on March 5, 2021. 
I ask unanimous consent that the ac-
companying tables, which provide de-
tails about the adjustments, be printed 
in the RECORD. 
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the 
RECORD, as follows:

revenues resulting from H.R. 1319, as passed by the Senate, is $75.517 billion in 2021, $120.218 billion over five years, and $59.912 billion over ten years.

ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS 
RECOGNIZING 
NORTH 
DAKOTA’S 
DELEGATES 
TO 
THE 
SENATE 
YOUTH PROGRAM 
∑ Mr. CRAMER. Mr. President, one of 
the outstanding programs offered in 
the U.S. Senate recognizes the best of 
America’s high school juniors and sen-
iors. Since 1963, the U.S. Senate Youth 
Program has selected two students 
from each State who rank high aca-
demically, excel in leadership and vol-
unteerism, and have a passion for pub-
lic service. They also receive a $10,000 
college scholarship. 
These young delegates have come to 
Washington, DC, every spring for a 
week of education and tours high-
lighting all three branches of govern-
ment. This year’s 59th annual Wash-
ington Week gathering last week was 
conducted in a virtual online format, 
and I know it was a memorable experi-
ence for the 104 student delegates from 
across the Nation who attended. 
As one of the eight Senators serving 
on the Senate Youth Program’s Advi-
sory Committee, I congratulate all who 
were selected to be delegates this year. 
I had the recent opportunity to have an 
online conversation with North Dako-
ta’s two delegates, Athalia Haughton 
and Micah Schlittenhardt. 
Athalia is a junior at Century High 
School in Bismarck and is the local 
chair and State programs director of 
the High School Democrats of America. 
She is an AP Scholar with honor, a stu-
dent council representative, student 
congress member, and is the cofounder 
and president of Student Advocates of 
North Dakota. She was a semifinalist 
in State debate, nationally qualified in 
the Lincoln Douglas debate, is a two- 
time State qualifier in speech, a One 
Act Play State champion, and was a 
member of the first-ever North Dakota 
team to become a World Schools De-
bate national qualifier. She crafts 
blankets for local immigrants, volun-
teers at Heaven’s Helpers soup kitchen, 
and raises money for the Alzheimer’s 
Association. Athalia has prepared tes-
timony advocating for international 
cultural diversity classes in North Da-
kota public schools and is passionate 
about reducing the stigma surrounding 
mental health, especially for students. 
After graduation, Athalia intends to 
attend Howard University to pursue 
political science and law degrees. She 
would like to become a politician and a 
policy writer at either a State or na-
tional level. 
Micah, a senior at Legacy High 
School in Bismarck, is president of the 
North Dakota Association of Student 
Councils. She ranks first in her class of 
320 students, is an AP Scholar, and a 
Presidential Citizenship Award recipi-
ent. She is president of the Legacy 
Concert Choir and a member of the Na-
tional Honor Society and the Bis-
marck-Mandan Student Chamber. She 
is involved in varsity cheerleading, All- 
State Jazz Choir, Central Dakota Chil-
dren’s Choir, and Academic Allstate. 
She has been an advocate for Parkin-
son’s disease and Alzheimer’s aware-
ness and support within her commu-
nity and has partnered with a locally- 
owned bakery to pioneer an annual 
fundraiser to raise money for respite 
care. She has been recognized as the 
2021 Distinguished Young Woman of 
North Dakota and Miss North Dakota’s 
Outstanding Teen 2018. After gradua-
tion, Micah plans to attend the Univer-
sity of Mary in Bismarck to study phi-
losophy. She would like to study 
abroad in Vatican City and eventually 
pursue a career in academia. 
I congratulate both Athalia and 
Micah for this honor and welcome 
them to an alumni group of Senate 
Youth Program delegates, which is 
5,500 individuals strong. Many of them 
have gone on to distinguish themselves 
in every area of public service. I fully 
expect that we will hear much more 
about Athalia and Micah in the future 
as they continue to excel in academic 
and professional arenas throughout 
their lives.∑

STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED 
BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTION 
By Mrs. FEINSTEIN (for herself 
and Mrs. BLACKBURN): 
S. 752. A bill to amend the Internal 
Revenue Code of 1986 to provide for an 
election to expense certain qualified 
sound 
recording 
costs 
otherwise 
chargeable to capital account; to the 
Committee on Finance. 
Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I 
rise to speak in support of the ‘‘Help 
Independent Tracks Succeed (HITS) 
Act,’’ which Senator BLACKBURN and I 
introduced 
today. 
Representatives 
LINDA SANCHEZ (D-CA) and RON ESTES 
(R–KS) have introduced companion leg-
islation in the House of Representa-
tives. 
Since the start of the COVID–19 pan-
demic, I have consistently heard from 
independent musicians and producers 
in California who have lost a large per-
centage of their incomes due to con-
certs, festivals, and other events being 
cancelled. 
With many live performance stages 
and venues across the Nation closed for 
months as a result of the pandemic, 
independent musicians and music mak-
ers such as technicians and creators 
have suffered significant loss of in-
come. 
According to a survey by the Copy-
right Alliance, 88 percent of creators 
have 
lost 
income 
due 
to 
the 
coronavirus pandemic, which is more 
than double the national average. Ap-
proximately half of survey respondents 
had lost 90 percent or more of their in-
come. 
Our bill would provide some relief to 
music 
creators 
by 
allowing 
inde-
pendent musicians, technicians, and 
music producers to deduct the cost of 
producing new musical recordings, put-
ting them on a level playing field with 
other arts productions. 
The U.S. Tax Code allows film, tele-
vision, and theater productions to fully 
deduct production expenses in the year 
they are incurred.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1572 
March 16, 2021 
However, recording artists are not 
given the same treatment, and are 
forced instead to amortize their pro-
duction expenses over a number of 
years. 
The HITS Act would allow qualified 
sound recording producers to deduct 
100% 
of 
recording 
production 
ex-
penses—up to $150,000—in the year they 
are incurred, rather than in later 
years. 
Because this change would simply ac-
celerate a tax deduction that already 
exists, the bill’s expected cost would be 
minimal. 
In addition, because the deduction 
would be capped at $150,000 per produc-
tion, our legislation would benefit 
smaller, independent musicians and 
music producers rather than large com-
panies. 
The coronavirus pandemic has had a 
dramatic impact on music creators 
around the Nation. Our bill would help 
create parity between musical creators 
and other creative producers, stimulate 
the economy, and get music makers 
back to work. 
I hope my colleagues will join me in 
support of this bill. Thank you, Mr. 
President, and I yield the floor. 
By Mr. THUNE (for himself, Ms. 
STABENOW, Mr. PORTMAN, Ms. 
BALDWIN, Mrs. CAPITO, and Mr. 
CARDIN): 
S. 773. A bill to enable certain hos-
pitals that were participating in or ap-
plied for the drug discount program 
under section 340B of the Public Health 
Service Act prior to the COVID–19 pub-
lic health emergency to temporarily 
maintain eligibility for such program, 
and for other purposes; to the Com-
mittee on Health, Education, Labor,

bill be printed in the RECORD. 
There being no objection, the text of

Ms. STABENOW (for herself and Ms.

lution; which was referred to the Com-
mittee on Health, Education, Labor, 
and Pensions: 
S. RES. 115 
Whereas, for decades, social workers have 
dedicated their work to improving human 
well-being and enhancing the basic needs of 
all people, especially the most vulnerable; 
Whereas the theme for Social Work Month 
2021, ‘‘Social Workers Are Essential’’, em-
bodies the heroic contributions social work-
ers have made to the United States, includ-
ing the work social workers have done to 
heal the United States during the COVID–19 
pandemic, racial unrest, economic uncer-
tainty, and political divisiveness; 
Whereas social workers have always been 
present to help in times of crisis, including 
by— 
(1) helping people overcome issues such as 
death and grief; and 
(2) helping people and communities recover 
from natural disasters, including fires, hurri-
canes, and earthquakes; 
Whereas social workers have helped the 
United States live up to its value of equality 
by successfully advocating for equal rights 
for all people, no matter their race, sexual 
identity, gender, gender expression, culture, 
or religion; 
Whereas the social work profession is one 
of the fastest growing professions in the 
United States, with nearly 800,000 people ex-
pected to be employed as social workers by 
2028; 
Whereas social workers work in all parts of 
society to empower people to live to their 
fullest potential; 
Whereas 
school 
social 
workers 
have 
worked with families and schools throughout 
the COVID–19 pandemic to ensure students 
reach their full academic and personal po-
tential; 
Whereas social workers play a crucial role 
in the United States health care system and 
have played a key role in the response of the 
United States to the COVID–19 pandemic, in-
cluding by helping individuals, families, and 
communities cope with the epidemic; 
Whereas, for generations, social workers 
have advocated for positive changes that 
have made the United States a better place 
to live, including by— 
(1) urging policymakers to adopt the min-
imum wage; 
(2) improving workplace safety; and 
(3) enacting social safety net programs 
that help ameliorate hunger, homelessness, 
and poverty; 
Whereas social workers, one of the largest 
groups of mental health care providers in the 
United States, work daily to help people, 
whether in person or remotely, overcome 
substance use disorders and mental illnesses, 
including depression and anxiety; and 
Whereas social workers stand ready to as-
sist the United States in overcoming present 
and future challenges, including by— 
(1) providing sufficient access to mental 
health and social care services; 
(2) ensuring that all individuals in the 
United States can meet their basic human 
needs; and 
(3) advancing racial equity and the dignity

mote further awareness of the life-changing

S. RES. 116 
Whereas April 17, 2021, marks the 60th an-
niversary of the first day of the Bay of Pigs 
operation, an event held dear in the hearts of 
many who long for the return of freedom, de-
mocracy, and justice to Cuba; 
Whereas the Communist dictatorship in 
Cuba that resulted from the January 1, 1959, 
revolution in Cuba has systematically denied 
the Cuban people their most basic human 
rights and fundamental freedoms; 
Whereas, from 1959 until his death in 2016, 
dictator Fidel Castro, who promised to im-
plement a revolution against tyranny, sys-
tematically violated the human rights of the 
Cuban people, curtailed freedom of the press, 
arbitrarily imprisoned and killed an untold 
number of members of the political opposi-
tion in Cuba, and confiscated the properties 
of citizens of Cuba and the United States; 
Whereas the men and women participating 
in the Bay of Pigs operation assumed the 
title of Brigada de Asalto 2506 (Assault Bri-
gade 2506), which was named after the serial 
number (2506) of Carlos Rodriguez Santana, a 
founding member of the brigade who died 
during training exercises in September 1960; 
Whereas Assault Brigade 2506 consisted of 
individuals, primarily Cuban exiles in the 
United States, from diverse backgrounds, in-
cluding doctors, nurses, engineers, archi-
tects, priests, cooks, musicians, actors, busi-
ness owners, barbers, bankers, construction 
workers, office clerks, students, pilots, and 
many other individuals representing dif-
ferent sectors in Cuba; 
Whereas, on April 17, 1961, approximately 
1,400 individuals selflessly volunteered to 
free the Cuban people from tyranny; 
Whereas, in the ensuing days, and in the 
course of a battle against the Cuban mili-
tary, which was superior in manpower and 
firepower, more than 100 men lost their lives; 
Whereas the events of April 17 through 
April 20, 1961, ended with the capture and im-
prisonment of 1,204 members or more than 75 
percent of Assault Brigade 2506; 
Whereas a large number of the 1,204 cap-
tured members of Assault Brigade 2506 were 
imprisoned in deplorable conditions for close 
to 18 months, subjected to harsh and inhu-
mane treatment, and later sentenced with-
out due process to 30 years of imprisonment; 
Whereas, in September 1961, the Cuban re-
gime executed 5 members of Assault Brigade 
2506 who had been captured during the oper-
ation; 
Whereas 67 members of Assault Brigade 
2506 died in combat, including 4 American pi-
lots and 10 Cuban pilots and navigators, 10 
members died while trying to flee Cuba on a 
fishing boat that drifted in the Gulf of Mex-
ico for almost 15 days, 10 members died while 
being transported to prison by their Cuban 
captors inside a sealed truck with limited 
oxygen, 9 members were executed by firing 
squads, and 3 members died while in prison 
due to lack of medical attention; 
Whereas one of the most heinous acts re-
lating to the operation was ordered by then 
Captain Osmany Cienfuegos, who forced 
nearly 100 male prisoners into a closed trail-
er in which they were transported for 8 hours 
with limited oxygen; 
Whereas the Cuban regime is a party to the 
Geneva Conventions of 1949, which require 
the humane treatment of prisoners of war; 
Whereas, in March 1962, as the trial of the 
captured fighters approached, the President 
of the International Committee of the Red 
Cross (ICRC) appealed to Cuban dictator 
Fidel Castro, asking that the provisions of 
Article 3 of the Geneva Convention relative 
to the Treatment of Prisoners of War, done 
at Geneva August 12, 1949, be fully applied, 
and for permission to visit the prisoners, but 
all the requests went unanswered; 
Whereas the 1,113 members of Assault Bri-
gade 2506 who finally returned to the United 
States after the operation have made signifi-
cant and valuable contributions to the 
United States, while never forgetting their 
beloved homeland; 
Whereas, on December 29, 1962, President 
John Fitzgerald Kennedy was presented with 
the banner of Assault Brigade 2506 that had 
reached the shores of Cuba during the oper-
ation, and the President pledged, ‘‘I can as-
sure you that this flag will be returned to 
this brigade in a free Havana.’’; 
Whereas, on April 24, 1986, a joint resolu-
tion (Public Law 99–279; 100 Stat. 398) was ap-
proved ‘‘Commemorating the twenty-fifth 
anniversary of the Bay of Pigs invasion to 
liberate Cuba from Communist tyranny.’’; 
Whereas Cuba’s authoritarian regime con-
tinues to arbitrarily detain thousands of 
critics, activists, and opponents; and 
Whereas the Cuban people continue to 
struggle and demand respect for democratic 
values, civil liberties, freedom, and justice: 
Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) remembers and pays tribute to the 
brave and courageous members of Brigada de 
Asalto 2506 (Assault Brigade 2506), both liv-
ing and deceased; 
(2) calls on the Government of the United 
States to continue to support policies that 
promote the respect for democratic prin-
ciples, civil liberties, freedom, and justice in 
Cuba, in a manner consistent with the aspi-
rations of the Cuban people; 
(3) recognizes that individual members of 
Assault Brigade 2506 later joined the United 
States Armed Forces and fought in the Viet-
nam war; and 
(4) recognizes that many veterans of the 
Bay of Pigs operation settled across the 
United States to become productive mem-
bers of the society of the United States, in-
cluding public officials and industry leaders.

RESOLUTION 
117—EX-
PRESSING 
SUPPORT 
FOR 
THE 
FULL IMPLEMENTATION OF THE 
GOOD FRIDAY AGREEMENT, OR 
THE BELFAST AGREEMENT, AND 
SUBSEQUENT AGREEMENTS AND 
ARRANGEMENTS 
FOR 
IMPLE-
MENTATION TO SUPPORT PEACE 
ON THE ISLAND OF IRELAND 
Mr. MENENDEZ (for himself, Ms. 
COLLINS, Mr. MURPHY, Mr. LEAHY, Mr. 
MARKEY, Mr. COONS, Mr. DURBIN, Mr. 
SCHUMER, Ms. CANTWELL, Mr. CASEY, 
Mr. BOOKER, Mr. KAINE, Mrs. SHAHEEN, 
Mr. CARDIN, and Mr. REED) submitted 
the following resolution; which was re-
ferred to the Committee on Foreign 
Relations: 
S. RES. 117 
Whereas, on April 10, 1998, the Government 
of Ireland and the Government of the United 
Kingdom signed the Good Friday Agreement, 
also known as the ‘‘Belfast Agreement’’; 
Whereas the goals of the Good Friday 
Agreement were to bring a new era of de-
volved government and democracy to North-
ern Ireland, end violence, and ensure peace 
for the people of the island of Ireland; 
Whereas the successful negotiation of the 
Good Friday Agreement stands as a historic 
and groundbreaking success that has proven 
critical to the decades of relative peace that 
have followed; 
Whereas the return to power sharing in 
2020 after the collapse of power-sharing insti-
tutions in 2017 creates new opportunities for 
strengthening peace and reconciliation in 
Northern Ireland; 
Whereas the agreement between the United 
Kingdom and the European Union on the 
withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the 
European Union, and the protocol to that 
agreement on Northern Ireland preserving an 
open border on the island of Ireland (in this 
preamble referred to as the ‘‘Northern Ire-
land Protocol’’), are intended to protect the 
peace forged under the Good Friday Agree-
ment; 
Whereas, despite the historic progress of 
the Good Friday Agreement and subsequent 
agreements, including the Stormont House 
Agreement agreed to in December 2014, im-
portant issues remain unresolved in North-
ern Ireland, including the passage of a Bill of 
Rights, securing justice for all victims of vi-
olence, including state-sponsored violence, 
and reducing sectarian divisions and pro-
moting reconciliation; 
Whereas section 6 of the Good Friday 
Agreement (‘‘Rights, Safeguards and Equal-
ity of Opportunity’’) recognizes ‘‘the impor-
tance of respect, understanding and toler-
ance in relation to linguistic diversity’’ as 
part of ‘‘the cultural wealth of the island of 
Ireland’’ and declares the Government of the 
United Kingdom will seek ways to encourage 
the use of and education in the Irish lan-
guage and provide opportunities for Irish 
language arts; 
Whereas the reintroduction of barriers, 
checkpoints, or personnel on the island of 
Ireland, also known as a ‘‘hard border’’, in-
cluding through the invocation of Article 16 
of the Northern Ireland Protocol, would 
threaten the successes of the Good Friday 
Agreement; 
Whereas the United States Congress played 
a prominent role in support of negotiations 
of the Good Friday Agreement and has taken 
a leading role in promoting peace on the is-
land of Ireland more broadly; and 
Whereas Congress greatly values the close 
relationships the United States shares with 
both the United Kingdom and Ireland and 
stands steadfastly committed to supporting 
the peaceful resolution of any and all polit-
ical challenges in Northern Ireland: Now, 
therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) urges the United Kingdom and the Eu-
ropean Union to support peace on the island 
of Ireland and the principles, objectives, and 
commitments of the Good Friday Agree-
ment, also known as the ‘‘Belfast Agree-
ment’’; 
(2) expresses support for the full implemen-
tation of the Good Friday Agreement and 
subsequent 
agreements, 
including 
the 
Stormont House Agreement agreed to in De-
cember 2014, as well as the protocol on 
Northern Ireland to the agreement on the 
withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the 
European Union (in this resolution referred 
to as the ‘‘Northern Ireland Protocol’’); 
(3) congratulates all parties in Northern 
Ireland for the return in January 2020 to a 
power-sharing agreement; 
(4) urges all parties in Northern Ireland to 
work collectively to ensure the implementa-
tion of all commitments of the Good Friday 
Agreement and subsequent agreements so 
that all of the institutions of the Good Fri-
day Agreement can operate successfully and 
sustainably and that ongoing political chal-
lenges can be overcome; 
(5) calls for continuing attention and ac-
tion to resolve the injustices of past vio-
lence, including state-sponsored violence; 
(6) supports the passage of a Bill of Rights 
for Northern Ireland and the right of all the 
people on the island of Ireland to self-deter-
mine their future as provided for in the Good 
Friday Agreement; 
(7) encourages renewed attention to edu-
cational and cultural efforts that will ensure 
the rich language, literature, and arts of

(8) expresses support for the Northern Ire-
land Protocol and its full implementation, 
which ensures through international agree-
ment that no ‘‘hard border’’ will be reintro-
duced on the island of Ireland; and 
(9) will insist that any new or amended 
trade agreements and other bilateral agree-
ments between the Government of the 
United States and the Government of the 
United Kingdom take into account, as rel-
evant, conditions requiring that obligations 
under the Good Friday Agreement be met.

INTRODUCTION OF THE NATIONAL 
GUARD HOUSING EQUITY ACT 
HON. ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON 
OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, March 16, 2021 
Ms. NORTON. Madam Speaker, today, I in-
troduce the National Guard Housing Equity 
Act, which would codify into law a new Na-
tional Guard Bureau (Bureau) policy on hous-
ing allowances. 
Under federal law, National Guard members 
who are deployed on active duty for 30 days 
or less receive the Basic Allowance for Hous-
ing Reserve Component (BAH-RC). National 
Guard members who are deployed on active 
duty for 31 days or longer receive the Basic 
Allowance for Housing (BAH). BAH-RC is less 
than BAH. This can lead to unfair results. 
For example, when District of Columbia Na-
tional Guard members were deployed to re-
spond to protests in the District last summer, 
they were originally deployed on orders for 
less than 30 days, but ended up serving for 
over 30 consecutive days. However, they only 
received BAH-RC. 
After I raised this issue with the Bureau, the 
Bureau informed me that it would change the 
policy to allow a National Guard member who 
served over 30 consecutive days, no matter 
the length of their initial deployment orders, to 
receive BAH. This bill would codify this new 
policy into law. 
This bill would ensure National Guard mem-
bers receive the full benefits to which they are 
entitled and ensure that they are not short-
changed because of guesswork on how long 
a deployment might last. 
I urge my colleagues to support this bill.

RECOGNIZING JOSEPH A. 
TORMALA 
HON. JACK BERGMAN 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, March 16, 2021 
Mr. BERGMAN. Madam Speaker, it is my 
honor to recognize Joseph A. Tormala, who 
was recently appointed as a National Ameri-
canism Officer for the Military Order of the 
Purple Heart. Through his tireless work ethic 
and devotion to the common good, Joe has 
become an indispensable part of the state of 
Michigan. 
A native Yooper, Joe served honorably in 
the U.S. Marine Corps through seven over-
seas deployments between 1983 and 2004 
during the Cold War, Gulf War, and Liberation 
of Iraq, where he was wounded. His devotion 
to service continued upon his return home to 
Michigan, where he has been active as a 
member and leader of Veterans Service Orga-
nizations, including the Military Order of the 
Purple Heart (MOPH). Formed in 1932, the 
MOPH is composed entirely of men and 
women who have received the Purple Heart 
award while serving in the Armed Forces. 
Their 
Americanism 
Program 
works 
with 
schools, churches, and other organizations to 
promote U.S. history and love for our country. 
In his role as a National Americanism Officer, 
Joe will help carry out this mission—ensuring 
future generations always remember the sac-
rifices made by our men and women in uni-
form. 
Madam Speaker, on behalf of my constitu-
ents, I ask you to join me in recognizing Joe 
Tormala for his appointment as National 
Americanism Officer for the Military Order of 
the Purple Heart. Michiganders can take great 
pride in knowing the First District is home to 
such a selfless leader. On behalf of my con-
stituents, I wish Joe all the best in his future 
endeavors.

HONORING THE LIFE OF DR. 
BADIE IBRAHIM NADDY 
HON. MARK E. GREEN 
OF TENNESSEE 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, March 16, 2021 
Mr. GREEN of Tennessee. Madam Speak-
er, I rise today to recognize the life and ac-
complishments of Dr. Badie Ibrahim Naddy of 
Columbia, Tennessee. 
Badie Ibrahim Naddy grew up in Amman, 
Jordan and attended the American University 
of Beirut in Lebanon before coming to the 
United States as a young man to study as a 
Fulbright Scholar. He became a Fulbright 
Scholar (a program that had only recently 
been established) to pursue his master’s de-
gree at Kansas State University in Manhattan, 
Kansas. 
Continuing his graduate education at Kan-
sas State, he went on to earn a Ph.D. in 
Chemistry. A few years after receiving his doc-
torate, Dr. Naddy briefly left the United States 
to serve as the Director of the Analysis Lab-
oratory for the Jordanian government in the 
mid-1960s. 
Dr. Naddy was able to realize his passion 
for teaching when he returned in 1967 to work 
as the first chemistry instructor at Tennessee’s 
first community college, Columbia State Com-
munity College (CSCC). Over the next 42 
years, Dr. Naddy became an American citizen, 
taught over 5,000 students during his tenure, 
and built a reputation for being an outstanding 
instructor who brought out the best in his stu-
dents and challenged them to learn. He is the 
proud father of three sons, all of whom have 
earned doctoral degrees and achieved suc-
cess in the medical field. 
In retirement, Dr. Naddy has been an active 
philanthropist constantly seeking to aid those 
in need and create opportunity. Whether using 
his personal funds to create the STEM En-
dowment Scholarship and Veterans Endow-
ment Scholarship at CSCC or purchasing UV 
lights for Maury Regional Emergency Medical 
Service to disinfect ambulances during the 
pandemic, Dr. Naddy exemplifies the spirit of 
the Volunteer State. 
Without question, Dr. Naddy is a true schol-
ar who has dedicated his life to the betterment 
of others. His life is a testament to the power 
of the American Dream, and I ask my col-
leagues to join me in acknowledging this great 
American’s tireless commitment to educational 
excellence and helping his community.

AMERICAN RESCUE PLAN ACT OF 
2021 
SPEECH OF 
HON. TERESA LEGER FERNANDEZ 
OF NEW MEXICO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, March 10, 2021 
Ms. LEGER FERNANDEZ. Mr. Speaker, I 
rise today on behalf of Tribes, Pueblos, and 
Nations in New Mexico, the 574 federally rec-
ognized Tribes across the country, and the 
Native Hawaiian community to highlight the 
American Rescue Plan’s life-saving support for 
Tribal Nations, including through the Tribal 
Coronavirus Fiscal Recovery Fund. This mon-
umental bill will, among other support, provide 
$20 billion of desperately needed assistance 
to Tribal governments throughout the United 
States, and uphold the federal government’s 
longstanding trust responsibility. 
Many of these communities suffered dis-
proportionately during the pandemic. American 
Indian and Alaskan Native people were twice 
as likely to die from COVID–19 compared to 
white Americans. Long-standing failures in 
public funding, infrastructure, housing, and ac-
cess to health care in Indian Country contrib-
uted to this crisis of equity. 
I thank my colleagues on both sides of the 
aisle for securing dedicated Coronavirus Relief 
Funds for Tribes under the CARES Act last 
Congress. However, the lack of Tribal con-
sultation and narrow rulemaking during the 
previous administration severely delayed and 
prevented many Tribal nations from receiving 
the help that they needed, when they needed 
it. This was most apparent by the roadblocks 
that prevented Tribes from effectively utilizing 
their economic recovery funds under the 
CARES Act to make up for the devastating 
loss of critical governmental revenues given 
that they lack traditional tax bases enjoyed by 
state and local governments. 
As the Chair of the Subcommittee on Indig-
enous Peoples of the United States, I’m proud 
that we secured the largest one-time invest-
ment in Native communities in our nation’s 
history in the American Rescue Plan. Impor-
tantly, Congress intended to distribute this aid 
flexibly, allowing Tribes to help their struggling 
small businesses, address health and eco-
nomic issues, and preserve their language 
and culture. 
That is why it is so important that the Biden 
Administration is committed to engage in ro-
bust Tribal consultation so that they can dis-
tribute these funds in a timely, flexible, and

equitable manner. I applaud this commitment. 
It is our responsibility to not only pass legisla-
tion that provides life-saving funds for these 
communities, but also follow through so aid 
gets to those who need it as quickly as pos-
sible. I look forward to working closely with 
Secretary-designate Deb Haaland and other 
administration officials to make this happen.

HONORING THE LIFE OF MR. 
GORDON ‘‘GORDIE’’ LANE 
HON. JOHN KATKO 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, March 16, 2021 
Mr. KATKO. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
honor the life of Mr. Gordon ‘‘Gordie’’ Lane, 
who passed away on February 23, 2021. In 
my district in Central New York, Gordie was a 
proud and tireless veterans advocate who 
spent decades working to ensure local vet-
erans 
and 
their 
families 
received 
the 
healthcare and recognition they deserve. 
Gordie was a lifelong Syracuse resident, re-
tiree of the Syracuse Police Department, and 
proud U.S. Marine Corps Veteran who served 
in Vietnam. After returning home from Viet-
nam, Gordie became acutely aware of the 
unique hardships facing many of his fellow 
veterans and the lack of support services 
available. To provide assistance and guid-
ance, Gordie became a founding member of 
the Vietnam Veterans of America Chapter No. 
103, an organization that works to promote the 
general welfare of local Vietnam Veterans and 
provides support to those attempting to access 
benefits or services they are due. As a mem-
ber of the organization, and later as its presi-
dent, Gordie worked tirelessly with local offi-
cials, law enforcement, and veterans’ hospitals 
to bolster access to critical resources and care 
for local veterans. Over the years, I had the 
distinct honor of working personally with 
Gordie and have partnered with him on a 
number of efforts to support our veterans com-
munity. 
In addition to his tireless work to address 
the needs of local veterans, Gordie also pas-
sionately worked to recognize their service. 
Notably, in 1984 Gordie acted as a driving 
force behind the creation of a local Korea-Viet-
nam Memorial to commemorate those who 
served. Today, this memorial serves as a last-
ing reminder of the great contributions and 
sacrifices made by local Vietnam and Korean 
veterans in Central New York. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues in the 
House to join me in honoring the life of Mr. 
Gordon ‘‘Gordie’’ Lane. Through his many 
years of advocacy, Gordie has undoubtedly 
made a positive impact in the lives of hun-
dreds of local veterans. I ask my colleagues to 
keep him and his family in mind as we cele-
brate his life.

IN RECOGNITION OF LIBERTY DAY 
2021 
HON. ROBERT J. WITTMAN 
OF VIRGINIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, March 16, 2021 
Mr. WITTMAN. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize Liberty Day, a celebration 
of our rights and liberties as Americans which 
are rooted in the cherished documents that 
gave birth to our nation, the Declaration of 
Independence and the Bill of Rights of the 
United States Constitution. Today, March 16th, 
marks the 270th birthday of the Father of our 
Constitution, James Madison, making this 
year’s Liberty Day particularly noteworthy. 
In 2000, Congress passed a resolution that 
Liberty Day should be celebrated each year as 
a remembrance of both the freedom that 
Americans were given in the Declaration of 
Independence and the extraordinary rights and 
liberties that Americans were given in their 
Constitution. The American experiment is 
unique in history, creating a republic of people 
united by a set of values, not by blood or land. 
Life, Liberty, and the Pursuit of Happiness 
bind Americans together, not our race or eth-
nicity. 
In addition to serving as the Fourth Presi-
dent of the United States, James Madison was 
crucial to the formation of our country. Presi-
dent Madison authored the Virginia Plan, the 
model and basis for the United States Con-
stitution. Later, during the 1st Congress of the 
United States, President Madison introduced 
the Bill of Rights, whereupon the first ten 
amendments of the Constitution were adopted. 
His other contributions, such as authoring 
many of the Federalist Papers, also deserve 
our recognition. Due to his essential role in the 
creation of our nation, Congress designated 
March 16th, Madison’s birthday, as Liberty 
Day. 
In celebration of Liberty Day, I would en-
courage all Americans to read, learn, and dis-
cuss the Constitution with their friends and

family. After doing so consider contacting your 
Representative, Senators, and President to 
share your views. All elected officials, whether 
they serve at the federal, state, or local level, 
should look to the Constitution as they go 
about their duty of governing this great nation. 
The revered documents that gave birth to 
our nation always deserve our celebration, but 
the 270th birthday of James Madison makes 
today especially significant. To mark this his-
toric occasion, I encourage Americans to take 
today to learn about our nation’s history and 
its founding documents. Therefore, Madam 
Speaker, I ask that you rise with me to cele-
brate Liberty Day.

IN HONOR OF FRANCINE GREGORY 
HON. CHRIS PAPPAS 
OF NEW HAMPSHIRE 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, March 16, 2021 
Mr. PAPPAS. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to recognize Francine Gregory, who is being 
honored for her efforts as the Veterans of For-
eign War (VFW) New Hampshire State Presi-
dent over the past year. VFW works to ensure 
that all veterans are congratulated and recog-
nized for their service and sacrifice on behalf 
of 
our 
nation. 
Despite 
serving 
under 
precedented circumstances, President Greg-
ory ensured VFW could continue fulfilling its 
mission of supporting New Hampshire’s vet-
erans during the COVID–19 pandemic. 
Born and raised in Jaffrey, President Greg-
ory currently lives in Rindge, where she is a 
devoted mother, grandmother, and great- 
grandmother who is deeply committed to sup-
porting veterans in her community. Her father, 
Sylvio Edward, served in the United States 
Army during World War II. Her father’s service 
informed President Gregory’s own passion for 
giving back to veterans and their families. 
Since 1999, President Gregory has been in-
volved with VFW Auxiliary Post 5613 in 
Jaffrey. Over the years, she has served in 
leadership roles at Post 5613 and District 5 
before taking on a statewide leadership as De-
partment Guard in 2015. Since then, she has 
risen through the ranks of VFW–NH, culmi-
nating with her service as State President this 
past year. 
In addition to her service as State President, 
President Gregory remains the Secretary for 
Auxiliary Post 5613. Beyond her involvement 
with VFW, she has had a long career across 
several sectors—in 1992, she also became an 
LNA and began serving her community as a 
provider of home health care and community 
services. 
Devoted to her community and her family, 
President Gregory also served as a Girl Scout 
leader for 12 years and today, as she em-
barks on semi-retired life, she finds no greater 
joy than spending with, and celebrating the ac-
complishments of, her beautiful family. 
On behalf of my constituents in New Hamp-
shire’s First Congressional District, I want to 
thank Francine Gregory for her longstanding 
devotion to our state and our Veterans. I con-
gratulate her on a successful term as State 
President and thank her for all that she has 
done, and will continue to do, to support Gran-
ite State veterans. 
HONORING THE SERVICE OF 
SHERIFF SCOTT STRAIT 
HON. JACK BERGMAN 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, March 16, 2021 
Mr. BERGMAN. Madam Speaker, it is my 
honor to recognize the service of Sheriff Scott 
Strait, who recently retired after serving the 
people of Mackinac County for nearly 35 
years. Through his selflessness and devotion 
to the common good, Scott has become an in-
dispensable part of the state of Michigan. 
After graduating from Lake Superior State 
University, Scott began his work at the Mack-
inac County Sheriff’s Office on April 28, 1986. 
In his service he worked tirelessly to improve 
the lives of those in Mackinac County and 
across Michigan. He also continued his pro-
fessional growth while working full time, earn-
ing his Master of Public Administration from 
Northern Michigan University in 2001. Scott 
has been an active leader throughout the 
state, serving on multiple statewide boards 
and councils including the Board of Directors 
for the Michigan Sheriffs Association. He also 
served as President of the Association in 2013 
and previously sat on the outreach committee 
of the National Sheriffs Association. He has 
been honored for his selflessness on multiple 
occasions, including earning the rank of Mas-
ter Sheriff in 2019 and being named Sheriff of 
the Year in October of 2020. Scott’s tireless 
dedication to the public good touched the lives 
of countless Michiganders, and the impact of 
his work cannot be overstated. 
Madam Speaker, on behalf of my constitu-
ents, I ask you to join me in honoring the serv-
ice of Scott Strait. Michiganders can take 
great pride in knowing the First District is 
home to such a selfless leader. On behalf of 
my constituents, I wish Scott all the best in his 
future endeavors.

TRIBUTE TO STEVE LIVENGOOD 
FOR 25 YEARS OF SERVICE TO 
THE U.S. CAPITOL HISTORICAL 
SOCIETY 
HON. HALEY M. STEVENS 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, March 16, 2021 
Ms. STEVENS. Madam Speaker, I rise to 
recognize 
the 
contributions 
of 
Steve 
Livengood to the U.S. Capitol Historical Soci-
ety and his decades of service educating the 
public about the history of this institution. 
Congress chartered the United States Cap-
itol Historical Society (USCHS) to ‘‘foster and 
increase an informed patriotism’’ in our na-
tion’s citizenry. Steve Livengood is a leader in 
executing 
that 
important 
mission. 
Those 
across the Congressional community and 
around the country have benefited from 
Steve’s expertise. For a quarter-century, Steve 
provided continuing education and talks about 
the Capitol and Congress, giving briefings be-
fore every Presidential Inauguration, as well 
as offering background information and per-
spective to tourism professionals and the 
press. Additionally, Steve is considered the 
go-to expert on Capitol Ghosts and is one of 
the few people to publicly admit that he has 
seen the ghost of John Quincy Adams in Stat-
uary Hall. 
Since 1996, Steve has served as a full-time 
Capitol tour guide, volunteer coordinator, and 
director of other public programs for USCHS. 
He led tours for notable entertainers such as 
Harrison Ford, Robert Duvall, and Martha 
Stewart; foreign dignitaries like the Attorney 
General of Italy, the President of Hungary, and 
at least one current crowned head of a promi-
nent European country. Steve also guided 
tours for titans of industry such as the Presi-
dent of The Ford Motor Company, Indra 
Nooyi, President of PepsiCo, and several 
hedge-fund managers through the halls of the 
Capitol. When the Capitol was closed to public 
tours after the 9/11 attack, Steve organized 
the first regular public tours around the Capitol 
grounds to allow visitors an opportunity for a 
guided interpretive tour despite the building’s 
closure. 
Steve’s contributions to USCHS extend far 
beyond leading tours. He served as the co-or-
ganizer of the We the People Constitution 
Tour program for DC Public School students, 
which helps Washington middle schoolers ex-
perience the Constitution as embodied in the 
buildings and work of their city. Furthermore, 
Steve wrote the We the People Constitution 
Tour Program’s Capitol script and personally 
led tours for upwards of ten thousand students 
over roughly fifteen years. When COVID–19 
closed the Capitol to visitors, Steve helped to 
develop the Society’s virtual learning series 
exploring the history of the Capitol and the 
Capitol Hill neighborhood—a series now at-
tended by Congressional staff and alumni, as 
well as history buffs from around the country. 
Steve became a member of USCHS in 1973 
and participated in many of their programs 
over the following two decades. His involve-
ment increased dramatically in 1993 when he 
began serving as a USCHS volunteer tour 
guide. Fondly remembering the tours he’d 
given as a college student, Steve quickly be-
came one of the most active tour volunteers 
for the Society. As the Society grew, Steve 
jumped at the opportunity to take a tour pro-
gram position. Steve became the Society’s 
first employee dedicated solely to organizing 
the tour program, later taking on such addi-
tional responsibilities as sales of USCHS cal-
endars to Members’ offices in the House and 
Senate. 
Steve Livengood’s passion for the Capitol 
began when he was just twelve and his par-
ents tasked him with planning an educational 
vacation. Over the next two years, he ar-
ranged for his family to visit Washington, D.C. 
During the trip Steve became so enamored 
with the city that he chose D.C. as his college 
home, attending American University to study 
Political Science and Government. 
While enrolled at American University, Steve 
leveraged a Kansas connection into volun-
teering with his Congressman Joe Skubitz. He 
spent Saturday mornings working on the sec-
ond floor of the Cannon House Office Building 
doing such things as rubberstamping ‘‘From 
the Office of Congressman Joe Skubitz, Kan-
sas 5th District’’ on copies of the official Cap-
itol guidebooks to be distributed to constitu-
ents and other visitors. 
During spring break, the staff offered Steve 
a paid opportunity. From 1965 until his grad-
uation in 1968, Steve worked part-time in Mr. 
Skubitz’s office and full time during the sum-
mer of 1967. His favorite task was giving tours

of the Capitol building for constituents and 
visitors. 
After a short, involuntary tour in Southeast 
Asia, Steve ventured to Emory University 
where he received a Master’s in recent social 
history. Along with his studies, he served as 
Speaker in the Emory University Student Leg-
islature and student body Vice President. 
Steve returned to Washington in 1973 for 
his dissertation research, titled ‘‘Scandals in 
the 1938 Senate Elections and the Passage of 
the Hatch Act.’’ Steve worked for various 
groups organizing many programs and meet-
ings on Capitol Hill for political and policy or-
ganizations before he came to work for the 
Society. Steve Livengood dedicated his career 
to the belief that the United States Capitol is 
the Temple of Democracy for the world, and 
that Congress is the most important example 
of how to implement a representative democ-
racy. Steve Livengood proudly claims that the 
United States government serves as the best 
example of government for all of humankind. 
We salute his 25 years of service to the U.S. 
Capitol Historical Society, and look forward to 
many more years of tours and public history 
lessons.

RECOGNIZING 
DANA 
BRISTOL- 
SMITH AS CONSTITUENT OF THE 
MONTH 
HON. MIKE LEVIN 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, March 16, 2021 
Mr. LEVIN of California. Madam Speaker, it 
is my honor to recognize Oceanside resident 
and Executive Director of Leap to Success 
Dana Bristol-Smith, as my March Constituent 
of the Month. March is Women’s History 
Month, a chance to celebrate and pay tribute 
to women and all the ways they have made 
profound impacts on our nation. While we use 
this opportunity to commemorate phenomenal 
women of the past and present, I am honored 
to include Dana in the celebrations, a woman 
who has dedicated her life to uplifting women 
every single day right here in my district. 
Dana started her Leap to Success Women’s 
Leadership program in 2008 after learning of 
the correlation between domestic violence vic-
tims’ lack of self-confidence and their ability to 
avoid returning to abusive partners. In re-
sponse to this discovery, she developed a pro-
gram to help these women own their power 
and start living for themselves again. Her pro-
gram brought immense success and joy from 
the participating women, and from then on, 
she made it her mission to expand Leap to 
Success to as many women as she can. 
With helpful guidance and an environment 
full of encouragement and love, Dana’s goal is 
for women who may be in abusive situations 
to discover the courage to find their voice, 
own their worth, and feel empowered to move 
forward in life. Dana’s community of sup-
porters help women realize that their past is 
nothing to be ashamed of, but rather, an op-
portunity to create a brighter and healthier fu-
ture. While there is so much more we must do 
to prevent domestic violence, I am grateful for 
leaders like Dana whose passion and heart 
creates hope and inspiration for women. I am 
honored to recognize her as my Constituent of 
the Month. 
U.S. ELECTION PRACTICES: AN 
INTERNATIONAL PERSPECTIVE 
HON. ALCEE L. HASTINGS 
OF FLORIDA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, March 16, 2021 
Mr. HASTINGS. Madam Speaker, this 
chamber recently passed H.R. I, the ‘‘For the 
People Act,’’ significant legislation making it 
easier for American citizens to vote in U.S. 
elections and improve transparency and ac-
countability in our election process. The White 
House also recently announced a new execu-
tive order to assist this effort. These are posi-
tive developments that I welcome and support, 
but, as we all know, not everything regarding 
the conduct of elections can be done at the 
federal level. Unfortunately, many state legis-
latures are now undertaking efforts that would 
make it more difficult for eligible Americans to 
participate in the electoral process and vote. 
As Chair and in the leadership of the Hel-
sinki Commission, I have supported the posi-
tive steps we are trying to take on this issue, 
yet I remain deeply concerned about those 
who want to move our country backward. 
Perhaps it would help our debate to look at 
the conduct of the 2020 U.S. elections from an 
international perspective, including the conduct 
of elections in conformity with international 
commitments first proposed and advocated by 
the United States more than 30 years ago. 
The United States has been one of five 
countries thus far where the OSCE Parliamen-
tary Assembly has observed elections during 
the unprecedented challenges of the pan-
demic, and a German parliamentarian re-
ported on its findings on February 26. He did 
not point fingers at us and accuse. He men-
tioned the positive as well as the negative. He 
is clearly a friend who cares, as most of the 
OSCE observers undoubtedly were. 
As a previous election observer in the 
OSCE region, I can also attest, that the code 
of conduct makes it is extremely unlikely that 
the OSCE election observation could be 
steered in support of any particular agenda 
other than better democracy. 
I therefore want to commend to my col-
leagues the full OSCE Final report ‘‘United 
States of America General Elections, 3 No-
vember 2020, ODIHR Limited Election Obser-
vation Mission’’, which can be found at https:// 
www.osce.org/files/f/documents/7/7/ 
477823_2.pdf. It offers an important perspec-
tive on our elections from persons who rightly 
care about the process, not the result. They 
have observed not only our elections since 
2002 but elections in dozens of other coun-
tries on a regular basis. 
The issues raised in the report are the same 
issues we Americans debate here in Wash-
ington, in our state capitals and through the 
media. I take the conclusions and rec-
ommendations, including criticisms, in this 
election observation report seriously. It serves 
as a helpful guide on what next steps we 
should take to improve our electoral system. I 
believe our election officials and state legisla-
tors should read this report; indeed, I rec-
ommend it to any American who cares about 
his or her country. It is a broad snapshot of 
our entire, complex electoral system. 
Several of the priority recommendations in 
the report deal with voting rights and voter 
identification. Specifically, it says that ‘‘authori-
ties should review existing measures to further 
reduce the number of unregistered voters, in-
cluding addressing burdensome procedures 
and 
obstacles 
faced 
by 
disadvantaged 
groups.’’ It also says that ‘‘states should make 
every effort to ensure that voter identification 
requirements are equally accessible to all vot-
ers.’’ It also makes specific recommendations 
regarding specific groups of American citizens. 
We do not need to agree about every con-
clusion and recommendation in this report to 
take it seriously. It is a contribution to our de-
bates from a unique perspective. Moreover, 
our acceptance of international observation 
serves a useful function in our foreign policy. 
OSCE election observation has encouraged 
practices giving voters a real choice in numer-
ous other countries, many of which were once 
repressive, one-party communist states but 
are now our friends and even, in some cases, 
allies. The United States initiated this effort 
with the OSCE and contributes significantly to 
election observation missions elsewhere, pro-
viding the expertise that comes with our expe-
rience. If we are to encourage other govern-
ments to take this effort seriously and imple-
ment recommendations, we need to set the 
example ourselves. Unfortunately, several 
U.S. states greatly restrict or even prohibit 
international observation. This is something 
which must change as we prepare for mid- 
term elections in 2022 and general elections in 
2024.

IN RECOGNITION OF THE 95TH 
BIRTHDAY OF JEAN ZARANKO 
HON. DEBBIE DINGELL 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, March 16, 2021 
Mrs. DINGELL. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize Jean Zaranko on the occa-
sion of her 95th birthday. Mrs. Zaranko was 
born on June 10, 1926. She was raised in 
Taylor Township, Michigan. She completed 
school up to 8th grade and then worked as an 
elevator operator at the Griswold Building in 
Downtown Detroit but felt like she needed to 
do something more for her country during 
World War II. 
At the age of 17 she altered her birth certifi-
cate in order to join the war effort at the Wil-
low Run Bomber Plant in Ypsilanti Township. 
Jean was originally hired as a welder but be-
came a riveter, working on the center wing of 
the B–24 and sometimes slipping notes into 
the wings for servicemembers to find. As a 
Rosie the Riveter, Jean’s hard work, grit, and 
patriotism not only sustained the American 
war effort, but paved a path for the next gen-
eration of working women. 
She came to meet her first husband Mos-
cow Lambert after a man at a bus stop at Wil-
low Run had broken his glasses and asked for 
assistance in writing to his son who was serv-
ing overseas. This began a two-year affair, 
constantly exchanging calls and letters until 
they finally met one day at the Train Depot in 
Detroit where he proposed to her that day. To-
gether, they had four sons and were married 
for nine years before Moscow passed away 
due to an accident at the steel plant where he 
worked. She later married Mr. Zaranko and 
they were together for 52 years. 
A proud Rosie, even now she has remained 
an active member of our community. She feels

that she is here to give her time and efforts to 
others when they need it and is God’s tool to 
help others. Her lifelong commitment to serv-
ice reminds us all of the impact that the 
Rosies have had on our state and nation. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me today in celebrating Jean Zaranko on her 
95th birthday. I join with her family, including 
twenty grandchildren and twenty-one great 
grandchildren, and friends in extending my 
best and warmest wishes to her on this spe-
cial day. I am proud to honor her life, her ac-
complishments, and her invaluable contribu-
tions to our nation.

HONORING THE LIFE OF RENA 
ANN GEORGE 
HON. TOM O’HALLERAN 
OF ARIZONA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, March 16, 2021 
Mr. O’HALLERAN. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor the life of Rena Ann George, 
a beloved resident of Winslow, Arizona, who 
passed away last month. 
In 2019, my staff and I had the privilege of 
visiting Rena and her husband, Herbert, at 
their home in Winslow. During this visit, I 
spoke with Rena and Herbert about the im-
pacts they experienced over the past four dec-
ades as a result of their forced relocation fol-
lowing the 1974 Navajo-Hopi Land Settlement 
Act. 
I am grateful to have had the opportunity to 
meet with the George family, learn about their 
life, and see some of Rena’s beautiful arts and 
crafts. 
Throughout her life, Rena dedicated herself 
wholeheartedly to her family, her many com-
munities, and her arts and crafts business. 
Her kindness, warmth, and hard work have 
made a profound impact on her community 
and her loved ones. 
Pat and I are keeping Rena’s family, friends, 
and the entire Winslow community in our pray-
ers as we mourn her passing.

IN HONOR OF MRS. CORDELIA 
LEWIS-BURKS 
HON. ANDRE´ CARSON 
OF INDIANA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, March 16, 2021 
Mr. CARSON. Madam Speaker, today I rise 
to honor my mentor and friend, Mrs. Cordelia 
Lewis-Burks, a remarkable Hoosier who has 
dedicated her life to the service of others. 
Throughout her career, Ms. Cordelia has 
fought tirelessly for inclusion, equality, and jus-
tice through the election of qualified diverse in-
dividuals. 
Ms. Cordelia discovered a love of politics 
from an early age, inspired by her father who 
was a pastor in West Virginia. Recognizing the 
importance of policy as a means to help her 
community, she engaged in political efforts as 
a young woman after moving to Chicago by 
volunteering for a local Congressional cam-
paign. 
In 1959, Ms. Cordelia moved to Indiana 
where she worked as a licensed practical 
nurse for two decades before accepting an in-
ternship with the A. Philip Randolph Institute. 
She next embarked on a career with the sen-
ior constituency group of the American Fed-
eration of Labor and Congress of Industrial 
Organizations (AFL–CIO). Ms. Cordelia contin-
ued her work with unions for many years. In 
1989, she served as chief lobbyist for the Indi-
ana branch of the American Federation of 
State, County and Municipal Employees Union 
(AFSCME), and then as the Director of Politics 
and Legislation until 2005. 
Ms. Cordelia served as a precinct com-
mitteewoman in the 7th Congressional District 
of Indiana for forty years, promoting the impor-
tance of voting. She has worked on local and 
national campaigns, including Bill Clinton’s 
1996 
presidential 
campaign 
and 
Barack 
Obama’s 2004 Illinois senate campaign. On 
March 20, 2021 she will end her 15 year ten-
ure as the Vice-Chair for the Indiana Demo-
cratic Party. 
Ms. Cordelia has been honored as one of 
the City of Indianapolis’s 100 most influential 
Black citizens and has received Indiana’s 
highest honor, the Sagamore of the Wabash 
Award. She is also a recipient of the Rosa 
Parks award, Rosa Parks Trail Blazer Award, 
as well as the Sojourner Truth Award. 
Today, I ask my colleagues to join me in 
recognizing the outstanding achievements and 
remarkable life of an Indiana treasure, Mrs. 
Cordelia Lewis-Burks and extend our best 
wishes for her future endeavors.

RECOGNIZING THE RETIREMENT 
OF GERRY PELISSERO 
HON. JACK BERGMAN 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, March 16, 2021 
Mr. BERGMAN. Madam Speaker, it is my 
honor to recognize the service of Gerry 
Pelissero, who recently retired after serving 
the people of Gogebic County as the clerk of 
court and register of deeds for more than two 
decades. Through his tireless work ethic and 
devotion to the common good, Gerry has be-
come an indispensable part of the state of 
Michigan. 
A U.P. native, Gerry graduated from Bes-
semer’s A.D. Johnston High School in 1977. 
After studying broadcasting at the Brown Insti-
tute in Minneapolis, Gerry returned to Gogebic 
County to become a radio personality and 
sports director at WUPM in Ironwood. Fol-
lowing his career in radio, Gerry worked as an 
agent with Prudential Financial for 11 years 
before deciding to run for county clerk in Janu-
ary of 2000. He would go on to win the elec-
tion and serve five terms in office as clerk of 
court and register of deeds for Gogebic Coun-
ty. In this role, Gerry oversaw the moderniza-
tion of the clerk’s office—moving from phone 
calls and faxes to email and other digital tech-
nology. His dedication and leadership allowed 
the county’s functions—including the courts 
and administrating elections—to run smoothly, 
and the impact of his work cannot be over-
stated. 
Madam Speaker, on behalf of my constitu-
ents, I ask you to join me in honoring the ca-
reer 
and 
service 
of 
Gerry 
Pelissero. 
Michiganders can take great pride in knowing 
the First District is home to such a selfless 
leader. On behalf of my constituents, I wish 
Gerry all the best in his future endeavors. 
WELCOMING THE MS. ARKANSAS 
SENIOR AMERICA PAGEANT 
HON. BRUCE WESTERMAN 
OF ARKANSAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, March 16, 2021 
Mr. WESTERMAN. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to celebrate the work of the Ms. Arkan-
sas Senior America Pageant in the State of 
Arkansas and welcome the competitors to my 
hometown of Hot Springs. 
The Ms. Senior America Pageant seeks to 
improve the lives of seniors and those around 
them by advocating for personal growth 
through continuing higher education and com-
munity service. Celebrating ‘‘the Age of Ele-
gance,’’ this pageant seeks to promote the 
value of our senior citizens’ experience and 
wisdom, while choosing someone who rep-
resents the dignity, beauty, and contributions 
of the elderly to our communities. 
I thank the reigning Ms. Arkansas Senior 
America and Fourth District native, Ms. Shar-
on Morgan Tahaney, for her service in the last 
year. After years of writing and speaking on 
leadership, Ms. Tahaney now represents the 
State of Arkansas with grace. I believe she 
was right when she said that ‘‘there are no 
limits in life based on age, just on attitude.’’ 
She, along with an organization led by Ms. 
Pattie Genovese, is working hard to expand 
this year’s State competition in hopes of pro-
viding a larger platform for senior ladies to 
share their wisdom, experiences, and knowl-
edge. 
I take this time today to celebrate the work 
of this organization and its leaders and wel-
come them all to Hot Springs. It is my hope 
that our nation will derive from them a beau-
tiful example of perseverance, hard work, and 
service.

IN HONOR OF THE UNIVERSITY OF 
KENTUCKY RIFLE TEAM 
HON. ANDY BARR 
OF KENTUCKY 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, March 16, 2021 
Mr. BARR. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
honor Coach Harry Mullins and the members 
of the University of Kentucky Rifle Team on 
winning the 2021 NCAA Rifle National Cham-
pionship. This is the third national title for the 
outstanding program, located in Lexington, 
Kentucky. 
The Wildcats were undefeated and ranked 
number one in the country last season when 
the COVID–19 pandemic caused the NCAA 
Championships to be canceled. These impres-
sive student-athletes stayed focused through-
out the 2021 season and earned the cham-
pionship on March 13 in Columbus, Ohio. 
Mary Tucker, named Most Outstanding Per-
former at the event, earned gold in both the 
smallbore and air rifle. Teammate Will Shaner 
earned silver in air rifle. 
Coach Harry Mullins has led the Rifle Team 
at the University of Kentucky since 1987. I 
thank him for his leadership and his dedication 
to these student-athletes. He has built an ex-
cellent program of which all Kentuckians can 
be proud.

CELEBRATING THE 91ST BIRTHDAY 
OF GERALD L. POTTER SR. 
HON. GUY RESCHENTHALER 
OF PENNSYLVANIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, March 16, 2021 
Mr. RESCHENTHALER. Madam Speaker, I 
rise with immense pride to celebrate the 91st 
birthday of my grandfather, Gerald L. Potter 
Sr. 
Gerald is a resident of Allegheny Township 
in Westmoreland County, Pennsylvania. As a 
veteran, Gerald served in the United States 
Air Force and as a reservist at the 911th Airlift 
Wing in southwestern Pennsylvania. During 
his military service, he met his wife of fifty 
years, my grandmother Eleen M. Potter, a 
lieutenant in the Air Force Nursing Corps. 
Continuing his dedication to service, Gerald 
attended the West Penn Hospital School of 
Nursing and graduated in their first male class. 
My grandfather’s service and mentorship 
played a critical role throughout my childhood, 
during my service in the United States Navy, 
and his example continues to guide my work 
on behalf of Pennsylvania’s 14th Congres-
sional District. 
Madam Speaker, Gerald L. Potter Sr. has 
lived a life of distinction and remains an in-
credible presence in my life, our family and 
friends, and his community. It is with great joy 
that I wish him a happy 91st birthday.

IN RECOGNITION OF ERIKA DYER’S 
SERVICE TO VIRGINIA’S FIRST 
CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT 
HON. ROBERT J. WITTMAN 
OF VIRGINIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, March 16, 2021 
Mr. WITTMAN. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize Erika Dyer, and her dedi-
cated service to Virginia’s First Congressional 
District. After eight months with my D.C. office, 
Erika will be leaving this week to pursue a 
new position. 
Erika has been an invaluable asset to my 
D.C. Staff, serving as my Communications Di-
rector. Erika joined the team during the 
COVID–19 pandemic, and she was imme-
diately committed to delivering timely and un-
derstandable information and resources to 
constituents in Virginia’s First Congressional 
District. Erika is extremely talented and hard- 
working and is consistently finding new and in-
novative ways to effectively communicate with 
constituents. Erika is also a friend to all and is 
always willing to be a resource for other staff. 
Therefore, Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
thank Erika for her hard work and dedication 
not only to the office, but to all constituents in 
Virginia’s First District. Erika has a bright fu-
ture ahead and I wish her the best in her ca-
reer. 
HONORING GEORGE HARVEY SR. 
HON. H. MORGAN GRIFFITH 
OF VIRGINIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, March 16, 2021 
Mr. GRIFFITH. Madam Speaker, I rise to 
honor George Harvey Sr. of Radford, Virginia, 
who passed away on February 24, 2021 at the 
age of 92. Mr. Harvey’s life was a true Amer-
ican success story, in which he rose from hard 
beginnings to great accomplishments in busi-
ness and then drew upon them to give back 
to his community. 
Mr. Harvey was born on May 31, 1928 in 
Mann, West Virginia. His family moved to a 
farm in Montgomery County, Virginia in 1932. 
As a child, he walked two miles to attend 
school. When attending Auburn High School, 
he had to walk two miles to catch the bus, and 
if his responsibilities of milking the farm’s cows 
delayed him from catching the bus, he had to 
walk five miles more to school. 
After graduating from Auburn in 1945, Mr. 
Harvey joined the United States Air Corps and 
was deployed to Fairbanks, Alaska. He 
passed on the chance to attend West Point 
and opted instead to return home to South-
west Virginia. He enrolled in National Business 
College in Roanoke, majoring in Business and 
Accounting. 
Mr. Harvey began his career by operating a 
gas station, followed by a Texaco Oil Distrib-
uting Business and a used car dealership. In 
1957, he became a General Motors Chevrolet 
dealer in Christiansburg. The next year, he 
bought an Oldsmobile dealership, and in 1959, 
he purchased a Chevrolet-Oldsmobile-Cadillac 
franchise in Radford. His business grew 
through the decades, earning him millions and 
providing jobs to many in the region. In 1989, 
it added a Pontiac-Buick dealership as well. 
He took the obligations that came with wealth 
and job creation seriously. According to the 
Roanoke Times, he said in 2009 that the num-
ber he was proudest of was zero, which was 
the number of employees he had laid off over 
the then-50-year history of Harvey’s Chevrolet 
Cadillac Buick. 
Many local organizations and causes bene-
fited from Mr. Harvey’s support. At Radford 
University, he was the second president of the 
foundation and the chairman of the Business 
and Economics Department, driving the cre-
ation of a certified School of Business. He was 
chairman of the board at Radford Community 
Hospital, now Carilion New River Valley Med-
ical Center. 
Other roles he held in the community in-
cluded president of the Chamber of Com-
merce; Vice President of First & Merchants 
National Bank in Radford; past president of 
the New River Dealers Association, Kiwanis 
Club and Retail Merchants Association; past 
chairman of United Fund and the Michelle 
‘‘Petie’’ Lineberry Heart Recipient Fund Drive; 
past vice president of the Southwest Virginia 
Health Services; board member of the Virginia 
automobile Dealers Association, the Common-
wealth Dealers Life Insurance Association, 
and Saint Albans Psychiatric Hospital; and 
Elder and member of The Presbyterian 
Church of Radford. 
Mr. Harvey’s survivors include his wife of 61 
years, Juanita Kirk Harvey, five children, and 
grandchildren. I would like to offer my condo-
lences to them on the loss of this great busi-
nessman and community leader.

IN HONOR OF DARWIN BEEMAN 
HON. CHRIS PAPPAS 
OF NEW HAMPSHIRE 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, March 16, 2021 
Mr. PAPPAS. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to recognize Darwin Beeman, who is being 
honored for his work as the Veterans of For-
eign War (VFW) New Hampshire State Com-
mander over the past year. VFW works to en-
sure that all veterans are recognized for their 
service and sacrifice on behalf of our nation. 
Despite facing unprecedented circumstances 
due to the COVID–19 pandemic, Commander 
Beeman worked tirelessly to ensure that our 
state’s veterans remained supported and con-
nected to the community during these chal-
lenging times. 
Raised in Barrington, Commander Beeman 
graduated from Spaulding High School in 
1976, before attending New Hampshire Voca-
tional Technical College, where he gained an 
associate degree in Industrial Electricity in 
1978. 
In 1991, Commander Beeman joined the 
U.S. Navy Reserve Seabee’s, serving honor-
ably for nearly 22 years. During his service, he 
deployed to Iraq in 2005 in support of Oper-
ation Iraqi Freedom and again from 2008 to 
2009 in support of Operation Enduring Free-
dom. 
Commander Beeman earned many acco-
lades during his decades of service, including 
the Joint Service Commendation Medal, Navy 
& Marine Corps Achievement Medal (x3), Joint 
Meritorious Unit Award, Navy Good Conduct 
Medal, Naval Reserve Meritorious Service 
Medal (x5), National Defense Service Medal 
(x2), Iraq Campaign Medal with Bronze Star & 
Eagle, Globe & Anchor, Global War on Ter-
rorism Service Medal, Military Outstanding 
Volunteer Service Medal, Armed Forces Re-
serve Medal with Bronze Hour Glass and ‘‘M’’ 
Device, Armed Forces Reserve Medal (x2), 
Navy Sea Service Deployment Ribbon, Navy 
& Marine Corps Overseas Service Ribbon 
(x2), Expert Rifleman Medal, and Expert Pistol 
Shoot Medal. 
While deployed to Iraq in 2005, Commander 
Beeman joined the VFW and, upon his return, 
joined Post 8497 in Charlestown, NH in 2006. 
He later served as District 2 Commander for 
a decade before serving in leadership roles at 
the state level, culminating in his current role 
over the past year. 
Commander Beeman and his wife, Terry, 
currently live in Claremont, and are the proud 
parents of three and grandparents of six. 
On behalf of my constituents in New Hamp-
shire’s First Congressional District, I want to 
thank Commander Beeman for his service to 
our country and his dedication to his fellow 
veterans. I congratulate him on his successful 
term as State Commander, and I thank him for 
all he does to make sure that veterans in our 
state are remembered and valued.

STUDENT LOAN REFINANCING AND 
RECALCULATION ACT OF 2021 
HON. JOHN GARAMENDI 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, March 16, 2021 
Mr. GARAMENDI. Madam Speaker, today I 
reintroduce the bipartisan ‘‘Student Loan Refi-
nancing and Recalculation Act’’ to address the 
ballooning student loan debt crisis crippling 
millions of Americans and their families. I 
thank my bipartisan co-lead Congressman 
FITZPATRICK (R–PA) and the other original co-
sponsors for their support. 
This legislation would allow students to refi-
nance their federal student loan interest rates, 
lower future student loan interest rates, elimi-
nate origination fees on student loans, delay 
student loan interest rate accrual for low-in-
come and middle-class borrowers while they 
are pursuing their education, and allow for 
borrowers in medical, veterinary or dental 
residencies to defer payments until the com-
pletion of their professional accreditation pro-
gram. 
With over 45 million Americans burdened by 
student loan debt, the education debt crisis 
has reached an epidemic level. The total stu-
dent loan debt in America has reached nearly 
$1.7 trillion according to the Federal Reserve. 
The need to service these debt loads often 
prevents graduates from making important 
purchases like houses or cars, and it also can 
make people more hesitant to take risks like 
starting a new business. Cumulatively, this 
mountain of debt slows down our economy 
and makes it less entrepreneurial, productive, 
and vibrant. 
Most student loan debt is owed to the fed-
eral government, at interest rates of up to 5.30 
percent or more for earlier loans. That per-
centage far exceeds the market rate for most 
government loans or U.S. Treasury bonds. 
Americans with student loans should be able 
to reasonably refinance their debt just as they 
would for a mortgage or any other consumer 
loan. 
The ‘‘Student Loan Refinancing and Recal-
culation Act,’’ which I have sponsored since 
the 114th Congress, would relieve some of the 
debt burden faced by American students and 
their families, while also ensuring that the fed-
eral government is not making a profit on the 
backs of students. 
Madam Speaker, I urge all members of the 
House to join us in cosponsoring the ‘‘Student 
Loan Refinancing and Recalculation Act’’ and 
to work to address this crisis facing so many 
Americans.

THE 
ONGOING 
IMPORTANCE 
OF 
THE WORK OF THE U.S. HEL-
SINKI 
COMMISSION 
IN 
THE 
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
HON. ALCEE L. HASTINGS 
OF FLORIDA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, March 16, 2021 
Mr. HASTINGS. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to discuss the work of the Commission 
on Security and Cooperation in Europe, also 
known as the Helsinki Commission and its 
continued importance in addressing chal-
lenges in our country and abroad. For over 
four decades, the Helsinki Commission has 
championed human rights, democracy, and 
comprehensive security across the 57 North 
American, European, and Central Asian coun-
tries that make up the region of the Organiza-
tion for Security and Cooperation in Europe 
(OSCE). As Chair of the Helsinki Commission 
during the 116th Congress, I worked with my 
House and Senate colleagues to continue the 
Commission’s longstanding efforts to monitor 
participating States compliance with the Hel-
sinki Accords. 
The importance of election observation in 
our country and abroad, restorative justice, the 
safety of journalists, and the global impact of 
George Floyd’s tragic death on racial justice 
efforts were just some of the issues the Com-
mission addressed last Congress, in addition 
to our continued focus on Russia, Ukraine, the 
Balkans and continued democratic develop-
ment in the region. 
As we continue our work of the 117th Con-
gress, I invite you to review the report: ‘‘Retro-
spective On The 116th Congress’’ at https:// 
www.csce.gov/international-impact/retrospec-
tive-116th-congress and http://www.csce.gov/ 
sites/helsinkicommission.house.gov/files/ 
116th%20Congress%20Report%20Final. pdf. 
This report summarizes the Commission’s 
activities, as well as recommendations critical 
for the continued promotion of democracy and 
U.S. national security. 
Madam Speaker, I look forward to con-
tinuing this critically important work during the 
117th Congress.

RECOGNIZING THE RETIREMENT 
OF BILL SPEER 
HON. JACK BERGMAN 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, March 16, 2021 
Mr. BERGMAN. Madam Speaker, it is my 
honor to recognize Bill Speer, who retired as 
the publisher and editor of The Alpena News 
after 42 years in journalism. Through his tire-
less work ethic and devotion to his community, 
Bill has become an indispensable part of 
Northern Michigan. 
After graduating from West Virginia Univer-
sity in 1978, Bill began his career in journalism 
working at The Wheeling Intelligencer, where 
he was initially responsible for covering local 
governments and the area’s steel and coal in-
dustries. His skills as a writer and reporter 
were recognized quickly, as he was named 
Ohio Bureau Editor of The Intelligencer just 
three years later. In 1988, he and his wife 
Diane moved to Alpena, Michigan, where he 
would serve as the editor of The Alpena 
News. As the paper’s head, Bill oversaw its 
transition to new ownership, the move from an 
evening to a morning publication, an ex-
panded Weekend Edition, and the rise of the 
internet in modern journalism. Bill’s dedication 
and effective leadership has allowed The 
Alpena News to thrive today. His commitment 
to the Alpena community and the state of 
Michigan touched the lives of countless 
Michiganders, and the impact of his work can-
not be overstated. 
Madam Speaker, on behalf of my constitu-
ents, I ask you to join me in recognizing the 
career of Bill Speer. Michiganders can take 
great pride in knowing the First District is 
home to such a dedicated leader. On behalf of 
my constituents, I wish Bill all the best in his 
future endeavors.

IN RECOGNITION OF LIBERTY DAY 
2021 
HON. LAUREN BOEBERT 
OF COLORADO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, March 16, 2021 
Mrs. BOEBERT. Madam Speaker, I rise in 
honor of Liberty Day, which falls on the 270th 
Birthday of the Father of the Constitution, 
James Madison. Our Founders understood the 
importance of citizen-led government and the 
power of ‘‘We the People.’’ The spirit of liberty 
is forever enshrined in the documents that 
gave birth to our Nation. I am honored to rec-
ognize the rights and liberties of the American 
people protected by the Constitution and the 
Bill of Rights this Liberty Day. 
For the past 21 years, our Nation has cele-
brated Liberty Day to honor the American lib-
erty recognized by our founding documents. In 
2000, Congress passed a resolution desig-
nating March 16th, Madison’s birthday, as Lib-
erty Day. James Madison’s ideas in the Fed-
eralist Papers, the Constitution, and the Bill of 
Rights were vital in the founding of our Nation. 
He served as the Fourth President of the 
United States and committed his life to affirm 
Americans’ rights to Life, Liberty, and the pur-
suit of Happiness. 
President Madison’s legacy and his vision 
for our Nation persists through the lives of 
Americans throughout this great country. I 
took an oath to my constituents to uphold 
these values by supporting and defending the 
Constitution. Today is a great reminder to re-
member the Constitution as elected officials 
throughout this great Nation fulfill our duty. 
In honor of Liberty Day, I encourage all 
Americans to learn and celebrate our Nation’s 
history. Our Founders’ vision lives on through 
the Declaration of Independence, the Constitu-
tion of the United States, and Bill of Rights. 
These documents continue to empower Ameri-
cans to reap the benefits of our flourishing so-
ciety rooted in freedom and liberty. I urge all 
Americans to take the time today to read and 
study these documents that empower the con-
tinuation of American ideas and values. 
Madam Speaker, I ask that you rise with me 
to celebrate Liberty Day.

IN RECOGNITION OF THE 100TH 
BIRTHDAY OF STELLA PRUSAK 
HON. DEBBIE DINGELL 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, March 16, 2021 
Mrs. DINGELL. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize Stella Prusak on the occa-
sion of her 100th birthday. Her significant con-
tributions to our community is worthy of com-
mendation. 
Mrs. Prusak was born in Coldwater, Poland 
on May 5, 1921 and came to the United 
States at only six months old. She was raised 
in Detroit, Michigan and attended St. Hedwig 
and Condon Schools until 10th grade. At the

age of 15 she went to work in the kitchen at 
Marygrove College to help out her family. 
While working, she continued to attend night 
school taking business classes. 
In 1942, Mrs. Prusak went to work with her 
father on the assembly line at Ford Motor 
Company in Detroit working on transmissions 
for aircrafts. The next year, she transferred to 
a General Motors Plant where she worked as 
a riveter on the wings of the B–29. As a Rosie 
the Riveter, Stella’s hard work, grit, and patri-
otism not only sustained the American war ef-
fort, but paved a path for the next generation 
of working women. 
After the war, she moved to California for 
work but before long she returned to Michigan 
to marry Mr. Walter Prusak and they settled in 
Allen Park. Together they had three children, 
two sons and one daughter. A proud Rosie, 
Mrs. Prusak continued to be a working woman 
and was employed by Burroughs and many 
other places as a file clerk. Known by friends 
for her kindness, generosity, and lucky streak 
at the casino, she has remained an active 
member of our community. Her lifelong com-
mitment to service reminds us all of the impact 
that the Rosies have had on our state and na-
tion. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me today in celebrating Stella Prusak on her 
100th birthday. I join with her family and 
friends in extending my best and warmest 
wishes to her on this special day. I am proud 
to honor her life, her accomplishments, and 
her invaluable contributions to our nation.

THE PASSING OF 46TH FIRST 
LADY OF INDIANA, SUSAN BAYH 
HON. ANDRE´ CARSON 
OF INDIANA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, March 16, 2021 
Mr. CARSON. Madam Speaker, today I rise 
in remembrance of Susan Bayh, 46th First 
Lady of Indiana, who passed on February 6, 
2021. Susan is survived by her husband, 
former Indiana Governor and United States 
Senator Evan Bayh, twin sons Beau and Nick 
as well as her parents and two siblings. 
At 29 years of age, Susan became the 46th 
First Lady for the State of Indiana and the 
youngest First Lady of Indiana. She worked 
tirelessly to support her husband, Evan Bayh, 
in his work. She also worked hard to advance 
her own priorities as First Lady, focusing on 
important causes like combating adult illit-
eracy. 
Professionally, Susan served on the boards 
for several biotech, telecommucations, and 
healthcare companies. She was on the board 
of Trustees for Butler University, on the 
Dean’s Council at Indiana University’s Paul H. 
O’Neill School of Public and Environmental Af-
fairs, and she taught at both Butler University 
and her alma mater, the University of South-
ern California. In 1994, Susan was appointed 
by President Bill Clinton to the International 
Joint Commission and served for six years. 
Susan was a loving wife, married to Evan 
for more than 36 years, a proud mother of 
twin sons, Beau and Nick, and a beloved 
child, sibling, and friend. She will be remem-
bered by Hoosiers for her commitment to our 
state, and for the barriers she helped break for 
women throughout her distinguished career. 
We also commend her courageous fight 
against the cancer that took her life. I will con-
tinue supporting cancer research and advo-
cacy to honor people like Susan Bayh and 
help save lives in the future. 
Today, I ask my colleagues to join me in re-
membering Susan Bayh. She leaves behind a 
legacy of outstanding accomplishments, as 
well as a deep connection with her community 
and those whose lives she touched.

IN HONOR OF THE 30TH ANNUAL 
LATINA HISTORY DAY 
HON. J. LUIS CORREA 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, March 16, 2021 
Mr. CORREA. Madam Speaker, today, I rise 
with Congresswoman ROYBAL-ALLARD on be-
half of California Latinas and the work of 
Hispanas Organized for Political Equality 
(HOPE) during ‘‘Women’s History Month.’’ 
Latina entrepreneurs are a key economic 
engine for the state, generating $19 billion in 
revenues and employing over 86,000 individ-
uals in California. Latina-owned businesses fill 
gaps and serve community needs that other 
business owners have been unwilling or un-
able to meet. Their ability to provide culturally 
relevant services gives them a competitive 
edge in meeting the demands of a Latinx mar-
ket with a purchasing power of $1.7 trillion. 
Latinas are being elected to public office 
and appointed to powerful positions. HOPE 
alumnae serve on the City Councils of Califor-
nia’s largest cities: Los Angeles, Fresno, and 
Riverside. To date 220 have been appointed 
to serve on over 400 state and local govern-
ment positions and 400 have served on over 
1,200 non-profit boards. 
We celebrate contemporary Latinas who 
continue to build upon the foundation of our 
ancestors for the betterment of future genera-
tions. We challenge each other through HOPE 
to ensure that Latinas achieve political and 
economic parity to benefit all communities and 
the status of all women. 
Please join me in celebrating March 12, 
2021 as the 30th Annual Latina History Day 
and, in congratulating Hispanas Organized for 
Political Equality, HOPE, for their service to 
the Latinas of this great nation.
