RECOGNIZING BEN KUETER 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
Iowa (Mrs. MILLER-MEEKS) for 5 min-
utes. 
Mrs. 
MILLER-MEEKS. 
Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to recognize the 
accomplishments of an incredible stu-
dent athlete from Iowa’s Second Dis-
trict. 
Iowa City High School’s Ben Kueter 
is a local legend in eastern Iowa. He is 
a four-sport star for the Little Hawks, 
dominating in football, wrestling, base-
ball, and track. 
I have recognized Ben on the floor of 
the House twice already, as he is a 
dominant wrestler, a three-time State 
champion, and currently holds a 72–0 
record going into his senior year. 
Recently, Ben not only earned a spot 
on the Team USA U20 national wres-
tling team and will now represent the 
United States at the world champion-
ships in Bulgaria this summer. 
Ben is an outstanding outfielder for 
Iowa City’s baseball team and ran the 
second leg of the distance medley relay 
team that took second place at the 2021 
Drake Relays. A standout football 
player, Ben plays both tight end and 
linebacker. Last fall, Ben committed 
to both football and wrestling pro-
grams at the University of Iowa. 
I look forward to watching Ben help 
the Little Hawks win State champion-
ships next year and helping our beloved 
Hawkeyes when he heads down College 
Street next year. 
Good luck, Ben. Go Little Hawks and 
Go Hawkeyes. 
RECOGNIZING LISA HOERSCHELMANN 
Mrs. 
MILLER-MEEKS. 
Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to recognize the 
feats of Lisa Hoerschelmann. 
Lisa has been an employee of First 
Gateway Credit Union for over 10 years 
and has always gone above and beyond 
in customer service and ensuring that 
customers receive the best service and 
advice for their accounts. 
Lisa’s commitment to customer serv-
ice paid off when an elderly woman was 
influenced by a scammer to withdraw a 
large sum of money from her retire-
ment fund. Thankfully, Lisa caught 
the scam and prevented the scam from 
occurring. 
Because of Lisa’s commitment to 
looking out for her customers, she was 
awarded the Consumer Protection Hero 
Award from the Iowa State Govern-
ment. 
I can think of no one more deserving 
of this award than Lisa. Her attentive-
ness and quick thinking protected a 
member of her credit union. I am 
thankful that there are hardworking 
and thoughtful people like Lisa look-
ing out for the citizens of our commu-
nity.

HONORING THE LIFE AND LEGACY 
OF 
FLIGHT 
OFFICER 
ROSCOE 
PERKINS 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Washington (Mr. KILMER) for 5 min-
utes. 
Mr. KILMER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor the life and legacy of 
Flight Officer Roscoe Perkins, a distin-
guished aviation pioneer who helped 
pave the way for racial integration in 
the United States Armed Forces and 
whose service has inspired generations 
of aviators. 
Flight Officer Roscoe Perkins served 
our country in World War II as a mili-
tary pilot and was one of the first 
Black-American pilots to serve in the 
United States Armed Forces. 
Flight Officer Perkins was among the 
nearly 1,000 men, referred to as the 
Tuskegee Airmen, who trained at the 
United 
States 
Army 
Air 
Corps’ 
Tuskegee Army Airfield in Alabama. 
The Tuskegee Airmen were citizens 
who wanted to fight for their country 
but were originally barred from doing 
so due to segregationist policies at the 
time. This led to the creation of the 
Tuskegee Institute to train Black 
Army personnel to become pilots. 
Despite facing many obstacles, the 
Tuskegee Airmen beat the odds. Even 
in the face of significant barriers, they 
showed skill and patriotism. They 
fought valiantly in World War II by fly-
ing more than 15,000 combat sorties 
over Europe and North Africa. 
For his part, Roscoe Perkins logged 
nearly 400 hours of flight during his 
years of service between January 31, 
1944, and February 10, 1946. He flew P– 
47s and B–25s for the U.S. Army Air

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE

June 21, 2022 
Corps in the 332nd Fighter Group and 
the 477th Bombardment Group. 
Congress voted in 2006 to award the 
Tuskegee Airmen with the Congres-
sional Gold Medal, which is the most 
prestigious award the Federal Govern-
ment can award to servicemembers. 
President George W. Bush presented 
the surviving airmen with the medal at 
a ceremony in the U.S. Capitol rotunda 
in March of 2007. Since then, Congress 
has 
begun 
posthumously 
awarding 
medals to the families of deceased air-
men once they are found. 
Flight Officer Perkins died in 1978. 
After years of effort, his surviving fam-
ily members obtained the bronze rep-
lica of his medal in 2017. 
Flight Officer Perkins’ service to our 
Nation has helped break down count-
less barriers for those who have fol-
lowed in his footsteps, and we should 
all be inspired by his service. 
In a time when our world was threat-
ened by fascism, Flight Officer Perkins 
stood among the many to ward off its 
force. 
In a time when our world was quick 
to define the quality or character of a 
person based on their skin, Flight Offi-
cer Perkins’ service demonstrated that 
character is about living true to your 
values, working toward the common 
good. 
At a time when we were fighting in 
the air, Flight Officer Perkins’ service 
illustrated the struggle at home and 
the need to end segregationist policies. 
Following his service in the military, 
Flight Officer Perkins was unable to 
become a commercial airline pilot due 
to the color of his skin, so he continued 
his passion for flying by getting in a 
cockpit any chance he could get and by 
working as an aircraft mechanic. 
During his 20-year career after the 
military, he worked his way up from 
apprentice mechanic to crew chief and 
then to crew supervisor. 
Flight Officer Perkins’ passion and 
skill for flying may have inspired an 
entire Nation, but close to home, he 
also inspired his family. All five of his 
children went to college and completed 
degrees. 
His daughter went on to be one of the 
first Black flight attendants for a 
major airline. His great-grandson is 
now an Air Force pilot and flies an F– 
15 Strike Eagle. Before retiring, his son 
worked as an electrical engineer for 
NASA. 
Today, Madam Speaker, we honor 
and celebrate Flight Officer Roscoe 
Perkins, whose service to his country 
and to his community is greatly appre-
ciated and will long be remembered. 
f 
FINDING RENEWABLE ENERGY 
SOURCES 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
California (Mr. LAMALFA) for 5 min-
utes. 
Mr. LAMALFA. Madam Speaker, as 
we are becoming painfully aware as 
Americans, 
energy 
independence 
is 
vital to our national security and our 
everyday lives. 
America needs to embrace a true en-
ergy policy that supports every type, 
from natural gas, oil drilling, nuclear, 
hydroelectric, and the other renew-
ables. We cannot simply declare that 
some methods of power generation are 
off limits like the Biden administra-
tion and others have been trying to do 
to natural gas and oil. 
Energy production of all kinds is im-
portant for rural economies which pro-
vide jobs, income at the farm level and 
at the wildcatter level, tax revenue, et 
cetera. 
Take California, for example. We are 
the leading State in biomass produc-
tion, 
right, 
our 
crowded 
forests, 
untended for so many years due to poli-
cies of the Forest Service getting sued 
to not do anything before or after a 
fire. 
So in my northeast part of the State, 
we have millions of tons of waste bio-
mass just sitting on our forest floors, 
dry, decomposing, turning into CO2, 
waiting to be part of the next cata-
strophic forest fire which we see hap-
pening in overabundance. 
The Dixie fire started in my district 
last year—one million acres—when a 
tree fell into a power line. 
Using biomass is a win-win-win for 
everybody. It brings local jobs, putting 
our workers in these rural towns that 
are suffering economically for years 
due to the shutdown of this timber in-
dustry, basically, putting those folks 
back to work, tending to work that 
needs to be done to have forests thin-
ner, cleaner, healthier, and less fire- 
prone. 
But as we continue toward green en-
ergy and strict carbon and environ-
mental regulations which only recently 
began, we are seeing that other forms 
of energy are not being available, too. 
Nuclear. Nuclear energy is a serious 
alternative energy source and really 
shouldn’t be alternative because it is 
CO2-free. It has been around for a long 
time, but for some, it isn’t politically 
correct. 
California has one remaining nuclear 
reactor, the one at Diablo Canyon, not 
too far from San Luis Obispo, where 
my tie comes from. Diablo Canyon 
takes up only 900 acres of land and pro-
vides nearly 10 percent of California’s 
energy portfolio, almost 10 percent in 
one power plant, and they want to take 
it offline because it is not politically 
correct. 
Of course, in California, it is respon-
sible for 23 percent of our carbon-free 
generation, if you want to play the car-
bon game. 
In a State that faces rolling black-
outs to our grid every summer, every 
time the wind blows because we don’t 
want tree branches falling into power 
lines, we can’t fare without that 10 per-
cent of energy provided by nuclear 
power, which doesn’t have that threat. 
Nuclear power plants are cheaper to 
run than most, even accounting for 
managing and disposing of radioactive 
material, which there are ways to deal 
with the radioactive leftovers, too, if 
we can just get to them. 
Nuclear power is consistent, 24/7. Un-
like solar and wind, it is available all 
the time. It is not affected by the 
clouds or lack of wind. Solar and wind 
power do have their place in our port-
folio, but we know we can’t completely 
rely upon them. 
We can’t build enough batteries to 
store enough power without having 
mines in Africa taking advantage of 
kids’ labor to put them in place. 
When a wildfire inevitably rages like 
it has year after year, sending thick, 
black smoke into the air, our solar 
panels 
are 
obscured 
by 
ash 
and 
screened from direct sunlight. The 
solar and wind systems just don’t put 
out what they need to in order to have 
a modern grid. 
Our State has already inexplicably 
banned the sale of gas-powered backup 
generators. What are people supposed 
to do at their homes? When they take 
away backup generators that are gas- 
powered, what are you supposed to 
power them with, a battery? Ridicu-
lous. 
One of the most critical sources of re-
newable energy along the entire Pa-
cific Northwest is hydroelectric gen-
eration. It accounts for about 12 per-
cent of our State’s total portfolio and 
is the cheapest form of renewable en-
ergy available. 
It is about 50 percent the cost of nu-
clear, 40 percent the cost of fossil fuels, 
and 25 percent the cost of using natural 
gas. Yet, it faces numerous obstacles as 
well. 
They want to remove the dams. They 
are calling it the largest ever dam re-
moval project—they are so proud of, it 
seems—up on the Klamath Basin, up on 
the Klamath River. 
Four dams: the J.C. Boyle, Copco No. 
1 and No. 2, and Iron Gate are sched-
uled to be removed, if they have their 
way. That will take renewable, avail-
able 24/7, power to over 70,000 homes 
offline, and it will have to be replaced 
by miles and miles of solar panels or 
windmills chopping up birds someplace. 
Why do they want to remove this? 
Because of political correctness. They 
hope that maybe it will help the river 
have slightly cooler water for salmon 
spawning, maybe 1 degree, but it won’t 
really work that way because it is 
going to leave all sorts of silt and hurt 
the Klamath River. 
So one thing after another. We have 
to find a reliable energy source.

PRAYER 
The Chaplain, the Reverend Margaret 
Grun Kibben, offered the following 
prayer: 
Holy God, You see us as we are—our 
strengths, our weaknesses, our accom-
plishments, and our shortcomings—and 
still You love us with a parent’s heart. 
God, we give You thanks for the pa-
tience You show us time and again. De-
spite our inclination to take things 
into our own hands, to fool ourselves to 
think that our way is the only way, to 
turn from Your guidance and walk 
away from Your loving arms, nonethe-
less, You stand beside, behind, and be-
fore us, ready to right us when we 
stumble and to reassure us when we 
fail. 
Like a hen that broods over her nest, 
You gather us under Your wings and 
tend to our every need. Open our eyes 
to Your gracious care over us. Call us 
to seek shelter in Your encouraging 
embrace and to trust Your steadying 
hand. 
We ask that You give us this day re-
minders of Your abiding faithfulness 
and enduring mercy. As we stand in the 
light of Your grace, may we see both 
our guilt and our acquittal. 
Then may we find restoration and re-
newal to serve You as those who have 
been given a new chance to bask in 
Your love and proclaim Your compas-
sion for all people. 
In Your merciful name we pray. 
Amen.

lic for which it stands, one nation under God, 
indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.

MESSAGE FROM THE SENATE 
A message from the Senate by Ms. 
Byrd, one of its clerks, announced that 
the Senate has agreed to without 
amendment a concurrent resolution of 
the House of the following title: 
H. Con. Res. 88. Concurrent Resolution au-
thorizing the use of the Capitol Grounds for 
the Greater Washington Soap Box Derby. 
The message also announced that the 
Senate has passed bills of the following 
titles in which the concurrence of the 
House is requested: 
S. 2129. An act to promote freedom of infor-
mation and counter censorship and surveil-
lance in North Korea, and for other purposes.

f 
RETURN TO FISCAL RESTRAINT 
(Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania asked 
and was given permission to address 
the House for 1 minute and to revise 
and extend his remarks.) 
Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania. Madam 
Speaker, last week, a report from 
Moody’s found that the average Amer-
ican is now spending an extra $460 a 
month on everyday items like gas and 
groceries. Because of this staggering 
inflation caused by President Biden’s 
failed policies, the average American 
family is being impacted. 
The burden of this out-of-control in-
flation has fallen on working families, 
who can least afford to pay for the sky-
rocketing price of goods. 
Now, instead of addressing the root 
causes of inflation, President Biden 
and Vice President HARRIS are once 
again championing their build back 
broken agenda, an agenda that would 
pour gasoline on a fire that is already 
far out of control. 
Americans cannot afford this reck-
less spending, and we cannot afford to 
allow radical socialist policies to fur-
ther destroy our Nation’s economy. 
It is time to return to fiscal re-
straint. It is time to stop spending 
money that we don’t have. It is time to 
stop spending money on things that we 
do not need. 
f 
STOP THE SPENDING 
(Mr. BERGMAN asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. BERGMAN. Madam Speaker, I 
have spoken before about President 
Biden’s and House Democrats’ flawed 
economic record. I continue to hear 
from constituents from across Michi-
gan’s First District who feel cast aside 
by the policies of this administration. 
Inflation has hit a high of 8.6 percent, 
and this President continues to blame 
everyone but himself. High inflation 
isn’t an act of God. High inflation isn’t 
solely an act of the Federal Reserve. 
High inflation certainly isn’t an act of 
Putin, either. 
President Biden said the buck stops 
with him, but maybe he has changed 
his mind. Don’t be deceived; his stated 
plan to address inflation is a farce. 
The President and his advisers told 
the American people inflation was 
transitory, all while passing trillions 
in new spending. Instead of taking re-
sponsibility, this President continues 
to push tax-and-spend legislation that 
worsens inflation while leaving work-
ing families to pick up the tab. 
I am asking the President and my 
colleagues to listen to the American 
people, stop the spending, and confront 
inflation head-on. 
f 
DON’T PROSECUTE BORDER 
PATROL AGENTS 
(Mr. LAMALFA asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. LAMALFA. Madam Speaker, for 
months, the Democrats and the liberal 
media have been intentionally falsely 
accusing Border Patrol agents of whip-
ping illegal immigrants coming across 
our southern border. The media falsely 
mislabeled 
the 
agents’ 
long 
reins, 
which they use to control their horses, 
as whips. 
Of course, where are all the fact 
checkers about this information? I 
guess they are absent over at The 
Washington Post and CNN. 
Yet, the Biden administration’s De-
partment of Homeland Security isn’t 
interested in the truth, either. They 
want to punish these Border Patrol 
agents who are doing their job and ar-
resting illegal immigrants. Following a 
false narrative and special interest 
pressure, the DHS has announced plans 
to discipline these folks on horseback 
involved in the so-called incidents. 
Prosecuting these law enforcement 
officers will do nothing but lower the 
already-low morale at the CBP. 
The Biden administration’s open-bor-
der and soft-on-crime policies have 
incentivized 2 million illegal immi-
grants to come across our southern 
border and have stripped Border Patrol 
agents from having the authority to 
stop it. Instead, they have become Wel-
come Wagon workers. 
There is a caravan of illegal immi-
grants, nearly 20,000 strong, awaiting 
the day Biden fulfills his destructive 
promise of ending the border protec-
tions under title 42. 
We need a true border policy that 
protects Americans.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from California? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. SWALWELL. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, I thank the chair-
man and ranking member of the Com-
mittee on Homeland Security for their 
support for moving my bill, H.R. 7777, 
the Industrial Control Systems Cyber-
security Training Act, through com-
mittee. I thank the Speaker and major-
ity leader for bringing this measure to 
the floor today. 
Madam Speaker, H.R. 7777 is not only 
a winning number on a slot machine; it 
is a winning formula for bringing cyber 
hygiene to our industrial control sys-
tems across America. 
Every day, we rely on critical infra-
structure to power our homes, fuel our 
cars, and connect us online. One essen-
tial component of critical infrastruc-
ture is industrial control systems, also 
known as ICS, which digitally manage 
operations of these vital systems. 
As Congress considers legislation to 
address cybersecurity threats to Amer-
ica’s interests, my legislation would 
help to secure vulnerable ICS at every 
level of our economy and our govern-
ment. H.R. 7777 would make permanent 
an existing education initiative within 
the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure 
Security Agency, also known as CISA. 
This initiative, the ICS training ini-
tiative, provides free virtual and in- 
person cybersecurity training to public 
and private security entities, including 
critical infrastructure administrators, 
national laboratories, and even small 
businesses. 
This training equips technology pro-
fessionals across all levels with the 
tools and expertise necessary to secure 
themselves against advanced persistent 
threats. 
When threats turn into successful at-
tacks, it impacts the daily lives of 
every American, including sowing dis-
cord into our electoral processes, as we 
have seen election after election; shut-
ting down our pipelines; or breaking 
down supply chains that provide essen-
tial food and other materials. 
That 
means 
virtually 
everything 
that is connected to a network has a 
potential vulnerability, or what we 
would refer to as a left-of-boom vulner-
ability, the vulnerability that exists 
before the attack occurs. Every person, 
small business, or government data-
base is a potential target. 
In 2021 alone, cybercrimes inflicted 
approximately $6 trillion in damages 
across the world. Attacks on industrial 
networks account for a significant por-
tion of that number, and it is only 
going to get worse in the future. 
These threats often emerge from so-
phisticated state actors, like Russia 
and China, that have the ability to ex-
ploit vulnerabilities to disrupt and de-
stroy the systems that make our way 
of life possible. 
As Putin and his regime become in-
creasingly isolated because of a suc-
cessful sanctions regime and the effort 
that we are prosecuting to help keep 
Ukraine in the fight, we should expect 
the Kremlin to progressively target the 
United States and our allies with un-
conventional cyberattacks on our elec-
tion systems and critical infrastruc-
ture. Any success that Russia has in 
exploiting vulnerabilities will inevi-
tably be closely watched by other 
countries, particularly China. 
In sum, we know this threat is real 
and that malignant actors will persist-
ently probe our systems to find addi-
tional weaknesses to exploit, which 
would cause real harms, harms to 
Americans that would blunt innova-
tion, steal American secrets, and de-
stroy America’s small businesses. 
In my district, cybersecurity profes-
sionals deal with threats to ICS every 
single day. I specifically note two 
major Federal research centers, Sandia 
and Lawrence Livermore National Lab-
oratories, which play a critical role in 
protecting against worldwide cyber 
threats. They are in the heart of my 
district in Livermore, California. 
This support is leveraged every day 
by numerous Federal agencies, includ-
ing CISA, which sit on the front lines 
of protecting our infrastructure from 
bad actors. We in Congress must do ev-
erything we can to equip our security 
protectors with the resources they 
need to continue the fight, and that is 
what this legislation does. 
Resources must include proactive 
ways to help cybersecurity-focused en-
tities retain a competitive workforce. 
The training programs in my legisla-
tion will equip technology profes-
sionals with the skills, expertise, and 
resources they need to build resilience 
against threats to some of our most 
sensitive facilities.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5691 
June 21, 2022 
I applaud CISA for increasing these 
trainings, which H.R. 7777—which I 
love saying—would make permanent. 
This commonsense program is an easy 
solution to build resilience against 
cyberattacks for our most vulnerable 
systems. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my House 
colleagues to support this legislation, 
and I reserve the balance of my time. 
Mrs. 
MILLER-MEEKS. 
Madam 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today in sup-
port of H.R. 7777, the Industrial Control 
Systems Cybersecurity Training Act. 
In policy discussions following recent 
cyber incidents, like SolarWinds and 
Colonial Pipeline, one constant area of 
concern to Congress and our cyber de-
fenders, like the Cybersecurity and In-
frastructure Security Agency, CISA, 
has been improving the Nation’s work-
force pipeline for cybersecurity and 
other STEM-related fields. 
As the interconnectivity of our daily 
lives continues to grow, the estimated 
worldwide cost of cybercrime has risen 
to $6 trillion annually. Despite this 
alarming and growing threat, some es-
timates say that the cybersecurity 
workforce is currently short about 1 to 
3 million qualified professionals. 
A recent Center for Strategic and 
International Studies, CSIS, study of 
IT decisionmakers across eight coun-
tries found that 82 percent of employ-
ers report a shortage of cybersecurity 
skills, and 71 percent believe this tal-
ent gap causes direct and measurable 
damage to their organization. 
b 1415 
Federal agencies have been working 
to bridge the gap in skills required to 
prepare a future cyber workforce. 
CISA is collaborating closely with or-
ganizations like the National Institute 
of Standards and Technology, NIST, to 
identify cyber knowledge deficits on a 
sector-by-sector basis. One example is 
the National Initiative for Cybersecu-
rity 
Education 
framework, 
which 
serves as a useful precursor for direct-
ing Federal resources into education 
and research priorities. 
H.R. 7777 would require that CISA 
provide resources for the purpose of 
training cyber operators that are flu-
ent across multiple segments of the 
cyber domain, not only information 
technology but also operational tech-
nology, like manufacturing systems 
and industrial control systems, which 
are commonplace within critical infra-
structure sectors and are increasingly 
exposed to cyber risk. 
We must continue to do all we can to 
improve our Nation’s cyber posture and 
focus on policy that can help make our 
government and private sector critical 
infrastructure operations more resil-
ient and prepared for future events. 
Madam Speaker, I urge Members to 
join me in supporting H.R. 7777, and I 
yield back the balance of my time. 
Mr. SWALWELL. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself the balance of my time. 
I appreciate the bipartisan, coopera-
tive effort here to make sure that our 
cyber professionals across America are 
ready to meet the growing threats 
from Russia, China, and even nonstate 
cyber actors. That is exactly what H.R. 
7777 seeks to do, by authorizing CISA’s 
ICS cybersecurity training program 
and directing CISA to report to Con-
gress annually about the initiative. 
Improving the state of our cybersecu-
rity workforce will be an ongoing ef-
fort, and these reports will help Con-
gress continue to strengthen this pro-
gram in the future. 
Passing this bill will help us continue 
to move forward in developing the cy-
bersecurity workforce we need to de-
fend against the growing cyber threats 
that we face. In particular, this will 
help strengthen small businesses, par-
ticularly those in critical infrastruc-
ture, who do not yet today have cyber-
security defense forces receiving that 
training. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to support H.R. 7777, and I yield 
back the balance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from California (Mr. 
SWALWELL) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 7777, as 
amended. 
The question was taken. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the 
opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being 
in the affirmative, the ayes have it. 
Mr. ROY. Madam Speaker, on that I 
demand the yeas and nays. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to section 3(s) of House Resolution 
8, the yeas and nays are ordered. 
Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, fur-
ther proceedings on this motion are

bers may have 5 legislative days in 
which to revise and extend their re-
marks and to include extraneous mate-
rial on this measure. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there

tleman from California? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. SWALWELL. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in support of 
H.R. 
7174, 
the 
National 
Computer 
Forensics 
Institute 
Reauthorization 
Act of 2022, introduced in this House by 
Ms. SLOTKIN of Michigan. 
Ms. SLOTKIN’s legislation addresses 
ransomware threats that are on the 
rise and are costing American compa-
nies and the American people millions 
of dollars each year. In fact, former 
Cisco CEO John Chambers estimates 
that in the year 2022, we will see ap-
proximately $120,000, on average, in 
costs to 60,000 American businesses 
who will be victims of ransomware at-
tacks. 
Ransomware attacks have targeted 
our most critical industries, from the 
energy sector to food processing to 
schools and even hospitals. State and 
local law enforcement are on the front 
lines of protecting against this threat 
and often are the first people called 
when an attack occurs, and they are on 
the ground in communities to respond. 
Recently, FBI Director Chris Wray 
told Congress that within an hour, if a 
business calls the FBI, one of his 
agents can respond, either virtually or 
at their doorstep, to assist them. 
More than ever, State and local law 
enforcement need the training and 
tools to investigate and respond to 
ransomware and other cyber-based at-
tacks. That is where the National Com-
puter Forensics Institute, or NCFI, 
comes in. 
Established in 2008 by the U.S. Secret 
Service, NCFI is recognized as a pre-
eminent Federal facility for State and 
local law enforcement to receive cyber-
security training. 
At NCFI, the Secret Service trains 
State, local, Tribal, and territory offi-
cers, 
prosecutors, 
and 
judges 
in 
cybercrime investigations and cyber- 
incident response. 
To date, because of this training, 
more than 18,000 law enforcement offi-
cers, prosecutors, and judges across all 
50 States and territories have received 
training at NCFI’s center in Hoover, 
Alabama. 
As introduced, Ms. SLOTKIN’s H.R. 
7174 would reauthorize NCFI through 
2032. 
Like many of my colleagues here in 
Congress, I began my career as a pros-
ecutor, and I know the importance of 
training law enforcement, prosecutors, 
and judicial officers. 
Before a case ever reaches the trial 
stage, dozens of law enforcement offi-
cers, investigators, and attorneys have 
pored over every shred of evidence to 
ensure justice is served. 
Since evidence today is increasingly 
digital and more and more meticulous 
to review, it is imperative that law en-
forcement, prosecutors, and judicial of-
ficers from communities across the 
country have access to necessary train-
ing on emerging and digital tech-
nologies, like AI, and equipment to put 
that training into action. That is what 
Ms. SLOTKIN’s bill will do. 
H.R. 7174 will ensure that NCFI’s op-
eration will continue for 10 more years 
and better position the institute for 
success. 
The bill strengthens its operations by 
requiring privacy, civil rights, and 
civil liberties protections be integrated 
into the training; it authorizes NCFI to 
engage in research and development of 
different approaches to training for in-
vestigations involving ransomware and 
threats involving the use of emerging 
digital assets; and it requires the Se-
cret Service Director to report on the 
demand for training at NCFI, the insti-
tute’s ability to meet that demand, and 
whether to expand further NCFI facili-
ties and training opportunities. 
NCFI’s authority to continue its 
training will end in November of this 
year, but we know that cyber actors, 
nation-state 
and 
non-nation-state, 
their efforts will not, which makes 
H.R. 7174’s swift passage so important. 
The House authorized the NCFI by an 
overwhelming bipartisan vote in the 
115th Congress, and the Committee on

ters of great importance to this Nation. 
Sincerely, 
BENNIE G. THOMPSON, 
Chairman, 
Committee on Homeland Security. 
Mrs. 
MILLER-MEEKS. 
Madam 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today in sup-
port of H.R. 7174, the National Com-
puter Forensics Institute Reauthoriza-
tion Act. 
Our Nation is facing an increase in 
cyber threats stemming from multiple 
angles. These range from critical infra-
structure vulnerabilities to child ex-
ploitation online. 
Previous cyberattacks have high-
lighted the need for preventive meas-
ures and law enforcement support at 
every level, including Federal, State, 
local, Tribal, and territorial. 
Many recent attacks and exploited 
vulnerabilities have severely impacted 
the American people and economy. 
Adding to this, with the ongoing war in 
Ukraine, the intelligence community is 
warning of a heightened cyber threat 
from Russia. 
The National Computer Forensics In-
stitute in Hoover, Alabama, is operated 
by the United States Secret Service. 
NCFI provides essential education and 
training to State, local, Tribal, and 
territorial law enforcement, prosecu-
tors, and judges on how to mitigate, 
detect, and respond to cyber threats. 
Since opening in 2008, NCFI has con-
tinuously worked to equip its students 
with the necessary tools and knowl-
edge needed to prevent cybercrime. 
Now, more than ever, as we are fac-
ing cyberattacks from malicious actors 
like Russia, China, and Iran, in addi-
tion to other criminal behavior online 
like 
child 
pornography, 
bolstering 
cyber training and tools for our law en-
forcement partners is imperative. 
Congress officially authorized the 
NCFI for 5 years in 2017. This bill reau-
thorizes NCFI for 10 years and updates 
its mission, function, and curriculum. 
In addition, the bill requires an an-
nual report on NCFI’s impact and ac-
tivities, a requirements analysis for its 
potential expansion, and a process to 
receive feedback from participating ju-
risdictions. 
Cybersecurity has never been more 
important to homeland security, and it 
is pivotal that we train our State and 
local law enforcement to address this 
threat and other online nefarious ac-
tivities head-on. 
Madam Speaker, I urge Members to 
join me in supporting H.R. 7174, and I 
yield back the balance of my time. 
Mr. SWALWELL. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself the balance of my time. 
As stated, the NCFI training and edu-
cation program is too important to ex-
pire. It will do so in November. I appre-
ciate the gentlewoman from Iowa and 
her side’s support for this legislation. 
Madam Speaker, I urge swift passage 
of H.R. 7174, and I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from California (Mr. 
SWALWELL) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 7174, as 
amended. 
The question was taken. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the 
opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being 
in the affirmative, the ayes have it. 
Mr. ROY. Madam Speaker, on that I 
demand the yeas and nays. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to section 3(s) of House Resolution 
8, the yeas and nays are ordered. 
Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, fur-
ther proceedings on this motion are 
postponed.

bill (H.R. 5274) to amend the Homeland 
Security Act of 2002 to provide training 
for U.S. Customs and Border Protec-
tion personnel on the use of contain-
ment devices to prevent secondary ex-
posure to fentanyl and other poten-
tially lethal substances, and for other 
purposes.

GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. SWALWELL. Madam Speaker, I 
ask unanimous consent that all Mem-
bers may have 5 legislative days in 
which to revise and extend their re-
marks and to include extraneous mate-

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from California? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. SWALWELL. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today in sup-
port of H.R. 5274, the Prevent Exposure 
to Narcotics and Toxics Act, as intro-
duced by my friend and colleague, Rep-
resentative JOYCE of Ohio. I see that he 
is here, so I will let him speak on his 
bill, and I will follow up shortly. 
I urge my colleagues to support this 
bill, and I reserve the balance of my 
time.

June 21, 2022 
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, 
COMMITTEE ON HOMELAND SECURITY, 
Washington, DC, June 17, 2022. 
Hon. RICHARD E. NEAL, 
Chairman, Committee on Ways and Means,

with you on this legislation and other mat-
ters of great importance to this Nation. 
Sincerely, 
BENNIE G. THOMPSON, 
Chairman, 
Committee on Homeland Security. 
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, 
COMMITTEE ON WAYS AND MEANS, 
Washington, DC, June 17, 2022. 
Hon. BENNIE G. THOMPSON, 
Chair, Committee on Homeland Security, 
Washington, DC. 
DEAR CHAIR THOMPSON: In recognition of 
the desire to expedite consideration of H.R. 
5274, the ‘‘PREVENT Act of 2021’’, the Com-

Finally, I would appreciate your response 
to this letter confirming this understanding 
and would ask that a copy of our exchange of 
letter on this matter be included in the Con-
gressional Record during floor consideration 
of H.R. 5274. 
Sincerely, 
RICHARD E. NEAL, 
Chair. 
Mrs. 
MILLER-MEEKS. 
Madam 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today in sup-
port of H.R. 5274, the Prevent Exposure 
to Narcotics and Toxics Act, intro-
duced by my friend and colleague, 
DAVID JOYCE. 
This bill addresses the important 
issue of protecting our frontline Cus-
toms and Border Protection personnel 
from the dangerous and illicit drugs 
they encounter every day. 
This is especially important as the 
situation at our southern border con-
tinues to worsen by the day under this 
administration. In fiscal year 2021, Cus-
toms and Border Protection officers 
and agents seized more than 914,000 
pounds of illicit narcotics, and so far 
this fiscal year, CBP is on track to 
seize a similar amount of illegal drugs. 
b 1430 
Unfortunately, in 2019, the Depart-
ment of Homeland Security’s Office of 
the Inspector General issued a report 
that found CBP personnel were not 
adequately 
protected 
and 
were 
at 
greater risk of secondary exposure 
while handling illicit drugs such as 
fentanyl and methamphetamine. 
CBP frontline personnel often work 
in challenging and dangerous environ-
ments as they risk exposure to these il-
licit drugs via inhalation, ingestion, 
skin contact, and contact with needles. 
H.R. 5274 will require the CBP Com-
missioner to issue containment de-
vices, which are critical tools that pro-
vide protection against secondary ex-
posure to fentanyl and other chemicals 
to help protect our frontline officers 
and agents. 
Madam Speaker, I strongly encour-
age all Members to support this bill to 
protect our dedicated frontline law en-
forcement at the border, and I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. 
SWALWELL 
of 
California. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance 
of my time. 
Mrs. 
MILLER-MEEKS. 
Madam 
Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gen-
tleman from Ohio (Mr. JOYCE). 
Mr. JOYCE of Ohio. Madam Speaker, 
with over 108,000 Americans dying from 
a drug overdose last year, all of us are 
uniquely aware of the opioid crisis rav-
aging our country. 
Similarly, Americans have watched 
as the crisis at our southern border has 
turned into an outright catastrophe. 
There is a threat that both these crises 
pose, and it has gone unaddressed for 
far too long: secondary exposure to 
fentanyl. Secondary exposure occurs 
when an individual is unintentionally 
exposed to fentanyl and the drug enters 
the bloodstream through accidental ab-
sorption. 
This happened in my home State of 
Ohio. A police officer overdosed after 
brushing fentanyl off his uniform fol-
lowing the arrest of a drug dealer. 
The threat of secondary exposure is 
consistently faced by one group in par-
ticular: Customs and Border Protection 
agents. CBP officers have seized over 
340,000 pounds of drugs this fiscal year, 
including 5,300 pounds of fentanyl. 
That is enough to kill 2.4 billion peo-
ple. 
Madam Speaker, today, I am calling 
on my colleagues to pass my bill to 
better protect those working to secure 
our borders: H.R. 5274, the Prevent Ex-
posure to Narcotics and Toxics Act. 
Known as the PREVENT Act, my bill 
would require CBP to issue contain-
ment devices to all frontline border se-
curity personnel and provide training 
on their proper use. 
Congress already requires CBP to 
provide Narcan to all officers at risk of 
secondary exposure, making this legis-
lation a simple but necessary extension 
of the tools we provide those who de-
fend our borders. Containment devices 
are a critical safety technology that al-
lows first responders to safely store 
fentanyl and other dangerous sub-
stances in a secure device. 
They not only protect agents from 
secondary exposure, but also better 
preserve narcotics for forensic anal-
ysis, improving the integrity of inves-
tigations and the chances of further 
legal action against traffickers. 
The crisis at our southern border has 
exploded to unprecedented levels, and 
with it, we have seen a shocking rise in 
the amount of fentanyl flowing into 
the United States. While those of us in 
Congress may differ on how we believe 
this crisis should be solved, we can 
agree that the men and women work-
ing to stop deadly drugs from reaching 
our communities deserve to be pro-
tected on this job. The PREVENT Act 
provides them with that protection. 
Madam Speaker, I am proud to have 
introduced this bill and will always 
have the backs of the CBP agents 
working to keep our country safe. 
These men and women put their lives 
on the line every day. The least Con-
gress can do is ensure they have what 
they need to do their jobs as safely as 
possible. 
Mr. 
SWALWELL 
of 
California. 
Madam Speaker, I yield myself such 
time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague 
across the aisle, Mr. JOYCE, a former 
prosecutor, someone who understands 
the importance of having the backs of 
law enforcement as they are on the 
frontlines in dealing with this deadly 
toxin. I, too, commend CBP for the 
hard work that they do every single 
day and the drugs that they are inter-
dicting to protect our communities. 
No doubt, fentanyl and other toxics 
have taken thousands of American 
lives. I can personally speak that in my 
family, we have seen a family member 
suffer through a fentanyl addiction. If I 
could wave a wand and get rid of all 
the fentanyl in the world, I would do it. 
Mr. JOYCE’s legislation makes sure 
that we are not exposing more people 
unnecessarily to it. 
Madam Speaker, the Centers for Dis-
ease Control and Prevention estimate 
that over 107,000 drug overdose deaths 
occurred in 2021, which is an increase of 
nearly 15 percent from 2020. And most 
of these originate overseas, primarily 
from China, who is not doing enough to 
stop the fentanyl leaving its borders. 
But the heroes of U.S. Customs and 
Border Protection interdict and seize 
opioids and other illicit drugs at our 
borders before they make their way 
into American communities, and we 
know that their exposure is extremely 
dangerous and could be fatal. 
When detecting or seizing opioids, 
frontline CBP personnel are at high 
risk of exposure to these substances 
through inhalation, ingestion, and skin 
contact. One way to prevent accidental

contact is through Mr. JOYCE’s legisla-
tion that would provide the use of con-
tainment devices. This legislation pro-
tects CBP officers and agents by ensur-
ing that those at risk of exposure have 
access to containment devices and, 
most importantly, understand how to 
use them. 
Last Congress, this body enacted 
Congresswoman YVETTE CLARKE’s Syn-
thetic Opioid Exposure Prevention and 
Training Act to protect CBP personnel 
from exposure to synthetic opioids. 
That law required CBP to implement a 
safety framework to protect its per-
sonnel from exposure to potential syn-
thetic opioids. 
We also enacted Congressman CLAY 
HIGGINS’ DHS Opioid Detection Resil-
ience Act to ensure CBP implements a 
strategy to detect synthetic opioids at 
lower purity levels. 
Together, these measures responded 
to concerns raised by the Department 
of Homeland Security’s Office of In-
spector General about the risk of acci-
dental narcotics exposure to frontline 
CBP personnel. 
Madam Speaker, consideration of 
H.R. 5274 is particularly timely as 
CBP’s fentanyl seizures continue to in-
crease. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues 
to support H.R. 5274, and I reserve the 
balance of my time. 
Mrs. 
MILLER-MEEKS. 
Madam 
Speaker, certainly, H.R. 5274 is a small 
step that we can take in managing the 
crisis at our southern border, in addi-
tion to emphasizing border security. I 
thank Representative JOYCE
for his 
very astute observation that our law 
enforcement is at risk and for his bill 
to help protect those who protect and 
serve us. 
Madam Speaker, I have no further 
speakers. I urge Members to support 
this bill, and I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
Mr. 
SWALWELL 
of 
California. 
Madam Speaker, I have no more speak-
ers, and I am prepared to close. 
Madam Speaker, I yield myself the 
balance of my time. Again, I thank Mr. 
JOYCE. I thank the other side for their 
bipartisan interest in this legislation. 
As I said, as the son of a police offi-
cer, a brother to a number of police of-
ficers—we are a law enforcement fam-
ily—and I see every day and hear from 
my family about the exposure they 
face, particularly those on the south-
ern border. 
Madam Speaker, I seek swift passage 
of this legislation, and I yield back the 
balance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from California (Mr. 
SWALWELL) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 5274. 
The question was taken. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the 
opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being 
in the affirmative, the ayes have it. 
Mr. ROY. Madam Speaker, on that I 
demand the yeas and nays.

ant to section 3(s) of House Resolution

Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, fur-

f 
QUESTION OF PERSONAL 
PRIVILEGE 
Mrs. GREENE of Georgia. Madam 
Speaker, I seek recognition for a ques-
tion of personal privilege. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair has been made aware of a valid 
basis for the gentlewoman’s point of 
personal privilege. 
The gentlewoman from Georgia is 
recognized for 1 hour. 
Mrs. GREENE of Georgia. Madam 
Speaker, I would like to address the 
House and talk about how I have been 
mistreated as a freshman Member of 
Congress and how crimes have been 
committed against me. They have been 
caught by the Capitol Police. They 
have been sent to the Department of 
Justice. The Department of Justice is 
refusing to prosecute these crimes. 
This is another example of the two- 
tiered justice system that we are living 
under right now under the Biden De-
partment of Justice and Democrat 
leadership. 
Now, I would like to go back to the 
beginning. 
Many news articles have reported 
that this has happened to me. But I 
would like to remind the House that 
starting on February 4, as a freshman 
Member of Congress, I was kicked off 
committees by the Democrat majority 
and 11 of my Republican colleagues, 
unfortunately. So I serve here as a 
Member of Congress without commit-
tees representing my district. But I 
have continued to work hard. 
I would also remind the House that 
on February 24, after we had voted on 
the Equality Act and we had been de-
bating back and forth, I had made 
many statements based on my beliefs, 
based on Biblical truths, based on the 
beliefs of my district that I represent, 
that there are only two genders: Male 
and female. And I stand firm on that. 
But my Democrat colleague across the 
aisle placed a trans flag across the hall 
from my office to apparently, maybe, 
shame me for my vote. 
That happened. 
Then in response to that, I simply 
put up a sign outside my office re-
sponding to the flag. But it continued 
on. 
There was also another incident on 
June 29 where one of my Democrat col-
leagues screamed at me in the Cannon 
tunnel, yelling and screaming at me for 
having a mask pulled down to my chin 
while I was talking on a Facebook live 
video. So all of it was caught on a 
video. 
That Member then went to the 
Speaker and claimed that I had at-
tacked her and was able to get her of-
fice moved because, apparently, she 
claimed I was a threat to her—where I 
was not—and she was given a security 
detail for her protection. 
Then there were 73 Democrat col-
leagues who introduced a resolution to 
expel me from Congress. 
I will tell you what that says. It sim-
ply says that, ‘‘Representative MAR-
JORIE
TAYLOR
GREENE, be, and she 
hereby is, expelled from the House of 
Representatives,’’ 
giving 
no 
reason 
whatsoever for this resolution, but yet, 
it is sponsored by 1 of my Democrat 
colleagues and cosponsored by 73 other 
Democrat colleagues. 
Yet, I have done nothing wrong. 
What else happened? Well, let’s go a 
little further. I have over $100,000 in 
mask fines. And then when I went be-
fore the House Committee on Ethics on 
these mask fines, four of the five 
Democrats on the House Committee on 
Ethics also had their names on this 
resolution to expel me from Congress. 
I asked them to recuse themselves, 
and 
they 
refused. 
Therefore, 
that 
wasn’t very fair. That is not fair treat-
ment. 
I have even had my character at-
tacked on the House floor, calling me 
horrendous names, horrible names, in-
sulting names that aren’t true about 
me at all, accusing me of things that I 
have never done, especially involving 
January 6. 
Then there was even an effort re-
cently to remove my name off of the 
ballot so that the people of my district 
couldn’t even vote for me. And that 
came from a Democrat leftwing group 
that was funded by Democrats. I beat 
that in court. 
All of this time, with all of these 
things happening, the media has pro-
moted all of it. And because of this, I 
have had nearly 60 official death 
threats, 21 direct death threats—and 
there is a man from New York cur-
rently on trial for threatening to kill 
me—19 indirect threats—these are basi-
cally death wishes and harassment— 
and 8 sexually related threats, individ-
uals that have made threats of sexual 
assault against myself and members of 
my family. 
I will give you a few examples. 
One person said, ‘‘I need to F-ing kill 
you.’’ 
Another one said, ‘‘Marjorie Greene 
should find a bullet in her head.’’ 
Another one said, ‘‘I can’t wait till 
you get raped until you are dead.’’ 
And another threat said, ‘‘I will come 
see you and your children’’—and it 
went on and on. 
Now, all during this time, I have re-
quested protection, saying I need help, 
I need protection. I don’t feel safe in 
these buildings. I don’t feel safe at all. 
And all of that has been denied. But I 
have watched many of my colleagues 
across the aisle in the majority party 
receive a lot of protection and help, but 
I have gotten none. 
I want to go through some things 
that happened just recently. This sign 
seems to upset people so much, but it 
is a simple truth. That is an example of 
what I believe based on my Christian 
faith, based on what the Bible says in 
Genesis—that God created us in His 
image, male and female. He created us. 
And this is also the majority belief of 
the people from Georgia’s 14th District.

This sign has been attacked repeat-
edly. As a matter of fact, it has been 
attacked 11 times. Nine times it has 
been vandalized, and twice it has been 
stolen. There has been a very specific 
series of attacks that have happened. 
There are seven of these. 
January 25, 2022, was the first report 
of this type of destruction. Instead of 
people writing on it or stealing the 
sign, this was where someone decided 
to put a sticker on the sign using Bible 
verses to attack my Christian faith and 
covering mostly the word ‘‘female.’’ 
The sign destruction continued. Each 
time we would replace it, the same 
thing would happen again. 
I want to remind everyone that this 
was when our House offices were still 
closed to the public. It was apparent 
that it was a staff member somewhere 
in our office building. 
Again, it showed up, another sticker 
attacking my Christian faith, mostly 
over the word ‘‘female.’’ It happened on 
February 1, 2022, then on February 2, 
2022, on February 22, and on February 
28. Each time, the stickers were placed 
on the sign attacking my Christian 
faith. Even if I wrote something back, 
it didn’t matter. Another sticker would 
appear. 
Every single attack had to do with a 
Bible verse, and it was directed at me, 
maybe even a sticker of a picture of 
Jesus that said: ‘‘I never knew you, 
MTG.’’ That was on the previous one. 
My staff and I had been commu-
nicating with the House Sergeant at 
Arms multiple times, but we were 
never getting a response. I had re-
quested cameras multiple times but 
was not getting any cameras. 
Finally, the House Sergeant at Arms 
came to my office, and I talked to 
them out in the hallway and was very 
loud in the hallway about my need for 
surveillance cameras because I have 
nothing to hide. 
I am perfectly fine with all the cam-
eras in this building and all the cam-
eras in Longworth, where my office is. 
Myself and my staff have nothing to 
hide, but clearly, there are other peo-
ple that do. 
I was demanding surveillance cam-
eras because this entire time this had 
been going on—at that point, it had 
been over a year. The person that was 
continually attacking the sign is also 
attacking me and is angry at me. I did 
not know if this was a person that I got 
in the elevator with alone. I did not 
know if this person was someone that I 
may be on an escalator with, passing in 
the hallway, passing on the stairwell. I 
didn’t know if this was a person that 
personally knew me or someone I had 
never talked to in my life. 
What I did know was the attacks 
kept coming. They would not stop. It 
was someone who worked in the build-
ing, and they clearly hated me. I felt 
very unsafe. I felt my life was in dan-
ger, especially with the amount of 
death threats that I receive against 
myself and my family and the com-
plete refusal from the Sergeant at 
Arms and leadership to provide me 
with any kind of security or protec-
tion. 
Finally, they put surveillance cam-
eras up. That was installed by the 
House Sergeant at Arms on March 4. 
Guess what? Additional destruction 
continued. It happened again on March 
10. How about that? Six days after the 
camera went up, the sign was attacked 
again, of course, against my Christian 
faith, attacking my religion, and al-
ways making sure it was somewhere 
covering the word ‘‘female’’ on the 
sign, attacking my gender. 
This time, on March 10, there hap-
pened to be a camera installed. The 
suspect was caught on camera on 
March 10, and again, he was caught on 
camera on March 11. Two times in one 
week, he was caught. Do you know 
what? They didn’t tell me who it was. 
They refused to tell me who this person 
was. 
They caught him on camera. They 
issued an arrest warrant to the Depart-
ment of Justice and the U.S. Attor-
ney’s Office on March 15 for destruc-
tion of public or private property under 
D.C. Code 22–3312.01. 
They caught him. They had it on 
video, knew who it was, and still re-
fused to tell me. No one would tell me 
who this person is. I am still living in 
fear of: Who is this person? Why are 
they doing this? Are they possibly one 
of the people threatening my life? 
To my extreme disappointment, I re-
ceived a phone call from the U.S. At-
torney’s Office, who I thought for sure 
when I got on the phone and it was a 
woman, I thought she might have some 
sympathy for what I am going through. 
She let me know that the U.S. Attor-
ney’s Office is declining to prosecute 
any charges against this person, and 
they would not be following through. 
Even though they have it on video— 
they know exactly who he is, and he 
has clearly broken the law—they didn’t 
want to prosecute it. 
This is from our Department of Jus-
tice, the same Department of Justice 
that is not prosecuting people that are 
harassing our Supreme Court Justices 
and breaking Federal law, the same De-
partment of Justice that is not keeping 
our borders safe, the same Department 
of Justice that is supposed to uphold 
all of our Federal laws for our country 
but not stopping the fentanyl crisis, 
and the same Department of Justice 
that isn’t prosecuting crime, appar-
ently, anywhere because crime is out of 
control. 
They don’t care about crime here in 
this place in Congress, in the Capitol 
complex. They only care about the peo-
ple that definitely came in and walked 
around on January 6. If you are one of 
those people, they are prosecuting you 
to the hilt. Some of them are rotting in 
the D.C. jail now. 
If you are a Republican Member of 
Congress and someone is stalking, 
harassing, attacking your gender, at-
tacking your religion, they drop the 
charges. You see, that is a two-tiered 
justice system. I can’t imagine why we 
are allowing that to happen. 
The problem here is all the American 
people are paying their taxes, and the 
Department of Justice is receiving 
their full budget, but the Department 
of Justice is only prosecuting crimes 
that matter to half the country. That 
is a two-tiered justice system. 
In order to have a justice system 
that is fair and good, and one that the 
American people can trust, it should be 
a justice system that prosecutes crime 
just because it is a crime, not based on 
a political party, not based on does it 
match up with the ideas or policies 
they agree with or the President that 
is in the White House or whoever is 
Speaker of the House or whoever is in 
leadership. It should matter that it is a 
crime, and they should prosecute these 
crimes. Unfortunately, that is not hap-
pening. 
I did find out who this person is, and 
it is reported in the news. I did find out 
that 
it 
is 
Representative 
JAKE 
AUCHINCLOSS’ chief of staff. His chief of 
staff is the person that has been con-
sistently attacking the sign, targeting 
me, and harassing me. 
This is a chief of staff. This isn’t a 
low-level staffer. This isn’t an intern. 
This is a chief of staff, who has had 
quite a career here working in this in-
stitution and who knows better. 
As a matter of fact, he fully believes 
that you shouldn’t harass anyone over 
their religion or their gender or their 
sex or any of these things. He defi-
nitely believes in hate crimes because, 
previously, when he worked at another 
Member’s office, when he was chief of 
staff in that office, there was a man 
that yanked down their pride flag out-
side their office, yanked it down and 
mistreated it. Well, Tim Hysom, the 
chief of staff at JAKE AUCHINCLOSS’ of-
fice, who has been targeting and 
harassing me, was so offended at that 
action that he and the other staff 
chased that man down the hall. They 
wanted the Capitol Police to arrest 
him and prosecute him. They wanted 
him prosecuted. 
Yet, Tim Hysom, chief of staff for 
JAKE
AUCHINCLOSS, feels he is com-
pletely above the law. He feels and says 
that my sign saying there are only two 
genders, male and female, he says it is 
a statement of hate, and, therefore, he 
is entitled to attack me for it. 
You see, that is complete hypocrisy. 
That is not the way this works. Why is 
one above the other? It shouldn’t be. I 
thought, in America, aren’t we all 
equal? Aren’t all of our beliefs pro-
tected? Isn’t our speech protected? 
Why is my religion under attack? Why 
is Christianity under attack? My belief 
in defending women’s and girls’ privacy 
rights in sports, why is that wrong yet 
it is okay for him to defend the pride 
flag and be angered and upset and want 
to arrest and prosecute someone when 
they attack it? It is a two-tiered jus-
tice system. 
This is a man that I don’t know; he 
doesn’t know me. I didn’t know who he

was until a few weeks ago. I had no 
idea. For a time, I have been in my of-
fice building many times late at night, 
but I don’t go there by myself anymore 
because of this man right here. 
I don’t know if he is one of the death 
threats that have called my office. I 
don’t know if he is one of the people 
that mail in disgusting, horrible things 
to me and my office. I don’t know what 
else he would do because he feels he is 
above the law and beyond reproach. 
I also don’t understand why his boss, 
Representative JAKE AUCHINCLOSS, still 
has him employed. I will tell you right 
now, if anyone in my office, if any of 
my staff, were to do what he has been 
doing to another Member of Congress, 
they would be fired. My staff would 
never do it. 
Since early on in our term, when my 
colleague across the hall from me at-
tacked me on Twitter by starting on 
my nameplate and turning the camera 
to herself where she planted the trans 
flag, no one in my office, none of my 
staff, has touched her flag, nor would 
we because we respect her freedom of 
speech and her right to have it there. 
We would not touch it. 
That is not how I have been treated. 
I have been treated much differently. I 
have been attacked over and over and 
over and over. 
Finally, when I got video surveil-
lance cameras, the Capitol Police did a 
great job. They caught him. They 
issued a warrant for his arrest, and 
they sent it to the Department of Jus-
tice, but the Department of Justice 
doesn’t care. Why? Probably because I 
am a Republican. 
We don’t have a Republican White 
House. We don’t have a Republican- 
controlled Congress. Why should Re-
publican 
Congresswoman 
MARJORIE 
TAYLOR GREENE matter? Apparently, I 
don’t matter. My safety doesn’t mat-
ter, and the beliefs of my district don’t 
matter, not to the Department of Jus-
tice. 
They have no interest in prosecuting 
Tim Hysom for attacking me seven 
times, twice caught on video. Nope. 
They don’t care because half the coun-
try doesn’t care. 
Let’s go a little bit further. There 
have been more things that have hap-
pened. I feel like it is almost like high 
school mean-girl behavior, but this is 
supposed to be Congress. 
We also had a situation on June 16, 
just last week. There was a certain 
film crew that works for Stephen 
Colbert who had been basically stalk-
ing me all day long, going throughout, 
following us around here. My staff was 
very helpful in putting me in the car 
and keeping me away from them. They 
ended up outside my office, and my 
staff took me somewhere else so I 
didn’t have to go there. 
Now, we find out that it was a cer-
tain Democrat Member who is serving 
on the January 6th Committee who let 
them in the buildings. When the Cap-
itol Police threw them out, it also hap-
pened 
to 
be 
Congressman 
JAKE 
AUCHINCLOSS’ and Tim Hysom’s staff 
that let them back in late at night. 
b 1500 
Madam Speaker, do you know whose 
office they were going to? 
Mine. My office. So this is more be-
havior where I don’t feel safe. I feel as 
if my life is constantly threatened. I 
am constantly harassed. This is no way 
for anyone to have to do work here. 
This place should not be run like this. 
This shouldn’t be allowed. 
Now, while the Select Committee to 
Investigate the January 6th Attack on 
the U.S. Capitol is currently accusing 
one of my colleagues, Representative 
BARRY LOUDERMILK, of giving tours— 
which is a lie about him. They are 
lying about him and saying that he did 
something he did not do. They, at the 
same time, were letting these people in 
all of our office buildings. We don’t 
even know where they all went. But 
they know, and the Capitol Police 
know. They were allowing them to go 
everywhere, as if they were doing some 
sort of insurrection. 
Why is that being allowed? 
Why do they get to have tours and 
free rein running all around the hall-
ways and attacking Members’ offices, 
but then we get accused of something 
horrible? 
This is wrong. 
Madam Speaker, do you know what 
people care about? 
People care about inflation; they 
can’t afford groceries; mothers can’t 
find baby formula; women can’t find 
tampons; people can’t afford gas; peo-
ple are so upset about crime; and peo-
ple are so upset that no one cares that 
we even have a border. These are the 
things that people care about. 
They don’t care about the petty and 
ridiculous garbage that happens in this 
place. But this is what we are dealing 
with because the Department of Jus-
tice will not prosecute any of these 
crimes. 
It is all about politics. 
Aren’t politics disgusting? I am so 
sick and tired of politics. 
The whole reason why I ran for Con-
gress is because I was upset that we are 
a Nation in debt that we will never be 
able to repay. I have three children—I 
hope to God I have grandchildren—and 
I don’t know what is going to happen 
to their lives. I was upset because our 
economy is so fragile and is at risk of 
crumbling. 
I was upset because our Nation had 
been shut down over a virus, and we 
should have never been shut down. 
I was upset because I feel as if we 
have the greatest country in the world, 
but it is this place that doesn’t respect 
it. I respect the American people far 
more than I respect this institution be-
cause the American people work their 
tails off. They pay their taxes. They 
balance their checkbooks, and they do 
everything they can to get by. 
But here we play political games 
where chiefs of staff who know better 
attack women over our religious be-
liefs and about the fact that we refuse 
to back down about there only being 
two genders. 
So if that is hate, if that is a com-
ment of hate, am I going to end up 
being locked away in jail somewhere? 
If so, Madam Speaker, you can put 
me in the dungeon, and I will still 
scream it from the pits of the dungeon 
of the jail because it is my belief and it 
is the truth. 
Women are under attack and girls 
are under attack. We have no more 
rights because any man who decides 
that he calls himself a woman can in-
vade our spaces. And any man—when 
we stand up against it—can attack us, 
and the Department of Justice will do 
nothing about it. What kind of Con-
gress is that? 
Aren’t we supposed to be the body 
that legislates the laws, creates the 
budget, and funds the Department of 
Justice? 
We are supposed to be. But, no, we 
are doing things like this. 
So I get to go here. I am here at work 
this week. Tim Hysom is still chief of 
staff 
for 
Representative 
JAKE 
AUCHINCLOSS. 
Representative 
ADAM 
SCHIFF—who is currently on the Select 
Committee to Investigate the January 
6th Attack on the U.S. Capitol and 
right now is lying about Republicans— 
who let in Stephen Colbert’s gang of 
seven Democrat activist film crew still 
has his committee. I don’t have com-
mittees. 
This isn’t how people should be treat-
ed. This isn’t right. 
Here is the other thing: It is not just 
I who feels this way. There are tens of 
millions of Americans—hundreds of 
millions of Americans—who agree and 
who are tired of it, sick and tired of it. 
So while this institution is making a 
mockery of itself with its Select Com-
mittee to Investigate the January 6th 
Attack on the U.S. Capitol, the Depart-
ment of Justice refuses to prosecute all 
of the BLM rioters. No. Their charges 
got dropped. 
Everyone who did come in here and 
riot—and by the way, I didn’t like it ei-
ther. I didn’t like it at all. It scared me 
a lot—but those people, oh, they have 
been charged. The Department of Jus-
tice will do that. 
But they won’t prosecute this man, 
and his boss won’t fire him. No. He gets 
to keep his job. 
Again, I want to remind you, Madam 
Speaker, if my staff—imagine—had at-
tacked my colleague across the hall, 
had attacked her trans flag, I cannot 
even imagine what would happen to 
them. Not only would I have fired 
them, they would have been arrested. 
They would probably still be in jail, 
and their names, their lives, and every 
detail of their life would be spread all 
over the news. People would know 
where they went to elementary school, 
they would know their mom and dad, 
and they would definitely know their 
address, I am sure. They would have 
their phone number, and they would 
see every social media post, text, mes-
sage or whatever. It would all be out 
there.

But, no, that is not how it works for 
us. And that is a two-tiered justice sys-
tem. 
The reason why I bring this up is the 
way that I have been treated—mis-
treated really—since I came here as a 
freshman Member of Congress—and I 
want to remind everyone that I have 
never been arrested. I have always paid 
my taxes. I have not broken the law. I 
have done nothing wrong. It is the ma-
jority party that doesn’t like my 
speech. That is it. 
So I have been kicked off commit-
tees. I have been routinely attacked. I 
have been lied about. My character has 
been completely destroyed, not only by 
people in here but the media definitely 
helps them. I have so many death 
threats that I have had to pay for my 
own personal security. Now the Depart-
ment of Justice will not prosecute 
someone when they are caught com-
mitting a crime against me, against 
my gender, and my religion. They have 
been attacking me over and over and 
over again. 
Do you know something, Madam 
Speaker? 
The way this place treats me is ex-
actly the way conservatives, Repub-
lican voters, and many Americans feel 
treated. They feel mistreated because 
this place only cares about itself. This 
place cares about what happens here 
and is so disconnected to farmers who 
are about to go out of business, moth-
ers who can’t find baby formula, and 
women who can’t find feminine prod-
ucts. 
All those border towns have been 
overrun, overrun, and overrun. They 
try to help the people so much. They 
can’t even help anymore. The crime is 
increasing. We are sending billions and 
billions of dollars over for a proxy war 
with Russia and some other country to 
protect their borders, but we won’t pro-
tect our own. The American people feel 
mistreated, the same way I feel mis-
treated. 
It is completely wrong. It needs to 
change. 
You see, Madam Speaker, this is a 
place where we should all be working 
together. It shouldn’t be hard for 
Democrats and Republicans to come up 
with a budget that serves our country. 
It shouldn’t be hard for us to work to-
gether to fund a Department of Justice 
that prosecutes crimes in America and 
crimes against Members of Congress. 
That should be something we care 
about. 
This shouldn’t be complicated; but 
somehow it is complicated, and it is all 
complicated because of the disgusting 
industry called politics. And that needs 
to change. 
We are going to hit a point one day 
where the American people are so sick 
of us, are sick of Congress, and are sick 
of what happens here. We are going to 
hit a point one day where the Amer-
ican people will not only be sick of us, 
but they just won’t trust us anymore. 
And do you want to know something, 
Madam Speaker? 
Madam Speaker, I don’t blame them 
one single bit. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.

NDO FAIRNESS ACT 
Mr. CICILLINE. Madam Speaker, I 
move to suspend the rules and pass the

that is seeking a warrant, order, or subpoena 
under section 2703, when it is not required to 
notify the customer or subscriber, or to the 
extent that it may delay such notice pursu-
ant to subsection (a), may apply to a court

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from 
Rhode Island (Mr. CICILLINE) and the 
gentleman from Ohio (Mr. JORDAN) 
each will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from Rhode Island. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. CICILLINE. Madam Speaker, I 
ask unanimous consent that all Mem-
bers have 5 legislative days to revise 
and extend their remarks and include 
extraneous material on H.R. 7072. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Rhode Island? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. CICILLINE. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, as a proud cospon-
sor, I rise in strong support of H.R. 
7072, the NDO Fairness Act, crucial bi-
partisan surveillance reform legisla-
tion that recently passed out of the Ju-
diciary Committee on a voice vote. 
This legislation would establish im-
portant guardrails for when the gov-
ernment seeks to access someone’s 
electronic 
communications 
without 
that person’s knowledge. Under current 
law, after the government obtains a 
court’s permission to search the con-
tents of a person’s electronic commu-
nications, prosecutors must then com-
pel the email service provider to 
produce the relevant data. To avoid 
having 
the 
service 
provider 
turn 
around and tell its customer about the 
search, the government can also ask 
the court to grant a nondisclosure 
order, colloquially referred to as a se-
crecy or gag order. 
Right now, there is no time limit to 
these orders. There is no standard to 
meet. All the government needs to do 
is cite one of five potential adverse re-
sults, with no showing that it is nec-
essary, and the court may grant the re-
quest. 
This bill requires the government to 
show and the courts to be convinced 
that the secrecy order is actually need-
ed, rather than allowing both to treat 
this as a check-the-box activity. Gag 
orders would be granted for a much 
shorter period of time, with the oppor-
tunity for extensions only as nec-
essary. When the orders expire or are 
no longer necessary, the government 
would need to provide to the customer 
the warrant, details regarding the 
search, and a copy of any information 
disclosed. 
Prosecutors frequently seek secrecy 
orders in cases where there is clearly 
no need and in situations where the 
government 
alone 
benefits. 
Unlike 
when a physical search occurs and a 
person has the right to go to court to 
dispute the warrant, NDOs can keep 
the subject of the search in the dark 
until a court reverses the order. In the 
21st century, Federal prosecutors no 
longer need to show up to your office. 
They just need to raid your virtual of-
fice secretly.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5700 
June 21, 2022 
The NDO Fairness Act would do away 
with that rubber stamp by ensuring 
that courts apply a strict scrutiny 
standard to government requests with 
a written determination explaining 
their reasoning. By time-limiting non-
disclosure orders, raising the standard 
of review, and ensuring that service 
providers have standing when they ob-
ject, H.R. 7072 inserts transparency, 
reason, and balance into a system that 
for too long has been a free-for-all for 
government prosecutors simply by vir-
tue of it being too easy to overuse. 
If history and recent reporting has 
taught us anything, it is that we can-
not trust the Department of Justice— 
under any administration—to police 
itself. It is imperative that the House 
of Representatives fulfill its role and 
ensure our laws are keeping pace with 
rapidly changing technology. 
Madam Speaker, I thank Chairman 
NADLER and Congressman FITZGERALD 
for their leadership on this bill and our 
friends, Senator LEAHY
and Senator 
LEE, for their leadership in the Senate. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to vote ‘‘yes’’ on the bill, and I 
reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, the NDO Fairness 
Act is a significant step in addressing 
the government’s overreach and abuse 
of nondisclosure orders, also known as 
gag orders. 
All too often, the government ob-
tains a court order to secretly demand 
the communications of American citi-
zens from third-party tech companies 
like Apple, Google, Microsoft, and 
Verizon. Through these orders, the gov-
ernment blocks these companies from 
alerting their customers or users that 
the government is looking through 
their emails and phone records. In 
other words, you don’t get to know. 
The frequency with which the gov-
ernment uses these orders to demand 
information is shocking. One company 
received 2,400 to 3,500 orders every year 
between 2016 and 2021. That is 7 to 10 
orders every day—every single day. 
Some of those orders do not contain an 
expiration. That means the govern-
ment is authorized to spy on Ameri-
cans’ private information indefinitely. 
Think about that, Madam Speaker. 
You may never know that the govern-
ment accessed and snooped on your 
most intimate information. 
More astoundingly, these nondisclo-
sure orders are often approved by a 
rubberstamp process for routine inves-
tigations without any real showing of 
the need for secrecy. 
This bipartisan bill ensures that our 
rights enshrined in the Constitution 
are protected from government over-
reach. The bill requires courts to issue 
written decisions as to why orders are 
necessary. It sets a 60-day limit for 
such orders and allows providers to 
challenge unjustified orders in a court 
of law. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
b 1515 
Mr. CICILLINE. Madam Speaker, I 
have no further speakers. I reserve the 
balance of my time. 
Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, I urge 
a ‘‘yes’’ vote, and I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. CICILLINE. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself the balance of my time. 
H.R. 7072 will insert due process pro-
tections into a system too often abused 
by Federal prosecutors. 
Under the Stored Communications 
Act, the government often has no obli-
gation to tell you that they have re-
quested access to your email records. It 
can prohibit your service provider from 
informing you of the search, even if 
your contract with the provider re-
quires such notice. 
The NDO Fairness Act will require 
that the government show a need for a 
gag order. It installs commonsense pro-
tections to ensure that any such orders 
are time-limited and subject to scru-
tiny for renewal. 
Madam Speaker, I encourage my col-
leagues to vote ‘‘yes’’ and pass this im-
portant legislation today, and I yield 
back the balance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from Rhode Island (Mr. 
CICILLINE) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 7072, as 
amended. 
The question was taken; and (two- 
thirds being in the affirmative) the 
rules were suspended and the bill, as 
amended, was passed. 
A motion to reconsider was laid on 
the table. 
f 
21ST CENTURY PRESIDENT ACT 
Mr. CICILLINE. Madam Speaker, I 
move to suspend the rules and pass the 
bill (H.R. 3285) to amend gendered 
terms in Federal law relating to the 
President and the President’s spouse. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 3285 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘21st Century 
President Act’’. 
SEC. 2. MODERNIZATION OF TERMS RELATING TO 
THE PRESIDENT AND THE SPOUSE 
OF A PRESIDENT. 
Section 879(b)(1)(A) of title 18, United 
States Code, is amended by striking ‘‘the 
wife of a former President during his life-
time, the widow of a former President until 
her death or remarriage’’ and inserting ‘‘the 
spouse of a former President during a former 
President’s lifetime, the surviving spouse of 
a former President until the surviving 
spouse’s death or remarriage’’. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from 
Rhode Island (Mr. CICILLINE) and the 
gentleman from Ohio (Mr. JORDAN) 
each will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from Rhode Island. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. CICILLINE. Madam Speaker, I 
ask unanimous consent that all Mem-
bers have 5 legislative days to revise 
and extend their remarks and include 
extraneous material on H.R. 3285. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Rhode Island? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. CICILLINE. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in strong sup-
port of H.R. 3285, the 21st Century 
President Act. 
A century ago, women in this coun-
try had only barely won the right to 
vote. Today, we have the first female 
Vice President, a female Speaker of the 
House, and record numbers of women 
running for Federal office. Although we 
still have a long way to go both in 
equality and representation, our coun-
try’s government is growing closer to 
finally representing our Nation’s bril-
liant diversity. 
Our laws must reflect the fact that a 
President and their spouse can be of 
any gender. That concept may have 
seemed impossible a few decades ago, 
but today it is, thankfully, a true and 
real possibility. 
Currently, our criminal code defines 
a spouse in the ‘‘immediate family’’ of 
a President as ‘‘the wife of a former 
President during his lifetime’’ and ‘‘the 
widow of a former President until her 
death,’’ implying that the spouse must 
be female and the President must be 
male in order for a threat against a 
former President’s family to be treated 
as a crime. 
This completely disregards the fact 
that a President may be female and the 
President’s spouse may not be. This 
does not reflect the progress we have 
made in this country. 
I am proud to vote ‘‘yes’’ for this bill, 
which passed out of this Chamber by a 
voice vote last Congress, and I encour-
age all of my colleagues to vote for its 
passage to support equality in our 
highest branch. 
Madam Speaker, I again thank my 
colleague 
and 
friend, 
Congressman 
POCAN, for introducing this bill and 
being such a strong advocate for it. I 
look forward to seeing it made law. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, the bill is simple. 
Under current law, it is a crime to 
issue threats against former Presi-
dents’ immediate family and certain 
other persons. 
Specifically, this bill replaces the 
words 
‘‘wife’’ 
and 
‘‘widow’’ 
with 
‘‘spouse’’ and ‘‘surviving spouse.’’ Both 
major parties have had women run for 
President, and this change makes 
sense. 
But while we are dedicating floor 
time to consider this minor technical 
change, President Biden’s inflation has 
hit a 40-year high; his border crisis has 
left our Nation woefully unsecure; and 
leftwing defund the police actions have

contributed to a crime wave that is 
plaguing our cities. 
Of course, this bill makes sense. It 
should be a crime to threaten the 
President or First Family. No one dis-
agrees with that. But this body needs 
to get its priorities straight. Where is 
the legislation to address the crisis at 
the border, or address the crime wave, 
or to do anything meaningful about in-
flation or the price at the pump? 
The bill is fine, but I hope that House 
Democrats will spend some time ad-
dressing the real issues that face the 
American people. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. CICILLINE. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from 
Wisconsin (Mr. POCAN), the author of 
this legislation. 
Mr. POCAN. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today in support of the 21st Century 
President Act, a bipartisan bill that I 
am glad to have authored and intro-
duced. 
Federal law hasn’t caught up to 
where progress in this country is, spe-
cifically when it comes to who a future 
President can be. 
This bill would change Federal law 
that refers to a President’s spouse. Sec-
tions that currently refer to a Presi-
dent’s ‘‘wife’’ or ‘‘widow’’ would be 
changed to ‘‘spouse’’ in recognition of 
the fact that, in the 21st century, the 
President could either be a woman or a 
person from the LGBTQ community. 
Without this change to the U.S. 
Code, for example, the law that makes 
it a crime to threaten, kill, kidnap, or 
inflict bodily harm upon the President 
or the President’s family would fail to 
include a future female or gay Presi-
dent and their potential spouse. 
This change is long overdue. Some-
day, there could be a President KAMALA 
HARRIS, or ELIZABETH WARREN, or AMY 
KLOBUCHAR, or TAMMY
BALDWIN, or 
Pete Buttigieg, or a President Nikki 
Haley, or Kristi Noem, or LIZ CHENEY. 
The words in law matter. It is criti-
cally important that Federal law rec-
ognizes that we could one day have a 
President who is not a man, or even a 
straight man, and that they and their 
families deserve equal protection under 
the law. 
I am glad that this bill passed the 
House by voice vote last Congress and 
that it has now been voted out of the 
Judiciary Committee twice on a voice 
vote. 
I personally thank Chairman NADLER 
and the Judiciary Committee for their 
support of this important bipartisan 
bill, and I urge all of my colleagues to, 
once again, support the 21st Century 
President Act. 
Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield back the balance of my time. 
Mr. CICILLINE. Madam Speaker, 
H.R. 3285, the 21st Century President 
Act, does indeed take our criminal code 
into the 21st century by removing gen-
der terms and assumptions about who 
can be President from our criminal 
code. 
It passed, as I said, on a voice vote 
last Congress. I ask my colleagues to 
again stand with me in supporting this 
legislation. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, I rise 
in support of H.R. 3285, the ‘‘21st Century 
President Act’’—an insightful, common-sense 
measure, of which I am an original cosponsor. 
In considering this bill, I think back to 1970 
when Representative Shirley Chisolm, speak-
ing on the need to ratify the Equal Rights 
Amendment, asked: ‘‘Why is it acceptable for 
women to be secretaries, librarians, and 
teachers, but totally unacceptable for them to 
be managers, administrators, doctors, lawyers, 
and Members of Congress?’’ At that time, it 
was almost unthinkable that a woman could 
be elected President of the United States. 
Although we have yet to ratify the ERA, our 
country has made great strides in the struggle 
for gender equality since then—from the 
groundbreaking presidential primary campaign 
of Representative Chisolm in 1972; to the first- 
of-its-kind vice presidential nomination of Ger-
aldine Ferraro; to the 18 million cracks in the 
glass ceiling made by Hillary Clinton; and the 
historic election of President Joe Biden and 
Vice President Kamala Harris, which began 
with a field that included six women and one 
member of the LGBTQ community. 
Given the diversity of candidates for the 
presidency in recent years and the more inclu-
sive times in which we live, our laws should 
evolve to reflect this societal progress. 
That is why H.R. 3285 amends section 879 
of title 18 to do away with the assumption that 
the president is male and his spouse female 
by removing gendered terms such as ‘‘wife’’ or 
‘‘widow.’’ 
I hope we can all agree that ‘‘immediate 
family’’ means much more today than the 
1982 law provides and that the spouse of our 
President should be protected regardless of 
gender. 
Indeed, we have come very far in the pur-
suit of gender equality since this statute was 
enacted. Yet H.R. 3285 makes clear there is 
still much work to be done. 
As we approach the 50th anniversary of the 
enactment of Title IX, women’s rights are once 
again under threat and the push for genuine 
gender equality-has been renewed. 
Each of us must remain vigilant and ensure 
that equality of rights under the law are neither 
denied nor abridged by the United States or 
by any state on account of gender in any 
manner. 
I thank the gentleman from Wisconsin, Rep-
resentative MARK POCAN, for his efforts to 
bring us into the 21st century and for recog-
nizing the importance of ensuring the safety 
and security of those who may come from the 
wide, vast diversity of America to serve as 
President. 
I urge my colleagues to join me in support 
of this bill and hope we can pass it by voice 
vote as we did in the 116th Congress. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from Rhode Island (Mr. 
CICILLINE) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 3285. 
The question was taken; and (two- 
thirds being in the affirmative) the 
rules were suspended and the bill was 
passed. 
A motion to reconsider was laid on

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from 
Rhode Island (Mr. CICILLINE) and the 
gentleman from Ohio (Mr. JORDAN) 
each will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from Rhode Island. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. CICILLINE. Madam Speaker, I 
ask unanimous consent that all Mem-
bers have 5 legislative days to revise 
and extend their remarks and include 
extraneous material on H.R. 6538. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Rhode Island? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. CICILLINE. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today in 
strong support of this bill, H.R. 6538, 
the Active Shooter Alert Act, bipar-
tisan legislation which I introduced 
with Congressman UPTON and 16 other 
original Republican and Democratic 
cosponsors to help keep our commu-
nities safer in the event of an active 
shooter. 
Between 2000 and 2020, there were 
close to 400 active shooter events, in-
cluding 40 active shooter incidents in 
2020 and 61 such incidents in 2021 alone. 
In 2016, in Congressman UPTON’s 
backyard, we saw a Michigan Uber 
driver go on a shooting rampage and 
then continue picking up passengers. 
In 2019, a shooter drove around a 
community in Texas, killing 7 and 
wounding 25 people. 
In 2021, a shooter traveled 30 miles, 
murdering eight people at various At-
lanta-area spas. 
Just this past April, a shooter at-
tacked a subway station full of people 
in Brooklyn and was then on the run 
for 24 hours before police finally de-
tained him. 
Such active shooters have become 
ubiquitous, so frequent that some of 
these horrific events barely make 
headlines. This is not normal, and we 
cannot let it become normalized. We 
cannot become numb to these events or 
settle for the status quo. We need to 
act now to make our communities 
safer, and that includes providing law 
enforcement with every tool they need 
to do so. 
Law enforcement has asked for ways 
to better alert their communities when 
active shooter incidents arise. This leg-
islation answers that call. 
The Active Shooter Alert Act creates 
an AMBER Alert-like program for ac-
tive shooter events. This bill will pro-
vide law enforcement with cutting- 
edge technology to send notifications

to our smartphones and let commu-
nities know if there is an active shoot-
er in a certain area so they know to 
stay away. 
The bill also instructs the Depart-
ment of Justice to consult with police 
safety experts, including officers who 
have responded to these incidents, to 
develop best practices and protocols for 
sending out these alerts. This will 
allow law enforcement to learn from 
each other as they adapt this alert sys-
tem to the needs of the communities, if 
they so choose. 
Developing this kind of technology 
and 
infrastructure, 
and 
identifying 
best practices, would be a massive un-
dertaking for many local police depart-
ments. 
Some 
communities 
simply 
don’t have the resources to do it on 
their own. However, we already have 
these resources at the Federal level. 
This legislation simply gives every 
law enforcement agency across the 
country the option to access the Fed-
eral alert system so they can send 
alerts in their area. 
Nothing in this bill is mandatory for 
law enforcement agencies to adopt, but 
it will provide access to an important 
tool for law enforcement departments 
across the country, regardless of their 
size or location. 
It is, sadly, becoming more and more 
necessary to have these protocols in 
place. As we have seen time and time 
again, when there is an active shooter 
situation, law enforcement does all 
they can to keep people in the sur-
rounding area safe, including going 
door to door to either evacuate or tell 
people to shelter in place. But that 
takes time, time that could cost lives. 
More than anyone, law enforcement 
understands the strain an active shoot-
er puts on a community in an ongoing 
crisis. In these stressful, life-or-death 
situations, law enforcement is too 
often, in many cases, relying on social 
media to communicate with the sur-
rounding community so that no one ac-
cidentally walks into the line of fire, 
including other members of law en-
forcement. 
Law enforcement deserves the best 
tools available, certainly better than 
Twitter, to communicate with their 
communities. 
Now, if you look at the after-action 
reports in so many of these active 
shooter incidents, they all recognize 
that it would have been so helpful to 
have a way to quickly and safely com-
municate with other members of law 
enforcement or the local community 
about an active shooter. 
I am proud that this bill has the en-
dorsement of law enforcement organi-
zations across the country at the na-
tional, State, and local levels and that 
it is a resoundingly bipartisan effort. 
I thank all of my colleagues on both 
sides of the aisle who have supported 
this commonsense measure and Mr. 
UPTON for leading this effort with me. 
I encourage a ‘‘yes’’ vote. 
Just to be clear, this is legislation 
endorsed by the National Sheriffs’ As-
sociation, the Fraternal Order of Po-
lice, the National Police Foundation, 
the National Association of Police Or-
ganizations, Major Cities Chiefs Asso-
ciation, National District Attorneys 
Association, and many other local law 
enforcement agencies. 
The men and women who are pro-
tecting our communities are saying 
they need this. It is bipartisan. I urge 
everyone to vote for it. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
The Active Shooter Alert Act is un-
necessary. It gives more authority to 
the Biden Justice Department, the 
most political Justice Department in 
history. 
States 
already 
utilize 
emergency 
alert systems to warn the public about 
natural and human-made disasters, ex-
treme weather events, active shooter 
situations, and other emergencies. Fed-
eral, State, and local officials already 
use the Integrated Public Alert and 
Warning System to send emergency 
alerts to mobile devices and to alert 
media platforms. 
According to a 2020 report from the 
Government 
Accountability 
Office, 
every State has at least one alerting 
authority, and there are more than 
1,400 alerting authorities across the 
country. 
If the States are already using an 
alerting system to notify the public 
about imminent threats, what is this 
bill really doing? What is this bill real-
ly about? This bill is creating a new 
Federal job at the Biden DOJ to en-
courage State and local governments 
to issue public alerts any time a fire-
arm is used to threaten anyone any-
where. 
Don’t take my word for it. During 
the markup, Congressman JONES ad-
mitted that: 
This bill would be most effective at re-
minding us that the threat of gun violence 
exists all around us, but it does little to ac-
tually protect us from it. 
That is right. This bill is about Dem-
ocrat fear-mongering that guns are 
ever-present threats, and we cannot be 
safe until Big Government rounds up 
every last gun. 
In fact, Congressman JONES went fur-
ther and called on the committee to 
consider another bill that would ban 
assault weapons. The Democrat chair 
of the committee followed up by voic-
ing his support for that very concept. 
No wonder the Democrats want to 
push forward a bill that will create a 
reminder that ‘‘the threat of gun vio-
lence exists all around us.’’ They want 
to create a culture of fear so they can 
achieve their ultimate goal, which is 
getting rid of the Second Amendment. 
b 1530 
If they really wanted to improve 
emergency alerts for active shooters, 
we would be moving a bill to improve 
the IPAWS wireless emergency alerts 
that are sent to mobile devices. 
In a recent report, GAO stated that 
local alerting officials had expressed 
concerns about the inability to target 
WEA alerts with accuracy, which made 
local officials reluctant to even use the 
system at all. 
They have got a system out there. 
Let’s improve the system and alert 
people to emergencies, not have legis-
lation that is about ultimately under-
mining the Second Amendment. 
We could have had hearings. We 
could have received expert testimony. 
We could have been able to fully vet 
this initiative. This legislation is sim-
ply another failed attempt by Demo-
crats to ‘‘do something’’ about the 
surge in violence and crime across the 
country. 
If we need to do something, we 
should start by supporting law enforce-
ment and the rule of law instead of de-
monizing our police and actively en-
couraging illegal entry into this coun-
try. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. CICILLINE. Madam Speaker, I 
am pleased to yield 2 minutes to the 
distinguished gentlewoman from Penn-
sylvania (Ms. DEAN), an important 
member of the House Judiciary Com-
mittee. 
Ms. DEAN. Madam Speaker, I thank 
the chairman for yielding time. 
Like many of you, I am struggling as 
we see day after day, night after night, 
more lives lost to gun violence in 
America. 
On Sunday, a 15-year-old boy was 
killed and three other people shot in a 
mass shooting 15 minutes from where 
we stand right now. 
On Monday, just after midnight, a 21- 
year-old college student was killed in a 
hail of gunfire that also wounded eight 
others in Harlem. 
Last week, in the Judiciary Com-
mittee, I talked about the three young 
men who were killed and 11 wounded in 
the single biggest shooting in Philadel-
phia in 7 years. Are we safe anywhere 
in this country anymore? 
Many of us are determined to fight 
for radical change to combat a dan-
gerous obsession with guns and gun vi-
olence. 
In the Judiciary Committee, we 
voted for extreme risk protection or-
ders. Republicans in that committee 
voted ‘‘no.’’ We voted to raise the age 
for purchase of semiautomatics to 21. 
Republicans said ‘‘no.’’ We voted to 
safely store guns. Republicans said 
‘‘no.’’ We voted to get rid of ghost 
guns. Republicans said ‘‘no.’’ We voted 
for background checks. Republicans 
said ‘‘no.’’ 
Now, today, we are trying to pass 
text alerts—alerts—for active shooters. 
I am thankful that this small measure 
has some bipartisan support. 
Yet, some Republicans in Congress 
support guns so much that they will 
find a way to say ‘‘no’’ and hide behind 
the Second Amendment. 
I am struggling, but determined, in-
spired by the overwhelming number of

Americans who are demanding action: 
Republicans, Democrats, gun owners, 
non-gun owners, independents. Demand 
action, not excuses. 
This is a sad, yet important step. I 
thank the chairman for bringing it for-
ward. I urge my colleagues across the 
aisle to wake up. Our children’s lives 
are at stake every day. 
Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, I 
would point out, we are not trying to 
hide behind the Second Amendment— 
we are trying to defend it. We are de-
fending it. 
It is an important part of our Bill of 
Rights, an important part of our Con-
stitution. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to 
the gentleman from Kentucky (Mr. 
MASSIE), no better defender of the Sec-
ond Amendment, and the co-chair of 
the Second Amendment Caucus. 
Mr. MASSIE. Madam Speaker, I 
thank Ranking Member JIM JORDAN for 
yielding the time. 
You know, I find it interesting that 
all across the country, Democrats are 
moving to defund the police. Here, 
today in Congress, we have a bill called 
the Active Shooter Alert Act of 2022. 
Well, if they defund the police, a 
more appropriate title for this bill 
would be the you are on your own act 
of 2022. Yes, that is right. We think you 
are in danger, but nobody is coming to 
help you because we have defunded the 
police. 
But what does this bill really do? 
You know, if it were anything other 
than an attempt to demonize guns, to 
panic people, it would cover things like 
stabbing, car violence. How come we 
never hear about car violence? It would 
cover all violence, but they have cho-
sen to single out the Second Amend-
ment and firearms. 
The technology already exists to do 
this, and the States that want to do it 
have already done it, and the campuses 
across the country that want to do it 
have implemented this a decade ago. 
So, why are we doing this at the Fed-
eral level? What is the purpose to take 
what would have been good ideas at the 
State level, bring them up here, laun-
der them, and then go tell the States 
how they have to do it, even though 
they are already doing it in many 
cases? 
What good does a one-size-fits-all bill 
do when you dictate from D.C.? 
You know, rural Kentucky is not like 
urban Chicago. If you hear a gun go off 
in rural Kentucky, your first instinct 
is not to panic. 
Now, if your phone comes on and 
tells you that you need to panic, you 
might be inclined to do that. But when 
you hear a gun go off in Kentucky, you 
assume somebody is hunting. You as-
sume they are target practicing. They 
are doing something that is lawful. 
In maybe 1 out of 10,000 cases that it 
is not, it is just somebody poaching a 
deer, probably, but it ain’t nothing to 
panic about. That is what they want 
you to do. 
You know, it is different when you 
hear a gun in Kentucky than when you 
hear one in downtown Chicago, which 
gets me to the point: Can you turn this 
system off in Chicago? 
Is anybody going to be able to sleep 
in a Democrat-controlled city where 
crime is rampant, where they are mov-
ing to defund the police? How will you 
get to bed? 
Every few hours, there is violence in 
Chicago, or pick your favorite big city 
run by a big, liberal Democrat where 
they have the strongest gun bans in the 
country. They have more violence than 
anywhere else. 
So can you turn it off? That would be 
my first question for those poor folks 
in Chicago that have to deal with the 
sort of public policy that Democrats 
have advanced. 
Now, one of the questions that came 
up in our committee that was never an-
swered: Is this going to tell you after 
the fact, after the shooting has hap-
pened, or will it alert you to one that 
they think is about to happen? 
We asked, and I asked the bill’s spon-
sor multiple times: Does it do that, or 
does it just tell you after something 
has already happened? He didn’t know. 
He wouldn’t answer. I doubt he will 
give us a straight answer here today, if 
he chooses to answer. 
So what good is it if it is going to tell 
you after it has already happened? 
So, you know, here is what you have 
to wonder. Every time there is a bill in 
Congress, it has a great name. At first, 
it sounds like a great idea. Then when 
you dig into it, well, somebody has al-
ready done it, and it probably is al-
ready done at the State level. 
So, for instance, there are a couple 
other bills that they passed a couple 
weeks ago that are already being done. 
They passed a bill that would ban gun 
trafficking. Well, the problem is, that 
is already banned. 
So what you have to do is dig down 
and say: Why are they passing another 
bill? What does this bill do that the one 
that exists doesn’t already do? 
Well, we found out it would prosecute 
domestic violence victims if they ac-
quire a firearm for their protection 
from a neighbor. Well, that doesn’t 
sound like a good idea to me, but the 
name of the bill sounded pretty good 
until you dug down into it. 
The same thing for red flag laws. 
There is a version of involuntary com-
mitment in all 50 States that already 
exists, but the difference is there is due 
process. So why are they doing a shoot-
er alert bill here, an active shooter 
alert bill? 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman’s time has expired. 
Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield an additional 1 minute to the 
gentleman 
from 
Kentucky 
(Mr. 
MASSIE). 
Mr. MASSIE. So why are they pass-
ing a law to do something that is al-
ready being done? Well, they want to 
take Federal control, and then what 
are they going to do with that Federal 
control? They want to panic and scare 
the general public with their phones. 
Everybody has got one today. You 
won’t be able to turn it off. 
Oh, no. Be afraid of a gun. Be afraid 
of a gun. Here is another alert. Be 
afraid of a gun. 
That is so they can advance their 
other agenda, their real agenda, which 
is to ban all guns and to effectively re-
peal the Second Amendment. 
Mr. CICILLINE. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
I will make a couple of points quick-
ly. This legislation has nothing to do 
with limitations on the Second Amend-
ment. It has nothing to do with red 
flag laws. It has nothing to do with this 
claim of defunding the police. 
I have lots of material for the 
RECORD that shows police departments 
have been cut in other communities led 
by Republican mayors and Republican 
Governors. Let’s not have that debate. 
This is about a simple provision that 
will save lives. 
With all due respect to my colleagues 
who claim they understand what this 
legislation is about, I trust the judg-
ment of the men and women who are 
actually going into active shooter situ-
ations. I don’t think there is a single 
Member who has spoken who has been 
responsible for responding to an active 
shooting incident. I think it is time we 
respect the men and women who actu-
ally do that every day. 
The men and women of law enforce-
ment are pleading for this legislation 
to help keep them safe, as well as the 
communities they serve. I won’t be so 
presumptuous, 
Madam 
Speaker, 
to 
think I have better judgment on that 
question than they do. That is why 
they have all endorsed this bill. 
The third thing I will say: Mr. 
MASSIE said, Madam Speaker, that this 
question wasn’t answered. I will answer 
it again, the same way I answered it in 
committee. 
The standards are established by law 
enforcement. Active shooter alerts al-
ready exist in some States and in some 
local communities. There are a set of 
protocols. 
Obviously, they don’t wait until the 
shooting has concluded to notify peo-
ple. They use common sense, their own 
standards about when they see a dan-
ger; someone with a gun that is ex-
pressing some intention to use it or 
whatever standard they consider appro-
priate as members of law enforcement 
to alert the community. This is com-
mon sense. 
The problem is, there are a lot of 
small departments that don’t have the 
ability to access this system or to un-
derstand best practices or to see the re-
search about how it is used most effec-
tively. This would allow them to have 
access to that. 
Not a single jurisdiction that doesn’t 
want to use it is required to. There is 
no Federal Government power here. It 
is making it available. If you decide as 
a local law enforcement agency or 
State you don’t want to use it, you 
don’t have to, but it is making it avail-
able. This will save lives.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5705 
June 21, 2022 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, such 
irony. 
Democrats 
lecturing 
Repub-
licans on law enforcement and respect 
for law enforcement. This from the 
party who spent an entire summer 
talking about defunding the police, 
who had elected officials in this body, 
Democrats in this body, raise money to 
bail out the rioters and looters who 
they called peaceful protesters who 
were attacking police, and now he is 
going to lecture Republicans on respect 
for law enforcement. I mean, you can’t 
make it up. This is how the Democrats 
operate today. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to 
the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. 
UPTON). 
Mr. UPTON. Madam Speaker, I thank 
my colleague from Ohio for yielding 
time. 
You know, a few years ago in this 
building, the U.S. Capitol, we had an 
active shooter. I was there. Tragically, 
he killed two brave Capitol Police offi-
cers as the shooter tried to hunt down 
our Republican whip, Tom DeLay. 
We were in session. The shooter was 
just down the stairs. During that ram-
page, the House adjourned for the end 
of the week. Like every week, just like 
last week, a bunch of us bounded down 
those steps, got in our cars, raced to 
the airport to get home to our dis-
tricts. We had no clue what was going 
on down the hall in the Capitol. 
When I got to DCA, I was shocked to 
see how close the shooter got to, real-
ly, all of us, particularly if he had just 
stood at the bottom of the stairs and 
just sprayed us as we were coming 
down. 
We had no clue what was going on. 
We also had no information from our 
phones or from our beepers in terms of 
what was going on. 
Well, times have changed. We have 
that capability today. Every major law 
enforcement organization supports this 
bill. This helps an active shooter alert 
system so that potential victims can be 
alerted when there is an active shooter. 
I would just note in the last 2 hours, 
all of us here got four messages from 
the Capitol Police saying that there 
was a suspicious package outside of the 
Cannon House Office Building. 
Literally, Independence Avenue was 
shut down, closed to all traffic because 
of the alerts that we were able to get. 
Shouldn’t our constituents enjoy the 
same technology that we have here in 
our own Congress? 
You know, Madam Speaker, this sim-
ple bill will support law enforcement 
and keep our communities safe, period. 
In 2016, in Kalamazoo, in my district, 
an Uber driver spent nearly 5 hours one 
night picking up riders, killing them, 
picking up another rider, killing them, 
until he was finally apprehended. 
When that rampage was over, more 
than six people died. Another two were 
injured. There was no system like this 
that could inform the citizens in down-
town Kalamazoo about what was going 
on. 
In after-action reports from mass 
shootings and others around the coun-
try since Columbine in 1999, they have 
all recommended a system like this, to 
create an Active Shooter Alert Act. 
This bill was the top request from tens 
of thousands of police officers who at-
tended Police Week just a couple of 
weeks ago. 
This bill has nothing to do with the 
Second Amendment; doesn’t take away 
guns, nor should it. It protects inno-
cent people who might be impacted by 
an active shooter, whether it be our 
kids, our loved ones, or our fellow citi-
zens. 
Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. CICILLINE. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman from Michigan 
for his thoughtful words. 
I also want to mention that some of 
my colleagues earlier in the debate 
said creating this is going to create a 
fear of shooting. That is what Demo-
crats are really up to, and the 15 or 16 
Republicans that are the original co- 
sponsors of this bill. 
Well, I would ask one question: When 
we created the AMBER Alert to help 
families find a child who is lost, or the 
Silver Alert, it didn’t create any great 
fear. It effectively made sure when sen-
iors were lost, they were found. When 
children were lost, they were found. So 
that is a specious argument. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
b 1545 
Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from 
North 
Carolina 
(Mr. 
BISHOP), 
my 
friend. 
Mr. 
BISHOP 
of 
North 
Carolina. 
Madam Speaker, I often think it is 
helpful to think about what Americans 
must be thinking as they watch de-
bates here on this floor. 
In this instance, I am sure that 
Americans think, as Mr. MASSIE sug-
gested, and as I just have been think-
ing and was thinking in our markup: 
Aren’t we already doing this? Aren’t 
there alert systems that go out all the 
time for times when a child has been 
abducted, an elderly person has gone 
missing, all sorts of things? 
Sure enough, Federal, State, and 
local officials already use the Inte-
grated Public Alert and Warning Sys-
tem, IPAWS, to alert the public to 
emergency situations. Government of-
ficials use the IPAWS Wireless Emer-
gency Alert, the WEA—a lot of acro-
nyms, sure; it is government—to send 
emergency alerts to mobile devices and 
use the Emergency Alert System, EAS, 
to alert media platforms. 
According 
to 
FEMA, 
‘‘Imminent 
threat 
alerts 
include 
natural 
or 
human-made disasters, extreme weath-
er, active shooters, and other threat-
ening emergencies that are current or 
emerging.’’ 
So, wait a minute, active shooters 
are already specifically covered by 
FEMA under the existing alert system? 
So, what is going on? 
A hint emerged in our committee 
markup when the gentleman from Cali-
fornia (Mr. ISSA) offered an amendment 
to broaden the name of the bill, not 
just to cover active shooters. The gen-
tleman 
from 
Rhode 
Island 
(Mr. 
CICILLINE) opposed the amendment— 
not only opposed it, but he termed Mr. 
ISSA’s proposal offensive. Now, we are 
getting to it. 
The gentlewoman from Pennsylvania 
(Ms. DEAN), who spoke a moment ago, 
called it gun legislation. An alert sys-
tem is gun legislation? 
It comes down to another messaging 
opportunity—doesn’t it?—the yearning 
to sensationalize an admittedly awful 
problem. But I have to say to my fel-
low Members of the House of Rep-
resentatives, 
sensationalizing 
this 
problem is not a solution to it. 
The examples given by Ms. DEAN on 
the floor today she herself said re-
flected her desire for radical change, 
but all of her examples avoided the 
topic at hand, this alerting system. 
How would a redundant emergency 
alerting system of national scope have 
impacted the Juneteenth day shooting 
on 14th Street here in the District of 
Columbia or the shooting last week, a 
gang-related shooting in Philly? How 
would an alerting system have changed 
that? 
Here is what I would say to the Mem-
bers on the other side: You are still not 
grappling with the real issue. The 
Juneteenth shooting did not occur be-
cause the existing public alerting sys-
tems were inadequate nor because, in 
fact, guns are available or even preva-
lent, as they have always been in the 
United States since its founding. 
If you do not address what has 
changed, your efforts will only grow 
government and reduce freedom. 
Mr. CICILLINE just said, well, small 
police departments don’t have the re-
sources to access alerting systems or 
to learn about best practices. Really? I 
was in the State legislature in North 
Carolina. I know what resources we 
made available. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentleman has expired. 
Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield an additional 1 minute to the 
gentleman from North Carolina. 
Mr. 
BISHOP 
of 
North 
Carolina. 
Madam Speaker, we would never fail to 
make available—and it is not beyond 
the resources of any State in this 
Union—public alerting systems and to 
consider such issues as whether or not 
we wish to activate vigilantes who 
might respond to such an alert. 
This makes no sense. You are not 
grappling with the issue. For that rea-
son, this is not the answer. It should be 
defeated. 
Mr. CICILLINE. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, I will respond brief-
ly to the last speaker suggesting that 
somehow this isn’t going to solve all 
the problems of gun violence. No one 
suggested it is.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5706 
June 21, 2022 
This is a simple bill that is intro-
duced to protect law enforcement and 
members of the community when an 
active shooter happens. We can con-
tinue to fight about how we should re-
duce gun violence, but when it occurs, 
this will save lives. It is not intended 
to be the solution, the big answer to 
everything. It is intended to save lives. 
I will repeat again—with all due re-
spect to my Republican colleagues who 
think they are experts in policing, who 
think they know better than law en-
forcement what they need when they 
run into danger—it is easy to say that 
in the comfort of the House Chamber, 
where you are protected by Capitol Po-
lice and you get alerts. 
These are men and women who are 
running into bullets and communities 
that are threatened. You raised what 
happened on 14th Street. A young man 
who works for me received a notice 35 
minutes after the scene was cleared 
through his Ring security system in 
his building that there was an active 
shooter. Had there been one in place, 
he would have been notified and not 
walked into danger. 
You have the National Sheriffs’ Asso-
ciation, the FOP, and others saying 
this will be very helpful. These are peo-
ple who, admittedly, actually are re-
sponsible 
for 
keeping 
communities 
safe, unlike anyone who just spoke on 
the Republican side. They say it will 
help us keep communities safe. 
The CEO of the National Sheriffs’ As-
sociation said: ‘‘This alert system will 
be another excellent tool for law en-
forcement to do its job.’’ 
Bryan Porter from the National Dis-
trict Attorneys Association: ‘‘This bi-
partisan legislation creates a new alert 
system for law enforcement to alert 
the public when there are active shoot-
ers while also providing resources as 
our members work to keep our commu-
nities safe.’’ 
Jeri Williams, president of the Major 
Cities Chiefs Association: ‘‘ . . . which 
will undoubtedly be a valuable tool and 
resource for law enforcement agen-
cies.’’ 
Bill Johnson, the National Associa-
tion of Police Organizations: ‘‘The Ac-
tive Shooter Alert Act will assist law 
enforcement in alerting citizens of an 
active shooter situation in their vicin-
ity, keeping them away from the inci-
dent and maintaining their safety.’’ 
Finally, Patrick Yoes, the national 
president of the Fraternal Order of Po-
lice: This bill will help ‘‘improve the 
ways officers and agencies commu-
nicate with the public about active 
threats.’’ 
I could read 10 more quotes from peo-
ple who actually do this work. 
The North Carolina Association of 
Chiefs of Police has also endorsed this 
bill, which I think should be important 
to Mr. BISHOP, who just spoke. 
Look, these are men and women who 
do the job every day, and they are say-
ing they need this, that it will be use-
ful. It doesn’t solve all the problems, 
but it works, and the notion that, 
‘‘Well, you can just do it. It is redun-
dant,’’ it is just not true. 
This bill has in it provisions that will 
provide for the development of proto-
cols, the sharing of best practices, a 
law enforcement advisory group, things 
that will make sure the active shooter 
alert works even better. It is made 
available to communities that may not 
have all those resources to support the 
implementation of this system. 
Can anyone say that every single 
American doesn’t deserve to get this 
information, and every member of law 
enforcement doesn’t deserve to get this 
information, so they don’t go into a 
dangerous situation? 
I know it is difficult because you 
somehow have it in your head that 
Democrats are up to something. FRED

MCKINLEY, and JULIA LETLOW are all 
Republican original cosponsors. Do you 
think they are up to something, too? 
They are just trying to keep their com-
munities safe and give law enforcement 
the tools they need. 
We can argue about the underlying 
cause of crime. I am happy to have 
that debate. This bill is not about that. 
It is about protecting people when an 
active shooter incident happens. 
The final thing I would say is, if you 
look at the after-action reports that 
are done after active shootings, almost 
without exception, they all reference 
that it would have made a real dif-
ference if we had a good communica-
tion system. 
In the situation Mr. UPTON talked 
about in Kalamazoo, in their after-ac-
tion report, they said neither the Kala-
mazoo Department of Public Safety 
nor the Kalamazoo County Sheriff’s Of-
fice ‘‘had a strong social media pres-
ence at the time of the shooting,’’ 
which ‘‘hampered the departments’ 
ability to update the community on 
the progression of the incident, notify 
them when the arrest was made, and 
reassure them that they were indeed 
safe from further violence.’’ 
In the Columbine shooting, in the 
after-action 
report, 
they 
say: 
Our 
schools’ greatest vulnerabilities exist 
because of voids in basic security poli-
cies and strategies, such as effective 
communications and notification sys-
tems. 
In the Broward County incident at 
the Hollywood airport in 2017, they 
write in their after-action report: ‘‘Re-
view and budget for improvements to 
public notification systems, including 
visual 
paging, 
overhead 
announce-
ments, and mass notification systems’’ 
would be helpful. It was noted during 
the event that airport patrons lost per-
sonal items except one, their cellular 
phones. The ability to reach every cell 
phone with messages enables law en-
forcement to provide instant informa-
tion directly to victims. It goes on and 
on and on. 
Again, police are asking for this. The 
after-action reports underscore 
the 
need for it. 
Set aside the fact that the lead spon-
sor or the author is me. There are 15 
other Democrats, 15 other Republicans, 
very bipartisan, and I haven’t heard 
any argument why we shouldn’t give 
law enforcement what was identified as 
one of their top priorities during Na-
tional Police Week. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Mem-
bers are reminded to address their re-
marks to the Chair. 
Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself the balance of my time to 
close. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to vote ‘‘no.’’ 
First, as the gentleman from North 
Carolina said, this bill is redundant. 
There are 1,400 alerting authorities 
across the country that already alert 
citizens in those communities to an ac-
tive shooter, so it is redundant. 
Second, it does seek to undermine 
the Second Amendment. Don’t take my 
word for it. Take one of the Democrat 
supporters of the legislation on the Ju-
diciary Committee. Here is what he 
said: 
This bill would be most effective at re-
minding us that the threat of gun violence 
exists all around us, but it does little to ac-
tually protect us. 
You have to view it in context. Re-
member, the last 4 weeks, all Demo-
crats have talked about is taking away 
people’s Second Amendment liberties. 
We have this huge debate going on in 
the Senate right now, red flag laws 
where you have no due process. Some-
one who doesn’t like you comes and 
says, ‘‘We are going to take away so- 
and-so’s firearm,’’ and goes to a judge 
or law enforcement to take away their 
firearm. There is a hearing you are not 
allowed to be at. They take it away, 
and then you have to go get it back. 
Your fundamental liberty, taking your 
property, your rights from you, this is 
the context with which they bring this 
legislation. 
The third reason, I don’t know who in 
their right mind would want to give 
the Department of Justice more au-
thority in light of what we have seen 
from 
this 
Department 
of 
Justice. 
Frankly, I don’t know why you would 
give any Democrat-run Department of 
Justice more authority after what we 
have seen from the Obama Justice De-
partment and now what we see from 
the Biden Justice Department. 
The Obama Justice Department spied 
on Presidential campaigns. The Biden 
Department of Justice is treating 
moms and dads as terrorists, using do-
mestic 
terrorism, 
counterterrorism 
measures, the PATRIOT Act, against 
parents, for goodness sakes. 
We know that because we have had 
multiple FBI agents come forward as 
whistleblowers and tell us about the

over two dozen investigations into par-
ents. One of those parents was inves-
tigated simply because they owned a 
firearm. That is the context and why 
we have concerns with this legislation. 
I hope we vote ‘‘no’’ on this. More 
importantly, I hope the Senate doesn’t 
pass this package they are talking 
about, which would certainly under-
mine liberties of law-abiding American 
citizens. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. CICILLINE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself the balance of my time to close. 
Mr. Speaker, if I were a classroom 
teacher right now, I would say to the 
gentleman from Ohio: Focus. Focus. 
Pay attention to what we are talking 
about. 
What we are talking about is an ac-
tive shooter alert. We are not talking 
about a red flag bill. We are not talk-
ing about any effort to undermine the 
Second Amendment. We are not talk-
ing about education policy. We are 
talking about one thing: Can we help 
keep people safe? 
This is not redundant because while 
it is being used by 1,400 cities and 
towns around the country, there are 
thousands and thousands who have not 
used it because they can’t access it be-
cause they don’t have the resources, 
the protocols, the best practices. This 
will allow them. 
If we save one life, if because of the 
active shooter alert we save one child, 
one police officer, it will have been 
worth it. 
I urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘yes’’ 
on H.R. 6538. Give our brave law en-
forcement men and women who keep 
our communities safe every tool they 
need to keep themselves safe and keep 
the communities they serve safe. Don’t 
take my word for it; take theirs. They 
have all endorsed it. They are asking 
for a ‘‘yes.’’ 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in 
support of H.R. 6538, the ‘‘Active Shooter 
Alert Act of 2022.’’ 
In recent weeks, months, and years, we 
have mourned the loss of life resulting from an 
ever-increasing number of active shooter inci-
dents where perpetrators committed mass 
shootings in multiple locations. 
Communities in every corner of this country 
have been subjected to the fear and uncer-
tainty created by active shooters in their midst. 
Last year, there were 61 active shooter inci-
dents in the United States. Approximately 27 
of those incidents involved an active shooter 
moving from one location to another. 
For instance, 8 people were killed roughly 
30 miles apart at three spas in the metro At-
lanta area last year. The gunman was later 
apprehended some 150 miles south of Atlanta. 
And we are all still reeling from the grue-
some murder of 19 fourth graders and two 
teachers in Uvalde, Texas that began when 
the perpetrator shot his grandmother in the 
home they shared. 
He then drove away, crashing his vehicle 
outside Robb Elementary. He encountered 
several people before entering the school and 
committing unspeakable acts on those help-
less children and teachers. 
While the actions of these individuals and 
other active shooters are unacceptable and re-
quire Congress to enact measures to put an 
end to such evil acts, we must also be pre-
pared if these situations occur, and do all we 
can to help law enforcement save more lives. 
Law enforcement’s response to an active 
shooter is a dynamic situation—oftentimes 
chaotic—that involves many variables, re-
quires swift, consequential decision-making, 
and places great strain on law enforcement 
command staff and their officers on the 
ground. 
Their goal is to save the lives of victims and 
prevent others from unknowingly entering the 
area or walking into the line of fire—at all 
times focusing on containing, neutralizing, and 
apprehending the shooter. 
Centers of higher learning and primary edu-
cation, businesses, local jurisdictions, and law 
enforcement agencies have already imple-
mented some systems to alert students, em-
ployees, patrons, and community members of 
the presence of an active shooter, and to help 
manage the response, and provide updates 
about the ongoing crisis via text message and/ 
or social media. 
Many of these systems face low enrollment 
and messaging delays that sometimes con-
tribute to confusion around the incident. In the 
case of social media—insufficient account visi-
bility means fewer people are made aware of 
an existing threat to their safety. 
Recently here in Washington, D.C. a sniper- 
style attacker set a rifle on a tripod and fired 
randomly at passersby walking below his win-
dow. 
D.C. Metro Police used their Twitter account 
to warn people to avoid the area and shelter 
in place. But the tweets, or posts, received 
minimal attention during the actual attack. 
An Active Shooter Alert might have saved 
the life of the woman who unknowingly walked 
directly into the line of fire of the Buffalo 
shooter in the Tops parking lot. 
Law enforcement needs a reliable method 
of communication to rapidly notify as many 
people as possible within the vicinity of an on-
going active shooter incident; provide instruc-
tions to avoid the area or shelter in place; and 
announce when the area has been restored to 
safety. 
H.R. 6538, the Active Shooter Alert Act of 
2022, would authorize the Department of Jus-
tice to coordinate the creation of an Active 
Shooter Alert Network, enabling law enforce-
ment to send active shooter alerts within their 
communities using the same system that 
issues AMBER Alerts, severe storm and ex-
treme weather events warnings, and other 
emergency situations. 
That system—the Integrated Public Alert 
and Warning System can send alerts to mo-
bile devices in locally targeted areas down to 
1/10th of a mile. 
This legislation would ensure that an advi-
sory panel—comprised of law enforcement of-
ficers, public safety experts, and emergency 
response officials experienced in responding 
to active shooter situations—has input in the 
development of best practices for issuing 
alerts effectively. 
DOJ by way of an appointed Active Shooter 
Alert Coordinator would be responsible for es-
tablishing the advisory panel; establishing and 
promoting adoption of the best practices; and 
coordinating with FEMA, the Department of 
Transportation, and the FCC on using the In-
tegrated Public Alert and Warning System to 
issue alerts for the network and to provide a 
report to Congress on the effectiveness of the 
network. 
Although this system would be available to 
law enforcement agencies to use on a vol-
untary basis, I expect that many agencies 
would elect to participate based on the numer-
ous endorsements previously mentioned by 
the Chairman. 
I thank ACAL Subcommittee Chairman 
CICILLINE for his leadership on this lifesaving, 
bipartisan legislation that I am proud to co-
sponsor along with Representatives DEUTCH, 
SPARTZ, UPTON, THOMPSON, MEIJER, and 
MACE. 
I ask my colleagues to support this bill.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentlewoman from 
North Carolina (Ms. MANNING) and the 
gentlewoman from California (Mrs. 
KIM) each will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from North Carolina. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Ms. MANNING. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days in which to 
revise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on H.R. 1934, 
as amended. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from North Carolina? 
There was no objection. 
Ms. MANNING. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support 
of H.R. 1934, the Promoting United 
States International Leadership in 5G 
Act. 
Let me start by thanking Ranking 
Member MCCAUL, who has been an im-
portant advocate in advancing U.S. 
leadership in global telecoms and 5G 
technology. Countering China’s and 
Russia’s malign influence in this indus-
try is critical for protecting our na-
tional security, and I thank him for his 
bipartisan work in furtherance of these 
ends. 
A big part of advancing U.S. 5G lead-
ership is ensuring that America and al-
lied countries are in the room, at the 
table, and leading the charge to set 
next-generation technology standards. 
No organization is more critical to 
that process than a little-known U.N. 
organization called the International 
Telecommunication Union, or ITU. 
For years, China and Russia have 
quietly targeted the ITU as a central 
battleground to advance their strategic 
technology interests. They have sought 
to use the ITU to unfairly advantage 
their telecom companies, giving Putin 
and the PRC power over critical com-
munications infrastructure worldwide. 
For the past 8 years, a Chinese na-
tional has served as Secretary General 
of the ITU. China has used this perch 
to favor its own companies and make 
the rules of the digital road more fa-
vorable to authoritarians. The Sec-
retary General has defended Huawei 
against critics and promoted the PRC’s 
Belt and Road campaign. With the ITU 
as its forum, Beijing has worked to un-
fairly 
promote 
Chinese 
companies’ 
technical standards. 
Now, a pivotal election for the next 
ITU Secretary General is set to take 
place in September between a fantastic 
American candidate, Doreen Bogdan- 
Martin, and former Huawei executive 
and Russian deputy telecom minister, 
Rashid Ismailov, whom China and Rus-
sia back. 
Should the United States and its al-
lies across the world fail to win this 
election, the ITU’s technical integrity 
would be endangered and authoritarian 
governments around the globe would be 
empowered. A Russian Secretary Gen-
eral would extend Putin’s ability to 
exert 
influence 
in 
the 
rules-based 
international system for which he has 
shown the utmost contempt. 
This bill is important because the 
U.S. must increase its engagement at 
the ITU and work with our allies and 
partners to counter China’s and Rus-
sia’s malign influence. H.R. 1934 would 
do just that, by forming an interagency 
working group to align our strategy at 
the ITU with our allies and monitor 
China’s influence in the organization. 
It would also strengthen much-needed 
coordination with Congress so we can 
be supportive partners in this strategic 
competition. 
We cannot be complacent about the 
coming election. The battle for influ-
ence playing out at the ITU is one we 
cannot afford to lose, and H.R. 1934 is 
an essential tool for advancing U.S. 
leadership in this powerful organiza-
tion. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support this effort by voting for this 
legislation today, and I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mrs. KIM of California. Mr. Speaker, 
I yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this 
important bipartisan legislation, the 
Promoting United States International 
Leadership in 5G Act. 
Mr. Speaker, the Chinese Communist 
Party does not hide the fact that they 
will do whatever it takes to become the 
prominent global power, especially by 
taking control of the world’s 5G net-
works. The CCP’s espionage tactics, 
theft of U.S. intellectual property, and 
cyber hacking threaten our national 
security and our competitiveness in 
the international community. Allowing 
the CCP to establish the global stand-
ards for 5G and push countries to adopt 
5G technology from CCP-linked compa-
nies like Huawei will only increase the 
amount of control and influence that 
the CCP has globally. 
This bill provides increased coopera-
tion between the United States and our 
allies to identify and counter security 
risks posed by Chinese Communist 
Party-linked companies in 5G. In addi-
tion, the bill requires the State Depart-
ment to develop a diplomatic strategy 
to increase engagement with partners 
at the international standards setting 
bodies, such as the International Tele-
communications Union, ITU, which 
sets global standards for technologies 
such as 5G. 
There is an important upcoming elec-
tion at the ITU which will decide the 
future of global telecommunications 
for years to come. It is imperative that 
we pass this bill today so that the 
United States and our allies can put up 
a united front against a Russian- and 
CCP-aligned candidate for Secretary 
General of the ITU. Russia’s campaign 
to elect a Russian national, who is a 
former Huawei executive, to serve as 
the secretary general of the ITU is in-
dicative of Russia’s and China’s efforts 
to use the international organization 
to promote their interests and malign 
influence. 
The United States should ensure that 
we are coordinated in driving support 
for the United States candidate, Do-
reen Bogdan-Martin, for the Secretary 
General of the ITU, but the State De-
partment should also be engaging on 
the important down-ballot races at the 
ITU. 
There are four other posts of signifi-
cance within the ITU’s leadership 
structure, including the director of the 
ITU Development Sector, ITU–D. The 
ITU–D plays a particularly vital role in

through trustworthy deployment of 
digital technologies in the developing

sian and Chinese malign influence does

Mr. Speaker, in closing, I thank 
Ranking Member MIKE
MCCAUL
and 
Representative CUELLAR for their work 
on this legislation. This bill will help 
ensure that the United States is doing 
all we can to stop Russian and Chinese

Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to

The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentlewoman from North Carolina 
(Ms. MANNING) that the House suspend 
the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 1934, as

The question was taken. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the

in the affirmative, the ayes have it. 
Mr. CLOUD. Mr. Speaker, on that I

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to section 3(s) of House Resolution

Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, fur-
ther proceedings on this motion are

CONDEMNING 
THE 
OCTOBER 
25, 
2021, MILITARY COUP IN SUDAN 
AND STANDING WITH THE PEO-
PLE OF SUDAN 
Ms. MANNING. Mr. Speaker, I move 
to suspend the rules and agree to the 
concurrent resolution (H. Con. Res. 59) 
condemning the October 25, 2021, mili-
tary coup in Sudan and standing with 
the people of Sudan. 
The Clerk read the title of the con-
current resolution. 
The text of the concurrent resolution 
is as follows: 
H. CON. RES. 59 
Whereas the people of the Republic of 
Sudan suffered for three decades under the 
despotic rule of President Omar Hassan 
Ahmad al-Bashir, whose government was re-
sponsible for the suppression of civil lib-
erties, grand corruption, support for inter-
national terrorism, and the commission of 
crimes against humanity and genocide; 
Whereas, throughout 2019, a coalition of 
Sudanese civic groups, including professional 
associations, 
labor 
unions, 
community 
groups, democracy activists, and opposition 
parties, led a mass protest movement to de-
mand the end of Bashir’s reign and the tran-
sition to democracy in Sudan; 
Whereas, on April 11, 2019, Sudanese mili-
tary officers deposed Bashir, and, following 
continued protests, agreed to form a transi-
tional government in partnership with a ci-
vilian pro-democracy coalition on July 17, 
2019; 
Whereas, on June 3, 2019, Sudanese forces 
led by the Rapid Support Forces (RSF), 
largely comprised of Janjaweed militia in-
volved in genocidal campaigns across Darfur 
for decades, opened fire on protesters at an 
army command headquarters in Khartoum, 
killing at least 127 people, at least 40 of 
whom were found in the Nile River; 
Whereas the military and civilian elements 
agreed to a 39-month transition to democ-
racy, with a Civilian-Led Transitional Gov-
ernment (CLTG) comprised of a predomi-
nantly civilian cabinet led by Prime Min-
ister Abdallah Hamdok, a Sovereign Council, 
an executive body with civilian and military 
members chaired for the first half of the 
transitional period by Lieutenant General 
Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, and a Transitional 
Legislative Council, which has yet to be 
formed; 
Whereas the United States and the inter-
national community supported Sudan’s tran-
sition to democracy, with the United States 
identifying more than $1,000,000,000 in foreign 
assistance, and the multilateral Friends of 
Sudan group pledging $1,800,000,000 from 
roughly 50 countries and international orga-
nizations; 
Whereas the CLTG made progress in 
human rights reforms, including guaran-
teeing the people of Sudan freedom of reli-
gion and gender equality under the transi-
tional constitution, banning female genital 
mutilation, and decriminalizing apostasy; 
Whereas, in August 2021, when the Suda-
nese Cabinet ratified the Rome Statute of 
the International Criminal Court (ICC), the 
CLTG made progress towards ending impu-
nity for abusers of human rights, stating its 
intention to deliver Omar al-Bashir to the 
ICC to stand trial for genocide, war crimes, 
and crimes against humanity, and formed ci-
vilian committees to investigate corruption 
and crimes against humanity perpetrated by 
the Bashir regime; 
Whereas the transitional government nego-
tiated a peace agreement with several rebel 
groups, a step towards ending decades of con-
flict 
in 
the 
regions 
of 
Darfur, 
South 
Kordofan, and Blue Nile, which killed hun-
dreds of thousands of civilians and left more 
than 3,000,000 people displaced within Sudan; 
Whereas Sudan continues to face a serious 
humanitarian situation, with an estimated 
13,400,000 people, or 29 percent of the popu-
lation, in need of humanitarian assistance in 
2021; 
Whereas Sudan faces a severe economic 
crisis, exacerbated by the COVID–19 pan-
demic, which caused the price of food and 
consumer goods to increase significantly, 
while austerity measures imposed to sta-
bilize the economy resulted in the reduction 
or elimination of subsidies for commodities 
including wheat and fuel; 
Whereas the political tensions between the 
civilian and military elements and within 
factions of the civilian coalition undermined 
the CLTG and contributed to widespread un-
rest within the Sudanese population relating 
to a range of issues, including the economic 
crisis, ethnic and tribal conflict in periph-
eral regions, and the unsatisfactory pace of 
reforms; 
Whereas, on September 21, 2021, some mem-
bers of the military reportedly attempted a 
coup d’e´tat against the transitional govern-
ment, which failed to depose the government 
but succeeded in precipitating the most seri-
ous political crisis of the transition period; 
Whereas, on October 21, 2021, hundreds of 
thousands of people across Sudan dem-
onstrated in support of democratic civilian 
rule, to counter a smaller protest days prior 
demanding the military take complete con-
trol of the government; 
Whereas, on October 25, 2021, Lieutenant 
General Burhan, with the support of General 
Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, also known as 
‘‘Hemedti’’, seized control of the govern-
ment, deployed the military to the streets of 
Khartoum and Omdurman, and arrested and 
detained Prime Minister Hamdok and other 
civilian officials; 
Whereas the African Union Peace and Se-
curity Council convened on October 27, 2021, 
strongly condemned the coup, reaffirmed the 
mandate of the CLTG, and subsequently sus-
pended Sudan from the regional body ‘‘with 
immediate effect . . . until the effective res-
toration’’ of the CLTG; 
Whereas the actions of Lieutenant General 
Burhan and the Sudanese military violate 
Sudan’s Constitutional Charter and threaten 
to plunge Sudan into isolation and insta-
bility; 
Whereas the United States Government 
publicly condemned the coup, suspended its 
foreign assistance to Sudan, and urged Lieu-
tenant General Burhan and his accomplices 
to restore the CLTG and return Sudan to the 
path to democracy; and 
Whereas, the Troika (the United States, 
United Kingdom, Norway), the European 
Union, and Switzerland ‘‘continue to recog-
nize the Prime Minister and his cabinet as 
the constitutional leaders of the transitional 
government’’ and ‘‘confirm once again the 
international calls for the immediate return 
to the roadmap for democratic transition of 
Sudan’’: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved by the House of Representatives (the 
Senate concurring), That Congress— 
(1) condemns the October 25, 2021, coup in 
Sudan; 
(2) stands with the people of Sudan in their 
democratic aspirations; 
(3) recognizes the Prime Minister and his 
cabinet as the constitutional leaders of Su-
dan’s transitional government; 
(4) calls for Sudan’s military junta to— 
(A) immediately release all civilian gov-
ernment officials, civil society members, and 
other individuals detained in connection 
with the coup; 
(B) return to constitutional rule under the 
transitional constitution as the starting 
point for negotiations with civilians toward 
full civilian rule; 
(C) lift the state of emergency, including 
complete restoration of all means of commu-
nication; 
(D) remove all roadblocks and checkpoints, 
and order the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) 
and RSF to stand down and comply with 
international recognized rules of engage-
ment; 
(E) ensure security forces respect the right 
to peaceful protest and hold those who used 
excessive force and committed other abuses 
accountable in a transparent, credible proc-
ess; 
(F) cease all attempts to change the civil-
ian composition of the cabinet, Sovereign 
Council, and other government bodies; and 
(G) transfer leadership of the Sovereign 
Council to a civilian member of the Sov-
ereign Council in keeping with the transi-
tional constitution; 
(5) calls on the Secretary of State to— 
(A) immediately identify coup leaders, 
their accomplices, and enablers for consider-
ation for targeted sanctions; 
(B) urge junta leaders to return imme-
diately to the rule of law as set forth by the 
transitional constitution; 
(C) monitor, discourage, and deter any ef-
fort by external parties to support the coup 
and the military junta; 
(D) coordinate with— 
(i) the Administrator of the United States 
Agency for International Development and 
other Federal Government agencies to pause 
all non-humanitarian bilateral assistance to 
Sudan until restoration of the transitional 
constitutional order; 
(ii) the Department of the Treasury to use

(B) suspend Sudan’s participation in all re-

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentlewoman from

The Chair recognizes the gentle-

GENERAL LEAVE 
Ms. MANNING. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days in which to 
revise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on H. Con. 
Res. 59, condemning the October 25, 
2021, military coup in Sudan and stand-
ing with the people of Sudan. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from North Carolina? 
There was no objection. 
Ms. MANNING. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H. 
Con. Res. 59. I would first like to thank 
my colleague, Chairman MEEKS, for 
drafting this important resolution. 
On October 25, 2021, Sudan’s military 
leaders launched a coup that essen-
tially dissolved nearly 2 years of 
progress toward establishing a civilian- 
led transitional government that would 
be accountable to the people of Sudan. 
Since then, the military junta has 
undertaken a campaign involving seri-
ous human rights violations, including 
the unlawful detention of the recog-
nized Prime Minister, senior govern-
ment officials, and members of civil so-
ciety. Civilian protestors have been 
maimed, detained, and killed arbi-
trarily. 
Now, the military junta has brazenly 
aligned itself with the Kremlin and 
provided Putin access to its mining 
sector at a time when Russia is seeking 
funds to wage its own brutal, illegal 
war in Ukraine. 
For these reasons, Congress needs to 
send a unified message to Sudan’s mili-
tary junta by strongly condemning the 
October 25 coup and reaffirming our 
support for the Sudanese people. 
This resolution will also signal to the 
world that the international commu-
nity must take a stand against the 
antidemocratic trends sweeping Sudan 
and the region. We must continue 
championing multilateral efforts to 
bring peace and stability to Sudan. 
While clearly imperfect, I believe the 
U.N.-mediated process to advance Su-
dan’s political transition and reestab-
lish the path to peace could be viable 
with the right leadership and inclusive 
representation. 
In passing this resolution and a com-
panion resolution recently passed by 
our colleagues in the Senate, I ask you 
to support this call to stand with the 
people of Sudan and urge Sudan’s mili-
tary junta to restore the civilian-led 
transition as the best hope for peace 
and prosperity in Sudan. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time.

Mrs. KIM of California. Mr. Speaker, 
I yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support 
of H. Con. Res. 59, condemning the Oc-
tober 25 coup in Sudan. I thank Chair-
man MEEKS, Ranking Member MCCAUL, 
as well as Chairwoman BASS and Rank-
ing 
Member 
SMITH
of 
the 
Sub-
committee on Africa, Global Health 
and Global Human Rights. 
Mr. Speaker, the people of Sudan 
have worked tirelessly for freedom and 
democracy since the ousting of 30-year 
dictator, 
Omar 
Al-Bashir. 
Unfortu-
nately, the path toward civilian-led de-
mocracy was halted when military 
junta leaders detained civilian leaders 
and took over the government last fall. 
These actions undermined months of 
progress made under transitional au-
thorities and hope for a new future in 
Sudan. 
Military leaders, like General Burhan 
and General Hemeti, have once again 
prioritized power as well as personal 
and financial gain over the will of the 
people. While I am glad Congress is 
sending an important and unified mes-
sage condemning the October 25 coup, 
more must be done. 
That is why I am leading the Sudan 
Democracy Act, which passed out of 
committee earlier this year. The same 
military junta that overthrew the ci-
vilian-led transitional government and 
are undermining peace and stability in 
Sudan, are also some of the same indi-
viduals implicated in gross violations 
of human rights, corruption, and illicit 
finance schemes. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge the administra-
tion to utilize all existing sanctions 
authority to demand accountability for 
these actions while we continue to 
work here in Congress to find a path 
forward for new, important sanctions 
authority. 
I stand firmly behind the people of 
Sudan, or anywhere else in the world, 
where people are fighting for freedom 
and democracy. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge all my colleagues 
to support this important measure, and 
I reserve the balance of my time. 
Ms. MANNING. Mr. Speaker, I have 
no further requests for time, and I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mrs. KIM of California. Mr. Speaker, 
I yield myself the balance of my time. 
In closing, I again thank my col-
leagues on the Committee on Foreign 
Affairs and the Subcommittee on Afri-
ca, Global Health and Human Rights 
for offering this important resolution.

passed an identical resolution, and

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5711 
June 21, 2022 
Congress is speaking clearly with one 
voice in support of the people of Sudan 
and their tireless fight for democracy. 
The United States should continue to 
support human rights defenders, jour-
nalists, and civil society leaders in 
Sudan who are standing up for democ-
racy. But it is also critical that the 
Biden administration rethink any for-
eign assistance intended for Sudan 
under this new military junta leader-
ship. 
Prior appropriations bills provided 
over $700 million to solidify a fledgling 
civilian-led transitional government. 
Unfortunately, that government is no 
longer in power and precious taxpayer 
resources should not be beholden to 
this unfortunate new reality in Sudan. 
I again commend the people of Sudan 
for their steadfast support of democ-
racy, and I am proud that today, the 
United States Congress sends a strong 
message of solidarity. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
Ms. MANNING. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself the balance of my time for the 
purpose of closing. 
Mr. Speaker, the October 25 military 
coup in Sudan represents a dark day 
for the people in Sudan. It put Sudan 
and its people on a regressive path that 
has eroded their human rights and 
their aspirations for a civilian-led 
transition. This transition, with his-
toric support from the United States, 
augured peace, stability, and demo-
cratic governance in Sudan for the first 
time in decades. Instead, the military 
junta decided to seize power without 
regard for the will of Sudan’s people. 
This resolution will echo the voice of 
the international community by con-
demning the coup, standing up for Su-
dan’s people, and calling for full ac-
countability for the junta leaders who 
have abused their power and their peo-
ple. The passage of this concurrent res-
olution is a step in the right direction. 
I again thank Chairman MEEKS for 
his leadership on this resolution, and I 
urge all my colleagues to join us by 
voting in the affirmative. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentlewoman from North Carolina 
(Ms. MANNING) that the House suspend 
the rules and agree to the concurrent 
resolution, H. Con. Res. 59. 
The question was taken. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the 
opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being 
in the affirmative, the ayes have it. 
Mr. CLOUD. Mr. Speaker, on that I

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to section 3(s) of House Resolution 
8, the yeas and nays are ordered.

CALLING FOR STABILITY AND THE 
CESSATION OF VIOLENCE AND 
CONDEMNING 
ISIS-AFFILIATED 
TERRORIST ACTIVITY IN NORTH-
ERN 
MOZAMBIQUE, 
INCLUDING 
THE CABO DELGADO PROVINCE, 
AND FOR OTHER PURPOSES 
Ms. MANNING. Mr. Speaker, I move 
to suspend the rules and agree to the 
resolution (H. Res. 720) calling for sta-
bility and the cessation of violence and 
condemning 
ISIS-affiliated 
terrorist 
activity in northern Mozambique, in-
cluding the Cabo Delgado Province, 
and for other purposes. 
The Clerk read the title of the resolu-
tion. 
The text of the resolution is as fol-
lows: 
H. RES. 720 
Whereas, in August 2019, Mozambican 
President Filipe Nyusi, of the Mozambique 
Liberation 
Front 
(FRELIMO), 
and 
the 
Mozambican National Resistance (RENAMO) 
President Ossufo Momade signed the Peace 
and Reconciliation Accord in Maputo, ending 
several years of resurgent armed conflict be-
tween 
RENAMO 
and 
FRELIMO 
before 
RENAMO’s rebel leader Mariano Nhongo was 
killed by Mozambican forces in October 2021; 
Whereas, in October 2017, violent extrem-
ists locally known as al-Shabab or Ahlu al- 
Sunnah wal-Jamaah targeted civilians in the 
Cabo Delgado Province and eventually took 
up arms against the Mozambican state, 
launching an armed insurgency that has had 
dire consequences for human rights, secu-
rity, and socioeconomic welfare in the Cabo 
Delgado Province; 
Whereas, since 2017, Ahlu al-Sunnah wal- 
Jamaah has killed thousands of civilians and 
brutalized communities in Cabo Delgado 
Province, including through mass beheadings 
of men and boys, abductions, including of 
children who are forced to take up arms, and 
attacks against transportation, supply con-
voys, government facilities, and other build-
ings, such as homes, schools, and hospitals; 
Whereas, in 2018, the Cabo Delgado-based 
violent extremist group reportedly pledged 
allegiance to the Islamic State in Iraq and 
Syria (ISIS) and was acknowledged by ISIS 
as an affiliate in August 2019; 
Whereas, on March 10, 2021, the Depart-
ment of State designated Ahlu al-Sunnah 
wal-Jamaah, also known as ISIS-Mozam-
bique, as a Foreign Terrorist Organization 
under the Immigration and Nationality Act, 
and as Specially Designated Global Terror-
ists under Executive Order 13224, and identi-
fied Tanzanian national Abu Yasir Hassan as 
the leader of the organization; 
Whereas, in late March 2021, ISIS-Mozam-
bique launched a complex attack against the 
northern Mozambican town of Palma over 
several 
days, 
overwhelming 
Mozambican 
forces, killing and abducting dozens of peo-
ple, and destroying infrastructure, leading 
TotalEnergies to declare force majeure in re-
lation to its partially United States Govern-
ment-financed $20,000,000 liquified natural 
gas project near Palma; 
Whereas, in May 2021, the United States 
Holocaust Memorial Museum reported a high 
risk of new mass killings in Mozambique as 
part of the Early Warning Project risk as-
sessment for 2020–2021; 
Whereas the United States Government an-
nounced in March 2021 its segment training 
of the Mozambican armed forces to help 
build their counterterrorism capacities, and 
the European Union announced in July 2021 
that it would establish a military training 
mission in Mozambique; 
Whereas, on June 23, 2021, the Southern Af-
rican 
Development 
Community 
(SADC) 
heads of state issued a communique approv-
ing the deployment of the SADC Standby 
Force Mission to combat ‘‘acts of terrorism 
and violent extremism in Cabo Delgado’’; 
Whereas, on July 10, 2021, Mozambican 
President Filipe Nyusi confirmed that 1,000 
Rwandan forces had begun deploying to the 
Cabo Delgado Province and that a SADC 
standby force would follow, and on August 8, 
2021, Rwandan forces announced they had re-
taken a strategic provincial port from ISIS- 
Mozambique; 
Whereas grievances fueling terrorist re-
cruitment reportedly include allegations of 
state corruption and exploitation, including 
by security forces, and historical socio-
economic and political marginalization of 
the Cabo Delgado Province and other north-
ern regions, which has constrained develop-
ment and brought about high rates of pov-
erty, 
youth 
unemployment, 
and 
socio-
economic inequality; 
Whereas 
international 
development 
of 
northern Mozambique’s natural resources 
has the potential to yield economic benefit 
to the Cabo Delgado Province’s local popu-
lations through job creation, increased pri-
vate investment, and expanded development 
initiatives, yet in some cases resource devel-
opment has reportedly displaced local com-
munities and some have been inadequately 
compensated for lost land, homes, and dis-
rupted livelihoods; 
Whereas international human rights mon-
itors have reported human rights violations 
perpetrated by Mozambican security forces 
during counterterrorism operations in the 
Cabo Delgado Province, including arbitrary 
arrests, abductions, torture of detainees, ex-
cessive force against unarmed civilians, in-
timidation, and extrajudicial killings; 
Whereas, as of June 2021, ISIS-Mozam-
bique’s attacks and resulting clashes with 
government forces throughout the Cabo 
Delgado Province have killed over 3,000 peo-
ple and displaced nearly 800,000, left 1,300,000 
people in need of humanitarian assistance, 
including approximately 900,000, primarily 
women and children, in emergency-levels of 
food insecurity, and in July 2021, the World 
Food Program warned that insufficient fund-
ing could lead to famine in the region; 
Whereas the United States, through the 
United States Agency for International De-
velopment, is the single largest donor of hu-
manitarian assistance in Mozambique; and 
Whereas, in April 2021, the World Bank ap-
proved a $100,000,000 grant to Mozambique’s 
Agency for Integrated Development of the 
North for the ‘‘restoration of livelihoods and 
economic opportunities, building of social 
cohesion, and improving access to basic serv-
ices as well as the rehabilitation of selected 
public infrastructure intended to benefit in-
ternally displaced persons (IDPs) and host 
communities in targeted areas of Northern 
Mozambique’’, and has determined Mozam-
bique is eligible for its Prevention and Resil-
ience Allocation, granting potential access 
of up to $700,000,000 in additional assistance 
for similar projects: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representa-
tives— 
(1) condemns the violence, targeting of ci-
vilians, and terrorist attacks carried out by 
ISIS-Mozambique in the Cabo Delgado Prov-
ince; 
(2) urges the Mozambican Government to— 
(A) continue to work with international 
partners to restore security in the Cabo 
Delgado Province and counter violent extre-
mism and terrorism in a manner that 
prioritizes the protection of civilians and 
their human rights;

capacity of the Government of Mozambique 
to counter terrorism and violent extremism 
and address conflict through existing pro-
grams, such as the Partnership for Regional 
East Africa Counterterrorism (PREACT), 
and future interagency initiatives, while en-
suring respect for human rights and protec-
tion of civilians; 
(5) urges the Mozambican Northern Inte-
grated Development Agency to consult with 
local populations and civil society groups in 
the Cabo Delgado Province and to ensure

zambique’s Humanitarian Response Plan and

areas in Mozambique. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentlewoman from 
North Carolina (Ms. MANNING) and the 
gentlewoman from California (Mrs. 
KIM) each will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from North Carolina. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Ms. MANNING. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
have 5 legislative days in which to re-
vise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on H. Res. 
720, calling for stability and cessation 
of violence and condemning ISIS-affili-
ated terrorist activity in northern Mo-
zambique, including the Cabo Delgado 
Province, and for other purposes. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from North Carolina? 
There was no objection. 
Ms. MANNING. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of 
House Resolution 720 calling for sta-
bility and the cessation of violence and 
condemning 
ISIS-affiliated 
terrorist 
activity in northern Mozambique, in-
cluding the Cabo Delgado Province, 
and for other purposes. 
Let me start by thanking Represent-
ative SARA JACOBS for her work on this 
critical resolution. 
Since 2017, terrorists operating under 
the ISIS banner have laid waste to a 
large part of the Cabo Delgado Prov-
ince in northern Mozambique, killing 
thousands of civilians, displacing mil-
lions, and grinding almost all economic 
activity in the region to a halt. The 
devastation these terrorists inflicted 
on the people spurred an unprecedented 
humanitarian crisis in northern Mo-
zambique that continues to unfold. 
With the support of the United 
States, Rwanda, the European Union, 
South Africa, and other Southern Afri-
can Development Community mem-
bers, the terrorist threat in northern 
Mozambique has been largely neutral-
ized. There is more work to do, includ-
ing those efforts underway to stabilize 
the region, return refugees and IDPs to 
their homes, and revitalize livelihoods 
and the regional economy. 
To effectively address these issues, 
including the underlying drivers of vio-
lent extremism, the Government of the 
Republic of Mozambique must spear-
head a strong, comprehensive plan to 
implement a national security strategy 
and establish an inclusive process for 
economic growth and development in 
the north. 
The United States remains com-
mitted to supporting Mozambique’s ef-
forts to strengthen democracy, im-
prove transparency and other good gov-
ernance measures, and stimulate its 
economy. 
This resolution condemns the vio-
lence against civilians in the Cabo 
Delgado Province, including the ter-
rorist attacks carried out by ISIS-Mo-
zambique, and calls on the Government 
of the Republic of Mozambique to end 
the conflict and increase its humani-
tarian support effort. 
The United States stands with the 
people of Mozambique and will con-
tinue to counter the spread of violent 
extremism there and around the world. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mrs. KIM of California. Mr. Speaker, 
I yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong 
support of H. Res. 720 that I am co- 
leading alongside my colleague, Rep-
resentative 
SARA
JACOBS. 
I 
thank 
Chairman MEEKS and Ranking Member 
MCCAUL for their support, as well. 
This resolution calls for a cessation 
of violence and condemns ISIS-affili-
ated terrorists in northern Mozam-
bique. Since 2017, ISIS-affiliated ex-
tremists launched an armed insurgency 
in northern Mozambique and have bru-
talized communities, displaced civil-
ians, and attacked schools, homes, and 
hospitals. 
Last year, terrorist elements took 
over the town of Palma, further caus-
ing chaos, displacement, and gruesome 
civilian casualties. The largest private 
U.S. investment on the continent—a 
natural gas project—was forced to halt 
work and temporarily withdraw. 
Mr. Speaker, I strongly condemn 
these violent attacks, and I commend 
the Government of Mozambique’s ef-
forts to dedicate resources to address-
ing this threat and early steps to part-
ner with the United States and allies 
to 
build 
the 
capacity 
and 
professionalization of security forces, 
bolster the justice system, and ensure 
governance and services to commu-
nities in previously marginalized areas 
of Cabo Delgado Province. I also com-
mend the troop deployment by the 
Southern African Development Com-
munity to stabilize the region. 
We have seen this elsewhere—wheth-
er the early days of ISIS in Syria or 
Boko Haram in Northeast Nigeria. Ter-
rorist insurgency movements cannot be 
left unaddressed, and early steps to ad-
dress the root causes of such move-
ments can prevent costly interventions 
and massive loss of human life later on. 
The United States has key economic, 
security, and diplomatic interests in 
urgently 
addressing 
this 
terrorist 
threat. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support this resolution, and I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Ms. MANNING. Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 
minutes to the gentlewoman from Cali-
fornia (Ms. JACOBS), the vice chair of 
the International Development, Inter-
national 
Organizations, 
and 
Global 
Corporate 
Social 
Impact 
Sub-
committee. 
Ms. 
JACOBS 
of 
California. 
Mr. 
Speaker, I thank my friend, Represent-
ative MANNING, for yielding time; to 
Chairman MEEKS
for advancing this 
legislation in committee; and to Chair-
woman BASS; and my friend Congress-
woman KIM, for partnering with me on 
this important effort. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support 
of 
my 
resolution 
on 
Mozambique, 
which calls for stability and the ces-
sation of violence in northern Mozam-
bique and condemns the attacks and vi-
olence by ISIS-Mozambique. 
It calls for a new strategy and a new 
approach for how the U.S. engages with 
Mozambique to address conflict and 
violent extremism. And part of why 
passing this resolution today is so im-
portant, is because we need to raise 
awareness in this body and in this 
country about the dire humanitarian 
situation in Mozambique. 
Since 2017, ISIS-Mozambique, also 
known as Ahlu al Sunnah wal Jamaah, 
has inflicted violence on communities 
in Mozambique. These insurgents have 
brutalized people and targeted civilians 
through mass beheadings of men and 
boys, abductions of children, and at-
tacks against key civilian infrastruc-
ture.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5713 
June 21, 2022 
This violence, combined with the 
government response to it, has killed 
over 1,700 civilians in Cabo Delgado 
Province alone. 
The international community, par-
ticularly the Southern African Devel-
opment 
Community 
forces 
and 
Rwanda’s forces, have responded with 
troop deployment to secure areas and 
shield civilians from continued vio-
lence. But let’s be clear. We know that 
a military-led response will not be 
enough. 
That is why I was so supportive of 
the Biden administration’s recent des-
ignation of Mozambique as a priority 
country under the Global Fragility 
Act, so that we can better align re-
sources among the interagency and 
work to address the key drivers of this 
violence and other forms of instability 
in the country. 
And as we craft our strategy for Mo-
zambique, we must be clear-eyed about 
the underlying grievance and what it 
will really take to make a difference in 
preventing new violence from occur-
ring. We know that terrorism and vio-
lent extremism are also fueled by per-
ceptions of state repression, human 
rights abuses, and socioeconomic and 
political marginalization. We know 
that these factors exist in Mozambique 
and in the state response to ISIS-Mo-
zambique. We need to be honest about 
the 
challenges 
impacting 
the 
Mozambican people in order to get seri-
ous about preventing future terrorist 
recruitment. 
We also need to ensure that we are 
helping the Mozambican Government 
support development goals of Cabo 
Delgado 
and 
northern 
Mozambique 
that will allow all sectors of society to 
thrive. 
That is why I am looking forward to 
the United States’ partnership with the 
Mozambique 
Government 
and 
the 
Mozambican people and to ensuring our 
strategy is shaped by lessons learned 
from our counterterrorism missions 
across the world that have consistently 
fallen short. 
This resolution has strong support 
from across the ideological spectrum. I 
am proud to lead the passage of this 
important resolution, and I urge my 
colleagues to support it. 
b 1630 
Mrs. KIM of California. Mr. Speaker, 
I yield myself the balance of my time. 
This resolution condemns the ter-
rorist attacks and ISIS insurgency in 
northern Mozambique and urges the 
administration to prioritize efforts to 
address this threat. 
I am pleased that the administration 
selected Mozambique as a priority 
country to implement a 10-year strat-
egy for U.S. diplomatic, development, 
and security engagement. This type of 
long-term 
interagency 
planning 
is 
critically important to coordinating 
U.S. efforts and ensuring the most ef-
fective use of resources to target the 
root causes of the instability and ter-
rorism. This issue cannot wait, and the 
administration must implement the re-
quirements of the Global Fragility Act 
without further delay. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
Ms. MANNING. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself the balance of my time for the 
purpose of closing. 
Mr. Speaker, the terrorist activity 
that has destabilized parts of northern 
Mozambique is a symptom of a larger 
issue at hand. The United States is 
working closely with the Mozambican 
Government to help address the drivers 
of terrorist recruitment by supporting 
governance reforms, providing humani-
tarian assistance, and promoting other 
stabilization efforts in the country. 
This 
resolution 
underscores 
that 
commitment 
and 
urges 
the 
Mozambican Government to create a 
centralized and comprehensive strat-
egy to counter violent extremism and 
restore security in its northern region. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank Representative 
JACOBS for her leadership on this reso-
lution, and I urge all my colleagues to 
join us by voting in the affirmative. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time.

EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF CON-
GRESS REGARDING THE EXECU-
TION-STYLE 
MURDERS 
OF 
UNITED STATES CITIZENS YLLI, 
AGRON, AND MEHMET BYTYQI IN 
THE REPUBLIC OF SERBIA IN 
JULY 1999 
Ms. MANNING. Mr. Speaker, I move 
to suspend the rules and agree to the 
concurrent resolution (H. Con. Res. 45) 
expressing the sense of Congress re-
garding the execution-style murders of 
United States citizens Ylli, Agron, and 
Mehmet Bytyqi in the Republic of Ser-
bia in July 1999. 
The Clerk read the title of the con-
current resolution. 
The text of the concurrent resolution 
is as follows: 
H. CON. RES. 45 
Whereas brothers Ylli, Agron, and Mehmet 
Bytyqi were citizens of the United States, 
born in Chicago, Illinois, to ethnic Albanian 
parents from what is today the Republic of 
Kosovo, and who subsequently lived in 
Hampton Bays, New York; 
Whereas the three Bytyqi brothers re-
sponded to the brutality of the conflict asso-
ciated with Kosovo’s separation from the Re-
public of Serbia and the Federal Republic of 
Yugoslavia of which Serbia was a con-
stituent republic by joining the so-called 
‘‘Atlantic Brigade’’ of the Kosovo Liberation 
Army in April 1999; 
Whereas a Military-Technical Agreement 
between the Government of Yugoslavia and 
the North Atlantic Council came into effect 
on June 10, 1999, leading to a cessation of 
hostilities; 
Whereas the Bytyqi brothers were arrested 
on June 23, 1999, by Serbian police within the 
Federal Republic of Yugoslavia when the 
brothers accidently crossed what was then 
an unmarked administrative border while es-
corting an ethnic Romani family who had 
been neighbors to safety outside Kosovo; 
Whereas the Bytyqi brothers were jailed 
for 15 days for illegal entry into the Federal 
Republic of Yugoslavia in Prokuplje, Serbia, 
until a judge ordered their release on July 8, 
1999; 
Whereas, instead of being released, the 
Bytyqi brothers were taken by a special op-
erations unit of the Serbian Ministry of In-
ternal Affairs to a training facility near 
Petrovo Selo, Serbia, where all three were 
executed; 
Whereas, at the time of their murders, Ylli 
was 25, Agron was 23, and Mehmet was 21 
years of age; 
Whereas 
Yugoslav 
President 
Slobodan 
Milosevic was removed from office on Octo-
ber 5, 2000, following massive demonstrations 
protesting his refusal to acknowledge and ac-
cept election results the month before; 
Whereas, in the following years, the polit-
ical leadership of Serbia has worked to 
strengthen democratic institutions, to de-
velop stronger adherence to the rule of law, 
and to ensure respect for human rights and 
fundamental freedoms, including as the Fed-
eral Republic of Yugoslavia evolved into a 
State Union of Serbia and Montenegro in 
February 2003, which itself dissolved when 
both republics proclaimed their respective 
independence in June 2006; 
Whereas the United States Embassy in Bel-
grade, Serbia, was informed on July 17, 2001, 
that the bodies of Ylli, Agron, and Mehmet 
Bytyqi were found with their hands bound 
and gunshot wounds to the back of their 
heads, buried atop an earlier mass grave of 
approximately 70 bodies of murdered civil-
ians from Kosovo; 
Whereas Serbian authorities subsequently 
investigated but never charged those individ-
uals who were part of the Ministry of Inter-
nal Affairs chain of command related to this 
crime, including former Minister of Internal 
Affairs Vlajko Stojilkovic, Assistant Min-
ister and Chief of the Public Security De-
partment Vlastimir Djordjevic, and special 
operations training camp commander Goran 
‘‘Guri’’ Radosavljevic; 
Whereas Vlajko Stojilkovic died of a self- 
inflicted gunshot wound in April 2002 prior to 
being transferred to the custody of the Inter-
national Criminal Tribunal for the former 
Yugoslavia where he had been charged with 
crimes against humanity and violations of 
the laws or customs of war during the 
Kosovo conflict; 
Whereas Vlastimir Djordjevic was arrested 
and transferred to the custody of the Inter-
national Criminal Tribunal for the former 
Yugoslavia in June 2007, and sentenced in 
February 2011 to 27 years imprisonment 
(later reduced to 18 years) for crimes against 
humanity and violations of the laws or cus-
toms of war committed during the Kosovo 
conflict; 
Whereas Goran ‘‘Guri’’ Radosavljevic is re-
ported to reside in Serbia, working as direc-
tor of a security consulting firm in Belgrade, 
and is a prominent member of the governing 
political party;

June 21, 2022 
Whereas the Secretary of State designated 
Goran Radosavljevic of Serbia under section 
7031(c) of the Department of State, Foreign 
Operations, and Related Programs Appro-
priations Act, 2018 as ineligible for entry 
into the United States due to his involve-
ment in gross violations of human rights; 
Whereas two Serbian Ministry of Internal 
Affairs officers, Sretan Popovic and Milos 
Stojanovic, were charged in 2006 for crimes 
associated with their involvement in the de-
tention and transport of the Bytyqi brothers 
from Prokuplje to Petrovo Selo, but acquit-
ted in May 2012 with an appeals court con-
firming the verdict in March 2013; 
Whereas the Serbian President Aleksandar 
Vucic promised several high ranking United 
States officials to deliver justice in the cases 
of the deaths of Ylli, Agron, and Mehmet 
Bytyqi; 
Whereas no individual has ever been found 
guilty for the murders of Ylli, Agron, and 
Mehmet Bytyqi or of any other crimes asso-
ciated with their deaths; and 
Whereas no individual is currently facing 
criminal charges regarding the murder of the 
Bytyqi brothers despite many promises by 
Serbian officials to resolve the case: Now, 
therefore, be it 
Resolved by the House of Representatives (the 
Senate concurring), That it is the sense of 
Congress that— 
(1) those individuals responsible for the 
murders in July 1999 of United States citi-
zens Ylli, Agron, and Mehmet Bytyqi in Ser-
bia should be brought to justice; 
(2) it is reprehensible that no individual 
has ever been found guilty for executing the 
Bytyqi brothers, or of any other crimes asso-
ciated with their deaths, and that no indi-
vidual is even facing charges for these hor-
rible crimes; 
(3) the Government of Serbia and its rel-
evant ministries and offices, including the 
Serbian War Crimes Prosecutor’s Office, 
should make it a priority to investigate and 
prosecute as soon as possible those current 
or former officials believed to be responsible 
for their deaths, directly or indirectly; 
(4) the United States should devote suffi-
cient resources to fully assist and properly 
monitor efforts by the Government of Serbia 
and its relevant ministries and offices to in-
vestigate and prosecute as soon as possible 
those individuals believed to be responsible 
for their deaths, directly or indirectly; and 
(5) progress in resolving this case, or the 
lack thereof, should remain a significant fac-
tor determining the further development of 
relations between the United States and the 
Republic of Serbia. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentlewoman from 
North Carolina (Ms. MANNING) and the 
gentlewoman from California (Mrs. 
KIM) each will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from North Carolina. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Ms. MANNING. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
have 5 legislative days in which to re-
vise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on H. Con. 
Res. 45. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from North Carolina? 
There was no objection. 
Ms. MANNING. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H. 
Con. Res. 45, a resolution condemning 
the execution-style murders of the U.S. 
citizen Bytyqi brothers in the Republic 
of Serbia in July 1999. 
Let me start by thanking Represent-
ative LEE
ZELDIN
for his bipartisan 
work in bringing their murderers to 
justice. 
These three brave brothers, whose 
family hails from what is now Kosovo, 
were simply trying to help a Romanian 
family find safety outside Kosovo when 
they were trapped at an unmarked ad-
ministrative border. After 15 days of 
jail, the brothers were taken by a spe-
cial operations unit of the Serbian 
Ministry of Internal Affairs, where 
they lost their lives at the hands of 
Serbian officials. 
The brothers were in their early 
twenties. Their bodies were not found 
until 2 years later, buried atop a mass 
grave of Kosovo civilians. In the 23 
years since, the United States has been 
promised that justice will be delivered, 
yet not one person has been found 
guilty of their murder. 
This measure would call on the Ser-
bian Government to prioritize the in-
vestigation and prosecution of their 
murders, and on the United States to 
devote the resources necessary to as-
sist in bringing them to justice. 
The 116th Congress passed this reso-
lution, and it is my hope that this Con-
gress does the same. These three young 
men 
deserve 
justice 
and 
account-
ability. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mrs. KIM of California. Mr. Speaker, 
I yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support 
of H. Con. Res. 45. I thank Representa-
tive ZELDIN for championing this im-
portant resolution. 
As the world focuses on the horrors 
of the war crimes being committed by 
Vladimir Putin’s invading forces in 
Ukraine, we must not forget the vic-
tims of the past war crimes still await-
ing justice. 
Ylli, Agron, and Mehmet Bytyqi were 
three American brothers from New 
York State who are suspected of hav-
ing been killed in July 1999 by Serbian 
authorities. After disappearing while in 
the custody of Serbian special police, 
they were executed, shot in the head 
with their hands tied behind their 
backs. Their bodies were later discov-
ered in a mass grave at a training com-
pound of the Serbian secret police. 
Tragically, nearly 23 years later, 
there has still not been a full investiga-
tion into their deaths, and the Bytyqi 
brothers’ murderers have yet to be 
brought to justice. This is unaccept-
able. 
This case, among others, illustrates 
the continued need for Serbia to re-
solve outstanding war crimes inves-
tigations. Holding accountable those 
who committed and covered up the 
murder of the Bytyqi brothers is crit-
ical to continuing bilateral relations 
between the United States and Bel-
grade. 
Therefore, I urge all of my colleagues 
to join me in supporting this resolu-
tion. Congress must be on the record 
calling on Serbian authorities to once 
and for all deliver justice for the 
Bytyqi brothers and their family. 
Mr. Speaker, 23 years is too long for 
the Bytyqi brothers and their family to 
go without justice. 
Seriously dealing with the past and 
bringing justice to all victims of war 
crimes committed in the wars that fol-
lowed the breakup of the former Yugo-
slavia is needed to ensure reconcili-
ation and peace throughout the region. 
Mr. ZELDIN reintroduced this bipar-
tisan resolution last year. I urge Bel-
grade to commit to a proper investiga-
tion and full accountability for these 
three Americans so this resolution does 
not have to be reintroduced once again 
next Congress. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
Ms. MANNING. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself the balance of my time. 
Mr. Speaker, H. Con. Res. 45 will en-
sure that the United States is doing ev-
erything in our power to bring the 
murderers of United States citizens 
Ylli, Agron, and Mehmet Bytyqi to jus-
tice. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank Representative 
LEE ZELDIN for his leadership on this 
resolution, and I urge my colleagues to 
join us by voting in the affirmative. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentlewoman from North Carolina 
(Ms. MANNING) that the House suspend 
the rules and agree to the concurrent 
resolution, H. Con. Res. 45. 
The question was taken. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the 
opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being 
in the affirmative, the ayes have it. 
Mr. CLOUD. Mr. Speaker, on that I 
demand the yeas and nays. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to section 3(s) of House Resolution 
8, the yeas and nays are ordered. 
Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, fur-
ther proceedings on this motion are 
postponed.

Emirates, and subjected to an enforced dis-
appearance for three days before the Govern-
ment of the Republic of Rwanda acknowl-
edged his detention, during which time he 
was reportedly tortured; 
Whereas, in December 2020, more than 36 
Members of Congress wrote to President 
Paul Kagame to urge him to return Paul 
Rusesabagina to the United States and ex-
pressed grave concern with the manner in 
which 
the 
Government 
of 
Rwanda 
extrajudicially transferred Mr. Rusesabagina 
from the United Arab Emirates to Rwanda 
and then immediately placed him in solitary 
confinement and charged him with multiple 
crimes; 
Whereas, on February 11, 2021, the Euro-
pean Parliament adopted a resolution on 
‘‘Rwanda, the case of Paul Rusesabagina’’, 
which in part ‘‘[e]xpresses deep concern 
about the violations of Mr Rusesabagina’s 
rights; urges the Rwandan authorities to 
allow Mr Rusesabagina to undergo a fair and 
public hearing by a competent, independent 
and 
impartial 
tribunal 
applying 
inter-
national human rights standards . . .’’; 
Whereas the American Bar Association’s 
Center for Human Rights’ June 2021 report 
‘‘The Case of Paul Rusesabagina’’ concluded 
that, ‘‘it is clear that Mr. Rusesabagina’s 
fair trial rights – in particular his right to 
confidential communication, his right to the 
presumption of innocence, and his right to 
prepare his defense – have been violated, po-
tentially to the irreparable prejudice of the 
defense, calling into question the fairness of 
any potential convicting verdict’’; 
Whereas, on September 20, 2021, the High 
Court 
of 
Rwanda 
convicted 
Paul 
Rusesabagina of terrorism-related offences 
and he was sentenced to 25 years in prison; 
Whereas United States Department of 
State Spokesman Ned Price announced on 
September 20, 2021, that the United States 
Government is ‘‘concerned by the Govern-
ment of Rwanda’s conviction of U.S. lawful 
permanent resident Paul Rusesabagina’’ and 
stated that the ‘‘reported lack of fair trial 
guarantees calls into question the fairness of 
the verdict’’; 
Whereas, on October 7, 2021, the European 
Parliament adopted a resolution on ‘‘The 
case of Paul Rusesabagina in Rwanda’’, 
which ‘‘[c]alls for the immediate release of 
Mr Rusesabagina on humanitarian grounds 
and for his repatriation without prejudice to 
his guilt or innocence; demands that the EU 
Delegation to Rwanda and the diplomatic 
representations 
of 
the 
Member 
States 
strongly convey this request in their ex-
changes with the Rwandan authorities’’; 
Whereas on May 19, 2022, the Department 
of State determined that Paul Rusesabagina 
was ‘‘wrongfully detained’’, and that ‘‘the 
determination took into account the totality 
of the circumstances, notably the lack of fair 
trial guarantees during his trial’’, pursuant 
to the Robert Levinson Hostage Recovery 
and 
Hostage-Taking 
Accountability 
Act 
(Public Law 116–260); and 
Whereas Paul Rusesabagina is a cancer 
survivor and suffers from a cardiovascular 
disorder and his family states that he has 
missed multiple medical appointments, in-

it 
Resolved, That the House of Representa-

(1) calls on the Government of Rwanda to 
immediately release Paul Rusesabagina on 
humanitarian grounds and permit him to re-
turn safely to the United States; 
(2) calls on the Government of Rwanda to

GENERAL LEAVE 
Ms. MANNING. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
have 5 legislative days in which to re-
vise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on H. Res. 
892, as amended, calling on the Govern-
ment of the Republic of Rwanda to re-
lease Paul Rusesabagina on humani-
tarian grounds. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from North Carolina? 
There was no objection. 
Ms. MANNING. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H. 
Res. 892, which calls for the release of 
Paul Rusesabagina on humanitarian 
grounds. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague, 
Chairman CASTRO, for drafting this im-
portant measure. 
Nearly 
30 
years 
ago, 
Paul 
Rusesabagina, a Belgian citizen and 
permanent 
resident 
of 
the 
United 
States, risked his life to protect more 
than a thousand people during the 1994 
Rwandan genocide. In honor of his sin-
gular and valiant actions during one of 
the worst human rights crises and mass 
murders in history, he was given the 
Presidential Medal of Freedom. 
In August 2020, Paul Rusesabagina 
boarded a plane in the UAE that he be-
lieved was headed to Burundi only to 
arrive in the capital of Rwanda and be 
arrested by Rwandan authorities under 
dubious terrorism-related charges. 
In September, despite a lack of due 
process and fair trial, he was sentenced 
to 25 years in prison. He has been 
placed in solitary confinement and 
charged with numerous crimes of no 
credence. 
The Rwandan Government’s unlawful 
actions, including the extrajudicial 
transfer of Mr. Rusesabagina from the 
UAE to Rwanda and his deteriorating 
medical condition while detained, are 
of great concern. 
The Department of State has now de-
termined that he was wrongfully de-
tained 
pursuant 
to 
the 
Robert 
Levinson Hostage Recovery and Hos-
tage-Taking Accountability Act. As 
such, this resolution calls for the im-
mediate release and return of Mr. 
Rusesabagina 
on 
humanitarian 
grounds. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge the administra-
tion 
to 
raise 
the 
case 
of 
Mr. 
Rusesabagina in all interactions with 
the Rwandan Government and continue 
to press for his immediate release on 
humanitarian grounds. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mrs. KIM of California. Mr. Speaker, 
I yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support 
of H. Res. 892, calling for the release of 
Paul Rusesabagina on humanitarian 
grounds. I am proud to co-lead this res-
olution alongside Representative CAS-
TRO. I thank him for his leadership. 
Paul Rusesabagina is a legal perma-
nent resident of the United States who 
was awarded the Presidential Medal of 
Freedom for his heroic actions during 
the Rwandan genocide. 
In August 2020, he was extrajudicially 
transferred 
from 
Texas 
to 
Kigali, 
Rwanda, by way of the United Arab 
Emirates, and subjected to an enforced 
disappearance for 3 days before the 
Government of the Republic of Rwanda 
acknowledged his detention. 
He underwent trial proceedings for 
terrorism-related 
charges, 
and 
the 
American Bar Association has subse-
quently determined that his fair trial 
rights have been violated. 
Pursuant to the Robert Levinson 
Hostage Recovery and Hostage-Taking 
Act, the Department of State has de-
termined that Mr. Rusesabagina was 
wrongfully detained. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge the Rwandan 
Government to urgently work with the 
State Department and authorities in 
Europe to secure a path forward for his 
release and return to the United 
States. 
It is also critically important that 
the Government of Rwanda grant ac-
cess to his U.S.-based doctor to assess 
his health and well-being. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support this important resolution and 
efforts to bring Paul Rusesabagina 
home to his family. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
b 1645 
Ms. MANNING. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 
minutes to the gentleman from Texas 
(Mr. CASTRO), who is the chair of the 
Subcommittee on International Devel-
opment, International Organizations, 
and Global Corporate Social Impact. 
Mr. CASTRO of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I 
rise to urge my colleagues to support 
H. Res. 892, calling on the Government 
of the Republic of Rwanda to release 
Paul Rusesabagina on humanitarian 
grounds. 
Paul is a hero of the Rwandan geno-
cide and a permanent resident of San 
Antonio, Texas, my hometown where 
his family also lives today. 
Last year, a Rwandan court sen-
tenced Paul to 25 years in prison on po-
litically motivated charges. Paul is 68 
years old, and for him that is a life sen-
tence. 
Congresswoman YOUNG
KIM
and I 
have been closely following his case for 
several years, and we were proud to in-
troduce H. Res. 892 in February of this 
year.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5716 
June 21, 2022 
Paul’s story begins in Rwanda, the 
country of his birth. Nearly three dec-
ades ago, he was serving as assistant 
general manager of a luxury hotel in 
Kigali, Rwanda, when the Rwandan 
genocide began. 
The genocide, which led to the deaths 
of an estimated 800,000 people over a 3- 
month period, targeted mostly mem-
bers of the ethnic Tutsi minority. Paul 
is a member of the Hutu majority, but 
he was determined not to see his Tutsi 
countrymen die on his watch. 
As genocidal killing squads roamed 
through Rwanda, Paul sheltered more 
than 1,200 people in his hotel, saving 
their lives. 
In the aftermath of the genocide, 
Paul and his family received asylum in 
Belgium and later moved to San Anto-
nio with the help of the late Texas Sen-
ator Bob Krueger, an international 
leader in the fight against genocide. In 
2005, President George W. Bush pre-
sented Paul with the Presidential 
Medal of Freedom, our Nation’s highest 
civilian honor. 
Since the 1994 genocide, the Govern-
ment of Rwanda has made tremendous 
strides in economic development and 
stability. However, the country’s gov-
ernment is still plagued by corruption, 
abuse of power, and human rights 
issues that amount to violations of 
international law—including enforced 
disappearances. 
At 
home 
and 
abroad 
Paul 
Rusesabagina has used his voice and 
elevated platform to call attention to 
the need for change in Rwanda. In re-
sponse, 
the 
Rwandan 
Government 
launched an extraordinary campaign of 
persecution against him. 
In 
August 
2020, 
Paul 
was 
extrajudicially transferred from Texas 
to Rwanda by way of the United Arab 
Emirates and arrested on trumped-up 
charges. 
The Rwandan Government did not 
acknowledge his detention for 3 days, 
during which he was reportedly subject 
to torture. In September 2021, Paul was 
found guilty and sentenced in a trial 
that the European Union described as 
‘‘marred by numerous violations of his 
fair trial rights.’’ 
He is a cancer survivor who lives 
with serious cardiovascular issues, and 
Rwandan authorities have not provided 
him with the care he needs in prison. 
I have my children here on the floor 
with me, and my heart breaks for 
Paul’s family who can only speak to 
him once a week for 5 minutes. It is 
long past time for Rwanda to release 
Paul and allow him to come home to 
San Antonio. 
My colleagues and I on both sides of 
the aisle have raised our concerns pre-
viously. In December 2020, we sent a bi-
partisan, bicameral letter to Rwandan 
President Paul Kagame urging him to 
release Paul on humanitarian grounds. 
We spoke out about the way Paul was 
taken against his will to Rwanda, 
which for all intents and purposes was 
a kidnapping by the Kagame regime. 
In June 2021, my colleagues and I 
wrote to Secretary of State Antony 
Blinken urging him to use all diplo-
matic means at his disposal to ensure 
Paul’s safe return to the United States. 
We are not the only ones who are 
concerned. 
Last year, the American Bar Associa-
tion Center for Human Rights issued a 
report that found Paul’s right to con-
fidential communication, his right to 
the presumption of innocence, and his 
right to prepare his defense have all 
been violated. 
In October 2021, the European Par-
liament adopted a resolution denounc-
ing Paul’s illegal arrest. The resolution 
strongly 
condemns 
the 
conviction, 
which it said was ‘‘exemplary of the 
human rights violations in Rwanda.’’ 
Paul is a permanent resident of the 
United States, and we must work just 
as hard as our European allies to bring 
him home. 
In May, the State Department an-
nounced its determination that Paul 
was ‘‘wrongfully detained,’’ noting that 
‘‘The determination took into account 
the totality of the circumstances, no-
tably the lack of fair trial guarantees 
during his trial.’’ 
I appreciate the support of the State 
Department, which has been working 
with Paul’s family and the Congress on 
this issue. I am especially pleased that 
Paul’s case is now under the purview of 
the Special Presidential Envoy for Hos-
tage 
Affairs, 
Ambassador 
Roger 
Carstens. 
Rwanda’s President Kagame wants to 
be seen as a global leader and a reliable 
partner to the United States, including 
on issues including climate change. 
But Paul’s unlawful detention is a 
blight on Rwanda’s international rep-
utation. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues, 
both Republican and Democrat, to sup-
port this resolution. 
Mrs. KIM of California. Mr. Speaker, 
I urge my colleagues to support this 
resolution offered by Representative 
CASTRO and myself. I want to recognize 
Paul’s family, especially his wife and 
children, who have tirelessly advocated 
for his release. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
Ms. MANNING. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself the balance of my time for the 
purpose of closing. 
Mr. Speaker, Paul Rusesabagina’s 
history and circumstances as a war 
hero wrongfully detained and denied 
adequate medical care is one that we 
cannot ignore. Congress must stand 
with Paul Rusesabagina’s family who 
have not wavered in championing his 
legacy and calling attention to his 
plight to call for his immediate release 
and return to the United States on hu-
manitarian grounds. 
Mr. Speaker, I, again, thank Chair-
man CASTRO for his leadership on this 
resolution. I urge all my colleagues to 
join us by voting in the affirmative, 
and I yield back the balance of my 
time. 
Ms. JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today in strong support of H. Res. 892, a reso-
lution calling on the Government of the Re-
public 
of 
Rwanda 
to 
release 
Paul 
Rusesabagina on humanitarian grounds. 
The Rwandan genocide is considered one 
of the deadliest and most brutal tragedies in 
the history of humankind. In just 100 days, 
more than 800,000 Tutsis and moderate Hutus 
were systematically assaulted, raped, and 
slaughtered by the Rwandan and Interahamwe 
militaries. And except for a few peacekeeping 
forces, the international community at large re-
fused to get involved—leaving any resistance 
efforts to come from within the country. 
That’s when Paul Rusesabagina stepped in. 
As the manager at a hotel in the capital city 
of Kigali at the time, he was credited for hous-
ing and feeding more than 1,200 Tutsi and 
Hutu refugees during the genocide. He knew 
that the consequences of his efforts would put 
both himself and his family in danger, but he 
still chose to help his people in their greatest 
hour of need. 
Now, the Rwandan government has con-
victed, detained, and reportedly tortured Mr. 
Rusesabagina on charges stemming from a 
trial that the State Department and American 
Bar Association considered unfair and irrep-
arable. He has also been denied the medical 
attention required as a cancer survivor and in-
dividual suffering from a cardiovascular dis-
order. 
By passing this resolution, the House of 
Representatives will join several other inter-
national democratic bodies to express concern 
over his conviction and call for his immediate 
release. We will also urge the United States 
Government to continue to raise awareness 
about Mr. Rusesabagina’s case and convey 
our support to his friends, family, and loved 
ones. 
Mr. Speaker, Paul Rusesabagina’s story re-
minds us that hope can be found even during 
our darkest days. I would urge my colleagues 
to support this resolution. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentlewoman from North Carolina 
(Ms. MANNING) that the House suspend 
the rules and agree to the resolution, 
H. Res. 892, as amended. 
The question was taken. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the 
opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being 
in the affirmative, the ayes have it. 
Mr. CLOUD. Mr. Speaker, on that I 
demand the yeas and nays. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to section 3(s) of House Resolution 
8, the yeas and nays are ordered. 
Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, fur-
ther proceedings on this motion are 
postponed.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to clause 12(a) of rule I, the Chair

utes p.m.), the House stood in recess.

COMMUNICATION FROM THE 
CLERK OF THE HOUSE 
The SPEAKER laid before the House 
the following communication from the 
Clerk of the House of Representatives: 
OFFICE OF THE CLERK, 
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, 
Washington, DC, June 15, 2022. 
Hon. NANCY PELOSI, 
Speaker, House of Representatives, 
Washington, DC. 
DEAR MADAM SPEAKER: I have the honor to 
transmit herewith a scanned copy of a letter 
received from Mr. Keith Ingrain, Elections 
Director, Texas Office of the Secretary of 
State, indicating that, according to the pre-
liminary results of the Special Election held 
June 14, 2022, the Honorable Mayra Flores 
was elected Representative to Congress for 
the Thirty-Fourth Congressional District, 
State of Texas. 
With best wishes, I am 
Sincerely, 
CHERYL L.JOHNSON, 
Clerk. 
THE STATE OF TEXAS, 
ELECTIONS DIVISION, 
Austin, Texas, June 15, 2022. 
Hon. CHERYL L. JOHNSON, 
Clerk, House of Representatives, 
Washington, DC. 
DEAR MS. JOHNSON: This is to advise you 
that the unofficial results of the Special 
Election held on Tuesday, June 14, 2022, for 
Representative in Congress from the 34th 
Congressional District of Texas, show that 
Mayra Flores received 14,780 or 50.98% of the 
total number of votes cast for that office. 
It would appear from these unofficial re-
sults that Mayra Flores was elected as Rep-
resentative in Congress from the 34th Con-
gressional District of Texas. 
To the best of our knowledge and belief at 
this time, there is no contest to this elec-
tion. 
As soon as the official results are certified 
to this office by all counties involved and 
certified by the Governor of Texas, an offi-
cial Certificate of Election will be prepared 
for transmittal as required by law. 
Sincerely, 
KEITH INGRAM, 
Director of Elections. 
f 
SWEARING IN OF THE HONORABLE 
MAYRA FLORES, OF TEXAS, AS 
A MEMBER OF THE HOUSE 
Mr. DOGGETT. Madam Speaker, I 
ask unanimous consent that the gen-
tlewoman from Texas, the Honorable 
MAYRA FLORES, be permitted to take 
the oath of office this evening. 
Her certificate of election has not ar-
rived, but there is no contest and no 
question has been raised with regard to 
her election. 
The SPEAKER. Is there objection to 
the request of the gentleman from 
Texas? 
There was no objection. 
The SPEAKER. Will the Representa-
tive-elect and the members of the 
Texas delegation present themselves in 
the well. 
All Members will rise and the Rep-
resentative-elect will please raise her 
right hand. 
Mrs. FLORES appeared at the bar of 
the House and took the oath of office, 
as follows: 
Do you solemnly swear that you will 
support and defend the Constitution of 
the United States against all enemies, 
foreign and domestic; that you will 
bear true faith and allegiance to the 
same; that you take this obligation 
freely, without any mental reservation 
or purpose of evasion; and that you will 
well and faithfully discharge the duties 
of the office on which you are about to 
enter, so help you God. 
The SPEAKER. Congratulations, you 
are now a Member of the 117th Con-
gress. 
f 
WELCOMING 
THE 
HONORABLE 
MAYRA FLORES TO THE HOUSE 
OF REPRESENTATIVES 
The SPEAKER. Without objection, 
the gentleman from Texas (Mr. DOG-
GETT) is recognized for 1 minute. 
There was no objection. 
Mr. DOGGETT. Madam Speaker, cen-
tral to the preservation of our democ-
racy is recognition of the results of fair 
elections you lose just as much, if not 
more, than the elections which you 
win. Tonight, we welcome to this 
Chamber a new Member and recognize 
a fairly won Republican victory in my 
home State for the 6 months remaining 
this year in the term of our recent col-
league, Filemon Vela, who resigned. 
MAYRA FLORES was born and raised 
in Tamaulipas, Mexico. She came le-
gally to the United States at 6 years 
old with the help of her father and be-
came a naturalized American citizen. 
MAYRA graduated in 2014 as a res-
piratory care practitioner and cur-
rently works caring for those with 
chronic respiratory issues. With Latino 
Texans bearing a very disproportionate 
burden from the pandemic, she has 
been on the front lines combating 
COVID. She graduated from South 
Texas College, and her husband serves 
as a Border Patrol agent. Mayra will be 
the first Mexican-born woman to serve 
in the House and the first Hispanic Re-
publican woman to serve in our Texas 
delegation. 
She ran a very vigorous campaign. I 
congratulate her on her success. I see 
that she brings a beautiful family to 
our Chamber. I look forward to work-
ing with her this year. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman from Texas (Mr. BRADY), who is 
the senior Texas Republican in my 
Ways and Means Committee. 
Mr. BRADY. Madam Speaker, on this 
day in 1788, the United States Constitu-
tion was ratified making that remark-
able document the law of this land, and 
it began with those immortal words: 
‘‘We the People.’’ 
So 234 years to the day after that call 
to create a more perfect Union, the 
U.S. House of Representatives makes 
history today with the inspiring swear-
ing in of the first Mexican-born Mem-
ber of Congress, MAYRA
FLORES
of 
Texas. 
There is so much to be impressed by 
with MAYRA. She was born and raised 
with humble beginnings in Burgos, 
Mexico. From a young age, her parents 
and 
grandparents 
raised 
her 
with 
strong conservative values of faith, 
family, and hard work. 
She came legally to the United 
States at 6 years old, and with the en-
thusiastic help of her father, she be-
came a proud, naturalized American 
citizen. Growing up, MAYRA
worked 
alongside her parents in the cotton 
fields in Memphis, Texas, to earn extra 
money for school supplies and clothes. 
With the support of her family, MAYRA 
graduated as a respiratory care practi-
tioner and has worked ever since to 
care for the elderly and the disabled. 
She did serve on the front lines help-
ing patients combat COVID–19 and re-
mains every day an active member of 
her community in south Texas. She re-
mains a firm believer in the American 
Dream—it is a dream she is living—and 
will always fight so that others can 
achieve it, as she has. 
A proud wife and mother of four, her 
husband serves as a Border Patrol 
agent in the Rio Grande Valley work-
ing to protect our country during an 
unprecedented border crisis. 
So on behalf of the entire Texas dele-
gation, please welcome with me to the 
United States Congress the Honorable 
MAYRA FLORES, her husband John, and 
their four beautiful children. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tlewoman from Texas (Mrs. FLORES). 
Mrs. FLORES. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to give a voice to the voiceless 
and to say that the people who live and 
work in south Texas have had enough. 
We want to be heard, and we are tired 
of being treated like second-class citi-
zens. 
I was born in Burgos, Tamaulipas, 
Mexico, and raised with strong values 
to always put God and family first. My 
father, Saul Flores, moved us to the 
United States because of the promise of 
America. He told me that in this coun-
try, if you work hard, you can accom-
plish anything. My story proves he is 
right. 
But right now our people are strug-
gling. They are taken for granted. That 
ends now. 
I am here. I have risen from working 
in the cotton fields to representing the 
community I love in the United States 
Congress. And I will give them a voice. 
I will use it to say: Our lives are not a 
game. Our people deserve to have op-
portunity, security, and freedom, and I 
will work every day to give it to them. 
I am a proud Border Patrol wife and 
a mother of four young children fight-
ing for a better future for them and for 
all our children.

REMOVAL OF NAME OF MEMBER 
AS COSPONSOR OF H.R. 6538 
Ms. LETLOW. Mr. Speaker, I hereby

The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tlewoman’s request is accepted.

LOWERING COSTS FOR AMERICA’S 
FAMILIES 
(Ms. GARCIA of Texas asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
her remarks.) 
Ms. GARCIA of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I 
rise to recognize the House Democrats’ 
efforts to lower rising costs that 
threaten and burden our American 
families. 
Putin’s cruel war in Ukraine is rising 
prices across our Nation and the world, 
but Democrats are taking decisive ac-
tion. 
Last week, we passed the Lower Food 
and Fuel Costs Act. This bill will re-
duce our dependence on foreign fer-
tilizer production, strengthen competi-
tion in the meat and poultry sector, 
and strengthen our supply chain. 
It will also expand access to cleaner 
Unleaded 88 gas that costs an average 
of 40 cents less per gallon. These steps 
for Democrats will go a long way, Mr. 
Speaker, to protect American families 
from Putin’s inflation. 
Yet, some extreme MAGA Repub-
licans continue to side with greedy cor-
porations and billionaires instead of 
hardworking families. 
I call on our Republican colleagues to 
work with us in our efforts to lower 
costs for all families across America. 
The time to act is now.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5719 
June 21, 2022 
Mrs. KIM of California. Mr. Speaker, 
I rise today to honor the life of Otto 
Frederick Warmbier. He is an Amer-
ican who was horrifically tortured and 
killed by the North Korean regime 5 
years ago. 
Otto was a dedicated young man. He 
was the valedictorian of his high school 
and at the University of Virginia. At 
the age of 22, he was taken hostage and 
suffered the worst of the North Korean 
regime’s brutality. 
Although Otto is no longer with us, 
his wonderful family carries on his leg-
acy every day with their advocacy and 
strength. 
As one of the first Korean-American 
women to serve in Congress, and as a 
member of the House Foreign Affairs 
Committee, I will always—always—be 
a loud voice for global human rights 
and hold violators accountable. 
We remember and honor Otto always. 
f 
SUPPORTING OUR VETERANS 
(Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of 
New York asked and was given permis-
sion to address the House for 1 minute.) 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong sup-
port of the Honoring our PACT Act, 
which will ensure comprehensive bene-
fits and care for our troops who suffer 
from toxic exposure, especially from 
burn pits. 
I thank Chairman TAKANO once again 
for his leadership, and it is now time 
for us to finally send this bill to Presi-
dent Biden’s desk. 
As a daughter, sister, and wife of a 
veteran, caring for our veterans is ex-
tremely important to me, as it should 
be to every American. The Honoring 
our PACT Act will help over 3 million 
suffering veterans and ensure that they 
can get the care that they need. 
I note especially the similarities be-
tween this bill and my 9/11 Health and 
Compensation Act which supports the 
9/11 first responders who were exposed 
to dangerous toxins that made them 
sick, still to this day. 
Our veterans were there for us. We 
must be there for them. We should all 
support this important bill. 
f 
HONORING THE LIFE OF WILSON 
STONE 
(Mr. COMER asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. COMER. Mr. Speaker, today I 
rise to honor the life of former State 
representative Wilson Stone. Wilson 
was a passionate public servant who 
spent his career fighting for Kentucky. 
Wilson served as State representative 
of the Kentucky General Assembly for 
12 years. During his time, he served as 
chairman of the State House Agri-
culture Committee and pursued mean-
ingful improvements to Kentucky’s 
public education system. I had the 
honor of serving in the State House 
with Wilson Stone. 
Before serving in the State legisla-
ture, Wilson was an influential member 
of the Allen County Board of Edu-
cation. It is a position he held for a re-
markable 24 years. 
In the spare time that he did have, 
Wilson was a farmer. Wilson was a true 
leader with a sincere drive to improve 
Kentucky. 
On behalf of the First Congressional 
District, I send my sincerest condo-
lences to Wilson’s family, friends, and 
neighbors. His life touched many, and 
our Commonwealth is better off be-
cause of his service.

SOUND AND SENSIBLE SOLUTIONS 
(Ms. BROWN of Ohio asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
her remarks.) 
Ms. BROWN of Ohio. Mr. Speaker, 
last week, House Democrats took ag-
gressive action to address rising food 
prices by passing the Lowering Food 
and Fuel Costs Act. 
The bill would lower costs by doing 
three things: 
First, it will reduce our dependence 
on overseas fertilizer production. Rus-
sia and Ukraine are major producers of 
fertilizer. Putin’s war on Ukraine has 
driven up the cost of fertilizer for our 
farmers, and, therefore, for critical sta-
ples on our grocery store shelves. 
Second, the bill will also crack down 
on unfair, anticompetitive practices in 
the meat and poultry sector, helping to 
drive down the prices of meat products. 
Third, and finally, it would expand 
access to cleaner ethanol blends that 
cost, on average, 40 cents less per gal-
lon. This will help ease the pain at the 
pump. 
These provisions may sound tech-
nical, but they are sound and sensible 
solutions to lower prices for America’s 
families in the grocery aisle and at the 
gas pump.

COMMENDING DARRIS SMITH ON 
HIS ATHLETIC ACHIEVEMENTS 
(Mr. CARTER of Georgia asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and 
extend his remarks.) 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, I rise today to honor Darris Smith 
for his outstanding athletic achieve-
ments, having won two State track ti-
tles for Appling County High School in 
Baxley, Georgia. 
The senior took home first place in 
the Georgia High School Association 
Class 3A 400-meter individual race in 
Carrollton, as well as the gold medal 
on Appling County’s 4x400-meter relay 
team. 
Darris is not your typical track star. 
The 6-foot-6-inch, 230-pound runner is 
also a standout basketball player as 
well as one of the top football recruits 
in the Nation, committed to playing 
linebacker at the University of Geor-
gia. Go Dawgs. 
He finished his high school football 
career rated as the Nation’s number 14 
defensive end and the number 162 over-
all prospect for 2022. 
These unbelievable achievements are 
worth appreciation and will inspire the 
next generation of athletes to push for 
their goals. 
Congratulations, Darris. We are all 
excited to see where your talent and 
hard work take you. Go Dawgs.

CONGRATULATING DIAMOND HILL- 
JARVIS HIGH SCHOOL ATHLETES 
(Mr. VEASEY asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. VEASEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to celebrate the accomplish-
ments of Angel Sanchez of Fort Worth, 
who 
recently 
represented 
Diamond 
Hill-Jarvis High School and made his-
tory by winning the State’s first track 
and field medal with a gold in the 1600. 
Additionally, his accomplishments got 
him recognized as DFW’s boys’ track 
athlete of the week. 
I am very proud of Angel for rep-
resenting the city of Fort Worth at the 
State level, and I am proud of the en-
tire Diamond Hill-Jarvis High School 
for all of their recent athletic accom-
plishments. 
Last year, Diamond Hill-Jarvis High 
School’s boys’ soccer team headed to 
the State finals, making them the 
first-ever team in school history to 
make it to the State UIL championship 
in any sport. 
Once again, Angel, and everyone at 
Diamond Hill, you should be proud of 
all of your accomplishments. Keep up 
the good work. Angel, I look forward to 
seeing you race in Portland.

CONGRATULATING DALE MOORE 
ON HIS RETIREMENT 
(Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania 
asked and was given permission to ad-

vise and extend his remarks.) 
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor the distin-
guished career of Mr. Dale Moore as he 
celebrates his retirement from the 
American Farm Bureau Federation. 
For 40 years, Dale has been an instru-
mental leader in agriculture policy. 
Dale earned his bachelor’s degree in 
animal science from Fort Hays State 
University. Dale then began his profes-
sional career as a legislative assistant 
to former U.S. Congressman and Sen-
ator 
Pat 
Roberts. 
Dale 
then 
transitioned to the House Committee 
on Agriculture to serve as legislative 
director while Mr. Roberts was chair-
man. 
After years of hard work on Capitol 
Hill, Dale served as executive director 
of the National Cattlemen’s Beef Asso-
ciation. Dale then became the USDA’s 
chief of staff for all four Secretaries 
under President George W. Bush. 
Dale has spent the last 11 years of his 
career with the American Farm Bureau

HONORING THE LIFE OF MASTER 
SERGEANT CHRISTOPHER NEAL 
HOUSER 
(Mr. BURCHETT asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. BURCHETT. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
to recognize Master Sergeant Chris-
topher Neal Houser as Tennessee’s Sec-
ond District’s Veteran of the Month. 
He served in the United States Air 
Force during the Gulf war, the war on 
terrorism, and the Cold War. 
Chris was raised in Clinton, Ten-
nessee, and graduated from Clinton 
High School in 1980. He then attended 
Tennessee Tech University, where he 
received his degree in business admin-
istration and business management. On 
July 23, 1982, he enlisted in the Ten-
nessee Air National Guard, and he 
served his country for over 31 years, 
Mr. Speaker, with the 134th Air Refuel-
ing Wing as a personnel specialist. 
Outside of his military life, Chris was 
known as a bit of a hometown hero for 
all the time that he gave to Blount 
County student athletics. He coached 
Little League baseball, youth basket-
ball, and football, and he volunteered 
at William Blount High School to work 
with the baseball and softball teams as 
the field guy for over 17 years. The 
softball field is now named after him in 
honor of his many years of volunteer 
service. 
Just a few weeks ago, on May 24, 2022, 
unfortunately, Chris passed away after 
a 9-year battle with lung cancer, with 
his family by his side. I offer my condo-
lences to his wife of 36 years, Donna; 
his children, Drew, Jessica, and Jen-
nifer; his mother, Jean; and the many 
other family members and friends who 
loved him dearly right up to the end. 
It is my honor to stand here today 
and commemorate Chris’ lifetime of 
service to his country and to his com-
munity by naming him as Tennessee’s 
Second 
District’s 
Veteran 
of 
the 
Month.

DEMOCRATS SIMPLY DID NOT 
LISTEN 
(Mr. ROSE asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. ROSE. Mr. Speaker, our country 
is in an inflation crisis caused by the 
Biden administration’s failed leftwing, 
progressive policies. 
We have families who can’t find baby 
formula for their newborns, grocery 
stores with empty shelves, workers fill-
ing up their gas tanks for twice what 
they paid 2 years ago, and farmers pay-
ing triple for fertilizer compared to 
two harvests ago. 
H.R. 7606, the bill that passed the 
House last week, will do nothing to 
combat these crises in the immediate 
future. Instead, Congress should con-
sider a bill introduced by the gen-
tleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. THOMP-
SON), my friend and ranking member of 
the House Agriculture Committee. 
H.R. 8069, the Reducing Farm Input 
Costs and Barriers to Production Act, 
will work to immediately combat ris-
ing food and fuel costs and has the sup-
port from our farmers, ranchers, and 
producers. 
However, 
once 
again, 
Democrats 
passed a bill that doesn’t fix our prob-
lems, nor does it increase our domestic 
food or fuel production, and they blame 
everything on Republicans. Let the 
record show we offered real solutions, 
and Democrats simply did not listen. 
f 
COST OF LIVING IS MORE THAN 
REPORTED 
(Mr. GROTHMAN asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Mr. GROTHMAN. Mr. Speaker, this 
is directed to the press as much as to 
the Chair and whoever is listening at 
home. 
Everybody knows we have a lot of in-
flation. We are supposed to repeat 
again and again that inflation was at 
8.6 percent in May, which is the highest 
it has been in 40 years. The press 
should report that there is no way in-
flation is only 8.6 percent. 
Housing is listed as going up 5.5 per-
cent. Have you talked to any land-
lords? Have you talked to any builders? 
There is a contorted way that you ar-
rive at that 5.5 percent. That number 
should be more like 15 to 20 to 25 per-
cent. 
Talk to some car dealers. See if they 
think the cost of used cars has gone up 
only 16.1 percent in the last year. That 
number should be 30 percent. 
We should not let the administration 
get away with such low numbers. I call 
upon the American press to do a little 
bit of research for once and tell us 
what the real cost of living has gone up 
in this country over the last year. It is 
way more than 8.6 percent.

RELEASE ALEX DRUEKE AND 
ANDY HUYNH 
(Ms. JACKSON LEE asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
her remarks.) 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I 
rise to assert the sovereignty of the 
United States of America, to applaud 
the bipartisan commitment to the 
Ukrainians who are fighting for democ-
racy, and to acknowledge Alex Drueke 
and Andy Huynh, who are fighting as 
volunteers in the Ukrainian Army and 
have now been captured by the enemy. 
The enemy wants to call them a 
name that I refuse to say on the floor 
of the House. They are, in fact, volun-
teers, and they should be subject to the 
international obligations that Russia 
must adhere to and must look at the 
conventions that may be relevant. 
Their lives must be protected. They are 
soldiers who desired to fight for democ-
racy. 
I am proud of them, as I am of the 
Americans who are held around the 
world 
falsely, 
in 
particular 
Paul 
Whelan and Brittney Griner, who are 
held as hostages in Russia. They are 
wrongly held, and I ask that we pursue 
this as Americans and the American 
Government to help release Brittney 
Griner, release Paul Whelan, stop the 
false judicial system and legal system 
of Russia, and bring our Americans 
home. 
We should not leave Alex Drueke and 
Andy Huynh on the battlefield. We 
need to protect them as a sovereign na-
tion.

REPUBLICAN STUDY COMMITTEE’S 
BLUEPRINT TO SAVE AMERICA 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. 
AUCHINCLOSS). Under the Speaker’s an-
nounced policy of January 4, 2021, the 
gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr. HERN) 
is recognized for 60 minutes as the des-
ignee of the minority leader. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. HERN. Mr. Speaker, I ask unani-
mous consent that all Members may 
have 5 legislative days in which to re-
vise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on the topic 
of this Special Order. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Oklahoma? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. HERN. Mr. Speaker, America is 
in crisis. Inflation is at its highest in 
four decades. Drugs, weapons, and all 
other manner of contraband, along 
with hundreds of thousands of unvetted 
migrants, are pouring over our south-
ern border with almost no resistance. 
Our national debt is over $30 trillion, a 
sum of money that most people cannot 
even begin to comprehend. 
Suffice to say, the past 18 months of 
Democratic rule have been a disaster. 
The American people are sick and tired 
of their government recklessly spend-
ing their tax dollars while families 
struggle to put food on the table and 
fill up their gas tanks. 
Can you blame them? Families across 
the country are sitting at home trying 
to make ends meet while the Federal 
Government runs around and spends 
their money like it is going out of 
style. 
President Biden often likes to tout 
his understanding of kitchen-table eco-
nomics. However, the so-called budget 
that the President produced a few 
months ago never balances and adds

trillions of dollars to our national debt 
over the next 10 years. There isn’t a 
single kitchen table in the country 
where you can spend more than you 
make year after year and survive fi-
nancially. 
One of Speaker PELOSI’s most famous 
phrases is: Show me your budget, and I 
will show you your values. It is plain 
to see that Democrats care little for fi-
nancial responsibility and a strong 
American economy. They won’t even 
draft a budget. 
I have been in Congress 4 years, and 
under Speaker PELOSI’s leadership, the 
Democrats have not created a single 
budget in the House Budget Com-
mittee. If Congress continues down this 
path, we will add $15.1 trillion to the 
debt this decade, $24.2 trillion in the 
2030s, and $41.8 trillion in the 2040s. 
These are incomprehensible numbers. 
It is long past time to return to a 
state of fiscal stability. That is where 
the 
Republican 
Study 
Committee’s 
budget comes in. Our Blueprint to Save 
America isn’t just hyperbole. It is a no- 
nonsense plan that slashes spending, 
reduces deficits, and bolsters our econ-
omy, all things that the President’s 
budget fails to do. 
It is the most pro-life budget that the 
RSC has ever produced. It ensures the 
protection 
of 
Americans’ 
constitu-
tional rights. It solidifies our national 
security and secures our southern bor-
der. It saves Medicare and Social Secu-
rity from insolvency. 
While the President’s budget in-
creases spending to $73 trillion and 
taxes to $58 trillion, our budget de-
creases spending by $6.7 trillion, all 
while balancing in just 7 years. This is 
exactly what our country needs right 
now. 
Tonight, we are going to hear from 
the hardworking men and women who 
helped create this budget and who are 
committed to putting these policies 
into action next year. 
I thank all the members of the Budg-
et and Spending Task Force for all of 
their extremely hard work over the 
past months, as well as Chairman JIM 
BANKS for trusting me with chairing 
this task force for a second year. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman 
from Pennsylvania (Mr. KELLER), my 
friend from the 12th District, a member 
of the Education and Labor Com-
mittee, and a member of our task 
force. 
b 1930 
Mr. KELLER. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman for yielding time and 
for his hard work. 
Mr. Speaker, it has been a year-and- 
a-half of President Biden and Wash-
ington Democrats’ disastrous tax-and- 
spend policies, and American families 
are feeling the effects of rising infla-
tion in their paychecks, at the gas 
pumps, and in the grocery store. 
Instead of working to eliminate 
wasteful 
government 
spending, 
the 
President’s 2023 budget calls for the 
highest sustained spending burden in 
American history, $73 trillion over 10 
years, all at the expense of our children 
and grandchildren, who will be forced 
to pay for this outrageous spending and 
debt. 
Going to Speaker PELOSI’s ‘‘Show me 
your budget, and I will show you what 
you value,’’ I have my granddaughter 
with me tonight. I value her future. I 
value the fact that she is not going to 
have to pay for this spending, that she 
will be able to keep more of the money 
she earns instead of having the govern-
ment take it to pay for Speaker 
PELOSI’s and President Biden’s liberal 
agenda. 
The Republican Study Committee’s 
budget is a departure from Democrats’ 
irresponsible policies and a return to 
fiscal sanity for American families. 
Republicans have built a comprehen-
sive plan that balances the Federal 
budget in just 7 years, works to elimi-
nate waste, and enables Americans to 
keep more of their hard-earned money. 
Growing up in America, raising a 
family, and running a business taught 
me that budgets matter. 
After reading President Biden’s 2023 
budget, it is clear he doesn’t have a 
clue on how to budget responsibly. It is 
time we stop leaving financial disaster 
for the next generation. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank Congressman 
HERN and my colleagues on the Repub-
lican Study Committee for their work 
in putting forth a responsible budget 
that meets the needs of the American 
people, places the American people 
first, and doesn’t cater to the wishes of 
Joe Biden and NANCY PELOSI. 
Mr. HERN. Mr. Speaker, I thank the 
gentleman for his hard work over the 
last 6 months to arrive at this budget. 
It is not a conservative budget; it is an 
all-of-America budget. It is what all 
Americans have to do, create a budget. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman 
from Wisconsin (Mr. TIFFANY), another 
member of the task force and a mem-
ber of the Committee on Natural Re-
sources, from Wisconsin’s Seventh Dis-
trict. 
Mr. TIFFANY. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman for his leadership and 
giving me the opportunity to speak 
here tonight. 
Mr. Speaker, while it is not sur-
prising that Congress’ budget process is 
a total and utter failure, the good news 
is that there are solutions to cut down 
on excessive spending, balance our 
budget, and prevent the world’s largest 
economy from self-destructing. 
The American people know this. 
When you go back home and talk to 
the American people, they know what 
is going on here is wrong. They know 
that the family checkbook only goes so 
far. Choices have to be made. They 
know the American family’s check-
book out here in Washington, D.C., 
should live under the same constraints. 
The solution is not to propose a 
budget with the highest sustained lev-
els of spending since World War II, as 
President Biden has done, or to spend 
taxpayers’ dollars at a faster pace than 
at any point in history, as Congress has 
done the past 2 years. The solution is 
to stop spending like there is no tomor-
row and be fiscally responsible. 
With inflation at a 40-year high, gas 
prices shattering new records, and 
home prices surging, as the gentleman 
from Oklahoma said, I believe every ef-
fort must be made to rein in wasteful 
Washington spending and ensure that 
taxpayer dollars are not being thrown 
down the drain. 
Simply 
put, 
instead 
of 
spending 
money as fast as Joe Biden leaves for a 
Delaware vacation, it is time for fiscal 
responsibility in Washington. This in-
cludes implementing good-government 
reforms, like balancing our budget for 
the first time in over 20 years, which 
this budget by the RSC does. 
I thank the chairman for including a 
piece of legislation that I introduced 
called the Agriculture Civil Rights and 
Equality Act, ACRE. 
You 
might 
remember 
last 
year, 
Democrats in the American Rescue 
Plan provided billions in debt relief as-
sistance to some farmers, while exclud-
ing others, based entirely on the color 
of their skin. That is detestable. That 
is un-American. 
The ACRE Act will ensure that this 
never happens again by explicitly bar-
ring the USDA from discriminating 
against or granting preferential treat-
ment to any person, in whole or in 
part, 
based 
on 
race. 
Taxpayers 
shouldn’t be forced to finance unfair, 
unconstitutional racial quota systems. 
One of the main reasons I ran for this 
office is the same reason that I ran in 
2010. In Wisconsin, we had a $3 billion 
deficit. We all remember, after the 2008 
election, the policies that were put in 
place in the ensuing 2 years were disas-
trous for America. Sounds familiar, 
doesn’t it? The same thing is a rewind 
from back in that period of time. 
I told my constituents we can fix the 
budget problems we had in Wisconsin. 
Some people said: Yeah, we hear that 
all the time. I said: You give us a dec-
ade, and we will get it done. We did ex-
actly that. 
Over the three terms that I sat on 
the budget writing committee in the 
State of Wisconsin, if you look at 
where their budget is now as a result of 
the little bit of work that I contributed 
to, along with my colleagues in the 
State legislature, we fixed those budget 
problems in Wisconsin. Now there is 
the largest rainy day fund in the his-
tory of Wisconsin. This past budget re-
turned $2 billion to the taxpayers of 
the State. That is fiscal responsibility. 
We can do the same here in Wash-
ington, D.C., but it is going to require 
the will to do it. We can do it over the 
next decade, as the chairman said. We 
get to balance in 7 years here. This is 
what the American people are looking 
for. They want us to be fiscally respon-
sible because it will lead to more op-
portunity and prosperity here in Amer-
ica and ensure American liberty for the 
future. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge both Democrats 
and Republicans to say ‘‘yes’’ to the

RSC budget, because it is good for 
America. 
Mr. HERN. Mr. Speaker, I thank my 
friend from Wisconsin for his words. 
What you just heard is what most of 
America experiences in our individual 
families, our businesses, our cities, and 
our States. They have to balance their 
budget. It is hard work. It doesn’t 
know any partisanship. It is constitu-
tional and has to be done. 
One of the first, primary things we 
should be doing as Members of Con-
gress is being good stewards of Amer-
ican taxpayer dollars. But what I fear 
is that after people have been here for 
a period of time we lose sight of that. 
It is not our money; it is the American 
people’s money. 
We need to be accountable to that. 
We need to not be running up $30 tril-
lion debts and another $15 trillion on 
the horizon with the President’s budg-
et, the only Democrat budget that has 
been put out, that increases the debt to 
$45 trillion in the next 10 years, assum-
ing he can get $7 trillion in additional 
taxes out of small businesses and indi-
viduals in America by allowing the Tax 
Cuts and Jobs Act’s tax cuts to expire. 
The American people deserve better. 
We in Congress need to work hard to-
gether. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman 
from Pennsylvania (Mr. JOYCE), my 
dear friend from Pennsylvania’s 13th 
District, who is on the Energy and 
Commerce Committee and a fellow 
classmate of mine. 
Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania. Mr. 
Speaker, I thank the gentleman from 
Oklahoma for holding this incredibly 
important Special Order, and I thank 
him for yielding. 
Since day 1 of his Presidency, Joe 
Biden has chosen to weaponize his 
power to attack the energy industry 
and raise the price of gasoline for 
Pennsylvania drivers. This impact fi-
nancially, for every Pennsylvanian, 
and in fact, for every American citizen, 
is being felt tonight as we hold this 
Special Order. 
By canceling the Keystone XL pipe-
line, by canceling new drilling leases, 
and by suggesting that the energy be-
neath the feet of my constituents is 
not an acceptable source of power, 
President Biden has turned his back on 
American energy. Sadly, he has turned 
his back on the American people. Be-
cause of the President’s policies, Amer-
ica right now is drilling less oil than 
before the start of the COVID–19 pan-
demic. 
To counter this war on American en-
ergy, I am proud to be working with 
my colleagues to introduce the Blue-
print to Save America and to help re-
turn our Nation to energy dominance. 
Not just energy independence, but en-
ergy dominance. 
It 
is 
time 
to 
reverse 
President 
Biden’s executive actions to stop new 
drilling. It is time to produce the coal, 
the oil, the natural gas, and the 
Marcellus shale that is needed to power 
our cities, our communities, and our 
grids. 
I thank the gentleman for holding 
this Special Order tonight to bring at-
tention to the roadmap that we have 
built to return our country to that 
needed energy dominance. 
President Ronald Reagan once said 
that 
we 
maintain 
‘‘peace 
through 
strength.’’ By rebuilding our energy in-
frastructure and once again becoming a 
net energy exporter, we can help our 
allies while at the same time lowering 
the price of energy right here in Amer-
ica. 
I look forward to continuing to advo-
cate for this budget that will help my 
constituents back home in Pennsyl-
vania. 
Mr. Speaker, again, I thank my col-
league, Representative HERN, for hold-
ing this Special Order. 
Mr. HERN. Mr. Speaker, I thank my 
friend and colleague from Pennsyl-
vania for his words. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman 
from Arkansas (Mr. HILL), a dear friend 
of mine, somebody that knows a lot 
about budgets and finances in his per-
sonal life, a member of the Financial 
Services Committee, and a longtime 
study of what it takes to balance a 
budget in America. 
Mr. HILL. Mr. Speaker, I thank my 
friend from Oklahoma (Mr. HERN), the 
chairman of our task force, and all of 
the members of the task force, for com-
ing together and showing the American 
people that Congress can debate, ana-
lyze, think through, and consider what 
it takes to balance our budget. KEVIN 
HERN has delivered that leadership. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in favor of 
the 
Republican 
Study 
Committee’s 
budget proposal for fiscal year 2023. I 
am proud to be a contributing member 
of the Republican Study Committee. 
This RSC budget would not only rein 
in reckless spending, but it would also 
balance the Nation’s budget over the 
next decade. 
By making President Trump’s Tax 
Cuts and Jobs Act permanent, this 
budget 
would 
provide 
hardworking 
American families with immediate re-
lief, something we desperately need 
amid Joe Biden’s highest inflation in 
four decades. 
This 
budget 
also 
works 
toward 
strengthening our national security, 
starting with the crisis at our south-
west border. Last month, Mr. Speaker, 
Customs and Border Protection re-
ported that 234,416 illegal migrant en-
counters occurred along our border, the 
highest 1-month total ever recorded. 
This budget would restore the Trump- 
era policies that secured our border 
and kept our communities safe, pre-
venting startling statistics like that 
one I just noted. 
This budget is sensible, it is realistic, 
and it is beneficial for all of our Amer-
ican families. 
I am pleased that two of my legisla-
tive items that I have placed priority 
on in this Congress were included in 
this budget package: The Price Sta-
bility Act and the Social Security Dis-
ability Insurance Return to Work Act. 
First, the Price Stability Act, which 
I was pleased to introduce earlier this 
year alongside my good friend and col-
league, BYRON DONALDS, from Florida. 
At a time when the American people 
are currently spending an additional 
$460 a month, Mr. Speaker, nearly 
$5,000 more this year than people were 
spending last year to keep up with 
President Biden’s inflation, the rising 
cost of gas at the pump, and groceries 
at the store, this bill would have the 
Federal Reserve focus on a single man-
date, that of price stability, concen-
trating on keeping prices down, and 
preventing inflation from stealing from 
American families. 
The second bill, the Social Security 
Disability Insurance Return to Work 
Act, which I reintroduced this year, 
would restructure the Social Security 
Administration’s disability classifica-
tion system to provide further opportu-
nities to individuals with disabilities 
who can and want to get back to work. 
That is important, because too many 
people go on our Social Security dis-
ability system and don’t get back to 
the workforce. This provides them fi-
nancial incentives, training, and oppor-
tunity to go back to work, something 
our workforce and our employers des-
perately need. It gives dignity to those 
who can get back into the workforce. 
b 1945 
These policies would both reduce gov-
ernment spending while ensuring that 
we put the needs of the American peo-
ple first. 
I thank the Republican Study Com-
mittee chairman, JIM
BANKS, Task 
Force Chairman HERN, for their hard 
work and leadership in developing this 
budget. This commonsense legislative 
agenda combats inflation while sup-
porting a healthy economy. It works 
for the betterment of our families long- 
term. 
I am proud of the provisions that 
were included in the budget. I am 
happy to express my support for the 
budget and for the work of the task 
force. 
Mr. HERN. Mr. Speaker, I thank the 
gentleman from Arkansas for his words 
and for his personal knowledge of how 
the budget is so important to all the 
American people. 
You have heard a lot from my col-
leagues about pieces of legislation to 
be included in this budget. Some 203 
pieces of legislation by some 82 Mem-
bers of the Republican Party have been 
included in this budget to design and 
develop and produce a balanced budget 
for all Americans. All Americans sit-
ting at their table, they don’t look and 
see first if they are Democrat or Re-
publican. They don’t care about poli-
tics when it comes to spending. 
Members of Congress talk about how 
they care about the least of us in our 
economy across America. If we cared, 
we would sit down and work together 
to produce a balanced budget, one like 
we haven’t seen in over 20 years. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman 
from Utah (Mr. MOORE), my colleague

H5723 
June 21, 2022 
from Utah’s First Congressional Dis-
trict, and an outstanding freshman 
member on the Armed Services Com-
mittee. 
Mr. MOORE of Utah. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank Congressman HERN
for orga-
nizing this Special Order tonight and 
for his leadership on the Republican 
Study Committee. 
Mr. Speaker, I frequently reach out 
to my constituents and conduct poll-
ing, if you will, on what are the issues 
that matter most to them. And at the 
top of the list, every single time, is 
debt and deficit. It is constantly debt 
and deficit. I know that is on the minds 
of many Americans, but particularly in 
Utah, where we are so fiscally smart 
that we have a balanced budget, and we 
have a rainy day fund. We are still the 
most philanthropic State in volunteer 
time and dollars than anywhere else in 
the Nation. But we care so deeply 
about being smart fiscally that what I 
ultimately take from this, and as I 
look back on the last 20 or so years of 
our inability to do this, Americans 
need confidence that their Congress, 
that their government can actually do 
something practical and reasonable. 
And that is what we have here in front 
of us, is a plan. 
Americans need to know that there is 
a plan to be able to inject fiscal respon-
sibility again into what they have not 
seen for too long. 
Like everywhere in the Nation, Utah 
families are burdened with painfully 
inflated prices at the gas pump, gro-
cery store, and more. The average 
American household is paying hun-
dreds more than they would for the 
same goods that they purchased just a 
year ago. 
Despite repeated Republican warn-
ings of excessive Federal spending and 
what it would do to our economy, 
Democrats have continued to vote for 
massive spending bills. As a father to 
four young boys, I know we must pro-
vide for the next generation a more 
stable economic outlook for their fi-
nancial success. It is why I ran for Con-
gress. 
However, achieving a balanced budg-
et after over 20 years of consistent def-
icit spending is a very tall task. And 
when I decided to run for Congress and 
I made this a key part of my platform, 
I knew it was going to be a very tall 
task. 
On top of increasing Medicare and 
Social Security spending, the Congres-
sional Budget Office estimates that 
over the next 10 years interest costs 
will total $8.1 trillion. The longer we 
don’t address this issue, the larger the 
hill we must climb. Even so, leaders 
from both parties have historically 
come to the table to build solutions, 
and we must rise to the occasion. 
The Republican Study Committee 
has worked dutifully to chart our path 
forward. This plan is outlined in the 
Blueprint to Save America. This road-
map provides a fiscally sound path to 
balancing our budget in 7 years, pro-
tecting our border, bolstering our Na-
tion’s defense, expanding workforce op-
portunities, making the successful Tax 
Cuts and Jobs Act permanent, and so 
much more. 
This budget is—in the words of Con-
gressman HERN—for all Americans. All 
Americans—not just Republicans—need 
a balanced budget. This issue matters 
to Utahns, which is why I convened a 
debt and deficit task force in my own 
district to get their input and have 
spent countless hours as I have worked 
with my colleagues to know what ex-
actly we can do going forward. 
We must be committed to reversing 
our economic policies that are hurting 
Americans and get us on the right 
track. 
Mr. HERN. Mr. Speaker, I thank my 
colleague. 
Mr. Speaker, as we look at inflation, 
and we heard one of my colleagues talk 
about it earlier, it says it is 8.6 percent 
inflation caused by excessive spending. 
We have heard this from many of the 
past treasurers under the Obama ad-
ministration. We have heard the cur-
rent Secretary of the Treasury admit 
that she got it wrong last year, that 
excessive spending drove the inflation 
that we are seeing today. 
The problem is that most Americans 
don’t believe the 8.6 percent. I mean 
when you look at gas prices up over 100 
percent since Biden took office. If you 
look at hot dogs—something as simple 
as an all-American hot dog—up 64 per-
cent; milk up 32 percent. And the num-
bers go on and on and on. 
The American people are struggling. 
We can do better. We must do better. 
We must produce a balanced budget, 
get it on the floor to have it voted on. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman 
from Kentucky (Mr. BARR), my dear 
friend, a member of the Committee on 
Financial Services, a very innovative 
member. 
Mr. BARR. Mr. Speaker, I thank my 
good friend, KEVIN
HERN, from the 
great State of Oklahoma not only for 
his leadership on the Republican Study 
Committee Budget and Spending Task 
Force—ably chairing that committee— 
but also as an advocate for more do-
mestic energy production to deal with 
this energy crisis. 
Like your constituents in Oklahoma, 
my constituents in rural Kentucky are 
feeling the pain. I was just with some 
farmers in Fleming County, Kentucky, 
on Friday when we were back in the 
district. And one of the farmers stood 
up, and he said: I don’t know where you 
get your numbers in Washington, Con-
gressman, but 8.6 percent doesn’t sound 
right for us in Fleming County. 
It is more than twice that. It is pain-
ful to fill up the diesel in our tractor. 
It is impossible for us to fill up our 
trucks to get around to move our 
produce. This is not 8.6 percent. You all 
don’t know what the real number is 
and how it affects real Americans. 
That is how bad this inflation crisis 
is. But I rise in strong support of this 
Republican Study Committee’s pro-
posed Federal budget. Our Nation is 
over $30 trillion in debt. This debt cri-
sis threatens the long-term prosperity 
of every American. It is that debt, and 
it is that overspending, Mr. Speaker, 
that has helped to usher in this his-
toric inflation crisis that is crushing 
my constituents in Fleming County 
and so many other middle-class Ameri-
cans across this country. 
The RSC budget restores fiscal re-
sponsibility to Washington by bal-
ancing the Federal budget within 10 
years and rescuing America from bank-
ruptcy, stopping the spending binge in 
this town. 
Let’s be clear, we will never balance 
the Federal budget if Democrats con-
tinue their spending spree. We will 
never balance the budget continuing 
this reckless deficit-producing fiscal 
policy and threatening tax hikes in 
this ‘‘build back better’’ calamity that 
fails to raise revenue, but instead 
would crush economic growth and ac-
tually diminish the tax base. 
We will also never balance the budget 
if the Biden administration continues 
its inexplicable war on American en-
ergy, which is key to economic growth, 
key to reducing the deficit. That is 
why I commend RSC Budget and 
Spending Task Force chairman, KEVIN 
HERN, for including my legislation in 
the budget, the Fair Access to Banking 
Act. 
This legislation, the Fair Access to 
Banking Act, protects key American 
industries, such as energy producers, 
from discrimination by banks and lend-
ers who politicize access to capital to 
satisfy the radical agenda of climate 
extremists. 
And here is the irony: We all care 
about 
the 
environment, 
especially 
farmers. We care about the environ-
ment. They are the ultimate environ-
mentalists. But what sense does it 
make to deprive financing to the very 
energy companies that can innovate 
our way to solutions to the climate 
issue. 
When President Biden was sworn into 
office, gas prices averaged $2.36 across 
the country. This month, gas prices 
reached $5 nationally for the first 
time—and they are on their way to $6 
a gallon. 
In less than 2 years, our Nation went 
from energy dominant to energy des-
perate. And yet, the Biden administra-
tion continues to push ESG invest-
ments and regulations such as the 
SEC’s new climate risk disclosure rule 
designed to choke off investment in en-
ergy production. 
The Biden administration for sure is 
blocking construction of the Keystone 
XL pipeline, another energy infrastruc-
ture. It is halting new lease sales for 
oil and gas. It is stonewalling over 4,400 
permits to drill. It is thwarting new 
large-scale refineries. And this has all 
contributed 
to 
constraining 
energy 
supply, contributing to inflation. 
But ground zero in this war against 
domestic energy production is the 
Biden administration’s weaponization

of financial regulation to redirect cap-
ital away from fossil energy. The Euro-
pean financial sector, Wall Street 
banks, large, woke asset managers 
have all started the trend of politi-
cizing capital allocation through the 
environmental, social, and governance 
movement. But the Biden administra-
tion’s Security and Exchange Commis-
sion is now making matters worse by 
proposing a regulation that would force 
every 
public 
company 
to 
disclose 
reams of immaterial and unreliable in-
formation about the Green House gas 
emissions arising from their oper-
ations, the producers of energy they 
consume, and even the activities of 
their suppliers and customers. 
This 534-page monstrosity marks the 
transformation of the SEC from an 
independent agency dedicated to inves-
tor protection to an unaccountable and 
politicized bureaucracy intent on ad-
vancing radical environmental policy 
over which it has neither jurisdiction 
nor competency. 
Not only does this regulation dis-
criminate against affordable, reliable 
energy by redirecting capital away 
from the American energy sector, it di-
rectly conflicts with the SEC’s mission 
to protect investors. While asset man-
agers continually prioritize ESG funds, 
the fees for those funds are actually, on 
average, 
43 
percent 
higher 
than 
nonESG funds. 
Stocks and many ESG-related ex-
change-traded 
funds 
have 
elevated 
price-to-earnings multiples precisely 
because investment returns are sac-
rificed for nonpecuniary factors and 
policy objectives like social justice, di-
versity quotas, and lower carbon emis-
sions. 
It is time for us to stand up for 
American energy dominance. It is time 
for us to stand up for the American en-
ergy sector. It is time for us to stand 
up to retail investors who depend on 
returns instead of some woke political 
agenda that, frankly, they don’t care 
about. 
My farmers in Fleming County de-
pend on returns. They depend on af-
fordable electricity. Washington is out 
of touch with the reality and the hard-
ships of American savers and American 
workers who can’t afford Biden’s infla-
tion. That is why we need this budget. 
Now more than ever we must defend 
and encourage investments in Amer-
ican energy production to lower costs 
for Americans at the pump. 
Mr. Speaker, the duel visions for the 
future of America on this issue could 
not be clearer. On the one hand, Con-
gressional 
Democrats 
are 
doubling 
down on a dangerous agenda in the 
middle of a generational energy crisis 
at cost to millions of middle-class 
Americans. Out of touch. 
On the other hand, Republicans are 
renewing our commitment through the 
Fair Access to Banking provision con-
tained in this budget to require lending 
to be based on risk-based metrics, not 
on the woke politics of the day. 
Mr. Speaker, I am proud to stand 
with my Republican colleagues in sup-
port of this budget. I am proud to stand 
with Americans who depend on energy 
independence and energy dominance 
and affordable, reliable energy. 
I ask all of my colleagues on both 
sides of the aisle to stand with the 
American people, not with woke Wall 
Street, not with large asset managers 
who put politics ahead of returns. Vote 
for the Republican Study Committee 
budget. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank the leadership 
of my friend from Oklahoma. 
b 2000 
Mr. HERN. Mr. Speaker, I thank the 
gentleman for his very poignant words 
on where America is right now and our 
ability to, once again, return to energy 
dominance if we just get out of the 
way. 
We were there some 16 months ago, 18 
months ago, and we saw energy prices 
at the pump at $2.39. All of America 
needs to hear that: $2.39 until policies 
of the Biden administration came on 
the scene. Now, we are over $5 across 
America, with $6 on the near horizon. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentle-
woman from New York (Ms. TENNEY). 
Ms. TENNEY. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
Mr. HERN of Oklahoma and the Repub-
lican Study Committee’s Budget Task 
Force for their diligent work in putting 
together this year’s Republican Study 
Committee budget. Thank God we have 
a budget. This important document 
lays out a road map to restore fiscal 
sanity in America. 
We are in a dire fiscal state. We here 
in Congress know it, and the American 
people, more importantly, know it as 
well. President Biden and Speaker 
PELOSI’s reckless spending has led to 
40-year high inflation, proving once 
again that we simply cannot spend our 
way to prosperity. 
Our national debt has grown by $7 
trillion since the COVID pandemic 
began. Today, it totals more than $30 
trillion. 
I have a wonderful constituent who 
puts the debt amount on his building 
every single day on a main thorough-
fare, a guy named Frank Suits, who is 
a great American. He puts it out there 
just so the people know how much we 
are spending and how this isn’t making 
us prosperous, especially in New York. 
This is larger than our gross domes-
tic product. In the face of this sobering 
reality, what does President Biden pro-
pose? Spending even more. His pro-
posed budget increases spending by 
over 66 percent over 10 years and calls 
for $73 trillion—with a t—in new spend-
ing. Under President Biden’s plan, the 
United States will reach the highest 
sustained spending limit in our Na-
tion’s history. 
This is not how we jump-start an 
economy, control runaway inflation, 
and deliver for the American people. 
The budget proposed by the Republican 
Study Committee takes a different ap-
proach. It focuses on reining in waste-
ful spending, balancing our budget for 
once, and helping those in need while 
living within our means and focusing 
on balancing the budget within 7 years. 
The Republican Study Committee 
budget also includes a bill I introduced, 
the Transparency and COVID–19 Ex-
penditures Act. This important legisla-
tion would require a full audit of and 
report on Federal spending during the 
pandemic. With countless reports of 
fraud, waste, and abuse, Americans 
have a right to know how their tax dol-
lars are being spent, how they were 
spent, and if they were spent the way 
they were intended. 
Mr. Speaker, I am honored that this 
bill is included in the Republican 
Study Committee budget, further dem-
onstrating the Republican Study Com-
mittee’s commitment to transparency, 
accountability, 
fiscal 
responsibility, 
and just plain good governance. 
Inflation in the United States con-
tinues to outpace much of the devel-
oped world. It is clear to me and to the 
American people that this isn’t Putin’s 
price hike. It is Biden’s price hike. 
Rather than doubling down on failed 
policies of the past and spending even 
more of your money, our money, it is 
time for Congress to turn around this 
ship, restore fiscal sanity to Wash-
ington, and put our Nation back on a 
path to economic prosperity. 
Mr. Speaker, I am grateful to Con-
gressman HERN for his leadership and 
especially his leadership on energy. 
What a lot of people don’t realize about 
New York State is we have among the 
richest shale reserves, the Marcellus 
and Utica Shale, that we can’t touch 
because of New York’s failed policies. 
We could bring economic prosperity. 
We could bring national security, en-
ergy security, to our Nation just from 
New York State and really just bring 
our State around. That is something 
that we are fighting in New York. 
We hope with your leadership out in 
Oklahoma and across this Nation, 
working with the Republican Study 
Committee members, which I am so 
proud to be part of this great group, 
that we finally have a budget. We are 
putting out a plan. We are telling the 
American people that we have a plan, 
and we have a plan to win. We will 
make sure that the American people 
come back and that America sees the 
greatness it once had. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. HERN for 
doing these Special Orders, for high-
lighting this plan, for taking a leading 
role. We are grateful, and we certainly 
could use a dose of prosperity in up-
state New York. 
Mr. HERN. Mr. Speaker, I thank the 
gentlewoman from New York. It is re-
freshing for all of America to hear that 
New York cares about America. We 
hear so many times that nobody cares. 
It is so refreshing to hear your conserv-
ative values about something as simple 
as a balanced budget. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman 
from California (Mr. LAMALFA),

and the Transportation and Infrastruc-
ture Committee. He is from another

State where we always assume that no-
body cares about fiscal responsibility 
in America. 
Mr. LAMALFA. Mr. Speaker, I appre-
ciate Mr. HERN’s strong effort in help-
ing 
shepherd 
our 
budget 
concept 
through the RSC to get back to fiscal 
responsibility and make sure it is on 
the front burner. 
I am also pleased to follow my good 
colleague from New York, too. You 
have California and New York, and if 
you throw in Illinois, you don’t see a 
whole lot of conversation coming out 
that you want the country to emulate 
as far as fiscal responsibility. I hope 
that is a bit of a breath of fresh air. 
We are looking at the situation we 
are in right now as a country. It is just 
unbelievable, in this last 15, 16, 18 
months, just how far it has turned up-
side down. We can’t blame it all on 
COVID. We have to look at the policies 
that have been put in place. 
Yes, we did spend a lot of money in 
Washington, D.C., on the COVID-era 
problems. Some of it is justified. Some 
of it is completely out of control. 
There are still COVID dollars sitting 
in little pots somewhere that people 
are envying and wanting to turn into 
things that are completely unrelated, 
just make it slush-fund-type stuff. 
That is not right because these are the 
American people’s dollars. This is the 
American people’s debt. 
Unfortunately, we are just adding 
debt to it. We don’t really have sus-
tained income to back up the money 
we have been borrowing from the fu-
ture on this. When you couple that 
with the inflation that we are dealing 
with now, when we are looking at in-
terest rates that are edging up in order 
to basically try, essentially, to put the 
brakes on government spending, that is 
what has driven this. 
The higher numbers for interest 
rates, for payments on American debt, 
are going to devour our ability to budg-
et on things that we actually do want 
to do and care about around here. If 
the interest rates and interest pay-
ments are so high, we can’t do the elec-
tive part of our national budgeting. 
That is going to be horrendous for the 
American people. 
Mr. HERN, when we are looking at the 
overall inflation picture with the num-
bers we are talking about earlier, 8.6 
percent, we know it is a lot higher. I 
can echo what Mr. BARR was saying a 
while ago. My farmers—I am a farmer 
myself in my real life—we are not see-
ing a mere 8 percent on fertilizer, die-
sel, parts, tires, service calls, on every-
thing. It is a much higher number than 
that. 
My family grows rice and has been 
doing it for nearly 100 years. My col-
leagues and my neighbors have been 
doing the same thing. How are we 
going to afford to be able to put food 
on the table for the American people 
that is affordable? I just don’t see that. 
With what you are dealing with in 
Oklahoma 
on 
energy—your 
energy 
helps us. 
Mr. HERN. Mr. Speaker, it is 45 per-
cent of the economy in Oklahoma. The 
Biden administration and the Demo-
crats have made—it is very well- 
known. The President has said time 
and time again, and he said it just in 
the last week, that the high gas prices 
in America, and that Americans are 
suffering, are part of the grand transi-
tion plan off of fossil fuels to electric 
vehicles and others. 
Yet, in polling, when you ask the 
young Americans today where they 
think electricity comes from, the re-
sponse is the wall, not knowing how 
electricity is actually generated in our 
generation plants around the country. 
The fact that our grid can’t even sup-
ply what they are proposing to quickly 
convert our country to, and would de-
stroy economies throughout our Na-
tion, it is really a tragedy to see what 
has happened. 
Mr. LAMALFA. Mr. Speaker, it is 
fascinating that he would say that. 
You plug it into the wall. 
I just saw a recent interview with a 
major figure with a major car manufac-
turer introducing and talking about 
their electric vehicles. They were ques-
tioned at that press conference: Where 
is the power coming from to charge 
this electric car? 
Well, from that building right over 
there. 
Okay. It is a building, but it is not a 
generation plant. 
Well, I don’t really know. 
Another person in the group an-
swered and said: Well, this is powered 
by a source that is about 90 percent 
coal-driven. 
I am not against coal. I think coal is 
great. It has powered our country for 
many decades. It is extremely impor-
tant and shouldn’t just be phased out. 
It is still at least 35 percent. 
The naivety of a major manufacturer 
not understanding that the electricity 
has to come from somewhere, and it is 
going to have to be somehow reason-
ably priced in order to make it some-
how work for this big dream they have 
of electrifying everything, it is unbe-
lievable what the people are going to 
face. 
As Mr. HERN mentioned, President 
Biden called it the incredible transi-
tion. The people I know, the regular 
folks, haven’t been asked if they want 
to transition to electric vehicles or an 
electric stove or anything else. They 
want to just stick with what they have 
because you are looking at the price of 
electric vehicles, which are $50,000, 
$60,000, $70,000. The price is bumping 
up, and they have to recall them be-
cause things aren’t working quite 
right. 
We are force-feeding something just 
because government can mandate and 
pass a law that—hey, we are just going 
to require that you do it. Well, the 
market and technology don’t always 
keep up with the whims of a dream 
that somebody would have in a bu-
reaucracy. 
Phase them in, but we are looking at 
an issue that is being force-fed in the 
Biden plan to have an incredible transi-
tion. It is incredibly painful to the 
American public. 
That is why the direction that the 
RSC budget is trying to go is to 
achieve balance finally. If we are going 
to service more and more debt at a 
higher interest rate, and we keep add-
ing the numbers, as my colleague from 
New York was talking about—if the 
Biden plan calls for $73 trillion of in-
creased spending over what we are al-
ready doing at a deficit over the next 
10 years, we have big trouble. 
Government doesn’t always do that 
well with a dollar spent. In the hands 
of the American people, they are going 
to make the best decisions for their 
families on: Do they want to upgrade 
their car? Do they need to add a room 
to their house for an expanded family? 
Are they going to redo their garage or 
redo their roof? Maybe they are even 
going to take a vacation if they can af-
ford the $7 gas in California to run an 
RV and go see Yellowstone or some-
thing. 
It is amazing how this place con-
tinues to think that the massive deficit 
spending is going to somehow benefit 
the economy. It doesn’t work that way. 
Inflation drives higher prices to the 
end-users, driven by government spend-
ing. We have to get it under control. 
Mr. Speaker, Mr. HERN’s work is real-
ly stellar on trying to put this out 
there. This should really be non-
partisan, Republicans and Democrats. 
The blueprint for this would be back in 
the mid-1990s when we achieved a bal-
anced budget, I believe it was 4 years in 
a row, with President Clinton coming 
to the table and working with Newt 
Gingrich and Senator Dole and others 
on actually passing four balanced budg-
ets in a row. 
That is credit everybody can take for 
having a strong economy at the time. I 
think it would still be a legacy of the 
Reagan and Bush years, where we put 
things back on track of having an in-
come that they benefited from in that 
context. 
Mr. HERN, what do you see as far as 
that blueprint of balancing back then 
as something we can emulate here? 
Mr. HERN. Mr. Speaker, I had the 
very great fortune of being introduced 
to politics by the late Senator Tom 
Coburn. 
When he was running for Senate in 
2004, he quickly gained the title of 
‘‘Doctor No’’ because he was always 
pushing for responsible spending. He 
wasn’t against spending; he said we 
just should pay for it. He wasn’t 
against helping people; he said we 
should just pay for it like you do at 
home, like you do in your business, 
like you do in your cities or your 
States. 
He was ridiculed by many Members 
over his time in the Senate because he 
always pushed for fiscal conservatism, 
fiscal responsibility for American tax-
payer dollars. 
In 2004, when he ran for Senate, and 
he spoke about this on the campaign

trail, the national debt was $7.3 tril-
lion. Here we are, 18 years later, and we 
are approaching $31 trillion. I would 
say he understood a little bit about 
being responsible with taxpayer dol-
lars. 
As you just alluded to, there should 
be no pride in either one of the parties 
taking this acknowledgment of having 
a balanced budget. It should be just 
what we do as Congress. 
This should be a nonconversation. We 
should produce a balanced budget, as 
we did under Newt Gingrich’s leader-
ship. As he just acknowledged this 
week, it is time for us to return to the 
era of the 4 years where we had bal-
anced budgets and a divided govern-
ment, where the House and the Senate 
were Republicans and the White House 
was the Democrat. 
President Clinton knew it was the 
right thing to do. He knew that we had 
to be more responsible for taxpayer 
dollars and joined up and created a bi-
partisan budget that lasted until the 
attack on us in 2001. We have to get 
back to that. 
Our Nation is under attack by the 
debt load that we are having. The in-
terest on our debt, much of which we 
will pay to China because that is who 
we are getting our money from, is over-
taking us. In the next 4 years, the 
spending on our mandatory interest on 
our debt will surpass what we spend on 
protecting this great Nation and the 
support of our men and women in uni-
form. 
As we look at this, I just want to 
thank my colleagues from California, 
New York, and across this great Nation 
who have worked on this issue, not just 
on this budget and spending task force, 
but on this issue. The very core of who 
they are and why they came to Con-
gress was to be responsible to the 
American taxpayers, not just to the 
ones who elected them but to all Amer-
icans, Democrat, Republican, to be fis-
cally responsible for their money, their 
hard-earned money that they make 
back home. They go to work every day 
and send tax dollars up to Congress. We 
have to do better. 
b 2015 
The American taxpayers are much 
more responsible with their dollars in 
their pockets than we are here in 
Washington, D.C. We need to return 
the American taxpayers’ dollars back 
to them. We need to be less on the 
spending side and more on acknowl-
edging that American taxpayers are 
smart. They will spend their money in 
their communities better than we will. 
That is why we need to rebalance our 
government. 
So as I hear from constituents back 
home, they are worried that no one in 
Washington cares about our spending 
anymore. They are worried that there 
is no one left—even Republicans—who 
care about balancing the budget. 
Mr. Speaker, I can tell you I do. You 
heard the Members tonight. You heard 
my friend from California talk about 
how he cares. He has cared since he got 
here, and all the members on the Re-
publican Study Committee care. 
Balancing the budget isn’t a conserv-
ative idea. This isn’t a budget just for 
one party. This budget is our blueprint 
to save all Americans—all Americans— 
not just Republicans. We are not ex-
cluding Democrats. This is all Ameri-
cans. 
When 
Congress 
spends 
less, 
the 
American people have more. That is at 
the center of what we do, what we are 
doing, and what we are here to talk 
about. 
I thank everybody, again, for coming 
and speaking tonight. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
f 
CARIBBEAN AMERICAN HERITAGE 
MONTH 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under 
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 4, 2021, the gentlewoman from 
Texas (Ms. JACKSON LEE) is recognized 
for 60 minutes as the designee of the 
majority leader. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, it 
is my privilege to rise as the anchor of 
the CBC Special Order addressing Car-
ibbean American Heritage Month and 
to welcome my colleagues to the floor 
to be able to engage in a very impor-
tant and provocative discussion. 
Let me just say that last weekend, in 
fact, yesterday, was the national holi-
day, the Juneteenth independence day. 
All over America this commemoration 
brought 
about 
knowledge, 
under-
standing, jubilation, and honor. So we 
are delighted to be on the floor today 
to, in fact, provide an opportunity to 
expand and to talk about the heritage 
of so many in this Nation. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I 
ask unanimous consent that all Mem-
bers have 5 legislative days to revise 
and extend their remarks and include 
any extraneous material on the subject 
of this Special Order. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from Texas? 
There was no objection. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. It is my privi-
lege now to, first of all, thank the Hon-
orable JOYCE BEATTY, who is the chair-
woman of the Congressional Black Cau-
cus, for her continued efforts to ensure 
that the American people know our 
message and our power, know the work 
that we are doing, know the success 
that we are having, and also give us an 
opportunity to articulate the historical 
record of African Americans and those 
who have heritages from elsewhere. 
I also take a moment to congratulate 
her for receiving the Juneteenth hon-
ors in Washington, D.C. last Thursday 
from the Juneteenth Foundation. It 
was a privilege not only to be with her 
and to acknowledge many others who 
received those honors but to be there 
on such a special night. She was well- 
deserving. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentle-
woman from Ohio (Mrs. BEATTY), who 
is the chair of the Congressional Black 
Caucus. 
Mrs. BEATTY. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentlewoman for yielding. 
Mr. Speaker, as we commemorate 
June as Caribbean American Heritage 
Month, I am proud to stand with our 
Special 
Order 
champion, 
Congress-
woman SHEILA JACKSON LEE, who her-
self is a woman of Caribbean heritage. 
She is from the great State of Texas, 
and her parents were immigrants from 
Jamaica. So I thank Congresswoman 
JACKSON
LEE
again for leading our 
power, our message, and also I thank 
her for acknowledging the great honor 
I received last week. 
But, Mr. Speaker, the Congress-
woman did not tell you that she too 
was on that same program as we com-
memorated and celebrated Juneteenth. 
She had the distinct honor to present 
an award to an icon, Maxwell, who is so 
great he only needs one name. To see 
her walk across that stage along with 
another one of our colleagues, Con-
gresswoman FREDERICA WILSON, made 
me proud to share the stage with her, 
our other colleagues, and so many 
icons who have fought for justice. That 
ties into what we are talking about 
today. You will hear many of our mem-
bers come and talk about the beauty of 
diversity, culture, and their heritage. 
I also want to take a moment to cele-
brate the dedication and all of the 
work of Congresswoman BARBARA LEE 
who led the effort to designate the 
month of June as Caribbean American 
Heritage Month. You will hear from 
her today, Mr. Speaker. 
Congresswoman BARBARA LEE is al-
ways out in the forefront when we are 
talking about fighting for justice or 
when we are talking about making sure 
that we educate our constituency, and, 
yes, America, on any topic, but tonight 
this is a topic she knows all so well. 
You see, Mr. Speaker, when I think 
about Congresswoman Shirley Chis-
holm in Congress and Members like 
vice-chair of the Congressional Black 
Caucus STEVEN
HORSFORD, Congress-
woman YVETTE CLARKE, Congressman 
ANTHONY
BROWN, 
Delegate 
STACEY 
PLASKETT, 
Congressman 
G. 
K. 
BUTTERFIELD, Congresswoman SHEILA 
CHERFILUS-MCCORMICK, and so many 
others, it is a rollcall of our Members 
of Caribbean heritage. 
So when we think of this great leg-
acy that we are leaving, Caribbean her-
itage is one of the most resilient and 
excellent, and it is full of the tenacity 
of the people who come to this Con-
gress to be the voice for the people 
whom they know need us most. 
The Congressional Black Caucus has 
been a longtime fighter for the protec-
tion of immigrants of color and for the 
rights of people of Caribbean descent, 
such as the Haitian Family Reunifica-
tion Parole, or better known as HFRP 
program, which allows eligible United 
States citizens and lawful permanent 
residents to apply for parole for their 
family members in Haiti.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5727 
June 21, 2022 
Just think about this, Mr. Speaker, 
think about this: Some 50 years ago, 
one woman and 12 men, the founders of 
the Congressional Black Caucus, one 
woman 
making 
history, 
the 
same 
woman who ran for President of these 
United States, Shirley Chisholm. So 
from Shirley Chisholm to—think about 
it—today in modern times Delegate 
STACEY
PLASKETT
to chairwoman of 
the CBC’s Task Force on Immigration, 
and the only Black woman in the New 
York congressional delegation, Con-
gresswoman YVETTE CLARKE, the con-
tributions of Caribbean-American her-
itage to this democracy is alive and 
well, Mr. Speaker. 
I would like to also take a moment 
to commemorate the decades of work 
that a Dr. Claire Nelson has displayed 
on behalf of the Caribbean diaspora. 
Dr. Nelson is the founder and president 
of the Institute of Caribbean Studies, 
ICS, the Nation’s leading Caribbean- 
American advocacy group and a good 
friend to the Congressional Black Cau-
cus and our dear friend, Congress-
woman BARBARA LEE. She fearlessly 
led the advocacy efforts that accom-
pany Congresswoman BARBARA
LEE’s 
legislation that was signed into law 
that we are celebrating tonight. I 
thank Congresswoman BARBARA LEE. I 
remember when she came to us in the 
Congressional Black Caucus meeting 
and said: We want to make this hap-
pen. 
So tonight we made it happen. 
I thank the gentlewoman, and I 
thank all of our other Members for 
being here tonight. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank Chairwoman BEATTY for laying 
the framework of how enriched the 
Congressional Black Caucus is with the 
vast diversity of Members who have 
these enormous connections and herit-
age and to honor the leader of this leg-
islation making June Caribbean Amer-
ican Heritage Month and to be astute 
enough to continue her work as the 
chair of the State, Foreign Operations, 
and Related Programs Subcommittee 
on Appropriations. She has been a life-
line to the Caribbean and astute on 
many issues from immigration to dis-
asters to the issues of dealing with de-
mocracy and humanity. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentle-
woman for her leadership. Might I add 
that she also has a strong heritage in 
Texas and was a very powerful contrib-
utor to our celebration of Juneteenth 
in Texas. Along with her relatives she 
was at the Ashton Villa site where 
General Granger came to announce the 
freedom of the slaves. She did that dur-
ing Juneteenth in Texas. We were glad 
to have her. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentle-
woman from California (Ms. LEE). 
Ms. LEE of California. Mr. Speaker, 
first of all, I thank Congresswoman 
SHEILA
JACKSON
LEE
for that very 
warm and gracious introduction. But 
also let me just thank the gentle-
woman for her steadiness, her persist-
ence, and her perseverance and for 
bringing the truth about so many 
issues about Black people in the dias-
pora in our own country to the fore-
front and providing a moment and, yes, 
being in Galveston for the first time 
where my grandfather W.C. Parish was 
born. 
My 
great-grandmother 
was 
enslaved in Galveston, and I had never 
been to Galveston except for this week-
end. So I thank Congresswoman SHEILA 
JACKSON LEE for her hospitality. 
I also thank her—and I must mention 
this—that after my friend championed 
the legislation for a national holiday, 
all of the polls, all of the surveys, and 
all of the news reports indicate that 
twice as many people in our country 
know about the African-American cul-
ture, history, and what took place be-
fore 1865. So that is in large part due to 
the tireless effort of Congresswoman 
SHEILA JACKSON LEE. She said over the 
weekend that Juneteenth provides for 
a moment of unity and for a moment of 
healing. 
As we move forward now, and the 
gentlewoman knows I have got to men-
tion H.R. 40 because that is next in 
terms of understanding and developing 
the commission to study and develop 
reparations. But I think this weekend 
really put us on another path, a more 
aggressive path now to get that done. 
So I thank the gentlewoman very 
much. 
Also, let me thank our chair, Chair-
woman JOYCE BEATTY, for her kind re-
marks, but also for really making sure 
that our message and our power is 
brought to the forefront in the United 
States as it relates to the Congres-
sional Black Caucus. I know of no one 
who really understands the historical 
context of African Americans and 
Black people in the diaspora than Con-
gresswoman 
Chairwoman 
JOYCE 
BEATTY. 
When I think about Chairwoman 
BEATTY, I always think about this bird, 
and I mentioned it to her, the sankofa 
bird in the language of Ghana, the Gha-
nian people. It is a beautiful bird with 
an egg in her mouth looking backwards 
and beginning her move forward. Con-
gresswoman BEATTY always works to 
give reverence and give credit to those 
who came before us and remind us of 
our history looking back, knowing how 
we got here, but also reminding us all 
that we must move forward until this 
country provides liberty and justice for 
all. 
So I just have to thank Chairwoman 
BEATTY for always through her leader-
ship making sure that the whole coun-
try understands the sankofa moment 
for us as African Americans in our 
country. 
Also, all of our Caribbean Members, I 
see Congresswoman YVETTE
CLARKE 
come in. Her ancestors are from Ja-
maica, her mother and father. She has 
contributed to this Congress, to her 
constituents, to the country and to the 
Caribbean. She is an example of how 
Caribbean Americans bring forth their 
wisdom, their passion, and their bril-
liance, never forgetting their heritage. 
We have to thank them also for their 
tremendous leadership here in this 
body because they have truly made a 
major 
contribution 
to 
the 
United 
States House of Representatives. 
b 2030 
Yes, almost three decades ago, I real-
ly fought hard, and we did do this in a 
bipartisan way, passing legislation to 
designate June as Caribbean American 
Heritage Month. 
President Bush actually signed this 
into law in 2006. Since then, June has 
given us the opportunity to celebrate 
the tremendous impact that the people 
of the Caribbean have made on the 
United States. 
Let me also acknowledge Dr. Claire 
Nelson, who is a great Caribbean-Amer-
ican leader, for inspiring this effort. 
Since the founding of this country, 
Caribbean Americans have contributed 
to every aspect of our society, includ-
ing greatly to the fine arts, education, 
business, literature, journalism, sports, 
fashion, politics, government, military 
service, music, science, medicine, engi-
neering, technology, and many other 
fields. 
We enjoy the richness of Caribbean- 
American culture through the fes-
tivals, carnivals, music, dance, film, 
food, and literature, which can be 
found across the United States. 
Most importantly, a number of Carib-
bean Americans have been leaders in 
the civil and human rights movement 
and other social and political move-
ments in the United States. 
It is not surprising that people from 
the Caribbean are so connected to our 
country, those who now live in the Car-
ibbean, who are Caribbean residents. 
The countries of the Caribbean rep-
resent the United States’ third border. 
These countries are important eco-
nomic and cultural partners of the 
United States. We share parallel his-
tories informed by struggles against 
slavery and colonialism and for inde-
pendence, democracy, and shared pros-
perity. 
We all share the same hopes and aspi-
rations 
for 
peace 
and 
prosperity 
throughout the Western Hemisphere 
and the rest of the world. 
In fact, for these reasons and many 
more, the Congressional Black Caucus 
and I have been pushing hard for the 
United States to engage more deeply 
with our Caribbean neighbors. 
We were, a couple of weeks ago, re-
cently, at the Summit of the Americas 
in Los Angeles. Several members and 
our 
chairwoman—Congresswoman 
JOYCE BEATTY, Congresswoman SHEILA 
JACKSON LEE, Congresswoman STACEY 
PLASKETT, and others—were in Los An-
geles participating at the summit, 
making sure that the word went out 
that we are here to do more engage-
ment and work and bring more parity 
and more focus on the Caribbean. 
As 
chair 
of 
the 
Appropriations’ 
State, Foreign Operations, and Related 
Programs Subcommittee, I have been

working with the CBC and the Carib-
bean Caucus, led by, of course, Con-
gresswoman YVETTE
CLARKE, to in-
crease our dialogue and investment in 
the people and countries of the Carib-
bean. 
As the House takes up the FY23 
SFOPS bill, I say to Congresswoman 
JACKSON LEE that we are working to 
include further measures to deepen the 
United States-Caribbean relationship. 
Many influential Caribbean Ameri-
cans are playing key roles in shaping 
the history and future of the United 
States. Of course, they include the late 
beloved Colin Powell, the first African- 
American Secretary of State; Eric 
Holder, our first African-American At-
torney General; Karine Jean-Pierre, 
the 
first 
African-American 
White 
House 
press 
secretary; 
Patrick 
Gaspard, labor union organizer and so-
cial justice advocate; Dr. Garth Gra-
ham, 
public 
health 
leader 
and 
healthcare expert; Sherrilyn Ifill, so-
cial justice advocate; the great Patrick 
Ewing, star of the NBA’s New York 
Knicks; Harry Belafonte, musician, 
actor, and activist, and a very good 
friend to myself and this caucus; Ro-
berto Clemente, the first Latino intro-
duced into the Baseball Hall of Fame; 
and let us not forget Vice President 
KAMALA
HARRIS, the first African- 
American Vice President and the high-
est ranking Caribbean American even 
in the United States Government. 
Finally, I cannot neglect to mention 
my friend and mentor, Congresswoman 
Shirley Chisholm, as JOYCE BEATTY, 
our chair, mentioned, who was the first 
African-American woman elected to 
Congress and also to run for President, 
and the first African American to run 
for President. 
Born in Brooklyn, of Guyanese and 
Bajan descent, she spent part of her 
childhood in Barbados and always con-
sidered herself a Bajan American. I had 
the privilege to go see her schoolhouse 
very recently in Barbados, and it was 
quite moving to see where she was 
raised by her grandmother to be the 
great woman she became. 
With her brilliance and tenacity, she 
broke through multiple barriers for 
Black Americans and for women, and I 
am here today, in part, because of her 
example. I am proud to celebrate her 
legacy on this 50th anniversary of her 
groundbreaking 
campaign 
for 
the 
President of the United States. 
Again this year, I have introduced a 
resolution, H. Res. 1161, honoring these 
great Americans and the history Carib-
bean Americans have contributed to 
our country. I am honored that several 
of my colleagues here have joined as 
cosponsors in celebrating this rich his-
tory. 
Let us use this month of June to pay 
appropriate tribute to the breadth and 
depth of Caribbean-American contribu-
tions to the United States. But let us 
also recommit ourselves to a closer and 
stronger engagement with countries in 
the Caribbean. They are our allies. 
They are our friends, and they deserve 
more support and more engagement 
through trade, investment, develop-
ment assistance, you name it. There is 
a lot to do to catch up in the Carib-
bean. 
I thank our Vice President and Presi-
dent Biden, and I thank the Congres-
sional Black Caucus, our Speaker, and 
many Members here who have been so 
supportive over the years in increasing 
this engagement. We see a lot of 
progress, but we have a long way to go. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank Congresswoman 
SHEILA JACKSON LEE for her leadership 
on so many fronts and for helping us 
educate the public about the unfinished 
business of America. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the chairwoman for capturing so 
well the unfinished business as it re-
lates to the Caribbean and overall, and 
I thank her for being the leader of the 
resolution 
to 
establish 
Caribbean 
American Heritage Month that we now 
are able to commemorate year after 
year. 
It is appropriate that the gentle-
woman is the chair of the State, For-
eign Operations, and Related Programs 
Subcommittee because she can have a 
very large voice on the changing of our 
treatment of the Caribbean, along with 
the leadership of our chair of the CBC 
and CBC members. I thank the gentle-
woman so much for that. 
Mr. Speaker, it is my privilege, of 
course, to now yield to the gentle-
woman who hails from Brooklyn that 
has such a sizable representation of 
Caribbean Americans. She is a senior 
member and vice chair of the Energy 
and Commerce Committee and the 
founder of and collaborator with the 
Caribbean-American Caucus here in the 
United States Congress, and she has 
worked on a number of immigration 
issues that really impact our brothers 
and sisters in the Caribbean. 
I must say that, just a few years ago, 
I think we were shuttling during the 
Christmas holiday—it seems like it was 
near the Christmas holiday—from the 
Hill to the World Bank, trying to work 
on redoing the treatment that they 
were giving to Jamaica. I thank the 
gentlewoman for that leadership. I was 
pleased to join her in that effort, and 
we were successful. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentle-
woman from New York (Ms. CLARKE), 
and I better say Brooklyn, New York. 
Ms. CLARKE of New York. Mr. 
Speaker, let me thank the gentle-
woman from Houston, Texas, Congress-
woman SHEILA JACKSON LEE, for an-
choring us this evening as we com-
memorate Caribbean American Herit-
age Month. 
Let 
me 
acknowledge 
our 
chair-
woman, JOYCE BEATTY, and, of course, 
Congresswoman BARBARA
LEE, who 
speaks for me. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today as a proud 
Caribbean American and on behalf of 
my fellow Americans of Caribbean de-
scent in celebration and recognition of 
the National Caribbean American Her-
itage Month. 
Let me take this opportunity to 
thank Congresswoman BARBARA
LEE 
for her vision in establishing this des-
ignation of Caribbean American Herit-
age Month in June 2006. 
I rise today to honor the tremendous 
contributions 
Caribbean 
Americans 
have made and continue to make in the 
building of our great Nation. 
Mr. Speaker, our contributions are 
not just reflected in the tapestry of 
American culture. They are brightly 
reflected in the heritage of this Na-
tion’s first woman Vice President, 
KAMALA HARRIS. It is reflected in the 
first African-American woman to serve 
in Congress, my predecessor, the Hon-
orable Shirley Chisholm. 
Mr. Speaker, the list of noble Carib-
bean Americans is too long to list, and 
so I rise today as a proud Caribbean- 
American representative of our sheer 
glory and significance in American his-
tory. 
I rise today to remind the world of 
the continued excellence demonstrated 
by Caribbean Americans in every sec-
tor of our civil society. From govern-
ment to the private sector, to enter-
tainment and sports, Caribbean Ameri-
cans continue to exemplify a unique 
distinction of creativity, innovation, 
and excellence that engenders a deep 
sense of pride in our accomplishments. 
Let me be clear: We essentially rep-
resent our homes of origin as de facto 
goodwill ambassadors while, simulta-
neously, we represent some of the best 
talent that the United States has to 
offer. 
Having a month to highlight our tre-
mendous contributions gives us a spe-
cial perspective on the collective ben-
efit of such a diverse people of African 
descent, Latin, Asian, and the Euro-
pean diaspora. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to give hon-
orable mention to one of the Founding 
Fathers of our Nation, Alexander Ham-
ilton, born in the Caribbean nation of 
Saint Kitts and Nevis. 
I rise today to sanctify the Honorable 
Marcus Mosiah Garvey, a proud Carib-
bean man from the island nation of Ja-
maica who formed one of the largest 
Pan-Africanist movements in our Na-
tion’s history. I rise today to call for 
justice, his exoneration, and his right-
ful place in our American history. 
I rise today on behalf of our ances-
tors of Caribbean descent, in recogni-
tion and in celebration of National Car-
ibbean American Heritage Month. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise to mark this mo-
ment on June 22, 2022, to honor and re-
flect on the lives and contributions of 
all those who planted the seeds of free-
dom and prosperity, knowing that they 
would never live long enough to feel 
the liberating power of the freedom 
they fostered. Their fight, now our 
fight for justice, fairness, equality, and 
equity, is certainly not over, but 
thanks to their legacies, the perpetual 
contributions of Caribbean Americans 
manifested through us in this genera-
tion, we are on our way to fulfilling the 
American dreams of our ancestors.

June 21, 2022 
Mr. Speaker, as we mark the 16th an-
niversary of the National Caribbean 
American Heritage Month, it is with a 
profound sense of gratitude that we 
will finally have this opportunity to 
celebrate our history, heritage, and 
unique place on our American journey 
and in our American journey. 
During the month of June, we are 
blessed to celebrate the freedom of 
Juneteenth and commemorate the lives 
sacrificed through the indignities of 
human bondage. But we reclaim the 
human dignity afforded to the waves of 
Caribbean immigrants who have been a 
beneficiary and significant part of the 
battle from the very foundation of our 
Nation’s existence. 
We use the month of June to educate 
and acknowledge our rightful place in 
American history. 
b 2045 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. I thank the gen-
tlewoman from Brooklyn, New York. 
What a powerful display of the richness 
of the Caribbean, the family connec-
tions, her pride for this wonderful op-
portunity to speak about the people in 
the Caribbean. I am very grateful to 
you for relating both your familial con-
nections but your predecessor. 
So we all have stakeholders in Shir-
ley Chisholm. I guess my pride is as a 
very young person having introduced 
her at a church program and then as a 
lawyer at a lawyer’s program, those 
moments were very special; working in 
her district for, you might remember 
her, Carol Bellamy, and getting to 
know and be around her during that 
time. 
I am delighted to make mention at 
this point of Representative JAMAAL 
BOWMAN, who will be presenting his 
statement into the RECORD, a very 
strong, new Member who has exhibited 
such leadership. He will be one of those 
that will submit statements into the 
RECORD
along 
with 
Representative 
SHEILA CHERFILUS-MCCORMICK. She will 
likewise present her statement into the 
RECORD. 
I will proceed now to make my con-
cluding remarks as I celebrate Carib-
bean 
American 
Heritage 
Month. 
I 
thank Congresswoman BARBARA
LEE 
for H. Con. Res. 71. I think it was intro-
duced at that time in 2006, and she has 
done that every single year. She has 
made the Congressional Black Caucus 
better for being worldly enough to ac-
knowledge the connection. 
I will build on what you have said, 
Congresswoman LEE. As a member of 
the Homeland Security Committee, we 
considered the Caribbean, just a few 
years back, after 9/11 as the third bor-
der of the United States, and it had 
key importance for the role it played 
in the security of the United States. 
We have not continued that. And I 
believe as we look to reenhancing our 
communications 
and 
collaboration 
with the Caribbean, it is to recognize 
the important role that they are in se-
curing America and securing the Carib-
bean and the work that they have done 
with our military, but also our drug 
enforcement, in a way that protects 
them and protects the United States. 
Millions have emigrated from the 
Caribbean to the United States since 
our Nation’s founding. Congress should 
continue to recognize the important 
contributions of Caribbean Americans 
to our Nation’s history and their role 
in our Nation’s future. Those were the 
words from that legislation and from 
BARBARA LEE as this bill was intro-
duced. 
Today, we celebrate the vibrancy and 
diversity of the Caribbean-American 
communities as well as the strong ties 
reinforced between the United States 
and our Caribbean neighbors. 
We certainly recognize Cuba and 
know that there are immigration poli-
cies that apply to Cuba. 
I think at this point, I want to make 
that sure that all of us in the Congres-
sional Black Caucus continue to work 
on the issues dealing with Haiti, in par-
ticular: The natural disasters, the 
issues of democracy, the fact that they 
are a strong and resilient people, that 
they have many, many needs, but we 
also want fairness. 
As the former ranking member on 
the Subcommittee on Immigration, 
Citizenship, and Border Safety, work-
ing with the Caribbean Caucus, we are 
looking forward to the administration 
working on humanitarian parole on 
some of the persons here of Haitian de-
cent, so there is a balance and a fair-
ness of their immigration status with 
others. 
These are things that we, in the Con-
gressional Black Caucus, are looking to 
work on as we cite the very strong ties 
that we have. 
Shirley 
Chisholm 
certainly 
rep-
resents sort of an iconic figure. Most 
persons see her from Brooklyn. I re-
member her saying as she was ap-
pointed to the Committee on Agri-
culture, a tree does grow in Brooklyn. 
She was not going to let herself be 
denied the status of importance, Mr. 
Speaker, when this urban member was 
appointed to the Committee on Agri-
culture as a point of, you better sit 
here. She made much out of that and 
was a great leader on food stamps and 
other issues dealing with the urban 
community. 
We might not know that W.E.B. Du 
Bois, a prominent African American, 
the first to earn a Ph.D. from Harvard. 
And, of course, Vice President KAMALA 
HARRIS, the First African American of 
Jamaican heritage to serve as Vice 
President of the United States. Su-
preme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor, 
a Latina of Puerto Rican heritage and 
the first to serve in the United States 
Supreme Court. 
We have noted Alexander Hamilton, 
the first Secretary of the Treasury. 
James Weldon Johnson, the writer of 
Lift Every Voice and Sing, and a key 
figure of the Harlem renaissance. I can 
assure you that he was very prominent. 
This song was very prominent during 
the Juneteenth celebrations. 
Gloria Estefan, one of the best-sell-
ing female artists of all time from 
Cuba with the hit songs ‘‘Conga’’ and 
‘‘Rhythm is Gonna Get You.’’ 
Then a name that we might not be 
familiar with: Bad Bunny, Spotify’s 
most streamed artist and album glob-
ally of 2020, and the first time a non- 
English language music artist topped 
the year-end list. 
The history, however, of the Carib-
bean is many. It is filled with natural 
resources, natural beauty. It is, along 
with CARICOM, a perfect partner to 
the United States. 
In addition, I too want to applaud 
President Joe Biden and Vice President 
KAMALA HARRIS at the Summit of the 
Americas. We understand, as we were 
participating as Members of Congress 
with Speaker PELOSI, that there was an 
outstanding meeting that went on with 
CARICOM to re-cement the relation-
ship between the Caribbean and the 
United States. 
That is important because, as I said, 
natural resources, natural beauty, a 
third border against terrorists and 
against other aspects of danger to the 
United States, but a partner so that 
the Caribbean is secure as well as the 
United States. A bastion of democracy. 
That is why we must continue to 
fight for Haiti as it restores itself, re-
builds itself. We met with the Haitian 
president there to try to find a path-
way for that country to restore itself. 
As indicated, we can be on the front 
line working with our Members of Con-
gress, both Democratic and Repub-
lican. 
I believe that there are a number of 
codels that have recently gone to the 
Caribbean, including one led by the 
chairwoman of the Committee on Fi-
nancial Services, MAXINE WATERS, who, 
in fact, is a member and co-chair of the 
Caribbean caucus. 
But as we study the history, let us 
realize there is much more synergism 
than one might imagine, because as we 
celebrated Juneteenth, it is important 
for America to remember that slaves 
were also in the Caribbean. 
It was a tragic experience. Over 40 
percent of all Africans who were 
enslaved were sent to the Caribbean is-
lands; estimated at 5 million enslaved 
Africans beginning as early as the 16th 
century. 
Within the Caribbean, the death 
rates of enslaved populations were ex-
tremely high. It was very hot, and 
there were a lot of insects, if I might 
say, that took a toll on many, but they 
kept on surviving. Untold numbers, 
however, 
suffered 
from 
inhumane 
working conditions. 
However, the rise of abolitionist 
movements, coupled with anti-slavery 
sentiment, and several military and po-
litical crises, sowed the seeds for prohi-
bition against slavery in the Caribbean 
countries. 
In fact, I believe Haiti was one of the 
first free countries, securing independ-
ence from France at a very, very early 
stage.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5730 
June 21, 2022 
We honor Caribbean heroes who re-
belled against slavery which led to offi-
cial emancipation in anglophone coun-
tries in 1823. Major revolts shocked the 
world: The Tacky’s Rebellion in the 
1760s in Jamaica; the Haitian Revolu-
tion; Fedon’s Revolution in the 1790s in 
Grenada; the Barbados slave revolt in 
1860; and the slave revolt in Jamaica 
led by Sam Sharpe. 
What a unique difference and experi-
ence, but yet there was slavery. Eman-
cipation was achieved because of the 
movements and the legal efforts within 
respective Caribbean countries. 
Those revolts inspired the abolition-
ists in the United States. The parallel 
histories of Caribbean countries and 
the United States are rooted in oppres-
sion and the ongoing struggle for last-
ing true liberation, justice, equality, 
and freedom. 
What is good about this discussion is 
to reflect on the fact that those 
enslaved Africans that were in the Car-
ibbean, now, their descendants are the 
heads of state of all the Caribbean 
countries 
and 
our 
leaders 
in 
the 
CARICOM. 
This is an important partnership for 
the United States, and it is one that we 
must utilize and teach our children. We 
embrace them as our ancestors who 
suffered in hopes that future genera-
tions would not; supporting their chil-
dren so that a time would come when 
freedom would reign. 
We now have the responsibility as we 
deal with the Caribbean to reflect on 
the Caribbean immigrants who have 
come here to the United States. It has 
already been noted how they have 
achieved and succeeded. 
We mentioned members of our caucus 
who are Members of the United States 
Congress who have that heritage. Since 
1820, people of the Caribbean descent 
have immigrated to the United States. 
We want to make sure that the proc-
ess is fair. We want to make sure that 
these individuals are not deported ran-
domly. 
As I said, we hope to have a response 
to the Haitians as to the Cubans, those 
who come from Cuba and have the wet 
foot, dry foot effort that are not Hai-
tians. We see them being deported from 
the Mexican-U.S. border. That is not 
fair. 
We have had a relationship with 
Haiti for centuries. Haiti fought along-
side of Americans in the Revolutionary 
War. They came to be at our side. 
Since 2000, the population increased 
26 percent to 3.7 million Caribbean- 
Americans in 2010 and grew another 18 
percent to 4.4 million in 2017. Today, 
there are 13.4 million Americans of 
that heritage; always hardworking, 
ready to serve, ready to serve in the 
United 
States 
military, 
and 
often 
found at the front line of aid here in 
this country. 
The fight reached its apex with the 
Haitian Revolution in 1804. As I indi-
cated, the fight did not end with Brit-
ain’s Slave Trade Act of 1807 that 
sought abolish the British slave trade. 
The point of my comments is to 
make sure everyone knew that they 
were always fighting for justice, they 
were fighting for equality, and their 
history is worth studying. 
I do want to draw to our attention 
the connection of H.R. 40, the commis-
sion to study slavery and develop rep-
aration proposals. Juneteenth: Healing, 
restorative, repair as well. Know the 
story. 
I can tell you, across America, I 
heard one colleague, if I might, from 
Chicago who said there were so many 
moments of celebration. 
Our majority leader indicated in his 
own home State, there was one event, 
Mr. Speaker, that had 6,000 people cele-
brating 
Juneteenth. 
It 
warms 
my 
heart. It was a decade-long fight, and 
here we are today, really in the eye- 
opening experience of Juneteenth. 
I had the privilege of speaking at the 
Ashton Villa, the place where General 
Granger came to make that announce-
ment of the No. 3 order. And to have, as 
well, the statue of Al Edwards, a State 
representative who was the first prob-
ably in the Nation to drive a State hol-
iday in the State of Texas. He achieved 
that more than 20 years ago. 
Being trained up under that kind of 
leadership, it was instilled in me that 
we should have a national holiday, a 
national Independence Day on the 
Juneteenth basis. I am so excited about 
the overwhelming support, unanimous 
in the Senate, 415 votes in the House, if 
anyone can imagine. 
So, as we talk about these issues, I 
want the world to see and the Nation 
to see that over this weekend, the 
Juneteenth events all over the Nation 
reflected people coming together from 
many different backgrounds. 
There was a degree of excitement. 
There were children there, families 
there, and our celebrations were fo-
cused around peace and unity, and they 
were focused around prayer. 
That is what we did in Houston, 
Texas, at the historic—historic—Anti-
och Baptist Church founded in 1866 by 
Jack Yates. Can you imagine, only 1 
year after the Emancipation Proclama-
tion that was issued in 1865, after 21⁄2 
years when the South did not pay any 
attention to Abe Lincoln’s order, Presi-
dent Lincoln’s order, that he had to 
dispatch this general, a West Point 
grad, a hero on the battlefield, to an-
nounce in Texas—I can remember the 
words. It seems like they are loud in 
my ears. 
To the people of Texas, I now declare 
that the slaves are free, and they are 
free to be able to achieve property, 
they are no longer property, and they 
are citizens of the United States. 
Slavery had not been abolished, but 
he indicated that the slaves were free 
and that they could maintain them-
selves as employer and employee. I 
would venture to say that even with 
that pronouncement, most of them, 
uneducated, had ever heard the words 
employer and employee. It was master 
and slave. 
The one thing they knew, they were 
not staying. They were leaving and 
going up the trail, the Emancipation 
Trail, into the areas of La Marque in 
Texas and in Houston, a place called 
Freedmen’s Town and Independence 
Heights. 
They were going under the leadership 
of Jack Yates, when they got to Hous-
ton, who bought in 1872 the first park 
ever bought in Texas. It was bought by 
freed slaves, and it was a place where 
the emancipation Juneteenth celebra-
tions would go for decades and decades 
and decades. 
That history should allow us to pass 
with ease the commission H.R. 40 that 
has been percolating now since 1989 and 
the commission to study slavery and 
develop reparation proposals. It was 
modeled after the Civil Liberties Act 
that was passed in 1988 and signed by 
Ronald Reagan. 
We championed that for the Japanese 
Americans. It was based on the intern-
ment that had happened wrongly of 
Japanese-Americans, patriots who love 
the country, who were rounded up, be-
longings left, take what you can take, 
properties left to their own devices, if 
you will, and held in an internment 
camp. 
b 2100 
To this day, the Japanese-American 
association is a strong advocate for 
H.R. 40 because of the friendship and 
collaboration and the work we did, in 
particular the late John Conyers, who 
worked with them and then introduced 
H.R. 40, the Commission to Study and 
Develop Reparation Proposals for Afri-
can Americans Act. 
I would imagine most people would 
wonder where that name came from. It 
came from General Sherman, who 
wanted to give 40 acres and a mule to 
the freed slaves. Unfortunately, this is 
what happens. Elections count, and the 
next President after the assassination 
of President Abraham Lincoln did not 
hold to that commitment. 
With that in mind, just know that we 
have built this Nation on that labor; 
built this Nation on making cotton 
king; providing resources to the en-
riched South, the landed South; cre-
ating the Wall Street banks, if you 
will; and providing an economic engine 
that propelled this small country into 
a growing international force. 
Mr. Speaker, I think that H.R. 40 is a 
perfect complement because one of the 
things it does is it gets a study just to 
look at the landscape of how slavery 
impacted this Nation and how it im-
pacted the people, how it impacted New 
England, the Midwest, California, the 
South, the Deep South, and the south-
eastern region where African Ameri-
cans began to move all across this Na-
tion. 
Interestingly enough, California, of 
course, has already implemented this 
bill, H.R. 40, and a task force is now 
working to do enormous work. I refer 
everyone to a Harvard University med-
ical study that indicated that if repara-
tions had been given preceding COVID–

19, that horrible pandemic would not 
have so lopsidedly impacted the Afri-
can-American community. 
Let me be very clear that this idea of 
reparations is a sense of looking sys-
temically at what would be the solu-
tions. The commission is to be able to 
hear from people across America and to 
be able to recommend and to engage 
with people from all backgrounds, not 
just one background, not just African 
Americans. I am excited about that 
dialogue. I think it will be a powerful 
dialogue. 
As we celebrated Juneteenth, as we 
had this memorial service at the Anti-
och Baptist Church, what an emotional 
time we had with song and words and 
dance and prayer. People left there 
saying that they were more inspired 
than they have ever been before to 
bring us together. It was a diverse au-
dience of people who came even from 
out of town to do something that was 
part of my vision that on Juneteenth, 
and that was happy Father’s Day, we 
would take a moment to honor slaves 
who were born, who lived and died as a 
slave and never knew freedom, to give 
them the honor that they never got. 
As I reflect on how this Nation was 
built by immigrants and how it was 
built by the ancestors of African Amer-
icans today, I do want to continue to 
emphasize the Members of Congress 
who have this wonderful heritage and 
to honor the late Shirley Chisholm, 
who both became the first African- 
American woman in the United States 
Congress and as well became the first 
African-American person to run for 
President. 
As I do so, let me cite my relatives, 
Sybil Gooden, Willie Gooden, they ex-
celled as leaders coming from the Car-
ibbean; the Lockets; the Rashfords; 
and, of course, my grandparents, Olive 
Clarke Jackson and Albert Jackson, 
who worked on the Panama Canal. It 
was so powerful to go to the Panama 
Canal and see his name written there. 
It was an emotional experience. Eric 
Jackson, Allen Jackson, Charles Jack-
son all served in World War II; Ezra 
Jackson, my father; and his older 
brothers who served in World War II. 
Elaine Oliver and Ollie Oliver, both of 
those individuals came and made great 
strides. Their son served in the United 
States 
Air 
Force. 
An 
outstanding 
daughter, Elaine Oliver, worked for me. 
Of course, Eric Holder, Colin Powell, 
Patrick 
Gaspard, 
Harry 
Belafonte, 
many others, our outstanding commu-
nications director. 
Tonight, we have had a storytelling 
night of truth. We have had a great 
celebration 
of 
Caribbean 
American 
Month, and we have told the history 
and story of the powerful connection 
between the Caribbean and the United 
States of America. That should be a 
moment 
of 
celebration, 
friendship, 
unity, heritage, knowledge. 
I am delighted to have anchored the 
Congressional Black Caucus Special 
Order hour on the Caribbean American 
Heritage Month, and I thank the chair-
woman and the officers of the Congres-
sional Black Caucus and all of our 
members for continuing to tell the 
truth. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
Mrs. CHERFILUS-MCCORMICK. Mr. Speak-
er, I rise to express my sincere gratitude to 
those who came before me who made it pos-
sible for us to honor Caribbean Heritage 
Month in the United States Congress. Today, 
we celebrate the 16th year anniversary. 
June is Caribbean Heritage month, where 
we celebrate the extraordinary contribution of 
people of Caribbean ancestry. According to 
the U.S. Census, almost 13.4 million Carib-
bean Americans live in the U.S. In Florida’s 
20th Congressional District, the two largest 
groups are Haitians and Jamaicans. 
These are cab drivers, doctors, lawyers, en-
gineers, teachers, and nurses, who, without, 
our economy cannot thrive. Immigrants found 
one quarter (25 percent) of new U.S. busi-
nesses. 
Despite our contributions, we see the mis-
treatment of Black and Brown migrants who 
are merely seeking refuge in the U.S. due to 
political persecution and insecurity. 
Since my arrival at the United States Con-
gress, I have called out the Administration for 
its disparate treatment of Black migrants. We 
have all seen the influx of Haitian migrants at 
the Florida shores and the U.S. Mexico bor-
der. Many of these migrants are merely seek-
ing refuge and cannot return to their native 
country due to fear of persecution and im-
mense violence. 
I wanted to see the treatment of migrants in 
detention centers, so I visited the Broward 
Transitional Center, where I spoke with mi-
grants from Central America, Haiti, and other 
parts of the world to better understand their 
journey. I was devastated. My Congressional 
colleagues and I have since written letters to 
the Administration to not use private facilities 
for any detention, including the detention of 
undocumented immigrants. 
Unfortunately, the Administration regularly 
sends pregnant women, babies, and children 
to Haiti and other parts of the region without 
the right to due process or undergo a credible 
fear interview to determine their eligibility for 
asylum. As of today, more than 300 flights 
have landed in Haiti. This Trump-Era public 
health authority cannot continue to be used as 
an excuse to turn away and repatriate mi-
grants. It is illegal and unconscionable to repa-
triate Haitians under these circumstances. 
While the Biden Administration did listen to 
our plea to rescind Title 42, there is now a 
legal battle. I pray that the upcoming court’s 
ruling will not continue to violate U.S. asylum 
law and evade U.S. treaty obligations by 
blocking and returning asylum seekers to 
places where their lives and safety are in peril. 
We have also called on the Administration 
to invite families to apply for the Haitian Fam-
ily Reunification Parole Program, which the 
Administration announced during the Summit 
of the Americas that the program would no 
longer exist only on paper. I have demanded 
that the Administration also enforces provi-
sions in the Immigration Naturalization Act 
(INA) and provide Humanitarian Parole to Hai-
tian nationals at the U.S.-Mexico border. 
Last month, I requested more than 300 mil-
lion dollars from the House Appropriations 
Committee to provide pro bono legal services 
to immigrants from the Republic of Haiti, Ja-
maica, Guatemala, Honduras, and nationals 
from other parts of Central America. 
While there’s a great need for comprehen-
sive immigration reform, and the House has 
passed the Dream and Promise Act, which 
would create a pathway to citizenship for mil-
lions of DACA and TPS recipients, the Senate 
has failed to vote on the legislation. 
In the interim, I understand the economic 
challenges impacting countries in the Carib-
bean and Latin America, which is why I co-in-
troduced the Opportunities in Americas Act. 
This legislation also represents my unwaver-
ing commitment to my constituents from the 
Caribbean and Latin America, many of whom 
frequently engage in commerce in the region 
and need policies that support their expansion 
and foster business growth. Low-interest loans 
are vital to promote innovation and competi-
tion and eliminate barriers that prevent busi-
nesses from developing. 
I remain committed to working with the Car-
ibbean community and congressional col-
leagues to create a more fair and just immi-
gration system and draft robust legislation that 
can yield economic prosperity across the Car-
ibbean and the diaspora.

holy Word, guide them with Your spir-
it, and sustain them with Your might. 
May they strive to permit justice and 
righteousness to flourish in this gen-
eration and beyond. Use them to rescue 
those who suffer because of violence 
and oppression. 
We pray in Your great Name. Amen.

MEASURE PLACED ON THE 
CALENDAR—S. 4431 
Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I under-
stand there is a bill at the desk that is 
due for a second reading. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will read the bill by title for the 
second time. 
The legislative clerk read as follows: 
A bill (S. 4431) to eliminate discrimination 
and promote women’s health and economic 
security by ensuring reasonable workplace 
accommodations for workers whose ability 
to perform the functions of a job are limited 
by pregnancy, childbirth, or a related med-
ical condition. 
Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, in order 
to place the bill on the calendar, under 
the provisions of rule XIV, I would ob-
ject to further proceedings. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion having been heard, the bill will be 
placed on the calendar. 
f 
GUN LEGISLATION 
Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I have 
another matter to speak of, and before 
I do, I wish to commend my colleague 
and neighbor from New England, the 
distinguished 
Presiding 
Officer. 
As 
President pro tempore, I am always de-
lighted to see somebody step into that 
position, but I wish to commend him 
for his tireless and, at times, what 
must be frustrating negotiations on a 
matter that is of extreme importance 
to our country. 
In my prior profession, I went to 
many murder scenes. It seemed always 
at 2 or 3 o’clock in the morning people 
died of gunshots, and I can remember 
each one of them as though it was yes-
terday. 
Since then, what we have seen has 
been far, far worse. And I commend the 
Senator and his leadership and those in 
both parties who have worked with him 
and have tried to at least take some 
steps to curtail that in this country. 
WORLD REFUGEE DAY 2022 
Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, on June 
20, yesterday, we commemorated World 
Refugee Day. It is an important re-
minder that we have to rededicate our-
selves to a cornerstone of our Nation’s 
founding: providing refuge to the per-
secuted and oppressed. 
Since the days of the earliest Euro-
pean settlers, America has provided 
safe 
harbor 
to 
waves 
of 
refugees 
throughout our history. Many Ameri-
cans today can trace their ancestry 
back to refugees who fled their home-
lands seeking freedom and security. 
Welcoming refugees is not just some-
thing America does; it is who we al-
ways have been. 
Americans have put this long tradi-
tion of welcoming refugees on full dis-
play in recent months. After the with-
drawal from Afghanistan, Americans 
across the political spectrum opened 
their hearts, homes, and wallets to Af-
ghans fleeing the Taliban’s ruthless 
rule. To date, American families have 
helped to welcome nearly 80,000 vulner-
able Afghans into the United States, 
giving 
them 
a 
fresh 
start. 
As 
a 
Vermonter, I am proud that our small 
State joined this cause and volunteered 
to welcome and resettle 100 refugees— 
100 Afghan refugees. 
Now, when Russia shocked the world 
and invaded Ukraine, Americans of all 
walks of life yet again stepped up to as-
sist Ukrainians fleeing violence and de-
struction. Already, tens of thousands 
of Americans have volunteered to serve 
as 
private 
sponsors 
for 
arriving 
Ukrainian refugees. In fact, a Gallup 
poll from April confirmed that nearly 
80 percent of Americans support reset-
tling 100,000 Ukrainian refugees in the 
United States. That happens to be a 
central goal of the Biden administra-
tion, the Uniting for Ukraine initia-
tive. 
The deep and broad support for refu-
gees among the American people has, 
for many years, been reflected in the 
Halls of Congress. I strongly supported

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S3018 
June 21, 2022 
the 1980 Refugee Act, the landmark law 
creating our modern U.S. Refugee Ad-
missions Program and asylum system. 
That 
legislation 
was 
passed 
over-
whelmingly in the House and here in 
the Senate unanimously. In the dec-
ades since, both parties have worked 
together to provide refuge to exiled Cu-
bans, displaced Haitians, dissident Chi-
nese, and many other refugee popu-
lations feeling persecution and tyr-
anny. 
Most recently, as chairman of the 
Appropriations Committee, I worked 
again with Members of both parties to 
pass multibillion-dollar aid packages 
to fund our government’s efforts to aid 
Afghan and Ukrainian refugees. 
So it should come as no surprise that 
both parties have more often than not 
worked together to support refugees 
seeking to begin anew in the United 
States. The over 3 million refugees who 
have resettled in the United States 
over the past several decades have en-
riched our country economically and 
culturally. Refugees are entrepreneurs 
and job creators. They are active and 
committed. They are members of our 
communities. They are our neighbors 
and friends. Our Nation’s history has 
been defined by refugees, from Albert 
Einstein, to Madeleine Albright. Their 
stories and the stories of the millions 
of other refugees who come to our 
shores are the American way. 
Now, the Trump administration gave 
rise to a dark turn toward nativism 
and xenophobia, a jarring retreat from 
what has made America great. The 
hateful policies of the Trump adminis-
tration, espoused first by the former 
President himself, aimed to demonize 
refugees and asylum seekers, to shut 
our doors to the persecuted and op-
pressed. These policies were shameful. 
They should be repudiated—repudiated 
forcefully by every Member of the Sen-
ate. 
Now, there is much more to be done 
to rebuild our Nation’s capacity and 
welcome and resettle refugees. I will 
continue fighting to defend and support 
refugees in my remaining months in 
the Senate, just as I have throughout 
my Senate career. 
Today, though, I am hopeful. I see 
Vermonters coming together in aid of 
native Afghan and Ukrainian refugees 
over the past several months, and I am 
confident that America’s highest ideals 
have not seen their last days. We, the 
American people, have not lost sight of 
our roots. We are still here, an imper-
fect but compassionate beacon of hope 
for the hopeless. We are still here, our 
torch held high. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

The legislative clerk proceeded to

Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the order

The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without

RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY 
LEADER 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The mi-
nority leader is recognized. 
f 
INFLATION 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, a 
little more than 2 years ago, with Re-
publican policies in place, American 
workers and families were enjoying one 
of the best economic moments in a gen-
eration. 
Unemployment was at a 50-year low. 
Inflation was very low at the same 
time. 
Our 
economy 
was 
growing 
robustly, and workers were reaping the 
benefits: Real wages were climbing. In 
fact, wages at the bottom of the in-
come distribution were growing faster 
than that at the top. In other words, on 
our watch, working-class Americans 
were getting bigger percentage raises 
than their bosses. 
Under these conditions, the Amer-
ican people were looking forward to the 
future. Satisfaction with the direction 
of our country was at a 15-year high. 
Consumer 
confidence 
was 
hovering 
near its highest level since 2000, and 
small business optimism had set an all-
time record high. 
Republican policies helped create 
that environment, from cutting red-
tape to passing the most comprehen-
sive tax cuts and tax reform in a gen-
eration. 
Now, Democrats said the 2017 tax bill 
would not strengthen the economy and 
would starve the Federal Government 
of money, but we Republicans knew 
better. And sure enough, with our tax 
bill in place, Federal revenues are at 
historic levels. The past fiscal year’s 
nominal corporate tax receipts were 
the highest they have been since 2007. 
Individual income tax receipts just hit 
an alltime record high as well, and 
they are on pace to climb even higher 
this year. Overall, Treasury Depart-
ment revenues just recorded their larg-
est 1-year surge in 44 years. 
So that is what has happened since 
the 2017 tax reform that Democrats lit-
erally 
predicted 
would 
be 
‘‘Armageddon″: tax cuts for American 
families, record-setting tax revenues, 
and the best economy for working fam-
ilies in a generation prior to the pan-
demic. Unfortunately, most of our 
Democratic colleagues have a terrible 
track record when it comes to eco-
nomic policies and predictions. The tax 
reform they called Armageddon pre-
ceded low inflation, high employment, 
and robust growth. 
And what about on their watch? 
Democrats setting policy on party 
lines decided on trillions of dollars in 
reckless spending. That has bought us 
the worst inflation in 40 years, anemic 
growth, and now, on top of all of that, 
the threat of rising unemployment and 
a possible recession. 
Just as Senate Democrats were pre-
paring to dump $2 trillion in reckless 
spending on our economy, the Senate 
Democratic leader said: 
I do not think the dangers of inflation, at 
least in the near term, are very real. 
President Biden said: 
The risk is not doing too much. The risk is 
not doing enough. 
Secretary Yellen said: 
[T]he price of doing too little is much high-
er than the price of doing something big. 
Well, they were all wrong, and Amer-
ican families are paying dearly for it. 
The Democratic leader claimed: 
The dangers of undershooting our response 
are far greater than overshooting. 
And: 
We cannot do too little. We cannot lock 
our country into a long and slow recovery. 
Well, if Democrats did not want a 
long recovery, mission accomplished. A 
long and steady recovery with stable 
prices, rising real wages, falling unem-
ployment, and strong growth would 
have been exactly what the doctor or-
dered, but the Democrats’ policies 
helped take that option entirely off the 
table for our country. 
Instead, their decisions have fueled 
skyrocketing prices, a decline in Amer-
icans’ real incomes, and cornered the 
Federal Reserve into having to raise 
rates sharply and potentially stop or 
reverse the recovery altogether. 
So, faced with this mess, what is our 
all-Democratic government planning 
next? Are our colleagues admitting 
their mistakes and trimming back 
their appetites? 
Unfortunately, not—just the oppo-
site. 
Even now, with the evidence of a his-
toric, self-inflicted policy disaster pil-
ing up all around them, Democrats are 
reviving talks for yet another party- 
line 
taxing-and-spending 
spree 
this 
summer. Even with the economy tee-
tering on the brink of a recession, even 
with families’ real incomes already 
falling rapidly on their watch, Senate 
Democrats are reportedly behind closed 
doors, dreaming up—listen to this—his-
toric new tax hikes to drop on top of 
our economy at the very worst possible 
time. 
The same Democrats who wanted to 
pass trillions more in spending last 
year now want to rush through huge 
new tax hikes. The same party that 
spent 2021 trying to inflate their way 
out of inflation now wants to spend 
2022 tax-hiking their way right into a 
recession. You could not invent—could 
not invent—a worse time for Wash-
ington Democrats to pile on new tax 
hikes on our country. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

anniversary of title IX of the Edu-
cation Amendments of 1972. It says: 
No person in the United States shall, on 
the basis of sex, be excluded from participa-
tion in, be denied the benefits of, or be sub-
jected to discrimination under any education 
program or activity receiving Federal finan-
cial assistance. 
For 50 years, those words have 
changed the lives of American women 
and girls and their families for the bet-
ter. As a mom, I was able to watch my 
daughter excel on a more level playing 
field, and I look forward to watching 
my granddaughter do the very same 
thing. Today, more women than ever 
are competing for the awards and 
scholarships once reserved for men. 
And 
wouldn’t 
you 
know 
it—more 
women than men graduate from col-
lege. In short, title IX means some-
thing to women and girls in this coun-
try. It has opened countless doors of 
opportunity. 
Today, I would like to invite all of 
my colleagues to join me in supporting 
a simple resolution celebrating the 
promise of title IX. It recognizes the 
50th anniversary, it honors the work of 
women’s rights activists who led the 
fight for equal treatment among men 
and women in education, and it encour-
ages all women and girls in the United 
States to continue to pursue academic 
and athletic accomplishments if they 
so choose. 
I thank my colleagues in advance for 
joining me as we celebrate the women 
and girls in this country and all of 
their beautiful potential. 
f 
INFLATION 
Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. President, 
the Senate is back in session, and still 
we have no indication from the White 
House or my Democratic colleagues 
that they have a plan to lower infla-
tion. 
Tennesseans 
are 
frightened. 
You 
would be, too, if you consistently found 
more month at the end of your pay-
check than paycheck at the end of your 
month. It is getting harder to stretch 
the pennies and nickels and dimes, and 
talking points aren’t going to fix this 
problem. 
The White House keeps telling people 
that if they hang on just a little bit 
longer, they are going to be all right, 
but that is not how it works in the real 
world. In the real world, at a certain 
point, you run out of rope to hang on 
to. 
People are looking at this transition 
economy, and they are saying: What 
are we transitioning to? It is not what 
they want for their economic future. It 
is no longer a matter of just trying to 
make things work; you just can’t pay 
the bills anymore. The gas tank stays 
empty or you go to bed hungry. 
Now, it is clear that Joe Biden and 
the Democrats know that the country 
has reached a tipping point, but rather 
than offering hope, they have settled 
into blaming everyone from congres-
sional Republicans to foreign dictators 
for the problem. That is not what the 
American people want to hear. They 
know who got us in trouble, and they 
know it wasn’t Vladimir Putin; it was 
Joe Biden and the Democrats. 
It is the people—the Democrats who 
are controlling every branch of govern-
ment in this town. Yes, they have done 
it, and no amount of scapegoating will 
change the fact that the American peo-
ple have been watching closely over the 
past year and a half, and they know 
things have gone terribly wrong. 
The Biden administration abandoned 
our recovery, spent trillions on a reck-
less spending spree, and then panicked 
when all that spending caused record- 
high inflation. No, it is not temporary. 
The country doesn’t need a pep talk; 
they need Joe Biden and the Democrats 
to reverse course before we fall into a 
recession, if we haven’t done so al-
ready. 
There are things the administration 
can do right now that will pull us back 
from the brink. 
It is time to take the taxpayer-fund-
ed credit card away. The American peo-
ple can’t afford what the Democrats 
are selling, and they wouldn’t want it 
even if they could afford it. They know 
this is wasteful, out-of-control, reck-
less spending. 
Next, the President must stop ex-
panding the size and power of the Fed-
eral Government. Stop hiring bureau-
crats we don’t need at salaries we can’t 
afford to write regulations that only 
exist to take more money out of peo-
ple’s paychecks. 
Democrats would also be wise to get 
the regulators we do have out of the 
way—especially when it comes to the 
energy sector—restart the Keystone 
XL Pipeline, and make America energy 
independent again. Go back to drilling 
in Alaska, offshore, fracking. Return it 
all so that we once again are energy 
independent. 
Finally, there is something we can do 
right here in the Senate that would 
keep future spending and inflation in 
check. I have introduced legislation 
that would require a supermajority to 
pass a spending bill during times of 
high inflation. It is good common 
sense, so we should put it up for a vote. 
It is time for each of us to go on the 
record and let the American people 
know what our priorities are. They are 
tired of what they are seeing coming 
out of Washington, DC. I am glad they 
are paying attention. I am so pleased 
that Tennesseans are paying closer at-
tention now than ever before. 
I do think that it is appropriate that 
President Biden, the White House, the 
executive branch, and the Democrats 
who are in charge of Capitol Hill go on 
the record and decide if they are going 
to stand with that ‘‘Build Back Broke’’ 
agenda, stand with the radical left, or 
are they going to stand for the pros-
perity and safety of the American peo-
ple? Tennesseans know what the right 
answer would be. 
Whether I am in church, whether I 
am out at one of the grandkids’ sport-
ing 
event, 
whether 
I 
am 
at 
the 
MoonPie Festival in Bell Buckle, I 
hear it from everyone—this spending is 
out of control. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

f 
TRIBUTE TO CAROLE JOHNSON 
Mr. DAINES. Mr. President, today I 
have the distinct honor of recognizing 
Carole Johnson of Mineral County for 
her dedication to the Forest Service 
and her 50-plus years—50-plus years—of 
public service to the people of Mon-
tana. 
Raised in Superior, MT, Carole grad-
uated from Montana State University 
and joined the U.S. Forest Service in 
1971. Carole started as a seasonal rec-
reational employee on the Superior 
Ranger District of the Lolo National 
Forest and has since worked in nearly 
every facet of the Forest Service, in-
cluding 
firefighting, 
logistics, 
silviculture, surveying, mining, and 
conservation education. In 2015, Carole 
was named ‘‘Superior District Ranger,’’ 
the post she has held until retiring ear-
lier this spring. According to most ac-
counts, at the time of her retirement, 
Carole was the longest tenured Federal 
employee in the State of Montana. 
Anyone who knows Carole will tell 
you that she exemplified the definition 
of a ‘‘public servant.’’ For more than 50 
years, she served her community with 
unmatched 
institutional 
knowledge 
and professionalism. She has been a 
voice of reason in debates over public 
lands management, emphasizing that 
forest management and conservation 
truly go hand in hand. As District 
Ranger, Carole worked tirelessly to in-
crease the timber output on the Supe-
rior District to help benefit the local 
economy and support wildfire mitiga-
tion in the community. 
Outside of her role at the Forest 
Service, Carole is active in her commu-
nity. She serves on many boards, in-
cluding the Mineral Community Hos-
pital Board, the Mineral Fair Board, 
and 
the 
Glacier 
Country 
Tourism 
Board. Through her commitment to 
public service, it is clear that Carole 
has long been a well-respected and be-
loved member of the Mineral County 
community. 
It is my honor to recognize Carole for 
her dedication to the Forest Service 
and her 50-plus years of public service 
to the great State of Montana. 
Carole, thank you for your many 
years of public service and your com-
mitment to improving our public lands 
and our forests. I wish you all the very 
best in your retirement. You truly 
make Montana proud.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S3020 
June 21, 2022 
The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. MUR-
PHY). The Senator from Illinois. 
f 
UKRAINE AND LITHUANIA 
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, last 
week, Senator PORTMAN of Ohio and I 
hosted a group of visiting members of 
Parliament from Ukraine. We were 
joined by colleagues from both sides of 
the aisle in a continued demonstration 
of bipartisan support for that belea-
guered country. 
One of the Ukrainian Parliamentar-
ians included a key negotiator with the 
Russians, David Arakhamia. He was 
clear in his assessment: The Russians 
won’t negotiate seriously unless con-
fronted with strength. I agree. We must 
not let Russia regroup and retrench in 
the eastern part of Ukraine. 
We are now in the fourth month of 
this horrific war, launched without 
provocation by Russian war criminal 
Vladimir Putin to fortify his fragile 
ego and his warped nostalgia for Soviet 
horror stories. We all recall the initial 
assessments 
that 
Ukraine 
and 
its 
democratically 
elected 
government 
would fall within days of the Russian 
military assault. The Russians, for 
months, 
poised 
on 
the 
border 
of 
Ukraine a mighty force—armored mili-
tary, virtually everything imaginable. 
Well, guess what. It not only didn’t 
happen, but the Russian military was 
turned back decisively in their effort 
to take Kyiv. 
In the war-torn months since, the 
government of Ukraine has become a 
symbol of freedom, of strength, deter-
mination, and defiance around the 
world. In fact, key leaders from Europe 
visited Kyiv last week and pledged 
their support for Ukraine’s member-
ship in the European Union. 
President Biden has played a key role 
in rallying NATO allies and providing 
equipment and support that have al-
lowed the Ukrainians to heroically de-
fend their nation. He has committed 
more than $6.3 billion in security as-
sistance to Ukraine since the beginning 
of the Biden administration, with $5.6 
billion provided since the beginning of 
the war alone. 
This kind of security aid typically 
takes months to process and deliver, 
but weapons are being delivered to 
Ukraine at unprecedented speed, some 
in as little as 48 hours. Technical as-
sistance, training, and humanitarian 
aid continue in parallel. 
In fact, under President Biden’s lead-
ership, the NATO alliance has never 
been more unified or formidable, in-
cluding with two new aspiring mem-
bers, Finland and Sweden, hoping to 
join soon—a step I strongly support. 
Imagine, Vladimir Putin started this 
vicious war against Ukraine to weaken 
NATO. He strengthened that organiza-
tion, and now two pivotal nations in 
Europe have asked to join NATO for 
the first time—an indication to Putin 
that NATO’s days are ahead, not be-
hind, it. 
Despite these historic successes, we 
must continue to adjust our support for 
what is likely to be a protracted fight. 
The Ukrainian military needs long- 
range artillery and other key military 
equipment to withstand and repel the 
Russian onslaught. 
I am joining Senators PORTMAN, 
BLUMENTHAL, and GRASSLEY in a letter 
to Secretary of Defense Austin this 
week urging more long-range rocket 
artillery for Ukraine, which the admin-
istration is reportedly reviewing at 
this very moment. 
The urgent needs go beyond weapons. 
Ukraine’s economy and food exports— 
exports that feed some of the world’s 
poorest nations—cannot be held hos-
tage to Vladimir Putin’s cruelty. For 
the record, more than 20 million tons 
of Ukrainian grain exports are stopped 
because of a Russian blockade of 
Ukrainian ports, and it is estimated 
that barely half of Ukraine’s harvest 
can be exported this year. 
Secretary of State Blinken rightly 
has accused Russia of using food as a 
weapon of war, and there are credible 
reports that Russia has stolen Ukrain-
ian grain—imagine this—only to sim-
ply resell it on the world market. 
One has to ask, when you consider 
this barbaric act, following other bar-
baric acts: Does Vladimir Putin really 
believe he is going to restore the moral 
authority of Russia by his actions? Is 
this really the kind of behavior, inci-
dentally, that China wants to be asso-
ciated with? 
So our task and that of our allies 
must include not only a sustained and 
updated supply of critical weaponry 
but also help to reopen and secure 
Ukrainian ports and find alternative 
land routes for this year’s harvest. 
We must support efforts announced 
by Attorney General Garland today in 
his visit to Ukraine to help identify, 
apprehend, and prosecute those in-
volved in war crimes. Here in the Sen-
ate, we can help that effort by passing 
the bipartisan Justice for Victims of 
War Crimes Act. I have introduced this 
bill with Senator GRASSLEY to ensure 
that perpetrators of war crimes in 
Ukraine and elsewhere cannot find 
sanctuary in the United States of 
America. 
I also urge my colleagues not to 
delay approval of Finland and Sweden 
into NATO and to never again enter-
tain the weakening of this critical 
Western alliance. 
Let me also take a moment to com-
ment on threats made over the week-
end to one of our NATO allies, a nation 
which still has a recent stark memory 
of Soviet horror. I refer to Lithuania. 
Lithuania is one of the Baltic States 
that led the effort for independence 
from the Soviet Union. 
Who can forget the Baltic Way, a 
human chain of 2 million people who 
joined hands across Estonia, Latvia, 
and Lithuania 33 years ago to call for 
independence from the Soviet Union? 
Just a few years later, in July 1991, the 
Russian Government recognized the 
Baltic nations’ independence during 
the historic end of Soviet tyranny in 
Eastern Europe, recognizing that the 
Russian people were ready to give Bal-
tic States a future. 
Since then, Lithuania has flourished 
as a vocal and vibrant member of the 
European Union and NATO. This small 
nation of nearly 3 million people has 
never forgotten its own struggle for 
freedom. Lithuania was an early ally of 
Ukraine’s in its fight with Russia, 
going back to 2014. It has stood firm 
against its neighboring dictator in 
Belarus, the Putin puppet Alyaksandr 
Lukashenka, and against Chinese eco-
nomic bullying for increasing its trade 
relationship with Taiwan. 
Over the weekend, Russia actually 
threatened Lithuania, which was pre-
venting goods sanctioned by the EU 
from being transported through its ter-
ritory to the Russian territory of 
Kaliningrad. Lithuanian Foreign Min-
ister Landsbergis, who is accustomed 
to Russian threats, said: 
It’s not Lithuania doing anything. It’s Eu-
ropean sanctions that started working from 
17 June. 
Feigned Russian outrage over Lithu-
ania’s actions limiting the movement 
of these goods already sanctioned while 
Russia is bombing entire peaceful civil-
ian areas to rubble in Ukraine shows 
the depth of Putin’s madness. 
President Biden and NATO Secretary 
General Stoltenberg have been very 
clear that the organization’s commit-
ment to the common defense is iron-
clad; it will protect every inch of mem-
ber territory. Vladimir Putin should 
think carefully about the NATO com-
mitment and the horrific cost he has 
already imposed on the Russian and 
Ukrainian people before making any 
further threats and continuing his war 
crimes in Ukraine. 
Mr. President, it has been my good 
fortune to have visited Lithuania many 
times. My mother was born there. I 
have a special affection for that land 
and its people. I was there in the dark-
est of Soviet times in 1978. I am glad I 
went. As sad and depressing as it was, 
it was important for me to see that 
moment in history. 
To see Lithuania today is to see a 
brandnew democracy, thriving in its 
belief and values of individual people 
and the determination to continue 
with a free economy and an open de-
mocracy. They have come and rallied 
to the side of many around them who 
are being terrorized by Lukashenka in 
Belarus and by Putin in Ukraine. And 
Lithuania speaks up. This small nation 
of fewer than 3 million people is a na-
tion which is determined to stand for 
principle and values. 
I want to make certain they under-
stand that there are those of us here in 
the U.S. Congress who will never forget 
the battle they waged to become inde-
pendent of the Soviet Union and their 
determination to stay in that position. 
I was proud to be one of the voices in 
the chorus calling for the Baltic States 
to be part of the NATO alliance. They 
saw it as their day of liberation from 
fear, from the Soviet Union—then Rus-
sia, now Putin. We have to make sure

we keep those words sacred so that the 
NATO alliance is an alliance that can 
be counted on by all of the members. 
I am heartened by the fact that Fin-
land and Sweden are joining in this ef-
fort now, want to be part of the future 
of NATO. Extending that NATO border 
with Russia 600 to 800 miles is an affir-
mation of the foolishness of Putin. He 
actually thought, at the end of the day, 
by invading Ukraine, NATO would be 
weaker. Now it will be stronger than 
ever and, frankly, right up against his 
own country and the Finnish borders if 
they are allowed to join us in the 
NATO alliance, which I dearly hope for. 
In the meantime, to my friends and 
all of the folks I have worked with in 
Lithuania, we are so proud of your con-
tinued determination to stand up for 
what is right. Continue doing that. 
That is the spirit of the Baltics, it is 
the spirit of Lithuania, and it is the 
spirit of the NATO alliance. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

PRESCRIPTION DRUG COSTS 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I am 
here today to visit with my colleagues 
about a group that we refer to as phar-
macy benefit managers, but around 
Washington, the shorthand for that 
term is PBMs. 
Many Americans may not know 
about PBMs. They are very obscure in 
the whole pharmaceutical business. 
Yet the PBM market is nearly $500 bil-
lion, and they are powerful in our phar-
maceutical drug supply chain. 
It is our duty in Congress to under-
stand, first, how PBMs operate; second, 
hold them accountable; and, third, 
work to lower prescription drug costs 
for the taxpayers and for the con-
sumers. 
In 2018, I pressed the Federal Trade 
Commission to investigate PBMs. I saw 
the ongoing consolidation in the phar-
maceutical supply chain and its impact 
on drug prices, driving those prices up. 
But I didn’t wait for the FTC to act. 
I have pursued, one, bipartisan legis-
lation; two, held hearings; and, three, 
conducted oversight. Most recently, 
Senator CANTWELL and I have intro-
duced the PBM Transparency Act. This 
bill prohibits PBMs from engaging in 
spread pricing. This is a situation 
where PBMs charge an insurer more 
than they charge the pharmacy and 
then they pocket the difference. Iowans 
call that gaming the system. 
Another practice we prohibit in our 
bill: clawbacks. In Medicare Part D, 
these are sometimes called retroactive 
direct and indirect remuneration fees— 
or DIR, for short. 
Iowa 
pharmacists 
have 
told 
me 
clawbacks are costing patients more in 
higher copays and also costing the 
local pharmacy. This practice is put-
ting rural and independent pharmacists 
out of business. In addition, our bill 
will incentivize fair and transparent 
PBM practices, benefiting consumers 
and taxpayers. 
The bill has the support of commu-
nity pharmacists, manufacturers, and 
patient advocacy organizations. Not 
surprisingly, this industry we call 
PBMs oppose the Cantwell-Grassley 
bill. They say my bill is ‘‘anti-competi-
tive’’ and, in their words, an ‘‘expan-
sion of power at the FTC.’’ They also 
claim that their industry is already 
well-regulated. Nothing could be fur-
ther from the truth. 
My bill establishes transparency and 
accountability. So good news: Tomor-
row, the Commerce Committee will 
mark up the PBM Transparency Act. I 
don’t happen to sit on this very impor-
tant Commerce Committee, but I urge 
my colleagues to support this bill. 
Finally, I have never given up on 
passing the bipartisan Wyden-Grassley 
bill, known as the Prescription Drug 
Pricing Reduction Act. Despite the 
Democrats having the majority for 18 
months, we have not passed a prescrip-
tion drug bill. So we still have high 
prescription drug prices. 
By now, I would assume they would 
be interested in advancing a bipartisan 
prescription drug bill. They can get 60- 
plus votes, save the taxpayers $95 bil-
lion and seniors, who are consumers, 
$72 billion—rather than a partisan ef-
fort that doesn’t have 60 votes here in 
the U.S. Senate. 
I want my colleagues to know I will 
work with anyone who wants to pass 
the bipartisan Wyden-Grassley bill. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
KAINE). The clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
f 
GUN LEGISLATION 
Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, 28 days 
ago, an 18-year-old young man opened 
fire on students at the Robb Elemen-
tary School in Uvalde, TX. He mur-
dered 21 people—19 children and 2 
teachers. In the process, he effectively 
committed suicide as well. 
This was an attack that was so cruel, 
so brutal, and inhumane that it has 
brought much of our Nation to its 
knees in mourning. Since the shooting, 
my office has received—as I am sure 
many 
other 
Members 
of 
Congress 
have—I have received tens of thousands 
of calls and letters and emails with a 
singular message: Do something. 
Do something. Not do nothing, but do 
something. Texans are disgusted and 
outraged by what happened at Robb El-
ementary, and they want Congress to 
take appropriate action to prevent the 
loss of more innocent lives. 
I don’t want us to pass a bill for the 
purpose of checking a box. I want to 
make sure we actually do something 
useful, something that is capable of be-
coming a law, something that will have 
the potential to save lives. 
I am happy to report as a result of 
the hard work of a number of Senators 
in this Chamber that we have made 
some serious progress. In particular, 
over the last few weeks, Mr. MURPHY, 
the Senator from Connecticut; Ms. 
SINEMA, the Senator from Arizona; Mr. 
TILLIS, the Senator from North Caro-
lina; and I have searched high and low 
for common ground. 
Now, there are some people who 
would say, What is the use? Why try? 
We know this is an issue that divides 
much of the country, depending on 
where you live, and maybe even divides 
people living in the same household. 
But I think we have found some areas 
where there is space for compromise. 
And we have also found that there are 
some redlines and no middle ground. 
We have talked; we have debated; we 
have disagreed; and, finally, we have 
reached an agreement among the four 
of us. But, obviously, this is not some-
thing that will become law or fail to 
become law because of a small group of 
Senators. 
The truth is we had a larger group of 
20 Senators—10 Republicans and 10 
Democrats—come forward and sign on 
to an agreed set of principles, and I be-
lieve as Senators see the text that sup-
ports those principles, they will see we 
have tried our best to be true as to 
what we said those agreed principles 
should be. 
So soon, very soon—not soon enough 
for me—but very soon, we will see the 
text of bipartisan legislation that will 
help keep our children and our commu-
nities safer. 
We know there is no such thing as a 
perfect piece of legislation. We are im-
perfect human beings. But we have to 
try, and I believe this bill is a step in 
the right direction. 
One of the pillars of this legislation 
is support for community-based mental 
health care. Following the violent at-
tacks, we have all heard about missed 
signs, and the fact is the New York 
Times recently profiled the type of 
young man: typically alienated, iso-
lated, not receiving any sort of support 
or medical or psychiatric care, cer-
tainly not complying with their doc-
tors’ orders when it comes to taking 
their medication that allows them to 
manage their mental illness chal-
lenges. 
We know that this profile is one that 
Salvador Ramos fit, the shooter in 
Uvalde. He was a deeply troubled 
young man. He was isolated. He was 
bullied in school. He cut himself be-
cause he said he liked the way it made 
him look. It made him look tough. He 
had a history of fighting, of assaulting 
fellow students, of threatening sexual 
assault of young women, and torturing 
and killing animals. It is a familiar 
profile. 
This man, this young man, I think 
was crying out for help. But he got no 
help, notwithstanding the best efforts 
of people around him. He shot his own 
grandmother before he went to Robb 
Elementary School because she wanted

him to go back to the classroom after 
being out of the classroom for 2 years 
because of COVID mitigation practices. 
So our goal with this legislation is to 
try to help people in crisis get treat-
ment before they reach a point like 
Salvador Ramos. 
Now, I want to be clear: Not every-
body who is suffering a mental health 
crisis is a threat to themselves and 
others. Matter of fact, the opposite is 
true. Many people suffer in silence with 
their parents, their families, their sib-
lings, trying to help them to no avail. 
But there is a small subset of people 
like Salvador Ramos who are a danger 
to themselves and others if they don’t 
get the kind of help they need. 
So the provision of the bill which 
represents the single largest invest-
ment 
in 
community-based 
mental 
health treatment in American history 
is drawn from bipartisan legislation in-
troduced by Senator STABENOW
and 
Senator BLUNT. I think there are eight 
demonstration 
projects 
around 
the 
country. We want to make this kind of 
access 
to 
community-based 
mental 
health care available all across the 
country, and our bill will help to do 
that. 
It 
expands 
high-quality 
mental 
health and addiction services nation-
wide through the expansion of certified 
community behavioral health clinics. 
Many of these providers already oper-
ate in communities across the country, 
but our legislation expands the net-
works of clinics to deliver even strong-
er and more fulsome support to our 
communities. 
We also include provisions to expand 
support of care in our schools because 
it is at school that many of our young 
people will be identified as needing 
support. 
Teachers actually spend more time 
than 
parents, 
typically, 
with 
our 
school-aged children; and the supported 
services that will be part of this bill 
will help identify students that need 
that help so that intervention can 
come as early as possible. 
As the Presiding Officer probably 
knows, 60 percent of gun deaths in 
America are suicides—suicides. We not 
only want to try our best to do things 
that will hopefully stop the Salvador 
Ramoses in the future from hurting 
other people, we want to try to help 
them and keep them from hurting 
themselves as well. 
So I believe this huge investment in 
America’s mental health delivery sys-
tem is an investment in safer and 
healthier communities. 
Another pillar of the legislation is 
school safety. The Uvalde shooter was 
able to enter Robb Elementary School 
through a door that was not locked 
when it should have been. That is an 
obvious vulnerability. Schools need to 
be prepared for the worst-case scenario, 
which means evaluating physical secu-
rity measures, reviewing current pro-
tocol, adopting best practices, which 
are broadly available through publica-
tions and studies by the Secret Service 
and other law enforcement agencies. 
And they also need to be able to add or 
expand the number of school resource 
officers as appropriate. 
I have said it before, and I will say it 
again: No parent should have to send 
their child to school fearful for their 
child’s safety, and no child should have 
to go to school and be afraid for their 
safety. 
All of our students and teachers and 
the administrators and others in our 
schools deserve to feel safe, and par-
ents deserve peace of mind, and that is 
what I hope these additional resources 
will provide. 
Now, the final range portion of this 
bill beyond mental health and school 
safety involves a range of provisions to 
prevent these sort of violent attacks 
from occurring in the future. 
Again, I believe that law-abiding citi-
zens are not the problem. I don’t be-
lieve law-abiding citizens are a threat 
to public health, and this bill honors 
that commitment. 
So unless a person is convicted of a 
crime or is adjudicated mentally ill, 
their ability to purchase a firearm will 
not be impacted by this legislation. 
Now, some have suggested provisions 
that I believe would infringe on Second 
Amendment rights and really not get 
to the root of the problem. 
For example, there is no particular 
ban on a type of gun or no mandatory 
waiting periods, no background checks 
of intrafamily or friend-to-friend trans-
fer, none of these are included in the 
legislation. And some of our colleagues 
clearly would like to see that. But, 
again, that is because law-abiding gun 
owners are not the problem. 
What we are trying to do is prevent 
dangerous individuals from unleashing 
violence on their communities. And 
one way of achieving that goal is 
through more robust crisis interven-
tion programs. 
Now, that is a broad term that de-
scribes a range of initiatives that aim 
to reduce violence, protect the public, 
and connect individuals in crisis with 
the help they need. 
It could include something called as-
sisted outpatient treatment, which al-
lows courts to order people with men-
tal health challenges to receive out-
patient treatment to ensure they re-
ceive the care they needed, and the 
court will hold them accountable to 
make sure they make the doctors’ ap-
pointments and take the medications 
they need in order to remain produc-
tive. 
But beyond AOTs—or assisted out-
patient treatment—there are very ef-
fective regimes like mental health 
courts, like I saw in Dallas, TX, not 
that long ago. 
Now, one of the things that encour-
ages compliance is the fact that you 
have a judge, somebody wearing a 
black robe, saying: You will do this. 
And if that is what it takes, that is fine 
with me. But there are also drug 
courts, veterans’ courts, and the like 
which aim to treat the root cause, not 
the symptom. And across the country, 
there are hundreds of mental health 
and veterans’ treatment courts and 
thousands of drug court programs that 
have delivered incredible results. 
I have been clear at the outset that I 
am interested in providing law enforce-
ment-related grants to all 50 States to 
put forward a range of crisis interven-
tion programs that the State deems 
best to help reduce suicide and vio-
lence. 
Now, some of our colleagues wanted 
to focus this money solely on the 19 
States that have passed some form of 
red flag law, and, frankly, that is a 
choice that is up to the State. But we 
are not introducing a national red flag 
law, but we are providing the avail-
ability 
of 
law 
enforcement-related 
grants to crisis intervention programs, 
whether you adopted a red flag pro-
gram or not. Perhaps you have chosen 
something different. Well, this grant 
program will get every State funding 
that implements programs that they 
themselves have adopted to stop indi-
viduals in crisis from reaching the 
point of violence or self-harm. 
If any State wants to pass a law, ob-
viously, under our Constitution, they 
have plenary authority to pass what-
ever crisis intervention laws they 
choose to do so. But one of the things 
that we have agreed upon is they have 
to have robust due process protections 
because we are talking about a con-
stitutional right. 
So if the new law does not include 
due process protections, it will not be 
eligible for these grants, no matter 
what form that crisis intervention pro-
gram takes. 
Our bill also provides increased pro-
tection for domestic violence victims. 
It shouldn’t matter whether a person is 
married to their abuser, if the abuser is 
convicted of domestic violence, and 
many people have what I would call 
nontraditional relationships, whether 
they are living together, they have a 
child together, or whether they just 
have a long-term romantic or intimate 
relationship. Eighty-six percent of gun- 
owning households support that sort of 
protection for domestic violence vic-
tims, where, too often, a gun is in-
volved. 
Again, this doesn’t limit law-abiding 
gun owners’ rights unless somebody is 
convicted of domestic abuse under 
their State laws. Their gun rights will 
not be impacted. 
Again, this portion of the bill in-
cludes critical due process protections 
which, as we all know, is part of our 
Constitution. You shall not be deprived 
of your rights without due process of 
law. 
One new feature that we proposed is 
that those who are convicted of non-
spousal misdemeanor domestic abuse— 
not felony but misdemeanor domestic 
violence—will 
have 
an 
opportunity 
after 5 years to have their Second 
Amendment rights restored, but they 
have to have a clean record. And this is 
an incentive, in fact, I think, for people

who have made a mistake and have 
committed domestic violence and re-
ceived a misdemeanor conviction to 
straighten up their act and to not re-
peat it. 
Our bill also strengthens the Na-
tional Instant Criminal Background 
Check System, known as NICS, to en-
sure it is more fulsome and accurate. 
In Uvalde, this young man, Salvador 
Ramos, turned 18. He went in and 
passed a background check. It is like 
he was born yesterday because there 
was no way for the National Instant 
Criminal Background checks system to 
look back on any mental health adju-
dications 
or 
criminal 
convictions, 
which would have barred him from pur-
chasing a firearm had it occurred as an 
adult. 
If a 17-year-old is convicted of a vio-
lent crime or adjudicated as mentally 
incompetent, that information should 
show up in the background check sys-
tem if he tries to purchase a firearm 
when he turns 18. 
Eighty-seven percent of gun-owning 
households in America support making 
juvenile records available in the back-
ground check system, and this legisla-
tion will make that possible. 
Now, the States will control what in-
formation they are willing to share, 
but our legislation provides an incen-
tive for States to upload the records 
that reflect on the suitability of an in-
dividual to purchase a firearm, allow 
them to upload juvenile records into 
the National Instant Criminal Back-
ground System to ensure that firearms 
are not falling into the hands of those 
under 21 who would be prohibited from 
purchasing that gun if they were an 
adult when it happened. 
So I know this bill is not going to 
please everyone. Some think it goes 
too far; others think it doesn’t go far 
enough, and I get it. But the nature of 
compromise and the nature of actually 
wanting to get a result requires that 
everybody try to find common ground 
where we can, and that is particularly 
hard in a 50–50 U.S. Senate. 
But I believe the same people who are 
telling us to do something are sending 
us a clear message to do what we can 
to keep our children and communities 
safe. I am confident this legislation 
moves us in a positive direction. 
I want to thank all of our colleagues 
who have worked so hard in this proc-
ess that has gotten us this far. My un-
derstanding is that the text will be re-
leased essentially at any moment, al-
though the principles upon which that 
text is written have been public for 
quite a while now. 
This legislation is the product of 
good-faith, bipartisan negotiations. It 
includes bills and ideas offered by col-
leagues on both sides of the aisle, and 
it makes changes that are supported by 
vast majorities of Americans. And I 
think, most importantly, it has the 
real potential to become a law and to 
create real changes in communities 
across this country—safer, healthier 
communities; stronger, more secure 
schools; saving lives. That is what we 
are all about. 
So I am eager to discuss more details 
with our colleagues as they review the 
text in the coming days, and I hope we 
can continue to show the same sort of 
good faith and the openness to other 
ideas that have brought us to this 
point as we debate and we vote on this 
bipartisan legislation.

I suggest the absence of a quorum.

NOMINATION OF ANA ISABEL de 
ALBA 
Mr. PADILLA. Mr. President, today, 
I am proud to celebrate two district 
judges joining the Federal bench for 
the State of California. 
We are scheduled to vote shortly on 
the confirmation of Judge Ana de Alba, 
who is nominated to become a judge for 
the Eastern District of California. 
Judge de Alba brings a lifelong com-
mitment to advancing justice in Cali-
fornia’s Central Valley. The daughter 
of immigrants from Mexico, she was 
born in Merced, CA, and grew up in a 
family of farmworkers. 
Judge de Alba watched her mother 
and her grandmother struggle with un-
fair treatment, as they worked to-
gether in some of the hardest jobs in 
the world. 
She decided at a young age that one 
day—one day—she would become a law-
yer to help families like her own. 
Judge de Alba is a first-generation 
high school graduate. She went on to 
earn her bachelor’s degree and her J.D. 
from UC Berkeley. And after grad-
uating, she built a successful career in 
private practice in the Central Valley, 
and she realized her childhood dream of 
service by establishing a Workers’ 
Rights Clinic for low-wage workers to 
learn their rights and to seek legal ad-
vice. 
In 2018, based on her extensive legal 
experience and proven commitment to 
the public good, Judge de Alba was ap-
pointed by then-Governor Brown to 
serve as a superior court judge for 
Fresno County. 
Judge de Alba is a dedicated, fair, 
and universally respected public serv-
ant, respected by her colleagues. 
I also want to note that if confirmed, 
Judge de Alba will be the first Latina 
to sit on the Eastern District bench. 
She will bring a deep knowledge of the 
Central Valley and a passion for equal 
justice, informed and inspired by her 
own family’s story. 
So I urge my colleagues to join me in 
supporting Judge de Alba’s confirma-
tion today. 
CONFIRMATION OF ROBERT 
STEVEN HUIE 
Mr. PADILLA. Mr. President, I would 
also like to take this moment to cele-
brate the confirmation last month of 
Judge Robert Huie, now serving in the 
Southern District of California. 
Judge Huie is a resident of San 
Diego, where he has lived and worked 
for nearly 20 years, but his roots in 
California, in fact, began generations 
ago. His grandfather immigrated to 
San Francisco from China in the 1930s, 
making his home there until joining 
the U.S. Army. 
Judge Huie is a talented lawyer who 
has continually sought out opportuni-
ties to promote justice. 
He earned his undergraduate degree 
from Calvin College and his J.D. from 
Yale Law School. His career includes 12 
years of service as an assistant U.S. at-
torney for the Southern District of 
California. 
During that time, he investigated 
and prosecuted more than 600 district 
court cases and two dozen appeals on 
matters ranging from public corruption 
to securities fraud, to bank robberies. 
And at the outset of the COVID–19 
pandemic, Judge Huie took the initia-
tive to create a districtwide working 
group that combated pandemic-related 
fraud. 
Judge Huie’s commitment to service, 
his strong work ethic, and his insight-
ful legal thinking will benefit the com-
munity of the Southern District. 
Mr. President, as a member of the 
Senate Judiciary Committee, I am 
proud of the work that we continue to 
do to confirm outstanding, effective, 
and diverse judges across the Federal 
court system. That is especially impor-
tant in places like the Southern Dis-
trict and Eastern District of Cali-
fornia—two of the busiest Federal judi-
cial districts in the entire country. As 
we confirm more nominees like Judge 
de Alba and Judge Huie, we are build-
ing a Federal court system that can 
better deliver on the promise of equal 
justice for all.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S3024 
June 21, 2022 
a level of fear on the faces of the par-
ents and children whom I spoke to that 
I have never seen before. This country 
has lived through mass shooting after 
mass shooting, rising rates of homi-
cide, but there was something different 
in the eyes of these families as they 
once again had to contemplate the idea 
that our schools are no longer safe 
places, that our supermarkets are no 
longer safe spaces. 
But they also were contemplating 
the idea that Congress was so caught 
up in its own politics, so addicted to 
backing into our own corners that we 
wouldn’t be able to do anything mean-
ingful about the thing that matters 
most to parents and to families in this 
country: the physical safety of their 
children. Think about it. What matters 
more to you than the physical well- 
being of your children? You would give 
away everything—your job, your car, 
the roof over your head—in order to 
guarantee that your children were safe 
from physical harm. 
So the anxiety and the fear that I 
saw in Connecticut and that I think 
many of my colleagues saw when they 
returned to their States was not just 
for the safety of their children but also 
a fear about the ability of government 
to rise to this moment and do some-
thing and do something meaningful. 
I believe that this week we will pass 
legislation that will become the most 
significant piece of anti-gun violence 
legislation Congress will have passed in 
30 years. This is a breakthrough, and 
more importantly, it is a bipartisan 
breakthrough. I am glad to join my 
friend Senator CORNYN
on the floor 
today to talk a little bit about the 
piece of legislation that our colleagues 
will be able to look at hopefully in a 
matter of moments and that this body 
will be able to consider this week. 
I want to thank Senator CORNYN, 
Senator TILLIS, and Senator SINEMA in 
particular. It was a hard road to get to 
this compromise, but nothing worth-
while is easy. And nobody in a com-
promise gets everything they want. 
This bill will be too little for many; it 
will be too much for others. But it isn’t 
a box-checking exercise. This bill is 
not window dressing. This bill is going 
to save lives. This bill is going to save 
thousands of lives. It is going to be 
something that every single Member of 
this Senate who votes for it can be 
proud of. 
I want to tell you a little bit about 
it, and some of this has already been 
covered by my friend Senator CORNYN. 
First, let me talk about the provisions 
in this bill that change our Nation’s 
firearms laws. 
First, we are going to invest in the 
development of crisis intervention or-
ders. We are going to give money out 
to States that they will be able to use 
to implement what are commonly 
called red flag laws. These are laws 
that allow local authorities and courts 
to take weapons, firearms, temporarily 
away from individuals who are threat-
ening to hurt themselves or others. 
We just saw Connecticut’s red flag 
law be used just in the last month or so 
to take weapons away from a young 
man who was making threats to shoot 
up schools, potentially saving dozens of 
lives. 
Under this bill, every State will be 
able to use significant new Federal dol-
lars to be able to expand their pro-
grams to try to stop dangerous peo-
ple—people contemplating mass mur-
der or suicide—from being able to have 
access to the weapons that allow them 
to perpetrate that crime. 
As Senator CORNYN said, we will also 
make those dollars eligible for a nar-
row range of other court-based anti-vi-
olence interventions—something that 
was very important to our Republican 
colleagues. 
Second, this bill is going to make 
sure that no domestic abusers can pur-
chase or own a gun. We are closing the 
boyfriend loophole. What we know is 
that in States that have taken this 
step already, there are 10 percent fewer 
intimate partner deaths. This is an in-
credibly important step forward. We 
know this provision alone is going to 
save lives of so many women who un-
fortunately die at the hands of a boy-
friend or an ex-boyfriend who hunts 
them down with a firearm. 
To be consistent with State felony 
restoration rights, this legislation will 
allow individuals to be able to get their 
right back after a period of time but 
only for first-time offenders and only if 
there are no crimes of violence in the 
intervening time. 
This bill will provide for enhanced 
background checks for younger buyers. 
What we know is that the profile of the 
modern mass shooter is often in the 18- 
to 21-year-old range, and so this bill 
has enhanced background checks for 
those individuals, including a call to 
the local police department—a process 
that can take up to 3 days and up to 10 
days if there are particular signs of 
concern that investigators need to per-
form followup on. That enhanced back-
ground check is going to make sure 
that younger buyers who are in crisis 
have another check performed—per-
haps a short period of time in between 
their decision to buy a lethal weapon 
to perform a crime and their ability to 
get that weapon. 
This bill has new criminal statutes 
banning gun trafficking and straw pur-
chasing. This is incredibly important 
for our cities. We have a flow of illegal 
guns coming into these cities, and yet, 
for decades, for some reason, Congress 
has not given our Federal authorities 
the ability to interrupt these gun-run-
ning rings because we have no effective 
ban at a Federal level on trafficking 
and straw-purchasing. We will after we 
pass this law. 
Finally, we clarify under this bill 
who needs to register as a federally li-
censed gun dealer. One of the individ-
uals who sold a weapon to a mass 
shooter in Odessa, TX, should have 
been licensed as a Federal dealer, but 
he wasn’t, and he sold the gun to a per-
son who was prohibited from buying 
the gun because of his mental health 
history, without a background check. 
We will clarify in this law that individ-
uals like that need to register as Fed-
eral firearms dealers, and they need to 
perform background checks. 
As Senator CORNYN
said, this bill 
makes a historic investment in mental 
health—a historic investment in men-
tal health. Thanks to DEBBIE STABE-
NOW and ROY BLUNT, we are going to be 
able to expand the certified community 
health center model nationally. That 
literally means millions of people in 
this country in underserved areas who 
have no access to mental health are 
going to be able to get it after we pass 
this bill. 
We have significant new funding in 
this bill for school-based health centers 
to make sure that kids are better 
served, especially those kids who are in 
crisis. 
We have help in this bill for pediatri-
cians who are trying to do telehealth 
consults with behavioral health profes-
sionals who are trying to get more 
training on mental health so they can 
help their patients. 
Finally, we make investments in 
school and community safety, funds to 
help schools make their campuses safer 
places but also funds for community- 
based programs that are doing good 
work in cities from Boston to Hartford 
to Dallas interrupting cycles of vio-
lence in our communities. 
For 30 years—murder after murder, 
suicide after suicide, mass shooting 
after 
mass 
shooting—Congress 
did 
nothing. This week, we have a chance 
to break this 30-year period of silence 
with a bill that changes our laws in a 
way that will save thousands of lives. 
It is a compromise. It is a bipartisan 
compromise. It is a path forward to the 
way that both Republicans and Demo-
crats can work together to address 
some of the most vexing, most difficult 
challenges this Nation faces. 
We have a chance to show parents 
and kids and families that we take 
their safety seriously and we are pre-
pared to do not just something but 
something that saves lives in order to 
protect them. 
I yield the floor.

UKRAINE 
Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, I 
come to the floor again today to up-
date people on what is happening in 
Ukraine as Russia continues its illegal, 
unprovoked, and brutal assault on that 
country and talk more about what we 
can do here in the Congress and as 
Americans 
to 
help 
the 
people 
of 
Ukraine during this desperate hour. 
This will be the 16th consecutive week 
I have come to the floor to discuss the 
invasion while the Senate has been in 
session. 
We are now on the 118th day of this 
war on Ukraine. In response, the brav-
ery and effectiveness of the Ukrainian 
defenders has been unbelievable, truly 
impressive, but not surprising because 
they are fighting to defend their home-
land, their families, and their freedom. 
They have shown again and again the 
power that comes with that. Just 4 
days ago was another example of 
Ukrainian tenacity and success against 
a much bigger and better armed Rus-
sian army. Last Friday, Ukrainian 
military officials announced that they 
struck and sunk a Russian vessel in the 
Black Sea using two Harpoon anti-ship 
missiles supplied by the West. The ship 
was carrying personnel and anti-air-
craft equipment to Snake Island, which 
the Russians invaded early on and used 
as an outpost to assist in their block-
ade of Ukraine. 
This action marks the first time that 
Ukraine has destroyed a Russian vessel 
with a new, Western-supplied arma-
ment. It is an example of what we can 
do, the United States and other allied 
countries, 42 of us who are helping 
Ukraine, giving them the tools they 
need to defend their homeland. 
By the way, the Ukrainians have now 
sunk so many Russian ships that the 
head of the Odessa Oblast military ad-
ministration remarked that Ukraine is 
creating ‘‘an underwater brigade at the 
bottom of the Black Sea.’’ 
Despite these successes in the Black 
Sea, Russia has taken the upper hand 
in the critical area east of Ukraine 
called the Donbas. The Donbas region 
is this area of Ukraine in eastern 
Ukraine where Russia has really fo-
cused its forces. Previously, you recall 
they took Crimea in 2014, and they 
took a part of the Donbas—Donbas and 
Donetsk areas. Now they are trying to 
take the entire Donetsk region and 
more. 
Although the Ukrainians are fighting 
valiantly in this area of the Donbas, 
they are simply being outgunned by 
the Russians, who have longer range 
and very accurate Russian missiles. 
The stakes are really high right now. 
The fate of a sovereign country to re-
main free hangs in the balance. But not 
only that, if Vladimir Putin is success-
ful here in the Donbas in taking more 
than he already controls, I think it 
would be naive to believe he will stop 
there. Based on his own words, he 
won’t stop there. The Baltics could be 
next. He already has a puppet dictator-
ship here in Belarus. These countries— 
Baltics, Poland, Romania, where I was 
recently, Moldova—they are all con-
cerned and rightly so. We cannot allow 
him to achieve these goals. 
Last Wednesday, the Senate Ukraine 
Caucus, which I cofounded along with 
Senator DICK DURBIN, hosted six mem-
bers of the Ukrainian Parliament, or 
Rada, leaders in the Parliament who 
came to talk to us, along with Ukrain-
ian Ambassador to the United States 
Oksana Markarova. They offered a very 
blunt view of the current war, which 
we have now heard many times over 
these past several weeks. 
Ukrainian soldiers are fighting very 
hard to defend their homeland, but 
Russia is incrementally advancing, 
killing 100 to 500 Ukrainian soldiers 
every day, as well as dozens of civil-
ians, and destroying cities in the 
Donbas area with a steady barrage of 
missiles. Russia is sitting back and fir-
ing these guided missiles with impu-
nity because the shorter range Ukrain-
ian missiles can’t reach them. 
The delegation of Ukrainian Par-
liament 
leaders 
included 
David 
Arakhamia, one of Ukraine’s lead nego-
tiators with the Russians. He told us 
the Russians are essentially delaying 
negotiations until Russia has secured 
control over this whole area of the 
Donbas, and then they will pretend to 
engage in negotiations while taking 
that time to recover their combat 
power and prepare for yet another of-
fensive. 
Russia must not be allowed to con-
tinue to gain ground in the Donbas. We 
have to get the Ukrainians what they 
need to protect themselves, the weap-
ons and equipment they need to be able 
to succeed so they can have negotia-
tions with the Russians but on their 
terms, not the Russians’. 
There is a solution to the Ukrainians 
being outgunned. Over the past several 
years, Ukrainian officials have specifi-
cally requested the advanced weapons 
rocket artillery systems. The United 
States operates one such system. It is 
called the HIMARS, or High Mobility 
Artillery Rocket System. We have hun-
dreds of these in our inventory, many 
of which are not with Active units. 
They are superior to Russian artillery 
in almost every respect—mobility, re-
load time, accuracy, and most impor-
tantly, range. Yet, during Ukraine’s 
hour of need, it has taken us too long 
to respond, and we are providing too 
few units to make a serious impact. 
Three weeks ago, the administration 
did announce they would send HIMARS 
to Ukraine but just four units. 
With the time it takes to train 
Ukrainian soldiers on how to operate 
this platform, the systems will not be 
combat ready until at least this week, 
according to press reports. So we an-
nounced it a few weeks ago, but every 
day brave Ukrainians have been dying 
and Donbas cities have been systemati-
cally destroyed and the countryside 
has been conquered step-by-step. 
We must act more quickly, and we 
must do more. The Wall Street Journal 
editorial board recently expounded on 
this argument in very stark terms 
when they said: 
How many rocket systems do our friends 
need? [Well] a . . . military adviser [from 
Ukraine] told [a reporter recently]: ‘‘If we 
get 60’’ systems ‘‘then the Russians will lose 
all ability to advance anywhere, they will be 
stopped dead in their tracks. If we get 40 
they will [be able to] advance, albeit very 
slowly with heavy casualties; with 20 they 
will continue to advance with higher casual-
ties than now.’’ 
We are providing four. 
When I met with the Rada, they told 
me that they would need at least 48 ad-
vanced rocket artillery systems to 
have a meaningful impact. So, again, 
so far we have only provided four. My 
hope is, based on conversations I have 
had with the administration, that more 
are coming. But any new units an-
nounced won’t reach the battlefield

with trained crews for roughly 3 weeks. 
Defense officials know that we need to 
move more quickly, and I hope we will. 
I am pleased to report that the Brits, 
the UK, and also the Germans have of-
fered their own rocket systems similar 
to ours—in fact, the British system is 
bigger 
than 
ours—but 
only 
three 
apiece. 
To address this, today I sent a letter 
with my colleagues Senators Durbin, 
Blumenthal, and Grassley to Secretary 
of Defense Austin urging the adminis-
tration to rapidly send significant 
amounts of these advanced rocket ar-
tillery systems to Ukraine, working 
with our allies. 
In our inventory, we have hundreds 
of these HIMARS, and getting these 
systems to Ukraine could be a game 
changer. We need to send them more 
quickly so they have a fighting chance 
in this war. 
With these systems in their arsenal, I 
believe the Ukrainians could turn the 
tables on the Russians, just like they 
have done in so many other places. Re-
member, in Kyiv, the success there. In 
Kharkiv, they are having some success 
pushing back the Russians there. 
Even here in the eastern part toward 
Kherson, they are having some success, 
but they need help here with regard to 
these artillery systems. It is an artil-
lery battle. 
The Wall Street Journal Editorial 
Board went on to say: 
The stakes are high, [but not just] for 
Ukraine. If the Russian military mops up the 
Donbas, Vladimir Putin will have grabbed 
more land that he can sell at home as a vic-
tory. 
He 
can 
then 
regroup 
and 
push 
south[east] toward Odessa— 
Down here— 
robbing the Ukrainians of their coast line 
and building a bridge to Transnistria in 
Moldova. 
Up here. 
Europe will be less secure, and Mr. Biden 
will bear some responsibility. 
The editorial continued with the 
threat to other nations, saying: 
Skeptics of U.S. aid to Ukraine like to say 
we can’t support the country forever. But 
that’s all the more reason to get Kyiv the 
right weapons sooner and in enough numbers 
so Ukraine can stop and then roll back Rus-
sian advances. That’s the only way to get 
Mr. Putin to the negotiating table with any 
hope of a cease-fire on Ukrainian terms fa-
vorable to NATO. 
I think they are right. We just pro-
vided $40 billion for Ukraine—very gen-
erous from the U.S. taxpayers. Rough-
ly, $21 billion of that goes toward mili-
tary. 
I am not suggesting we spend more 
than that. I am suggesting that we use 
the $21 billion in a more effective way 
to give them what they actually need 
to be able to push back against the 
Russians, given this current threat. 
Russia won’t stop at the Donbas. 
They will conquer the rest of Ukraine’s 
Black Sea coastline, as was said in this 
editorial. This, by the way, would 
landlock Ukraine, one of the great ex-
porters of the world. It is an attempt 
to ruin the country economically. 
One thing that has become crystal 
clear over the past decade, Russia only 
responds to strength. When President 
Putin has sensed weakness, that is ex-
actly when his aggression has in-
creased. He invaded Ukraine 4 months 
ago because he believed that Ukraine 
and the West would not respond force-
fully. He believed he could divide 
NATO. 
Both of these assumptions proved to 
be wrong, and Russia was initially 
pushed back. But note that they just 
kept coming, now believing that free-
dom-loving democracies around the 
world will become war weary; that our 
attention span is too short. 
He believes he can outlast us. I am 
concerned that some are losing inter-
est. 
Look 
at 
the 
news 
coverage. 
Ukraine often is no longer in the head-
lines, not in the nightly news, even 
though the destruction continues; the 
bombing of civilian targets continues; 
the war crimes continue. 
I am concerned that some are forget-
ting the global stakes involved in this 
war and how important it is to ensure 
that Ukraine wins and Russia loses. If 
Russia senses that the West is weak 
and distracted and losing interest in 
Ukraine, it will continue this war and 
bring it ever closer to our NATO allies. 
That is exactly why we need to pro-
vide Ukrainians what they need to 
fight back right now, especially these 
HIMAR systems. We must accelerate 
our deliveries if we are serious about 
supporting Ukraine. 
Fortunately, other nations continue 
to offer support. During last week’s 
meeting of the Ukraine Defense Con-
tact Group in Belgium, Secretary of 
Defense Austin urged nations ‘‘not to 
lose steam’’ in their efforts to aid 
Ukraine during Russia’s invasion. Good 
for him. 
He reported that Germany will offer 
three long-range artillery rocket sys-
tems with ammunition to follow the 
UK’s example, and Slovakia is prom-
ising helicopters and ammunition. Po-
land, Canada, and the Netherlands have 
promised more artillery. Forty-two na-
tions have stepped forward, in all, to 
provide military assistance to Ukraine, 
not just us. 
Several of these leaders also com-
mitted to Ukrainian officials that the 
West would not demand any territorial 
concessions from Ukraine to appease 
Russia and will support Ukraine to the 
end of this war. 
That is very welcome news. Making 
any territorial concessions to Russia 
would only embolden Putin and other 
future would-be conquerors. The lesson 
they would learn is that with enough 
patience, we can wear down the West 
and get what we want. 
We saw how the territorial conces-
sions worked in the late 1930s. It only 
increased Nazi Germany’s appetite. 
Nazi Germany was not led to think 
that if they took over one country, 
that they couldn’t take over the next. 
The United States needs to join our 
allies and continue to reaffirm our un-
wavering commitment to Ukraine’s 
territorial integrity. While we continue 
our mission, Americans of all stripes 
have gone to Ukraine to help, some as 
volunteers. Some have gone actually to 
help fight alongside Ukraine forces to 
defend that democratic country. 
According to reports, two Americans 
have been taken prisoner by Russian- 
backed forces, and a third American is 
missing. We need to get our people out. 
Just yesterday, the Kremlin’s chief 
spokesman told NBC that the two 
Americans are not protected by the Ge-
neva 
Convention. 
He 
stated 
they 
should ‘‘be held responsible for the 
crimes they have committed.’’ 
By the way, the only ‘‘crime’’ they 
have committed was fighting back 
against 
the 
Russians 
and 
helping 
Ukraine, an ally and a democracy, de-
fend its sovereign territory. 
The Russians seem to be so accus-
tomed to killing unarmed Ukrainian 
civilians that they are shocked when 
anyone on the other side actually dares 
to shoot back. 
Let me be clear: These Americans are 
prisoners of war subject to the protec-
tions of the Geneva Convention, and 
any unlawful prosecution would be an 
unacceptable acceleration, an esca-
lation by Russia. I expect the adminis-
tration to develop a plan to address 
these men’s situation and get them out 
of Kremlin captivity. That is on the 
military side. 
On sanctions, when it comes to fund-
ing for Russia’s war machine, last week 
the Treasury Department announced it 
will allow certain energy-related trans-
actions with SberBank, VTB Bank, 
Alfa Bank, and several other Russian 
entities to continue until December 5. 
The 
United 
States 
has 
already 
banned imports of Russian oil and gas 
and imposed sanctions, but now the ad-
ministration seems to want to extend 
bank transactions on Russian oil and 
gas sent to European countries. That 
doesn’t make sense to me. There have 
been bipartisan calls here in this Con-
gress to put a halt to sending President 
Putin the money to fund his war ma-
chine. Remember, the EU is using Rus-
sian oil and gas, dependent on it in 
many cases, and sending roughly $870 
million a day to Russia to fund that 
war machine. So why would we want to 
extend these licenses to early Decem-
ber? 
I asked the Department of Treasury 
about this and was told that it was to 
align with the EU sanctions. I fear we 
are letting EU lead while we follow 
with softer sanctions than we must 
have in order to get Russia to feel as 
though there is some impact here; that 
what they are doing in Ukraine is hurt-
ing their economy. 
America needs to lead from the front 
on sanctions, not lead from behind. 
When we do lead, by the way, others 
follow. This is true with the revived 
NATO right now. It is 30 countries 
strong, and members are more com-
mitted than ever to pushing back 
against this Russian invasion.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S3027 
June 21, 2022 
In fact, in the wake of Russia’s inva-
sion of Ukraine, Sweden and Finland 
have shrugged off a long history of neu-
trality to apply to join NATO. I ap-
plaud them for this and look forward to 
voting in favor of their accession trea-
ties on the U.S. Senate floor here very 
soon. 
Tomorrow, in fact, the Senate For-
eign Relations Committee is going to 
hold a hearing on their interest in join-
ing the alliance. I urge my Senate col-
leagues to support this, and instead of 
causing global division, as he meant to 
do, show President Putin that he has 
brought NATO together and added to 
the strength of NATO. 
I urge swift consideration of NATO 
expansion. Let’s bring the Swedes and 
the Finns into the fold. We can’t forget 
that Russia has claimed this war start-
ed because Ukraine wanted to join the 
NATO alliance. It is certainly true that 
as they reaffirmed in 2014, when they 
threw off a Russian-backed corrupt 
government, the people of Ukraine 
have been looking westward, not east-
ward. 
Of course, they want to join NATO 
and they want to join the European 
Union and they want to form ever clos-
er bonds with the transatlantic com-
munity—and they have made signifi-
cant progress in doing this. This brutal 
invasion is just Russia’s latest attempt 
to throw that progress off course, to 
stop them from what is their inevitable 
move to the West. We must not be de-
terred. 
As I have said before, Ukraine de-
serves NATO membership and imme-
diately the NATO membership action 
plan to provide a clear path to eventual 
membership. At the NATO summit in 
Madrid last week, much of the atten-
tion will rightfully be focused on Swe-
den and Finland, but I urge the leaders 
gathered there to remember Ukraine 
and Georgia in a similar situation as 
well. 
Just last Friday, there was some big 
news. The European Commission rec-
ommended that Ukraine be granted 
candidate status to join the European 
Union. That is not NATO, but it is the 
European Union, the political union. 
The recommendation by the Euro-
pean Commission, the EU’s executive 
body, is a significant step forward to-
ward EU membership. The Commission 
also recommended EU candidate status 
for Moldova, a country with its own 
troubled history with Russia. 
Here we see Moldova between Roma-
nia and Ukraine. Transnistria is right 
along here, which is controlled by the 
Russians, a small part of Moldova. I 
visited Moldova last month and met 
with their government, including their 
Prime Minister. 
We have a very strong partner in 
Moldova. They, too, are looking to the 
West. The people of Moldova want their 
freedom and freedom from Russian in-
timidation. When the leaders of the EU 
meet next month in Brussels, I hope 
they 
will 
strongly 
support 
both 
Ukraine’s and Moldova’s candidacies 
toward the European Union. 
Soon, the Senate is going to adjourn 
for a couple of weeks. During that 
time, Ukraine will be continuing to de-
fend its territorial integrity. I have 
now come to the floor, as I said, every 
week to highlight this fight—every 
week since this illegal, unprovoked, 
and brutal invasion began. 
The Ukrainian people just want to 
live in peace, including with their 
neighbor, Russia. This is our fight dur-
ing our generation where democracy is 
on the line. How this war develops will 
have far-reaching impacts on all of us, 
all freedom-loving countries, including 
the United States of America. 
Most of us in this Chamber, Repub-
licans and Democrats alike, get that. 
We know that America can’t afford to 
stay on the sidelines and be a spectator 
in this conflict. At this crucial time in 
the battle for freedom, democracy, and 
the ability for countries to decide their 
own future, America cannot afford to 
be tentative. That is why we need to 
supply them with these mobile rocket 
launchers, the HIMAR system, to have 
the range and the ability to protect 
themselves. 
Let’s not be tentative. We must re-
member the lesson of the late 1930s: 
that appeasing tyrants will not satiate 
their desire to violently conquer and 
subjugate their neighbors. Ukrainians 
certainly understand this. They know 
what it is like to live under the thumb 
of authoritarians, the Soviets, the Rus-
sians, and they broke away from that 
and toward democracy, first in 1991 and 
again in 2014. 
I was in Ukraine after the Revolution 
of Dignity, which is what they call it, 
in 2014, where Ukrainians decided for 
themselves that they wanted to turn 
away from Russian domination and 
corruption and turn to us—Europe and 
the United States—to pursue a more 
hopeful future of freedom and democ-
racy. 
Now President Putin is trying to ex-
tinguish that hope. We cannot let that 
happen. The countries of the free world 
are with us but more so when we lead. 
Now is not the time to equivocate. 
At this critical juncture, let’s work 
with allies to provide our democratic 
brothers and sisters in Ukraine what 
they actually need to protect their 
homeland and to defend democracy. 
I yield the floor. 
RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY LEADER 
The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. HAS-
SAN). The majority leader is recog-
nized. 
GUN LEGISLATION 
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, 
earlier this evening, Democratic and 
Republican 
negotiators 
finally 
re-
leased, after a lot of hard work, a bi-
partisan gun safety bill. 
This bipartisan gun safety legislation 
is progress and will save lives. While it 
is not everything we want, this legisla-
tion is urgently needed. As the author 
of the Brady background checks bill, 
which passed in 1994, I am pleased that 
for the first time in nearly 30 years, 
Congress is back on the path to take 
meaningful action to address gun vio-
lence. 
I will now take the first steps to 
move this lifesaving legislation on the 
Senate floor for a vote, with an initial 
procedural 
vote 
tonight. 
Following 
that, we will move to final passage as 
soon as possible. I expect the bill to 
pass the Senate by the week’s end. 
I want to commend all of my col-
leagues—so many who worked so hard 
on this bill—for their diligent and as-
tute efforts to finalize this legislation. 
I want to particularly single out Sen-
ators MURPHY, SINEMA, CORNYN, and 
TILLIS, who really led the charge to put 
this together.

MORNING BUSINESS 
ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS 
TRIBUTE TO ETANA MORSE 
∑ Mr. BOOZMAN. Mr. President, I rise 
today to recognize Etana Morse from 
West Fork, AR, for earning the Con-
gressional Award Gold Medal. 
Created by Congress in 1979, the Con-
gressional Award recognizes initiative, 
service, and achievement in young peo-
ple. Participants earn bronze, silver, 
and gold certificates and medals by set-
ting specific goals in different program 
areas. Gold medal awardees must com-
plete at least 400 hours of voluntary 
public service, 200 hours of personal de-
velopment activities, 200 hours of phys-
ical fitness activities, and one 5-day/4- 
night expedition to a destination to ex-
perience a new environment or culture. 
This program brings together some of 
our Nation’s most dedicated and ambi-
tious youth leaders, like Etana, who 
show a commitment to public service. 
An outstanding student at Haas Hall 
Academy, Etana excels both in and out 
of the classroom. 
She serves as member of the Wash-
ington County 4–H Youth Development 
Club and vice president of the teen ad-
visory board. Etana is also the founder 
of the Washington County Youth Advo-
cates for a Drug-Free Tomorrow Club. 
She volunteers in her community with 
multiple organizations including the 
M&N 
Augustine 
Foundation, 
NWA 
Food Bank, and the Salvation Army. 
Along with her sister, she launched the 
‘‘Taste to Serve’’ fundraiser campaign 
to raise money for a nonprofit organi-
zation for human development and is 
eager to continue her academic pur-
suits by studying statistics and data 
science when she starts college. 
Etana has accomplished a lot to earn 
this award. I congratulate her for her 
determination, dedication, and service 
and applaud her growth as a leader. I 
am confident her exemplary work ethic 
and desire to make her community a 
better place will serve her well in her 
future endeavors.∑ 
f 
RECOGNIZING THE ADVOCACY OF 
PULP AND PAPERWORKERS’ RE-
SOURCE COUNCIL 
∑ Mr. BOOZMAN. Mr. President, I rise 
today to recognize the Pulp and Paper-
workers’ Resource Council—PPRC—for 
more than three decades of advocacy 
for forest products. 
The PPRC is a grassroots organiza-
tion made up of hourly employees of 
the 
U.S. 
forest 
products 
industry. 
PPRC members work in mills and con-
verting plants where they manufacture 
sustainable paper and wood products 
that are among the most used, nec-
essary and recycled items Americans 
rely on every day. 
The U.S. forest products industry is 
vitally important to our Nation’s econ-
omy, employing approximately 950,000 
people. The industry is among the top 
10 manufacturing sector employers in 
45 States, supporting family-wage jobs 
and manufacturing nearly $300 billion 
in products annually. In my home 
State of Arkansas, we have more than 
24,000 people directly employed in the 
industry. 
Founded in 1991, the PPRC works to 
ensure that real-world perspectives are 
considered in all policy and regulatory 
decisions that impact their jobs and 
communities. As cochair of the Senate 
Paper and Packaging Caucus, I work to 
inform members of Congress about the 
value of the paper and packaging in-
dustry in their States and districts. 
This bipartisan, bicameral caucus high-
lights the importance and economic 
significance of the paper and packaging 
industry and focuses on the policy so-
lutions needed to sustain and promote 
this important sector. I am honored to 
meet with PPRC representatives every 
year when they come to Washington to 
advocate for their priorities. 
I am pleased to congratulate the 
PPRC today for more than 30 years of 
hard work on behalf of such an essen-
tial U.S. industry.∑

S3033 
June 21, 2022 
Mr. VAN HOLLEN, Mrs. FEINSTEIN, Mr. 
WARNOCK, Mr. HICKENLOOPER, Ms. KLO-
BUCHAR, Mr. WYDEN, Mr. COONS, Mr. 
PADILLA, Mr. MERKLEY, Mr. CARDIN, 
Mrs. MURRAY, Ms. HIRONO, Ms. SMITH, 
and Mr. BOOKER) submitted the fol-
lowing resolution; which was referred 
to the Committee on Foreign Rela-
tions: 
S. RES. 684 
Whereas June 20, 2022, is observed as 
‘‘World Refugee Day’’, a global event to 
honor refugees around the globe and cele-
brate the strengths and courage of people 
who have been forced to flee their home 
country to escape conflict or persecution due 
to their race, religion, nationality, political 
opinion, or membership in a particular social 
group; 
Whereas July 28, 2022, is the 71st anniver-
sary of the signing of the Convention Relat-
ing to the Status of Refugees, done at Gene-
va July 28, 1951 (and made applicable by the 
Protocol Relating to the Status of Refugees, 
done at New York January 31, 1967 (19 UST 
6223)), which defines the term ‘‘refugee’’ and 
outlines the rights of refugees and the legal 
obligations of states to protect them; 
Whereas, in 2022, according to the United 
Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (re-
ferred to in this preamble as ″UNHCR″)— 
(1) there are more than 100,000,000 displaced 
people who have been forced from their 
homes worldwide, more displaced people 
than ever before in recorded history, includ-
ing more than 27,100,000 refugees and at least 
53,200,000 internally displaced people, as of 
the end of 2021; 
(2) 69 percent of the world’s refugees came 
from Syria, Venezuela, Afghanistan, South 
Sudan, or Burma; 
(3) there have been more than 7,500,000 bor-
der crossings from Ukraine since February 
24, 
2022; 
nearly 
5,000,000 
refugees 
from 
Ukraine have been recorded across Europe as 
of June 9, 2022; and nearly 12,800,000 people 
were internally displaced in Ukraine as of 
May 5, 2022; 
(4) there are an estimated 2,700,000 reg-
istered Afghan refugees in the world, of 
whom nearly 2,100,000 are registered in Iran 
or Pakistan, in addition to another 3,500,000 
Afghans who are internally displaced, having 
fled their homes searching for refuge within 
the country; 
(5) more than 50 percent of the population 
of Syria (at least 13,500,000 people) have been 
displaced since the start of the conflict, ei-
ther across the international border or with-
in Syria, representing the largest displace-
ment crisis in the world today; 
(6) 1 out of every 4 people of concern to 
UNHCR lives in the Americas, which rep-
resents an increase from 1 out of every 6 in 
2018; 
(7) more than 6,000,000 Venezuelans have 
left their home country since 2014, rep-
resenting the largest exodus in Latin Amer-
ica’s recent history and one of the largest 
displacement crises in the world; 
(8) children account for 31 percent of the 
world’s population and 41 percent of all forc-
ibly displaced people, millions of whom are 
unable to access basic services, including 
education; and 
(9) 83 percent of all refugees are hosted by 
developing nations and fewer than 1 percent 
of vulnerable refugees in need of resettle-
ment have had the opportunity due to lack 
of resettlement places; 
Whereas 
thousands 
of 
our 
immigrant 
neighbors in the United States, including 
people from Ethiopia, Cameroon, Haiti, Mau-
ritania, and South Sudan, face harm if de-
ported to their home countries due to violent 
crime and political instability; 
Whereas refugees are major contributors to 
local economies and serve as critical front-
line healthcare professionals and essential 
workers combating the COVID–19 pandemic 
worldwide; 
Whereas welcoming the oppressed and per-
secuted is a core tenet of our great Nation, 
and the United States is home to a diverse 
population of refugees and immigrants who 
have added to the economic strengths and 
cultural richness of our communities; 
Whereas, consistent with domestic and 
international law, all foreign nationals ar-
riving in the United States, regardless of 
their nationality, must be given an oppor-
tunity to seek asylum; 
Whereas the United States must restore a 
humane and functioning asylum system in 
order to meet its obligations under domestic 
and international law with respect to those 
fleeing persecution; 
Whereas the United States supports the 
UNHCR in its efforts to increase protection 
for LGBTQI+ refugees overseas and to sup-
port their global resettlement; 
Whereas the United States Refugee Admis-
sions Program, which was established in 
1980, is a lifesaving pillar of global humani-
tarian efforts, advances United States for-
eign policy goals, and supports regional host 
countries; 
Whereas resettlement is an essential part 
of a comprehensive strategy to respond to 
refugee crises, promote responsibility shar-
ing, and strengthen United States national 
security by ensuring access to legal migra-
tion pathways; 
Whereas the infrastructure for the United 
States refugee resettlement pipeline has 
been dismantled, limiting access to the 
United States Refugee Admissions Program 
globally, 
Whereas for the first time in recent his-
tory, following the destruction of the United 
States refugee resettlement pipeline, large 
numbers of desperate migrants from as far as 
Cameroon and Ukraine have sought refuge 
from persecution at the United States border 
with Mexico; 
Whereas in fiscal year 2021, the United 
States only settled 11,500 refugees, the low-
est figure since the passage of the Refugee 
Act of 1980, and as of May 31, 2022, the United 
States had only resettled 12,641 refugees in 
fiscal year 2022; 
Whereas during the first 8 months of fiscal 
year 2022, only 5,070 refugees were admitted 
from Africa, only 1,296 refugees were admit-
ted from Latin America and the Caribbean, 
and only 1,060 refugees were admitted from 
East Asia; 
Whereas resettlement organizations and 
other community and faith-based groups 
offer support for refugees who resettle in the 
United States; 
Whereas resettlement to the United States 
is available for the most vulnerable refugees 
who undergo rigorous security vetting and 
medical screening processing; 
Whereas, 
according 
to 
New 
American 
Economy, refugees contributed an estimated 
$269,100,000,000 to the national economy be-
tween 2005 and 2014, far surpassing the 
$206,100,000,000 spent by the United States to 
assist refugees during that period; and 
Whereas refugees integrate and quickly be-
come self-sufficient by paying taxes, sup-
porting local commerce, joining the work-
force, and creating jobs: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) reaffirms the bipartisan commitment of 
the United States to promote the safety, 
health, and well-being of millions of refugees 
and asylum seekers, including the education 
of refugee children and displaced persons 
who flee war, persecution, or torture in 
search of protection, peace, hope, and free-
dom; 
(2) recognizes those individuals who have 
risked their lives working, either individ-
ually or for nongovernmental organizations 
and international agencies, such as the 
United Nations High Commissioner for Refu-
gees (referred to in this resolution as 
‘‘UNHCR’’), to provide lifesaving assistance 
and protection for people displaced around 
the world; 
(3) reaffirms the imperative to fully re-
store United States asylum protections by 
terminating policies that deny access to asy-
lum or externalize our asylum obligations; 
(4) underscores the need for the United 
States Government to fully rebuild our Na-
tion’s refugee resettlement infrastructure in 
order to strengthen national and regional se-
curity and encourage international soli-
darity with host countries; and 
(5) calls upon the Secretary of State, Sec-
retary of Homeland Security, and the United 
States Ambassador to the United Nations— 
(A) to continue providing robust funding 
for refugee protection overseas and resettle-
ment in the United States; 
(B) to revive the United States’ inter-
national leadership role in responding to dis-
placement crises with humanitarian assist-
ance, and restore its leadership role in the 
protection of vulnerable refugee populations 
that endure gender based violence, human 
trafficking, 
persecution, 
and 
violence 
against religious minorities, forced conscrip-
tion, genocide, and exploitation; 
(C) to work in partnership with the inter-
national community to find solutions to ex-
isting conflicts and prevent new conflicts 
from beginning; 
(D) to continue supporting the efforts of 
the UNHCR and advance the work of non-
governmental organizations to protect refu-
gees and asylum seekers regardless of their 
country of origin, race, ethnicity, or reli-
gious beliefs; 
(E) to continue to alleviate pressures on 
frontline refugee host countries that absorb 
the majority of the world’s refugees through 
humanitarian and development aid; 
(F) to respond to the global refugee crisis 
by meeting robust refugee admissions goals; 
and 
(G) to reaffirm the goals of ″World Refugee 
Day″ and reiterate the United States’ strong 
commitment to protect refugees and asylum 
seekers who live without material, social, or 
legal protections.

submitted the following resolution; 
which was considered and agreed to: 
S. RES. 685 
Whereas the United Nations Office on 
Drugs and Crime (referred to in this pre-
amble 
as 
‘‘UNODC’’) 
estimated 
that 
275,000,000 
individuals 
used 
illicit 
drugs 
worldwide in 2019, a 22 percent increase from

Whereas UNODC estimated that, globally, 
36,300,000 individuals suffered from substance 
use disorders in 2019; 
Whereas the Substance Abuse and Mental 
Health Administration reported that, in 2020, 
37,300,000 individuals aged 12 or older had 
used an illicit drug in the United States in

Whereas the Centers for Disease Control 
and Prevention (referred to in this preamble 
as ‘‘CDC’’) estimated that more than 107,000 
individuals died from drug overdoses in 2021; 
Whereas, according to the CDC, synthetic

amine, are among the primary drivers of 
overdose deaths in the United States; 
Whereas CDC data indicates that drug 
overdose deaths have accelerated during the

the United States $193,000,000,000 annually in 
healthcare costs, crime, and lost produc-
tivity; 
Whereas the Drug Enforcement Adminis-
tration reports that drug trafficking fuels 
the drug overdose epidemic in the United 
States and can lead to violence in commu-
nities throughout the country and the world; 
Whereas the Department of State reports 
that the illicit drug trade can undermine the 
rule-of-law and fuel corruption; and 
Whereas the United Nations General As-
sembly established June 26 as the ‘‘Inter-

Trafficking’’: Now, therefore, be it

opposed to other intents, such as improving 
or liquidating a personal firearms collection: 
Provided, That proof of profit shall not be re-
quired as to a person who engages in the reg-
ular and repetitive purchase and disposition 
of firearms for criminal purposes or ter-
rorism. For purposes of this paragraph, the 
term ‘terrorism’ means activity, directed 
against United States persons, which— 
‘‘(A) is committed by an individual who is

gerous to human life which would be a crimi-

(a) BYRNE JAG PROGRAM.—Section 501(a)(1) 
of title I of the Omnibus Crime Control and 
Safe Streets Act of 1968 (34 U.S.C. 10152(a)(1)) 
is amended—

(A), by inserting ‘‘or civil proceedings’’ after 
‘‘criminal justice’’; and 
(2) by adding at the end the following: 
‘‘(I) Implementation of State crisis inter-
vention court proceedings and related pro-
grams or initiatives, including but not lim-
ited to— 
‘‘(i) mental health courts; 
‘‘(ii) drug courts; 
‘‘(iii) veterans courts; and 
‘‘(iv) extreme risk protection order pro-
grams, which must include, at a minimum— 
‘‘(I) pre-deprivation and post-deprivation 
due process rights that prevent any violation 
or infringement of the Constitution of the 
United States, including but not limited to 
the Bill of Rights, and the substantive or 
procedural due process rights guaranteed 
under the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments 
to the Constitution of the United States, as 
applied to the States, and as interpreted by 
State courts and United States courts (in-
cluding the Supreme Court of the United 
States). Such programs must include, at the 
appropriate phase to prevent any violation of 
constitutional rights, at minimum, notice, 
the right to an in-person hearing, an unbi-
ased adjudicator, the right to know opposing 
evidence, the right to present evidence, and 
the right to confront adverse witnesses; 
‘‘(II) the right to be represented by counsel 
at no expense to the government; 
‘‘(III) pre-deprivation and post-deprivation 
heightened evidentiary standards and proof 
which mean not less than the protections af-
forded to a similarly situated litigant in 
Federal court or promulgated by the State’s 
evidentiary body, and sufficient to ensure 
the full protections of the Constitution of 
the United States, including but not limited 
to the Bill of Rights, and the substantive and 
procedural due process rights guaranteed 
under the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments 
to the Constitution of the United States, as 
applied to the States, and as interpreted by 
State courts and United States courts (in-
cluding the Supreme Court of the United 
States). The heightened evidentiary stand-
ards and proof under such programs must, at 
all appropriate phases to prevent any viola-
tion of any constitutional right, at min-
imum, prevent reliance upon evidence that is 
unsworn or unaffirmed, irrelevant, based on 
inadmissible 
hearsay, 
unreliable, 
vague, 
speculative, and lacking a foundation; and 
‘‘(IV) penalties for abuse of the program.’’.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks
E645 
June 21, 2022 
IN RECOGNITION OF THE RETIRE-
MENT OF NANCY MILLIKEN, MD 
HON. NANCY PELOSI 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, June 21, 2022 
Ms. PELOSI. Madam Speaker, I rise, along-
side Congresswoman JACKIE SPEIER, to recog-
nize the outstanding service and trailblazing 
career of Dr. Nancy Milliken in celebration of 
her well-earned retirement. As the Founding 
Director of the National Center of Excellence 
in Women’s Health at the University of Cali-
fornia, San Francisco, Dr. Milliken has touched 
the lives of women in San Francisco and 
across the nation. Her long and storied career 
has been defined by selfless service and un-
wavering devotion to the dignity of every pa-
tient. 
Educated at Harvard University and Duke 
University Medical School, Dr. Milliken began 
her career facing indifference toward and 
underinvestment in women’s health—among 
those in the medical field and in society at 
large. Equipped with a sharp intellect and a 
lifelong talent for speaking truth to power, she 
made it her mission to build a fairer, healthier 
future for women and girls. 
In 1996, she helped UCSF establish one of 
the nation’s first centers of excellence in wom-
en’s health, spearheading efforts to strengthen 
medical training through clinical care, edu-
cation, research, community engagement and 
leadership. These efforts continue to have a 
daily impact on the health of local women, in-
cluding through the coordinated care provided 
at two clinics in San Francisco. 
Under Dr. Milliken’s leadership, the Center 
has also worked with community organizations 
across the country to open doors to quality, af-
fordable health care. Partnering with a school 
district in Jackson, Mississippi, the Center 
helped provide education and physical activity 
programs to local students and residents. And 
in Grand Forks, North Dakota, it worked with 
a local clinic to provide critical resources for 
survivors of intimate partner violence. 
Among her peers, Dr. Milliken is renowned 
for her courage and resilience. While orga-
nizing a conference with other centers of ex-
cellence, she led the charge to host practi-
tioner workshops covering topics viewed by 
some as taboo, including abortion and lesbian 
health. In the face of much resistance, she 
successfully fought to ensure that attendees 
could access comprehensive educational ses-
sions on these important subjects. 
Always looking to the future, she has also 
worked to prepare the next generation of 
women’s health practitioners. In partnership 
with Congresswoman SPEIER, Dr. Milliken has 
helped educate more than 10,000 high school 
students through the Young Women’s Health 
and Leadership Summit—an annual event or-
ganized by and for the young women of San 
Francisco. 
Rarely seeking the spotlight, Dr. Milliken is 
more interested in her long-term impact than 
accolades or titles. She readily shares credit 
and eagerly mentors those seeking to follow in 
her footsteps. Yet her remarkable achieve-
ments have been recognized by an array of 
professional and community organizations, in-
cluding the Academy of Women’s Health, the 
Friends of the Commission on the Status of 
Women and the Hunters Point Family. 
Right now, women across our country are 
bracing for a Supreme Court decision that will 
dramatically restrict our Constitutional rights 
and health freedoms. As we confront this chal-
lenge, our nation is blessed by the warriors 
trained by Dr. Milliken, who are prepared to 
defend the health and welfare of American 
women. 
Congress and the Country salute the com-
mitted service of this brilliant researcher, doc-
tor, leader and friend, and we wish her all the 
best as she prepares for a deeply deserved 
retirement.

MATTHEW MARKEE 
HON. JEFFERSON VAN DREW 
OF NEW JERSEY 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, June 21, 2022 
Mr. VAN DREW. Madam Speaker, this 
month, I had the honor of attending Matthew 
Markee’s Eagle Scout Court of Honor cere-
mony. Matthew graduated from Cape May 
County Technical High School and obtained 
his Eagle Scout ranking as a part of Troop 65 
in Cape May Court House. For his Eagle 
Scout project, Matthew restored the Cape May 
County Park South pavilion in Villas, South 
Jersey. Before Matthew’s project, the pavilion 
had paint peeling off and a leaking roof. To 
remedy the issue, Matthew removed the old 
tar paper and roof shingles from the pavilion 
and replaced them himself. He also painted 
and cleaned up the pavilion, restoring it to 
original condition. Matthew completed the re-
pairs, gained the funding for the project, and 
recruited volunteers for the project on his own. 
He should be very proud of his service to 
South Jersey and Park South, and I wish him 
the best of luck in his future endeavors. God 
Bless Matthew, and God Bless our United 
States of America.

HONORING ALCOA MASSENA OPER-
ATIONS ON THEIR 120TH ANNI-
VERSARY 
HON. ELISE M. STEFANIK 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, June 21, 2022 
Ms. STEFANIK. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today 
to 
honor 
and 
congratulate 
Alcoa 
Massena Operations on 120 years of success-
ful operations in Massena. The abundant hy-
droelectric energy supply in Massena drew 
Alcoa to the location in 1902 and, since then, 
the facility has become an integral part of the 
community. 
Alcoa Massena Operations is a great exam-
ple of a facility focused on innovation and 
modernization. One hundred and twenty years 
ago in Massena, New York, Alcoa broke 
ground on what is now the world’s oldest con-
tinuously operating smelter and has been fo-
cused on revolutionizing the aluminum indus-
try by helping their customers develop more 
sustainable solutions. 
The Alcoa Massena plant is comprised of 
198 pre-brake lines, making it one of the larg-
est and most automated potlines in the indus-
try. Alcoa Massena Operations can produce 
an incredible 800,000 pounds of aluminum 
every single day. In addition to smelting, the 
plant uses the melted aluminum to produce 
over sixty different alloys and rolling aluminum 
rods for customer shipment. Alcoa Massena 
Operations 
provides 
over 
550 
jobs 
for 
Massena community members, making an im-
portant element of the dynamic North Country 
economy. 
The jobs and services provided by this plant 
are integral to the vitality of Massena and the 
entirety of the North Country. On behalf of 
New York’s 21st District, it is my honor to con-
gratulate Alcoa Massena Operations on one 
hundred and twenty years of continuous serv-
ice. We thank them for all they provide to our 
community.

Mrs. Ruth Bridgeforth Lester. 
Mrs. Ruth Bridgeforth Lester was born in 
Southaven Mississippi to Mr. Gedie and Mrs. 
Willie Ruth McGowan Bridgeforth on Novem-
ber 17, 1938. She was 13 years old when her 
mother passed away and she began her life-
long journey as family Matriarch. With eight 
younger sisters and brothers she remained 
devoted and committed to taking care of fam-
ily members. As the eldest, she made many 
sacrifices to help support the family and help 
her father Gedie raise her siblings. 
Those early experiences prepared her for 
life as a businesswoman. She faced many ob-
stacles planning for business administration 
and ownership, but her past experiences em-
phasized vision, commitment, and a capacity 
to serve and honor others. Ms. Lester had 
learned to overcome any fears, erasing any 
and all doubts, and ‘‘bridging forth’’ to new en-
deavors. Thus, Ms. Lester became the proud 
owner of The Final Touch, the first nail salon, 
in Memphis, TN. She and her business part-
ner opened the nail salon in October 1972. 
Ms. Lester continues to give, serve, and 
create capacity throughout her family and the

community she lives in and works in across 
the states of Mississippi and Tennessee. She 
is well known for her savory and healthy 
meals, even giving food to strangers. No one 
goes hungry around her. She has been and 
continues to be the unbeatable family cook for 
over 70 years. 
Ruth has lived in the Desoto County area 
and has been a contributing citizen for at least 
65 years of her life. As a matter of fact, the 
home that she currently lives in was the last 
home that her father Gedie built, and where 
she and her siblings were born.

HON. JEFFERSON VAN DREW 
OF NEW JERSEY 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, June 21, 2022 
Mr. VAN DREW. Madam Speaker, last Sun-
day, I had the honor of attending the Olympiad 
at Beth Israel congregation in remembrance of 
the 50-year anniversary of the Munich mas-
sacre. Jacob Lewis was nominated to receive 
the Olympiad Student Athlete Award at the 
event. Jacob is the Valedictorian of Millville 
High School’s Class of 2022, which has a total 
of 378 students. As well as excelling in aca-
demics, he is also involved in many extra-cur-
ricular activities. Jacob is a student-athlete 
who earned eight varsity letters on both the 
boys’ soccer and tennis teams. In the fall, he 
will continue his academic and athletic careers 
at the University of Pennsylvania. Jacob 
should be very proud of all his accomplish-
ments, and I wish him the best of luck in all 
his future endeavors. God Bless Jacob, and 
God Bless our United States of America.

RECOGNIZING JAIME SHIMEK ON 
HER DEPARTURE 
HON. ROSA L. DeLAURO 
OF CONNECTICUT 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, June 21, 2022 
Ms. DELAURO. Madam Speaker, I rise as 
Chair of the Appropriations Committee, and on 
behalf of the Members of the Committee and 
its staff, to pay tribute to Jaime Shimek after 
her nearly 20 years of Federal service. 
Hailing 
from 
Washington 
State, 
Jaime 
began her career as an intern for Representa-
tive Norm Dicks and as a staffer for Senator 
MARIA CANTWELL. She then served as Wash-
ington Senator PATTY MURRAY’s Senior Policy 
Advisor for eight years, handling the appro-
priations and energy, agriculture, and water 
portfolios. Jaime left Congress; moving over to 
the Department of Energy where she served 
as the Deputy Assistant Secretary for Senate 
Affairs before serving as the Director of Fed-
eral Affairs at the Pacific Northwest National 
Laboratory. 
She then came back to Congress and 
joined the Appropriations Committee, where 
she has served for the past five years, includ-
ing as Clerk of the Energy and Water Devel-
opment Subcommittee since 2017. 
Madam Speaker, during her time with Ap-
propriations, Jaime has been an invaluable 
asset to the Members of the Committee and 
myself. She has a profound technical under-
standing of the full scope of the Subcommit-
tee’s jurisdiction, ranging from water infrastruc-
ture projects across the country to nuclear 
weapons to energy and science programs. 
She has been at the helm of the responsible 
investments we have made in the past several 
years to strengthen our energy independence, 
diversify our energy sources, fight climate 
change, rebuild our water infrastructure, and 
create green jobs. 
I know I do not just speak for myself when 
I say we will miss Jaime greatly on this team. 
Jaime’s hard work and her dedication to the 
Appropriations Committee and Congress have 
made her an incredible asset. I look forward to 
her future endeavors in her home state of 
Washington at a Department of Energy na-
tional lab and congratulate her on her career. 
The Appropriations Committee, and our entire 
Nation are indebted to Jaime and grateful for 
her service.

ture Committee regarding H.R. 2020, the 
‘‘Post-Disaster Assistance Online Account-
ability Act,’’ sponsored by Representative

HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, 
COMMITTEE ON FINANCIAL SERVICES, 
Washington, DC, June 21, 2022. 
Hon. PETER A. DEFAZIO, 
Chairman, House Committee on Transportation 
and Infrastructure, Washington, DC. 
DEAR
CHAIRMAN
DEFAZIO: I write con-
cerning H.R. 2020, the ‘‘Post-Disaster Assist-
ance Online Accountability Act,’’ sponsored 
by Representative Gonza´lez-Colo´n. The Fi-
nancial Services Committee received an ad-
ditional referral on this bill but has not for-
mally foregone any further consideration of 
the bill because we were unfortunately not 
given sufficient time to review it prior to it 
being brought to the floor on suspension. 
While I support the apparent purpose of this 
legislation, I am concerned that the Depart-
ment of Housing and Urban Development 
(HUD) and the Federal Emergency Manage-
ment Agency (FEMA) have not been con-
sulted for their opinion or technical drafting 
assistance on this legislation when they will 
play key roles in implementing this bill. 
I have shared the text of this legislation 
with both HUD and FEMA and requested 
their input. I would appreciate your coopera-
tion in addressing any concerns from these 
agencies and integrating any technical draft-
ing changes they suggest as you work to 
move this bill in the Senate. My staff will be 
in touch as they receive feedback from these 
agencies. 
I will be submitting a copy of this letter in 
the Congressional Record and I look forward 
to working with you on this and other issues 
where our Committees cross paths. 
Sincerely, 
MAXINE WATERS, 
Chairwoman. 
IRENE JACOBSON 
HON. JEFFERSON VAN DREW 
OF NEW JERSEY 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, June 21, 2022 
Mr. VAN DREW. Madam Speaker, last 
month, I had the pleasure of attending Irene 
Jacobson’s 105th birthday celebration. Irene 
was born in April of 1917 in Boston, Massa-
chusetts. After completing secretarial courses 
at Boston schools, she began her career as a 
secretary. Then, in 1937, Irene was set up on 
a blind date where she met her husband, 
Simon. In June of 1939, Irene and Simon got 
married and eventually had three children. 
During her time as a stay-at-home mom, Irene 
began her first volunteer effort where she 
worked on John F. Kennedy’s first political 
campaign. In 1961, Irene and Simon moved 
their family to Vineland, South Jersey, where 
they made many friends, were actively in-
volved in their synagogue, and generously 
contributed to the South Jersey community. In 
2010, Irene won the Nutrition Award through 
my Joint Legislative Commendation efforts 
during my time in the New Jersey State Sen-
ate. Additionally, in 2017, she was recognized 
by the Cumberland County Freeholders for her 
service. Currently, Irene is a member of The 
Sons of Jacob Synagogue in Vineland and the 
Alliance Synagogue in Norma. She also en-
joys spending time with family, reading, watch-
ing movies, and word puzzles. Irene should be 
proud of her service to the South Jersey com-
munity, and it was my honor to have had the 
opportunity to attend her birthday celebration. 
God Bless Irene, and God Bless our United 
States of America.

FEDERAL RESERVE RACIAL AND 
ECONOMIC EQUITY ACT 
SPEECH OF 
HON. PETE AGUILAR 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, June 15, 2022 
Mr. AGUILAR. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support 
of H.R. 2543 and thank Chairwoman WATERS 
for assembling this legislation. 
I would like to highlight a critical provision of 
the bill, the Expanding Financial Access for 
Underserved Communities Act. As a former 
employee of a credit union, I understand that 
joining a credit union can provide Americans 
with invaluable financial opportunities. 
However, unlike other depository institutions 
and financial services providers, not everyone 
in America can join a credit union. The Chair-
woman’s bill, and this package, help to miti-
gate that issue by allowing federally chartered 
credit unions the opportunity to apply to pro-
vide services for low-income, underserved and 
rural communities, where financial services 
are unfortunately limited to a payday lender or 
pawnshop. Nothing in this bill precludes any 
other financial services provider from serving 
these communities, and credit unions should 
not be restricted either. 
I have seen firsthand the affordable and de-
pendable services credit unions provide, and 
how they exist to change the lives of their 
members. Let us continue to work together to 
bring more common-sense solutions to Amer-
ica’s unbanked.

HONORING 
DEBORAH 
‘‘DEBBIE’’ 
BEAHAN FOR HER DEDICATION 
IN SERVING HUDSON FALLS 
HON. ELISE M. STEFANIK 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, June 21, 2022 
Ms. STEFANIK. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor Deborah ‘‘Debbie’’ Beahan for 
her years of service to the Hudson Falls com-
munity. Debbie spent much of her professional 
life working for Washington County and volun-
teering for several community organizations. 
Her dedication to her work and community has 
made a profound impact on Hudson Falls. 
Debbie was born and raised in Ticonderoga, 
New York and 1974, she moved to Hudson 
Falls. She worked for Washington County for 
32 years. For 20 years, she worked for the 
Department of Motor Vehicles, which honored 
her in 1999 for her contributions to the com-
munity. After her time at the Department of 
Motor Vehicles, Debbie worked in the County 
Clerk office, serving as Deputy Clerk for 8 
years and as County Clerk for 4 years. 
In addition to her career in public service, 
Debbie has volunteered at the Senior Center 
of the Kingsbury & Fort Edward Area, Inc. for 
the past 9 years. She is the president of the 
board of directors at the center and is a vital 
part of their daily operations. During the pan-
demic, Debbie’s work was especially critical, 
as she made sure the members were kept up 
to date on all pressing matters related to 
COVID–19. She also helped to install the ‘‘My 
Senior Center’’ software program that reports 
membership, personnel, events, meals, and 
transportation statistics for the center. 
Debbie got her start as a volunteer with the 
Special Olympics in the 1980s as a bowling 
and track and field coach. She also served as 
treasurer of the Washington County Repub-
lican Committee Women’s Club, was involved 
with the heart fund, and participates in the 
Public Health Committee for employees. Due 
to all her years of hard work and dedication, 
it is no surprise that Washington County is 
honoring Debbie for her incredible service as 
a part of Older Americans Month. On behalf of 
New York’s 21st District, I thank Debbie for 
her dedication to the Hudson Falls community 
and wish her all the best in future endeavors.

HONORING 
THE 
100TH 
ANNIVER-
SARY 
OF 
AMERICAN 
LEGION 
KARL ROSS POST 16 
HON. JERRY McNERNEY 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, June 21, 2022 
Mr. MCNERNEY. Madam Speaker, I ask my 
colleagues to join me in recognizing the Amer-
ican Legion Karl Ross Post 16 in Stockton, 
California on the 100th anniversary of its 
founding. 
For the last century, the Karl Ross Post has 
provided assistance and fellowship to Stock-
ton’s many veterans and promoted patriotism 
in the community at-large. Their Honor Guard 
has marked the interment of many veterans 
with the dignity and ceremony they deserve— 
helping their families and our community to 
recognize their contributions to our peace, 
freedom, and security. 
Through the ceremonies the Karl Ross Post 
organizes—often in conjunction with other vet-
erans’ organizations—our community remem-
bers and recognizes the sacrifices veterans 
have made, and better appreciates the bless-
ings of the liberties and freedoms that we hold 
dear. 
Along with the strong role the Karl Ross 
Post has played locally, it has also had a na-
tional reach. Every American veteran has 
been touched by the efforts of Warren Ath-
erton, who rose from Commander of the Karl 
Ross Post to National Commander of the 
American Legion, where he worked with 
Francis Sullivan to draft the G.I. Bill of Rights. 
Today, the Karl Ross Post and its members 
continue their tradition of promoting patriotism 
and assisting a new generation of combat vet-
erans as they re-enter civilian life. 
I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring 
the American Legion Karl Ross Post 16 and 
its century of service to our veterans, our com-
munity, and our Nation.

DAWSON MOORE 
HON. JEFFERSON VAN DREW

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, June 21, 2022 
Mr. VAN DREW. Madam Speaker, this 
month, I had the honor of attending Dawson 
Moore’s Eagle Scout Court of Honor cere-
mony. Dawson graduated from Middle Town-
ship High School last year and is a part of 
Cape May Court House’s Troop 65. For his 
Eagle Scout project, he refurbished the Go-
shen Therapeutic riding ring at the Cape May 
County equestrian facility, which allows partici-
pants to experience the benefits of horseback 
riding while working on their own personal 
challenges. Dawson replaced the fencing 
around the riding ring, which was in desperate 
need of repair. He should be proud of his 
project, and it was my honor to recognize him 
for his service to the South Jersey community. 
I wish Dawson the best of luck on his future 
endeavors. God Bless Dawson, and God 
Bless our United States of America.

HONORING THE PUBLIC SERVICE 
OF JON BOUGHTIN 
HON. DEREK KILMER 
OF WASHINGTON 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, June 21, 2022 
Mr. KILMER. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to speak on behalf of Jon Boughtin, an excep-
tional staffer and someone I’m proud to have 
called a partner. 
Jon was the very first Director of Member 
Services for the New Democrat Coalition. In 
this role, he worked every day to build a 
strong coalition made up of effective members 
of Congress. His work demonstrated a com-
mitment to getting good things done for the 
American people—and to helping every mem-
ber of our coalition do that too. Beyond that, 
Jon fostered a community of leaders that re-
sembled a family more than a caucus. I con-
sider myself lucky that he held the role during 
my Chairmanship of the Coalition. 
We talk a lot in the New Dems about deliv-
ering for Americans and getting results in Con-
gress. But that doesn’t just happen. It takes 
hard work and a commitment to do the tough 
work of finding common ground. That’s what 
Jon’s all about. He always challenged the New 
Dems to keep the concerns of our friends and 
families back home front and center. His dedi-
cated work to provide resources to our mem-
bers and staff empowered our members to 
make a real, tangible difference on a host of 
issues—from inflation to workforce develop-
ment. I knew I could always turn to Jon for 
candid advice, smart analysis, and creative 
solutions. His sense of humor wasn’t half bad 
either. 
For Jon, working for the New Dems wasn’t 
just a paycheck. It was a mission. And thanks 
to him, our Coalition has never been stronger. 
Though I’m sad to see him go, I wish him luck 
in his new role. To Jon—as well as to his fam-
ily, from whom we borrowed Jon on many late 
nights and weekends—I offer my congratula-
tions, my best wishes, and my sincere thanks 
for years of service.

ACHIEVEMENTS 
OF KEITH MOSKOWITZ 
HON. BILL POSEY 
OF FLORIDA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, June 21, 2022 
Mr. POSEY. Madam Speaker, I rise to rec-
ognize Mr. Keith Moskowitz from Vero Beach, 
Florida, a constituent who has earned distinc-
tion for his dedication to ensuring safe com-
munities and for his commitment to making a 
difference in the lives of others by investing in 
people and creating opportunity. 
Keith started his first job when he was only 
eight years old and since then has worked 
hard and owned many businesses. Being 
called to serve others, Keith put his busi-
nesses on hold and joined the New York City 
Police Department. Over the course of his 15- 
years of service Keith received over 60 
awards for his excellent police work, including 
meritorious and bravery medals. He earned 
two promotions and led an investigative squad 
focusing on domestic violence, burglary, and 
homicides. On September 11, 2001, Keith was 
on duty in downtown Manhattan when the 
Trade Center was attacked and worked tire-
lessly to assist people in getting to safety. 
In June 2006 Keith retired from the NYPD 
and relocated to Florida where he once again 
joined the private sector building a string of 
successful small businesses in the automotive 
and home repair industries which he grew to 
include more than 20 employees. Keith’s phil-
anthropic nature has benefited his community 
as he has given much of his time and re-
sources to local schools, local governments, 
and people in needed of assistance. 
Recognized by the governor of Kentucky, 
Keith was awarded the distinguished Kentucky 
Colonel designation for his continued invest-
ments in people and the communities in which 
he has served. I ask my colleagues to join me 
in recognizing Keith Moskowitz for his dedica-
tion to community service, courageous acts, 
and generous spirit.

Mr. VAN DREW. Madam Speaker, last Sun-
day, I had the honor of attending the Olympiad 
at Beth Israel congregation in remembrance of 
the 50-year anniversary of the Munich mas-
sacre. Gianna Trexler was nominated to re-
ceive an Olympiad Award at the event. Gianna 
is an early college high school student who re-
cently graduated from Rowan College with an 
associate degree in Liberal Arts. In addition to 
her liberal arts studies, she is also a bio-
medical sciences academy student. Gianna is 
a member of the National Honor Society, Mu 
Alpha Theta, and the Science National Honor 
Society. While at Cumberland Regional High 
School, she was a member of multiple clubs 
and also was a ‘‘senior mentor,’’ who helped 
underclassmen with the transition from middle 
school into high school. Additionally, Gianna 
was a part of the field hockey and tennis 
teams and earned varsity letters in softball 
and swimming. She was awarded with a Pres-
idential Merit Scholarship from Delaware Val-
ley University, where she will continue her 
studies in Large Animal Science and Pre-Vet-
erinary medicine, as well as play softball. 
Gianna should be proud of her many accom-
plishments, and I wish her the best of luck in

God Bless our America.

RECOGNIZING THE SERVICE OF 
JON BOUGHTIN 
HON. BRADLEY SCOTT SCHNEIDER 
OF ILLINOIS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, June 21, 2022 
Mr. SCHNEIDER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize the service of Jon 
Boughtin, the long-serving and committed 
member of the New Dem family. 
Jon is leaving Capitol Hill this month after 
working for more than a decade in public serv-
ice, including for Rep. Bill Owens, Rep. Lin-
coln Davis, and the New Democrat Coalition 
under Chairs SUZAN DELBENE and DEREK KIL-
MER. Jon’s meaningful member engagement 
will leave a lasting impact on the Coalition for 
years to come. 
As New Dems, we have 98 members fo-
cused on advocating for common sense poli-
cies to grow our economy, educate our kids, 
and lift up Americans from every walk of life. 
We cut across the gridlock and political divi-
sion to deliver real solutions to some of the 
toughest challenges facing American families. 
The work is hard and unrelenting, but Jon 
faced every challenge with optimism and in-
tegrity. Our members are better for having 
worked with Jon for the last five years. 
More important than his daily work, Jon was 
a kind colleague to his peers and a dedicated 
advocate for all Americans throughout his ca-
reer. His presence at the New Democrat Coa-
lition will be sorely missed. 
On behalf of our entire Coalition, I want to 
thank Jon for his hard work and wish him and 
his family nothing but the best in his future en-
deavors. 
HONORING DALE GRINNELL FOR 
HIS 
DEDICATION 
TO 
SERVING 
THE FORT ANN COMMUNITY 
HON. ELISE M. STEFANIK 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, June 21, 2022 
Ms. STEFANIK. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor Dale Grinnell for his years of 
service to Fort Ann. Dale has spent his entire 
life selflessly serving his community without 
ever expecting any thanks in return. 
Dale was born in Glen Falls, New York and 
grew up working on his family’s two hundred 
and fifty head farm, Wilbur Grinnell and Sons 
Dairy Farm. In 1965, he moved to Fort Ann 
and began working at Finch-Pruyn Paper in 
Glens Falls. After thirty-five years, Dale retired 
from the paper mill and continued to focus his 
attention on serving his community. 
Dale is a deacon at the Cornerstone Bible 
Church in Fort Ann. He has also managed the 
church’s food pantry for many years and takes 
great pride in ensuring food gets to those in 
need. He coordinates deliveries of this food 
and will deliver it himself if he is unable to find 
a volunteer. Dale and his wife worked tire-
lessly throughout the pandemic to keep the 
food pantry open to ensure that everyone 
safely received the assistance they needed. 
In addition to his work with the Cornerstone 
Bible Church, Dale serves his community in 
many other roles. Preserving the incredible 
history of Washington County has consistently 
been a top priority for Dale. He is the adminis-
trator of historical markers at the Washington 
County Historical Society. In 2007, he contrib-
uted to the Fort Ann historical book, ‘‘300 
Years of History,’’ and he serves as the vice 
president of the Fort Ann Historical Society. 
Dale was actively involved in preserving Battle 
Hill and assisted in obtaining grants for the 
project. 
Dale’s dedication to preserving and improv-
ing the Fort Ann community cannot be under-
stated. As Washington County honored him 
for his service in his community for Older 
Americans Month, I am proud to thank Dale 
for his commitment to serving the Fort Ann 
community. On behalf of New York’s 21st Dis-
trict, I am honored to recognize Dale for his in-
credible life of service.

WAR VETERANS SERGEANT BEN-

AND 
COR-
PORAL JOSIAH CUTLER AS THEY 
RECEIVE PLAQUES IN ANN AR-
BOR’S FOREST HILL CEMETERY 
HON. DEBBIE DINGELL 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, June 21, 2022 
Mrs. DINGELL. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize Revolutionary War Vet-
erans Sergeant Benjamin Woodruff and Cor-
poral Josiah Cutler on the occasion of the lay-
ing of a plaque in their honor at Forest Hill 
Cemetery located in Ann Arbor, Michigan by 
the Huron Valley Chapter of the National Soci-
ety of the Sons of the American Revolution. 
Freedom is not free, and today we pause to 
remember two men who served their country 
during the Revolutionary War. Their service to 
our nation at the time of its birth is worthy of 
commendation. 
Born and raised in New Jersey, Sergeant 
Benjamin Woodruff first enlisted in the Conti-
nental Army as a drummer in 1776. He later 
enlisted as a Sergeant in the New Jersey Mili-
tia and served in this position for the remain-
der of the war. During his time in the army, 
Sergeant Woodruff fought in the battles of 
Elizabethtown, 
Springfield, 
and 
at 
Acquacvkanock. He died in Pittsfield Town-
ship, Michigan in 1837 at the age of 92. 
Corporal Josiah Cutler was a native of 
Brookfield, Massachusetts. Beginning in 1778, 
he served for four years and 10 months in the 
Continental Army until he was honorably dis-
charged in 1784. While enlisted, Corporal Cut-
ler fought at Battle of Kingsbridge and stormed 
the redoubt at Yorktown under General Lafay-
ette. In 1840, at age 78, Cutler moved to Pitts-
field Township, Michigan where he died a cou-
ple months later. 
Both Sergeant Benjamin Woodruff and Cor-
poral Josiah Cutler are remembered for their 
honorable military service and dedication to 
our nation. They are just a few of the native 
and adopted Michiganders who fought for our 
country during the revolution. It is important for 
us to honor the veterans of community who 
fought for the freedom of our nation, a value 
we continue to hold dear today. There is no 
better moment to recognize these veterans 
than on the upcoming anniversary of our na-
tion. We are thankful for the path these sol-
diers laid out for past, present, and future 
Americans over two centuries ago. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me today in celebrating the honorable men 
Sergeant Benjamin Woodruff and Corporal Jo-
siah Cutler as they are memorialized in Ann 
Arbor, Michigan. We join with Americans ev-
erywhere in extending our thanks to the Huron 
Valley Chapter of the National Society of the 
Sons of the American Revolution for their work 
remembering these important men. Today and 
every day, we honor the brave patriots we lost 
in the fight for our independence. We are 
grateful for their military service and their will-
ingness to fight for the freedom and liberty 
that we enjoy today.

Mr. VAN DREW. Madam Speaker, last Sun-
day, I had the honor of attending the Olympiad 
at Beth Israel congregation in remembrance of 
the 50-year anniversary of the Munich mas-
sacre. Angel Smith of Bridgeton High School 
was nominated to receive the Olympiad Stu-
dent Athlete Award at the event. Angel is a 
committed student-athlete, who earned varsity 
letters in basketball, cross country, and foot-
ball. Additionally, he was named First Team 
All-Conference in basketball for both his junior 
and senior year seasons. As well as his ath-
letic achievements, Angel excelled in aca-
demics. He will continue both his academic 
and athletic career in the fall at Rowan Col-
lege where he will study engineering tech-
nology and play basketball. Angel truly led by 
example at Bridgeton High School, and I wish

RECOGNIZING DR. JOHN WITHERS 
OF IRVINE, CALIFORNIA 
HON. KATIE PORTER 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, June 21, 2022 
Ms. PORTER. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to recognize Mr. John Withers of Irvine, Cali-
fornia. Mr. Withers served as Chairman of the 
Orange County Sanitation District Board of Di-
rectors from June 2021 to June 2022. 
During his tenure, Mr. Withers led the work 
of the Orange County Sanitation District’s 
Board of Directors, providing high quality 
water treatment services for over two million 
Orange County residents and protecting our 
fragile coastal ecosystems from wastewater 
pollution. Under his watch, the Orange County 
Sanitation District has served as a model for 
other communities throughout the Nation that 
are facing climate resiliency challenges. 
Despite the challenges brought on by the 
COVID–19 pandemic, Mr. Withers oversaw 
the implementation and initiation of multiple 
public works projects. One of the most impres-
sive projects was the construction of a new 
headworks facility, which serves as the nerv-
ous system of a well-functioning wastewater 
treatment process. These efforts will improve 
the service capabilities of the wastewater 
treatment plant and the resiliency of the facili-
ty’s electrical system, resulting in fewer power 
disruptions and better safeguards. This ambi-
tious project will provide Orange County with 
the necessary infrastructure to better manage 
the harms brought on by climate change and 
create good paying jobs. 
PFAS, a group of man-made chemicals that 
are harmful to human health, are a serious 
threat to our drinking water. I am thankful for 
the Orange County Sanitation District’s com-
mitment to developing solutions to address 
this issue and help protect families. Mr. With-
ers understood the need to protect public 
health through the development of innovative 
technologies that keep our water safe by treat-
ing and removing these chemicals. His work 
has served as a catalyst to promote acces-
sible and cost-efficient PFAS treatment. 
I am proud to honor Mr. Withers and thank 
him for his years of service on the Orange 
County Sanitation District’s Board of Directors 
and for his successful work as the board’s 
Chairman.

RECOGNIZING JON BOUGHTIN 
HON. SUZAN K. DelBENE 
OF WASHINGTON 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, June 21, 2022 
Ms. DELBENE. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to recognize the service of Jon Boughtin, a 
dedicated staffer for the New Democrat Coali-
tion. 
Jon departs Capitol Hill this month after 
working for more than a decade in public serv-
ice, but his legacy of strong member engage-
ment and meaningful relationships with staff, 
members, and outside stakeholders alike will 
not soon be forgotten. 
The New Dems occupy an important place 
within the Democratic Caucus. We are the 
center of gravity in the House Democratic 
Caucus, the majority makers, and forward- 
thinking policymakers. None of our work would 
be possible without a strong support system 
for our members and staff. Jon worked tire-
lessly to support the New Dems, helping them 
make a meaningful and lasting legislative im-
pact in the House of Representatives. Jon de-
veloped relationships with countless external 
experts and organizations, which was essen-
tial for New Dems to ‘‘get stuff done,’’ as we 
often like to say. One thing we heard over and 
over from New Dem members and staff was, 
‘‘Jon always came in at the right time with the 
right advice before I even knew I needed it.’’ 
This level of instinct and intellect is a rare 
combination. 
New Dems are known for working across 
the ideological spectrum and with anyone who 
is willing to come to the table to get things 
done. But more than that, we’ve also become 
a home for thoughtful, measured leaders who 
have had enough of the shouting and division 
that too often defines our politics. Jon helped 
foster this spirit of collaboration and coopera-
tion. Because of his relationships and thought-
ful, smart work, New Dems have been able to 
deliver meaningful policy solutions that put 
kitchen-table issues at the center of the polit-
ical debate. 
Jon embodied the New Dem spirit as a self-
less public servant and pragmatic policy advo-
cate throughout his career. As the Chair of our 
98-Member Coalition, I thank Jon for his serv-
ice, both past and future, and wish him and 
his family all the best.

RYAN MATHIS 
HON. JEFFERSON VAN DREW 
OF NEW JERSEY 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, June 21, 2022 
Mr. VAN DREW. Madam Speaker, this 
month, I had the honor of attending Ryan 
Mathis’ Eagle Scout Court of Honor ceremony. 
Ryan graduated from Cape May County Tech-
nical High School last year and was a part of 
their welding program, where he became a 
certified welder. He achieved his Eagle Scout 
rank as a part of Cape May Court House 
Troop 65. For his Eagle Scout project, Ryan 
built a flag box for retired American flags. He 
designed the box himself and created it from 
a sheet of steel, utilizing his welding skills. 
Ryan placed the retired flag box at the Amer-
ican Legion in Cape May Court House. Ryan 
should be proud of his project and his service 
to Cape May Court House and the entire 
South Jersey community. I wish him the best 
of luck in all of his future endeavors. God 
Bless Ryan, and God Bless our United States 
of America. 
RECOGNIZING THE 100TH ANNIVER-
SARY 
OF 
AMERICAN 
LEGION 
POST 12 
HON. RICHARD HUDSON 
OF NORTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, June 21, 2022 
Mr. HUDSON. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to recognize the 100th anniversary of Amer-
ican Legion Post 12, located in North Caro-
lina’s Eighth Congressional District. Since its 
founding on June 26, 1922, Post 12 has made 
countless contributions to our community. 
Over the years, Post 12 has been a fierce 
advocate for veterans’ affairs and rehabilita-
tion, national security, Americanism, and our 
children and youth. These Four Pillars of the 
American Legion serve as a guiding light for 
the organization and pervade all aspects of 
Post 12’s philanthropic work. 
Composed of service members, veterans, 
and military families, Post 12 represents the 
best our nation has to offer. I am proud to rep-
resent a district that has a strong military pres-
ence and is home to some of the bravest pa-
triots in the country. Not only did these men 
and women serve our country while in uni-
form, but they also continue to give back to 
our community’s robust veteran population. 
Post 12 ensures our men and women in 
uniform have the resources and support they 
need throughout and after their service 
through local advocacy and assistance with 
the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs. Fur-
thermore, Post 12 serves as a community 
leader in Graves Registration by assisting con-
cerned parties locate veterans’ gravesites and 
maintaining a burial lot for kinless servicemen. 
It is also a principal sponsor for many commu-
nity service initiatives and youth academic 
scholarships. 
I know I speak for our entire community in 
offering my most heartfelt gratitude to Amer-
ican Legion Post 12 for their century of serv-
ice. The exemplary men and women of Post 
12 are the heart and soul of our community 
and I wish them continued success in their 
service going forward. 
Madam Speaker, please join me today in 
recognizing the 100th anniversary of American 
Legion Post 12.

BASE ACCESS PRIVILEGES 
IMPROVEMENT ACT 
HON. JOHN GARAMENDI 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, June 21, 2022 
Mr. GARAMENDI. Madam Speaker, today I 
introduce the ‘‘Base Access Privileges Im-
provement Act,’’ which would standardize and 
streamline access to military installations for 
designated support personnel across the na-
tion. I thank my colleague Congressman DON-
ALD NORCROSS (D–NJ) for his support as the 
bill’s original cosponsor. 
Every day, civilian workers access military 
bases to provide services, transport goods, or 
conduct job fairs for departing service mem-
bers or military spouses. Unfortunately, from 
state to state—or even installation to installa-
tion—there 
are 
different 
standards 
for 
unescorted civilian access set by the service

branches or base commanders. This can be a 
maddening bureaucracy for support workers 
requiring routine base access to do their jobs. 
The ‘‘Base Access Privileges Improvement 
Act’’ would create an overarching set of ac-
cess standards for civilians with legitimate 
need to access military installations on a re-
curring basis or for a scheduled purpose. For 
example, the bill would allow truckers deliv-
ering household goods for military families to 
use their Transportation Worker Identification 
Credentials, which is issued by the U.S. De-
partment of Homeland Security and requires 
passing a federal background check, for prov-
ing their identity to get on base. The bill would 
also require that the U.S. Department of De-
fense provide expedited, unescorted base ac-
cess privileges for veterans accessing serv-
ices at the installation, civilians working at a 
construction job site on base, State labor reg-
ulators for applicable workers’ compensation 
or minimum wage laws, and members of fed-
erally recognized labor-management commit-
tees. 
As chairman of the House Armed Services 
Subcommittee on Readiness, I know full well 
that our military installations are secure for a 
good reason. However, for those civilians who 
are already appropriately vetted and cleared, 
we must ease the bureaucratic hurdles for 
base access so they can do their job in sup-
port of our nation’s military, military families, 
and veterans. Military bases can maintain the 
highest level of scrutiny for those seeking ac-
cess while still equalizing the requirements 
across the nation. The ‘‘Base Access Privi-
leges Improvement Act’’ would ensure just 
that.

Tuesday, June 21, 2022 
Mr. VAN DREW. Madam Speaker, last Sun-
day, l had the honor of attending the Olympiad 
at Beth Israel congregation in remembrance of 
the 50-year anniversary of the Munich mas-
sacre. Ryan Russo was nominated to receive 
the Olympiad Student Athlete Award at the 
event. Ryan is an impressive student-athlete 
who excelled in the classroom, in the pool, 
and on the track at Vineland High School. 
During his senior year season, he suffered an 
injury that restricted him from playing. How-
ever, Ryan remained positive and committed 
to his teams. He is a true leader and an am-
bassador for his community, school, and his 
teams, serving as a role model for many un-
derclassmen. Ryan should be very proud of 
his contributions to the Vineland High School 
community, and I am glad that I was able to 
meet him at the event last weekend. God 
Bless Ryan, and God Bless our America.

HONORING SGT. THOMAS H. 
COREY, VIETNAM VETERAN 
HON. LOIS FRANKEL 
OF FLORIDA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, June 21, 2022 
Ms. LOIS FRANKEL of Florida. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to honor Sergeant Thom-
as H. Corey, a decorated Vietnam War Vet-
eran and beloved advocate for veteran’s 
rights. Sergeant Corey passed away at the 
age of 77, on June 6, 2022, in Jupiter, Florida, 
due to complications from injuries sustained 
during the Vietnam War. 
Sergeant Corey served as a U.S. Army 
combat infantryman and squad leader in Viet-
nam. In January 1968, in Quang Tri Province, 
he was shot in his spinal cord while engaging 
the enemy, leaving him paralyzed and quad-
riplegic. For his service and heroism, Sergeant 
Corey was awarded the Bronze Star and two 
Purple Hearts. 
After medically retiring, Sergeant Corey relo-
cated to West Palm Beach, Florida in 1972 
and joined the Vietnam Veterans of America 
(VVA), beginning his decades-long career as 
an advocate for our nation’s veterans. In 1981, 
he founded VVA’s Palm Beach County Chap-
ter 25, which was renamed in his honor in 
1991. 
Sergeant Corey would go on to serve as 
VVA’s National President and vowed, ‘‘to 
speak up for those veterans without a voice.’’ 
He fought for mandatory funding for veterans’ 
health care and services because he believed 
that ‘‘to deny adequate funding for quality 
health care and other services is to violate a 
sacred trust with the nation.’’ 
Sergeant Corey also traveled back to Viet-
nam more than a dozen times as a represent-
ative of the VVA’s Veterans Initiative Task 
Force to meet with his former enemy, and 
work together in search of the remains of 
Americans and Vietnamese who lost their lives 
during the war. He simultaneously ran the 
Vietnam Veterans Peace Initiative where he 
spearheaded the building of a maternal health 
clinic in Vietnam to provide medical support to 
victims of Agent Orange attacks. 
Sergeant Corey dedicated his life to fighting 
for veterans and improving access to quality 
health care. His work has touched the lives of 
generations of veterans and their families. I 
am proud to honor him today and express my 
condolences to his family, friends and to our 
entire community for the enormous void he 
leaves behind. May his memory be a blessing.
