PRAYER 
The Chaplain, the Reverend Margaret

prayer: 
Gracious and loving God, all that we 
have is from You. From You we have 
inherited the precious gifts of life, lib-
erty, and law. 
We ask that You would be gracious 
unto us according to these promises. 
Grant us Your favor and be merciful to 
us as we live into them. 
We offer ourselves to You this day, 
turning our steps in Your direction 
that we would see Your face reflected 
in the people You have placed in our 
lives. 
In the dark of night, may we have 
the strength to rise to give You 
thanks. 
For though the malice of this world 
dares to drag us into its chaos, Your 
righteousness is our guide and defense. 
Though the winds of change and up-
heaval swirl around us, Your law holds 
firm as our anchor. 
In response to Your many mercies, 
may we be a friend to all who fear You. 
In the fellowship of Your grace, may 
we seek to be brothers and sisters to 
all who worship You. 
The Earth is filled with Your loving 
kindness, O Lord. May we, as we go 
about the living of our lives this day, 
reflect Your perfect justice and Your 
steadfast love. 
In the strength of Your name we 
pray. 
Amen.

REMEMBERING CHARLENE RYAN 
CLOPP 
HON. TIM RYAN 
OF OHIO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, July 9, 2021 
Mr. RYAN. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
honor the life of Charlene Ryan Clopp, for-
merly of Warren, who passed away in her 
home on Tuesday, June 8, 2021, at the age 
of 65. 
Charlene leaves behind her husband, Daniel 
Clopp. 
Charlene was a true light in this world. She 
was kind, loving, generous, and always there 
with a helping hand. Her spirit was infectious, 
and she enjoyed spending time with her fam-
ily, friends, and dog named Prince. 
She will be deeply missed by her three 
brothers, Allen (Marcy) Ryan of Ashtabula, 
Dennis (Janice) Ryan of Cortland, James 
Ryan of Warren; one sister, Kathleen (Larry) 
Nash of Alpharetta, Georgia; along with her 
nieces and nephews. 
Charlene was my aunt on my father’s side. 
I know my father and all his siblings will deep-
ly miss her. My condolences go out to all 
whose lives she so deeply touched.

REMEMBERING PHILLIP COX 
HON. DEVIN NUNES 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, July 9, 2021 
Mr. NUNES. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to honor the life of Phillip Andrew Cox, a life-
long Visalia resident, businessman, and public 
servant. 
Born to Samuel Elmer Cox and Lou Emma 
Strange on a small farm in Laton, California 
on April 17, 1957, Phil moved to Visalia before 
his second birthday. He remained dedicated to 
the Visalia community throughout his life. 
After graduating from Mt. Whitney High 
School, Phil served in Switzerland as a mis-
sionary for the Church of Jesus Christ of Lat-
ter-day Saints. Following his service, Phil re-
turned to Visalia to attend the College of the 
Sequoias. In 1985, Phillip founded Cox Sheet 
Metal Company. Twelve years later, he 
opened Visalia Paintball Supply. During this 
period, Phillip was also an advisory committee 
member and served on the Visalia Planning 
Commission. 
Phil’s love for his community motivated him 
to pursue elected office, where he worked to 
improve the health of his community and build 
a reputation for his tireless dedication to public 
service. In 2001, Phil was first elected to the 
Visalia City Council; he then served on the 
Tulare County Board of Supervisors for twelve 
distinguished years. Phil later returned to his 
roots, rejoining the Visalia City Council. 
Outside of public office, Phil served as a 
scoutmaster and merit badge counselor for the 
Boy Scouts of America and was a local varsity 
athletics 
coach. 
Whether 
government 
or 
extracurriculars, Phillip’s dedication to his 
community was unparalleled. 
Phil died on June 16, 2021. A beloved 
member of his community, he will be greatly 
missed by many. 
Phillip is survived by his wife, Connie, and 
his children, Phillip II, Robert, Matthew, Kevin, 
Timothy, Kimberly, and Heidi. He also leaves 
behind twenty-two grandchildren. I offer his 
family my deepest condolences. His presence 
will be greatly missed.

RECOGNIZING DIRECTOR FOR THE 
COLLEGE ASSISTANCE MIGRANT 
PROGRAM, MARY TREVINO 
HON. HENRY CUELLAR 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, July 9, 2021 
Mr. CUELLAR. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to honor the achievements of Mary Trevino in 
consideration of her forthcoming retirement as 
Director for the College Assistance Migrant 
Program at Texas A&M International Univer-
sity (TAMIU). While her professional capacity 
at TAMIU will come to an end, her dedication 
to higher education and philanthropy will en-
dure in her students, colleagues, and greater 
communities. 
In 1968, Ms. Trevino graduated from Ray-
mond & Tirza Martin High School, located in 
Laredo, TX. Thereafter, she attended Texas 
A&I University in Laredo, graduating in May 
1972 with a Bachelor of Science in Secondary 
Education with a certificate in Secondary 
Mathematics and History. Following gradua-
tion, she went on to collect over 43 years of 
administrative experience at TAMIU. In her 
many roles at the university, she has served 
as Associate Vice President for Academic Af-
fairs, Associate Vice President for Student 
Services, Director of Institutional Research & 
Effectiveness, and Special Assistant to the 
President. 
As Director for the College Assistance Mi-
grant Program (CAMP), Ms. Trevino serves 
students who are migratory or seasonal farm-
workers and often the first generation in their 
families to attend college. CAMP emboldens 
students to achieve a higher education by pro-
viding collaborative academic support services 
across the university. 
Accordingly, Ms. Trevino’s efforts have 
earned her numerous honors and recogni-
tions. For example, she was named as Out-
standing Administrative Employee at Laredo 
State University in 1992; she served as Board 
President for Communities in Schools from 
1998 to 1999 and 2003 through 2004; she 
served as President for the TAMIU Alumni As-
sociation from 1992 to 1993, and she served 
as President of United Way of Laredo from 
2009 to 2010. 
Her penchant for learning and teaching and 
her connection to TAMIU has also inspired her 
family; two of her four children share her 
alumnus status at TAMIU and currently hold 
teaching positions in public schools. 
I am pleased to congratulate Mary Trevino 
on over 50 years of service to TAMIU and the 
Laredo community. Ms. Trevino’s devotion to 
higher education is an impressive achieve-
ment. I wish her the best of luck in all her fu-
ture endeavors, and Go Dustdevils. 
Madam Speaker, again, I recognize the ca-
reer and character of Mary Trevino.

RECOGNIZING THE BICENTENNIAL 
ANNIVERSARY OF THE TOWN OF 
EVANS 
HON. CHRIS JACOBS 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, July 9, 2021 
Mr. JACOBS of New York. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to recognize the Town of Evans, 
New York on its bicentennial anniversary. 
The Town of Evans, New York was founded 
on March 31, 1821, when the Legislature of 
New York State proposed and passed an Act 
for the purpose of establishing the Town of 
Evans. The Town of Evans has a rich history, 
and I am honored to represent it in Congress. 
The Town of Evans was named after David 
Ellicott Evans who served as an agent for the 
Holland Land Company. He worked dutifully 
for the Holland Land Company, emphasizing 
the importance of respecting the pioneers that 
settled the lands. Mr. Evans’ unwavering kind-
ness towards the pioneers and everyone he 
encountered prompted the State Legislature to 
name the town in his honor. 
Many great businesses and businesspeople 
have hailed from the Town of Evans, including 
Willis Haviland Carrier, the inventor of modern 
air conditioning. From Evans’ Village of An-
gola, Carrier crafted a temperature-controlled 
future that countless people around the world 
continue to rely on today. 
Today, the Town of Evans is a robust, 
generational farming community with livestock, 
maple syrup, horticulture, and commercial 
crop farms that provide essential goods to 
local residents and surrounding communities. 
Located on Lake Erie and south of the City of 
Buffalo, the town also offers 12 miles of scenic 
coastline. Residents enjoy the town’s numer-
ous parks and beaches, as well as Sturgeon 
Point Marina which serves as a key launch for 
boaters and fisherman on the lake. Nature 
trails and picturesque sunsets over Lake Erie 
attract visitors from all over the country. 
I thank the Town of Evans for its commit-
ment to preserving 200 years of history, and 
I again congratulate the town on its bicenten-
nial anniversary. 
IN 
HONOR 
OF 
THE 
LIFE 
OF 
GEORGE 
CRANWELL 
‘‘CRAN’’ 
MONTGOMERY 
HON. TIM BURCHETT 
OF TENNESSEE 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, July 9, 2021 
Mr. BURCHETT. Madam Speaker, I rise to 
honor the life of Ambassador George Cranwell 
Montgomery, who passed away on June 14 at 
the age of 76. Many people addressed him as 
‘‘Mr. Ambassador,’’ but to friends in Knoxville 
or to colleagues near and far, he was simply 
known as ‘‘Cran.’’ 
Cran was born and raised in Knoxville be-
fore heading to school at the University of Vir-
ginia. Following his graduation in 1966, Cran 
was commissioned into the Navy for 6 years 
and served as a Commander in Vietnam. He 
remained in the Navy Reserves until 1994, 
when he retired as a Captain. 
After his military service, Cran earned a de-
gree from Vanderbilt University Law School 
and started working for Tennessee Senator 
Howard Baker, Jr. Cran worked for Senator 
Baker while he was Senate Minority and Ma-
jority Leader, advising him on matters related 
to foreign policy and national security. 
Cran gained experience and knowledge on 
Middle East foreign policy while working for 
Senator Baker, leading President Ronald 
Reagan to nominate Cran for U.S. Ambas-
sador to Oman. Cran ’s nomination was suc-
cessful and he served as Ambassador to 
Oman from 1985 to 1989. He then moved 
back to Washington to practice international 
law at the Baker Donelson law firm. When he 
retired, Cran and his wife Carol returned to 
East Tennessee to spend time in his beloved 
home state surrounded by his loved ones. 
Cran was a brave military veteran, dedi-
cated public servant, and a valuable member 
of the east Tennessee community. He leaves 
behind his wife, Carol; his daughter, Erynn; 
and many other loved ones who will remem-
ber him fondly. I thank him for the many ways 
he served our country throughout his life.

CELEBRATING THE LIFE OF REV. 
DR. ROGER RAYMOND FISCHER 
HON. GUY RESCHENTHALER 
OF PENNSYLVANIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, July 9, 2021 
Mr. RESCHENTHALER. Madam Speaker, I 
rise to celebrate the life of Rev. Dr. Roger 
Raymond Fischer, who passed away on July 
1, 2021. 
A native of Washington, Pennsylvania, Rev. 
Fischer graduated from Washington High 
School in 1959. He attended Washington and 
Jefferson College in 1963, graduating with a 
Bachelor of Arts in Mathematics and Physics. 
Later in life, he earned an honorary Doctor of 
Divinity from his alma mater. 
At the age of 25, Rev. Fischer was elected 
to the Pennsylvania House of Representatives 
for the 47th District, serving ten consecutive 
terms from 1966 to 1988. He was one of the 
youngest members elected in the history of 
the General Assembly, and served as Chair-
man of the House Education Committee and 
on the State Board of Education. After his re-
tirement, Rev. Fischer became President of 
the 
Association 
of 
Retired 
Pennsylvania 
House of Representatives and Senate Mem-
bers, sharing his wisdom with current legisla-
tors for nine terms. A dedicated citizen, he 
voted in every primary and general election 
from 1962 until the time of his death, which 
earned him a place in the Pennsylvania Voter 
Hall of Fame. 
After serving honorably as a Second Lieu-
tenant in the U.S. Air Force, Rev. Fischer was 
still determined to contribute to our Nation’s 
defense. He accepted a commission as a 
Lieutenant Colonel in the U.S. Air Force Re-
serve, while continuing to work tirelessly for 
his community in the legislature. Rev. Fischer 
also gave back to his fellow veterans through 
his work with American Legion Post 175. 
Following his time as a legislator, Rev. 
Fischer felt a call from God to pursue ministry, 
earning a master’s degree with honors from 
the Lutheran Seminary at Gettysburg in 1991. 
In 1998, he was granted a Doctor of Ministry 
Degree from the Pittsburgh Theological Semi-
nary. Rev. Fischer was ordained on January 
13th, 1990, at First Lutheran Church, Wash-
ington, and went on to serve several churches 
in southwestern Pennsylvania and West Vir-
ginia. The last congregations he served were 
Calvary Lutheran in Scenery Hill, Buena Vista 
Presbyterian, and Hyland Brotheran. 
Throughout his life, Rev. Fischer was dedi-
cated to fitness and endurance. He finished 
the Ironman Triathlon not once, but twice. 
Rev. Fischer ran multiple marathons across 
the U.S. and, at the age of 74, added the Dis-
ney World Marathon to his list. He elected to 
bike across America and hiked the entire 
2,174.1-mile Appalachian Trail. Well-traveled 
after discovering the passion with his wife of 
48 years, Kitty, Rev. Fischer could proudly say 
he visited every continent except Antarctica. 
Madam Speaker, Rev. Dr. Roger Raymond 
Fischer led an incredibly accomplished life, 
one marked by dedication to God, community, 
and country. I have no doubt his legacy will 
live on in his community and across the Com-
monwealth of Pennsylvania.

Ms. NORTON. Madam Speaker, today, I in-
troduce a bill to require the Directors of the 
Court Services and Offender Supervision 
Agency for the District of Columbia (CSOSA) 
and the District of Columbia Pretrial Services 
Agency (PSA) to reside in the District of Co-
lumbia during their tenure. 
CSOSA is an independent Federal agency 
that supervises offenders only in D.C. PSA is 
an independent agency within CSOSA that su-
pervises defendants only in D.C. This bill 
would not apply to those already in office upon 
enactment.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks
E749 
July 9, 2021 
Congress has justifiably required that certain 
Federal officials live in the jurisdiction they 
serve to ensure in-depth knowledge of the 
unique issues and challenges residents and 
these Federal officials face, but these Federal 
officials serving the District are not required to 
do so. There is no reason that the Directors of 
CSOSA and PSA, Federal agencies that 
uniquely serve D.C. residents, should not be 
required to live in the District, engage with 
local communities and work closely with local 
officials. Adding residency requirements for 
these Federal officials is a matter of fairness 
for the residents they serve. 
Madam Speaker, I strongly urge my col-
leagues to support this legislation.

CONGRATULATING CHRIS NILSEN 
HON. DUSTY JOHNSON 
OF SOUTH DAKOTA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, July 9, 2021 
Mr. JOHNSON of South Dakota. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Univer-
sity of South Dakota alum Chris Nilsen for 
placing first in the pole vault at the U.S. Olym-
pic Trials and qualifying for the 2020 Olympic 
Games in Tokyo. 
During the Trials, Chris made his first six at-
tempts, clearing both the Olympic standard 
and the championship clinching height without 
a miss. He currently ranks fifth in the world 
heading into the Games. His success at the 
Trials is just one of the many impressive feats 
in his pole-vaulting career. 
As a Coyote, Chris was a three-time NCAA 
Champion and seven-time All-American. He 
was also named USTFCCCA National Field 
Athlete of the Year. He graduated from USD 
in 2020. 
This is not the first time Chris Nilsen will 
represent USD and the U.S. on the big stage. 
In 2019, he won gold at the Pan American 
Games. He also represented the U.S. at the 
2017 World Championships and qualified for 
the 2016 Olympic Trials at the age of 18. 
I want to congratulate Chris on winning the 
event and punching his ticket to Tokyo. I look 
forward to cheering him and the rest of Team 
USA on at the Olympic Games.

PROCLAMATION TO HONOR THE 
ACCOMPLISHMENTS OF OPAL LEE 
HON. MARC A. VEASEY 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, July 9, 2021 
Mr. VEASEY. Madam Speaker, few can be 
heralded as being the impetus for one of this 
country’s national holidays. Fort Worth’s own 
Opal Lee is one such person. It is not an over-
statement to say that without Opal Lee, June 
19 would not have been made a national holi-
day. Juneteenth, as it is known, now is. Invited 
by President Joseph R. Biden, Jr., Opal Lee 
stood next to him in the White House on June 
17 as the President signed into law the legis-
lation making June 19 a Federal holiday; and 
she’s been jetting, literally, around the country 
ever since to be recognized for this monu-
mental achievement. 
Opal Lee has committed much of her life to 
celebrating June 19, the day in 1865, when 
Union soldiers, led by Major General Gordon 
Granger, landed at Galveston, Texas, with 
news that the war had ended and that 
enslaved Africans were now free. Quoting 
from General Orders Number 3, Maj. Gen. 
Gordon Granger announced that ‘‘[t]he people 
of Texas are informed that in accordance with 
a proclamation from the Executive of the 
United States, all slaves are free. . . .’’ 
Opal Lee has been the face of Juneteenth 
in Fort Worth for decades. By the early 2000s, 
she began advocating for making Juneteenth 
a national holiday. And in 2016, at age 90, 
she started a walking campaign across the 
Nation to bring attention to and awareness of 
the need for a National Day of Observance for 
Juneteenth. Juneteenth is the oldest known 
celebration commemorating the ending of 
slavery in the United States. 
Opal Lee is a graduate of the Historic I.M. 
Terrell High School, class of 1943. She 
earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1953, 
from Wiley College, now Wiley University. She 
returned to Fort Worth to teach at Amanda 
McCoy Elementary School for 15 years, where 
she was regarded as one of the best edu-
cators in her field. She later obtained her mas-
ter’s degree in Counseling and Guidance from 
North Texas State University, now University 
of North Texas, and served as Home/School 
Counselor for Fort Worth Independent School 
District until her retirement in 1977. 
With Lenora Rolla, another of Fort Worth’s 
legendary icons and treasures, as its inspira-
tion, Opal Lee, along with 19 other charter 
members, founded the Tarrant County Black 
Historical & Genealogical Society in the 
1970s. The Tarrant County Black Historical & 
Genealogical Society is dedicated to archiving 
and preserving the historical contributions of 
Fort Worth and Tarrant County’s Black citizens 
to be able to educate and empower future 
generations through art, history, and culture. 
Opal Lee’s long and varied service to Fort 
Worth also includes serving on the Historic & 
Cultural Landmarks Commission, AIDS Out-
reach committee, Evans Avenue Business As-
sociation, and Riverside Neighborhood Advi-
sory Council, among many others. For more 
than 30 years, Lee has served as Precinct

HONORING U.S. NAVY CAPTAIN 
JEFF CHISM 
HON. JULIA BROWNLEY 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, July 9, 2021 
Ms. BROWNLEY. Madam Speaker, I rise to 
recognize a true American leader and patriot, 
Captain Jeff Chism, on the occasion of his re-
tirement after 26 years of honorable service in 
the United States Navy. 
A native of Tigard, Oregon, Captain Jeff 
Chism is a distinguished graduate of Biola 
University, the University of Southern Cali-
fornia, the Graziadio School of Business at 
Pepperdine University, and the Naval War 
College. Captain Chism earned his commis-
sion in the U.S. Navy through the University of 
California, Los Angeles Naval Reserve Officer 
Training Corps program. He is a designated 
Naval Flight Officer, Prowler Tactics Instructor, 
and operationally flew in the EA–6B Prowler 
and the EA-18G Growler. 
Captain Chism’s sea duty assignments in-
cluded the ‘‘Black Ravens’’ of VAQ–135; the 
‘‘Garudas’’ of VAQ–134; the Balkans Com-
bined Air Operations Center Electronic War-
fare Coordination Cell (EWCC) Vicenza, Italy; 
and the CENTCOM Combined Theater EWCC 
at the USAFCENT Combined Air Operations 
Center, Qatar. 
During these tours, he deployed aboard the 
USS Carl Vinson (CVN 70) in support of Oper-
ations 
DESERT 
FOX 
and 
SOUTHERN 
WATCH; a combat flying deployment to Incirlik 
Air Base, Turkey, in support of Operation 
NORTHERN WATCH; two combat flying de-
ployments to Bagram Air Field, Afghanistan, in 
support of Operation ENDURING FREEDOM; 
and two individual augmentee deployments 
first in support of Operations JOINT FORGE 
and JOINT GUARDIAN and then Operations 
ENDURING FREEDOM, IRAQ FREEDOM, 
and NEW DAWN. 
Ashore, he served with the ‘‘Bloodhounds’’ 
of VX–30; as Commander, U.S. THIRD 
FLEET (J7); and with the Office of the Under 
Secretary of Defense for Acquisitions and 
Sustainment Deputy Assistant Secretary of 
Defense Tactical Warfare Systems. 
Captain 
Chism 
also 
Commanded 
the 
‘‘Zappers’’ of VAQ–130. During this tour, he 
deployed aboard the USS Harry S Truman 
(CVN 75) in support of Operation ENDURING 
FREEDOM. Under his command, the squad-
ron earned the 2013 Commander Naval Air 
Forces Pacific Fleet Battle ‘‘E’’, 2013 Com-
mander Naval Air Forces Admiral Arthur W. 
Radford Award, and 2013 Chief of Naval Op-
erations Safety ‘‘S.’’ 
Captain Chism’s personal decorations in-
clude the Defense Meritorious Service Medal, 
Meritorious Service Medal, Air Medal (fifteen 
Strike/Flight awards), Navy Commendation 
Medal (three awards), Air Force Commenda-
tion Medal, Navy Achievement Medal (three 
awards), and various campaign and unit 
awards. 
In June 2018, Captain Chism assumed his 
duties as commanding officer of Naval Base 
Ventura County, located in California’s 26th 
Congressional District. With great distinction, 
he dutifully oversaw a diverse installation that 
supports more than 80 tenant commands with 
a base population of more than 19,000 per-
sonnel, including the Naval Construction 
Group ONE—also known as the ‘‘Seabees.’’ 
Captain Chism’s career at Naval Base Ven-
tura County has been underscored by his ex-
emplary leadership, perceptive planning, and 
focus on both mission execution and commu-
nity engagement. These efforts were clearly 
demonstrated by Captain Chism’s remarkable 
command of major aviation, shore, and port 
facilities, comprised of three primary sites: 
Point Mugu, Port Hueneme, and San Nicolas 
Island. 
Captain Chism also directed the day-to-day 
operations at the base, providing comprehen-
sive support services to the Fleet, Fighter, and 
Family. He also directed diverse installation

facilities maintenance and construction, utili-
ties, 
environmental 
stewardship, 
housing, 
childcare, recreation, safety, resource man-
agement, protocol, public affairs, family sup-
port service, and IT technology management. 
Naval Base Ventura County plays a critically 
important role in our national defense, and it 
will continue to do so for many years to come, 
thanks in part to Captain Chism ’s wise stew-
ardship over the past 3 years. 
As Representative of California’s 26th Con-
gressional District, including the men and 
women who serve our Nation at Naval Base 
Ventura County, I am pleased to join a grate-
ful community to extend my most sincere con-
gratulations and appreciation for his countless 
contributions to Ventura County, the U.S. 
Navy, and the United States of America. 
HONORING THE BROADHEAD AND 
WYDELL MEMORIAL TEAM 
HON. TIM RYAN 
OF OHIO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, July 9, 2021 
Mr. RYAN. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
honor the Broadhead and Wydell Memorial 
Team—a dedicated group of volunteers com-
mitted to honoring and recognizing veterans of 
Ohio’s 
13th 
district 
by 
identifying 
their 
gravesites. 
Two years ago, the Broadhead and Wydell 
Memorial Team began research of burial plots 
at Oak Hill Cemetery. Their goal was to re-
place the headstones and markers of veterans 
dating back to the beginning of our nation and 
the War for Independence. Unfortunately, 
many of the headstones were either in dis-
repair or completely missing, something that 
the Team was able to correct. 
Although they were sidelined temporarily by 
the COVID–19 pandemic, today their research 
has expanded to other cemeteries throughout 
my district. Their work continues to ensure 
that veterans receive the recognition they de-
serve for their service to our Nation. 
The work is both daunting and detailed. 
Members of the team count every headstone 
in a cemetery that is not marked as a military 
gravesite and creates a list of names. They 
then go about the work of determining whether 
or not the deceased served. Once a veteran 
has been identified, they work with the local 
Veterans Commission to provide flag holders 
for the grave. 
Steffon Jones, a co-founder of the group, is 
especially passionate about recognizing Civil 
War veterans and members of the U.S. Col-
ored Troops. His efforts, along with veteran 
Tony Seldes and Tom Anderson, were instru-
mental in ensuring that the name of Private 
Jacob Nixon Robinson, who served in the 5th 
Regiment of U.S. Colored Troops, was added 
to the Youngstown Civil War memorial monu-
ment. 
I commend Mr. Jones and the rest of the 
Broadhead and Wydell Memorial Team for 
their selfless and dedicated service to ensure 
veterans are recognized and honored appro-
priately.
