DESIGNATION OF SPEAKER PRO 
TEMPORE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore laid be-
fore the House the following commu-
nication from the Speaker: 
WASHINGTON, DC, 
January 13, 2020. 
I hereby appoint the Honorable HENRY C. 
JOHNSON, Jr. to act as Speaker pro tempore

NANCY PELOSI, 
Speaker of the House of Representatives.

ant to the order of the House of Janu-
ary 7, 2020, the Chair will now recog-
nize Members from lists submitted by 
the majority and minority leaders for 
morning-hour debate. 
The Chair will alternate recognition

COMMEMORATING KOREAN 
AMERICAN DAY 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
California (Mr. GOMEZ) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. GOMEZ. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to commemorate Korean Amer-
ican Day, January 13. 
I proudly represent Los Angeles and 
its Koreatown. It is the largest Korean 
population of any congressional dis-
trict in the country. 
My legislation, H. Res. 38, supporting 
the goals and ideals of Korean Amer-
ican Day, gives us an opportunity to 
appreciate the countless contributions 
Korean Americans have made to this 
country. 
On this occasion, we pay tribute to 
the influence Korean Americans have 
had on all facets of American life, from 
the private and public sectors to the 
world of art, food, education, and en-
trepreneurship. 
Mr. Speaker, 117 years after the first 
Korean immigrants came to the United 
States, the story of the Korean Amer-
ican community is one of honor, inspi-
ration, and resolve. Like other immi-
grant communities across the country, 
they have thrived through their strong 
work ethic, family bonds, and unbreak-
able spirit. I would like to thank them 
for entrusting me with the honor of 
representing them in Congress. 
I urge my colleagues to support H. 
Res. 38, commemorating Korean Amer-
ican Day. 
f 
REDUCING ANTI-SEMITISM 
THROUGH INCREASED EDUCATION 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Tennessee (Mr. KUSTOFF) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. KUSTOFF of Tennessee. Mr. 
Speaker, on December 28, 2019, the Jew-
ish community in Monsey, New York, 
gathered together to celebrate Hanuk-
kah. That celebration was cut short 
due to a vile, anti-Semitic attack leav-
ing five people wounded and an entire 
nation in shock. 
Anti-Semitism is on the rise, and it 
is important that younger generations 
understand where this hate stems from 
and why we need to combat it. H. Res. 
782 does just that. 
This important resolution encour-
ages schools to teach the history of 
anti-Semitism and the Holocaust and 
calls on law enforcement to bring the 
perpetrators of these attacks to jus-
tice. 
We must stop these senseless acts of 
hate, and I encourage my colleagues on 
both sides of the aisle to support this 
resolution. 
Mr. Speaker, I do want to thank my 
colleagues, Congressmen TED BUDD and 
LEE ZELDIN, for their leadership in in-
troducing this vital legislation with 
me. 
f 
RECOGNIZING 
THE 
ACCOMPLISH-
MENTS OF THE SHEETZ FAMILY 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Pennsylvania (Mr. JOYCE) for 5 min-
utes. 
Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania. Mr. 
Speaker, I rise today to highlight the 
many accomplishments of the Sheetz 
family. Their family-owned chain of 
convenience stores, which began as a 
single storefront in Altoona, Pennsyl-
vania, in 1952, has grown to include 
more than 600 stores. 
This weekend, Sheetz was recognized 
as one of America’s favorite res-
taurants. This business, which got its 
start in my hometown of Altoona more 
than six decades ago, has received sig-
nificant national acclaim for its role as 
an American staple. 
In addition to its business success, 
Sheetz is well-known for its commit-
ment to local communities. As a team, 
Sheetz employees are marked by their 
commitment to community service and 
their dedication to local organizations, 
such as Special Olympics, youth sports 
groups, and its own employee-founded 
charity, For the Kidz. 
Mr. Speaker, it is my privilege to 
share a hometown with Sheetz, and I 
am honored to congratulate the Sheetz 
family 
and 
their 
incredibly 
hard-
working team upon their achievement 
of being recognized as one of America’s 
favorite restaurants.

PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Will the

Mr. ROSE of New York led the

I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the 
United States of America, and to the Repub-
lic for which it stands, one nation under God, 
indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. 
f 
HONORING MS. MIMI CUSICK 
(Mr. ROSE of New York asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute.) 
Mr. ROSE of New York. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today in solemn mem-
ory of Ms. Mimi Cusick, a public serv-
ant, devoted mother, and larger-than- 
life figure in Staten Island politics for 
the past five decades. 
Ms. Cusick passed away on January 
5, but she leaves behind a powerful leg-
acy in my community. 
Ms. Cusick encouraged women to get 
involved in politics. A lifelong Staten 
Islander, she expressed a passion for 
politics at a young age and worked her 
way up as a behind-the-scenes force in 
the Staten Island Democratic Party. 
And even though she was a legend 
among Democrats on Staten Island, 
Ms. Cusick never hesitated to invite 
friends and neighbors of all political 
stripes into her home after great 
events like the island’s St. Patrick’s 
Day Parade. 
After her children left for college, 
she just couldn’t give up serving her 
community. No, Ms. Cusick worked as 
a school safety officer at P.S. 30 and 
P.S. 22 for 20 years. 
Staten Island and all of New York 
City are going to miss Ms. Cusick’s 
generosity of spirit, her devotion to 
public service, and her passion for civic 
engagement. 
Madam Speaker, may Ms. Cusick rest 
in peace. She will be incredibly, incred-
ibly missed, but we will honor her leg-
acy for all time to come. 
f 
PRESCRIPTION DRUG PRICES 
(Mrs. HARTZLER asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Mrs. HARTZLER. Madam Speaker, 
Americans from all walks of life suffer 
because of rising healthcare costs. It is 
a problem that impacts everyone. H.R. 
19, the Lower Costs, More Cures Act 
starts addressing this. 
This bill fosters competition, lowers 
the cost of medication, and spurs inno-
vation, allowing more generic drugs to 
come into the market. One way it does 
this is by preventing drug companies 
from unfairly keeping generic equiva-
lents from people who need them. 
H.R. 19 also caps prescription drug 
costs for Medicare beneficiaries and in-
cludes a smoothing out mechanism al-
lowing seniors to distribute their out- 
of-pocket 
expenses 
throughout 
the 
year. That is why I cosponsored H.R. 
19, the Lower Costs, More Cures Act, to 
take the first step towards making 
healthcare affordable. It includes near-
ly 50 reforms supported by both par-
ties, and it provides real healthcare so-
lutions. 
Madam Speaker, I urge Speaker 
PELOSI to bring this bill to a vote, and 
I urge my colleagues to support it. 
f 
JULIA TYLER AND DANCE HAPPY 
(Ms. SCANLON asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Ms. SCANLON. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to share the success of a 
young constituent from my district 
whose story should make us all proud. 
Julia Tyler is a 24-year-old young 
woman with Down syndrome. Several 
years ago with the support of her par-
ents, her school district, and a job 
coach, Julia was able to land a job at a 
local boutique in preparation for her 
transition to the working world after 
graduation from high school. With the 
help of her job coach, she began design-
ing totes, pillows, and table runners. 
She learned how to silkscreen geo-
metric designs onto this merchandise 
so she could then sell them at the bou-
tique where she worked and at local 
craft fairs. The boutique owner took 
notice of Julia’s creativity and deter-
mination, and together they cofounded 
a new company, Dance Happy, to mar-
ket Julia’s creations. 
In 2019, a subsidiary of American 
Eagle began selling Julia’s totes online 
for the holiday season. They quickly 
sold out, and a bigger order has been 
placed for 2020. 
I am so pleased to celebrate the suc-
cess of Julia, Dance Happy, her job 
coach, and her business partner at 
Compendium Boutique. Together they 
provide an important reminder of what 
can happen when we look beyond a per-
son’s disability and work together to 
provide opportunities for all. I am also 
pleased to have a successful new busi-
ness in Pennsylvania’s Fifth Congres-
sional District, a business that started 
in Swarthmore and is now housed in 
Aston, Pennsylvania. 
Their success is also a great example 
of how the IDEA and well-funded, effec-
tive special education can prepare stu-
dents with disabilities for employment 
in our communities.

APPROVING 
REQUEST 
OF 
SEC-
RETARY OF VETERANS AFFAIRS 
FOR 
WAIVER 
UNDER 
SECTION 
1703E(f) 
OF 
TITLE 
38, 
UNITED 
STATES CODE 
Mr. TAKANO. Madam Speaker, I 
move to suspend the rules and pass the 
joint resolution (H.J. Res. 80) approv-
ing the request of the Secretary of Vet-
erans Affairs for a waiver under section 
1703E(f) of title 38, United States Code. 
The Clerk read the title of the joint 
resolution. 
The text of the joint resolution is as 
follows: 
H.J. RES. 80 
Resolved by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, That Congress approves 
the request for a waiver under section 
1703E(f) of title 38, United States Code, as 
submitted by the Secretary on December 6, 
2019. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from 
California (Mr. TAKANO) and the gen-
tleman from Tennessee (Mr. DAVID P. 
ROE) each will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from California. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. TAKANO. Madam Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days in which to 
revise and extend their remarks and to 
insert extraneous material on H.J. Res. 
80. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from California? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. TAKANO. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in support of 
H.J. Res. 80 introduced by Representa-
tive ROE
of Tennessee, the ranking 
member of the Committee on Veterans’ 
Affairs. 
This resolution would grant VA lim-
ited authority to conduct a dental 
health access pilot, which VA has pro-
posed under section 152 of the VA MIS-
SION Act of 2018. 
Under section 152, VA can pilot 
healthcare payment and service deliv-
ery models through its Center for Inno-
vation for Care and Payment. 
On December 6, 2019, VA submitted a 
section 152 report to Congress pro-
posing the Care Coordination for Den-
tal Benefits program. 
Through this pilot, VA would refer 
veterans who are ineligible for dental 
benefits to private providers or com-
munity programs that offer pro bono or 
discounted dental services. VA will not 
pay private providers for the cost of 
these services under the pilot. To carry 
out this dental referral service, the sec-
tion 152 report contained a request that 
Congress narrowly exempt or ‘‘waive’’ 
VA’s authorizing statute. 
When a section 152 report contains a 
request from VA to ‘‘waive’’ its author-
izing statute, Congress must pass a 
joint resolution to approve a waiver so 
VA can proceed with a pilot program. 
By passing this joint resolution, we are 
approving VA’s waiver request so it 
can pilot the referral of veterans for 
free or low-cost dental care. 
Madam Speaker, currently VA pro-
vides dental services for only about 8 
percent of veterans who are enrolled in 
the VA healthcare system. Generally, 
to receive dental care at VA’s expense, 
veterans must have a dental condition 
that is related to a service-connected 
disability, be a former prisoner of war, 
be rated as 100 percent permanently 
and totally disabled, or need dental 
services in preparation for a hospital 
admission. 
Under this pilot, VA will be able to 
coordinate dental care for the remain-
ing 92 percent of veterans ineligible for 
dental care. Specifically, VA will pro-
vide 
administrative 
support 
poten-
tially through a call center and online 
self-service portal to educate and assist 
these veterans in accessing community 
programs and providers that offer pro 
bono or discounted dental services. Ac-
cording to VA, community dental pro-
grams are available through federally 
qualified health centers, community 
health centers, and the American Den-
tal Association. 
Through this pilot, VA staff will be 
able to assist veterans in scheduling 
appointments with dentists that par-
ticipate in these programs. VA staff 
will be authorized to obtain records 
from the dental visits and provide 
them to veterans’ VA primary care 
providers. 
I support granting VA this limited 
waiver because it will not permit VA to 
outsource more healthcare to private 
providers beyond its current authority, 
and it will not drain precious resources 
from VA hospitals and clinics. 
I support this pilot because it has the 
potential to improve veterans’ access 
to dental care, and to improve the 
timeliness of that care. Neglecting oral 
health can have serious medical con-
sequences. For example, clinical re-
searchers have identified links between 
poor oral health and other medical con-
ditions such as heart disease, bacterial 
pneumonia, and stroke. 
VA estimates this pilot will be cost 
neutral, as there will be cost savings 
from reducing emergency department 
visits associated with delayed treat-
ment or nontreatment of oral health 
issues. 
I urge all of my colleagues to join me 
in supporting H.J. Res. 80. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. DAVID P. ROE of Tennessee. 
Madam Speaker, I yield myself such 
time as I may consume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today in sup-
port of H.J. Res. 80, approving the re-
quest of the Secretary of Veterans Af-
fairs for a waiver under the law estab-
lished by the VA MISSION Act of 2018. 
Specifically, this bill would approve 
VA’s first request for a waiver under 
section 152, as the chairman men-
tioned, the authority for the Depart-
ment of Veterans Affairs Center for In-
novation for Care and Payment con-
tained within the VA MISSION Act of 
2018. 
The MISSION Act is one of the most 
transformative pieces of legislation 
passed in recent history. Over the next 
several years, given the authorities 
provided in the MISSION Act, the VA 
healthcare system that we know today 
will evolve into one that is stronger, 
more efficient, and better able to meet 
the healthcare needs of veterans now 
and for generations of veterans to 
come. 
In addition to streamlining numerous 
community 
care 
programs, 
estab-
lishing a process to review and mod-
ernize VA assets and infrastructure, 
expanding the caregiver program, and 
enhancing the internal capacity of the 
VA healthcare, the MISSION Act cre-
ated a Center for Innovation for Care 
and Payment. 
The Innovation Center is charged 
with establishing pilot programs de-
signed to test potential payment and 
service delivery models, models cur-
rently not in VA’s authority to pursue 
without a waiver, with the goal of re-
ducing expenditures while preserving 
or enhancing the quality and access to 
care furnished by VA. 
Under the terms of the MISSION Act, 
the joint resolution we are considering 
today meets the requirements set forth 
in law with regard to approving waiv-
ers. The substance of this waiver is 
very modest. It will allow VA to ex-
pand its role in assisting veterans who 
aren’t eligible for VA-provided dental 
care by establishing a pilot program to 
connect 
veterans 
with 
community- 
based discounted or pro bono dentists. 
The objective of the pilot is to im-
prove the overall health of currently 
enrolled veterans who are ineligible for 
VA dental services. The waiver specifi-
cally allows VA administrative staff to 
coordinate community-provided care 
while also educating veterans on the 
dental care options available to them 
within the community. 
This proposed pilot is a commonsense 
approach to improving the wellness of 
veterans. Research has shown that poor 
oral health can have a significant im-
pact on overall health with numerous 
connections between gum disease and 
other illnesses. Poor oral health is also 
correlated with potentially avoidable 
and costly emergency department vis-
its. 
Additionally, the approval of this 
waiver holds open the opportunity for 
VA to pursue other ideas that can en-
hance the care and services provided to 
veterans while also respecting the re-
sources provided by the American tax-
payer. 
I look forward to working with the 
VA through the Center of Innovation

H186 
January 13, 2020 
in identifying additional out-of-the-box 
approaches 
that 
could 
potentially 
transform the VA even further for the 
future. 
I thank Chairman TAKANO for work-
ing with me to get this joint resolution 
to the House floor in a timely manner. 
I urge all of my colleagues to support 
H.J. Res. 80, and I reserve the balance 
of my time. 
Mr. TAKANO. Madam Speaker, I 
have no further speakers, and I am pre-
pared to close. 
I reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. DAVID P. ROE of Tennessee. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to 
the gentleman from Florida (Mr. BILI-
RAKIS), my good friend and a great 
friend of the Veterans’ Affairs Com-
mittee. There has been no more con-
sistent member of that committee, who 
has numerous advocates, and I really 
appreciate his support of this joint res-
olution. 
Mr. BILIRAKIS. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman for yielding. It 
has been a great experience to work 
with Representatives ROE and TAKANO 
to improve the lives of our heroes. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today in sup-
port of H.J. Res. 80, which will approve 
the VA secretary’s request for a waiver 
under the MISSION Act, allowing for 
innovative collaborations to expand 
dental care for veterans. 
As a member of the Veterans’ Affairs 
Committee, I was proud to be a strong 
advocate in support of the VA MIS-
SION Act last Congress. One of the pro-
visions of this new law established the 
VA Center for Innovation for Care and 
Payment, allowing the VA to create 
pilot programs that test innovative ap-
proaches to payment and service deliv-
ery models to improve the quality of 
care at the VA subject to congressional 
approval. 
Many studies suggest that regular 
dental care, as the good doctor said, 
equates to lower overall healthcare 
cost and better health outcomes. Ear-
lier this year I introduced H.R. 2628, 
the VET CARE Act, designed to deter-
mine the potential health benefits to 
veterans and potential cost savings to 
the VA associated with periodontal 
care. One provision specifically author-
izes the VA to provide administrative 
support to local providers who agree to 
furnish dental care at low to no cost, 
including information about the VA 
Dental Insurance Program, which pro-
vides a discounted low-cost insurance 
plan provided by private insurers. At a 
legislative hearing on my bill, the VA 
testified its strong support for this par-
ticular section. 
Currently, the VA only provides out-
patient dental services to a limited 
number of the disabled veteran popu-
lation. Some may be eligible to sign up 
for the VADIP, but I believe we can do 
more to move this issue forward and I 
am glad to see that the VA agrees with 
me on this particular issue. 
Last month, the VA finalized a rule 
requesting congressional approval to 
allow coordination of care between vet-
erans and dental providers in the com-
munity. 
I applaud VA for recognizing the need 
to increase access and coordination of 
care to dental providers and educate 
veterans on the potential opportunities 
available to them in the local commu-
nity. 
I thank Dr. ROE for sponsoring this 
joint resolution, and I urge the Senate 
to take this up as soon as possible so 
that the VA can get to implementing 
this pilot program and better providing 
access to much-needed dental care our 
veterans have earned and deserve. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to support this joint resolu-
tion. 
Mr. DAVID P. ROE of Tennessee. 
Madam Speaker, I yield myself the bal-
ance of my time. 
Madam Speaker, this is a very simple 
resolution. I urge all of my colleagues 
to support H.J. Res. 80, and I yield back 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. TAKANO. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
As we welcome the new year and a 
new decade, I also want to take a mo-
ment to recognize my colleague and 
ranking member of the Committee on 
Veterans’ Affairs, Dr. PHIL ROE, who 
has announced he will be retiring at 
the end of this Congress. 
I salute my friend as a Vietnam vet-
eran, as a doctor, and as a tireless ad-
vocate for veterans across the country. 
I have served with Dr. ROE since I was 
first elected to the House of Represent-
atives in 2013, and I am proud of the bi-
partisan work we have done since then 
to ensure we honor our Nation’s com-
mitment to our veterans. 
Madam Speaker, this Congress alone, 
we have passed 40 bills out of this com-
mittee with 36 passed out of the House 
and five signed into law. Despite the 
political rancor, which takes up much 
of the oxygen in Washington, D.C., this 
committee has set the standard for bi-
partisanship in this body. 
In 2015, though I was still fairly new 
to this committee, then-Chairman ROE 
invited several Members to join him on 
a congressional delegation to Afghani-
stan to meet with servicemembers over 
the Thanksgiving holiday. He set a 
great example, and I have worked to 
replicate that example during my time 
as chairman. This past Thanksgiving, 
we did just that. I took freshmen Mem-
bers to spend the holidays with those 
away from their families in service to 
our country. 
b 1645 
During Dr. ROE’s tenure as chairman 
of this committee, he was gracious in 
approving travel to the border so I 
could better understand the issues fac-
ing deported veterans. Following that 
trip, I, along with fellow members 
Ranking Member Tim Walz and Rep-
resentatives VARGAS and COFFMAN, re-
quested additional information from 
the Department of Homeland Security 
on this veteran population. 
As a result, we learned that ICE did 
not know how many veterans it had de-
ported and failed to follow policies al-
ready in place that could have shielded 
veterans from deportation. 
Dr. ROE also has built on the hard 
work of former Ranking Member Walz 
and helped lay the groundwork for our 
success in finally passing the Blue 
Water Navy Vietnam Veterans Act of 
2019. He helped me bring this long-over-
due legislation across the finish line, 
and I trust that he will continue to 
work with me to ensure our true intent 
of the law is implemented. 
Madam Speaker, we have always 
worked to find common areas of agree-
ment. Because of his agreement to in-
clude key protections for whistle-
blowers in the last Congress’ VA Ac-
countability and Whistleblower Protec-
tion Act of 2017, I reluctantly sup-
ported that legislation, but it is clear 
today that these protections are no-
where near as strong as they should be. 
I hope Dr. ROE will join me in pressing 
this administration to implement these 
to their true intent and help ensure 
whistleblowers can come forward when 
they need to, free from retaliation. 
Madam Speaker, I thank Dr. ROE for 
supporting this committee’s bipartisan 
work to preserve the power of veterans’ 
voices 
and 
combat 
online 
disinformation campaigns perpetrated 
by foreign trolls and internet actors. I 
look forward to working with him to 
continue to speak with a unified voice 
and help prevent the targeting of vet-
erans and servicemembers. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
I 
congratulate 
Ranking Member ROE on more than 11 
years of hard work for the people of 
Tennessee and decades of service to our 
country. 
It is my hope that, despite it being 
an election year, we can continue to 
come together and finish our work for 
our Nation’s veterans. 
Madam Speaker, I ask that all of my 
colleagues join me in honoring Dr. ROE 
for his many years of service but also 
in passing H.J. Res. 80. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from California (Mr. 
TAKANO) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the joint resolution, H.J. 
Res. 80. 
The question was taken; and (two- 
thirds being in the affirmative) the 
rules were suspended and the joint res-
olution was passed. 
A motion to reconsider was laid on 
the table.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H187 
January 13, 2020 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 4302 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Homeless 
Assistance Act of 2019’’. 
SEC. 2. LIMITED AUTHORITY TO SHARE INFOR-
MATION REGARDING HOMELESS IN-
DIVIDUALS AND FAMILIES WITH AP-
PROPRIATE ENTITY WITHIN CON-
TINUUM OF CARE. 
Section 2 of the United States Housing Act 
of 1937 (42 U.S.C. 1437) is amended by adding 
at the end the following new subsection: 
‘‘(c) LIMITED AUTHORITY TO SHARE INFOR-
MATION
REGARDING
HOMELESS
INDIVIDUALS 
AND
FAMILIES
WITH
APPROPRIATE
ENTITY 
WITHIN
CONTINUUM
OF
CARE.—Notwith-
standing section 904 of the Stewart B. 
McKinney Homeless Assistance Amendments 
Act of 1988 (42 U.S.C. 3544), a public housing 
agency may disclose, to the collaborative ap-
plicant of the local Continuum of Care or 
designee of the collaborative applicant with-
in which the jurisdiction of the public hous-
ing agency is located, information regarding 
individuals and families who are homeless 
(as such term is used in section 103 of the 
McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act 
(42 U.S.C. 11302)) or at risk of homelessness 
(as such term is used in section 401 of such 
Act (42 U.S.C. 11360)), but only— 
‘‘(1) for the purpose of facilitating the iden-
tification, assessment, and linkage of hous-
ing and supportive services for such individ-
uals and families to ensure continuity of 
care, to the extent allowable under State 
Law; 
‘‘(2) if the public housing agency takes ap-
propriate measures to ensure that the pri-
vacy of the individuals and families is pro-
tected and that the information, including 
any personally identifiable information, is 
used only for the purpose described in para-
graph (1); and 
‘‘(3) if the public housing agency takes ap-
propriate measures to ensure clients’ infor-
mation and confidentiality is protected pur-
suant to section 41411(c)(4) of the Violence 
Against Women Act of 1994 (34 U.S.C. 
12491(c)(4)), and any regulations promulgated 
pursuant to such section.’’. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from 
Guam (Mr. SAN NICOLAS) and the gen-
tleman from Arkansas (Mr. HILL) each 
will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from Guam. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. SAN NICOLAS. Madam Speaker, 
I ask unanimous consent that all Mem-
bers may have 5 legislative days within 
which to revise and extend their re-
marks on this legislation and to insert 
extraneous material thereon. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Guam? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. SAN NICOLAS. Madam Speaker, 
I yield myself as much time as I may 
consume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in strong sup-
port of H.R. 4302, the Homeless Assist-
ance Act of 2019. This bill would allow 
public housing agencies to share data 
exclusively with local continuums of 
care to better coordinate housing and 
supportive services for people experi-
encing homelessness. 
Homelessness has reached a crisis 
level in our country and continues to 
grow. According to HUD’s newly re-
leased point-in-time count, over 568,000 
people have experienced homelessness 
on any given night in 2019, representing 
a 3 percent increase from the previous 
year. California, for example, saw a 21 
percent increase in homelessness and 
the city of Los Angeles saw a 13 per-
cent increase. 
These homelessness issues, Madam 
Speaker, extend not just throughout 
our 50 United States but into our var-
ious territories as well. 
Given the growing crisis, we need 
every tool in the toolbox to help. Shar-
ing data between local agencies to help 
coordinate housing placements and 
services is one of those tools. 
While local governments are working 
hard to help people experiencing home-
lessness, bureaucracy can get in the 
way. Individuals often have to resub-
mit the same information and paper-
work to various local agencies when 
seeking assistance, which can delay or 
prevent them from getting the help 
they need. 
H.R. 4302, the Homeless Assistance 
Act, would help remove this barrier so 
that public housing authorities and 
continuums of care can share data and 
target appropriate interventions to im-
prove the collaboration and coordina-
tion of housing and supportive services. 
This type of information sharing and 
coordination can ultimately help re-
duce the overall number of people expe-
riencing homelessness. In fact, re-
search from the Pew Institute dem-
onstrated that data sharing among 
agencies reduced the number of vet-
erans experiencing homelessness. 
This legislation also takes a special 
precaution to ensure the privacy of in-
dividuals whose information is being 
shared, especially victims of domestic 
violence. It is not made public. 
Madam Speaker, I thank my col-
league, Mr. SHERMAN, for introducing 
this critical legislation, which I know 
will be very helpful to local entities 
across the country that are doing ev-
erything they can to deal with the 
homelessness crisis. 
Madam Speaker, I urge all Members 
to vote ‘‘yes’’ on this important meas-
ure, and I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. 
HILL 
of 
Arkansas. 
Madam 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
I rise in support of H.R. 4302, the 
Homeless Assistance Act. 
Madam Speaker, homelessness is a 
very real problem across this country. 
In fact, more than half a million indi-
viduals are homeless on any given 
night in America. 
From cities like my own of Little 
Rock, Arkansas, to big metropolitan 
areas like Los Angeles, New York, and 
San Francisco, State and local govern-
ments have been unable to address this 
devastating human crisis fully. 
Last year, the committee held sev-
eral 
hearings 
on 
homelessness. 
Throughout our hearings, the com-
mittee explored some of the root 
causes of homelessness, including re-
strictive local zoning policies, the 
harsh and punitive treatment of indi-
viduals who have no other place to 
turn, and the counterproductive Fed-
eral mandates on shelter providers that 
will close, not open, doors to people 
who are truly in need. 
The bill we have before us today, 
H.R. 4302, is designed to help prevent 
high-risk, vulnerable populations from 
ever becoming homeless. 
The bill allows local public housing 
agencies to share data and coordinate 
with other State and local government 
agencies and their local partnering 
service providers. 
Madam Speaker, I enjoyed working 
with the majority on this, and I thank 
my friends for helping protect that pri-
vate data. The personally identifiable 
information was of concern to the mi-
nority, and I am grateful for the major-
ity helping improve this bill to protect 
that private data of these Americans 
struggling with homelessness. 
But by sharing this data, these enti-
ties can help target and deliver sup-
portive services to these vulnerable 
populations before they are displaced 
from their current housing situation. 
Sharing this data will, we hope, help 
localities better coordinate to prevent 
problems before they occur and keep 
more individuals in stable housing en-
vironments and off our streets. 
Madam Speaker, I thank my friend 
from California, Mr. SHERMAN, the 
sponsor of this legislation, for his work 
in this area. I thank the chairwoman of 
the full committee, who has prioritized 
fighting homelessness since she was 
elected to Congress. I thank my friend 
from Guam for managing the time on 
this important bill. 
Madam Speaker, I recommend that 
my colleagues support H.R. 4302, and I 
yield back the balance of my time. 
Mr. SAN NICOLAS. Madam Speaker, 
I yield myself the balance of my time. 
H.R. 4302 is important legislation 
that will better assist local agencies in 
coordinating and providing services to 
people experiencing homelessness. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to join me in supporting this 
important piece of legislation. I thank 
our colleagues on the other side of the 
aisle for their support as well. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
Ms. JOHNSON of Texas. Madam Speaker, 
today, I rise in support of H.R. 4302, the 
Homeless Assistance Act of 2019, which au-
thorizes Public Housing Agencies to disclose 
relevant client information to local government 
entities and nonprofits. This legislation will en-
able communities to better facilitate housing 
and services for individuals and families expe-
riencing homelessness, and it will also require 
these agencies to prioritize suitable privacy 
measures for their clients. 
This bill will address the challenge of coordi-
nation with local entities who provide housing 
and unique services to individuals and families 
experiencing homelessness. The Federal Pri-
vacy Act limits the ability of Public Housing

Agencies to share critical and timely informa-
tion with their community partners, thus cre-
ating an unnecessary barrier for individuals 
seeking assistance by requiring them to resub-
mit the same information and paperwork to 
multiple entities. 
The Homeless Assistance Act will allow 
agencies to share relevant client data with 
local government entities and nonprofits, sole-
ly for the purpose of expediting the identifica-
tion, assessment, and linkage of individuals 
experiencing homelessness to housing and 
supportive services. 
As founder and co-chair of the Congres-
sional Homelessness Caucus, I am proud to 
support the advancement of resources and ca-
pabilities needed to address housing insecurity 
and access to affordable housing in our com-
munities.

question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from Guam (Mr. SAN 
NICOLAS) that the House suspend the

8–K TRADING GAP ACT OF 2019 
Mr. SAN NICOLAS. Madam Speaker, 
I move to suspend the rules and pass 
the bill (H.R. 4335) to amend the Secu-
rities Exchange Act of 1934 to require 
the Securities and Exchange Commis-
sion to issue rules that prohibit offi-
cers and directors of certain companies 
from trading securities in anticipation 
of a current report, and for other pur-
poses, as amended. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 4335 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘8–K Trading

SEC. 2. PROHIBITION ON CERTAIN TRADING IN

The Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (15 
U.S.C. 78a et seq.) is amended by inserting 
after section 10D the following: 
‘‘SEC. 10E. PROHIBITION ON CERTAIN TRADING

GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. SAN NICOLAS. Madam Speaker, 
I ask unanimous consent that all Mem-
bers may have 5 legislative days within 
which to revise and extend their re-
marks on this legislation and to insert 
extraneous material thereon. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Guam? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. SAN NICOLAS. Madam Speaker, 
I yield myself as much time as I may 
consume. 
Madam Speaker, I thank Representa-
tive MALONEY, the chair of the Com-
mittee on Oversight and Reform and a 
member of the Financial Services Com-
mittee, for authoring H.R. 4335, the 8–K 
Trading Gap Act, a commonsense bill 
that would close a loophole in our secu-
rities laws that has been exploited by 
corporate insiders. 
Currently, public companies must 
disclose significant corporate events, 
such as bankruptcy or major cyberse-
curity hacks, to investors and the pub-
lic on Form 8–K. However, the law 
gives them 4 business days after the 
event occurs to make this disclosure. 
As a result, corporate executives have 
the benefit of knowing material, non-
public information for 4 days before in-
vestors and the rest of the public. 
This is a problem because there is no 
rule prohibiting these executives from 
buying or selling the company’s securi-
ties during this 4-day gap, and there is 
evidence that certain executives have 
done so and profited handsomely. Ac-
cording to a 2015 study, over a 6-year 
period, insiders who traded during this 
4-day gap successfully earned $105 mil-
lion in above-market returns on these 
trades. 
H.R. 4335, the 8–K Trading Gap Act, 
fixes this loophole by requiring public 
companies to put in place policies and 
procedures that are reasonably de-
signed to prohibit officers and directors 
from trading company stock after the 
company has determined that a signifi-
cant corporate event has occurred and 
before the company has filed a Form 8– 
K disclosing such event. 
I support this commonsense fix and 
encourage my colleagues to join me in 
supporting the bill. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. 
HILL 
of 
Arkansas. 
Madam 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
I rise in support of H.R. 4335, the 8–K 
Trading Gap Act of 2019. 
Madam Speaker, I thank my friend, 
the gentlewoman from New York, Con-
gresswoman MALONEY, and her staff for 
her efforts on this bill and for working 
with Republicans to make this a bipar-
tisan bill. 
Madam Speaker, we all agree that 
fraud and abuse, such as illegal insider 
trading, have no place in our financial 
system. Bad actors damage the integ-
rity, efficiency, and effectiveness of 
our markets, which in turn hurts ev-
eryday investors. 
b 1700 
When significant corporation events 
occur, such as the appointment of a 
new chief financial officer, public com-
panies must disclose these events to 
shareholders and to the public on form 
8–K. This form must be filed within 4 
business days of that significant event. 
It is reasonable to believe that com-
pany insiders may have knowledge of 
the event or material, nonpublic infor-
mation days before that same informa-
tion is disclosed to the general public 
and shareholders. 
Most companies and their executives 
strive to operate within the law. Trad-
ing within that period is clearly ille-
gal. However, there is no SEC rule that 
explicitly prohibits insiders from buy-
ing or selling company stock during

this 4-business-day gap, which starts at 
the time the event occurred and ends 
with the filing of form 8–K in which in-
formation about the event is then dis-
closed to the public. 
Simply put, that is what this meas-
ure does. The bill before us today pro-
hibits executive insiders from profit-
ably trading in their company’s stock 
while in possession of material, non-
public information stemming from a 
yet-to-be-disclosed event. 
At the same time, the bill also pro-
vides appropriately tailored exemp-
tions for companies not intended to be 
covered by the bill, such as registered 
funds or business development corpora-
tions. 
In addition, the bill provides flexi-
bility to companies by allowing for an-
nouncements via press releases while 
not requiring the immediate filing of 
form 8–K. 
Again, I thank our chair of the Over-
sight and Reform Committee, a former 
loyal and longstanding member of the 
House Committee on Financial Serv-
ices, and her staff for her diligent ef-
forts in working across the aisle to 
draft and design this bipartisan bill 
that strikes the right balance of 
strengthening our securities laws while 
tailoring the bill to minimize unin-
tended and unnecessary application. 
Madam Speaker, I urge all of my col-
leagues to join me in supporting this 
well-balanced piece of legislation, and I 
reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. SAN NICOLAS. Madam Speaker, 
I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman 
from New York (Mrs. CAROLYN
B. 
MALONEY), chairwoman of the Over-
sight and Reform Committee and the 
sponsor of this legislation. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Madam Speaker, I rise in strong 
support of this bill, the 8–K Trading 
Gap Act. I thank Mr. SAN NICOLAS for 
yielding and for his leadership on the 
committee, and, of course, Chairwoman 
WATERS. 
This bill would fix a loophole in our 
current law that allows corporate ex-
ecutives to trade on information before 
it is disclosed to the public and to their 
own shareholders. 
Right now, when there is a signifi-
cant corporate event in a public com-
pany, the company has to disclose that 
event to the public by filing a form 8– 
K within 4 days of the event occurring. 
Of course, during this 4-day gap, execu-
tives at the company know about the 
significant event, but other investors 
do not. 
There has been research from aca-
demics at Columbia Law School and 
Harvard Law School that shows that 
executives do actually trade in this 4- 
day gap and profit significantly from 
it. In fact, one of the authors of this 
study was Robert Jackson, who is now 
an SEC Commissioner. 
Commissioner Jackson brought this 
issue to my attention when he was still 
an academic, and I would like to thank 
him for his hard work on this issue. 
My bill would address this problem 
by simply prohibiting executives from 
trading during this 4-day gap that they 
know about and the public doesn’t, 
which is clearly illegal. 
When SEC Chairman Clayton testi-
fied before the Financial Services Com-
mittee, I asked him about this bill. He 
said that he thought it was ‘‘good cor-
porate hygiene that, once a determina-
tion has been made that there is a ma-
terial event to disclose, that the com-
pany’s insider trading policy . . . would 
have a control in there where the sen-
ior executives would not be allowed to 
trade.’’ 
This is basically an endorsement of 
this bill. That is exactly what my bill 
would do, and I think it is just plain 
common sense. 
I very much want to thank Ranking 
Members 
MCHENRY, 
HUIZENGA, 
and 
HILL for their work with me on this 
bill, and I would also like to thank 
Chairwoman WATERS for her support. 
I urge my colleagues to support it. It 
is a commonsense, good-government 
bill. It will help investors and help the 
entire system. 
Mr. 
HILL 
of 
Arkansas. 
Madam 
Speaker, I am prepared to close. I urge 
my colleagues to support Mrs. MALO-
NEY’s good work. I thank my friend 
from Guam for his leadership, and I 
yield back the balance of my time. 
Mr. SAN NICOLAS. Madam Speaker, 
I yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, investor confidence 
and market integrity are built on the 
premise that our markets are fair and 
transparent. H.R. 4335 will help ensure 
that this is the case by preventing cor-
porate insiders from unfairly taking 
advantage 
of 
significant 
corporate 
events before they are disclosed to the 
public. 
For that reason, the bill is supported 
by investor groups, like the Council of 
Institutional Investors, as well as our 
State securities regulators, which are 
represented by the North American Se-
curities Administrators Association. 
Madam Speaker, I urge all of my col-
leagues to join me in their support of 
H.R. 4335. I thank our colleagues on the 
other side of the aisle for their support. 
With 
publicly 
traded 
companies, 
Madam Speaker, nobody should have 
an advantage over the public. I yield 
back the balance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from Guam (Mr. SAN 
NICOLAS) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 4335, as 
amended. 
The question was taken. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the 
opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being 
in the affirmative, the ayes have it. 
Mr. SAN NICOLAS. Madam Speaker, 
on that I demand the yeas and nays. 
The yeas and nays were ordered. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to clause 8 of rule XX, further pro-
ceedings on this motion will be post-
poned. 
PRUDENTIAL REGULATOR 
OVERSIGHT ACT 
Ms. WATERS. Madam Speaker, I 
move to suspend the rules and pass the 
bill (H.R. 4841) to require the pruden-
tial banking regulators to provide an-
nual testimony to Congress on their

SEC. 3. DETERMINATION OF BUDGETARY EF-

The budgetary effects of this Act, for the 
purpose of complying with the Statutory

mined by reference to the latest statement 
titled ‘‘Budgetary Effects of PAYGO Legisla-
tion’’ for this Act, submitted for printing in 
the Congressional Record by the Chairman of 
the House Budget Committee, provided that 
such statement has been submitted prior to 
the vote on passage. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentlewoman from 
California (Ms. WATERS) and the gen-
tleman from Arkansas (Mr. HILL) each 
will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from California. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Ms. WATERS. Madam Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
have 5 legislative days within which to 
revise and extend their remarks on this 
legislation and to insert extraneous 
material thereon. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from California? 
There was no objection. 
Ms. WATERS. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in strong sup-
port of H.R. 4841, the Prudential Regu-
lator Oversight Act, which is sponsored 
by Representative DEAN
Phillips of 
Minnesota, one of our new members of 
the 
Financial 
Services 
Committee. 
Through Representative PHILLIPS’ good 
work, this is a bipartisan bill. 
H.R. 4841 would require the pruden-
tial regulators, specifically, the Board 
of Governors of the Federal Reserve 
System, the Office of the Comptroller 
of the Currency, the Federal Deposit 
Insurance Corporation, and the Na-
tional Credit Union Administration to 
report semiannually to and testify an-
nually before Congress on their super-
visory and regulatory activities. 
The Federal Reserve Vice Chairman 
for Supervision would continue to tes-
tify 
semiannually 
before 
Congress, 
though the new annual testimony man-
date would satisfy one of the semi-
annual requirements. 
While the OCC, FDIC, NCUA cur-
rently do not have a mandatory testi-
mony requirement like the Federal Re-
serve, receiving periodic testimony 
from all four agencies would allow for 
a comprehensive examination of the 
state of prudential regulation, super-
vision, and enforcement with respect to 
megabanks and other depository insti-
tutions. 
These reports and testimony will en-
hance the committee’s efforts to over-
see the regulators’ work on a range of 
issues, including their efforts to hold 
megabanks accountable and promote 
diversity and inclusion. 
I will highlight that Representative 
PHILLIPS made a few improvements to 
the bill to ensure that no confidential 
supervisory information is disclosed. 
The changes would still ensure Con-
gress gets important aggregate data 
and general trends on supervisory con-
cerns, like Matters Requiring Atten-
tion and Matters Requiring Immediate 
Attention, that apply to the industry 
or segments of the industry. 
It is also worth noting that before 
Democrats took the House majority in 
2019 and provided vigorous oversight of 
these prudential regulators, it had been 
more than 3 years since either the 
FDIC or the NCUA testified before the 
Financial Services Committee. 
Congress must not neglect its over-
sight duties, so H.R. 4841 will help en-
sure that we have robust and regular 
oversight of our prudential regulators. 
Madam Speaker, I urge Members to 
support this legislation, and I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. 
HILL 
of 
Arkansas. 
Madam 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
Madam Speaker, first of all, happy 
new year to our chairwoman of the full 
committee. I am glad to see the gentle-
woman on the floor today on this good 
set of bills that she has worked hard to 
produce, a bipartisan solution to so 
many important topics. 
I rise in support of H.R. 4841 today, 
and I thank the gentleman from Min-
nesota (Mr. PHILLIPS) and the gen-
tleman from Georgia (Mr. LOUDERMILK) 
for offering this legislation. 
If there is one key point that the Re-
publicans and Democrats can agree on 
in the post-2008 crisis, it is that in-
creased dialogue and transparency on 
safety and soundness of institutions, 
and monitoring emerging risks and po-
tential threats to financial stability, 
can better promote understanding of 
the most concerning issues facing our 
American financial system, the broader 
economy, and how to make sure that 
America can keep its leadership in the 
world in competitive financial services. 
Certainly, an active Financial Sta-
bility Oversight Council is an example 
of that, and this measure, H.R. 4841, is 
a key tool as well. 
It will require Federal financial regu-
lators to appear at least annually be-
fore the House Financial Services Com-
mittee and the Senate Banking Com-
mittee to provide testimony on their 
oversight of financial institutions, in-
cluding regulatory, supervisory, and 
enforcement activities. 
Under this bill, the regulators will 
also be required to produce semiannual 
reports to Congress on these efforts. 
Although the Federal Reserve Chair-
man, the Federal Reserve Vice Chair-
man for Supervision, and the Director 
of the Consumer Financial Protection 
Bureau are required to testify before 
Congress 
semiannually, 
similar 
re-
quirements do not exist for the Comp-
troller of the Currency, the Chair of

the FDIC, or the Chair of the National 
Credit Union Administration. 
Last year, the principals from the 
prudential regulatory agencies, the 
OCC, the FDIC, and National Credit 
Union Administration, willingly and 
happily testified alongside the Federal 
Reserve Vice Chair for Supervision dur-
ing his statutorily required appear-
ance. 
Committee 
Republicans 
recognize 
that it is good practice to have open 
and regular conversations with our 
prudential regulators on topics con-
cerning the integrity of the U.S. and 
global financial systems. This practice 
is important, regardless of which party 
is in power. 
Merger and acquisition trends, BSA/ 
AML exams, fintech, Bank Secrecy 
Act, anti-money-laundering exams and 
trends, the use of financial technology, 
cyber threats and planning for cyber 
protection and compliance issues, gen-
erally, all of these are important top-
ics. 
I thank the gentleman from Min-
nesota for working in a bipartisan way 
to address some modest concerns the 
Republicans had with the initial draft. 
We were able to make simple changes 
that clarify the parameters for the re-
lease of information by Federal bank-
ing regulators. 
This result is a bill focused on good 
government 
and 
increased 
trans-
parency. I thank the gentleman from 
Minnesota 
and 
his 
colleague, 
Mr. 
LOUDERMILK from Georgia. I urge my 
colleagues to support H.R. 4841, and I 
reserve the balance of my time. 
Ms. WATERS. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. 
HILL 
of 
Arkansas. 
Madam 
Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gen-
tleman from Ohio (Mr. GONZALEZ), my 
good friend who supports this legisla-
tion. 
Mr. GONZALEZ of Ohio. Madam 
Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 4841, 
the Prudential Regulator Oversight 
Act. I was pleased to cosponsor this bill 
introduced by my good friend and col-
league, Mr. DEAN PHILLIPS. 
The Federal Reserve, NCUA, FDIC, 
and OCC play a vital role in developing 
a regulatory framework that promotes 
economic growth and sound regulator 
policies in all of our communities. 
It is important that these regulator 
bodies hear from Members on both 
sides of the aisle on how different pol-
icy decisions will impact our constitu-
ents. It is also important that Members 
of Congress ask questions and provide 
oversight on the regulators’ activities. 
H.R. 4841 will require the prudential 
regulators to come before the Finan-
cial Services Committee and Senate 
Banking Committee on an annual 
basis. They will also support various 
reports to the committees of jurisdic-
tion twice a year. 
b 1715 
This includes reports on issues like 
soundness of depository institutions, 
compliance 
with 
anti-money 
laun-
dering, and the utilization of fintech at 
financial institutions. This will help 
lawmakers better understand trends in 
the financial industry and identify po-
tential policy proposals in response to 
issues facing our country. 
Again, I want to thank Congressman 
PHILLIPS for his hard work on this bill 
and thank Chairwoman WATERS
and 
Ranking Member MCHENRY for bring-
ing it to the floor today. I encourage 
my colleagues to support this legisla-
tion. 
Mr. 
HILL 
of 
Arkansas. 
Madam 
Speaker, I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Ms. WATERS. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from 
Minnesota (Mr. PHILLIPS), a valuable 
member of the Financial Services Com-
mittee and the sponsor of this legisla-
tion. 
Mr. PHILLIPS. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentlewoman from Cali-
fornia for yielding and for her leader-
ship of the House Financial Services 
Committee and my friend and col-
league from Ohio (Mr. GONZALEZ) for 
his kind words about this bill. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today in sup-
port of my bill, H.R. 4841, the bipar-
tisan Prudential Regulator Oversight 
Act. 
In the United States, we have thou-
sands of institutions where millions of 
people go every day to do their daily 
banking, take out a loan for a new car, 
or start saving for their children’s fu-
ture. It does not matter if you live in 
Bloomington, Minnesota, or Brooklyn, 
New York, the process is the same. 
Virtually all of these institutions are 
federally insured and, thus, subject to 
at least one primary Federal regulator. 
Yet few of these regulators are actu-
ally required to provide testimony on 
their supervisory responsibilities in 
Congress. 
When the Dodd-Frank Act was passed 
in 2010 in response to the financial cri-
sis, it became a requirement and an ex-
pectation that Congress would hear 
from the leaders of the Federal Reserve 
at regular intervals regarding its ef-
forts, activities, and plans with respect 
to their supervisory conduct. 
Today, there is no such requirement 
for regulators at the FDIC, the Na-
tional Credit Union Administration, or 
the Office of the Comptroller of the 
Currency. These agencies are respon-
sible for monitoring the safety and 
soundness of our financial system as 
well as compliance with Federal bank-
ing laws approved by this body. They 
play a large role in protecting tax-
payers by promoting bank solvency 
and intercepting and preventing bank 
failures. These are the very institu-
tions charged with helping prevent 
market crashes before they begin. 
H.R. 4841 would require senior offi-
cials of the prudential banking regu-
lators to report to and testify before 
the House and Senate on their regu-
latory responsibilities. These reports 
would cover issues like the stability of 
our financial system, anti-money laun-
dering examinations, diversity and in-
clusion programs, cybersecurity, and 
efforts to protect consumer data. 
The reports and testimony required 
by this bill will increase Congress’ 
oversight ability, allowing this institu-
tion to more responsibly exercise our 
legislative powers by knowing with 
clarity how programs are administered 
and whether officials are obeying and 
complying with the law. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentleman has expired. 
Ms. WATERS. Madam Speaker, I 
yield an additional 1 minute to the 
gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. PHIL-
LIPS). 
Mr. PHILLIPS. Congress has an im-
portant role to play in ensuring that 
Americans know their government is 
doing everything it can to protect their 
savings and their retirement, and this 
bill will help us get there. 
I want to thank my colleagues who 
have cosponsored this bill and given 
their support, including my friend from 
Georgia (Mr. LOUDERMILK), who has 
been a great partner in helping this 
legislation get to the floor. 
There is a saying that sunlight is the 
very best disinfectant. Every American 
knows that banking is complicated, 
and no institution is too big for over-
sight. I urge my colleagues to vote for 
H.R. 4841, increase transparency, and 
solidify Congress’ role in achieving fi-
nancial stability throughout the coun-
try. 
Mr. 
HILL 
of 
Arkansas. 
Madam 
Speaker, I yield myself the balance of 
my time. 
I want to urge my colleagues to sup-
port H.R. 4841. It is an excellent piece 
of 
bipartisan 
work 
that 
certainly 
speaks to the heart of Article I power, 
which is oversight over the executive. I 
congratulate Mr. PHILLIPS
and Mr. 
LOUDERMILK for their work. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
Ms. WATERS. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself the balance of the time. 
In closing, it is important that Con-
gress conduct regular oversight of inde-
pendent regulatory agencies like the 
OCC, the FDIC, and NCUA to ensure 
they are fulfilling the mission Congress 
gave them. 
Mr. PHILLIPS’ bipartisan bill, the 
Prudential Regulator Oversight Act, 
will ensure Congress gets periodic up-
dates on a range of issues, including 
prudential regulator efforts to hold 
megabanks accountable and promote 
diversity and inclusion. 
Madam Speaker, I urge Members to 
support H.R. 4841, and I yield back the 
balance of my time. 
Mr. LOUDERMILK. Madam Speaker, I rise 
in support of H.R. 4841, the Prudential Regu-
lator Oversight Act. First, I would like to thank 
Mr. PHILLIPS for his leadership on this bipar-
tisan bill and for being willing to address Re-
publicans’ concerns with some of the lan-
guage that was in the original text. Mr. PHIL-
LIPS has worked diligently to address com-
mittee Republicans’ views before, during, and 
after the markup, and as a result, this is a 
strongly bipartisan bill.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H192 
January 13, 2020 
This bill is about transparency and oversight 
of the federal banking regulators. It would re-
quire the Comptroller of the Currency, Federal 
Deposit Insurance Corporation Chair, and Na-
tional Credit Union Administration Chair to tes-
tify before the House Financial Services Com-
mittee and the Senate Banking Committee an-
nually. The bill would harmonize that require-
ment with the existing requirement for the 
Federal Reserve Vice Chair for Supervision to 
testify twice a year. The bill would also require 
these agencies to submit reports about their 
activities to Congress twice a year. I appre-
ciate that Mr. PHILLIPS agreed to add several 
clarifications in the bill to ensure that confiden-
tial supervisory information is not included in 
these reports. 
Requiring these regulators to testify every 
year will help ensure that Congress is having 
a regular dialogue with these agencies. This 
will foster greater transparency into the agen-
cies’ activities and assist Congress in doing its 
job of conducting robust oversight of federal 
regulators. Some may question why this bill is 
needed, because all of these regulators testi-
fied before the Financial Services Committee 
in May of last year. However, it had been 
three and a half years since anyone from the 
FDIC or NCUA had testified at the committee 
before that hearing. 
As the Ranking Member of the Artificial In-
telligence Task Force, I also appreciate that 
the bill requires the banking regulators to re-
port to Congress about financial institutions’ 
use of fintech, cybersecurity, and BSA/AML 
compliance. These are important issues that 
Congress must continue to monitor. 
Requiring annual testimony is a matter of 
good government and Congress doing its job 
of overseeing the regulatory agencies that it 
has created. 
I ask all of my colleagues to support this bill. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentlewoman from California (Ms. 
WATERS) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 4841, as 
amended. 
The question was taken; and (two- 
thirds being in the affirmative) the 
rules were suspended and the bill, as 
amended, was passed. 
A motion to reconsider was laid on 
the table.

EXPANDING

TIONS ACT 
Ms. WATERS. Madam Speaker, I 
move to suspend the rules and pass the 
bill (H.R. 5315) to amend the Financial 
Institutions Reform, Recovery, and En-
forcement Act of 1989 to establish a Fi-
nancial Agent Mentor-Protege Pro-
gram within the Department of the 
Treasury, and for other purposes, as 
amended. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 5315 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-

California (Ms. WATERS) and the gen-
tleman from Arkansas (Mr. HILL) each 
will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from California. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Ms. WATERS. Madam Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days within 
which to revise and extend their re-
marks on this legislation and to insert 
extraneous material thereon. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from California? 
There was no objection. 
Ms. WATERS. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
I rise in support of H.R. 5315, the Ex-
panding Opportunity for Minority De-
pository Institutions Act, which is 
sponsored by Representative JOYCE 
BEATTY of Ohio, who chairs our Diver-
sity and Inclusion Subcommittee. The 
bill is cosponsored by Representatives 
GREGORY MEEKS, AL GREEN, EMANUEL 
CLEAVER, DAVID
SCOTT, and DENNY 
HECK. 
This bill would codify the Depart-
ment of the Treasury’s Mentor-Protege 
Program, which is designed to encour-
age large banks to partner with small-
er banks and minority depository insti-
tutions in enhancing their capabilities. 
These partnerships can be critical for 
MDIs, in particular, to have access to 
the capital and investments they need 
to better serve their communities. The 
Subcommittee on Consumer Protection 
and Financial Institutions, led by 
Chairman MEEKS, held two hearings on 
the importance of minority depository 
institutions in October and November 
of 2019. 
We learned that MDIs face several 
challenges, including the ability to 
raise capital despite overall strong fi-
nancial performance and challenges ex-
perienced as a result of serving com-
munities that are often the first and 
the hardest hit in economic down cy-
cles. This decline is contributing to 
growing banking deserts in minority 
communities. 
We discussed the decline of MDIs and 
how alarming the numbers are. Since 
the financial crisis, we have seen the 
numbers of MDI banks decline from 215 
to 148; and today, we only have 18 
Black-owned banks in this country. It 
is clear regulators have failed to fulfill 
their statutory obligations to preserve 
and promote MDIs and that Congress 
must act. 
In 
addition 
to 
Representative 
BEATTY’s bill, Representative MEEKS 
has drafted a complementary bill, that 
is, H.R. 5322, the Ensuring Diversity in 
Community Banking Act, that will 
take additional steps to help MDIs. We 
hope this bill will move to the House 
floor very soon. 
We must do what we can to ensure all 
current MDIs and, hopefully, future 
MDIs have access to the investments 
and partnerships they need to thrive 
while serving the communities that 
need them the most. Encouraging more 
partnerships, as H.R. 5315 would pro-
vide for, is one important step we can 
take to ensure MDIs have the support 
and, eventually, the capital they need

to continue their good work of serving 
their communities. 
Madam Speaker, I urge all Members 
to support this legislation, and I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. 
HILL 
of 
Arkansas. 
Madam 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
I rise in support in H.R. 5315, the Ex-
panding Opportunity for Minority De-
pository Institutions Act. 
Madam Speaker, I thank the gentle-
woman from Ohio (Mrs. BEATTY) for of-
fering this bill and for working to keep 
important institutions having access 
to the capital they need to support the 
communities that rely on them. 
H.R. 5315 would codify the U.S. Treas-
ury 
Department’s 
Financial 
Agent 
Mentor-Protege Program into law. 
Minority-owned depository institu-
tions play a vital role in our commu-
nities across America. The significant 
decline in the number of banks and 
credit unions since the financial crisis 
is concerning. 
MDIs have a substantial impact on 
consumers and communities, in par-
ticular, those small businesses and 
families that reside in low- and mod-
erate-income census tracts that depend 
on services, often from MDIs in order 
to prosper. 
MDIs are essential to promoting and 
expanding greater access to financial 
services in low- and moderate-income 
communities. As the number of minor-
ity depository institutions continues 
to decline, Congress should act to pre-
serve these vital institutions. 
In a hearing earlier this year, the Fi-
nancial Services Committee heard di-
rectly from a number of MDIs that 
post-crisis regulations have taken a se-
rious financial toll on their ability to 
compete and provide low-cost services, 
thus, making it harder for them to sur-
vive. 
In this instance, MDIs have that in 
common with many, many community 
bank organizations across the country. 
Compliance costs have risen since the 
crisis; and the smaller the institution, 
the higher the burden of those costs. 
So what better way to try to over-
come that than to try to create a 
mentorship program to provide the tal-
ent and extra resources necessary to 
cope with raising capital, having exper-
tise, developing human resources, and 
developing alternative compliance pro-
cedures that will allow MDIs to thrive? 
The Financial Agent Mentor-Protege 
Program has a proven track record of 
success in doing just this. Codifying 
the Financial Agent Mentor-Protege 
Program into law signals Congress’ in-
tent to promote the program and in-
crease mentor participation, poten-
tially expanding the number of MDIs 
participating in the program. 
Committee Republicans support free- 
market solutions. The Financial Agent 
Mentor-Protege Program can encour-
age 
stronger 
partnerships 
between 
larger institutions and the financial 
sector with their minority depository 
institution 
partners, 
thereby 
bene-
fiting more households and more con-
sumers across our country. 
Madam Speaker, I would once again 
like to thank the gentlewoman from 
Ohio for her work on this bill and urge 
all my colleagues to support H.R. 5315. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Ms. WATERS. Madam Speaker, I 
yield such time as she may consume to 
the gentlewoman from Ohio (Mrs. 
BEATTY), 
the 
chair 
of 
the 
Sub-
committee on Diversity and Inclusion 
and the sponsor of this legislation. 
Mrs. BEATTY. Madam Speaker, first, 
let me start by thanking the chair of 
the Committee on Financial Services, 
Congresswoman MAXINE
WATERS, for 
allowing me to bring this bill before 
the committee and for her support. 
Also, I thank the rest of the members 
on the Financial Services Committee 
for supporting this bill and moving the 
bill out of committee unanimously 
with a vote of 57–0. 
Madam Speaker, I also thank my col-
league, Congressman HILL, for his 
words and his support on this very im-
portant piece of legislation. 
b 1730 
My bill, the Expanding Opportunity 
for Minority Depository Institutions 
Act, H.R. 5315, would formally estab-
lish and codify the United States De-
partment 
of 
Treasury’s 
Financial 
Agent Mentor-Protege program into 
law. This mentorship program was es-
tablished by the Treasury Department 
under the Office of Minority and 
Women Inclusion, otherwise known as 
OMWI, to facilitate the program. 
The relationship between minority- 
owned banking institutions and larger 
banks—which is very important and 
key to this piece of legislation—helps 
minority-owned banks improve their 
capacity to better serve their commu-
nities and their customers. At the 
same time it allows larger banks the 
opportunity to expand their network 
and facilitate potential subcontracting 
relationships with their proteges as 
well as receive credit under the Com-
munity Reinvestment Act. 
I am talking about a win-win, Madam 
Speaker, for everyone, especially the 
communities served by these minority- 
owned banks who have been hurt the 
most since the dramatic decline in the 
number of these institutions during the 
financial crisis of 2008, which has left 
many communities of color unbanked 
and underbanked. 
While there are no minority-owned 
banks in the State of Ohio where my 
district is, this bill could help change 
that calculus. I know because I remem-
ber when we had a minority-owned 
bank not far from my district in Day-
ton, Ohio. 
Madam Speaker, focusing on this im-
portant issue will allow Congress to 
stand up and get something done, espe-
cially for African Americans and other 
minorities 
who 
find 
themselves 
unbanked or underbanked. Congress 
needs to incentivize and formally es-
tablish programs such as this to turn 
around this downward trend because 
minority-owned banks have a history 
of making a difference in the commu-
nities. 
Let me just give you an example, 
Madam Speaker. Just a few years ago 
the FDIC surveyed my district, Colum-
bus, Ohio, and reported that 25.2 per-
cent of those in that district were ei-
ther unbanked or underbanked. 
Also, I wanted to be able to say that 
the Main Street financial institutions 
that provide mortgage and small busi-
ness loans to communities are often 
unbanked and underbanked. Just ask 
African Americans right here in Wash-
ington, D.C., what it means to them. 
Finally, let me say, in fact, minority- 
owned banks originate a greater share 
of mortgages and Small Business Ad-
ministration 7(a) loans to borrowers in 
low- and moderate-income areas than 
nonminority-owned banks. They also 
originate a greater share of loans to 
minorities 
in 
general 
than 
non-
minority-owned banks. 
That is why, Madam Speaker, it is so 
important for Congress to pass this bill 
to formally establish the Treasury De-
partment’s mentor-protege program so 
that minority-owned financial institu-
tions can receive resources, as you 
have heard Congressman HILL say, and 
training and technical assistance, as 
Congresswoman MAXINE
WATERS
has 
mentioned, from larger financial insti-
tutions to better serve their commu-
nity and their customers. 
Madam Speaker, I am asking my col-
leagues to support this opportunity for 
this program and for H.R. 5315 to be-
come law. 
Mr. 
HILL 
of 
Arkansas. 
Madam 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume to close. 
Madam Speaker, again, I want to 
thank my friend from Ohio for her 
work on this bill, for calling attention 
to it and for suggesting that it is a 
great sense of partnership to have tech-
nical compliance and technical assist-
ance that is available in so many of our 
larger institutions, those certainly $50 
billion and up, and how they can help 
mentor a minority depository institu-
tion and try to create a better working 
environment for them to serve their 
communities and serve their house-
holds that are important in each of 
their towns and communities across 
this country. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to support H.R. 5315, and I yield 
back the balance of my time. 
Ms. WATERS. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself the balance of my time to 
close. 
Madam Speaker, we have a crisis 
with MDIs, and Congress must take ac-
tion. H.R. 5315 codifies the Department 
of the Treasury’s mentor-protege pro-
gram which is designed to encourage 
large firms to assist these small finan-
cial institutions, including MDIs, in 
enhancing their capability. The pro-
gram has fostered the establishment of 
long-term business relationships be-
tween large banks and MDIs that can

be critical for MDIs to have access to 
the kind of capital they need to better 
serve their communities. 
Madam Speaker, the Financial Serv-
ices Committee approved the bill by a 
vote of 57–0, and the full House should 
also unanimously support this impor-
tant legislation. 
I urge Members to support H.R. 5315, 
I urge my colleagues to join me in sup-
porting this important piece of legisla-
tion, and I yield back the balance of

The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentlewoman from California (Ms. 
WATERS) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 5315, as 
amended. 
The question was taken; and (two- 
thirds being in the affirmative) the 
rules were suspended and the bill, as 
amended, was passed. 
A motion to reconsider was laid on 
the table.

HOUSING 
OPPORTUNI-

PORT EXTENSION ACT OF 2020 
Ms. WATERS. Madam Speaker, I 
move to suspend the rules and pass the 
bill (H.R. 2398) to amend the United 
States Housing Act of 1937 and title 38, 
United States Code, to expand eligi-
bility for the HUD-VASH program, to 
direct the Secretary of Veterans Af-
fairs to submit annual reports to the 
Committees on Veterans’ Affairs of the 
Senate and House of Representatives 
regarding homeless veterans, and for 
other purposes, as amended. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 2398

resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled,

ant to the rule, the gentlewoman from 
California (Ms. WATERS) and the gen-
tleman from Arkansas (Mr. HILL) each 
will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from California. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Ms. WATERS. Madam Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days within 
which to revise and extend their re-
marks on this legislation and to insert 
extraneous material thereon. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from California? 
There was no objection. 
Ms. WATERS. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in strong sup-
port of H.R. 2398, the Veteran Housing 
Opportunities and Unemployment Sup-
port Extension Act. Put simply, this 
bill will help more veterans get out of 
homelessness without increasing cur-
rent funding levels. 
It is a national embarrassment that 
we still have an estimated 37,000 vet-
erans who experienced homelessness on 
any given night in 2019. To our credit 
we have a very successful program that 
is focused on ending homelessness 
among veterans. It is called the HUD- 
VASH program. 
The HUD-VASH program is largely 
credited for the nearly 50 percent de-
crease in the homeless veteran popu-
lation over the past decade. Unfortu-
nately, many of these vouchers go un-
utilized year after year due in part to 
the fact that veterans are not eligible 
for the HUD-VASH program if they re-
ceived an other than honorable dis-
charge from the military. 
Let’s be clear, an other than honor-
able discharge should not be confused 
with a dishonorable discharge. A serv-
icemember can receive an other than 
honorable discharge for fairly minor 
infractions such as lapses in military 
good order and discipline. 
Moreover, veterans who are repeat-
edly deployed tend to suffer more fre-
quently from serious mental health 
issues. We know that mental health 
issues are correlated with higher rates 
of other than honorable discharges as 
well as an increased likelihood of expe-
riencing homelessness upon leaving the 
military. H.R. 2398 would correct this 
injustice by ensuring that veterans 
who received an other than honorable 
discharge are not excluded from the 
HUD-VASH program. 
Madam Speaker, I would like to 
thank my colleagues, Mr. HECK and Mr. 
PETERS, for introducing this critical 
legislation. 
I strongly support this legislation, I 
urge my colleagues to do the same, and 
I reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. 
HILL 
of 
Arkansas. 
Madam 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in support of 
H.R. 2398. I want to thank my friend, 
Mr. PETERS from California, for his 
work on this legislation and my col-
league on the House Financial Services 
Committee, Mr. STIVERS of Ohio. We 
love working together to benefit our 
veterans in the Veterans’ Affairs Com-
mittee and the House Financial Serv-
ices Committee. 
As our chairwoman simply said, Con-
gress should not rest until every home-
less veteran has a roof over his or her 
head. Despite all of our efforts and all 
the leadership we have contributed for 
3 decades, it is still shocking to hear 
Ms. WATERS say that 37,000 veterans 
are reported homeless on any given 
night in our country. 
The idea of partnership between the 
Department of Housing and Urban De-
velopment and the Department of Vet-
erans Affairs dates back to the 1990s. It 
was a pleasure to serve then for Presi-
dent George H. W. Bush and to work 
with Secretary Jack Kemp at HUD 
when the partnership was envisioned. 
Jack Kemp of New York and of Vice 
Presidential candidate fame was a 
strong Member of this House and some-
one who worked hard for communities 
all over this country, particularly for 
communities that are struggling to 
make sure they have access to a better 
future. Jack Kemp demonstrated a lot 
of leadership in outlining this partner-
ship between the VA and HUD for hous-
ing vouchers dedicated to homeless 
veterans. 
We combined that with the VA case 
management 
services 
to 
provide 
healthcare, mental health treatment, 
substance abuse counseling, job place-
ment, and more. We know this works. 
This is why so many of us speak out so 
passionately about shared services and 
comprehensive case management for 
our homeless. We know that all of that 
is important for them to have a better 
future. 
I work with the Veterans’ Affairs 
homeless coordinator in Little Rock, 
Arkansas, on a regular basis, Estella 
Morris, and I have seen her work so 
successfully within this program to 
benefit constituents in my hometown 
of Little Rock. 
This partnership on a national basis 
has proven to be very successful in all 
the States of our land, awarding al-
most 100,000 vouchers over the past 10 
years to those who have honorably 
served their country. H.R. 2398 would 
build on that success by requiring an-
nual reporting from the VA to disclose 
demographic 
information 
and 
how

these vouchers are distributed. With 
several communities around the coun-
try having made great strides to effec-
tively end veteran homelessness, it is 
crucial that we use this information to 
better target the HUD-VASH voucher 
program in those communities that 
need them the most. 
The bill would also expand the eligi-
bility for the program, as Chairwoman 
WATERS
described, to veterans who 
were discharged other than honorably, 
helping 
that 
vulnerable 
population 
have access to this crucial resource. 
Since 2010, the number of homeless 
veterans has been cut in half. This Con-
gress has made it a priority and the 
Obama administration and the Trump 
administration have made this a pri-
ority. These are positive signs, but 
there is more to do and this bill will 
help achieve the goal of ending vet-
erans’ homelessness. 
I, again, would like to thank Mr. 
STIVERS, the ranking member of the 
Housing, Community Development and 
Insurance Subcommittee in the House 
and a cosponsor of the bill for his lead-
ership on the issue and in working with 
Mr. PETERS. 
Madam Speaker, I urge all my col-
leagues to support this bill, and I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Ms. WATERS. Madam Speaker, I 
yield such time as he may consume to 
the gentleman from California (Mr. 
PETERS), who is the sponsor of this leg-
islation. 
Mr. PETERS. Madam Speaker, San 
Diego County is home to over 230,000 
veterans. 
Each 
year 
thousands 
of 
servicemembers exit the military and 
choose to stay in San Diego. It has 
been one of my greatest priorities in 
Congress to support those in the Armed 
Forces transitioning back into civilian 
life. The transition can be tougher for 
some people than for others. Many vet-
erans struggle with mental health con-
ditions like post-traumatic stress or 
traumatic brain injury, and they may 
turn to alcohol or drugs to deal with 
these mental health issues. 
Studies have shown that the top two 
risk factors to becoming homeless are 
mental health issues and substance use 
disorders. The next biggest risk factor 
is economic insecurity. In expensive re-
gions like ours, rising housing costs 
can exacerbate these risks and drive up 
the rate of homelessness. In our county 
we have over 1,000 veterans experi-
encing homelessness. We have made se-
rious progress, as my colleague, Mr. 
HILL, said, here in Congress in reducing 
the number of veterans experiencing 
homelessness primarily due to the 
HUD-VA Supportive Housing, or HUD- 
VASH, voucher program, which aims to 
serve chronically homeless veterans. 
HUD-VASH recognizes housing first as 
the best way to end homelessness and 
couples rental assistance with case 
management services from the VA. 
Since this partnership was forged be-
tween HUD and VA in 2019, the rate of 
veteran homelessness has been cut in 
half. HUD-VASH works, and I have 
spent the past several years supporting 
the program and looking for ways to 
improve it. 
b 1745 
One of those ways to improve this 
program is to expand eligibility for 
those who don’t have access to the pro-
gram. 
Currently, veterans with other than 
honorable discharges are not eligible 
for 
HUD-VASH 
because, 
generally, 
they 
don’t 
have 
access 
to 
VA 
healthcare. A veteran could receive, I 
think as Chairwoman WATERS
men-
tioned, an other than honorable dis-
charge for administrative or relatively 
minor reasons. 
This eligibility gap prevents thou-
sands of homeless veterans from being 
housed while receiving critical sup-
portive services. Now, Congress has 
recognized the value of extending ac-
cess to veterans for other VA homeless-
ness service programs. Two years ago, 
we allowed other than honorable vet-
erans to access the grant and per diem 
program for transitional housing and 
supportive services for veteran families 
for rapid rehousing. 
This bill, my bill, the bipartisan Vet-
eran HOUSE Act, closes this gap. The 
legislation expands eligibility for the 
HUD-VASH program to include vet-
erans with other than honorable, but 
not dishonorable, discharges. 
We know how to end veteran home-
lessness. Several cities across the coun-
try have already achieved functional 
zero. HUD-VASH is one of the most 
vital tools we have to accomplish this 
goal, and we must make sure more 
homeless veterans have access to this 
resource. 
This bill will see that at least 1,300 
additional 
veterans 
are 
eventually 
served by HUD-VASH and will stop 
more homeless veterans from falling 
through the cracks. 
Madam Speaker, I thank the Finan-
cial Services Committee, particularly 
Chairwoman WATERS, Mr. HECK, and 
Mr. STIVERS, for moving this bill 
through their subcommittee. I also 
thank my colleagues on the House 
Committee on Veterans’ Affairs, Chair-
man TAKANO and Chairman LEVIN, for 
taking swift action on this bill last 
year. Both committees passed this bill 
with unanimous support. 
Finally, I thank all the local organi-
zations in San Diego for supporting 
this bill, as well as the National Alli-
ance to End Homelessness and many 
national veterans service organiza-
tions, including The American Legion, 
the VFW, Disabled American Veterans, 
and Paralyzed Veterans of America. 
Madam Speaker, I urge all of my col-
leagues 
to 
support 
the 
Veterans 
HOUSE Act, and I call on the Senate to 
act on this bill to help more homeless 
veterans. 
Mr. 
HILL 
of 
Arkansas. 
Madam 
Speaker, this is a good bill. This is a 
bill that will help move more people to 
shelter, particularly our veterans, who 
are so in need. 
When I think about Jack Kemp and 
his inspiration for this so many years 
ago, he frequently quoted Theodore 
Roosevelt’s great quote, which was: 
‘‘Nobody cares how much you know, 
until they know how much you care.’’ 
Certainly, that is apropos here be-
cause Mr. PETERS and the Committee 
on Veterans’ Affairs and the members, 
both Republicans and Democrats, on 
the House Financial Services Com-
mittee care about solving this crisis. 
We care about working with our local 
partners to make our communities a 
better place. 
Madam Speaker, I thank Mr. STIVERS 
for his work and my friend Mr. PETERS. 
I urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote on this bill, and I 
yield back the balance of my time. 
Ms. WATERS. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself the balance of my time. 
Madam Speaker, I again thank Rep-
resentatives Peters and Heck for bring-
ing forth this important legislation. 
We were reminded only last week of 
the commitment of those who served in 
the United States armed services. We 
must continue to do all we can to en-
sure that those who have served re-
ceive the support they need. The re-
forms in H.R. 2398 will do exactly that. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to join me in supporting this 
important piece of legislation, and I 
yield back the balance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentlewoman from California (Ms. 
WATERS) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 2398, as 
amended. 
The question was taken. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the 
opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being 
in the affirmative, the ayes have it. 
Ms. WATERS. Madam Speaker, on 
that I demand the yeas and nays. 
The yeas and nays were ordered. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to clause 8 of rule XX, further pro-
ceedings on this motion will be post-
poned.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentlewoman from 
California (Ms. WATERS) and the gen-
tleman 
from 
North 
Carolina 
(Mr. 
MCHENRY) each will control 20 min-

The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from California. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Ms. WATERS. Madam Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days within 
which to revise and extend their re-
marks on this legislation and to insert 
extraneous material thereon. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from California? 
There was no objection. 
Ms. WATERS. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in support of 
H.R. 4458, the Cybersecurity and Finan-
cial System Resilience Act, which is 
sponsored by the ranking member of 
the Financial Services Committee, Mr. 
MCHENRY. 
H.R. 4458 would require the pruden-
tial regulators, specifically the Federal 
Reserve, FDIC, OCC, NCUA, to each 
issue an annual report to Congress de-
scribing measures the respective agen-
cy has taken to strengthen cybersecu-
rity. The report must include steps 
each agency is taking to address any 
cybersecurity concerns identified by 
the annual independent evaluations 
conducted under the Federal Informa-
tion Security Modernization Act of 
2014. The bill sunsets after 7 years. 
A wide range of regulators, including 
the 
Financial 
Stability 
Oversight 
Council, as well as experts and indus-
trial stakeholders, have recognized cy-
bersecurity is a key risk to our finan-
cial system and broader economy. 
As technology continues to rapidly 
change how financial products and 
services are delivered, it is important 
that regulators are ensuring financial 
institutions, 
including 
their 
third- 
party service providers, such as cloud 
service providers, have in place robust 
cyber policies and practices to help 
protect against cybersecurity incidents 
that could compromise sensitive con-
sumer data. 
In addition, it is equally important 
that regulators themselves have their 
houses in order and that they are pro-
tecting their own information systems 
from cyberattacks. Indeed, many of our 
regulatory agencies already conduct 
ongoing cyber exercises to assess their 
cybersecurity systems. But as the 
threat of cyberattacks increase, there 
is an opportunity for Congress, as well 
as the public, to better understand how 
their personal data is being protected. 
Furthermore, 
these 
agencies 
also 
must have well-qualified cybersecurity 
experts on the job to help thwart po-
tential cyberattacks that may be di-
rected at these Federal agencies or the 
institutions they oversee. 
I appreciate that the ranking mem-
ber worked with our side of the aisle to 
make important improvements to the 
bill before the committee marked it 
up. These changes include expanding 
the bill from the Federal Reserve to 
apply it to all Federal depository insti-
tution regulators, including the FDIC, 
OCC, and NCUA. 
The bill was also clarified so that the 
annual reporting includes how regu-
lators 
supervise 
banks 
and 
credit 
unions, as well as their third-party 
service providers, to mitigate cyberse-
curity risks. 
Madam Speaker, I urge Members to 
support this important legislation, and 
I reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. MCHENRY. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, today, I begin by 
thanking Chairwoman WATERS and her 
staff for working with my staff and me 
to bring this bill to the floor today 
and, indeed, making it a bipartisan 
outcome. 
It is a nice way to start a year. We 
started last year on the floor passing 
bipartisan bills, and from time to time, 
we have been able to do that over the 
last year. So I thank Chairwoman 
WATERS for working with me where we 
can, but when we disagree in our com-
mittee, we are able to disagree and still 
have the capacity to talk to one an-
other. I think that is a very special 
thing. Now, the rest of our politics, 
they are what they are, but it is good 
to celebrate when we have our bipar-
tisan victories. 
Madam Speaker, the bill we have be-
fore us will ensure the government reg-
ulators are taking seriously the sys-
temic risk that cybersecurity attacks 
pose to the global economy. 
For the first time, this legislation 
will require U.S. bank regulators—the 
Federal Reserve, the Office of the 
Comptroller of the Currency, the Fed-
eral Deposit Insurance Corporation,

and the National Credit Union Admin-
istration—to provide Congress with a 
detailed analysis of what they are 
doing to protect against cyberattacks, 
both internally and in the entities they 
oversee. 
This includes the regulators’ tech-
nical 
procedures, 
their 
operational 
policies to ensure accountability for 
cybersecurity at the highest manage-
ment levels, their cooperation with do-
mestic and foreign financial institu-
tions, as well as their forecasts on 
emerging threats to the resilience of 
the financial system—important stuff. 
The need for this bill is clear. We 
have witnessed nearly half a billion 
data records exposed as a result of 
breaches in the private sector. 
We know that the world is digitizing. 
Our government is trying to keep pace, 
but the private sector is moving very 
quickly as we, as consumers, drive this 
move to greater digitization. 
Not surprisingly, one recent survey 
found that no less than two-thirds of 
our large financial institutions had ex-
perienced an increase in cyberattacks 
over the previous year, with 79 percent 
of them concluding that hackers were 
becoming 
more 
sophisticated. 
Cer-
tainly, they are. 
At an April 2019 hearing of the Finan-
cial Services Committee, CEOs from 
five of America’s seven largest banks 
cited cyberattacks as the foremost risk 
they face. Now, that is not produc-
tivity growth. It is not political up-
heaval overseas. It is not an economic 
slowdown in China or Europe. They 
ranked their highest concern as cyber-
security threats. 
In the private sector, they are not 
alone in this exposure. Last year, we 
saw ransomware attacks against Balti-
more and three towns in Florida that 
forced local government operations to 
be suspended, in some cases jeopard-
izing basic public services. 
What would happen if hackers had 
that same success in a large attack 
that has systemic implications? Here is 
just one example. 
The Federal Reserve settles $35 bil-
lion in global payments in just the first 
hour of operations each business day. A 
cyberattack on the Fed that could be 
just partially successful would have 
and 
could 
have 
disastrous 
con-
sequences. It is precisely the scale and 
interconnectedness of the financial sec-
tor that makes such scenarios so 
alarming. 
As the 2019 annual report of the Fi-
nancial Stability Oversight Council ex-
plains: ‘‘The increasing reliance of fi-
nancial firms on information tech-
nology increases the risk that a cyber-
security event could have severe nega-
tive consequences for the U.S. econ-
omy, potentially impacting financial 
stability.’’ True. 
The FSOC report goes on to say: 
‘‘The unique and complex threats posed 
by cyber risks require the public and 
private sectors to cooperate to iden-
tify, understand, and protect against 
these risks.’’ 
It is a new threat. It is a complex 
one. While I appreciate our regulators’ 
growing sensitivity to cyber-related 
risks, we can and must do more. 
As the Fed acknowledged in its most 
recent financial stability report, cyber 
resiliency is a potential risk for finan-
cial stability that doesn’t fit neatly 
into existing risk frameworks. 
b 1800 
This bill will help our regulators, in-
cluding the Fed, incorporate cybersecu-
rity into those risk assessments more 
effectively. 
To be clear, Madam Speaker, the an-
swer to cyber threats is not to return 
to some bygone, less technologically 
sophisticated age, something we can’t 
do. On the contrary, ensuring the resil-
iency of the financial system means in-
creasing 
vigilance 
and 
innovation. 
That means we need to have the best 
and brightest protecting our important 
institutions of government and the 
best and brightest protecting our im-
portant institutions in the private sec-
tor. 
It is a lack of technological sophis-
tication in the public and private sec-
tors that will offer an opening to 
attackers if we don’t take this action, 
and that is why Congress needs to hold 
our regulators to the highest standards 
of accountability so that they will re-
main a step ahead of tomorrow’s 
threats. 
Again, I want to thank my Demo-
cratic colleagues for working with us 
on this important measure, and I urge 
all Members to support its passage. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Ms. WATERS. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. MCHENRY. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself the balance of my time. 
I include in the RECORD a letter from 
the Credit Union National Association 
in support of H.R. 4458 and a blog post 
by the International Monetary Fund 
which highlights the global threat of 
cybersecurity attacks and the need for 
better 
preparation 
and 
risk 
assessments. 
CREDIT UNION NATIONAL ASSOCIATION, 
Washington, DC, October 29, 2019. 
Hon. MAXINE WATERS, 
Chairwoman, Committee on Financial Services, 
House of Representatives, Washington, DC. 
Hon. PATRICK MCHENRY, 
Ranking Member, Committee on Financial Serv-
ices, House of Representatives, Washington, 
DC. 
DEAR CHAIRWOMAN WATERS
AND RANKING 
MEMBER MCHENRY: On behalf of America’s 
credit unions, I am writing regarding the 
House Financial Services Committee’s mark-
up of H.R. 4458, ‘‘the Cybersecurity and Fi-
nancial System Resilience Act.’’ The Credit 
Union National Association (CUNA) rep-
resents America’s credit unions and their 115 
million members. 
National Cybersecurity Awareness Month 
is an important reminder to assess cyber 
dangers and consider what can be done to 
help protect Americans and American busi-
nesses from cyber-attacks. For credit unions, 
protecting American’s financial and other 
personal information no matter what busi-
ness or entity possess or handle it is of the 
utmost importance. Theft and misuse of 
members’ information from other businesses 
and entities cost credit unions and by exten-
sion their member-owners significant money 
while lining the pockets of criminals and 
criminal nation states who use the money to 
hurt the Unites States. 
CUNA supports H.R. 4458, the ‘‘Cybersecu-
rity and Financial System Resilience Act.’’ 
America’s credit unions support efforts to 
ensure that the entire financial services sec-
tor has proper cyber safeguards in place and 
this effort should extend to the sectors’ regu-
lators. H.R. 4458 would require the sectors’ 
regulators to each issue an annual report to 
Congress describing measures the respective 
agency has taken to strengthen cybersecu-
rity with respect to its functions as a regu-
lator, including the supervision and regula-
tion of financial institutions and, where ap-
plicable, third-party service providers. 
The Federal Information Security Mod-
ernization Act (FISMA) requires the sectors’ 
regulators to develop, document, and imple-
ment an agency-wide program to provide in-
formation security for the information and 
information systems that support the oper-
ations and assets of the agency, including 
those provided or managed by another agen-
cy. It appears that H.R. 4458 would enhance 
FISMA 
through 
reporting 
requirements 
while also requiring the regulators to ensure 
robust oversight of their regulated entities, 
which is already a primary duty of the regu-
lators. 
The regulators should be given wide lati-
tude to decide the information reported pub-
licly on the status of their regulated enti-
ties. Any information that details cyber 
vulnerabilities 
at 
financial 
institutions 
should not be reported publicly as it could 
harm the sector as bad actors could use re-
ports as a roadmap for future attacks. Fur-
thermore, the regulators should coordinate 
publicly reporting their regulated financial 
institutions for the same reason. 
Lastly, we commend the National Credit 
Union 
Administration 
(NCUA) Chairman 
Rodney Hood for recently appointing a cy-
bersecurity advisor. We believe this is a crit-
ical step to ensure the agency stays focused 
on important cyber issues. We appreciate 
that NCUA has taken proactive efforts to 
work to secure the cyber security framework 
for credit unions and their members. 
On behalf of America’s credit unions and 
their 115 million members, thank you for the 
opportunity to share our views. We look for-
ward to continuing to work with the Com-
mittee on safeguarding the financial services 
sector against cyber-attacks. 
Sincerely, 
JIM NUSSLE, 
President & CEO.

CYBERSECURITY THREATS CALL FOR A 
GLOBAL RESPONSE 
(By David Lipton) 
Last March, Operation Taiex led to the ar-
rest of the gang leader behind the Carbanak 
and Cobalt malware attacks on over 100 fi-
nancial institutions worldwide. This law en-
forcement operation included the Spanish 
national police, Europol, FBI, the Romanian, 
Moldovan, Belarusian, and Taiwanese au-
thorities, as well as private cybersecurity 
companies. Investigators found out that 
hackers were operating in at least 15 coun-
tries. 
We all know that money moves quickly 
around the world. As Operation Taiex shows, 
cybercrime is doing the same, becoming in-
creasingly able to collaborate rapidly across 
borders. 
To create a cyber-secure world, we must be 
as fast and globally integrated as the crimi-
nals. Facing a global threat with local re-
sources will not be enough. Countries need to

January 13, 2020 
do more internally and internationally to co-
ordinate their efforts. 
HOW TO BEST WORK TOGETHER 
To begin, the private sector offers many 
good examples of cooperation. The industry 
deserves credit for taking the lead in many 
areas—developing technical and risk man-
agement standards, convening information- 
sharing forums, and spending considerable 
resources. International bodies, including 
the Group of 7 Cyber Experts group and the 
Basel Committee, are creating awareness 
and identifying sound practices for financial 
sector supervisors. This is important work. 
But there is more to be done, especially if 
we take a global perspective. There are four 
areas where the international community 
can come together and boost the work being 
done at the national level: 
First, we need to develop a greater under-
standing of the risks: the source and nature 
of threats and how they might impact finan-
cial stability. We need more data on threats 
and on the impact of successful attacks to 
better understand the risks. 
Second, we need to improve collaboration 
on threat intelligence, incident reporting 
and best practices in resilience and response. 
Information sharing between the private and 
public sector needs to be improved—for ex-
ample, by reducing barriers to banks report-
ing issues to financial supervisors and law 
enforcement. 
Different public agencies within a country 
need to communicate seamlessly. And most 
challenging, information sharing between 
countries must improve. 
Third, and related, regulatory approaches 
need to achieve greater consistency. Today, 
countries have different standards, regula-
tions, and terminology. Reducing this incon-
sistency will facilitate more communication. 
Finally, knowing that attacks will come, 
countries need to be ready for them. Crisis 
preparation and response protocols should be 
developed at both the national and cross-bor-
der level, so as to be able to respond and re-
cover operations as soon as possible. Crisis 
exercises have become crucial in building re-
silience and the ability to respond, by reveal-
ing gaps and weaknesses in processes and de-
cision making. 
CONNECTING THE GLOBAL DOTS 
Because a cyberattack can come from any-
where in the world, or many places at once, 
crisis response protocols must be articulated 
within regions and globally. 
That means the relevant authorities need 
to know ‘‘whom to call’’ during a crisis, in 
nearby and, ideally, also in faraway coun-
tries. For small or developing countries, this 
is a challenge that needs international at-
tention. Many rely on financial services or 
correspondent lines provided by global banks 
for financial connection. Developing cross- 
border response protocols will help countries 
understand their respective roles in a crisis 
and ensure a coordinated response in the 
event of a crisis. 
The Group of 7 countries has made an ex-
cellent start at building collaboration on cy-
bersecurity, but this effort needs to be 
broadened to each and every country. 
Here the IMF can play an important role. 
With a much broader representation than 
most of the standard-setting institutions, 
the IMF has the ability to raise the concerns 
of emerging-market and developing coun-
tries to a global level. Because any place is 
a good place to start an attack, it is in the 
ultimate interest of advanced economies to 
work with other countries to share informa-
tion, coordinate actions, and build capacity. 
At the IMF, we work with countries that 
need to build this capacity, developing the 
skills and expertise needed to recognize and 
effectively counter cybersecurity threats. 
Our international partners are doing the 
same, and we work regularly with an array 
of stakeholders in the public and private sec-
tor. 
Successful cyberattacks have the potential 
to hamper financial development by creating 
distrust, especially if personal and financial 
data are compromised. 
If we want to reap the benefits of new tech-
nologies that can develop markets and ex-
pand financial inclusion, we have to preserve 
trust, and ensure the security of information 
and communications technologies. With cy-
bersecurity, there is always more to be done 
simply because the pace of change is breath-
takingly fast. 
Mr. MCHENRY. Madam Speaker, I 
urge adoption of this measure, and I 
yield back the balance of my time. 
Ms. WATERS. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself the balance of my time. 
In closing, cybersecurity is a major 
issue facing all aspects of our economy, 
including the financial sector. It is an 
important issue for both private com-
panies and government agencies. 
H.R. 4458 will enhance congressional 
oversight of our banking regulators to 
ensure 
that 
they 
are 
maintaining 
strong cyber defenses of their own sys-
tems, as well as the banks and credit 
unions they regulate. I urge Members 
to support this important legislation. 
I thank the ranking member for his 
leadership and for the way that he 
reached across the aisle in working 
with us. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentlewoman from California (Ms. 
WATERS) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 4458, as 
amended. 
The question was taken; and (two- 
thirds being in the affirmative) the 
rules were suspended and the bill, as 
amended, was passed. 
A motion to reconsider was laid on 
the table.

The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The text of the bill is as follows: 
S. 457 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘President 
George H.W. Bush and First Spouse Barbara 
Bush Coin Act’’. 
SEC. 2. COINS HONORING PRESIDENT GEORGE

BARA BUSH. 
(a) CIRCULATING $1 COINS HONORING PRESI-
DENT GEORGE H.W. BUSH.—Notwithstanding

Code, in addition to the coins to be issued 
under subsections (r) and (w) of such section

WATSON
COLEMAN). Pursuant to the 
rule, the gentlewoman from California 
(Ms. WATERS) and the gentleman from 
North Carolina (Mr. MCHENRY) each 
will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from California. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Ms. WATERS. Madam Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days within 
which to revise and extend their re-
marks on this legislation and to insert 
extraneous material thereon. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from California? 
There was no objection. 
Ms. WATERS. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in strong sup-
port of S. 457, the President George 
H.W. Bush and First Spouse Barbara 
Bush Coin Act. This bill directs the 
Treasury to issue $1 coins honoring the 
life and legacy of President George 
Herbert Walker Bush as well as a bul-
lion coin commemorating his wife, 
former First Lady Barbara Bush. 
The dollar coin was one of the first 
silver coins minted in the United 
States. Since the first dollar coins were 
struck in 1794, the dollar coin has, on 
occasion, been minted with the images 
of various individuals whose leader-
ship, actions, and deeds have played an 
integral role at key moments in our 
Nation’s history. These include Presi-
dent Dwight D. Eisenhower, suffragist 
Susan B. Anthony, and, most recently, 
Lemhi Shoshone guide and interpreter 
for the Lewis and Clark expedition, 
Sacagawea. 
Beginning in 2007, the Mint sought to 
honor 
our 
Nation’s 
Presidents 
by 
issuing $1 coins, featuring their images 
in the order that they served. The last 
President to be honored under this pro-
gram was President Ronald Reagan in 
2016. 
This bill reauthorizes the Treasury 
to mint a $1 coin in honor of the late

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H199 
January 13, 2020 
President George H.W. Bush and his 
wife, Barbara Bush, under the Presi-
dential $1 Coin Program. 
George Herbert Walker Bush served 
as the 41st President of the United 
States from 1989 to 1993. A career pub-
lic servant, President Bush served our 
country as a U.S. Navy pilot during 
World War II before going on to serve 
in the U.S. House of Representatives, 
as a U.S. Ambassador to the United Na-
tions, as Director of Central Intel-
ligence, and as the 43rd Vice President 
of the United States. As President, 
Bush presided over the collapse of the 
Soviet Union, German reunification, 
and the first Gulf war. 
In his post-Presidency, Bush is re-
membered for using his spotlight to 
support various charities and for work-
ing closely with former Presidents Car-
ter and Clinton to encourage public 
service and encourage aid for victims 
of natural disasters both at home and 
abroad. 
Barbara Pierce Bush also served as 
First Lady from 1989 to 1993. A fierce 
advocate for literacy, Mrs. Bush was 
dedicated to eliminating generational 
cycles of illiteracy through her in-
volvement in the Barbara Bush Foun-
dation for Family Literacy and other 
reading organizations. As First Lady, 
she was known as much for her humor 
and self-deprecating wit as she was for 
being a keen adviser and confidant to 
President George H.W. Bush. 
In addition to their decades-long ca-
reers as public servants, President and 
Mrs. Bush were the patriarch and ma-
triarch of a family of public servants, 
including the 43rd President of the 
United States, George W. Bush, and the 
former Governor of Florida, John Ellis 
Bush. Their dedication to patriotism, 
service, and each other are an inspira-
tion to us all. 
So I thank our Senate colleague Mr. 
CORNYN for introducing this bill, as 
well as Mr. WILLIAMS and all members 
of the Texas delegation, including our 
own Representative SYLVIA GARCIA, a 
valued new member of the Financial 
Services Committee, for their hard 
work on the bill, and I urge Members 
to vote ‘‘yes.’’ 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. MCHENRY. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
‘‘There could be no definition of a 
successful life that does not include 
service to others’’—the words of George 
Herbert Walker Bush. 
‘‘Each day we should do something to 
help others’’—the words of Barbara 
Pierce Bush. 
We know them as the President and 
the First Lady. The people of Houston 
know them and knew them as kind and 
wonderful and thoughtful neighbors. 
That is the reason why so much of 
Houston is named after 41 and his wife, 
Barbara. They are special people, in-
deed. 
In a special time in American his-
tory, they served their country and 
they devoted their life to public serv-
ice: first, here in the House of Rep-
resentatives, where George H.W. Bush 
served for but a short period of time; 
then, at the highest levels of govern-
ment, as Ambassador to the United Na-
tions, as Director of the CIA, and as an 
Ambassador to China. 
Sadly, we lost President George H.W. 
Bush in November of 2018, just a few 
months after his wife, Barbara, passed 
away on April 17, 2018. 
We know of their devotion to the 
American people, and what we have be-
fore us is legislation that authorizes 
the U.S. Mint to make $1 coins hon-
oring the service and extraordinary 
lives of former President and First 
Lady Bush. 
President Bush’s decades of service 
first began in World War II, where he 
made a rare feat of surviving after 
being shot down over the Pacific. So we 
know of his full life of service. We 
know of their family’s full devotion to 
us as the American people, and we 
thank them for their service. 
It is an honor to be on the floor of 
this House of Representatives to speak 
in honor of such an important life and 
work. This is but a small statement of 
our gratitude for what they did for us 
and how they served us. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Ms. WATERS. Madam Speaker, I 
yield such time as she may consume to 
the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. GAR-
CIA), a valued new member of the Fi-
nancial Services Committee. 
Ms. GARCIA of Texas. Madam Speak-
er, I thank the chairwoman for the 
time allotted to me. 
Today, I speak to celebrate the leg-
acies of fellow Houstonians, former 
President 
George 
H.W. 
Bush 
and 
former First Lady Barbara Bush. 
Before and after Mr. Bush’s Presi-
dency, he and Barbara made Houston, 
Texas, their home. They quickly be-
came mainstays in our community, in 
part, because of their support of Hous-
ton sports teams—I know; I sat in the 
big box with them at many Astros 
games—and 
also 
for 
the 
Houston 
Rodeo. They both wore their hats real-
ly well and all things Houston. But 
mostly, it was because of their advo-
cacy for serving the public good in all 
their philanthropic efforts. 
Barbara Bush was an enthusiastic 
champion of improving literacy for 
families and children. The Barbara 
Bush Foundation for Family Literacy, 
for example, donated money to replace 
books and materials destroyed after 
Hurricane Harvey. 
Former President Bush was equally 
committed to public service. His foun-
dation, Points of Light, mobilized vol-
unteers after Hurricane Katrina hit the 
Gulf Coast in 2005; and, as the chair-
woman noted, President Bush, together 
with President Clinton and others, al-
ways together, formed the Presidents 
Club to help after any disaster. He was 
able to reach across the aisle and, 
again, do what he knew to do best, 
which was to serve the public good. 
I am a proud cosponsor of this com-
memorative coin act to honor both of 
them and their charitable work in 
Houston and throughout. I cannot 
think of a better ambassador for Hous-
ton for all these years than the Bushes. 
Many of us went from calling him 
President Bush to just simply George 
and Barbara because they were always 
together. I know every time we went to 
a game of the Astros and that kiss cam 
would go around the field, whenever it 
got there to either George or Barbara, 
George was ready, and the crowd just 
loved it, because the President was al-
ways there, ready to kiss Barbara on 
the spot as long as the kiss cam caught 
them. 
They were truly Houston’s greatest 
ambassadors. They are missed, but 
their legacy lives on. 
I thank the sponsors of this bill, Sen-
ator CORNYN over in the Senate and 
Mr. WILLIAMS here in the House. 
I thank the chairwoman for giving 
me the time to say a few words about 
some people who were really very, 
very, important to Houston. 
Mr. MCHENRY. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from 
the great State of Arkansas (Mr. HILL), 
who is the ranking member of the Na-
tional Security, International Develop-
ment 
and 
Monetary 
Policy 
Sub-
committee of the Financial Services 
Committee. 
Mr. 
HILL 
of 
Arkansas. 
Madam 
Speaker, I thank my friend, the rank-
ing member of the House Financial 
Services Committee, for yielding to 
me. 
I, too, rise and thank JOHN CORNYN, 
the Senator from Texas, and my good 
friend, small business man, auto dealer 
from Dallas, Texas, ROGER WILLIAMS, 
for his leadership on this commemora-
tion. 
What a treat to be here on the House 
floor and honor George and Barbara 
Bush right where he served as a mem-
ber of the House Ways and Means Com-
mittee some 50-plus years ago. 
He loved the House. He loved an Ar-
kansan named John Paul Hammer-
schmidt, a longtime member of the 
House 
Transportation 
Committee. 
They were best friends. They were 
freshmen together. 
He always spoke fondly of this House, 
and it served him well when he was 
Vice President, served him well when 
he was President of the United States. 
My wife, Martha, and I think about 
one thing when we think about George 
and Barbara Bush, whom we had the 
pleasure to know for over 40 years and 
work for for 4 years. 
When you are at school with your 
kids or filling out a form, there is a 
line that says, ‘‘in case of emergency,’’ 
and there is a blank, and you are sup-
posed to put a friend’s name, a neigh-
bor’s name, a colleague’s name. Madam 
Speaker, when we think of George and 
Barbara Bush, we think of that form. 
b 1815 
In case of an emergency, call George 
Bush, call Barbara Bush. Because that

is what they were. They were neigh-
bors. In their soul, as the ranking 
member from North Carolina said, 
service was at the heart, whether it is 
pushing the cart across the Randalls’ 
parking lot in Houston, serving cookies 
sitting on the floor of the vice presi-
dent’s mansion here in Washington, 
D.C., welcoming foreign leaders at the 
diplomatic 
entrance 
of 
the 
White 
House, service was at the heart. Being 
a neighbor was at the heart. That was 
George and Barbara Bush. 
You think about our kids and their 
striving for who to look up to, who to 
have as a hero on the sports field, on 
the hospital board of directors, on the 
city council, in this House, serving the 
people of America. Who do you think 
of? George and Barbara Bush. 
America, buy these $1 coins, hand 
them out to young people and say, if 
you are looking for a hero, you are 
looking for George Bush. Look no fur-
ther than Barbara Bush. What the 
Bushes did pre-Presidency, in the Pres-
idency, in the limelight for this coun-
try was lead and demonstrate service 
from the heart. 
I can tell you a million stories about 
what a decent person George Bush was 
and what a wonderful woman, biting, 
bossy, fabulous mom, grandmother, 
and First Lady Barbara Bush was. 
Don’t ever be caught chewing gum 
around her because you will swallow it. 
She was tough. She set high standards. 
Her children were held to those high 
standards. And she has lifted our whole 
country up to high standards by being 
an outstanding First Lady. 
Tonight on this House floor it is an 
honor to be here and honor the mem-
ory of George and Barbara Bush by 
unanimously in this House supporting 
JOHN
CORNYN
and ROGER
WILLIAMS’ 
good bill to have the United States 
Treasury mint a coin to someone we 
look up to, we remember with rev-
erence, we are grateful for, grateful for 
their service to this country. 
From being fished out of the Pacific 
Ocean onto the fish back all the way to 
the White House, what a story. 
As Chairwoman WATERS said, even 
better was the story after the Presi-
dency. George Bush shaving his head in 
symbolism, support and solidarity with 
the kids at MD Anderson Cancer Cen-
ter in Houston. George Bush wearing 
that goofy smile with his goofy socks 
to bring out heart and reverence for 
the good work of MD Anderson. Bar-
bara Bush, for something that plagues 
every community in this country, 
every age in this country, the lack of 
literacy. How can you be a successful 
American and not be literate? And Bar-
bara Bush from day one said, this is a 
fight I am in. And she fought for lit-
eracy for adults and for kids all over 
this country and had fun doing it. Her 
daughter-in-law, Laura Bush, our First 
Lady also, has carried that mantle for-
ward. 
Thank you, Madam Speaker, for this 
opportunity to be on the floor to pay 
tribute again to Mr. and Mrs. Bush for 
their leadership in this country. I 
thank the Members of this House that 
come together on both sides of the 
aisle and recognize a leader when they 
see one. I appreciate the ranking mem-
ber from North Carolina for the time. I 
am going to vote ‘‘yes.’’ 
Mr. MCHENRY. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from 
Texas (Mr. WILLIAMS), my colleague 
and member of the House Financial 
Services Committee, the lead House 
sponsor of the legislation we are con-
sidering today. 
Mr. WILLIAMS. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman for yielding. I 
rise today in strong support of the 
President George H.W. Bush and First 
Spouse Barbara Bush Coin Act hon-
oring one of the most remarkable cou-
ples in our Nation’s history. 
I am proud to have introduced the 
House companion bill, H.R. 1173, this 
Congress with a bipartisan group of 27 
lawmakers from the Texas delegation. 
President George H.W. Bush and 
First Lady Barbara Bush were exam-
ples of selflessness and sacrifice. And 
like their country they were tough, 
they were strong and they were kind. 
From President Bush’s naval avia-
tion career where he was the youngest 
pilot to receive his wings and was later 
shot down over the Pacific to his small 
business career, to his tenure as a 
Texas Congressman, ambassador to the 
United Nations, ambassador to China, 
director of the Central Intelligence 
Agency and later as vice president, no 
one was more prepared to be President 
than George H.W. Bush. 
During George H.W. Bush’s Presi-
dency, he tore down the Berlin wall, 
and he kept us safe during Desert 
Storm. He brought to the White House 
with him unwavering strength, patriot-
ism, and humility. 
An example of the latter that comes 
to my mind, when shortly before the 
USS George H.W. Bush, or CVN–77 as it 
is called, was completed, several of us 
on the board of directors went to Presi-
dent Bush’s Houston office and let him 
know how the ship was doing and it 
was almost ready. Upon learning of its 
status, he put his head in his hands and 
said, ‘‘This is one of the nicest things 
that has ever happened to me.’’ He was 
the embodiment of a gracious warrior. 
Tonight I wear this tie that is the tie 
of CVN–77 to remind me of that event 
and in his honor. 
He lived life fearlessly. Later in his 
life when President Bush turned 80, he 
celebrated his birthday, dubbed as ‘‘41 
at 80‘‘ by jumping out of an airplane at 
13,000 feet at College Station, and he 
did it twice. They were his fourth and 
fifth jumps, and I was honored to shake 
his hand upon the landing. 
For those who knew the Bushes, their 
love for country was only surpassed by 
their love of each other. George and 
Barbara Bush were married for 73 years 
in one of the greatest love stories of 
our time. From their very first meet-
ing to the decades of life and family 
they shared together, the Bushes per-
sonified devotion and the truest expres-
sion of love. 
President Bush and I were often able 
to share our passion for America’s fa-
vorite pastime while I served as a 
trustee for the Bush School of Govern-
ment and Public Service at Texas 
A&M. Forty-one was a fixture in the 
world of baseball, and he famously 
took credit for the phrase ‘‘you da 
man’’ 
while 
praising 
the 
Houston 
Astros’ Rusty Staub after a game in 
the sixties. It was one of the very few 
things he would ever boast about and 
be braggadocious. He claimed from 
then on that he never received enough 
credit for coining that phrase. 
I also had the great privilege of 
awarding him the National College 
Baseball Hall of Fame induction trophy 
in his Houston office a few years ago 
for his esteemed and great career he 
had playing for Yale at first base and 
playing in the College World Series. 
Today I even wear this ring as a George 
H.W. Bush award recipient from the 
National 
College 
Baseball 
Hall 
of 
Fame. 
President Bush taught my daughters 
how 
to 
play 
basketball 
in 
Kennebunkport 
preparing 
them 
for 
their future junior high and high 
school careers. He most notably taught 
them the ‘‘falling leaf’’ shot. I think 
this is about how it looked, which in 
his mind would make them all-stars if 
mastered, while they wore the tennis 
shoes given to them by Mrs. Bush as 
they practiced. 
First Lady Barbara Bush was a force 
of nature, and she carried the mantle 
of trusted adviser and family matri-
arch with unfailing grace. Barbara dis-
played true dedication to her country 
and her family in every phase of her 
life. 
To this day, one of my most mean-
ingful memories was President Bush 
often saying thank you for being a 
friend to my family and a friend to my 
son. 
Together President Bush and Mrs. 
Bush exemplified what all Americans 
should strive to emulate. They were 
friends of America, and I was honored 
to call them friends of mine. 
I urge my colleagues to support this 
bill honoring the legacy of two of our 
Nation’s most devoted servants. 
In closing, I would just like to say 
this to President Bush, ‘‘Mr. President, 
you da man.’’ In God we trust. 
Mr. MCHENRY. Madam Speaker, may 
I inquire of the Chair the time remain-
ing on our side. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from North Carolina has 71⁄2 
minutes remaining. 
Mr. MCHENRY. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 21⁄2
minutes to the gentleman 
from Texas (Mr. ARRINGTON), a former 
George W. Bush administration ap-
pointee. 
Mr. ARRINGTON. Madam Speaker, I 
thank my colleague from North Caro-
lina for yielding and for the oppor-
tunity to speak about a great Amer-
ican hero and a wonderful family, a 
class act.

January 13, 2020 
I was privileged to serve under the 
great leadership of George W. Bush as 
Governor of the Lone Star State and 
then President of this great country. 
No doubt his parents, their character, 
their patriotism, and love for their fel-
low man did not fall too far from the 
tree, as we say in Texas. 
I rise in support of the President 
George H.W. Bush and First Spouse 
Barbara Bush Coin Act sponsored by 
friend and fellow Texan, Senator JOHN 
CORNYN. 
George Herbert Walker Bush and his 
wife First Lady Barbara Bush were 
exemplars of leadership and service to 
the country and an almost perfect pic-
ture of a devoted and loving marriage. 
If there is a perfect marriage, they cer-
tainly seemed to have it. 
I think, Madam Speaker, it is right 
and good to honor and commemorate 
the most noble and accomplished lead-
ers and public servants, and no doubt, 
at the top of that list is George Herbert 
Walker Bush and his wife Barbara 
Bush, and I am grateful for the oppor-
tunity to honor the legacy of President 
and First Lady Bush by supporting the 
issuance of these coins. 
Mr. MCHENRY. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, in writing about 
George H.W. Bush it was said duty was 
duty. In 1975, there is this move in the 
administration to shuttle off George 
H.W. Bush to a nondescript position. 
The assumption was if George H.W. 
Bush was offered a job in public serv-
ice, he was going to say no because it 
wasn’t the right job for him. Instead, 
President Bush said yes and served our 
Nation as director of the CIA at a mo-
ment in American history where that 
agency had massive need for reform 
and change and also to rebuild its ca-
pacity to protect us as Americans. 
It was written about him, ‘‘Your mes-
sage came as a total and complete 
shock,’’ Bush wrote to his friend, 
Henry Kissinger. ‘‘Henry, you did not 
know my father. The President did,’’ 
meaning President Nixon. ‘‘My dad in-
culcated into his sons a set of values 
that have served me well. In my own 
short public life’’—not realizing that 20 
years hence he would still be in public 
service—‘‘one of these values quite 
simply is that one should serve his 
country and his President.’’ 
That is what George H.W. Bush wrote 
in 1975, his notion of public service. 
Whether you are a Republican or Dem-
ocrat, those words of public service of 
the need for us as individual Americans 
to do our duty when called upon and to 
offer ourselves to serve the public and 
to serve our fellow man is something 
that was commendable in 1975 and is 
absolutely commendable and especially 
commendable this day. 
On the floor this day, on both sides of 
the aisle, we honor an amazing legacy 
of what he became known as, as 41. The 
41st President of the United States and 
his First Lady, not just during his time 
in the White House, but his first lady 
in his life, Barbara Pierce Bush. We 
know of their family legacy and the 
generations they have given this coun-
try in public service, but we also know 
the amazing legacy of that World War 
II generation that he represented and 
the legacy of public service and trying 
to get things done for the American 
people. 
b 1830 
Mr. Speaker, it is an honor to speak 
in favor of this resolution, this bill 
today, and I ask my colleagues to sup-
port this recognition of the lives, the 
dedication, and the selflessness of 41 
and First Lady Bush. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
Ms. WATERS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself the balance of my time. 
This bill honors a couple who devoted 
their lives to public service and were 
known for their deep faith and commit-
ment to decency and civility. 
Mr. Speaker, I am honored to have 
worked in a bipartisan manner on this 
bill, and I urge my colleagues to join 
me in supporting this important piece 
of legislation. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. 
CUELLAR). The question is on the mo-
tion offered by the gentlewoman from 
California (Ms. WATERS) that the House 
suspend the rules and pass the bill, S. 
457. 
The question was taken; and (two- 
thirds being in the affirmative) the 
rules were suspended and the bill was 
passed. 
A motion to reconsider was laid on 
the table.

PERSONAL EXPLANATION 
Mrs. KIRKPATRICK. Mr. Speaker, I was ab-
sent today due to a medical emergency. Had 
I been present, I would have voted ‘‘yea’’ on 
rollcall No. 14, and ‘‘yea’’ on rollcall No. 15. 
f 
PERMISSION FOR MEMBER TO BE 
CONSIDERED AS PRIMARY SPON-
SOR OF H.R. 2569 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous 
consent that I may hereafter be consid-
ered as the primary sponsor of H.R. 
2569, a bill originally introduced by 
Representative Cummings of Maryland, 
for the purpose of adding cosponsors 
and requesting reprintings pursuant to 
clause 7 of rule XII. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from New York? 
There was no objection. 
f 
b 1915 
PRAISING ROBERT COTTINGHAM 
(Mr. PAYNE asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. PAYNE. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor a local gentleman and 
distinguished resident of Orange, New 
Jersey, Mr. Robert Cottingham. His 
life has been one of inspiring public 
service and dedication to his commu-
nity. He is a military veteran who 
served as a combat infantryman during 
the Korean war. 
When he returned, he sought oppor-
tunities to help others. During the 
1970s and 1980s, he mentored new Afri-
can American workers at the Xerox 
Corporation to help them thrive. In his 
community, he sought to help youth 
and others through service organiza-
tions such as Kappa Alpha Psi Frater-
nity and the Montclair YMCA. He even 
dedicated his weekends to service and 
taught Sunday school as a member of 
the Church of the Epiphany and Christ 
Church in Orange. In addition, he was a 
nationally accomplished high hurdle 
runner and high school track star. 
I had the privilege of attending Mr. 
Cottingham’s 90th birthday yesterday 
and I can tell you that he still inspires 
and serves as an example of the best in 
our community. 
f 
RECOGNIZING PETER VAN CISE’S 
APPOINTMENT TO THE U.S. AIR 
FORCE ACADEMY 
(Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania 
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend his remarks.) 
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today to recog-
nize Peter Van Cise of Julian, Pennsyl-
vania. Peter is a senior at the Bald 
Eagle Area High School. When consid-
ering 
his 
post-graduation 
options, 
Peter honorably chose to commit him-
self to serving his country. 
I am proud of Peter and pleased to 
announce that he has accepted a fully 
qualified appointment to the United 
States Air Force Academy in Colorado. 
Peter is the son of Ann Van Cise and 
Dana Van Cise, an Air Force veteran. 
He is the youngest of seven children. 
Peter excelled in the classroom, on the 
soccer field, and in his community as a 
true leader. I know that his hard work 
as a student will serve him well as he 
starts his military career in the Air 
Force Academy. 
Peter has continually demonstrated 
a sincere commitment to service, and I 
wish him all the best in this exciting 
new venture. 
f 
NATIONAL MENTORING MONTH 
(Mr. LANGEVIN asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. LANGEVIN. Madam Speaker, 
every young person needs a mentor, 
someone to provide real-life guidance 
as they navigate the challenging, form-
ative years of youth. Mentoring is 
closely linked with positive behaviors, 
including school attendance, regular 
volunteering, and college enrollment. 
Unfortunately, one in three young peo-
ple in America is growing up without a 
mentor. 
During National Mentoring Month 
this January, I rise to honor the orga-
nizations, mentors, and others who are 
working every day to close this gap— 
organizations like MENTOR Rhode Is-
land and Big Brothers Big Sisters of 
Rhode Island. I am proud to represent 
them as a member of the Congressional 
Youth Mentoring Caucus and to push 
for strong funding for youth mentoring 
each and every year. 
Madam Speaker, our young people 
are our most precious resource, and it 
is our duty to support them and the 
mentors who help them thrive.

REMEMBERING THE LIFE OF MR. 
TOM WRIGHT 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and 
extend his remarks.) 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to remember the 
life of Mr. Tom Wright, who passed 
away on January 3 at the age of 76. 
Mr. Wright dedicated his life to serv-
ing both his country and his local com-
munity. He served for 21 years as a 
commander in the United States Navy, 
including one tour in Vietnam. After 
his retirement, he continued his work 
supporting veterans’ groups in the 
local Savannah area. Mr. Wright also 
dedicated a great deal of his time and 
efforts to the civilian maritime com-
munity in Savannah, including the Sa-
vannah Propeller Club and the Savan-
nah Maritime Association. 
A family man through and through, 
he could often be found watching North 
Carolina Tar Heel basketball with his 
family. 
His presence will be deeply missed 
throughout our area. Mr. Wright’s fam-
ily and friends will be in my thoughts 
and prayers during this most difficult 
time.

RECOGNIZING U.S. FIREFIGHTERS 
HELPING AUSTRALIA 
(Mr. PANETTA asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. PANETTA. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to recognize the 200 fire-
fighters from the United States, in-
cluding California, who packed up and 
deployed out to help our friends from 
Down Under in Australia fight one of 
the biggest fire disasters we have ever 
seen on this Earth. 
A fire that has burned millions of 
acres, destroyed thousands of busi-
nesses, farms, and homes, killed 25 peo-
ple, and incinerated close to 1 billion 
animals. 
For over 15 years the United States 
and Australia have shared firefighters 
to help each other contain their grow-
ing wildfires; but as we are experi-
encing—and, 
yes, 
due 
to 
climate 
change—our fire seasons are getting 
longer and longer, our droughts are 
getting drier and drier, and our fires 
are getting bigger, costlier, and dead-
lier. 
That is why we are so grateful to the 
firefighters, not only for their service 
to our communities but for their will-
ingness to travel and fight fires in

other countries. That appreciation for 
those firefighters will be demonstrated 
in Congress later this week when I in-
troduce a resolution recognizing their 
work, their will, and their courage. 
But let that resolution also be a re-
minder of the work and commitment 
needed by all nations to not just fight 
fires for our safety, but to continue to 
fight climate change for our future.

PRESIDENT TRUMP KEEPS 
PROMISES 
(Mr. WILSON of South Carolina 
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend his remarks.) 
Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. 
Madam Speaker, in the December Jobs 
Report, job numbers remain strong. 
Over 140,000 jobs were added, and wages 
are up. The unemployment rate re-
mains at a 50-year low at 3.5 percent. 
These new, consistent numbers show 
that President Trump is continuing his 
effective record of promises made, 
promises kept. 
The 
December 
Jobs 
report 
also 
showed that the total employment 
level rose to 158.8 million—another 
record high. By creating jobs, lowering 
unemployment, increasing wages, and 
consistently working to promote op-
portunities, 
President 
Trump 
con-
tinues keeping his promises. 
Baseless attacks on the President by 
Democrats and the biased fake news at-
tempted to conceal his successes, but 
make no mistake: President Trump is 
focused to work for American families 
and jobs. 
In conclusion, God bless our troops, 
and we will never forget September the 
11th in the global war on terrorism. 
Best wishes to Coach Dabo Swinney, 
go Clemson Tigers tonight. 
f 
IMPEACHMENT TRIAL 
(Ms. NORTON asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.) 
Ms. NORTON. Madam Speaker, the 
conventional 
wisdom 
that 
Speaker 
PELOSI and the Democrats gained noth-
ing from the delay in sending the Arti-
cles of Impeachment to the Senate is 
contradicted by the results. Some Re-
publican Senators are said to be work-
ing to assure witnesses, as Speaker 
PELOSI demanded. 
There are 53 Republican Senators and 
47 Democrats. Notwithstanding where 
they stand on impeachment itself, it 
would benefit Republican moderates 
and even others to avoid the stigma of 
unprecedented unfairness by at least 
allowing witnesses, which requires only 
a 51 percent majority. Witnesses would 
help mitigate Majority Leader MITCH 
MCCONNELL’s undisguised unfairness in 
working directly with the White House. 
As a result of the Pelosi delay, even 
Senator MCCONNELL now says he will 
follow the Clinton impeachment proc-
ess. Depositions from witnesses were 
ultimately allowed there. 
CELEBRATING NATIONAL 
MENTORING MONTH 
(Ms. FOXX of North Carolina asked 
and was given permission to address 
the House for 1 minute.) 
Ms. FOXX of North Carolina. Madam 
Speaker, since 2002, January has been 
recognized 
as 
National 
Mentoring 
Month. We should all recognize the 
positive impact that mentoring has on 
young people. 
From our servicemembers at Cherry 
Point to the volunteers of the Winston- 
Salem United Way, the coaches of 
LifeConnections in Alexander County 
to the Western Youth Network in 
Boone, North Carolinians remain ac-
tively engaged in mentoring opportuni-
ties across my State. 
According to Mentoring.org, at-risk 
youth who were paired with a mentor 
are 55 percent more likely to enroll in 
college; 78 percent more likely to vol-
unteer regularly in their communities; 
and 130 percent more likely to hold 
leadership positions in their careers. 
Madam Speaker, the numbers speak 
for themselves. Mentoring is a corner-
stone of the growth and development of 
young people across our country. 
f 
GIPSA PROPOSED RULE 
(Ms. KAPTUR asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Ms. KAPTUR. Madam Speaker, today 
the United States Department of Agri-
culture published its long-awaited pro-
posed rule to fix the Packers and 
Stockyards Act to address institu-
tional bias against small livestock and 
poultry farmers. 
For decades I have fought alongside 
our livestock and poultry farmers to 
ensure their hard work is respected and 
standards exacted by their processing 
firms were fair and honest. Unfortu-
nately, small producers have been 
taken advantage of, retaliated against, 
marginalized legally in favor of larger 
meatpackers, swine contractors, and 
poultry companies, and forced to swal-
low opaque contracts just to pay their 
bills. 
The proposed rule falls short to ad-
dress their very serious grievances. 
Once again, this administration is 
happy setting minimal, powder-puff re-
quirements that sidestep hardworking 
families in favor of mega-business inte-
grators. 
Let us continue to work hard to im-
prove the proposed rule to ensure that 
those who feed America get a fair 
shake and are treated right by all of 
America.

GLASSTOWN PRODUCTIONS 
(Mr. VAN DREW asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. VAN DREW. Madam Speaker, 
today I want to acknowledge the Mill-
ville-based 
production 
company, 
Glasstown Productions in south Jersey. 
Glasstown Productions is an exem-
plary company that has excelled in 
telling their clients’ stories through 
film. Their work has been recognized 
by the Dog Film Festival, CinemaFest, 
and the International Christian Film 
and Music Festival. 
Under the leadership of CEO Robert 
Penza and Creative Director Jason 
Penza, Glasstown has brought home 
multiple awards and recognitions to 
the State of New Jersey and, most 
proudly, to south Jersey. 
Last year Glasstown Productions was 
honored with a Gold Telly Award for 
its film, ‘‘Ask Seek Knock: The Story 
of Brianna Wittman.’’ 
Glasstown Productions is just one ex-
ample of the opportunities to build 
something great in south Jersey. The 
coveted Gold Telly Award speaks to 
the quality of work being produced in 
our district, and I commend Glasstown 
Productions for their excellent accom-
plishments. We are truly, sincerely and 
extremely proud of them and what 
they have accomplished.

CELEBRATING VILLAGE 
EXCHANGE CENTER 
(Mr. CROW asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. CROW. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to celebrate the third anniver-
sary of the Village Exchange Center in 
Aurora, Colorado. 
Founded in 2017, the Village Ex-
change Center has become a thriving, 
collaborative nonprofit and a home for 
immigrants, refugees, and community 
members throughout the Aurora-Den-
ver metro area. 
In Aurora, we recognize that our di-
versity is our strength. In our public 
schools alone, over 150 languages are 
spoken by students. This is where VEC 
comes in, helping build bridges be-
tween the multiple cultures, faiths, 
and nationalities that now call Colo-
rado home. 
This year VEC is embarking on an 
ambitious new initiative called Village 
Farms at Stanley, a vertical farm near 
Stanley Marketplace. Village Farm 
will help empower diverse, intergenera-
tional communities through education, 
training, food, and farming. 
On its third anniversary, I wish VEC 
continued success in bringing people 
together in paving the way toward 
health and economic opportunities for 
our diverse communities. Together, we 
can build a vibrant community.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H205 
January 13, 2020 
In a ceremony on Friday, Zena, who 
lives in State College, graduated from 
being an astronaut candidate in NASA 
Astronaut Group 22 and is now a full- 
fledged astronaut. 
Zena’s academic achievements are 
numerous. She is trained as a marine 
biologist, and Zena has focused her re-
search 
on 
microorganisms 
in 
sub-
surface environments. 
It is clear that her success shows 
that she possesses both the work ethic 
and 
intrepid 
spirit 
exemplified 
by 
many across Pennsylvania’s 12th Con-
gressional District. 
As an astronaut, Zena faces an excit-
ing time in the history and future of 
NASA. The Artemis missions aim to 
return humans to the Moon by 2024. 
That also includes putting the first 
woman on the Moon. 
Since the beginning of the space pro-
gram, the work of our Nation’s astro-
nauts in advancing the cause of dis-
covery in space and on Earth shows the 
best of mankind and that our achieve-
ments are limited only by our ambi-
tions. 
Madam Speaker, again, it is my 
honor to recognize the achievements of 
Zena Cardman on becoming an astro-
naut and joining the rich history of 
pride and wonder that comes with that 
distinction.

RECOGNIZING ELIZABETH 
SILBAUGH JOHNIDES 
(Mr. SMUCKER asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. SMUCKER. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to recognize and thank a 
business and community leader from 
the congressional district that I rep-
resent. 
Elizabeth Silbaugh Johnides of Han-
over tirelessly gives back to her com-
munity and is always looking for ways 
to lift up and empower women in busi-
ness. Liz works professionally as a fi-
nancial adviser and continues to work 
with her family business, a fixture of 
southern York County, The Markets at 
Hanover and Shrewsbury. 
Liz has worked to transform The 
Markets at Hanover into a space that 
welcomes events from nonprofits and 
community organizations. She also 
gives of her time, serving on the boards 
of a number of area nonprofit organiza-
tions, including Sweet Charities of 
Hanover, which has raised over $2 mil-
lion to support community organiza-
tions. 
Liz was recently recognized as the re-
cipient of the 2019 Community Leader 
Award by Hanover Area Chamber of 
Commerce for her many years of serv-
ice to the Hanover community. 
Madam Speaker, I thank Liz for her 
tireless efforts to improve the Hanover 
community.

HONORING SHERIFF TOM BOSENKO 
FOR 40 YEARS OF SERVICE 
(Mr. LAMALFA asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. LAMALFA. Madam Speaker, I 
rise tonight to honor a good friend and 
a great leader in Shasta County, Sher-
iff Tom Bosenko, who served 40 years 
with the Shasta County Sheriff’s Of-
fice, 14 years as sheriff. 
He has worked in nearly every divi-
sion of the sheriff’s office, including 
patrol operations, school resource offi-
cer, SWAT, antigang enforcement, and 
the canine unit. Importantly, he was at 
the helm of the sheriff’s office when 
the historic Carr fire hit last year. I 
can’t thank him enough for keeping 
order and calm in directing people in a 
positive fashion during that time. 
Madam Speaker, he is a four-time re-
cipient of the Best in the North State’s 
Best Elected Official award. 
He has worn his badge with honor, 
never backing down from what needs to 
be done and shouldering the burden of 
keeping the community safe. I saw him 
everywhere I went during my time vis-
iting around in the district there. He is 
a community guy. 
Madam Speaker, as a motorcycle 
lover, I think Tom will ride his Harley- 
Davidson right into retirement. He is, 
in retirement, still a fierce defender of 
our Second Amendment rights. 
Madam Speaker, I thank Tom for his 
unwavering service to the community, 
the people of the north State, and his 
example. He will be missed, certainly, 
but I know his successor, Sheriff Eric 
Magrini, will do well under Tom’s tute-
lage. I appreciate him, and may God 
bless him.

RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY LEADER 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. 
The 
majority 
leader 
is 
recognized. 
IRAN 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, it 
has been 10 days since the United 
States removed Iran’s chief terrorist, 
Qasem Soleimani, from the battlefield. 
It has been 5 days since the brutal vio-
lence, recklessness, and failed govern-
ance that defines the Iranian’s regime 
was put on full display with their 
shoot-down of a Ukrainian civilian air-
line and the death of all 167 souls on 
board. 
After a brief stab at a failed coverup, 
the Iranian Government had to come 
clean and explain that its own reck-
lessness had killed more than 80 Ira-
nians, 63 Canadians, and the other vic-
tims. Despite the claims of supposed 
experts on Iran that Iranians would 
rally behind their oppressive regime, 
the truth is quite different. Instead, 
thousands of Iranians have taken to 
the streets to celebrate Soleimani’s 
death, condemn the regime’s domestic 
repression, call for regime change in 
Tehran, and denounce their govern-
ment’s feeble efforts to lay its own vio-
lence at the feet of the United States. 
According to journalists, here is one 
chant that has been ringing out on the 
streets of Iran: ‘‘Soleimani is a mur-
derer, his leader a traitor.’’ Here is an-
other: ‘‘They are lying that our enemy 
is America, our enemy is right here.’’ 
The irony is rich. 
As Iran’s master terrorist, Soleimani 
himself led efforts to brutalize Iranian 
protesters who dared to challenge the 
regime. Just a few months ago, he 
boasted to Iraqi leaders: ‘‘We in Iran 
know how to deal with protests.’’ That 
violent approach is exactly why Iraqis 
and Iranians alike are now celebrating 
his death and denouncing the regime 
he helped lead. I am sure the mullahs 
regret that Soleimani himself is no 
longer around to help intimidate and 
murder their own citizens into silence. 
These protests aren’t limited to Iran 
either. Protestors are back in Iraq as 
well—not 
phony, 
Iran-staged 
dem-
onstrations but real citizen-led pro-
tests across Iraq. Iraqis are demanding 
a government whose top priority is 
Iraqi’s own interests rather than facili-
tating Iranian interference. 
Given the death and terror that Iran 
has wrought in the Middle East for dec-
ades, this kind of reaction shouldn’t be 
a surprise, but strangely—strangely—it 
seems it has surprised many of our fel-
low Americans. 
Here at home, many on the left and 
in the media had rushed to reflexively 
blame President Trump, and not the 
Iranian regime, for the recent violence. 
After only the earliest initial re-
ports, the Speaker of the House rushed

January 13, 2020 
to blame our administration for ‘‘need-
less provocations,’’ she said, and fol-
lowing Iran’s shoot-down of the air-
liner, one prominent House Democrat 
characterized the regime’s violence as 
‘‘collateral damage,’’ resulting from 
America’s actions—exactly how the 
Iranians themselves were trying to 
spin it. 
One Democrat running for President 
tried a similar, embarrassing equivo-
cation. He said the civilians Iran had 
blown up were ‘‘caught in the middle of 
an unnecessary and unwarranted mili-
tary tit-for-tat.’’ 
For several days, you could not open 
a newspaper or turn on the television 
without prominent Democrats and so- 
called foreign policy experts setting 
aside decades of Iranian aggression to 
imply—or 
even 
say 
outright—that 
America, not Iran, was responsible for 
the cycle of violence and that Presi-
dent Donald Trump was the real vil-
lain. 
So we are faced with a remarkable 
spectacle. Even under threat of tear 
gas or even gunfire, the brave people of 
Iran are themselves displaying more 
willingness to criticize their own bru-
tal rulers than we saw in the initial re-
sponses from some Democrats and so- 
called experts right here at home. It is 
a remarkable spectacle but a pretty 
sad one. I hope this can be a lesson to 
anyone who has let their domestic po-
litical grievances pollute their judg-
ment of world affairs. 
It shouldn’t take the brave Iranian 
people themselves to remind American 
leaders that Tehran has long been the 
force for bad in this situation, and the 
United States is a force for good. 
As I have said, the President’s bold 
action has attracted significant criti-
cism for Democrats here in Congress. It 
is the Senate’s prerogative to weigh in 
on foreign policy, and I fully expect we 
will debate a War Powers Resolution 
from some of our colleagues very soon. 
I look forward to discussing the last 
administration’s failed strategy that 
got us here. The Obama administration 
responded to Iran’s violence and ag-
gression with appeasement and re-
trenchment rather than pushback. 
I look forward to discussing the fact 
that senior military commanders did 
not just recommend the President take 
immediate action to disrupt Iranian 
plots against our personnel, they be-
lieved the United States would be ‘‘cul-
pably negligent’’ if it didn’t act to stop 
the plotting. 
I expect that some of the Democrats 
who have rhetorically embraced the in-
telligence community when it suited 
their political interests may now rush 
to criticize the career professionals. I 
look forward to hearing our colleagues 
who want to quibble over the word 
‘‘imminent’’ explain just how close we 
should let the terrorists come to kill-
ing more Americans before we defend 
ourselves—just how close should we let 
terrorists come to killing more Ameri-
cans before we defend ourselves. 
I assure you, if the President had not 
acted to disrupt a deadly attack, I am 
confident these same critics would 
have blasted him for failing—failing— 
to protect American lives. 
Just a few days before the strike, the 
junior Senator from Connecticut was 
blasting—blasting—the administration 
for ‘‘render[ing] America impotent in 
the Middle East.’’ He complained that 
‘‘no one fears us, no one listens to us.’’ 
Naturally, after President Trump did 
take bold action, the same colleague 
has become a fierce critic of President 
Trump 
for 
supposedly 
being 
too 
harsh—too harsh. That is not exactly a 
model of consistency. 
Our Democratic colleagues were very 
happy to give President Obama wide 
latitude to engage in strikes where 
American lives and American interests 
were far less directly at stake than 
with Mr. Soleimani. 
Now the same Democrats who em-
braced the Obama intervention in 
Libya, for example, say it is a bridge 
too far for President Trump to respond 
with limited force to Iranian-directed 
strikes against American interests and 
personnel that have been escalating for 
months. OK in Libya, not OK here—the 
double standards are literally head- 
spinning. 
So I expect the Senate will soon de-
bate Senator KAINE’s War Powers Reso-
lution. For a year now, I have wanted 
the Senate to go on record about our 
military presence and strategy in Syria 
and Iraq. I am glad my Democratic col-
leagues may finally be interested in 
having that discussion rather than 
ducking it. 
I don’t believe the blunt instrument 
of the War Powers Resolution is an ac-
ceptable substitute for the studied 
oversight 
the 
Senate 
can 
exercise 
through 
hearings, 
resolutions, 
and 
more tailored legislation. So I will 
strongly oppose the resolution, and I 
would urge all our colleagues to con-
sider what message the Senate should 
send to Iran and the world at the very 
moment that America’s actions are 
challenging the calculus in Tehran for 
the better. We appear to have restored 
a measure of deterrence in the Middle 
East, so let’s not screw it up. 
IMPEACHMENT 
Mr. President, on Friday Speaker 
PELOSI signaled that she may finally 
wind down her one-woman blockade of 
a fair and timely impeachment trial. It 
has certainly been revealing to see 
House Democrats first claim that im-
peachment was so urgent—so urgent— 
that they could not even wait to fill 
out the factual record and then, subse-
quently, delay it for weeks. I am glad 
the Speaker finally realized she never 
had any leverage in the first place to 
dictate Senate procedure to Senators 
and is giving in to bipartisan pressure 
to move forward. 
In terms of influencing Senate pro-
ceedings, 
this 
strange 
gambit 
has 
achieved absolutely nothing, but it has 
produced one unintended side effect: 
The Speaker’s efforts to precommit the 
Senate to carry on an investigation 
with which her own House lost pa-
tience concedes that the House case is 
rushed, weak, and incomplete. 
Let me say that again. By trying and 
failing to get the Senate to precommit 
to redoing the House’s investigation, 
House Democrats admitted that even 
they did not believe their own case is 
persuasive. 
Think about the message it sends 
when the prosecutors are this des-
perate to get the judge and jury to redo 
their homework for them, and think 
about the separation of powers. The 
House, 
knowingly—knowingly—de-
clined to spend time on legal battles 
and due process that it would have 
needed to pursue the certain avenues. 
Now, after declining to fight their own 
fight, 
they 
want 
the 
Senate 
to 
precommit ourselves to wage these po-
tentially protracted legal battles on 
their behalf. They wanted Senators to 
precommit ourselves to not only judge 
the case that House Democrats are ac-
tually going to send over but, also, to 
reopen the investigatory stage and 
maybe supplement Chairman SCHIFF’s 
slapdash work. In other words, the 
President’s opponents are afraid of 
having the Senate judge the case they 
actually are going to send us. They are 
afraid of having the Senate judge the 
case they themselves voted on. That 
alone speaks volumes. 
A few weeks ago, in real time, many 
Senators and legal experts tried to 
warn House Democrats that they were 
nowhere near a finished product—no-
where near—and that the Articles of 
Impeachment they had drafted were 
more like a censure resolution based on 
partisan anger than an actual impeach-
ment based on careful investigation. 
The House ignored us at the time. 
They rushed ahead to meet a political 
timetable. Now they have spent almost 
a month conceding that their own case 
does not stand on its own and search-
ing for ways to supplement it from the 
outside. This is exactly the kind of 
toxic new precedent that many of us 
warned about back in December—that 
Speaker PELOSI’s House was not send-
ing the Senate a thorough investiga-
tion. They were just tossing up a jump 
ball and hoping that the political winds 
might blow things their way. 
So here we are. The Senate was never 
going 
to 
precommit 
ourselves 
to 
redoing the prosecutors’ homework for 
them, and we were never going to allow 
the Speaker of the House to dictate 
Senate proceedings to Senators. 
House Democrats have already done 
enough damage to the precedent, to na-
tional unity, and to our institutions of 
government. The Senate will not be 
sucked into this precedent-breaking 
path. We will fulfill our constitutional 
duty. We will honor the reason for 
which the Founders created this body: 
to ensure our institutions and our Re-
public can rise above short-term, fac-
tional fever. 
The House has done enough damage. 
The Senate is ready to fulfill our duty. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The clerk will call the roll.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S153 
January 13, 2020 
The legislative clerk proceeded to 
call the roll. 
Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, it has 
now been 26 days since House Demo-
crats voted to impeach the President of 
the United States. This is a predictable 
ending to an increasingly embarrassing 
impeachment 
inquiry. 
Apparently, 
Speaker 
PELOSI, 
Chairman 
SCHIFF, 
Chairman NADLER, and others were in 
such a big hurry to get this done before 
the end of the year, they have obvi-
ously gotten cold feet because they 
have refused to present the Articles of 
Impeachment to the Senate so that we 
can have the trial. 
As the Presiding Officer knows, ordi-
narily, if you are presented with a situ-
ation in which the prosecution refuses 
to proceed to put on the evidence in 
the case, they are dismissed as a rou-
tine matter—dismissal for want of 
prosecution—or if, in fact, they do in-
tend to present the Articles of Im-
peachment, there is a fundamental no-
tion of basic fairness included in the 
guarantee of a speedy trial that is obvi-
ously being neglected, avoided, and 
abused by the Speaker and her leaders 
in the House. 
Our Democratic colleagues in the 
House rushed through their investiga-
tion in only 12 weeks, and it ended up 
passing Articles of Impeachment on a 
partisan basis. After repeatedly saying 
that this is a grave and urgent matter, 
it seems that Speaker PELOSI has expe-
rienced some buyer’s remorse and has 
questioned just how grave and urgent 
it really is. 
Here we are, as I said, 26 days later, 
and she still has not sent the Articles 
of Impeachment to the Senate. As we 
know, even though some have sug-
gested the Senate could somehow pro-
ceed to trial absent the delivery of 
those articles here, we can’t try the 
case until the charges are delivered. 
Finally, last Friday, the Speaker in-
dicated that she will transmit the arti-
cles this week. They will also have to 
name impeachment managers, Rep-
resentatives from the House who will 
come over and actually present the 
charges to the Senate and attempt to 
produce evidence in support of those 
charges. 
It remains to be seen whether the 
Speaker will deliver the articles this 
week. She has been withholding them, 
as I said, for nearly 4 weeks now, 
claiming that it is part of her strategy 
to get leverage over the Senate, a 
strategy that has yielded no positive 
results. 
In fact, what we have seen is, the 
Speaker has zero leverage in the Sen-
ate. She runs the House; there is no 
doubt about that. But the Senate is a 
separate body. We don’t take our in-
structions from the House, just as the 
House does not take their direction 
from the Senate. 
Before the House even voted on the 
articles, Leader MCCONNELL said that 
the Senate should follow the same bi-
partisan framework used to guide the 
Clinton impeachment trial. I say ‘‘bi-
partisan’’ because, at that time, 100 
Senators agreed to this path forward. 
The logic goes this way: If it was 
good enough for President Clinton, 
then it should be good enough for 
President Trump. Suffice it to say, the 
Speaker disagrees. Instead of sending 
the Articles of Impeachment over and 
letting 100 Members of the Senate de-
cide how best to proceed, she chose to 
take matters into her own hands. 
Apparently, ‘‘the sole Power of Im-
peachment,’’ as the Constitution de-
scribes the House’s role, isn’t good 
enough for Speaker PELOSI. She is now 
trying to assume what the Constitu-
tion says is the Senate’s ‘‘sole Power 
to try all Impeachments.’’ 
We shouldn’t be fooled. Despite her 
claims, this is not an effort to create a 
fair process. A fair process would be 
like the Bill Clinton impeachment 
trial, which was agreed to by 100 Sen-
ators on a bipartisan basis. Our Demo-
cratic colleagues in the House threw 
fairness out the window months ago. 
This is Speaker PELOSI singlehandedly 
ignoring the express commands of the 
Constitution for her own perceived po-
litical benefit. 
Republicans aren’t the only ones who 
think the Speaker has gone too far. 
There is bipartisan agreement that 
Speaker PELOSI should send the Arti-
cles of Impeachment over here forth-
with. 
A number of our Senate Democrats 
have expressed their desire to get 
started with the impeachment trial. I 
think the senior Senator from Cali-
fornia—our 
friend 
Mrs. 
FEINSTEIN, 
same State as the Speaker of the 
House—summed it up best when she 
said: 
The longer it goes on, the less urgent it be-
comes. . . . So if it’s serious and urgent, send 
them over. If it isn’t, don’t send it over. 
Irrefutable logic. 
We are hearing from a growing num-
ber of House Democrats who have split 
from Speaker PELOSI and say that it is 
time to send the articles. For example, 
the Chairman of the House Armed 
Services Committee said that ‘‘we con-
trol it in the House, MITCH MCCONNELL 
controls it in the Senate.’’ Senator 
MCCONNELL might disagree with that, 
but that is what the Chairman of the 
Armed Services Committee said. He 
conceded: ‘‘I think it is time to send 
the impeachment to the Senate.’’ 
With Speaker PELOSI facing increas-
ing backlash from Members of her own 
party, 
including 
her 
rank-and-file 
Democrats, you can’t help but wonder 
who is winning this game that she is 
playing. It is clearly a game. It is 
laughable to say that she is doing this 
for the sake of the American people or 
the Constitution. 
A new poll released by The Hill and 
Harris last week showed that 58 per-
cent of voters nationwide think it is 
high time for the House to send the Ar-
ticles of Impeachment to the Senate— 
58 percent. 
This delay isn’t putting President 
Trump in a bad position. In fact, it is 
further proving the partisan motiva-
tions that have been driving the House 
impeachment inquiry from the very be-
ginning. 
Speaker PELOSI obviously isn’t doing 
this for the good of House Democrats. 
Their role in the impeachment inquiry 
is finished. As I mentioned, a number 
of her own Members think she is mak-
ing a big mistake by holding up the ar-
ticles. 
This clearly isn’t giving our Senate 
Democratic colleagues a leg up. Sev-
eral of our colleagues in the Senate 
have voiced their desire to get this 
thing going, as one has said. In fact, I 
think it is actually harming our Sen-
ate Democratic colleagues who are on 
the Presidential campaign trail. 
Can you think what Senator WARREN, 
Senator SANDERS, Senator KLOBUCHAR, 
Senator BENNET, and Senator BOOKER— 
who, until this morning, were all vying 
for the chance to be President—are 
thinking about the desirability of sit-
ting here in the Senate Chamber 6 days 
a week while the Iowa caucuses are 
coming up on February 3, the New 
Hampshire primary, South Carolina, 
Nevada, among others? The Iowa cau-
cuses are happening just 3 weeks from 
today. New Hampshire’s primary is the 
week after that. These Senators on the 
Democratic side who are running for 
the Democratic nominations have cam-
paigns that are in high gear. I imagine 
the last place they want to be is in 
Washington, DC, sitting in this Cham-
ber during an impeachment trial. 
During the trial, every Member of 
the Senate will be sitting at our desks, 
6 days a week, until we are finished. 
And no, we will not have our electronic 
devices. I just saw a piece of cabinetry 
in the cloakroom where we will be re-
quired to turn over our iPads and our 
iPhones. This will just be us, not 
speaking—we don’t have a speaking 
role; we have a listening role—sitting 
for hours each afternoon, 6 days a 
week, until we finish this process. That 
doesn’t leave a lot of time for our Sen-
ate colleagues who are running for the 
Democratic nomination to talk to vot-
ers in Iowa or New Hampshire. 
The longer Speaker PELOSI holds on 
to the Articles of Impeachment, the 
closer a trial gets to overlapping with 
those key dates. You have to imagine 
that our friends on the other side who 
are running for President are getting a 
little nervous. CORY BOOKER, who left 
the campaign trail this morning, re-
cently said this trial could be a ‘‘big, 
big blow’’ to his campaign. Even a 
short, 2-week trial could mean ‘‘lit-
erally dozens of events we won’t be 
able do.’’ While that is no longer true 
for Senator BOOKER, it is for the re-
maining candidates. 
Senator WARREN
shared this same 
sentiment, and she thinks being in 
Washington would prevent her from

being able to build critical, personal 
connections on the campaign trail. Had 
Speaker PELOSI
immediately trans-
mitted the Articles of Impeachment at 
the end of last year, it would have been 
the first item on the Senate’s agenda 
when we reconvened in January. We 
could have used the Clinton model to 
guide the process, the same process the 
leader has promised since before the ar-
ticles even passed. 
I can’t help but imagine that the 
Senate and the American people would 
be close to putting this entire saga be-
hind us, but, instead, the Speaker sat 
on the articles. She stood in the way of 
the Senate’s duty to try the impeach-
ment trial, and she stood in the way of 
President Trump’s due process rights. 
The only people who seem to gain 
anything from this are the Democrats 
who are running for President but who 
are not U.S. Senators and, thus, aren’t 
going to be tied up during the impeach-
ment trial. Oddly enough, one of these 
candidates and his son are looming fig-
ures in the impeachment inquiry. If 
you are Joe Biden, Pete Buttigieg, or 
any other candidate who isn’t a Mem-
ber of the Senate, you have to be glad 
that the Speaker sat on these articles 
for nearly 4 weeks. Having your com-
petitors stuck in Washington, literally 
in their seats, while you are hitting the 
campaign trail there—well, that seems 
like a pretty good advantage to me. 
The timeline the Speaker created is 
all but sure to interfere with the Iowa 
caucuses. It is remarkable that Demo-
crats’ effort to impeach a President of 
the opposing party could end up having 
a negative impact on the Presidential 
candidates of their own. All of this is 
to say, it is time to bring this embar-
rassing chapter to an end. 
Republicans and Democrats and the 
American people all agree that it is 
time to get the Articles of Impeach-
ment to the Senate so that we can try 
the case according to our duties under 
the Constitution and the American 
people and the Congress can move on. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to 
call the roll. 
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mrs. 
BLACKBURN). Without objection, it is so 
ordered. 
RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
Democratic leader is recognized. 
IMPEACHMENT 
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, 
the President of the United States is 
charged with committing a grave in-
jury to our democracy: trying to shake 
down a foreign leader to get him to 
interfere in our elections, using the 
powers of his public office to benefit 
himself and jaundice our elections. 
These are the kinds of actions the 
Framers of our Constitution most 
feared when they forged the impeach-
ment powers of the Congress. 
The House of Representatives decided 
the President’s conduct warranted his 
impeachment. The Senate’s constitu-
tional duty now is to try that case to 
the best of our ability with honesty, 
with integrity, with impartially, and 
with fairness. 
A fair trial is one that considers all 
the facts and gives the Senators all the 
information they need to make an in-
formed decision. That means relevant 
witnesses. That means relevant docu-
ments. That means the truth. Without 
these things, a Senate trial would be-
come a farce, a nationally televised 
meeting of the mock trial club. 
There is a reason that, with one ex-
ception, every impeachment trial of 
any official in the history of the United 
States has featured witnesses. That 
one exception was the trial of a fellow 
Senator in the 18th century, and the 
question of his impeachment was dis-
missed on jurisdictional grounds before 
the issue of witnesses could ever come 
up. Every other trial has had witnesses. 
So when Leader MCCONNELL
talks 
precedent, he is talking about wit-
nesses, plain and simple. 
The Democratic request for four fact 
witnesses and three specific sets of rel-
evant documents is very much in line 
with our history. We don’t know what 
those witnesses will say. We don’t 
know what those documents will re-
veal. They could help the President’s 
case, or they could hurt it. Regardless 
of the consequences for the President, 
Democrats are on a quest for the truth. 
At the moment, Leader MCCONNELL 
and Senate Republicans are opposing 
witnesses and documents, but they 
can’t seem to muster a real reason 
why. Instead, Leader MCCONNELL and 
the Republican leadership have labeled 
a Democratic request for witnesses and 
documents as ‘‘political.’’ If seeking 
the truth is political, if doing our con-
stitutional duty is political in the 
minds of our Republican colleagues, 
then the Republican Party is in trou-
ble. History is not kind to political 
parties that fight to hide the truth. 
History is not kind to parties that par-
ticipate in coverups. 
If anything, these absurd accusations 
by Republicans demonstrate just how 
unable Republicans have been to make 
an affirmative case about why the Sen-
ate shouldn’t ask for evidence. The Re-
publican argument against calling wit-
nesses is basically nonexistent. The 
most commonly repeated talking point 
from the other side is that we should 
follow the example of the 1999 Clinton 
trial by deciding on witnesses after 
both 
sides 
complete 
their 
presen-
tations. 
Republicans are so unwilling to argue 
against witnesses, they can only sup-
port delaying the decision, like a bro-
ken Magic 8 Ball that keeps saying 
‘‘Ask again later.’’ Leader MCCONNELL 
has represented his position as being 
fair and open-minded. He has said he is 
not foreclosing the possibility of wit-
nesses—the Senate should just discuss 
them later. As I have made clear, this 
makes no sense from a trial perspec-
tive. Why should both sides make their 
entire presentations before even con-
sidering requesting evidence? Leader 
MCCONNELL’s proposal is completely 
backward and through the looking 
glass. 
Let’s 
consider 
what, 
practically 
speaking, Leader MCCONNELL is sug-
gesting when he claims to be open to 
witnesses at a later date. What does he 
really mean when he says that? 
In the 1999 Clinton trial, the Senate 
waited 3 weeks into the trial to con-
front the issue of witnesses. Once they 
decided on three witnesses, with the 
support of several Senate Republicans 
here today, including Leader MCCON-
NELL, it took time for the witnesses to 
be deposed and for the Senate to con-
sider what they had submitted. Ulti-
mately, the Clinton trial ran for 2 more 
weeks. 
I want my fellow Republican Sen-
ators to ask themselves: After the Sen-
ate concludes the part of the trial that 
Leader 
MCCONNELL
wants 
to 
get 
through, do you think he really wants 
to extend the trial by several weeks? 
Leader MCCONNELL has gone on record 
and said that he wants the trial to span 
2 weeks total. Leader MCCONNELL has 
gone on record and said: ‘‘After we’ve 
heard the arguments, we ought to vote 
and move on.’’ 
Are 
we 
to 
believe 
that 
Leader 
MCCONNELL, after 2 weeks is up, will 
really have an open mind about extend-
ing the trial several more weeks, or 
does he want to delay the question of 
witnesses and documents until later 
and then, when the time comes, exert 
enormous pressure on Republicans to 
reject them to avoid prolonging the 
trial? He will say: We can’t go on any 
further; let’s just end it. Every Repub-
lican—every Republican—should ask 
themselves that question. 
Democrats are not advocating a 
lengthy and drawn-out trial. That is 
why we proposed handling this issue up 
front, so evidence can be part of the 
presentations and so we don’t have to 
extend the trial unnecessarily. We have 
proposed a schedule that would save 
the Senate a whole lot of time. 
Before voting on a resolution that 
would punt the question of witnesses 
until after all the presentations are 
complete, Senate Republicans must 
ask 
themselves: 
What 
are 
Leader 
MCCONNELL’s true intentions? 
IRAN 
Over the past 3 years, the President’s 
impulsive and erratic approach to for-
eign policy has made America less safe 
and less respected. Whether it is Syria 
or North Korea or Russia, the Presi-
dent’s actions have failed to advance 
our national security—in some cases, 
failed miserably. 
Now, after the aftermath of the U.S. 
strike on General Soleimani, the Presi-
dent and his foreign policy team have 
insisted that ‘‘the world is a much 
safer place today.’’ That is what Sec-
retary Pompeo said. In recent weeks,

January 13, 2020 
however, the President’s actions have 
increased the risk of Iran rushing to 
develop a nuclear weapon, weakened 
our ability to fight ISIS, and strength-
ened the hands of Russia and China in 
the Middle East, at America’s expense. 
How in the world is the world ‘‘a much 
safer place today’’ than when President 
Trump took office? It is not. 
Every American should ask them-
selves this question: Are we safer today 
after these actions, with Russia and 
China on the ascent, with our ability 
to fight ISIS weakened, and with Iran 
rushing to make a nuclear weapon? 
Every American should ask this ques-
tion. 
As we continue to grapple with the 
fallout from the President’s actions, 
there are several points for my col-
leagues to consider. The Trump admin-
istration has not been transparent with 
Congress or the American people. The 
Trump administration did not consult 
with Congress prior to the strike on 
Soleimani and had classified the War 
Powers Act notification sent to Con-
gress without any justification. There 
is no reason much of it should be clas-
sified. 
It took over a week for the adminis-
tration to conduct a briefing for the 
Senate about the strike and then the 
briefers, top members of the adminis-
tration, practically ran out of the room 
after only a few questions, putting the 
‘‘brief’’ in briefing. 
Today Secretary Pompeo refused to 
testify in the House about the adminis-
tration’s decisions. On something as se-
rious as the current situation in Iran, 
the administration’s lack of trans-
parency has been completely unaccept-
able. While the President has promised 
to keep us out of endless wars in the 
Middle East, his actions have moved us 
closer to exactly such a war, making 
the American people and American 
forces less safe. 
While I am thankful that nobody was 
hurt 
by 
Iran’s 
retaliatory 
missile 
strikes last week, there are several rea-
sons to be concerned. Iran can strike us 
in other ways in the months ahead 
with cyber warfare, proxies, or estab-
lished terror networks that have desta-
bilized the Middle East for decades. 
The Supreme Leader himself has said 
the recent strikes on U.S. installations 
in Iraq were just ‘‘one slap’’ and ‘‘not 
enough.’’ Iran has also announced it 
will no longer abide by any restraints 
on its nuclear program. 
The President has tweeted ‘‘all is 
well’’ with Iran now. You would have 
to be delusional to believe that. It is 
sort of like saying North Korea is no 
longer a nuclear threat. 
In many ways, the President has 
made Americans less safe. Unfortu-
nately, what is happening with Iran is 
typical of how the President has con-
ducted foreign policy over the last 3 
years—erratic, impulsive, and without 
regard for long-term consequences. As 
a result, the President’s foreign policy 
is dangerously incompetent. 
We cannot say that any major prob-
lem area around the globe was better 
off than it was 3 years ago. Because of 
all this—because of this erratic, impul-
sive foreign policy—the Senate must 
not allow the President to proceed un-
checked. Senator KAINE’s War Powers 
Resolution is needed now more than 
ever, and I am glad the Senate will 
consider the resolution this week. 
Senator SANDERS also has a bill that 
would deny funding for a war with Iran. 
We should consider that legislation, 
which I cosponsored as well. As the sit-
uation with Iran continues to evolve, 
the administration must come back 
and finish what they barely started 
last week, keeping Congress briefed 
and up to speed with all major develop-
ments, troop deployments, and strat-
egy. 
On matters of war and peace, for the 
safety of our troops, the security of our 
Nation is at stake. Congressional over-
sight and congressional prerogatives 
are not optional; they are mandatory. 
CHINA TRADE AGREEMENT 
Madam President, finally, on China. 
Later this week, China and the 
United States will participate in a 
signing ceremony for a so-called phase 
one of the trade agreement, in which 
President Trump has agreed to cut 
some tariffs on Chinese goods in return 
for temporary assurances with China 
to buy more agricultural products from 
the United States. 
After 18 months, the President’s 
phase one deal with China is stunning 
in how little substance it achieves at 
such a high cost. It fails to address 
deep structural disparities in our trade 
relationship 
with 
China—disparities 
that will harm American workers and 
businesses for years. It also seems like 
this deal could send a signal to Chinese 
negotiators that the United States can 
be steamrolled and that President 
Trump can be played every time. 
Now, I have publicly praised Presi-
dent Trump when he has taken a tough 
stance with trade negotiations with 
China at some political risk. I have 
said his instincts on China were even 
better 
than 
President 
Bush’s 
and 
Obama’s. So I come to this as someone 
who is truly rooting for the President 
to succeed. For these reasons, I am 
even more disappointed in what Presi-
dent Trump has managed to achieve— 
or, rather, failed to achieve. 
According to public reports and by 
the administration’s own admission, 
this deal does little to end China’s 
greatest trade abuses. It does not se-
cure commitments on state-sponsored 
cyber theft, China’s massive subsidies 
to domestic industries, preferential 
treatment to state-owned enterprises 
or dumping Chinese goods into the U.S. 
market. 
In signing this agreement, President 
Trump removes our most effective 
source of leverage in exchange for me-
diocre, temporary agriculture conces-
sions, which may not even come to 
pass, given China’s past history. Essen-
tially, 
President 
Trump 
is 
selling 
China the farm in exchange for a few 
magic beans—in this case, soybeans. 
The American people need to under-
stand exactly what is in this phase one 
deal before the United States agrees to 
continue negotiations with China. So 
today I am sending the President a let-
ter with a series of crucial questions: 
What commitments, if any, has China 
made with regard to its harmful gov-
ernment subsidy programs? What com-
mitments, if any, has China made con-
cerning their state-owned enterprises? 
What about its practice of dumping 
products into our markets or their 
state-sanctioned 
cyber 
theft? 
What 
help will be afforded to our farmers 
who have lost billions in the last 2 
years, when China has already signed 
many long-term contracts with other 
soybean producers in places like Argen-
tina and Brazil? 
These issues must be resolved before 
we move forward, but I fear that after 
months of costly negotiations, Presi-
dent Trump—facing the election—has 
sold out American farmers, businesses, 
and workers in exchange for a photo 
op. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from California. 
IMPEACHMENT 
Ms. HARRIS. Madam President, just 
across the street from where I stand 
today is the U.S. Supreme Court. That 
building has four words etched in mar-
ble above its entrance: ‘‘Equal Justice 
Under Law.’’ 
The promise of those four words is 
that in our country, our system of jus-
tice must treat everyone equally re-
gardless of their race, gender, sexual 
orientation, gender identity, religion, 
disability, or socioeconomic status, but 
too many people in our country grow 
up knowing and experiencing that in 
America we have two systems of jus-
tice—one in which certain people are 
held accountable and another in which 
powerful people like Donald Trump es-
cape accountability altogether. 
This has been true from the first 
days of our Nation’s history, when a 
group of men gathered in Philadelphia 
to debate lofty notions of justice and 
equality, yet produced a document that 
literally counted Black Americans as 
fractions of a person. 
In the Declaration of Independence, 
we were told that ‘‘all men are created 
equal,’’ but we know that in our Na-
tion’s founding at that time, the policy 
of our Nation was to rob indigenous 
people of their land and their liveli-
hood and to exclude women from the 
right to vote. 
So to make true the promise of 
America and move us toward a more 
perfect Union, people have organized 
and fought and marched for justice. 
From the suffragettes to Dr. Martin 
Luther King, Jr., those fights have won 
us progress toward a more just and in-
clusive nation, but, clearly, there is 
still more work to be done to achieve 
equal justice under law.

you sit in jail before trial is too often

January 13, 2020 
rather than the size of your crime, we 
have not yet achieved equal justice 
under law. There is more work to be 
done when young people selling drugs 
on the corner too often become felons 
for life, while white-collar criminals 
face no accountability. 
There is more work to be done when 
regarding the sexual assault of women, 
the current President has said: 
When you’re a star, they let you do it. You 
can do anything. 
There is work to be done when the 
American people know that the rules 
aren’t equally enforced against power-
ful people. Unless we acknowledge 
these truths, too many Americans will 
remain distrustful of our institutions 
and cynical about our government and 
our leaders. 
This is the point, my colleagues: We 
now face a choice. Will we insist that 
we have one system of justice that ap-
plies equally to all or will we continue 
to have two systems of justice in which 
some are above the law? 
Later this week, the Senate will like-
ly begin the impeachment trial of 
President Donald Trump. This moment 
in our history will have consequences. 
The Senate is charged with deciding 
whether the President of the United 
States, with all his power and supposed 
wealth, will be held accountable for his 
actions and whether we will finally live 
up to the principle of ‘‘Equal Justice 
Under Law.’’ 
This is why I speak to you today, 
fully aware that I stand on the shoul-
ders of those who come before me in 
our Nation’s ongoing fight for equality. 
I speak because I was raised by people 
who spent most of their lives demand-
ing justice in the face of racism, misog-
yny, bigotry, and inequality. I speak 
because I have dedicated my entire ca-
reer to upholding the rule of law and 
bringing integrity to our system of jus-
tice. I speak to ensure that everyone in 
California and throughout our country 
can enjoy the rights and freedoms 
guaranteed to them by the U.S. Con-
stitution. 
As a U.S. Senator, I speak fully pre-
pared to uphold my solemn oath to 
support and defend the Constitution of 
the United States and to do impartial 
justice according to the Constitution 
and laws, and to affirm that my first 
obligation is to serve the people of the 
United States—all the people. 
I hope my colleagues can agree that 
our Nation’s Founders had the fore-
sight to create a system of checks and 
balances and anticipate the need to re-
move a President who might yield to 
foreign influence or use the Presidency 
for personal power and benefit. 
Our Founders feared that a day like 
this might come, and so they empow-
ered the U.S. Congress with the tool of 
impeachment to hold a lawless Presi-
dent accountable. 
This week, after months of investiga-
tion, sworn testimony, public hearings 
and debate, the House of Representa-
tives will likely send to the U.S. Sen-
ate 
two 
Articles 
of 
Impeachment. 
These articles charge President Trump 
with abusing his power for his personal 
and political gain and with obstructing 
Congress’s effort to investigate his 
misconduct. 
In this trial, the U.S. Senate must 
not only consider the charges against 
the President but also conduct itself in 
a way that demonstrates to the Amer-
ican people that in our system of jus-
tice no one is above the law. Each Sen-
ator here must exhibit the kind of 
moral and ethical leadership that this 
President abandoned when he pressured 
a foreign nation to interfere in our 
elections. 
There is no question that President 
Trump’s misconduct has left a vacuum 
of leadership in our country, and the 
American people are therefore rightly 
looking to the U.S. Senate to dem-
onstrate that their leaders are worthy 
of the public’s trust. 
The American people should expect 
their Senators to seek the truth, not 
cover up the facts. So let’s honor our 
oath to defend the Constitution by 
doing the job the American people have 
entrusted to us. 
Let us ensure that this trial is a 
search for truth and that we follow the 
facts where they lead and come to a 
verdict based on all of the available 
evidence. 
Let us do our jobs and insist that we 
hear 
from 
Mick 
Mulvaney, 
John 
Bolton, and anyone with a firsthand 
knowledge of the President’s mis-
conduct. Let us demand that the White 
House turn over additional emails and 
documents that shed light on the 
President’s motives for withholding 
military aid from Ukraine. And let us 
be clear that an order from this Presi-
dent to block evidence or witness testi-
mony will itself be further evidence of 
his efforts to obstruct the U.S. Con-
gress. 
The importance of this moment in 
our history cannot be overstated. What 
we do in this trial will show the world 
who we are as a country. Our actions 
will also send a message to further 
Presidents and future Presidents of the 
United States about the kind of con-
duct that is acceptable from the leader 
of our Nation. 
As the U.S. Senate, we must say that 
it is unacceptable for a President to 
shake down a vulnerable foreign nation 
for personal or political benefit. We 
must say with one voice that no Presi-
dent can disregard the legitimate over-
sight authority of the U.S. Congress, 
and we must say, as leaders of the 
United States of America, that in our 
system of justice, everyone—every-
one—will be held accountable for their 
actions, including the President of the 
United States. 
My final point is that, years from 
now, people are going to judge. They 
are going to judge whether we rose to 
the solemn occasion that is the im-
peachment trial of the President of the 
United States, and we cannot be pas-
sive in this moment. I am mindful of 
Coretta Scott King’s words: 
Freedom is never really won. You earn it 
and win it with each generation. 
It is incumbent on this generation to 
fight for a system of justice in which 
all are treated equally. 
In that ongoing fight, we, as the U.S. 
Senate, must agree that we cannot 
speak about the ideals of equality and 
justice and then act in ways that vio-
late those very principles. It is our 
duty, both as Senators and as proud 
Americans, to protect the Constitu-
tion, to earn the people’s trust, and to 
prove to the American people that it is 
still within the power of the U.S. Con-
gress to hold the President account-
able. History is watching. Our actions 
here will shape this body’s legacy. 
I urge my colleagues to have the 
courage, the foresight, and the patriot-
ism to act in the interest of our Nation 
and its people. I urge my colleagues to 
fight for one system of justice in the 
United States of America and to ensure 
that no one is above the law. I urge my 
colleagues to reaffirm the most basic 
of American principles—that ours is 
not the government of one man but a 
government of the people, by the peo-
ple, and for the people. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
BOOZMAN). Without objection, it is so 
ordered. 
NOMINATION OF PETER GAYNOR 
Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I rise 
today asking the Senate to confirm the 
nomination of Mr. Peter Gaynor to be 
the 
Administrator 
of 
the 
Federal 
Emergency Management Agency. The 
FEMA Administrator serves as the 
principal adviser to the President, the 
Homeland Security Council, and the 
Secretary of Homeland Security for all 
matters related to emergency manage-
ment. 
The Administrator’s principal duties 
include the operation of the National 
Response Coordination Center and the 
effective support of all emergency sup-
port functions. More broadly, the Ad-
ministrator coordinates the implemen-
tation of a risk-based, all-hazards 
strategy 
to 
prepare 
for, 
mitigate 
against, respond to, and recover from 
natural disasters, acts of terrorism, 
and other manmade disasters. 
The Agency has over 20,000 employees 
and a surge capacity force of over 9,000 
volunteers to respond during local and 
national emergencies, working around 
the clock when necessary. 
The President’s nominee to head 
FEMA, Mr. Peter Gaynor, has exten-
sive experience at the local, State, and 
Federal emergency management levels. 
In 2018, the Senate confirmed Mr. 
Gaynor as the Deputy Administrator of 
FEMA, and for most of last year he 
served as the Acting Administrator.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S157 
January 13, 2020 
Prior to Federal service, he was the di-
rector of Rhode Island’s Emergency 
Management Agency. For 26 years 
prior to his service in emergency man-
agement positions, Mr. Gaynor served 
as an enlisted marine and infantry offi-
cer in the U.S. Marine Corps. 
Mr. Gaynor’s experience will be valu-
able as FEMA works to implement the 
Disaster Recovery Reform Act. A pri-
mary goal of that legislation is to help 
ensure that the model for response to 
and recovery from natural and man-
made disasters is one that is locally ex-
ecuted, State managed, and federally 
supported. 
I am pleased to say that Mr. Gaynor’s 
nomination has broad bipartisan sup-
port. Our committee approved his nom-
ination by voice vote in November. 
Among others, he has received endorse-
ments from Rhode Island Governor 
Gina Raimondo, Senator JACK REED, 
Big City Emergency Managers, and the 
International 
Association 
of 
Fire 
Chiefs. 
I am grateful to Mr. Gaynor for his 
willingness to continue serving his 
country in this role and to his family 
for their continued sacrifice. I strongly 
encourage my colleagues to vote yes on 
his nomination. 
I yield the floor.

The PRESIDING OFFICER. On this

The motion is agreed to. 
The Senator from Alaska. 
Mr. SULLIVAN. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent to enter into a col-
loquy with my colleagues from Rhode 
Island and New Jersey. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
SAVE OUR SEAS 2.0 
Mr. SULLIVAN. Mr. President, I am 
sure all of my colleagues are going to 
want to listen to this speech. I am on 
the floor with my colleagues Senator 
WHITEHOUSE and Senator MENENDEZ to 
talk about some very important legis-
lation for our country, legislation that 
passed the Senate last week. It is the 
Save Our Seas 2.0 legislation. 
I begin by thanking Senator WHITE-
HOUSE and Senator MENENDEZ for their 
leadership on this bill. 
We are going to talk a little bit 
about the importance of it, why it mat-
ters to Alaska, to New Jersey, to 
Rhode Island, and to the whole coun-
try. This is a significant piece of legis-
lation. It is, really, the most com-
prehensive piece of legislation to pass 
the Congress—to pass the Senate—that 
has dealt with ocean debris and ocean 
pollution—ever. That sounds like a 
pretty hyperbolic phrase, but it is true. 
We checked with the CRS. There has 
been nothing more comprehensive than 
this piece of legislation that tackles an 
issue we all care about—clean oceans. 
As a matter of fact, on Thursday 
night, 100 Senators passed this after 
there having been a lot of work on the 
Committee on Commerce, Science, and 
Transportation, on the Committee on 
Environment and Public Works, and on 
the Committee on Foreign Relations. 
After about a year of work on this, we 
finally got it passed. A number of Sen-
ators—Democrats and Republicans— 
were cosponsors. I really want to thank 
the two Senators who are on the floor 
right 
now. 
In 
particular, 
Senator 
WHITEHOUSE has been a real leader on 
these issues that deal with oceans. This 
is an environmental issue that we can 
solve. Republicans and Democrats in 
the Congress, the Trump administra-
tion in the White House, and environ-
mental and industry groups are all 
pulling on the same oar, and we had a 
good start last Thursday on what this 
does. 
I want to turn it over to my col-
league from Rhode Island because, in 
many ways, he has been the real lead-
er, the driver, and is the founder of the 
Oceans Caucus. Bit by bit, legislation 
by legislation, he and I cosponsored the 
first Save Our Seas Act in the last Con-
gress. To much fanfare in the Oval Of-
fice, the President signed it, and now 
you are starting to see people work on 
this. There is a whole section in the 
USMCA on cleaning up our oceans. We 
have gone from Save Our Seas 1.0, 
which has already passed into law, to 
Save Our Seas 2.0. I think it is excit-
ing, and I think the American people 
don’t always hear about the bipartisan 
work that is actually getting done on 
big issues that matter to our Nation. 
There is a lot. 
Cleaning up our oceans is one that 
matters to everybody and, certainly, to 
my State, with its having more coast-
line than the rest of the lower 48 com-
bined. You don’t even have to live in a 
coastal State to care about this issue. 
Some of our cosponsors on this bill—on 
both sides of the aisle—are from States 
that don’t even have any coastline. 
That is how important it is. 
I want to turn it over to Senator 
WHITEHOUSE. I thank him for his and 
Senator MENENDEZ’ leadership. We will 
talk a little bit about what is in it and 
what we are going to do next. This is a 
good day for the environment in Amer-
ica. It is a good day for the oceans not 
just in our country, not just in Alaska, 
not just in Rhode Island but in the 
world. As a nation, if we are leading on 
this, which this legislation does, then 
we are going to be able to help clean up 
our oceans all over the world. We had a

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S158 
January 13, 2020 
good start here on Thursday night in 
the U.S. Senate when we passed this 
bill legislatively unanimously. 
Again, to my colleague from Rhode 
Island, the floor is his. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Rhode Island. 
Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I 
come to the floor with a bunch of 
thank-yous after Thursday evening’s 
happy news that Save Our Seas 2.0 
passed the U.S. Senate by unanimous 
consent. 
I thank all of the Senate Members of 
our bipartisan Oceans Caucus. The 
Oceans Caucus has been a really good 
forum for getting these bills moving to 
a point at which they can pass by 
unanimous consent. I and Senator 
MURKOWSKI, who is Senator SULLIVAN’s 
colleague from Alaska, set it up years 
ago. It now has over 40 Members. It is 
very bipartisan, and it has had a really 
important role in moving bipartisan 
oceans legislation. 
So, Oceans Caucus, thank you. 
This bill, Save Our Seas 2.0, had to go 
through three committees. It had to go 
through Commerce, Foreign Relations, 
and Environment and Public Works. 
Let me start in reverse order because 
Senator BARRASSO, the chairman of the 
Committee on Environment and Public 
Works, is here on the Senate floor. I 
express my appreciation to him and my 
appreciation to our ranking member, 
Senator CARPER, for having shepherded 
this through the committee with unan-
imous committee support, and that 
gave it a lot of momentum to go on to 
Foreign Relations and to Commerce. 
So, my friend Senator BARRASSO, 
thank you, sir. I do appreciate it very 
much. I think this is a score, a good 
win. A good deed was done here. 
Foreign Relations was also very im-
portant, and Senator MENENDEZ, our 
ranking member, is about to speak, so 
I will not steal his thunder. He has 
been an incredibly valuable part of this 
triumvirate, and I am extremely grate-
ful to Senator MENENDEZ. 
Also, on the Committee on Com-
merce, Science, and Transportation, 
Senators WICKER and CANTWELL were 
very helpful about making sure this 
got through Commerce and were help-
ful once it was on the floor. 
Most of all, though, my thanks go to 
Senator SULLIVAN, of Alaska. We start-
ed down this road quite some time ago. 
We tentatively got into the space of 
ocean plastic waste with a simple hear-
ing in the Committee on Environment 
and Public Works. He had an essential 
role in making that happen because 
there was a turf conflict between our 
subcommittee and the EPW and the 
Subcommittee 
on 
Science, 
Oceans, 
Fisheries, and Weather within the 
Commerce Committee. 
Now, if you are not from the Senate, 
you think that this is all crazy talk, 
but if you are in the Senate, it is a 
really serious problem to have to re-
solve. We had the very good fortune of 
having the chairman of the Fisheries 
Subcommittee of the Commerce Com-
mittee and the chairman of our sub-
committee of the Environment and 
Public Works Committee being the 
same individual, none other than Sen-
ator DAN SULLIVAN. So he went out and 
had a nice debate with himself and was 
able to negotiate a happy resolution of 
that turf dispute, and the hearing went 
forward. Without that, it never would 
have happened. So that was the open-
ing bid. 
Then we got to 1.0, which, admit-
tedly, was not a very big bill, but it 
was going to test the proposition: Was 
the Senate willing to legislate on ma-
rine plastic waste? Yes. We got a big, 
booming, 100-vote support for that in 
the Senate. Senator SULLIVAN was so 
happy with that outcome that we im-
mediately went to work on crafting 2.0, 
which, as Senator SULLIVAN has point-
ed out, is not just a beachhead but is 
significant marine plastic waste legis-
lation. It will push the administration 
to do a lot more, for more than half of 
the waste in the oceans comes from 5 
Asian countries, and more than 80 per-
cent of the waste in the oceans comes 
from 10 rivers in Asia and Africa. This 
is a solvable problem if we direct at-
tention and resources and solutions to 
that problem, and I am really looking 
forward to following up on that. 
I am really looking forward to get-
ting right to work on Save Our Seas 3.0 
because we are not done here. There is 
a lot of plastic mess out there to clean 
up, and there is a lot of energy around 
getting even more done. 
So, Senator SULLIVAN, you have my 
great appreciation. 
I will close, if I may, with one un-
likely thank-you. As Senator SULLIVAN 
mentioned, this reminded me that 
there are Senators who supported this 
who don’t even have coasts. They are 
from those square end States in the 
middle of the country that don’t have 
coasts. One of them who has been very 
important to this has been Senator 
INHOFE, of Oklahoma. 
Now, on climate change, Senator 
INHOFE
and I are at each other’s 
throats pretty much all of the time. We 
are always having fights about climate 
change. I call him a climate denier, 
and he calls me a climate alarmist. We 
go back and forth, fighting about cli-
mate change. Yet, on this, he has been 
an essential ally, and having his sup-
port has sent, I think, a terrific signal 
to the Senate that, hey, if Senator 
WHITEHOUSE and Senator INHOFE can 
agree on this, there is room for me in 
there somewhere. 
And so a final thank you to Senator 
INHOFE of Oklahoma, but the biggest 
thank you, of course, is to Senator 
SULLIVAN, who really made this hap-
pen. 
With that, I yield to my colleague 
and friend Senator MENENDEZ, who has 
been so important to this, so he can 
add his thoughts. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from New Jersey. 
Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, it is 
a pleasure to join Senators WHITE-
HOUSE and SULLIVAN on the floor today 
to thank our colleagues for passing the 
legislation that we have all coauthored 
to combat the environmental crisis of 
plastic waste in our oceans. 
Our partnership represents both the 
geographic and political urgency be-
hind this growing crisis. Save Our Seas 
2.0 is a multifaceted effort that will 
help the United States to better pre-
vent plastic pollution, respond to ma-
rine debris emergencies, and leverage 
U.S. foreign policy and international 
engagement to prevent and clean up 
foreign sources of plastic pollution. 
We have a responsibility to protect 
the health of the world’s oceans, which 
regulate our climate, produce half of 
the Earth’s oxygen supply, and provide 
food to 2.6 billion people worldwide. 
The environmental health of our 
world depends on healthy oceans, and 
plastic pollution and marine debris are 
like cholesterol clogging global eco-
systems in countless ways. The reality 
is that plastic waste in our ocean 
knows no borders. What may be a plas-
tic wrapper floating down a river in 
China today could be microplastic in 
your tuna salad tomorrow. 
Let me thank Senator WHITEHOUSE, 
who has been so much engaged in our 
oceans since his coming to the Sen-
ate—well, even before that, but, cer-
tainly, as a leader in the Senate—and 
Senator 
SULLIVAN
for 
their 
long-
standing bipartisan leadership on this 
issue and cooperation on the bill. 
I was happy to have supported the 
original Save Our Seas Act in the 115th 
Congress. Last year, when several 
international news stories exposed the 
tragic environmental impact of plastic 
on our marine environment, I began 
working on legislation to enhance U.S. 
international engagement on this truly 
global crisis, which served as the basis 
for title II of our bill. At the time, I 
was not immediately aware that Sen-
ators SULLIVAN and WHITEHOUSE were 
planning a second act, so to speak, and 
I dearly appreciate being a part of the 
Save Our Seas team. 
I also want to thank Chairman RISCH 
for supporting and advancing the inter-
national 
components 
of 
this 
bill 
through the Foreign Relations Com-
mittee, as well as all of the chairs and 
rankings who have already been men-
tioned. 
I think that advancing three compo-
nent parts of the bill through all of 
these respective committees, which is 
no small feat, and the 20 bipartisan co-
sponsors shows the Senate’s broad sup-
port for action on plastic waste. 
New Jerseyans know all too well the 
threat of plastic pollution. Our pristine 
beaches attract millions of people to 
the Jersey Shore each year, and our 
coastal waters support everything from 
fishing and recreation to the flow of 
trade, to our ports and harbors. No one 
wants to swim in plastic or eat fish 
that fed on microplastic. That is why 
25 New Jersey townships have passed 
local ordinances banning or phasing 
down disposable plastic products, and

another 26 may soon join them. There 
is also legislation pending in the New 
Jersey State Legislature to limit the 
proliferation of disposal plastics in 
New Jersey’s economy. 
With 40 percent of Americans living 
in coastal communities, my constitu-
ents back home are far from the only 
ones grappling with the hazards of 
plastic pollution in our oceans. 
There is no question we still have 
work to do. As our bill heads to the 
House, I look forward to continuing 
these efforts with Senators WHITE-
HOUSE and SULLIVAN and our cospon-
sors as we engage House leaders to act 
on the bill this year. 
Again, thank you to my colleagues. 
It is good. I know it doesn’t always get 
the headlines. The essence of a good 
story seems to be conflict not coopera-
tion, but I am thrilled to be a part of 
cooperation that could make a dif-
ference in the lives not just of our 
oceans but of our families. 
I yield the floor. 
Mr. SULLIVAN. Mr. President, I 
want to thank Senator MENENDEZ and 
Senator WHITEHOUSE
again for their 
leadership on this. 
We have all seen the pictures and the 
news stories. The issue, though, is a se-
vere one. The World Economic Forum 
has estimated that if we don’t do any-
thing about this big crisis of ocean de-
bris, but particularly the issue of plas-
tics in the ocean, there are estimates 
that by 2050 there will be more plastics 
by weight in the world’s ocean than 
there are fish. We can’t let that hap-
pen. 
So what we have done is we have put 
together this bill. As already men-
tioned, there were three different com-
mittees. There is an element on the do-
mestic innovation side that creates a 
Marine Debris Foundation. That is a 
congressionally chartered private orga-
nization. 
Think of groups that matter to 
Americans. There are dozens of these 
kinds of foundations, but they are im-
portant. They send a signal that the 
Congress of the United States cares 
about these things. Think about the 
Red Cross, the American Legion, and 
the National Parks Foundation. These 
are all congressionally chartered orga-
nizations. 
The 
new 
Marine 
Debris 
Foundation will be one of them. 
The American Government is focused 
on this. It is an opportunity for the pri-
vate sector, and we have seen some in-
dustries step up. There is a group 
called the Alliance to End Plastic 
Waste that has pledged $1.5 billion to 
start addressing this problem. That is 
not small change. It is going to need 
that kind of money. Perhaps some of 
that can go into this foundation. 
There is an innovation prize. A lot of 
focus in our bill is on innovation so 
that we can solve some of the big chal-
lenges in chemistry—a plastic bottle 
that could fully biodegrade. We don’t 
have that yet, but these are some of 
the things that the bill looks at doing. 
Of course, Senator MENENDEZ talked 
about the very substantial foreign rela-
tions component because so much of 
the plastic waste in the oceans comes 
from countries in Asia and Africa and 
10 rivers, estimating almost 80 to 90 
percent of all of the plastic waste in all 
of the oceans. So, again, it is solvable 
because it is definable. 
Then, the third component is improv-
ing domestic infrastructure to prevent 
marine debris through new grants and 
foreign studies for waste management 
mitigation. So this covers a lot of dif-
ferent areas—innovation, our domestic 
side, the international side. 
We have momentum. We had a great 
group of bipartisan Senators—Demo-
crats and Republicans from all over the 
country and from all political persua-
sions—showing that momentum. We 
have the Trump administration fully 
behind this. In many ways, some of 
their Federal agencies weighed in sig-
nificantly to help us design this legis-
lation, and now we need to get it over 
to the House and move it in the House 
soon and get it to the President’s desk. 
So this is a good day for the oceans 
and a good day for bipartisan success 
in the U.S. Senate on an issue that peo-
ple care about. People really care 
about making sure that we have clean 
oceans and we are making progress. 
So I just want to leave it at that, and 
I will ask my colleague from Rhode Is-
land, who has been the real leader on 
this issue, to wrap it up. 
Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I 
am delighted to close this out. Again, I 
thank Senator SULLIVAN. I think there 
is reason to hope for a really good ap-
propriations subcommittee hearing on 
this subject in the coming year. I think 
there is reason to hope for another En-
vironmental and Public Works Com-
mittee full committee hearing on ma-
rine plastics. I expect those things will 
happen, and that will help us with our 
progress. 
One of the things I have come to ad-
mire about Senator SULLIVAN is that, 
as a colonel in the U.S. Marines, he 
sets himself a mission and then he goes 
about it with real vigor. One of the 
missions that he set himself was to 
make sure that the Trump administra-
tion followed up on what Save Our Seas 
1.0 did. 
There were a lot of doors that were 
knocked on that had their hinges rat-
tled by Senator SULLIVAN. There are a 
lot of administration officials who 
probably had to hold the phone an inch 
or so away from their ears because 
Senator SULLIVAN was trying to get 
their attention on this subject. 
Having seen him in action on Save 
Our Seas 1.0, I very much look forward 
to watching him in action on Save Our 
Seas 2.0 and to make sure that its leg-
islative promise is fully realized in ex-
ecutive implementation. 
I yield the floor. 
Mr. SULLIVAN. Mr. President, I look 
forward to another White House sign-
ing of this with all of our colleagues. I 
am sure that the administration is in-
terested in it. You and I had a very 
eventful one over at the White House a 
couple years ago. 
So, again, the momentum is there. 
We are just going to keep building on 
it. 
Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, on 
to Save Our Seas 3.0. 
Mr. SULLIVAN. I yield the floor.

TRIBUTE TO CONRAD JEFFRIES 
Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, today I 
honor Idaho veteran Conrad Jeffries for 
his service to our nation and for his ef-
forts to address alarmingly high sui-
cide rates in our country, especially 
among our Nation’s veterans and serv-
icemembers. 
Conrad knows firsthand the personal 
costs of military service and the chal-
lenges servicemembers face returning 
to civilian life, and he has dedicated 
considerably of his time, talents, and 
resources to serving our country and 
helping his fellow veterans and mili-
tary families. On January 12, Conrad 
Jeffries embarked on a more-than 200 
mile run from Los Angeles to Las 
Vegas to raise awareness about rising 
suicide rates among veterans, Active- 
Duty servicemembers, and first re-
sponders. I understand his running 
route is intended to honor three sailors 
who committed suicide aboard the 
U.S.S. George H.W. Bush in September 
and promote the use of suicide screen-
ing forms to identify the root causes of 
and prevent veteran suicides. Conrad 
has said, ‘‘Veteran suicide is not the 
problem. Veteran suicide is the out-
come.’’ Conrad has admittedly faced 
his own personal struggles and has 
since dedicated his life to solving vet-
eran suicide. This includes working to 
help others who struggle with mental 
health and substance abuse. 
Conrad, who was raised in American 
Falls and lives in Boise, ID, served our 
Nation for 13 years in the Idaho Army 
National Guard and U.S. Coast Guard.

S160 
January 13, 2020 
His service included deployment with 
the 116th Combat Brigade and attach-
ment 
to 
Joint 
Special 
Operations 
where he conducted personal security 
detachment missions as a convoy com-
mander. In 2013, Conrad earned Idaho’s 
Non-Commissioned Officer of the Year 
Award. 
I commend Conrad Jeffries for his ex-
traordinary commitment to helping 
others through his actions to end sui-
cide. His candid sharing of his experi-
ences and empathy on the topic is in-
strumental as work continues to com-
bat veteran suicide. Suicide preven-
tion, specifically within the veteran 
community, has been one of my prior-
ities in Congress. I co-led in the intro-
duction of S. 1594, the Show Esteem 
and Respect for Veterans by Increasing 
Care and Equity, SERVICE, Act to ad-
dress the alarmingly high veteran sui-
cide rates by allowing veterans open 
access to mental healthcare at the U.S. 
Department of Veterans Affairs. I also 
joined a bipartisan group of Senate col-
leagues in asking the U.S. Department 
of Defense, DOD, to look for and ex-
plain any gaps in addressing the alarm-
ingly high rates of suicide in the Na-
tional Guard. 
Many well-intended people identify a 
problem, want to fix it, but get bogged 
down trying. Others, like Conrad, just 
face the obstacles, plow ahead, work 
hard, and literally ‘‘run’’ to fix it. I 
wish Conrad well and thank him for his 
efforts on behalf of his fellow veterans, 
military families, and all Americans to 
end veteran suicide. 
f 
DECOMMISSIONING OF THE USS 
‘‘PITTSBURGH’’ 
Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I rise 
today to honor and recognize the serv-
ice of the brave veterans and service-
members who have served on the USS 
Pittsburgh (SSN–720), one of 62 nuclear- 
powered, fast-attack, Los Angeles-class 
submarines that have formed the back-
bone of the U.S. Navy’s submarine 
force. This month the USS Pittsburgh 
(SSN–720) will complete the decommis-
sioning process in Bremerton, WA. 
The USS Pittsburgh first launched in 
1984 and was commissioned the fol-
lowing year. In its 35 years of exem-
plary service, the USS Pittsburgh (SSN– 
720) patrolled American waters, offered 
logistical support to servicemembers 
around the world, and took part in 
vital missions launching strikes into 
Iraq during Operation Desert Storm in 
1991 and in Operation Iraqi Freedom in 
2002. 
The USS Pittsburgh (SSN–720) com-
pleted its final Active-Duty patrol on 
February 25, 2019, when it arrived at its 
home port at New London, CT, Naval 
Base. From there, the USS Pittsburgh 
(SSN–720) made its final sea journey in 
a rare Arctic transit, to Naval Base 
Kitsap-Bremerton. It was the first and 
thus far only submarine of its class to 
make such a journey. 
The USS Pittsburgh (SSN–720) is the 
fourth U.S. Navy vessel named for the 
great city of Pittsburgh whose steel 
mills helped forge America’s industrial 
success and now serves as a center of 
medical innovation and scientific ad-
vancement. The USS Pittsburgh (SSN– 
720), like its namesake city, represents 
the best of American ingenuity, duty 
and excellence. I am proud to represent 
Pittsburgh and the Commonwealth of 
Pennsylvania in the U.S. Senate, and I 
thank the veterans and Active-Duty 
servicemembers 
who 
have 
served 
aboard the USS Pittsburgh (SSN–720) 
over the last four decades.

To the Congress of the United States: 
Pursuant to the International Emer-
gency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 
1701 et seq.) (IEEPA), I hereby report

(the ‘‘order’’) with respect to Iran that 
takes additional steps with respect to 
the national emergency declared in Ex-
ecutive Order 12957 of March 15, 1995. 
The order takes steps to deny Iran 
revenue, 
including 
revenue 
derived 
from the export of products from key 
sectors of Iran’s economy, that may be 
used to fund and support its nuclear 
program, 
missile 
development, 
ter-
rorism and terrorist proxy networks, 
and malign regional influence. 
The order blocks the property and in-
terests in property of persons deter-
mined by the Secretary of the Treas-
ury, in consultation with the Secretary 
of State: 
∑ to operate in the construction, 
mining, manufacturing, or textiles sec-
tors of the Iranian economy, or any 
other sector of the Iranian economy as 
may be determined by the Secretary of 
the Treasury, in consultation with the 
Secretary of State; 
∑ to have knowingly engaged, on or 
after the date of the order, in a signifi-
cant transaction for the sale, supply, 
or transfer to or from Iran of signifi-
cant goods or services used in connec-
tion with a sector of the Iranian econ-
omy specified in, or determined by the 
Secretary of the Treasury, in consulta-
tion with the Secretary of State, pur-
suant to, section 1(a)(i) of the order; 
∑ to have materially assisted, spon-
sored, or provided financial, material, 
or technological support for, or goods 
or services to or in support of, any per-
son whose property and interests in 
property are blocked pursuant to the 
order; or 
∑ to be owned or controlled by, or to 
have acted or purported to act for or on 
behalf of, directly or indirectly, any 
person whose property and interests in 
property are blocked pursuant to the 
order. 
The order also authorizes the Sec-
retary of the Treasury, in consultation 
with the Secretary of State, to impose 
correspondent account and payable- 
through account-related sanctions on a 
foreign financial institution upon de-
termining the foreign financial institu-
tion has, on or after the date of the 
order, knowingly conducted or facili-
tated a significant financial trans-
action: 
∑ for the sale, supply, or transfer to 
or from Iran of significant goods or 
services used in connection with a sec-
tor of the Iranian economy specified in, 
or determined by the Secretary of the 
Treasury, in consultation with the Sec-
retary of State, pursuant to, section 
1(a)(i) of the order; or 
∑ for or on behalf of any person 
whose property and interests in prop-
erty are blocked pursuant to section 1 
of the order. 
I have delegated to the Secretary of 
the Treasury, in consultation with the 
Secretary of State, the authority to 
take such actions, including adopting 
rules and regulations, to employ all 
powers granted to the President by 
IEEPA as may be necessary to imple-
ment the order. 
I am enclosing a copy of the order I 
have issued.

PERSONAL EXPLANATION 
HON. RON KIND 
OF WISCONSIN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, January 13, 2020 
Mr. KIND. Madam Speaker, I was unable to 
have my votes recorded on the House floor 
from January 6 through January 10, 2020 due 
to a family matter. 
Had I been present, I would have supported 
the final passage of all bills and resolutions 
considered on the floor. I strongly supported 
the passage of H.R. 535, the PFAS Action 
Act. PFAS pose a critical threat to human 
health, and I was proud my amendment, 
which would promote resources for private 
well water testing and treatment, was included 
in the bill. Wisconsinites deserve clean drink-
ing water, and I am proud the House of Rep-
resentatives is taking steps to address PFAS 
contamination across the country. 
I also strongly supported the passage of H. 
Con. Res. 83. This resolution sends a clear 
message to this Administration, our men and 
women in uniform, and all Americans: we will 
not go into another war without the President 
making the case to the American people and 
seeking approval from Congress.

CELEBRATING BETTER MADE’S 90 
YEARS 
OF 
BUSINESS—THE 
SNACK OF DETROIT 
HON. RASHIDA TLAIB 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, January 13, 2020 
Ms. TLAIB. Madam Speaker, I rise today in 
tribute to Better Made, a snack foods manu-
facturer based in Detroit, Michigan. 
Founded in 1930 by Sicilian immigrants 
Cross Moceri and Peter Cirpriano, Better 
Made produces a wide array of snack foods 
beloved throughout metropolitan Detroit and 
Michigan. Its founders set out to make a better 
potato chip, the genesis of the Better Made 
brand name. The company has grown from its 
humble beginnings, one of countless small 
manufacturers of potato chips that sprang up 
during the Great Depression. Better Made’s 
most popular product is still made from pota-
toes harvested primarily from Michigan, using 
upwards of fifty million pounds of potatoes an-
nually. 
Better Made, a true American success story, 
embodies Detroit’s spirit of tenacity. As a De-
troiter, growing up you did not think about a 
potato chip without thinking about Better Made 
chips. That remains true to this day. Better 
Made is a staple to many in Southeast Michi-
gan and those who are hundreds of miles 
away. It’s surely at the top of the list of items 
put in care packages sent from the Detroit 
area. 
Please join me in celebrating Better Made’s 
longevity. 
KOREAN AMERICAN DAY 2020 
HON. GRACE MENG 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, January 13, 2020 
Ms. MENG. Madam Speaker, as the rep-
resentative of Queens, where so many Korean 
Americans call home, I wish everyone a 
Happy Korean American Day. New York State 
has the second largest number of Korean 
Americans in the country. Every day in 
Queens, I see the vibrant influence of Korean 
Americans in my congressional district. 
Over 117 years ago, Koreans arrived on our 
U.S. shores. Since then, Korean Americans 
have enriched every facet of American history, 
culture, and cuisine. Whether in the entertain-
ment industry or academia; whether in medi-
cine or public service—Korean Americans 
have made and continue to make immeas-
urable contributions to this nation. 
In fact, over 70 years ago, a Korean Amer-
ican became the first Asian American to win 
an Olympic gold medal, and later became the 
first American to win back-to-back Olympic 
gold medals in platform diving. Since the 
116th Congress, we have the first Korean 
American Democratic Member of Congress. 
We also now have the first Korean American 
NASA astronaut. And in January 2019, I was 
proud that Jin Park, the first Dreamer Rhodes 
Scholar and one of my constituents, joined me 
as my guest at the State of the Union Ad-
dress. 
Fighting for issues that matter to Korean 
Americans is a personal one. After all, half of 
my family are Korean American; my two boys 
are half-Korean American. Even as we cele-
brate the admirable history, contributions, and 
of course the incredible foods of Korean 
Americans, we cannot ignore the critical 
issues like human rights, immigration, health 
care, and education, which impact Korean 
Americans. 
On human rights, I introduced the H.R. 
1771, the Divided Families Reunification Act, 
which would require the U.S. Secretary of 
State and the U.S. Special Envoy on North 
Korea Human Rights Issues to prioritize help-
ing Korean American families reunite with fam-
ily members in North Korea. The Korean War 
was a heart wrenching event that not only split 
the peninsula in two, it tore families apart. I 
am thrilled this bill passed out of the House 
Foreign Affairs Committee in October 2019, 
and it is now awaiting consideration before the 
full House of Representatives. 
On immigration, Koreans make up the high-
est number of Dreamers from non-Latin Amer-
ican countries. I am fighting for a path to citi-
zenship for those individuals, including Korean 
Dreamers, who have known this country as 
their only home. In June 2019, I was proud to 
cosponsor and vote for the House passage of 
H.R. 6—the American Dream and Promise Act 
of 2019, which would finally provide a pathway 
to citizenship for Dreamers like Jin Park. 
I am also proud to cosponsor the Adoptee 
Citizenship Act of 2019, which would close the 
loophole in the 2000 Child Citizenship Act. 
Today, there are 35,000 adult international 
adoptees who are in the U.S. without citizen-
ship and are at risk of deportation. This in-
cludes thousands of Korean adoptees who are 
undocumented in New York. 
On health, while Asian Americans only 
make up 6 percent of the U.S. population, our 
community makes up more than 50 percent of 
hepatitis B virus cases in the nation. This is a 
tragedy. That is why, as Co-Chair of the Con-
gressional Hepatitis Caucus, I secured almost 
$40 million in federal funds for the CDC’s Divi-
sion of Viral Hepatitis to eliminate this deadly 
disease. 
On education, over 40 percent of Asian 
Americans are in community colleges. That is 
why I introduced the Community College Stu-
dent Success Act which would improve grad-
uation rates at under-resourced public commu-
nity colleges with high percentages of low-in-
come and minority students. And in the most 
recent federal funding bill that was signed into 
law, I secured nearly $4.5 million grant funding 
for institutions that have a significant number 
of Asian American students. After all, every-
one deserves their best chance at a quality 
education, no matter their background. 
Madam Speaker, on these and so many 
other important issues, it is important to recog-
nize and continue the fight. I am excited to 
celebrate Korean American Day with all the 
Korean Americans in Queens, and across our 
nation.

IN RECOGNITION OF THE HEROIC 
ACTIONS 
OF 
ESTANISLADO 
‘‘TONY’’ CASTRO III 
HON. BRYAN STEIL 
OF WISCONSIN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, January 13, 2020 
Mr. STEIL. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
recognize Tony Castro of Mukwonago, Wis-
consin for his heroic actions. 
While Tony and his wife were driving in 
Mukwonago on December 26, 2019, Tony no-
ticed that there was an unattended bicycle on 
the corner. He then immediately noticed two 
children screaming for help in the middle of an 
icy pond. 
Tony jumped out of the car and ran to the 
edge of the water. He began to calm the chil-
dren down. 911 was called and Tony let the 
children know that help was on the way. The 
children were struggling in the icy water and 
Tony continued to coach them through how to 
stay above water. 
While his wife, Danielle, ran back to their 
house to grab a rope, Tony stayed with the 
children. When Danielle returned, she saw 
that Tony and a Mukwonago police officer had 
jumped into the pond to rescue the children. 
Tony was in water up to his neck and was 
warning the police officer that the bottom of 
the pond was slick with a steep drop off. 
Danielle had found an extension cord at their

house and threw it to Tony. He tied the cord 
around the police officer. Tony held the exten-
sion cord tightly while the police officer at-
tempted to break through the ice to save the 
children. 
Mukwonago Fire and Rescue arrived while 
Tony and the police officer were in the icy 
pond. The Fire and Rescue members began 
throwing additional rope to Tony, the police of-
ficer, and the children. The members of the 
rescue unit pulled everyone to shore. During 
this whole situation, Tony was in the icy water 
for over five minutes trying to reach the chil-
dren. He showed bravery and risked his life to 
save the children. 
Tony’s quick thinking and selflessness led to 
the two children being saved. He is a hero. 
On behalf of Wisconsin’s First Congres-
sional District, I thank Tony for his heroic ac-
tions. When faced with a decision to risk his 
life and save these children, Tony did not think 
twice.

REMEMBERING JEANNE SULLIVAN 
HON. HALEY M. STEVENS 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, January 13, 2020 
Ms. STEVENS. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today in memory of Jeanne Sullivan, who 
passed away on November 24th after a coura-
geous two-year battle with cancer. 
Jeanne was born in China and spent most 
of her childhood in Brazil and Montreal, Can-
ada, before immigrating to the United States 
with her parents. She graduated from Boston 
University with a degree in Comparative Reli-
gion and spoke five languages fluently. 
In her free time, Jeanne read thousands of 
books and was an accomplished artist. Her 
home was filled with art, as well as projects 
for her church, community, and grandchildren. 
Loving wife, mother to her three children, Ta-
mara, Pandi and Nick, and dedicated grand-
mother, she brought a sense of imagination 
and profound love to everyone she touched. 
Jeanne lived her life helping others and car-
ing for the community around her. Even in her 
final days, she was thinking of others, and told 
her children that her greatest purpose in life 
was bringing joy to all people. Jeanne will al-
ways be remembered for her knowledge, spir-
it, and commitment to her community—all of 
which she passed down to her children.

THANKING FRAZIER PAYNE FOR 
SEVENTEEN YEARS OF SERVICE 
TO ALABAMA’S FIRST CONGRES-
SIONAL DISTRICT 
HON. BRADLEY BYRNE 
OF ALABAMA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, January 13, 2020 
Mr. BYRNE. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
share my deepest appreciation for my Deputy 
District Director, Frazier Payne, for his 17 
years of service to Alabama’s First Congres-
sional District. Today marks Frazier’s final day 
serving the people of Southwest Alabama. 
After graduating from the University of Ala-
bama, Frazier jumped headfirst into politics 
working for the successful campaign of my 
predecessor representing Alabama’s First Dis-
trict, Jo Bonner. Frazier faithfully served Con-
gressman Bonner during his entire tenure in 
office, and I and the people of Southwest Ala-
bama were very fortunate when Frazier 
agreed to join my staff as well. 
As Deputy District Director, Frazier has 
been invaluable as my representative in com-
munities throughout our district. Few people 
know Southwest Alabama better than Frazier. 
He is well-known by constituents, local leaders 
and elected officials. More importantly, he has 
their trust. And they know he has mine too. 
People are drawn to Frazier not only be-
cause of his likability but because he is trust-
worthy. His reputation for integrity and as 
someone who can be relied upon has been so 
valuable to me and my staff. He has always 
had my full trust, and I have been better able 
to serve my constituents because of his wise 
counsel. 
Next week Frazier will begin his next chap-
ter as Regional External Affairs Liaison with 
the Alabama Community College System, cov-
ering southwest Alabama and its three com-
munity colleges. I am so pleased he will re-
main in Mobile, and I am confident he will con-
tinue as an engaged leader in our community. 
I thank his wife Lesley and children Lula 
and Corrine for allowing their husband and fa-
ther to serve the people of the First District for 
17 years. We’ve scored so many significant 
victories for Southwest Alabama during this 
time, and we are all better for his service. 
On behalf of Alabama’s First Congressional 
District, I congratulate Frazier for beginning an 
exciting new opportunity and thank him for his 
years of hard work, commitment, and service 
to Southwest Alabama.

recognize the exemplary service and career of 
Sergeant Major Sergio MartinezRuiz, who will 
retire from the Marine Corps on January 10, 
2020 after a twenty-seven-year career serving

ployed numerous times in support of Joint 
Task Force (JTF)–6’s counter drug operations. 
Sergeant Major Martinez has served as a Drill 
Instructor and Senior Drill Instructor, as well 
as an Assistant Marine Officer Instructor and 
Marine Officer Instructor. Over the course of 
his impressive career, Sergeant Major Mar-
tinez has deployed twice to Iraq in support of 
Operation Iraqi Freedom and once to Afghani-
stan in support of Operation Enduring Free-

Star Medal. 
On behalf of the U.S. House of Representa-

I

Sergeant 
Major 
Sergio 
MartinezRuiz my sincere congratulations on 
his retirement. As a retired Marine myself, I

RECOGNIZING THE OPENING OF 
THE FRIENDSHIP CAFE´  
HON. THEODORE E. DEUTCH 
OF FLORIDA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, January 13, 2020 
Mr. DEUTCH. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to honor the Friendship Cafe´, a restaurant cre-
ated by the nonprofit The Friendship Circle of 
Fort Lauderdale. This cafe´ uplifts adults with 
developmental and intellectual disabilities by 
providing them with jobs and employment 
training in the food service, hospitality and 
customer service industry. 
According to the Department of Labor 80 
percent of adults with disabilities do not enter 
the workforce due to various barriers to em-
ployment. The Friendship Cafe´ aims to lower 
that percentage by fulfilling a vital role in Fort 
Lauderdale as a safe, secure, and educational 
environment where adults with disabilities can 
earn a living wage. 
The cafe´ will serve a Mediterranean inspired 
menu curated by world renowned Israeli chef 
Yoram Getter. Bill Fienberg, the President of 
Allied Kitchen and Bath, donated his firm’s 
labor and materials to build the cafe´, Inter-
national decorator Perla Lichi of Perla Lichi 
Designs helped the cafe´ complete their image 
with a French inspired interior design. Due to 
the leadership at the Las Olas Chabad Jewish 
Center and their support and partnership with 
the Friendship Circle adults with disabilities in 
Fort Lauderdale are now provided with re-
sources to help them succeed in finding em-
ployment. 
Please join me in congratulating the Friend-
ship Circle and their community partners on 
the opening of the Friendship Cafe´.

IN RECOGNITION OF MS. KATHRYN 
LANGE 
HON. ROBERT J. WITTMAN 
OF VIRGINIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, January 13, 2020 
Mr. WITTMAN. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today in recognition of the exceptional service 
of Ms. Kathy Lange, who served as the Con-
gressional Liaison and Patient Advocate at the 
Hunter Holmes McGuire VA Medical Center in 
Richmond, Virginia. 
Kathy began her Federal service career in 
1999 with the DEA and has since put in over 
21 years of dedicated service. From 2009 to 
2015 she served as the Director’s secretary at 
the Richmond VA Medical Center, playing an 
invaluable role within the support team. She 
then progressed to become a Congressional 
Liaison/Patient Advocate in 2015 where she 
has served until her retirement this year. 
Kathy’s exceptional service to Virginia vet-
erans is unmatched in her compassion and 
dedication. In her years as a Congressional Li-
aison, she assisted the Virginia Congressional 
Delegation’s staff with veteran’s casework 
needs, highlighting her passion to provide ex-
cellent service. She often goes above and be-
yond to ensure the needs of veterans and 
staff are met. She will certainly be missed in 
her retirement. 
Therefore, Madam Speaker, I ask you to

RECOGNIZING NATIONAL LEAGUE 
OF CITIES’ LESBIAN, GAY, BI-
SEXUAL, TRANSGENDER LOCAL 
OFFICIALS 
CONSTITUENCY 
GROUP 
HON. THEODORE E. DEUTCH 
OF FLORIDA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, January 13, 2020 
Mr. DEUTCH. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to honor the National League of Cities’ 
(NLC’s) Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender 
Local Officials (LGBTLO) constituency group 
for their continuing service furthering the rights 
of the LGBTQ community. The LGBTLO con-
stituency group advocates for the inclusion 
and full participation of LGBTQ municipal offi-
cials, and supporters, in the National League 
of Cities. 
Established in December 1993 by a group 
of municipal officials attending the Congress of 
Cities in Orlando, Florida, LGBTLO became a 
constituency group of NLC under the leader-
ship of Councilmember Sherry Harris from Se-
attle, Washington. The members of NLC 
LGBTLO work to encourage equality, inclu-
siveness and non-discrimination, and have fo-
cused on several issues including: the Cen-
sus, the HIV/ AIDS pandemic, both as a public 
health and a health care funding issue; do-
mestic partnership policies and legislation; and 
discrimination on the basis of sexual orienta-
tion and gender identity. 
I ask that my colleagues join me today in 
congratulating the current LGBTLO leadership: 
Vice Mayor Tom Green (Wilton Manors, FL), 
Mayor 
Jeffrey 
Slavin 
(Somerset, 
MD), 
Councilmember 
Victor 
Aguilar, 
Jr. 
(San 
Leandro, CA), Commissioner Andy Amoroso 
(Lake Worth, FL), Councilmember Chris Clark 
(Mountain View, CA), Commissioner Tim 
Lonergan (Oakland Park, FL, Councilmember 
Ty 
Stober 
(Vancouver, 
WA) 
and 
Councilmember Nancy VanReece (Nashville, 
TN) for their hard work and dedication to pro-
moting equality for all and ensuring the voice 
of the LGBTQ community is included in munic-
ipal discussions. 
HONORING THE USS 
‘‘PITTSBURGH’’ 
HON. CONOR LAMB 
OF PENNSYLVANIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, January 13, 2020 
Mr. LAMB. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
recognize the USS ‘‘Pittsburgh’’ on its decom-
missioning on January 17, 2020. 
The USS Pittsburgh, a Los Angeles-class 
fast-attack submarine, was launched on De-
cember 8, 1984 and commissioned on No-
vember 23, 1985. This submarine is the fourth 
ship to receive the name USS Pittsburgh and 
has long had a special relationship with the 
city through the Navy League Pittsburgh 
Council, the Submarine Veterans Association 
of Pittsburgh, and the Pittsburgh Relief Crew. 
The USS Pittsburgh conducted submarine- 
launched Tomahawk missile attacks during 
both Operation Desert Storm and Operation 
Iraqi Freedom and completed many other mis-
sions vital to national security. In November 
2017, the USS Pittsburgh completed its 
1,000th dive, an achievement few boats carry. 
The USS Pittsburgh carries the fitting motto 
‘‘Heart of Steel’’, which reminds me of the de-
termination and passion of all Pittsburghers. 
Please join me in honoring the USS Pittsburgh 
for its nearly 35 years of service protecting 
U.S. interests around the world and all the re-
markable crewmembers who have served 
aboard it during that time.

INTRODUCTION 
OF 
THE 
WEIGH 
HABITATS 
OFFSETTING 
LOCA-
TIONAL EFFECTS ACT OF 2020 
HON. DAN NEWHOUSE 
OF WASHINGTON 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, January 13, 2020 
Mr. NEWHOUSE. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to introduce the Weigh Habitats Offset-
ting Locational Effects Act of 2020, or the 
WHOLE Act. As Central Washingtonians know 
all-too-well, Endangered Species Act (ESA) 
listing and delisting decisions have huge, last-
ing impacts on local communities and environ-
ments. The ESA was signed into law to pro-
tect and revitalize species of endangered or 
threatened animals and wildlife, but as time 
passes, this law, which has not been updated 
since 1973, has had increased negative ef-
fects on local communities—where the true 
impacts of species recovery unfold. 
Unfortunately, the law has been used as a 
political spearhead for frivolous litigation that 
can negatively affect private property rights, 
public land use decisions, and American jobs. 
And like many other regulations coming out of 
the nation’s capital, relying on top-down deci-
sions from bureaucrats only limits economic 
prosperity, local conservation efforts, and the 
celebration of recovered species. 
Under current law, only conservation efforts 
taking place within the critical habitats of en-
dangered or threatened species are consid-
ered during environmental reviews or impact 
studies of federal actions. But we know that 
habitats and ecosystems expand beyond arbi-
trary government-drawn lines. 
My legislation would ensure that all con-
servation measures are considered when fed-
eral decisions that impact ESA-listed species

are being made. By establishing a process 
that considers the totality of conservation ef-
forts, we incentivize private investment in spe-
cies recovery, streamline federal decision- 
making, and promote the comprehensive ef-
forts of states, local communities, and tribes. 
Efforts to strengthen the ESA are—and 
have been—ongoing. This legislation is part of 
a larger legislative package of 18 bills intro-
duced by Members of the Congressional 
Western Caucus, a group of 75 representa-
tives who focus on addressing issues impact-
ing local communities in the rural West and 
beyond, including strengthening and modern-
izing the ESA. As a Western Caucus Member, 
I am proud to work with my colleagues to ad-
vance priorities like this for Central Wash-
ington. The package also includes efforts I 
have supported in the past, such as ensuring 
the best available science is used to make 
ESA listing decisions and providing more 
transparency by making this data publicly 
available. 
By bringing the ESA into the 21st Century, 
the Western Caucus aims to create a more 
comprehensive, streamlined approach to spe-
cies recovery, while ensuring our communities 
are not burdened by overregulation and mis-
leading data. We should not tie our hands 
when it comes to species recovery. Using the 
best available science, considering all ongoing 
conservation measures, streamlining the proc-
ess for listing decisions, and empowering state 
and local efforts will create a comprehensive 
approach to advance species recovery and 
fulfill the true intent of the ESA. 
The ESA was created to protect and re-
cover endangered and threatened species. 
We must remain committed to this shared goal 
by strengthening and modernizing the Endan-
gered Species Act for future generations. The 
WHOLE Act and these legislative efforts put 
forward by the Western Caucus are a strong 
step forward, so I humbly ask my colleagues 
to join me in supporting the WHOLE Act of 
2020.

CELEBRATING 
MARGARET 
PHIL-
LIPS 
MOORE 
MCCLANAHAN’S 
100TH BIRTHDAY 
HON. VIRGINIA FOXX 
OF NORTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, January 13, 2020 
Ms. FOXX of North Carolina. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to recognize and cele-
brate the 100th birthday of Margaret Phillips 
Moore McClanahan of King, North Carolina. 
Margaret was born in Louisville, Kentucky, on 
January 16, 1920. 
Margaret is a graduate of King High School 
and the Women’s College of the University of 
North Carolina—now the University of North 
Carolina at Greensboro. After graduation, she 
went on to complete a dietetic internship at 
the Duke University Medical Center and then 
served as an industrial dietitian at Western 
Electric for 33 years. From age 65 until her 
80’s, she was heavily involved in public health 
in Stokes County. 
A woman who is invested in her community, 
family, and faith, Margaret has made a pro-
found impact on western North Carolina. She 
was a founding member of the King Outreach 
Mission in the mid 1970’s and was a founder 
of the Stokes County Habitat for Humanity in 
1999. Since the founding of the King Outreach 
Mission, she’s served as a weekly volunteer, 
board member, newsletter writer and editor, 
and organizer of a fundraising rummage sale 
which eventually led to establishment of a 
thrift shop. 
As an active member of her church, Mar-
garet plays the piano for the Special Ministries 
program and previously served as the church 
historian. For years, she directed the prepara-
tion of Wednesday night suppers for church 
members who attended weekly groups. But 
her activities don’t stop there. She also com-
peted in Seniors Games and has gone in to 
win medals at the regional, state, and national 
levels in swimming. 
To her family, Margaret is the quiet, wise 
matriarch, and continuously showers love, 
pride, and wise counsel to her three children, 
two 
grandchildren, 
and 
three 
greatgranddaughters. Her compassion, mod-
esty, and faith make her a remarkable role 
model. I wish Ms. Margaret Phillips Moore 
McClanahan a very happy—and blessed— 
100th birthday.

HONORING CARY JONES’ 44 YEARS 
OF PUBLIC SERVICE 
HON. KURT SCHRADER 
OF OREGON 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, January 13, 2020 
Mr. SCHRADER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize and honor the career of 
Cary Jones of Oregon for his 44 years of pub-
lic service to our nation and our Veterans as 
he retires on January 31, 2020 from the De-
partment of Veterans’ Affairs. 
Cary began his service to our nation when 
he enlisted in the United States Coast Guard 
and served honorably for twenty-six years be-
fore retiring as a Senior Chief Yeoman. On 
July 1, 2001, Cary started working with VA 
Portland Health Care System as Personal 
Support Assistant in the Public Affairs, Re-
lease of Information and Patient Advocates, 
Release offices. It was during this time that 
Cary began working with members of the Or-
egon delegation and responding to congres-
sional inquiries. 
During my time in Congress, Cary has al-
ways been the point of contact for my office. 
He was responsible for helping the countless 
veterans who reached out to my office for as-
sistance, often out of pure desperation, to get 
a response to grievances with their care. I will 
always be grateful for Cary’s approach to the 
job. His professionalism and dedication to our 
men and women in uniform showed in the way 
he treated every inquiry with the utmost ur-
gency they deserved to ensure our veterans 
concerns were addressed. 
The VA Portland Health Care System, our 
Veterans, and the Congressional delegations 
of Oregon and Washington will be losing an 
institution on January 31st when Cary officially 
retires. I would like to once again thank Cary 
and wish him and his wife Linda a well-de-
served retirement after forty-four years of dedi-
cated federal service. I hope he can finally 
enjoy some much-earned time in his work-
shop.
