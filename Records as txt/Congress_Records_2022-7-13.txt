PRAYER 
The Chaplain, the Reverend Margaret 
Grun Kibben, offered the following 
prayer: 
Almighty God, You bless the people 
who patiently endure hardship and 
testing. And so we bring before You our 
prayers for the people of Ukraine who, 
in these last months, have endured in-
describable adversity and have been 
tested time and again. Yet, they have 
held fast to their faith in You and con-
fident in Your deliverance from un-
speakable horrors. 
You see the atrocities inflicted upon 
Ukraine, O God. You know the torture 
the Ukrainians endure day after day at 
the ruthless hands of their enemy. 
They wait patiently for Your interces-
sion. Where, then, is Your blessing? 
O Lord, You have promised those who 
love You the crown of life. Give to the 
people of Ukraine, who have remained 
unwavering in their hope in You, who 
have embodied Your compassion in 
tending to the overwhelming suffering 
around them despite the risk to their 
own lives, give them evidence of the 
abundant life You have prepared for 
them. 
Defend them with the strength of 
Your mighty arm. Crown them with 
righteousness, for in facing the wicked-
ness that encroaches on them, they 
have remained steadfast in their devo-
tion to You. 
May they serve as a testimony to 
Your faithfulness and a witness to 
Your abiding presence. And may we 
prove worthy to endure the testing and 
hardship that befalls us when we are 
called to take our stand against tyr-
anny and oppression. 
All this we pray in Your sovereign 
name. 
Amen. 
f 
THE JOURNAL 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to section 11(a) of House Resolu-
tion 188, the Journal of the last day’s

f 
PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Will the 
gentleman from Utah (Mr. STEWART) 
come forward and lead the House in the 
Pledge of Allegiance. 
Mr. STEWART led the Pledge of Alle-
giance as follows: 
I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the 
United States of America, and to the Repub-
lic for which it stands, one nation under God, 
indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. 
f 
ANNOUNCEMENT BY THE SPEAKER 
PRO TEMPORE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair will entertain up to 15 requests 
for 1-minute speeches on each side of 
the aisle. 
f 
LET TEACHERS TEACH 
(Mr. GREEN of Texas asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
his remarks.) 
Mr. GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, 
and still I rise with a message for those 
it may concern. 
At Robb Elementary School, more 
than 15 good guys with guns, ballistic 
shields, and body armor confronted a 
bad guy with a gun and didn’t do what 
many expect teachers to do with a pis-
tol. 
Expecting teachers to take out bad 
guys with guns is unreasonable, out-
rageous, and dumb. Let teachers teach. 
f 
RETURN TO FISCAL 
RESPONSIBILITY 
(Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania asked 
and was given permission to address 
the House for 1 minute and to revise 
and extend his remarks.) 
Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania. Mr. 
Speaker, last week, I received a letter 
from a Boy Scout in my district telling 
me how his family has been forced to 
change their budget and cancel their 
summer vacation. 
Unfortunately, 
this 
story 
is 
not 
unique, and right now, more than two- 
thirds of Americans have been forced 
to dip into their savings to pay for gro-
ceries and gasoline. This is the reality 
of an economy that has been wrecked 
by Biden’s socialist spending spree. 
These policies have consequences, 
and it is estimated that American fam-
ilies will spend an additional $460 a 
month because of inflation. Just this 
morning, it was reported that inflation 
rose by 9.1 percent in the past year. 
Let’s call this 9 percent inflation 
what it is. It is a tax on workers and 
families, and it is having a severe im-
pact on my community. It is time to 
stop spending money that we don’t 
have on policies that we don’t need. It 
is time to return to fiscal responsi-
bility.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5980 
July 13, 2022 
Mr. 
CARTER 
of 
Louisiana. 
Mr. 
Speaker, wars were fought, movements 
were launched, constitutional amend-
ments were passed to give every Amer-
ican of every race and gender full citi-
zenship and the right to vote. 
But last month, the Supreme Court 
released a shadow docket ruling rein-
stating Louisiana’s GOP-drawn, unrep-
resentative congressional maps. This 
sends Louisiana back to a tarnished 
history of diminishing the votes and 
voices of African Americans. 
It is shameful that the Court refused 
maps that fairly represent the popu-
lation of Louisiana. We need maps that 
follow the simple math and give Black 
Louisianians their rightful representa-
tion per current population. 
The Supreme Court is out of control 
in so many ways, but this and other 
most recent rulings make it clear that 
this Supreme Court will stop at noth-
ing to silence the voices of Black and 
Brown Americans. This ruling shows 
that many of these Justices are com-
mitted not to the Constitution but to 
the far-right political agenda that in-
cludes further attacking of the Voting 
Rights Act. 
Together we must fight against the 
age-old pattern of silencing Black vot-
ers. While the forces of injustice may 
have won the battle, we will win the 
war. 
f 
HONORING THE LIFE AND SERVICE 
OF HERSHEL ‘‘WOODY’’ WILLIAMS 
(Mr. MCCARTHY asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Mr. MCCARTHY. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to honor a great American hero. 
Ronald Reagan once said: ‘‘Some peo-
ple wonder all their lives if they made 
a difference. The Marines don’t have 
that problem.’’ 
This is especially true of Hershel 
‘‘Woody’’ Williams, who will be lying in 
honor in the Capitol tomorrow. Until 
his death on June 29, Williams was the 
sole surviving marine from World War 
II to wear the Medal of Honor. 
Then-Corporal Williams was a 21- 
year-old marine when his unit landed 
on Iwo Jima in February 1945. He was 
thrown into bloody combat almost im-
mediately. Japanese forces were dug 
into a network of reinforced pillboxes, 
and American forces were pinned down 
by heavy machine gun fire. 
Williams could see his fellow marines 
needed help, so he grabbed a flame-
thrower 
and 
charged 
towards 
the 
enemy stronghold alone. 
Can you believe he was just 21 years 
old when he did that? As his Medal of 
Honor citation says: ‘‘Covered only by 
four riflemen, he fought desperately for 
4 hours under terrific enemy small- 
arms fire and repeatedly returned to 
his own lines to prepare demolition 
charges and obtain serviced flame-
throwers, struggling back, frequently 
to the rear of hostile emplacements, to 
wipe out one position after another.’’ 
Williams’ actions, his citation con-
cludes, displayed ‘‘valiant devotion to 
duty’’ and enabled ‘‘his company to 
reach its objective.’’ 
Williams saw the American flag 
raised on Mount Suribachi that same 
day. 
Williams was honorably discharged 9 
months later, but he reenlisted in the 
Reserves twice. By the time he retired 
from the Corps in 1969, he had served 20 
years and risen to the rank of chief 
warrant officer 4. 
Yet, Williams still felt the call to 
service after he retired. So, among 
other things, he started the Woody Wil-
liams Foundation. Williams and his 
foundation helped establish 104 Gold 
Star Families Memorial Monuments 
across America to date, and right now 
more than 69 more monuments are un-
derway in 50 States. 
Woody Williams went above and be-
yond the call of duty on the battlefield 
and back home, and by lying in honor 
in the rotunda tomorrow, Williams 
continues to serve our veterans. 
Some people don’t know this, but 
Williams said one of his last wishes was 
to lie in honor in the Capitol, but it 
wasn’t for himself. No, it was for every 
Medal of Honor recipient who served in 
World War II. What a hero. 
Our veterans fought together as a 
team. They sacrificed as a team. And 
now, thanks in part to Woody Wil-
liams, we will honor them as a team. 
One last wish, one final act of serv-
ice. That was Woody Williams. Selfless 
to the end. 
As long as there are Americans like 
Williams and all the Medal of Honor re-
cipients we honor this week, this will 
always be the land of the free and the 
home of the brave. 
f 
WE MUST REMAIN ALERT 
(Mr. ESPAILLAT asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Mr. ESPAILLAT. Mr. Speaker, the 
January 6 Committee has interviewed 
more than a thousand people and gath-
ered more than 140,000 documents. 
Yesterday, the committee revealed 
how the former White House counsel 
agreed that there was no evidence of 
widespread election fraud. At hearing 
after hearing, the committee has prov-
en that Trump’s big lie led to a violent 
insurrection that attempted to end our 
democracy. 
I introduced two resolutions calling 
for the prosecution of insurrectionists 
and condemning the Proud Boys’ acts 
of terror. Now, more than 800 insurrec-
tionists have been arrested, and the 
leader of the Proud Boys has been 
charged with seditious conspiracy. 
Efforts to undermine our democracy 
are not over. We must remain alert and 
protect people’s right to vote. 
f 
SAFEGUARDING THE SAVINGS OF 
RETIREES 
(Ms. FOXX asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, the left’s 
woke agenda is putting the retirement 
savings of many Americans at risk. 
The Biden administration’s proposed 
rule would require retirement plan 
managers to consider environmental, 
social, and governance factors when 
making investment decisions for work-
ers and retirees. These factors can in-
clude a company’s carbon footprint, 
hiring practices, and whether it is 
unionized. 
ESG factors are subjective and arbi-
trary, making them a perfect weapon 
for the left. Forcing ESG standards on 
retirement accounts is a clear viola-
tion of the Employee Retirement In-
come Security Act, which requires fi-
duciaries to put the financial interests 
of plan participants first. 
ESG requirements pressure investors 
to subject retirement savings to low- 
yield investments. This is irrespon-
sible. We should be doing all that we 
can to safeguard the savings of retirees 
instead of putting them at risk to sat-
isfy the woke mob. 
f 
VULNERABLE WOMEN WILL BE 
HURT MOST 
(Ms. GARCIA of Texas asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
her remarks.) 
Ms. GARCIA of Texas. Madam Speak-
er, I rise in outrage that extreme Re-
publicans seek to control women and 
their most intimate healthcare deci-
sions by banning abortions. These cruel 
efforts will hurt the already vulnerable 
women in our communities the most, 
especially poor women. 
Madam Speaker, there are more than 
800,000 women of reproductive age with 
incomes under 100 percent of poverty 
who live in States that haven’t ex-
panded Medicaid. 
These women are being left without 
access to comprehensive healthcare 
coverage, and now many are being 
stripped of their abortion rights. These 
women are less likely to access birth 
control, 
will 
struggle 
to 
receive 
wellness exams, and now will not have 
access to abortion. 
This is the vision Republicans have 
for America. This is what the right-
wing wants. Well, I won’t stand by 
quietly, and Democrats will not stand 
by quietly. I plan to fight for women 
because I trust women to make their 
most personal, intimate healthcare de-
cisions.

OF 
HARRISONBURG-

(Mr. CLINE asked and was given per-

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5981 
July 13, 2022 
for winning the 2022 Quality Award at 
their national conference. 
Big Brothers Big Sisters aims to con-
nect mentors, or ‘‘bigs,’’ with local 
youth, known as ‘‘littles.’’ 
This prestigious Quality Award is 
granted to only a third of chapters in 
the country. To achieve it, the chapter 
must succeed in having 73 percent of 
mentors meet with a youth member for 
a whole year. Additionally, 54 percent 
of participants must meet with their 
‘‘littles’’ at school for that year. 
The Harrisburg-Rockingham chapter 
knocked that standard out of the park, 
reporting a 70 to 80 percent meeting 
success rate. 
According to Lindsay Douglas, the 
executive director of the Harrisonburg- 
Rockingham chapter, the reason for 
the chapter’s superb performance is 
strong communication between the 
mentors, children, and their parents. 
It is community organizations like 
Big Brothers Big Sisters that foster an 
environment where our youth can 
thrive. 
Congratulations, again, to the Har-
risburg-Rockingham chapter. 
f 
UPHOLDING OUR END OF THE 
PACT WITH VETERANS 
(Ms. UNDERWOOD asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
her remarks.) 
Ms. UNDERWOOD. Madam Speaker, 
this week, we are making history as we 
pass the Honoring Our PACT Act and 
move one step closer to sending the 
legislation to President Biden’s desk to 
be signed into law. 
The journey to this point has been 
long. As a member of the House Vet-
erans’ Affairs Committee, I was proud 
to be an original cosponsor of the 
PACT Act when we introduced it over 
a year ago. 
Now, we are finally at the finish line, 
ready to expand healthcare to 3.5 mil-
lion veterans exposed to toxic sub-
stances during their service. 
We are upholding our end of the pact 
we made with our veterans to ensure 
they have the care they need and de-
serve when they come home. 
I am grateful to the veterans and 
military families in my community 
who have made their voices heard on 
this urgent cause, and I am thankful 
for the tireless advocacy of the VSOs 
across the country who have made this 
moment possible. 
f 
PAYING TRIBUTE TO EDWARD C. 
MAHEN 
(Mr. STEWART asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. STEWART. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to pay tribute to a truly 
great American, Mr. Edward C. Mahen, 
who unfortunately died last fall. This 
was an amazing man, and he will be 
missed. 
Mr. Mahen was a dedicated civil serv-
ant, an Air Force combat veteran, and 
an extraordinary engineer with more 
than 50 years of service to our country. 
In 1972, Ed joined the Air Force. In 
Vietnam, he earned two Distinguished 
Flying Crosses and eleven Air Medals 
flying 144 combat missions. He retired 
as a colonel in 1997 after a career of as-
signments in classified strategic and 
electronic warfare programs. 
In 1998, Ed was recruited by the di-
rector of the NRO to become the chief 
technology officer for the Advanced 
Systems and Technology Directorate. 
He was a remarkable leader. He left a 
legacy within the IC by hiring and 
guiding a new generation of IC profes-
sionals. 
May he rest in peace. May his wife 
and family be comforted knowing he 
was a true patriot, a true friend, and 
one who endlessly loved his family and 
this country. 
f 
HONORING JUAN CARLOS 
REYNAGA 
(Mr. CORREA asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. 
CORREA. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
today, I rise to honor and celebrate the 
life of my constituent, Juan Carlos 
Reynaga. 
Juan was 17 years old; he was a line-
man for Anaheim High School varsity 
football team, and he was keeping his 
grades up. He wanted to become a cer-
tified crane operator after graduating 
from high school. 
Sadly, last Friday, after working his 
late-night shift at Walmart, when he 
was walking home, a car drove up; two 
individuals in the car asked him: Are 
you a gangbanger? And he said: No, I 
am not a gang member. They shot him 
in the back, anyway, killing him. 
Juan was a hardworking, honest 
young man. He was looking for the 
American Dream and working hard to 
achieve the American Dream. Sadly, 
his life was taken from him by 
gangbangers. 
My heart goes out to his family. As 
the father of four, I can’t imagine the 
pain and the grief of losing your child 
to a senseless gang shooting. 
Juan, thank you for giving us so 
much in your very short life. 
Go Colonists.

REMEMBERING VINCENT BECHARD 
AND 
PRAYING 
FOR 
PETER 
KREINER 
(Mrs. MCCLAIN asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mrs. MCCLAIN. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today with a heavy heart. On July 
8, there was a terrible car crash in 
Sherman Township in my district that 
involved two of my constituents, Vin-
cent 
Joseph 
Bechard 
and 
Peter 
Kreiner. 
Sadly, this tragedy took the life of 
67-year-old 
Vincent 
from 
Marlette. 
Vincent is survived by his children and 
several grandchildren. This horrific ac-
cident has also put 62-year-old Peter 
Kreiner, also from Marlette, in the hos-
pital in critical condition. 
Both men have championed the right 
to life and been decades-long devotees 
to our country, our communities, and 
its founding ideals. Their impact on 
their community will be felt long after 
this terrible tragedy. 
My prayers go out to the families of 
Vincent and Peter, and I am asking my 
colleagues in this Chamber to please 
pray for Mr. Bechard’s family and for 
the speedy and full recovery of Peter 
Kreiner. 
f 
NATIONAL DEFENSE IN THE 
CARIBBEAN 
(Ms. PLASKETT asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.) 
Ms. PLASKETT. Madam Speaker, I 
rise to speak on my amendment to the 
National Defense Authorization Act 
that directs the Department of De-
fense, in conjunction with the Depart-
ment of State and the Department of 
Homeland 
Security, 
to 
assess 
the 
standing U.S. military force posture in 
the Caribbean Basin and the value, fea-
sibility, and cost of increasing U.S. 
military capacity in the region. 
The Caribbean region has long been a 
place of geopolitical exertion of power 
by foreign forces. Presently, China has 
planted flags in numerous Caribbean 
nations through investment and infra-
structure. The United States is vulner-
able from a national security posture. 
This amendment is bipartisan, with 
support 
from 
our 
colleague 
rep-
resenting the island of Puerto Rico, 
Congresswoman GONZA´ LEZ-COLO´ N. This 
amendment is warranted, given the im-
portance of the U.S. national security 
apparatus 
to 
capably 
fight 
transnational crime and protect U.S. 
national and regional security in the 
region. Too often, the Caribbean is ig-
nored, and this amendment ensures 
that our Third Border is not forgotten 
as it confronts increasing regional po-
litical instability, hostile foreign en-
gagement, and transnational criminal 
activity. 
f 
PRESIDENT BIDEN’S IDEOLOGICAL 
PURGE OF THE MILITARY 
(Mrs. MILLER of Illinois asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute.) 
Mrs. MILLER of Illinois. Madam 
Speaker, last week, the Biden adminis-
tration announced that they are cut-
ting off the benefits for 60,000 National 
Guard and Reserve soldiers who do not 
want to take the COVID vaccine. 
We are losing some of our best and 
brightest servicemembers to the Biden 
administration’s ideological purge of 
our military. 
President 
Biden’s 
military 
purge 
weakens America and emboldens our 
adversaries, especially China.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5982 
July 13, 2022 
I am proud to join Congressman

vaccine mandates for our servicemem-
bers and to reinstate servicemembers 
who have been forced out due to the 
mandate. 
I will continue to advocate for our 
troops. 
f 
FOOD SAFETY IS A SECOND-CLASS 
CITIZEN AT THE FDA 
(Ms. DELAURO asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.) 
Ms. DELAURO. Madam Speaker, I 
rise in support of the Food Safety Ad-
ministration Act, which I am intro-
ducing today, along with Senator DICK 
DURBIN. 
The FDA regulates almost 80 percent 
of our food supply. Consumers and in-
dustry depend on the FDA to perform 
its regulatory role. Every year, nearly 
48 
million 
people 
get 
sick 
from 
foodborne illness, resulting in 128,000 
Americans being hospitalized and 3,000 
dying. This is preventable and costly. 
Between inadequate responses to re-
calls, a failure to implement a culture 
of outbreak prevention, and proposed 
rules and initiatives that languish for 
years, FDA’s food program has strug-
gled in its role to protect consumers. 
Food safety is a second-class citizen 
at the FDA. As highlighted by the in-
fant formula crisis, there are dire con-
sequences when food safety is not 
prioritized. The FDA has the authority 
to appoint a deputy commissioner of 
foods with a background in food safety 
but has yet to do so. This affects all as-
pects of FDA’s food program. 
That is why I am introducing this 
bill that will establish the Food Safety 
Administration 
under 
Health 
and 
Human Services and incorporate the 
existing food programs within the FDA 
into a separate agency. This will in-
crease leadership and accountability, 
strengthen oversight of the food sup-
ply, and enhance the industry’s ability 
to operate effectively. 
f 
HONORING THE LIFE OF DR. 
CHUCK RHEEM 
(Mrs. KIM of California asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute.) 
Mrs. 
KIM 
of 
California. 
Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to honor the life 
of Dr. Chuck Rheem, who was a leader 
in the Korean-American community 
and chairman of the U.S.-Korea Alli-
ance Association. 
Dr. Rheem had a special love for the 
United States and his home country of 
South Korea and dedicated himself to 
advocating for policies with numerous 
Presidential 
administrations 
to 
strengthen U.S.-Korea relations. 
As a veteran of the Korean war, Dr. 
Rheem also had a passion for honoring 
our Korean war veterans and hosted 
numerous events to thank them and 
honor their sacrifices. 
While Dr. Rheem is no longer with 
us, I know that his legacy will con-
tinue to live on through the efforts of 
the members of the U.S.-Korea Alli-
ance Association. 
I pray for God’s peace for his family, 
friends, and anyone who knew him. 
f 
OVERTURNING ROE OVERTURNED 
OUR FREEDOM 
(Ms. CLARK of Massachusetts asked 
and was given permission to address 
the House for 1 minute.) 
Ms. 
CLARK 
of 
Massachusetts. 
Madam Speaker, overturning Roe over-
turned our freedom. The freedom to 
make our own healthcare decisions is 
fundamental to our humanity and our 
dignity. It is about the right to control 
our own lives. 
It is about the mother of three who 
simply can’t afford to care for another 
child. It is about a young rape victim 
who shouldn’t be mandated to carry 
her attacker’s pregnancy to term. It is 
about the mom who desperately wants 
a baby but has a miscarriage and needs 
abortion care to prevent a potentially 
lethal infection. 
Government-mandated 
pregnancy, 
that is our new reality. 
This week, House Democrats will 
protect access to abortion and secure 
the right to reproductive care. We will 
fight against the Republican’s scorched 
earth campaign against freedom for 
women, freedom to practice our faith, 
and freedom to make decisions for our 
families. We will fight to let every per-
son control their bodies, their choices, 
and their futures. 
f 
PAYING TRIBUTE TO MAXINE 
RANDALL 
(Mr. WALBERG asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. WALBERG. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to pay tribute to Maxine 
Randall of Hillsdale, Michigan, who re-
cently passed away at the age of 92. 
After graduating from North Adams 
High School in 1948, Max played for the 
Fort Wayne Daisies of the All-Amer-
ican 
Girls 
Professional 
Baseball 
League, which was founded during 
World War II. 
During her 6 years in the league, Max 
was named as an all-star five times and 
compiled 116 wins—fifth in league his-
tory. 
Decades later, the women’s baseball 
league that Max starred in served as a 
catalyst for the hit movie ‘‘A League of 
Their Own.’’ 
Following her pro baseball career, 
Max worked at Jonesville Products for 
many years, where she met her late 
husband, Bob. 
As one relative described her, Max 
was ‘‘salt, grit, and a baseball mitt.’’ 
We send our condolences to the Ran-
dall family, and we celebrate an inspi-
rational life lived to the fullest.

PROTECTING WOMEN’S 
HEALTHCARE FREEDOM 
(Ms. BROWN of Ohio asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
her remarks.) 
Ms. BROWN of Ohio. Madam Speak-
er, while the decision to overturn Roe 
v. Wade has impacted millions of 
Americans, we must also acknowledge 
its economic and racial implications. 
We live in a country plagued by gen-
erations of healthcare inequities and 
racial disparities. Black, Latino, indig-
enous, and other communities of color 
already face healthcare barriers and 
will only continue to suffer in the 
aftermath of a post-Roe America. 
State trigger bills that restrict or 
ban more than half of a country from 
reproductive healthcare access have al-
ready stripped millions of their funda-
mental right to decide their reproduc-
tive care. But our fight continues. 
I implore my colleagues in Congress 
to unite to pass legislation to protect 
every American’s constitutional right 
to 
travel 
freely 
and 
voluntarily 
throughout the United States, includ-
ing for reproductive healthcare.

RECOGNIZING THE LIBERTY HIGH 
SCHOOL LADY PANTHERS 
(Mr. BABIN asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. BABIN. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize the Liberty High 
School Lady Panthers for winning the 
2022 Texas University Interscholastic 
League Division 4A State champion-
ship. 
This is the Lady Panthers’ second 
consecutive State title and the third in 
the last 5 years. Amazing. 
During their historic season, the 
Lady Panthers had a record of 38 wins 
and only 6 losses before defeating the 
Sweeny Bulldogs in the State cham-
pionship game on June 5. 
I am proud to say six Lady Panthers 
were named to the State UIL Softball 
4A 
All-Tournament 
Team: 
Kylie 
Bishop, 
Kamdyn 
Chandler, 
Reese 
Evans, 
Hollie 
Thomas, 
Bryana 
Pantalion, and Bailee Slack. Senior 
third baseman Kylie Bishop was named 
the tournament’s Most Valuable Play-
er. 
In a pregame ceremony before Lib-
erty’s State title game, Head Coach 
Karen Slack received recognition as 
the 2020–2021 National Federation of 
State High School Coaches’ Texas 
State Softball Coach of the Year. 
Madam Speaker, I again congratulate 
the Lady Panthers on their season of 
triumph. I am so very proud of all of 
them.

Mr. MORELLE. Madam Speaker, for 
the purpose of debate only, I yield the

ation of this resolution, all time yield-
ed is for the purpose of debate only. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. MORELLE. Madam Speaker, I 
ask unanimous consent that all Mem-
bers be given 5 legislative days to re-
vise and extend their remarks. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from New York? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. MORELLE. Madam Speaker, yes-
terday, the Rules Committee met and 
reported a rule, House Resolution 1224, 
for five measures. 
First, it provides for consideration of 
H.R. 7900 under a structured rule. The

ranking minority member of the Com-
mittee on Energy and Commerce, pro-
vides one motion to recommit for each 
bill, and self-executes a manager’s 
amendment on H.R. 8297. 
The rule further provides for consid-
eration of H.R. 6538 under a closed rule. 
The rule provides 1 hour of general de-
bate equally divided and controlled by 
the chair and ranking minority mem-
ber of the Committee on the Judiciary 
and provides one motion to recommit.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5984 
July 13, 2022 
The rule also provides for consider-
ation of S. 3373 under a closed rule. The 
rule provides 1 hour of general debate 
equally divided and controlled by the 
chair and ranking minority member of 
the Committee on Veterans’ Affairs 
and provides one motion to commit. 
Finally, the rule extends recess in-
structions, suspension authority, and 
same-day authority through July 19, 
2022, and provides the majority leader 
or his designee the ability to en bloc 
requested votes on suspension bills this 
week. 
Madam Speaker, this rule provides 
for consideration of meaningful legisla-
tion that I look forward to discussing 
with my colleagues today. I would like 
to start by sharing a few words on the 
National Defense Authorization Act for 
Fiscal Year 2023. 
Our Nation faces real and serious 
global challenges to our security every 
day, and safeguarding our national de-
fense is vital and necessary. The Rus-
sian 
Federation 
has 
launched 
an 
unprovoked invasion of the free and 
democratic Nation of Ukraine, while an 
emboldened Chinese military threatens 
our allies in the Pacific. 
America must be prepared to face 
these threats by promoting political 
stability and diplomatic engagement 
and ensuring our military is prepared 
to meet increased threats to global sta-
bility. 
I am a proud member of the House 
Armed Services Committee, and this 
year, for the 62nd consecutive year in a 
row, the committee has marked up and 
reported a National Defense Authoriza-
tion Act to address our national de-
fense needs. 
The fiscal year 2023 NDAA includes 
critical investments in our service-
members, bolsters our position as a 
leader in technological innovation to 
compete with countries like China, and 
ensures we are prepared to face the co-
ercions of adversaries who already 
threaten global peace and stability. 
I thank the leadership of Chairman 
SMITH and Ranking Member ROGERS 
for delivering a bipartisan bill that 
prioritizes the needs of our service-
members and provides the resources to 
protect global security and peace. 
Today, we are also considering the 
rule for the Honoring our PACT Act. It 
has been a long road to get here, and I 
thank Chairman TAKANO and Ranking 
Member BOST for their efforts to get 
this done. 
Back home, I have had the oppor-
tunity to meet with toxic-exposed vet-
erans and their families, and I have 
heard loud and clear just how nec-
essary this legislation is for our vet-
erans. 
When we send our servicemembers 
into harm’s way, we make a promise 
that when they come home, we will 
take care of them. 
Sadly, over 3.5 million veterans were 
exposed to toxic fumes and carcinogens 
while serving our Nation, resulting in 
life-threatening lung diseases and can-
cers. Right now, they are not getting 
the care they need due to a disability 
benefits claims process that is cum-
bersome and places the burden to prove 
toxic exposure on veterans themselves. 
b 1045 
By creating a presumption for dis-
ability, this legislation will help cut 
through the red tape and ensure noth-
ing stands in the way of servicemem-
bers receiving their care. 
It is time we make good on our prom-
ise to ensure all veterans exposed to 
toxic substances during their service 
can access the essential care and bene-
fits they have earned. 
Madam Speaker, I am proud to sup-
port this bill and look forward to its 
passage. 
Madam Speaker, the rule today also 
provides for consideration of the Active 
Shooter Alert Act, which, frankly, 
should have passed under suspension in 
June. This commonsense legislation 
would create a communications net-
work to alert people when an active 
shooter is in their community. 
It is tragic to think we even need 
such a system, but sadly, the fear of a 
mass shooting has become a persistent 
dark cloud shrouding our Nation. 
Let’s take a moment to reflect on the 
horrific scene on July 4 when the High-
land Park community was attacked. 
What should have been a joyous occa-
sion for families, friends, and commu-
nity members instead became a night-
mare when a dangerous person wielding 
a dangerous weapon fired into the 
crowd, killing seven and injuring doz-
ens more. 
There are those who, yet again, of-
fered their thoughts and prayers in re-
sponse to the Highland Park shooting, 
yet provided no real solutions. But 
there are solutions—in fact, this body 
has passed countless measures that 
could have helped prevent such a tragic 
event. 
I have made my position clear— 
meaningful, commonsense gun reform 
is an absolute necessity. To my col-
leagues who regularly oppose solutions 
to gun violence, I ask: What are you 
willing to do to help protect our com-
munities? 
Let’s at least come together on legis-
lation that creates a warning system 
for communities when an active shoot-
er is present so more innocent lives can 
be saved. We are talking about an alert 
system, just like those already in place 
for disasters like tornados, earth-
quakes, and AMBER Alerts. I can’t 
imagine who would be opposed to such 
a commonsense step. 
I thank the more than 40 Republicans 
who evaluated the merits of this 
straightforward bill and voted in favor 
this June, and I hope we can count on 
your vote again this week. 
Any action is better than no action, 
which is why I am proud to support 
this legislation—but we also know it 
barely scratches the surface of the 
many other reforms that are needed, 
which is why I will continue fighting 
for measures to ban assault weapons, 
limit high-capacity magazines, and 
enact universal background checks on 
every gun sale. 
Madam Speaker, I would like to end 
my opening remarks with comments on 
two fundamental healthcare bills in-
cluded in this rule: The Women’s 
Health Protection Act and the Ensur-
ing Women’s Right to Reproductive 
Freedom Act. 
These bills will empower women and 
reaffirm their right to make inde-
pendent and informed healthcare deci-
sions. 
Over the past year we have seen an 
all-out assault on women’s bodily au-
tonomy. The appalling Supreme Court 
decision to overturn Roe v. Wade was 
just the beginning. We have seen 
States undertake efforts to criminalize 
a woman’s right to make basic family 
planning decisions. 
We have seen a 10-year-old child, a 
victim of rape, forced out of her State 
for the healthcare she desperately 
needs. We have seen increased Federal 
efforts to restrict access to women’s 
healthcare, contraception, and the fun-
damental right to privacy. 
These 
astounding 
restrictions 
on 
women are exactly why we need the 
Women’s Health Protection Act. 
The Federal law will codify the provi-
sions of Roe v. Wade and establish a 
statutory 
right 
to 
access 
the 
healthcare all women need and deserve. 
We also need to pass the Ensuring 
Women’s Right to Reproductive Free-
dom Act, legislation I proudly cospon-
sor. 
It is a sad state of affairs that we 
need to codify the fundamental right to 
interstate travel in this country, pro-
tecting women from civil and criminal 
liability, even when seeking an abor-
tion in a State where it is lawful. 
The fact that we have already seen 
efforts in State legislatures to prevent 
women from seeking lawful abortions 
across State lines completely con-
tradicts the claim that overturning 
Roe v. Wade was about returning the 
decision to the States. 
The radical right has and always will 
be about restricting women’s rights. It 
is hard to believe we are living in 2022, 
not 1722. By passing this legislation, we 
are making it clear that this assault on 
women’s rights cannot stand. 
I urge my colleagues to show this 
country and the world that we respect 
women, we trust women, and we sup-
port women and their right to make in-
formed and independent healthcare de-
cisions. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to 
the distinguished gentlewoman from 
California (Ms. PELOSI), the Speaker of 
the House. 
Ms. 
PELOSI. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
I 
thank the gentleman for his leadership 
on the very important elements of the 
rule that will be brought to the floor 
today. I thank him, and I thank all the 
members of the Rules Committee. I 
particularly want to acknowledge the 
leadership of Chairman JIM MCGOVERN 
for his leadership in bringing so much

July 13, 2022 
policy to bear in this one rule as we 
proceed with the week’s legislation. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today in what 
is a momentous week for our House 
Democratic majority as we carry on 
our work to defend Americans’ health, 
security, and freedom. 
The rule includes five pieces of land-
mark legislation, which the gentleman, 
Mr. MORELLE, has very clearly ex-
plained. I thank him and Mr. MCGOV-
ERN for their skilled leadership in as-
sembling this rule and steering this 
crucial legislation to the floor. 
First, this week we will have our 
version of the NDAA. It supports our 
Nation’s 
servicemen 
and 
service-
women, it strengthens our national se-
curity, and promotes national leader-
ship in the global arena. 
Our majority is delivering new pay 
raises for heroic men and women in 
uniform, while securing more invest-
ments in next-generation defense tech-
nology to keep us strong and quali-
tatively superior. 
We are strengthening the security of 
DOD supply chains, while advancing 
new and fundamental research and de-
velopment at HBCUs and MSIs. 
We 
are 
further 
supporting 
the 
Ukrainian people in their fight for de-
mocracy with $1 billion in additional 
security assistance. 
I salute Chairman ADAM SMITH and 
the Armed Services Committee for 
their persistent patriotic leadership in 
assembling this legislation, which will 
help ensure that Americans are safe 
and our democracy is secure. 
Again, when we are talking about our 
security, we have to talk about our 
veterans. As we have said, we promised 
them when they fight for us, we will 
protect them when they come home. 
This bill, the PACT Act, takes another 
monumental step to care for our brave 
men 
and 
women 
in 
uniform—who 
risked their lives to fight the enemy, 
but now face the deadly threat of expo-
sure to dangerous toxins. 
The legislation in this bill, I believe, 
will be strongly bipartisan, deliver ac-
cess to VA healthcare to millions of 
veterans suffering from dangerous dis-
eases caused by their exposures. 
Madam Speaker, I thank Chairman 
MARK TAKANO for making and address-
ing toxic exposure as a top priority in 
Congress—the PACT Act. 
Next, the Active Shooter Alert Act, 
which the gentleman from New York 
very clearly spelled out. We will pass 
the Active Shooter Alert Act—Mr. 
MORELLE described it very well—and I 
agree, it is a step, and we must have 
what he said he supports, and I do, 
too—the ban on assault weapons and 
other lethality. 
This Federal legislation that we are 
doing today will quickly warn commu-
nities when a gunman opens fire. It is 
a commonsense, lifesaving measure 
widely supported by law enforcement. 
Let us recognize Congressman DAVID 
CICILLINE, a longtime champion in the 
fight against gun violence, for spear-
heading this legislation, and also being 
the author of the assault weapons ban. 
The fourth and fifth bills that our 
Democratic majority will pass this 
week take strong action to defend 
women’s health and freedom. 
Our Caucus has been hard at work as-
sembling a robust and resolute legisla-
tive response to the Supreme Court’s 
assault on reproductive rights. We 
passed 
this 
legislation 
before, 
the 
WHPA, the Women’s Health Protection 
Act, which will enshrine the essential 
protections of Roe v. Wade as the law 
of the land. 
And with our Ensuring Women’s 
Right to Reproductive Freedom Act, 
we will reaffirm the constitutional 
right to travel and have access to the 
abortion pill. 
Let us salute Congresswoman JUDY 
CHU for her leadership. We passed this 
bill in the fall and we need to pass it 
again. 
We 
thank 
Congresswomen 
FLETCHER
and STRICKLAND
and Con-
gressman RASKIN for their tireless, de-
termined leadership on the Ensuring 
Women’s Right to Reproductive Free-
dom Act. 
Madam Speaker, this legislation that 
the House Democrats will pass this 
week is the latest in our work to de-
fend Americans’ health, security, and 
freedom. Our majority will never re-
lent in this fight—now and in the fu-
ture. 
Madam Speaker, I urge a strong 
‘‘yes’’ vote on the rule today and ‘‘yes’’ 
votes on the five bills that we are con-
sidering in the days ahead. 
Mr. COLE. Madam Speaker, I thank 
my very good friend, the gentleman 
from New York (Mr. MORELLE) for 
yielding me the customary 30 minutes, 
and I yield myself such time as I may 
consume. 
Madam Speaker, today’s rule covers 
several major items. The first that I 
will discuss, H.R. 7900, the National De-
fense Authorization Act for fiscal year 
2023, is of the greatest importance to 
the Nation and to the world. 
For 61 years in a row the NDAA has 
become law. As I reminded my col-
leagues in the Rules Committee yester-
day, this record of achievement has 
only been possible because of the im-
mense cooperation from both sides of 
the aisle and is a testament to what we 
can accomplish when we focus on our 
shared goals as a Nation. 
Working together, Democrats and 
Republicans on the Armed Services 
Committee produced a bipartisan prod-
uct. I applaud Chairman SMITH, Rank-
ing Member ROGERS, and all the mem-
bers of the Armed Services Committee 
for their efforts. 
Madam Speaker, it is no secret that 
the world has become a more dan-
gerous place in recent years. Last year 
saw the Taliban—a corrupt and mili-
tant 
organization 
known 
for 
sup-
porting and providing sanctuary to ter-
rorists—complete its takeover of Af-
ghanistan. 
Earlier this year, the world was 
shocked by Vladimir Putin’s brazen, 
unprovoked, and indeed outright crimi-
nal invasion of Ukraine, Russia’s demo-
cratic neighbor to the west. 
Communist China continues its his-
tory of aggression in Asia and the Pa-
cific Rim, including increasingly ag-
gressive acts toward Taiwan. 
North Korea has continued an ag-
gressive posturing toward the United 
States and our democratic allies in 
Asia. 
Iran continues its long march toward 
becoming a nuclear state. 
It is more important than ever that 
Congress speaks with one voice when it 
comes to setting our national defense 
policy and funding priorities each year 
so that we can ensure we counter ag-
gressive actors and offer our allies the 
support they need to protect them-
selves. 
One of the most important things ac-
complished in this year’s NDAA is ac-
tually what it did not do. For the sec-
ond year in a row, the Armed Services 
Committee rejected President Biden’s 
proposed defense budget number and 
authorized a better, higher number to 
ensure that our national defense is 
properly funded. 
Indeed, President Biden’s first two 
budget proposals looked set to con-
tinue the chronic underfunding of the 
Obama-Biden years, during which time 
our military readiness declined and our 
rivals on the international stage were 
empowered. 
The increased funding in this bill will 
go a long way toward ensuring that 
America’s military is ready to confront 
any challenge. It will ensure that our 
armed services personnel receive a 4.6 
percent pay raise, the largest in his-
tory, with additional pay bonuses to 
personnel who make the least to offset 
the inflation caused by this adminis-
tration’s policies. 
On the whole, I am proud to support 
this legislation and I encourage the en-
tire House to support this measure and 
send it on to the Senate. 
Madam Speaker, our second item in 
the House is S. 3373, the Honoring our 
PACT Act. While this bill has gone 
through a frustratingly long process to 
get to this point, I believe we have 
failed to provide our Nation’s toxic-ex-
posed veterans with the care that they 
need for far too long. 
I will be the first to admit that this 
bill is not perfect. I share the concerns 
of many about the use of mandatory 
spending in this bill. Given the impor-
tance of this issue to veterans nation-
wide, and to those in my district, I can-
not let the perfect be the enemy of the 
good. Imperfect though it is, this bill 
does take important strides forward, 
and I plan to support it on final pas-
sage. 
Unfortunately, two other bills con-
tained in this rule are partisan and 
stand no chance of becoming law. The 
Democratic majority is attempting to 
insert a right to an abortion into Fed-
eral law, preempting every State law 
that seeks to protect life. 
They want to require all States to 
permit abortion on demand at any time 
up to the point of birth. They want to 
outlaw commonsense restrictions, like

preventing late-term abortions, pre-
venting sex-selective abortions, and 
preventing abortions targeting fetuses 
with Down syndrome. 
They want to prevent States from 
adopting commonsense protections for 
the unborn, such as banning mail-order 
and telemedicine abortion services. 
They want to limit the rights of par-
ents by creating a cause of action for 
outsiders to interfere with the parent- 
child relationship. That would be an 
unconscionable state of affairs, Madam 
Speaker. 
I remind my colleagues of the words 
of the Declaration of Independence: 
that the right to life is one of those in-
alienable rights endowed upon us all, 
including unborn children, by our Cre-
ator. 
I will always stand strongly in favor 
of defending life, and I proudly stand in 
opposition to these bills today. 
Madam Speaker, I urge opposition to 
this rule, and I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
b 1100 
Mr. MORELLE. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. I will make a couple of points on 
what I think is one of the most impor-
tant issues that we will face in this 
Congress and in the future years. 
Abortion access in America changed 
overnight after the Supreme Court 
took away a woman’s constitutional 
right to make her own reproductive 
health decisions. Nearly 34 million peo-
ple of reproductive age now live in a 
State where abortion is banned or se-
verely 
restricted—one 
of 
the 
only 
times that I know of that the Supreme 
Court of the United States in our his-
tory took away a fundamental con-
stitutional right to more than half of 
America. My 86-year-old mother who is 
a grandmother and great-grandmother 
will have had more right over her body 
and more decision-making under this 
decision than her granddaughters and 
great-granddaughters. 
It is unconscionable, and the impact 
of this decision will have horrific con-
sequences for millions of people, par-
ticularly people with the greatest bur-
den: low-income individuals, people of 
color, and victims of incest and abuse. 
I am genuinely concerned, as are mil-
lions of people, for women’s rights in 
this country. We refuse to be compla-
cent, and we refuse to stand silent. We 
will keep fighting every single day 
however I can and however we can. 
Today that means supporting the ad-
vancement of the Women’s Health Pro-
tection Act. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to 
the gentlewoman from Pennsylvania 
(Ms. SCANLON), who is a distinguished 
member of the Rules Committee. 
Ms. SCANLON. Madam Speaker, it 
has been less than 3 weeks since MITCH 
MCCONNELL’s hand-picked, rightwing 
Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade 
and with it 50 years of settled law re-
garding the fundamental privacy right 
of women to make their own decisions 
regarding their own healthcare. That 
decision has also called into question a 
host of other privacy rights that Amer-
icans had taken for granted, including 
the right to obtain contraception and 
the right to interracial and same-sex 
marriage. 
Not surprisingly, the result has been 
chaos. 
Why? 
Because this decision is deeply un-
popular and goes against the values of 
a strong majority of Americans: that a 
woman should have the essential free-
dom to decide when and if to bear chil-
dren and how many and that politi-
cians should not be in the business of 
mandating that women carry dan-
gerous or unwanted pregnancies to 
term. 
But in the wake of that extremist de-
cision, we are already seeing politi-
cians across the country seize this mo-
ment to substitute their own religious, 
economic, and, frankly, misogynistic 
views for that of women who have to 
live with the consequences of those re-
productive healthcare decisions. 
The vast majority of Americans un-
derstand that we don’t need or want 
politicians invading our doctors’ of-
fices and a woman’s privacy to impose 
an extremist, minority view because 
the reality is that these decisions are 
complicated. They are complicated by 
the physical health of both the woman 
and the fetus. They are complicated by 
the mental and financial health of the 
family. 
They 
are 
complicated 
by 
whether or not the pregnancy was the 
result of abuse or criminal activity. 
They are complicated by the religious 
beliefs of those involved because the 
rightwing views on pregnancy that the 
conservative Court has adopted are not 
shared by most Americans or by the 
medical profession or even by all major 
religions. 
These decisions are complicated by 
whether or not there was access to 
birth control. 
In a society that for decades has 
prioritized the well-being of unborn 
fetuses over that of children and fami-
lies or even the health of pregnant 
women, it is complicated by whether or 
not a family has the means to provide 
for the basic needs of a mother or 
child, much less the opportunity for 
them to thrive or even enjoy life, lib-
erty, or the pursuit of happiness. 
Unfortunately, the Republican legis-
lature in Pennsylvania has jumped on 
this rightwing bandwagon, as well. 
Last week, in the middle of the night, 
Republican lawmakers in Pennsylvania 
changed the rules of their house forbid-
ding votes after 11 p.m. in order to ram 
through a constitutional amendment 
to limit access to abortion care. They 
had to use a constitutional amendment 
to get around the Governor’s veto and 
regular order because their proposal is 
deeply unpopular with the majority of 
Pennsylvanians. 
These attacks on our essential Amer-
ican freedoms cannot stand. Our fami-
lies and freedoms are on the line, and it 
is more important than ever that we 
fight to protect and expand reproduc-
tive freedom. 
The bills we are considering today 
are a critical fight for a world where 
all Americans—no matter who they 
are, where they live, or what they be-
lieve—have the freedom to make their 
own decisions about if and when to 
start or grow a family. So I am proud 
to support the passage of both the 
Women’s Health Protection Act for a 
second time in this Congress and the 
Ensuring Access to Abortion Act. 
As we see States start to pass laws 
that would limit the right of women to 
travel—think about that, the right to 
travel—to obtain healthcare, the En-
suring Access to Abortion Act makes it 
possible and safe for women needing 
abortion care to travel to States where 
it is accessible. These two bills are 
critical to enshrining a woman’s right 
to an abortion and to reproductive 
healthcare into Federal law. I am 
proud to support these bills. 
Mr. COLE. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Madam Speaker, if we defeat the pre-
vious question, I will offer an amend-
ment to the rule to bring up H. Res. 11 
for immediate consideration. This reso-
lution proposes an amendment to the 
Constitution of the United States to 
require that the Supreme Court of the 
United States be composed of nine Jus-
tices. 
Madam Speaker, the Supreme Court 
has been set at nine Justices for 153 
years. Fundamentally changing the 
composition of the Court to satisfy the 
demands of one political party would 
permanently erode the independence of 
the judicial branch and forever alter 
the separation of powers, which is the 
very foundation our Constitution and 
our Nation were built upon. 
The independence of the judicial 
branch is too sacred to subject it to the 
political issue of the day. The appoint-
ment of a Supreme Court Justice is not 
a popularity contest, and the Court’s 
decisions should not be based on polls. 
The Supreme Court’s duty is to the 
Constitution and ensuring that adher-
ence to the laws of the land. 
To further explain the amendment, I 
yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from 
South Dakota (Mr. JOHNSON), who is 
my very good friend and the author of 
the resolution. 
Mr. JOHNSON of South Dakota. 
Madam Speaker, I thank the gen-
tleman, and I thank leadership for 
making my bill a priority on the floor 
today. 
We have heard from a number of ear-
lier speakers that recent Supreme 
Court decisions have upset the major-
ity. These are decisions that they dis-
agree with. 
Now, these are judicial decisions that 
were rendered under rules that have 
been in place for more than 150 years. 
But there seems to be a growing force 
of people who want to change the rules, 
that if we didn’t get the decision we 
wanted under the rules that have been

July 13, 2022 
in place since 1869, then let’s go ahead 
and change the rules. Let’s go ahead 
and pack the Court. 
If nine Justices doesn’t get what we 
want, then let’s add two. Well, if 
maybe two more Justices doesn’t get 
us what we want, then let’s add four. 
Maybe we can get with four Justices 
the kinds of decisions we want. 
Madam Speaker, this is not a hypo-
thetical boogieman. This is an actual 
pending legislation introduced by none 
other than the chairman of the Judici-
ary Committee. It is an active attempt 
to pack the Court with 13 Justices. 
Now, you might ask, Madam Speak-
er, is 13 the right number? 
Does 13 come about because there has 
been some report or some analysis that 
13 Justices would make the work of the 
Court more productive? 
Or perhaps the Supreme Court itself, 
the Justices, have indicated that they 
would do a better job with 13? 
No. No. It does not come about be-
cause of any independent analysis or 
request by the Court. This attempt to 
pack the Court is all about power. It is 
all about power. It is all about getting 
the kinds of decisions that the House 
majority wants. 
Madam Speaker, I would submit that 
when Washington changes the rules 
only to acquire power or only to main-
tain power, then it undermines public 
trust in these institutions that bind 
Americans together. We don’t need yet 
a further undermining of these institu-
tions. 
Frankly, where does it end? 
Once this body establishes that the 
size of the Court can grow only so that 
we can secure the preferred judicial de-
cisions of the House majority, where 
does it end? 
You take it to 13. A few years later 
we take it to 15. You can take it to 17 
after that. 
Again, this is not a hypothetical 
boogieman. We have seen this happen 
in other countries. 
Madam Speaker, this leads to mad-
ness. This is no way to run a judiciary. 
Now, you don’t need to take my word 
for it. Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg be-
fore her death made it clear that pack-
ing the Court would undermine and 
erode public trust in the Supreme 
Court. She was stridently opposed to 
it. Retiring Justice Stephen Breyer 
feels the same and has publicly been 
opposed to packing the Court. 
This is not something that only Re-
publicans oppose. It is something that 
reasonable and like-minded people who 
care about the independence and the 
public trust of the Court have opposed, 
as well. 
So that is what my resolution would 
do. It would simply put into the Con-
stitution what has already been the 
case since 1869, and that is nine Jus-
tices on the Supreme Court. 
I guarantee you, Madam Speaker, 
that we will still find plenty of polit-
ical screws to turn and leverage points 
for us to be able to fight and advance 
our political causes. But if we can just 
put into the Constitution this one 
thing, to keep the nine, we will be able 
to, at least somehow, insulate the 
Court from the most corrosive political 
maneuvering that we know this body is 
capable of. 
Now, I make it clear, a ‘‘no’’ vote on 
the previous question which I am urg-
ing does not submit this constitutional 
amendment to the States. All it does is 
allow this body 1 hour to debate the 
merits of keeping the nine. 
What possible argument could there 
be against taking that 1 hour for us to 
discuss together what the right size of 
the Court is and how do we best main-
tain public trust in the Court going 
forward? 
So, Madam Speaker, I ask my col-
leagues on both sides of the aisle to 
heed the words of Ruth Bader Gins-
burg, Stephen Breyer, Joe Biden, and 
so many of us on this side of the aisle 
to consider keeping the nine. 
Mr. MORELLE. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
While this is not on the agenda, and 
I will remind people that we have a 
rule that stipulates which bills are in 
front of us, I note with alarm the sug-
gestion that we ought to change the 
Constitution when it comes to the Su-
preme Court, and for fear that we are 
undermining the confidence of the 
Court, frankly, I am astonished. 
How about following the current Con-
stitution? 
Forget about amending it. 
How about following the one that we 
have? 
I just note that when Merrick Gar-
land 
was 
nominated 
by 
President 
Obama in March of 2016, 293 days his 
nomination went without any action in 
the United States Senate. Amy Coney 
Barrett was nominated September 26, a 
mere 6 weeks, 5 weeks before election 
day. Senator MCCONNELL and the Sen-
ate didn’t follow the Constitution 
which says advise and consent on 
nominations sent by the President. 
They did absolutely nothing with the 
nominee Garland. They didn’t seek to 
do anything. In fact, MITCH MCCONNELL 
talked about the politics of it. 
Talk about undermining the con-
fidence of the American public in the 
Supreme Court? 
How about that? 
Yet when President Trump just 5 
weeks before a Presidential election 
made a nomination, it was swiftly 
pushed through. 
Undermining confidence in the Su-
preme Court? 
How about confirmation proceedings 
where 
Brett 
Kavanaugh 
or 
Neil 
Gorsuch both said that Roe is settled 
law; a precedent for 50 years? 
They said it in confirmation hear-
ings. They have said it as Senator COL-
LINS has indicated her vote hung on 
those words. Yet they had no intention 
of following those words. They misled 
the American public. 
Undermining confidence in the Su-
preme Court? 
I am astonished that anyone would 
even say it. 
Frankly, when we talk about this, we 
know what the agenda here is. Justice 
Thomas gave us a clear roadmap of 
where this is all headed. 
Undermining confidence in the Su-
preme Court? 
Justice Thomas urged the Court to 
reconsider all of this Court’s sub-
stantive due process precedence, in-
cluding the right to contraception, the 
right to private consensual acts, and 
the right to same-sex marriage, charac-
terizing the entire legal doctrine as 
particularly dangerous. 
Undermining the confidence of the 
Supreme Court of the United States? 
Now, Justice Kavanaugh, I will say 
to his credit in his concurrence, said 
that the Court won’t go that far. But 
we have heard these same assurances 
from Justice Kavanaugh before, and I 
think they aren’t worth the words on 
the paper that this is printed. 
We should be very, very concerned. 
We should be concerned that the Amer-
ican public has lost confidence in the 
Supreme Court, but not because of the 
actions of anyone here or the sugges-
tions here. 
How about because of the actions of 
the United States Senate and the ac-
tions of the Supreme Court itself? 
Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to 
the 
distinguished 
gentleman 
from 
Texas (Mr. ALLRED). 
b 1115 
Mr. ALLRED. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today in support of one of the most 
fundamental rights imaginable in a 
free society, the right to bodily auton-
omy and the freedom to choose when 
and how to begin a family. 
As I stand here today, Texas women 
do not have that right. In Texas right 
now, a woman is required, by law, to 
either carry to term the offspring of 
their rapist or their abuser or drive 5 
hours or more to Kansas, New Mexico, 
Colorado, or anywhere they can get ac-
cess to abortion services. 
Now, some extremist Republicans in 
Texas want to prevent Texans from 
leaving the State to obtain an abor-
tion. The same so-called conservatives 
who talk about Big Government want 
to tell Texas women where they can 
travel or are threatening the employ-
ers of those women who offer to pay for 
their travel. 
What is next, Madam Speaker? Will 
they place checkpoints on our inter-
state highways, or question women 
boarding a plane or a train about the 
nature of their travel? 
Does this sound like freedom to any-
one? 
I will not stand for it. My colleagues 
and I will not stand for it. The Ensur-
ing Access to Abortion Act ensures 
that all American women have the 
right to travel within the United 
States, a right that we should not have 
to be affirming today but one that we 
will. 
Mr. COLE. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5988 
July 13, 2022 
Madam Speaker, as has become all 
too common with the Democratic ma-
jority, when the status quo doesn’t lead 
to the outcome they want, they simply 
change the rules to suit their needs. 
You need to only look at the last 2 
years 
for 
evidence: 
fundamentally 
changing the way the House operates 
through the use of proxy voting; a com-
plete lockdown of alternative ideas; 
fewer and fewer committees doing the 
work to make the law rather than 
score political points—all aimed at 
protecting their razor-thin majority at 
the expense of the institution and the 
Nation. 
Democrats’ current obsession with 
the Supreme Court is no different, but 
instead of accepting the independence 
of the judiciary, the majority is, in-
stead, intent on fixing the rules of the 
game to ensure their own victory. This 
amendment to the Constitution would 
prevent that from happening and would 
ensure, once and for all, that the Su-
preme Court will be independent and 
free of meddling based on the political 
ideas of the day. 
Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous 
consent to insert the text of my 
amendment in the RECORD, along with 
the extraneous material, immediately 
prior to the vote on the previous ques-
tion. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Ms. 
MANNING). Is there objection to the re-
quest of the gentleman from Okla-
homa? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. COLE. Madam Speaker, I urge a 
‘‘no’’ vote on the previous question, 
and I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman 
from North Dakota (Mr. ARMSTRONG), 
my very good friend. 
Mr. ARMSTRONG. Madam Speaker, 
the Constitution grants Congress the 
power over the size and composition of 
the judiciary. The Judiciary Act of 1789 
and subsequent laws established this 
structure. 
Since 1869, the number of Justices 
has been fixed at nine. Congress has 
the authority to change that number. 
Whether Congress should exercise this 
authority is another question entirely, 
and whether Congress should exercise 
that authority in a 50/50 Senate and a 
single-digit majority in the House is 
another question. 
In Sykes v. United States, Justice 
Scalia wrote: ‘‘It should be no surprise 
that as the volume’’ of law ‘‘increases, 
so do the number of imprecise laws. 
. . . Fuzzy, leave-the-details-to-be-sort-
ed-out-by-the-courts legislation is at-
tractive to the Congressman who wants 
credit’’ without dealing with ‘‘the 
nitty-gritty.’’ 
The real problem is that Congress 
doesn’t want to deal with the nitty- 
gritty. We want to fundraise off of top- 
line messages and vague legislative 
text. 
We write ambiguous law that leaves 
important details and major questions 
to unelected bureaucrats. The decisions 
of those unelected bureaucrats inevi-
tably are left to be sorted out by the 
courts. The Court is merely doing its 
job to say what the law is. 
Our reaction should be to take back 
our Article I authority and to clearly 
articulate congressional intent. If we 
write detailed laws, judges will prop-
erly implement Congress’ intent. 
Instead, too many in this body seek 
to 
exploit 
congressional 
inaction, 
choosing to double down on fundraising 
pleas by bashing the courts and prom-
ising to pack judges onto the Court to 
guarantee their preferred outcome. 
Here is a better idea. If you can’t 
pass the Clean Power Plan through 
Congress, don’t ask the EPA to imple-
ment it and then feign outrage when 
the Court says, no, that is not how a 
democratic republic is supposed to 
work. 
James Madison said Congress would 
fight to the death to protect its Article 
I authority. Unfortunately, I think 
what we have seen is that Congress will 
fight to the death to maintain their 
membership in Congress. 
Now, the one way in which far too 
many on the left want to exert our Ar-
ticle I authority is to pack the Court 
so Congress can continue to outsource 
legislating to the bureaucratic state 
and then ensure the Court gives them 
the decision they would like. 
Madam Speaker, I urge everyone to 
defeat the previous question. 
Mr. MORELLE. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
I appreciate the distinguished gen-
tleman and his comments. I note, just 
in passing, that Article I authority 
given to us by the Framers actually 
gave us the authority to identify the 
size of the Supreme Court. 
Constitutional amendments are not 
Article I. They are an extensive process 
that involves ratification. Article I au-
thority, actually—I think he would 
make my argument—Article I author-
ity would be the Congress making the 
decision on the size of the Supreme 
Court, which has been changed many 
times, from as few as six to as many as 
nine judges. 
But having said that, and just mak-
ing that point, let’s talk about some of 
the real issues that need addressing 
that, frankly, are before us, because 
the size of the Supreme Court is not be-
fore us, as interesting as that conversa-
tion might be. Let’s talk, instead, 
about issues that real Americans face. 
While bravely serving our country, 
many veterans were exposed to haz-
ards, from burn pits, PFAS, and radi-
ation, toxic exposures that have caused 
cancers, infertility, respiratory condi-
tions, and unexplained chronic ill-
nesses. As many as 3.5 million service-
members have been exposed to dan-
gerous toxic fumes. 
The cost of war goes far beyond the 
battlefield, and we have a duty to up-
hold our promises to toxic-exposed vet-
erans by investing in the healthcare 
they need and so richly deserve. 
In their time of need, veterans should 
be receiving high-quality care. Instead, 
they are being burdened with proving 
that their illness is connected to their 
service. 
I have had the privilege of meeting 
with many veterans in my community, 
and the families of veterans who have 
been lost because of exposure, while 
they continue the work of having to 
prove that their illness is a result of 
exposure to toxic chemicals, to car-
cinogens, to burn pits. 
The Honoring our PACT Act is in-
cluded in this rule, and this legislation 
will address the wide range of issues 
impacting toxic-exposed veterans and 
their access to earned benefits and 
care. You can bet I am voting ‘‘yes.’’ 
That is one of the bills being dis-
cussed before us today, and I think peo-
ple watching us on television, people 
watching this later, seeing clips, would 
be curious as to why suddenly we are 
talking about an issue not on the floor, 
not before us. But this is, the Honoring 
our PACT Act, before us today. 
We can all do something to safeguard 
those who have served in our Armed 
Forces and their families by doing the 
right thing, passing this rule, and pass-
ing the underlying legislation. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. COLE. Madam Speaker, I yield 4 
minutes to the gentleman from Texas 
(Mr. BURGESS), my very good friend 
and a distinguished member of the 
Rules Committee and the Energy and 
Commerce Committee. 
Mr. BURGESS. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman for yielding the 
time. 
Before coming to Congress, I prac-
ticed medicine for nearly 30 years. I 
had the privilege of delivering 3,000 ba-
bies. I dedicated my career as a physi-
cian to protecting the lives of children 
and families and running a pro-life 
practice in north Texas. I have seen 
both sides of this argument, both as a 
doctor and a policymaker. 
Indeed, the chairman of the Depart-
ment of OB/GYN at Parkland Hos-
pital’s Southwestern Medical School, 
when I was a resident, pointed out to 
us that those of us who were privileged 
to begin the practice of obstetrics were 
unique in medicine in that we are 
going to be charged with taking care of 
two patients, with a combined life ex-
pectancy of over 100 years, and almost 
nowhere else in medicine do you have 
that ability to impact the future. 
Back in 2002, I decided to run for Con-
gress because I saw lawmakers, par-
ticularly in Congress, who have never 
experienced taking care of a patient, 
discussing and setting the stage for 
how you are supposed to run a medical 
practice. 
Today is no different. It is deeply 
frustrating 
to 
see 
individuals 
dis-
cussing procedures with little under-
standing of how or why they are per-
formed and how they affect the pa-
tients involved, both the mother and 
the baby. 
Throughout my time as an OB/GYN, I 
have taken care of women with ectopic

pregnancies—never 
any 
hesitation. 
That does not change after a Supreme 
Court decision. 
I have taken care of women who, un-
fortunately, were suffering from mis-
carriages. That will not change after a 
Supreme Court decision. 
I have had cases where a woman had 
an abortion at another location and 
then presented to my hospital in a cri-
sis because of complications. Without 
hesitation, I would render care to those 
patients, irrespective of any Supreme 
Court decision. 
Many of those cases, indeed, were 
life-threatening, but each and every 
time, my responsibility was to step in 
and save a life. Again, that is done 
without hesitation. The Supreme Court 
decision changes none of that, despite 
the heated rhetoric we are hearing 
from the other side. 
It seems like a simple answer: Have 
an abortion, take care of a problem. 
Back in 1973, when Roe v. Wade was 
first decided, medical sonography was 
really just beginning. In the time since 
then, it has really developed into a 
science unto itself. 
In fact, two generations of Americans 
since Roe v. Wade was decided have as 
their first picture in their baby book 
an ultrasound picture or maybe a vid-
eotape of themselves as an unborn 
child. Indeed, two generations of Amer-
icans have no trouble assigning agency 
to that pregnancy because they know 
from whence they came. 
An abortion is a highly complex and 
deeply emotional decision. The deci-
sion affects, yes, the mother. No ques-
tion that it affects the baby and affects 
other family members. Yes, it affects 
the provider as well. 
My belief in the right to life has in-
fluenced my professional career for 
much longer than my time in Congress, 
and I will remain committed to that. 
After a lifetime dedicated to pro-life 
work, there is no question it is just the 
right thing to do. You always err on 
the side of life. You always give life a 
chance. 
This rule also includes consideration 
of the National Defense Authorization 
Act. Yesterday, in the Rules Com-
mittee, there were a lot of amendments 
submitted. There are a lot of amend-
ments we are going to debate on the 
floor. Most of them were amendments 
submitted by Democrats. Republicans 
got very few of those. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentleman has expired. 
Mr. COLE. Madam Speaker, I yield 
an additional 1 minute to the gen-
tleman from Texas. 
Mr. BURGESS. I submitted amend-
ments to require reports to Congress 
on our military response in Ukraine 
and the chaotic withdrawal from Af-
ghanistan last August, something that 
we cannot allow to be repeated. 
Russia invaded Ukraine in February, 
yet we have not had another briefing 
by the generals and State Department 
as we did prior to that invasion. The 
situation is vastly different on the 
ground. We were given to understand 
that it would not take long for Russia 
to completely overrun Ukraine. They 
didn’t anticipate the response of the 
Ukrainian people. Now, we see a war of 
attrition evolving, but Congress is not 
read into any of the administration’s 
plans. 
Then, finally, we have to ensure that 
the chaotic withdrawal from Afghani-
stan is fully investigated and under-
stood. What advice was the President 
receiving? From whom did he receive 
it? How do we prevent that from ever 
happening again? 
I thank the gentleman for yielding 
me additional time. 
b 1130 
Mr. MORELLE. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. I appreciate the comments from 
my distinguished colleague on the 
Rules Committee, Mr. BURGESS. But 
what he points out, in my mind, re-
minds me how deeply personal this de-
cision is for women involving their 
body and their healthcare. 
I would certainly never question his 
credentials as a doctor or as a profes-
sional, but I have heard from a number 
of obstetricians and gynecologists who 
raise, I think, what are really impor-
tant questions. 
For instance, in some States, the 
health of the mother is the only con-
sideration to be given when it comes to 
an abortion or reproductive services. 
Some have raised the question: How 
long do you wait before you can make 
the judgment that that is the only de-
termination that can be made? If you 
wait too long, do you actually jeop-
ardize the health of the mother by 
waiting so long for fear of violating a 
State law that restricts the right of a 
woman to an abortion? 
Then there is the question of mis-
carriages. Many, many women have 
miscarriages. And concerns have been 
expressed by their doctors of when we 
provide care after the fact or during a 
miscarriage, will there be questions 
raised about whether or not that was 
actually an abortion instead of a mis-
carriage? Will we be jeopardizing our 
careers? Will we be putting our profes-
sional license into question? 
These are very difficult questions to 
answer. I am certainly no expert in 
them, but they raise, to me, significant 
questions. 
As many have pointed out, there will 
be abortions in the United States. 
There will be abortions in Texas. There 
will be abortions in Mississippi. There 
will be abortions in every State in this 
country. 
The question is: Are they going to be 
safe? Are women going to suffer un-
duly? Are there going to be deaths of 
women because they weren’t given ac-
cess to safe, reproductive care that is 
ultimately, as I said, so deeply per-
sonal, so deeply involved in their au-
tonomy? 
Those are the questions before us. 
They are deep-seated questions. They 
are important questions. But, ulti-
mately, we side with the right of a 
woman to make the decision for her-
self. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. COLE. Madam Speaker, I yield 3 
minutes to the gentlewoman from 
Oklahoma (Mrs. BICE), my very good 
friend and a member of the House 
Armed Services Committee. 
Mrs. BICE of Oklahoma. Madam 
Speaker, I thank my friend and col-
league for yielding. 
I rise in opposition to the combined 
rule, although I support the underlying 
NDAA. This year’s NDAA makes tar-
geted investments in our defense to 
protect us from increasingly aggressive 
adversaries like China and Russia. 
I was pleased to include a wide range 
of priorities for my home State of 
Oklahoma, and multiple amendments 
focused on supporting servicemembers, 
strengthening our cybersecurity pos-
ture, and deterring our enemies. 
Many Oklahomans were concerned 
when President Biden announced his 
intent to divest half of the E–3 AWACS 
fleet at Tinker Air Force Base. I 
worked on this issue for months and se-
cured an amendment to slow the di-
vestment and to retain the training 
pipeline that will be needed as we tran-
sition to the new E–7. 
I was also proud to work with my col-
league and friend, TOM COLE, to secure 
$30 million for the new B–21 depot 
maintenance campus at Tinker Air 
Force Base. 
The NDAA also includes two bills I 
introduced: H.R. 7738 which would fa-
cilitate 
greater 
security 
clearance 
portability for departing servicemem-
bers, and H. Res. 1143 which honors the 
USS Oklahoma City for three decades of 
service. 
With that said, I am concerned that 
the combined rule has excluded many 
important amendments that deserve to 
be debated. This includes an amend-
ment I offered to stop the Department 
of Defense from recouping bonuses to 
servicemembers based on their COVID– 
19 vaccination status. I have heard 
about this issue from my constituents, 
and this practice must be stopped. 
Lastly, this combined rule provides 
for two abortion measures which I 
strongly oppose. I am deeply concerned 
that these measures would remove all 
pro-life protections at the Federal and 
State level. Constituents in my home 
State of Oklahoma overwhelmingly 
support these protections, and as a 
former State legislator myself, I find 
this approach to be unacceptable. 
Madam Speaker, for these reasons, I 
urge my colleagues to reject the com-
bined rule. 
Mr. MORELLE. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, I want to talk about 
another important piece embodied in 
the rule, and it is related to the ques-
tion of alerts and the Active Shooter 
Alert Act.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5990 
July 13, 2022 
It is no secret our country is plagued 
by gun violence. This year alone, the 
Gun Violence Archive counted at least 
323 mass shootings. It is hard to even 
process that—323 mass shootings in the 
United States. We are just halfway 
through the year. 
On May 14, ten Black Americans were 
targeted in a racially motivated mass 
shooting at a local Tops grocery store 
60 minutes from my home in Buffalo, 
New York. 
Ten days later, the deadliest shoot-
ing since Sandy Hook took place in 
Uvalde, Texas, where 19 kids and 2 
teachers were gunned down at Robb El-
ementary School. 
Just a week ago, on July 4 in High-
land Park, Illinois, seven people at a 
4th of July parade were killed by a 
gunman during a mass shooting inci-
dent. Hard to imagine. So many of us 
were at parades and activities just like 
that in our hometowns. Seven people 
dead. 
I have made my position and others 
have made their position very clear on 
gun reform, that meaningful, common-
sense reform is an absolute necessity. I 
am committed to fighting for the 
change that will provide real change 
and save real lives, big changes. 
But, in the meantime, I think this 
demonstrates our willingness to find 
common ground on solutions. Again, 
the Active Shooter Alert Act is bipar-
tisan. It is something we should all be 
able to get behind on voting ‘‘yes.’’ 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. COLE. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Madam Speaker, I thank my friend 
for the time, and frankly, for the 
thoughtful and wide-ranging debate. It 
is not a surprise that a rule that covers 
five very different pieces of legislation 
would provoke that kind of discussion. 
I want to begin in the areas we agree. 
There are actually three areas in this 
bill that I will be voting for. Most im-
portantly, quite frankly, is the Na-
tional Defense Authorization Act. 
There is going to be some opposition 
to that. It was a give-and-take bill, but 
I remind my colleagues on both sides of 
the aisle that it actually came out of 
committee on a 57 to 1 vote; 57 to 1. 
That says a lot of wonderful things 
about 
the 
leadership 
of 
Chairman 
SMITH and Ranking Member ROGERS on 
that committee and its ability, after 
considering over 600 or 700 amendments 
itself, to find common ground and 
move forward. 
For my colleagues that vote no, that 
is fine. Again, there is always some-
thing in a bill this size you can find to 
disagree with, but I will remind my 
friends on my side of the aisle that 
every single Republican on the com-
mittee voted for the bill. So I think it 
is going to pass and pass quite easily. 
I also want to associate myself with 
my friend’s support of the toxic burn 
pit bill. It is a bill that I have some se-
rious problems with, such as the man-
ner in which it was funded and some of 
the procedures by which it moved, but 
it is a much better bill than we have 
seen before. It is a step in the right di-
rection. 
There is no question my friend is cor-
rect when he talks about our obliga-
tion as a Congress to look after the 
men and women who have put their 
lives on the line for us and suffered 
egregious harm. 
I hope we can do better in the future. 
I hope we can even revisit some of the 
financing measures here, but it is im-
portant that it get done and that it 
passes, and I look forward to working 
with my friend to do that. 
I agree with him on the AMBER 
Alert bill as well, and I will be sup-
porting it. There are some concerns on 
my side of the aisle about that, and I 
understand those concerns. Again, I 
think this is a commonsense measure. 
The area that I will not be able to 
join my friend on does deal with the 
fundamental protection of human life 
and the effort of this body to pass leg-
islation that it knows will go nowhere 
in the Senate simply to make a point. 
We ought to be working to find com-
mon ground, not to dig down the divi-
sions that we have even more deeply. 
So I will oppose the rule partly because 
I oppose some of the measures in the 
rule; also, because I certainly would 
like the previous question to be consid-
ered. 
I thought both of my friends from 
North and South Dakota made some 
excellent points on the need to codify 
the number nine or at least have a dis-
cussion about that in this body, and ob-
viously, if we defeat the previous ques-
tion, we intend to do that. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to vote ‘‘no’’ on the previous 
question, ‘‘no’’ on the rule, and I yield 
back the balance of my time. 
Mr. MORELLE. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, I begin by thanking 
the 
distinguished 
gentleman 
from 
Oklahoma. We have the great privilege 
of serving together on the Rules Com-
mittee. We spend many hours together, 
and I almost always—almost always— 
find myself in agreement with him. 
He is thoughtful. He is dedicated to 
this institution, committed to the im-
portant principles of our democracy 
and the Constitution, and I consider it 
a privilege to be able to serve with him 
and to learn from him, and I appreciate 
his thoughtfulness in this debate as 
well. 
I also thank my colleagues for their 
words in support of the rule before us 
today. A vote in favor of the rule 
today, in my view, says volumes about 
what we value. Support for this rule 
shows we value our servicemembers 
who put their lives on the line for this 
country each and every day. When they 
come home, we will be here to take 
care of them. 
A ‘‘yes’’ vote shows we value our de-
fense preparedness and ensures our Na-
tion is ready to face the very real and 
serious global challenges threatening 
our security. It also demonstrates a 
willingness to do the bare minimum to 
address gun violence by ensuring our 
communities can effectively be able to 
alert people when an active shooter is 
in the area. 
Last, but certainly not least, a vote 
in favor tells women in this country 
that we value and respect them. We 
support their right to manage their 
own healthcare. 
My colleagues on the other side of 
the aisle can attempt to misdirect and 
confuse the issues at hand all they 
want, but the reality is we are pre-
senting concrete proposals to address 
real issues facing our Nation when it 
comes to national defense, and I appre-
ciate the bipartisan support for that, 
the NDAA, gun reform, women’s rights, 
support for veterans. I choose to be on 
the right side of history on these 
issues. I am voting ‘‘yes.’’ 
Madam Speaker, I urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote 
on the rule and the previous question. 
The material previously referred to 
by Mr. COLE is as follows: 
AMENDMENT TO HOUSE RESOLUTION 1224 
At the end of the resolution, add the fol-
lowing: 
SEC. 11. Immediately upon adoption of this 
resolution, the House shall proceed to the 
consideration in the House of the joint reso-
lution (H.J. Res. 11) proposing an amend-
ment to the Constitution of the United 
States to require that the Supreme Court of 
the United States be composed of nine jus-
tices. All points of order against consider-
ation of the joint resolution are waived. The 
joint resolution shall be considered as read. 
All points of order against provisions in the 
joint resolution are waived. The previous 
question shall be considered as ordered on 
the joint resolution and on any amendment 
thereto to final passage without intervening 
motion except: (1) one hour of debate equally 
divided and controlled by the chair and rank-
ing minority member of the Committee on 
the Judiciary; and (2) one motion to recom-
mit. 
SEC. 12. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not 
apply to the consideration of House Joint 
Resolution 11. 
Mr. MORELLE. Madam Speaker, I 
yield back the balance of my time, and 
I move the previous question on the 
resolution. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on ordering the previous 
question. 
The question was taken; and the 
Speaker pro tempore announced that 
the ayes appeared to have it. 
Mr. COLE. Madam Speaker, on that I 
demand the yeas and nays. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to section 3(s) of House Resolution 
8, the yeas and nays are ordered. 
Pursuant to clause 9 of rule XX, the 
Chair will reduce to 5 minutes the min-
imum time for any electronic vote on 
the question of adoption of the resolu-
tion. 
The vote was taken by electronic de-
vice, and there were—yeas 218, nays 
208, not voting 4, as follows:

The SPEAKER pro tempore (Ms. 
BOURDEAUX). The question is on the 
resolution. 
The question was taken; and the 
Speaker pro tempore announced that 
the ayes appeared to have it. 
Mr. COLE. Madam Speaker, on that I 
demand the yeas and nays. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to section 3(s) of House Resolution 
8, the yeas and nays are ordered. 
Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, fur-
ther proceedings on this question are 
postponed. 
(By unanimous consent, Mr. HOYER 
was allowed to speak out of order.) 
REGARDING TIME FOR VOTING 
Mr. HOYER. Madam Speaker, this is 
going to be a very busy week. There 
are over 600 amendments made in order 
to the defense bill. 
Clearly, if we do what we just did, 
and we do it too often—take three 
times the time allotted to vote; this 
took about 47 minutes, 48 minutes to 
vote in the first vote—we will be here 
for a very long time. No one wants to 
shirk their duties, but they do want to 
do their duties on time. 
I want to make it clear to the House 
that I have asked the leadership, the 
Speaker’s Office, to join with me in en-
suring that 5-minute votes are 5- 
minute votes. 
My colleagues, invariably, that an-
nouncement brings cheers, and invari-
ably, those cheers come after 10, 15, 20 
minutes have elapsed on a 5-minute 
vote—not all of us, but some of us, and 
many of us sometimes. 
In consideration of our colleagues on 
both sides of the aisle, some of you are 
going to be angry because you are 
going to miss a 5-minute vote. 
Now, for those of you who are casting 
proxies, I ask you to cast them imme-
diately upon the vote opening so that 
we can process the proxies at the desk. 
Yelling at one another doesn’t help 
trying to bring some self-respect to 
this institution. Each of us has to take 
personal responsibility to do our job, 
which is to put our card in the voting 
machine, to put our proxies in, to move 
along. 
I ask all of us to respect that because 
I am going to try, to the extent hu-
manly possible, to end votes at 5 min-
utes. Some of you are going to be 
upset. You are going to walk down the 
aisle. 
Mr. MCCARTHY. Will the gentleman 
yield? 
Mr. HOYER. I yield to the gentleman 
from California. 
Mr. MCCARTHY. Madam Speaker, I 
appreciate the gentleman yielding. I 
would like to speed this up, and with 
all due respect, not to yell anything 
else, but if we did eliminate proxies, we 
could go to 2-minute votes. 
Now, with all due respect, the proxies 
were put in because of the pandemic. It 
was put in during the pandemic. You 
no longer have that from any proce-
dure here. The proxies will take longer 
than 5 minutes. If we want to be able 
to—— 
Mr. 
HOYER. 
Ladies 
and 
gentle-
men—— 
Mr. MCCARTHY. Madam Speaker, I 
thought the gentleman said yelling at 
one another doesn’t help. 
Mr. HOYER. Madam Speaker, re-
claiming my time, I just admonished 
some people.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5992 
July 13, 2022 
This is a serious issue of how the 
House operates and how your time is 
respected. We have proxies. We are 
going to keep proxies. We can debate 
that, but the fact of the matter is, as 
long as we have proxies, we are going 
to have to take into consideration 
proxies. 
But we don’t have to simply waste 
time by people not showing up, proxy 
or not. That is my whole point, so that 
we can respect one another’s time, re-
spect the work of this institution, re-
spect the work of our committees. 
b 1230 
I would urge—and I will yield again— 
I would urge us to respect one another, 
respect our time, and respect the con-
straints of voting within a timeframe, 
whether it is 15 minutes or 5 minutes. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman from California (Mr. MCCAR-
THY). 
Mr. MCCARTHY. Madam Speaker, if 
we look in the Chamber right now, we 
have a large number of people here, not 
one person wearing a mask—all right, 
three or four—and you can continue to 
wear your mask to vote in person. I 
don’t see how you are going to do a 5- 
minute vote with proxies. 
I understand the lecture you are giv-
ing to everybody, but on this side of 
the aisle we will be here, we will vote, 
and we would gladly like to do it the 
same way every other Congress has 
done it in history, to be here and do 
the job like we expect the American 
people to do. And we won’t break until 
the proxies are done. 
Mr. 
HOYER. 
Let 
me 
conclude, 
Madam Speaker, by urging everybody 
to stay on the floor. What we are see-
ing happen many times is somebody 
votes, they are registered, and then 
when you go to the next vote they are 
10 minutes, 15 minutes late. That is not 
what we ought to be doing. 
We are going to hew to the time lim-
its as closely as humanly possible with-
in the constraints of our clerks who are 
working very, very hard to accommo-
date us. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.

The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr.

the Active Shooter Alert Communications Net-
work, an interconnected system of Federal, 
State, Tribal, and local governments that is or-
ganized to provide information to the public, 
within geographically relevant areas, on active 
shooter situations. 
(6) POPULATED AREA.—The term ‘‘populated 
area’’ means a location where one or more per-

SEC. 3. NATIONAL COORDINATION OF ACTIVE 
SHOOTER ALERT COMMUNICATIONS 
NETWORK. 
(a) COORDINATION WITHIN DEPARTMENT
OF 
JUSTICE.—The Attorney General shall assign an 
officer of the Department of Justice to act as the 
national coordinator of the Active Shooter Alert 
Communications Network regarding an emer-
gency involving an active shooter. The officer so 
designated shall be known as the Active Shooter 
Alert Coordinator of the Department of Justice. 
(b) DUTIES.—The Coordinator shall— 
(1) encourage Federal, State, Tribal, and local 
government agencies to establish procedures to 
respond to an active shooter, including active 
shooter procedures relating to interstate or 
interjurisdictional travel (including airports and 
border crossing areas and checkpoints), and 
focus on governments that have not yet estab-
lished such procedures; and 
(2) work with State, Tribal, and local govern-
ments to encourage appropriate regional and 
interjurisdictional coordination of various ele-
ments of the Network. 
(c) GOALS.—The Coordinator shall encourage 
the adoption of best practices established under 
section 4(a) in State, Tribal, and local govern-
ments for— 
(1) the development of policies and procedures 
to guide the use of mass alert systems, change-
able message signs, or other information systems 
to notify local residents, motorists, travelers, 
and individuals in the vicinity of an active 
shooter; 
(2) the development of guidance or policies on 
the content and format of alert messages to be 
conveyed on mass alert systems, changeable 
message signs, or other information systems re-
lating to an active shooter; 
(3) the coordination of State, Tribal, and local 
Active Shooter Alert communications plans 
within a region for the use of mass alert systems 
relating to an active shooter; 
(4) the planning and designing of mass alert 
systems for multilingual communication with 
local residents, motorists, travelers, and individ-
uals in the vicinity of an active shooter, which 
system may include the capability for issuing 
wide area alerts to local residents, motorists, 
travelers, and individuals in the vicinity of an 
active shooter; 
(5) the planning of systems and protocols to

propriate use of mass alert systems and other in-
formation systems for the notification of local 
residents, motorists, travelers, and individuals 
in the vicinity of an active shooter; and 
(7) the development of appropriate mass alert 
systems to ensure that alerts sent to individuals 
in the immediate vicinity of an active shooter do 
not alert the active shooter to the location of in-
dividuals sheltering in place near the active 
shooter. 
(d) INTEGRATED PUBLIC ALERT AND WARNING 
SYSTEM.—In carrying out duties under sub-
section (b), the Coordinator shall notify and co-
ordinate with the Administrator of FEMA, the 
Secretary of Transportation, and the Chairman 
of the FCC on using the Integrated Public Alert

ber of the Committee on the Judiciary 
or their respective designees. 
The gentleman from New York (Mr. 
NADLER) and the gentleman from Ohio 
(Mr. JORDAN) each will control 30 min-
utes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from New York (Mr. NADLER). 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days in which to 
revise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on H.R. 6538. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from New York? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, H.R. 6538, the Active 
Shooter Alert Act, is bipartisan legis-
lation that would improve the tools 
available to law enforcement as they 
respond to the disturbingly frequent 
threat of active shooters faced by our 
communities. 
Far too many of our cities have expe-
rienced the threat of an active shooter 
situation. Since we last voted on this 
very bill—only a few weeks ago—High-
land Park became the most recent city 
to face the terror of a mass shooting, 
following Buffalo, Uvalde, and so many 
others. 
In 2021, the FBI designated 61 situa-
tions as active shooter incidents, a 
more than 50 percent increase com-
pared to 2020, and nearly double the 
number of such incidents just 4 years 
ago. 
These incidents require law enforce-
ment to make challenging decisions 
about how best to keep the public safe, 
including when and how to inform the 
public as a situation unfolds. FEMA, 
the FCC, and wireless providers already 
have a system in place to send time- 
sensitive, location-targeted alerts for 
weather emergencies, AMBER Alerts 
for child abduction cases, and other 
public safety emergencies. 
This bill simply enables law enforce-
ment to use this system for active 
shooter alerts, giving them an addi-
tional tool to save lives. It is bipar-
tisan legislation and should be com-
pletely uncontroversial. 
Indeed, our colleagues overwhelm-
ingly supported this legislation when 
we last voted on it, but the opposition 
of a few Members prevented it from 
garnering the two-thirds support it 
needed to pass under suspension of the 
rules. Those Members in opposition 
have made absurd claims about the 
bill—instead of examining what it ac-
tually does—but we won’t take the 
bait. 
Instead, we are listening to our law 
enforcement and first responders who 
have called for this legislation. Today, 
we are taking action to save lives when 
tragedy strikes. We will continue to do 
much more to actually prevent these 
tragedies, but the least we can do is to 
improve the tools we give law enforce-
ment to respond to a crisis. That is 
what this bill does. 
H.R. 6538, the Active Shooter Alert 
Act, directs the attorney general to ap-
point a coordinator to work with Fed-
eral, State, local, and Tribal Govern-
ments to better use our existing emer-
gency alert system for active shooter 
situations. 
It directs the coordinator to estab-
lish an advisory panel, comprised of 
law enforcement officers who have re-
sponded to active shooter incidents, 
along with other public safety and 
emergency response experts. 
b 1245 
The coordinator is also directed to 
establish best practices for using emer-
gency alerts for active shooter inci-
dents, to promote the adoption of those 
best practices, and to report to Con-
gress on the effectiveness of these 
alerts. This bipartisan legislation is en-
dorsed by a broad range of Federal, 
State, and local law enforcement orga-
nizations. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank Congressman 
CICILLINE for his work in developing 
this important legislation, I hope my 
colleagues will join me in supporting it 
once again, and I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. JORDAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, we debated this exact 
bill 3 weeks ago, and it failed with bi-
partisan opposition. That is right. 
Even Democrats voted against it. 
The Active Shooter Alert Act is an 
unnecessary gimmick to cede more au-
thority to the already highly politi-
cized Biden Department of Justice. 
States 
already 
utilize 
emergency 
alert systems to warn the public about 
natural and human-made disasters, ex-
treme weather events, active shooter 
situations, and other emergencies. Fed-
eral, State, and local officials already 
use the Integrated Public Alert and 
Warning 
System, 
IPAWS, 
to 
send 
emergency alerts to mobile devices and 
to alert media platforms. 
According to a 2020 report from the 
Government 
Accountability 
Office, 
every State has at least one alerting 
authority, and there were more than 
1,400 alerting authorities across the 
country. 
If the States are already using an 
alerting system to notify the public 
about threats, what is this bill really 
doing? 
This bill is creating a new Federal 
job at the Biden Justice Department to 
encourage State and local governments 
to issue public alerts any time a fire-
arm is used anywhere. Don’t take my 
word for it. During the markup, Con-
gressman JONES
said that this bill 
would be most effective at reminding 
us that the threat of gun violence ex-
ists all around us, but it does little to 
actually protect us from it. 
That is right. This bill is about Dem-
ocrat fearmongering that guns are an 
ever-present threat and we cannot be 
safe until Big Government rounds up 
every last one of them. 
In fact, Congressman JONES went fur-
ther, calling the committee to consider 
another bill that would ban assault 
weapons. Chairman NADLER
followed 
by voicing his support. 
It is no wonder Democrats want to 
push forward a bill that would create a 
reminder about this threat of gun vio-
lence against us. They want to create a 
culture of fear so they can achieve 
their ultimate goal. If they really

wanted to improve emergency alerts 
for active shooters, we would be mov-
ing a bill to improve the system that is 
already in place that are sent to mobile 
devices. 
In a recent report, GAO stated that 
the local alerting officials had ex-
pressed concerns about the inability to 
target WEA alerts with accuracy which 
made local officials reluctant to use 
the system at all. 
For example, GAO found that one 
alerting authority sent an alert to a 
specific geographic area to warn the re-
cipients about a suspicious package, 
but the alert was received by people lo-
cated 4 miles outside of the intended 
target area. 
Another concern is that these alerts 
are one-way communication systems so 
alerting officials have no way of know-
ing if the messages are actually re-
ceived by the public. GAO has also 
found that another local alerting au-
thority 
sent 
an 
evacuation 
order 
through an alert but didn’t know 
whether the intended recipients actu-
ally even received that notice. 
Utilizing 
these 
alerts 
for 
active 
shooter incidents could have tragic 
consequences. This is yet another rea-
son this legislation should not have 
been rushed to the floor without going 
through regular committee order. We 
could have had hearings, we could have 
received expert testimony, and we 
could have been able to fully vet this 
initiative. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 
minutes to the gentleman from Rhode 
Island (Mr. CICILLINE), who is a member 
of the Judiciary Committee and spon-
sor of the bill. 
Mr. CICILLINE. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman for yielding. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong 
support of this bill that I introduced 
with my colleague from Michigan (Mr. 
UPTON), the bipartisan Active Shooter 
Alert Act that we introduced along 
with 14 Democrats and 14 Repub-
licans—fully bipartisan. 
This bill is a commonsense piece of 
public safety legislation that police 
have asked for over and over and over 
again and that we are past due in deliv-
ering to them. It is so clear that they 
need it. 
Between 2000 and 2020 there were 
close to 400 active shooter events with 
40 active shooter incidents in 2020 
alone. Last year we saw 61 active 
shooter events. 
We see what this looks like in our 
communities. This past April a shooter 
gunned down 10 people in a New York 
City subway and then was on the run 
for 29 hours. On July 4 another shooter 
gunned down parade goers in Highland 
Park, Illinois, and evaded arrest for 8 
hours. Those are just two examples of 
the most recent ones. 
This doesn’t even include the shoot-
ers who were at large for hours and 
hours in Midland and Odessa in 2019 
and the Atlanta, Georgia, area in 2021; 
Kalamazoo, Michigan, in 2016; and in 
too many other life-and-death situa-
tions for our communities. 
Active shooter emergencies have be-
come so common that we barely even 
register them anymore. We have be-
come numb to them and starting to 
view them as statistics. We cannot let 
this become normal. And law enforce-
ment can’t and won’t get used to these 
horrific incidents because police are 
the ones who have to respond to every 
single shooting. We left them to turn 
to 
platforms 
like 
Twitter 
and 
Facebook to let the public know there 
is a shooter out there. 
That is why law enforcement organi-
zations from all across the country are 
asking for this bill. 
Enough is enough. 
We want to talk about supporting 
our law enforcement? 
Give them what they ask for. 
Stop acting like you are experts 
about responding to active shooting. 
They are. They risk their lives every 
day doing it. 
This bill creates and makes available 
to local law enforcement an AMBER 
Alert-like program for active shooter 
events. It will provide departments 
with cutting-edge technology to send 
notifications to our smartphones and 
let communities know if there is an ac-
tive shooter in a certain area. 
In addition to this system, the bill 
calls for the development of best prac-
tices so that departments know how to 
send alerts in the most effective and 
safest way possible. 
We already have this type of alert in-
frastructure available at the Federal 
level. Let’s maximize its potential to 
save lives and give officers the tools 
they need to keep their communities 
safe. 
Developing this kind of technology 
and infrastructure and identifying best 
practices would be a massive under-
taking for many local departments and 
for some communities. They simply 
don’t have the resources to do it on 
their own. 
And nothing—let me repeat—nothing 
in this bill is mandatory for law en-
forcement agencies to adopt. So if a 
local department determines that this 
program isn’t a good fit for their com-
munity, they simply don’t have to use 
it. But for the officers out there who do 
want it, let’s deliver to them. 
We have to give law enforcement 
every tool they need to neutralize 
these threats and keep our commu-
nities safe. This bill helps do that in a 
simple and effective way. It is not com-
plicated. It simply adds a tool to the 
tool belt of law enforcement all across 
the country regardless of their size or 
location to be used voluntarily. 
When there is an active shooter situ-
ation, law enforcement does all they 
can to keep people in the surrounding 
area safe. They organize to search for 
shooters posing the threat, they shut 
down streets and buildings and provide 
first response to victims, and they go 
door to door to either evacuate or tell 
people to shelter in place. But that 
takes time—time that could cost lives. 
In these stressful life-or-death situa-
tions, law enforcement are too often 
relying on social media to warn people 
so that no one accidentally walks into 
the line of fire or a crime scene. Law 
enforcement deserves better than Twit-
ter to communicate with the commu-
nity they serve. 
I am proud this bill has the endorse-
ment of law enforcement agencies all 
across the country, including the Fra-
ternal Order of Police, the National Po-
lice Foundation, the National Sheriffs’ 
Association, the Major Cities Chiefs 
Association, the National Association 
of Police Officers, and the National As-
sociation of District Attorneys, just to 
name a few. 
There has been resounding bipartisan 
support. I thank all of my colleagues 
on both sides of the aisle who have sup-
ported this commonsense measure. I 
thank, again, my friend and colleague, 
Mr. UPTON, for working on this bill. I 
encourage all of you to give law en-
forcement the tools they need to keep 
themselves and communities safe. 
Do not listen to this nonsense about 
trying to take peoples’ guns or give the 
Biden Justice Department money. It 
has nothing to do with that. It is about 
alerting people when there is a dan-
gerous active shooting happening in 
their community so we can save peo-
ples’ lives. It is plain and simple. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman 
for his leadership. 
Mr. JORDAN. Mr. Speaker, I would 
just add that the gentleman said it has 
nothing to do with the Biden Justice 
Department. Well, it certainly does. It 
gives $2 million to the Biden Justice 
Department to create a program the 
States can already do. This is the same 
Biden Justice Department that is the 
most political Justice Department we 
have ever seen. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the 
gentleman from the great State of 
Florida (Mr. GAETZ). 
Mr. GAETZ. Mr. Speaker, maybe 
someone should have sent an active 
shooter alert to police in Uvalde. Wait. 
They had the alert. They were in a 
school building with an active shooter 
and didn’t take action. 
America is at her best when she en-
courages her citizens to have safe, re-
sponsible gun ownership. But under 
Democrats, instead, we have a govern-
ment that instead wants to stigmatize 
and scare people about guns. 
Mr. Speaker, imagine you are at a 
concert with 5,000 people and everyone 
gets an alert on their phone ‘‘active 
shooter’’ because six blocks away there 
was a gunfire that went off. Maybe it 
was an accident. Maybe it was a trag-
edy. 
Would that make the circumstance 
safer? 
Of course not. It would lead to stam-
pede, tragedy, hysteria, mistake, per-
haps even more death. This bill is like 
yelling ‘‘fire’’ in a movie theater, ex-
cept the fire is in another movie the-
ater across the street. The bill makes 
no mention of distance requirements.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5996 
July 13, 2022 
Will we be notified of any active 
shootings within 1 mile, 5 miles, 10 
miles? 
What is an active shooter? 
A drive-by in an inner city? 
A spousal murder in a suburb? 
If you live in or near Democrat-run 
cities, it sounds like your phone will be 
buzzing off the hook. Some of our cities 
have shootings every day where mul-
tiple people are injured, and often this 
happens in the jurisdictions with the 
most intense and liberty-depriving gun 
control. 
The bill states that an active shooter 
is defined as an individual ‘‘determined 
to pose an active, imminent threat to 
people in a populated area.’’ That 
sounds like a sizable amount of the 
people walking around the south side 
of Chicago every day. 
Who is making this determination? 
Is it in a millisecond? 
By the time the alerts go out, it may 
be far too late to do any good. This bill 
is useless and foolish. Working on po-
lice response times is, of course, a wor-
thy goal, a worthy goal for the States 
where the Constitution resides the po-
lice power. But alerting thousands of 
people to what may or may not have 
happened 30 minutes ago or 30 blocks 
away is, in fact, dangerous. 
So one has to ask: What is the true 
purpose of this bill? 
Why do the Democrats want to use 
the power of government to bombard 
your cellphone with active shooter 
alerts 24 hours a day, 7 days a week? 
It is because they want you to be 
afraid of the Second Amendment. It is 
because they want you to be afraid of 
responsible gun ownership. They hope 
that if they program you and bombard 
you long enough, that you will hate 
your own Second Amendment rights, 
or you may tattle on your neighbor 
who is lawfully and rightfully exer-
cising theirs. The American people 
should not fall for this. 
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, first of 
all, let me say that if the theater 
across street were on fire, I would like 
to know about it. Fires spread. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the 
distinguished gentlewoman from Texas 
(Ms. JACKSON LEE), who is a member of 
the Judiciary Committee. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, let 
me thank the chair very much for 
yielding. 
Let me acknowledge both my good 
friend, Mr. CICILLINE, and my good 
friend, Mr. UPTON, for their thoughtful-
ness. 
Let me provide a response and relief 
to my good friend from Florida. First 
of all, I champion the heroes who run 
into burning buildings, law enforce-
ment that save persons who are under 
attack, and the outstanding heroes of 
natural disasters and manmade disas-
ters. They are valuable. 
But I do want to answer the question 
that we have seen, i.e., Uvalde a lot of 
good guys with guns and nothing hap-
pened. And so this active shooter legis-
lation is common sense. Let me dispel 
your fears. There is modern-day tech-
nology that experts run by FEMA 
under the DOJ will, in fact, be able in 
this active shooter legislation pinpoint 
where the active shooter may be. 
I have here a list of shootings that 
have gone on in Uvalde; Buffalo; Boul-
der, Colorado; Atlanta; Dayton; El 
Paso; Virginia Beach; Thousand Oaks; 
Pittsburgh; Parkland; Sutherland; Las 
Vegas; Orlando; Oregon; Rosenberg; 
and Oak Creek. 
I can assure you that the active 
shooter legislation would have been 
effective. 
b 1300 
Individuals had gotten the guns le-
gally, allegedly, but no one gave notice 
to those people that a shooting was 
going on. 
In recent weeks and months and 
years, we have mourned the loss of life 
resulting from an ever-increasing num-
ber of active shooters. Communities in 
every corner of this country are suf-
fering. 
For 
instance, 
eight 
people 
were 
killed roughly 30 miles apart in three 
spas. No active shooter alert. If that 
had been done, someone could have 
been prepared that an active shooter 
that had a propensity to go into spas 
was killing people. He ran around cre-
ating havoc. 
We know what happened in Uvalde, 
Texas—no notice that there was havoc 
going on in Robb Elementary School. 
Tell that to the parents. 
Highland Park, Illinois, a Fourth of 
July parade ended abruptly as the 
shooting came. If we had had that, 
there might have been relief. 
Please realize that we are here trying 
to save lives. In saving lives, yes, we 
want a ban on the assault weapons, but 
we would hope that you would join us 
on a bipartisan bill that will simply no-
tify people what is happening, not deny 
them their due process rights. 
H.R. 6538 is an important bill that 
would authorize the Department of 
Justice to coordinate an active shooter 
alert network. We will be listening to 
law enforcement and those with tech-
nology to ensure that the system 
works. 
AMBER Alerts, for those of us in dis-
aster territory and storm territory, 
work. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentlewoman has expired. 
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield an 
additional 30 seconds to the gentle-
woman from Texas. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I 
will not leave the floor without trying 
my best to give the names from 
Uvalde: 
Makenna, 
Layla, 
Maranda, 
Nevaeh, Jose, Xavier, Tess, Rojelio, 
Eliahna, Eliahna, Annabell, Jackie, 
Uziyah, Jayce, Maite, Jailah, Irma, 
Eva, Amerie, Alexandria, and Alithia; 
and those of this great community of 
Buffalo: 
Roberta, 
Margus, 
Andre, 
Aaron, Geraldine, Celestine, Heyward, 
Katherine, Pearl, and Ruth. These are 
people who have died. Highland will 
have their list of names added to this. 
Support 
the 
AMBER 
Alert 
that 
makes the difference in an active 
shooting so that even though there are 
good guys out there, you can tell the 
people to save their lives. For the little 
2-year-old that we will hear about 
soon, support the legislation. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 6538, 
the ‘‘Active Shooter Alert Act of 2022.’’ 
In recent weeks, months, and years, we 
have mourned the loss of life resulting from an 
ever-increasing number of active shooter inci-
dents where perpetrators committed mass 
shootings in multiple locations. 
Communities in every corner of this country 
have been subjected to the fear and uncer-
tainty created by active shooters in their midst. 
Last year, there were 61 active shooter inci-
dents in the United States. Approximately 27 
of those incidents involved an active shooter 
moving from one location to another. 
For instance, 8 people were killed roughly 
30 miles apart at three spas in the metro At-
lanta area last year. The gunman was later 
apprehended some 150 miles south of Atlanta. 
In May this year, as we all know, 19 fourth 
graders and two teachers in Uvalde, Texas 
were slaughtered in a mass shooting that 
began when the perpetrator shot his grand-
mother in the home they shared, drove away, 
and crashed his vehicle outside Robb Elemen-
tary, where he entered and committed un-
speakable acts. 
And just a week ago in Highland Park, Illi-
nois, a Fourth of July parade ended abruptly 
when a shooter opened fire on spectators, 
then fled the scene, prompting a citywide 
search. 
While the actions of these individuals and 
other active shooters are unacceptable and re-
quire Congress to enact measures to put an 
end to such evil acts, we must also be pre-
pared if these situations occur, and do all we 
can to help law enforcement save more lives. 
Law enforcement’s response to an active 
shooter is a dynamic situation—oftentimes 
chaotic—that involves many variables, re-
quires swift, consequential decision-making, 
and places great strain on law enforcement 
command staff and their officers on the 
ground. 
Their goal is to save the lives of victims and 
prevent others from unknowingly entering the 
area or walking into the line of fire—at all 
times focusing on containing, neutralizing, and 
apprehending the shooter. 
We all saw the video of the band members 
in Highland Park who continued to march 
along the parade route as shots rang out 
above their heads. We saw the confused 
looks on the faces of the spectators as they 
tried to determine if the loud bangs were gun-
shots or fireworks. 
An Active Shooter Alert could have helped 
those people fully ascertain the danger they 
were in and get to safety faster. An Alert might 
have saved the life of the woman who un-
knowingly walked directly into the line of fire of 
the Buffalo Shooter in the Tops parking lot. 
Centers of higher learning and primary edu-
cation, businesses, local jurisdictions, and law 
enforcement agencies have already imple-
mented some systems to alert students, em-
ployees, patrons, and community members of 
the presence of an active shooter, and to help 
manage the response, and provide updates 
about the ongoing crisis via text message and/ 
or social media.

Many of these systems face low enrollment 
and messaging delays that sometimes con-
tribute to confusion around the incident. In the 
case of social media—insufficient account visi-
bility means fewer people are made aware of 
an existing threat to their safety. 
Law enforcement needs a reliable method 
of communication to rapidly notify as many 
people as possible within the vicinity of an on-
going active shooter incident; provide instruc-
tions to avoid the area or shelter in place; and 
announce when the area has been restored to 
safety. 
H.R. 6538, the Active Shooter Alert Act of 
2022, would authorize the Department of Jus-
tice to coordinate the creation of an Active 
Shooter Alert Network, enabling law enforce-
ment to send active shooter alerts to mobile 
devices within their communities using the 
same system that issues AMBER Alerts, se-
vere storm and extreme weather events warn-
ings, and other emergency situations. 
This legislation would ensure that an advi-
sory panel—comprised of law enforcement of-
ficers, public safety experts, and emergency 
response officials experienced in responding 
to active shooter situations—has input in the 
development of best practices for issuing 
alerts effectively. 
DOJ would oversee establishment of the ad-
visory panel; establish and promote adoption 
of the best practices; and coordinate with 
FEMA, the Department of Transportation, and 
the FCC to issue alerts for the network and to 
provide a report to Congress on the effective-
ness of the network. 
Although this system would be available to 
law enforcement agencies to use on a vol-
untary basis, I expect many agencies will elect 
to participate based on the many endorse-
ments received from law enforcement agen-
cies. 
I thank ACAL Subcommittee Chairman 
CICILLINE for his leadership on this lifesaving, 
bipartisan legislation that I am proud to co-
sponsor along with Representatives DEUTCH, 
SPARTZ, UPTON, THOMPSON, MEIJER, and 
MACE.

Mr. JORDAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 
minutes to the gentleman from Texas 
(Mr. ROY), my friend. 
Mr. ROY. Mr. Speaker, I associate 
myself with the remarks of my friend 
from Florida (Mr. GAETZ) a few min-
utes ago with respect to his position 
about what this bill will do in terms of 
fear and its purpose of creating fear 
among the people. That is the reality. 
That is what we are dealing with here. 
Texas has an alert system. States 
have alert systems. That is where this 
properly resides. That is where the po-
lice power resides, in the States. 
In fact, the chairman of the Judici-
ary Committee even acknowledged this 
reality that, well, okay, States have 
this, but here is a Federal program we 
are going to create with $2 million. 
You can use it if you want. 
This is another example of Wash-
ington creating another department, 
another position, spending more money 
that we don’t have in order to have a 
policy objective of continuing to ad-
vance fear among the American people. 
Remember the COVID alerts? How 
many alerts do we need on our phones 
to create fear in the minds of the 
American people? 
Allow the States to make a decision 
about when there is something that is 
meritorious, whether it is a tornado 
alert, whether it is an AMBER Alert. 
Allow the local jurisdictions to make 
that decision, not bureaucrats in Wash-
ington. That is the reality. 
I think it would probably be a more 
advantageous use of our time to de-
velop a congressional stupidity alert 
system or a congressional harm alert 
system. I mean, we do it every single 
day. That is what this body is actually 
engaged in on a regular basis, harming 
the American people through either 
nonaction or action. 
As we speak, maybe we should have 
an alert about the inflation running 
rampant around this country because 
of the rampant spending, as evidenced 
by this very bill with another $2 mil-
lion for a position in the Department of 
Justice. 
Maybe we need an alert system for 
the literal stream of people coming 
across the border in Eagle Pass right 
now and the fentanyl pouring across 
into our communities, endangering the 
American people, empowering cartels 
at our peril. 
Maybe, perhaps, we need an alert sys-
tem for more COVID mandates, more 
mask mandates, and more shutdowns 
in our schools where our children get 
harmed and where they have mental 
health issues because of what this body 
does. 
Maybe we need an alert system for 
the wokeism and the vax mandates at 
the Department of Defense that are 
damaging our ability to recruit. Just 
now, on the floor this week, we are 
going to be taking up the National De-
fense Authorization Act. We can’t even 
attain 40 percent recruiting standards 
right now in our United States Army 
because of wokeism and because of vac-
cine mandates driving our personnel 
away from the Department of Defense. 
Maybe we need an alert system for the 
American people to know what is hap-
pening at the Department of Defense. 
Maybe we need an alert on our fail-
ures to vote, our proxy voting in this 
very body, and our virtual voting from 
boats by some of our colleagues on the 
other side of the aisle. 
We could have so many alert systems 
that we could be actually educating 
the American people on what they are 
getting here in this august body, the 
people’s House. That would be a more 
valuable alert system than carrying 
out the function of the State and local 
police power that is inherent in our 
Constitution, which this body tramples 
upon on a regular and daily basis. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 3 minutes to the distinguished 
gentleman from Michigan (Mr. UPTON), 
one of the sponsors of the bill. 
Mr. UPTON. Madam Speaker, I thank 
the chairman for yielding. 
This morning, I saw the news that 
the North Carolina Little League State 
championship was canceled. That is 
right. Why? An active shooter. 
I saw the frantic video of a mom 
holding her handheld video of what was 
going on. Frankly, it reminded me of 
the congressional baseball practice in 
Alexandria a few years ago when our 
Republican whip, STEVE SCALISE, was 
seriously injured and, frankly, lucky to 
still be alive. 
My son played on that field, which is 
walking distance from my home. Some 
of my staff actually walked by that 
morning, not having a clue what was 
going on. 
This bill would change that. It would 
provide some resources—not an arm or 
a leg, but maybe what it takes for a 
traffic safety study—to provide an 
alert system across the country on 
your cell phone when an active shooter 
might be close by. 
It would work like an AMBER Alert 
system, just like I received when I 
landed at O’Hare yesterday, coming 
back to Washington. My phone went 
off, as others’ did on my flight when it 
landed, looking for what may have 
been a child predator. 
A few years ago, six folks were shot 
and killed in Kalamazoo, in my dis-
trict, next to the campus of Western 
Michigan University, a campus of some 
20,000 students, at about midnight. No 
alert system was sent. I believe that 
this legislation, had it been in place 
then, may have saved some of those 
folks who were killed that night. 
In the 1990s, two brave Capitol Hill 
police officers were shot and killed just 
down the stairs from this Chamber as 
they tried to kill our Republican whip, 
Tom DeLay. Then, as Members of Con-
gress, we had no such alert system. 
Today, we do.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5998 
July 13, 2022 
In fact, just this morning, we each 
received two notices of police activity 
on Capitol Hill, just as we did a couple 
of weeks ago on the day that we had 
this legislation up when Independence 
Avenue was closed because of a sus-
picious package outside the door of the 
Cannon Building. 
A week ago, on the Fourth of July, 
the Nation watched in horror the mass 
shooting in Highland Park. The media 
reports the initial sounds were thought 
to be fireworks. Wouldn’t it have been 
nice to have had a system that would 
have alerted the entire parade route to 
take cover? Maybe some of those folks 
that were killed or wounded wouldn’t 
have been. It breaks our hearts. 
Tragically, there are going to be 
more days like that, probably today. 
Can’t we take a small, bipartisan, com-
monsense measure to save a life or 
two? 
Yes, I believe in thoughts and pray-
ers. I do. I also believe in taking con-
structive steps to protect our commu-
nities. 
Every single law enforcement agency 
supports this. It is way past time to do 
something. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Ms. 
SA´ NCHEZ). The time of the gentleman 
has expired. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield an additional 30 seconds to the 
gentleman from Michigan. 
Mr. UPTON. Sadly, I know that the 
Gun Owners of America opposes this 
bill, but it does nothing to threaten the 
legal use of any gun. It only protects 
humans that, in fact, may be the tar-
get. 
Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from 
Kentucky (Mr. MASSIE), the co-chair of 
the Second Amendment Caucus. 
Mr. MASSIE. Madam Speaker, before 
I talk about the substance of this bill, 
or the lack thereof, I would like to put 
it in the context of the other dozen or 
so unserious, unconstitutional, unnec-
essary, and unsafe responses to gun 
shootings in this country that the 
Democrats have offered and passed in 
this Chamber. 
What have they done? Well, they 
passed a law to ban magazines with a 
capacity of more than 15 rounds. The 
chairman of the Rules Committee 
claimed that this would stop shootings 
like the one at Virginia Tech. What he 
failed to mention is the shooter at Vir-
ginia Tech never used a magazine that 
had more than 15 rounds. That is an ex-
ample of an unserious solution that has 
come from this body. 
What else have they done? They have 
changed the definition of a gun dealer 
so that any law-abiding individual who 
sells a firearm to anybody and makes a 
profit off it now might be a gun dealer 
and, therefore, prosecutable in a Fed-
eral crime. 
What else have they done that is 
unserious or unconstitutional? Well, 
they have passed a law to ban gun traf-
ficking. The problem is that is already 
illegal. 
Who did they sweep up in this drag-
net in this new law? Well, they swept 
up domestic violence victims who 
might ask a neighbor for a firearm. 
Now, they can be prosecuted. Not the 
neighbor, not just the Good Samaritan, 
but also the domestic violence victim 
can be prosecuted as a gun trafficker 
under a bill that they passed here. 
Recognizing this flaw, I offered an 
amendment to fix it in the Judiciary 
Committee. Every Democrat but one— 
one of them had a little bit of common 
sense—voted against that amendment 
to fix their own bill. 
What else have they done? Well, they 
passed a bill that I am going to call un-
constitutional on arrival. It has al-
ready been ruled unconstitutional if 
you read the D.C. v. Heller decision. 
The Supreme Court Justices said that 
you can’t force Mr. Dick Heller to keep 
his gun unloaded and disassembled in 
his house because that violates the 
Second Amendment. But that is ex-
actly what one of their laws that came 
through this Chamber in just the past 
couple of months does. It is called the 
so-called safe storage act. It is already 
unconstitutional. 
Who likes this bill more than any-
body? Home invaders. Oh, my gosh, 
wouldn’t it be great to know that, by 
Federal law, everybody who has a fire-
arm now has to have it locked up and 
unattainable, 
inaccessible 
in 
the 
amount of time that it would take to 
respond to a home invader? 
What else have they done? A red flag 
bill that deprives citizens of their due 
process and endangers police officers, 
who are going to be required to respond 
in predawn raids of people who haven’t 
had due process, have never had their 
day in court, haven’t even reached a 
level of evidence that is sufficient. The 
red flag bill is bad. 
What else have they done? They 
passed a bill to deprive 18-, 19-, and 20- 
year-olds of purchasing semiautomatic 
rifles and semiautomatic shotguns. 
They are already deprived of their con-
stitutional right to buy a handgun, but 
now we are just going to sweep in all of 
these things. 
Are they going to then raise the draft 
age to 21 now that we are saying Uncle 
Sam will give you a gun? Uncle Sam 
can conscript you to the military, send 
you overseas to fight for a Constitution 
that doesn’t even protect you or your 
wife, who is at home taking care of the 
kids, if you are 18-, 19-, or 20-year-olds. 
They don’t care. This one is also un-
constitutional on arrival. The Ninth 
Circuit, one of the most liberal circuits 
in the country, has already ruled that. 
Why is this so disturbing? We heard 
earlier today from one of my col-
leagues in this debate that she wants 
to ban assault weapons. Well, the 
House 
Democrat 
Twitter 
account 
tweeted that all semiautomatic rifles 
are weapons of war. Really? There are 
a lot of people in Kentucky who own 
Remington 750 deer rifles who are 
going to be shocked to find out that 
they purchased a weapon of war. If you 
saw one of these, I think you would all 
agree this is not a weapon of war. 
It is an alarm to every American who 
is out there watching this debate that 
they are coming after your guns. 
Now, let’s get to the substance of this 
bill, or the lack thereof. Why are we 
here debating this bill? This is the sec-
ond time we have voted on it, the sec-
ond time we debated it. Why are we 
here again? Because they tried to sus-
pend the rules of this body and get it 
through without following the rules of 
this House, and they failed. That is 
why we are here again, to give it the 
debate it deserves. 
The bill is called the Active Shooter 
Alert Act of 2022. In the Democrat cit-
ies where they defunded the police, I 
think you should call it the you are on 
your own act of 2022. Yes, that is right. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentleman has expired. 
Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield an additional 1 minute to the 
gentleman from Kentucky. 
Mr. MASSIE. They are going to tell 
you that you are on your own. 
But can you turn this thing off in 
Chicago? How will you get any sleep 
because you have a shooting literally 
every night in Chicago? If they were se-
rious about stopping crime or helping 
individuals, 
this 
would 
have 
been 
called the active violence alert act. 
Mr. MASSIE. Madam Speaker, what 
about violence committed with a car, 
violence committed with a knife? No 
concern for that because the true pur-
pose of this bill passing here today is 
to scare people. It is to scare people on 
their phones. They can’t get away from 
their phones. 
It is going to be popping up saying, 
be afraid, somebody’s got a gun, and 
they are going to try and condition the 
American public to ask to repeal the 
Second Amendment, either explicitly 
or implicitly, here in this Chamber. 
Madam Speaker, I urge opposition to 
this bill. 
b 1315 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from 
Illinois (Mr. SCHNEIDER). 
Mr. SCHNEIDER. Madam Speaker, 
we are hearing a lot of arguments 
today. My colleague on the other side 
talked about America at its best. Let 
me tell you about America at its best. 
Last Monday on July 4 in Highland 
Park, Illinois, thousands of people 
gathered together. Families, parents, 
grandparents, and children lined the 
road for a parade. Many of them came 
there year after year, generation after 
generation, to celebrate the birth of 
our country, the values of our Found-
ers, and the belief that this is a Nation 
for us all. I saw America at its best. 
At 10:14 on July 4 last week, a shoot-
er who had climbed a roof with an AR– 
15 fired 83 bullets in less than a minute, 
killing seven people and wounding doz-
ens of others. 
Thousands of people fled that parade, 
the best America has to offer, not

knowing where to go, not knowing 
what to do. They heard there was a 
shooter. Was it one? Was it two? It 
could have been many. Should they go 
home, or should they go somewhere 
else? Nobody knew. 
Imagine if on their phones they had 
been told of an active shooter at the 
corner of Second and Central. Imagine 
if on their phones, they had been told, 
go and seek safety in your home. For 8 
hours, people watched, people talked, 
rumors swirled. An entire community 
of 30,000 people was left to grieve and 
to fear. 
That is what this bill is about. That 
is why we are here. We are here to give 
the people of Highland Park or of the 
many communities around our country 
that have experienced an active shoot-
er, or will experience an active shooter, 
a little bit of security. 
According to the FBI, last year, 
there were 61 active shooting incidents 
in the country. That was last year 
alone and double the year before. We 
are seeing more violence in our coun-
try. We have to do something about 
this violence. 
I know the people who are arguing 
against this bill aren’t willing to do 
that. They are not willing to stand up 
and defend our communities, to keep 
our children safe from this kind of vio-
lence. They are not even willing to give 
our communities the information they 
need to seek safety on their own. 
We have to take action to stop these 
killings in our communities, but that 
is not what this bill is about. This bill 
is about getting people the critical, po-
tentially lifesaving information in a 
quick and efficient way in the event of 
a shooter. That is what this bill is 
about. That is why I am asking people 
to vote for it. 
Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from 
North Carolina (Mr. BISHOP). 
Mr. BISHOP of North Carolina. So as 
others have said—and this is the lan-
guage that struck me—when this mat-
ter was in committee, before it failed 
under suspension of the rules here, for 
good reason, this paragraph struck me. 
According to the Federal Emergency 
Management 
Agency, 
‘‘imminent 
threat 
alerts 
include 
natural 
or 
human-made disasters, extreme weath-
er, active shooters, and other threat-
ening emergencies that are current or 
emerging.’’ So the existing IPAWS sys-
tem explicitly covers this issue, which 
again, takes you back to, then, what 
this debate has materialized as. 
The soon-to-retire gentleman from 
Michigan on the Republican side re-
cited an event in North Carolina where 
Little League teams withdrew from a 
tournament because they heard shots. 
The police in Wilson say that they had 
no evidence that there was an active 
shooter involved. 
That incident had nothing to do with 
what we are talking about today, and 
yet, the gentleman from Michigan of-
fered it in support of this bill. 
The gentleman from Illinois or the 
gentleman who just spoke about the 
Highland Park shooting in Illinois—by 
the way, according to the wisdom of 
the majority and some Republican Sen-
ators, we passed support for red flag 
laws—well, Illinois has a red flag law. 
That person had been implicated in all 
circumstances that a red flag law 
ought to respond to. It didn’t work. 
We have been doing gun control since 
1968. Are you satisfied with the trajec-
tory? Does it salve your conscience to 
speak in a loud voice about how out-
raged you are and do something else 
that has no capacity to solve the prob-
lem? 
Because you refuse to grapple with 
the problem. I have said that all along. 
I am going to continue to say it. It is 
not the prevalence of guns. It is but for 
causation, ladies and gentlemen. 
We have always had guns in ample 
supply across this country. Always. 
But until the 1960s, you never heard of 
a mass shooting, and they have in-
creased at a rapid rate in recent years. 
So it is not the guns that have 
changed. 
Let’s 
look 
at 
what 
may 
have 
changed. We have changed the culture. 
Could that be it? Could that be the rea-
son that some reckless idiot in an 
automobile leaving the area of that 
Little League tournament was engaged 
in gun play, firing off a weapon? That 
never would have happened at an ear-
lier time in this country. 
The same political forces that tried 
to change the culture and succeeded is 
the side that wants to eliminate gun 
rights as the answer to a problem they 
have created. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman’s time has expired. 
Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield an additional 1 minute to the 
gentleman from North Carolina. 
Mr. BISHOP of North Carolina. So we 
see it over and over and over again. Ac-
countability would require you to 
point to the success of your actions. 
You have engaged in—Mr. MASSIE de-
tailed them—bill after bill after bill 
after bill, slowly eroding people’s gun 
rights away. 
Yet, the problems that you have 
caused get worse every year. They get 
worse every year in the cities that you 
control. 
Let’s grapple with the problem, and 
let’s stop the alarmism and the stigma-
tizing and the fearmongering that you 
believe to substitute for policy. It does 
not. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 3 minutes to the distinguished 
gentleman from Texas (Mr. GREEN). 
Mr. GREEN of Texas. Madam Speak-
er, I thank Mr. NADLER and all of the 
hands that have made this moment 
possible. 
Madam Speaker, I have been here in 
this House when we have given our 
thoughts and prayers to many persons 
who have died, many as a result of an 
active shooter circumstance. 
Thoughts and prayers are important. 
My grandfather was a preacher. He 
talked about thoughts and prayers, but 
he also talked about doing God’s work. 
Thoughts and prayers are important, 
but thoughts and prayers are not 
enough. Thoughts and prayers, unfor-
tunately, are not saving lives when we 
can make the difference. 
‘‘ . . . here on earth, God’s work must 
truly be our own.’’ These are the words 
of John F. Kennedy. Thoughts and 
prayers are not enough. 
There seems to be an argument today 
that we can give too much notice. Too 
much notice. We already have a system 
that can do this. Too much notice. Ask 
the loved ones of those who lost lives 
in the Atlanta, Georgia, area. Ask 
those loved ones if there was too much 
notice. 
I went there. I saw them. I saw the 
hurt and the pain. I saw them pleading 
for additional help. Thoughts and pray-
ers are not enough. 
You can’t give too much notice. Too 
much notice? Well, this shooter in At-
lanta went to three different spas over 
a 3-hour period. Three different spas. I 
do believe this is an active shooter. 
Killed 
eight 
people—eight 
people— 
three different spas over a 3-hour pe-
riod. This is an active shooter. Didn’t 
have too much notice. 
I believe that we have a duty, respon-
sibility, and obligation to do all that 
we can. When you can’t do enough, you 
still have a responsibility to do all that 
we can. This is an opportunity for us to 
do more to save lives. 
For edification purposes, since 1968— 
1968—more individuals in the United 
States have died from gun violence 
than in battles during all the wars the 
country has fought since its inception. 
Since 1968, more individuals in the 
United States have died from gun vio-
lence than in battle during all the wars 
since this country’s inception. 
Too much is not enough. Too much 
notice is not enough, and we don’t have 
enough. 
Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 3 minutes to my friend, the gen-
tleman from Texas (Mr. GOHMERT). 
Mr. 
GOHMERT. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
back in high school when I was a senior 
at a pregame warm-up at Carthage, I 
had my hands under the center about 
to take a snap, throw a pass—the man-
ager had my helmet—I am looking at 
the split end, and the manager yelled, 
LOUIE, and I looked up in time to have 
my nose splattered all over my face. 
That is what this warning will be. It 
is not going to stop violence. It is just 
going to say, look, we have got more 
violence. 
Let’s talk about what it really is. 
The truth is, these cities with the most 
violence in America—and there are al-
ready 1,400 warning systems that will 
already take care of this, but, appar-
ently, we need more help in the big cit-
ies controlled by Democrats. 
We are not going to lower the crime 
rate. I have spent much of my adult 
life in courtrooms dealing with crime. I 
am familiar with what causes it, what 
happens. My heart has gone out repeat-
edly to victims, but you have got to re-
duce crime.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H6000 
July 13, 2022 
How can we do that? We have 
brought up repeatedly in committee 
over the years, 17 and a half years I 
have been here, look, let’s go to the 
heart of what is causing the crime. 
I saw a recent report that said 
fatherlessness definitely is affecting 
the crime. It definitely is affecting the 
violence. It is increasing the violence. 
We have always had guns, but we 
haven’t had mass shootings like this, 
mass killings. The culture has changed. 
Then we see this administration is 
going to help deal with problems 
around the world by giving grants to 
groups that will promote atheism and 
humanism. As if we are not doing 
enough damage. Because as Adam said, 
this Constitution was meant for a 
moral and religious people. It is wholly 
inadequate for the governing of any 
other. 
If we want to deal with shooters, 
don’t take away guns from law-abiding 
people. Look where the mass shootings 
are. They like to go where there is no-
body law-abiding that has a gun. 
And what about the border? The bor-
der has drugs pouring across, drugs 
that have added tens of billions a year 
to the drug cartels that engage in vio-
lence and are now located in cities all 
over America. 
So I would just submit, you know, 
this is going to be, if it is passed—and 
the Democrats have the majority. They 
have the White House. They have the 
Senate. If it passes, you know, it is 
going to be in the big cities. 
They are not going to reduce their 
crime. So I would suggest if they are 
going to be going 24/7, at least get some 
nice music on there so maybe that will 
be soothing. Maybe some good Paul 
Williams songs, because it is not going 
to stop crime. Maybe some good music 
will make people feel better. 
b 1330 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 3 minutes to the distinguished 
gentlewoman from South Carolina (Ms. 
MACE). 
Ms. MACE. Madam Speaker, in South 
Carolina, unfortunately, we are no 
stranger to mass shootings. 
Seven years ago in June, we had nine 
Black 
church 
members 
at 
Mother 
Emanuel who were murdered in cold 
blood by a single killer. 
On April 26 of this year, right adja-
cent to a little league baseball game in 
the evening, in a parking lot, over 30 
shots were fired. The harrowing video 
of seeing young kids literally crawling 
off the baseball field in tears, parents 
frightened, scared to death about their 
children and this shooting had taken 
place just next door. 
On Memorial Day of this year in 
Charleston, there were 13 people shot 
that evening, including three law en-
forcement officers, to say nothing of 
the hundreds of mass shootings that we 
have seen so far this year, including 
over two dozen in our schools and 
Uvalde. 
More recently Highland Park—and I 
will mention that my father’s last duty 
station in the military as a U.S. Army 
General was at Fort Sheridan, Illinois. 
I spent a year of my life in Highland 
Park going to Highland Park Middle 
School. I am very familiar with that 
community and have been heartbroken 
by what they have been through over 
the last few weeks. 
And in Chicago, there are mass 
shootings every single weekend. 
The beauty of H.R. 6538 is that I 
agree with both sides of the aisle and 
what they are saying today. As some-
one who owns seven firearms, a rifle, 
two shotguns, and four pistols, I sup-
port law-abiding citizens’ right to own 
firearms 
included 
in 
the 
Second 
Amendment. The beauty of this bill is 
it is not requiring or demanding or 
mandating anything. It is not taking 
away 
anyone’s 
Second 
Amendment 
rights. 
When I have spoken to law enforce-
ment across not just the First Congres-
sional District, but across the entire 
State of South Carolina, when I speak 
to sheriffs, when I speak to police 
chiefs, I realize and understand that 
there is a patchwork of technology out 
there that some are aware of, some are 
not. 
So, for example, in one county in my 
State, we have something called code 
red where residents can opt in. Another 
county has nothing, another munici-
pality or locality can do a reverse 911, 
but there is nothing consistent. The 
beauty of this bill is it doesn’t infringe 
on anyone’s Second Amendment rights. 
It does do a study by the Comptroller 
General under section 5 to understand 
what States are and aren’t doing and 
what some of the best practices are. 
In section 4, we have an advisory 
panel that is created, their job—and 
these are law enforcement officers, 
these are everyday first responders, 
people who are in the thick of it every 
single day facing these mass shoot-
ings—is putting together best practices 
so that the coordinator, as defined in 
section 3, can provide this information. 
This encourages States and localities 
and municipalities what the best prac-
tices are, and helps provide that infor-
mation to them and the tools that they 
need so the next time—it is not a mat-
ter of ‘‘if’’ but a matter of ‘‘when’’—the 
next mass shooting is, they can, if they 
want, if they choose to voluntarily 
alert those in the community. 
Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I am 
prepared to close, and I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from 
Arizona (Mr. BIGGS). 
Mr. BIGGS. Madam Speaker, I oppose 
H.R. 6538. Frankly, this bill is unneces-
sary. Nothing prevents the States 
today from creating an alert system 
for active shooter incidents. Every 
State has the capacity to implement a 
warning system if they choose to. 
In fact, in 2020, the GAO said there 
are more than 1,400 systems already in 
place throughout the country that 
make this available. We passed here, 
just 4 or 5 years ago, the Ashlynne 
Mike AMBER Alert in Indian Country 
Act. That cleared up a lot of holes 
throughout the country on these emer-
gency alert systems. This really is du-
plicative, and is, quite frankly, not 
necessary. 
Contrary to the belief of many Mem-
bers of this body, the solution to every 
issue is not a Federal program. We 
should allow States, who have the abil-
ity, to create systems for providing 
emergency notifications for their citi-
zens in a manner that is best for them. 
What this does is by putting a Fed-
eral coordinator over there, it actually 
lays in place the infrastructure for a 
soon-to-be-mandated system that the 
States will have to fund, but it will be 
mandated by the Federal Government. 
That is my prognostication here be-
cause that is what always happens. 
DOJ can already issue best practices 
and guidance related to public safety 
alerts. So what is this? This is a bill 
designed to feel good. This is a visceral 
bill, an emotional bill. This is not a bill 
designed to make us safer, make Amer-
icans safer. We already have those 
mechanisms and means in place. 
We have spent a lot of time going 
over bills introduced by my colleagues 
across the aisle regarding gun violence. 
Very few of them are going to provide 
any kind of help and assistance. There 
are bills that we have introduced that 
will not get a hearing that I believe 
will actually provide help and safety 
for the American people. 
This bill, however, by creating this 
Federal alert system—and it is not a 
Federal alert system, but it will evolve 
into that—is to remind us always that 
gun violence exists all around us, and 
it is to basically prejudice people 
against lawful gun owners. 
One of the best things you can have, 
regardless 
of 
what 
my 
colleagues 
across the aisle say, is a trained good 
guy with a gun. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume while I am waiting because I have 
one more speaker who would like to 
weigh in. 
As has been said, this bill is redun-
dant. States can already do it if they 
so choose. This bill is part of a series of 
legislation that the Democrats have 
passed that attacks law-abiding citi-
zens’ Second Amendment liberties. 
We know what happened a few weeks 
ago with the red flag law that was 
passed by this body. Someone doesn’t 
like you, and they go to law enforce-
ment or they go to a judge. There is a 
hearing. You are not allowed to be at 
the hearing. You are not allowed to 
have your lawyer at the hearing. You 
are not allowed to confront your ac-
cuser. You haven’t been charged with a 
crime, but they can take your gun, 
take your property, take away your 
Second Amendment right, and then

you have to go petition the court to 
get it back. 
This bill gives $2 million to the De-
partment of Justice. I mean, giving 
more money to the Justice Depart-
ment, the most politicized Justice De-
partment I have ever seen, the same 
Justice Department where over a dozen 
whistleblowers have come to our office 
talking about concerns they have with 
investigations that the FBI and the 
Justice Department are doing, the 
same Justice Department that treated 
parents as domestic terrorists for sim-
ply showing up at school board meet-
ings and voicing concerns about the 
curriculum being taught to their chil-
dren, that Justice Department, we are 
giving more money to do this program? 
The same Justice Department that, 
sad to say, has joined the effort by the 
left to intimidate the Court, our high-
est Court in the land, we are giving 
money to that Justice Department? 
Make no mistake, this Justice De-
partment has done that by their failure 
to enforce the statute to protect our 
Supreme Court Justices. When people 
are protesting at their home, trying to 
impact and intimidate the Court, this 
Justice Department refused to deal 
with the statute that is exactly on 
point. We are giving money to that 
Justice Department. 
So for all those reasons, we have real 
concerns with this legislation, and I 
would urge opposition to the bill. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself the balance of my time. 
There is a reason that this bipartisan 
legislation is endorsed by the Major 
Cities Chiefs Association, the National 
Association of Police Organizations, 
the Fraternal Order of Police, the Na-
tional Policing Institute, the National 
Sheriffs’ Association, the National Dis-
trict Attorneys Association, and sev-
eral State and local law enforcement 
organizations. 
When tragedy strikes—and unfortu-
nately we know that it will strike 
again—we want our law enforcement 
and first responders to have all the 
tools they need to keep our commu-
nities safe. We want our people to have 
the warnings that they need, just as 
with the AMBER Alert system. 
I urge my colleagues to stand with 
law enforcement and to support this 
important legislation. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to House Resolution 1224, the pre-
vious question is ordered on the bill, as

quently than quarterly, collaborate with, part-
ner with, and give weight to the advice of vet-
erans service organizations and such other 
stakeholders as the Secretary considers appro-
priate. 
‘‘(4) Failure to include a military environ-
mental exposure or adverse health effect in a 
Federal Register notice published pursuant to 
subsection (a) shall not preclude the Secretary 
from initiating a formal evaluation of such ex-
posure or health effect. 
‘‘(b) WORKING
GROUP.—(1) The Secretary 
shall establish a working group within the De-
partment (in this section referred to as the 
‘Working Group’). 
‘‘(2) The Working Group shall include per-
sonnel of the Veterans Health Administration

‘‘(3) The Secretary shall consult with, and 
seek the advice of, the Working Group with re-
spect to cases in which—

tary, naval, air, or space service, experienced a 
toxic exposure; or 
‘‘(B) a dependent of a veteran may have expe-
rienced a toxic exposure during the active mili-
tary, naval, air, or space service of the veteran. 
‘‘(c) ASSESSMENTS.—(1) The Working Group 
shall assess cases of the toxic exposure of vet-
erans and their dependents that occurred dur-
ing active military, naval, air, or space service, 
including by conducting ongoing surveillance 
and reviewing such exposure described in sci-
entific literature, media reports, information 
from veterans, and information from Congress. 
‘‘(2) The assessments under paragraph (1)

(1) Following an assessment of a case of the 
toxic exposure of veterans that occurred during 
active military, naval, air, or space service 
under subsection (c), or their dependents, the 
Working Group may develop a recommendation 
for formal evaluation under section 1173 of this 
title to conduct a review of the health effects re-
lated to the case of exposure if the Working 
Group determines that the research may change 
the current understanding of the relationship 
between an exposure to an environmental haz-
ard and adverse health outcomes in humans. 
‘‘(2) Upon receipt of evidence suggesting that 
previous findings regarding the periods and lo-
cations of exposure covered by an existing pre-
sumption of service connection are no longer 
supported, the Working Group may nominate 
such evidence for formal evaluation under sec-
tion 1173 of this title to modify the periods and 
locations. 
‘‘(e) REPORTS BY THE WORKING GROUP.—Not

administrative action as the Working Group 
considers necessary for the Working Group to be 
more effective in carrying out the requirements 
of this section. 
‘‘(f) RESPONSES BY SECRETARY.—In response

tions 
‘‘(a) FORMAL

evaluation with respect to each recommendation 
made by the Working Group under section 1172 
of this title. 
‘‘(b) EVIDENCE, DATA, AND
FACTORS.—The 
Secretary shall ensure that each formal evalua-
tion under subsection (a) covers the following: 
‘‘(1) Scientific evidence, based on the review of 
available scientific literature, including human, 
toxicological, animal, and methodological stud-
ies, and other factors. 
‘‘(2) Claims data, based on the review of claim 
rate, grant rate, and service connection preva-
lence, and other factors. 
‘‘(3) Other factors the Secretary determines 
appropriate, such as— 
‘‘(A) the level of disability and mortality 
caused by the health effects related to the case 
of toxic exposure being evaluated; 
‘‘(B) the quantity and quality of the informa-
tion available and reviewed; 
‘‘(C) the feasibility of and period for gener-
ating relevant information and evidence; 
‘‘(D) whether such health effects are combat- 
or deployment-related; 
‘‘(E) the ubiquity or rarity of the health ef-
fects; and 
‘‘(F) any time frame during which a health ef-
fect must become manifest. 
‘‘(c) CONDUCT OF EVALUATIONS.—(1) The Sec-
retary shall ensure that each formal evaluation 
under subsection (a)— 
‘‘(A) reviews scientific evidence in a manner 
that— 
‘‘(i) conforms to principles of scientific and 
data integrity; 
‘‘(ii) is free from suppression or distortion of 
scientific or technological findings, data, infor-
mation, conclusions, or technical results; and 
‘‘(B)(i) evaluates the likelihood that a positive 
association exists between an illness and a toxic 
exposure while serving in the active military, 
naval, air, or space service; and 
‘‘(ii) assesses the toxic exposures and illnesses 
and determines whether the evidence supports a 
finding of a positive association between the 
toxic exposure and the illness. 
‘‘(2) In carrying out paragraph (1)(B)(ii), a 
formal evaluation under subsection (a) shall in-
clude reviewing all relevant data to determine 
the strength of evidence for a positive associa-
tion based on the following four categories: 
‘‘(A) The ‘sufficient’ category, where the evi-
dence is sufficient to conclude that a positive 
association exists. 
‘‘(B) The ‘equipoise and above’ category, 
where the evidence is sufficient to conclude that 
a positive association is at least as likely as not, 
but not sufficient to conclude that a positive as-
sociation exists. 
‘‘(C) The ‘below equipoise’ category, where 
the evidence is not sufficient to conclude that a 
positive association is at least as likely as not, 
or is not sufficient to make a scientifically in-
formed judgment. 
‘‘(D) The ‘against’ category, where the evi-
dence suggests the lack of a positive association. 
‘‘(d) RECOMMENDATION
FOR ESTABLISHING
A 
PRESUMPTION
OF
SERVICE
CONNECTION.—Not 
later than 120 days after the date on which a 
formal evaluation is commenced, the element of 
the Department that conducts the evaluation 
shall submit to the Secretary a recommendation 
with respect to establishing a presumption of 
service connection for the toxic exposure and ill-
ness, or modifying an existing presumption of 
service connection, covered by the evaluation.

RECOMMENDATION.—Not 
later than 160 days after the date on which the 
Secretary receives a recommendation to establish 
or modify a presumption of service connection 
under section 1173 of this title— 
‘‘(1) if the Secretary determines, in the discre-
tion of the Secretary, that the presumption, or 
modification, is warranted, the Secretary shall— 
‘‘(A) commence issuing regulations in accord-
ance with the provisions of subchapter II of 
chapter 5 of title 5 (commonly referred to as the 
Administrative Procedures Act) setting forth the 
presumption or commence revising regulations to 
carry out such modification; and 
‘‘(B) include in such regulations any time 
frame during which a health effect must become 
manifest; or 
‘‘(2) if the Secretary determines, in the discre-
tion of the Secretary, that the presumption, or 
modification, is not warranted, the Secretary 
shall publish in the Federal Register a notice of 
the determination, including the reasons sup-
porting the determination. 
‘‘(b) REMOVAL OF PRESUMPTION.—(1)(A) The 
Secretary may— 
‘‘(i) issue a regulation to remove an illness 
from a presumption of service connection pre-
viously established pursuant to a regulation 
issued under subsection (a); and 
‘‘(ii) issue a regulation to remove a presump-
tion of service connection established pursuant 
to title IV of the Sergeant First Class Heath 
Robinson Honoring our Promise to Address 
Comprehensive Toxics Act of 2022 if the Sec-
retary concludes that evidence suggests the lack 
of a positive association between the disease and 
the toxic exposure. 
‘‘(B) Under subparagraph (A)(ii), the Sec-
retary shall not consider the lack of evidence as 
sufficient to support a decision for removal of a 
presumption.

DISEASES.—For each disease reviewed under 
subsection (c), the Academies shall determine, to 
the extent that available scientific data permit 
meaningful determinations— 
‘‘(1) whether an association exists between 
toxic exposures and the occurrence of the dis-
ease, taking into account the strength of the sci-
entific evidence and the appropriateness of the 
statistical and epidemiological methods used to 
detect the association; 
‘‘(2) the increased risk of the disease among 
those reporting toxic exposures during active 
military, naval, air, or space service; 
‘‘(3) whether there exists a plausible biological 
mechanism or other evidence of a positive asso-
ciation between the toxic exposure and the oc-
currence of the disease; and 
‘‘(4) determine the strength of evidence for a 
positive association based on categories fur-
nished under section 1173 of this title. 
‘‘(e) COOPERATION
OF FEDERAL AGENCIES.— 
The head of each relevant Federal agency, in-
cluding the Secretary of Defense, shall cooper-
ate fully with the Academies in performing the

The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from California. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. TAKANO. Madam Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days in which to 
revise and extend their remarks and to 
insert extraneous material on S. 3373, 
as amended. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from California? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. TAKANO. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, I stand before this 
Chamber in support of S. 3373, as 
amended, which is now the Sergeant 
First Class Heath Robinson Honoring 
our Promise to Address Comprehensive 
Toxics Act of 2022. 
This measure addresses a technical 
drafting error in the Senate amend-
ment to my PACT Act. As you know, 
the PACT Act passed the House with 
strong bipartisan support in March of 
this year. 
Today, despite the current rancorous 
political debates taking place across 
America, this Chamber has the chance 
to help the country heal after 20 years 
of war. 
We have an opportunity to make 
good on the promise we made to our 
servicemembers when our country sent 
them into harm’s way: that we would 
take care of them and pay for that care 
when they come home. 
For too long, veterans have faced an 
uphill battle to prove that the rare ill-
nesses and cancers they were experi-
encing stemmed from their time in the 
military. 
For too long, Congress and the De-
partment of Veterans Affairs have been 
slow to accept responsibility and cost 
of that care, and for too long the 
United States has not made good on 
our promise to our veterans. 
But today, I make a plea for unity so 
that we may right this wrong and 
make good on our commitment to 
honor our pact with America’s vet-
erans. Today, we can finally recognize 
toxic exposure as a cost of war. 
b 1345 
In the past, we saw Vietnam war vet-
erans living with the effects of Agent 
Orange, fighting the VA for the care 
and benefits they were due. The Blue 
Water Navy Vietnam Veterans Act was 
signed into law in 2019, but it came 
nearly four decades too late. This bill 
could have been passed 2 years earlier 
when 
my 
friend, 
then-Republican 
chairman, Dr. Phil Roe, was leading 
this committee, but two Senators held 
up that bill. During that needless 
delay, many veterans succumbed to 
their illnesses, and their families were 
not compensated. Now is our chance to 
make amends for that. 
There is absolutely no reason for vet-
erans and their survivors to fight the 
VA for the care and benefits they have 
earned through their service. Never 
again should veterans be made to suffer 
the indignity of fighting their own gov-
ernment. 
After Blue Water, I vowed that we 
would never again fail to live up to our 
promises to our veterans. That is why, 
at the beginning of the 117th Congress, 
I made addressing the effects of toxic 
exposure my top priority as chairman. 
Throughout our history, America has 
cast aside party affiliation on behalf of 
veterans, coming together to pass land-
mark legislation to properly recognize 
those who have served, such as in 1944 
when Congress passed the GI Bill. The 
GI Bill was transformational for a gen-
eration of veterans. By 1956, nearly 8 
million veterans had used the GI Bill’s 
education benefits and millions more 
still benefit from it today. 
We have an opportunity to make a 
generational impact today. The PACT 
Act will directly affect one out of every 
five veterans, or 3.5 million people. It 
will also send a strong message to fu-
ture 
generations 
of 
veterans 
that 
America will take care of them when 
their service ends. 
The way this country has dealt with 
toxic exposure has been piecemeal and 
inadequate. President Biden recognizes 
this, too. Shortly after he was sworn 
in, I met with the President about our 
shared priorities for veterans. Upon 
learning of my goal to pass comprehen-
sive legislation to help toxic-exposed 
veterans, the President leaned over to 
me and talked about his son, Beau, who 
served near burn pits in Iraq and 
Kosovo. 
It might be hard for most Americans 
to imagine what a burn pit looks like 
because they are illegal in the United 
States. Picture walking next to and 
breathing fumes from a burning pit the 
size of a football field. This pit con-
tained 
everything 
from 
household 
trash, plastics, and human waste to jet 
fuel and discarded equipment burning 
day and night. Beau Biden lived near 
these burn pits and breathed the fumes 
that emanated from them. 
President Biden believes that con-
stant exposure to these burn pits, and 
the toxic fumes they emitted, led to 
Beau’s cancer and early death. It was 
during that meeting when I knew I had 
a partner in President Biden. 
At the State of the Union, President 
Biden called on Congress to pass bipar-
tisan legislation to comprehensively 
address the effects of toxic exposure 
and improve the delivery of benefits for 
toxic-exposed veterans. I cannot thank 
him enough for throwing his support 
behind this effort and placing those 
who have served our country at the 
center of his unity agenda. 
To my colleagues who previously 
voted ‘‘no’’ on the PACT Act in March, 
I ask you the same question I asked 
you then: Are you willing to support 
our troops and honor our Nation’s 
promise to them? Or will you allow 
naked partisanship to once again deny 
our veterans the care they deserve? 
Just this Congress alone, every single 
Democrat in this body voted to make 
sure each day in uniform counts to-
ward GI Bill benefits. Every single 
Democrat voted to ensure a smooth 
transition from Active Duty to civilian 
life. Every single Democrat voted to 
honor our pact with toxic-exposed vet-
erans. There is no question as to where 
Democrats stand on prioritizing Amer-
ica’s veterans. We are backing up our 
thank-you with concrete action. 
Frankly, all the bills that I men-
tioned should have passed with unani-
mous support. If the American people 
knew the context of these bills and 
knew the content of them, they would 
demand unanimous support from this 
Chamber. 
But I take this moment now to rec-
ognize my Republican colleagues in 
this Chamber who put keeping our 
promise to veterans above partisan-
ship. I thank the Republican cospon-
sors 
of 
this 
bill, 
Representatives 
FITZPATRICK and CLINE. 
Further, I recognize the 34 Repub-
licans who in March showed their sup-
port for veterans by voting ‘‘yes’’ on 
final passage, including Veterans’ Af-
fairs 
Committee 
members, 
General 
BERGMAN and Representative MACE. I 
also recognize the commitment of Rep-
resentatives BILIRAKIS and KINZINGER, 
who do not serve on this committee, 
but demonstrated early leadership by 
supporting this legislation. I am also 
glad to see my colleague, Ranking 
Member BOST, finally stand in support 
of this bill today. 
Moreover, in June, an overwhelming 
bipartisan majority of 84 Senators 
voted in favor of the PACT Act in the 
Senate. This proved the value of the 
cause and showed that it had momen-
tum, so the trajectory of this effort is 
clear. 
But here is also a very rare situation 
where there is a chance for redemption. 
For those of my Republican colleagues 
who previously hesitated, sat on the 
sidelines, or chose politics over vet-
erans, you get a second chance to do 
the right thing. There is no reason why 
this time this measure should not gar-
ner at least 400 votes in this Chamber. 
Why is it that a Republican leader 
and Republican whip, who aspire to be 
in the majority but do not show the 
fortitude to govern, are continuing to 
oppose this bill and are asking you to 
do the same? Do not let them stand in 
the way with unconvincing arguments 
about budgetary constraints when the 
true cost of war, the human cost of 
war, is abundantly clear. 
For example, as the House considers 
the National Defense Authorization 
Act this week, a bill that authorizes 
$838.8 billion, spending which I believe 
could be justifiable, I am reminded of 
the stark reality of how this Congress 
approaches Federal spending. 
It has become a battle of defense 
spending versus everything else. That 
everything 
else 
includes 
veterans, 
schoolchildren, the elderly, and our 
constituents. I vigorously object to 
veterans being pitted against their fel-
low Americans to fight for funding. Do

we really want to support veterans by 
limiting school lunches for children? 
Do we support veterans by limiting 
help for seniors? You can be damn sure 
our veterans didn’t sign up to serve our 
country, watch their families make 
sacrifices, or go to war far from home 
so Members of this body could perpet-
uate a false choice that pits Americans 
against one another. 
The right choice, the choice we are 
going to make today, is simple: Recog-
nize toxic exposure as a cost of war, pe-
riod. 
Using hypocritical arguments about 
fiscal responsibility as a reason to op-
pose this bill when the truth of the 
moral responsibility of caring for our 
veterans is made crystal clear, is not 
consistent with American values. Make 
no mistake: When our country goes to 
war, we don’t nickel and dime the De-
partment of Defense, and we shouldn’t 
try to pinch pennies when it comes to 
covering the care for toxic-exposed vet-
erans. 
We don’t hear these arguments about 
needing offsets when we are asked 
rightly to support more body armor or 
protection from IEDs. This Congress 
steps up to the plate to provide our 
servicemembers with what they need 
to fight our wars. So why are Members 
of this body arguing that we need to 
scrounge around to find money for our 
veterans? It is time for Congress to 
fully support toxic-exposed veterans as 
they fight the rare cancers and ill-
nesses after returning home. 
Now, I must express dismay also 
about the procedural steps we must 
now undertake because a single Sen-
ator is preventing the Senate from 
quickly fixing the technical issue in 
this bill. This Senator, already having 
watched the bill pass the Senate the 
first time with strong support, know-
ing the veteran sacrifice behind it, and 
the blood, sweat, and tears shed by the 
veteran community to finally get this 
done, chose instead to object because 
he doesn’t like the funding mechanism 
in this bill. 
His position is the losing one, it was 
the losing one, and he has held up this 
bill for no other reason other than sour 
grapes; and to what end is unclear 
when veterans suffer in the meantime. 
Therefore, we Members of the House 
must take this route to push forward 
and do what we know is right. 
The Honoring our PACT Act would 
not have been possible were it not for 
the veterans who selflessly shared their 
stories, their pain, and their trauma, 
opening the eyes of their fellow Ameri-
cans to the realities of being exposed to 
toxic substances. 
Throughout this process, I have met 
many toxic-exposed veterans whose 
sacrifice and courage continued long 
after they hung up their uniform. I am 
forever humbled by the courage of Dr. 
Kate Hendricks Thomas, a Marine vet-
eran who served near a burn pit in 
Fallujah who later fought the VA for 3 
years to get the care she needed. 
I am sorry to say she passed away 
this spring, but not before selflessly 
fighting for a comprehensive bill that 
would aid over 3.5 million veterans like 
her living with the effects of toxic ex-
posure, a bill that she herself would 
not benefit from. We also honor the 
valor of Wesley Black, Heath Robinson, 
Jennifer Kepner, and so many others 
who are no longer with us. 
This bill would also not have been 
possible without the support of over 40 
veteran service organizations. Each of 
these organizations understand that 
toxic-exposed veterans are still in the 
heat of battle. I thank them for their 
impact and advocacy for the Honoring 
our PACT Act. 
I also thank my staff, who worked 
tirelessly to listen and engage with ad-
vocates and stakeholders and spent 
countless hours drafting and redrafting 
this bill to get it right. 
I also thank Speaker PELOSI for al-
ways being a tireless advocate for vet-
erans, along with Majority Leader 
HOYER. 
I also thank Senate Majority Leader 
SCHUMER for his work with Senators 
TESTER and MORAN and the Senate Vet-
erans’ Affairs Committee to pass this 
bill. 
I also point out that Jon Stewart and 
John Feal kept us accountable. 
Most importantly, to the families of 
veterans who tragically lost their lives 
as a result of being exposed to toxic 
substances during their time in service, 
I thank you for your sacrifices. 
This legislative effort will help our 
veterans heal, and it offers hope that 
our country can do the same. It sends 
a message to all Americans that their 
Government will not allow their griev-
ances to go unaddressed. It acknowl-
edges the suffering endured by our 
Vietnam 
war 
veterans 
and 
dem-
onstrates to them that we have learned 
from our mistakes and that their 
struggle and their suffering was not in 
vain. 
We are setting a new standard with 
the PACT Act. We are telling our vet-
erans: The burden of proof is not on 
you. Because of your sacrifice to our 
country, this Congress and the Amer-
ican people are giving you the benefit 
of the doubt that you have earned. 
Let’s pass this bill and ease the anx-
iety in the minds of our veterans who 
are living with cancer or other ill-
nesses and terminal diseases and let 
them know that their families are 
going to be taken care of. I believe this 
is what the American people want and 
what everyone in this Chamber should 
want. It is what our veterans deserve, 
and it is the right thing to do. 
Madam Speaker, I encourage all my 
colleagues to honor their pact with the 
veterans by voting ‘‘yes’’ on this bill. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. BOST. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself as much time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in support of 
S. 3373, as amended, the Sergeant First 
Class Heath Robinson Honoring our 
Promise to Address Comprehensive 
Toxics Act. 
When we were debating the House 
version of the PACT Act 4 months ago, 
I couldn’t have said that. I am glad 
that I can today. 
The bill is not perfect, but expanding 
healthcare and benefits for veterans 
who were exposed to burn pits or other 
dangerous toxins while serving our 
country is the right thing to do. 
I come from a long line of veterans. 
My grandfather, Marines; my father, 
Army; my uncle, Marines; I was in the 
Marines; my son, Marines; my grand-
son, Marines; and my granddaughter 
enlisted this year in the United States 
Navy. 
b 1400 
I know exactly how high the stakes 
are when this country sends young men 
and young women to serve. I know ex-
actly how high the stakes are when 
they come home. I know exactly how 
often we have failed to meet them and 
give them what they need. That is why 
I helped lead the charge to provide dis-
ability benefits to blue water Navy 
Vietnam veterans a few years ago. 
We were decades late in giving those 
veterans the help they need. My vow 
then and now was to make sure that 
other generations of veterans don’t 
have to wait for benefits they earned 
while 
they 
were 
serving 
or 
the 
healthcare they require. 
DOD estimates that 3.5 million vet-
erans have been exposed to dangerous 
toxins in Iraq and Afghanistan over the 
past 20 years. Some of them are al-
ready sick and suffering from the 
health effects of that exposure. They 
need help, and this bill will give it to 
them. 
This bill will also make sure that the 
VA can actually give that help to 
them, unlike the earlier PACT Act 
that could not. 
I am grateful for the hard work of 
the Senate Committee on Veterans’ Af-
fairs Chairman JON TESTER and Rank-
ing Member JERRY MORAN. They took a 
flawed House bill and made it better. 
There are several aspects of their 
work that make today’s vote on the 
PACT Act very different than the prior 
one. This is a better bill than the one 
the House passed in March. 
It reflects bipartisan negotiations 
and input from VA, which is ultimately 
responsible for putting this into prac-
tice. 
It incorporates the good work the VA 
is already doing to address toxic expo-
sure—namely, the scientific framework 
that the VA has been using since last 
year to expand benefits to toxic-ex-
posed veterans. 
It removes certain provisions from 
the House bill that VA told us could 
not and would not get done. It adds 
other provisions that would make VA 
work more transparently to veterans 
and taxpayers, more flexible, and more 
scientifically sound. 
All of those things were missing from 
the prior House version. Most impor-
tantly, the earlier version of the bill 
ignored the massive operational im-
pacts this effort will have on VA’s

healthcare and benefit systems. In con-
trast, this bill addresses this head-on. 
To ensure that the VA has the staff 
capacity it needs to better serve toxic- 
exposed veterans, this bill would: au-
thorize 31 VA medical facility leases; 
make it easier for Congress to author-
ize additional VA medical facility 
leases going forward, something the 
committee has been trying to do for 
decades; make it easier for VA to re-
cruit and retain the staff it needs to 
implement the bill; and give VA re-
sources to process claims faster using 
modern technology. 
These changes and additions are crit-
ical to the bill’s success, and they give 
me confidence to vote for this bill 
without fearing that it would be impos-
sible to implement or risk breaking the 
VA for veterans everywhere, those who 
are already receiving benefits. 
Many of us are concerned about the 
CBO score for this bill and the funding 
mechanism it contains. The total score 
went from $325 billion over 10 years in 
the prior version to $681 billion in this 
version. I don’t criticize my colleagues 
for being concerned about that. That is 
an increase of $356 billion. 
That number gives me a lot of pause 
when I consider the strain that rising 
inflation is already putting on Amer-
ican families. Anyone who is trying to 
serve these veterans, it should give 
them pause, too, because not only is it 
the veterans that will be paying, but it 
is their children and grandchildren, as 
well. 
However, only about $285 billion of 
the score is truly new spending. The 
costs of expanding care and benefits for 
toxic exposure actually decreased by 
about $40 billion from the prior version 
of this bill to this one. The rest of the 
score is a result of the cost of war toxic 
exposure fund. 
The 
fund 
pays 
for 
expanding 
healthcare for veterans who experience 
toxic exposure. That is reasonable. 
However, the fund is also a budgetary 
ploy by the Democrats to take existing 
healthcare costs that have nothing to 
do with toxic exposure and transfer 
them from discretionary to mandatory 
spending. That is causing CBO’s score 
to be artificially high because almost 
$400 billion in costs that are already 
funded by current law are being scored 
against the bill. 
Even worse, this ploy would put even 
more government spending on auto-
pilot and limit our ability to control 
and oversee it, which is our right under 
the Constitution. That is wrong. 
Now, some of my colleagues will vote 
against the bill because of that, and 
like I said before, I don’t blame them. 
I am not. I am voting for it because, as 
the Republican leader of the Veterans’ 
Affairs Committee and as a veteran, I 
know that, on balance, this is a good 
bill that will help millions of veterans, 
servicemembers, survivors, and mili-
tary families. That is why I will be sup-
porting this bill today. 
I have already thanked our Senate 
colleagues for their work on this bill, 
but I also thank many Members on 
both sides of the aisle who have intro-
duced the various standalone bills that 
make up the PACT Act, including 
Chairman TAKANO for his hard work 
and commitment to this issue. I thank 
our 
staff 
because 
they 
also 
have 
worked to make sure that this bill 
would come about, not only that it 
would come about, but it would be able 
to be implemented. 
I recognize the many veterans service 
organizations who have held our feet to 
the fire every step of the way to get it 
done. I know they will stay by our side 
every day ahead to make sure VA does 
it right. I look forward to doing the 
work with them. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. TAKANO. Madam Speaker, I cer-
tainly welcome the support of the 
ranking member on this bill. 
May I inquire as to the time remain-
ing in debate. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from California has 141⁄2 min-
utes remaining. The gentleman from 
Illinois has 22 minutes remaining. 
Mr. TAKANO. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman 
from Virginia (Mrs. LURIA), my good 
friend who is the chairwoman of the 
Disability Assistance and Memorial Af-
fairs Subcommittee. 
Mrs. LURIA. Madam Speaker, I rise 
in strong support of the Honoring our 
PACT Act. As we near final passage of 
this historic and comprehensive legis-
lation to address toxic exposures af-
flicting veterans across several genera-
tions, it has been a privilege to lay the 
groundwork for this endeavor as chair 
of the Disability Assistance and Memo-
rial Affairs Subcommittee. 
Many pieces of legislation that have 
passed through our jurisdiction are on 
their way to being included in this 
package and becoming law. In par-
ticular, I am honored to have intro-
duced the COVENANT Act, a corner-
stone of the PACT Act. 
This bill is best known for providing 
access to care for those veterans ex-
posed to burn pits and many others 
who have struggled too long to receive 
care for health conditions caused by 
burn pits and other toxic exposures. To 
put it simply, this bill will see that 3.5 
million veterans are eligible for Pri-
ority Group 6 VA healthcare. It con-
cedes exposure to airborne hazards and 
recognizes 23 new airborne hazard-re-
lated conditions as presumptively serv-
ice-connected. 
When signed into law, I don’t think I 
would be wrong in saying that this is 
possibly the largest increase in access 
to veterans healthcare that any of us 
have seen in our lifetimes. This legisla-
tion will assist many of our fellow 
servicemembers and veterans who have 
suffered for too long. 
The PACT Act has been a long time 
coming, but today the House is pre-
pared to send this essential veterans 
assistance package back to the Senate 
and, ultimately, to the President’s 
desk. We are finally recognizing the 
true cost of war for all who deployed in 
defense of our Nation. 
I thank Chairman TAKANO for his un-
wavering leadership through this proc-
ess, as well as my fellow Members on 
and off the committee for their impor-
tant contributions to this historic leg-
islation. 
Lastly, I thank the veterans, the sur-
vivors, and the veterans service organi-
zations, VSOs, who have made their 
voices heard. This is for you. 
I wholeheartedly urge my colleagues 
to vote ‘‘yes’’ on the Honoring our 
PACT Act. 
Mr. BOST. Madam Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentleman from Michi-
gan (Mr. BERGMAN), the highest rank-
ing officer that serves in Congress 
today. He has served with many of the 
men and women who will benefit from 
this bill today. 
Mr. BERGMAN. Madam Speaker, I 
rise in strong support today of S. 3373, 
the Sergeant First Class Heath Robin-
son Honoring our Promise to Address 
Comprehensive Toxics Act of 2022. 
I associate myself with the com-
ments of our Republican leader on the 
Veterans’ 
Affairs 
Committee, 
Mr. 
BOST, who also happens to be a fellow 
marine. He articulated very well the 
elements of where we were, where we 
are, and where we are going. 
This is the latest version of what 
many of my constituents know as the 
PACT Act, and it has only improved 
since it passed the House last March. 
As a Vietnam veteran myself and as 
the ranking member of the House Vet-
erans’ 
Affairs 
Subcommittee 
on 
Health, I am more than familiar with 
the struggles faced by veterans, young 
and old, across our Nation who have 
been exposed to toxic substances dur-
ing their time of service. 
This legislation will finally establish 
a comprehensive framework for the VA 
to provide veterans and their survivors 
for generations to come with the toxic 
exposure-related care and benefits that 
they deserve. 
For example, this bill will instantly 
provide presumptive benefits for vet-
erans and survivors who are terminally 
ill, homeless, over the age of 85, experi-
encing extreme financial hardship, or 
able to show another emergent need. 
It will also supercharge toxic expo-
sure research, improve the way in 
which the VA interacts with toxic-ex-
posed veterans, and authorize 31 major 
medical facility leases. 
Whether it is from burn pits or Agent 
Orange, toxic exposure is perhaps the 
most widespread and urgent issue fac-
ing our military community. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to join me in supporting this 
bipartisan solution based on what the 
veterans themselves have been telling 
us for a long time. It is time to act. 
Mr. TAKANO. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentleman from 
Indiana (Mr. MRVAN), my good friend 
who is the chairman of the Sub-
committee on Technology Moderniza-
tion and on the Veterans’ Affairs Com-
mittee.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H6020 
July 13, 2022 
Mr. MRVAN. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today in support of the final version of 
the Honoring our PACT Act, which will 
uphold our obligation to ensure that 
veterans 
receive 
the 
world-class 
healthcare they deserve. 
As a Member of Congress and a mem-
ber of the Veterans’ Affairs Committee, 
we have a responsibility to support all 
veterans when they return home from 
protecting our freedoms and defending 
our democracy. 
As I walked the parade routes of the 
Fourth of July and visited the veterans 
service organizations, it is not enough 
to simply say ‘‘thank you for your 
service’’ to our veterans. It is through 
our actions that we provide proof we 
have our veterans’ backs and value 
their service. 
Ultimately, 
veterans 
living 
with 
toxic exposures must not be denied the 
care and benefits they have earned. 
I encourage all of my colleagues to 
join me in supporting this measure. 
Again, I thank Chairman TAKANO, all 
the Members, and all of my colleagues 
on the House Veterans’ Affairs Com-
mittee for their leadership to finalize 
this critical legislation to have our 
veterans’ backs. 
Mr. BOST. Madam Speaker, I yield 3 
minutes to the gentleman from Texas 
(Mr. ROY), who has served from the 
time of being in Congress on the Vet-
erans’ Affairs Committee. 
Mr. ROY. Madam Speaker, I thank 
the ranking member for yielding. 
As a member of the Veterans’ Affairs 
Committee and as someone who rep-
resents San Antonio, an inordinate 
number of veterans, Joint Base San 
Antonio, Army Futures Command, I re-
gret to rise in opposition to the legisla-
tion before us. 
I respect the enormous amount of 
work that has gone into this legisla-
tion by the committee staff, by the 
ranking member, by the chairman, by 
the Senate. Obviously, it is an impor-
tant issue, and it is critical. I have 
many friends here, particularly vet-
erans, who support this measure, and I 
understand why. 
Every single one of us wants to make 
sure that we take care of this issue, 
and frankly, it has been way too long 
in getting to it. I agree with that com-
pletely. But, unfortunately, I cannot 
support this bill because this bill 
spends about $285 billion that we don’t 
have. 
b 1415 
We have to address the issue in this 
body of spending money we don’t have. 
The chairman said: Well, why don’t 
you raise it on other issues? I raised it 
on every single issue. I raised it on a $2 
million bill about 30 minutes ago on 
the floor. 
At some point, we have to pay for the 
stuff that we are spending it on or the 
very things that these veterans sac-
rificed for will be made completely and 
utterly worthless. We are destroying 
the Republic that these men and 
women sacrificed for, and we are de-
stroying it in this Chamber by our in-
competence and by our irresponsible 
refusal to actually manage the affairs 
of the Republic appropriately. 
Putting this bill on autopilot to the 
tune of $680 billion of mandatory 
spending with $280 billion unpaid for, 
which we can pay for right now with 
existing COVID funds, we could pay for 
it right now with the elimination of 
the SALT deduction, we could pay for 
it right now with any number of spend-
ing cuts and/or tax increases—if we 
wanted to have that debate on the floor 
of the House—but we are not doing it. 
We do a disservice to the veterans 
who are sick because of the burn pits. 
We do a disservice to the veterans who 
laid their lives on the line and died for 
this country. We do a disservice to the 
military that we say that we support 
when we are not spending money that 
we actually have, as opposed to print-
ing money and borrowing money. 
Putting it on autopilot, when 60 per-
cent of our spending every year is al-
ready on autopilot—when we are $30.5 
trillion in debt. Instead of the estab-
lished scientific framework, we put 20 
conditions in without scientific evi-
dence which will cause a backlog, 
which the VA even acknowledges will 
cause a backlog. These are real con-
cerns that we ought to address. 
Fundamentally, you have to pay for 
that which we are spending. We are un-
dermining the sacrifice of the very vet-
erans that we say that we are helping 
with this measure by not doing it with 
fiscal responsibility. 
Mr. TAKANO. Madam Speaker, noth-
ing could be more important or a high-
er priority in defense of our Republic 
than to address the unaddressed griev-
ances of our veterans. We are keeping 
our promise to our veterans. We are 
saying today that doing so is a cost of 
war. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to 
the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. 
TRONE), a member of the House Vet-
erans’ Affairs Committee and active 
member of the Economic Opportunity 
Subcommittee. 
Mr. TRONE. Madam Speaker, today I 
rise to urge my colleagues to pass the 
Honoring our PACT Act to give our 
veterans the healthcare they earned. 
Over 3.5 million veterans have been 
exposed to toxins, such as burn pits, 
during deployment, causing horrific 
health impacts. To add insult to in-
jury, the disability benefit claims proc-
ess places the burden on our vets them-
selves to jump through hoops. This is a 
shameful problem—a shameful prob-
lem—one we are determined to fix. 
This legislation, which includes my 
FASTER Presumptions Act, will help 
cut the red tape and streamline proce-
dures for veterans who have earned it 
to access their healthcare benefits fast-
er. Our veterans served our country 
with honor and we have to honor their 
service. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to honor our PACT through 
this bill, and I thank Chairman TAKANO 
for his leadership. 
Mr. BOST. Madam Speaker, I yield 3 
minutes to the gentlewoman from Iowa 
(Mrs. MILLER-MEEKS), who has actually 
served in health situations in our mili-
tary, a veteran herself, and is very 
aware of the things that we are dealing 
with here. 
Mrs. 
MILLER-MEEKS. 
Madam 
Speaker, I rise in support of the Ser-
geant First Class Heath Robinson Hon-
oring our PACT Act. 
When the House first passed the 
PACT Act in March, I spoke on the 
floor and urged my colleagues to find a 
bipartisan solution to give toxic-ex-
posed veterans the care and support 
that we as a country owe them. This 
bill is that bipartisan solution, and I 
am proud to support it. 
As a 24-year military veteran, I have 
seen firsthand the effects that toxic ex-
posure has had on my fellow service-
members, whether it is herbicides like 
Agent Orange in southeast Asia or burn 
pits in the Middle East. 
In fact, my knowledge is so intimate 
that my husband, who is also a 30-year 
veteran, and I, have a close friend, Jay, 
who, after his deployment to Desert 
Storm, that very brief conflict, in com-
ing back to the United States came off 
of the plane and collapsed. He devel-
oped a heart condition called cardio-
myopathy, which led this 30-year-old to 
have a heart transplant, aseptic necro-
sis of his hip with a replacement of his 
hip, and soon his untimely and young 
death. 
Exposure to these substances can 
lead to severe life-altering diseases. 
However, under the current system at 
the VA, it can be extraordinarily cost-
ly, time-consuming, and in some cases, 
impossible for a sick or disabled vet-
eran to prove that their condition is re-
lated to the toxins to which they were 
exposed during their military service. 
The bill we are voting on today en-
sures that this will no longer be the 
case. Under the framework created by 
the PACT Act, toxic-exposed veterans 
will finally receive the care and bene-
fits they deserve and have earned. This 
bill ensures the VA will administer 
those benefits in a responsible, fair 
way. 
This new version of the PACT Act in-
cludes important reforms to build on 
the VA’s existing framework for toxic- 
exposed veterans, and it ensures that 
the VA has the flexibility to respond 
and adapt to new scientific evidence on 
toxic substances. 
Importantly, it also ensures that vet-
erans who are most in need—those who 
are terminally ill, homeless, elderly, or 
experiencing 
hardship—receive 
their 
benefits immediately so they do not 
have to wait any longer for our govern-
ment to act. 
Madam Speaker, I urge all my col-
leagues to support the PACT Act. This 
bill is not perfect by any means, but we 
should not allow perfect to be the 
enemy of the good. Make no mistake, 
this is a good bill for our Nation’s vet-
erans. I am proud to support this bill 
and I am proud to stand with the men 
and women of our Armed Forces.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H6021 
July 13, 2022 
Mr. TAKANO. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman 
from Michigan (Ms. SLOTKIN), my good 
friend who serves on the Disability As-
sistance and Memorial Affairs Sub-
committee of the Veterans’ Affairs 
Committee. 
Ms. SLOTKIN. Madam Speaker, I rise 
in support of the PACT Act and my bill 
contained within on burn pits. 
Most of us here all know about Agent 
Orange and the horrible effects it had 
on our veterans in Vietnam. We also 
remember how long it took for Con-
gress and the VA to respond and make 
sure our veterans had the care and ben-
efits they needed. 
The bill we will vote on today is a 
landmark piece of legislation that will 
address the Agent Orange of the post-9/ 
11 generation: burn pits. 
For anyone who doesn’t know, burn 
pits are used to dispose of waste on a 
military base, usually abroad in a com-
bat zone, with jet fuel used to light the 
fuse. For years, we have used these 
burn pits in places like Iraq and Af-
ghanistan. I lived near one in Iraq on 
three tours. 
Just as with Agent Orange, we have 
learned over the years that the toxins 
our servicemembers have been exposed 
to have horrible consequences, strange 
cancer diagnoses, respiratory issues 
that have affected millions of veterans, 
including those in Michigan. 
This issue has been deeply personal 
to me as an Army wife and someone 
who lived near those burn pits while 
with the CIA. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentlewoman has expired. 
Mr. TAKANO. Madam Speaker, I 
yield an additional 30 seconds to the 
gentlewoman. 
Ms. SLOTKIN. Madam Speaker, for 
years, 9/11 veterans have walked into 
their local VA center only to be turned 
away. 
Madam Speaker, one of the most im-
portant things I have worked on in my 
short 31⁄2 years here is this bill. It is the 
biggest veterans’ healthcare bill we 
have passed in decades. 
Last week, I visited our local VA in 
Lansing—and they know it is coming— 
another 3.5 veterans will have access to 
healthcare because of this bill. 
We do important things in this body 
all the time, but I think fewer are more 
important than this one we are going 
to vote on today. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues on both sides of the aisle—I am 
glad many of my colleagues on the 
other side of the aisle have switched 
their positions—to now vote on this 
bill. 
Mr. BOST. Madam Speaker, I yield 3 
minutes to the gentleman from Mon-
tana (Mr. ROSENDALE), the ranking 
member of the Technology Moderniza-
tion Subcommittee of the Veterans’ Af-
fairs Committee. 
Mr. ROSENDALE. Madam Speaker, 
the Senate version of the PACT Act 
helps connect veterans who were ex-
posed to burn pits or dangerous toxins 
in service to our country with the 
healthcare and benefits they have 
earned and were promised. 
This legislation also codifies the sci-
entific framework that the VA is al-
ready using to provide benefits to 
toxic-exposed veterans, better reflects 
current practice, and improves trans-
parency. 
The previous House-passed version, 
which I voted against, ignored the 
work the VA is already doing to im-
prove services to toxic-exposed vet-
erans. 
This bill improves and codifies the 
pilot program that the VA established 
last year to extend compensation bene-
fits to toxic-exposed veterans. 
This bill also includes provisions to 
increase transparency, provide flexi-
bility, and keep pace with scientific ad-
vancements for toxic exposure. 
In addition, this legislation includes 
workforce enhancements, and other 
changes, to ensure the VA can improve 
services 
to 
toxic-exposed 
veterans 
without compromising care and bene-
fits. 
The prior House version of the PACT 
Act failed to address the operational 
impact on the VA of servicing the ben-
efits of toxic-exposed veterans, which 
would have left veterans waiting in a 
backlog of 1.5 million claims. This new 
version includes provisions that ad-
dress the operational impacts head-on. 
Madam Speaker, this legislation is 
not perfect. I do not support every-
thing that is in this piece of legisla-
tion. But as the saying goes: We cannot 
let the search for perfect be the enemy 
of the good, or, in this case, what is 
right and necessary. 
Our veterans have waited far too long 
to receive the help that they were 
promised. It is far past time for Con-
gress to stop screwing around, break-
ing our own rules, while America’s vet-
erans suffer and literally die. 
Since my time in Congress began, I 
have been a strong advocate for Mon-
tana veterans, and I work tirelessly in 
the House Veterans’ Affairs Committee 
to ensure that all America’s veterans 
are able to receive the quality care 
that they were promised, and the care 
that they have earned. 
We are willing to spend far too much 
money to engage in conflict, and far 
too little to care for our warriors once 
they come home. 
Madam Speaker, I intend to vote for 
this legislation and I encourage my 
colleagues to do the same. 
Mr. TAKANO. Madam Speaker, I wel-
come the support of the gentleman 
from Montana. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to 
gentleman from California (Mr. RUIZ), 
my good friend and member of the 
House Veterans’ Affairs Committee, 
where he is an active member of the 
Disability Assistance and Memorial Af-
fairs Subcommittee. 
Mr. RUIZ. Madam Speaker, once 
again, we stand at the precipice of 
making a monumental change in the 
lives of our servicemen and service-
women and veterans. 
Yet, here we are voting on the Hon-
oring our PACT Act for the third time 
because of a Senate technical issue. 
Enough is enough. Our veterans do not 
have time for technicalities. Their 
lives are literally on the line. 
As a cofounder of the bipartisan, bi-
cameral Burn Pits Caucus, I have spent 
years fighting to ensure that our vet-
erans exposed to toxins from burn pits 
get the care and benefits they need and 
deserve. 
My bill, the Presumptive Benefits for 
War Fighters Exposed to Burn Pits and 
Other Toxins Act is the foundation 
that the Honoring our PACT Act is 
built on. It removes the burden from 
the veterans to prove that 23 illnesses 
or conditions—including various can-
cers—that they are suffering from are 
due to their service near burn pits. 
Madam Speaker, I implore the House 
to pass this fix to the Senate’s blue slip 
error, and I urge the Senate to pass the 
Honoring our PACT Act immediately. 
Our veterans’ lives are on the line. 
Mr. BOST. Madam Speaker, I yield to 
the 
gentleman 
from 
Texas 
(Mr. 
ELLZEY), a Navy veteran and F–18 
pilot. 
Mr. ELLZEY. Madam Speaker, I 
come before the House of Representa-
tives to discuss the newest and best 
version of the PACT Act before us 
today. 
Putting the needs of our veterans 
first is something we can all agree on. 
On March 3, the House passed a version 
of the PACT Act that was unworkable 
and unaffordable. At that time, I joined 
my colleagues in calling for negotia-
tions and refinements that would best 
help the veterans and gain bipartisan 
support, and I voted ‘‘no’’ on that origi-
nal bill. 
The bill that we have before us today 
is the result of those long and difficult 
negotiations. This version of the bill 
reinforces why I opposed it during the 
initial passage. When we work together 
and put the well-being of veterans 
above partisan politics, we get a work-
able, effective bill that will save the 
lives of those who have given so much 
for us. 
It is not a perfect bill. There remains 
language, including the costs and man-
datory spending that are somewhat 
troubling, but I am confident that we 
will be vigilant about carrying out our 
oversight of the implementation of 
those provisions and the spending asso-
ciated with them. I also call on the 
moneys moved to mandatory spending 
be moved back to discretionary when 
we take back the majority. 
America’s veterans who were exposed 
to toxins during their voluntary mili-
tary service in combat to preserve 
America’s liberty and freedoms will fi-
nally receive the healthcare and bene-
fits they need. 
b 1430 
I support this legislation because it 
requires the VA to contact every single 
veteran who filed a claim for benefits 
that related to toxic exposure but had

the claim originally denied, allowing 
them to refile their claim. I support 
this legislation because it expands the 
screening of possible toxic exposure to 
every veteran receiving VA care. 
America’s obligation to our veterans 
is best conveyed by the words of Abra-
ham Lincoln: ‘‘To care for him who 
shall have borne the battle, and for his 
widow, and his orphan.’’ 
Madam Speaker, I urge all Members 
to vote in favor of the amendments to 
H.R. 3967. 
Mr. TAKANO. Madam Speaker, may I 
inquire as to the time remaining. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from California has 8 minutes 
remaining. The gentleman from Illi-
nois has 10 minutes remaining. 
Mr. TAKANO. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentleman from 
Arizona (Mr. GALLEGO), who is my good 
friend. He is an active member of the 
House Veterans’ Affairs Committee and 
serves on the Economic Opportunity 
Subcommittee. 
Mr. GALLEGO. Madam Speaker, I 
rise in support of the Honoring Our 
PACT Act—overdue, desperately need-
ed legislation providing care for vet-
erans who have been exposed to toxic 
substances while serving their country. 
I am especially grateful for the provi-
sions 
in 
this 
bill 
that 
provide 
healthcare to veterans harmed by burn 
pits. When I was in Iraq, exposure to 
burn pits was an everyday, constant 
fact of life. 
Too many veterans—my dear friends 
from Lima Company 325 and other ma-
rines—are sick from that exposure with 
respiratory diseases, cancer, and other 
chronic conditions that young men 
should not be having right now. 
Too many veterans live in fear that 
their next doctor’s appointment will 
reveal an illness that—in addition to 
harming 
their 
health—could 
drive 
them into bankruptcy because the VA 
refuses to care for them. I am one of 
those people who does have that fear. 
Every day we go without fighting for 
those veterans is a choice to let down 
those who have sacrificed most for our 
Nation. We will not let them down 
today. 
Madam Speaker, I am proud to vote 
for this bill on behalf of my fellow vet-
erans, and I urge all my colleagues to 
join me in doing so. 
Mr. BOST. Madam Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from the 
State of Michigan (Mr. MEIJER). 
Mr. MEIJER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today in support of the Sergeant First 
Class Heath Robinson Honoring our 
PACT Act. 
We have an urgent moral obligation 
to take care of the men and women 
who have served and sacrificed in uni-
form to defend our Nation. I have seen 
the impacts of burn pit and toxic expo-
sure hazards firsthand both as a U.S. 
Army soldier in Iraq and also as some-
body who has served alongside others 
in the Veterans’ Affairs Committee and 
who have constituents today who are 
suffering from those ailments. 
This comprehensive, bipartisan pack-
age will expand VA coverage; and to 
those 3.45 million toxic-exposed vet-
erans, provide the VA additional re-
sources so it can better care for our 
veterans and also create the framework 
for establishing future toxic exposure- 
related presumptions of service connec-
tion so we don’t have to go through 
this again. 
I am especially proud that a bill I in-
troduced last year with my colleague 
from 
Michigan, 
Congresswoman 
SLOTKIN, the Veterans Burn Pit Expo-
sure Recognition Act, was included in 
this final package. 
Madam Speaker, I look forward to 
supporting final passage of this bill, 
and I encourage all my colleagues to 
ensure its swift passage. With this bill, 
we will make good on the promises we 
made to our Nation’s servicemembers 
and veterans. 
Mr. TAKANO. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the distinguished 
gentlewoman 
from 
California 
(Ms. 
PELOSI) who has been a tremendous 
supporter of this legislation. 
Ms. 
PELOSI. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
I 
thank the gentleman for yielding, and 
I thank him for his leadership as chair 
of the Veterans’ Affairs Committee. I 
am grateful for the bipartisan support 
that the bill is receiving here. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today in 
strong support of the landmark Hon-
oring our PACT Act. As you know, 
PACT stands for Promise to Address 
Comprehensive Toxics Act, now named 
after Sergeant First Class Heath Rob-
inson. I am going to talk about him in 
a moment. 
This bipartisan legislation honors 
our duty to deliver healthcare that 
millions of veterans need and that they 
have certainly earned. This is the sec-
ond time the House has voted on this 
important bill, and we are proud that 
after the Senate passes this version, we 
will finally send it to the President to 
be signed into law. 
For their relentless leadership on 
this legislation, let me salute Chair-
man MARK TAKANO and his ranking 
member as well who made addressing 
toxic exposure a top priority in this 
Congress; 
Congressman 
RAUL
RUIZ, 
whose experience as a physician in-
formed a key provision of this bill es-
tablishing presumption of exposure; 
and Congresswoman ELAINE LURIA, a 
Navy veteran who authored a provision 
expanding health benefits to veterans 
exposed to burn pits. 
Also included in this legislation—and 
I am so pleased about it—is legislation 
by Congressman MATT CARTWRIGHT, au-
thor of the Camp Lejeune Justice Act, 
to allow veterans or their loved ones to 
seek damages related to injuries in-
curred while serving at Camp Lejeune. 
We have had many people come from 
the area. The legislators from North 
Carolina, DAVID PRICE and others, have 
been relentless in their pursuit of this 
legislation. Families would come here 
and tell their stories of their loved 
ones’ service at Camp Lejeune where 
the water supply was causing serious 
health problems not only for the serv-
icemember, which would be horrible 
enough, but for their family members 
as well. This is corrected in this legis-
lation and is a very important im-
provement. 
From the deserts of Iraq to the 
mountains of Afghanistan and on the 
bases and military theaters around the 
world, a generation of courageous 
Americans have donned the Stars and 
Stripes to protect our freedom. These 
heroes have put their lives on the line 
to fight the enemy. Yet, tragically, 
many of them have confronted another 
deadly threat: exposure to burn pits 
and toxins which have taken a severe 
toll on their health. 
Make no mistake: burn pit exposures 
are pervasive. Eighty-six percent of the 
Iraq and Afghanistan veterans report 
having been exposed to these toxic 
fumes. I don’t want to go into what is 
in these pits. It is so disgusting. 
They are deadly. The VA has seen 
over a 60 percent increase in rates of 
cancers tied to toxic exposure in the 
last 20 years. But when these veterans 
come home, they are forced into a con-
voluted claims process which cruelly 
saddles them with the burden of proof, 
and nearly three-quarters of burn pit- 
related claims are denied. Think of the 
injustice of that. 
Tragically, this problem is not new 
to our Nation. Many veterans of the 
Vietnam war were forced to wait four 
long decades before their exposure to 
Agent Orange was recognized and they 
could claim benefits. This was, of 
course, addressed with the Blue Water 
Navy Vietnam Act that was passed by 
the Congress in 2019. Some Agent Or-
ange provisions have been in subse-
quent NDAA legislation. 
I know this issue well. Before I was 
in Congress, I was participating in sit- 
ins with hunger strikes for Vietnam 
vets in the early eighties. More than 
one time we were joined by Dick Greg-
ory who had experience in hunger 
strikes for civil rights reasons, and he 
was instructing the veterans on how to 
hydrate, et cetera, so that they could 
survive the hunger strikes hopefully in 
time to make a difference. But it took 
decades. We cannot and will not let 
that happen to another generation. 
There are potentially up to 3.5 mil-
lion veterans deployed after the at-
tacks of September 11—3.5 million de-
ployed since September 11—who may 
have been exposed to toxic fumes and 
substances, and we must act now to 
save lives. 
The PACT Act is a comprehensive 
bill—others have discussed what it 
does—that meets the challenge of toxic 
exposures for veterans in three ways. 
First, 
it 
expands 
access 
to 
VA 
healthcare to post-9/11 combat veterans 
exposed to toxins. Second, it grants 
presumptions of exposure for veterans 
with rare cancers, COPD, and other de-
bilitating diseases. Third, it creates a 
permanent, streamlined process to en-
sure that future Secretaries will review 
and approve new exposure swiftly.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H6023 
July 13, 2022 
Why do we have these burn pits? 
We always keep saying here that on 
the battlefield we leave no soldier be-
hind and when they come home, we 
leave no veteran behind. And yet, they 
come home with hidden injuries— 
whether they are psychological or ex-
posures 
to 
a 
burn 
pit—the 
con-
sequences of which do not show up for 
a while. 
We have spent more than $6 trillion 
recruiting, training, and deploying our 
servicemembers overseas during the 
last 20 years. But let’s be clear: This is 
only part of the price tag. When we 
send our troops into conflict, we have 
to understand that we are responsible 
for the consequences. Burn pit expo-
sure is one of them. Toxic exposures 
are a cost of war, and we must treat it 
as such. This is not a question of dol-
lars. It is a matter of values. 
In all of the Congress’ work for vet-
erans, it is imperative that veterans’ 
groups, our veterans, their families, 
and the veterans service organizations, 
the VSOs, are not only at the table, but 
they are also leading the way. Mr. 
TAKANO has been a leader at that table 
for years. 
The overwhelming support of VSOs, 
especially a group now called Burn Pits 
360, was absolutely crucial to crafting 
this bill, steering it through the legis-
lative process, and securing its passage 
in the House today. 
I have quoted Lincoln over and over 
again. Lincoln said: ‘‘Public sentiment 
is everything. With it, nothing can fail; 
against it, nothing can succeed.’’ 
Well, our veterans caused public sen-
timent to be aroused to such a point 
that here we are getting this done. 
They enlisted Jon Stewart and John 
Feal, two people who had been there 
with us on the 9/11 health benefits for 
people exposed at the time of 9/11. And 
they had been real champions in the 
public visibility of this issue; not only 
to help mobilize support for us to pass 
it, but to give hope to people who have 
been affected to know that there is a 
chance that this can be accomplished. 
So I thank Jon Stewart, and I thank 
John Feal. 
At the same time, it is with great 
pride and patriotism that the PACT 
Act has strong bipartisan and bi-
cameral support worthy of our heroic 
veterans. This Congress is also grateful 
to Secretary McDonough, the VA, and 
the entire administration for their sup-
port. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank President Biden 
for making this a priority in his State 
of the Union Address, especially when 
he talked about his beloved son, Beau. 
Madam Speaker, since we passed the 
PACT Act, it has been renamed. It has 
a new name of a veteran we lost from 
toxic exposure. 
Sergeant First Class Heath Robinson 
was exposed to burn pits while de-
ployed to Kosovo and Iraq, and after-
ward he battled a rare, deadly lung 
cancer. Sadly, he died in 2020 at just 
age 39, leaving behind his wife and 
daughter. Today, in his memory, we re-
double our efforts to ensure tragic sto-
ries like his can never happen again. 
He is representative of so many other 
stories and the toll that this has taken. 
Again, we say that when our troops 
go to war on the battlefield, we leave 
no soldier behind. When they come 
home, we leave no veteran behind. Our 
PACT Act is an historic victory for our 
veterans and for their advocacy that 
honors that pledge now and for the fu-
ture. 
Madam Speaker, I urge a bipartisan 
vote on the Honoring our PACT Act. I 
hope it will be almost unanimous. I 
look forward to seeing it swiftly passed 
by the Senate and signed into law by 
the President. 
Madam Speaker, again, I am grateful 
for the leadership of Mr. TAKANO. 
b 1445 
Mr. BOST. Madam Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from Florida 
(Mr. BILIRAKIS), a gentleman who has 
served on this committee and has un-
derstood these issues for all of his time 
in Congress. 
Mr. BILIRAKIS. Madam Speaker, in-
spired by the story of my constituent 
Lauren Price, I first filed comprehen-
sive burn pit legislation with my col-
league, Congressman RUIZ, in 2018. 
Lauren developed a terminal illness 
due to her exposure to burn pit toxins 
in Iraq. Despite her illness, she was 
passionate about making sure her 
brothers and sisters in arms would fi-
nally be able to access the medical care 
and benefits they have earned. Lauren 
worked tirelessly to help me craft leg-
islation and testified at multiple con-
gressional hearings. 
Since 2018, I have continued to work 
with my colleagues in the House and 
the Senate to push this critical issue 
forward. 
While 
Lauren 
tragically 
passed before she was able to get help, 
today, finally, we will pass the PACT 
Act to make sure no other veterans 
have to go through what Lauren went 
through. 
Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I so wel-
come the support of the gentleman 
from Florida. He got it right the first 
time. He voted ‘‘yes’’ the first time. I 
know he is going to vote ‘‘yes’’ the sec-
ond time. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the 
gentlewoman 
from 
Minnesota 
(Ms. 
OMAR), my good friend who serves on 
the Education and Labor Committee 
and the Foreign Affairs Committee. 
Ms. OMAR. Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
in support of the Honoring our PACT 
Act. I thank Chairman TAKANO
for 
yielding and for his incredible leader-
ship on this bill. 
We ask young men and women to 
serve our country in uniform. We 
should not also be asking them to be 
exposing their bodies to toxins and to 
live with the consequences of those 
toxins for the rest of their lives. 
Whether it is Agent Orange in Viet-
nam or burn pits or other toxic expo-
sures in Iraq and Afghanistan, this has 
been part of our military’s history. 
This bill helps us correct the historic 
injustices for veterans and commu-
nities like the ones in Camp Lejeune, 
North Carolina. 
I am proud today that we will pass 
the most comprehensive legislation in 
decades to address the severe health 
problems that so many of our veterans 
are facing and to make it easier for 
them to get the relief and the care they 
need. 
Mr. Speaker, thousands of my con-
stituents will benefit from what we are 
doing here today, and it is my great 
honor to support this bill. 
Mr. BOST. Mr. Speaker, I yield 11⁄2 
minutes to the gentleman from Geor-
gia (Mr. CARTER), a gentleman who is 
very much in support of our veterans. 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
Mr. Speaker, today, I rise in support 
of H.R. 3967, the Honoring our PACT 
Act. However, I want to make sure that 
my colleagues across the aisle know 
how disappointed I am in these budget 
gimmicks that have become a part of 
this final legislation. 
As many of you are aware, I have the 
honor and privilege of representing the 
First Congressional District of Geor-
gia. We have every branch of the mili-
tary in our district. With every branch 
represented in my district, I take pride 
in my ability to serve and aid our men 
and women in uniform. 
I promised them I would vote for this 
bill. I am going to vote for this bill. 
But I do so begrudgingly, and the rea-
son why is because I think it is des-
picable, Mr. Speaker, that my col-
leagues on the other side of the aisle 
are using our veterans in order to gain 
the ability to use billions of dollars, al-
most $700 billion, on pet projects that 
they want to spend on. I think that is 
a slap in the face of our veterans. 
Our veterans did not sacrifice, did 
not serve, in order to bankrupt our 
country. But that is what our col-
leagues on the other side of the aisle 
want to do. 
Now, they deserve this. They need it. 
There is no question about that. Any-
one who votes for it or against it 
agrees they need this, and we are going 
to make sure they get it. But I want to 
make sure that the point is made that 
this is despicable to use a budget gim-
mick like this against our veterans in 
order to be able to fund pet projects 
that my colleagues on the other side of 
the aisle want to fund. 
Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I wel-
come the even begrudging ‘‘yes’’ vote 
from the gentleman from Georgia. I 
will just say there is no budget gim-
mick here. This vote is going to unite 
America. It is going to heal America. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the 
gentlewoman from Michigan (Mrs. DIN-
GELL), my good friend who serves on 
the Energy and Commerce Committee 
and the Natural Resources Committee. 
Mrs. DINGELL. Mr. Speaker, I rise in 
support of the Honoring our PACT Act. 
Toxic 
exposure 
has 
devastating 
health consequences for our veterans,

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H6024 
July 13, 2022 
including many in my district. I talk 
to them every week when I am home. 
One is the Michigan president of the 
VFW, Kevin Hensley, who is a veteran 
of the U.S. Air Force who was sta-
tioned near open burn pits and has 
been diagnosed with several severe ill-
nesses after inhaling that toxic smoke. 
Despite his sacrifices and his dedica-
tion yet today, he faces challenges 
every day receiving care through the 
VA, and that is simply unacceptable. 
With the passage and enactment of 
this legislation, we can lift the barriers 
that have been blocking veterans from 
accessing the life-changing care they 
need. This bipartisan package will ex-
pand healthcare access to veterans 
across the country, and it will finally 
ensure that veterans receive the sup-
port they deserve. 
I thank the chairman of the Vet-
erans’ Affairs Committee for his lead-
ership in advancing the PACT Act, the 
ranking member, and all the members 
of the Veterans’ Affairs Committee. 
Mr. BOST. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from Ohio 
(Mr. DAVIDSON). 
Mr. DAVIDSON. Mr. Speaker, during 
deployments and war, the military in-
cinerated waste in large burn pits. 
Many contained hazardous materials 
that emitted toxic fumes. Our veterans 
have long suffered from the practice, 
but the VA has not been able to ade-
quately recognize the effects and pro-
vide care for those who suffer from 
such exposures. 
To be clear, this is not a benefit. It is 
a moral obligation to care for these 
veterans. 
It is not a great bill. Congress has al-
ready squandered two decades trying to 
do the right thing here. When BP 
spilled oil and contaminated the Gulf, 
their responsibility for cleanup was not 
optional. Why should America’s gov-
ernment have less responsibility for 
the harm caused to our veterans? 
It is free to join our military, but for 
some, service costs everything. Others 
return with wounds that are seen and 
unseen. We must recognize the cost of 
war, and the bill for our veterans 
harmed by toxic burn pits is long over-
due. Please pass this bill. 
Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I have no 
further speakers. I am prepared to 
close, and I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. BOST. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. 
While I wholeheartedly support the 
intent of the PACT Act and intend to 
vote for it, I am opposed to the prece-
dent that the funding mechanism in 
this bill sets. 
Later, I will be offering a motion to 
commit that would prohibit creation of 
the cost of war toxic exposure fund. 
Democrats are using the fund to move 
almost $400 billion of existing VA 
healthcare spending from the discre-
tionary to the mandatory side of the 
ledger for purposes completely unre-
lated to veterans. 
We should not use this bill to create 
more entitlement spending. That is 
dangerous, and it is a very dangerous 
budget ploy. It will put more spending 
on autopilot. It will limit our ability to 
do our job, constitutionally, of over-
sight of the second-largest bureaucracy 
in the world that serves millions of 
veterans and survivors. It will hurt 
taxpayers who are already suffering ev-
erywhere, from the gas pump to the 
grocery store. 
My motion to commit is simple, and 
I hope my colleagues will support it. 
Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous con-
sent to include the text of the amend-
ment in the RECORD immediately prior 
to the vote on the motion to commit. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. KIL-
MER). Is there objection to the request 
of the gentleman from Illinois? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. BOST. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the 
balance of my time. 
Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself the balance of my time. 
I am delighted that the ranking 
member is offering his support for this 
bill. I accept that support, but I do not 
accept his objections. 
This bill, I mean, yes, I do say that 
we are creating entitlements. But the 
entitlements we are creating are 3.5 
million 
veterans 
eligible 
for 
healthcare, veterans that were exposed 
to toxic substances. We are conceding 
exposure to them. We are making it 
possible for them to not have to fight 
their government. 
Yes, we are creating entitlements 
with our 23 presumptive illnesses. It is 
going to mean that those veterans are 
entitled to benefits, and their families 
will be entitled to benefits, so those 
veterans that are suffering from ter-
minal illnesses are not going to have to 
worry about their families being with-
out resources after they pass. 
Mr. Speaker, I ask that all of my col-
leagues join me in finally doing what is 
right and passing this very important 
piece of legislation, S. 3373, as amend-
ed. I hope we get 400 votes. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
Mr. BOST. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self the balance of my time. 
Nineteen months ago, when I took 
over as the lead Republican on the Vet-
erans’ Affairs Committee, I told my 
colleagues that helping toxic-exposed 
veterans was my top priority. Today, I 
am proud to say that we are delivering 
on that promise. 
It was not an easy road to get here, 
but the PACT Act will make a dif-
ference for veterans, their families, and 
their survivors. 
Today, I am thinking of veterans like 
Lauren Price, Heath Robinson, Kate 
Hendricks 
Thomas, 
veterans 
who 
raised their right hands like I did. 
They did their duty, and they did it 
well. But unlike me, their lives were 
cut short. 
They were young, seemingly healthy 
adults who had endured a different bat-
tle on the stateside. Their lives were 
changed in an instant when they devel-
oped rare cancers in the blink of an 
eye, possibly due to their repeated ex-
posure to burning chemicals while they 
served overseas. 
Lauren left behind her husband, Jim, 
and five children. Heath left behind his 
wife and a young daughter. Kate left 
behind her husband and a young son. 
The bill we will vote on today is in 
honor of them and the hundreds of 
thousands of veterans just like them. 
Lauren, Heath, and Kate left us too 
soon and would want us to do every-
thing in our power to try to prevent 
what happened to them from happening 
to their fellow brothers and sisters in 
arms. 
The PACT Act will grant their wish 
for generations. It will help over 3 mil-
lion veterans get the care and benefits 
they are due before it is too late. 
We have made this mistake in the 
past. We don’t need to make it again. 
We need to move forward with this bill, 
and we will work in a bipartisan way to 
make sure that is exactly what hap-
pens once it is signed into law and im-
plemented by the VA. 
Mr. Speaker, I encourage my col-
leagues to support the bill, and I yield 
back the balance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. All time 
for debate has expired. 
Pursuant to House Resolution 1224, 
the previous question is ordered on the 
bill, as amended. 
The question is on third reading of 
the bill. 
The bill was ordered to be read a 
third time and was read a third time.

under subsection (b) has occurred and that such

terparts.

sioned officers able to operate through the intel-
lectual demands of complex contingencies, pro-
ducing military leaders at rates higher than is 
otherwise feasible with the pool of eligible offi-
cers. 
(4) Conducting research and analysis on the 
impact of advanced education on enlisted 
servicemembers performance, promotion rate, 
misconduct, and retention is critical to propel-
ling the Department of Defense’s initiatives for 
a modern, state-of-the art approach to edu-
cation and research to create and sustain an in-
tellectual overmatch in today’s warfighting do-
mains. 
(5) The Naval Postgraduate School serves as a 
converging point for all branches of the United 
States military while simultaneously offering in-
novative learning environments that, combined, 
offers an ideal testing ground to evaluate the 
potential benefits of expanding enlisted higher 
education across the Joint Force.

section 8545 of title 10, United States Code, is

basis’’ and inserting ‘‘at a rate of acceptance 
not to be conditioned by the number of officer 
applications’’. 
(c) BRIEFING.—Six years after the date of the 
enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Defense 
shall brief the Committees on Armed Services of 
the Senate and House of Representatives on the 
effects of increasing enrollment of enlisted mem-
bers at the Naval Postgraduate School pursuant

(a) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of 
Congress that— 
(1) there are well documented administrative 
issues with current and former Special Immi-
grant Visa programs that significantly increase 
the application timeline and impact applicants 
seeking to verify their eligibly for these pro-
grams; 
(2) administrative issues such a verification of 
employment, characterization of service, per-
sonnel data, and biographical data needed for 
employment by a local national employee but 
not centrally maintained should not be a barrier 
for an applicant who has put themselves or 
their family at risk by providing faithful and 
valuable service in support the United States 
Government; 
(3) upon studying existing databases within 
the federal government, none meet the require-
ment that would provide a centralized database 
that all federal departments and agencies could 
utilize to ensure that in the future, eligible ap-
plicants do not have applications delayed or de-
nied due to missing administrative data; 
(4) the creation of such a database, exercising 
current privacy data control policies, would 
streamline the application process and provide 
independent and centralized verification that 
an applicant is indeed eligible for the program; 
and 
(5) Special Immigrant Visa programs are con-
sistent with our national values, and therefore, 
it is an obligation to make sure the accurate 
data necessary to verify and complete these ap-
plications expeditiously is available when need-
ed. 
(b) DATABASE.—Not later than one year after 
the date of enactment of this Act, the Secretary 
of Defense, in coordination with the Secretary 
of State, shall establish and maintain a data-

subcontractor (at any tier) of the Department of 
Defense, the Department of State, or any other 
agency or instrumentality of the Executive 
branch in a theater of combat operations. This 
section and the requirements of this section 
shall be carried out consistent with the Privacy 
Act of 1974. 
(c) REQUIREMENTS.—The database established 
under subsection (b) shall be electronic and 
searchable, and shall include, with respect to 
each foreign national so listed, the following:

of future capabilities; 
(5) the delivery of a nuclear-powered sub-

require the appropriate training and develop-
ment of future commanding officers to operate 
such submarines for the Royal Australian Navy; 
and

SPACE NEAR WIND TURBINES. 
(a) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of 
Congress that— 
(1) renewable energy development is expand-
ing rapidly as the United States continues to in-
vest in diversifying its energy portfolio; 
(2) this expansion has to be carefully consid-
ered in its potential impacts to low-level military 
training routes and special use airspace of the 
Department of Defense; 
(3) it is imperative that the United States pre-
serves access to national airspace for military 
test and training and activities to ensure mili-
tary readiness while facilitating deployment of 
renewable energy projects, such as wind tur-
bines, that enhance national and economic se-
curity in ways that are compatible with military 
airspace needs; and 
(4) the rapid proliferation of wind turbines 
around the world may require the Armed Forces 
to develop tactics, training, and procedures for 
operations in the vicinity of wind turbines in 
order to exploit potential adversaries’ turbines 
for tactical advantage. 
(b) STUDY AND REPORT.— 
(1) IN
GENERAL.—The Secretary of Defense 
shall seek to enter into an agreement with a fed-
erally funded research and development center

ing described in paragraph (1), taking into con-
sideration— 
(i) the operational and training needs of the 
Armed Forces; and 
(ii) the threat environments of adversaries of 
the United States, including the People’s Repub-
lic of China; 
(B) identify possibilities for combining live, 
virtual, and constructive flight training near 
wind projects, both onshore and offshore; 
(C) describe the airspace inventory required 
for low-level training proficiency given current 
and projected force structures; 
(D) provide recommendations for redesigning 
and properly sizing special use air space and 
military training routes to combine live and syn-
thetic training in a realistic environment; 
(E) describe ongoing research and develop-
ment programs being utilized to mitigate impacts 
of wind turbines on low-level training routes; 
and 
(F) identify current training routes impacted 
by wind turbines, any previous training routes 
that are no longer in use because of wind tur-
bines, and any training routes projected to be 
lost due to wind turbines.

(2) The term ‘‘impacted by wind turbines’’ 
means a situation in which the presence of wind 
turbines in the area of a low-level military 
training route or special use airspace— 
(A) prompted the Department of Defense to 
alter a testing and training mission or to reduce 
previously planned training activities; or 
(B) prevented the Department from meeting

Subtitle E—Matters Relating to Europe and 
NATO 
SEC. 1261. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON UNITED 
STATES DEFENSE POSTURE IN EU-
ROPE FOLLOWING THE FURTHER IN-
VASION OF UKRAINE. 
It is the sense of Congress as follows: 
(1) The further invasion of Ukraine presents a 
sea change to the security environment in Eu-
rope that requires a long-term shift in the force 
posture of the United States and its allies, in 
order to ensure the maintenance of collective de-
terrence. As General Milley, Chairman of the 
Joint Chiefs, recently noted, ‘‘We are witness to 
the greatest threat to peace and security of Eu-
rope and perhaps the world in my 42 years of 
service in uniform. The Russian invasion of 
Ukraine is threatening to undermine not only 
European peace and stability but global peace 
and stability. . . . We are at a pivot point in the 
geostrategic history of Europe and perhaps the 
globe.’’. 
(2) Adjustments to force posture in Europe 
must be commensurate to this challenge. Along-
side allied investments, it is necessary for the 
United States to alter its force posture to estab-
lish additional permanently stationed and con-
tinuous rotational forces along Europe’s eastern 
flank. Given the current conditions, it would be 
untenable for the United States to seek to revert 
to United States force levels and positioning 
present in Europe before Russia’s further inva-
sion of Ukraine, to rely solely on allied forces 
for further force posture enhancements, or 
adopt a path to transition away from invest-
ments in Europe through the European Deter-
rence Initiative (EDI), except for exceptional 
cases. 
(3) As General Tod Wolters, Commander of 
U.S. European Command, has stated, invest-
ments made through EDI since 2014 have proved 
essential to the United States ability to respond 
to the Ukraine crisis, deploying units in 5 days 
that would have taken as long as 21 days. Gen-
eral Wolters further stated, ‘‘To take an Ar-
mored Brigade Combat Team and launch it from 
the continental United States, and put it on Eu-
ropean turf, and have the tanks that comprise 
that Brigade Combat Team to shoot, move, and 
communicate and fire on range in one week is 
an amazing accomplishment. And that was fa-
cilitated by those Army Prepositioned Stocks 
and it was practiced in previous exercises which 
are part of the EDI fund. I would just say that 
when we demonstrated to the European commu-
nity, and to the NATO community, and to the 
world how well we can shoot, move, and com-
municate and transition a large force from 
CONUS to Europe at that pace, it’s something 
that demonstrates the great value of EDI.’’. 
(4) Past decisions made by the Department of 
Defense and Congress about prepositioned 
stocks, mobility, and funding for EDI led di-
rectly to this ability to quickly reinforce the 
area of operations in this crisis, and EDI invest-
ments will be crucial for adaptation to the new 
European security environment. The Depart-
ment of Defense should continue to strongly 
support EDI investments with a focus on adapt-
ing deterrence to the new security environment 
and incorporating lessons learned from the con-
flict in Ukraine, and it should not seek a path 
to EDI’s sunset. 
(5) The United States recognizes that strong 
alliances and partnerships are crucial to the 
maintenance of United States national and 
global security. The NATO alliance has grown 
more robust and more united in response to Rus-
sia’s aggression in Ukraine. Members of NATO 
have announced substantial changes in their 
defense commitments, adopting measures to meet 
and exceed their Wales Pledge commitments to 
spend 2 percent of Gross Domestic Product on 
defense and increasing commitments to NATO 
battle group and air policing missions, while 
sending vital defense assistance to Ukraine. 
Congress commends such members of NATO for 
their adoption and sustainment of these efforts.

Such commitments are vital to the long-term ef-
fort required to maintain deterrence in the Eu-
ropean theater. The United States should con-
tinue to work with allies on complementary in-
vestments to establish in Europe a mature, fully 
integrated deterrence platform capable of re-
sponding to the expanded threat of Russian ag-
gression and supporting NATO allies’ ongoing 
efforts to collectively resist direct and hybrid 
threats to shared values, interests, and ideals. 
(6) The United States should also redouble ef-
forts to assist NATO allies, particularly on Eu-
rope’s eastern periphery, in modernizing and in-
tegrating their defense capabilities taking into 
account lessons from Russia’s war in Ukraine, 
including efforts to provide artillery, MLRS, 
MANPADS, air defenses, and other capabilities. 
(7) As it reinforces deterrence, the United 
States should recognize the acute risks now fac-
ing allies on Russia’s periphery and pursue na-
tional security investments and strategies com-
mensurate to the challenge, including addi-
tional EDI programs, in the Black Sea, the Bal-
tics, the Arctic, and Central Europe, in order to 
maintain the credibility of the ‘‘sacred obliga-
tion under Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty 
to defend every inch of NATO territory.’’. 
(8) Likewise, the United States should keep in 
mind the particularly significant challenges 
posed to non-NATO European partners and seek 
security strategies to continue cooperation and 
support their sovereign rights, while also pur-
suing security policies that support stability in 
areas of substantial malign effort such as the 
Western Balkans. 
(9) The United States continues to recognize 
the importance of the long-term Baltic Security 
Initiative assistance plan that the Department 
of Defense is carrying out under section 333 of 
title 10, United States Code, and the crucial role 
that such investments play in deterring Russian 
aggression in that region.

against North Korean military aggression and 
as a critical support platform for national secu-
rity engagements in the Indo-Pacific region; 
(3) the presence of approximately 28,500 mem-
bers of the United States Armed Forces deployed 
to South Korea serves not only as a stabilizing 
force to the Korean peninsula but also as a re-
assurance to all our allies in the region; and 
(4) the United States should continue to—

vided by the United States to Taiwan in July 
1982 are the foundation for United States-Tai-
wan relations; 
(2) as set forth in the Taiwan Relations Act, 
the United States decision to establish diplo-
matic relations with the People’s Republic of 
China rests upon the expectation that the future 
of Taiwan will be determined by peaceful 
means, and that any effort to determine the fu-
ture of Taiwan by other than peaceful means, 
including boycotts and embargoes, is of grave 
concern to the United States; 
(3) the increasingly coercive and aggressive 
behavior of the People’s Republic of China to-
ward Taiwan is contrary to the expectation of 
the peaceful resolution of the future of Taiwan; 
(4) as set forth in the Taiwan Relations Act, 
the capacity to resist any resort to force or other 
forms of coercion that would jeopardize the se-
curity, or the social or economic system, of the 
people on Taiwan should be maintained; 
(5) the United States should continue to sup-
port the development of capable, ready, and 
modern defense forces necessary for Taiwan to 
maintain a sufficient self-defense capability, in-
cluding by— 
(A) supporting acquisition by Taiwan of de-
fense articles and services through foreign mili-
tary sales, direct commercial sales, and indus-
trial cooperation, with an emphasis on capabili-
ties that support the asymmetric defense strat-
egy of Taiwan, including anti- ship, coastal de-
fense, anti-armor, air defense, undersea war-
fare, advanced command, control, communica-
tions, computers, intelligence, surveillance, and 
reconnaissance, and resilient command and con-
trol capabilities; 
(B) ensuring timely review of and response to 
requests of Taiwan for defense articles and serv-
ices; 
(C) conducting practical training and military 
exercises with Taiwan that enable Taiwan to 
maintain a sufficient self- defense capability, as 
described in the Taiwan Relations Act; 
(D) exchanges between defense officials and 
officers of the United States and Taiwan at the 
strategic, policy, and functional levels, con-
sistent with the Taiwan Travel Act (Public Law 
115-135; 132 Stat. 341), especially for the pur-
poses of— 
(i) enhancing cooperation on defense plan-
ning; 
(ii) improving the interoperability of the mili-
tary forces of the United States and Taiwan; 
and 
(iii) improving the reserve force of Taiwan; 
(E) identifying improvements in Taiwan’s 
ability to use asymmetric military capabilities to 
enhance its defensive capabilities, as described 
in the Taiwan Relations Act; and 
(F) expanding cooperation in humanitarian 
assistance and disaster relief; and 
(6) the United States should be committed to 
the defense of a free and open society in the 
face of aggressive efforts by the Government of 
the People’s Republic of China to curtail or in-
fluence the free exercise of rights and demo-
cratic franchise.

SEC. 1606. ALLIED RESPONSIVE SPACE CAPABILI-
TIES. 
(a) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of 
Congress that— 
(1) it is in the common interest of the United 
States and allies and partners of the United 
States to strive for accessibility and flexibility 
for delivering assets into space on a responsive 
timeline; 
(2) the United States should implement joint 
United States-allied space missions that dem-
onstrate rapid, rapid launch, reconstitution and 
satellite augmentation from locations in the 
Indo-Pacific, European, and other theaters of 
operations; 
(3) the United States should leverage allied 
and 
partner 
spaceports 
to 
diversify 
and 
disaggregate launch sites across the world for a 
multitude of missions, including national secu-
rity missions; and 
(4) it is important for the United States to 
have operational and contracting steps estab-
lished with allies and partners to ensure readi-
ness and preparedness for responding to or de-
terring any unknown threats. 
(b) INITIATIVES.—The Secretary of the Defense 
and the Secretary of State shall jointly— 
(1) ensure that responsive space capabilities of 
the Department of Defense align with initiatives 
by Five Eyes countries, member states of the 
North Atlantic Treaty Organization, and other 
allies to promote a globally responsive space ar-
chitecture; and 
(2) designate a single official responsible for 
coordinating responsive space activities with al-
lied partners. 
(c) REPORT.—Not later than 180 days after the 
date of the enactment of this Act, the Secretary 
of Defense and the Secretary of State, in coordi-
nation with the Commander of the United States 
European Command, the Commander of the

mander of the United States Space Command, 
and the Secretary of State, shall jointly submit 
to the congressional defense committees, the 
Committee on Foreign Affairs of the House of 
Representatives, and the Committee on Foreign 
Relations of the Senate a report assessing cur-
rent investments and partnerships by the United 
States with allies of the United States with re-
spect to responsive space efforts. The report 
shall include the following: 
(1) An assessment of the benefits of leveraging 
allied and partner spaceports for responsive 
launch. 
(2) A discussion of current and future plans to 
engage with allies and partners with respect to 
activities ensuring rapid reconstitution or aug-
mentation of the space capabilities of the United 
States and allies.

SEC. 1607. REPORT ON TACTICALLY RESPONSIVE 
SPACE CAPABILITIES. 
(a) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of 
Congress that— 
(1) the Space Safari tactically responsive 
launch-2 mission of the Space Systems Com-
mand of the Space Force successfully dem-
onstrated the ability of the Space Force to rap-
idly integrate, launch, and operate a satellite on 
orbit on a timeline that would be needed for 
rapid reconstitution or to respond to real-time 
hostile activities occurring in the domain; 
(2) the Space Force should continue these ef-
forts, and broaden the program beyond the lo-
gistics of launch and operations to also focus on 
lifecycle concepts of operation, as well as any 
contractual mechanisms that should be required 
in future programs to take into account the 
need for rapid reconstitution and responsive-
ness; 
(3) the Chief of Space Operations should for-
malize tactically responsive requirements for all 
space capabilities carried out under title 10, 
United States Code; and 
(4) to take into totality the effort required for 
tactically responsive launch, the Space Force 
should consider adding a corresponding budget 
line item for ‘‘Tactically Responsive Space’’ to 
fund areas beyond launch that would con-
tribute to responsive space activities. 
(b) REPORT.—Not later than 30 days after the 
date on which the budget of the President for 
fiscal year 2024 is submitted to Congress pursu-
ant to section 1105 of title 31, United States 
Code, the Chief of Space Operations shall sub-
mit to the congressional defense committees a re-
port on planned tactically responsive space ac-
tivities pursuant to section 1609 of the William 
M. (Mac) Thornberry National Defense Author-
ization Act for Fiscal Year 2021 (Public Law 
116–283; 10 U.S.C. 2271 note) included during the 
period covered by the most recent future-years 
defense program submitted under section 221 of 
title 10, United States Code (as of the date of the 
report), including a detailed budget plan for 
launch activities and all other efforts needed to 
enable tactically responsive space capabilities. 
SEC. 1608. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON RANGE OF 
THE FUTURE AND SUPPORT TO COM-
MERCIAL SPACE LAUNCH ACTIVITY. 
It is the sense of Congress that— 
(1) section 1610 of the National Defense Au-
thorization Act for Fiscal Year 2022 contained a 
provision requiring the United States Space 
Force to deliver a report on its Range of the Fu-
ture initiative; 
(2) based on the details in that report, that 
the Nation’s launch service providers, consistent 
with decades of national policy, now lead the 
world in space access, that United States leader-
ship in this strategic capability is critical to na-
tional security and economic vitality, and that 
it is critical to the Nation to continue encour-
aging and enabling United States space access 
capabilities to flourish; 
(3) the rapid growth of the commercial launch 
industry places a growing demand on Depart-
ment of Defense resources at Federal space 
launch ranges, and that this demand growth 
will continue for the foreseeable future; 
(4) the 1960s-era infrastructure of the two De-
partment of Defense launch ranges primarily re-
sponsible for meeting its assured access to space 
mission under section 2273 of title 10, United 
States Code, and complying with section 2276 of 
such title, is under increasing strain, and needs 
to be replaced with a modern, state of the art 
launch infrastructure that encourages and en-
ables continued growth and leadership in space 
access; 
(5) maintenance of common use critical infra-
structure like roads, culverts, bridges, deluge 
and water treatment facilities, supply lines, and 
electrical networks, among others, require imme-
diate attention; 
(6) investments in infrastructure have not 
kept pace with commercial demand primarily 
due to existing authorities which limit reim-
bursement, flexible financial investment facili-
ties, and reinvestment of revenue in spaceport 
sustainment, modernization, and growth; 
(7) the burgeoning commercial space industry 
requires a more holistic, responsive process 
leveraging public and private investment; 
(8) the Department of Defense is constrained 
to provide services to commercial users only 
when not needed for public use, yet at the same 
time must promote commercial space launch ca-
pabilities as a critical enabler to national secu-
rity; 
(9) the United States Space Force has made 
great use of existing authorities and those pro-
vided by other non-Federal entities to leverage 
other sources of commercial and State invest-
ment to keep pace with demand; 
(10) a similar State business development enti-
ty would be useful for supporting commercial 
space launch capability development in Cali-
fornia at Vandenberg Space Force Base and 
other spaceports, and Congress looks forward to

the Chairman and Vice Chairman of the Joint 
Chiefs of Staff and the Commander of United 
States Strategic Command, have offered their 
support for continued research and development 
of a nuclear-capable sea-launched cruise missile 
to strengthen nuclear deterrence. 
(2) Deploying a nuclear-capable sea-launched 
cruise missile on naval vessels would ‘‘not come 
without a cost’’, as was testified by Chief of 
Naval Operations Admiral Mike Gilday. Admiral 
Gilday described the challenges associated with 
training, sustainability, reliability, and readi-
ness that would be associated with adding a nu-
clear mission and went on to say that he was 
‘‘not convinced yet that we need to make a 
$31,000,000,000 investment in that particular sys-
tem to close that particular gap’’. Instead, he 
recommended keeping ‘‘a small amount of 
money’’ for research and development of the nu-
clear-capable sea-launched cruise missile as the 
Department of Defense seeks to better under-
stand the implications of living with two nu-
clear-armed peer competitors. 
(b) REPORTS.— 
(1) DETERRENCE.—Not later than 270 days 
after the date of the enactment of this Act, the 
Secretary of the Defense shall submit to the con-
gressional defense committees a report that de-
scribes the approach by the Department of De-
fense for deterring theater nuclear employment 
by Russia and China, including— 
(A) an assessment of the current and future 
theater nuclear capabilities and doctrine of Rus-
sia and China; 
(B) an explanation of the strategy and capa-
bilities of the United States for deterring theater 
nuclear employment; and 
(C) a comparative assessment of options for 
strengthening deterrence of theater nuclear em-
ployment, including pursuit of the nuclear-ca-
pable sea-launched cruise missile and other po-
tential changes to the nuclear and conventional 
posture and capabilities of the United States. 
(2) COST.—Not later than 270 days after the 
date of the enactment of this Act, the Secretary 
of the Navy shall submit to the congressional 
defense committees a report that describes the 
full cost of developing, producing, fielding, and 
maintaining 
nuclear-capable 
sea-launched 
cruise missiles through at least 2050, including— 
(A) the costs associated with research and de-
velopment and production of the missile; 
(B) the costs associated with modifications to 
port infrastructure; 
(C) the costs associated with nuclear certifi-
cation, personnel training, and operations; and 
(D) any other incremental costs compared to 
sustaining and operating nonnuclear naval ves-
sels. 
(3) 
OPERATIONAL
LIMITATIONS.—Not 
later 
than 270 days after the date of the enactment of 
this Act, the Secretary of the Navy shall submit 
to the congressional defense committees a report 
that describes any operational limitations and 
trade-offs that would be associated with deploy-
ing nuclear-capable sea-launched cruise missiles 
on naval vessels, including— 
(A) the effect of allocating missile or torpedo 
tubes from conventional munitions to nuclear 
munitions; 
(B) operational constraints and trade-offs as-
sociated with reserving or limiting naval vessels 
on account of nuclear mission requirements; 
(C) trade-offs in posture and capabilities that 
the Navy would likely face if the Navy had to 
allocate more resources to a nuclear-capable 
missiles; and 
(D) any other issues identified by the Sec-
retary. 
(4) DEVELOPMENT.—Not later than 270 days 
after the date of the enactment of this Act, the 
Administrator for Nuclear Security shall submit 
to the congressional defense committees a report 
that describes the cost and timeline of devel-
oping and producing a warhead for a nuclear- 
capable sea-launched cruise missile, including— 
(A) the cost of developing, producing, and 
sustaining the warhead; 
(B) the timeline for the design, production, 
and fielding of the warhead; and 
(C) an assessment of how the pursuit of the 
warhead would affect other planned warhead 
activities of the National Nuclear Security Ad-
ministration, including whether there would be 
risk to the cost and schedule of other warhead 
programs of the Administration if the Adminis-
trator added a nuclear-capable sea-launched 
cruise missile warhead to the portfolio of such 
programs. 
(5) PREFERRED COURSE OF ACTION.—To inform 
the reports under this subsection, not later than 
30 days after the date of the enactment of this 
Act, the Secretary of Defense shall submit to the 
congressional defense committees a report iden-
tifying one or more preferred courses of action 
from among the actions identified in the anal-
ysis of alternatives for a nuclear-capable sea- 
launched cruise missile.

tecture in the budget request of the President for 
fiscal year 2023 makes a needed and significant 
shift to a more resilient and robust capability 
that will be necessary to address future threats 
in the domain; 
(2) the tranche 1 and 2 capabilities of the 
Space Development Agency are critical to such 
new architecture and should continue to be 
funded appropriately to deliver missile track 
and warning capability from low-Earth orbit in 
the mid-2020s timeframe; 
(3) section 1645 of the William M. (Mac) 
Thornberry National Defense Authorization Act 
for Fiscal Year 2021 (Public Law 116–283; 134 
Stat. 4062) directs the Director of the Missile De-
fense Agency to develop a sensor payload to be 
integrated into architecture of the Space Devel-
opment Agency or Space Force to provide fire 
control quality data that would enable the 
interception of both ballistic and hypersonic 
threats; 
(4) as the Space Warfighting Analysis Center 
of the Space Force reviews candidate architec-
tures for fire control quality data, the Center 
should take into account the investment made to 
date and capability being developed by the 
hypersonic and ballistic tracking space sensor 
program for integration into the future architec-
ture; and 
(5) the Center should also consider current or 
planned programs of the intelligence community 
that could be integrated to increase the ability 
to contribute to fire control architectures of the 
Department of Defense. 
(b) FIRE CONTROL QUALITY DATA REQUIRE-
MENT.—In carrying out the analysis of can-
didate fire control architectures, the Secretary 
of the Air Force shall ensure that the Director 
of the Space Warfighting Analysis Center of the 
Space Force, at a minimum, maintains the re-
quirements needed for the missile defense com-
mand and control, battle management, and com-
munications system to pass the needed quality 
data within the timelines needed for current and 
planned interceptor systems to support engage-
ments of ballistic and hypersonic threats as de-
scribed in section 1645 of the William M. (Mac) 
Thornberry National Defense Authorization Act 
for Fiscal Year 2021 (Public Law 116–283; 134 
Stat. 4062). 
(c) BRIEFING.—Not later than 14 days after 
the date on which the Director of the Space 
Warfighting Analysis Center concludes the

SEC. 1647. REPORT ON INTEGRATED AIR AND MIS-
SILE DEFENSE SENSOR OF UNITED 
STATES INDO-PACIFIC COMMAND. 
(a) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of 
Congress that the budget of the President for 
fiscal year 2023 submitted to Congress pursuant 
to section 1105 of title 31, United States Code— 
(1) includes funding to develop and procure 
an integrated air and missile defense architec-
ture to defend Guam that includes multiple mo-
bile components located across Guam, however, 
a full assessment of the manning and infra-
structure needed to support those components, 
including items such as power, water, and avail-
ability of personnel housing, was not included 
in the overall determination of feasibility; and 
(2) did not include funding for the continued 
development of the discrimination radar for 
homeland defense planned to be located in Ha-
waii because of an ongoing reevaluation of the

SEC. 1648. RISK REDUCTION IN PROCUREMENT 
OF GUAM MISSILE DEFENSE SYSTEM. 
(a) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of 
Congress that— 
(1) the defense of Guam and the Armed Forces 
that operate there is of key strategic signifi-
cance and is one of the top priorities for United 
States Indo-Pacific Command and the United 
States; 
(2) the most severe adversary threat to Guam 
consists of long-range hypersonic and cruise 
missiles launched from a variety of air, land, 
and sea-based platforms; 
(3) the current plan of the Missile Defense 
Agency using a mixed architecture which, when 
applied to the launcher systems, relies on nu-
merous road-mobile transport erector launchers 
for launching, and is an unproven and high- 
risk plan; and 
(4) the existing vertical launch system, which 
can accommodate the standard missile–3 and the 
standard missile–6, is a more capable and tested 
system and provides reasonable risk reduction to 
the short-term missile defense of Guam, and in 
the long term provides much needed capacity in-
crease. 
(b) AUTHORITY FOR PROCUREMENT.—Except as 
provided by subsection (c), not later than De-
cember 31, 2023, the Secretary of Defense, acting 
through the Director of the Missile Defense

commodate planned interceptors operated by the 
Navy as of the date of the enactment of this Act. 
(c) WAIVER.—The Secretary may waive the re-
quirement under subsection (b) if— 
(1) the Secretary determines that the waiver is 
in the best interest of the national security of 
the United States; 
(2) the Secretary submits to the congressional 
defense committees a notification of such waiv-
er, including a justification; and 
(3) a period of 120 days has elapsed following 
the date of such notification. 
SEC. 1649. PLAN ON DELIVERING SHARED EARLY 
WARNING SYSTEM DATA TO CERTAIN 
ALLIES 
AND

(a) FINDINGS.—Congress finds the following: 
(1) The Shared Early Warning System cur-
rently provides accurate and timely ballistic 
missile warning information generated by space- 
based infrared sensors to the United States and 
select foreign countries. 
(2) As has been demonstrated in Russia’s un-
lawful invasion of and war in Ukraine, missile 
warning data provided to allies and partners of 
the United States could allow for critical warn-
ing to prevent widespread civilian casualties. 
(3) The rapid technical fielding of Shared 
Early Warning System capabilities should be 
prioritized in future bilateral defense negotia-
tions with allies and partners of the United 
States. 
(b) PLAN.—The Secretary of Defense, with the 
concurrence of the Secretary of State and the 
Director of National Intelligence, shall develop 
a technical fielding plan to deliver information 
under the Shared Early Warning System regard-
ing a current or imminent missile threat to allies 
and partners of the United States that, as of the 
date of the plan, do not receive such informa-
tion. 
(c) REPORT.—Not later than 180 days after the 
date of the enactment of this Act, the Secretary 
of Defense shall submit to the appropriate con-
gressional committees a report on how rapid 
technical fielding of the Shared Early Warning

GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. 
SMITH 
of 
Washington. 
Mr. 
Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that 
all Members may have 5 legislative 
days in which to revise and extend 
their remarks and include extraneous 
material on H.R. 7900. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Washington? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. 
SMITH 
of 
Washington. 
Mr. 
Speaker, I yield myself 4 minutes. 
Mr. Speaker, we have before us today 
the National Defense Authorization 
Act for Fiscal Year 2023. As most peo-
ple know, we have passed the National 
Defense Authorization Act every year 
for 62 straight years, and I urge Mem-
bers to do it again this year. 
I will start by thanking Ranking 
Member ROGERS and the minority. We 
have once again managed to work to-
gether in a bipartisan fashion to craft 
this bill in committee during a roughly 
16-, 161⁄2-hour markup in which we en-
tertained roughly a thousand amend-
ments and a whole bunch of different 
ideas and proposals to create this prod-
uct. 
I think the legislative process is 
enormously important. We continue it 
here with 1,200 amendments submitted 
to the Rules Committee, 650, roughly, 
in order. I am told that is actually a 
new record for a piece of House legisla-
tion, a record we weren’t necessarily 
looking to set, but it does reflect the 
participation in this process of this en-
tire body of an incredibly important 
piece of legislation, and we can’t lose 
track of that fact. 
This is the bill that enables the Con-
gress to exercise oversight of the Pen-
tagon. In this year’s budget, we author-
ize $850 billion. It is usually some-
where, by the time we are done, around 
a 3,000-page bill. 
It is an incredibly important piece of 
legislation that gives us the power and 
the ability to exercise that important 
oversight authority of the Pentagon 
and Department of Defense. 
We have done a lot of good work in 
this year’s bill. I think the focus, as we 
go forward, is obviously the men and 
women who serve and making sure that 
they have the tools they need to do the 
jobs that we have given them to do. 
We could have a robust debate about 
what those jobs should be, but I think 
we can all agree that once that debate 
is settled and the tasks are assigned, 
the men and women who serve must 
have the tools and the support from us 
that they need to do that job. 
This year, it has been particularly 
challenging, given the rate of inflation. 
Our bill reflects that, giving some addi-
tional support to our servicemembers 
and their families to deal with housing 
costs and also additional bonus pay to 
deal with that inflation. So, we support 
the servicemen and -women through 
our financial support and through 
making sure that their needs are met. 
The other big issue is making sure 
that the Pentagon is spending the 
money wisely. As many of you have 
heard, I have argued frequently that 
the amount of money is not as impor-
tant as how we spend it. Over the 
course of the last couple of decades, we 
have struggled with the number of pro-
grams that have been over budget and 
underperforming. We have, over the 
course of the last 6 years, put in place 
critical acquisition reform and pro-
curement reform to put the Pentagon 
in a better position to take advantage 
of innovative new technologies and, 
crucially, competition to make sure 
that we get a better product. 
We are beginning to see the fruits of 
that success. In programs like the B–21 
and the GBSD, whatever one thinks of 
those programs, they are on time, on 
budget, and actually meeting their re-
quirements, which is a significant 
change. That is due, in large part, to a 
lot of the legislation that we passed 
here. 
I think we have put together an ex-
cellent product. In particular, I thank 
my staff and also the Rules Committee 
staff. The Rules Committee staff had to 
sift through those 1,200 amendments, 
give them the attention that they are 
due, and make sure that the process 
worked. They did an amazing job work-
ing with our staff. 
I thank my staff on the Armed Serv-
ices Committee, both on the Repub-
lican side and the Democratic side, and 
our bipartisan staff for doing an out-
standing job. 
I recognize one of our staff members 
not able to be with us today who is nor-
mally here. Sharma gave birth to her 
second child yesterday. She wishes she 
were here, but she is also, I think, pret-
ty happy where she is. So, I want to 
pass along that congratulations. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time.

Sincerely,

Chairman. 
Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Mr. Speak-
er, I yield myself such time as I may 
consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support 
of H.R. 7900, the National Defense Au-
thorization Act for Fiscal Year 2023. 
H.R. 7900 represents a truly bipar-
tisan bill. I thank Chairman SMITH for 
his tremendous leadership and coopera-
tion in helping to fashion it. 
Over the last year, we have seen the 
best of our soldiers, sailors, marines, 
airmen, and guardians. They performed 
in the toughest environments and have 
done so with the greatest level of skill 
and professionalism. Without a doubt, 
these men and women are the greatest 
force for good the world has ever seen. 
Providing the authorities and re-
sources our warfighters need to defend 
our Nation is the greatest responsi-
bility we have in Congress. We fulfilled 
that responsibility with this NDAA. 
We put our servicemembers first, pro-
viding a 4.6 percent pay increase and 
expanding benefits for military spouses 
and families. To counteract the effects 
of record inflation on our servicemem-
bers and their families, our bill pro-
vides an additional 2.4 percent bonus to 
enlisted personnel. 
It includes an additional $500 million 
for housing allowances to offset the 
skyrocketing rents and an additional 
$750 million to reduce the price of food 
and other necessities at our military 
commissaries. 
The investments we make in this bill 
are focused on ensuring our warfighters 
are the best equipped and trained in 
the world. We increased funding for 
readiness, reversing cuts in our mili-
tary construction and housing projects; 
expanding training availabilities for 
servicemembers; and improving the 
safety of the ships, aircraft, combat ve-
hicles, 
and 
facilities 
where 
our 
warfighters serve. 
To ensure our warfighters prevail on 
future battlefields, we focused on mod-
ernization. That means divesting less 
capable legacy systems and investing 
in emerging technologies that will help 
us stay ahead of our adversaries. 
This bill saves the taxpayer over $6 
billion by divesting hundreds of older, 
less capable ships, aircraft, and other 
legacy systems. We use those savings 
and more to invest in emerging tech-
nologies such as AI, quantum com-
puting, hypersonic weapons, and auton-
omous systems. 
These investments are so critical be-
cause China and Russia are rapidly 
modernizing their militaries. 
China is outpacing us with advance-
ments in emerging technologies and 
weapons systems, and we know China 
isn’t building these capabilities purely 
for defense. In recent years, we have 
seen China use its military to push out 
its borders, threaten our allies, and 
gain footholds on new continents. 
H.R. 7900 is laser-focused on pre-
paring our military to prevail in a con-
flict with China. It makes critical in-
vestments in new systems capable of 
surviving in contested environments. It 
includes provisions that will further 
harden our supply chain and industrial 
base against infiltration from China. It 
reaffirms our support to allies in the 
region, especially Taiwan. 
It also strengthens our European alli-
ance as these democracies face grave 
threats from the unhinged crackpot 
currently leading Russia. 
Threats from adversaries like China 
and Russia are not the only ones we 
face. Terrorists continue to plot to de-
stroy our way of life. We must continue 
to take the fight to them anywhere at 
any time they threaten us. With strong 
investments in new capabilities and 
readiness, 
this 
bill 
enables 
our 
warfighters to do just that. 
This bill passed out of our committee 
57–1, with all Republicans voting for it. 
It is the definition of a bipartisan bill. 
It will enhance the congressional over-
sight of DOD, improve the quality of 
life for our servicemembers and fami-
lies, and ensure the military is prop-
erly resourced and equipped to defend 
our Nation and its allies. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members to 
vote for this bill, and I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. 
SMITH 
of 
Washington. 
Mr. 
Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gen-

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H6223 
July 13, 2022 
Mr. COOPER. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman for yielding. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong 
support of H.R. 7900, the National De-
fense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 
2023. Chairman SMITH
and Ranking 
Member ROGERS have put together an 
outstanding piece of legislation. 
I also thank my ranking member, 
Mr. LAMBORN, for his tremendous co-
operation throughout the year and all 
the members of the Subcommittee on 
Strategic Forces for their valuable 
contributions to the bill. 
This bill strengthens our national se-
curity at a time when our country is 
facing new and evolving threats in al-
most every theater. This bill takes 
care of our soldiers, sailors, airmen, 
marines, and guardians, and it invests 
in the tools that we need to protect 
ourselves, our allies, and our partners, 
as well as to deter our strategic com-
petitors. 
The 
Subcommittee 
on 
Strategic 
Forces has within its jurisdiction some 
of the most technical, complex, and 
consequential issues involved in our 
national security. At the top of that 
list are nuclear weapons. It is abso-
lutely essential that American nuclear 
forces and their command and control 
infrastructure remain safe, secure, and 
reliable. 
This bill makes certain that the De-
partments of Defense and Energy are 
well positioned for the immense task of 
sustaining our legacy forces while also 
recapitalizing our nuclear enterprise 
for the next 70 years. 
b 1515 
This bill ensures that both Depart-
ments 
are 
pursuing 
balanced 
ap-
proaches, emphasizing deterrence but 
also nonproliferation and arms control. 
We must remain focused on the highest 
priority efforts and realistic in our 
plans for future programs. Plutonium 
pit production is a prime example of 
where greater realism is needed. 
Regarding space, the subcommittee 
this year focused on the ability of 
China and Russia to degrade and de-
stroy our national security satellites. 
This bill presses the Department to 
publicly release a strategy on how they 
will defend our on-orbit assets. It also 
requires the new Space Force to con-
tinue tactically responsive space ef-
forts, authorizes additional funds to do 
so, and encourages increased competi-
tion within phase 3. 
Please support H.R. 7900. 
Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Mr. Speak-
er, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman 
from Wisconsin (Mr. GALLAGHER), the 
ranking member of the Military Per-
sonnel Subcommittee. 
Mr. GALLAGHER. Mr. Speaker, I am 
proud to join my colleagues in strong 
support of this bipartisan defense bill 
that we successfully voted out of the 
committee just 3 weeks ago. 
The chairman and the ranking mem-
ber mentioned some of the most impor-
tant provisions in the bill, not only the 
overall top-line number, which rep-
resents a $37 billion increase over 
President Biden’s request, but also a 
4.6 percent pay raise, a 2.4 percent pay 
bonus for enlisted personnel to coun-
teract the effects of inflation on low- 
income military families, the $500 mil-
lion additional housing allowance to 
counteract the skyrocketing cost of 
rent on military families, as well as an 
additional $750 million to reduce the 
cost of food and other necessities for 
our servicemembers. 
I think it is worth understanding 
why this is important, not only just in 
light of our overall duty to take care of 
our men and women in uniform at a 
critical time, but we also have a loom-
ing recruiting crisis on our hands. 
I am very concerned about the inabil-
ity of any of the services to meet their 
recruiting goals, and we are going to 
have to spend a lot of time thinking 
about that problem and how we fix it 
before we proactively lower standards 
because, at the end of the day, notwith-
standing any advance in technology, it 
all comes down to the men and women 
who volunteer and risk their lives to 
defend this country. 
It is about the warfighter. That is 
where we need to stay focused. It is 
also why I am proud that this bill in-
cludes many reforms to the profes-
sional military education process, with 
the intent of regaining our focus on 
warfighting so that our war colleges 
teach how to fight and win our Na-
tion’s wars. 
This is a critical time for U.S. na-
tional security. Our enemies are on the 
march, and we are being asked to hold 
the line. It is absolutely critical that 
Congress stays focused on the defense 
of this country and does not allow the 
defense of this country to be politicized 
in the way other issues have, which is 
why I so very much appreciate the 
work of the chairman and the ranking 
member in setting that bipartisan 
tone, and I am very proud to support 
this bill. 
Mr. 
SMITH 
of 
Washington. 
Mr. 
Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gen-
tleman from Connecticut (Mr. COURT-
NEY), the chairman of the Seapower 
and Projection Forces Subcommittee. 
Mr. COURTNEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
in support of the 2023 National Defense 
Authorization Act. This measure ful-
fills our duty to strengthen our na-
tional security and to serve those who 
serve us. 
That is particularly true of the ef-
forts of the Seapower and Projection 
Forces Subcommittee which, pursuant 
to Article I, Section 8 of the Constitu-
tion, has responsibility to provide and 
maintain the Navy. 
Our subcommittee has a record $32.6 
billion for shipbuilding, authorizes pro-
curement of 13 battle force ships, and 
fully funds the Navy’s number one pri-
ority, the Columbia Submarine Pro-
gram. It funds high-end warfighting ca-
pabilities, including three destroyers, 
two Virginia-class subs, and two fast 
frigates that will fill a critical need to 
conduct antisubmarine warfare. This 
bill also blocks the early termination 
of the LPD production line and sets a 
statutory floor on amphibious war-
ships. 
The bill invests a record $750 million 
in our submarine industrial base to 
grow its workforce and manufacturing 
supply 
chains 
across 
the 
country, 
which is critical to maintain produc-
tion cadence. It fully funds the Mari-
time and Tanker Security Programs 
and designates the Maritime Adminis-
tration as the lead agency to design 
and construct up to 10 sealift vessels, 
built by American workers, for use in 
the National Defense Reserve Fleet. 
It also takes an important step in 
furthering the Australia, U.K., and 
U.S., AUKUS, security agreement. It 
authorizes entry of Australian subma-
riners into our naval nuclear training 
programs to provide them with the ex-
perience necessary to command their 
own nuclear-powered, undersea fleet of 
the future. 
For aviation projection forces, it au-
thorizes procurement of five additional 
tactical 
airlifters, 
two 
Osprey 
tiltrotors, and two early warning air-
craft. It also authorizes full funding for 
the B–21 Raider and sets statutory 
floors for the C–130 and aerial refueling 
tanker fleets. 
Mr. Speaker, this bill, which passed 
out of our committee with strong bi-
partisan support—and I particularly 
salute my ranking member, ROB WITT-
MAN—provides our Nation with the ca-
pability to assure allies, deter conflict, 
and defend our homeland. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge support for this 
bill. 
Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Mr. Speak-
er, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman 
from Indiana (Mr. BANKS), the ranking 
member of the Cyber, Innovative Tech-
nologies, 
and 
Information 
Systems 
Subcommittee. 
Mr. BANKS. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the ranking member for yielding and 
for his leadership, and I thank the 
chairman for his commitment to bipar-
tisanship as well. I believe this NDAA 
is a true testament to that. 
I rise today in support of H.R. 7900, 
the NDAA for Fiscal Year 2023 because 
our investments in modernization and 
innovation are more important than 
ever. 
Our adversaries are focused on our 
defeat, on and off the battlefield. China 
is pouring money into research and de-
velopment of emerging technologies, 
recruiting top scientists, and stealing 
intellectual property to gain a tactical 
edge. 
This NDAA pushes the Department 
to accelerate innovation and strength-
en its cyber posture, both of which are 
critical to maintaining superiority in 
this era of great power competition. 
I am proud of the work that my sub-
committee 
has 
accomplished, 
the 
Cyber, Innovative Technologies, and 
Information Systems Subcommittee, 
along 
with 
Chairman 
LANGEVIN, 
throughout this bill. Our commitment 
to work together, I believe, is shown in

the input that we have both worked 
across the aisle to include in this 
year’s NDAA. 
We included provisions to improve 
opportunities 
for 
early-career 
sci-
entists to work with DARPA. This 
NDAA authorizes great work that the 
Defense Innovation Unit is doing to 
field commercial technology by dou-
bling its funding, and it expands the 
critical 
work 
being 
done 
in 
bio-
technology and batteries. 
We bolstered and strengthened the 
Department’s information security sys-
tems and gave Cyber Command the 
tools that it needs to succeed. 
As the ranking member of the Cyber, 
Innovative Technologies, and Informa-
tion Systems Subcommittee, I support 
this bill fully and encourage my col-
leagues to do the same. 
Mr. 
SMITH 
of 
Washington. 
Mr. 
Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gen-
tleman 
from 
California 
(Mr. 
GARAMENDI), the chairman of the Read-
iness Subcommittee. 
Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Speaker, this 
bill provides the necessary support and 
direction for our national security. It 
also provides the necessary support for 
our servicemembers’ families, and I am 
particularly pleased with the work 
completed by the Subcommittee on 
Readiness. 
A big thank you to Ranking Member 
WALTZ and LAMBORN for their partner-
ship in the subcommittee and also to 
the staff and all the members of the 
subcommittee, 
and 
particularly 
to 
Jeanine Womble, who was the staff di-
rector in this effort. 
The Readiness Subcommittee’s broad 
scope means that we cover everything 
from sustainment of weapons systems 
and facilities, including the safety of 
the men and women, military construc-
tion, climate change, energy, and envi-
ronmental policy. While the readiness- 
related provisions are extensive, I 
would like to take a few minutes to 
highlight just a few. 
In line with the work over the last 2 
years, we continue to address vulnera-
bilities in installation and energy resil-
iency, both in response to extreme 
weather events and to ensure the De-
partment can continue to accomplish 
its missions in the event of power dis-
ruptions. This bill works also to miti-
gate the military’s effect of climate 
change and supports clean energy inno-
vation, some of which you heard about 
just a moment ago. 
We also continue to focus on sus-
taining and modernizing the organic 
industrial base. We cannot continue 
the readiness risk that neglect of our 
ports, depots, shipyards, and arsenals 
create. This is essential to ensuring 
that our state-of-the-art weapons sys-
tems can meet the challenges of near- 
peer competitors, not only the first day 
they arrive in the hands of the mili-
tary, but in the days and years there-
after. 
The health and safety of our military 
and civilian personnel will continue to 
be a top priority. This means that we 
will continue to address military hous-
ing, the PFAS contamination and miti-
gation issues, and also safety. 
I am proud to represent two of the 
key military bases, Travis and Beale 
Air Force Bases and the men and 
women who work there. 
Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Mr. Speak-
er, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman 
from Texas (Mr. JACKSON), one of our 
outstanding freshman members of the 
committee. 
Mr. JACKSON. Mr. Speaker, I rise in 
support of one of the most important 
bills that comes before Congress, the 
NDAA. 
The NDAA includes important wins 
for all Americans, and for my district 
included. It provides support for serv-
icemembers and families at Sheppard 
Air Force Base while continuing to 
modernize Sheppard’s fleet of fighter 
trainer aircraft. It supports work at 
Pantex in Amarillo, including acceler-
ated funding to improve critical infra-
structure at the plant. 
This legislation also includes: 
Resources needed to compete and win 
in any potential conflict. 
Support for our allies, like Taiwan 
and Israel. 
Investments in Future Vertical Lift. 
Increased funding to improve our 
fleet of V–22s. 
Critical oversight of the Military 
Health System. 
The reinstatement of the Medical Of-
ficer of the Marine Corps, which rein-
forces our commitment to the absolute 
best medical care for our marines on 
the battlefield. 
It also provides protections for any 
servicemember who has reservations 
about taking the COVID–19 vaccine. 
As we consider amendments, I hope 
this bill remains focused on national 
security and can be passed in good 
faith, as we did almost unanimously in 
committee. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank Ranking Mem-
ber ROGERS for his leadership on this 
year’s NDAA. 
Mr. 
SMITH 
of 
Washington. 
Mr. 
Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gen-
tleman from New Jersey (Mr. NOR-
CROSS), the chair of the Tactical Air 
and Land Forces Subcommittee. 
Mr. NORCROSS. Mr. Speaker, this 
bill once again demonstrates the long 
and proud tradition of bipartisan work 
by the Tactical Air and Land Forces 
Subcommittee. 
Our 
members 
have 
shared the great responsibility to keep 
America’s land and air forces the best 
in the world. 
I especially want to recognize our 
ranking member, Mrs. HARTZLER, for 
her contributions to this bipartisan 
bill. Many of us know that this will be 
her final defense authorization bill in 
this Chamber, and I thank her for her 
hard work. Her efforts have made 
America stronger. 
Mr. Speaker, this bill supports the 
investment of resources necessary to 
equip and modernize our military while 
continuing the necessary oversight to 
ensure responsible execution and ac-
countability for Department of Defense 
programs. 
The bill includes: 
Aggressive oversight of strike fighter 
aircraft programs, including the most 
expensive, the F–35. 
Particular attention to and manage-
ment of risk associated with the De-
partment’s manned and unmanned ISR 
systems. 
Continued oversight of the Army and 
Marine Corps modernization strategies. 
And of particular importance to me 
and Mrs. HARTZLER is the bill’s support 
for the resources required to reduce 
risk to our defense industrial base. 
Mr. Speaker, I express my strong 
support for the pro-worker provisions 
included in this bill that I championed 
that would boost domestic manufac-
turing and guarantee Federal contrac-
tors a $15 an hour minimum wage. 
Finally, to the Tactical Air and Land 
Forces Subcommittee staff who have 
done a great job, both majority and mi-
nority: Bill Sutey, Heath Bope, Carla 
Zeppieri, Liz Griffin, Kelly Repair, and 
certainly our clerk, Payson Ruhl. 
I also thank my personal staff who 
have done a great job: Katie Lee, Lucy 
Perkins, and Kevin Seger. 
I also take a moment of privilege to 
thank the ranking member and chair-
man for setting the tone for this great 
bill. I urge everybody to support this. 
Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Mr. Speak-
er, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman 
from Alabama (Mr. CARL), another of 
our outstanding freshman members. 
Mr. CARL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
in support of H.R. 7900, the NDAA 2023. 
We have worked across the aisle on 
this bill, and I take great pride in it. 
We 
have 
successfully 
fought 
back 
against the President’s cut in our de-
fense budget, obviously due to infla-
tion. 
For example, it gets the Navy back 
on track to build a large enough fleet 
to counter threats like China, with 355 
ships. This includes much-needed ships 
that will be built by Austal USA in Mo-
bile, Alabama, and we are very proud of 
that. 
It also takes care of our servicemen 
and their families by giving a 4.6 per-
cent pay raise to counter Bidenflation. 
I encourage my colleagues from both 
sides of the aisle to support the bill be-
cause it is critical to the defense of 
this country. 
b 1530 
Mr. 
SMITH 
of 
Washington. 
Mr. 
Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gen-
tleman from Rhode Island (Mr. LAN-
GEVIN), who chairs the Subcommittee 
on Cyber, Innovative Technologies, and 
Information Systems. 
Mr. LANGEVIN. Mr. Speaker, I am 
very proud of the work the Sub-
committee on Cyber, Innovative Tech-
nologies, and Information Systems has 
done on this legislation. It is our sub-
committee’s job to get cutting-edge 
technologies into the hands of our 
warfighters as quickly as possible so 
that they never enter a fair fight.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H6225 
July 13, 2022 
I am certain now, more than ever, 
that we are putting the Department on 
the right track when it comes to con-
fronting emerging challenges with in-
novative solutions. This bill strength-
ens the R&D ecosystem and more 
closely aligns the Pentagon with the 
successes happening throughout pri-
vate industry. 
The bill also prioritizes research and 
development efforts in other key tech-
nology areas, such as hypersonics, soft-
ware, artificial intelligence, electronic 
warfare, and directed energy, among 
others, and it makes robust invest-
ments to accelerate quantum applica-
tions. 
It also makes long-overdue invest-
ments in our laboratories and test and 
evaluation infrastructure. We know 
that we simply cannot develop 21st 
century technologies and attract the 
Nation’s top talent with crumbling in-
frastructure. 
We provide robust support for our 
teammates at innovation centers, like 
DIU and DARPA, across the Depart-
ment, who are taking risks in pursuit 
of game-changing payoffs. 
It provides the U.S. Cyber Command 
and the Cyber Mission Force the re-
sources they need to keep us safe in 
cyberspace and ensures that our cyber 
operators have the training and career 
trajectories they need to succeed. 
This bill also includes a provision 
that I am very proud of, the Joint Col-
laborative Environment, which would 
enable the sharing and fusing of threat 
information and other relevant cyber-
security indicators across the Federal 
Government and between the public 
and 
private 
sectors, 
strengthening 
those public-private partnerships that 
are so vital to protecting our country 
in cyberspace. 
It is this subcommittee that has al-
ways looked ahead to a dynamic fu-
ture, seeking to fundamentally change 
the balance of power between the 
United States and our adversaries. Our 
warfighters are depending on our suc-
cess here today. 
In closing, I thank Chairman SMITH, 
Ranking Member ROGERS, and Ranking 
Member BANKS for their partnership 
and their leadership over the years. 
Serving on this committee throughout 
my time in Congress has been a true 
honor and a privilege. 
I would also like to thank the sub-
committee’s professional staff, as well 
as my personal staff, for their hard 
work on this legislation. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support the bill. 
Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Mr. Speak-
er, I yield 21⁄2 minutes to the gentleman 
from Mississippi (Mr. KELLY), the rank-
ing member of the Subcommittee on 
Intelligence and Special Operations. 
Mr. 
KELLY 
of 
Mississippi. 
Mr. 
Speaker, today I rise in strong support 
of the fiscal year 2023 National Defense 
Authorization Act. Our military is fac-
ing unprecedented challenges in a vola-
tile environment, and this body is 
charged with the duty of raising and 
supporting our military to ensure our 
safety both home and abroad. 
As the ranking member of the Sub-
committee on Intelligence and Special 
Operations, I am incredibly proud of 
the items in this bill that enable our 
intelligence 
and 
special 
operations 
communities to keep our adversaries at 
bay. I thank Chairman GALLEGO and 
my ISO colleagues for working in a bi-
partisan fashion to ensure ISO equities 
are represented throughout the NDAA 
process. 
In particular, the codification of the 
Special Operations Command’s 1202 au-
thority is significant. This authority 
authorizes SOCOM to conduct irregular 
warfare operations. The expansion of 
this authority is critical to our ability 
to compete and win in a great power 
competition environment. 
I remain concerned about our force 
posture and counterterrorism capabili-
ties in Afghanistan resulting from last 
year’s withdrawal. The administration 
has failed to provide the congression-
ally mandated report from Section 1069 
of last year’s NDAA. We continue to 
ask for greater detail on the so-called 
‘‘over the horizon’’ capability the ad-
ministration has touted. It remains 
clear this strategy was completely not 
thought out from the beginning. 
That said, I do want to mention a few 
noteworthy provisions in this bill. This 
bill includes an amendment to fund the 
priorities that our Nation’s top mili-
tary leadership told us they needed but 
the White House failed to support. The 
topline increase counters this adminis-
tration’s dangerous ‘‘divest to invest’’ 
strategy, which would leave us ill- 
equipped to deter or defeat China, our 
pacing threat, in the next 5 to 10 years. 
It also provides an increase in military 
personnel pay and benefits to combat 
the impacts of inflation so that our 
servicemembers who dedicate their 
lives to our Nation do not struggle to 
support themselves and their families. 
I also cannot understate the impor-
tance this bill has in securing our de-
fense industrial base and ensuring mil-
lions of jobs for Americans. The hard-
working Mississippians who work for 
our defense industry companies in my 
district and across the State to keep 
our Nation safe, secure, and prosperous 
deserve our support in Congress. 
Colleagues, the spirit of patriotism is 
not enough to support our troops. We 
have an obligation to ensure our mili-
tary is properly funded to compete and 
win wars against China, Russia, and 
any other adversary that threatens our 
way of life and democratic values. We 
have a responsibility to take care of 
our servicemembers and their families 
in this period of record-high inflation 
so that we retain the best talent, and 
we have a commitment to enact poli-
cies that honor our values, improve our 
national security, and empower our 
military leaders. We do all this by vot-
ing ‘‘yes’’ on this bill. 
Lastly, I would be remiss if I did not 
thank my teammates on this com-
mittee and my staff for working tire-
lessly on this year’s bill. Special shout- 
out to my ISO battle buddies: Chair-
man GALLEGO; professional staffer Pat-
rick Nevins; my defense team, Rodney 
Hall and Lauren Emmi. 
Mr. Speaker, I ask support for this 
bill. 
Mr. 
SMITH 
of 
Washington. 
Mr. 
Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gen-
tlewoman from Texas (Ms. ESCOBAR), a 
member of the committee. 
Ms. ESCOBAR. Mr. Speaker, as the 
vice chair of the House Armed Services 
Subcommittee on Military Personnel, 
and representing Fort Bliss in my 
home district of El Paso, Texas, I am 
proud to speak in support of this bill, 
which passed out of our committee 
with overwhelming bipartisan support. 
The bill supports a military basic pay 
raise of 4.6 percent and includes a tar-
geted bonus to address the challenges 
of inflation. It provides additional re-
sources to decrease out-of-pocket costs 
for housing and for our commissaries 
so they can keep their prices low. 
It mitigates the tragedy of suicide by 
supporting an increase in the number 
of behavioral health providers to en-
sure access to care for those who need 
it most. And, given concerns about the 
increasing number of vacancies of mili-
tary and civilian providers across the 
Military Health System, this bill pro-
hibits the Department from realigning 
or 
reducing 
military 
medical 
end 
strength until additional analysis on 
the impacts is complete. 
We also built on last year’s historic 
reforms to the Uniform Code of Mili-
tary Justice, ensuring our criminal 
litigators are getting the best training, 
resources, and experience possible to 
support our troops. 
We are also taking care of our mili-
tary children. In 2021, more than 20,000 
children of servicemembers who had 
immediate need for childcare were 
stuck on waitlists. In order to address 
the root causes, we are requiring the 
Department of Defense to complete a 
study on adequate pay for military 
childcare center employees. 
To better support families with spe-
cial needs, the bill establishes a grant 
program to help them navigate school 
districts after every move and ensures 
children with disabilities receive ap-
propriate and high-quality educational 
services. 
Together, servicemembers and their 
families make countless sacrifices for 
our Nation, which is why we must con-
tinue our commitment to them. 
I am grateful to Chairwoman JACKIE 
SPEIER for her leadership, and I am 
grateful to the ranking member and 
proud of the contributions our sub-
committee made to this bill. 
Mr. Speaker, this bill would make a 
tremendous difference in the lives of 
our military families, and I urge my 
colleagues to support it. 
Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Mr. Speak-
er, I yield 21⁄2 minutes to the gentleman 
from Colorado (Mr. LAMBORN), the 
ranking member of the Subcommittee

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H6226 
July 13, 2022 
Mr. LAMBORN. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today in support of the fiscal year 2023 
National Defense Authorization Act. 
As the ranking member of the Com-
mittee on Strategic Forces, I am par-
ticularly proud of the work put forward 
by this subcommittee led by Chairman 
JIM COOPER. I will miss working with 
my good friend from Tennessee. 
Among the many excellent provisions 
put forward by the Committee on Stra-
tegic Forces is one I am very pleased 
with that directs the establishment 
and funding of a National Hypersonic 
Initiative to bring an all-of-govern-
ment approach to catching up to China 
and Russia in hypersonics. 
The 
Subcommittee 
on 
Strategic 
Forces mark also directed an asym-
metric hypersonic defeat strategy and 
provides additional funds for directed 
energy technologies to defeat these 
hypersonic threats. The bill also pro-
vides funds to complete a 16th Patriot 
Battalion, accelerates the Guam de-
fense system, and seeks to reinvigorate 
an East Coast missile defense site. 
I am particularly proud that Chair-
man COOPER and I were able to find 
compromise and fund the nuclear sea 
launched cruise missile. I understand 
that our Senate counterparts, Senators 
King and Fischer, did so as well, and I 
look forward to reconciling our provi-
sions in conference to continue re-
search and development of this critical 
capability. I think that the four of us 
are proving that funding a safe, secure, 
reliable, and modern nuclear deterrent 
need not be a partisan exercise. 
We also have made valuable progress 
in the space domain, including requir-
ing the Department of Defense to make 
publicly available a strategy to defend 
and protect our on-orbit satellites. I 
am also glad to be directing the Space 
Force to establish requirements for de-
fense and resilience of space systems, 
as China and Russia become more ag-
gressive in space. 
In a bill this size, Mr. Speaker, with 
more amendments offered than any 
other single bill in the history of Con-
gress, a person can always find some-
thing to disagree with. But if you truly 
value and support our Nation’s defense, 
and if you truly understand the threats 
we face, you will look at all the major 
advances this bill makes for our secu-
rity and you will support this bill. 
Mr. 
SMITH 
of 
Washington. 
Mr. 
Speaker, I yield 21⁄2 minutes to the gen-
tleman from Arizona (Mr. GALLEGO), 
who is the chair of the Subcommittee 
on Intelligence and Special Operations. 
Mr. GALLEGO. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today in support of H.R. 7900, the Na-
tional Defense Authorization Act for 
fiscal year 2023. 
I congratulate my colleagues on the 
House Armed Services Committee for 
bringing forward a bipartisan National 
Defense Authorization Act for the 62nd 
consecutive year. 
I especially want to thank Ranking 
Member TRENT
KELLY
of the Sub-
committee on Intelligence and Special 
Operations for his leadership and con-
tributions to this bill. I also thank the 
subcommittee staff—Shannon, Craig, 
William, and Patrick—for their tireless 
efforts, as well as my personal office 
staff members Michelle and Charlie. 
This year’s bill contains crucial in-
vestments in America’s allies and part-
ners to address the threat the world 
faces from Vladimir Putin, including 
$225 million for the Baltic Security Ini-
tiative, which I started last year with 
my friend and cochair of the House 
Baltic 
Caucus, 
Congressman 
DON 
BACON. 
This bill also takes historic strides to 
prevent and mitigate civilian harm by 
creating mechanisms to increase trans-
parency and accountability at the De-
partment. 
As chairman of the Subcommittee on 
Intelligence and Special Operations, I 
am proud of this bill’s critical invest-
ments in intelligence modernization 
and special operations forces. Specifi-
cally, our bill invests in agility across 
the 
defense 
intelligence 
enterprise, 
protects our warfighters, and builds 
pandemic preparedness by adding $91 
million to the Chemical and Biological 
Defense Program’s top priority of ac-
celerating the Department’s biodefense 
capabilities. 
Our bill provides the resources to en-
sure Special Operations Command has 
the hardware it needs to conduct our 
Nation’s most sensitive operations. 
This year’s bill strengthens oversight 
of intelligence collection, information 
operations, and irregular warfare to en-
sure our intelligence professionals and 
special operations forces are positioned 
to prevail in the complex threat envi-
ronment they face every day. 
Colleagues, in addition to meeting 
the most pressing security challenges 
we face today, this bill supports our 
servicemembers with a 4.6 percent pay 
raise, codifies the $15 minimum wage 
for all workers, includes $111 million in 
research activities at HBCUs, and im-
proves women’s healthcare. 
This an important bill, and I urge my 
colleagues to support it. 
Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Mr. Speak-
er, I yield 21⁄2 minutes to the gentleman 
from Virginia (Mr. WITTMAN), the rank-
ing member of the Subcommittee on 
Seapower and Projection Forces. 
Mr. WITTMAN. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the ranking member for yielding. 
Mr. Speaker, I will begin by saying 
that I do not agree with everything in 
this bill, but the committee passed a 
bill worthy of support. 
I 
especially 
commend 
Chairman 
SMITH and Ranking Member ROGERS 
for navigating a markup that was 16 
hours and 12 minutes long, including 
the debate of almost 900 amendments. 
The House Armed Services Com-
mittee agreed on a bipartisan basis to 
increase our national security topline 
by over $35 billion, accounting for the 
damaging impacts of inflation or our 
military, and the rising threats we face 
today. I am particularly proud of the 
decisive final bipartisan vote of 57 to 1 
that passed this bill out of committee. 
Unfortunately, this bipartisan na-
tional security effort is in peril. The 
Rules Committee has allowed a series 
of particularly harmful and sometimes 
unrelated 
provisions 
that 
Speaker 
PELOSI would like to, once again, tack 
to the backs of our servicemembers, 
endangering Congress’ support of their 
service and our national security. I 
specifically hope during our floor de-
bate we can move to exclude these 
harmful riders. 
As to the committee mark, we start-
ed once again with an anemic budget 
request from the Biden administration 
that in the Seapower portfolio re-
quested only 8 ships and proposed the 
retirement of 24 ships, many of these 
ships well before the end of their ex-
pected service life. 
Fortunately, 
with 
the 
additional 
topline funding provided, we authorized 
13 battle force ships and rebuffed the 
administration’s request to retire 12 
ships early, committing ourselves to 
growing the Navy instead of shrinking 
it. We also invested in our strategic de-
terrence capabilities, providing funding 
for the Columbia-class ballistic missile 
submarine and the B–21 bomber pro-
grams. In the end, this is a strong 
Seapower statement. 
Before 
I 
conclude, 
I 
specifically 
thank Chairman JOE
COURTNEY, and 
thank him for his leadership in the 
Seapower 
Subcommittee. 
He 
is 
a 
navalist. He is a teammate and a dear 
friend who has the vision to see our na-
tional security perils and the political 
fortitude to respond to our most seri-
ous threats. 
My friends, this is good legislation 
that, in its current form, is worthy of 
support. We must remain focused on 
delivering a bill that provides the re-
sources our servicemembers need to ad-
vance the common defense of our Na-
tion.

Mr. 
SMITH 
of 
Washington. 
Mr. 
Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gen-
tlewoman from Virginia (Mrs. LURIA), 
the vice chair of the committee. 
Mrs. LURIA. Mr. Speaker, Congress 
must continue to supply the finest 
fighting force in the world with the 
funding, equipment, resources, and sup-
port they need, and I am proud to work 
with my colleagues on both sides of the 
aisle to do just that. 
The FY23 NDAA represents a bipar-
tisan effort to support our Active-Duty 
personnel with a 4.6 percent pay raise 
and invest in the critical capabilities 
that our Armed Forces need to defend 
our Nation and our interests abroad. 
This year’s NDAA also includes my 
request to increase defense spending by 
$37 billion, including at least $7.4 bil-
lion to combat inflation, more than $4 
billion for ship procurement, over $1.6 
billion in research and development 
funding, and over $500 million for secu-
rity assistance to Ukraine. 
At a time when we face growing 
threats from China, this bill provides 
needed funding for 13 new battle force

ships, including two Virginia-class sub-
marines, three guided-missile destroy-
ers, two guided-missile frigates, and 
one landing platform dock. This sends 
a strong message to our allies and our 
enemies and ensures that we have the 
resources to counter the threats we 
face from China, Iran, and Russia. 
Additionally, the NDAA includes sev-
eral of my amendments to directly ad-
dress access to mental health care and 
suicide prevention and improve the 
quality of life for sailors during com-
plex 
refueling 
overhauls, 
many 
of 
which were learned from lessons aboard 
the USS George Washington. 
While I am proud of the bipartisan ef-
fort we have made so far, there is still 
more work that needs to be done. I 
hope that the final version of the 
NDAA will include my bill, the Health 
Care Fairness for Military Families 
Act, which will eliminate the disparity 
that TRICARE dependents face when 
compared to those on private health in-
surance. 
The bipartisan progress we have 
made in this year’s NDAA will grow 
our Navy, strengthen our military, and 
give a well-deserved pay raise to our 
Armed Forces. I will continue to work 
with my colleagues on both sides of the 
aisle to support our military, and I 
look forward to negotiating with the 
Senate on the final top-line number. 
I thank the chair and the ranking 
member for their support in these ef-
forts, 
especially 
in 
growing 
and 
strengthening our Navy and our entire 
Armed Forces. 
Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Mr. Speak-
er, I yield 21⁄2 minutes to the gentleman 
from Florida (Mr. WALTZ), the ranking 
member 
of 
the 
Readiness 
Sub-
committee. 
Mr. WALTZ. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
Chairman SMITH and Ranking Member 
ROGERS
for their strong bipartisan 
product that is worthy of our service-
members. I also thank the chairman of 
the 
Readiness 
Subcommittee, 
Rep-
resentative 
GARAMENDI, 
for 
his 
thoughtful and collaborative work on 
this bill. 
Mr. Speaker, the threats are growing: 
Russia, Iran, North Korea, and, most 
significantly, China’s most rapid mili-
tary buildup that we have seen in mod-
ern history. 
The 
bipartisan 
top-line 
increase 
above inflation is a positive step, but 
our defense investments still fail to 
keep pace with the Chinese Communist 
Party and their rapid military buildup. 
Mr. Speaker, I don’t want to keep 
pace. Our servicemembers deserve bet-
ter. We need to have overmatch over 
that military buildup. That is how we 
then keep the peace and maintain de-
terrence. 
As the ranking member of the Readi-
ness Subcommittee, I know we cannot 
continue to afford to use our oper-
ations and maintenance accounts to 
pay for other priorities. Russia’s inva-
sion of Ukraine is a teachable moment 
for all of us. The entire world is wit-
nessing that logistics, training, and 
maintenance win or lose wars. 
China’s own growing aggression in 
the vast Indo-Pacific requires more op-
erations and maintenance funding for 
our partners and allies. We have to 
keep our forces forward, again, in order 
to maintain deterrence, and I will op-
pose amendments that thoughtlessly 
take from those accounts. We cannot, 
as a body, continue to rob Peter to pay 
Paul. 
Overall, I believe this is a strong bill. 
It does hold our military accountable 
but also makes significant steps to-
ward deterrence. 
Some key priorities: We authorize 
interoperable military exercises with 
Taiwan. We permanently prohibit pur-
chases of goods by the Defense Depart-
ment from the Xinjiang province. We 
require universities in China that sup-
port the CCP and the military to be 
identified and listed. We allocate fund-
ing for incredibly important new con-
struction projects at Florida’s military 
bases. We set gender-neutral fitness 
standards for our combat military oc-
cupational 
specialties 
in 
the 
U.S. 
Army. Perhaps most importantly, we 
passed a wounded warrior bill of rights. 
Finally, Mr. Speaker, as we continue 
to aid Ukraine, we must be accountable 
for those taxpayer dollars, and this bill 
would appoint an inspector general to 
oversee the aid that we are providing. 
Mr. Speaker, the number one job of 
the Federal Government is to keep the 
country safe. I urge my colleagues’ 
support for this bill. 
Mr. 
SMITH 
of 
Washington. 
Mr. 
Speaker, I yield myself the balance of 
my time. 
Substantively, I reiterate my initial 
remarks. I think this is a good bill that 
was put together. You have heard a lot 
of comments from the individual sub-
committee chairs. Many other Mem-
bers also contributed significant and 
important policy to this piece of legis-
lation that gives us the opportunity to 
properly exercise oversight of the Pen-
tagon, which is our job. This bill does 
an excellent job of that, and I think, as 
I mentioned, we have made some 
progress in recent years. 
The one big point I did not emphasize 
sufficiently at the start of my remarks 
is how important innovation and new 
technologies are right now. I don’t 
think there has been a time in the his-
tory of warfare where things have been 
changing as rapidly. We have certainly 
seen that play out on the battlefield in 
Ukraine but also in other fights that 
have happened in smaller conflicts in 
Armenia and Azerbaijan in the Middle 
East. 
You have to develop the new, best in-
novative technology, and as anyone 
would recognize, the Pentagon is not 
typically good at moving fast. It is a 
large bureaucracy. It takes them time 
to process ideas. What we have done is 
we have put forth innovative legisla-
tion to move that along faster so that 
we can develop the better technologies, 
take advantage of drone technology, 
take advantage of AI, and make sure 
that our systems are secure. That has 
really made a huge difference to make 
sure that we get the most out of the 
money we spend and that we are in the 
best position to have the technologies 
that we need. So, a number of these 
policies have made a huge difference. 
I will use the balance of my time to 
thank six members of our committee 
on the Democratic side who are retir-
ing at the end of this Congress: Con-
gress 
Members 
LANGEVIN, 
COOPER, 
SPEIER, BROWN, MURPHY, and KAHELE. I 
thank them very much for their serv-
ice. As you have heard many times, the 
cornerstone of this committee is our 
bipartisan approach and our commit-
ment to regular order, to sending our 
bills through the normal process in 
committee, having markups, debates, 
and then doing the same on the floor in 
a bipartisan way, which makes an 
enormous difference. These Members 
have contributed to that. I will espe-
cially recognize a couple of Members 
because a number have served for a 
long time on the committee. 
JIM LANGEVIN is the chairman of the 
subcommittee with the really com-
plicated name that I have to have writ-
ten down to remember, but it has to do 
with cyber and intelligence matters. 
JIM has dove into these issues. When I 
talk, as I did, about innovative tech-
nologies, it is his subcommittee that 
focuses on putting us in the best posi-
tion to deal with artificial intelligence, 
to figure out how to use directed-en-
ergy weapons and drones, to do the in-
novation that is crucial. JIM’s knowl-
edge level on this is above anybody in 
Congress. He has done an outstanding 
job over, I guess it is, 22 years as a 
Member of Congress and now a sub-
committee chair. His leadership has 
been invaluable in those crucial issues. 
JIM COOPER, also retiring, is a sub-
committee chair. He is very respon-
sible for getting us to properly focus on 
space. There is a lot of talk about the 
Space Force. Certainly, that is part of 
it, but that was never really the entire 
point. The point was that space has be-
come crucial in modern warfare. Lit-
erally, everything we do gets shut 
down if we don’t have robust access to 
our space assets. Recognize the impor-
tance of that and how much that has 
changed, certainly in the last 50 years 
but even in the last 10. Chairman COO-
PER
has worked with now-Ranking 
Member ROGERS, also a past chairman 
of that subcommittee, to make this 
happen. JIM’s intelligence and leader-
ship have made a huge difference in 
those issues. 
JACKIE SPEIER is retiring as the chair 
of 
the 
Military 
Personnel 
Sub-
committee. It is impossible to over-
state the work she has done to look 
after the men and women who serve in 
our forces, most notably, of course, 
with her commitment to battling sex-
ual assault and to getting the major 
sexual assault reform passed, which we 
passed last year, to set up a special 
prosecutor who will focus on sexual as-
sault cases. That was a 10-year effort. 
A lot of people, when they get in-
volved in politics, they get frustrated

that things aren’t happening. They 
don’t happen quickly. They get frus-
trated by the whole process. I have 
come up with the saying that, in poli-
tics and public policy, you have to be 
patient and persistent. Nobody personi-
fies that better than JACKIE SPEIER. 
She was absolutely doggedly persistent 
in getting the changes necessary to 
help improve the way we handle sexual 
assault and on a wide range of other 
issues that have helped protect the per-
sonnel who serve in our military. 
Lastly, I specifically thank ANTHONY 
BROWN, a past vice chair of the com-
mittee who has worked so hard on di-
versity issues. We were able, 2 years 
ago now, to finally get passed and put 
in place a commission to change the 
names of the military bases in this 
country and facilities, as well—not just 
base 
names, 
but 
those 
buildings, 
streets, and a whole bunch of other 
things that had been named after white 
supremacist Confederate traitors. He 
did the work to get that through the 
entire process, all the way to the point 
of having to override the President’s 
veto to get that done. 
Now we have a commission that is 
working on this issue. Certainly, it is 
crucial that they change the names, 
but what the commission is doing is 
they have held hearings all across the 
country in the communities where 
these bases are named to talk about 
the history, about how we got to this 
point, what is it that we are actually 
talking about, how these bases weren’t 
actually named immediately after the 
Civil War—they were named at the 
turn of the 20th century when there 
was an effort to reestablish white su-
premacy—to really educate and include 
the community in the process and, ul-
timately, in the names that were se-
lected. That never would have hap-
pened without ANTHONY’s hard work. 
We have some outstanding members 
of the committee leading us this year. 
I appreciate their service. Again, I 
thank Ranking Member ROGERS and 
the Republican staff. We have worked 
well together—not that we don’t dis-
agree. We absolutely disagree fre-
quently, but we do so in a way that al-
lows us to resolve those differences, 
which is the essence of how a rep-
resentative democracy is not just sup-
posed to work but how it must work if 
it is to survive. I appreciate the oppor-
tunity to be part of that process. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge Members to sup-
port this bill. It is an outstanding prod-
uct. Please vote ‘‘yes.’’ I yield back the 
balance of my time. 
Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Mr. Speak-
er, I yield myself the balance of my 
time. 
This is truly a bipartisan product, 
and I thank Chairman SMITH for his 
leadership in that effort. I know there 
will be an effort later today and tomor-
row to add extraneous issues to this 
bill that have nothing to do with the 
defense of our Nation. It happens every 
year. But like previous years, we will 
work through those in conference. We 
will weed out the ones that don’t need 
to come back to the floor. 
Before us today is a critical piece of 
legislation. It is a good piece of legisla-
tion, and I urge its adoption. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. 
AGUILAR). All time for debate has ex-
pired. 
Each further amendment printed in 
part A of House Report 117–405 not ear-
lier considered as part of amendments

AMENDMENT NO. 1 OFFERED BY MR. SCHIFF 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. It is now 
in order to consider amendment No. 1 
printed in part A of House Report 117– 
405. 
Mr. SCHIFF. Mr. Speaker, I have an 
amendment at the desk. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Clerk will designate the amendment. 
The text of the amendment is as fol-
lows: 
At the end of subtitle D of title V, add the 
following new section: 
SEC. 5ll. PUBLIC AVAILABILITY OF MILITARY 
COMMISSION PROCEEDINGS. 
Section 949d(c) of title 10, United States 
Code, is amended by adding at the end the 
following new paragraph: 
‘‘(4) In the case of any proceeding of a mili-
tary commission under this chapter that is 
made open to the public, the military judge 
may order arrangements for the availability 
of the proceeding to be watched remotely by 
the public through the internet.’’. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to House Resolution 1224, the gen-
tleman from California (Mr. SCHIFF) 
and a Member opposed each will con-
trol 5 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from California. 
Mr. SCHIFF. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support 
of this amendment, which has passed 
the House three times and which clari-
fies the authority of military commis-
sion judges to order court proceedings 
at Guantanamo Bay to be broadcast on 
the internet. 
At its core, this amendment has a 
simple goal: transparency. By passing 
this amendment, we will show the 
American people that we believe they 
have the right to observe military com-
mission proceedings, including those 
against the individuals who planned 
the 9/11 attacks. 
b 1600 
We owe transparency to the loved 
ones and families of the victims. We 
should also provide transparency for 
journalists, academics, NGOs, and all 
concerned Americans who are under-
standably deeply interested in these 
vital proceedings. 
Importantly, this bill does not re-
quire particular proceedings to be in 
open session—that will still be for the 
judges to decide. When they are open to 
the public, they should be accessible, 
so victims do not need to travel to 
Guantanamo to bear witness. 
I will continue to work to perma-
nently close the prison at Guantanamo 
Bay, but in the meantime, Congress 
must act to ensure transparency for 
the American people. 
This bill is fully protective of classi-
fied information, I encourage all Mem-
bers to support our amendment, and I 
reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Mr. Speak-
er, I rise in opposition to this legisla-
tion. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. 
CUELLAR). The gentleman is recognized 
for 5 minutes. 
Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Mr. Speak-
er, I oppose the gentleman’s amend-
ment. 
It allows some of the most hardened 
terrorists in U.S. custody a platform to 
publicly broadcast their message. 
Our military commissions process at 
Guantanamo Bay has already been sub-
stantially delayed. Letting hardened 
terrorists know there is a public audi-
ence for their hate will do far more 
harm than good. 
Federal courts have stuck to their 
guns against broadcasting major ter-
rorism cases, such as the trial of 
Zacarias Moussaoui, and I see no rea-
son to make an exception for terrorists 
at Guantanamo Bay. 
Mr. Speaker, even the Biden adminis-
tration 
has 
fought 
against 
prior 
versions of this amendment. I urge my 
colleagues to oppose this amendment, 
and I reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. SCHIFF. Mr. Speaker, is there 
time remaining in opposition or should 
I close? 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from Alabama has time re-
maining. 
Mr. SCHIFF. Mr. Speaker, I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Mr. Speak-
er, I reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. SCHIFF. Mr. Speaker, I urge sup-
port for the bill. Again, this bill does 
not require proceedings to be available

online, but it does ensure that judges 
have that authority. 
I think that this is something that 
the victims would like because the vic-
tims would like to be able to observe 
the proceedings without having to 
travel all the way to Guantanamo. In 
the interest of those victims, I would 
urge support for the passage of this 
amendment, and I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Mr. Speak-
er, again, this amendment undermines 
the military commissions process and 
gives hardened terrorists a public plat-
form. The Biden administration has op-
posed this. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
vote ‘‘no,’’ and I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to House Resolution 1224, the pre-
vious 
question 
is

the 
amendment offered by the gentleman 
from California (Mr. SCHIFF). 
The question is on the amendment. 
The question was taken; and the

Mr. POSEY. Mr. Speaker, on that I 
demand the yeas and nays.

ant to section 3(s) of House Resolution 
8, the yeas and nays are ordered. 
Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, fur-
ther proceedings on this question are

AMENDMENT NO. 2 OFFERED BY MR. JONES 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. It is now 
in order to consider amendment No. 2 
printed in part A of House Report 117– 
405. 
Mr. JONES. Mr. Speaker, I have an 
amendment at the desk. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Clerk will designate the amendment. 
The text of the amendment is as fol-
lows: 
Add at the end of subtitle F of title VIII 
the following new section: 
SEC. 8ll. PROHIBITION ON CONTRACTING WITH 
EMPLOYERS THAT VIOLATED THE 
NATIONAL LABOR RELATIONS ACT. 
(a) PROHIBITION.—Except as provided in 
subsection (b), the Secretary of Defense may 
not enter into a contract with an employer 
found to have violated section 8(a) of the Na-
tional Labor Relations Act (29 U.S.C. 158) 
during the three-year period preceding the 
proposed date of award of the contract. 
(b) EXCEPTIONS.—The Secretary of Defense 
may enter into a contract with a employer 
described in subsection (a) if— 
(1) before awarding a contract, such em-
ployer has settled all violations described 
under subsection (a) in a manner approved 
by the National Labor Relations Board and 
the employer is in compliance with the re-
quirements of any settlement relating to any 
such violation; or 
(2)(A) each employee of such employer is 
represented by a labor organization for the 
purposes of collective bargaining; and 
(B) such labor organization certifies to the 
Secretary that the employer— 
(i) is in compliance with any relevant col-
lective bargaining agreement on the date on 
which such contract is awarded and will con-
tinue to preserve the rights, privileges, and 
benefits established under any such collec-
tive bargaining agreement; or 
(ii) before, on, and after the date on which 
such contract is awarded, has bargained and 
will bargain in good faith to reach a collec-
tive bargaining agreement. 
(c) DEFINITIONS.—In this section, the terms 
‘‘employer’’, ‘‘employee’’, and ‘‘labor organi-
zation’’ have the meanings given such terms, 
respectively, in section 2 of the National 
Labor Relations Act (29 U.S.C. 152). 
(d) APPLICABILITY.—This section and the 
requirements of this section shall apply to a 
contract entered into on or after September 
30, 2023. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to House Resolution 1224, the gen-
tleman from New York (Mr. JONES) and 
a Member opposed each will control 5 
minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from New York. 
Mr. JONES. Mr. Speaker, I rise in 
support of my amendment, amendment 
No. 2, which prohibits the Department 
of Defense from awarding contracts to 
companies engaged in illegal anti- 
union activity. 
Every worker in this country de-
serves a living wage, a safe workplace, 
and the opportunity to join a union if 
they so choose. We know that some 
companies spend millions of dollars il-
legally fighting employee unionization 
efforts and get rewarded with govern-
ment contracts. 
Companies that engage in unfair 
labor 
practices—including 
threats, 
bribery, coercion, spying, and pun-
ishing workers for their attempts at 
unionization—are not barred from re-
ceiving these lucrative government 
deals. 
This amendment would change that. 
It bars the Department of Defense from 
awarding any of their more than $400 
billion in annual contracts to compa-
nies engaged in these illegal activities. 
President Biden promised to ‘‘be the 
most pro-union President leading the 
most 
pro-union 
administration 
in 
American history.’’ I hope that we can 
make this goal a reality. 
Mr. Speaker, I encourage all of my 
colleagues to vote ‘‘yes’’ on amend-
ment No. 2, and I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Mr. Speak-
er, I rise in opposition to this amend-
ment. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman is recognized for 5 minutes. 
Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Mr. Speak-
er, this amendment completely under-
mines the existing contractor debar-
ment processes at DOD. Federal con-
tractors and subcontractors are al-
ready required to comply with the Na-
tional Labor Relations Act. 
There are already tools to bring con-
tractors into compliance. This amend-
ment takes the decision out of the 
hands of the contracting officer to de-
termine whether or not a contractor is 
responsible. Something as small as a 
single paperwork violation would pro-
hibit DOD from contracting with a 
company. 
This is an unprecedented prohibition 
that exists nowhere else in the Federal 
Government. 
It is a departure from the processes 
we use to prevent contracting with bad 
actors and would undermine our na-
tional security. If enacted, this would 
severely limit the Department’s ability 
to contract for goods and services need-
ed to support the warfighter and exe-
cute critical mission sets around the 
globe. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge Members to op-
pose the amendment, and I reserve the 
balance of my time. 
Mr. JONES. Mr. Speaker, I would 
just note that unfair labor practice vio-
lations will only disqualify an em-
ployer from DOD contracts if an em-
ployer refuses to settle a violation or 
remains out of compliance with the 
terms of that settlement. When an em-
ployer settles a violation with the 
NLRB and remains in compliance with 
the terms of their settlement, they will 
regain eligibility for DOD contracts. 
Respectfully, my colleague’s concern 
on the other side of the aisle is mis-
placed. There is also a broader issue at 
hand. 
Why are we being asked to sacrifice 
the rights of working people to support 
defense capabilities? 
These are not mutually exclusive pri-
orities. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Mr. Speak-
er, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman 
from Georgia (Mr. ALLEN). 
Mr. ALLEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise in 
opposition to this amendment. Prohib-
iting employers from Federal contracts 
for violations of the National Labor 
Relations 
Act, 
NLRA, 
circumvents 
longstanding 
compliance 
procedures 
and would have a significant impact on 
Federal contractors. 
The prohibition duplicates existing 
safeguards in the Federal contracting 
process that already has a system in 
place to deny Federal contracts to 
companies that break the law. This 
flawed blacklisting amendment will 
threaten Federal contractors’ due proc-
ess rights because a Federal contractor 
could be prohibited from DOD con-
tracts before a charge has been fully 
adjudicated. 
An employer can be found to have 
violated the NLRA by an administra-
tive law judge, but the employer has 
the right to appeal that decision to the 
National Labor Relations Board. Em-
ployers also have the right to appeal 
NLRB decisions to the U.S. Court of 
Appeals. 
It is unfair and unjust to bar employ-
ers from Federal contracts before they 
have exhausted all remedies of relief. 
This amendment also provides unfair 
special treatment to employers with 
employees who are represented by a 
union. The amendment prohibitions 
can be waived if the employees of an 
employer are represented by a union, 
giving unionized Federal contractors a 
significant advantage over non-union 
firms in the Federal procurement proc-
ess. 
These prohibitions will encourage 
frivolous NLRA complaints and provide

labor unions leverage to organize non- 
Federal union contractors. The Federal 
procurement process works best when 
the bidding process is open and fair and 
not dependent on whether the Federal 
contractor is unionized. 
Mr. Speaker, this is in the best inter-
est of taxpayers, and I urge my col-
leagues to reject this amendment. 
Mr. JONES. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from New 
Jersey (Mr. NORCROSS). 
Mr. NORCROSS. Mr. Speaker, the 
gentleman is correct. We all want an 
open, competitive, and fair contracting 
process. The Department of Defense, as 
we know, is the largest government 
contractor—over $400 billion a year in 
contracts—60 percent are by the De-
partment of Defense. 
This amendment would ensure that 
the DOD contractors are not violating 
labor law—things that we all agree on. 
They do not have the privilege of re-
ceiving taxpayer dollars if they are 
violating this. These taxpayer dollars 
should go to companies that are help-
ing to build and strengthen our coun-
try, not tear it down. 
American workers are why we are 
the greatest country in the world. It is 
their strength that makes us a reality. 
Under this amendment, unfair labor 
practices are more than just an accusa-
tion, they are to be found in violation 
of the NLRA. The idea of having this, 
it has been proven you have violated— 
you still have an option—you settle the 
problem and then you can get on the 
bid list. Right now the Department of 
Defense does have that issue. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
vote ‘‘yes’’ on this very important 
amendment. 
Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Mr. Speak-
er, I reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. JONES. Mr. Speaker, how much 
time do I have remaining? 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from New York has 2 minutes 
remaining. 
Mr. JONES. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self the balance of my time. 
The freedom to join a union is essen-
tial—essential to the dignity of work-
ers to secure living wages and good 
benefits and building an economy that 
works for everyone, not just the 
wealthy and the well-connected. 
Current law recognizes how essential 
this freedom is and how the deck is too 
often stacked against workers. This is 
the very reason the National Labor Re-
lations Act exists and why unfair labor 
practices are illegal. 
When employers are rewarded for 
suppressing worker rights, we under-
mine the very purpose of having labor 
laws at all. 
I think we should be very clear about 
what is going on here. 
The Democrats are fighting for mid-
dle-class jobs with good pay and bene-
fits and an economy where one job is 
enough, where 40 hours of work is 
enough to live with dignity. 
Republicans are not interested in 
protecting workers. They are inter-
ested in protecting the corporations 
that exploit workers for profit and cor-
porations whose bottom line depends 
on keeping wages low and suppressing 
worker power. My Republican col-
leagues want to protect the govern-
ment contracts of companies that vio-
late labor law. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my col-
leagues to protect the rights of work-
ing people by voting ‘‘yes’’ on amend-
ment No. 2, and I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Mr. Speak-
er, I urge all Members to oppose this 
effort. It could stop procurement of 
critical systems needed to counter 
China. It could delay construction of 
military housing projects, and it could 
stop work on vital programs to im-
prove the safety of ships, aircrafts, and 
combat vehicles. 
Mr. Speaker, this is a bad amend-
ment. I urge all Members to oppose it, 
and I yield back the balance of my 
time.

ant to House Resolution 1224, the pre-

AMENDMENT NO. 3 OFFERED BY MS. 
SCHAKOWSKY 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. It is now 
in order to consider amendment No. 3 
printed in part A of House Report 117– 
405. 
Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Mr. Speaker, I 
have an amendment at the desk. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Clerk will designate the amendment. 
The text of the amendment is as fol-
lows: 
Add at the end of subtitle A of title VIII 
the following: 
SEC. 8ll. PREFERENCE FOR OFFERORS THAT 
MEET CERTAIN REQUIREMENTS. 
(a) IN GENERAL.—Chapter 241 of title 10, 
United States Code, is amended by adding at 
the end the following new section: 
‘‘SEC. 3310. PREFERENCE FOR OFFERORS THAT 
MEET CERTAIN REQUIREMENTS. 
‘‘(a) IN GENERAL.—In awarding contracts 
for the procurement of goods or services, the 
Secretary of Defense shall prioritize offerors 
that meet any of the following qualifica-
tions: 
‘‘(1) The offeror has entered into an agree-
ment— 
‘‘(A) with a labor organization; 
‘‘(B) that provides the manner in which the 
offeror will— 
‘‘(i) act with respect to lawful efforts by 
such labor organization to organize the em-
ployees of such offeror, including an agree-
ment that the offeror will not assist, deter, 
or promote such efforts; and 
‘‘(ii) engage in collective bargaining with 
such labor organization; and 
‘‘(C) that is effective for the duration of 
the contract to be awarded. 
‘‘(2) The offeror has entered into an agree-
ment with a majority of the employees of 
the offeror or a labor organization, effective 
for the duration of the contract to be award-
ed, not to hire individuals to replace any em-
ployee of the offeror engaged in any strike, 
picketing, or other concerted refusal to work 
or to close a business in response to such a 
strike, picketing, or other refusal to work. 
‘‘(3) The offeror has a collective bargaining 
agreement with a labor organization or a 
majority of the employees of the offeror. 
‘‘(b) PRIORITIZATION ORDER.—The Secretary 
of Defense shall further prioritize an offeror 
under subsection (a) for each qualification 
described in such subsection that such offer-
or meets. 
‘‘(c) APPLICATION.—The prioritization re-
quired under this section shall— 
‘‘(1) be applied after any other preference 
or priority applicable to the award of the 
contract; 
‘‘(2) be accorded weight that is not less 
than such other preference or priority; and 
‘‘(3) not be construed as superseding or re-
placing any such other preference or pri-
ority. 
‘‘(d) RULE
OF CONSTRUCTION.—Nothing in 
this section shall be construed to preempt, 
displace, or supplant any provision of the 
National Labor Relations Act (29 U.S.C. 151 
et seq.). 
‘‘(e) EMPLOYEE; EMPLOYER; LABOR ORGANI-
ZATION DEFINED.—In this section, the terms 
‘employee’, ‘employer’, and ‘labor organiza-
tion’ have the meanings given such terms in 
section 2 of the National Labor Relations 
Act (29 U.S.C. 152).’’. 
(b) CLERICAL
AMENDMENT.—The table of 
sections for Chapter 241 of title 10, United 
States Code, is amended by adding at the end 
the following new item: 
‘‘3310. Preference for offerors that meet cer-
tain requirements.’’. 
(c) APPLICABILITY.—This section and the 
amendments made by this section shall 
apply only with respect to contracts entered 
into on or after the date of the enactment of 
this Act. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to House Resolution 1224, the gen-
tlewoman from Illinois (Ms. SCHA-
KOWSKY) and a Member opposed each 
will control 5 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from Illinois. 
b 1615 
Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Mr. Speaker, my amendment is very 
simple. It gives a preference to defense 
contractors who will remain neutral in 
union organizing. I say neutral—not 
pro and not con. Contractors who com-
mit to remain neutral in organizing 
campaigns commit to not breaking 
strikes, and it gives preferences also to 
those who would have a union bar-
gaining agreement. These are not re-
quirements. These are preferences, the 
kind of preferences that we have for 
small businesses and that we have for 
veterans and a number of other pref-
erences that are given. 
Now, let’s understand that we are 
talking about $422 billion in contracts 
that are given to businesses. By the 
way, small businesses also have a pref-
erence out of a $778 billion defense act. 
So these are big taxpayer expenditures 
that we are talking about.

It seems to me given that we want to 
make sure that workers are also ac-
knowledged that we say that it would 
be a good thing if we don’t have compa-
nies like Amazon, for example, that get 
a lot of money in defense contracts and 
spend a lot of money trying to make 
sure that workers cannot bargain col-
lectively. So let’s give preferences to 
those who actually do acknowledge 
workers. That is the only idea of this 
amendment. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the 
gentleman 
from 
California 
(Mr. 
GARAMENDI) in support of this amend-
ment. 
Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank Representative SCHAKOWSKY for 
this amendment. It is very important. 
This is about fairness in the workplace. 
This is about the opportunity for work-
ers to have a say in their work life. 
This is about an opportunity for major 
companies that want a contract with 
the United States Government Depart-
ment of Defense to stay neutral in any 
unionizing opportunity that a union 
may be putting forward. 
The rights of workers who support 
our defense industry would be pro-
tected by this amendment, and the De-
partment of Defense would continue to 
have the flexibility in the contracting 
programs that they have. 
With billions of dollars that we are 
going to be spending as a result of this 
and previous bills, let’s be fair to the 
workers. If they want to organize, fine. 
For the companies, it is time for them 
to be neutral and not do the kind of 
practices that we have seen from com-
panies such as Amazon and a few oth-
ers. 
Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Mr. Speak-
er, I rise in strong opposition to this 
amendment. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman is recognized for 5 minutes. 
Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Mr. Speak-
er, this amendment completely under-
mines the existing contractor debar-
ment processes at the DOD. Federal 
contractors and subcontractors are al-
ready required to comply with the Na-
tional Labor Relations Act. There are 
already tools to bring contractors into 
compliance. But this amendment takes 
the decision out of the hands of the 
contracting 
officer 
to 
determine 
whether a contractor is responsible. 
If enacted, this amendment would 
limit the Department’s ability to re-
ceive quality goods and services and 
drive up costs unnecessarily. 
Federal contractors and subcontrac-
tors are already required to comply 
with the National Labor Relations Act. 
Yet this amendment would go further 
and seek to prefer contract awards 
based on compliance with labor agree-
ments in a new and unprecedented way 
regardless of its negative impact on 
small businesses and national security. 
I will note that this amendment is 
opposed by the National Federation of 
Independent Businesses, as well as the 
Workplace Policy Institute and the As-
sociated Builders and Contractors. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members to 
oppose the amendment, and I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from 
New Jersey (Mr. NORCROSS). 
Mr. 
NORCROSS. 
Mr. 
Speaker, 
I 
thank the gentlewoman for yielding. 
Once again, we are talking about our 
most valuable asset in this country, its 
workers, and the ability to treat them 
with fairness and giving them the abil-
ity to achieve the American Dream; 
that starts with their ability to go 
after contracts through their company. 
However, if their company is not play-
ing by the rules, they are flooding their 
ability to have a voice in the work-
place, to vote for a union, this is where 
the issue begins and where the amend-
ment addresses. 
Very simply, it says: Play by the 
rules, have a neutrality agreement, and 
you should be given a preference, a 
preference for the American worker. 
That is just so incredibly important 
given the challenges of the supply 
chain. At a time when we are chal-
lenged throughout the globe of getting 
the parts and the supplies we need to 
build the greatest defense in the world, 
we are being challenged because of 
something we have control over—our 
workforce and treating them well and 
fairly under the rules of the govern-
ment are incredibly important. 
That is why this amendment is just 
so important. It says that to be a re-
sponsible contractor, treat your em-
ployees fairly, level the playing field, 
and let them have the choice. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge all my colleagues 
to vote ‘‘yes’’ on this amendment. 
Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Mr. Speak-
er, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman 
from Georgia (Mr. ALLEN). 
Mr. ALLEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise in 
opposition to this amendment. 
Mr. Speaker, this amendment has 
one goal: to eliminate all nonunion 
contractors from DOD contracts. It 
does not represent the modern work-
force. The modern workforce is not in-
terested in jurisdictional rules. They 
are interested in incentives to get the 
job done on time and on budget. It 
achieves this goal by favoring employ-
ers who want to do business with the 
DOD that sign neutrality agreements 
or already have collective bargaining 
agreements with labor unions. 
These 
so-called 
neutrality 
agree-
ments are anything but neutral. They 
stifle employee free choice and prohibit 
employers from communicating with 
their employees about the downsides of 
union representation. 
Mr. Speaker, can you imagine an em-
ployer not being able to talk with their 
employees? 
One common provision in a neu-
trality agreement takes away a work-
er’s right to a secret ballot in an elec-
tion. That is guaranteed in our elec-
tions and allows unions to organize 
under the radical card check scheme 
that exposes workers to well-docu-
mented instances of harassment and 
intimidation. Even the U.S. Supreme 
Court describes card check is an admit-
tedly inferior election process. 
Another 
provision 
in 
neutrality 
agreements places gag orders on em-
ployer speech that prohibits them from 
informing their employees about the 
impact that unionization can have on 
the workplace and their income. 
This 
amendment 
could 
also 
put 
workers’ private information at risk. 
Many neutrality agreements require 
employers to provide union access to 
employees’ personal information in-
cluding home address, phone numbers, 
and email addresses for the purpose of 
pressuring employees to sign U.N. au-
thorization cards. 
Workers should be able to freely 
choose for themselves whether they 
want a union through a secret ballot 
election. Instead, this amendment en-
courages employers to work with labor 
unions to impose union representation 
on workers. It is not the American 
way. 
Hardworking taxpayers deserve effi-
cient and effective procurement poli-
cies, not rules that provide preferential 
treatment to special interest groups 
like labor unions. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
reject this amendment. 
Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Mr. Speaker, 
may I inquire how much time is re-
maining. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tlewoman from Illinois has 30 seconds 
remaining. 
Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Mr. Speaker, I 
just want to point out that this has 
nothing to do with stifling the rights of 
companies to communicate. It does 
prevent them from harassing workers 
and preventing them from doing what 
they need to do. I just want to point 
out that there are companies that in-
clude 
UPS, 
Levi 
Strauss, 
AT&T, 
Verizon, and, most recently, Microsoft, 
that have these agreements. 
Big companies do it. They can do it. 
Let’s protect workers and the rights 
of the companies as well. We can do 
both. 
Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Mr. Speak-
er, I urge all Members to oppose this 
amendment, and I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to House Resolution 1224, the pre-

July 13, 2022 
printed in part A of House Report 117– 
405. 
Mr. KIM of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, 
I have an amendment at the desk. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Clerk will designate the amendment. 
The text of the amendment is as fol-
lows: 
Add at the end of subtitle A of title XXVIII 
the following new section: 
SEC. 28ll. LOCAL HIRE REQUIREMENTS FOR 
MILITARY 
CONSTRUCTION 
CON-
TRACTS. 
(a) LOCAL HIRE REQUIREMENTS.— 
(1) IN GENERAL.—To the extent practicable, 
in awarding a covered contract, the Sec-
retary concerned (as defined in section 101 of 
title 10, United States Code) shall give a 
preference to a person who certifies that at 
least 51 percent of the total number of em-
ployees hired to perform the covered con-
tract (including any employees hired by a 
subcontractor (at any tier) for such covered 
contract) shall reside in the same State as, 
or within a 60-mile radius of, the location of 
the work to be performed pursuant to the 
covered contract. 
(2) 
JUSTIFICATION
REQUIRED.—The 
Sec-
retary concerned shall prepare a written jus-
tification, and make such justification avail-
able on the Internet site required under sec-
tion 2851(c) of title 10, United States Code, 
for the award of any covered contract to a 
person that is not described under paragraph 
(1). 
(b) LICENSING.—A contractor and any sub-
contractors (at any tier) performing a cov-
ered contract shall be licensed to perform 
the work under such covered contract in the 
State in which the work will be performed. 
(c) COVERED CONTRACT DEFINED.—In this 
section, the term ‘‘covered contract’’ means 
a contract for a military construction 
project, military family housing project, or 
other project described in section 2851(c)(1) 
of title 10, United States Code. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to House Resolution 1224, the gen-
tleman from New Jersey (Mr. KIM) and 
a Member opposed each will control 5 
minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from New Jersey. 
Mr. KIM of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, 
I rise to offer my amendment that will 
help 
small 
businesses 
and 
highly 
skilled workers in the building trades 
access new opportunities and unlock 
the local economic potential of mili-
tary bases across the country. 
This amendment is not new. We 
passed it through the House before on a 
bipartisan basis, and I hope we will do 
it again today. 
My amendment would incentivize the 
use of local workers for military con-
struction projects by asking the Sec-
retary of Defense to provide preference 
for businesses that commit to hire 
qualified skilled workers from within 
the same State or within a 60-mile ra-
dius of the project. 
I represent Joint Base McGuire-Dix- 
Lakehurst, which for decades has been 
an economic engine in my community 
with thousands of jobs tied to oper-
ations on the base. However, too often 
construction contracts at the base 
don’t go to these local businesses and 
local workers and instead go out of 
State. 
I introduced the Put Our Neighbors 
to Work Act and offer it as an amend-
ment here for those skilled and quali-
fied construction workers, electricians, 
painters, and other local contractors in 
my district who are looking for that 
next opportunity and who are ready 
and able to do this work and build DOD 
infrastructure right in their own com-
munity; a community they are proud 
to live in and work that they want to 
do for our country. 
I am proud that another key provi-
sion of my bill was adopted in the 
Armed Services Committee markup 
which 
would 
require 
more 
trans-
parency to provide small businesses a 
fair chance to compete for subcon-
tracting opportunities under military 
construction contracts. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank Congressman 
PFLUGER, Congressman NORCROSS, and 
Congressman GARAMENDI
for cospon-
soring this bipartisan bill. I urge my 
colleagues on both sides of the aisle to 
stand up for local workers and local 
economies by passing this amendment 
which has passed the House, as I have 
said, on a bipartisan basis the past 2 
years. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. WALTZ. Mr. Speaker, I rise in 
opposition to the amendment. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from Florida is recognized for 5 
minutes. 
Mr. 
WALTZ. 
Mr. 
Speaker, 
this 
amendment requires local preferences 
and State construction licenses for all 
facility sustainment and military con-
struction projects. 
Mr. Speaker, it is notable the opposi-
tion to this amendment includes the 
Chamber of Commerce, the National 
Defense Industrial Association, the As-
sociated General Contractors of Amer-
ica, the Association of Building Con-
tractors, and the American Council of 
Engineering Companies. All of them 
oppose this, and notably, this provision 
last year was strongly opposed by the 
Biden Administration. 
Mr. Speaker, this provision would in-
crease time and money to an already 
difficult, lengthy, and often slow mili-
tary construction process. These are 
facilities that our fighting men and 
women desperately need. 
Mr. Speaker, it also impacts the 
skilled workforce. The local hiring 
preferences would significantly impact 
a military construction contractor’s 
workforce by creating scenarios where 
long-term, highly skilled workers may 
have to be released and may have to be 
laid off in order to meet the local hire 
mandate. Then in order to comply with 
the requirements, employers would 
have to bring in unnecessary and un-
skilled workers to fill these now vacant 
positions, creating additional costs and 
creating additional safety concerns. 
b 1630 
Local preference requirements false-
ly assume—and here is the funda-
mental issue. It is a false assumption 
that there is this automatic pool of 
qualified 
military 
contractors 
and 
workers wherever this military con-
struction 
project 
may 
take 
place. 
Often, there is, in some locations. But 
often, in our most rural locations, 
there is not. There is an assumption 
that they are capable of performing 
this work. 
Mr. Speaker, the bottom line is the 
provision would increase costs. Again, 
it would expand an already bloated 
military construction timeline, and it 
will reduce skilled employment and de-
crease the quality of construction in 
these vital projects. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge opposition to this 
amendment. I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. KIM of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, 
I yield such time as he may consume to 
the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. 
NORCROSS). 
Mr. NORCROSS. Mr. Speaker, this is 
something I know quite a bit about be-
cause I was one of those young elec-
tricians in an area hoping to get a job, 
and then I see somebody come from 
hundreds of miles away with their com-
pany and undercut by literally cutting 
their wages and kicking back to their 
employers. 
Now, I am not suggesting that hap-
pens everywhere. But there is nothing 
more frustrating than to have a job in 
your local community that goes to out-
siders who travel from very far dis-
tances to replace the workers who live 
there. 
Each of us understands how much we 
care about our districts. Each of us un-
derstands that on a level that is proven 
every November. We love our districts. 
We want to help those in our districts. 
This is why I find it so surprising 
that we wouldn’t want to fight for a 
local hire agreement, a 60-mile radius. 
Take any point in this country, in 60 
miles, you will find qualified workers. 
If, God forbid, that is not available, 
there are waivers allowed here for the 
Department of Defense. 
That is the important part to under-
stand. 
There 
are 
qualified 
people 
throughout this country who do con-
struction work on an annual basis, who 
do specialized work. They are the ones 
who live in that community. They are 
the ones who pay the taxes in that 
community. 
To have somebody come in from dis-
tances outside the State, who don’t pay 
the taxes, and take that money back to 
their area, God bless them. 
Where we have the ability to fight for 
our 
constituents 
in 
our 
districts 
through local hire, this is the smart 
thing to do. It is not only smart for the 
local people, but they are good workers 
who have been trained well. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my col-
leagues to vote for their districts and 
vote for this amendment. 
Mr. WALTZ. Mr. Speaker, I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. KIM of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, 
I yield myself the balance of my time. 
I just want to say on this front that 
I have had the great opportunity to go 
around my State, to go around a lot of

other States, to visit different military 
installations. Every single place I have 
been to, in every State, including mine, 
New Jersey, we are so proud to host 
these military bases, these military in-
stallations. It is a duty of ours and 
something that we consider very sa-
cred, to be able to support and con-
tribute to our national security in that 
kind of way. 
Oftentimes, that requires our States 
and our communities to step up in dif-
ferent ways, to take on different ac-
tions to be able to be accommodating 
and to support these bases. 
We are proud, though, to be able to 
host, and we hope that these bases are 
proud of their relationship with us, of 
being able to be part of our commu-
nity. That is all we are asking about 
here. 
This isn’t about trying to have un-
skilled workers be able to take jobs of 
skilled workers. It is exactly the oppo-
site of that. This is something that is 
only to require DOD to give preference 
to firms that will hire locally, and it is 
to the extent practical. If that is not 
practical, there are, as was said, waiv-
ers and other reasons why we can push 
this forward. I don’t want this to be 
something that pushes in that direc-
tion. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
vote ‘‘yes,’’ and I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. WALTZ. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from Virginia 
(Mr. WITTMAN). 
Mr. WITTMAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise in 
opposition to this amendment. 
Again, this is really about making 
sure that there is the proper workforce 
placed in the right areas where the 
work is to be done. 
We have heard time and time again 
today that the unavailability of skilled 
workforce in many areas is causing 
delays in construction jobs. The last 
thing we need is delays in military con-
struction jobs because of this incon-
sistency in the availability of a skilled 
workforce. 
It 
also 
undermines 
competition. 
Competition is a good thing. Why 
wouldn’t we want to open it up and 
make sure that everybody who has the 
capability to do this work is able to 
compete? I think those things are in-
credibly important. 
When we don’t have competition, we 
know that that increases the cost to 
the United States Government. Why 
would we want to increase costs on 
these projects so we do fewer projects? 
There is already a backlog of these 
military construction projects. This 
will only add to the backlog. It will 
only make it more difficult to com-
plete these projects. It will add to the 
costs. It will add to delays. All of these 
things are counter to what we need to 
be doing. 
With a backlog of these projects, we 
need to be assuring that there is com-
petition reducing costs and reducing 
timeframes. 
Mr. WALTZ. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self the balance of my time. 
Military 
construction 
and 
sustainment is bureaucratic; it is cum-
bersome; it is slow; and it is not pro-
viding our servicemembers what they 
need. That needs to be the focus, pe-
riod. 
This provision would represent a mo-
mentous shift, a sea change in the way 
the Department of Defense and defense 
contractors perform work, with un-
known costs to both the government 
and the contractors, especially small 
business contractors. 
We have to get these projects done 
timely and on budget and get the fa-
cilities that we need to our service-
members. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge opposition, and I 
yield back the balance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to House Resolution 1224, the pre-
vious

At the end of subtitle J of title V, add the 
following: 
SEC. 5ll. SENSE OF CONGRESS REGARDING 
WOMEN 
INVOLUNTARILY 
SEPA-
RATED FROM THE ARMED FORCES 
DUE TO PREGNANCY OR PARENT-
HOOD. 
(a) 
FINDINGS.—Congress 
finds 
the 
fol-
lowing: 
(1) In June 1948, Congress enacted the 
Women’s Armed Services Integration Act of 
1948, which formally authorized the appoint-
ment and enlistment of women in the reg-
ular components of the Armed Forces. 
(2) With the expansion of the Armed Forces 
to include women, the possibility arose for 
the first time that members of the regular 
components of the Armed Forces could be-
come pregnant. 
(3) The response to such possibilities and 
actualities was Executive Order 10240, signed 
by President Harry S. Truman in 1951, which 
granted the Armed Forces the authority to 
involuntarily separate or discharge a woman 
if she became pregnant, gave birth to a child, 
or became a parent by adoption or a step-
parent. 
(4) The Armed Forces responded to the Ex-
ecutive order by systematically discharging 
any woman in the Armed Forces who became 
pregnant, regardless of whether the preg-
nancy was planned, unplanned, or the result 
of sexual abuse. 
(5) Although the Armed Forces were re-
quired to offer women who were involun-
tarily separated or discharged due to preg-
nancy the opportunity to request retention 
in the military, many such women were not 
offered such opportunity. 
(6) The Armed Forces did not provide re-
quired separation benefits, counseling, or as-
sistance to the members of the Armed Forces 
who were separated or discharged due to 
pregnancy. 
(7) Thousands of members of the Armed 
Forces were involuntarily separated or dis-
charged from the Armed Forces as a result of 
pregnancy. 
(8) There are reports that the practice of 
the Armed Forces to systematically separate 
or discharge pregnant members caused some 
such members to seek an unsafe or inacces-
sible abortion, which was not legal at the 
time, or to put their children up for adop-
tion, and that, in some cases, some women 
died by suicide following their involuntary

separation or discharge from the Armed 
Forces. 
(9) Such involuntary separation or dis-
charge from the Armed Forces on the basis 
of pregnancy was challenged in Federal dis-
trict court by Stephanie Crawford in 1975, 
whose legal argument stated that this prac-
tice violated her constitutional right to due 
process of law. 
(10) The Court of Appeals for the Second 
Circuit ruled in Stephanie Crawford’s favor 
in 1976 and found that Executive Order 10240 
and any regulations relating to the Armed 
Forces that made separation or discharge 
mandatory due to pregnancy were unconsti-
tutional. 
(11) By 1976, all regulations that permitted 
involuntary separation or discharge of a 
member of the Armed Forces because of 
pregnancy or any form of parenthood were 
rescinded. 
(12) Today, women comprise 17 percent of 
the Armed Forces, and many are parents, in-
cluding 12 percent of whom are single par-
ents. 
(13) While military parents face many 
hardships, today’s Armed Forces provides 
various lengths of paid family leave for 
mothers and fathers, for both birth and adop-
tion of children. 
(b) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of 
Congress that women who served in the 
Armed Forces before February 23, 1976, 
should not have been involuntarily separated 
or discharged due to pregnancy or parent-
hood. 
(c) 
EXPRESSION
OF
REMORSE.—Congress 
hereby expresses deep remorse for the women 
who patriotically served in the Armed 
Forces, but were forced, by official United 
States policy, to endure unnecessary and dis-
criminatory actions, including the violation 
of their constitutional right to due process 
of law, simply because they became pregnant 
or became a parent while a member of the 
Armed Forces.

At the end of division E, add the following: 
TITLE LIX—TAIWAN PEACE AND 
STABILITY ACT 
SEC. 5901. SHORT TITLE. 
This title may be cited as the ‘‘Taiwan 
Peace and Stability Act’’. 
SEC. 5902. FINDINGS AND STATEMENT OF POL-
ICY. 
(a) FINDINGS.—Congress makes the fol-
lowing findings: 
(1) The United States has consistently 
sought to advance peace and stability in 
East Asia as a central element of U.S. for-
eign policy toward the region. 
(2) The Government of the People’s Repub-
lic of China (PRC), especially since the elec-
tion of Tsai Ing-Wen in 2016, has conducted a 
coordinated campaign to weaken Taiwan 
diplomatically, economically, and militarily 
in a manner that threatens to erode U.S. pol-
icy and create a fait accompli on questions 
surrounding Taiwan’s future. 
(3) In order to ensure the longevity of U.S. 
policy and preserve the ability of the people 
of Taiwan to determine their future inde-
pendently, it is necessary to reinforce Tai-
wan’s diplomatic, economic, and physical 
space. 
(b) STATEMENT OF POLICY.—It is the policy 
of the United States to— 
(1) maintain the position that peace and 
stability in the Western Pacific are in the 
political, security, and economic interests of 
the United States, and are matters of inter-
national concern; and 
(2) work with allies and partners to pro-
mote peace and stability in the Indo-Pacific 
and deter military acts or other forms of co-
ercive behavior that would undermine re-
gional stability. 
SEC. 5903. DEFINITIONS. 
In this title— 
(1) the term ‘‘appropriate congressional 
committees’’ means— 
(A) the Committee on Foreign Affairs of 
the House of Representatives; and 
(B) the Committee on Foreign Relations of 
the Senate; 
(2) the term ‘‘international organization’’ 
includes United Nations funds, programs, 
specialized agencies, entities, and bodies, 
and other organizations outside of the 
United Nations system, as the Secretary of 
State or the Secretary’s designee deems ap-
propriate, and in consultation with other 
Federal departments and agencies; 
(3) the term ‘One-China Principle’ means 
the PRC’s policy toward Taiwan; 
(4) the term ‘‘civil society organizations’’ 
means international civil society organiza-
tions that are critical to maintaining Tai-
wan’s international space and enabling Tai-
wan to play a positive and constructive role 
in the global community; and 
(5) the term ‘‘potential PLA campaigns’’ 
means— 
(A) a naval blockade of Taiwan; 
(B) an amphibious assault and ground inva-
sion of Taiwan, especially such invasion de-
signed to accomplish a fiat accompli before 
intervention is possible; and 
(C) a seizure of one or more of Taiwan’s 
outlying islands. 
Subtitle A—Supporting Taiwan’s Meaningful 
Participation in the International Commu-
nity 
SEC. 5911. FINDINGS. 
Congress makes the following findings: 
(1) Taiwan has provided monetary, human-
itarian, and medical assistance to combat 
diseases such as AIDS, tuberculosis, Ebola, 
and dengue fever in countries around the 
world. During the COVID–19 pandemic, Tai-
wan donated millions of pieces of personal 
protective equipment and COVID–19 tests to 
countries in need. 
(2) Since 2016, the Gambia, Sao Tome and 
Principe, Panama, the Dominican Republic, 
Burkina Faso, El Salvador, the Solomon Is-
lands, and Kiribati have severed diplomatic 
relations with Taiwan in favor of diplomatic 
relations with China. 
(3) Taiwan was invited to participate in the 
World Health Assembly, the decision-making 
body of the World Health Organization 
(WHO), as an observer annually between 2009 
and 2016. Since the 2016 election of President 
Tsai, the PRC has increasingly resisted Tai-
wan’s participation in the WHA. Taiwan was 
not invited to attend the WHA in 2017, 2018, 
2019, 2020, or 2021. 
(4) The Taipei Flight Information Region 
reportedly served 1.75 million flights and 68.9 
million passengers in 2018 and is home to 
Taiwan Taoyuan International airport, the 
eleventh busiest airport in the world. Taiwan 
has been excluded from participating at the 
International Civil Aviation Organization 
(ICAO) since 2013. 
(5) United Nations (UN) General Assembly 
Resolution 2758 does not address the issue of 
representation of Taiwan and its people at 
the United Nations, nor does it give the PRC 
the right to represent the people of Taiwan. 
SEC. 5912. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON TAIWAN’S 
MEANINGFUL 
PARTICIPATION 
IN 
THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY. 
It is the sense of Congress that— 
(1) Taiwan is free, democratic, and pros-
perous, and is home to 23.5 million people. It 
is an important contributor to the global 
community, as a model for democracy, and 
by providing expertise in global health, 
international aviation security, emerging 
technology development, and with forward 
looking environmental policies; 
(2) multiple United States Government ad-
ministrations of both political parties have 
taken important steps to advance Taiwan’s 
meaningful participation in international or-
ganizations; 
(3) existing efforts to enhance U.S. co-
operation with Taiwan to provide global pub-
lic goods, including through development as-
sistance, humanitarian assistance, and dis-
aster relief in trilateral and multilateral 
fora is laudable and should continue; 
(4) nonetheless, significant structural, pol-
icy, and legal barriers remain to advancing 
Taiwan’s meaningful participation in the 
international community; and 
(5) efforts to share Taiwan’s expertise with 
other parts of the global community could be 
further enhanced through a systematic ap-
proach, along with greater attention from 
Congress and the American public to such ef-
forts. 
SEC. 5913. STRATEGY TO SUPPORT TAIWAN’S 
MEANINGFUL 
PARTICIPATION 
IN 
INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS. 
(a) IN GENERAL.—Not later than 180 days 
after the date of the enactment of this Act, 
the Secretary of State, in consultation with 
other Federal departments and agencies as 
appropriate, shall submit to the appropriate 
congressional committees a strategy— 
(1) to advance Taiwan’s meaningful par-
ticipation in a prioritized set of inter-
national organizations (IOs); and 
(2) that responds to growing pressure from 
the PRC on foreign governments, IOs, com-
mercial actors, and civil society organiza-
tions to comply with its ‘‘One-China Prin-
ciple’’, with respect to Taiwan. 
(b) MATTERS TO BE INCLUDED.— 
(1) IN GENERAL.—The strategy required in 
paragraph (a) shall include: 
(A) An assessment of the methods the PRC 
uses to coerce actors to into adhering to its 
‘‘One-China Principle.’’ The methods shall 
include those employed against govern-
ments, IOs, and civil society organizations. 
The assessment shall also include pressure 
on commercial actors, to the extent it is rel-
evant in the context of Taiwan’s meaningful 
participation in IOs. 
(B) An assessment of the policies of foreign 
governments toward the PRC and Taiwan, to 
identify likeminded allies and partners who 
might become public or private partners in 
the strategy. 
(C) A systematic analysis of all IOs, as 
practicable, to identify IOs that best lend 
themselves to advancing Taiwan’s participa-
tion. The analysis shall include, but is not 
limited to the IOs’— 
(i) policy on the requirements to obtain 
membership and observer status, as well as 
the foundational documents defining mem-
bership requirements and observer status 
within the IO; 
(ii) participation rules; 
(iii) processes for developing membership 
requirements and participation rules; 
(iv) policies of current members regarding 
Taiwan’s political status; and 
(v) relative reliance on contributions from 
the PRC and how it may affect internal deci-
sion making. 
(D) An evaluation of the feasibility and ad-
visability of expanding economic, security, 
and diplomatic engagement with nations 
that have demonstrably strengthened, en-
hanced, or upgraded relations with Taiwan, 
where it aligns with U.S. interests. 
(E) A survey of IOs that have allowed Tai-
wan’s meaningful participation, including an 
assessment of whether any erosion in Tai-
wan’s engagement has occurred within those 
organizations and how Taiwan’s participa-
tion has positively strengthened the capac-
ity and activity of these organizations, 
thereby providing positive models for Tai-
wan’s inclusion in other similar forums. 
(F) A list of no more than 20 IOs at which 
the U.S. Government will prioritize for using 
its voice, vote, and influence to advance Tai-
wan’s meaningful participation over the 
three-year period following the date of en-
actment of this Act. The list shall be derived 
from the IOs identified in paragraph (1)(C). 
(G) A description of the diplomatic strate-
gies and the coalitions the U.S. Government 
plans to develop to implement paragraph 
(b)(1)(F). 
(c) FORM
OF
REPORT.—The strategy re-
quired in subsection (a) shall be classified, 
but it may include an unclassified summary, 
if the Secretary of State determines it ap-
propriate. 
(d) CONSULTATION.—The Secretary of State 
or his or her designee, shall consult with the 
appropriate congressional committees— 
(1) no later than 90 days after the date of 
enactment of this Act, on the list of IOs 
identified in subsection (b)(1)(C); and 
(2) 180 days after submitting the strategy 
required in subsection (a), and 180 days 
thereafter for two years, regarding the devel-
opment and implementation of the strategy.

DEVELOPMENT COOPERATION. 
(a) IN GENERAL.—No later than 120 days 
following the date of enactment of this Act, 
the Administrator of the United States 
Agency 
for 
International 
Development 
(USAID), in consultation with the U.S. Inter-
national Development Finance Corporation 
(DFC), shall submit to the appropriate con-
gressional committees a report on coopera-
tion with Taiwan on trilateral and multilat-
eral development initiatives through the 
American Institute in Taiwan as appro-
priate. 
(b) MATTERS TO BE INCLUDED.—The report 
required by subsection (a) shall include: 
(1) A comprehensive review of existing co-
operation mechanisms and initiatives be-
tween USAID or DFC, and relevant depart-
ments and agencies in Taiwan, including, but 
not limited to Taiwan’s International Co-
operation and Development Fund (ICDF). 
(2) An assessment of how USAID and DFC 
development cooperation with relevant de-
partments and agencies in Taiwan compares 
to comparable cooperation with partners of 
similar economic size and foreign assistance 
capacity. 
(3) An analysis of the opportunities and 
challenges the cooperation reviewed in para-
graph (1) has offered to date. The analysis 
shall include, but is not limited to— 
(A) opportunities collaboration has offered 
to expand USAID’s and DFC’s ability to de-
liver assistance into a wider range commu-
nities; 
(B) sectors where USAID, DFC, ICDF, 
other relevant agencies and departments in 
Taiwan, or the organizations’ implementing 
partners have a comparative advantage in 
providing assistance; 
(C) opportunities to transition virtual ca-
pacity building events with relevant depart-
ments and agencies in Taiwan, through the 
Global Cooperation and Training Framework 
(GCTF) as well as other forums, into in-per-
son, enduring forms of development coopera-
tion. 
(4) An assessment of any legal, policy, 
logistical, financial, or administrative bar-
riers to expanding cooperation in trilateral 
or multilateral development. The analysis 
shall include, but is not limited to— 
(A) availability of personnel at the Amer-
ican Institute in Taiwan (AIT) responsible 
for coordinating development assistance co-
operation; 
(B) volume of current cooperation initia-
tives and barriers to expanding it; 
(C) diplomatic, policy, or legal barriers fac-
ing the United States or other partners to in-

tilateral development cooperation mecha-
nisms; 
(D) resource or capacity barriers to ex-
panding 
cooperation 
facing 
the 
United 
States or Taiwan; and

operation might require. 
(c) FORM
OF
REPORT.—The strategy re-
quired in subsection (a) shall be unclassified, 
but it may include a classified annex if the 
Administrator of USAID determines it ap-
propriate. 
Subtitle B—Advancing Taiwan’s Economic 
Space 
SEC. 5921. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON EXPANDING 
U.S. ECONOMIC RELATIONS WITH 
TAIWAN. 
It is the sense of the Congress that— 
(1) expanding U.S. economic relations with 
Taiwan has benefited the people of both the 
United States and Taiwan. Taiwan is now 
the United States 10th largest goods trading 
partner, 13th largest export market, 13th 
largest source of imports, and a key destina-
tion for U.S. agricultural exports; 
(2) further integration, consistent with ro-
bust 
environmental 
standard 
and 
labor 
rights, would benefit both peoples and is in 
the strategic and diplomatic interests of the 
United States; and 
(3) the United States should explore oppor-
tunities to expand economic agreements be-
tween 
Taiwan 
and 
the 
United 
States, 
through dialogue, and by developing the 
legal templates required to support potential 
future agreements. 
Subtitle C—Enhancing Deterrence Over 
Taiwan 
SEC. 5931. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON PEACE AND 
STABILITY IN THE TAIWAN STRAIT. 
It is the sense of Congress that— 
(1) PRC attempts to intimidate Taiwan, in-
cluding through high rates of PRC sorties 
into air space near Taiwan, and PRC amphib-
ious assault exercises near Taiwan, jeopard-
izes the long-standing U.S. position that dif-
ferences in cross-Strait relations must be re-
solved peacefully; 
(2) given the potential for a cross-Strait 
conflict to be highly destructive and desta-
bilizing, any increase in the risk of conflict 
demands attention and obligates leaders to 
reinforce deterrence, as the most viable 
means to prevent war; 
(3) Taiwan should continue to implement 
its asymmetric defense strategy, including 
investing in cost-effective and resilient capa-
bilities, while also strengthening recruit-
ment and training of its reserve and civil de-
fense forces, and those capabilities include 
coastal defense cruise missiles; and 
(4) while enhancing deterrence, it is also 
essential to maintain open and effective cri-
sis communication and risk reduction mech-
anisms, as a means to reduce the risk of mis-
understanding and ultimately, conflict. 
SEC. 5932. STRATEGY TO ENHANCE DETERRENCE 
OVER A CROSS-STRAIT CONFLICT. 
(a) IN GENERAL.—No later than 90 days 
after the date of enactment of this Act, the 
President shall submit to the appropriate 
congressional committees a whole-of-govern-
ment strategy to enhance deterrence over a 
cross-Strait military conflict between the 
PRC and Taiwan. 
(b) MATTERS TO BE INCLUDED.—The strat-
egy shall include: 
(1) A comprehensive review of existing dip-
lomatic, economic, and military tools to es-
tablish deterrence over a cross-Strait con-
flict and an assessment of their efficacy. 
(2) An examination of the present and fu-
ture capabilities of the United States and 
Taiwan to respond to the potential PLA 
campaigns against Taiwan in 5, 10, and 15 
years. The analysis shall include an assess-
ment of the progress Taiwan has made in de-
veloping the cost-effective and resilient ca-
pabilities needed to respond to its strategic 
environment, as well as any additional per-
sonnel, procurement, or training reforms re-
quired. 
(3) An evaluation of the feasibility of ex-
panding coordination with U.S. allies and 
partners to enhance deterrence over a cross- 
Strait conflict. The review shall include, but 
is not limited to, a review of the following 
matters: 
(A) Expanding coordination of public or 
private messaging on deterrence vis-a`-vis 
Taiwan. 
(B) Coordinating use of economic tools to 
raise the costs of PRC military action that 
could precipitate a cross-Strait conflict. 
(C) Enhancing co-development and co-de-
ployment of military capabilities related to 
deterrence over a cross-Strait conflict, or en-
hancing coordinated training of Taiwan’s 
military forces. 
(4) Recommendations on significant addi-
tional diplomatic, economic, and military 
steps available to the U.S. Government, uni-
laterally and in concert with U.S. allies and 
partners, to enhance the clarity and credi-
bility of deterrence over a cross-Strait con-
flict. 
(5) A description of any additional re-
sources or authorities needed to implement 
the recommendations identified in paragraph 
(5). 
(c) FORM
OF
REPORT.—The strategy re-
quired in subsection (b) shall be classified, 
but it may include an unclassified annex, if 
determined appropriate by the President. 
(d) CONSULTATION.—No later than 90 days 
after the date of enactment of this Act, and 
not less frequently than every 180 days 
thereafter for seven years, the President or 
his or her designee, as well as representa-
tives from the agencies and departments in-
volved in developing the strategy required in 
paragraph (a) shall consult with the appro-
priate congressional committees regarding 
the development and implementation of the 
strategy required in this section. The rep-
resentatives shall be at the Undersecretary 
level or above. 
SEC. 5933. STRENGTHENING TAIWAN’S CIVILIAN 
DEFENSE PROFESSIONALS. 
(a) IN GENERAL.—No later than 180 days 
following enactment of this Act, the Sec-
retary of State, in consultation with the 
Secretary of Defense, shall present to the ap-
propriate congressional committees a plan 
for strengthening the community of civilian 
defense professionals in Taiwan, facilitated 
through the American Institute in Taiwan as 
appropriate. 
(b) MATTERS TO BE INCLUDED.—The report 
shall include the following: 
(1) A comprehensive review of existing U.S. 
Government and non-U.S. Government pro-
grammatic and funding modalities to sup-
port Taiwan’s civilian defense professionals 
in pursuing professional development, edu-
cational, and cultural exchanges in the 
United States. The review shall include, but 
is not limited to— 
(A) opportunities through U.S. Department 
of State-supported programs, such as the 
International Visitor Leaders Program; and 
(B) opportunities offered through non-gov-
ernmental institutions, such as think tanks, 
to the extent the review can practicably 
make such an assessment. 
(2) A description of the frequency that ci-
vilian defense professionals from Taiwan 
pursue or are selected for the programs re-
viewed in paragraph (1). 
(3) An analysis of any funding, policy, ad-
ministrative, or other barriers preventing 
greater participation from Taiwan’s civilian 
defense professionals in the opportunities 
identified in paragraph (1). 
(4) An evaluation of the value expanding 
the opportunities reviewed in paragraph (1) 
would offer for strengthening Taiwan’s exist-
ing civilian defense community, and for in-
creasing the perceived value of the field for 
young professionals in Taiwan. 
(5) An assessment of options the United 
States Government could take individually, 
with partners in Taiwan, or with foreign gov-
ernments or non-governmental partners, to 
expand the opportunities reviewed in para-
graph (1). 
(6) A description of additional resources 
and authorities that may be required to exe-
cute the options in paragraph (5). 
(c) FORM OF REPORT.—The report required 
in subsection (a) shall be unclassified, but it 
may include a classified annex, if determined 
appropriate.

SEC. 5ll. SENSE OF CONGRESS REGARDING 
SERVICE OF GARY ANDREW CYR. 
(a) 
FINDINGS.—Congress 
finds 
the 
fol-
lowing: 
(1) On February 23, 1971, Corporal Gary An-
drew Cyr was 19 years old. 
(2) Corporal Cyr was assigned to the 10th 
Pathfinder Detachment in May of 1970 and 
served as a Special Operations Pathfinder 
until January 1972. 
(3) In February 1971, Corporal Cyr’s Path-
finder Unit was tasked with supporting Oper-
ation Dak Soo Ri 71–1, a joint operation with 
Korean infantry units. 
(4) On February 23, 1971, Corporal Cyr was 
the Pathfinder air traffic controller and 
cargo loadmaster for four flights and twelve 
landing pickup zones for the Operation, in-
cluding the primary insertion point. 
(5) This Operation involved the insertion of 
over 1,000 Korean soldiers from two divisions 
and 31 sling loads of cargo transported by 35 
helicopters over the course of the evening of 
February 23, 1971. 
(6) Corporal Cyr was responsible for coordi-
nating incoming helicopter flights and pro-
viding accurate on-the-ground information 
to the pilots, essentially operating as a one- 
man air traffic control tower inside a combat 
zone. 
(7) Corporal Cyr’s leadership and execution 
enabled the mission to be completed in a 
minimum time period with no damaged 
cargo or casualties. 
(8) Corporal Cyr’s actions were hailed by 
helicopter pilots and officers from the insert-
ing battalions. 
(9) Corporal Cyr’s actions on February 23 
epitomized the Pathfinder motto of ‘‘First 
in, Last out,’’. 
(10) William P. Murphy, Commander of the 
10th Pathfinder Detachment, submitted a 
recommendation for the award of a Bronze 
Star to Corporal Cyr to 10th Combat Avia-
tion Battalion Commander, Captain Charles 
E. Markham. 
(11) Captain Markham approved the rec-
ommendation and submitted it to 17th Avia-
tion Group Commander, Lieutenant Colonel 
Jack A. Walker. 
(12) Lieutenant Colonel Walker approved 
the recommendation. 
(13) The 10th Pathfinder Detachment began 
to stand down in December 1971 and deacti-
vated in January 1972, before Corporal Cyr 
could be awarded the Bronze Star. 
(14) Corporal Cyr’s initial award was lost 
as a result of the deactivation. 
(b) PURPOSE.—That the House of Rep-
resentatives— 
(1) honors the heroism of Corporal Gary 
Andrew Cyr to successfully insert troops and 
ammunition on time and on target; and 
(2) believes the United States Army, in 
light of new information, should consider re-
visiting decorating and honoring the courage 
and leadership of Corporal Gary Andrew Cyr.

WOMEN WHO SERVED AS CADET

(a) FINDINGS.—Congress makes the fol-
lowing findings: 
(1) In June of 1943, Congress enacted the 
Bolton Act, establishing the United States 
Cadet Nurse Corps as a uniformed service of 
the Public Health Administration. Through 
the Corps, women received free, expedited 
nursing education in exchange for ‘‘service 
in essential nursing for the duration of the 
war’’. 
(2) During World War II, the Nation faced 
a severe shortage of qualified nurses, threat-
ening the ability of the United States to 
meet domestic and military medical needs. 
(3) In total, 124,065 women graduated from 
training under the Cadet Nurse program, 
going on to serve in military hospitals, Vet-
erans Administration hospitals, Marine hos-
pitals, private hospitals, public health agen-
cies, and public hospitals until the program 
ended in 1948. 
(4) In 1944, the Federal Security Agency 
identified ‘‘national recognition for ren-
dering a vital war service’’ as a privilege of 
service in the Corps. 
(5) By 1945, Cadet Nurses accounted for 80 
percent of the domestic nursing workforce. 
(6) The Cadet Nurse Corps has been cred-
ited with preventing the collapse of the do-
mestic nursing workforce. 
(b) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of 
Congress that women who served in the 
Cadet Nurse Corps honorably stepped up for 
their country during its time of need in 
World War II, significantly contributing to 
the war effort and the safety and security of 
the Nation. 
(c) EXPRESSION
OF
GRATITUDE.—Congress 
hereby expresses deep gratitude for the 
women who answered the call to duty and 
served in the Cadet Nurse Corps.

has undertaken the responsibility and obli-
gation to provide and ensure the security

tiations for their renewal.

tinue its engagement in the negotiations of 
the Compacts of Free Association, in coordi-

dential Envoy for Compact Negotiations to 
support the negotiations for the renewal of 
Compact provisions.

the table of sections at the beginning of such 
chapter accordingly): 
‘‘§ 2698. 
Access 
to 
military 
installations: 
standards for entry to military installations 
in United States 
‘‘(a) ACCESS TO MILITARY INSTALLATIONS IN 
UNITED STATES.—(1) The Secretary of De-
fense shall maintain access standards appli-
cable to all military installations in the 
United States. Such standards shall require 
screening standards appropriate to the type 
of installation involved, the security level of 
the installation, the category of individuals 
authorized to visit the installation, and the 
level of access to be granted, including— 
‘‘(A) protocols and criteria to determine 
the fitness of the individual to enter an in-
stallation; 
‘‘(B) standards and methods for verifying 
the identity of the individual; and 
‘‘(C) other factors the Secretary deter-
mines appropriate. 
‘‘(2) In developing the standards under 
paragraph (1), the Secretary shall, with re-
spect to military installations in the United 
States— 
‘‘(A) 
include 
procedures 
for 
recurring 
unescorted access to facilitate future visits 
to the installation for individuals who— 
‘‘(i) are non-Department of Defense per-
sonnel; and 
‘‘(ii) are determined to be eligible under 
such standards; and 
‘‘(B) ensure that access for such individ-
uals is based on the use of credentials non- 
Department of Defense personnel already 
posses, to the extent practical. 
‘‘(3) Upon publication in the Federal Reg-
ister of final regulations to carry out para-
graph (1), the Secretary shall publish the 
standards set forth therein on a publicly ac-
cessible Internet website of the Department 
of Defense. 
‘‘(4) In carrying out this subsection, the 
Secretary shall seek to procure and field ex-
isting identification screening technology 
(including technology to enable the Sec-
retary to validate other Federally recognized 
access credentials) and develop additional 
technology only to the extent necessary to 
assist commanders of military installations 
in the United States in implementing the 
standards under paragraph (1) at points of 
entry for such installations. 
‘‘(b) 
PRE-ARRIVAL
REGISTRATION
AND 
SCREENING PROTOCOL
FOR ACCESS
TO MILI-
TARY INSTALLATIONS IN UNITED STATES.—The 
Secretary shall ensure that the standards 
under subsection (a) include a specific pro-
tocol for the voluntary pre-arrival registra-
tion and screening of individuals antici-
pating a need for access to a military instal-
lation in the United States to establish the 
fitness and purpose of such individual. Under 
such protocol— 
‘‘(1) such a screening shall occur not less 
than 24 hours, and not more than 14 days 
prior, to the time of such access; and 
‘‘(2) if an individual is determined fit to 
enter the installation pursuant to the pre-ar-
rival registration and screening, access may 
only be granted upon arrival at the military 
installation on the date of the established 
purpose, following a verification of the iden-
tity of the individual. 
‘‘(c) UNESCORTED ACCESS TO MILITARY IN-
STALLATIONS IN UNITED STATES FOR CERTAIN 
INDIVIDUALS.—The Secretary shall maintain 
guidance 
regarding 
the 
granting 
of 
unescorted access to military installations 
in the United States for covered individuals 
and ensure such guidance is circulated to the 
commanders of each such military installa-
tion. Such guidance shall— 
‘‘(1) identify the categories of covered indi-
viduals that may obtain such unescorted ac-
cess; 
‘‘(2) include a list of credentials that can 
be used for access to an installation that are, 
to the extent practical, types of identifica-
tion non-Department of Defense personnel 
already posses. 
‘‘(3) be consistent across military installa-
tions in the United States; and 
‘‘(4) be in accordance with any privileges or 
benefits accorded under, procedures devel-
oped pursuant to, or requirements of, each 
covered provision and subsection (a). 
‘‘(d) PHYSICAL ENTRANCES TO CERTAIN MILI-
TARY
INSTALLATIONS.—The Secretary shall 
ensure that, to the extent practicable— 
‘‘(1) each military installation in the 
United States has a designated main en-
trance that, at all times, is manned by at 
least one member of the Armed Forces or ci-
vilian employee of the Department; 
‘‘(2) the location of each such designated 
main entrance is published on a publicly ac-
cessible Internet website of the Department; 
‘‘(3) if a military installation in the United 
States has any additional entrance des-
ignated for commercial deliveries to the 
military installation, the location of such 
entrance (and any applicable days or hours 
of operation for such entrance) is published 
on the same Internet website specified in 
paragraph (2); and 
‘‘(4) the information published on the 
Internet website specified in paragraph (2) is 
reviewed and, as necessary, updated on a 
basis that is not less frequent than annually. 
‘‘(e) REVIEWS
AND
SUBMISSION
TO
CON-
GRESS.—On a basis that is not less frequent 
than once every five years, the Secretary 
shall— 
‘‘(1) review the standards and guidance 
under this section, and make such updates as 
may be determined appropriate by the Sec-
retary; and 
‘‘(2) submit to the Committees on Armed 
Services of the House of Representatives and 
the Senate the most recently reviewed and, 
as applicable, updated version of such stand-
ards and guidance. 
‘‘(f) DEFINITIONS.—In this section: 
‘‘(3) The term ‘covered individual’ means, 
with respect to a military installation in the 
United States, the following: 
‘‘(A) A member of the armed forces or ci-
vilian employee of the Department of De-

the conflict, fighting valiantly both in and 
alongside the United States Armed Forces, 
often making the ultimate sacrifice, with 
many later becoming United States citizens. 
(2) Military cooperation in the Vietnam 
War is one of several examples that dem-
onstrate the robust alliance of the United 
States and Republic of Korea, under shared 
commitment to democratic principles. 
(3) During the Vietnam conflict, more than 
3,000,000 members of the United States 
Armed Forces fought bravely to preserve and 
defend these ideals, among them many Ko-
rean Americans who earned citations for 
their heroism and honorable service. 
(4) The Republic of Korea joined the Viet-
nam conflict to support the United States 
Armed Forces and the cause of freedom at 
the request of the United States. 
(5) From 1964 until the last soldier left Sai-
gon on March 23, 1973, 325,517 members of the 
Republic of Korea’s Armed Forces served in 
Vietnam, the largest contribution of troops 
sent by an ally of the United States. 
(6) Republic of Korea forces fought bravely 
throughout the theater and were known for 
their dedication, tenacity, and effectiveness 
on the battlefield. 
(7) More than 17,000 Korean soldiers were 
injured, and over 4,400 Korean soldiers made 
the ultimate sacrifice in defense of United 
States friends and allies. 
(8) There are approximately 3,000 natural-
ized Korean Americans who served in the 
Vietnam War currently living in the United 
States, many of whom suffer from signifi-
cant injuries due to their service in Vietnam, 
including post-traumatic stress disorder, 
total disability, and the effects of the toxic 
defoliant Agent Orange. 
(9) Korean-American veterans of the Viet-
nam conflict upheld the highest ideals of the 
United States through their dedicated serv-
ice and considerable sacrifices, with many 
continuing to carry the visible and invisible 
wounds of war to this day. 
(b) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of 
Congress that Korean and Korean-American 
Vietnam War veterans who served alongside 
the United States Armed Forces in the Viet-
nam conflict fought with honor and valor. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to House Resolution 1224, the gen-
tleman from Washington (Mr. SMITH) 
and the gentleman from Alabama (Mr. 
ROGERS) each will control 15 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from Washington. 
Mr. 
SMITH 
of 
Washington. 
Mr. 
Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gen-
tleman 
from 
Massachusetts 
(Mr. 
AUCHINCLOSS). 
Mr. AUCHINCLOSS. Mr. Speaker, 
while I will be unable to support the 
NDAA if it includes a provision that 
would derail offshore wind production, 
I thank the Chair for crafting a bill 
that continues to orient our military 
strategy toward the Indo-Pacific and 
for including three of my amendments. 
The first amendment requires an 
independent evaluation of the Penta-
gon’s procurement practices to ensure 
that, in keeping with the law, it drives 
a harder bargain with the commercial 
sector. The Pentagon’s price tag is too 
high in large measure because the bu-
reaucracy too often pays for process, 
not performance. 
My second amendment would encour-
age the DOD to use innovative housing 
production companies to build multi-
family homes for Active servicemem-
bers. This will bring down housing and 
energy costs for military families 
while also spurring innovative housing 
development models that will benefit 
the wider economy. 
My third amendment would help es-
tablish a process for alerting service-
members about exposure to PFAS so 
that they may get the care they need. 
Again, it is my hope that this spurs 
best practices for wider adoption as 
Americans in Massachusetts and be-
yond grapple with the fallout from 
PFAS exposure. 
Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Mr. Speak-
er, I rise in support of this en bloc 
amendment, and I yield 2 minutes to 
the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. 
STAUBER). 
Mr. STAUBER. Mr. Speaker, re-
cently, a grassroots group of service-
members created a survey called the 
‘‘Congressional 
Survey 
of 
Account-
ability, Truth, and Freedom.’’ The sur-
vey includes over 60 pages of testimony 
from nearly 600 servicemembers de-
scribing the discriminatory treatment 
they have received from the Depart-
ment of Defense in their attempts to 
receive a religious or medical exemp-
tion from COVID–19 vaccine mandates. 
Experienced servicemembers are fac-
ing an unfair choice: Get the shot 
against their personal or religious be-
liefs in order to continue their patri-
otic service in defense of our freedoms 
or sacrifice their military careers and 
risk the benefits that help their fami-
lies make ends meet. 
I am aware that certain branches of 
the military are self-reporting infor-
mation on religious and medical ex-
emptions. However, it is important 
that there is a detailed, congression-
ally mandated report that requires the 
Department of Defense to be as trans-
parent as possible regarding their deni-
als of religious and medical exemp-
tions. 
My amendment would require the 
DOD to report every 60 days on the 
number of religious and medical ex-
emptions for the COVID–19 vaccine re-
quirement requested and denied and 
the reasons for such denials; the num-
ber of members denied an exemption 
who then complied with the require-
ment and got the shot against their be-
liefs; and the number of members de-
nied an exemption who did not comply 
and were separated from service. We 
need to bring to light just how many 
servicemembers have been coerced to 
get the vaccine or forced to separate 
and for what reasons. 
This mandate is putting our national 
security at risk for no good reason, and 
I am certain this amendment will 
prove that. 
Mr. Speaker, I encourage my col-
leagues to support my amendment. 
Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Mr. Speak-
er, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman 
from Florida (Mr. RUTHERFORD). 
Mr. RUTHERFORD. Mr. Speaker, I 
rise in support of Stauber amendment 
No. 83 that is in this en bloc. 
This amendment would simply pro-
vide oversight over the DOD’s manage-
ment of religious and medical exemp-
tions for the COVID–19 vaccine require-
ment. 
At a time when we need every serv-
icemember we can get, I am concerned 
that there are people being discharged 
from the military without full consid-
eration of their religious or medical ex-
emptions. 
b 1645 
Mr. RUTHERFORD. Mr. Speaker, it 
is past time for more transparency in 
the exemption process so we can ensure 
that our servicemembers’ requests are 
being properly considered and fairly 
adjudicated. 
While I don’t think our servicemem-
bers should be subject to the COVID–19 
vaccine at all, the least we can do is 
bring transparency to the process of 
those who are seeking a legitimate ex-
emption. 
I thank Mr. STAUBER for introducing 
this 
commonsense 
amendment 
and 
looking out for the best interests of 
our men and women in uniform. 
Mr. 
SMITH 
of 
Washington. 
Mr. 
Speaker, I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Mr. Speak-
er, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman 
from Texas (Mr. BURGESS), my col-
league. 
Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman for yielding. 
This en bloc includes my amendment 
No. 114 to require the Secretary of De-
fense to submit a report to Congress 
every 6 months detailing the short- and 
long-term plan for the Pentagon’s re-
sponse to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. 
Russia invaded Ukraine in February, 
and yet, we have not had another brief-
ing by our military generals and the 
State Department and Director of Na-
tional Intelligence as we did prior to 
that invasion. 
Now, as was reported on FOX News 
by Jacqui Heinrich on February 5 of 
this year, General Milley predicted 
that Kyiv would fall in 3 days’ time. 
That did not happen. The Ukrainian 
people have bravely been fighting this 
war, and it has now evolved into a war 
of attrition. 
But Congress has not been read into 
any of the administration’s plans. The 
Speaker of the House brought a bill to 
the floor rapidly to provide $40 billion 
to the military effort in Ukraine. 
I, like everyone else, am horrified by 
what Russia is doing on the ground in 
Ukraine. I supported that bill. But you 
cannot bring another bill to the floor 
of this House, asking for continued aid, 
when we have not even had a report or 
briefing by the people advising the ad-
ministration on what is happening on 
the ground. 
We have to have that information. 
Simply adding more money to what 
has already gone without a strategy to 
back up that assessment is a failure on 
the part of the House of Representa-
tives and one in which I will not par-
ticipate. 
Mr. 
SMITH 
of 
Washington. 
Mr. 
Speaker, I reserve the balance of my 
time.

Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Mr. Speak-
er, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman 
from Texas (Mr. CRENSHAW), another 
colleague from the Texas delegation. 
Mr. CRENSHAW. Mr. Speaker, I rise

ate a grant program for psychedelic 
treatment for PTSD. That may come 
as a shock to many, and I say good, be-
cause to be frank, we need new ideas

tle with veteran suicide. 
For our Active Duty servicemembers, 
the situation is even worse, as they are 
precluded from even trying treatments 
such as psychedelics that could save 
their lives and bring hope to their fam-
ilies. I aim to change that. 
First of all, this form of treatment 
actually isn’t new. It is proven, and it 
is 
tested. 
Many 
hear 
the 
word 
psychedelics, and they think acid trips 
from the sixties. They believe this 
amendment 
would 
legalize 
or 
deschedule psychedelics, but that is 
not what we are talking about here. 
What we are talking about is the 
proven use of psychedelics to treat 
PTSD. Private-sector research shows 
that following MDMA treatments, 88 
percent of veterans have a significant 
reduction in symptoms, and 67 percent 
no longer have PTSD. 
This treatment also has a face. It is 
servicemembers 
like 
Jonathan 
Lubecky, a veteran who made multiple 
suicide 
attempts 
until 
psychedelic 
treatments saved his life. He credits 
his treatment as the reason that his 
son, Joey, has a father instead of a 
folded flag. 
It is a man like Marcus Capone, a 
SEAL Team Six operator, who credits 
psychedelic therapy with treating his 
PTSD, saving his life, and bringing his 
family back together. 
It is my own friends, people I served 
with on the SEAL Teams who have 
told me that this cost effective, often 
one-time treatment has completely 
transformed their life. All I am asking 
is that we give our servicemembers the 
ability to access this treatment instead 
of forcing them to travel abroad to psy-
chedelic clinics to save their own life. 
Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to 
get outside of their comfort zone and 
vote for this amendment. Our service-
members deserve it. 
Mr. 
SMITH 
of 
Washington. 
Mr. 
Speaker, I yield 11⁄2 minutes to the gen-
tlewoman 
from 
Washington 
(Ms. 
STRICKLAND). 
Ms. STRICKLAND. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the chairman for yielding time. 
Mr. Speaker, I have the honor of rep-
resenting Joint Base Lewis-McChord, 
the largest military base on the West 
Coast, and tens of thousands of service-
members and their families who call 
the South Puget Sound home. I am 
pleased that the NDAA raises base pay 
by 4.6 percent and includes inflation 
bonuses. 
The top concern that I hear from 
command staff and servicemembers 
and their families is a lack of housing 
and housing that is affordable. That is 
why in April, I introduced a four-bill 
package ensuring every servicemember 
has a home. 
I am very pleased that this bill in-
cludes: 
The Basic Allowance for Housing Cal-
culation Improvement Act; and 
Increasing Home Ownership for Serv-
icemembers Act. 
This act directs DOD to create a 
more transparent and modernized way 
to calculate the housing allowance. 
The defense bill also directs DOD to 
consider restoring the housing allow-
ance back to 100 percent. 
I am also pleased that we will direct 
DOD to collect data on scholarship 
awards and ROTC program completion 
by gender, by race, and ethnicity. 
Many officers come through ROTC, but 
unfortunately, fewer officers of color 
come through ROTC compared to other 
commissioning sources. We must find 
out why. 
This year’s NDAA invests in the lives 
and livelihood of servicemembers and 
their families. I strongly urge adoption 
of this important legislation. 
Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Mr. Speak-
er, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman 
from Ohio (Mr. DAVIDSON). 
Mr. 
DAVIDSON. 
Mr. 
Speaker, 
I 
thank my colleagues that have done a 
lot of work on this NDAA. Frankly, it 
is a huge bill. We are deliberating on a 
lot of amendments, and frankly, we are 
not deliberating on a whole bunch 
more that I wish we could debate. 
I do want to rise in support of amend-
ment No. 35 offered by Representative 
JACOBS which is included in this en 
bloc package. This amendment would 
require the Department of Defense to 
report which agencies have purchased 
or used American location data, phone 
records, internet browsing data, and so 
on. Our amendment does not reveal 
any classified information. 
Purchasing 
sensitive 
data 
about 
Americans from data brokers and other 
sellers allows the Federal Government 
to 
potentially 
circumvent 
Fourth 
Amendment warrant requirements. 
So who is purchasing it is of interest. 
If it is recruiting command, to find 
how to microtarget people the way 
that probably many of our campaigns 
do, that is something different than 
what a lot of people fear that it is, that 
it is part of a surveillance program, 
and frankly, warrantless data collec-
tion on American citizens. 
Media reports from The Wall Street 
Journal, The New York Times, and 
others have documented the Depart-
ment of Defense’s purchasing of our 
sensitive data. Military intelligence 
and law enforcement agencies have the 
greatest 
power 
to 
abuse 
this 
warrantless access to our sensitive per-
sonal and private data. 
This transparency measure is a first 
step toward addressing the erosion of 
the Fourth Amendment, and I am 
proud to have cosponsored this amend-
ment with Representative JACOBS. 
I encourage all of my colleagues to 
protect our Fourth Amendment right 
to privacy. 
Mr. 
SMITH 
of 
Washington. 
Mr. 
Speaker, I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Mr. Speak-
er, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman 
from Florida (Mr. WALTZ). 
Mr. WALTZ. Mr. Speaker, I just want 
to take a moment. 
I have no issue in principle with more 
Joint Strike Fighters. We need more 
Joint Strike Fighters, and we need to 
continue to modernize our aviation 
fleet. 
My issue here is where the money for 
it comes from. As I was just saying in 
my previous comments, we have to as a 
body, we have to as a Congress, and as 
a military to stop robbing Peter to pay 
Paul, to stop robbing operations and 
maintenance to buy new things. 
Just as a few examples of the many 
accounts that would be decremented to 
pay for these F–35s: we have got $50 
million from Army operations and 
maintenance 
from 
their 
maneuver 
units, $100 million from Navy military 
manpower and personnel, $56 million 
from Air Force maintenance, $62 mil-
lion from base support, and the list 
continues. 
Colleagues, we have to build in the 
operations and maintenance for new 
things we want to buy rather than tak-
ing from the things we have already 
bought that literally cannot sail or fly. 
Mr. 
SMITH 
of 
Washington. 
Mr. 
Speaker, I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Mr. Speak-
er, I have no further speakers, so at 
this time, I would just urge adoption of 
this en bloc package and yield back the 
balance of my time. 
Mr. 
SMITH 
of 
Washington. 
Mr. 
Speaker, I too urge adoption of the en 
bloc amendments and yield back the 
balance of my time. 
Mr. LYNCH. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support 
of en bloc amendment number one to H.R. 
7900, the National Defense Authorization Act 
for Fiscal Year 2023. 
This en bloc amendment includes Lynch 
amendment number 82 which requires the 
Secretary of Defense to develop a plan to re-
imburse our service members and veterans 
who expended personal funds to evacuate 
their former translators, interpreters, security 
contractors, pilots, and other Afghan allies out 
of the country. In developing this plan, the 
Secretary would be required to lay out clear 
eligibility criteria, and to consult with the Sec-
retaries of State and Veterans’ Affairs as well 
as representatives from non-governmental or-
ganizations with expertise in supporting the 
evacuation of our Afghan allies. 
Mr. Speaker, it has been nearly one year 
since the U.S. officially withdrew its forces and 
diplomatic corps from Afghanistan. In that 
time, countless military and veteran volunteers 
have worked tirelessly to evacuate their Af-
ghan colleagues and bring them to safety. 
These dedicated Americans have often spent 
significant personal funds, including maxing 
out credit cards and exhausting military pen-
sions and life savings, to try to save the lives 
of those who fought and sacrificed alongside 
our forces, and who now face mortal danger 
under the Taliban regime. This amendment

July 13, 2022 
honors the dedication of these brave Ameri-
cans who have shown an unwavering loyalty 
to those Afghans who worked with us. 
I would like to extend my thanks to Armed 
Services Committee Chairman ADAM SMITH, 
Ranking Member MIKE
ROGERS, and their 
staffs for including my amendment in this en 
bloc and would urge my colleagues on both 
sides to support it. 
Mr. CARSON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in 
support of the National Defense Authorization 
Act (NDDA) and my bipartisan amendment 
which authorizes an increase of five million 
dollars for a pancreatic cancer early detection 
initiative (EDI) at the Department of Defense 
(DoD). I thank my colleagues, Rep. ESHOO 
and Rep. MCKINLEY, for their support and 
leadership on this issue. Pancreatic cancer 
has the lowest survival rate of all major can-
cers—in large part due to lack of research in 
early detection. I believe we all agree that the 
patients, families, friends and loved ones suf-
fering from this disease deserve greater sup-
port. 
My amendment will provide critical funding 
needed for more research and an early detec-
tion initiative under the Congressionally Di-
rected Medical Research Programs (CDMRP) 
at DoD. I was pleased that the Appropriations 
Defense Subcommittee appropriated fifteen 
million dollars for general pancreatic cancer 
research funding in this year’s funding legisla-
tion. While encouraging, we need to continue 
doing more and should increase funding to 
twenty million dollars in FY23. 
This issue has hit painfully close to home 
recently, as America lost giants to pancreatic 
cancer. Rep. John Lewis, our civil rights hero, 
passed away from pancreatic cancer only 
seven months after receiving his diagnosis. 
My good friend and colleague, Rep. Alcee 
Hastings, also passed from Pancreatic Cancer 
last year. And, Americans lost a fighter for vot-
ing rights and women’s protection, Justice 
Ruth Bader Ginsburg, to this deadly disease. 
And Alex Trebek, who was welcomed into 
people’s homes around the world, lost his bat-
tle to pancreatic cancer in 2020. We have lost 
too many loved ones and must do everything 
we can to save lives. It is unacceptable that, 
despite being the third leading cause of can-
cer-related death in our country, pancreatic 
cancer still does not have a dedicated early 
detection initiative. In fact, the lack of research 
in ways to detect pancreatic cancer early has 
led to devastating consequences: sixty-six per-
cent of patients live less than one year fol-
lowing their diagnosis. 
If diagnosed early, the five-year survival rate 
for pancreatic cancer patients is above eighty 
percent. However, if pancreatic cancer is de-
tected late, the five-year survival rate drops to 
less than five percent. By failing to support our 
nation’s researchers with the means to find 
new ways to detect pancreatic cancer early, 
we are leaving America’s pancreatic cancer 
patients with few ways to detect this disease 
in time to extend the quality and duration of 
their lives. 
It’s important to note that persistent health 
care inequities and disparities for communities 
of color compound the devastation of pan-
creatic cancer and the effects of lack of early 
detection research. Unfortunately, Black peo-
ple are more likely than their fellow Americans 
to get pancreatic cancer. In fact, the incidence 
rate for pancreatic cancer among Black Ameri-
cans is twenty percent higher than any other 
racial demographic. This disease is more 
deadly for us: the pancreatic cancer death rate 
is seventeen percent higher for Black men 
than white men. Significant evidence dem-
onstrates that these disproportionate levels of 
pancreatic cancer are in large part rooted in 
disparities in health care and access to tests 
and diagnostics. As a result, the lack of pan-
creatic cancer early detection research accel-
erates the racial unfairness in our health care 
system, with devastating consequences for mi-
norities. 
At a time when our country is having a na-
tional conversation about the deep disparities 
in access to health care for Black and Brown 
people during a global pandemic, Congress 
must do everything within our power to im-
prove health outcomes through research and 
treatment. Increasing dedicated funding for 
early detection research at DoD will help fill a 
critical gap in our pancreatic cancer research 
and will help address the pancreatic cancer 
disparities for communities of color. 
I 
urge 
the 
House 
to

this 
amendment.

Ms. ESCOBAR. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to ask for support for my amend-
ment to allow servicemembers to get 
their chains of command to process 
their complaints of harassment and 
prohibited discrimination in a timely 
manner. 
My amendment does not grant serv-
icemembers any new rights or expand 
existing ones, nor does it allow them to 
sue the Department of Defense. It sim-
ply gives them the leverage to hold 
their chains of command to their own 
timeline 
for 
processing 
complaints 
that have been filed.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H6266 
July 13, 2022 
Our servicemembers put their lives 
on the line protecting our country 
every day. They make the ultimate 
sacrifice to serve our country in ways 
that many cannot. 
When they file complaints alleging 
serious harassment and discrimination 
they have experienced while serving, 
they deserve to be heard and to receive 
timely responses. 
Data shows that civilian military 
employees file far more discrimination 
and harassment complaints than serv-
icemembers do, despite having a small-
er workforce than our servicemembers. 
This is because our servicemembers 
lack many of the protections and privi-
leges that their civilian counterparts 
have when it comes to discrimination 
and harassment, including this one. 
While this benefits all servicemem-
bers, my amendment would be espe-
cially significant for women and mi-
norities serving in the Armed Forces. 
Data 
from 
one 
Pentagon 
survey 
showed nearly a third of Black service-
members and a significant percentage 
of Asian and Hispanic servicemembers 
experience racial harassment, discrimi-
nation, or both during service. 
This is talent we need to work to re-
tain, and my amendment would help 
with that. Our servicemembers deserve 
meaningful and robust policies that en-
sure their complaints are processed ex-
peditiously and with the utmost ur-
gency. 
My amendment respects the separate 
internal administrative systems the 
services 
have 
for 
processing 
com-
plaints. It simply creates a time limit 
to ensure they are processed within a 
reasonable timeframe that is respectful 
of the servicemembers and their expe-
riences. 
Simply put, it ensures that after 180 
days, if a servicemember’s complaint 
remains unresolved, the servicemember 
can request a court order that would 
then direct the department to act on 
the case expeditiously. 
Absent this amendment, servicemem-
bers 
routinely 
wait 
months 
and 
months, and sometimes even years, for 
their complaints to be resolved, with 
no ability to urge the services to act on 
their complaints. 
This amendment brings an added 
level of urgency into internal adminis-
trative processes. 
My amendment would empower our 
servicemembers and bolster confidence 
in the systems in place. 
By passing this amendment, we are 
thereby extending protections civilians 
already enjoy onto our servicemem-
bers, whose battles should be fought on 
the battlefield, not within the ranks. 
b 1700 
Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Mr. Speak-
er, I rise in opposition to this amend-
ment. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman is recognized for 5 minutes. 
Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Mr. Speak-
er, this amendment creates an existen-
tial threat to the good order and dis-
cipline of the military. 
A servicemember may seek an order 
from the U.S. district court demanding 
a status update or final action within 
180 days after any supervisor or office 
receives a complaint. 
This creates an unprecedented right 
to sue the commanders and force out-
comes of administrative proceedings, 
some of which could be tied to active 
law enforcement investigations. An ac-
tivist district court judge could reverse 
or set aside the final decision of a com-
mander. 
I understand that some of my col-
leagues wish to do away with the 
UCMJ altogether. I believe this and 
other provisions are the first step to-
ward that end. 
This provision will not benefit those 
who need protection the most in the 
Armed Forces and will undermine the 
strong bipartisan work that has taken 
place on sexual harassment and sexual 
assault. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
oppose this amendment, and I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Ms. ESCOBAR. Mr. Speaker, I have 
tremendous respect for the ranking 
member and the work that he has done 
on our great committee. 
I do want to emphasize that service-
members would not be allowed to sue 
the Department of Defense. In fact, in 
many of these cases what happens is 
the cases are resolved by policy or 
should be resolved by policy within 
about 60 days, so this actually gives 
the service lines added time to resolve 
these cases. 
This is for those egregious exam-
ples—and I have spoken with service-
members who have had to live with 
these egregious examples—of lack of a 
true effort to resolve these harassment 
and discrimination claims. So this 
would be a last resort that would sim-
ply have a court urge the service line 
to complete the investigation of har-
assment or discrimination. 
We are currently experiencing a chal-
lenge in recruitment. We want to re-
tain this talent, and we want to dem-
onstrate to our servicemembers that 
they matter, all of them, and that we 
will ensure that they have access to a 
free and fair process. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Mr. Speak-
er, this amendment demolishes the 
good order and discipline of the mili-
tary and should be rejected. 
I urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘no,’’ 
and I yield back the balance of my 
time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to House Resolution 1224, the pre-
vious 
question

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to House Resolution 1224, the gen-
tleman from California (Mr. KHANNA) 
and a Member opposed each will con-
trol 5 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from California. 
Mr. KHANNA. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
Chairman SMITH as well as Ranking 
Member ROGERS for their leadership to 
include various measures in the under-
lying bill that will aid the Department 
of Defense’s effort to prevent and miti-
gate civilian harm, including estab-
lishing a Center of Excellence in Civil-
ian Harm Mitigation and Commission 
on Civilian Harm. 
I thank the HASC staff, including 
Katy Quinn, Phil MacNaughton, and 
Robert Ikoku for their work on this. 
It should not be a partisan issue to 
mitigate civilian harm. 
My amendment would simply author-
ize the resources for the Department of 
Defense to implement these policies of 
reducing 
civilian 
casualties, 
which 
Congress already required the Depart-
ment of Defense to do nearly 4 years 
ago. 
My amendment would allow the De-
partment of Defense to spend $5 million 
per year to implement the require-
ments of section 936 of the John 
McCain NDAA for Fiscal Year 2019. 
Section 936, passed by this body 4 
years ago, requires the Department of 
Defense to establish uniform processes 
and standards across combatant com-
mands for improving tracking, report-
ing, analysis, and response to civilian 
casualties from U.S. military oper-
ations. 
It is appropriately named after the 
late Senator John McCain, who be-
lieved deeply that the United States 
military should minimize civilian cas-
ualties. This is something that every-
one in our military believes. 
Now, the Department of Defense has 
made extraordinary progress in recent 
years in preventing civilian harm. Sec-
retary Austin has shown leadership in 
accelerating that progress. As he says, 
‘‘Our efforts to mitigate and respond to 
civilian harm . . . are a direct reflec-
tion of U.S. values.’’ 
Some of my colleagues want to pre-
vent harm because of their own per-
sonal experience in combat or wit-
nessing war zones where civilians have 
been killed, and some are motivated 
because they want to prevent terrorists 
from exploiting civilian casualties as a 
recruiting tool. 
But to do this, we need resources. I 
don’t think $5 million a year is very 
much. It is less than not just 1 percent, 
it is less than not just 0.1 percent, it is 
less than 0.01 percent of the entire 
budget to help make sure we have the 
resources to track and report and mini-
mize civilian casualties. 
I am hopeful that we can get bipar-
tisan support for this amendment. I 
recognize that this NDAA does a lot on 
minimizing civilian harm, including 
the establishment of the Center of Ex-
cellence. 
I 
thank 
again 
Chairman 
SMITH for his leadership on that. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Mr. Speak-
er, I rise in opposition to the amend-
ment. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman is recognized for 5 minutes. 
Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Mr. Speak-
er, this amendment is a misuse of funds 
and resources on behalf of the DOD. As 
my colleague from California just ref-
erenced, this bill already includes fund-
ing increases for a myriad of civilian 
harm programs. There is already $5 
million for the Center of Excellence in 
Civilian Harm Mitigation and $4 mil-
lion for the Commission on Civilian 
Harm. 
This amendment diverts critical dol-
lars needed to ensure the readiness of 
our servicemembers to fulfill unneces-
sary paperwork requirements. Worst of 
all, it creates additional bureaucrats 
throughout the DOD whose job it is to 
second-guess the judgment of our mili-
tary commanders. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge Members to op-
pose the amendment, and I reserve the 
balance of my time. 
Mr. KHANNA. Mr. Speaker, I urge 
adoption of the amendment, and I just 
point out that a lot of these require-
ments already have passed. They are in 
the 2018 NDAA. The amount of money 
we are talking about here is less than 
0.01 percent, so it will not have a nega-
tive impact on the total budget. 
Mr. Speaker, now that he is here in 
person, I thank again our chairman, 
Chairman SMITH, for all of the initia-
tives in the NDAA. 
This NDAA, more than any in my 6 
years in Congress, has tackled civilian 
casualties, and I hope that there will 
continue to be a bipartisan commit-
ment in the House to reduce them to 
the extent possible. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Mr. Speak-
er, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman 
from Pennsylvania (Mr. PERRY), my 
friend and colleague. 
Mr. PERRY. Mr. Speaker, as the gen-
tleman from California said, nobody in 
uniform wants civilian casualties. We 
work very diligently to make sure that 
there are not civilian casualties, but 
this almost assumes that we don’t, 
that we actually don’t care about civil-
ian casualties when it couldn’t be fur-
ther from the truth. 
Mr. Speaker, what this does is add 
more bureaucracy and takes the focus 
off of what servicemembers need to do 
in very difficult circumstances, when 
oftentimes the difference between life 
and death, between the servicemem-
ber’s own life and those of his or her 
troops who are following him into com-
bat, it is a moment to make a decision. 
Mr. Speaker, at that moment, when 
lives are on the line, when American 
lives are on the line, in the face of our 
enemies, in the face of terrorists, what 
the gentleman from California would 
have those servicemembers do is take 
that moment to figure out if the deci-
sion they are making is optimal or not. 
Or in the case where I watched service-
members who pulled the trigger, come 
back, and the first thing they had to do 
was go to the JAG and explain why 
they returned fire. 
Mr. Speaker, those moments cost 
American lives. That is what this 
amendment is going to do, and that is 
why I adamantly oppose it. I ask my 
colleagues to oppose it. 
Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Mr. Speak-
er, I would urge opposition to this. 
This amendment represents an unnec-
essary waste of taxpayer money and 
undermines the judgment of our mili-
tary commanders. 
I urge a ‘‘no’’ vote, and I yield back 
the balance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to House Resolution 1224, the pre-
vious 
question 
is 
ordered 
on 
the 
amendment offered by the gentleman 
from California (Mr. KHANNA). 
The question is on the amendment. 
The question was taken; and the 
Speaker pro tempore announced that 
the ayes appeared to have it. 
Mr. PERRY. Mr. Speaker, on that I 
demand the yeas and nays. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to section 3(s) of House Resolution 
8, the yeas and nays are ordered. 
Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, fur-
ther proceedings on this question are 
postponed.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H6268 
July 13, 2022 
Ms. LEE of California. Mr. Speaker, I 
have an amendment at the desk. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Clerk will designate the amendment. 
The text of the amendment is as fol-
lows: 
At the end of subtitle A of title X, insert 
the following: 
SEC. 10ll. REDUCTION IN AMOUNTS AUTHOR-
IZED TO BE APPROPRIATED FOR DE-
PARTMENT OF DEFENSE. 
(a) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of 
Congress that— 
(1) many of the most urgent threats to the 
national security of the United States are 
not military in nature; 
(2) the Federal budget should reflect the 
national priorities of the United States; and 
(3) in order to better protect the security 
of all people and address the national prior-
ities of the United States, the budget of the 
Department of Defense should be reduced 
and the associated savings should be reallo-
cated. 
(b) REDUCTION IN AMOUNTS AUTHORIZED TO 
BE APPROPRIATED FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF 
DEFENSE FOR FISCAL YEAR 2023.— 
(1) IN GENERAL.—The amount authorized to 
be appropriated for the Department of De-
fense for 2023 is— 
(A) the aggregate amount appropriated for 
the Department of Defense for fiscal year 
2022 in division C of the Consolidated Appro-
priations Act, 2022 (Public Law 117–103), re-
duced by 
(B) $100,000,000,000.— 
(2) FUNDING
FOR
CERTAIN
ACCOUNTS.—The 
amount authorized to be appropriated for 
each of the following accounts of the Depart-
ment of Defense shall be the amount author-
ized to be appropriated for such account for 
fiscal year 2022: 
(A) The Defense Health Program. 
(B) Each military personnel account. 
(C) Each account providing for pay and 
benefits for persons appointed into the civil 
service as defined in section 2101 of title 5, 
United States Code. 
(3) APPLICATION OF FUNDING CUTS.—In re-
ducing funding for Department of Defense 
programs in accordance with subsection (a), 
the Secretary of Defense shall take into con-
sideration the findings and recommendations 
contained in the Congressional Budget Office 
report entitled ‘‘Illustrative Options for Na-
tional Defense Under a Smaller Defense 
Budget’’ and dated October 2021. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to House Resolution 1224, the gen-
tlewoman from California (Ms. LEE) 
and a Member opposed each will con-
trol 5 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from California. 
Ms. LEE of California. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the 
Lee-Pocan amendment No. 13 to cut 
$100 billion from the fiscal 2023 Defense 
Authorization Act. The amendment is 
structured so that this cut would not 
reduce pay or benefits for uniformed 
and civilian personnel or their fami-
lies. 
I thank the gentleman from Wis-
consin (Mr. POCAN), my cosponsor and 
co-chair of the Defense Spending Re-
duction Caucus. I also thank Chairman 
SMITH
and Chairman MCGOVERN
for 
their support to permit us to bring this 
amendment to the floor. 
Mr. Speaker, this House again stands 
poised to pour over $800 billion into a 
defense 
establishment 
that 
is 
unauditable, unaccountable, and does 
little to answer the biggest threats to 
the safety and the welfare of our peo-
ple. 
The Pentagon is the only—mind you, 
the only—Federal department that has 
never passed an audit. And, yes, I 
worked to get a requirement that DOD 
pass an audit written into permanent 
law a couple of years ago with the help 
of my friend and colleague, Chairman 
SMITH, and also our colleague, Dr. BUR-
GESS. And yet, still, the Pentagon says 
it won’t be able to pass an audit for al-
most another decade. 
What is this about? It is really a 
shame and disgrace. It is not hard to 
find places to cut at the Pentagon. In 
fact, last year, Senator SANDERS com-
missioned a Congressional Budget Of-
fice study that detailed various sce-
narios for how we could save $100 bil-
lion per year without compromising 
American security. 
That $100 billion is sorely needed for 
other key national priorities. If we re-
invested that $100 billion, it could pay 
to hire 1 million elementary school-
teachers to relieve the current teacher 
shortage. It could pay to power every 
home in America with solar energy or 
it could provide every family in Amer-
ica with a $700 stimulus payment. 
We face an array of threats in Amer-
ica today, including the continuing 
COVID health emergency and the im-
pacts of climate crisis. It is our duty to 
look for savings at the Pentagon and 
meet the urgent needs of the American 
people. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support our amendment, and I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
b 1715 
Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Mr. Speak-
er, I rise in opposition to this amend-
ment. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman is recognized for 5 minutes. 
Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Mr. Speak-
er, this amendment would arbitrarily 
strip $100 billion out of this bill. That 
is 12 percent of total defense spending 
it would cut. This amendment would 
have catastrophic effects on training 
and readiness. It will endanger the 
safety of our servicemembers by delay-
ing critical safety upgrades on the 
ships, aircraft, combat vehicles, and fa-
cilities where they serve. 
It will set back the cleanup and envi-
ronmental remediation at PFAS and 
other contaminated sites and put off 
construction of new military housing, 
schools, and childcare facilities. It will 
further postpone critical moderniza-
tion efforts needed to deter China and 
other adversaries. The list goes on and 
on. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge Members to op-
pose the amendment, and I reserve the 
balance of my time. 
Ms. LEE of California. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from 
Wisconsin (Mr. POCAN). 
Mr. POCAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today in support of our amendment to 
reduce the Pentagon’s budget. 
First, let me thank Congresswoman 
LEE for her partnership on this issue 
and thank her for securing our Nation 
always by pursuing peace first. 
Mr. 
Speaker, 
$839.3 
billion, 
the 
amount of the defense spending author-
ized by this bill, before we include any-
thing of up to the 650 amendments this 
week, is too much with too little ac-
countability. 
We already spend more on defense 
than China, India, the United Kingdom, 
France, Germany, Russia, Saudi Ara-
bia, Japan, and South Korea combined. 
It is more than double the amount of 
funding that the EPA; Health and 
Human Services; Departments of Edu-
cation, 
Energy, 
Commerce, 
State, 
Housing and Urban Development, and 
Agriculture all receive combined. 
This bill also goes above and beyond 
what the Department of Defense asked 
for in its budget request submitted to 
Congress. Yet, the Department of De-
fense still can’t pass an audit of the 
funding it receives, a requirement of 
virtually every other agency. 
Let’s stop rewarding the building of 
amphibious vehicles that sink, unready 
projects like the F–35 that still have 
hundreds and hundreds of recognized 
deficiencies that have not been ad-
dressed, and Ford-class aircraft car-
riers that have toilets that cost $400 
thousand in chemicals to flush when 
clogged. Yes, we flush defense dollars 
down the toilet. Let’s fix this. 
At some point, spending doesn’t actu-
ally just make you safer. It is security 
theater and contractor profiteering. 
We need a more modern definition of 
defense, one that recognizes real na-
tional security threats like COVID, 
cyberattacks, and climate change. But 
the current defense budget doesn’t do 
that. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my col-
leagues to support this amendment. 
Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Mr. Speak-
er, I reserve the balance of my time. 
Ms. LEE of California. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield myself the balance of my time for 
closing. 
Mr. Speaker, it is really past time for 
Congress to start demanding that the 
Pentagon exercise some fiscal dis-
cipline that we impose against and 
across all of the Federal Government. 
Also, we individually have fiscal dis-
cipline that we must exert. We have 
budgets we have to live within. 
The Pentagon budget is running 
amok. This is taxpayers’ dollars which 
should be at least audited, and the Pen-
tagon should be held accountable. 
Again, this amendment would hold 
harmless the people who serve in the 
military or who work at the Pentagon 
and their families. The CBO has dem-
onstrated that we can trim the Pen-
tagon budget without compromising 
security. In doing so, we free up re-
sources to invest in our country and in 
our people. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support this amendment, and I yield 
back the balance of my time. 
Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Mr. Speak-
er, in closing, this amendment guts the

bill. It harms our servicemembers and 
their families. It severely weakens our 
ability to defend ourselves and our al-
lies. 
Given 
Putin’s 
atrocities 
in 
Ukraine and the increasing threats we 
face in China, Iran, North Korea, and 
other adversaries, this is the worst 
time to start slashing defense spend-
ing. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge Members to op-
pose the amendment, and I yield back 
the balance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to House Resolution 1224, the pre-

AMENDMENT NO. 14 OFFERED BY MS. LEE OF 
CALIFORNIA 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. It is now 
in order to consider amendment No. 14 
printed in part A of House Report 117– 
405. 
Ms. LEE of California. Mr. Speaker, I 
have an amendment at the desk. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Clerk will designate the amendment. 
The text of the amendment is as fol-
lows: 
Add at the end of subtitle A of title X the 
following new section: 
SEC. 1004. REDUCTION TO FUNDING AUTHORIZA-
TIONS. 
Notwithstanding the amounts set forth in 
the funding tables in division D, the amounts 
authorized to be appropriated by this Act are 
hereby reduced by a total of $36,987,247,000, to 
be derived from the amounts, and from the 
corresponding 
accounts, 
as 
specified 
by 
amendment number 2468 offered by Mr. Gold-
en during the mark-up session of the Com-
mittee on Armed Services of the House of 
Representatives on June 22, 2022. 
Strike sections 113, 615, 1030, 1031, 1075, and 
1107. 
Strike title XXIX. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to House Resolution 1224, the gen-
tlewoman from California (Ms. LEE) 
and a Member opposed each will con-
trol 5 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from California. 
Ms. LEE of California. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Mr. Speaker, our amendment, the 
Lee-Pocan No. 14, reverses egregious 
Pentagon budget increases added dur-
ing the committee markup. This is 
mind-boggling. Our amendment trims 
back the total level of the fiscal year 
2023 NDAA to no more than the amount 
requested by President Biden. 
We have numerous, glaring examples 
of waste, fraud, and abuse within our 
defense establishment. Yet, some of 
our colleagues insist on piling more 
money into the Pentagon than our 
military leaders—our President even— 
asks for, despite the DOD routinely re-
turning unspent balances to the Treas-
ury. 
Enough is enough. Americans are de-
manding that Congress rebalance our 
priorities and invest in the biggest 
challenges which we face. This $37 bil-
lion could be better spent—that is how 
much over the President requested—to 
extend the child and earned income tax 
credit, improve healthcare access, and 
pay for Medicare hearing benefits for 
seniors. 
Mr. Speaker, $37 billion could hire 
300,000 nurses to alleviate the nursing 
shortage or fund free, quality childcare 
for more than 800,000 children to help 
caregivers get back to work. 
While I personally support much 
larger cuts, we need to draw the line 
somewhere. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support this amendment, and I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Mr. Speak-
er, I rise in opposition to this amend-
ment. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman is recognized for 5 minutes. 
Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Mr. Speak-
er, I yield myself such time as I may 
consume. 
Mr. Speaker, here we have another 
amendment 
that 
would 
arbitrarily 
slash defense spending. This time it is 
$37 billion added by Mr. GOLDEN and 
Mrs. LURIA, two Democrat members of 
our committee, during our markup. 
The amendment before us now would 
eliminate a 2.4 percent pay bonus for 
enlisted personnel, people who make 
less than $45,000 a year. It would erase 
$500 million in additional housing al-
lowances to counteract skyrocketing 
rents for low-income servicemembers, 
and it would delete $750 million we 
added to reduce the price of groceries 
and other necessities at military com-
missaries. 
The proponents of this amendment 
argue that we need to spend less on de-
fense so we can spend more on pro-
grams 
to 
counteract 
homelessness, 
hunger, and poverty. But their amend-
ment would strip out a bipartisan ef-
fort to ensure our servicemembers with 
the lowest incomes don’t face those 
same difficulties. It is hypocrisy at its 
worst. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members to 
oppose this amendment, and I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Ms. LEE of California. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentleman from 
Washington (Mr. SMITH), the chairman 
of the Armed Services Committee. 
Mr. 
SMITH 
of 
Washington. 
Mr. 
Speaker, I think we need to get to a 
reasonable defense budget. Full disclo-
sure: I don’t support the effort to cut 
$100 billion from the defense budget. I 
think 
we 
have 
clearly 
articulated 
needs. But I think the President and 
the Department of Defense, when they 
put forward this budget, took that into 
account. 
One of the things I have always been 
worried about on the Armed Services 
Committee is if we just give them more 
and more money, they won’t spend it 
as well as they should. They will not 
have the fiscal discipline to go in there 
and make sure that the money is being 
spent wisely, which I have said many, 
many times is as important and, in 
many cases, more important than how 
much is spent. 
Over the course of the last 20 years, 
we have not had a good record. Many 
programs have gone over budget and 
underperformed. We are getting better, 
but I think we need to live within our 
means. 
The President put forward his budg-
et. We ought to respect that budget 
and support it. It is more than enough 
to defend the country. 
If we go back to the President’s num-
ber, it is $813 billion, which is a signifi-
cant 4 percent increase over last year’s 
budget. It is not like we aren’t spend-
ing money if we stick to the Presi-
dent’s budget. I think that number 
should work, and I think that is the 
number we should stick to. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentle-
woman for offering that amendment 
and making the arguments she has. 
Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Mr. Speak-
er, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman 
from Maine (Mr. GOLDEN). 
Mr. GOLDEN. Mr. Speaker, this 
amendment seeks to undo a bipartisan 
agreement to increase authorized fund-
ing for our military that the Armed 
Services Committee collectively con-
cluded is appropriate given the reali-
ties of today’s evolving national secu-
rity threats. 
We are faced with some serious 
threats globally, such as ongoing ter-
rorist threats; the potential for nuclear 
proliferation in the Middle East; ten-
sions in the South China Sea; Russia’s 
invasion of a democratic state in Eu-
rope; incredible technological advance-
ments that we cannot fall behind on in 
AI, 
quantum 
computing, 
and 
bio-
technology; increasing competition in 
space and cyberspace; disinformation 
campaigns; and data surveillance that 
strengthen authoritarian regimes and 
lend themselves to attacks on demo-
cratic societies. 
The amendment that I offered invests 
in our Navy, which is critically impor-
tant right now. It invests in missile de-
fense, which is very necessary, given 
advancing technologies in things like 
hypersonics, 
R&D 
for 
AI, 
bio-
technology, and quantum computing, 
as I discussed. 
Importantly, it increases critical as-
sistance to the Ukrainian military as 
it fights to defend democracy from 
Russian aggression. 
As our military seeks to prepare to 
grapple with these new, future reali-
ties, it must also do so in the face of 
significant supply chain disruptions re-

those who serve our country, particu-
larly those on the low end of the scale, 
who are having a very negative impact 
because of higher grocery costs, higher 
gas prices, and higher housing costs. I 
am particularly proud of the bonuses 
that are in this amendment to look out 
for them. 
The bottom line, this $37 billion 
amendment is bipartisan. It was and 
remains necessary for the national se-
curity of our country. I appreciate that 
some people might choose different 
sets of priorities on how best to sup-
port our military. There are, in fact, 
some 
amendments 
out 
there 
that 
would set different priorities for how 
this additional funding should be spent. 
But rolling back this defense topline 
overall, for the sake of having a debate 
about the topline, I believe points us in 
the wrong direction. That is because of 
the dangers that we face today and 
those that we know are just around the 
corner, which we really can’t afford to 
delay trying to adjust right now. 
Many people believe that we are fall-
ing behind in some of these important 
issues that I have been talking about 
like, again, the biotechnology, the 
quantum computing, missile defense, 
and other things. 
We think that this is a good com-
promise. I appreciate the ability to 
work across the aisle with my col-
leagues on the committee. 
For these reasons, Mr. Speaker, I 
urge my colleagues to vote against this 
amendment. 
Ms. LEE of California. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman 
from California (Ms. JACOBS). 
Ms. 
JACOBS 
of 
California. 
Mr. 
Speaker, I thank Ms. LEE for offering 
this incredibly important amendment. 
It is simply wild that at the same 
time that our Republican colleagues 
are complaining about runaway infla-
tion, we would increase Federal spend-
ing on things the Pentagon itself has 
said it doesn’t need. 
The initial defense budget request 
was already more than $750 billion. 
With this plus-up, it will be over $800 
billion. That is $800 billion on outdated 
and expensive legacy platforms, while 
we are still failing to meet the needs of 
our servicemembers and their families. 
San Diego, the community I am 
proud to represent, is home to the larg-
est concentration of military personnel 
in the country. Yet, even after spend-
ing hundreds of billions of dollars on 
defense in recent years, we have more 
than 39,000 members of military fami-
lies who visit the San Diego food bank 
every month. 
Even after spending over $800 billion, 
there will still be thousands of military 
families on waitlists for childcare in 
San Diego. So I reject that we need to 
continue to invest more than even the 
Pentagon is asking for on outdated sys-
tems and things we don’t need. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
vote ‘‘yes’’ on the Lee-Pocan amend-
ment. 
Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Mr. Speak-
er, I reserve the balance of my time. 
b 1730 
Ms. LEE of California. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield myself the balance of my time. 
First of all, I would hope Republicans 
would join Democrats in a bipartisan 
fashion like you did just now on this 
outrageous amendment in supporting 
the efforts to reduce the cost of living 
for people who are living on the edge, 
but I don’t see any bipartisanship there 
when it comes to supporting the Amer-
ican people and what they need in 
terms of their wages, in terms of hous-
ing, in terms of healthcare, in terms of 
all the efforts that Democrats have 
mounted over the years. It is too bad 
that you won’t join us in that, but you 
join them in raising the defense budget 
to an excessive level over what the 
military and the President requested. 
It is outrageous. 
I note that the House has voted over-
whelmingly to support Ukraine, and we 
certainly should support better pay 
and benefits for our uniformed and ci-
vilian personnel and their families, 
which the base bill does. Ukraine and 
military pay are in the base bill. If the 
President thinks that more should be 
done and more is needed, then he 
should, as has always been done, come 
to the Congress for a supplemental. 
The President came to Congress for a 
supplemental for Ukraine. If he be-
lieves more is needed, that is the prop-
er process and the proper way to do 
this, not by increasing the NDAA top 
line. 
It is time to shift our spending to 
meet America’s urgent human security 
priorities, and I urge my colleagues to 
support this amendment. I am really so 
concerned that whatever people want 
on that side of the aisle especially, and 
some on this side of the aisle, as it re-
lates to the Pentagon, people get, 
Members get, and that is not a good 
place for this country to be. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Mr. Speak-
er, I point out that this $37 billion that 
was added in a bipartisan fashion in 
the committee does not even meet all 
the unfunded requirements that were 
submitted to Congress by the Defense 
Department. 
Like all Americans, our servicemem-
bers and their families are suffering 
from the harmful effects of record in-
flation. We worked in a bipartisan 
manner to address that in this NDAA. 
This amendment would strike that lan-
guage from the bill. I don’t understand 
why anyone wants to do that and have 
that effect on our servicemembers. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge Members to op-
pose this amendment, and I yield back 
the balance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to House Resolution 1224, the pre-
vious

AMENDMENT NO. 15 OFFERED BY MS. JAYAPAL 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. It is now 
in order to consider amendment No. 15 
printed in part A of House Report 117– 
405. 
Ms. JAYAPAL. Mr. Speaker, I have 
an amendment at the desk. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Clerk will designate the amendment. 
The text of the amendment is as fol-
lows: 
Add at the end of subtitle G of title X the 
following new section: 
SEC. 10ll. REPEAL OF PROVISIONS RELATING 
TO UNFUNDED PRIORITIES. 
(a) THE ARMED FORCES
AND
THE MISSILE 
DEFENSE
AGENCY.—Chapter 9 of title 10, 
United States Code, is amended as follows: 
(1) Section 222a is repealed. 
(2) Section 222b is repealed. 
(3) In the table of sections at the beginning 
of the chapter, strike the items relating to 
sections 222a and 222b. 
(b) LABORATORY
MILITARY
CONSTRUCTION 
PROJECTS.—Section 2806 of the National De-
fense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2018 
(Public Law 115–91; 10 U.S.C. 222a note) is re-
pealed. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to House Resolution 1224, the gen-
tlewoman 
from 
Washington 
(Ms. 
JAYAPAL) and a Member opposed each 
will control 5 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from Washington. 
Ms. JAYAPAL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, my amendment would 
eliminate the statutory requirement 
for the Defense Department to provide 
Congress with an unfunded priorities 
list. This is a wish list of items that 
DOD would like to have but are not 
necessary to carry out its duties. 
This practice doesn’t meaningfully 
strengthen our national security. In-
stead, it worsens waste, fraud, and 
abuse in military spending. These wish 
lists are packed with billions of dollars 
of superfluous line items, this year to-
taling $24 billion on top of the $773 bil-
lion requested by the White House. 
Don’t just take my word for it. De-
fense Secretary Lloyd Austin said last 
year that the President’s budget re-
quest for fiscal year 2022 met DOD’s re-
quirements, yet DOD was required by 
law to submit these wish lists, which 
have not been approved by any top 
leadership at the Defense Department 
as actual priorities. 
Top DOD officials have, in fact, ex-
pressed strong skepticism about the 
practice. In a June 2021 hearing before 
the House Armed Services Committee, 
General Milley said of unfunded prior-
ities: ‘‘If they were critical, then they 
need to be higher on the priority list 
and in the base budget.’’ 
In April, Under Secretary McCord 
said that the unfunded priorities lists

‘‘should not be confused with saying 
that the budget is not adequate.’’ In 
fact, he went on to describe to me the 
problem that happens when different 
people within the Defense Department 
who are overseeing their own units 
submit something and just say it is a 
priority when overall Defense leader-
ship has not had the opportunity to 
prioritize, actually, and to even look 
into whether those things are priorities 
or not. 
Former Defense Secretary Robert 
Gates all but banned the list, strongly 
discouraging his generals from submit-
ting these lists to Congress during his 
tenure. 
Despite the skepticism of top DOD 
officials, the Pentagon is required by 
law to submit these wish lists to Con-
gress. It wasn’t always that way. 
Though the practice has been around 
for a couple of decades, unfunded pri-
ority lists weren’t statutorily required 
until 2017. 
All my amendment does to make this 
process optional again. 
The mandate only exists to serve the 
interests of defense contractors eager 
to grow their profits by selling flashy 
equipment. In 2021, the defense indus-
try spent more than $118 million lob-
bying Congress to sell their products. 
Meanwhile, we cannot even verify that 
the money we authorized to DOD is 
spent responsibly because, as my col-
league Ms. LEE
said, it has never 
passed a budget audit. 
The most recent audit found a Navy 
warehouse full of $126 million of air-
craft parts that were not listed any-
where in the records. We don’t need to 
encourage this irresponsible spending 
by requiring DOD to give us a wish list, 
but most importantly, we should actu-
ally pay attention to the priorities of 
the top leadership of the Defense De-
partment, which the unfunded prior-
ities list does not do. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
vote ‘‘yes’’ on this amendment, and I 
reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Mr. Speak-
er, I rise in strong opposition to this 
amendment. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from Alabama is recognized for 
5 minutes. 
Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Mr. Speak-
er, I yield myself such time as I may 
consume. 
This amendment would prohibit Con-
gress from receiving unfunded priority 
lists from service chiefs and combatant 
commanders. These are the individuals 
responsible for executing U.S. military 
operations around the world. 
It is critical that Congress knows 
what the service chiefs and the com-
batant commanders need to keep our 
servicemembers safe and ensure suc-
cess in their missions. 
Here are a couple of examples of FY23 
unfunded 
priorities 
from 
General 
McConville, the Army chief of staff: $67 
million to accelerate fielding of body 
armor for female soldiers; $65 million 
to acquire cold-weather boots, gloves, 
and sleeping bags for troops deployed 
to cold-weather environments. 
Neither of these critical needs were 
funded in the Biden proposal. We fund-
ed them in this bill only because they 
were included on General McConville’s 
unfunded 
priority 
list. 
We 
likely 
wouldn’t have known about them oth-
erwise. 
These are just a couple of examples 
of why this amendment is misguided. 
There are hundreds more just like it. 
I 
urge 
Members 
to 
oppose 
this 
amendment. I remind Members that 
the President proposes a budget num-
ber that the service chiefs and combat-
ant commanders have to salute and 
say, ‘‘Yes, sir’’—hopefully, one day, 
‘‘Yes, ma’am’’—‘‘That is our number, 
and we are going to make it work,’’ re-
gardless of what they need. 
We have to have that unfunded re-
quirements list so that we can know 
what they actually need, and we can 
then act because the fact is the Presi-
dent proposes budgets; we write budg-
ets. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Ms. JAYAPAL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from Cali-
fornia (Mr. GARAMENDI). 
Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Speaker, Mr. 
ROGERS well said why we should pass 
this amendment. 
We have played a bad game here. If it 
is so important, if General McConville 
thinks it is so important, why didn’t he 
fight vigorously for it in the base budg-
et? 
Yes, the President does propose, but 
that proposal is a proposal that comes 
from the Department, from all the var-
ious parts of the Department, and it is 
put together at the White House. The 
President doesn’t just dream this up 
himself. It is, in fact, the priorities of 
the Department, disciplined priorities. 
The unfunded list is a game where we 
are being played. We are the pawns in 
the game that they have. It was very 
well stated in the previous opposition 
to this amendment. 
Let’s have some discipline here. 
The unfunded priorities list is a way 
in which the Department’s various 
parts play us against each other and 
play the President. Let’s eliminate all 
of that. 
Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Mr. Speak-
er, I reserve the balance of my time. 
Ms. JAYAPAL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from Wash-
ington (Mr. SMITH), the distinguished 
chairman, and I thank him for his serv-
ice on this committee. 
Mr. 
SMITH 
of 
Washington. 
Mr. 
Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for 
offering this amendment. I think it is 
incredibly important. 
Mr. GARAMENDI
outlined it quite 
well. There was a process to go through 
at DOD to determine what the budget 
should be. Once that process is done, 
we should respect that process, not 
allow everybody in the institution to 
say, ‘‘Well, I would like to have more 
money.’’ I can assure you that there 
would be unfunded requirements in 
every single aspect of government. 
You have to make choices. That is 
what DOD does. That is what the budg-
eting process does. 
What the unfunded requirements list 
does is it simply perpetuates the no-
tion that you can never spend enough 
money. I submit that that attitude to-
ward the defense budget—that what-
ever it is, it has to be higher—has a lot 
to do with all the inefficiencies, the 
lack of an audit, the number of pro-
grams that have gone overbudget and 
have underperformed, the number of 
programs that have never worked out 
the way we envisioned them. 
If there was fiscal discipline in place, 
we would get a better result. 
Allowing people to always ask for 
more, no matter what, undermines fis-
cal discipline. I also submit it under-
mines the effectiveness of the Depart-
ment of Defense. 
Mr. Speaker, I strongly support this 
amendment. 
Ms. JAYAPAL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
back the balance of my time. 
Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Mr. Speak-
er, this amendment would rob Congress 
of critical information we need to keep 
our servicemembers safe.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to House Resolution 1224, the gen-
tleman from Washington (Mr. SMITH) 
and a Member opposed each will con-
trol 5 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from Washington. 
Mr. 
SMITH 
of 
Washington. 
Mr. 
Speaker, I yield myself 2 minutes. 
This amendment has to do with the 
retirement of nine littoral combat 
ships. 
The Department of the Navy, the De-
partment of Defense, wants to retire 
those nine ships. An amendment was 
added in our committee that does not 
allow them to retire five of those ships. 
My amendment would strip that and 
would allow the Department of the 
Navy to retire the ships they want to 
retire. 
We just heard a lengthy speech about 
the wisdom of our various service Sec-
retaries and how they know what they 
need. Well, the service Secretary and 
the Department of Defense know that 
they no longer need these nine littoral 
combat ships. We should not be block-
ing their effort to save money and re-
tire them. 
The biggest reason we have a prob-
lem with this is these ships are not 
that old. But they have also not turned 
out to perform the way they were ex-
pected. 
In particular, they were supposed to 
have antisubmarine capability, and 
they were supposed to have demining 
capability. They have neither of those. 
They have also turned out to have sig-
nificant maintenance problems and 
costs associated with simply operating 
them. 
The Navy has determined that it is 
better to invest in newer, more mod-
ern, more capable platforms, and we 
are blocking their ability to do that. 
The littoral combat ship has not lived 
up to its expectations. 
Now, let me be clear, it is an extraor-
dinarily difficult time to figure out 
how you build the right systems. But 
throwing good money after bad doesn’t 
make sense, and that is the primary ar-
gument for not allowing the Navy to do 
this. ‘‘Well, they just built them,’’ al-
most whether they work or not, ‘‘why 
would we retire them after 3 or 4 
years?’’ Because they are not working 
as expected, and they are not cost-ef-
fective. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge that we adopt 
this amendment to allow the Depart-
ment of Defense to do what they want 
to do: retire these ships and build a 
better, stronger, more capable Navy. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. WITTMAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise in 
opposition to the amendment. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from Virginia is recognized for 
5 minutes. 
Mr. WITTMAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself 11⁄2 minutes. 
I have to speak in opposition to this 
amendment. The bottom line is that 
the LCS does have capability. It has a 
mine-hunting capability. It has a fast- 
attack capability. That is a capability 
that we would give up at a time when 
we need that capability. 
If you are going to do away with that 
capability, the question is, with the 
savings that you accrue, which is about 
a half-billion dollars, what are you 
going to do with those dollars to create 
comparable capability today? The an-
swer is, you can’t do it.

It takes 6 years to build a destroyer 
to replace the capability that the LCS 
has today. And if you take that half a 
billion dollars and you put it in sav-
ings, the question is: Where would you 
spend it today? Well, we see some of 
the places where the Navy would like 
to spend it. 
They would like to spend almost a 
half a billion dollars in fixing a build-
ing in Hawaii, one of the Pacific fleet 
command buildings. They are also 
looking at—OSD would rather put $3 
billion in climate change, and for that 
matter, invest $2 billion into a $15 an 
hour minimum wage. 
I would argue that getting rid of 
ships that have a capability that does 
have an impact to counter the Chinese 
is what needs to be done today rather 
than waiting 6 years to build a ship 
that in some way, shape, or form could 
counter that—in turn, trying to spend 
these dollars to repair a building, for 
climate change, or for minimum wage 
increases. Folks, China is at our door-
step today. That is the threat that we 
face today. 
My opposition to this is about, Why 
are we giving away capability that we 
need in the face of Chinese capability 
that is at our doorstep? 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. 
SMITH 
of 
Washington. 
Mr. 
Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gen-
tleman from Maine (Mr. GOLDEN). 
Mr. GOLDEN. Mr. Speaker, in talk-
ing about one of the previous amend-
ments, I pointed out this was part of a 
bipartisan agreement to increase the 
top line by $37 billion. Compromise 
really requires people to set different 
priorities, come to the table, and find 
an agreement.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H6273 
July 13, 2022 
Many of us on the committee—on 
both sides of the aisle—really believe 
strongly, as does the Navy, that we 
need a larger, more capable fleet force. 
We have different priorities and we 
talk about them a lot. For me, I think 
we need more Flight III destroyers out 
there—the Navy agrees with me about 
that. 
Mr. GALLAGHER over here is a big 
proponent of getting new frigate ships 
out there, they are faster and have 
great capability. 
Mr. Speaker, I know Mr. WITTMAN 
works very closely with Mr. COURTNEY 
on submarines and many other things. 
He made a good point. Giving up these 
capabilities without replacing them 
with other capabilities is a problem, 
but I also agree with the chairman that 
this is not a top priority program for 
the Navy. 
I do have concerns that after just a 
short period of time they are seeking 
to shutter this program. It shows, to 
me, a problem with the Navy in some 
of their new programs. We have seen 
this with other things, like the DDG– 
1000, and I think Congress and our com-
mittee need to crack down on this and 
do a better job with oversight over the 
Navy to make sure these programs are 
going to pan out to be worthy invest-
ments. 
It is a shame to see these ships re-
tired after so few years. I know that 
there are allied nations out there that 
would like to make use of them. A Sen-
ator from Maine, from my State, talks 
about perhaps repurposing these to-
ward drug interdiction in the south-
west hemisphere. Again, we just can’t 
be scrapping these things. It is a lost 
investment and a terrible waste of tax-
payer dollars. 
That being said, I like the chairman’s 
amendment in that it is seeking to 
make other important investments 
with the money, investing in these mu-
nition plants in the United States. Put-
ting more money toward the readiness 
of our Navy force is an identified prob-
lem that we have agreed to in a bipar-
tisan way—it is very necessary. I think 
we have pretty significant workforce 
readiness problems in the Navy to man 
those ships, so it is a good repurposing 
of those funds. 
Mr. WITTMAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
a 11⁄2 minutes to the gentleman from 
Wisconsin (Mr. GALLAGHER). 
Mr. GALLAGHER. Mr. Speaker, I 
rise in opposition to the amendment. 
A few things that don’t make sense 
to me: One, on a bipartisan basis in 
committee, we included report lan-
guage in this year’s bill that tasked 
the Navy with reporting to us on how 
they can make the LCS more combat- 
capable 
in 
the 
Indo-Pacific, doing 
things 
from 
gearbox 
repairs, 
sustainment 
options, 
lethality 
up-
grades, to putting an NSM on these 
ships to make it into a very capable 
platform. 
Why would we not allow them to 
come back with that plan as opposed to 
proactively cutting Navy force struc-
ture? 
Furthermore, 
my 
colleagues 
will 
argue that the Navy doesn’t want these 
ships. Well, the Navy is cutting these 
ships as part of a divest-to-invest strat-
egy because it has to budget against a 
FYDP that is far lower than what Con-
gress is set to resource. So with a high-
er top line, the Navy can afford addi-
tional force structure. It is our job to 
exercise our constitutional oversight 
responsibility and add both the budget 
and force structure the Navy needs. 
Furthermore, the Navy’s ship build-
ing plan, such as it exists, that was 
presented to us, was a joke. The Navy 
is proposing to bottom out the size of 
the fleet to 280 ships in 2027, the worst 
possible moment when the window of 
maximum danger peaks in the Pacific. 
We should not blindly accept that plan. 
We have been playing this Lucy and 
Charlie Brown football game with the 
Navy since I came into Congress 6 
years ago. 
Mr. 
SMITH 
of 
Washington. 
Mr. 
Speaker, I am prepared to close. I un-
derstand the gentleman has the right 
to ultimately close the debate, so I will 
reserve the balance of my time, unless 
he is prepared to close. 
Mr. WITTMAN. Mr. Speaker, may I 
inquire how much time both sides have 
remaining? 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from Virginia has 2 minutes re-
maining. The gentleman from Wash-
ington has 1 minute remaining. 
Mr. WITTMAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
11⁄2
minutes to the gentleman from 
Florida (Mr. RUTHERFORD). 
Mr. RUTHERFORD. Mr. Speaker, I 
rise in opposition to this amendment. 
The Freedom-class littoral combat 
ships fill an important operational 
need in the Navy’s fleet. We have in-
vested billions in this program and de-
commissioning nine ships at the begin-
ning of their service life is complete fi-
nancial malpractice and takes away 
from important assets that can be used 
around the globe. 
This amendment would have a direct 
negative impact on our national secu-
rity. 
The Chinese Communist Party plans 
to expand their fleet, which will reach 
460 vessels by 2030. Meanwhile, in the 
same time period, the U.S. fleet will 
shrink to less than 300. 
These ships aren’t perfect, as was 
mentioned earlier; no new class of ship 
is. But scrapping these ships at less 
than half their average life cycle is 
like throwing away a dime to save a 
nickel. 
Admiral Gumbleton himself said that 
the fix for these isn’t an exorbitant 
amount of money. Why is it worth 
scrapping them entirely and throwing 
away billions of hard-earned taxpayer 
dollars? 
The push to decommission these 
ships is a multimillion-dollar misstep. 
These ships are out in the fleet and 
they are executing missions in littoral 
waters, making our country safer— 
from helping the Coast Guard with 
drug interdiction in SOUTHCOM to 
maritime 
security 
operations 
in 
CENTCOM. 
Mr. Speaker, a vote in favor of this 
amendment is a vote against national 
security, and I urge my colleagues to 
vote ‘‘no’’ on this amendment. 
Mr. 
SMITH 
of 
Washington. 
Mr. 
Speaker, I yield myself the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. Speaker, in that time I will at-
tempt to make three quick points. 
Number one, in response to Mr. GAL-
LAGHER, as he well knows, the LCS has 
literally no role in the counter China 
fight. It has no capability that will 
help us in dealing with China. So what-
ever your concern about China, LCS 
ain’t going to deal with it. It may have 
capabilities elsewhere, but it wouldn’t 
survive 2 seconds in a fight against 
China—and we all know that—which 
leads to my second point. 
The number of ships isn’t the point, 
it is the capability of our overall sys-
tems. 
This 
amendment 
takes 
the 
money out of this and puts it into more 
munitions, which we desperately need, 
and puts money into more operation 
and maintenance within the Depart-
ment of the Navy, which Congressman 
WALTZ has correctly pointed out we 
also desperately need. This money is 
put someplace that is vastly better. 
Lastly—I will come back to that first 
argument—the 
Department 
of 
the 
Navy is determined this is not where 
they should spend their money. But un-
derstand, we are hearing all these argu-
ments about China, China, 
China, 
China—this is the point—build the ca-
pabilities and build the systems that 
can deal with the fight we face with 
China. The one thing you have to un-
derstand is the LCS is 100 percent not 
it. 
Mr. Speaker, we can spend this 
money better and this amendment does 
that. I urge its support, and I yield 
back the balance of my time. 
Mr. WITTMAN. Mr. Speaker, I re-
spect the chairman, but he is wrong. 
This 
ship 
does 
have 
capability 
against China. It is capability that is 
operable today. If you get rid of this 
ship, you have nothing. The replace-
ment for this ship is 6 years out. You 
can’t fight something with nothing. 
Getting rid of this ship is the wrong 
thing to do. It has its challenges—let’s 
fix those challenges. Let’s get this ship 
operational. Let’s get it out there. We 
know that it can do the job in a variety 
of different ways. 
Even if it is not in the Indo-Pacific in 
a direct role, it can be in other ways 
that will free up ships to be in the 
Indo-Pacific to do their role. This is 
the wrong effort to retire these ships— 
all nine of these ships. 
Let’s make sure we stand by the 
agreement that we came to in the com-
mittee and go to keeping the five ships. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to House Resolution 1224, the pre-
vious

AMENDMENT NO. 18 OFFERED BY MR. FOSTER 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. It is now 
in order to consider amendment No. 18 
printed in part A of House Report 117–

Mr. FOSTER. Mr. Speaker, I have an 
amendment at the desk. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Clerk will designate the amendment. 
The text of the amendment is as fol-
lows: 
At the end of subtitle B of title XIII, add 
the following: 
SEC. 13l. REPEAL OF RESTRICTION ON FUNDING 
FOR THE PREPARATORY COMMIS-
SION FOR THE COMPREHENSIVE NU-
CLEAR-TEST-BAN TREATY ORGANI-
ZATION. 
Section 1279E of the National Defense Au-
thorization Act for Fiscal Year 2018 (22 
U.S.C. 287 note) is repealed. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to House Resolution 1224, the gen-
tleman from Illinois (Mr. FOSTER) and 
a Member opposed each will control 5 
minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from Illinois. 
Mr. FOSTER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of my 
amendment to reverse the fiscal year 
2018 NDAA provision restricting U.S. 
funds to the Comprehensive Nuclear- 
Test-Ban Treaty Organization’s Pre-
paratory Commission, also known as 
the CTBTO’s PrepCom. 
As the only physicist in Congress, I 
feel a special responsibility to speak 
out on the importance of strengthening 
our global nuclear security architec-
ture and maintaining U.S. leadership 
in this area. 
The 
Preparatory 
Commission 
is 
tasked 
with 
monitoring 
countries’ 
compliance with the comprehensive 
ban on nuclear explosive testing, in-
cluding onsite inspections. 
Before the PrepCom funding ban 
went into place, the U.S. experts regu-
larly 
provided 
training 
to 
the 
PrepCom’s international team of in-
spectors and worked with our inter-
national partners to continually refine 
the state-of-the-art methods used in 
these inspections. 
When the funding ban was enacted, it 
removed our ability to continue this 
work, which resulted in Russia, China, 
and even Iran stepping in to fill the 
gap. Their efforts may be more focused 
on dumbing down the capability of 
PrepCom’s verification regime, instead 
of strengthening it under U.S. leader-
ship. 
President Trump recognized the im-
portance of nonproliferation and of 
oversight into our adversaries’ nuclear 
testing. He worked for years at at-
tempting to negotiate the dismantle-
ment of North Korea’s nuclear testing 
and development program. Although it 
failed in the end, it was not a dumb 
thing to attempt. 
If a final deal had been reached, on-
site inspections by a trusted inter-
national team of technically com-
petent inspectors would have been a 
key factor, and that is what PrepCom 
is and what it should be under renewed 
U.S. leadership. 
As our Nation fights against the 
unprovoked 
Russian 
aggression 
in 
Ukraine, and China and Iran’s increas-
ing belligerence, repealing this funding 
ban, and getting the PrepCom out from 
under our adversaries’ control and 
back into U.S. control has never been 
more important. 
As a Nation, we must continue our 
efforts to reduce the threat of nuclear 
weapons and continue longstanding 
commitments to our allies. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge passage of this 
amendment, and I reserve the balance 
of my time. 
Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Mr. Speak-
er, I rise in opposition to this amend-
ment. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. 
CARTWRIGHT). The gentleman from Ala-
bama is recognized for 5 minutes. 
Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Mr. Speak-
er, I yield 11⁄2 minutes to the gentleman 
from Colorado (Mr. LAMBORN). 
b 1800 
Mr. LAMBORN. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the Member for yielding. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to 
this 
amendment. 
This 
amendment 
would require American taxpayers to 
provide money to an organization for a 
treaty the United States is not even a 
party to. This is completely unneces-
sary. 
It has been the bipartisan policy of 
the United States since the nineties to 
not conduct a nuclear weapons test. If 
brought into force, the CTBT would 
codify this norm already adhered to by 
the United States. However, the treaty 
was already rejected by the U.S. Sen-
ate as its adoption would undermine 
the future strength of our deterrent, 
would not halt proliferation, is not 
verifiable, and doesn’t even define the 
term ‘‘nuclear explosion.’’ So the Sen-
ate on a bipartisan basis has already 
rejected this treaty. 
This amendment does not make the 
world safer. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
vote ‘‘no’’ on this amendment to pre-
vent sending millions of American tax-
payer dollars to an international orga-
nization that has the purpose of bring-
ing into force a treaty that has already 
been rejected by the United States Sen-
ate. 
Mr. FOSTER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentleman from Ten-
nessee (Mr. COOPER). 
Mr. COOPER. Mr. Speaker, I rise in 
strong support of the Foster amend-
ment. 
Why? 
To the average Member, this may 
sound complicated, but it is all about 
nuclear testing. We need to stop North 
Korea and other nations from doing nu-
clear testing, and if they do, then we 
need a trusted international source to 
monitor exactly what they are doing. 
It does not help us in America to be 
blind, and it does not help the House of 
Representatives to blindly follow what 
the Senate does, particularly Senate 
inaction, because the other body is no-
toriously unable to conduct its work. 
The important fact that Members 
need to know is: all of the heads of our 
national labs say that we do not need 
to test. The heads of Sandia, Los Ala-
mos, Lawrence Livermore, and Oak 
Ridge certify annually. We do not need 
to test, and we need to stop other na-
tions who are trying to test. 
This amendment helps us stop those 
other nations. This amendment helps 
us stop North Korea. This amendment 
helps us stop other rogue nations and 
major powers like China and Russia 
from testing. 
Mr. Speaker, let’s support the Foster 
amendment, and let’s keep America 
strong. This is a very important prin-
ciple for us to stand up for, and I thank 
Mr. FOSTER for offering this important 
amendment. 
Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Mr. Speak-
er, I yield 11⁄2 minutes to the gentleman 
from Pennsylvania (Mr. PERRY). 
Mr. PERRY. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the ranking member for the oppor-
tunity. 
Mr. Speaker, I think what is most 
important about this is it has already 
been said that we are not signatories to 
this treaty. With all due respect to the 
gentleman regarding the House didn’t 
follow the Senate, we should do our 
own thing, I agree with that. But the 
Senate is the one that ratifies treaties, 
not the House. 
But the bigger issue is that requiring 
rogue nations who are criminal actors 
who don’t honor their commitments— 
like North Korea, like Russia, and like 
China—to not do something on a piece 
of paper is not going to stop them. 
They don’t honor anything that they 
sign anyhow, and we would be fools to 
think that they would. All this does, 
Mr. Speaker, among other things, all it 
does is tie America’s hands behind its 
back. 
Yes, we do certify currently. But we 
don’t know what the future holds, and 
we don’t know what technology is 
going to be, and we should not tie 
America’s national defense and na-
tional security behind her back for the 
sake of people and countries that 
refuse to honor the commitments that 
they sign. And we certainly shouldn’t 
encumber 
hardworking, 
tax-paying 
citizens and their money to some inter-
national organization who does not 
have the best interests of the United 
States—the sovereignty of the United 
States—in mind, some global organiza-
tion that somehow is going to tell us 
that because North Korea signed a

treaty, because Russia signed a treaty, 
and because China signed a treaty that 
they are not going to violate it. 
Mr. Speaker, when they violate it, it 
might be too late. We don’t have time 
or the luxury of hoping that they will 
do the right thing. 
We 
absolutely 
must 
reject 
this 
amendment, and I urge our colleagues 
to vote ‘‘no.’’ 
Mr. FOSTER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
I would just like for the Members on 
the other side to ask themselves: as-
sume that President Trump had suc-
ceeded at his negotiations with North 
Koreans, that would have required a 
technically competent team of inter-
national inspectors there the day after 
the agreement to make sure that there 
was not testing and other weapons-re-
lated activities. This is why you keep 
the PrepCom alive and working and 
under U.S. leadership. It makes the 
U.S. stronger, safer, and more able to 
deliver on the treaties that I think all 
of us hope may some day be passed to 
actually reduce and eventually elimi-
nate nuclear weapons. 
So until that time, we have to have a 
competent team in place. They, unfor-
tunately, have to be international if 
they are going to be trusted by all 
sides on this. That is why it is impor-
tant to keep the PrepCom as strong as 
we can, and it has to be under our lead-
ership. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Mr. Speak-
er, I yield myself such time as I may 
consume. 
Mr. Speaker, this amendment would 
repeal what has been bipartisan con-
sensus since 2018. The United States 
should not provide funding for a bloat-
ed international organization to help 
bring into force a treaty that the Sen-
ate has already rejected. In practical 
terms, this amendment would allow 
tens of millions of U.S. taxpayer dol-
lars to be spent on conferences and jun-
kets in the capitals of Europe to help 
resurrect a treaty that the U.S. Senate 
has already rejected. 
Let’s be clear: This amendment has 
nothing to do with U.S. nuclear test-
ing. Since the early 1980s, every admin-
istration, both Republican and Demo-
crat, has stated that we do not need to 
conduct underground nuclear testing. 
Nothing has changed, and this bill pro-
vides billions of dollars to ensure that 
it doesn’t. 
My suggestion to the sponsors of this 
amendment, Mr. Speaker, is if you 
really want to change the policy, then 
go run for the Senate. There you can 
attempt to resurrect the rotting corpse 
which is the comprehensive nuclear 
test ban treaty. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time.

Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Mr. Speaker, I am delighted by the 
last discussion, and I hope that what-
ever eloquence I might have would be 
useful in this regard because we are 
now debating some of the most impor-
tant and profound issues that will ever 
come before this Congress, as it has in 
the past Congresses and in the future 
Congresses, and that is the role of nu-
clear weapons in our lives. 
Mr. Speaker, we are involved in a 
new nuclear arms race, and this one is 
extremely expensive. But much more 
importantly, it is extremely dangerous 
because this arms race is designed to 
provide weapons delivery systems that 
are not observable and observation sys-
tems that are totally unreliable in a 
conflict—basically the satellite sys-
tems. 
So this amendment deals with one 
part of the triad, and that is the 
ground-based missiles, some 400 or so, 
that are in silos in the northern Mid-
west. Those are the Minuteman III mis-
siles. They are armed, they are ready, 
and the President, should there be an 
incident that would cause him to make 
a decision about launching those mis-
siles, has something less than 15 min-
utes—probably less than 12 minutes— 
to make a decision to literally end life 
on this planet as we know it. 
Those are the use-it-or-lose-it mis-
siles, the Minuteman III. 
We have the proposal underway—a 
no-bid contract worth about $125 bil-
lion over the next decade or so—to re-
place the current Minuteman III mis-
siles and, quite possibly, the nuclear 
weapons that are on those missiles. We 
don’t need to do that now. The Minute-
man III missiles are viable for the next 
decade, almost the next two decades, if 
they are maintained. 
The Air Force made a decision some 
years ago—about 7 years ago—to decide 
not to maintain them but rather to 
build a new missile system that was 
then called the GBSD ground-based se-
cure system—it is now called the Sen-
tinel—at a cost of about $125 billion in 
the next decade. 
This amendment simply pauses the 
development of that missile system, 
calls for the refurbishment and mainte-
nance of the current Minuteman III 
missiles for the next decade, and at 
that time a decision will be made by 
this Congress and future Congresses 
about what to do. It is simple. 
There has been a lot of talk in the 
last hour or two about unfunded prior-
ities or we ought to fund this and 
ought to fund that, I would suggest to 
you, Mr. Speaker, that we probably 
have somewhere in the range of $12 to 
$20 billion in the next couple of years 
and $120 billion in the next decade that 
we could easily spend on unfunded pri-
orities or funded priorities. 
So with that, I will pause, as I would 
hope that the ICBM would pause, and I 
reserve the balance of my time.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H6276 
July 13, 2022 
Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Mr. Speak-
er, I rise in opposition to this amend-
ment. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman is recognized for 5 minutes. 
Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Mr. Speak-
er, this amendment would prohibit 
funding for the W–87–1 nuclear warhead 
and attempt to life extend the Minute-
man ICBM. In practical terms, this 
amendment is a backdoor attempt to 
kill the U.S. ICBM program. 
We have heard time and again from 
the U.S. Air Force, STRATCOM, and 
GAO that the Minuteman ICBM cannot 
be life extended. The parts simply don’t 
exist, and we need this new capability. 
This would also fly in the face of the 
decision made by President Biden in 
his nuclear posture review to continue 
retiring the Minuteman III and replac-
ing it with Sentinel ICBM. This was 
the same decision President Trump and 
President Obama came to when they 
were reviewing this data. 
Adopting this amendment would also 
send a terrible signal to our allies. Al-
lies around the world rely on the pro-
tection provided by the U.S. nuclear 
umbrella which reduces the incentive 
for those nations to pursue nuclear 
programs of their own. Extending the 
nuclear guarantee underwrites the se-
curity of over 30 formal treaty allies 
including NATO, Japan, Australia, and 
South Korea. This amendment is akin 
to unilateral disarmament and would 
be a huge win for Russia and China. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge Members to op-
pose this amendment, and I reserve the 
balance of my time. 
Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Speaker, may 
I inquire as to my remaining time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from California has 11⁄2 minutes 
remaining. 
Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Mr. Speak-
er, I yield 11⁄2 minutes to the gentleman 
from Colorado (Mr. LAMBORN). 
Mr. LAMBORN. Mr. Speaker, I rise in 
strong opposition to this amendment. 
It is premised on an extremely false as-
sertion that the Minuteman ICBMs can 
be safely extended, and this is simply 
not true. 
The commander of U.S. Strategic 
Command, Admiral Richard, has said: 
‘‘Let me be very clear. You cannot ex-
tend the Minuteman III any longer.’’ 
Between 
disappearing sources for 
parts and the overall decay of the 60- 
year-old Minuteman system, there is 
no room for error and for delay in ex-
tending anymore. The engineering de-
signs for the Minuteman either don’t 
exist or are six generations behind 
technologically from where we are 
today. 
In recent reliability flight tests, the 
Minuteman III has not proven to be re-
liable. In 2021, the Air Force aborted a 
flight test before it even initiated be-
cause the missile unexpectedly turned 
itself off. In 2018, the Air Force de-
stroyed an unarmed Minuteman III in 
the middle of the flight test over the 
Pacific because of a problem; and in 
2011, the Air Force destroyed an un-
armed Minuteman III just after test 
launch due to a malfunction. Mr. 
Speaker, this is what you would expect 
from an old and extremely unreliable 
system, and it is getting worse that 
way every year. 
So I urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘no’’ 
on this amendment that would reck-
lessly bet on an old system at the ex-
pense of a modern system that we ur-
gently need for our continued deter-
rence. 
Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Mr. Speak-
er, I yield 11⁄2 minutes to the gentleman 
from Nebraska (Mr. BACON), who serves 
on the Armed Services Committee. 
b 1815 
Mr. BACON. Mr. Speaker, I stand in 
strong opposition to this amendment 
and the extreme damage it would do to 
our national security. Need I mention 
that a nuclear-armed power just in-
vaded its neighbor, a country that has 
modernized its ICBM force. Defunding 
the modernization of the land-based leg 
of our nuclear triad in this global envi-
ronment should be unthinkable. 
Here are the facts. 
First, China is our pacing threat. It 
is on track to double its nuclear stock-
pile in the next decade, matching our 
ICBM force. At that rate, it may ac-
quire the ability to strike all 400 US 
ICBM sites in one wave. 
Meanwhile, Russia is rattling its al-
ready modernized nuclear saber to co-
erce the U.S. and our allies. Defunding 
the ICBM modernization at a time like 
this sends a terrible message to our ad-
versaries and to our allies. To our al-
lies, can they trust us with the nuclear 
umbrella when we have ICBMs that are 
50 years old? 
Secondly, our military leaders have 
stated there is zero margin left to 
delay modernization of this ground- 
based leg of our triad. The Minuteman 
III was built in the 1970s and had a de-
signed lifespan of 10 years. Our airmen 
have worked miracles to sustain these 
weapons, but they have become far 
more expensive to maintain than to re-
place. The price tag for replacement is 
high, but it pales in comparison to a 
catastrophic consequence of failing in 
deterrence. 
Finally, the ground-based leg of our 
triad has never been more important. 
New technology is likely to end the 
invulnerability of our stealthy nuclear 
submarines, while advanced air de-
fenses and air-to-air missiles threaten 
our bombers’ ability to strike. 
ICBMs are always on alert. They are 
ready to strike anywhere, anytime. I 
recommend that we vote ‘‘no’’ on this 
amendment. 
Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield myself the balance of my time. 
Let’s deal with two things here. 
First, with regard to the ability of the 
Minuteman III to be serviceable for the 
next 17 years, in fact, it has to be for 
the GBSD or the Sentinel to be put in 
place. 
All the Sentinels will not arrive on 
day one. They will arrive year by year, 
Sentinel by Sentinel, over the next 17 
years. The Minuteman IIIs will be 
maintained for that period of time, so 
it is not true that they cannot be main-
tained. They, in fact, will be. 
Secondly, are we talking about deter-
rence, or are we talking about domi-
nance? Do we have to have more to 
deter, or do we have a good deterrence 
in the next decade with the Minuteman 
III, the submarines, the aircraft, and 
the bombers of many different designs? 
The fact of the matter is we have suf-
ficient deterrence. The question is, do 
we want to dominate simply with num-
bers? We don’t need to do that to deter, 
and we do have other priorities that we 
need to spend money on, much of which 
was discussed here. 
The issue for us, it seems to me, is 
should we delay, for a decade, the de-
velopment and placement of the Min-
uteman III replacement—that is, the 
Sentinel. The answer is we have other 
things to do. We have other priorities, 
and we will be quite safe enough. We 
will quite have enough deterrence. 
With regard to the 87–1, that is being 
delayed because it cannot be developed 
in the near term. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Mr. Speak-
er, I yield myself the balance of my 
time. 
I will say this for my good friend 
from California: He is persistent. I hope 
that this year he is not going to be suc-
cessful, like he hasn’t been in the past. 
This amendment guts a decade and a 
half of consensus on nuclear mod-
ernization. It would appease foreign 
dictators and undermine our alliances. 
It is opposed by the Pentagon. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge Members to vote 
‘‘no,’’ and I yield back the balance of 
my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to House Resolution 1224, the pre-
vious 
question

the 
amendment offered by the gentleman

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H6277 
July 13, 2022 
Strike section 1636. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to House Resolution 1224, the gen-
tlewoman from Michigan (Ms. TLAIB) 
and a Member opposed each will con-
trol 5 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from Michigan. 
Ms. TLAIB. Mr. Speaker, first, I 
thank Chairman SMITH as well as Chair 
MCGOVERN and their staff and team for 
working with me on this critically im-
portant amendment and for their lead-
ership, really, throughout this NDAA 
process. 
I also thank Congresswoman JACOBS 
for cosponsoring this amendment with 
us in support of, again, this really im-
portant policy change. 
With Russia’s war in Ukraine, and se-
rious tensions along NATO’s eastern 
border and in the South China Sea, to-
day’s world is being redefined, Mr. 
Speaker, by escalating tensions be-
tween major nuclear powers. 
We don’t have to look back far in his-
tory to see that there is danger here. 
The Cold War was full of near misses 
and numerous crises that could have 
gotten out of control and ended in nu-
clear war. 
We are now entering a period of dan-
gerous nuclear competition. As such, 
we must remember one of the key les-
sons the Cold War taught us: That 
when it comes to nuclear, we must pre-
serve the ability to promptly step back 
and clearly signal de-escalation when 
necessary. 
Unfortunately, the current draft of 
the NDAA includes a provision that 
prohibits our country from doing just 
that. Specifically, this dangerous pro-
vision makes it impossible for our 
country to reduce the stockpile of 
ICBMs for any reason, with no excep-
tions. 
The policy was created, Mr. Speaker, 
and implemented by lawmakers in pro-
motion of companies who profit in the 
production of these weapons, not in the 
best interests of our national security 
priorities. 
This shortsighted policy places seri-
ous and concerning restraints on the 
President, Congress, and the Depart-
ment of Defense’s ability to consider 
and modify the role of ICBMs in our 
national defense. 
Preserving our ability to reduce our 
nuclear stockpiles proved key to reduc-
ing tensions and achieving peaceful so-
lutions and planet-saving arms control 
agreements during the Cold War. Just 
as we have the ability to increase our 
nuclear defense in times of crisis, we 
must have the ability to reduce our nu-
clear forces when it is in our national 
interests. 
To be clear, this amendment does not 
change the size of our nuclear forces. It 
merely allows for reasonable consider-
ation and debate in the future. 
As a mother of two, Mr. Speaker, 
who dreams of a world where my boys 
and many of the children around the 
world can lead lives free from the 
threat of fear and nuclear war, I urge 
my colleagues to support this amend-
ment, and I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Mr. Speak-
er, I rise in strong opposition to this 
amendment. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman is recognized for 5 minutes. 
Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Mr. Speak-
er, this amendment would repeal what 
was unanimously inserted into the 
NDAA during this year’s markup. 
The underlying bill currently con-
tains a floor of 400 deployed ICBMs. 
This is the minimum STRATCOM says 
it needs to deter both Russia and 
China. That is how we got that num-
ber, by trusting our military com-
manders. 
China is building and filling ICBM 
fields at an unprecedented rate. Russia 
is deploying a new heavy Sarmat 
ICBM. Yet, we are taking time to de-
bate whether the U.S. should maintain 
at least 400 ICBMs. 
The debate is simple. If you support 
going lower than the number of ICBMs 
that STRATCOM says it needs to deter 
Russia and China, then you should sup-
port the Tlaib amendment. If you 
think that 400 is the right number, and 
you trust our military commanders in 
their assessment, then you should op-
pose the Tlaib amendment. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Ms. TLAIB. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. 
I would like to just make it very 
clear that this amendment does not 
change the size of our nuclear forces. 
This amendment gives our government 
more options to avoid a world-ending 
nuclear war. It is that simple. 
Nuclear confrontation, Mr. Speaker, 
means the destruction of everything we 
hold dear, and it risks the end of the 
world. We need more options for those 
in power now to make those decisions 
and have that flexibility. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
understand what is at stake, and I re-
mind my colleagues again that it is im-
portant to be able to give Congress, the 
President of the United States, as well 
as the Department of Defense, the abil-
ity to de-escalate when necessary. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Mr. Speak-
er, I yield 11⁄2 minutes to the gentleman 
from Colorado (Mr. LAMBORN). 
Mr. LAMBORN. Mr. Speaker, I rise in 
opposition to this amendment. 
This could allow for the reduction of 
fielded or deployed ground-based nu-
clear missiles. 
As Russia continues its invasion of 
Ukraine, and China engages in an ongo-
ing, massive nuclear buildup, this is ar-
guably the worst time to consider a 
weakening of our deterrence. 
Keeping section 1636 in the bill main-
tains our deterrence in the face of esca-
lating nuclear threats to our country, 
our allies, and our partners. 
This amendment is even out of line 
with the Biden administration’s Nu-
clear Posture Review and its emphasis 
on 
deterring 
nuclear 
attack. 
This 
would mark the beginning of a slippery 
slope toward unilaterally reducing our 
nuclear arsenal and weakening the 
state of our nuclear deterrence. 
Congress and the Biden administra-
tion alike have rejected this concept. 
When it comes to our ground-based sys-
tems in particular, our deterrence is 
enhanced because Russia and China 
must consider these responsive capa-
bilities we have as they posture their 
nuclear forces. Having our ground- 
based systems at the ready thus deters 
nuclear escalation and is stabilizing. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members to 
vote ‘‘no’’ on this amendment. 
Ms. TLAIB. Mr. Speaker, may I in-
quire how much time is remaining. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tlewoman from Michigan has 1 minute 
remaining. 
Ms. TLAIB. Mr. Speaker, I yield 45 
seconds to the gentleman from Cali-
fornia (Mr. GARAMENDI). 
Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Speaker, no-
body has really said that we need 400. 
It has never been said we need 400. 
Maybe we need 399. Maybe we need 
even less than that. 
The fact of the matter is that we 
have adequate deterrence without any 
of these particularly very dangerous 
missiles because they have to be used 
immediately upon threat. In 12 min-
utes, the President has to make a deci-
sion. 
Here is the point. We have more than 
enough deterrence. Now, if we want to 
have more than they have, that doesn’t 
increase the deterrence. That just in-
creases the cost of the number. 
Ms. TLAIB. Mr. Speaker, it is impor-
tant to understand that this amend-
ment merely allows for reasonable con-
sideration and a debate in the future in 
regard to our ICBMs. That is all we are 
asking here. 
I think it is very important, again, 
for our future in allowing that debate 
and public transparency about that 
need. 
Again, de-escalation in a time of cri-
sis is important. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Mr. Speak-
er, I yield 11⁄2 minutes to the gentleman 
from Texas (Mr. JACKSON), an out-
standing member of the Armed Serv-
ices Committee. 
Mr. JACKSON. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
Ranking Member ROGERS for the time. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to 
this amendment as it would irrespon-
sibly cripple our nuclear deterrent. 
As China, Russia, and Iran are rap-
idly advancing their military capa-
bility, the House Armed Services Com-
mittee has worked tirelessly to ensure 
that the U.S. military can compete and 
win in a future conflict. 
We included an important prohibi-
tion on the reduction of ICBMs in this 
year’s NDAA because military leader-
ship has repeatedly told us that 400 is 
the bare minimum number of deployed

ICBMs needed to deter both Russia and 
China. This number wasn’t pulled out 
of thin air; it was provided to us by 
STRATCOM. 
However, the reality is that even the 
current fleet of 400 ICBMs is not 
enough. That is why this year’s NDAA 
takes active steps to invest in mod-
ernization of our nuclear weapons, our 
skilled workforce, and the infrastruc-
ture at our facilities like Pantex in 
Amarillo. 
We need to listen to our military 
leadership and provide these strategic 
investments to modernize our triad. 
This amendment runs counter to our 
national security objectives. For these 
reasons, I urge everyone to oppose this 
far-left amendment. To unilaterally 
disarm the United States with this 
would be a travesty. 
b 1830 
Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Mr. Speak-

statutory requirement to maintain at 
least 400 ICBMs. That would com-
pletely undermine our strategic deter-
rent. I urge all Members to oppose this 
amendment.

SEC. 5905. CONFORMING AMENDMENT TO THE 
DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA HOME RULE 
ACT. 
Section 602(b) of the District of Columbia 
Home Rule Act (sec. 1–206.02(b), D.C. Official 
Code) is amended by striking ‘‘the National 
Guard of the District of Columbia,’’. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to House Resolution 1224, the gen-
tlewoman from the District of Colum-
bia (Ms. NORTON) and a Member op-
posed each will control 5 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from the District of Columbia. 
Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, this amendment would 
give the District of Columbia mayor 
control over the D.C. National Guard. 
Congresswoman CAROLYN B. MALONEY 
and Congressman ANTHONY BROWN are 
co-leads of this amendment. 
The Governors of the States and ter-
ritories control their National Guards, 
while the President controls the D.C. 
National 
Guard. 
This 
amendment 
would give the D.C. mayor the same 
control over the D.C. National Guard 
that the Governors of the States and 
territories have over their National 
Guards. 
The President would have the same 
authority to federalize the D.C. Na-
tional Guard that the President has to 
federalize the National Guards of the 
States and territories. 
The attack on the U.S. Capitol on 
January 6, 2021, and the events at La-
fayette Square on June 1, 2020, are 
prime examples of why the D.C. mayor 
should 
control 
the 
D.C. 
National 
Guard. 
During January 6, the Trump admin-
istration delayed deploying the D.C. 
National Guard to the Capitol for sev-
eral hours, likely costing lives and pro-
longing the attack. 
At Lafayette Square, the Trump ad-
ministration used the D.C. National 
Guard to forcibly remove peaceful pro-
testers for a President photo op. 
National Guards are generally de-
ployed for natural disasters and civil 
disturbances. The D.C. mayor, who 
knows D.C. better than any Federal of-
ficial, should be able to deploy the D.C. 
National Guard to protect D.C. resi-
dents. 
In the event of a large-scale attack 
on a Federal facility in D.C., the D.C. 
mayor would almost certainly deploy 
the D.C. National Guard to protect the 
facility. However, in the unlikely event 
that the D.C. mayor did not do so, the 
President would have the authority to 
federalize and deploy the D.C. National 
Guard to do so. 
This is no different from the division 
of authority today between a Governor 
and the President in the event of a 
large-scale attack on a Federal facility 
in a State or territory. 
Moreover, Presidential control over 
the D.C. National Guard creates a loop-
hole in the Posse Comitatus Act which 
limits the military’s involvement in 
civil law enforcement. 
The Department of Justice’s Office of 
Legal Counsel has opined that when 
the D.C. National Guard is operating 
for non-Federal purposes, even though 
it is an exclusively Federal entity, it 
may be used for civilian law enforce-
ment without violating Posse Com-
itatus. 
I urge my colleagues to support this 
amendment which would be a historic 
advance in D.C. self-government and 
improve public safety in the Nation’s 
Capitol. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. GALLAGHER. Mr. Speaker, I 
rise in opposition to the amendment. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from Wisconsin is recognized 
for 5 minutes. 
Mr. GALLAGHER. Mr. Speaker, I 
rise in strong opposition to this amend-
ment. The amendment would inject the 
D.C. mayor into the Title 32 chain of 
command. As a result, the President 
would be required to ask for the con-
sent of the mayor to employ the D.C. 
Guard for Federal missions. 
Not only would this set a harmful 
precedent for command and control of 
the National Guard units below the 
level of a Governor, it would create a 
series of dilemmas in the event that 
the D.C. mayor and the President dis-
agree on the deployment of the Guard. 
For example, if the mayor declined 
to give consent, the President would 
have to order members of the D.C. 
Guard to active duty, request the con-
sent of a Governor to deploy members 
of their Guard units to D.C., or deploy 
Active-Duty servicemembers to D.C. 
All of these options would come with 
their own distinct tradeoffs and poten-
tial for delay in the event of a crisis. 
Giving the D.C. mayor authority over 
the National Guard would only delay 
response time and create new areas of 
friction that we don’t need. 
It is not hard to see why members of 
the Armed Services Committee re-
jected this amendment on a bipartisan 
basis during the markup last month, so 
I urge my colleagues to join me in op-
posing this amendment, and I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, the gen-
tleman fails to understand that the de-
ployment of the D.C. National Guard 
would have to take place no matter 
who 
controls 
the 
National 
Guard, 
whether the President or the mayor. 
If the mayor controls the National 
Guard, she would have to deploy it. She 
would have to make sure the National 
Guard is ready to proceed. So the gen-
tleman’s 
objection 
would 
have 
no 
merit. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. GALLAGHER. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from 
Georgia (Mr. CLYDE). 
Mr. CLYDE. Mr. Speaker, I thank my 
colleague from Wisconsin for yielding 
time. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in very strong op-
position to amendment No. 25 which 
would place the mayor of the District 
of Columbia in charge of the D.C. Na-
tional Guard. 
I can’t believe this even has to be 
said, but the D.C. mayor is not the 
Governor of a State, and the District of 
Columbia, which houses our Federal 
Government, is not and should never 
become a State. 
Under current law, the President of 
the United States, our Nation’s com-
mander in chief, is the authority over 
the D.C. National Guard and also ap-
points its commissioned officers. 
The President has held that author-
ity for more than two centuries since 
the inception of the D.C. National 
Guard under President Thomas Jeffer-
son in 1802. 
The President has delegated the au-
thority to deploy the D.C. National 
Guard to the Secretary of Defense, who 
has further delegated that authority to 
the Secretary of the Army. These are 
Federal officials accountable to the 
President of the United States. 
Under this amendment, the D.C. 
mayor, not the President, would be in 
charge of the D.C. National Guard, in-
cluding deployments and appointing its 
commissioned officers, so the President 
would be stripped of his role entirely. 
Think about it. Taking the authority 
from the President and giving it to a 
mayor. Never. That is completely un-
acceptable. The D.C. mayor must not 
have equal authorities as Governors of 
States and territories have over their 
National 
Guards 
because 
the 
D.C. 
mayor is not a Governor, and the Dis-
trict of Columbia is a Federal district, 
not a State or a territory. 
In addition, the current mayor has 
previously attempted to use the D.C. 
National Guard for political purposes, 
calling for their withdrawal from the 
district during the summer riots of 
2020, and seeking to significantly limit 
the D.C. National Guard’s role to traf-
fic control duties only prior to the Jan-
uary 6 riot at the U.S. Capitol. This 
further demonstrates that the D.C. 
mayor should play no role in the de-
ployment of the D.C. National Guard 
troops. 
Again, the District of Columbia is a 
Federal district and is not a State, and 
the Constitution directs that it should 
never be a State. The District of Co-
lumbia is a Federal district with sub-
stantial Federal concerns and facili-
ties. 
The President of the United States 
should 
control 
the 
D.C.

Guard, not an office whose resident has 
already demonstrated a lack of judg-
ment when it comes to the use of the 
D.C. National Guard. 
Simply, the filing of this amendment 
is another example of why it is time to 
roll back home rule and return man-
agement of the city to Congress as 
stipulated by the Constitution. 
Article I, Section 8 starts with: ‘‘The 
Congress shall have power,’’ and in 
clause 17, it states, ‘‘To exercise exclu-
sive legislation in all Cases whatso-
ever, over the District . . . ‘’ That is 
our Constitution. That is what we 
abide by. I urge my colleagues to op-
pose this amendment. 
Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, I remind 
the gentleman that this House has 
twice passed the D.C. statehood bill, 
and that the bill that I have put before 
you will give the President the same 
authority to federalize the D.C. Na-
tional Guard that the President has to 
federalize the National Guards of the 
States and territories, so it would pose 
no issue for deployment of the National 
Guard. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. GALLAGHER. Mr. Speaker, a 
few comments. 
I mean, the fact that the House, in 
partisan fashion, has passed the D.C. 
statehood bill I think has no bearing 
on this because, of course, according to 
the Constitution, there is another 
Chamber that would have to weigh in 
for a bill to become a law. 
Until such a time as that becomes a 
reality, this amendment makes no 
sense and puts that very big cart before 
the horse. 
As my colleague from Georgia so elo-
quently reminded us, we should be in 
the business of adhering to the Con-
stitution, not seeking to create end- 
runs around it. 
Furthermore, the gentlewoman’s ear-
lier objection that we already have a 
process for a consultation, and, there-
fore, my objections aren’t warranted, 
ignores the basic fact that with this 
amendment, we are setting a new 
precedent. 
As the gentleman from Georgia clear-
ly laid out, we are lowering the bar 
below the level of Governor and effec-
tively giving a mayor the authorities 
that a Governor has right now. 
That is not the same consultation 
process that exists at present. That is a 
new glitch in the matrix, one that 
should be avoided right now. 
Mr. Speaker, I maintain my strong 
opposition to this amendment, and I 
yield back the balance of my time. 
Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, nothing 
more than what we saw on January 6 
educates us to why it is important for 
the mayor of the District of Columbia 
to have control of the National Guard. 
That period during which the Na-
tional Guard was held up because the 
mayor had no control accounted for 
much of the problems that we are still 
fighting that came out of January 6. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to House Resolution 1224, the pre-
vious 
question 
is 
ordered

woman from the District of Columbia

AMENDMENT NO. 29 OFFERED BY MS. SA´ NCHEZ 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. It is now 
in order to consider amendment No. 29 
printed in part A of House Report 117– 
405. 
Ms. SA´ NCHEZ. Mr. Speaker, I have 
an amendment at the desk. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Clerk will designate the amendment. 
The text of the amendment is as fol-
lows: 
At the end of subtitle J of title V, add the 
following: 
SEC. ll. REPORT ON THE SPREAD OF MALIGN 
DISINFORMATION. 
(a) REPORT.—The Secretary of Defense, in 
consultation with the Secretary of Veterans 
Affairs, shall develop a report that— 
(1) 
evaluates 
the 
spread 
of 
malign 
disinformation within the military ranks; 
(2) identifies how the Department of De-
fense and the Department of Veterans Af-
fairs are working to mitigate the spread and 
impact of malign disinformation; 
(3) identifies how the Transition Assist-
ance Program uses malign disinformation 
risk in providing resources to, and engaging 
with, veterans; and 
(4) 
evaluates 
the 
spread 
of 
malign 
disinformation among veteran communities, 
identifies the resources necessary to miti-
gate such spread of malign disinformation, 
and includes a strategy to address such 
spread of malign disinformation. 
(b) AVAILABILITY.—The Secretary of De-
fense shall— 
(1) not later than 60 days after the date of 
enactment of this section, submit the report 
developed under subsection (a) to the Com-
mittees on Armed Services and Veterans’ Af-
fairs of the House of Representatives and the 
Committees on Armed Services and Vet-
erans’ Affairs of the Senate; and 
(2) not later than 30 days after the report 
is submitted under paragraph (1), make such 
report available online. 
(c) MALIGN DISINFORMATION.—In this sec-
tion, the term ‘‘malign disinformation’’ in-
cludes any disinformation that— 
(1) aims to recruit members of the Armed 
Forces or veterans to carry out extremist ac-
tivities; 
(2) is harmful to good order and discipline; 
or 
(3) is related to extremist activities or vac-
cination. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to House Resolution 1224, the gen-
tlewoman 
from 
California 
(Ms. 
SA´ NCHEZ) and a Member opposed each 
will control 5 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from California. 
Ms. SA´ NCHEZ. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of my 
amendment which would require the 
Department of Defense and the VA 
take steps to investigate and mitigate 
the spread of disinformation within 
their ranks. 
Bad actors are taking advantage of 
new technologies to effectively manip-
ulate the public, spreading false infor-
mation faster and further than ever be-
fore. Extremists are trying to blur the 
line between fact and fiction, which un-
dermines confidence in reliable sources 
of information. The result is more po-
larization and less trust in our govern-
ment. 
This ultimately makes it easier for 
violent groups to recruit individuals, 
including 
servicemembers 
and 
vet-
erans, to their causes. 
We saw the devastating effects of 
disinformation in this very Chamber on 
January 6 of 2021. I will never forget 
sitting on the floor of my office in the 
dark, a baseball bat in my hand, hoping 
that I would live to see my son grow 
up. 
Insurrectionists, 
motivated 
by 
disinformation, stormed the heart of 
American democracy. Over 80 of those 
charged in relation to January 6 had 
some form of military service. 
America’s military is not immune to 
the rising tide of extremism, nor is it 
immune to disinformation and con-
spiracy theories. Experts have shown 
that extremist groups target active 
military and veterans for recruitment. 
We must act before it is too late. We 
must 
remain 
vigilant 
to 
the 
weaponization of disinformation that 
aims to polarize our society, create di-
vision, and damage trust in our institu-
tions. 
If left unchecked, the reckless spread 
of disinformation poses an existential 
threat to our democracy. I urge all my 
colleagues to support this amendment 
and the underlying package. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time.

Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Mr. Speak-
er, I rise in opposition to this amend-
ment. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman is recognized for 5 minutes. 
Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Mr. Speak-
er, I yield myself such time as I may 
consume. 
Mr. Speaker, this amendment offers 
vague language about how the DOD 
and VA should plan to address the 
spread of so-called disinformation in 
DOD and veteran communities. 
It defines ‘‘malign disinformation’’ to 
include anything harmful to the good 
order and discipline or related to vac-
cinations. 
Supporters of this amendment should 
think long and hard about what behav-
ior they envision being investigated 
and criminalized in this report. 
Implying that all who question or all 
who disagree with COVID vaccinations 
are 
somehow 
the 
victims 
of 
disinformation is also an absurd view

of reality. I find it insulting to our 
servicemembers and veterans. 
This body should not support any 
language that endorses mass censor-
ship campaigns based on political be-
liefs or loose concepts. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge Members to op-
pose the amendment, and I reserve the 
balance of my time. 
Ms. SA´ NCHEZ. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from Virginia 
(Mr. BEYER), my colleague on the Ways 
and Means Committee. 
Mr. BEYER. Mr. Speaker, I am proud 
to support Ms. SA´ NCHEZ’ amendment on 
malign disinformation spread within 
the Department of Defense and the VA. 
Within the military, a 2019 Military 
Times survey found that 36 percent of 
Active-Duty servicemembers have per-
sonally witnessed white nationalism or 
ideology-driven racism within recent 
months, a 12 percent year-over-year in-
crease. 
This is not about vaccinations. This 
is about extremism, and specifically 
about racism. Witnessing extremist 
views is more common among enlisted 
members than among officers, and a 
majority of minority servicemembers, 
53 percent, reported some experience 
with extremist ideology in the mili-
tary. 
We know this ideology is fomented 
through mis- and disinformation. Our 
enlisted people need to be ready to 
work as a unit with very diverse peers, 
and our military needs to able to en-
gage globally at all times. That means 
we need to have a view of the world 
based in reality, not disinformation. 
This is even more paramount when 
we know that Russia intentionally en-
gages in disinformation to sabotage 
our country and our troops. 
We can’t let our troops be suscep-
tible. I can’t think of a more important 
effort to help our troop readiness. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
vote ‘‘yes.’’ 
Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Mr. Speak-
er, I reserve the balance of my time. 
Ms. SA´ NCHEZ. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself the balance of my time to close. 
Mr. Speaker, this amendment is sim-
ple. It simply asks for a report evalu-
ating the spread of disinformation 
within the military ranks and how that 
can be mitigated. 
Respecting our troops and our vet-
erans means protecting them from ex-
ploitation and from manipulation by 
bad actors such as Russian trolls. 
Disinformation and propaganda not 
only create divisions in our society, 
they exploit vulnerabilities that al-
ready exist. This is a direct threat to 
our national security because it under-
mines trust and confidence within the 
ranks. 
We must do more to reach out to all 
members of society, especially those 
who are most vulnerable to propa-
ganda. Defending our democracy and 
bolstering our societal resilience re-
quires it. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge all my colleagues 
to support this amendment and the un-
derlying package. 
In the face of what we have seen, the 
problems that disinformation and mis-
information 
can 
cause, 
those 
who 
choose to willfully ignore it and not 
prepare for it are contributing to the 
potential violence. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Mr. Speak-
er, this amendment is Orwellian and 
insulting to servicemembers. I urge all 
Members to oppose it. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to House Resolution 1224, the gen-
tleman from Illinois (Mr. SCHNEIDER) 
and a Member opposed each will con-

The Chair recognizes the gentleman

Mr. SCHNEIDER. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Mr. Speaker, in September of 2020, 
FBI Director Christopher Wray, while 
testifying to Congress, stated that the 
greatest threat to the homeland were 
lone actors radicalized online. He went 
on to talk about domestic violent ex-
tremists, homegrown violent extrem-
ists, and racially motivated violent ex-
tremists. 
The fact of the matter is that in our 
Nation, we are seeing an increase in ex-
tremism and the threat of domestic vi-
olence extremism across the country. 
From Charlottesville to the shooting 
at the Tree of Life synagogue, we are 
seeing this increase in our commu-
nities. No community is free from it, 
and no segment of our society is im-
mune from the threat. 
In May of this year, in an unclassi-
fied presentation by the Defense Coun-
terintelligence and Security Agency ti-
tled ‘‘Insider Threat and Extremist Ac-
tivity Within the DOD,’’ they laid out 
a very clear presentation defining what 
is domestic violence extremism, laying

out the stages of development, and 
highlighting seven cases of extremism 
in Active-Duty and former military 
servicemembers. They went on to de-
scribe for commanders steps they could 
take in prevention and reporting: alert-
ness, early intervention, communica-
tion. 
My amendment would require the De-
partment of Defense, the FBI, and the 
Department of Homeland Security to 
report on extremism or threats of ex-
tremism within our military or within 
our uniformed services. Threats of neo- 
Nazi, white supremacist activity, or 
any other extremist activity that could 
be a threat not just within the services 
but including servicemembers sepa-
rated from the service or Federal law 
enforcement, whether it is due to white 
supremacist or neo-Nazi incidents. The 
amendment requires the agencies to 
develop a plan to prevent those inci-
dents in the future. 
Such behavior, such extremism is a 
threat to us in all segments of society. 
There is no reason to believe that our 
military is any different. These are ex-
ceptions. They are rare. But we must 
do everything we can to identify them 
and to thwart them before risks be-
come reality. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. BIGGS. Mr. Speaker, I rise in op-
position to the amendment. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from Arizona is recognized for 5 
minutes. 
Mr. BIGGS. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, this amendment at-
tempts to create a problem where none 
exists by requiring investigations into 
law enforcement and the armed serv-
ices for alleged rampant white su-
premacist or white nationalist sym-
pathies. 
Proponents suggest that there are in-
stances in which members of the armed 
services have shown sympathies toward 
white supremacist or white nationalist 
groups. However, as these same pro-
ponents know all too well, the various 
branches of the military have ad-
dressed the Democrat-offered examples 
of extremism. 
This amendment denigrates our men 
and women in the service. It is Orwell-
ian in nature. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. SCHNEIDER. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
This amendment in no way deni-
grates the many fine, overwhelming in 
number, vast, vast majority of fine 
people who serve in our military and 
uniformed services. 
But the fact is, we have had inci-
dents, and this is, again, from that re-
port I mentioned earlier: a mass cas-
ualty attack, a uniformed officer kill-
ing fellow soldiers, threats against reli-
gious communities, threats against 
media and government communica-
tions, and bomb-making instructions, 
material support to terrorists. 
These are not made-up examples. 
They are real examples. They are ex-
ceptional. They are exceedingly rare, 
but it is incredibly important, criti-
cally important that we identify these 
threats before they become incidents, 
before lives are lost. 
We need to make sure we are getting 
this information and taking the appro-
priate action. It is something we can 
do together. I hope we can do it in a bi-
partisan way. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. BIGGS. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, in fact, every member 
of the military who showed an interest 
or actual participation in a white su-
premacist or white nationalist group 
has 
faced 
discipline. 
The 
relevant 
branch either demoted the individual, 
discharged them, or otherwise dis-
ciplined the sympathizer. 
Further, the armed services have 
taken steps to address these concerns 
going all the way back to the 1980s. 
At a time when it is difficult to re-
cruit military and law enforcement, 
Democrats should not be maligning 
their integrity by implying they are 
overrun with white supremacists and 
neo-Nazis. In fact, we have recently 
lost tens of thousands forced out of 
military service due to the vaccine 
mandate. We are way below in our re-
cruiting levels. 
This type of malignancy, this type of 
imputation of bad conduct in a generic 
form, in a generalized form because 
that is what this amendment does, ac-
tually will make it harder to recruit. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge the defeat of this 
amendment, and I reserve the balance 
of my time. 
Mr. SCHNEIDER. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield myself the balance of my time to 
close. 
Mr. Speaker, I have the privilege of 
representing 
Naval 
Station 
Great 
Lakes. Every single recruit to the 
Navy—whether they enlist in Cali-
fornia, in the Carolinas, or even from 
overseas—comes 
to 
Naval 
Station 
Great Lakes for basic training. 
I have had the privilege of speaking 
to them at their graduation from boot 
camp. I see the exceptional character 
of all the people who go through. The 
men and women who put on the uni-
form to defend our Nation are the best 
our Nation has to offer. I am exceed-
ingly proud of them. 
The presence of even one person em-
bracing extremism, embracing racism, 
embracing hatred denigrates our entire 
military forces. Our forces represent us 
as a Nation and, again, they are the 
best we have to offer. 
This amendment doesn’t denigrate 
but celebrates our Armed Forces by 
asking our Armed Forces and uni-
formed services to report to Congress. 
It looks to us as Representatives to do 
our job in oversight, making sure they 
have the resources they need to ensure 
that everyone in our military rep-
resents the best values we have as 
Americans. 
This is not a denigration; it is a cele-
bration. It is an important amendment. 
I urge all my colleagues to support it. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
Mr. BIGGS. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self the balance of my time to close. 
Mr. Speaker, when you begin to 
study in a broad basis, very broad im-
plications take place. The urging that 
an analysis be done regarding white su-
premacist and neo-Nazi activity in our 
uniformed services and Federal law en-
forcement agencies imputes and im-
plies that it is present in a widespread 
fashion. That then denigrates those of-
fices. 
If we are going to say we think that 
they are the best that this country has 
to offer, let’s treat them like they are 
the best this country has to offer. 
When there have been problems, these 
services have addressed it. We don’t 
need 
this 
superfluous, 
denigrating 
study. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to House Resolution 1224, the pre-
vious 
question

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to House Resolution 1224, the gen-
tlewoman from New York (Miss RICE) 
and a Member opposed each will con-
trol 5 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from New York. 
Miss RICE of New York. Mr. Speaker, 
I yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of my 
amendment, which will ensure the De-
partment of Homeland Security and 
the Federal Bureau of Investigation are 
able to comply with statutory require-
ments to report to Congress on the do-
mestic terror threat. 
In response to the ongoing threat of 
domestic violent extremism, Section 
5602 of the fiscal year 2020 NDAA, 
which passed this House in 2019 and was 
signed into law by President Trump, 
mandated that the DHS and the FBI 
issue an annual report to Congress with 
a strategic intelligence assessment of 
domestic 
terrorism 
in 
the 
United 
States. 
This report is required to include in-
formation on domestic extremist inci-
dents, investigations, and prosecutions, 
as well as an assessment of how law en-
forcement intelligence, personnel, and 
resources are deployed to meet the do-
mestic terror threat. 
This is essential information for Con-
gress as we continue our work to un-
derstand and counter domestic terror 
and the threat it poses to our democ-
racy and the rule of law. 
Unfortunately, the DHS and the FBI 
have struggled to comply with this 
mandate in a timely and sufficient 
manner. The first Strategic Intel-
ligence Assessment and Data on Do-
mestic Terrorism report was 10 months 
late, and it included incomplete and in-
sufficient information that failed to 
meet the content requirements laid out 
in the law. 
A second annual report has not yet 
been released, though it is well past its 
due date. 
My amendment is very simple. It 
gives the DHS and the FBI the oppor-
tunity to report to Congress on what 
processes or resources they need to 
comply with this reporting require-
ment. If they need more resources, bet-
ter data, or anything else, we, in Con-
gress, can give it to them. But these re-
ports are too important to our work for 
us not to receive them in a timely and 
complete manner. 
I urge support for this commonsense 
amendment to ensure that we give our 
agencies the tools they need to give us 
the best intelligence and information. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. BIGGS. Mr. Speaker, I rise in op-
position to the amendment. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from Arizona is recognized. 
Mr. BIGGS. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, taking cues from Presi-
dent Biden and Attorney General Gar-
land, this amendment is just another 
attempt by Democrats to shamelessly 
politicize domestic terrorism. 
In a memorandum dated October 4, 
2021, Attorney General Garland di-
rected the FBI and all U.S. Attorneys’ 
Offices to address the ‘‘disturbing spike 
in 
harassment, 
intimidation, 
and 
threats of violence’’ at school board 
meetings. 
Although 
the 
Attorney 
General’s 
memorandum did not specifically men-
tion ‘‘domestic terrorism,’’ the Justice 
Department’s 
press 
release 
accom-
panying the memorandum noted in-
volvement of the National Security Di-
vision. 
A whistleblower alerted the Judici-
ary Committee that the FBI’s Counter-
terrorism Division has been responsible 
for implementing the Attorney Gen-
eral’s directive and that the FBI had 
created a unique ‘‘threat tag’’ to track 
investigations against parents. 
We know from other whistleblowers 
that the FBI has opened dozens of in-
vestigations into parents as a result of 
Attorney General Garland’s memo-
randum, including one into a mother 
who was merely part of a group called 
‘‘Moms for Liberty.’’ 
The 
Attorney 
General’s 
memo-
randum was the product of a letter 
from the National School Board Asso-
ciation to President Biden. That letter 
triggered 
the 
Attorney 
General’s 
memorandum which equated parents 
with domestic terrorists and urged the 
Biden administration to use Federal 
authorities, including the PATRIOT 
Act, to target parents who happen to 
show up at school boards. That is how 
loosy-goosey the term ‘‘domestic ter-
rorism’’ is. It is not defined anywhere. 
It is fluid. 
We know from publicly available in-
formation that the Biden White House 
knew the NSBA would encourage the 
use of the PATRIOT Act and never 
pushed back. Instead, President Biden 
called up the head of the NSBA and in-
vited her to the Oval Office. That is 
just one reason to oppose this amend-
ment. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Miss RICE of New York. Mr. Speaker, 
I am ready to close, and I reserve the 
balance of my time. 
Mr. BIGGS. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self the balance of my time for closing. 
The Justice Department is not alone 
in abusing domestic terrorism powers. 
On February 7, 2022, the DHS issued a 
National Terrorism Advisory Bulletin 
warning that the United States re-
mains in heightened threat and citing 
so-called ‘‘mis-, dis-, and mal-informa-
tion’’ as a source of the increased 
threat environment. 
Does that sound like they have got 
that nailed down in how it is defined? 
According to DHS, the purpose of al-
legedly misleading narratives and con-
spiracy theories is to increase societal 
friction and undermine public trust in 
governmental institutions. It cited two 
examples: ‘‘Online proliferation of false 
or misleading narratives regarding un-
substantiated 
widespread 
election 
fraud and COVID–19.’’ That used to be 
called free speech. 
Although DHS has admitted that 
‘‘conditions underlying the heightened 
threat landscape have not significantly 
changed over the last year,’’ it cited 
‘‘the proliferation of false or mis-
leading narratives, which sow discord 
or undermine public trust in U.S. Gov-
ernment institutions’’ as one factor for 
why the threat environment remains 
elevated. 
The bulletin itself is further evidence 
of how the Biden administration has 
used 
existing 
counterterrorism 
re-
sources as a tool to target and silence 
citizens who disagree with government 
actions. If you have a heterodox point 
of view from the Biden left-stream or-
thodoxy, they consider you a domestic 
terrorist. We should not be further ena-
bling these actions. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge a ‘‘no’’ vote on 
this amendment, and I yield back the 
balance of my time. 
Miss RICE of New York. Mr. Speaker, 
I urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote on my amendment, 
and I yield back the balance of my 
time.

AMENDMENT NO. 33 OFFERED BY MR. AGUILAR 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. It is now 
in order to consider amendment No. 33 
printed in part A of House Report 117– 
405. 
Mr. AGUILAR. Mr. Speaker, I have 
an amendment at the desk. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Clerk will designate the amendment. 
The text of the amendment is as fol-
lows: 
At the end of subtitle C of title V, insert 
the following: 
SEC. 5ll. IMPLEMENTATION OF CERTAIN REC-
OMMENDATIONS 
REGARDING 
SCREENING INDIVIDUALS WHO SEEK 
TO ENLIST IN THE ARMED FORCES 
AND COUNTERING EXTREMIST AC-
TIVITY IN THE DEPARTMENT OF DE-
FENSE. 
(a) ENLISTMENT SCREENING.—Not later than 
60 days after the date of the enactment of 
this Act, the Secretary of Defense shall im-
plement the seven recommendations of the 
Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel 
and Readiness on page 2 of the report titled 
‘‘Screening Individuals Who Seek to Enlist 
in the Armed Forces’’, submitted to the 
Committees on Armed Services of the Senate 
and House of Representatives on October 14, 
2020. 
(b) 
COUNTERING
EXTREMISM.—Not 
later 
than 180 days after the date of the enactment 
of this Act, the Secretary of Defense shall 
implement 
six 
recommendations 
of 
the 
Countering 
Extremist 
Activity 
Working 
Group on pages 15 through 18 on the report 
entitled ‘‘Report on Countering Extremist 
Activity Within the Department of Defense’’ 
published in December 2021. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to House Resolution 1224, the gen-
tleman from California (Mr. AGUILAR) 
and a Member opposed each will con-
trol 5 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from California. 
Mr. AGUILAR. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise to offer this 
amendment. In the fiscal year 2020 
NDAA, I first requested a study from 
the Department of Defense on how the 
Department can best screen and pre-
vent extremists from enlisting in our 
military using existing FBI and DOJ 
resources. 
The resulting report, published in Oc-
tober of 2020, found that white nation-
alists and domestic extremists target 
servicemembers as ‘‘prized recruits,’’ 
their words, for their groups, and 
shared accounts of servicemembers 
with active ties to these organizations. 
The report also included a list of 
seven recommendations on steps the 
Department can take to prevent do-
mestic extremists from enlisting in the 
military. 
Under the leadership of Secretary 
Austin, the Department has taken ad-
ditional steps to combat extremism in 
the military. This included a 60-day 
stand-down and the creation of the 
Countering Extremist Activity Work-
ing Group to better understand the 
threat and offer six additional rec-
ommendations. 
My amendment supports the Depart-
ment’s efforts to counter domestic ex-
tremism. It simply requests a formal 
update from the Department on the 
steps it has taken to complete the rec-
ommendations from the October 2020 
report, and it directs the Department 
to complete the recommendations from 
the December 2021 report within 6 
months of enactment of this bill. 
This bill does not impose new re-
quirements on the Department but en-
sures Congressional oversight of tack-
ling the critical issue for our national 
security. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support this amendment, and I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Mr. Speak-
er, I rise in opposition to the amend-
ment. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman is recognized for 5 minutes. 
Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Mr. Speak-
er, this amendment lays the ground-
work for massive new monitoring pro-
grams in the name of preventing extre-
mism. 
The amendment would implement 
verbatim the recommendations of DOD 
bureaucrats and political appointees 
who wrote the two reports. 
These reports, which are shoddy and 
devoid of actual data, recommend mas-
sive expansions of so-called vetting of 
DOD civilians and servicemembers. 
These recommendations, if imple-
mented, lay the groundwork for new 
social media and online activity moni-
toring, new screening questions about 
group and political affiliations, and so- 
called behavioral analysis. 
The amendment is so poorly drafted 
that it may require DOD to share infor-
mation about extremist activity in the 
DOD with foreign countries. It doesn’t 
prohibit the sharing of servicemember 
information or include any mention of 
privacy protections. We can’t even say 
for sure what the amendment will do. 
It asks the DOD to pick six rec-
ommendations from a list of 27 policy 
ideas. There is a reason we don’t imple-
ment departmental reports as law 
without due consideration. The options 
range from updating a PowerPoint to 
collecting 
servicemembers’ 
social 
media data to extremism databases. 
Mr. Speaker, this amendment is an 
abdication of legislative responsibility 
and will likely lead to massive civil 
liberty infringements at the DOD. I 
strongly urge its rejection, and I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. AGUILAR. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself the balance of my time for clos-
ing. 
Mr. Speaker, this bill does not im-
pose new regulations. These are exist-
ing tools that the FBI and the DOD al-
ready use. 
What this bill seeks to do—this is 
about protecting the integrity of our 
Armed Forces and making sure that 
extremists don’t become enlisted indi-
viduals. 
This is about protecting the service. 
I appreciate the ranking member’s 
comments, but this is about ensuring 
accountability. This is about ensuring 
congressional oversight, ensuring that 
we protect and prepare the individuals 
who are entrusted to serve this coun-
try. 
As a coequal branch, it is important 
for Congress to remain informed on the 
Department’s actions, and this is not a 
unique step to conduct this type of 
oversight. 
Mr. Speaker, I would urge an ‘‘aye’’ 
vote, and I yield back the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Mr. Speak-
er, I oppose the amendment, and I yield 
back the balance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to House Resolution 1224, the pre-
vious 
question

from California (Mr. AGUILAR). 
The question is on the amendment.

Mr. BIGGS. Mr. Speaker, on that I

ant to section 3(s) of House Resolution

OF CALIFORNIA 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. It is now 
in order to consider amendment No. 48 
printed in part A of House Report 117– 
405. 
Mrs. TORRES of California. Mr.

desk. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Clerk will designate the amendment.

lows: 
Add at the end of subtitle B of title XIII

Honduras are credibly investigating and 
prosecuting members of the military impli-
cated in human rights violations.’’. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to House Resolution 1224, the gen-
tlewoman 
from 
California 
(Mrs. 
TORRES) and a Member opposed each 
will control 5 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from California. 
Mrs. TORRES of California. Mr. 
Speaker, I rise today in support of my 
amendment to have transparency and 
accountability over American taxpayer 
money sent abroad. 
I am proud to be supported by Chair-
man CASTRO and Chairman SIRES of the 
House Foreign Affairs Committee, as 
well 
as 
Representatives 
ESCOBAR, 
VARGAS, 
JACOBS, 
MALINOWSKI, 
and 
LEVIN. 
Support from members on both the 
Armed Services and the Foreign Affairs 
Committees is a reminder that our na-
tional security relies on both the State 
and Defense Departments. 
This amendment provides additional 
oversight over Section 333 funding in 
the Northern Triangle region of Cen-
tral America. Section 333 gives the De-
partment of Defense authority to con-
duct or support programs providing 
training and equipment to the national 
security forces of foreign countries. 
b 1915 
Unfortunately, we have seen numer-
ous instances of abuse and misuse of 
defense equipment provided to foreign 
governments, particularly in Central 
America. 
This includes using U.S.-provided 
equipment to repress local people and 
perpetuate human rights violations. In 
some instances, U.S. materials have 
been used against our own U.S. per-
sonnel in the area. 
Let me be clear, U.S.-funded equip-
ment in the Northern Triangle region 
of Central America has been used by 
foreign government units against our 
U.S. personnel working in the region. 
Sadly, we can’t brush off these dis-
turbing instances as being far in the 
past. These problems continue to hap-
pen. 
This year, we have seen civil society 
actors, journalists, and independent 
prosecutors and judges under attack in 
both El Salvador and Guatemala. In 
just the last few months, the President 
of El Salvador declared a state of ex-
ception that bypasses citizens’ rights 
and exempts security funding from reg-
ular oversight. 
In Guatemala, we have seen a con-
certed effort to stamp out the inde-
pendent judiciary, with those who dare 
to speak truth to power threatened, 
put in jail, or forced to flee in fear of 
their lives. 
The Northern Triangle region is at a 
pivotal moment, and the United States 
must support efforts to build stable 
and prosperous communities to con-
tribute to a more stable hemisphere 
and address the real causes of migra-
tion. 
To that end, this amendment would 
require public disclosure of our section 
333 aid to the Northern Triangle region 
to create greater transparency of how 
and when we support these govern-
ments. 
This amendment, Mr. Speaker, would 
also require the Secretary of State, in 
coordination with the Secretary of De-
fense, to certify to Congress that the 
governments of Guatemala, El Sal-
vador, and Honduras are credibly inves-
tigating and prosecuting their mem-
bers of the military implicated in 
human rights violations before sending 
additional section 333 funding to those 
organizations. 
To my Republican colleagues, I want 
to clarify that this amendment does 
not end section 333 assistance. It does 
not tell the Department who it can 
partner with. It simply says the gov-
ernments need to be taking steps to in-
vestigate members of their military 
who have been credibly accused of 
human rights violations, and Congress 
needs insight into these efforts. 
The American taxpayer and the com-
munities of the Northern Triangle de-
serve dignity and accountability. Many 
here know my strategy for Guatemala, 
El Salvador, and Honduras: to hold the 
corrupt, undemocratic actors who are 
working against our interests account-
able; to help those fighting for ac-
countability, fairness, and democracy 
in the region; and to ensure that our 
assistance reaches the people it is in-
tended to help. 
This amendment will help us do just 
that, and I urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote on this 
amendment. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Mr. Speak-
er, I rise in opposition to this amend-
ment. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from Alabama is recognized for 
5 minutes. 
Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Mr. Speak-
er, this amendment makes unnecessary 
changes to section 333 security co-
operation reporting requirements and 
places needless certification on pro-
grams within the Northern Triangle. 
The additional reporting require-
ments are overly burdensome. Further-
more, 
requiring 
additional 
certifi-
cation for Northern Triangle countries 
is entirely misplaced and not some-
thing done for any other group of coun-
tries for security cooperation pro-
grams. 
It is critically important to main-
tain, not turn our backs on, partners in 
the SOUTHCOM region. Turning our 
backs on partners only creates a vacu-
um for China and Russia to create a 
greater foothold in the region. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members to 
oppose this amendment, and I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mrs. TORRES of California. Mr. 
Speaker, this certification process does 
not end section 333 funding to the 
Northern Triangle. It simply brings ac-
countability and transparency on how 
U.S. equipment is being used in the re-
gion. 
Mr. Speaker, I request a ‘‘yes’’ vote, 
and I yield back the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Mr. Speak-
er, I yield 3 minutes to the gentle-
woman from California (Mrs. KIM). 
Mrs. KIM of California. Mr. Speaker, 
this amendment would negatively im-
pact our ability to address the pro-
found security conditions in Central 
America’s Northern Triangle countries. 
As we know, El Salvador, Guatemala, 
and Honduras are leading source coun-
tries of illegal immigration to the 
United States. Under this administra-
tion, the migration crisis at the U.S. 
southern border has reached the high-
est levels in recorded history. 
U.S. Customs and Border Protection 
are overworked, underfunded, and de-
moralized. They also lack the tools and 
resources to address America’s growing 
fentanyl crisis, now the leading cause 
of death for Americans 18 through 45. 
Border agents are outmaneuvered by 
well-resourced criminal groups and 
human traffickers who exploit the se-
curity conditions in the region. 
In addition to needing effective bor-
der enforcement to address this crisis, 
we also need a comprehensive approach 
to the root causes of migration. 
This amendment would diminish the 
Department of Defense’s ability to con-
tribute to those efforts. This amend-
ment would also undermine what it 
seeks to achieve by impeding existing 
defense cooperation programs grounded 
in promoting and improving human 
rights standards. 
It is also duplicative. It is wasteful, 
as extensive vetting on recipient forces 
is already extensively conducted. 
In addition, much like the cuts in 
2018, any additional suspensions of as-
sistance to the Northern Triangle will 
worsen the security situation. 
Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Mr. Speak-
er, this amendment weakens our part-
nerships in the SOUTHCOM region and 
helps China to continue their malign 
efforts. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge rejection of this 
amendment and a ‘‘no’’ vote, and I 
yield back the balance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to House Resolution 1224, the pre-
vious 
question 
is 
ordered 
on 
the 
amendment offered by the gentle-
woman from California (Mrs. TORRES). 
The question is on the amendment.

er, on that I demand the yeas and nays.

ant to section 3(s) of House Resolution

COMMEMORATING THE LIVES OF 
THE 
VICTIMS 
OF 
THE 
MASS 
SHOOTING IN HIGHLAND PARK, 
ILLINOIS 
(Mr. SCHNEIDER asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Mr. SCHNEIDER. Madam Speaker, I 
rise with my colleagues from Illinois to 
honor the lives and bless the memory 
of the seven precious people murdered 
in a heinous act of evil on July Fourth 
in Highland Park at our Independence 
Day Parade. 
As I speak now, the residents of 
Highland Park are also gathering to 
honor the victims: Katherine Gold-
stein, Irina McCarthy, Kevin McCar-
thy, Stephen Straus, Jacki Sundheim, 
Nicolas Toledo Zaragoza, and Eduardo 
Uvaldo. 
There are no words to describe the 
heartbreak of our community, the 
grief, but also the anger. 
These beautiful people were the cen-
ter of the universe for their families 
and pillars of strength for their com-
munities. They were loving parents and

grandparents, 
husbands 
and 
wives, 
brothers and sisters. They had personal 
passions and diverse interests. And all 
loved life. Each one had a special spark 
that will still burn bright within the 
people who knew and loved them. 
In standing and honoring them, we 
also confront the fact that, as Rabbi 
Wendy Geffen poignantly said at one of 
the funerals: ‘‘We should not have to be 
here.’’ 
Yet, here we are, giving sorrowful re-
marks and moments of silence time

communities across America, we need-
lessly lose 111 lives to gun violence. No 
community is left untouched. 
Today, we unite and stand with High-
land Park as they mourn. Tomorrow, I 
pray that we can unite in this body to 
stand up and work together to bring 
this awful violence to an end. 
I ask now that my colleagues in the 
House join the Illinois delegation in a 
moment of silence in honor of the vic-
tims in Highland Park. 
Before we lift our heads, may we take 
an extra moment to reflect on the 
many more lives lost to gun violence in 
the 9 days since. May their memories 
forever be a blessing.

ANNOUNCEMENT BY THE SPEAKER

Members in the Chamber, as well as 
Members and staff throughout the Cap-
itol, to rise for a moment of silence in 
remembrance of the victims of the

Park, Illinois.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Clerk will designate the amendment. 
The text of the amendment is as fol-
lows: 
At the appropriate place in title LVIII, in-
sert the following: 
SEC. ll. GENDER ANALYSIS IN FOREIGN TRAIN-
ING PROGRAMS. 
(a) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of 
Congress that the President should encour-
age the increased participation of women in 
existing programs funded by the United 
States Government that provide training to 
foreign nationals regarding law enforcement, 
the rule of law, or professional military edu-
cation, and should expand and apply gender 
analysis to improve program design and im-
plementation. 
(b) GENDER
ANALYSIS
OF
INTERNATIONAL 
TRAINING
PROGRAMS.—The Department of 
Defense, in coordination with the Depart-
ment of State and other relevant depart-
ments, shall conduct a gender analysis of

dress issues experienced by all participants. 
(c) GENDER ANALYSIS TRAINING.—The De-
partment of Defense, in coordination with 
the Department of State, shall develop and 
include gender analysis training to be in-
cluded in the International Education and 
Training Programs at United States military 
schools and training institutions. 
(d) BRIEFING REQUIRED.—No later than two 
years after enactment of this act, the Sec-
retary of Defense, in coordination with the

H6303 
July 13, 2022 
(f) GENDER ANALYSIS DEFINED.—In this sec-
tion, the term ‘‘gender analysis’’ has the 
meaning given such term in section 3 of the 
Women’s Entrepreneurship and Economic 
Empowerment Act (22 U.S.C. 2151–2). 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to House Resolution 1224, the gen-
tlewoman from California (Ms. SPEIER) 
and a Member opposed each will con-
trol 5 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from California. 
Ms. SPEIER. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
I rise today in support of amendment 
No. 49 on the International Military 
Education 
and 
Training 
Program. 
IMET is, as we all know, a prestigious 
and competitive program that trains 
the next generation of senior leader-
ship in our allies’ militaries around the 
globe and enables us to maximize the 
competitive advantage our alliances 
and partnerships provide. 
However, as of 2019, approximately 
only 8 percent of the IMET’s partici-
pants were women. That percentage in-
crease was only 2 points since 2015. 
We can and must do better to ensure 
that we continue to provide this world- 
class training to our female military 
leaders around the world. 
This amendment would simply re-
quire a gender analysis assessment of 
the program to better understand the 
impediments to increasing the number 
of female participants and address any 
specific needs the women in the pro-
gram may have. 
By signaling the importance of in-
cluding more gender diversity in the 
program, we are encouraging our part-
ners and allied militaries to invest 
more heavily in the recruitment, train-
ing, and promotion of women within 
their security forces. 
We do know that this is not just im-
portant; it is smart. We know that our 
world is more peaceful and prosperous 
when women are involved in national 
security and defense decisionmaking 
processes. 
I also want to point out that this will 
continue the work that was begun 
under former President Trump when he 
signed the Women, Peace, and Security 
Act during his administration. It re-
ceived bipartisan support then. It is 
also supported by President Biden. 
It will also improve military effec-
tiveness of our security partners and, 
thereby, advance implementation of 
the National Defense Strategy. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. GALLAGHER. Madam Speaker, I 
rise in opposition to the amendment. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from Wisconsin is recognized 
for 5 minutes. 
Mr. GALLAGHER. Madam Speaker, 
first, let me say at the outset that I 
very much appreciate the way the 
chairwoman and I have been able to 
work together on the issue of military 
education in general. But I have to op-
pose this amendment. 
International Military Education and 
Training, or IMET, is a vital pillar of 
our national security. In recent years, 
Ukrainian servicemembers have bene-
fited from IMET to enhance their com-
bat readiness and lethality. 
As we have seen in the aftermath of 
Putin’s invasion of Ukraine, security 
partnerships like IMET can help make 
the difference between life and death 
and the ability of our allies and part-
ners to withstand foreign aggression. 
Since 2014, in fact, the U.S. military 
has played a key role in boosting 
Ukrainian military capabilities, train-
ing alongside them, providing Ukraine 
with critical weapons and munitions, 
enabling its reserve component, and 
more. Our security focus, however, was 
laser-focused on enhancing Ukraine’s 
ability to defend itself against the Rus-
sian invasion. 
My concern is that the amendment 
would broaden the scope of IMET and 
end up watering down the results for 
both the United States and for our se-
curity 
partners. 
Promoting 
human 
rights, including the rights of women, 
is a well-established goal of U.S. for-
eign and development policy. I don’t 
deny that. Instruction on gender roles, 
female 
opportunity, 
and 
narrowing 
gaps between men and women should, 
however, not be a part of the U.S. mili-
tary’s mandate when it comes to teach-
ing allied and partner nations the art 
of war. 
As I said earlier tonight, all of our 
instruction for warfighting needs to be 
focused on the actual fighting of wars, 
which will, in turn, allow us to deter 
wars. 
This is not to discount the impor-
tance of other issues, but the military 
is simply not the right tool for advanc-
ing this objective. As former Obama 
administration official Rosa Brooks 
notes in her book, ‘‘How Everything 
Became War and the Military Became 
Everything,’’ the military has in re-
cent years taken on missions that de-
part from its core responsibility of 
fighting and winning the Nation’s 
wars. 
My concern is this amendment would 
exacerbate this trend, so, therefore, I 
oppose this amendment. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Ms. SPEIER. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself the balance of my time. 
Madam Speaker, I, too, share a posi-
tion of working well with my colleague 
as the ranking member of the Military 
Personnel Subcommittee. I just feel 
that he is not appreciating, with all 
due respect, what this amendment 
does. 
We already say that women, peace, 
and security should be part of it. That 
was something that was signed by 
President Trump, and it was bipartisan 
then. It is something that has also 
been embraced by President Biden. 
This is only looking at the fact that 
very few women in the military of our 
allies have been participating in this 
program. This program exists to pro-
vide military education and training to 
our allies, and we are talking about 
only 6 to 8 percent of them being 
women who are participating. 
This is an analysis. That is all this 
amendment does is analyze whether or 
not we have promoted this properly to 
encourage our allies to have service-
women in their countries participate. 
We do know that when you have 
women in the military, it adds to our 
success. It does not degrade it. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. GALLAGHER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself the balance of my time. 
I certainly don’t deny the fact that 
having women in the military is a huge 
asset, as the gentlewoman said. I have 
served in the Marine Corps with women 
I greatly admire, to whom I am greatly 
indebted. 
I just think we have to strike the 
right balance here between widening 
the aperture for our military edu-
cation, our training programs, such 
that they get distracted from the core 
focus on warfighting, as well as foist-
ing some of our own requirements and 
the higher standards that the United 
States sets on some of our allied part-
ners. 
I appreciate the gentlewoman’s argu-
ment, but I remain in firm opposition 
to this amendment, and I urge my col-
leagues to join me in opposing the 
amendment. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to House Resolution 1224, the pre-
vious 
question 
is 
ordered 
on 
the 
amendment offered by the gentle-
woman from California (Ms. SPEIER). 
The question is on the amendment. 
The question was taken; and the 
Speaker pro tempore announced that 
the ayes appeared to have it. 
Mr. PERRY. Madam Speaker, on that 
I demand the yeas and nays. The 
SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to 
section 3(s) of House Resolution 8, the 
yeas and nays are ordered. 
Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, fur-
ther proceedings on this question are 
postponed. The Chair understands that 
amendment Nos. 53 and 65 will not be 
offered.

the progress of the Department of Defense in 
implementing 
on-site 
PFAS 
destruction 
technologies not requiring incineration. The 
report shall include the following: 
(1) A list of technologies that modify the 
characteristics of the waste such that it is 
no longer classified as hazardous waste and 
can be disposed of through more cost-effec-
tive mixed waste protocols. 
(2) An identification of any such tech-
nologies that have undergone, are under-

ing. 
(3) The results of any such testing. 
(b) GUIDANCE.—Not later than one year 
after the date of the enactment of this Act, 
the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisi-
tion and Sustainment shall prescribe guid-
ance on best practices and preferred methods 
for destruction and disposal of PFAS wastes 
with an emphasis on alternatives to inciner-
ation. 
(c) EXTENSION OF MORATORIUM.—The Sec-
retary of Defense shall prohibit the inciner-
ation of covered materials under section 343 
of the National Defense Authorization Act 
for Fiscal Year 2022 (10 U.S.C. 2701 note) until 
the date on which the Secretary prescribes 
the guidance required under subsection (b). 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to House Resolution 1224, the gen-
tleman from Michigan (Mr. LEVIN) and 
a Member opposed each will control 5 
minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from Michigan. 
Mr. LEVIN of Michigan. Madam 
Speaker, I would like to begin by 
thanking Chair ADAM SMITH for his 
leadership on H.R. 7900, the National 
Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal 
Year 2023, and for working with my 
team over the past few years to 
strengthen provisions to address toxic 
PFAS exposures at the Department of 
Defense. 
I thank Representatives Slotkin and 
Khanna for working with me on this as 
well. 
b 2250 
Mr. LEVIN of Michigan. For more 
than 50 years, the military required the 
use of firefighting foam made with dan-
gerous PFAS chemicals known as aque-
ous film-forming foam or AFFF, de-
spite having known since the 1970s that 
it was toxic to people and the environ-
ment. 
The Department of Defense has his-
torically disposed of or destroyed these 
chemicals 
through 
incineration 
or 
burning. However, PFAS does not 
break down under typical incineration 
conditions. 
Research shows that PFAS emitted 
through air stacks can travel several 
miles downwind from facilities emit-
ting PFAS, like incinerators. That 
PFAS then deposits in soil and in 
drinking water supplies in downwind 
communities, 
exposing 
unsuspecting 
Americans to these dangerous chemi-
cals. 
Research also shows that in practice, 
incinerators are likely not destroying 
PFAS completely, but rather, emitting 
PFAS and other toxic chemical byprod-
ucts in our air, drinking water, and 
other local surroundings. 
Madam Speaker, that is why PFAS 
substances have often been called ‘‘for-
ever chemicals.’’ 
Why are we disposing of PFAS 
through incineration without evidence 
that the chemical is, in fact, being de-
stroyed and not causing further harm 
to our communities? 
That is why my amendment is crit-
ical. It builds on a provision enacted 
under last year’s NDAA, which placed a 
prohibition on the incineration of 
PFAS by the Department of Defense 
until the Environmental Protection 
Agency completed guidance or a final 
rule on the safe disposal of PFAS. 
This amendment simply extends the 
prohibition and requires the Pentagon 
to submit a report to Congress on the 
progress of its implementation of other 
safe disposal methods such as onsite 
PFAS destruction technologies not re-
quiring incineration. 
There is no doubt that we need to dis-
pose of dangerous PFAS chemicals, but 
we cannot pursue disposal methods 
that cause more harm. This amend-
ment protects our communities and 
our environment and ensures we are 
pursuing disposal methods that are 
safe. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to join me in protecting our 
communities and our planet from dan-
gerous PFAS exposure by supporting 
this amendment, and I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Madam 
Speaker, I rise in opposition to the 
amendment. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman is recognized for 5 minutes. 
Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Madam 
Speaker, the report required in this 
amendment is well intentioned, but the 
preference against incineration chooses 
sides on destruction technology. 
We want to make sure the DOD de-
stroys PFAS material using whatever 
technology performs the best and con-
forms to the technical standards used 
throughout the Federal Government. 
There is a current moratorium on in-
cineration of PFAS material until 
guidance on destruction and disposal is 
published by the administrator of the 
EPA. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to oppose this amendment, and 
I reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. LEVIN of Michigan. Madam 
Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gen-
tleman from New York (Mr. TONKO), 
my distinguished colleague. 
Mr. TONKO. Madam Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman for offering this com-
monsense amendment. The reality is, 
we have a lot of waste containing 
PFAS spread out all across the coun-
try. We need a plan to make certain 
that it is handled and disposed of safe-
ly. 
In the past, I have strongly opposed 
efforts—including efforts in my dis-
trict—to incinerate these materials 
without 
any 
proper 
evaluation 
of 
whether it was—or even could be—done 
safely. 
This amendment is the right ap-
proach. It requires DOD to study and 
report on the technological options to 
destroy PFAS before we commit to in-
cinerating it in a manner that could 
put public health and the environment 
at risk. 
There needs to be much greater 
transparency on what DOD has done to 
date and how DOD is planning to deal 
with PFAS waste in the future, and I 
believe Congress has a responsibility to 
ensure that the methods used are pro-
tective of public health. 
Madam Speaker, I urge Members to 
support this amendment. 
Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Madam 
Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gen-
tleman from Ohio (Mr. JOHNSON). 
Mr. 
JOHNSON 
of 
Ohio. 
Madam 
Speaker, I thank the gentleman for 
yielding time. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in opposition 
and urge my colleagues to oppose the 
Levin amendment. What most concerns 
me about this amendment is subsection 
(c), which extends last year’s inciner-
ation moratorium on all PFAS in fire-
fighting foam and does not fix the un-
derlying drafting problems from that 
enactment. 
Specifically, the scoping provisions 
in section 343 do not limit the morato-
rium only to the Department of De-
fense but captures ‘‘materials sent to 
another entity or entities.’’ 
In doing so, this ban continues to 
present ambiguity about who is subject 
to the incineration moratorium, poten-
tially extending the temporary ban 
from just the military to any entity or 
person. 
Moreover, 
this 
amendment 
con-
travenes the Federal law governing 
these matters: The Resource Conserva-
tion and Recovery Act. Practically 
speaking, if the executive or judicial 
branches of our government adopt this 
interpretation, it would have profound 
policy implications on waste, storage, 
and disposal practices in our country. 
Of greatest concern, a policy like this 
has the real potential to overwhelming 
existing landfill capacity and leave few 
viable disposal options for Americans. 
Again, I urge my colleagues to op-
pose the Levin amendment. 
Mr. LEVIN of Michigan. Madam 
Speaker, I want to be clear: This is not 
a permanent ban on the incineration of 
PFAS. It is a moratorium until guide-
lines for safe disposal can be produced. 
Unfortunately, Congress was forced 
to place a moratorium on incinerating 
PFAS because DOD flagrantly ignored 
the directives requiring DOD to satisfy 
certain 
requirements 
before 
incin-
erating PFAS to ensure it did not 
cause further harm. 
EPA’s scientists reviewed non-incin-
eration technologies; namely, three 
commercial systems using supercrit-
ical water oxidation, and found a high 
level of AFFF destruction, well over 
99.99 percent. EPA has suggested these 
technologies could replace incineration 
for AFFF. 
We know there are better tech-
nologies; we are simply extending this

AMENDMENT NO. 81 OFFERED BY MS. SPEIER 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. It is now 
in order to consider amendment No. 81 
printed in part A of House Report 117– 
405. 
Ms. SPEIER. Madam Speaker, I have 
an amendment at the desk. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Clerk will designate the amendment. 
The text of the amendment is as fol-
lows: 
At the end of subtitle J of title V, insert 
the following: 
SEC. 5ll. PILOT PROGRAM ON SAFE STORAGE 
OF PERSONALLY OWNED FIREARMS. 
(a) ESTABLISHMENT.—The Secretary of De-
fense shall establish a voluntary pilot pro-
gram to promote the safe storage of person-
ally owned firearms. 
(b) ELEMENTS.—Under the pilot program 
under subsection (a), the Secretary of De-
fense shall furnish to members of the Armed 
Forces described in subsection (c) secure gun 
storage or safety devices for the purpose of 
securing personally owned firearms when not 
in use (including by directly providing, sub-
sidizing, or otherwise making available such 
devices). 
(c) VOLUNTARY PARTICIPANTS.—A member 
of the Armed Forces described in this sub-
section is a member of the Armed Forces 
who elects to participate in the pilot pro-
gram under subsection (a) and is stationed at 
a military installation selected under sub-
section (e). 
(d) PLAN.—Not later than one year after 
the date of enactment of this Act, the Sec-
retary of Defense shall submit to the con-
gressional defense committees a plan for the 
implementation of the pilot program under 
subsection (a). 
(e) SELECTION OF INSTALLATIONS.—Not later 
than two years after the date of the enact-
ment of this Act, the Secretary of Defense 
shall select not fewer than five military in-
stallations at which to carry out the pilot 
program under subsection (a). 
(f) DURATION.—The duration of the pilot 
program under subsection (a) shall be for a

storage or safety devices furnished to mem-
bers of the Armed Forces under such pilot 
program. 
(2) The cost of such pilot program. 
(3) An analysis of the effect of such pilot 
program on suicide prevention. 
(4) Such other information as the Sec-
retary may determine appropriate, except 
that such information may not include the 
personally identifiable information of a par-
ticipant in such pilot program. 
(h) SECURE GUN STORAGE OR SAFETY DEVICE 
DEFINED.—In this subsection, the term ‘‘se-
cure gun storage or safety device’’ means— 
(1) a device that, when installed on a fire-
arm, is designed to prevent the firearm from 
being operated without first deactivating the 
device; 
(2) a device incorporated into the design of 
the firearm that is designed to prevent the 
operation of the firearm by any individual 
without access to the device; or 
(3) a safe, gun safe, gun case, lock box, or 
other device that may be used to store a fire-
arm and is designed to be unlocked only by 
a key, combination, or other similar means. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to House Resolution 1224, the gen-
tlewoman from California (Ms. SPEIER) 
and a Member opposed each will con-
trol 5 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from California. 
Ms. SPEIER. Madam Speaker, I say 
to my colleagues, this is a really im-
portant amendment. This deals with 
suicide and securing guns. 
This program will be a pilot. It will 
be at five installations. It will be vol-
untary. It is bipartisan and bicameral. 
Senator DAN SULLIVAN is my co-lead 
on the Senate side. It is already in the 
Senate NDAA. The NRA is satisfied 
with this amendment. 
So what does it do? 
This year, my subcommittee has 
spent over 100 hours on the issue of sui-
cide in the military. I have personally 
spoken to parents and spouses of serv-
icemembers who have died by suicide. 
b 2300 
We have seen an extraordinary in-
crease in suicide in our Active-Duty 
servicemembers, some 40 percent in-
crease in the past 5 years, and we have 
hot spots in areas like Alaska and on 
the USS George Washington, where 
most recently seven sailors have died 
by suicide. In Alaska we have seen the 
suicide rate double in 2021. 
Since then, I have traveled to Alaska 
with Senator SULLIVAN to visit soldiers 
in Anchorage and Fairbanks. We have 
heard from junior enlisted soldiers who 
feel isolated, stressed out, and discon-
nected, who must wait 2 to 3 months to 
see a behavioral health provider. The 
providers are overwhelmed by demand 
from suicidal servicemembers. It is a 
challenging problem. 
Earlier in March, the subcommittee 
had a hearing, and one of the experts 
said that one of the best things we can 
do is deal with the issue that many 
persons who are contemplating suicide 
are making that decision impulsively. 
A few seconds makes a difference. 
The experts are saying to us, if we 
have a simple process by which, volun-
tarily, servicemembers can request a 
gun safe or a firearm lock and have it 
paid for, that will save lives because 
ideations can come and go so quickly. 
We must create a new norm, not 
through mandates, but by encourage-
ment. This amendment would create a 
voluntary pilot program at five instal-
lations, as I already mentioned. Safe 
storage has bipartisan support from 
both Presidents Trump and Biden, and 
I would really request a resounding bi-
partisan vote for this amendment. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Madam 
Speaker, I rise in opposition to the 
amendment. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman is recognized for 5 minutes. 
Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Madam 
Speaker, this amendment requires the 
Department of Defense to establish a 
voluntary pilot program to provide se-
cure gun storage or safety devices for 
personally owned firearms. I don’t 
think it is the DOD’s responsibility. 
This should be the responsibility of the 
servicemember who owns the firearm. 
Most firearm manufacturers provide 
gun locks with the sale of a firearm. 
They also are readily available at very 
low cost at many sporting goods stores 
around the country. 
Madam Speaker, I urge all Members 
to oppose the amendment, and I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Ms. SPEIER. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Madam Speaker, I have great admi-
ration for the ranking member of the 
committee. A lot of things aren’t 
DOD’s responsibility, except for the 
fact that servicemembers are their re-
sponsibility, and we have an obligation 
to address this extraordinary rate of 
suicide in the military. 
This is one modest step, as a pilot 
program, to determine whether or not 
it is effective. We have experts telling 
us it is, and we have a crisis of service-
members who are taking their lives. 
There does not appear to be rhyme or 
reason to it but for the fact that they 
have suicidal ideations or because they 
can’t see behavioral health experts, 
which we are trying to address through 
other elements of the NDAA. I feel 
very strongly that this is really a key. 
Again, it is bipartisan, it is bi-
cameral, and the NRA is fine with the 
amendment. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Madam 
Speaker, I continue to reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Ms. SPEIER. Madam Speaker, I 
think I have said enough, and I will 
close. I ask for a ‘‘yes’’ vote. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Madam 
Speaker, I still oppose the amendment. 
I urge a ‘‘no’’ vote, and I yield back the 
balance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to House Resolution 1224, the pre-
vious 
question 
is 
ordered 
on 
the 
amendment offered by the gentle-
woman from California (Ms. SPEIER).

tinued military aggression by the Govern-

may be necessary to track the expected use-
ful life of uniform items for officers and en-
listed members of the Armed Forces, for the 
purposes of— 
(1) estimating the rate at which such uni-
form items are replaced; and 
(2) determining the resulting out-of-pocket 
costs for such members over time. 
(b) UNIFORM REPLACEMENT ALLOWANCE FOR 
CERTAIN OFFICERS.— 
(1) ESTABLISHMENT.—The Secretary of De-
fense shall establish a uniform replacement 
allowance under which each officer of the 
Armed Forces, upon promotion to the grade 
of O–4, and once every three years thereafter 
for such time as the officer is in a grade of 
O–4 or above, shall be eligible to receive the 
allowance described in paragraph (2) for the 
purpose of replacing required uniform items 
that have exceeded the useful life of such 
items. 
(2) ALLOWANCE.—The allowance described 
in this paragraph is a cash allowance that 
the Secretary shall calculate by multiplying 
the annual replacement cost of each required 
uniform item of an officer (taking into ac-
count the expected useful life of the item 
pursuant to subsection (a) and the price of 
the item set by the Defense Logistics Agency 
as of the date of the calculation) by three. 
(c) REPORT.—Not later than 120 days after 
the date of the enactment of this Act, the 
Secretary of Defense shall submit to the con-

the expected useful life of required uniform

(e) REPORT
ON
LESSONS
LEARNED
FROM 
WAR.—Not later than 1 year after the date of 
the enactment of this Act, the Secretary of 
Defense, in coordination with the Secretary 
of each military department, shall submit to 
the appropriate congressional committees an 
assessment of lessons learned by the respec-
tive military departments from the conflict 
following the Russian invasion of Ukraine 
that includes the following: 
(1) Lessons learned from intelligence-shar-
ing activities conducted between the United 
States, NATO, the European Union, and 
Ukraine throughout the conflict. 
(2) Observed tactics and techniques of in-
formation-related capabilities and the inte-
gration of information-related capabilities in 
supporting Ukraine objectives. 
(3) Analysis of the capabilities, tactics, and 
techniques implemented throughout the con-
flict following the Russian invasion of 
Ukraine, from each military department, 
with a focus on the Army, Navy, and Air 
Force. 
(4) Analysis of all collected information to 
identify recurring strengths and weaknesses 
in United States and NATO tactics, training, 
and equipment. 
(5) Recommendations to address any cor-
rective actions. 
(f) FORM; PUBLICATION.—The report re-
quired by subsection (e) shall be submitted 
in unclassified form but may include a clas-
sified annex. The unclassified portion of such 
report shall be published on a publicly acces-
sible website of the Department of Defense. 
(g) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of 
Congress that— 
(1) the United States could greatly benefit 
from on-the-ground combat observations of 
the conflict following the Russian invasion 
of Ukraine to learn lessons about modern 
warfare between near-peer adversaries, and 
successful and unsuccessful aspects of both 
sides’ tactics, operations, and strategy; 
(2) expert projections of how this conflict 
was likely to unfold were inaccurate, sug-
gesting the United States has many lessons 
to learn from this conflict; 
(3) the Department of Defense should, when 
feasible, 
organize 
Combat 
Observation 
Teams, who should be given battlefield ac-
cess as non-combatants, with specialized 
skill sets to collect information, including 
by conducting first-person interviews, or 
other conflict-specific assessments and ob-
servations; 
(4) such collection and observations should 
occur after the conflict has largely subsided, 
and the physical, political, and escalatory 
risk of sending an American combat observer 
team is sufficiently low; 
(5) such teams should consist of talented 
senior officers and non-commissioned offi-
cers with appropriate experience and special-
ties for their task; 
(6) Combat Observation Teams should be 
encouraged to interview Ukrainian military 
members, and civilians, conduct site surveys, 
and work with the United States embassy 
and other allied countries as appropriate; 
and 
(7) the time is ripe for an infusion of les-
sons from Ukraine, and observations could 
ensure the United States is prepared for the 
future of modern warfare and conflict.

Mr. SMITH of Washington (during 
the reading). Madam Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that the reading of 
the modification be dispensed with. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Washington? 
There was no objection. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the original request of the 
gentleman from Washington? 
There was no objection. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
amendments en bloc No. 2 is modified. 
There was no objection. 
Mr. SMITH of Washington. Madam 
Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gen-
tleman from California (Mr. KHANNA), a 
member of the committee, to speak on 
the amendments en bloc. 
Mr. KHANNA. Madam Speaker, I 
thank Chairman SMITH for his extraor-
dinary leadership and having a strong 
amendment to affirm the U.S.-India de-
fense partnership. I thank Ranking 
Member 
ROGERS
for 
making 
this 
amendment truly bipartisan. 
There is no relationship of greater 
significance to the United States’ stra-
tegic interests than the U.S.-India 
partnership. It is necessary to affirm 
democracies; it is necessary to stop 
China’s border aggression; it is nec-
essary for us to lead in critical tech-
nologies. 
This gives a sense that while we are 
building this relationship, we should 
not 
be 
sanctioning 
India 
under 
CAATSA, and it also will help facili-
tate India getting more of their defense 
from the United States and not Russia. 
I thank again Chairman SMITH for his 
leadership and making sure that this is 
bipartisan. I thank Kate Gould for her 
work on our staff and the HASC staff 
on this and all the other amendments.

Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Madam 
Speaker, I rise in support of these 
amendments en bloc. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to 
the gentlewoman from Puerto Rico 
(Miss GONZA´ LEZ-COLO´ N), my friend and 
colleague. 
Miss 
GONZA´ LEZ-COLO´ N. 
Madam 
Speaker, I thank Ranking Member 
ROGERS for the work he and Chairman 
SMITH did to put this bill together. 
I rise in support of the en bloc pack-
age No. 2 for the National Defense Au-
thorization Act of 2023. 
This bill includes three of my amend-
ments that will directly benefit our 
country’s national security as well as 
the people of Puerto Rico. 
My first amendment, 413, directs the 
Secretary of the Army to ensure that a 
modular small arms range is made 
available for the Army Reserve in 
Puerto Rico. 
Currently, Puerto Rico only has a 
single firearms range for Department 
of Defense personnel. It is located in 
Camp Santiago, which is the south part 
of the island, which is managed by the 
Puerto Rico National Guard, and it is 
hours away from some of our Army 
bases on the island. This amendment 
was 
included 
in 
the 
House-passed 
version of the NDAA last year. 
Amendment 416 requires the Sec-
retary of Defense to enter into an 
agreement with the National Academy 
of Sciences to investigate the health 
effects on the island of Vieques that 
may have been caused by toxic waste 
left by the Navy after 70 years of live- 
fire training. This amendment was also 
included in the House-passed version of 
the NDAA last year. 
My third and final amendment, 417, 
would require the director of the De-
fense Health Agency to conduct a 
health-related behaviors survey among 
the members of all Armed Forces. 
This survey, which has been con-
ducted for the past 30 years, was last 
conducted in 2018. However, an updated 
survey is necessary to provide the De-
partment of Defense with up-to-date 
information to better understand the 
health, health-related behaviors, and 
well-being of all servicemembers. 
Information on topics such as access 
to mental healthcare, understanding 
the post-deployment needs, and pro-
moting physical health are needed to 
identify resources and continue to im-
prove the support provided to our serv-
icemembers. 
Lastly, I will end by expressing my 
support for the following amendments 
that I cosponsored: 958, 968, and 1001, 
from my friend and fellow Women’s 
Caucus member, Representative LAW-
RENCE
from Michigan, that are in-
cluded in the en bloc package. 
Madam Speaker, I encourage all 
Members to vote in favor of this en 
bloc package No. 2. 
Mr. SMITH of Washington. Madam 
Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gen-
tlewoman 
from 
Connecticut 
(Mrs. 
HAYES) for purposes to speak on the 
amendments en bloc. 
Mrs. HAYES. Madam Speaker, I rise 
in support of the amendments en bloc 
2, which includes my amendment to 
support the mental health and nutri-
tional needs of servicemembers. 
Servicemembers across the country 
and in my State who seek mental 
healthcare often encounter outdated 
resources or a lack of information on 
military websites. Without immediate 
and accurate access to mental health 
providers, servicemembers and their 
families are left to navigate a crisis on 
their own. Servicemembers already 
have insurance hurdles that can make 
it difficult to find acceptable and cov-
ered providers. 
My amendment would help bridge 
this gap by requiring the military to 
review all installation-level web infor-
mation about suicide prevention and 
behavioral health and ensure contact 
information is up to date. My amend-
ment also requires the military to cer-
tify their review to Congress on a year-
ly basis. 
Additionally, I urge my colleagues to 
support Chairman MCGOVERN’s amend-
ment, which would require the DOD 
and the USDA to collect data on food 
insecurity 
among 
servicemembers. 
Representative 
MCGOVERN’s 
amend-
ment would require the Department of 
Defense to train and designate a point 
person on all military bases to refer 
servicemembers seeking nutritional as-
sistance. 
Last November, as chair of the House 
Agriculture Nutrition Subcommittee, I 
hosted a hearing to address hunger 
among servicemembers, and our wit-
nesses pointed out the lack of con-
sistent data to address this issue. I sup-
port this amendment and will continue 
to work with Chairman MCGOVERN to 
ensure that no family, especially mili-
tary families, go hungry. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to vote in support of the 
amendments en bloc 2 and the final Na-
tional Defense Authorization Act. 
Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Madam 
Speaker, I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. SMITH of Washington. Madam 
Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gen-
tlewoman from Texas (Ms. JACKSON 
LEE). 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, 
I rise to support amendments en bloc 2 
and thank the chairman and ranking 
member for the combination of amend-
ments that we have worked on over the 
years that I believe are crucial and im-
portant to the Nation’s safety but also 
to the men and women of the United 
States military. 
The amendment I want to highlight, 
among others, is the amendment that 
calls for the Secretary of Defense to 
evaluate and report to Congress the ex-
tent of threat to national security 
posed by domestic terrorist groups and 
organizations motivated by a belief 
system of white supremacy, such as the 
Proud Boys and Boogaloo. 
We know that those organizations 
certainly 
found 
themselves 
roving 
around during January 6 and were ac-
tually called and motivated to come to 
Washington by the former President of 
the United States. 
We also know that Director Wray has 
indicated that domestic terrorism is 
one of greatest threats to the United 
States. As reported in the media and 
government intelligence reports, cou-
pled with recent arrests and successful 
violent attacks carried out by the 
Boogaloo Bois and militia extremists, 
these representations are very trou-
bling. 
My concern is that as the Nation 
moves toward a historic national elec-
tion, the activity of violent influences, 
like the Boogaloo Bois and Proud Boys, 
will increase and lead to attacks be-
coming more frequent. I ask my col-
leagues to continue to support the 
amendments en bloc 2 for that amend-
ment. 
I also want to highlight my amend-
ment that asks for $10 million to in-
crease funding for increased collabora-
tion between the DOD Office of Health 
and the National Institutes of Health

for research to combat triple-negative 
breast cancer. 
As a breast cancer survivor myself, I 
can tell you the enormous impact that 
triple-negative breast cancer has. It is 
a particular form of breast cancer that 
metastasizes very quickly. It accounts 
for between 13 to 25 percent of all 
breast cancer in the United States, the 
onset is at a younger age, and it is 
more aggressive and more likely to me-
tastasize. This work will help young 
women in the United States military 
and young men, who also are some-
times diagnosed with breast cancer. 
Let me also ask for support for post- 
traumatic 
stress 
disorder. 
I 
have 
worked on this for many, many years, 
even developed a center in my district 
off campus from the veterans’ hospital. 
PTSD was first brought to public at-
tention in relation to war veterans, but 
it can result from a variety of trau-
matic incidents. The increase, I be-
lieve, reaffirms the importance of help-
ing those with PTSD and restoring 
their lives. 
I want to make sure as well that my 
amendment dealing with requiring the 
chief of the National Guard, in coordi-
nation with the Secretary of Defense, 
to submit to Congress and other enti-
ties a report identifying personnel 
training and equipment required by the 
non-federalized National Guard to pre-
vent, mitigate, respond, and recover 
from natural and manmade disasters. 
Houston is hurricane prone. I cannot 
tell you the kind of work and leader-
ship that the Texas National Guard has 
done on behalf of my constituents and 
the entire State when we have been in 
trouble. The huge trucks that have 
come in with MREs and the help during 
the flooding has been enormous. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues 
to support all of my amendments and 
to highlight those that I have just 
highlighted. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentlewoman has expired. 
Mr. SMITH of Washington. Madam 
Speaker, I yield an additional 30 sec-
onds to the gentlewoman from Texas. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, 
I will just emphasize that the National 
Guard has been enormously effective in 
helping us during disaster. 
But let me finish quickly with the 
amendment dealing with young people 
in the academy, in particular a young 
cadet that had a stuttering issue. My 
amendment says that cadets should be 
diagnosed 
with 
whatever 
disability 
they may have, be assessed, do their 4 
years, and when it comes time for a 
command, don’t push them out like 
this young cadet was, but to ensure 
that they have the ability, with their 
talents, to be able to accept a com-
mand. They want to serve their Nation. 
Madam Speaker, I ask support for 
the amendments en bloc 2 and all of my 
amendments. 
Thank you, Madam Speaker, for this oppor-
tunity to express my support for H.R. 7900, 
the ‘‘National Defense Authorization Act for FY 
2023.’’ 
Congress has the solemn duty to ensure 
that those who wear the uniform of the United 
States—and 
those 
civilians 
who 
provide 
logistical and operational support—have the 
equipment, training, and resources needed to 
carry out and complete their mission. 
And we must never forget that a grateful na-
tion has a sacred obligation, in the words of 
President Lincoln, ‘‘to care for him who has 
borne the battle, and for his widow and his or-
phan.’’ 
Many of my amendments were made in 
order by the Rules Committee. I would like to 
summarize them, two of which were included 
in En Bloc 1: 
First, amendment 59 recognizes that Black 
men and women have played an integral role 
in our nation’s defense from the bravery of 
Crispus Attucks, an escaped slave, during the 
Boston Massacre, to the present day. The 
amendment would address the historical and 
current barriers to Black Americans’ participa-
tion and equal treatment in the Armed Serv-
ices. 
I would like to elaborate on the importance 
of Amendment 59, about the lessons that can 
be learned about the social, cultural, legal, 
and logistical impacts, as well as the ad-
vances made, by the integration of African 
Americans into the warfighting capacity of our 
nation. 
The racial inequality and mistreatment of 
Black men and women that has historically 
permeated our military continues to this day, 
with more than 750 complaints of racial or eth-
nic discrimination from service members in fis-
cal year 2020 alone. 
But discrimination doesn’t exist just within 
the military rank-and-file, as in that same fiscal 
year, civilians working in the financial, tech-
nical and support sectors of the Army, Air 
Force and Navy also filed 900 complaints of 
racial discrimination and over 350 complaints 
of discrimination by skin color, data from the 
U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commis-
sion shows. 
According to a report by the Defense De-
partment’s Diversity and Inclusion Board, while 
the enlisted ranks of the active and reserve 
military were ‘‘slightly more racially and eth-
nically diverse than its U.S. civilian counter-
parts,’’ the opposite was true for the officer 
corps. 
We owe it to those brave men and women 
who have proven time and time again to be an 
integral part of our military to examine the 
Armed Services’ history of discrimination and 
to determine the necessary steps to repair the 
harm caused by these inequities. 
Second, my amendment 28 directs the Sec-
retary of Defense to evaluate, and report to 
Congress, about the extent of the threat to na-
tional security posed by domestic terrorist 
groups and organizations motivated by a belief 
system of white supremacy, such as the 
Proud Boys and Boogaloo. 
In the past and with greater intensity, I have 
raised concerns over the role that Boogaloo 
and Proud Boys have played in bringing an 
element of violence into the otherwise peace-
ful protests following the death of George 
Floyd. 
The violence seen during the recent national 
movement to end the deaths of unarmed black 
men while in police custody is not the start of 
these 
violent 
activities 
associated 
with 
Boogaloo movement or Proud Boys activity. 
The threat posed by accelerationists and mi-
litia extremists—a range of violent anti-govern-
ment actors, movements, and organizations, 
some of which branch out of decades-old 
ideologies and others which are relatively new 
has led to violent engagement of law enforce-
ment. 
These varied threats range from decentral-
ized and leaderless accelerationist networks 
using social media platforms, such as the 
Boogaloo movement, to more structured, far- 
right militia extremist groups. 
The ideologies undergirding these move-
ments or groups have some similarities to 
other anti-government and white supremacist 
beliefs but are often not tied to a single, mon-
olithic ideology. 
In addition, in many cases, their adherents’ 
decentralized and coded use of digital tools 
poses unique challenges for law enforcement 
and government officials to identify and track 
their activity. 
These developments in domestic terrorism, 
as reported in the media and government in-
telligence reports—coupled with recent arrests 
and successful violent attacks carried out by 
‘‘Boogaloo boys’’ and militia extremists—are 
troubling. 
My concern is that as the nation moves to-
ward a historic national election, the activity of 
violence influencers like Boogaloo Boys or 
Proud Boys will increase and lead to attacks 
becoming more frequent. 
In 2018, we saw too many instances of vio-
lent extremist searching for opportunities to 
sow violence and disrupt democratic proc-
esses. 
Boogaloo and Proud Boys are targeting 
constitutionally protected activity for cooption 
or to provide cover for attacks. 
This amendment will result in a report that 
will provide valuable insight into activities as-
sociated with Boogaloo and Proud Boys. 
Under the guidance that produced this re-
port, there should not be any activity directed 
at groups that are not known for violent activ-
ity or have a history of engaging in violence 
directed at the United States government. 
My next amendments were adopted in En 
Bloc 2: 
Amendment 194—Provides authorization for 
a $10 million increase in funding for increased 
collaboration between the DoD Office of 
Health and the National Institutes of Health to 
research and combat Triple Negative Breast 
Cancer. 
As a Member of Congress, a mother, a sis-
ter and a spouse, and a breast cancer sur-
vivor, I feel a special responsibility to do all I 
can to ensure every American can win in the 
fight against all types of breast cancer but es-
pecially triple negative breast cancer (TNBC). 
About 10–20 percent of breast cancers test 
negative for both hormone receptors and 
HER2 in the lab, which means they are triple- 
negative. 
What is Triple Negative Breast Cancer? The 
term triple negative breast cancer refers to the 
fact that this form of breast cancer will test 
negative, which means that each of the test 
will return negative results for the presence of 
breast cancer for three types of breast cancer 
tests: 
Estrogen receptor; 
Progesterone receptor; and 
human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 
or the HER2 test will be negative. 
To understand triple-negative breast cancer, 
it’s important to understand receptors, which 
are proteins found inside and on the surface

of cells. These receptor proteins are the 
‘‘eyes’’ and ‘‘ears’’ of the cells, receiving mes-
sages from substances in the bloodstream 
and then telling the cells what to do. 
Hormone receptors inside and on the sur-
face of healthy breast cells receive messages 
from the hormones estrogen and progester-
one. The hormones attach to the receptors 
and provide instructions that help the cells 
continue to grow and function well. 
Most, but not all, breast cancer cells also 
have these hormone receptors. 
Roughly 2 out of 3 women have breast can-
cer that tests positive for hormone receptors. 
In 2013, the American Cancer Society Sur-
veillance and Health Services Institute esti-
mated that 27,060 black women would be di-
agnosed with the illness. 
The rate of breast cancer is 10 percent 
lower in African American women than white 
women—it is the type of breast cancer (Triple 
Negative) that African American women con-
tract that is alarming. 
Because African American women are diag-
nosed in greater numbers with Triple Negative 
Breast Cancer we have a five year survival 
rate of 78 percent after diagnosis as com-
pared to 90 percent for white women. 
The incidence rate of breast cancer among 
women under 45 is higher for African Amer-
ican women compared to white women. 
Triple Negative Breast Cancer: 
Accounts for between 13 percent and 25 
percent of all breast cancer in the US; 
Onset is at a younger age; 
Is more aggressive; and 
Is more likely to metastasize. 
Currently, 70 percent of women with meta-
static triple negative breast cancer do not live 
more than five years after being diagnosed. 
African American women are 3 times more 
likely to develop triple-negative breast cancer 
than White women. African-American women 
have prevalence TNBC of 26 percent vs. 16 
percent in non-African-Americans women. 
The key to beating this cancer is not just 
early detection—but detection period. 
A 2007 study of more than 50,000 women 
with all stages of breast cancer found that 77 
percent of women with triple-negative breast 
cancer survived at least 5 years, versus 93 
percent of women with other types of breast 
cancer. 
Another study of more than 1,600 women 
published in 2007 found that women with tri-
ple-negative breast cancer had a higher risk of 
death within 5 years of diagnosis, but not after 
that time period. 
The recurrence and survival figures in these 
and other studies are averages for all women 
with triple-negative breast cancer. 
The DoD needs to be prioritizing this very 
real and lethal condition to ensure women are 
being protected. 
Amendment 195 directs the Secretary of 
Defense to audit current practices regarding 
administration of sexual harassment claims 
and submit a report no later 180 days after 
passage detailing efforts to prevent sexual 
harassment and protect service-members, and 
compiling data and research on sexual har-
assment prevalence in the military, cases re-
ported, legal proceedings, and convictions. 
Sexual assault is endemic in our military, 
especially for female armed service members. 
Streamlining and auditing the process of re-
porting sexual assault protects victims and is 
a necessary step in weeding out abusers. 
Amendment 191 provides authorization for 
$2.5 million increase in funding to combat 
post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). 
According to the NIH, an estimated 3.6 per-
cent of U.S. adults had PTSD in the past year. 
PTSD was first brought to public attention in 
relation to war veterans, but it can result from 
a variety of traumatic incidents, such as tor-
ture, being kidnapped or held captive, bomb-
ings, or natural disasters such as floods or 
earthquakes. 
People with PTSD may startle easily, be-
come emotionally numb (especially in relation 
to people with whom they used to be close), 
lose interest in things they used to enjoy, have 
trouble feeling affectionate, be irritable, be-
come more aggressive, or even become vio-
lent. 
They avoid situations that remind them of 
the original incident, and anniversaries of the 
incident are often very difficult. 
Most people with PTSD repeatedly relive 
the trauma in their thoughts during the day 
and in nightmares when they sleep. These are 
called flashbacks. A person having a flash-
back may lose touch with reality and believe 
that the traumatic incident is happening all 
over again. 
My amendment recognizes that these sol-
diers are first and foremost, human. They 
carry their experiences with them. 
Ask a veteran of Vietnam, Iraq, or Afghani-
stan about the frequency of nightmares they 
experience, and one will realize that serving in 
the Armed Forces leaves a lasting impression, 
whether good or bad. 
My amendment will help ensure that ‘‘no 
soldier is left behind’’ by addressing the urgent 
need for more outreach toward hard to reach 
veterans suffering from PTSD, especially 
those who are homeless or reside in under-
served urban and rural areas of our country. 
Amendment 199 directs the Secretary of 
Defense to promulgate regulations to ensure 
that candidates granted admission to attend a 
military 
academy 
undergo 
screening 
for 
speech disorders and be provided the results 
of the screening test and a list of warfare un-
restricted line (URL) Officer positions and oc-
cupation specialists that require successful 
performance on the speech test. 
Academy students should have the option of 
undergoing speech therapy to reduce speech 
disorders or impediments. 
Amendment 188 directs the Secretary to 
submit to Congress within 180 days a report 
on the recognition of African Americans who 
have served in the Armed Forces and oppor-
tunities for their inclusion in DOD naming 
practices and conventions for military installa-
tions, infrastructure, vessels, and weapon sys-
tems. 
In every war waged from the Battle of Lex-
ington to the Battle for Fallujah, African Ameri-
cans have honorably answered the call to 
duty, and served with valor and distinction in 
America’s armed forces. 
At decisive moments in our nation’s history, 
the United States military and its citizen war-
riors, were there and made the difference. 
Our thanks to the military for being always 
ready to answer the call of duty—whether that 
call comes in the dead of night or the light of 
day—we know that we can count on you. 
The fact that military bases have been 
named after Confederate military leaders or 
soldiers is hard to imagine given that they 
were fighting to end the United States. The 
Confederacy was not something that should 
be held up for honor by the United States or 
our nation’s military. 
There is no shortage of honorable replace-
ment candidates to receive the honor of hav-
ing a military base, installation or facility 
named in their honor. 
Amendment 198 requires the Chief of the 
National Guard Bureau, in coordination with 
the Secretary of Defense, to submit to Con-
gress and other entities in 2023, 2024, and 
2025 a report identifying the personnel, train-
ing, and equipment required by the non-fed-
eralized National Guard to prevent, mitigate, 
respond to, and recover from natural and 
man-made disasters. 
Hurricane Harvey’s impact in Texas is still 
being felt more than 30 months later. The 
storm’s footprint covered over 9,000 square 
miles, including the city of Houston. Hurricane 
Harvey dropped over 52 inches of rain in the 
Houston area and over 60 inches were re-
corded elsewhere in the state. 
At its peak on September 1, 2017, one-third 
of Houston, our nation’s fourth largest city, 
was underwater leaving 34,575 evacuees in 
shelters across Texas. Before the flood waters 
had receded in Houston two other monster 
Hurricanes were bearing down on citizens liv-
ing in the U.S. Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico. 
The scope and magnitude of these dueling 
disasters tested the National Guard and Re-
servists in ways that were new. 
This amendment requires a readiness report 
by the National Guard and Reservists to make 
sure they have what they need to assist com-
munities in need of disaster assistance during 
future Hurricane Seasons. 
Many Texans are still recovering from Hurri-
cane Harvey, and the same is true of resi-
dents of many other areas hit hard by disas-
ters. 
My amendment will help the National Guard 
help communities prepare for disasters, re-
spond to them, and rebuild from them. 
It will improve the ability to support the im-
portant mission of the National Guard and Re-
servists to engage in disaster response. 
Amendment 197 requires the Secretary of 
the Navy, not later than 180 days after enact-
ment of this Act, to submit to Congress a re-
port on desalinization technology’s application 
for defense and national security purposes to 
provide drought relief to areas impacted by 
sharp declines in water resources. 
In 2010, the United States consumed about 
355,000 million gallons of water per day. 
Worldwide, some 700 million people do not 
have access to enough clean water. 
In 10 years the number is expected to more 
than double to 1.8 billion. 
Two-thirds of the Earth’s surface is water, 
but in fact less than 1 percent it is available 
for human use. 
The rest of the water on our planet is either 
salt water found in oceans, fresh water frozen 
in the polar ice caps, or too inaccessible for 
practical usage. 
While population and demand on freshwater 
resources are increasing, supply will always 
remain constant. 
And although the water cycle continuously 
returns water to Earth, it is not always re-
turned to the same place, or in the same 
quantity and quality. 
I offered this amendment because we must 
plan for the future water needs of our nation 
and our defense facilities and operations 
worldwide.

There are serious water shortages in some 
regions of the country and the prospects that 
sustained water shortages due to regional 
growth and climate factors may make it nec-
essary to develop alternative sources for water 
intended for human and agricultural uses. 
If we can harness the technology to convert 
ocean water into fresh water the future of cit-
ies and rural communities that depend on 
water can be much brighter. 
Amendment 190 requires a report to be 
submitted to Congress within 240 days fol-
lowing enactment on the risks posed by debris 
in low earth orbit and to make recommenda-
tions on remediation of risks and outline plans 
to reduce the incident of space debris. 
Man-made objects in Earth’s orbit that may 
no longer serve a useful function can include 
nonfunctional spacecraft, abandoned launch 
vehicle stages, mission-related debris and 
fragmentation debris. 
Space debris travels at speeds up to 17,500 
miles per hour is fast enough for a small piece 
of man-made debris to damage to a satellite 
or a spacecraft. 
There are 500,000 pieces of debris the size 
of a marble or larger. 
There are many millions of pieces of debris 
that are so small they can’t be tracked. 
The Jackson Lee Amendment seeks a re-
port from the Secretary of Defense on the 
risks posed by man-made space debris, solu-
tions for reducing risks and strategies for re-
ducing the incidence of more man-made 
space debris being introduced into space. 
Amendment 193 condemns the actions of 
Boko Haram and directs that the Secretary of 
State, in consultation with the Secretary of De-
fense and the Attorney General, submit a re-
port on efforts to combat Boko Haram. 
Amendment 189 requires a report to be 
submitted within 220 days following enactment 
on Capacity to Provide Disaster Survivors with 
Emergency Short Term Housing. 
Amendment 196 directs the Secretary of 
Defense to report to Congress in not less than 
180 days the actions taken to protect U.S. 
armed service personnel from armed attacks 
conducted by militants and terrorists in pursuit 
of bounties and inducements the agencies, or-
ganizations, or entities aligned with the Rus-
sian Federation. 
Finally, amendment 192 requires the Sec-
retary of Defense to report to Congress pro-
grams and procedures employed to ensure 
students studying abroad through Department 
of Defense National Security Education Pro-
grams are trained to recognize, resist, and re-
port against recruitment efforts by agents of 
foreign governments.

RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY 
LEADER 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The minority leader is recog-
nized. 
f 
INFLATION 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President, 
this morning, this all-Democratic gov-
ernment produced yet another abso-
lutely terrible, terrible inflation re-
port. Inflation during the month of 
June 
shattered 
the 
experts’ 
pre-
dictions. We are now—listen to this—at 
9.1 percent annual inflation; yet an-
other fresh 40-year high, the most out- 
of-control 
inflation 
that 
American 
families have seen since the early 1980s. 
Food costs are up more than 10 per-
cent. Energy costs are up more than 40 
percent. The costs of the fuel that 
drives us to work, delivers our goods, 
and drives our economy are all up over 
60 percent. 
These 
are 
staggeringly—stagger-
ingly—bad numbers. And they were 
fueled directly by the reckless spend-
ing spree that the Democrats rammed 
through on party lines just last year. 
Remember, right before the $2 tril-
lion spending spree, President Biden 
said: 
The biggest risk is not going too big . . . 
it’s if we go too small. 
The Senate Democratic leader said: 
I do not think the dangers of inflation, at 
least in the near-term, are very real. 
These 
were 
gigantic—gigantic— 
unforced errors. One leading economist 
recently said the so-called American 
Rescue Plan was ‘‘arguably the biggest 
fiscal policy mistake in several dec-
ades.’’ 
Our core inflation rate here in Amer-
ica is more than 2 percentage points 
higher than in Europe. Inflation is 
uniquely bad here because our all- 
Democratic 
government 
has 
made 
uniquely bad choices. And now Amer-
ican families are dealing with the fall-
out every single day. 
It is no secret how much the Amer-
ican people disapprove of the course 
Washington Democrats have put us on. 
They say so in poll after poll after poll. 
So you might think by now that our 
colleagues would be ready to try a dif-
ferent approach. 
Well, guess again. President Biden 
and his party, fresh off of spending 
America into inflation, now want to 
tax-hike us into recession. They are be-
hind closed doors playing around with 
what may amount to the single largest 
tax increase in American history. 
Tucked inside are exactly the sort of 
radical ideas that working families can 
least afford right now. 
They want a giant tax hike on pass-
through small businesses, a category— 
listen to this—that encompasses 95 per-
cent of all businesses in the country— 
95 percent of them. Take it from a con-
stituent of mine in Mount Sterling, 
KY, who put it this way: 
Small business is already in a struggle to 
survive with all the taxes and regulations we 
have to deal with. Adding another tax is only 
making things worse. 
Democrats also want a so-called 
‘‘methane fee’’ that amounts to a big 
new tax hike on domestic natural gas, 
while their inflation has pushed Amer-
ican families’ natural gas prices and 
electricity costs up through the roof 
already. 
If following reckless spending and 
runaway inflation with a gigantic, 
painful tax hike sounds like a bad idea 
to you, believe me, you are not alone. 
Even some House Democrats are light-
ing their hair on fire over what a ter-
rible idea these discussions are. 
One House Democrat from New Jer-
sey is telling reporters that she is ‘‘not

for any type of legislation that raises 
taxes . . . especially right now, as my 
constituents are facing inflation, cost 
of living [increases] . . . [and] housing 
prices.’’ 
Well, let me put it this way. When 
House Democrats from the Northeast 
start trying to sound more like Ronald 
Reagan running against Jimmy Carter, 
you know they have gotten themselves 
into a fix. 
Too bad every single House Democrat 
except one and every single Senate 
Democrat voted for the $2 trillion mis-
take that brought us to where we are. 
The Democrats complaining about in-
flation today voted in lockstep for the 
bill that brought us here. And now 
their answer to picking families’ pock-

f 
U.S. SUPREME COURT 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President, 
now on an entirely different matter, 
this week, I have been discussing the 
historic term the Supreme Court just 
concluded—the most consequential and 
pro-Constitution 
term 
since 
Brown 
overturned Plessy almost 70 years ago. 
Back in 2015, in one fell swoop, the 
Obama-Biden administration took aim 
at domestic energy production, harmed 
the separation of powers, and attacked 
the rule of law. 
Remember, after Americans elected 
Republicans in 2010 to place a check on 
the leftwing agenda, President Obama 
infamously said he would just ignore 
the will of the people and work around 
Congress. Here was his quote. He said, 
‘‘I’ve got a pen.’’ He said, ‘‘I’ve got a 
phone.’’ 
Thus began a whole series of uncon-
stitutional power grabs by the execu-
tive branch, a sort of crime spree 
against the Constitution. For example, 
when Democrats could not get harmful 
and unpopular environmental restric-
tions through Congress because the 
people’s duly elected representatives 
did not support them, the bureaucrats 
at the Obama EPA decided to pretend 
that some obscure lines in an old law 
actually gave them enormous sweeping 
regulatory powers to manage our econ-
omy which nobody had ever noticed be-
fore. 
The EPA effectively wrote and passed 
a giant piece of legislation, the so- 
called Clean Power Plan, as one branch 
of government acting alone. They tried 
to make law without involving actual 
lawmakers. The Obama EPA just up 
and decided they could start giving or-
ders and issuing edicts and remake our 
country’s electricity grid by brute 
force. 
Of course, the pretext was simply 
false. 
As Justice Scalia once wrote, ‘‘Con-
gress . . . does not alter the funda-
mental details of a regulatory scheme 
in vague terms or ancillary provi-
sions—it does not, one might say, hide 
elephants in mouse holes.’’ 
When the legislative branch actually 
intends to hand over giant chunks of 
our power to unelected bureaucrats, we 
make it pretty darn clear. The Obama- 
Biden EPA had no lawful authority to 
grab control of electricity generation 
all across America. And that is exactly 
what the Supreme Court affirmed last 
month. 
The ruling was a huge win for Amer-
ican 
ratepayers 
and 
anybody 
who 
wants affordable and reliable energy; 
but it was also a landmark legal vic-
tory for our very system of govern-
ment. The Supreme Court applied the 
plain text of the law and reaffirmed 
that the unelected administrative state 
is not allowed to reach way beyond the 
powers that Congress has actually 
given it. With any luck, this will be 
part of a sea change that has been a 
long time coming. 
Remember a few months ago, a 
young district judge in Florida applied 
the plain, straightforward text of a 
statute and overturned the administra-
tion’s illegal and unilateral mask man-
date for public transportation. That 
was the Centers for Disease Control 
stepping way, way over its boundaries. 
And this past January, the Supreme 
Court put the brakes on President 
Biden’s blatantly illegal attempt to 
have the Occupational Safety and 
Health Administration, OSHA, force 84 
million American workers to get the 
COVID vaccine whether they wanted it 
or not. 
As Justice Gorsuch wrote in concur-
rence back then: 
The central question we face today is: Who 
decides? The only question is whether an ad-
ministrative agency in Washington . . . 
charged with overseeing workplace safety 
may mandate the vaccination or regular 
testing of 84 million people . . . 
Justice Gorsuch continued: 
Or whether . . . that work belongs to state 
and local governments across the country 
and the people’s elected representatives in 
Congress. 
On issue after issue, our courts are 
beginning to answer that question the 
way the Constitution commands. ‘‘Who 
decides?’’ is the question. The answer: 
The people decide and the Members of 
Congress they elect. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. BROWN. Madam President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded.

Barr, of Michigan, to be a Member of 
the Board of Governors of the Federal 
Reserve System for the unexpired term 
of fourteen years from February 1, 2018. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The Senator from Ohio. 
NOMINATION OF MICHAEL S. BARR 
Mr. BROWN. Madam President, I 
urge my colleagues to join me in sup-
porting the nomination of Michael 
Barr to be a member of the Board of 
Governors of the Federal Reserve Sys-
tem and the Vice Chair for Super-
vision. 
His confirmation is expected today, 
but we hold votes on these things to 
find out for sure. His confirmation will 
mean that the Federal Reserve, for the 
first time in years, will have a com-
plement of all seven members. 
I credit the Biden administration for 
being aggressive in doing that. I credit 
the committee, which I chair. The Act-
ing President pro tempore is a promi-
nent member of that committee, Sen-
ator WARREN, and I thank her for her 
work on this. It is a big deal. 
Mr. Barr is a qualified nominee who 
came out of the Banking, Housing, and 
Urban Affairs Committee with strong 
bipartisan support. Five Republicans, 
including Ranking Member TOOMEY, 
and all 12 Democrats supported his 
nomination. It is clear why. He is a 
leading expert with decades of experi-
ence in helping to guide and protect 
our economy, including having experi-
ence with financial institutions and fi-
nancial regulation. 
He has served this country at the De-
partments of Treasury and State as 
well as at the White House. At the 
Treasury Department, as Assistant 
Secretary for Financial Institutions, 
Mr. Barr played a critical role in re-
sponding to the 2008 financial crisis 
when Wall Street greed and reckless-
ness crashed our economy. 
I know especially, as I said on the 
floor, what it did to my community, 
even to my neighborhood. The ZIP 
Code in which Connie and I live in 
Cleveland, 44105, had more foreclosures 
in the first half of 2007 than had any 
ZIP Code in America, and we still live 
with that. 
We passed the Dodd-Frank Wall 
Street Reform Act back then. Among 
the many steps the legislation took to 
prevent another crisis, we created the 
Vice Chair for Supervision to identify 
and to stay ahead of risks to our coun-
try’s 
financial 
system, 
like 
cyber 
threats, volatile cryptocurrency, or the 
climate crisis. We created this job to 
hold the biggest banks accountable so

that Wall Street wouldn’t put working 
families and businesses on Main Street 
at risk again. 
We know Wall Street puts its own in-
terests first always. We know, too 
often, it is at the risk of small busi-
nesses, at the risk of working families, 
at the risk of the middle class, and at 
the risk of low-income people. We un-
derstand that that is their behavior, 
and the purpose of Dodd-Frank was as 
far as we could go to fix that. 
Mr. Barr has worked for a quarter 
century to make our financial system 
safer and fairer. He has focused on de-
veloping and evaluating financial regu-
latory policies. Most importantly, he 
has a keen understanding of the type of 
risks that pose threats to our financial 
stability. Mr. Barr will join the Federal 
Reserve Board of Governors at a crit-
ical time for our economy, maintaining 
Federal Reserve independence along 
the way. 
In response to a question for the 
record, Mr. Barr told us the following: 
Independence is critical for the Federal Re-
serve to effectively carry out its congres-
sional mandate to promote maximum em-
ployment and price stability. Politics should 
play no role in setting monetary policy. . . . 
I am committed, if confirmed— 
He wrote— 
to adhere strictly to a non-political, data- 
driven, independent approach to policy mak-
ing. 
I support Mr. Barr’s nomination in 
this critical role. Once confirmed, as I 
said, we will have a full Federal Re-
serve Board, with all seven members. It 
has been almost a decade since we have 
been able to do that. It has taken this 
new President and this new majority in 
the Senate to do that, and I thank all 
of my colleagues who have played a 
role in that. 
I urge my colleagues to support the 
nomination of Michael Barr. 
NOMINATION OF OWEN EDWARD HERRNSTADT 
Madam President, I urge my col-
leagues to support another nominee 
out of the Senate Banking, Housing, 
and Urban Affairs Committee, Owen 
Herrnstadt, who is the nominee to be a 
member of the Board of Directors of 
the Export-Import Bank of the United 
States. 
Like Mr. Barr, Mr. Herrnstadt re-
ceived bipartisan support out of the 
Banking Committee. We now have four 
of the five members of the Ex-Im Bank. 
We will have, after today, after this 
week—I am hopeful—four of the five 
members of the Export-Import Bank 
confirmed and in place. We are still 
waiting for Senator MCCONNELL to tell 
the White House and offer the fifth 
nominee, a Republican nominee, so we 
can fill out that Board. 
Our 
foreign 
competitors 
operate 
more than 100 export credit agencies 
and credit programs supporting their 
manufacturers. China’s export finance 
activity is larger than all of the export 
credit that G7 countries collectively 
provide, and China will continue to use 
export credit to win manufacturing 
business in critical sectors. 
I would point out, parenthetically, 
that under this new leadership in the 
Senate and new leadership in the White 
House, for the first time in 20 years, 
our economy is growing faster than 
China’s. Our GDP growth is actually 
faster than that of the People’s Repub-
lic of China—something we haven’t 
seen in 20 years. 
Mr. Herrnstadt will help lead our Na-
tion’s official export credit Agency as 
it supports American workers and 
manufacturers throughout our coun-
try. He has served some 30 years in sen-
ior roles at the International Associa-
tion 
of 
Machinists 
and 
Aerospace 
Workers, and he has served on Ex-Im’s 
Advisory Committee. He is more than 
qualified to join the Ex-Im Board. 
He will be a voice for American work-
ers. He understands, as the majority of 
this Senate does, that we put workers 
at the center of our economy, workers 
at the center of our economic policy, 
and workers at the center of policy-
making in this institution. Too often, 
American workers, as Mr. Herrnstadt 
fully understands, have been forced to 
compete with unfair foreign competi-
tion for far, far too long. 
The Banking Committee reported his 
nomination by voice vote twice—last 
fall and again earlier this year. Again, 
as a 30-year-long labor activist, fight-
ing for workers, he is supported by the 
U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the Na-
tional Association of Manufacturers, 
and other advocates for American busi-
nesses and workers. 
Yet, despite his receiving broad sup-
port, a small number of Senators con-
tinues to oppose anything—anything— 
related to the Ex-Im Bank, so we are 
forced to have a cloture vote today on 
his nomination. 
Our competitors are not going to 
stop financing their business sales. We 
need 
Ex-Im 
to 
compete, 
and 
Mr. 
Herrnstadt is needed on that Board to 
help the Ex-Im Bank deliver results. 
He will join Ex-Im President Reta Jo 
Lewis; my fellow Ohioan and first Vice 
President, Judith Pryor; and Ex-Im 
Board member and former Congress-
man Spencer Bachus, a Republican 
from Alabama, who have been working 
on a bipartisan basis to carry out the 
mission given by Congress in the 2019 
reauthorization to help American ex-
porters compete with China. 
We know—and the Acting President 
pro tempore has been very engaged in 
this in her Senate career—that bad 
trade agreements and bad tax policy 
have led to far too many companies 
shutting down production in Worces-
ter, MA, and Wooster, OH, and to their 
moving overseas and selling those 
products back into the United States 
while exploiting cheap labor and ex-
ploiting weak environmental laws and 
weak worker safety laws but gaining 
from bad American trade policy and 
bad American tax policy. 
The Ex-Im Bank helps us to correct 
that. So does Brown-Wyden and what 
we have done to level the playing field 
on those issues that this new majority 
in the Senate, with this new President, 
has finally decided to enact, making a 
real difference in not just our balance 
of trade but making, fundamentally, 
the most important difference—a real 
difference—for American workers who 
are the most productive in the world. 
I strongly urge my colleagues to join 
me in supporting Owen Herrnstadt’s 
nomination to the Export-Import Bank 
Board. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
KING). Without objection, it is so or-
dered. 
INFLATION 
Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, inflation 
numbers came out this morning, and, 
once again, they were not good. Infla-
tion in June was 9.1 percent—9.1 per-
cent, the highest level since November 
of 1981. 
Groceries are up 12 percent, on aver-
age. Baby food is up 14 percent, milk up 
16 percent. Chicken is up 18 percent. 
And the list goes on. Household clean-
ing products are up 11 percent. Gas 
prices are up nearly 60 percent. Fur-
niture and bedding are up 13 percent. 
Utility gas service is up 38 percent. 
Health insurance is up 17 percent and 
on and on and on. 
Everywhere Americans look, they are 
facing price increases, price increases 
on the most essential items: groceries, 
gas, their utility bills. And on top of 
all this, real average hourly earnings 
are currently declining at the fastest 
pace in 40 years. Fifty-eight percent of 
Americans are living paycheck to pay-
check. Price increases on the most es-
sential 
items—groceries, 
gas, 
their 
utility bills—all these things are forc-
ing Americans to dig into their sav-
ings, when they have them, to try and 
make ends meet. 
Others are relying on things like 
credit cards or visits to food banks. De-
mand for food assistance has soared in 
recent months. One organization in my 
hometown in South Dakota received 
600 more calls for food assistance in 
May of this year than it had received 
in the same month a year ago. Food 
banks often have fewer resources to 
meet the need, thanks to declines in 
donations and the high price of gro-
ceries. And there is no end to this pain 
in sight. 
A recent Joint Economic Committee 
analysis found that inflation will cost 
the average household $7,620 over the 
next year or $635 per month—$635 per 
month. That is an unsustainable bur-
den for working families. 
By now, most Americans are familiar 
with how we got here. When President 
Biden took office, inflation was at 1.4 
percent, well within the Fed’s target 
inflation rate of 2 percent. And it 
might have stayed there had Demo-
crats not decided to pass a massive and

July 13, 2022 
partisan $1.9 trillion spending spree 
under the guise of COVID relief, mere 
weeks—mere 
weeks—after 
Congress 
had passed a fifth bipartisan COVID 
bill that met essentially all current 
pressing COVID needs. 
The Democrats’ so-called American 
Rescue Plan sent a lot of unnecessary 
government money into the economy, 
and the economy overheated as a re-
sult. You don’t have to take my word 
for that on the damaging effects of this 
legislation. Here is what one Demo-
cratic economist who worked in the 
Obama administration had to say on 
the subject: 
The $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan 
passed in the early days of the Biden admin-
istration will go down in history as an ex-
traordinary policy mistake. 
Another former Obama adviser noted: 
The original sin was an oversized American 
Rescue Plan. It contributed to both higher 
output but also higher prices. 
Those are warnings that came from 
Democrats that their so-called Amer-
ican Rescue Plan ran the risk of over-
heating the economy, but Democrats 
here in Congress passed it anyway. The 
President signed it. 
What is also worse is that even after 
they saw the inflation that resulted 
from their $1.9 trillion boondoggle, 
they spent months last year trying to 
double down on the reckless spending 
that helped cause so much inflation in 
the first place. Even as inflation was 
steadily increasing, Democrats spent 
months working to pass their so-called 
Build Back Better bill—a multitrillion- 
dollar—trillion-dollar—reckless 
tax- 
and-spending spree that would have 
dumped more unnecessary government 
money into an already overheated 
economy. But, fortunately, their ef-
forts ultimately failed last December. 
But like a zombie, Democrats’ Build 
Back Better tax-and-spending spree 
just keeps coming back from the dead. 
That is right. Despite the fact that our 
inflation crisis is even worse—worse 
now than it was last fall—Democrats 
are once again considering a version of 
their Build Back Better tax-and-spend-
ing spree. We don’t know all the details 
yet, but what we do know—what we do 
know—is cause for alarm. 
Democrats are planning to raise 
taxes by a trillion dollars—$1 trillion— 
and a substantial part of that tax in-
crease would come in the form of new 
taxes on small businesses. That is 
right, on small individually and fam-
ily-owned businesses or what are often 
called passthrough businesses; in other 
words, Main Street America, the busi-
nesses that create jobs. 
In South Dakota, passthroughs, such 
as sole proprietorships, S corporations, 
and partnerships, employ an estimated 
68 percent of the private sector and 
represent almost 100 percent—99 per-
cent or thereabouts—of all businesses 
in my home State of South Dakota. 
Nationwide, more than 90 percent of 
American businesses are passthroughs, 
and these businesses employ tens of 
millions of Americans. 
Small business owners’ expectations 
for better business conditions recently 
hit an alltime low. Business owners are 
struggling with the high cost of every-
thing, from inputs to electricity, as in-
flation continues to soar and global 
supply chains continue to be sluggish. 
I recently read a comment from one 
small business owner in South Dakota 
who noted: 
It’s hard when you’re working so hard but 
you’re not making money. . . . We are right 
there right now. 
‘‘It’s hard when you are working so 
hard but you’re not making money.’’ 
Yes, it is. 
And if Democrats have their way, life 
for small business owners—and their 
employees—is going to get even harder 
because raising taxes on businesses will 
lead to a combination of lower wages 
for workers, lower returns for business 
owners, and higher prices for goods and 
services. It is just intuitive. 
Think about it. If you are a small 
business owner, you are paying more 
for inputs and all the supplies that you 
need to run your business, and then 
government says: Oh, we are going to 
hand you a big, fat tax increase on top 
of that, what happens? Well, you can 
take lower profits—and some of them 
certainly, I am sure, will, but inevi-
tably that gets passed on in the form of 
higher cost to the consumers, to the 
people they serve, their customers, or 
in the form of lower wages to their em-
ployees. That is what it is going to do. 
It will also make it more challenging 
for small business owners to reinvest in 
and grow their businesses. 
As I said, altogether, Democrats are 
contemplating raising taxes by $1 tril-
lion in their new Build Back Better 
tax-and-spending spree. And those tax 
hikes and their economic impacts are 
not going to be limited to small busi-
nesses, nor are they going to be limited 
to families bringing home more than 
$400,000, despite the fact that the Presi-
dent has repeatedly pledged not to 
raise taxes on families making less 
than that. 
The nonpartisan Joint Committee on 
Taxation studied the tax-and-spend 
provisions that Democrats are dis-
cussing, and its analysis shows that 
lower and middle-income taxpayers 
will face significant hits from the pro-
posed tax hikes. 
The Joint Committee on Taxation 
analysis—again, 
bipartisan, 
non-
partisan organization studies the im-
plications of taxing-and-spending pro-
visions on our economy and on classes 
of different people in this country— 
that JCT analysis found that more 
than half of Americans earning be-
tween $100,000 and $200,000 would see a 
tax hike next year as well as a quarter 
of Americans making between $75,000 
and $100,000 a year. 
Raising taxes on small businesses, in-
cluding passthroughs in South Dakota 
and across this country, is a reckless— 
reckless—approach to the economy. 
Mr. President, we have an economy 
that is wobbling. I just mentioned that 
the inflation numbers are historic: 9.1 
percent. We haven’t seen that kind of 
inflation since 1981, back when I was in 
college. 
We have an economy that some argue 
is already in a recession, depending on 
what ultimately the numbers are for 
the second quarter of this year. But 
some people—economists—are expect-
ing negative GDP growth for the sec-
ond quarter, which, by the clinical, 
technical definition, would put the 
country already into a recession. But 
most economists and people who study 
this suggest that there is certainly a 
likelihood of a recession within the 
next year. 
So we have the prospect of a reces-
sion. We are looking down at the possi-
bility of record inflation, coupled with 
a recession, and what do the Democrats 
want to do? Raise taxes. Raise taxes 
and grow government. Spend more. 
Flood the zone with more spending. Hit 
businesses with higher taxes, which 
will get passed on in the form of lower 
wages and higher prices. 
So the Democrats apparently are 
content with the idea of a recession. 
They almost want to seem to guar-
antee that we want to get there, and I 
am at a loss to understand any other 
reason why they would be contem-
plating increasing the tax burden on 
small 
businesses 
and 
middle-class 
Americans during an inflation crisis. 
Mr. President, Democrats tried their 
hardest last fall to double down on the 
spending strategy that helped plunge 
us into this inflation crisis in the first 
place. Mercifully—and I say ‘‘mer-
cifully,’’ and I thank God for a couple 
of discerning Democrats who saw oth-
erwise—mercifully, they failed. 
Let’s hope that common sense will 
once again prevail and the Democrats’ 
latest reckless tax-and-spending pro-
posal will come to nothing. American 
families are already suffering. They 
should not—not—have to deal with the 
economic consequences of yet another 
ill-advised piece of Democratic legisla-
tion. 
I yield the floor.

BORDER SECURITY 
Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, during 
my time in the Senate, I have spent a 
lot of time learning from folks who live 
and work along our 1,200-mile border 
with Mexico about the challenges that 
region and that border present. I have 
worked with local leaders who know 
the advantages and the challenges of 
living along an international border 
better than anyone else in the country. 
Of course, I have spoken with a number 
of Border Patrol agents—these, of 
course, are frontline law enforcement 
officers—as well as our local sheriffs 
and others, who have come face-to-face 
with human tragedy, exploitation, and 
many other forms of heartbreak and 
hardship. I have learned a great deal 
from the nongovernmental organiza-
tions—the 
so-called 
NGOs—that 
go 
above and beyond the call of duty to

care for the migrants who often arrive 
sick, abused, and malnourished. When 
it comes to border security and com-
monsense immigration policies, the 
input of these experts is invaluable. It 
is irreplaceable. 
Later this week, I will be traveling 
back home to the Rio Grande Valley 
along with a number of my Republican 
colleagues so that they, too, can learn 
from the true experts about the border 
crisis. Senator CRUZ and I are leading a 
visit to the Rio Grande Valley to re-
ceive an update on the current state of 
circumstances at the border. 
I know, with everything happening 
here in Washington, DC, and around 
the country, it is easy to lose sight of 
what is happening on the border, the 
humanitarian crisis that is occurring 
at the border, so I want to remind any-
body who is listening about what we 
have seen over the last 2 years during— 
well, actually, it is the first year and a 
half of the Biden administration. For a 
year and a half now, border commu-
nities have been overwhelmed by the 
sheer number, the volume, of migrants 
crossing the border. Since President 
Biden took office, the Border Patrol 
has encountered nearly 3 million—3 
million—people along the southwest 
border. That is almost an incomprehen-
sible figure, and it is far from the nor-
mal situation. 
Let me provide a little historical 
context. At this point during the 
Obama administration, an average of 
about 
46,000 
migrants 
were 
appre-
hended each month along the border— 
46,000 during the Obama administra-
tion. During the Trump administra-
tion, that number was cut in half to 
24,000 migrants every month. But dur-
ing the Biden administration, so far, 
that figure has skyrocketed. On aver-
age, more than 185,000 migrants cross 
our southern border every month. That 
is 71⁄2 times more than we were seeing 
just a few years ago. 
And there is no question—certainly 
in my mind—and I don’t think any ra-
tional review of the facts would lead to 
another conclusion other than that 
President Biden’s policies are the driv-
ing force for this crisis. The President 
ran on the promise of policies that 
would lead to this exact result, and we 
have heard stories from migrants who 
explicitly came to the United States 
because of the signals the Federal Gov-
ernment is sending that if you can 
make it to the border, you are going to 
be able to make it into the interior of 
the United States. 
But even though the President’s poli-
cies have encouraged many people to 
make this dangerous trip from their 
homes across the border—particularly 
in temperatures like we are encoun-
tering in Texas now, where for the last 
33 days we have seen 100-degree-plus 
temperatures—these migrants are com-
ing from their home, traversing huge 
expanses of land, and showing up at the 
border—if they do show up—as I said, 
sick, dehydrated, suffering from as-
sault. 
The fact is, if you visit Brooks Coun-
ty, TX, where Falfurrias is located, 
they have a Border Patrol checkpoint. 
What the coyotes do—that is the name 
given to the human smugglers—is they 
will transport people from the stash 
houses on this side of the border, up 
the highway, but then, before they get 
to the border checkpoint where the 
Border Patrol is, they will tell all the 
migrants to get out of the vehicle and 
here is a jug of water and maybe a 
power bar, and we will see you on the 
north side. They will have to walk 
around the checkpoint and then recon-
nect with the coyote, with the smug-
gler, on the north side. But the fact is 
that a number of these individuals 
don’t make it; they die in Brooks 
County from exposure. Certainly, the 
coyotes care nothing about humanity 
but only about money. If someone is 
sick or lame or can’t keep up, they get 
left behind to die. 
Well, it is clear, too, that this admin-
istration has failed to prepare for what 
I think most people could have pre-
dicted given the green light that the 
Biden administration has posted at the 
border welcoming anybody and every-
body who wants to come to the United 
States from anywhere in the world 
without complying with our immigra-
tion laws. When thousands of people 
are crossing the border every day, it 
overwhelms the Border Patrol’s capa-
bilities. That is part of the plan, be-
cause when thousands of people over-
whelm the Border Patrol at the border, 
many of them have to go away from 
the border for paperwork, to process 
unaccompanied children and perform 
other tasks. So they are not there 
when—guess 
what—here 
come 
the 
drugs. 
Last year alone, 108,000 Americans 
died of drug overdoses. Virtually all of 
those came across the southern border. 
The one that we are most concerned 
about now—but we are concerned about 
all 
of 
them—is 
opioids, 
synthetic 
opioids like fentanyl, which are enor-
mously powerful and have resulted in 
the death of far too many Americans. 
Part of that is because of the border 
crisis. 
Now, the drug cartels make a lot of 
money doing this. The human smug-
glers charge $5-, $10-, $15,000 a head to 
bring people across the border. This is 
a huge moneymaking criminal enter-
prise. But, in response, the Biden ad-
ministration has failed to prepare and 
failed to embrace policies that would 
deter people from making this dan-
gerous trip in the first place. 
Last fall, I visited the Del Rio Sector 
with a group of about 30 Border Patrol 
agents at their muster. That is their 
meeting right before they are deployed 
out into the field. When they were 
asked to raise their hand if they would 
be working out in the field that day pa-
trolling, not a single hand was raised. 
These men and women who would nor-
mally be out on the frontlines stopping 
dangerous 
people 
and 
drugs 
from 
sneaking across the border—they are 
filling out paperwork, they are watch-
ing unaccompanied children, and they 
are transporting migrants. 
This is part of the cartel’s plan. It 
looks like, to coin a phrase, we are 
playing checkers when they are play-
ing three-dimensional chess. The car-
tels have simply adapted their policies 
to exploit what they see as weakness at 
the border. This is a dangerous situa-
tion. If Border Patrol agents are caring 
for unaccompanied children, obviously 
they can’t patrol the frontlines. If they 
are knee-deep in paperwork, they can’t 
stop criminals and drugs from coming 
across the border. 
The chaos at the border provides an 
excellent camouflage and disguise for 
dangerous 
people 
coming 
across. 
Gangs, cartels, criminal organizations 
are paying close attention. They see 
the gaps, some of which they create 
themselves, and they are taking full 
advantage. Every day, criminals at-
tempt to sneak across our border. The 
dedicated men and women of the Bor-
der Patrol arrest a number of them if 
they can locate them. Many of them 
get away. Since October, agents have 
apprehended more than 450 gang mem-
bers. But, as we know, they are out-
numbered and overwhelmed, meaning 
that countless others slip through the 
cracks. 
According to some reports, more 
than 300,000 migrants evaded Border 
Patrol between October and the end of 
March. That is 300,000 on top of the 3 
million whom I mentioned a moment 
ago who have been encountered during 
the Biden administration. So that is 
300,000 additional who have evaded Bor-
der Patrol in just 6 months. These are 
known as ‘‘got-aways,’’ the ones Border 
Patrol sees on surveillance cameras. 
But the number could well be signifi-
cantly higher. 
The cartels and the human smugglers 
who help people illegally enter our 
country are not fools. They pay close 
attention to the rhetoric of the Presi-
dent and politicians here in Wash-
ington, and they watch television from 
their home country and see that people 
who show up at the border can by and 
large enter the country without any 
consequences. They know our immigra-
tion laws better than the average 
American, better than the average 
Member of Congress, and they know 
how to exploit them to their advan-
tage. They will flood the system in one 
area to distract the Border Patrol and 
take advantage of the security gaps. 
This is an important point. These 
cartels and criminal organizations are 
what one Border Patrol agent called 
commodity agnostic; in other words, 
they are in it for the money. If they 
can make money by smuggling—by 
trafficking in young girls or in eco-
nomic migrants or drugs, they will do 
it because that is why they exist: be-
cause of the money they derive from 
their crimes. 
As I suggested, one of the biggest 
moneymakers 
is 
drug 
trafficking.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S3250 
July 13, 2022 
Protection has seized more than 7,700 
pounds of fentanyl and more than 
120,000 pounds of methamphetamine. 
Add the other drugs—cocaine, heroin, 
and other dangerous drugs—that have 
been seized, you have 440,000 pounds of 
drugs that came into our country in 
only 8 months, and that is just the 
drugs we were able to locate and con-
fiscate. 
These criminal groups also profit off 
the backs of migrants. Again, to them, 
a migrant is not a human being. It is a 
commodity; it is a moneymaker, a way 
to wring a dollar out of somebody 
else’s misery. 
And a couple of weeks ago, we re-
ceived a tragic reminder of how ruth-
less these criminals are. Smugglers 
abandoned 
a 
tractor-trailer 
packed 
with migrants in San Antonio, my 
hometown, leaving the truck to bake 
in the Texas heat. Fifty-three migrants 
died in what has been described as the 
deadliest human smuggling incident in 
U.S. history. It is a devastating re-
minder that this isn’t about politics. 
Lives are actually on the line. 
President Biden has talked about the 
need to treat immigrants humanely. I 
agree. This isn’t about treating them 
inhumanely, but 53 migrants dying in 
the back of a tractor-trailer rig in 100- 
degree Texas temperature is not hu-
mane either. 
Migrants are dying. Drugs are pour-
ing into our country. And all the while, 
these criminal organizations are get-
ting richer and richer. 
I don’t know how President Biden 
and Vice President HARRIS look in the 
mirror knowing that this is happening 
on their watch. I do know that Presi-
dent Biden and Vice President HARRIS 
have not been down to the border and 
talked to the same experts that I have 
learned from over the years. I think 
they would learn a lot. I would wel-
come them if they decided to come. 
Instead, the President has sent a sig-
nal to the cartels and human smug-
glers that they can continue to abuse, 
rape, and get rich off of vulnerable mi-
grants. We have even seen some in the 
administration villainize the dedicated 
law enforcement officers who are try-
ing to keep our communities and our 
countries safe. And despite the record-
breaking levels of migration, we know 
the President still refuses to visit the 
border. 
He is in the Middle East. He is vis-
iting Muhammad bin Salman and other 
officials in Israel and elsewhere, but he 
won’t go to the border where this crisis 
is happening, in large part because of 
his failed policies. 
As I have said, throughout my time 
in the Senate, I have learned a lot from 
these dedicated leaders in border com-
munities who deal with this crisis first-
hand. Their input has been invaluable 
to my work in the Senate. And I look 
forward to seeing some of these folks 
later this week and introducing them 
to a number of our Senate colleagues. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from North Carolina. 
Mr. TILLIS. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that I be allowed to 
speak for up to 5 minutes prior to the 
scheduled votes. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
Hearing none, without objection. 
SOCIAL MEDIA 
Mr. TILLIS. Mr. President, I will be 
brief. But I do want to talk about a se-
rious subject. You know, 30 years ago, 
we wouldn’t have been talking about 
email or social media or other things 
that we now rely on to receive commu-
nications, to be informed on political 
choices, and to potentially even sup-
port candidates that we want to sup-
port. But the reality is, today, we all 
have two or three email accounts, 
probably most of them based on Gmail. 
We 
have 
got 
access 
to 
Twitter, 
Instagram, Facebook—a number of so-
cial media platforms. And I have a con-
cern that maybe it is not a level play-
ing field for political views. 
We have always had that argument, 
but recently NC State issued a report 
that seems to find that—particularly 
with Gmail—we have an imbalance be-
tween how information is dissemi-
nated, how candidates are able to reach 
out for support. What the study found 
is a potential political bias against Re-
publicans in favor of Democratic can-
didates. 
Now, I am a technology person, and I 
think my staff called me a bit of a 
nerd. I have been in technology for al-
most 40 years. I am not willing to jump 
to the conclusion that Google has nec-
essarily created a strategy for benefit-
ting Democrats over Republicans, but a 
study seems to suggest that there are 
legitimate questions that need to be 
answered. 
I, for one, don’t think any platform 
should favor either policy. I think 
more speech, more access is better; 
more informed voters, more people par-
ticipating in elections. But the study 
seems to suggest that there is a bias in 
the way that we receive our informa-
tion through Gmail. 
I joined a letter with Senator DAINES 
to say: Take a look at that report, take 
a look at your operations, and give us 
your response to the assertions in the 
report. 
I know that this is very important 
for the future of elections, for the fu-
ture of participation in elections. And, 
again, I don’t want a platform that bi-
ases itself toward conservatives any 
more than I want one that biases itself 
towards liberals. But I did have an op-
portunity to talk with technologists at 
Google, who dismissed the report. But 
that is not enough. The report has find-
ings. And I think—in this case Google, 
but there are other platforms we can 
ask the same question. 
Incidentally, Twitter 2 months ago 
informed me that I was not who I said 
I was, so they suspended my account. I 
tried to go through an appeal process 
and finally just decided I don’t need 
that Twitter account. I am wondering 
if that was a result of an algorithm or 
the result of somebody in Twitter who 
didn’t like what I had to say about my 
mother and my wife and my kids on 
my Twitter account because I happen 
to have an official account that, for 
some reason, it is OK. 
We have got to get this straightened 
up, and Google can help us start by 
taking a look at the findings in this re-
port and providing us hard answers for 
it and identifying others who may ac-
tually be responsible for the outcomes 
that we are, at this point, assuming are 
the responsibility of Google. 
I think it is very important for us to 
go through the report, give us the in-
formation we need because we may find 
out that Google is, in fact, not respon-
sible for what some of my colleagues 
believe is the vast majority of appeals 
from conservatives going into their 
spam filter and never being reached. 
There may be other reasons. We al-
ready know that Russia, China, other 
state actors influence public opinion in 
the United States through their views 
and exploitation of social platforms. 
So the reason I come to the floor 
today is to basically reassert what I 
did in the letter to Google. Do the 
homework. Prove to us that there are 
no operations or conscious decisions 
made by the management or individ-
uals in the organization to actually 
bias towards one ideology or the other. 
I need that information so that we can 
figure out how we can have more 
speech and more engagement in the po-
litical process. 
But I will say this: If there is any so-
cial media platform that has an em-
ployee or an organization that is bi-
ased, those folks should no longer be 
working for those platforms. And if I 
find any evidence to that effect, I will 
be pursuing it aggressively. But I come 
to the floor to encourage Google to do 
the homework, know that I will be ob-
jective. And I would like to get a re-
sponse soon.

HIGHLAND PARK SHOOTING 
Mr. President, earlier this week, I in-
troduced the Senate and those who fol-
low our proceedings to an 8-year-old 
boy who lives in Highland Park, IL. His 
name is Cooper Roberts. He is a twin. 
His twin brother’s name is Luke. 
Cooper and Luke and Mom and Dad 
decided a few days ago—last weekend, 
as a matter of fact—to attend the 
Fourth of July parade in Highland 
Park. It was a natural choice: beautiful 
day, salute to our country, a parade 
passing by, American flags, in one of 
the nicest communities in the State of 
Illinois. 
We all know what happened that day: 
A shooter took an assault-style weapon 
to the roof of a downtown business and, 
in a matter of a minute or two, dis-
charged 90 rounds into the crowd. As a 
result of that gunfire, Cooper Roberts, 
this 8-year-old boy, was left paralyzed 
after being shot in the Highland Park 
Fourth of July parade mass shooting. 
He has undergone a series of surgeries 
since. 
I tell this story on the floor of the 
Senate for two reasons: The family has 
spoken to the press and been open 
about Cooper’s struggle, and I am glad 
they have because he has a cheering 
section now that has reached far be-
yond Illinois and is around the Nation, 
and secondly, because this poor little 
boy’s situation is a reflection on what 
assault rifles can do to the human 
body. 
I am not an expert on firearms. I 
don’t pretend to be. But I watch pro-
grams and have read a lot on the sub-
ject, and I know that the assault ri-
fles—the AR–15 and those in that same 
class—are not your ordinary firearms. 
They discharge their bullets and am-
munition at two to three times the ve-
locity of an ordinary firearm, and when 
that ammunition hits the body of a 
person, it starts tumbling and tearing 
apart the body as it goes through. 
Cooper, this 8-year-old boy, had his 
spinal cord severed by a bullet, leaving 
him paralyzed from the waist down. 
Sadly, the family reported yesterday 
that he is back in critical condition at 
the University of Chicago’s Comer 
Children’s Hospital. He showed some 
improvement last Friday, but things 
are not going well—at least they 
weren’t yesterday, according to his 
family. 
The bullet which entered this little 
boy’s abdomen injured his liver, his ab-
dominal aorta, and his esophagus near 
his stomach. A hole in the esophagus 
was sewn shut by surgery, the family 
has said. Well, they reported yesterday 
that Cooper’s esophagus has reopened,

in a written update. As a result, he is 
facing an urgent, complex, and lengthy 
surgery today to again attempt to re-
pair his torn esophagus. This will be 
his seventh surgery since last Fourth 
of July, and it is particularly high risk 
given his age and his current condition. 
By Tuesday evening, the family pro-
vided additional updates, saying the 
doctors were able to find and close the 
leak in his esophagus. ‘‘This is a good 
outcome—Cooper is still fighting,’’ the 
family said. The next few days will be 
critical. 
One of Cooper’s lungs is partially col-
lapsed, according to the family. His 
heart rate is elevated, and he is spiking 
a fever due to a new infection and com-
plications he must face. 
Cooper was one of dozens of people 
shot at the parade. Seven have died. An 
individual is being held on murder 
charges in the mass shooting. Cooper 
and others in Highland Park were shot 
with a military-style Smith & Wesson 
M&P 15 semiautomatic rifle. For those 
who weren’t aware, ‘‘M&P’’ in the 
name of this rifle suggests it is for 
military and police use. But it was pur-
chased by the individual charged with 
these murders, who was neither a mem-
ber of the military nor police. 
In an interview with WGN-TV in Chi-
cago, Dr. Ana Velez-Rosborough, a 
trauma surgeon who is treating Cooper 
at Highland Park Hospital, said the in-
juries 
were 
‘‘devastating,’’ 
in 
her 
words. 
‘‘They 
create 
very 
large 
wounds,’’ Velez-Rosborough told the 
station. ‘‘They basically destroy or-
gans. They destroy soft tissue. They 
destroy bone.’’ 
Cooper received what we call a mas-
sive transfusion—enormous amount of 
blood—in order to keep him alive dur-
ing the operation. The boy’s aorta in-
jury was so severe that a portion of it 
was removed and replaced with a syn-
thetic graft, according to the family. 
The family is praying for a miracle 
that this little boy survives. We should 
join them in that prayer, but we need 
to go beyond that. 
Yesterday, Senator DUCKWORTH and I 
had a meeting with residents from 
Highland Park who, on their own, spon-
taneously came to Washington to plead 
with Congress to do something about 
these military-style weapons that are 
being sold in the United States and did 
such devastating damage to this beau-
tiful little boy. Joining those from 
Highland Park was a group from 
Uvalde, TX. They certainly know this 
story individually and personally. They 
lost 19 kids at their grade school. They 
came in with pictures of prayer cards 
from the funeral parlors. The point 
they were making to us and to every-
one is that this is madness. To allow 
individuals to have this type of weapon 
who are not members of the military, 
not policemen, and to use these weap-
ons on other Americans is unthinkable. 
What in the world is America think-
ing to believe this has something to do 
with a constitutional right? A con-
stitutional right? What were Cooper’s 
constitutional rights to go to a parade 
on the Fourth of July in Highland Park 
and come home safely? Where was the 
respect for them? And, of course, when 
you are discharging 90 rounds into a 
crowd, it is a wonder even more people 
weren’t injured. 
I bring this to the attention of the 
Senate because—I raised it earlier in 
the week—I think it is time for us to 
focus on the reality of mass shooting in 
America. While this was going on in 
Highland Park, that same weekend, 
dozens were being shot and some killed 
in the city of Chicago and cities across 
America. 
It is impossible for me to believe that 
we can do nothing to deal with this. 
The families from Highland Park and 
Uvalde, TX, were shaking their heads 
as I explained to them the problems 
with the filibuster rules in the Senate. 
Do you think a filibuster rule makes 
any difference to the family of this 
wonderful little boy? They couldn’t 
care less about the rules of the Senate 
and wonder why the Congress can’t re-
spond to this clear and present danger 
in our streets that has resulted in over 
300 mass shootings this year so far— 
sadly, more to come. 
I said before when I came to the 
floor, when I left for the Fourth of July 
recess, I had no idea that I was going to 
personally 
join 
this 
fraternity 
of 
grief—Senators and Congressmen from 
cities and towns all across America— 
who have endured these mass shoot-
ings, who then have to sit down with 
families in tears and explain to them 
why their Congressman and their Sen-
ator can do nothing. 
Well, I refuse to accept that. I believe 
that we can do something. We came to 
our senses to pass a gun safety bill 
after Uvalde. I voted for it. It didn’t 
touch the issue of these military weap-
ons per se, although it did call for deep-
er background checks for those under 
the age of 21. 
I support that, but let’s go further 
and be honest about this. There is no 
need for anyone to own this military- 
style weapon, and for it to be sold to 
the average individual, who has no 
training whatsoever on the weapon to 
prove that he is eligible to own it and 
who can use this weapon under these 
circumstances which cannot be con-
trolled, is unacceptable. 
What would our argument be if some-
one said: I want to buy a grenade 
launcher. 
I 
think 
I 
have 
Second 
Amendment rights to own one. 
We would say to him: That is ridicu-
lous. Grenades are for war. 
Well, these military weapons are for 
war as well, and I don’t believe they 
should be sold in this country. I believe 
the military assault weapon ban that I 
voted for in 1994 was the right thing to 
do. It was a 10-year ban. We should 
have extended it. During the period of 
that ban on assault weapons, there was 
a lot of controversy, but there were far 
fewer deaths from mass shootings. It is 
an indication of the truth of this issue. 
I hope that we continue to tell the 
story of the victims and their families 
so that our colleagues in the Senate of 
both political parties will come to un-
derstand it is time for us to step up, ac-
cept our responsibilities of office, and 
protect children like Cooper Roberts. 
(Ms. ROSEN assumed the Chair.) 
FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION 
Madam President, the Food and Drug 
Administration of the United States is 
one of the most important Agencies. It 
is not one of the largest, but it has the 
responsibility to determine the safety 
and effectiveness of more products 
than most Americans can imagine. 
I have been a big fan of the Food and 
Drug Administration in the years that 
I have served in Congress. I have seen 
some wonderful things happen there. 
They are the ones who decide whether 
drugs are safe and effective before they 
can be sold in America, and they have 
regulatory authority over so many dif-
ferent issues. 
But it is sad to say the Food and 
Drug Administration of the United 
States of America today is at a cross-
roads. In fact, it may be in free fall. 
The Agency’s missteps, its close con-
nection with the industries it regu-
lates, its delayed response to formula 
safety and decisions that fuel the 
opioid epidemic have shaken public 
confidence 
and 
endangered 
public 
health. But the FDA’s ongoing incom-
petence and failure to regulate tobacco 
products stands in its own distinctive, 
grim category. 
Last month, the Food and Drug Ad-
ministration announced a long-awaited 
decision to remove all e-cigarettes pro-
duced by the JUUL company from the 
market after 2 years of scientific re-
view of data that had been submitted 
by the company JUUL to the Food and 
Drug Administration. Numerous health 
studies have determined that JUUL is 
one of the most popular e-cigarettes 
used by children. 
Let’s get down to the bottom line. 
When the tobacco companies found 
their cigarettes falling into disfavor, 
they needed a replacement product. 
Their marketing proposal and strategy 
has always been: addict children. They 
did it with cigarettes. They did it with 
tobacco products, whether they were 
spit tobacco or smoking products, and, 
unfortunately, millions of Americans— 
particularly children—became addicted 
to their products. 
When those tobacco products fell out 
of favor, the industry needed a new re-
placement. They found one in vaping 
and e-cigarettes. Today, at least 2 mil-
lion American kids are hooked on e- 
cigarettes and vaping. If you don’t be-
lieve me, ask a student in high school 
or middle school what is going on with 
vaping, and you are going to be told 
the grim reality. 
Numerous 
Federal 
health 
studies 
have determined that JUUL is among 
the most popular e-cigarettes used by 
kids in America. More than 2 million 
children in America are using them, in-
cluding 750,000 kids who picked up 
these addictive products in the 9 
months since the Food and Drug Ad-
ministration missed a court-ordered

deadline to regulate their products. 
That is right. The court ordered the 
Food and Drug Administration to regu-
late 
these 
products, 
and, 
unfortu-
nately, for 9 months the FDA refused 
to do it. 
To put a new tobacco product on the 
market, an e-cigarette company has 
the burden to prove to the Food and 
Drug Administration that it is ‘‘appro-
priate for the protection of public 
health’’ before they could put the prod-
uct on the market. That is the law. It 
makes sense. You can’t sell a tobacco 
product in America at this point with-
out FDA authorization. And that is 
what the authorization requires. It has 
to be appropriate for the protection of 
public health. Tobacco products can’t 
prove that, neither can e-cigarettes. 
But FDA and JUUL ignored this law 
for years as JUUL sold its products 
without FDA authorization. 
I was relieved when FDA finally an-
nounced it was going to ban JUUL’s ad-
dictive, kid-friendly products after de-
termining that the company could not 
prove they presented a public health 
benefit. 
For anyone who has spoken to a teen-
ager, parent, or teacher in the last 5 
years and seen the powerful addiction 
to nicotine that JUUL causes, FDA’s 
finding makes sense. So imagine my 
surprise when after FDA Commissioner 
Califf called to tell me the good news, 
the Agency a few days later suddenly 
reversed course. Not 2 weeks after or-
dering JUUL off the market, the FDA 
backtracked and halted its own deci-
sion. 
JUUL sued the FDA. Well, you ex-
pect that. These tobacco companies 
have more lawyers than sense. Big To-
bacco loves nothing more than lawsuits 
to preserve its ability to addict chil-
dren to their products. Now, FDA and 
JUUL have jointly asked the DC Cir-
cuit Court to suspend the litigation 
now pending on their products while 
the FDA resumes its regulatory review. 
But here is what baffled me. Health 
experts and parents across America 
wonder, Why is FDA in a legal free fall 
at this moment? One day they are ban-
ning the product. A week later they are 
putting them back on the market. 
When we need the Agency the most, it 
is proven to be adrift. And lives are at 
stake. 
JUUL is now free to continue selling 
its deadly products again, and FDA has 
not stated how long they are going to 
suspend this litigation while they re-
view information. 
FDA has a choice: rely on science and 
public health to protect America’s kids 
or cower to Big Tobacco’s lawyers. 
Adding to the chaos on Friday—listen 
to this—we learned that the FDA is ne-
glecting to enforce still another part of 
the law, which I passed this spring, 
that clarified the authority to cover 
synthetic nicotine. 
The tobacco companies thought they 
had found an escape hatch. They 
wouldn’t have to justify their products 
if the nicotine wasn’t derived from to-
bacco but was derived from a synthetic 
source. We changed the law and made 
it clear that was not going to be a loop-
hole. 
FDA sounded the alarm over this 
emerging public health challenge of e- 
cigarette companies trying to evade 
oversight, including the No. 1 e-ciga-
rette used by children today. It is 
called Puff Bar. FDA has another dead-
line today to clear the market of unau-
thorized 
synthetic 
nicotine 
e-ciga-
rettes, and I hope the Agency doesn’t 
repeat its history of failed enforce-
ment. 
The FDA is a cop on a beat. They are 
supposed to protect all Americans and 
our children, in particular. They know 
there is a product on the market that 
is addictive to kids and leads them into 
a tobacco addiction. That product is e- 
cigarettes and vaping. The law says 
you can’t sell the product until you 
prove it is effective for public health. 
The tobacco companies could never 
prove that, but yet the FDA allows 
them to continue to sell the product, 
to ignore the law, to ignore the court 
order and does nothing. 
I don’t know what it takes. I am call-
ing on the FDA to finally come to its 
senses. If you are going to err, err on 
the side of public health and public 
safety, err on the side of kids, not to-
bacco companies. 
This free fall in the legal department 
at the FDA is unimaginable. It is not 
safe for America, and it is not safe for 
our future. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Vermont. 
USICA 
Mr. SANDERS. Madam President, at 
a time of massive income and wealth 
inequality, the American people are 
sick and tired of the unprecedented 
level of corporate greed that we are 
seeing right now. The American people 
are sick and tired of paying out-
rageously high prices at the gas pump 
and at the grocery store while at the 
same time oil companies and food com-
panies are making recordbreaking prof-
its. 
The American people are sick and 
tired of struggling to pay for the basic 
necessities of life while at the same 
time 700 billionaires in this country be-
came $2 trillion richer during the pan-
demic. And income and wealth inequal-
ity today is worse than it has been for 
100 years—people on top doing phe-
nomenally well, middle class working 
families fall further and further be-
hind. 
The American people are sick and 
tired of seeing multibillionaires, like 
Mr. Musk and Mr. Bezos and Mr. 
Branson, taking joyrides to outer space 
in their spaceships, buying $500 million 
superyachts, and living in mansions all 
over the world while some 600,000 peo-
ple in our country are homeless. In 
other words, we are looking at two 
worlds. People on top never did better, 
middle class is continuing to decline, 
and the poor are living in abysmal con-
ditions. 
And in the midst of all of this, the 
American people want Congress, want 
their elected officials, to address cor-
porate greed, to address income and 
wealth inequality, and end a tax sys-
tem in which some of the wealthiest 
people in this country in a given year 
do not pay a nickel in Federal taxes, 
where large, profitable corporations do 
not pay a nickel in Federal taxes. And 
they want a tax system which is fair, 
where the wealthy and large corpora-
tions pay their fair share. 
The last poll that I saw had Con-
gress—the U.S. Congress—with a 16- 
percent approval rating—16 percent. 
And to me, this was shocking, really 
quite shocking, because I suspect that 
the 16 percent who believe that Con-
gress was doing something meaningful 
really don’t know what is going on. 
So what is Congress doing right now 
at a time in which we face so many 
massive problems, not to mention cli-
mate change, not to mention a massive 
housing crisis where 18 million families 
are paying half of their income in hous-
ing, not to mention the student debt 
that 45 million Americans are car-
rying? What is Congress about? What 
are we working on right this minute? 
And the answer is that for 2 months, a 
107-member conference committee has 
been meeting behind closed doors to 
provide over $50 billion in corporate 
welfare, with no strings attached, to 
the highly profitable microchip indus-
try. 
No, 
we 
are 
not 
talking 
about 
healthcare for all. No, we are not talk-
ing about making higher education af-
fordable. No, we are not talking about 
making sure that young people can 
earn decent salaries when they become 
teachers. No, we are not talking about 
leading the world in combating climate 
change. We are talking about giving $50 
billion in corporate welfare, with no 
strings attached, a blank check, to the 
highly profitable microchip industry. 
And, yes, if you can believe it—and I 
am talking to the 16 percent of Ameri-
cans who have a favorable opinion of 
Congress—if you can believe it, this 
legislation may also provide a $10 bil-
lion bailout to Jeff Bezos, the second 
wealthiest person in America, so that 
his company Blue Origin can launch a 
rocket ship to the Moon. 
For all of my colleagues who tell us 
how deeply, deeply concerned they are 
about the deficit—oh, my goodness, we 
cannot help working families with a 
child tax credit; we cannot expand 
Medicare to cover dental and hearing 
aids and eyeglasses; we can’t build the 
affordable housing; Bernie, we don’t 
have the money to do that; we have a 
big deficit—well, what about the def-
icit when it comes to giving $52 billion 
in corporate welfare to some of the 
most profitable corporations in Amer-
ica? I guess, when you are giving cor-
porate welfare to big and powerful in-
terests, the deficit no longer matters. 
There is no doubt in my mind that 
there is a global shortage in microchips 
and semiconductors, which is making

it harder for manufacturers to produce 
the automobiles and cell phones and 
the electronic equipment that we need. 
This shortage is costing American 
workers good jobs and raising prices 
for families. I don’t think there is a de-
bate about that reality, which is why 
I—and I think many other others here 
in the Senate—fully support efforts to 
expand U.S. microchip production. 
But the question that we should be 
asking is this. Should American tax-
payers provide the microchip industry 
with a blank check of over $50 billion 
at a time when semiconductor compa-
nies are making tens of billions of dol-
lars in profits and paying their execu-
tives exorbitant compensation pack-
ages? My answer to that question, and 
I think the American people’s answer 
to that question, is a resounding no. 
Let’s review some recent history 
about the microchip industry, which I 
do not hear discussed very often here 
on the floor. Over the last 20 years, the 
microchip industry has shut down—has 
shut down—over 780 manufacturing 
plants in the United States. It shut 
down over 780 manufacturing plants in 
the 
United 
States 
and 
eliminated 
150,000 American jobs while moving 
most of their production overseas after 
receiving some $91.5 billion in govern-
ment subsidies and loans. Got that? 
They have shut down over 780 plants, 
thrown 150,000 American workers out 
on the street as they have gone abroad. 
In other words, in order to make more 
profits, these companies took govern-
ment money and used that money to 
ship good-paying jobs abroad. 
And what are we doing about that? 
You shut down plants in America; you 
jeopardize 
the 
production 
of 
microchips here in America; you throw 
150,000 workers out on the street; and 
what is our response? Hey, here is $52 
billion. Thank you very much for your 
patriotism and your respect for Amer-
ican workers. 
Now, that approach may make sense 
to some people, maybe people who got 
a lot of money from the microchip in-
dustry in campaign contributions. I 
don’t know. But it sure as hell does not 
make sense to me. In total, it has been 
estimated that five major semicon-
ductor companies will receive the 
lion’s share of this taxpayer handout. 
Those companies are Intel, Texas In-
struments, 
Micron 
Technology, 
GlobalFoundries, and Samsung. 
These five companies, my friends, 
made $70 billion in profits last year. So 
if you are a worker in America trying 
to get by on $12, $13 an hour, nothing 
we can do for you. If you can’t afford 
the outrageous cost of healthcare in 
America, can’t do anything for you. 
Can’t buy the prescription drugs that 
your doctor prescribes because they are 
too expensive? Can’t do anything for 
you. But if you are an industry where 
the top five companies made $70 billion 
in profits last year, well, we have some 
good news for you. Keep the campaign 
contributions coming. We are there for 
you, and we are going to give you a $52 
billion handout. 
The company that will likely benefit 
the most from this taxpayer assistance 
is Intel. I have nothing against Intel. I 
wish them the best. But let’s be clear. 
Intel is not a poor, struggling com-
pany. It is not a company which is 
going broke. In 2021, last year, Intel 
made nearly $20 billion in profits. That 
is not a bad year, $20 billion in profits. 
During the pandemic, Intel had enough 
money to spend $16.6 billion not on re-
search and development, not on start-
ing new plants in America but on buy-
ing back its own stock to reward its ex-
ecutives 
and 
wealthy 
shareholders. 
That is what Intel did with its $20 bil-
lion in profits. 
Last year, Intel could afford to give 
its CEO, Pat Gelsinger, a $179 million 
compensation 
package—$179 
million 
compensation 
package. 
Does 
that 
sound like a company that needs a cor-
porate bailout, that needs taxpayer 
money to survive? 
Over the past 20 years, Intel has 
spent over $100 million on lobbying and 
campaign contributions—that is the 
definition of the corrupt political sys-
tem under which we live—while at the 
same time shipping thousands of jobs 
to China and other low-income coun-
tries. And that is a company that the 
American people should be bailing out, 
really? 
Another company that would receive 
taxpayer assistance under this legisla-
tion is Texas Instruments. Last year, 
Texas Instruments made $7.8 billion in 
profits. In 2020, that company spent $2.5 
billion buying back its own stock while 
it also, like Intel, has outsourced thou-
sands of good-paying American jobs to 
low-wage countries. 
Who else is in line to receive cor-
porate welfare under this bill? Well, 
how about the Taiwan Semiconductor 
Manufacturing Company, TSMC? It is 
in line to potentially receive billions of 
dollars in Federal grants under this 
bill. It might be interesting to note 
who the largest shareholder of TSMC 
is. Well, if you guessed the Government 
of Taiwan, you would be correct, which 
should come as no surprise to anybody 
who 
studies 
how 
other 
countries 
throughout the world conduct indus-
trial policy. Let us be clear. When we 
provide TSMC money, we are giving 
that taxpayer money directly to the 
Government of Taiwan. 
Samsung, another very large cor-
porate entity from South Korea, is also 
in line to receive Federal funding 
under this bill. In other words, not only 
would this bill be providing corporate 
welfare to profitable American cor-
porations, but we would literally be 
handing over U.S. taxpayer dollars to 
corporations that are owned or con-
trolled by other nations. And on and on 
it goes. 
Let me be very clear. I believe in in-
dustrial policy. I do. I believe that it 
makes sense, on certain occasions, for 
the Federal Government and the pri-
vate sector to work together to address 
a pressing need in America, to sit down 
and say: OK. You want to make some 
money. We have national needs that 
have to be addressed. How do we work 
well together so that you as a corpora-
tion do OK and so that taxpayers of 
this country do OK? That is called sen-
sible industrial policy. 
Industrial policy means cooperation 
between the government and private 
sector—cooperation. It does not mean 
the 
government 
providing 
massive 
amounts of corporate welfare to profit-
able corporations without getting any-
thing in return. That is not industrial 
policy. That is just giving the money 
to large, profitable corporations that 
make a lot of campaign contributions. 
The question is, Will the U.S. Gov-
ernment develop an industrial policy 
that benefits all of our people or will 
we continue to have an industrial pol-
icy that benefits the wealthy and the 
powerful? 
In 1968, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., 
said: 
The problem is that we all too often have 
socialism for the rich and rugged free enter-
prise capitalism for the poor. 
I am afraid that what Dr. King said 
54 years ago was accurate back then, 
and it is even more accurate today. 
We hear a lot of talk in the Halls of 
Congress about the need to create pub-
lic-private partnerships, and that all 
sounds very nice. But when the govern-
ment adopts an industrial policy that 
socializes all of the risk and privatizes 
all of the profits, that is not a partner-
ship; that is crony capitalism. 
Some of my colleagues make a point 
that the microchip industry is enor-
mously important for our economy and 
that we must become less dependent on 
foreign nations for microchips. I agree. 
There is no argument about that. But 
we can and must accomplish that goal 
without simply throwing money at 
these companies while the taxpayer 
gets nothing in return. In my view, we 
must 
prevent 
microchip 
companies 
from receiving taxpayer assistance un-
less they agree to issue warrants or eq-
uity stakes to the Federal Govern-
ment. 
If private companies are going to 
benefit from generous taxpayer sub-
sidies, the financial gains made by 
these companies must be shared with 
the American people, not just wealthy 
shareholders. That is what a real part-
nership—private-public partnership—is 
about. In other words, if microchip 
companies make a profit as a direct re-
sult of these Federal grants, the tax-
payers of this country have a right to 
get a reasonable return on that invest-
ment. 
Further, if microchip companies re-
ceive taxpayer assistance, they must 
agree that they will not buy back their 
own stock, outsource American jobs, 
repeal existing collective bargaining 
agreements, and must remain neutral 
in any union organizing effort. This is 
not a radical idea. In fact, all of these 
conditions were imposed on companies 
that received taxpayer assistance dur-
ing the pandemic and passed the Sen-
ate by a vote of 96 to 0. These are not 
radical demands.

Moreover, I know this may be a rad-

hind, should not see their taxpayer dol-
lars go to the second wealthiest person 
in America. Radical idea, I know, but 
that is my view. Mr. Bezos is worth 
some $138 billion. He became $33 billion 
richer during the pandemic, and in a 
given year, Mr. Bezos has paid nothing 
in Federal income taxes because he and 
his friends write a tax system that ben-
efits the wealthy. 
I say to Mr. Bezos, if he wants to go 
to the Moon, let him go to the Moon. 
That is OK. But he should do it on his 
own dime, not that of the U.S. tax-
payers. 
This is where we are. This country 
faces enormous issues. We are not deal-
ing with those issues. Instead, we are 
talking about a massive bailout for 
profitable corporations and a $10 bil-
lion check for the second wealthiest 
guy in this country. I would hope that 
Members of Congress listen to the 
American people, stand up for the 
working class and the middle class of 
this country and not give a massive 
amount of corporate welfare to people 
who don’t need it. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Iowa. 
BIDEN ADMINISTRATION 
Ms. ERNST. Madam President, 200 
years ago, the Senate went about their 
business without computers, without 
cell phones, and any of our other mod-
ern conveniences that run on elec-
tricity, including the very lights in 
this room. Working by candlelight 
might sound quaint today, but many 
Americans may find themselves doing 
just that in the not too distant future 
because the Biden administration is 
taking the country back to the era of 
no electricity. 
Folks, with President Biden and his 
same team of advisers who created a 
nationwide baby formula shortage and 
out-of-control 
inflation 
overseeing 
their ‘‘energy transition,’’ what could 
possibly go wrong? You don’t have to 
look any further than your energy bills 
to get an answer. 
Prices at the pump have nearly dou-
bled since Biden’s first day in office 
when he started signing Executive or-
ders to turn off American energy sup-
plies. And home electricity prices have 
increased more than 20 percent since 
just last summer. What is worse than 
these expensive energy bills? Well, 
folks, how about no power at all? Most 
of the Nation is currently in danger of 
experiencing power outages due to en-
ergy shortages caused by the closure of 
power plants as part of the Democrats’ 
push towards renewables. These Biden 
blackouts will make it impossible to 
even run fans and air conditioners on 
the hottest days of the summer. 
But not to worry, folks, Biden’s En-
ergy Department has issued some tips 
of what to do in case of an outage, 
which include stocking up on candles, 
keeping an ice chest on hand, and hav-
ing a gallon of water available for 
every person in your house for each 
day you are without electricity. 
Folks, that is not the most reas-
suring advice since no one knows how 
many days we could be kept in the 
dark during a Biden blackout. 
The reality is these power outages 
pose a bigger problem than just the in-
convenience of being uncomfortably 
warm or unable to watch TV for a few 
hours or possibly days. 
Extended outages could be a matter 
of life or death for many folks who de-
pend upon electronic medical devices 
or temperature-sensitive medicines. 
You are probably wondering how it is 
even possible in 2022 for there to be an 
energy shortage right here in the 
United States of America. It is simple 
math: Democratic policies. 
The ongoing closure of traditional 
power plants is reducing our capacity 
to supply enough electricity for mil-
lions of homes and renewables are not 
yet producing enough energy on their 
own to make up the difference. 
The Democrats are predictably blam-
ing global warming, but the truth is 
the rolling blackouts and rising prices 
are really being caused by man-made 
energy change. Just this year, the 
Biden administration has reduced do-
mestic oil and gas leasing, created reg-
ulatory barriers for building pipelines, 
and taken administrative actions that 
put hundreds of solar energy projects 
across the U.S. on hold. 
We can’t just turn off the power 
sources we depend upon without having 
reliable, abundant, and affordable al-
ternatives readily available. Yet that 
is exactly what the Democrats, at 
President Biden’s direction, are doing. 
I am proud that my home State of 
Iowa was the first State in the Nation 
to adopt a renewable portfolio standard 
nearly 40 years ago. 
Today, Iowa generates most of our 
energy from renewables, with wind 
power being our primary source. Iowa 
also leads the Nation in the production 
of ethanol and biodiesel. And despite 
what critics say, the use of corn eth-
anol and soybean biodiesel reduce 
greenhouse gas emissions while helping 
to keep our Nation energy independent 
and our State green and clean. 
However, 
renewables 
still 
only 
produce a fraction of the total elec-
tricity the Nation relies on to run, 
making it impossible and irresponsible 
to simply unplug our traditional en-
ergy sources. 
Just look at California, which has set 
a goal of achieving a carbon-free power 
grid. The State is forecasting that en-
ergy shortages could leave as many as 
4 million California residents without 
power this summer. 
The State’s utility provider wants to 
build five new fossil-fuel power genera-
tors to ensure the availability of reli-
able electricity in the future. But the 
challenge is more than just making up 
for the reduction in power production 
because the transition to renewables is 
creating new demands for electricity. 
For example, our increasingly unreli-
able power grid will face even greater 
strains as more and more electric vehi-
cles are plugged into it. To drive just 
100 miles, an EV requires about the 
same amount of electricity as it takes 
to run a home for an entire day, includ-
ing 
lights, 
heating 
and 
air-condi-
tioning, and appliances. Tesla, the 
world’s top EV carmaker, is already 
asking EV owners to not charge their 
cars during certain hours of the day to 
better ration the use of electricity. 
And while President Biden and the 
Democrats keep telling Americans to 
buy an electric vehicle to cut down on 
the cost of gas, the high sticker price 
makes EVs unaffordable. 
Folks, the cold, hard truth is electric 
vehicles are not as economical, envi-
ronmental, or ethical as the Democrats 
want us to believe. Proponents of the 
Green New Deal portray themselves as 
heroes in a fairy tale riding to the res-
cue—on an EV, of course—to defeat the 
greedy corporations polluting the plan-
et for profit so we can all live happily 
ever after. But the truth is it ain’t that 
easy being green. 
Consider the component parts used in 
both EVs and solar panels. Well, they 
are largely produced by Communist 
China’s State-supported corporations, 
often using slave and child labor. 
As a result, the world will be more 
dependent on Communist China for 
some energy products in a post-carbon 
economy than we are on OPEC for pe-
troleum today. 
President Biden’s own Energy De-
partment 
admits 
that 
‘‘U.S. 
decarbonization goals are reliant on 
both Chinese firms and the Chinese 
government.’’ 
And while we will rely on China for 
the technology, the communist regime 
will rely more heavily on the forced 
labor 
of 
children 
and 
modern-day 
slaves to produce it. Consider, almost 
half of the world supply of polysilicon 
used in solar panels is made in Com-
munist China, often by the hands of 
forced labor of ethnic and religious mi-
norities. And nearly every silicon- 
based solar panel is likely to contain 
components that originated in the area 
of China where forced labor camps are 
widespread. China also has significant 
financial control over the world’s sup-
ply of cobalt, which is an essential ele-
ment used in the batteries of EVs. 
The Congo produces 70 percent of the 
world’s 
cobalt, 
and 
Chinese-backed 
companies own or have a financial in-
terest in most of the African nation’s 
cobalt mines. These Chinese corpora-
tions are subjecting the miners to 
physical abuse and hazardous condi-
tions 
in 
exchange 
for 
very 
little 
money. Tens of thousands of children— 
some as young as 4 years old—are ex-
ploited to work in the mines with few 
safety protections.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S3256 
July 13, 2022 
President Biden promised to create 
green jobs, but he didn’t mention that 
they would be done by children in Afri-
ca or slaves in China. These poor kids 
are mistreated and malnourished and 
even drugged to suppress their hunger 
so they can work for longer hours. 
Breathing in toxic fumes causes long- 
term health problems, including lung 
disease and heart failure, as well as 
birth defects. And miners are often 
buried alive when tunnels cave in. 
These are some of the kids who mine 
the cobalt to make an EV run. And in 
the other photo are some of the folks 
who produce ethanol for motor vehi-
cles. I know which photo I would rath-
er see. Who powers your vehicle? 
In addition to the toxic harm to hu-
mans, the extraction of cobalt also 
causes severe environmental pollution 
to the water, air, and to the soil. 
Just take a look at this picture. This 
is a mine in Congo where cobalt is ex-
tracted to make batteries for EVs. 
Nothing about this landscape looks 
like an environmental success story to 
me. By contrast, the picture over here 
is a beautiful farm in Iowa where corn 
is grown to make fuel for motor vehi-
cles. Every year, I drive through mile 
after mile of cornfields on my 99-coun-
ty tour. It is the type of scenic drive 
that reconnects you with nature and 
reminds you of the importance of prop-
er stewardship of the land we live off 
of. 
Folks, we can all have a cleaner con-
science knowing that energy made in 
Iowa is creating economic opportuni-
ties for our neighbors, while keeping 
our communities green, rather than ex-
ploiting children or creating a toxic 
wasteland. Can the same be said about 
the initiatives that are being pushed by 
the Biden administration? Like beg-
ging OPEC to pump more oil, sending 
our Nation’s strategic oil reserves to 
China, or subsidizing China’s market in 
slave and child labor. 
Are we going to tell the truth to the 
children that riding the electric school 
buses that the Biden administration is 
spending $5 billion on to purchase, 
what really makes the wheels on these 
buses go round and round is the exploi-
tation of other children who are their 
age or even younger? Or are we just 
going to tell them more green fairy 
tales? 
It is time to come clean about the 
Democrats’ Green New Deal. Just like 
President Biden’s other policies, this 
radical agenda is creating problems, 
not solving them, including greater de-
pendency on foreign adversaries like 
China and Russia, reliance on child and 
slave forced labor, harm to human 
health and the environment, higher 
costs, and energy shortages and black-
outs. Democrats are literally trying to 
keep America in the dark about these 
inconvenient truths. 
Folks, the Biden blackouts will be 
the latest unneeded reminder that the 
Democrats’ Green New Deal can’t hold 
a candle to the Republicans’ record of 
producing an abundant supply of af-
fordable energy right here in the good 
old United States of America. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Tennessee. 
Mrs. BLACKBURN. Madam Presi-
dent, it is so interesting being home for 
July 4 and talking with Tennesseans, 
and it sounds like Senator ERNST heard 
some of the same things from her con-
stituents there in Iowa. 
But what came up a lot in our con-
versations was the feeling and the 
awareness that the Democrats and the 
media have spent the last few months 
trying to convince the American people 
that oil companies are to blame for 
Biden’s energy crisis. 
At one point, they even tried to 
blame the people running the local gas 
stations, all the moms and pops, but 
Tennesseans know whose fault it is. 
Tennesseans 
are 
smart. 
They 
are 
watching very closely. And they know 
that President Biden became respon-
sible for their pain the moment he 
chose a radical, environmental agenda 
over the fully realized vision of Amer-
ican energy independence. 
That is right, we were energy inde-
pendent the day he took office. 
So President Biden canceled the Key-
stone Pipeline. He canceled leases and 
energy infrastructure, and he got be-
hind dozens of regulations that have 
made it almost impossible for Amer-
ican energy producers to do their job. 
At the time, Democrats claimed this 
was all for the greater good. It is tem-
porary. It is transitioning to the lib-
eral world order. But I think any rea-
sonable person would agree that what 
has happened is things have gotten 
worse—terribly worse. 
If you don’t want to take my word 
for it, talk to the local leaders who are 
responsible for keeping the lights on in 
their communities. City budgets are 
stretched thin. School budgets aren’t 
doing any better. Parents want to 
know if the buses will keep running 
and what will happen in August if the 
schools can’t afford to turn the air-con-
ditioning on. Everyone wants to know 
what will happen to public transpor-
tation, to emergency services, and to 
law enforcement if the price of a gallon 
of gas gets too expensive. They have no 
idea how far the Biden administration 
will allow this to go, and that is what 
concerns them the most. 
Joe Biden hasn’t just failed ‘‘we the 
people,’’ he has sabotaged the pocket-
books of millions of Americans and 
given our adversaries a huge advan-
tage. 
The Democrats gambled on the Green 
New Deal. It is evident they lost. Their 
gas holiday was a gimmick, and that 
failed. Energy prices are through the 
roof, but they still pulled a million bar-
rels of oil out of the Strategic Petro-
leum Reserve, and they sent it to com-
munist China. 
Now the President of the United 
States has gone hat in hand to Saudi 
Arabia so that he can beg for oil. He is 
even trying to cozy up to the Iranians 
with a new Iran nuclear deal, begging 
for oil. Our hard-fought energy inde-
pendence is gone, along with our Na-
tion’s credibility on this issue. 
The world is watching Joe Biden. 
They are watching the Biden blackouts 
that are really taking a toll on Amer-
ican energy and American consumers, 
and you and I both know that all the 
wrong people are seeing this as an op-
portunity to profit. 
If the Biden administration con-
tinues to squander our country’s re-
sources, we will lose even more ground 
to the axis of evil. Russia still has a 
stranglehold 
on 
European 
energy. 
American supply chains are still hope-
lessly entangled with China. Iran is 
ready to steamroll Biden for that new 
nuclear deal. North Korea is deploying 
hackers to the West at an alarming 
rate. I don’t think a Civilian Climate 
Corps has a chance in this match-up. 
I would admonish the President to 
remember that the new axis of evil is 
playing by a different set of rules. 
Their only goal is to find our vulnera-
bilities and exploit them to try to take 
us down. 
I would remind my Democratic col-
leagues that Biden’s energy crisis is a 
vulnerability, and it is your duty to 
help lead the country out of it. Don’t 
be complicit. Restart the Keystone 
Pipeline, open up those leases on Fed-
eral lands, get the regulators out of the 
way, and unleash American energy be-
fore it is too late. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Iowa. 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, 
before I speak, I have been asked to 
make a unanimous consent request 
that Senators SCOTT, HOEVEN, BAR-
RASSO, and I be permitted to speak for 
up to 5 minutes each prior to the votes 
and that Senator BENNET be permitted 
to speak for up to 10 minutes prior to 
the votes. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
BIDEN ADMINISTRATION 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, 
over the July 4 recess of Congress, I 
held Q&A’s in 17 counties as part of my 
annual 99 county meetings. The need 
for energy independence and the con-
cerns over soaring gas prices were 
raised at nearly every meeting. As an 
example, at Woodford Equipment in 
Emmetsburg, IA, farmers raised their 
concerns over the high cost of diesel 
and their pricey commutes to work at 
that business caused by President 
Biden’s failed energy policies. 
Today is a very difficult time for 
American families and businesses, with 
gas and diesel prices at record highs— 
more than doubling since President 
Biden took office. Americans who drive 
every day are feeling the impact of an 
administration that is making it hard-
er to drill and refine fossil fuels. 
President Biden has stated that it is 
the administration’s goal to have half 
of the Nation’s vehicles be electric by 
the year 2030. The Energy Secretary

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S3257 
July 13, 2022 
has said that to beat the high gas 
prices, 
Americans 
should 
purchase 
electric vehicles. Now, that is prac-
tically impossible for most families be-
cause the average price of an electric 
vehicle, according to Kelley Blue Book, 
is $56,000. That happens to be roughly 
equivalent to Iowa’s median family in-
come. 
Even if having half of all cars be elec-
tric by 2030 were attainable—which, of 
course, it isn’t—that presents yet an-
other real problem. Large swaths of the 
United States’ electrical grid are at 
risk for shortfall this summer. In May, 
the North American Electric Reli-
ability Corporation released its sum-
mer reliability assessment. They iden-
tified the West and Midwest as being at 
heightened risk for energy shortfalls. 
The farm where I live near Cedar Falls, 
IA, is served by Cedar Falls municipal 
electricity, and this is the first time in 
my life that I have ever gotten a warn-
ing from that electric company that we 
could have brownouts. So if all cars 
were electric, the United States would 
need roughly 25 percent more elec-
tricity than it does today. We simply 
cannot add that many electric vehicles 
to the grid. 
While gas prices have gone through 
the roof, energy prices are not far be-
hind. From June last year until May 
this year, the Consumer Price Index for 
electricity rose 12 percent. That is the 
largest increase in the past 15 years. 
With reliability concerns increasing 
this summer and energy prices rising, 
Democrats still continue to pursue 
their Green New Deal agenda. There 
continue to be rumors of another mas-
sive tax-and-spending spree passed on a 
partisan vote that would push prices 
even higher. 
It is past time for Democrats in Con-
gress and the White House to rethink 
our Nation’s energy policy. Instead of 
becoming more like Europe, the United 
States must have an ‘‘all of the above’’ 
strategy. Our country has bountiful re-
sources for energy generation. I am 
very proud of Iowa, a State that pro-
duces over 60 percent of its electricity 
from wind, but I know that this does 
not work in every State of the Nation. 
Fossil fuels still account for 60 percent 
of electricity generated in the United 
States. 
Instead of focusing on domestic en-
ergy production, the President and his 
administration have caved to environ-
mentalists in shaping our energy poli-
cies. Utilities and energy companies 
are up to the task to provide affordable 
energy to all Americans. Every year, 
these companies are becoming cleaner 
and reducing our carbon footprint. 
Nevertheless, Washington continues to 
layer regulation upon regulation, mak-
ing costs go up. 
Between new requirements on bank-
ing, blocking new oil leases, and block-
ing key pipelines, Democrats in Con-
gress seem determined to inflict pain 
at the pump and also on our energy 
bills. 
The 
world 
has 
dramatically 
changed since President Biden took of-
fice. Democrats need to adjust their 
priorities and stop this madness. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Florida. 
Mr. SCOTT of Florida. Madam Presi-
dent, I am here today, along with my 
Republican colleagues, because Amer-
ican families are suffering. Florida 
families are suffering at the hand of 
the Biden administration’s war on en-
ergy independence. 
Last month, I heard about a church 
in 
St. 
Petersburg—just 
south 
of 
Tampa—that makes hot meals for 
those who have fallen on tough times. 
Like many other churches across the 
country, 
they 
started 
making 
the 
meals 
for 
Thanksgiving, 
but 
this 
church decided to keep it going, and 
since, they have made thousands of hot 
meals for families. Here is the problem: 
Fewer people are coming because those 
families who need the food now can’t 
even afford to make the trip because 
gas is so expensive. The poorest fami-
lies in my State are having to make 
the impossible choice of sacrificing a 
hot meal because they can’t afford to 
put gas in their cars. 
I want to reiterate this point because 
I want my Democrat colleagues who, 
like Joe Biden, think inflation is a 
‘‘high-class problem’’ or some ‘‘incred-
ible transition’’ to understand the 
gravity of this administration’s infla-
tion crisis. Families in my State of 
Florida are having to turn down an op-
portunity for a free hot meal because 
they can’t afford the gas to get over to 
the church and get it. 
It makes me furious to see this hap-
pening in my State and all across our 
country, all the while, while Joe Biden 
does nothing to fix it. He has done 
nothing. 
As of today, the average price of a 
gallon of gas is $4.63. The day Joe 
Biden took office, gas was averaging 
$2.37 per gallon. According to the U.S. 
Energy Information Administration, in 
15 different months of Joe Biden’s Pres-
idency, the national average for gas 
prices has risen. But the Democrats up 
here don’t seem to care. 
You all remember how last month 
the senior Senator from Michigan ex-
plained during a hearing of the Finance 
Committee that, unlike her constitu-
ents, she doesn’t worry about gas 
prices because she has the means to af-
ford an electric car. She actually said 
that. Then, when she gets to work in 
Washington, she gets to charge her car 
at the Capitol for free, while taxpayers 
foot the bill. Good for her, but that is 
not a realistic solution for the millions 
of Americans suffering under the Biden 
administration’s failed energy policy. 
Democrats in Washington know the 
effect these high prices are having, and 
they are celebrating because their radi-
cally progressive campaign against en-
ergy independence is working. But 
Americans are not celebrating; they 
are struggling. 
Unlike the liberal elites running our 
government, I am not going to stand 
for it. That is why earlier this year I 
introduced the FREE American Energy 
Act, to expedite the Federal Agencies’ 
review process of applications for per-
mits, waivers, licenses, or other au-
thorizations related to energy produc-
tion. It is why I have introduced the 
GAS PRICE Act. It would direct the 
Energy Information Administration to 
report to Congress any policy or rule 
set by the Biden administration which 
raises energy costs for American fami-
lies. I even asked the Senate to pass 
the GAS PRICE Act by unanimous con-
sent this past October, but Senate 
Democrats blocked its passage. It is as 
if they want to keep Americans in the 
dark on why energy prices are rising. 
We also need to speed up the approval 
process for oil permitting, and Ameri-
cans need to know that this adminis-
tration is purposely trying to make life 
more difficult and more expensive. We 
have the resources within our borders 
to be energy independent and for every-
day life to be affordable. 
While we are ramping up American 
production, we need to completely halt 
sales of U.S. oil to communist China. 
That is right—while gas prices remain 
sky-high here, the Biden administra-
tion is still giving a green light for 
American oil to be sold to our enemies, 
like communist China. That is hard to 
believe. 
I was proud to join with my friend 
and fellow Floridian, Senator MARCO 
RUBIO, to introduce the China Oil Ex-
port Prohibition Act last month to 
stop these sales. We shouldn’t be help-
ing our enemies or asking foreign na-
tions to increase supply. We should be 
increasing our American supply within 
our borders. We did it during the 
Trump administration, and we can do 
it again. 
Joe Biden can roll back the countless 
regulations he instituted that are hurt-
ing 
our 
domestic 
production. 
The 
White House, the EPA, and the Depart-
ment of the Interior, and the Depart-
ment of Energy can end their campaign 
against American oil producers and 
start working to create an agenda of 
energy independence. 
Congress can pass my legislation to 
make oil permitting faster and give 
greater transparency into the impact 
legislation from Congress has on en-
ergy prices. We don’t have to throw up 
our hands and do nothing and give up. 
Joe Biden and the Democrats who con-
trol Washington can and must take 
real action to start producing energy 
within our borders safely once again. 
Our future is bleak if we don’t. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from North Dakota. 
Mr. HOEVEN. Madam President, I 
come to the floor today, along with my 
colleagues, because Americans are con-
tinuing to take a financial hit with 
more expensive, less reliable energy re-
sulting from the Biden administra-
tion’s harmful energy agenda.

prices at the gas pump. Gas is now $4.63 
a gallon nationwide and an average of 
$4.57 per gallon in my home State of 
North Dakota. Sky-high energy prices 
are fueling record inflation, driving up 
the cost of goods across the entire 
economy. 
The current CPI rate came out this 
morning—9.1 percent—9.1 percent, the 
highest in over 40 years. And it hurts 
every single American—at the gas 
pump, at the grocery store, everything 
they buy. Unbelievable. 
Of course, energy is a big part of that 
inflation. There is an energy compo-
nent in every good and service that you 
get. Electricity prices have risen 13.7 
percent. Natural gas and heating oil 
prices have ballooned by 38.4 percent 
and 98.5 percent, respectively, over the 
last year. 
In addition to higher prices, the 
North American Electric Reliability 
Corporation, or NERC, warned that 
homes and businesses across much of 
the country are facing higher risk of 
blackouts and brownouts this summer. 
President Biden’s energy policies are 
threatening the economic well-being of 
Americans and our national security. 
Just a few years ago, our country was 
producing almost 13 million barrels per 
day of oil and consumers benefited 
from historically low energy prices. 
Production has remained down under 
this administration at about 111⁄2 mil-
lion barrels of production per day. 
American families are paying record 
prices because the Biden administra-
tion is continuing its regulatory on-
slaught on domestic energy production. 
President Biden’s energy crisis began 
with the administration’s moratorium 
on new energy leases, closing off access 
to our abundant taxpayer-owned en-
ergy reserves on Federal lands. And for 
leases that the energy companies have 
on Federal lands, they are being held 
up either by the administration’s bu-
reaucratic redtape that doesn’t allow 
them to get drilling permits or held up 
by litigation in the courts. And this ad-
ministration continues to hold up our 
ability to move more oil and gas across 
the country by blocking pipelines like 
the Keystone XL Pipeline. In 2015, I led 
a bipartisan effort in Congress to ap-
prove the Keystone XL Pipeline. If the 
Obama-Biden administration hadn’t ve-
toed our bill which passed both Houses 
of Congress, this pipeline would be op-
erating today and bringing almost a 
million barrels of oil a day to our coun-
try from our closest friend and ally 
Canada. 
We need to unleash more of our vast 
energy, our oil and natural gas re-
serves, all the energy that this Nation 
produces—our most critical, economic, 
and national security assets. And if we 
want to truly cut off the Russian war 
machine and support our allies, we 
need to cut off Putin’s ability to sell 
Russian energy. 
A good start would be by passing leg-
islation like my American Energy 
Independence From Russia Act, bi-
cameral legislation that I introduced 
with nine of my colleagues in the Sen-
ate. Our commonsense approach takes 
immediate action to encourage more 
U.S. 
energy 
production, 
including 
things like increasing access to tax-
payer-owned energy reserves on Fed-
eral land, authorizing the construction 
and operation of the Keystone XL Pipe-
line—vital infrastructure to move en-
ergy safely around the country—and 
removing regulatory hurdles to in-
crease liquefied natural gas facilities 
and exports. 
Each additional barrel of oil we 
produce here at home replaces produc-
tion from Russia and other adversaries, 
countries that also have little to no en-
vironmental 
standards. 
Each 
addi-
tional barrel we produce at home helps 
reduce prices and lower inflation for 
the American people. 
Instead of asking Saudi Arabia for 
help—and as you know, the President 
is on a trip to do that right now—or 
going to places or asking for help from 
adversaries like Iran or for energy from 
Venezuela, President Biden should be 
empowering our domestic producers to 
restore and grow our supply of energy 
here at home. 
The solution is simple. The Biden ad-
ministration needs to take the hand-
cuffs off domestic energy production 
because more supply is needed to bring 
down prices. That is just common 
sense, and the American people know 
it. The American people need that re-
lief now. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Wyoming. 
Mr. BARRASSO. Madam President, 
first I would like to associate myself 
with the remarks from the distin-
guished senior Senator from North Da-
kota who spoke so well about the 
issues that are facing the American 
people, both in terms of inflation and 
in terms of energy. 
So I join my colleagues today on the 
floor to talk about this crisis that we 
are facing under the Presidency of Joe 
Biden and the Democrats in this body. 
We found out this morning that infla-
tion hit another record high, a 40-year 
high, and we are now entering a sum-
mer of suffering by the American peo-
ple, suffering brought on by the Demo-
crats and their reckless spending and 
policies. 
The inflation numbers themselves 
are shocking. The impact on families is 
so, so disturbing. In my home State of 
Wyoming, the people that normally 
volunteer to drive meals to shut-ins on 
Meals on Wheels—who run some of 
those rural routes and drive around 
and drop off meals—these are volun-
teers with time on their hands, senior 
citizens who do the driving. They are 
no longer able to do it because they 
cannot afford the gas under Joe Biden 
and the Democratic policies. 
The day Joe Biden came into office, 
gas was $2.38 per gallon—plenty of vol-
unteers paying their own gas. Today, 
the price has almost doubled what it 
was when Joe Biden came into office. 
That is what the American people are 
seeing: pain at the pump and pain at 
the grocery store. And the numbers are 
disturbing, and people are falling fur-
ther and further behind. Inflation is up 
9 percent, but wages are only up 5 per-
cent, so that gap is growing and people 
are hurting. 
It doesn’t seem the President even 
understands it or can conceive of it, 
but that is who we have representing 
the people in the White House today. 
Over the last 4 months, working fam-
ilies have paid the highest gas prices in 
American history. The price of natural 
gas has also tripled since the day Joe 
Biden took office. In total, the average 
American family paid an additional 
$1,000 last year just for energy com-
pared to the year before, and this year 
it is going to be a lot worse. 
Now, it is the summer. Most Ameri-
cans are facing the real possibility of 
blackouts. Two-thirds of Americans are 
likely to face energy blackouts. That is 
not me saying it; it is the energy spe-
cialists who analyze where the energy 
is coming from, how much is needed, 
and where it is going. 
During a summer heat wave, black-
outs threaten people’s lives. To the cli-
mate purists and elitists and extrem-
ists who are running the administra-
tion, they don’t seem to care. So why is 
it happening? America still has plenty 
of energy—the best energy in the 
world—and the most. We have some of 
the largest energy reserves anywhere. 
States like Wyoming, where I am from, 
are sitting on a gold mine of energy. 
The Biden energy crisis is a direct re-
sult of the administration’s energy 
policies. 
From the day Joe Biden took office, 
he has waged an all-out war on Amer-
ican energy. He killed the Keystone XL 
Pipeline—actually bragged about the 
fact that he did that on his first day in 
office. He stopped the exploration of oil 
in Alaska and bragged about it. It 
wasn’t something he was trying to 
hide. No, he bragged about the fact 
that he was going to war with America. 
American energy was in his targets. 
Joe Biden has raised the cost to 
produce energy on Federal land by 50 
percent. This is the largest increase in 
what they call the royalty rate in 100 
years—100 years. Does Joe Biden under-
stand that? Does he know that? Does 
he care that people are suffering all 
around the country? No wonder we are 
still producing 1.1 million fewer barrels 
of oil today than we were at the begin-
ning of the pandemic. 
Joe Biden refuses to do the things 
that would work. He refuses to produce 
more American energy. 
What did the administration say 
about it? What did the economists say? 
This is the cost of the liberal world 
order. This is the price we have to pay 
for the liberal world order. That is the 
White House’s statement. I don’t even 
know people who talk that way any-
more, but that is what we got coming 
out of this White House and this Presi-
dent who today, at this very moment,

July 13, 2022 
is heading to Saudi Arabia to beg for 
oil when we have it right here. It is 
more than disturbing. It is disgraceful. 
That is what we have with the Presi-
dent of the United States today. 
So now what is happening? Joe Biden 
throwing another Hail Mary pass, hop-
ing something will happen. His Hail 
Mary passes are uncatchable. 
Since November, Joe Biden has re-
leased more oil from our strategic re-
serve than any President in American 
history. The Strategic Petroleum Re-
serve is designed to be there for emer-
gencies. He is releasing it because he is 
trying to bring down the cost of oil and 
the cost of gas. And he caused the prob-
lem. It is not an emergency. This was 
a Joe Biden-caused problem. Previous 
Presidents only used the Strategic Re-
serve during wartime or after natural 
disasters. But Joe Biden is spending 
down our savings to pay for his anti- 
American energy policy. He seems to 
be proud of it. Well, gas prices are still 
near record highs. 
Let’s recount: the day Joe Biden 
came into the White House, $2.38 a gal-
lon; today, in many places, over $5 a 
gallon and on average, $4.60 a gallon. 
And the peak summer driving season 
isn’t even here yet. 
Today, the Strategic Reserve is at 
the lowest level since 1986. So what if 
there is a real emergency? Then what 
do we do? This last week, we found out 
that some of this energy, the oil he has 
reserved—a million barrels of oil—went 
to an energy company owned by the 
Chinese Government. Thank you, Mr. 
President. Surrender to China. Give it 
to them. Joe Biden is sending our oil to 
China in the middle of an energy crisis 
that he created. 
So, on Monday, Joe Biden’s National 
Security Advisor practically admitted 
that Joe Biden is going to beg the 
Saudis to sell us more oil. He left for 
Saudi Arabia last night, and he is 
going as a weakened President. 
He wrote an editorial in the Wash-
ington Post about why he was going. I 
will tell you how he is going: He is 
going as a weakened President, weak-
ened at home and weakened in the eyes 
of the world. 
Rather than send oil to China and 
money to the Saudis, let us use the en-
ergy we have right here in the United 
States in the ground, where we do it in 
the finest environmental ways com-
pared to the rest of the world and we 
have the energy workers who know 
how to do it. 
What is he thinking? 
At the same time, astonishingly, Joe 
Biden decided to spend the time around 
the Fourth of July tweeting threats to 
gas stations. For the moms and pops 
who are running little gas stations in 
our communities and our neighbor-
hoods, this is basic economic illiteracy. 
Prices aren’t set by the local gas sta-
tions; prices are set by supply and de-
mand. If you want low prices, you need 
more supply, more American energy. 
The prices may have ticked back a 
little bit now because people cannot af-
ford to drive. They can’t afford to fill 
their tanks. They cannot afford to fill 
their tanks. 
I was at a gas station the other day 
in Casper, WY, and I talked to a couple. 
One of them said: I have $100. That is 
as far as I can go. I can only fill it with 
$100 worth. I can’t fill the tank. I will 
see how much gas I get. 
What have we come to? 
Joe Biden brags about killing the 
Keystone XL Pipeline, which would 
have brought over 800,000 barrels of oil 
a day to the United States. He killed it 
on day 1 in office and bragged about it. 
The Democrats in the Senate are now 
proposing to make the Biden energy 
crisis even worse. Senate Democrats in 
this very body, in this very room, are 
talking about raising taxes on energy 
production. This is going to raise en-
ergy prices for half of the households in 
America. It will raise prices for thou-
sands and thousands of businesses. 
Higher prices will get passed on to cus-
tomers. 
If Democrats pass another reckless 
tax-and-spending bill—and it looks like 
they are all lined up to do it, save one 
or two—inflation is going to get much 
worse, and working families will be 
paying more. If I were one of those 
Democratic Senators and were on the 
ballot this November, I would be shak-
ing in my boots, knowing that the peo-
ple of my State are mad at me for 
adopting policies that are hurting 
them directly in their wallets. 
What they are talking about is $300 
billion for more of the old Green New 
Deal. It is going to give more power to 
the climate alarmists, to the climate 
elitists, and to the climate extremists, 
who run the Democratic Party and are 
running it into the ground. The profes-
sional climate activists will never be 
satisfied. The activists will never stop. 
You can never go far enough for them. 
They weren’t satisfied a year ago when 
they started this inflation crisis, and 
with the liberal world order, they will 
never be satisfied. The professional ac-
tivists want energy prices to remain 
high. They are happy with $5 gas. They 
want to punish us for using fossil fuels. 
Joe Biden’s advisers keep telling us 
about this incredible transition. They 
call it an incredible transition. Well, 
ask people around the country and in 
your home State. It has been a transi-
tion to a crisis: a transition to higher 
prices, a transition to a lower quality 
of life, to pain at the pump, and to pain 
at the grocery store. It has been a tran-
sition to stress for working people and 
families who feel stuck and squeezed. If 
Democrats don’t change their energy 
policies, there is going to be an incred-
ible transition. It is going to be a tran-
sition of power right here in Wash-
ington this November.

REMEMBERING HERSHEL WOODROW ‘‘WOODY’’ 
WILLIAMS 
Mr. MANCHIN. Mr. President, I rise 
today to speak on the life and legacy of 
my dear friend, the last surviving 
World War II Medal of Honor Recipient, 
West Virginian, and one of the last of 
the ‘‘greatest generation,’’ Woody Wil-
liams of Quiet Dell, WV. 
Before I begin today, I want to recog-
nize members of Woody’s family who 
are here today with us in the Gallery, 
and in recognizing all of them, I want 
to say thank you. Thank you for being 
here and thank you for sharing Woody 
all those years with me and Shelley 
and all of our West Virginians. 
We are here today to respect Woody’s 
wishes of honoring all veterans and 
their families and to pay respects to 
our Nation’s last living World War II 
Medal of Honor recipient. 
To the family, I want to say this: 
You are the legacy he was most proud 
of, all of you, and I am honored to wel-
come—Senator CAPITO, both of us, are 
welcoming you, which is Woody’s leg-
acy, still here, and thank you. 
But we are going to respect his wish-
es, and his wishes, basically, were hon-
oring veterans and their families and 
to pay respects to the Nation’s last liv-
ing World War II Medal of Honor re-
cipient. 
It has been 77 years since Woody Wil-
liams quieted those enemy machine-
guns on the sands of Iwo Jima, and 
while he is now sadly gone, the ideals 
that he lived by are not: the love of his 
family, his friends and his faith and 
service to country above all. 
GEN George Patton once said: 
It is foolish and wrong to mourn the men 
who died. Rather, we should thank God that 
such men lived. 
Woody lived every day as if he were 
given a second chance, and we are all 
so much better for it. 
And, boy, did Woody live for a long 
time. His grandson Brent Casey passed 
along Woody’s recipe for a long life. I 
hope I have got all this right. He would 
say when asked: 
It’s Braggs apple cider vinegar, and it has 
to have the ‘‘mother,’’ and, you know, the 
cloudy stuff in the bottom of the bottle, 
mixed with local honey, and 6 ounces of 
warm water. You can add some pure maple 
syrup for extra flavoring if you’d like. 
And Woody said: 
I’ve been drinking it every morning since 
the early 1960s. 
About 3 years ago, he got it printed 
on a business card because he said he 
was so tired of reciting it every time 
someone asked, and he handed out 
quite a few of those cards too. 
One of my favorite Woody quotes is 
the one he cited when his great-grand-
son Cedar graduated from Marine boot 
camp. When Woody was asked what it 
meant to be a marine, he said: 
By taking that oath, you can take my life, 
but you cannot take my country or my free-
dom. 
You cannot take my country or my 
freedom. That says it all about Woody. 
During the ceremony in West Vir-
ginia last weekend, Woody’s grandson 
Chad said: 
We must remember what Woody taught us. 
There are few things in the world that we 
can do alone. It is only through the support 
of others that we can truly reach our goals. 
So look to your left and look to your right. 
We are all a part of his legacy, and it is up 
to us to carry it forward. In the words of 
Woody, ‘‘The cause is greater than I.’’ 
One of Woody’s last wishes was lying 
in state at the U.S. Capitol, and it 
wasn’t for himself. We spoke about this 
years ago. It wasn’t for himself, but he 
wanted to make sure that we represent 
all Medal of Honor recipients from 
World War II, and there were only 472— 
of the whole war, 472. 
Tomorrow, the West Virginia farm 
boy from Quiet Dell will lie in honor in 
the U.S. Capitol Rotunda, laying to 
rest the sacrifices of a generation of 
heroes. That is what we do tomorrow. 
Woody can rest in peace knowing his 
mission is complete. 
I will miss Woody because he was my 
wingman or may I say this: We maybe 
were all his wingmen, and I think that 
is what he would have preferred. 
Woody always had a project for ev-
eryone around him. Everyone sitting 
up there, he had projects for you. He 
had projects for me and projects for 
Shelley. He made sure that we under-
stood exactly what he wanted done. 
As his grandson Bryan Casey said, ‘‘If 
you met with Woody, you know he al-
ways had a project for everyone. He 
would magically produce napkins and 
sharpies with his projects—typically 
with him diagramming the project 
while we watched and listened. They 
were not always unused napkins, but 
they always became works of art.’’ 
Woody came to me a few years ago 
and said that we needed to help the 
Gold Star families in West Virginia and 
across the whole country. So we start-
ed a motorcycle ride for fallen service 
heroes. We did six of those rides—and 
Woody was in his nineties—and he was 
there every time in that sling shot, 
just giving it all he had, and he stayed 
right with us. 
We raised hundreds of thousands of 
dollars for the Gold Star families. 
Some of those funds, as you know, 
went into monuments across the Na-
tion, including the one that sits at the 
Capitol we honored also with the lay-
ing of the wreath. 
I know how many good things Woody 
and I worked on together. If you mul-
tiply that by all the other people he 
worked with, you will fully realize 
Woody’s incredible impact on West Vir-
ginia and the entire country. 
That is why he got a ship, a VA hos-
pital, and a National Guard Reserve 
Center named after him. 
Most recently, because of Woody, our 
VA medical centers were saved. His 
testimony ended the AIR Commission, 
which would have turned three of our 
four West Virginia VA medical centers 
into urgent care centers, as well as 
countless others across the Nation. 
And, really, in rural America, rural 
veterans would not have been served. 
Every veteran in the Nation can 
thank Woody for saving their VA hos-
pital. 
Woody was with me when I was Gov-
ernor and helped so much as we stood

up to the Cabinet Secretary for Vet-
erans Affairs. Then he was the found-
ing member of my Senate Veterans Ad-
visory Group, where he led efforts to 
clean up the Clarksburg and Beckley 
VAMCs. 
He helped get the first Fisher House. 
I remember we called Ken Fisher. Ken 
came in, met with Woody, and it was 
over. It was going to be done. It was 
that quick. It was unbelievable, and I 
know it gave so much solace to the 
family when they got to spend a few 
moments in that beautiful place. It was 
really something very, very special. 
Woody has been there every step of 
the way, making sure that families of 
the fallen receive death gratuities dur-
ing government shutdowns. That was 
the time that he said: JOE, we have to 
do something. He said: The shutdown is 
preventing us from giving the gratu-
ities the families need. 
That is when we called Ken Fisher, 
and that is when we all became very 
good friends with Fisher House. Ken 
Fisher was the leader of that. That is 
how that all began, and Ken was happy 
to step up. 
Naming the first Gold Star Children’s 
Day, August 1—he was instrumental in 
that. 
It was also amazing that so many 
people from across the country and 
each of our States that we represent in 
this great deliberative body had so 
many good things to say about Woody 
because his legacy runs farther than 
just West Virginia, as you know. 
I didn’t realize the magnitude of 
Woody’s impact until I traveled with 
him to California and also in Virginia 
when his ship was commissioned and it 
was christened. And, when that hap-
pened, I mean, from the brass all the 
way down to the ensigns on this ship, 
the marines learned about being a ma-
rine because of studying Woody Wil-
liams. 
I didn’t realize the impact that he 
had. It was unbelievable. I am there, 
and I had all of these people coming to 
me and telling me the impact that he 
had on them and how much they ad-
mired him. 
But I am always remembering the 
one general telling me how they stud-
ied Woody Williams in the Marine 
Corps. I never forgot that. He said: Let 
me tell you, I know you know him as a 
friend. I know you know him as rep-
resenting your State. Let me tell you 
how he represented the Marine Corps. 
So when marines learn how to be ma-
rines, they learn about Woody Wil-
liams. 
I always knew that West Virginia 
had a treasure with Woody, but what I 
didn’t know is that he was their treas-
ure also. I will forever be grateful that 
Woody and his family gave me the gift 
of spending time with him in Hun-
tington. And when Mara and I were 
able to go down that Sunday morning 
before he passed, it was such a special 
day. He was as chirpy and bright as 
ever. You would not think that any-
thing was really that much different. 
And I said: Woody, I think someone 
wants to speak to you. 
It was Denis McDonough, who is the 
Secretary of the VA for the United 
States of America. He wanted to speak 
to Woody, and Woody was so thrilled. 
It was a great conversation. And just 
as true to form as Woody, he said, ‘‘Mr. 
Secretary, I have to tell you just a cou-
ple of things,’’ and he went into ex-
actly what needed to be done. It was 
just classic. Denis called me afterward 
to explain the conversation, and he was 
so tickled. 
It took a Woody, also, to be able to 
have that conversation. And he was 
just full of life. He was still full of life, 
and he was still full of ambition to get 
things accomplished. 
In his final days, he stayed the same 
as I always knew him. As you know, he 
was quick as a whip, kind, selfless, and 
concerned for his fellow veterans and 
the families and all of you. He was con-
cerned about everybody. 
And he was ready. It was a moment 
that I will cherish the rest of my days 
being able to spend that little bit of 
time at the end there. But in true 
Woody fashion, he gave me marching 
orders that day. He said that one of his 
last wishes was enclosing the com-
mittal shelter at the Donel C. Kinnard 
Memorial State Veterans Cemetery. 
Senator CAPITO got the same order I 
got. It is on our to-do list, and it will 
get done so that the families will be 
protected from the elements when pay-
ing their final respects. It is something 
that should be done in every shelter 
and every VA burial ground, in every 
VA cemetery. 
But, of course, this project was big-
ger than just West Virginia for Woody. 
It will probably lead to a national ef-
fort. I can promise you this: that we 
are going to get that done. It was a 
commitment we made to Woody, and it 
will happen. 
As 
President 
Biden 
said 
upon 
Woody’s passing, ‘‘I don’t throw the 
word ‘hero’ around lightly, but if I’m 
going to use it, I’d use it for a guy like 
Woody Williams. . . . Heroism—like it 
did for Woody—can come in all shapes 
and sizes.’’ 
Woody Williams was far more than 
just a hero. He was the greatest of the 
‘‘greatest generation’’ and a model for 
future generations. 
From what I know, Woody’s greatest 
wish was for all of us to continue his 
mission, to give back to each other, to 
love our country. As his grandson 
Bryan said last week, ‘‘I have the 
project that he wants each of you to 
work on. A couple of them, actually.’’ 
And, today, I will ask each of you to 
work on these projects, too. If Gold 
Star families in your area are traveling 
more than an hour to one of the Gold 
Star Family Memorial Monuments, 
they are traveling too far. Your project 
is to get a project working in your 
backyard. 
Second, if you have a monument in 
your area, your project is to ensure the 
legacy that Woody helped create by 
working to recognize these families. 
Become part of the project. Become 
part of the process to bring people back 
to that monument, lest we never forget 
these Gold Star families. 
As we celebrate the life and legacy of 
Woody Williams and all our veterans of 
World War II this evening and tomor-
row, let us all do our best to continue 
Woody’s mission. 
May God rest the soul of our dear 
friend, our leader, our national hero, 
Woody Williams. 
I yield the floor to my colleague Sen-
ator CAPITO. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Ms. 
SMITH). The Senator from West Vir-
ginia. 
Mrs. CAPITO. Madam President, I 
thank Senator MANCHIN
for such a 
great tribute to our good friend Woody 
Williams and his family, to his genera-
tion, and to his love of our country and 
the love of freedom. Thank you for the 
leadership that you showed to make 
sure that tomorrow could happen. 
I know we worked on this together, 
but this is not an easy lift, to lie in 
honor, as you know, in the U.S. Cap-
itol. But to me, it is so symbolic of a 
generation, and I have encouraged ev-
erybody I have seen to please come and 
pay their respects to Woody or to that 
‘‘greatest 
generation’’ 
that 
Woody 
symbolizes in his passing. 
I also want to thank the family. I 
can’t see them from where I sit over 
here. I am right underneath you guys. 
Woody has two daughters, Travie and 
Tracy, and five grandsons and three 
great grandchildren, one of which is a 
great granddaughter. And I have had 
the pleasure of spending time with 
them over the last several days. 
So I rise today to honor and cele-
brate the legacy of an American hero 
and proud son of West Virginia. He was 
always a proud son of West Virginia. 
On June 29, Hershel ‘‘Woody’’ Williams, 
the last remaining Medal of Honor re-
cipient from World War II, passed away 
at the grand age of 98, and, tomorrow, 
rightfully, he will become just the sev-
enth American and the first West Vir-
ginian to lie in honor in the U.S. Cap-
itol Rotunda. It is a well-deserved rec-
ognition for a man from humble begin-
nings. 
Woody was the youngest of 11 chil-
dren, and I am going to tell one of my 
favorite encounters that I had with 
Woody. 
He traveled everywhere. We would 
come on planes, and Woody would be 
on the plane coming to DC, and you 
would ask him: Where is he going? 
Oh, he is going to San Francisco or 
he is going to Seattle to do something 
for Gold Star families or to flip the 
coin in the Super Bowl. He had more 
energy than all of us put together. 
But he told me a lot of stories about 
his early life when I sat on the plane 
with him. And he did tell me that, dur-
ing World War II, when he was very 
anxious to sign up—as so many of them 
were at those young ages of 18, 19 and 
20—he had a problem because he didn’t 
really have a birth certificate.

He was born in Quiet Dell, WV, which 
is a little spot on the road, on a farm. 
But he told me that his mother had a 
really good friend, and his mother’s 
really good friend would come over and 
help her deliver her 11 children, and 
then Woody’s mother would go over 
and help her friend deliver her 7 or 8 
children, or however many she had. So 
there was no official documentation. 
I think he told me in the end—I have 
to make sure that I am telling this 
right to Tracy. He told me, in the end, 
that they had to drag his mother’s 
friend down to the bureau in the coun-
ty, when he wanted to sign up to join, 
to make sure that he was actually as 
old as he said he was. 
So being the youngest of 11, he made 
a lot of sacrifices for his family. But 
his acts of heroism would eventually 
help the United States capture the piv-
otal island of Iwo Jima, a world away 
from that dairy farm in Quiet Dell, 
WV. 
Many Americans recognize the iconic 
image of our marines raising the Amer-
ican flag atop Mount Suribachi. It 
emotes an enormous sense of pride for 
all of us of patriotism, of triumph. On 
that same day that the iconic photo 
was taken, February 23, 1945, a young 
Marine 
corporal 
by 
the 
name 
of 
Hershel ‘‘Woody’’ Williams was on that 
same island risking his life for our 
freedom. 
That day was under constant fire, 
and every time I heard him tell the 
story, he mentioned the folks that had 
his back. And some of them didn’t 
make it. 
Woody, who was a member of the 21st 
Marines, 3rd Marine Division, alone 
stormed multiple enemy pillboxes with 
limited cover, neutralizing one after 
another, saving countless American 
lives behind him. 
He went on to fight throughout the 
entire 5 week campaign on Iwo Jima 
until our forces finally took the Japa-
nese stronghold, marking a key turn-
ing point for the Allied cause. His ac-
tions that day and throughout the war 
are the reason why, when West Vir-
ginians think of the ‘‘greatest genera-
tion,’’ we think of Woody Williams. 
But what would set Woody apart, I 
think, more than those acts of valor on 
the battlefield, was what he did after 
that, how he carried himself in the 
more than 75 years since the Second 
World War. 
Through the Hershel ‘‘Woody’’ Wil-
liams Foundation he advocated for 
Gold Star families. I was able to attend 
a couple of the openings of the memo-
rials with him, and it was quite mov-
ing. He worked to ensure that the 
memories of loved ones lost would go 
on forever. 
Today, Woody and his foundation 
have installed 104 Gold Star Family 
Memorial Monuments across this coun-
try, with about 70 additional monu-
ments 
underway 
in 
every 
State. 
Through public appearances and his 
seemingly unending energy and pas-
sion, Woody shared his story with the 
world. 
And he was quite the speaker. I think 
Senator MANCHIN would agree with me: 
That guy could give a speech. It was al-
ways very captivating whenever Woody 
was on the program. His mission was to 
inspire 
those—especially 
younger— 
Americans, to answer the same call to 
service that he did as a teenage boy. 
As he said years later, ‘‘the people 
need to remember, if we ever lose our 
freedom, we will never be able to re-
gain it.’’ He believed that to every core 
of his body. There is no doubt in my 
mind that because of Woody, there are 
more people who answered the call and 
chose to serve the United States in 
some way, shape, or form—what an in-
credible legacy to leave. 
He also never forgot his fellow vet-
erans, serving as a veterans’ service rep 
for 33 years at the VA, and I am proud 
that legacy of care lives on forever in 
the Hershel ‘‘Woody’’ Williams VA 
Medical Center outside Huntington, 
WV. As a matter of fact, Senator 
MANCHIN
told me that was one of 
Woody’s requests: that we need another 
exit for that hospital. 
Joe, could you arrange that? 
But Woody did all this with the same 
trademark humility that we came to 
know and love about him. For in-
stance, several years after President 
Truman awarded him the Medal of 
Honor, Woody says he remembers ask-
ing himself in that moment: ‘‘Why was 
I selected to receive our Nation’s high-
est award when marines right beside 
me didn’t make it home?’’ 
And that just tells you everything 
you need to know. That shows you the 
kind of man that Woody Williams 
was—always for putting his country 
and comrades first and never concerned 
with who got the credit. 
I count it among one of my life’s les-
sons to have had that airline flight in 
close contact with him, but also 
through the years seeing him that I 
was able to learn from him and laugh 
with him. 
I asked him: Why the Marines? Why 
not the Army? 
Well, he said he was walking down 
the street—this was before he joined— 
and he saw a guy walking down the 
street, and, man, did he look great in 
that uniform. He said: That is what I 
want to be. I want to be a marine. 
But one of his family members told 
me at the funeral over in West Vir-
ginia, several days ago, that you need 
to add on there that he thought it 
would attract more women at the same 
time. So he was thinking ahead. He 
was thinking ahead, and I have to 
agree with him: That Marine uniform 
is something quite special, and so are 
the Marines. 
The last thing I would say, on a per-
sonal note, is that the many times that 
I saw Woody, being born in 1923, was a 
reflection of not just him. In his eyes 
and in the way he carried himself, I 
saw 
that 
whole 
‘‘greatest 
genera-
tion’’—from my dad, who was also born 
in 1923, who served in World War II, 
who left this country for a cause great-
er than themselves, who believed in 
protecting our freedoms, who went and 
fought for people they had never met, 
known, or seen. And when you think 
about it in the context of where we are 
today, you think how special that was 
for our Nation, for that ‘‘greatest gen-
eration.’’ 
So when I say good-bye to Woody to-
morrow, when we have the ceremony 
tomorrow, we are saying good-bye and 
thank you to that ‘‘greatest genera-
tion’’ that my dad was a part of. It has 
a lot of nostalgia and remembrance in 
all of our hearts and admiration for 
their passion and love for our country. 
So, tomorrow, as we honor a great 
man and tell his story, Woody will still 
be doing what he has always done, and 
that is inspire us. So here is to a well- 
lived life and a country well-served, 
even long after he wore the Marine uni-
form he loved so dearly. Hoorah. 
Woody, rest peacefully, and thank you. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from West Virginia. 
Mr. MANCHIN. Madam President, I 
know that both of us want to thank 
Speaker NANCY PELOSI, Majority Lead-
er CHUCK SCHUMER, and the ranking 
member 
of 
the 
Republican 
Party, 
MITCH MCCONNELL, and all the people 
who were so instrumental in making 
this happen. 
There have only been 35 people lying 
in state in this Capitol—35 out of mil-
lions and millions and millions. And it 
is a tremendous tribute for us, coming 
from our wonderful, patriotic, beau-
tiful State of West Virginia, to have 
the ‘‘greatest generation’’ being rep-
resented. 
And as we have said, this is not him; 
it is for everybody and, I hope, for all 
the families and anybody who had any-
body who served. 
SHELLEY’s dad was wounded in World 
War II and received a Purple Heart. He 
became our Governor three times and 
was a friend of mine. And my father 
and all of my family served in World 
War II. 
But to have so many people, and 
Woody is doing that for them. Tomor-
row is for every person who has sac-
rificed and given their all and the fami-
lies who have sacrificed also. 
So we want to thank them for mak-
ing that happen. It was a great tribute 
and a great honor, I know, for the fam-

Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Madam Presi-

let me just say how grateful I am to 
have had the chance to be here and to 
hear the West Virginia Senators dis-
cuss this distinguished gentleman and 
to join them in welcoming his family 
to the U.S. Senate. My father, too, was 
a World War II marine, and it is a sad 
thing as the tides of time sweep that 
generation through its dying years.

July 13, 2022 
money scheme to capture and control 
our Supreme Court. 
The last time I rose to shine a light 
on this scheme, I sounded a warning 
about a case then pending at the Su-
preme Court called West Virginia v. 
EPA. I discussed how the Court the 
dark money built was primed to smash 
through 
precedent 
and 
weaponize 
fringe legal theories to deliver for the 
scheme’s big donors. I am sorry but not 
surprised to report that the Supreme 
Court’s Federalist Society Six did ex-
actly what the polluters asked. Not 
only did the Court deliver for polluters, 
it delivered big. 
Before we dive into that, let’s recap 
what we knew going into this case. 
First, the case never should have 
made it this far in the first place. A 
handful of States, with fossil fuel-fund-
ed attorneys general and an armada of 
rightwing 
front 
groups 
that 
were 
propped up by dark money from the 
fossil fuel industry, asked the Supreme 
Court to strike down an EPA rule regu-
lating greenhouse gas emissions from 
existing coal-fired powerplants. The 
problem was that the rule no longer ex-
isted. So there wasn’t actually an oper-
ating EPA rule to challenge, meaning 
there was no constitutional case or 
controversy and no reason for a legiti-
mate Court to entertain the industry’s 
invitation. 
But this is the Court that dark 
money built, and it wasn’t going to let 
this constitutional guardrail stand in 
its way of pleasing the big donors who 
packed the Court. 
Supreme Court precedent had repeat-
edly rejected the polluters’ arguments 
outright. The polluters argued that 
Congress, not the EPA and the so- 
called administrative state, needed to 
do the regulating here. It is a matter of 
common sense that Congress delegates 
authorities to the EPA. It is also well 
known that polluters want to knock 
questions away from expert regulators 
and over to Congress, where their dark 
money political power—also a creature 
of the Court that dark money built— 
can be brought to bear to buy delay 
and obstruction. The power of Congress 
to legislate broadly and let Agency ex-
perts fill in the gaps has been upheld 
for decades against persistent attacks 
from regulated industries. 
Well, no more. No matters of law or 
fact had changed since the last time 
similar questions were answered by the 
Court. The thing that changed is who is 
on the Court: a majority, selected by 
polluters, using hundreds of millions in 
dark money, which brings us to the de-
cision itself. There is good news, and 
there is very, very bad news. 
The good news is that the Court’s 
ruling is actually very narrow as to the 
EPA’s authority to regulate green-
house gases in the power sector. It is 
limited to deliberate generation shift-
ing. So there is lots left to work with, 
and the EPA needs to pull up its socks 
and get to work on regulating carbon 
emissions and other forms of air pollu-
tion. So far, in 18 months of the Biden 
administration, the EPA has managed 
to produce one carbon emissions regu-
lation and not a very strong one at 
that. The EPA needs to move now as 
fast as possible. There is not a second 
to waste. That is the good news. 
The bad news, however, is grim. The 
Federalist Society’s Justices loaded up 
their opinions with polluter talking 
points and hothouse-grown polluter 
legal doctrines, paving the way for pol-
luters to block or delay regulations for 
years to come. 
Start 
with 
the 
polluter 
talking 
points, 
rife 
throughout 
Justice 
Gorsuch’s concurrence, which spends 20 
pages decrying the dangers of govern-
ment regulation. He calls regulators a 
‘‘ruling class of largely unaccountable 
‘ministers.’ ’’ This is not even remotely 
true. If there is an unaccountable rul-
ing class in America right now, it is 
the Court that dark money built and 
the dark money forces behind it. 
Compare that to the EPA. The EPA’s 
leadership is selected by the President, 
approved by the Senate, and can be 
fired at will should they deviate from 
the elected President’s priorities. They 
are all directly accountable, and the 
White House’s Office of Management 
and Budget reviews every EPA regula-
tion to make sure it is consistent with 
the elected President’s priorities. 
Congress retains complete control 
over the EPA’s funding and has entire 
committees dedicated to oversight. It 
is Congress that provided the EPA with 
its instructions through laws like the 
Clean Air Act and the Clean Water 
Acts. Congress also created the Admin-
istrative Procedure Act to assure that 
Agencies like the EPA carry out their 
duties fairly, according to the facts, 
under proper procedure, and under rig-
orous judicial supervision, and we 
passed the Congressional Review Act so 
Congress is able to swiftly undo any 
rules that it doesn’t like. 
In actuality, in the real world, there 
is direct accountability and oversight 
over the EPA by all three branches—by 
all three branches—over the supposedly 
unaccountable ruling class. By com-
parison, Justice Gorsuch and his col-
leagues 
wield 
their 
unaccountable 
power without even the bare minimum 
of an enforceable ethics code. 
This argument by Justice Gorsuch 
may not be founded in fact, but it has 
a foundation. The idea that the biggest 
threat to freedom is an administrative 
state full of unaccountable bureaucrats 
is a longstanding talking point of the 
fossil fuel industry constantly trotted 
out by Republican politicians and fossil 
fuel front groups. Here is just a taste of 
what I mean. 
Here is the Heritage Foundation—a 
key fossil fuel front group: 
[T]he administrative state’s functionaries 
are powerful. . . . They are unelected, un-
known, and, for all practical purposes often 
unaccountable. 
Sound familiar? 
Here is the minority leader himself 
responding to a speech by a Republican 
Senator who is decrying unelected bu-
reaucrats. The minority leader called 
this the ‘‘single biggest problem con-
fronting our country . . . the single 
biggest thing holding this country 
back from reaching its potential.’’ And 
in the wake of this very decision, he 
went back to their go-to talking point: 
‘‘unelected, 
unaccountable 
bureau-
crats.’’ 
It just is not true. The foundation of 
Gorsuch’s screed is not fact; it is polit-
ical fossil fuel talking points, and we 
should not be surprised that those 
talking points made their way into an 
opinion by a Supreme Court Justice. 
That is exactly what the Court that 
dark money built was built for. 
Aside from the talking points are 
legal doctrines hatched in polluter- 
funded hothouse doctrine factories, a 
web of phony think tanks, scheme- 
friendly 
scholars, 
and 
conservative 
conferences designed to cultivate and 
legitimize fringe legal theories—re-
verse engineered to produce the results 
the polluters want. 
One of these is the so-called major 
questions 
doctrine, 
which—guess 
what—makes its maiden appearance in 
West Virginia v. EPA. 
Let’s look at how the major ques-
tions doctrine traveled from the doc-
trine factory into a Supreme Court de-
cision. 
The Trump administration, fully in 
tow to the fossil fuel industry, took 
this rare specimen of legal theory and 
pumped it up into a powerful weapon 
against the functioning of the Federal 
Government. From day one, Trump’s 
top adviser, Steve Bannon, vowed that 
the Trump administration would carry 
out the ‘‘deconstruction of the admin-
istrative state.’’ Trump’s White House 
Counsel Don McGahn—the same Don 
McGahn who oversaw the confirmation 
of the scheme’s hand-picked Justices— 
admitted that the ‘‘judicial selection 
and the deregulation effort are really 
the flip side of the same coin.’’ 
Think about that. In his own words, 
the Trump White House had a ‘‘larger 
plan’’ to wipe out government regula-
tions by using judges. 
For 4 years, the Trump lawyers ar-
gued in court for this major questions 
doctrine that had been previously 
unmentioned in any Supreme Court de-
cision. The Trump team urged courts 
to deploy the doctrine to strike down 
Agency laws, including in this case, 
West Virginia v. EPA. Now, while the 
Court had never mentioned the doc-
trine, it had been mentioned. Brett 
Kavanaugh, on the DC Circuit, did 
while he was auditioning himself for a 
seat on the Supreme Court, to catch 
the eye of the scheme donors and to 
telegraph to them how eager he was to 
do their bidding. Kavanaugh wrote a 
dissent in a case about net neutrality— 
a case with many of the scheme’s dark 
money front groups—Cato, Competitive 
Enterprise 
Institute, 
Pacific 
Legal 
Foundation—present as amici. They 
were 
the 
right 
audience 
for 
Kavanaugh’s ‘‘major questions’’ audi-
tion tape, and he aimed to please.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S3265 
July 13, 2022 
Payday for scheme donors came in 
West Virginia v. EPA. At least 14 pol-
luter front group amici showed up to 
push in chorus for their major ques-
tions doctrine—the usual suspects— 
funded by fossil fuel dark money, like 
Cato, the Koch flagship Americans for 
Prosperity, and the Competitive Enter-
prise Institute. 
Justice Gorsuch’s concurrence is rife 
with citations legitimizing doctrine 
factory ‘‘scholarship.’’ He cites articles 
written by the founder and president of 
the Free State Foundation, a member 
of the dark money State Policy Net-
work; by a member of the dark money 
Federalist 
Society’s 
Administrative 
Law Group executive committee; and 
by the former president of the Koch- 
funded American Enterprise Institute. 
The scheme is all about boosting cor-
porate power and rolling back govern-
ment regulations. It is not just about 
building a dark money Court; it is 
about front groups by the dozen which 
operate in coordinated flotillas; it is 
about faux scholarship—reverse-engi-
neered in a parallel universe of faux 
academia—to give polluters power over 
government; and it is about more than 
a half a billion dollars in dark money 
spent to set up and run the whole sham 
enterprise. 
The attack on regulation began with 
an effort to revive the so-called non-
delegation doctrine discarded by the 
Supreme Court almost 100 years ago. 
Like the major questions doctrine, the 
nondelegation doctrine allowed courts 
to strike down Agency rules when Con-
gress wasn’t explicit enough in dele-
gating 
power. 
Polluters 
loved 
it. 
Scheme front groups like the Cato In-
stitute—propped up by the dark money 
from the fossil fuel billionaire Koch 
family 
and 
from 
companies 
like 
ExxonMobil—sponsored research that 
argued for reviving the nondelegation 
doctrine. They organized conferences 
and seminars, lobbied legislators, and 
funded law groups designed to spread 
the idea far and wide. 
But ‘‘major questions’’ had one ad-
vantage. Years ago, on the DC Circuit 
Court of Appeals, Justice Breyer had 
used those two words once, in passing, 
in a lengthy law review article. They 
could seize that camouflage. And guess 
what. ‘‘Major questions’’ is just ‘‘non-
delegation’’ in disguise. If you don’t be-
lieve me, let’s go back to Justice 
Gorsuch in a concurrence from another 
case earlier this year: 
[T]he major questions doctrine is closely 
related to what is sometimes called the non-
delegation doctrine. Indeed, for decades, 
courts have cited the nondelegation doctrine 
as a reason to apply the major questions doc-
trine. . . . Whichever the doctrine, the point 
is the same. 
Indeed. The point is that a Court cap-
tured by polluter interests will find 
any way it can to import polluter doc-
trine—cooked up in polluter-funded 
doctrine factories—into the law of the 
land, and that is just what they just 
did in West Virginia v. EPA. For the 
polluters, mission accomplished. 
The Court that dark money built had 
already wreaked havoc in our law. 
Even before they got to six, they had 
run up 80 5-to-4 partisan decisions ben-
efiting big Republican donor inter-
ests—80 5-to-4 partisan decisions bene-
fiting big Republican donor interests. 
Now with six Justices, they have set 
about destroying precedent left and 
right, taking away the constitutional 
right of women to control their own re-
productive decisions, blocking efforts 
to reduce gun violence, and now adopt-
ing new theories to empower polluters 
against public health regulation. 
The FedSoc Six’s hatred for regula-
tion isn’t shared much outside the pol-
luter-funded parallel universe. Most 
Americans 
appreciate 
regulations. 
They appreciate regulations that help 
make sure food and water are safe, that 
their air is clean to breathe, that medi-
cines actually work, that markets op-
erate honestly, that investors have real 
information, and that car seats protect 
you in a car wreck. The American peo-
ple are right to sense that something is 
deeply amiss at the U.S. Supreme 
Court. 
A captured Court presents an unprec-
edented 
challenge 
to 
the 
other 
branches of government, but we aren’t 
helpless. 
First, we need to start telling the 
truth about what is going on. The pat-
tern is unmistakable, and people across 
the country need to understand this is 
not right; this is not normal. We can 
also pass laws like my DISCLOSE Act, 
which I hope will be coming up for a 
vote shortly, to shine light on the dark 
money donors who captured our Court 
in a long scheme. 
We can require real ethics require-
ments for Supreme Court Justices, just 
like all other Federal judges already 
have. Remember the ongoing ethics in-
vestigations against Judge Kavanaugh? 
They were dropped, not because they 
were resolved, not because they ended, 
not because he was found not culpable; 
they 
were 
dropped 
against 
Judge 
Kavanaugh because he escaped to the 
Supreme Court, where ethics investiga-
tions don’t exist, so they had to shut 
down the ongoing investigations. That 
is a terrible signal. 
We can also require Justices to re-
port gifts and hospitality, as all other 
judges do and all senior government of-
ficials do in the executive and legisla-
tive branches. 
There are many ways to push back 
against the new ‘‘ruling class’’ of ‘‘un-
accountable ministers’’ occupying the 
captured Court and to assure the 
American people that fairness and jus-
tice, and not the Court’s deep-pocketed 
special interest friends, are what drives 
Court decisions. 
There is a lot to be done, and we need 
to begin. To be continued.

bombing in Afghanistan in August 2021. 
There being no objection, the mate-

RECORD, as follows: 
ACTS–SCK–DO 
Subject: Findings and Recommendation—At-
tack Against U.S. Forces Conducting 
NEO at Hamid Karzai International Air-
port on 26 August 2021 
(i) Throughout the NEO, USFOR–A FWD 
spent a significant amount of time coordi-
nating special evacuation requests on behalf 
of the interagency, congressional representa-
tives and senators, and the White House (ex-
hibits 13, 15, 18, 20, 21, 22). The USFOR–A 
FWD staff estimated they received over 4000 
such requests during the nine days ECPs 
were operating (exhibits 13, 20, 21, 22). (TEXT 
REDACTED) USFOR–A FWD Deputy Com-
manding General, referred to these evacuees 
as privileged personnel exhibit 21). USFOR–A 
FWD’s (TEXT REDACTED) and Embassy 
(TEXT REDACTED) worked with subordi-
nate staffs to action many of these requests. 
They would coordinate with the potential 
evacuees for challenge and password or other 
identification, visit gates, seek out the evac-
uees, physically pull them from the crowd, 
and get them processed through DoS and the 
Evacuation Control Center (ECC} (exhibits 
17, 20, 22, 100, 108, 122). 
(ii) (TEXT REDACTED) along with mem-
bers of the JTF–CR staff, were primarily re-
sponsible for coordinating multi-national ac-
tivities and requests through the Multi-Na-
tional Coordination Cell (MNCC) (exhibits 15, 
18, 20, 21, 22). The MNCC met daily, along 
with other Ambassador groups, to coordinate 
air and lift requirements for partner nations, 
and Afghans sponsored by those nations to 
depart (exhibits 20, 21, 22). Many of the other 
nations working out of HKIA and conducting 
NEO were completely dependent on the U.S. 
for airlift (exhibit 21). USFOR–A FWD, with 
JTF–CR, formed the International Coordina-
tion Cell (ICC), which was a broader forum 
for handling the extensive privileged per-
sons’ requests from partner nations (exhibit 
21). (TEXT REDACTED) USSFOR–A FWD 
Chief of Staff, and Commander. 3/10 IBCT, 
was responsible for working these issues (ex-
hibits 21, 126). The ICC also provided a forum 
to synchronize bulk movement and arrival of 
passport holders or cleared individuals from 
all nations through South Gate (exhibit 126). 
This included building and allocating move-
ment tables and coordinating with Taliban 
commanders for passage of vehicles (exhibit 
126). (TEXT REDACTED) coordinated with 1/ 
82 IBCTs (TEXT REDACTED) to request TF 
Wild Boar support for receiving these coordi-
nated arrivals at the various gates (exhibit 
247). TF Polar Bear was a force on the ground

at HKIA scheduled to conduct relief in place/ 
transfer of authority (RIP/TOA) with TF 
Wild Boar. The RIP was delayed based on 
conditions, to retain both forces for the ap-
proaching NEO (exhibit 126). After 17 August, 
both forces were at HKIA and made TACON 
to 1/82 IBCT during the NEO (exhibits 
128,247). TF Polar Bear operated as the HKIA 
quick reaction force (QRF) and had liaison 
officers (LNO) in the JTF–CR Joint Oper-
ations Center (JOC) (exhibit 247). TF Wild 
Boar also served as a QRF, but executed tar-
geted recovery missions with the MNCC and 
ICC when operations permitted (exhibits 10, 
126, 247). 
(iii) USFOR–A FWD was responsible for co-
ordination with adjacent military, para-
military, and former adversary forces (exhib-
its 13, 20, 21, 22, 23). On 16 August, RADM 
Vasely coordinated with other governmental 
agencies (OGA) for NSU assistance with air-
field security. NSU took over large swaths of 
the perimeter on the South, West, and North 
of HKIA (exhibits 13, 15, 181,20, 21, 22, 23). 
Shortly after, RADM Vasely began coordi-
nating with (TEXT REDACTED) the regional 
Taliban Commander and Taliban-designated 
LNO, for Taliban assistance with clearing 
the airfield and providing security along the 
southern perimeter of HKIA (exhibits 13, 15, 
18, 20, 21, 22, 23). Finally, RADM Vasely and 
his staff coordinated with the Turkish Mili-
tary to relieve them of security and airfield 
operations responsibilities (exhibits 13, 15, 18, 
21). 
(iv) USFOR–A FWD, and subordinate units, 
continued to coordinate with the Taliban 
throughout the NEO, however, only USFOR– 
A FWD and MG Donahue had authority to 
release threat reporting to the Taliban (ex-
hibits 13, 15, 18, 20, 21, 22, 23). Prior to the 
Abbey Gate attack, on 25–26 August, USFOR– 
A FWD was continuously updating the 
Taliban with information necessary to im-
prove their security posture and provide ef-
fective screening for exposed forces at the 
gates (exhibits 13, 15, 18, 20, 21, 22, 23). 
USFOR–A FWD and MG Donahue frequently 
provided updates in person to the Taliban at 
the South Terminal and by phone (exhibits 
13, 21, 23, 125). 
(3) Task Force—Medical (TF MED). 
(a) TF MED was initially located at 
Bagram Air Base and served as the most ca-
pable US Role Ill medical facility in Afghan-
istan (exhibits 14, 131). On approximately 15 
June, the facility at Bagram closed and TF 
MED moved to North HKIA to continue to 
provide medical support to remaining U.S. 
Forces, but with a reduced capability {exhib-
its 14, 128, 131). TF MED co-located with Nor-
wegian medical personnel at the HKIA Role 
II military treatment facility (exhibit 14, 128, 
131). (TEXT REDACTED) USAF, commanded 
TF MED during the period of the move to 
HKIA and throughout the NEO (exhibits 14, 
131). The facility at HKIA was a Role II En-
hanced (Role 11–E), with lab, pharmacy, two 
operating rooms (ORs), and computed tomog-
raphy (en scan capability (exhibits 14, 128, 
131). 
(b) During the NEO, the capabilities of this 
facility swelled, eventually supported by 
nine surgical teams arriving 20–23 August 
(exhibits 131). These teams came from var-
ious locations and nations: one Norwegian 
Special Operations Surgical Team (SOST), 
two 
U.S. 
SOSTs, 
two 
U.S. 
Forward 
Resuscitative Surgical Detachments (FRSD), 
surgical teams organic to TF MED, one U.K. 
Military surgical team, and those organic to 
the 82nd, which operated from the Role II at 
Camp Alvarado (exhibits 14, 128, 131, 149). In 
addition to surgical teams, TF MED also had 
an Aeromedical Evacuation Liaison Team 
(AELT), responsible for medical airlift from 
HKIA 
rearward. 
Io 
synchronize 
efforts, 
(TEXT REDACTED) conducted daily huddles 
with the various contingents to discuss 
threat reporting, posturing medical assets 
and supplies, and patient flow (exhibits 131, 
149). TF MED created and exercised a mass 
casualty (MASCAL) plan for medical re-
sponse in June 2021, which included Nor-
wegian capabiltties and participation (exhib-
its 14, 131). During the NEO, (TEXT RE-
DACTED) made the decision to consolidate 
higher-level medical care at the Role II–E an 
not push any assets to the gates (exhibit 131). 
The units at the gates had medics/corpsmen 
and the Role I capability had already pushed 
forward (exhibits 66, 100, 104). 
(c) On 25–26 August, Role II–E personnel 
were aware of increased credible reporting 
for a vehicle-borne improvised explosive de-
vice (VBIED) or suicide vest IED (SVIED) at 
a gate (exhibits 14, 131). The USFOR–A FWD 
(TEXT 
REDACTED) 
contacted 
approxi-
mately 
26 
August 
and 
warned 
him 
a 
MASCAL event was imminent exhibit 131). 
(TEXT REDACTED) placed medics and sur-
gical teams on stand-by until 1700, and then 
released them on immediate recall (exhibit 
14, 131). At the time of the blast (TEXT RE-
DACTED) was in the Joint Operations Cen-
ter (JOC) and a Role I facility reported sig-
nificant numbers of casualties, which trig-
gered the MASCAL response (exhibit 131). 
(TEXT REDACTED) Trauma Team Leader, 
was in the emergency room (ER) and did not 
hear the blast, but was notified within min-
utes to prepare for a MASCAL (exhibit 128). 
TF MED received its first patient within 12 
minutes and treated patients for the next 10– 
12 hours (exhibits 14, 128 131, 149). The most 
seriously wounded patients arrived first, a 
result of proper triage at the Role I facilities 
and casualty collection points (CCPs) (exhib-
its 14, 128, 131 14Q). The Role II–E expanded 
its operating room to accommodate four pa-
tients at a time and used hallway space to 
provide additional required care (exhibits 
128, 131, 149). Patients with less severe inju-
ries, not requiring immediate care, were 
staged outsde or in ambulances with medics 
to stabilize injuries (exhibits 14, 128, 131, 149). 
Of the 13 killed in action (KIA), every med-
ical professional interviewed concluded that 
no amount of additional measures, equip-
ment, or treatment could have saved their 
lives (exhibits 14, 128, 131, 149). By approxi-
mately 0700 on 27 August, the Role II–E was 
empty of patients, with three flights taking 
personnel to Qatar or Germany, to include 19 
U.S. causalities (exhibit 14, 131, 236). The 
Role II–E had a small morgue, capable of 
handling only eight deceased (exhibits 68, 
131). Because the MASCAL overwhelmed the 
hospital morgue capacity, the KIA were 
moved to a pre-coordinated refrigerated 
shipping container for preparation and move-
ment back to continental U.S. (CONUS) (ex-
hibit 68, 131). 
(4) JTF–CR. 
(a) JTF–CR is a command and control or-
ganization derived from a joint manning doc-
ument, manned by TF 51/5th Marine Expedi-
tionary Brigade (MEB) personnel, stationed 
in Bahrain, and augmented with personnel 
from the CENTCOM area of responsibility 
(AOR) (exhibits 15, 17, 18). TF 51/5th MEB 
began initial planning in April for the poten-
tial NEO, convened two operational planning 
teams, 
coordinated 
with 
USFOR–A, 
CENTCOM, and MARCENT, and attended op-
erations 
and 
intelligence 
updates 
with 
USFOR–A FWD (exhibits 15, 17, 18). JTF–CR 
activated in May and was TACON to USFOR– 
A FWD for NEO planning (exhibits 15, 17, 18). 
In May and June, JTF–CR conducted a pre- 
deployment site survey (POSS) to Afghani-
stan to assess possible evacuation sites and 
coordinate with stakeholders, specifically 
USEK (exhibits 15, 17, 18). Initial planning 
accounted for two aerial ports of embar-
kation (APOEs), HKIA and Bagram Air Base. 
In early June, Bagram transitioned to 
ANDSF control and was no longer considered 
for planning (exhibits 15, 17, 18). JTF–CR de-
ployed three LNOs forward in May, along 
with a small three person quartering party 
to HKIA in late May to set conditions for a 
possible NEO (exhibit 15, 18). 
(b) JTF–CR deployed to HKIA on 19 July, 
starting with the Early Entry Assistance 
Team (EEAT), followed by the JTF–CR staff 
as a robust quartering party (exhibit 15}. The 
staff continued to coordinate with USEK 
while in Afghanistan, in an attempt to plan 
the NEO, but to little effect (exhibit 18). 
With the fall of Afghanistan districts to the 
Taliban throughout July and August, the 
JTF–CR continuously took steps to prepare 
HKIA for NEO, such as building supply 
stocks on HKIA to handle evacuees’ basic 
needs (exhibit 18). During early August, DoS 
began processing Special Immigrant Visas 
(SIVs) and sending out evacuees by commer-
cial air. They evacuated approximately 750 
before the NEO was called on 13 August (ex-
hibits 18, 8, 24). 
(c) During execution of the NEO, JTF–CR 
had initial responsibility for securing HKIA 
and processing evacuees designated eligible 
by DoS (exhibits 15, 17, 18). In the early 
morning hours of 14 August, 24th MEU ar-
rived with nearly 200 personnel that included 
some of the headquarters staff, snipers, ECC 
personnel, and a single rifle company (exhib-
its 15, 100, 102, 104). At this time, elements of 
TF Polar Bear and TF Wild Boar, who were 
subordinate elements of 3/10 IBCT providing 
security for USEK and HKIA, arrived to 
HKIA (exhibits 15, 126, 247). 24th MEU later 
closed additional capability during 14 Au-
gust, with a similar mix of personnel as the 
first lift (exhibits 15, 100, 102, 104). The Turk-
ish Military was providing security on North 
HKIA, with approximately 400 troops, and 
the ANDSF were securing the southern pe-
rimeter of HKIA, specifically the routes into 
the commercial terminals (exhibit 15). Ap-
proximately a battalion of U.K. Forces was 
also facilitating their own evacuation oper-
ations out of the airport (exhibits 15, 18, 126). 
U.S. Air Force C–17s were slow to arrive 
throughout 14–15 August (exhibit 15). By the 
end of 14 August, there were approximately 
1600 U.S. and coalition forces at HKIA (ex-
hibits 13, 15, 18). 
(i) On 15 August, Afghanistan’s President 
Ghani departed Kabul in a helicopter, aban-
doning the capital and the government. Soon 
after, ANDSF leaders also fled (exhibits 13, 
15, 18, 20, 21, 22, 23). This precipitated the dis-
solution of the ANDSF, leaving the southern 
perimeter of the airport unsecured. Simulta-
neously, USEK was evacuating personnel to 
HKIA (exhibits 13, 15, 18, 20, 21, 22, 23). 
Ghani’s departure and the Embassy evacu-
ation created a panic in the Kabul popu-
lation, and civilians began to rush the air-
field in an attempt to board departing or sta-
tionary aircraft (exhibits 13, 15, 18, 20, 21, 22, 
23). On three separate occasions, on 15 Au-
gust and into the hours of darkness of 16 Au-
gust, large crowds pushed across the HKIA 
flight line and near the North HKIA foot-
print, forcing JTF–CR to empty their oper-
ations center of personnel to push back the 
crowds (exhibits 15, 18). The presence of large 
crowds of civilians on the runways halted air 
operations continuously throughout 16 Au-
gust. 
(ii) Three solutions to the airfield security 
problem manifested during the next 24–48 
hours. 1/82 IBCT forces arrived on C–17s dur-
ing the hours of darkness on 15–16 August, 
and JTF–CR immediately tasked them with 
airfield security (exhibit 15). On 16 August, 
an OGA offered to bring the NSU’s approxi-
mately 1200–1300 personnel to provide secu-
rity at HKIA (on the condition of evacuating 
NSU families) (exhibits 13, 15, 18, 21, 23).

Later on 16 August, the Taliban offered to 
help remove civilians from the airfield. 
RADM Vasely accepted the Taliban’s offer, 
and Taliban forces began clearing and secur-
ing the airfield (exhibits 15, 18, 21, 23). The 
addition of these three forces was sufficient 
to clear the runway and resume flight oper-
ations (exhibits 15, 18). 
(iii) Once the perimeter was reestablished 
on 16 and 17 August, the Taliban took the 
South, the NSU took the North and West, 
and 1/82nd took the West and overall security 
responsibilities (exhibits 15, 18, 53, 103). JTF– 
CR continued to manage the flow of combat 
forces into HKIA and into the line to hold 
the tenuous status quo (exhibits 15, 18, 53, 
103). Force flow over the next two days deliv-
ered the remainder of the 1/82 IBCT, all of 
the 24th MEU Command Element, the re-
mainder of 1/8 Marines, the MEU Combat Lo-
gistics Battalion (CLB), 2/1 Marines with 
enablers from the CENTCOM SPMAGTF, and 
the TAC of the 82nd Airborne Division (ex-
hibits 15, 18, 53, 100, 102, 104, 121, 125). JTF–CR 
had TACON of all forces providing security 
of 
HKIA 
until 
17 
August, 
when 
Gen 
McKenzie, CENTCOM Commander, tasked 
the 82nd Airborne Division with security of 
HKIA (exhibits 8, 10, 11, 13, 15, 18, 21, 238). The 
JTF–CR retained sole responsibility of NEO 
tasks and duties (exhibits 10, 11, 15, 18, 138, 
238). 
(d) During the execution of NEO, the JTF– 
CR managed three critical tasks at the JTF 
level or through its subordinate units: Gate 
Operations, ECC, and the Multi-National Co-
ordination Cell (exhibits 15, 17, 18). 
(i) After being relieved of airfield security 
duties, 1/8 Marines (24th MEU) occupied 
North and East Gates, and 2/1 Marines 
(SPMAGTF) occupied Abbey Gate (exhibits 
53, 103). From 19–26 August, these gates were 
used to process and screen tens of thousands 
of civilian evacuees (exhibits 15, 18). Com-
manders at each gate exercised their author-
ity to open or close their respective gates, as 
they deemed appropriate, according to the 
situation on the ground (exhibits 15, 53, 103). 
The JTF–CR Commander retained the au-
thority to reopen a gate if the gate com-
mander had closed it due to the threat envi-
ronment or possible attack (exhibits 15, 18, 
103). However, there was tremendous pres-
sure from the strategic level (Combatant 
Command (CCMD), Joint Staff (JS), White 
House) to continue to process and evacuate 
civilians to the maximum extent possible, so 
gate closures were done rarely, locally, and 
temporarily (exhibits 15, 18, 53, 56, 77, 103, 
121). For example, Abbey Gate did not phys-
ically close until the night of 26 August (ex-
hibit 53). JTF–CR’s management of gate op-
erations also entailed reacting to the over-
whelming number of special requests to se-
cure specific evacuees from gates (exhibits 
13, 15, 17, 20, 21, 22). Members of the USFOR– 
A FWD, JTF–CR, MEU, 1/8, and 2/1 staffs 
were constantly engaged in retrieving spe-
cially requested individuals from the gates, 
with the lower echelons doing so on behalf of 
JTF–CR (exhibits 13, 15, 18, 20, 21, 22, 23, 76, 
108, 122). 
(ii) The JTF–CR Commander was respon-
sible for deciding when to close Abbey Gate 
to facilitate the Joint Tactical Exfiltration 
(JTE) (exhibits 13, 15, 17, 18, 22). Initially, the 
JTF–CR sought to close the gate on the 
evening of 25 August (exhibits 18, 53, 77, 89, 
126). However, U.K. Forces were still oper-
ating at the Barron Hotel and could not 
meet this timeline (exhibits 15, 18, 53, 77, 89, 
126.). If the JTF–CR Commander decided to 
close Abbey Gate while U.K. Forces were 
still processing evacuees, it would have iso-
lated them at the Barron Hotel. This would 
have affected the JTE, as the JTF–CR Com-
mander estimated it would take 24–48 hours 
to clear the outer corridor and facilitate 
U.K. Forces’ passage of lines into HKIA (ex-
hibits 15, 18). Additionally, if the JTF–CR 
closed Abbey Gate early, the crowds likely 
would have breached the airfield, which 
posed a significant risk to mission and risk 
to force (exhibits 15, 18). 
(iii) The 24th MEU established the ECC at 
the passenger (PAX) Terminal in North 
HKIA (exhibits 15, 18, 100, 101, 102). Evacuees 
waiting for flights consistently saturated 
this area, creating a security concern (exhib-
its 100, 101). As a result, JTF–CR tasked sub-
ordinate units to provide security forces at 
the PAX Terminal to ensure evacuees did 
not attempt to board the wrong flights or 
move into the compounds on North HKIA 
(exhibits 15, 18, 101). 
(iv) As the lead for NEO, JTF–CR hosted 
the MNCC (exhibits 18, 21, 145). At the MNCC, 
JTF–CR coordinated the requirements of the 
multi-national partners to evacuate per-
sonnel (exhibits 18, 21). This usually included 
manifesting flights and coordinating appro-
priate arrival destinations based on the sta-
tus of evacuees (exhibits 18, 21).

ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS 
TRIBUTE TO IGOR BABAILOV 
∑ Mrs. BLACKBURN. Madam Presi-
dent, each year, the Ellis Island Honors 
Society 
recognizes 
individuals 
who 
have proved their commitment to our 
Nation through outstanding achieve-
ment in industry, education, entertain-
ment, and the arts. 
Today, I have the honor of congratu-
lating my friend and fellow Tennessean 
Igor Babailov, one of this year’s recipi-
ents of the Ellis Island Medal of Honor. 
Igor has earned a very special place in 
American culture through his work in 
philanthropy and the arts. A celebrated 
portraitist, he has immortalized on 
canvas Presidents, dignitaries, royalty, 
and even three Popes, and earned the 
trust of the world’s most important cu-
rators. His philanthropic endeavors 
have changed the lives of veterans and 
helped children realize their full poten-
tial. 
On behalf of the State of Tennessee, 
I offer my heartfelt congratulations to 
Igor and thank him for using his tal-
ents to make America a more diverse, 
innovative, and beautiful place to call 
home.∑ 
f 
TRIBUTE TO LAMAR ROGERS 
∑ Mrs. BLACKBURN. Madam Presi-
dent, it is my honor to congratulate 
Coach Lamar Rogers of Clarkrange, 
TN, on winning the Fred Russell Life-
time Achievement Award and joining 
the distinguished ranks of the National 
Federation of State High School Asso-
ciations Hall of Fame. 
Over the course of his long career, he 
has enriched the lives of young female 
athletes by helping them reach their 
highest potential. For 46 years, Coach 
Rogers has served as the architect of 
one of the most impressive and well-re-
spected girls basketball programs in 
the Volunteer State, boasting a 1,289– 
290 record and eight Tennessee Sec-
ondary School Athletic Association 
State championships. He is also re-
vered—and feared—as the winningest 
high school girls basketball coach in 
Tennessee. 
But more importantly, he is a men-
tor, a friend, and an inspiration to the 
next generation of athletes and edu-
cators, and I consider it my privilege 
to recognize him for his leadership. 
Congratulations, Coach.∑ 
f 
TRIBUTE TO ADOLPH L. ‘‘BOB’’ 
HIRSCH 
∑ Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Madam Presi-
dent, today I rise to recognize Mr. Ad-
olph ‘‘Bob’’ Hirsch, a remarkable man 
and World War II veteran who turns 100 
on July 23, 2022. 
In September 1942, at the age of 20, 
Mr. Hirsch enlisted in the U.S. Coast 
Guard. He would go on to attain the 
rank of seaman first class, serving this 
Nation honorably throughout World 
War II until 1945. During this time, Mr. 
Hirsch served as a gunner’s mate on 
the Coast Guard Patrol Frigate Annap-
olis. It was aboard that vessel in the 
American theater of operations that 
Mr. Hirsch was engaged in combat ac-
tion against hostile enemy submarine 
forces. 
In September 1945, Mr. Hirsch was 
also involved in a daring rescue while 
serving on the Annapolis. After the 
Steamship Prince George caught fire in 
Ketchikan, AK, several U.S. Coast 
Guard vessels responded to the inci-
dent, including the Annapolis. Mr. 
Hirsch was engaged in lifesaving and 
port clearance operations, further dem-
onstrating his remarkable bravery. 
Following his time in the Coast 
Guard, Mr. Hirsch continued his out-
standing legacy of service. He joined 
the New York City Police Department 
and served that city honorably for over 
20 years. Since 1976, Mr. Hirsch has re-
sided in Bethlehem, CT, and we are 
proud he has chosen to call our great 
State home. 
Mr. Hirsch’s tireless service will be 
an enduring legacy. I applaud his many 
accomplishments and hope my col-
leagues will join me in congratulating 
Mr. Bob Hirsch on this milestone of his 
100th birthday.∑

REMEMBERING JACK GRANEY 
∑ Mr. BROWN. Madam President, I ask 
my colleagues to join me in honoring 
Jack Graney, Cleveland Indians player 
and broadcaster, as he is posthumously 
awarded the Ford C. Frick Award by 
the Baseball Hall of Fame on July 23, 
2022. 
Jack Graney was born on June 10, 
1886, in St. Thomas, Ontario, Canada, 
but his professional career on the base-
ball diamond began with the Cleveland 
Naps in 1908. Over his 14-year Major 
League career, Jack led the American 
League in walks during the 1917 and 
1919 seasons and played in three World 
Series games, helping the Naps to vic-
tory in 1920. His daughter fondly re-
members growing up on the road and

watching her father in action on the 
field. 
Jack spent each of his seasons in 
Major League Baseball with Cleveland. 
After 14 seasons, Jack retired with 1,178 
hits, 420 runs batted in, and a career 
.250 batting average. 
Jack made baseball history over the 
course of his career; he was the first at 
bat against Babe Ruth in the big 
leagues, the first 20th century big 
league player to bat with a number on 
his uniform, and the first to transition 
from player to broadcaster. 
In 1932, Jack returned to baseball 
when he joined WHK-AM, which had 
just 
began 
broadcasting 
Cleveland 
games. He would go on to be the voice 
of the Cleveland Indians for the next 22 
years. Rumor had it, when the Indians 
played, you could hear Jack’s voice 
echoing through the streets of Cleve-
land. While radio was only local at the 
time, Jack was committed to providing 
a narrative of every single game to 
Cleveland fans. During away games, he 
broadcasted from Cleveland, using the 
ticker-tape that came through from 
the live game. 
Jack’s detailed descriptions of plays, 
stadiums, and fans brought the game 
to life. Throughout his career, he 
broadcasted for various Cleveland sta-
tions and with different partners. In 
1935, he commentated on the World Se-
ries and the All-Star Game for national 
audiences. 
Jack’s final broadcast aired in 1953. 
For more than 20 years, Jack brought 
baseball to Cleveland fans. On April 20, 
1978, Jack passed away at age 91. His 
legacy lives on today through his fam-
ily and through all those he inspired to 
love America’s game and to pass on 
that love to their own children and 
grandchildren. 
In 2012, Jack was posthumously in-
ducted into the Cleveland Baseball Hall 
of Fame for his tenure as a player. And 
this month, the Baseball Hall of Fame 
will present the Ford C. Frick Award 
to Jack for his major contributions to 
baseball. Recipients are chosen based 
on their commitment to excellence, 
quality of broadcasting abilities, rev-
erence within the game, popularity 
with fans, and recognition by peers. 
Jack embodied each of these quali-
ties and made our city proud. Today, 
we celebrate his contributions to base-
ball, his commitment to Cleveland, and 
his extraordinary life.∑

TRIBUTE TO ROLAND J. BABIN 
∑ Mr. CASSIDY. Madam President, I 
rise today to express my appreciation 
for and offer my sincere congratula-
tions to a dedicated public servant, Mr. 
Roland J. Babin, on his retirement 
after 67 years of service for the Lou-
isiana Department of Transportation 
and Development. Mr. Babin com-
menced his career as a student worker 
in 1955. He currently serves as the dis-
trictwide maintenance specialist for 
the department’s Acadian region, mak-
ing him the department’s and the State 
of Louisiana’s longest actively serving 
employee. 
During his long tenure, Mr. Babin 
served the department and the State in 
a number of ways, from working as an 
engineer aide I to an engineer techni-
cian VII. He has supervised and trained 
countless construction and mainte-
nance personnel over the years, mak-
ing an impact on the department that 
will last for years to come. Even at 85 
years old, Mr. Babin can be found on a 
job site operating a shovel, measuring 
tools, a roller behind a hot mix paver, 
or a vibratory compactor. Mr. Babin 
also recorded daily journal entries, dat-
ing back to 1970, narrating the depart-
ment’s construction and maintenance 
projects, hurricanes, ice storms, other 
emergency 
responses, 
and 
personal 
anecdotes from his career. In 2017, Mr. 
Babin was a recipient of the Charles E. 
Dunbar, 
Jr., 
Career 
Civil 
Service 
Award, the highest honor awarded to 
classified Louisiana State employees 
for outstanding and selfless service for 
the Louisianan community. 
His tireless work throughout the 
years has ensured that the Louisiana 
Department of Transportation and De-
velopment will continue to serve Lou-
isiana for decades to come. The depart-
ment and the State of Louisiana have 
benefited greatly from his leadership 
and contributions, and his legacy will 
not be soon forgotten. I personally 
thank Mr. Babin for his notable service 
and congratulate him on his well-de-
served retirement.∑ 
f 
TRIBUTE TO MIKE BURRESS 
∑ Mr. PAUL. Madam President, I rise 
today to honor the career of Mike 
Burress for his dedicated service to bet-
ter the Commonwealth of Kentucky. In 
his over 37 years with the Lincoln Trail 
Area 
Development 
District 
admin-
istering and writing grants, Mike has 
worked tirelessly to better our cities 
and communities. 
Mike started his career as a commu-
nity development adviser, providing di-
rect support and coordination to the 
regional planning and development 
process. A few short years later, Mike 
was promoted to associate director for 
community 
and 
economic 
develop-
ment, where he was responsible for the 
day-to-day supervision and coordina-
tion of the community development de-
partment. 
In the summer of 1998, Mike was pro-
moted to the district’s deputy director, 
primarily overseeing community and 
economic development throughout the 
eight-county region. In 2018, the Lin-
coln Trail Area Development District 
board of directors selected Mike to be-
come the district’s fifth executive di-
rector. 
In the last 4 years, his leadership and 
advocacy as executive director have 
benefited area development districts 
throughout the State. Mike’s ongoing 
work with local, State, and Federal 
delegations 
as 
well 
as 
nongovern-
mental organizations highlights the es-
sential work the area development dis-
tricts do in assisting their constitu-
ents. 
Mike and his wife Judy are Hardin 
County natives with three children and 
two grandchildren. I am proud to sa-
lute and thank Mike for a remarkable 
career of dedication to his commu-
nity.∑

RECOGNIZING HILLCO 
TECHNOLOGIES, INC. 
∑ Mr. RISCH. Madam President, as a 
member and former chairman of the 
Senate Committee on Small Business 
and Entrepreneurship, each month I 
recognize and celebrate the American 
entrepreneurial spirit by highlighting 
the success of a small business in my 
home State of Idaho. Today, I am 
pleased to honor Hillco Technologies, 
Inc., as the Idaho Small Business of the 
Month for July 2022. 
In the 1950s, Wallace ‘‘Arlie’’ Hill, a 
longtime resident of Nezperce, designed 
the first hydraulic foldup harrow cart 
for his own family farm. Shortly there-
after, he built them for his neighbors 
and eventually for farmers all across 
North America before opening Hillco, 
Inc., in 1963. Arlie Hill became famous 
for his harrow, springtooth, and packer 
cart designs and various multi-unit 
hitches for drills and plows which he 
tinkered with until his mid-80s. 
Located amongst the rolling hills of 
Idaho’s Camas Prairie, the Hill family 
is familiar with how critical combine 
leveling systems are for effective hill-
side harvesting. When tractor manufac-
turers stopped supplying leveling sys-
tems in the 1990s, Hillco stepped in to 
fill the gap in the market. In 1993, the 
first Hillco, Inc., leveling system rolled 
off the production floor for a Case-IH 
combine followed by the first leveling 
system for a John Deere combine in 
1998. In 2021, Hillco manufactured their 
2,500th leveler. 
Now called Hillco Technologies, Inc., 
and owned by Lenny Hill, Arlie’s son, 
their team of 55 employees pride them-
selves on their collaborative effort to 
design, test, and market methods and 
mechanisms that advance farming and 
agricultural practices from start to fin-
ish. They continue to preserve Arlie’s 
innovative spirit as they expand their 
product line to offer additional equip-
ment that addresses the unique chal-
lenges facing farmers and ranchers in 
the Pacific Northwest and across the 
Nation. While Hillco equipment is well 
known in farming communities nation-
wide, the Nezperce community recog-
nizes Hillco for their generous support 
of local businesses, athletics, edu-
cation, and first responders. 
Congratulations to the Hill family 
and all of the employees at Hillco 
Technologies, Inc., for being selected 
as the Idaho Small Business of the 
Month for July 2022. Thank you for 
serving Idaho as small business owners 
and entrepreneurs. You make our great 
State proud, and I look forward to your 
continued growth and success.∑

f 
STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED 
BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS 
By Mr. BENNET: 
S. 4513. A bill to amend the Omnibus 
Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 
1968 to provide funding or innovations 
in community policing, mental health 
care, and community safety, and for 
other purposes; to the Committee on 
the Judiciary. 
Mr. BENNET. Mr. President, a few 
years ago, a police officer in Pueblo, 
CO, was kind enough to let me join him 
in a squad car for a few hours to get a 
sense of what his daily beat was like. It 
was in the middle of the night. It didn’t 
take very long to appreciate that our 
country asks law enforcement to do a 
lot more than simply enforce the law. 
Washington has underinvested in the 
American people year after year after 
year in areas like housing, education, 
and mental health. It has left law en-
forcement to pick up the pieces. It has 
put them in a position wherein they 
are not only having to serve as law en-
forcement officers but also as social 
workers, 
as 
mental 
health 
profes-
sionals, and as responders for issues 
like homelessness or drug addiction, 
even though nobody has trained them 
for it necessarily. 
That result has been really tough for 
officers on the ground in Colorado and 
across the country. It strains their re-
sources, adds to the workload, and ac-
celerates burnout. It has also been hard 
for communities. It diverts law en-
forcement from violent crime, and it 
means we are forcing officers to ad-
dress mental health issues and prob-
lems instead of dealing with the under-
lying issues that produce many 9–1–1 
calls in the first place. 
I am sad to say that all of these un-
derlying issues that everybody is famil-
iar with have gotten worse during the 
pandemic. It is one reason there has 
been a spike in crime that started in 
2020, before the current administration, 
and it has continued ever since. In 2020, 
murders rose nearly 30 percent. Aggra-
vated assault was up 12 percent. Motor 
vehicle theft was up 12 percent. Again, 
this was in 2020, before the current ad-
ministration, but, sadly, many of these 
trends have continued. In a survey of 
small businesses, 54 percent of Amer-
ican small businesses reported an in-
crease in shoplifting last year. 
To deal with this rise in crime, we 
need to increase funding for the COPS 
Program, which I strongly support, so 
we can hire more officers and strength-
en community police. I think we 
should pass a bill that I am introducing 
today, called the SMART Community 
Policing Act. The bill is based on 28 
highly successful programs across Col-
orado, in places like Denver and Grand 
Junction. 
As I mentioned, you know, a lot of 9– 
1–1 calls involve lower risk situations 
that don’t always require a police offi-
cer, but some combination of an EMT, 
a mental health specialist, or a social 
worker can get the job done, allowing 
law enforcement to focus on violent 
crime, but in most of the country, law 
enforcement has to answer every one of 
those 9–1–1 calls. 
The SMART Community Policing 
Act creates resources for law enforce-
ment to partner with local organiza-
tions and service providers so they 
send the right responder depending on 
what the problem actually is. That lets 
law enforcement focus on violent crime 
and lets other responders with the 
right training deal with lower risk sit-
uations, like when someone is experi-
encing a mental health crisis or a se-
vere drug withdrawal. These trained 
professionals can deescalate the situa-
tion. They can connect people with the 
right resources and do the comprehen-
sive followup to keep them from re-
quiring emergency services again and 
again and again. 
Grand Junction’s Co-Responder Unit 
has answered over 3,200 calls since the 
program began in 2018. Denver’s STAR 
Program has responded to almost 4,600 
calls since 2020. 
I had a chance to hear about the 
STAR Program from Denver’s police 
chief, Paul Pazen, 2 years ago. He told 
me about a mom who had called 9–1–1 
because she was having a lot of trouble 
with her child. You don’t need a police

officer for that, so they sent responders 
from STAR, who deescalated the situa-
tion and saved law enforcement pre-
cious time. 
If you add it all up, those are thou-
sands of hours that officers in Denver 
and Grand Junction and across Colo-
rado could spend focusing on violent 
crime instead of on issues that other 
people might have greater expertise to 
deal with, people with the right train-
ing in nonviolent situations. It allows 
us to reduce the strain on the system. 
None of this is speculation. When 
Stanford University studied Denver’s 
program, they found that in neighbor-
hoods patrolled by STAR, reports of 
less serious crimes dropped by more 
than a third and that the program 
saved a lot of money, a ton of money. 
It cost about $150 when STAR re-
sponded to an offense compared to 
nearly $650 when the Denver PD re-
sponded on their own. 
I can appreciate what these savings 
would mean for a local police depart-
ment. My colleagues may remember 
that before I was in the Senate, one of 
my jobs was serving as chief of staff to 
JOHN HICKENLOOPER, who was then the 
mayor of Denver. I don’t know what 
became of him, but he was a very good 
mayor for the city and county of Den-
ver. In that job, I heard all the time 
from community leaders as to how 
they wished there were resources be-
yond law enforcement for situations 
that were better suited for a social 
worker or a mental health expert. 
I would have loved to have had the 
STAR Program when I was working for 
the city and county of Denver, and I 
would have loved it when I was the su-
perintendent of the Denver Public 
Schools, where a lot of my job was 
working with the Denver Police De-
partment to keep our schools safe and 
to reduce the ticketing of kids so they 
weren’t cycling through the criminal 
justice system prematurely. 
All of this experience led me to write 
this bill, and I view this as one more 
area wherein Colorado offers a model 
for the country to take on the rise in 
crime in a smart and thoughtful way. 
Americans have a reasonable expec-
tation—a reasonable expectation—that 
Washington cares as much about their 
safety as they do, and they expect the 
people they send to Washington to ac-
tually come up with useful solutions. I 
think this bill meets that test. It re-
sponds to the needs of law enforcement 
and to the needs of communities. I 
don’t know how anybody here could ob-
ject to it. 
If you want to reduce violent crime, 
you should support this bill. If you 
want trained experts responding to 
nonviolent 9–1–1 calls instead of police 
officers, you should support this bill. If 
you want to save taxpayers money, you 
should support this bill. So I hope my 
colleagues on both sides of the aisle 
will take a look at this proposal, and I 
gladly welcome their support.

Mr. BLUMENTHAL):

Mr. RISCH (for himself, Mr. RUBIO, 
Mr. CRUZ, Mr. HAGERTY, Mr. CASSIDY, 
and Mr. BARRASSO) submitted the fol-
lowing resolution; which was referred 
to the Committee on Foreign Rela-
tions: 
S. RES. 704 
Whereas December 12, 2022, marks the 
200th anniversary of the establishment of 
diplomatic relations between the United 
States and Mexico; 
Whereas, over the course of 200 years, the 
Governments and people of the United States 
and Mexico have developed deep cultural, 
economic, and diplomatic relations that 
have been instrumental in creating pros-
perity in both countries and throughout the 
hemisphere; 
Whereas, according to the United States 
Trade Representative and the Department of 
Commerce, United States goods and services 
trade with Mexico totaled an estimated 
$677,300,000,000 in 2019, and United States ex-
ports of goods and services to Mexico sup-
ported an estimated 1,200,000 jobs in 2015; 
Whereas, according to the United States 
Bureau of Economic Analysis, the United 
States is Mexico’s top source of foreign di-
rect investment in 2019 with $100,900,000,000, 
or 39.1 percent of all inflows (stock) to Mex-
ico, according to Mexico’s Secretariat of 
Economy; 
Whereas the United States exports roughly 
$20,000,000,000 in agricultural products to 
Mexico annually, nearly $6,000,000,000 of 
which are biotech crops and derived prod-
ucts; 
Whereas the government of President 
Lopez Obrador has pursued major legal and 
regulatory measures that pose significant 
risks and uncertainty to cross-border trade, 
including denying 14 biotechnology applica-
tions since May 2018, front-of-packing label-
ing requirements imposed in November 2020, 
unilateral certification requirements on all 
United States organic exports to Mexico im-
posed in December 2020, the December 31, 
2020, Presidential Decree to phase out the 
use of glyphosate and genetically modified 
corn for human consumption, the February 
2021 Electricity Industry Law, and the May 
2021 Hydrocarbons Law; 
Whereas the government of President 
Lopez Obrador has suspended import permits 
for more than 80 energy companies, has 
ended permits for energy import facilities, 
which puts United States investment at risk, 
and is advancing a constitutional reform bill 
that would dissolve the power market in 
Mexico, eliminate independent regulators, 
and cancel contracts and permits granted to 
private companies; 
Whereas arbitrary and punitive actions 
against United States businesses operating 
in Mexico by the government of President 
Lopez Obrador, such as the recent shutdown 
of a limestone quarry owned by a United 
States company that is a critical component 
of the construction aggregates supply chain

for the southeast United States, are dam-
aging the economic relationship between the 
United States and Mexico, disrupting North 
American supply chains, and threatening to 
undermine the confidence of United States 
businesses in Mexico as a viable and predict-
able marketplace and destination for invest-
ment; 
Whereas United States law enforcement 
encountered over 1,700,000 migrants attempt-
ing to enter the United States illegally 
through the southern border with Mexico in 
2021, and have encountered over 1,500,000 in 
the first months of 2022, reaching an all-time 
high of 239,416 encounters in May 2022; 
Whereas United States law enforcement is 
seeing increasing numbers of criminals try-
ing to enter the United States illegally, ar-
resting nearly 6,000 in the first few months of 
2022, compared to 10,763 in 2021 and 2,438 in 
2020; 
Whereas, in May 2022, Secretary of Home-
land Security Alejandro Mayorkas declared 
with regards to encounters of illegal immi-
grants at the United States southern border, 
‘‘We’re seeing about a seven-day average of 
over 7,500 people, so we have not seen a sig-
nificant decrease in the flows.’’; 
Whereas U.S. Customs and Border Protec-
tion operational statistics showed fentanyl 
seizures at the United States southern bor-
der increased 56 percent in March 2022 com-
pared to March 2021, with over a 300 percent 
increase from March 2020; 
Whereas U.S. Customs and Border Protec-
tion 
noted 
a 
1,066-percent 
increase 
in 
fentanyl seizures at 8 South Texas ports of 
entry during Fiscal Year 2021, and Texas law 
enforcement seized enough fentanyl to com-
prise over 36,200,000 lethal doses during the 
same time period; 
Whereas the Centers for Disease Control 
and Prevention (CDC) reported a record of 
106,000 overdose deaths in the United States, 
with more than 70,000 of those attributed to 
synthetic opioids, a substantial amount of 
which are illicitly produced in Mexico using 
precursor chemicals imported from the Peo-
ple’s Republic of China and mixed or re-
shipped by Mexican drug cartels; 
Whereas reports from the United States 
Northern Command indicate that Mexican 
cartels now control 30 to 35 percent of Mexi-
can territory, with Mexico’s midterm elec-
tions in June 2021 being the most violent on 
record driven by cartel violence and at-
tempts to thwart the democratic process; 
Whereas more than 80 politicians were 
killed prior to the June 2021 midterm elec-
tions in Mexico, with the Mexican cartels 
claiming responsibility for the killings of at 
least 35 candidates, according to several re-
ports; 
Whereas, according to the Initiative on 
Nonstate Armed Actors of the Brookings In-
stitution, Mexico registered almost 35,000 
murders in 2021 near an all-time high, rep-
resenting 27 murders per 100,000 and pri-
marily 
attributable 
to 
ties 
related 
to 
transnational criminal organizations, while 
the effective prosecution rate for homicides 
remains around 2 percent; 
Whereas, according to the Initiative on 
Nonstate Armed Actors, the rivalry between 
the Sinaloa Cartel and Cartel Jalisco Nueva 
Generacio´n (CJNG) has violently spread to 
Colombia, one of the United States’ closest 
allies in the Western Hemisphere, with CJNG 
deploying drone-mounted bombs to seize ter-
ritory and Sinaloa taking over both the legal 
and illegal economies of the territories in 
dispute; 
Whereas, in 2021, the government of Presi-
dent Obrador disbanded a select Mexican 
anti-narcotics unit that, for a quarter of a 
century, 
worked 
hand-in-hand 
with 
the 
United States Drug Enforcement Adminis-
tration (DEA) to tackle organized crime; 
Whereas President Obrador has spear-
headed legal and regulatory measures to re-
duce or eliminate the independence of Mexi-
can autonomous institutions and regulators, 
including the Federal Economic Competition 
Commission, the Federal Institute for Tele-
communications, 
the 
Energy 
Regulatory 
Commission, and the National Electoral In-
stitute; 
Whereas, at a March 2022 hearing of the 
Committee on Armed Services of the Senate, 
United States Northern Command Com-
mander, General Glen D. VanHerck, testified 
that ‘‘the largest portion of [Russian intel-
ligence personnel] in the world is in Mexico 
right now’’ and ‘‘they keep an eye very close-
ly on their opportunities to have influence 
on U.S. opportunities and access’’; 
Whereas Mexico voted in the United Na-
tion’s General Assembly to condemn the 
Russian invasion of Ukraine, while abstain-
ing from suspending Russia as a permanent 
observer of the Organization of American 
States and from expelling Russia from the 
United Nations Human Rights Council; 
Whereas President Obrador has increas-
ingly turned to the People’s Republic of 
China to finance controversial infrastructure 
projects, including the Dos Bocas Refinery 
and the Maya Train, while the People’s Re-
public of China’s State Power Investment 
Corporation (SPIC) acquired Mexican renew-
ables power company Zuma Energy during a 
time when private corporations were fleeing 
the sector; and 
Whereas Mexico remains one of the world’s 
most dangerous countries for journalists and 
media workers, including the deaths of 12 
journalists to date in 2021 alone: Now, there-
fore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) reaffirms the interest of the United 
States in mutually beneficial relations with 
Mexico based on shared interests on secu-
rity, economic prosperity, and democratic 
values; 
(2) reaffirms support for stronger economic 
relations with Mexico, including to strength-
en the resiliency of critical supply chains in 
North America and the Western Hemisphere 
in general; 
(3) expresses deep concerns about the wors-
ening investment climate in Mexico, and 
calls on the President to take meaningful ac-
tions to defend United States economic in-
terests in Mexico and uphold the integrity of 
the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement 
(USMCA); 
(4) urges the President to address the hu-
manitarian and security crisis at the border 
with Mexico by— 
(A) establishing effective immigration con-
trols in the United States; 
(B) targeting United States foreign assist-
ance efforts to strengthen border security 
and migration management capacities in the 
region; and 
(C) leveraging existing bilateral extra-
dition treaties and the Palermo Protocols to 
prosecute transnational criminal actors fa-
cilitating illegal migration to the United 
States; 
(5) is deeply concerned about the growing 
sophistication and territorial control of 
transnational criminal organizations in Mex-
ico, and reaffirms the urgent need to 
prioritize a detailed and well-resourced plan 
to reduce the production and trafficking of 
illicit narcotics in Mexico, including the il-
licit traffic of precursor chemicals imported 
from the People’s Republic of China for the 
manufacture of synthetic opioids, such as 
fentanyl, and that such efforts do not result 
in a breakdown in the rule of law or respect 
for internationally-recognized human rights 
in Mexico; and 
(6) urges the Government of Mexico to 
meaningfully reduce the threat of deadly 
synthetic opioids, uphold its domestic and 
international commitments to legal, safe, 
and orderly immigration, uphold its obliga-
tions under the USMCA, respect the inde-
pendence of autonomous regulatory institu-

ence of the People’s Republic of China and 
the Russian Federation in North America 
and the Western Hemisphere in general.

Mr. THUNE, Mr. CRAMER, Mrs. HYDE- 
SMITH, and Mr. MARSHALL) submitted 
the following resolution; which was re-
ferred to the Committee on the Judici-
ary: 
S. RES. 705 
Whereas the decision of the Supreme Court 
of the United States (referred to in this pre-
amble as the ‘‘Supreme Court’’) in Roe v. 
Wade, 410 U.S. 113 (1973), was a blatant act of 
judicial activism that invented a constitu-
tional right to abortion out of whole cloth, 
with no grounding in the text of the Con-
stitution of the United States; 
Whereas more than 63,000,000 babies have 
been aborted in the United States since the 
decision of the Supreme Court in Roe v. 
Wade; 
Whereas the decision in Roe v. Wade 
caused great damage to the democratic sys-
tem of the United States by preventing citi-
zens of the United States from making deci-
sions about the legality of abortion and in-
stead putting these decisions in the hands of 
unelected Federal judges; 
Whereas, far from settling the issue of 
abortion in the United States, the decision of 
the Supreme Court in Roe v. Wade has exac-
erbated social tensions, inflamed the politics 
of the United States, disrupted the demo-
cratic processes of the United States, and di-
vided the people of the United States; 
Whereas, in the aftermath of the decision 
of the Supreme Court in Roe v. Wade, mil-
lions of volunteers, nonpartisan organiza-
tions, and lawmakers came together with a 
shared voice to stand up for the rights of the 
unborn, who are the most vulnerable among 
us; 
Whereas these supporters of the pro-life 
movement come from diverse backgrounds, 
with the shared goal of building a society 
that celebrates, protects, and cherishes life 
at all stages; 
Whereas the pro-life movement has worked 
tirelessly over the last 5 decades to reverse 
the legally unsound and destructive ruling in 
Roe v. Wade and to ensure that the human 
dignity of every person is protected by law, 
regardless of age, background, or belief; 
Whereas the work of the pro-life movement 
has been more than simply advocating for 
the Supreme Court to overturn Roe v. Wade 
and often occurs behind the scenes, with lit-
tle recognition of the time and talent that 
countless individuals have invested in the ef-
fort to protect life; 
Whereas millions of people in the United 
States have contributed to the cultivation of 
a culture of life in the United States by 
marching for life on the streets of cities in 
the United States, engaging in sidewalk

counseling outside abortion clinics, pro-
viding resources for expectant mothers, rais-
ing money and volunteering their time for 
crisis pregnancy centers, adopting and fos-
tering children, advocating for life-affirming 
legislation in every State, and submitting 
amicus briefs in abortion-related cases at 
the State and Federal level; 
Whereas, on June 24, 2022, the Supreme 
Court issued its decision in Dobbs v. Jackson 
Women’s Health Organization, No. 19-1392, 
2022 WL 2276808 (2022), which overturned Roe 
v. Wade and affirmed that there is no Fed-
eral constitutional right to an abortion; 
Whereas the decision in Dobbs v. Jackson 
Women’s Health Organization represents a 
historic victory for the sanctity of life and 
for the millions of people in the United 
States who have worked diligently over the 
last 5 decades to foster a culture of life in 
the United States; 
Whereas the decision of the Supreme Court 
in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organi-
zation does not ban abortion but instead rec-
ognizes that under the constitutional system 
of the United States, the power and the duty 
to decide whether to permit or limit abor-
tions lies with the States, not unelected Fed-
eral judges; 
Whereas, as the late Justice Scalia recog-
nized 3 decades ago in his dissent in Planned 
Parenthood of Southeastern Pennsylvania v. 
Casey, 505 U.S. 833 (1992), ‘‘The permissibility 
of abortion, and the limitations upon it, are 
to be resolved like most important questions 
in our democracy: by citizens trying to per-
suade one another and then voting.’’; and 
Whereas the decision of the Supreme Court 
in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organi-
zation returns the issue of abortion back to 
the States, for the people of each State to 
debate and then vote: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) congratulates the pro-life movement 
and the millions of individuals who have 
stood up for life over the last nearly 50 years 
on this historic victory in Dobbs v. Jackson 
Women’s Health Organization; 
(2) celebrates the courage, compassion, and 
commitment of the millions of individuals, 
nonpartisan organizations, and lawmakers 
who have advocated for life and labored tire-
lessly to overturn Roe v. Wade; 
(3) lauds the Supreme Court of the United 
States for the decision to return to the origi-
nal understanding of the Constitution of the 
United States and recognize that there is no 
Federal constitutional right to an abortion; 
(4) recognizes the uniqueness of the polit-
ical system of the United States, in which 
our States function as laboratories of democ-
racy, enabling citizens to debate issues like 
abortion in the public square and make their 
voices heard by voting; 
(5) affirms the commitment of Congress to 
ensuring the safety of supporters of the pro- 
life movement, including lawful demonstra-
tors, volunteers, religious clergy, and crisis 
pregnancy center personnel, as they con-
tinue to advocate for the sanctity of every 
human life in all 50 States; and 
(6) condemns all threats and incidents of 
violence fueled by the decision of the Su-
preme Court of the United States in Dobbs v. 
Jackson Women’s Health Organization and 
affirms the commitment of Congress to en-
suring the safety of justices of the Supreme 
Court, their law clerks, other State and Fed-
eral judges and their law clerks, members of 
Congress, and State lawmakers.

the following resolution; which was re-
ferred to the Committee on Foreign 
Relations: 
S. RES. 706 
Whereas the emergence of a prosperous and 
democratic Japan over the past 75 years has 
been one of the foundations of global sta-
bility and peace in the world; 
Whereas former Prime Minister of Japan 
Shinzo Abe was tragically assassinated on 
July 8, 2022, resulting in the loss of a leading 
statesman and tireless champion of demo-
cratic values around the world; 
Whereas former Prime Minister Shinzo 
Abe served as the Prime Minister of Japan 
from 2006 to 2007 and 2012 to 2020, while leav-
ing an indelible mark on the politics, econ-
omy, and society of Japan, as well as pros-
perity and security around the world; 
Whereas, in August 2007, at the Parliament 
of the Republic of India, former Prime Min-
ister Shinzo Abe delivered a historic speech 
entitled ‘‘The Confluence of the Two Seas’’, 
which inspired the vision of the free and 
open Indo-Pacific; 
Whereas, in December 2012, former Prime 
Minister Shinzo Abe launched the concept of 
the democratic security diamond—the pre-
cursor to the modern-day Quadrilateral Se-
curity Dialogue—in which he envisaged a 
strategy under which the United States, 
Australia, India, and Japan would form a 
‘‘diamond to safeguard’’ the maritime com-
mons stretching from the Indian Ocean re-
gion to the Western Pacific; 
Whereas, in April 2015, former Prime Min-
ister Shinzo Abe made the first address by a 
Japanese leader to a joint session of Con-
gress where he called the relationship be-
tween the United States and Japan ‘‘an alli-
ance of hope’’ and offered his ‘‘eternal condo-
lences to the souls of all American people 
that were lost during World War II’’; 
Whereas former Prime Minister Shinzo 
Abe advanced the United States-Japan alli-
ance through multiple Presidential adminis-
trations of the United States by strength-
ening diplomatic, military, and economic co-
operation, including the Trade Agreement 
between the United States of America and 
Japan, done at Washington October 7, 2019; 
Whereas former Prime Minister Shinzo 
Abe tirelessly sought to resolve the issue of 
Japanese citizens abducted by the Demo-
cratic People’s Republic of Korea and con-
tinuously sought the safe return of such citi-
zens to Japan; 
Whereas former Prime Minister Shinzo 
Abe 
relentlessly 
pursued 
the 
denuclearization of the Democratic People’s 
Republic of Korea by leading a global cam-
paign to cut off revenue to the unlawful nu-
clear weapons program the Democratic Peo-
ple’s Republic of Korea; and 
Whereas the United States lost a great 
friend and ally with the assassination of 
former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, whose 
leadership laid a lasting foundation for the 
United States and Japan to partner for dec-
ades to come in promoting freedom, pros-
perity, and security around the world and 
opposing 
authoritarianism 
and 
tyranny: 
Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) remembers former Prime Minister of 
Japan Shinzo Abe and his work to strength-
en the alliance between the United States 
and Japan; and 
(2) extends condolences to the family of 
former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and the

Whereas title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 
1964 promises workers that they can earn a 
paycheck without facing discrimination or 
harassment in the workplace and without 
fear of retaliation; 
Whereas the EEOC plays a vital role in 
making that promise a reality by inves-
tigating workplace discrimination and har-
assment, and by enforcing Federal anti-dis-
crimination statutes; 
Whereas, in fiscal year 2021, the EEOC re-
solved over 62,000 charges and recovered over 
$350,000,000 in remedies for violations of anti- 
discrimination laws, and between fiscal 
years 2018 and 2021, the EEOC received over 
98,000 charges alleging harassment, of which, 
over 27,000 were related to sexual harass-
ment; 
Whereas, despite the progress that has 
been made toward equity and fairness in the 
workplace, the gender wage gap persists, and 
according to the most recent data and up-
dated methodology, women were paid just 73 
cents for every dollar paid to men in 2020, 
with even greater disparities for women of 
color; 
Whereas the EEOC’s own extensive study 
of sexual harassment in the workplace con-
cluded that it is difficult to even know how 
many individuals experience sexual harass-
ment, a critical first step to addressing har-
assment and ensuring that workers feel safe; 
and 
Whereas tipped workers (who are largely 
low wage, women, and immigrant workers) 
are more likely to experience workplace har-
assment and retaliation, and account for 14 
percent of harassment charges to the EEOC, 
a high share of such harassment charges: 
Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) recognizes the critical role the Equal 
Employment Opportunity Commission (re-
ferred to in this resolution as the ‘‘EEOC’’) 
plays in addressing longstanding issues in-
cluding the wage gap, combating workplace 
harassment, and ensuring all workers, in-
cluding LGBTQ+ workers, workers with dis-
abilities, pregnant workers, and workers of 
color, are treated with dignity and respect in 
the workplace; and 
(2) recognizes the work that still remains 
to be done to secure the rights and opportu-
nities guaranteed by Federal anti-discrimi-
nation laws, which ensure all workers have a 
fair shot at success in the workplace. 
SENATE 
RESOLUTION 
708—EX-
PRESSING THE SENSE OF THE 
SENATE ON THE POLITICAL RE-
PRESSION IN BELARUS ON THE 
TWO-YEAR 
ANNIVERSARY 
OF 
THE AUGUST 2020, FRAUDULENT 
PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION 
Mr. DURBIN (for himself, Mr. TILLIS, 
Mrs. SHAHEEN, Mrs. FISCHER, Mr. VAN 
HOLLEN, Mr. RUBIO, Mr. MARKEY, Mr. 
CARDIN, Mr. KAINE, and Mr. COONS) sub-
mitted the following resolution; which 
was referred to the Committee on For-
eign Relations: 
S. RES. 708 
Whereas Alyaksandr Lukashenka has ruled 
Belarus as an undemocratic dictatorship 
since the first presidential election in 
Belarus in 1994, dismantling the democratic 
institutions of Belarus and seeking to jail 
those who compete against him in presi-
dential elections or protest his authoritarian 
regime; 
Whereas the Lukashenka regime jailed 
leading 
opposition 
candidates 
that 
at-
tempted to compete in the August 9, 2020, 
presidential election in Belarus; 
Whereas Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya ran in 
the August 9, 2020, presidential election after 
the jailing of her husband, opposition can-
didate Siarhei Tsikhanouski, and was widely 
seen as the legitimate winner by the inter-
national community; 
Whereas the August 9, 2020 presidential 
election, in which Lukashenka claimed vic-
tory, was marred by widespread concern over 
its legitimacy, as noted by the Organization 
for Security and Co-operation in Europe, the 
European Council, the United Nations High 
Commissioner for Human Rights, the De-
partment of State, and reputable inter-
national human rights groups; 
Whereas the Senate, as expressed in Senate 
Resolution 658 (116th Congress) and Senate 
Resolution 345 (117th Congress), both of 
which passed with unanimous support, has 
stated its deep concern regarding the most 
recent fraudulent election that took place in 
Belarus on August 9, 2020; 
Whereas, in response to the August 9, 2020, 
fraudulent presidential election, the people 
of Belarus staged the largest and longest sus-
tained public protests in the history of the 
country, calling for a democratic Belarus; 
Whereas, since the August 9, 2020, fraudu-
lent presidential election, the Lukashenka 
regime has continued to pressure, harass, 
imprison, and persecute opposition leaders, 
civil society activists, human rights defend-
ers, and independent media; 
Whereas, according to the Viasna Human 
Rights Centre, the Government of Belarus 
has continued to keep at least 1,244 people 
imprisoned on politically motivated charges 
or under false pretense of terrorist threat, 
including 
opposition 
candidate 
Siarhei 
Tsikhanouski, who was sentenced to 18 years 
in prison; 
Whereas Russia provided critical support 
to the Lukashenka regime following the re-
pression of the protests that followed the 
August 9, 2020, fraudulent presidential elec-
tion, backing the Lukashenka regime’s ef-
forts to prevent the emergence of a demo-
cratic Belarus, including through the provi-
sion of financial assistance, propaganda sup-
port, and offers of military assistance; 
Whereas, on May 23, 2021, the Government 
of Belarus unlawfully forced the landing of 
Ryanair Flight 4978 in Minsk to arrest jour-
nalist and activist Raman Pratasevich and 
his partner Sofia Sapega; 
Whereas, since July 7, 2021, the Govern-
ment of Belarus has weaponized vulnerable 
migrants by manufacturing a border crisis 
with Latvia, Lithuania, and Poland in retal-
iation for sanctions imposed by the Euro-
pean Union; 
Whereas, on February 24, 2022, Russia 
launched 
an 
unprovoked 
war 
against 
Ukraine, using Belarus as a launching pad 
for its attack; 
Whereas the Lukashenka regime has con-
tinued to allow Belarus to be used by Rus-
sian President Vladimir Putin for his illegal 
and unprovoked war against Ukraine, includ-
ing via a sham February 27, 2022, constitu-
tional referendum on provisions to enable 
Belarus to host nuclear weapons and undo 
Belarus’ decades-long commitment to neu-
trality; 
Whereas, since the Russian invasion of 
Ukraine, Lukashenka has met with Vladimir 
Putin on at least four separate occasions, in-
cluding most recently on June 25, 2022, when 
Putin pledged to supply Belarus with missile 
systems capable of carrying nuclear weap-
ons; 
Whereas, 
despite 
support 
from 
the 
Lukashenka regime for Putin’s war in 
Ukraine, hundreds of brave Belarusians have 
joined together to defend Ukraine, both on 
the battlefield in Ukraine and in the disrup-
tion of Russian supply lines; 
Whereas the United States and allies of the 
United States have imposed sanctions on the 
Lukashenka regime for the August 9, 2020, 
fraudulent presidential election and ensuing 
repression as well as support for Putin’s war 
in Ukraine; 
Whereas, on December 15 2020, Julie Fisher 
was confirmed by the Senate as Ambassador 
to Belarus, but her credentials were not ac-
cepted by the Lukashenka regime, resulting 
in President’s Biden decision in October 2021 
to appoint Mrs. Fisher as Special Envoy for 
Belarus; and 
Whereas 
Belarusian 
opposition 
leader 
Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, in exile in Lith-
uania, continues to represent the widely 
shared desire of the Belarusian people for 
free and fair elections and democracy: Now, 
therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) continues, on the second anniversary of 
the fraudulent presidential election that 
took place in Belarus on August 9, 2020, to 
refuse to recognize Alyaksandr Lukashenka 
as the legitimately elected leader of Belarus; 
(2) condemns the ongoing harassment and 
persecution of opposition leaders, civil soci-
ety activists, human rights defenders, and 
independent 
media 
carried 
out 
by 
the 
Lukashenka regime, and urges the imme-
diate release, without preconditions, of all 
political prisoners in Belarus, including 
Siarhei Tsikhanouski, as well as for all rep-
resentatives of democratic forces, civil soci-
ety, and independent media in exile to be 
able to return home without fear of persecu-
tion or prosecution; 
(3) calls for new presidential and par-
liamentary elections to be held in Belarus, 
conducted in a manner that meets inter-
national standards and includes independent 
election monitoring; 
(4) condemns the shameful and self-serving 
support provided by the Lukashenka regime 
for Russian President Putin’s savage war in 
Ukraine; 
(5) welcomes continued and coordinated 
sanctions imposed by the United States and 
European Union and other tools to support 
democracy in Belarus; 
(6) recognizes the extraordinary support of-
fered by the Governments of Lithuania, Po-
land, and Ukraine to support the people of 
Belarus, including support for the political 
opposition, accommodation of political refu-
gees, and backing of independent media; 
(7) encourages President Biden to swiftly 
appoint a new Special Envoy for Belarus to 
support the pro-democracy movement; and

S3279 
July 13, 2022 
S. RES. 638 
Whereas, on February 18, 2022, the United 
States and Moldova marked 30 years of diplo-
matic relations; 
Whereas, on February 24, 2022, armed 
forces of the Russian Federation began an il-
legal, unjustified, and unprovoked attack on 
Ukraine with missile strikes against densely 
populated urban areas, including Kyiv, the 
capital of Ukraine, and the regional hubs of 
Odesa and Mykolayiv, which lie close to 
Moldova; 
Whereas Moldova is a country of approxi-
mately 2,600,000 people that relies heavily on 
remittances 
sent 
to 
Moldova 
by 
the 
Moldovan diaspora; 
Whereas, in 2011, the Government of 
Moldova passed a law entitled ‘‘Law on Inte-
gration of Foreigners in the Republic of 
Moldova’’, which provided refugees and bene-
ficiaries of humanitarian protection access 
to social security, primary and secondary 
education, medical insurance, cultural inte-
gration support, language classes, and em-
ployment counseling; 
Whereas, prior to the most recent invasion 
of Ukraine by President Vladimir Putin, the 
Government of Moldova assessed that the in-
frastructure in Moldova could accommodate 
not more than 15,000 refugees; 
Whereas, only one day after the com-
mencement of the unconscionable attack on 
Ukraine by President Putin, the people of 
Moldova welcomed more than 16,000 refugees; 
Whereas, since 2014, more than 450,000 refu-
gees fleeing the invasion of Ukraine by 
President Putin had entered Moldova and 
more than 100,000 of such refugees chose to 
remain in Moldova; 
Whereas, by March 7, 2022, 89 percent of 
Ukrainian refugees arriving in Moldova were 
women and children; 
Whereas, by March 9, 2022, an estimated 6 
out of every 100 people in Chisinau, the cap-
ital of Moldova, were refugees; 
Whereas, by April 26, 2022, refugees com-
prised more than 16 percent of the popu-
lation of Moldova; 
Whereas the United Nations High Commis-
sioner for Refugees Representative for Cen-
tral Europe Roland Schilling said, ‘‘The atti-
tude of Moldovan authorities is really im-
pressive’’, and noted that ‘‘local commu-
nities came to help refugees, feeding them, 
supporting them’’ at the border; 
Whereas the Government of Moldova has 
created ‘‘green corridors’’ to facilitate the 
crossing of refugees from Ukraine to Roma-
nia and other countries in the European 
Union; 
Whereas, over the past year, the Govern-
ment of Moldova and civil society have em-
barked on meaningful reform of the justice 
system and promoted good governance and 
economic stability in Moldova; 
Whereas, on March 3, 2022, Moldova for-
mally submitted its application to join the 
European Union, signaling a commitment to 
democratic values and the rule of law; 
Whereas, on March 16, 2022, the European 
Union announced that Moldova and Ukraine 
had completed the emergency synchroni-
zation process with the Continental Euro-
pean Grid, operated by the European Net-
work of Transmission System Operators; 
Whereas, as of April 21, 2022, the United 
States has provided more than $25,000,000 to 
support 
humanitarian 
operations 
in 
Moldova; 
Whereas, on April 22, 2022, a senior mili-
tary official of the Russian Federation indi-
cated that the Russian Federation intended 
to conquer southern Ukraine and join that 
territory with Transnistria, a breakaway re-
gion of Moldova; and 
Whereas, in late April and early May 2022, 
reports 
of 
unexplained 
explosions 
in 
Transnistria elevated concerns that the Rus-
sia Federation could expand its war into 
Moldova: Now, therefore, be it 
øResolved,¿ 
That the Senate— 
(1) commends the people of Moldova for their 
hospitality and extraordinary efforts hosting 
more than 100,000 refugees fleeing Ukraine; 
(2) condemns provocation and aggressive ac-
tion 
by 
the 
Russian 
Federation 
in 
the 
Transnistria region of Moldova; 
(3) reaffirms the sovereignty of Moldova and 
supports the choice of the Government of 
Moldova to further integrate with structures of 
the European Union; 
(4) calls on the United States Government to 
continue to provide meaningful and targeted fi-
nancial and technical support to Moldova; 
(5) calls on international partners to join the 
United States in providing swift and immediate 
humanitarian aid to Ukrainians in Moldova; 
(6) calls on the United States Government to 
continue working with the European Network of 
Transmission System Operators, the Government 
of Moldova, and the Government of Ukraine to 
complete full synchronization of the electricity 
grids of Moldova and Ukraine with the Conti-
nental European Grid; and 
(7) expresses support for the ongoing efforts 
by the Government of Moldova to reform the 
justice sector, promote good governance, and 
bolster the energy security of Moldova. 
Mr. WHITEHOUSE. I further ask that 
the 
committee-reported 
substitute 
amendment to the resolution be agreed 
to. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
The committee-reported amendment, 
in the nature of a substitute, was 
agreed to. 
Mr. WHITEHOUSE. I know of no fur-
ther debate on the resolution, as 
amended. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
further debate? 
If not, the question is on agreeing to 
the resolution, as amended. 
The resolution (S. Res. 638), as 
amended, was agreed to. 
Mr. WHITEHOUSE. I ask that the 
preamble be agreed to and that the mo-
tions to reconsider be considered made 
and laid upon the table with no inter-
vening action or debate. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
The preamble was agreed to. 
The resolution, as amended, with its 
preamble was agreed to.

ORDERS FOR THURSDAY, JULY 14, 
2022 
Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Madam Presi-
dent, I ask unanimous consent that 
when the Senate completes its business 
today, it adjourn until 10 a.m. on 
Thursday, July 14, and that following 
the prayer and pledge, the morning 
hour be deemed expired, the Journal of 
proceedings be approved to date, the 
time for the two leaders be reserved for 
their use later in the day, and morning 
business be closed; that upon the con-
clusion of morning business, the Sen-
ate proceed to executive session to re-
sume consideration of the Heinzelman

postcloture; 
that 
all

confirmation of the nomination; fur-
ther, that following the vote, the Sen-
ate resume consideration of the Childs

any nominations are confirmed during 
Thursday’s session, the motions to re-
consider be considered made and laid 
upon the table, and the President be

The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
Mr. WHITEHOUSE. For the informa-
tion of the Senate, the first rollcall 
vote of the day will begin at 11:45 a.m. 
on confirmation of the Heinzelman

WORLD ATHLETICS 
CHAMPIONSHIPS 
Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, this is an 
exciting time for my home State of Or-
egon. The eyes of the sports world are 
turning to the city of Eugene, where 
thousands of elite athletes have arrived 
for the World Athletics Championships 
that start Friday. 
For those who may not have been 
paying 
attention, 
Eugene, 
OR, 
is 
known in track-and-field circles as 
TrackTown USA. Eugene has fewer 
than 200,000 residents, but it punches 
far above its weight as one of the ath-
letic capitals of the world, particularly 
the newly rebuilt Hayward Field on 
campus at the University of Oregon. 
My view is, you are not going to find 
a better track-and-field venue any-
where else. And that is not only be-
cause it is where the Oregon Ducks 
routinely fly past the competition; it is 
the home of track and field in the 
United States dating back decades to 
when Bill Hayward first had his vision 
for the sports in Eugene. 
It is a vision that picked up speed 
when Oregon’s own Steve Prefontaine 
provided drills for me when I was a law 
school student at the University of Or-
egon, as well as millions of running 
fans the world over. And, of course, 
Hayward Field has been home for 
Olympics trials in greatness, as well as 
dominance by my fellow Ducks in col-
lege meets. 
The legacy of athletics in Eugene is a 
big reason why it is the first ever 
American city to host the World Ath-
letics Championships. This year, the 
games are known as Oregon22. 
Two thousand top Olympic-level ath-
letes are going to compete. They come 
from nearly 200 countries. They are the 
best of the best, ready to break records 
and make their home countries proud. 
A little bit ago, I was home, and I 
talked with the fantastic team of 
workers who have been working for 
years on this event. It has been a colos-
sal team effort carrying the baton over 
the line, but now, the games are about 
to start. And I can tell you an awful lot 
of Oregonians are thrilled at the pros-
pect of witnessing this level of unique 
competition in person at Hayward 
Field and across the Willamette River 
in the streets of Springfield. 
This is also a spectacular showcase 
for my home State. Not only is Eugene 
playing host to thousands of athletes, 
organizers, staff, media, and fans, the 
games will be broadcast to an audience 
of a billion people around the world— 
let me repeat that—a billion people 
who are going to learn something 
about what makes my home State so 
special and different. 
London has hosted this competition. 
Paris has hosted this competition. 
Tokyo has hosted this competition. 
Now it is our turn in Eugene, OR, and 
I could not be more proud. 
So, Mr. President, I would just say 
everybody ought to tune in from July 
15 to July 24. The athletes are going to 
put on an amazing show, and so is my 
home State of Oregon. 
I yield the floor.

PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
PADILLA). The Senator from Ohio.

BORDER SECURITY 
Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, I am 
on the floor today to talk about border 
security—a humanitarian, a national 
security, a community safety issue 
with direct connection to the drug epi-
demic we see in communities all 
around the country, including my 
home State of Ohio. 
I am also here to talk about legisla-
tion I introduced today with Senator 
JIM RISCH to address this crisis. So we 
are in the middle right now of what is 
the biggest border crisis in the history 
of our country if you measure it by the 
number of people who are coming to 
the border unlawfully and, as the Biden 
administration says, people who are 
encountering the Border Patrol. 
The 
Biden 
administration 
claims 
that they have the border under con-
trol and that they are—and I am 
quoting—doing a good job. This chart, 
though, tells a really different story. It 
shows that as of May, which is the last 
month that we have records for, we had 
the highest number of border encoun-
ters on record. The second highest, by 
the way, was the month before: April. 
So you see this goes back to 2019. There 
was a surge here—144,000. Here, we have 
the inauguration of President Biden, 
and then we have had big increases— 
again, to the point that over the last 
couple of months, we have had record 
numbers of people who have come un-
lawfully to the border and been stopped 
by, apprehended by, the Border Patrol. 
This includes 239,000 total encounters 
at the border in the month of May— 
165,000 of which were single, adult mi-
grants. This does not include those who 
were not encountered—in other words, 
those who slipped past the Border Pa-
trol. We haven’t been able to find a pre-
cise number for these individuals. 
The Border Patrol calls this group of 
people got-aways. But using a conserv-
ative estimate from the Border Patrol 
of 300,000 people who they think got 
away in the last fiscal year, you would 
then put the total number of unlawful 
entries at approximately 286,000 people 
in 1 month. If you annualize that, that 
would be 3.4 million people a year. 
Think about those numbers: almost 31⁄2 
million people a year coming to our 
border and attempting to gain entry 
unlawfully. 
Today, not all of those who are ap-
prehended are allowed to come into the 
United States, and that is because 
under so-called title 42, roughly half of 
those individuals who are being appre-
hended, who are being encountered, are 
turned back. If they live in Mexico, 
they are sent back across the border. If 
they live in a country—say Ecuador or 
Guatemala—they are sent back, flown 
back to their country of origin. But 
these are people who are being turned 
away because of title 42. 
So what is title 42? It is a public 
health authority. It is an attempt by 
our government to limit migration in 
order to prevent the spread of commu-
nicable diseases—in this case, COVID– 
19. It allows the Customs and Border 
Protection officers and agents to tell 
unlawful migrants: You can’t come to 
the United States for these public 
health reasons. It only applies, by the 
way, now to single adults; but, as I said 
earlier, that is the single biggest 
group. It comprises about 48 to 52 per-
cent—about half—of the people who are 
coming up to the border. 
So even with the use of title 42, 
which is acting to discourage people 
from coming to our border, we are ex-
periencing these record levels. We are 
also experiencing these record levels in 
these hot summer months. Normally, 
when you get into the summertime 
where it gets really hot—look here at 
May, June, July, August—the number 
of people coming to the border goes 
down, not up. It is over 100 degrees in 
the desert and at the Rio Grande, at al-
most all of these border crossings along 
the U.S.-Mexican border. Yet we have 
more, not less. 
There is anecdotal information that 
this is because people are realizing that 
the administration wants to end title 
42. They have proposed to do that. That 
is now in the court system. But the 
cartels are spreading the message, 
which is: Now is the time to come be-
cause, before, you were turned away by 
title 42. Now, like everybody else, you 
can come into the United States and 
stay. And we will talk in a moment 
about what that means. 
But I think that is probably true. 
Probably title 42 has something to do 
with it. But I think, also, it has to do 
with the fact that more and more peo-
ple are realizing that if they do come 
to the border and don’t get stopped by 
title 42, they will have a chance to 
come into the United States and live in 
the United States with their families, 
perhaps; if not, maybe bring in their 
families later. And everybody wants to 
come to America. We are a great coun-
try. 
We have our challenges, as we talk 
about on the floor here all the time. 
But, still, we are a country with so 
many opportunities for people, and 
folks want to come. And I don’t blame 
them. I don’t blame them. But we want 
them to come legally. 
And we currently have the most gen-
erous legal immigration system of any 
country in the world. About 900,000 peo-
ple a year—almost a million people a 
year—come 
legally 
to 
the 
United 
States, most as legal immigrants, some 
as refugees. And so we encourage that, 
and we should. 
In fact, I think we should bring more 
people in legally, particularly to fill

some of the jobs that we need filled, 
the STEM disciplines we talk about a 
lot. We need people with the kind of 
training and background to help our 
economy grow. But we need people at 
every level of training. But we want 
them to come legally and through an 
orderly process that is more humane, 
that doesn’t have all the issues—which 
we will talk about tonight—the hu-
manitarian issues at the southern bor-
der. 
In terms of title 42, we all hope that 
this public health emergency isn’t nec-
essary going forward because COVID–19 
ends. But in the meantime, this border 
crisis means, to me, that we have to 
keep title 42 in place until we make 
some changes in policy. Otherwise, it 
will be not just a crisis. It will be to-
tally overwhelming. 
As the Border Patrol says to me, 
they will lose operational control of 
the border. Some would argue that has 
already happened because so many peo-
ple are coming over at record numbers. 
Often, the Border Patrol is distracted 
by one group of migrants, and another 
group comes in. And I saw this when I 
was at the border in El Paso. And any-
body who has been down at the border 
has seen this. 
They are already in tough shape. But 
imagine if 48 percent of the people here 
who are now being turned away by title 
42 are not going to be turned away and 
the number of other people who will 
come knowing that that avenue is now 
open to them. This will be over-
whelming. 
It is very difficult right now, with 
the laws and the way the laws are 
being implemented, to keep that from 
happening. That is why we need a 
change in policy. It doesn’t have to 
happen here in Congress. I think we 
should change the laws and introduce 
legislation today to do that. But the 
administration itself could make these 
changes. 
By the way, in the last administra-
tion, as you can see, the number of peo-
ple coming across the border unlaw-
fully and the number of encounters was 
very low. But the same was true in the 
Obama administration. After they had 
a surge of unaccompanied minors, they 
made changes in the law, and they re-
duced the number of people who were 
coming unlawfully to the border as 
well. It can be done, but there has to be 
the will do it. 
I am the ranking Republican on the 
Senate committee that has oversight 
responsibility for the Department of 
Homeland Security. The Presiding Offi-
cer is also on that committee. This De-
partment of Homeland Security is pre-
paring, they tell us, for a huge increase 
in migrants after title 42 has ended. So 
although they want to end it, they also 
know that if they do end it, there is 
going to be a huge surge because they 
are actually preparing for that. 
The way they are doing it is inter-
esting. It is not so much keeping peo-
ple from coming into the United States 
as expediting their flow into the United 
States. Among other things, instead of 
processing people at the border, their 
recommendation is go ahead and put 
people on buses or other forms of trans-
portation and then do the processing 
later, perhaps on the buses or where 
they are going in the United States. So 
it is a way to move people through the 
process rather than come up with a 
way to discourage people from coming 
across the border illegally. 
DHS has planned, and then will fa-
cilitate, travel throughout the country 
rather than figuring out how to keep 
people from coming in the first place 
by telling them: Come legally, but 
please don’t come to our border ille-
gally. 
By the way, I think most Americans 
are very supportive of legal immigra-
tion. It is an important part of who we 
are. With very few exceptions of Native 
Americans, we all came from some-
place else. All of us have proud stories 
of our immigrant forebearers—our par-
ents, our grandparents, our great- 
grandparents. And it has enriched our 
country. It is part of the fabric of our 
Nation. It is what makes us special. 
But that is legal immigration. And it is 
not what we are talking about here. 
Who bears the brunt of this crisis? 
Well, at the outset, of course, it is the 
Border Patrol. We have got to provide 
them with the personnel and resources 
they need to complete their mission, as 
difficult as it is. 
When you go and meet with these 
people, the men and women of the Bor-
der Patrol, you come away just so 
proud of what they try to do every day. 
They are a combination of, you know, 
border agents trying to enforce the 
law, social workers trying to help peo-
ple with their problems, healthcare 
workers trying to help when people get 
hurt. Unfortunately, as we have seen, a 
lot of people are getting hurt in this 
process. That journey north is a dan-
gerous journey. 
And with the cartels so involved and 
right there at the border, what happens 
in the desert, what happens on these 
trains, what happens in these trucks— 
we just saw this horrible incident of 
these migrants who were jammed into 
a semitruck, and more of them died, I 
think, than any other accident of that 
kind, incident of that kind, in our his-
tory. But this is inhumane, and this is 
part of what happens when you have 
these cartels involved in this process. 
We also have got to provide the Bor-
der Patrol with the ability to help con-
trol things at the border by finishing 
the border fence and putting the tech-
nology with the fence that was always 
intended. 
By the way, the technology tends not 
to be very partisan around here. Demo-
crats and Republicans alike, I believe, 
mostly think we ought to have cam-
eras. We ought to have sensors. We 
ought to know what is going on at the 
border. But when the order came down 
the first day of the Biden administra-
tion to stop the wall and to end what 
the Trump administration had started 
with Congress’s approval and funding, 
they also said, Stop the technology. 
So in the El Paso sector, as an exam-
ple, the wall is about 80, 90 percent 
completed. Unfortunately, there are 
gaps in the wall where you literally 
have to have Border Patrol there 24 
hours a day or people just come 
through it, which makes their job real-
ly hard. What they want to do is at 
least have the wall there to slow people 
down. And the technology there en-
ables them to then go and deal with 
situations as they occur. But only 20 
percent of the technology had been 
completed. So you have more wall than 
you have technology. And the wall is 
not that useful, frankly, without the 
technology, in my view. I think the 
technology is the key. But that is what 
is happening. 
And, by the way, to the taxpayers lis-
tening tonight, which is pretty much 
all of us, we paid for that wall. We ac-
tually paid for the fencing to be put up. 
Congress appropriated the money. And 
then the administration stopped it. So 
you literally see the steel beams and 
the pieces of concrete for the wall 
lying on the ground. And as one Border 
Patrol agent told me when I was in one 
of the sectors—most recently I was in 
the Nogales sector where there is a 
huge gap—he said, this is really bad for 
morale. And our Border Patrol agents 
look at this stuff, and they say: We 
have already paid for this. Can’t we 
just finish the wall and put these 
fences up, the gates up, to keep these 
openings from attracting the cartels 
and the drug smugglers and the people 
smugglers? But that is where we are. 
So that is one thing our legislation 
does, is to correct that problem and 
help stop this crisis. 
It also says that title 42—we talked 
about earlier—won’t be lifted until the 
COVID–19 emergency is over. Again, I 
think it ought to be lifted when we 
have policies in place that make sense. 
But a lot more is needed. The bill also 
mandates that the program the Biden 
administration ended, which said that 
as you come to ask for asylum, you 
should wait at the border—it is called 
the migrant protocols. 
There was just an agreement with 
the President of Mexico and President 
Biden a couple of days ago about more 
funding for the border area—and that 
is good—to provide more humane living 
conditions. But this was working to 
tell people, if you want to come for 
asylum, go ahead and apply. And while 
you are waiting for asylum, you can re-
main in Mexico. And if you get asylum, 
you come across. If you don’t, you go 
home. What happened is, a lot of people 
just went home. 
The asylum process, which we will 
get into in a minute, is kind of a com-
plicated issue. But in other ways, it is 
pretty simple, and it is the main rea-
son for this, which is that people know 
if they come to the border and they 
claim asylum, which most people do, 
they have an immediate, what is 
called, credible fear interview. Some-
times, it is over the telephone now,

partly because of COVID. And that is a 
very low bar. And so people say what 
their issue is back home where they 
feel persecuted, and then they come in. 
And once they are told to come in, 
then they are told: OK, you can go to 
wherever you are going in America— 
let’s say Cincinnati, my hometown, or 
Columbus or Chicago or Denver, wher-
ever it is—and you need to check in 
with the ICE office—that is the immi-
gration office in the interior of the 
United States—within 90 days. 
Some people do check in. Some peo-
ple don’t check in. But the point is, 
there is now a wait of somewhere be-
tween 6 to 8 years before your case is 
heard on asylum—6 to 8 years. Why? 
Because there are 1.5 million—someone 
told me today 1.6 million; let’s say 1.5 
million people, that is high enough— 
waiting in line. That is what the back-
log is. 
It just makes no sense to anybody, 
including, by the way, the Secretary of 
Homeland 
Security, 
whom 
I 
have 
talked to about this. And these long 
waits mean that you are there embed-
ded in a community in America getting 
to know your community. You are 
joining your church. You are sending 
your kids to school. You are having 
children. You are part of the commu-
nity. And then you are told after 6 to 8 
years, by the way, your asylum appli-
cation is being denied because you are 
an economic refugee, not an asylee. In 
other words, you haven’t demonstrated 
a fear of persecution. You have come to 
this country, understandably, because 
there is great opportunity here. Again, 
we should be encouraging these people 
to come legally like so many other im-
migrants have over the years. 
Only about 15 to 20 percent of those 
people who apply for asylum today are 
getting asylum. So think about it. If 
you are part of the 80 to 85 percent who 
are not going to get asylum, there is 
sometimes not much of an incentive to 
enter into this process and go through 
the hearings and so on. 
The consequence if you don’t go 
through the hearings is that you are 
then subject to removal. However, we 
are just not removing people today. So 
this past year, the latest numbers we 
have are that 59,000 people were de-
ported, or removed, from America. 
About 66 percent of those people had a 
criminal background. But, remember, 
this is out of a couple hundred thou-
sand people going through the process. 
So there is a very small chance that 
you will ever be removed or deported. 
Even though you went through the 
process, you were denied asylum. You 
stay in the United States. And, you 
know, the next administration could 
change that. This administration could 
change that. But right now, this asy-
lum process, which was created to give 
lawful presence to people who were un-
able to be in their home country be-
cause of persecution, is not being used 
properly. It is being exploited by peo-
ple who know that because of our sys-
tem and our huge backlog, if they say 
that they are part of a group that is 
being persecuted they can come in. And 
even when they are denied asylum, 
they can stay. That is the way it is 
working. 
What we have found is that folks who 
come here are almost entirely focused 
more on the economic side. There was 
a survey conducted by the Migration 
Policy Institute recently, which, by 
the way, is a pro-migrant institution. 
It found that 90 percent of the Central 
Americans making the journey to our 
southern border are coming for what? 
For work. They are coming for work 
because they come from poor coun-
tries. They don’t have a lot of oppor-
tunity in their country. I don’t blame 
them. If I was a father living in Hon-
duras and couldn’t find a job or I was a 
subsistence farmer just barely making 
it and I had a few kids and I wanted 
them to have a better life, I would 
come, too. 
But that is not what immigration is 
all about. It is a system where you 
come legally, yes. But if you come ille-
gally, you have got to be told you have 
to go back and apply like everybody 
else. Otherwise, America would be 
overwhelmed. And it is being over-
whelmed and will be even more over-
whelmed if title 42 is taken away. 
There are hundreds of millions of peo-
ple—maybe billions of people—around 
the world who would love to come to 
this country. We take for granted our 
opportunities, our freedoms; but others 
don’t. 
So we have to have a system. We 
have to have some sort of a border. 
And, really, that is the question that is 
before us today in this body: Are we 
going to have a system that makes 
sense or one where, again, you have a 
million and a half people who are wait-
ing to have their hearing. When they 
have their hearing on asylum and they 
are denied, they still aren’t removed; 
so they can stay. And, again, mean-
while, they have family and kids and 
connections to the community. It is 
really not fair to them. A much better 
system would be to say, OK, apply for 
asylum in your country, or if you don’t 
feel comfortable there, apply from a 
third country. Then you will know, yes 
or no, before you come up to the bor-
der, don’t make that dangerous jour-
ney north. Don’t put yourself in the 
clutches of these coyotes, these human 
smugglers, these traffickers, who are 
heartless. What they are doing is they 
are going down to Central America or 
Latin America or really all over the 
world. People are coming from hun-
dreds of countries now. And they are 
saying, you know, give me money. Give 
me 10,000 bucks, and I will get you to 
the border, and you can just walk 
across. 
People are signing up—sometimes 
with their life savings. And sometimes 
as, again, we talked about earlier, 
there are assaults along the way. There 
are all kinds of horrible stories of how 
women, particularly, are mistreated on 
the way up. It is a dangerous and inhu-
mane process. 
At the end of the day, our system is 
pulling these people to the border. The 
administration is now implementing a 
new asylum rule recently to try to deal 
with this problem because they realize 
it is just not working. However, the 
new system that they are putting in 
place isn’t working either, and there is 
a reason for that. Their theory is we 
should adjudicate the cases at the bor-
der. I agree with that. I would rather 
adjudicate them outside the border in 
the country of origin or a third coun-
try, but have the adjudication be right 
at the border; make the decision right 
there, yes or no. Let people know. 
The problem is what they are doing 
right now is they are putting asylum 
officers at the border, making a deci-
sion, 
adjudicating 
as 
people 
come 
across. And if it is a no, people are not 
being sent home. But rather, people are 
being told if it is a no, you can appeal 
it to the regular system, so get back in 
line with the 1.5 million people. 
What we are learning is that, of 
course, people are smart. They are 
talking to the asylum officer. They are 
getting a yes or no. If they are getting 
a yes, that is great; they are getting in. 
That is a small percentage. If they are 
getting a no, they say, That is fine, I 
am going to appeal it to the regular 
system. 
It really isn’t an answer to the prob-
lem. If you want an answer to the prob-
lem, what you would have is processing 
centers along the border. It would be 
expensive because there are so many 
people coming over now, so many peo-
ple applying for asylum. But have a 
process where, quickly, you can adju-
dicate these cases. In the meantime, 
you would not have people be released 
into the interior but have them stay 
there to find out what the outcome of 
the case is. 
This pull system is bad for everybody 
except the smugglers. They are the 
ones who profit. They are the ones who 
are going to folks in places like Hon-
duras or Ecuador or, again, far-flung 
places—places 
in 
Eastern 
Europe, 
places in Asia—and telling people, Give 
me a bunch of money, and I will get 
you into the United States. 
We recently had this tragedy I men-
tioned in San Antonio. Fifty-three mi-
grants were left for dead in the Texas 
heat in the back of a tractor-trailer. 
They were just abandoned by their 
smuggler. They left them locked inside 
of this tractor-trailer. It is not the 
first time this has happened. But as I 
said earlier, 53 is probably the worst 
smuggling tragedy in our history. 
I went to Latin America last year. I 
met with the Presidents of Mexico and 
Guatemala, Ecuador, and Colombia. It 
was interesting. They all said the same 
thing. You would be surprised to hear 
what they said. People think they 
must enjoy this process because so 
many of their citizens are going to 
America, they can then send money 
back to their family and it must be 
good for everybody. It is not. 
They are losing some of the best and 
brightest in their country, and these

people are going through, again, this 
arduous process to get to the border, 
and the inhumanity of that troubles 
these Presidents. They all told me basi-
cally the same thing, which is: Why 
don’t you guys fix your laws and stop 
this pull factor? 
We talk about the push factor in poor 
countries. I mentioned Honduras ear-
lier. That is certainly true. By the 
way, we spent over the last 5 years 
about $3.6 billion of American taxpayer 
money to help in the economics of the 
so-called Northern Triangle in the Cen-
tral American countries. 
I am for spending money in these 
countries to try to help with their 
economy, but with the corruption, with 
all the issues they have, it is very dif-
ficult to imagine those countries in a 
short period of time having any kind of 
economic opportunity that equals what 
we have right here in this country, so 
there is going to continue to be that 
push. We should try to alleviate it. It 
will continue to happen. 
But the pull, this policy we have is 
just pulling people north. What they 
said to me, these Presidents of these 
countries, was: You have a legal immi-
gration system where people know 
they can just get into your country. 
Why don’t you change that? Why don’t 
you change that? 
Again, it is not just people from Mex-
ico and Central America. It is people 
from all over the world. 
By the way, for some of these people, 
the Border Patrol is increasingly con-
cerned because they come from coun-
tries where a lot of people want to do 
us harm. So, increasingly, we are see-
ing people coming to our country who 
are, as an example, on the terror watch 
list. 
Back in 2017, 2 people; 6 people in 
2018; none in 2019; 2020, there were 3; 15 
in 2021. This fiscal year, 2022, there are 
already 50 individuals on the terror 
watch list. Why? They know if they 
come to the U.S. border, they can get 
across. I am sure this number is high-
er—that is what we know—because, 
again, a lot of people are so-called got 
aways. Let’s say 20 percent. 
Who are these people? Well, some of 
them are probably pretty smart indi-
viduals who know how to get away 
from Border Patrol, do the distraction 
and sneak in. That worries me and it 
worries me because we are allowing 
people to come into our country who 
we would not otherwise allow. 
We have seen this increase of people 
coming into the country who are on 
the terror watch list, but we have also 
seen, again, a lot of people coming in 
who we just don’t know anything about 
because they don’t count them at the 
Border Patrol. We have seen more cara-
vans and we see more migrants are on 
the way. Why? I think it is because of 
this general pull factor. The fact is 
people know, if they come here, they 
know they are going to be able to get 
in. 
I think it is also because of title 42 
because the smugglers are using that— 
cartels are spreading the word: Title 42 
is on its way out. 
Read about it in the front page of 
your paper because that is where it is 
because this administration wants to 
end it, so they are saying now you can 
go to the border and you will be let in 
under the policies like the asylum pol-
icy and the single adults—48 percent of 
whom roughly have been turned away. 
Forty-eight percent of the total by 
title 42 would no longer be turned 
away. I think that is why we are seeing 
this. It is giving the coyotes, traf-
fickers, and smugglers opportunity to 
make lots of money. 
By the way, that is hurting all these 
countries, too. If you talk to the Presi-
dents of these countries, including 
President Obrador of Mexico, what he 
will tell you is the cartels are taking 
over more and more of his country be-
cause they are making more and more 
money because of this—and, signifi-
cantly, because of the drug issue we are 
going to talk about in a second. We 
know that the cartels are involved in 
human trafficking. We know they are 
involved in drug smuggling. We know 
they are involved in smuggling people. 
I was with the Border Patrol in El 
Paso last year. We were out at night. 
We saw a group of migrants coming, 
and the Border Patrol was going to 
that location to stop them and ques-
tion them. Meanwhile, we heard on the 
radio the drug smugglers had come 
across. They could see it. They knew 
it. They could tell by the backpacks 
they were wearing, I guess, and clothes 
they 
were 
wearing—dark 
clothes, 
young men—that they were smuggling. 
But they couldn’t do anything about it 
because Border Patrol were processing 
the migrants who had come in. 
So I am watching the migrants com-
ing in—actually talking to some of 
them and Border Patrol—and mean-
while, on the radio, they are saying, 
You have to go to this other sector, 
this other area to stop these drug 
smugglers. We can’t; we are distracted. 
The processing takes some time. 
The other big issue, in addition to 
the unlawful entry into the United 
States—smuggling, all the inhumanity 
that surrounds that—is this drug issue. 
I have spent a lot of time working on 
this issue on the prevention side—help-
ing on treatment and recovery options 
and doing more on prevention. We were 
making some progress until, unfortu-
nately, we were hit with this pandemic. 
And during that time and since, drug 
use has gone up again. But we were 
making progress, in part, because we 
were helping on the demand side of the 
equation. 
But also on the supply side, we were 
keeping some of these drugs out of the 
country. We did it primarily through 
stopping the deadliest of all, which is 
the fentanyl—which is a synthetic 
opioid—from coming in through the 
U.S. mail system. We passed a law 
called the STOP Act. It kept China 
from poisoning our communities by 
sending this stuff through the mail sys-
tem, which was happening. That was 
the primary way it was coming in. 
What has happened? During the pan-
demic—kind of coincidental with the 
pandemic—we had more people iso-
lated, more people losing their jobs, 
more people turning to drugs. You had 
Mexico begin to take the central role 
in terms of fentanyl. A lot of it is pre-
cursors from China, so China sends the 
precursors to Mexico, but Mexico is 
now making the fentanyl—often into 
pills—Xanax or Adderall or Percocet. 
If you buy any drugs on the street, 
know that those drugs could kill you. 
Don’t be fooled. There are so many 
counterfeit drugs out there now. That 
is one of the preferred ways that the 
Mexican cartels are bringing these 
drugs in. 
Again, fentanyl is, of course, the 
deadliest of the drugs. About two 
thirds of the overdose deaths in Amer-
ica are currently because of fentanyl. 
We now have a record level of overdose 
deaths every year in America, over 
100,000 last year. There is no reason to 
believe that it will be less than that 
this year based on early data we have, 
sadly. In my home State of Ohio, it is 
the No. 1 killer by far. 
Look at what has happened with the 
seizures 
of 
fentanyl. 
This 
is 
the 
fentanyl that has been seized. Here are 
projections for the rest of this year if 
they continue as they are—obviously, 
record levels. When you have this huge 
surge of fentanyl coming in, what hap-
pens is you have a lower cost in the 
drug—supply and demand, right? So 
there is a huge supply, and the demand 
for these drugs continues. 
On the streets of Columbus or Cleve-
land or Cincinnati or Dayton or your 
town, wherever it is, it is likely that 
this cheap but really deadly fentanyl is 
something that people are being ex-
posed to. Some people are falling prey 
to it, again, often thinking they are 
taking another drug. 
There are a couple of students at 
Ohio State University who overdosed 
and died just before I gave a talk there 
at graduation earlier this spring. They 
were taking what they thought were 
study drugs, apparently: Adderall. A 
third student lived, but was in critical 
condition. This is the deadliest of 
drugs. 
In 2021, we seized double the fentanyl 
from the previous year, four times 
from the year before that. Again, so far 
this year, we are on track to match the 
most fentanyl seized ever. In May—just 
1 month, in May—there was enough 
fentanyl seized at the border to kill 200 
million Americans, more than half of 
our population in 1 month. People say: 
Well, gosh, why are you so worried 
about the border? Let people come 
across—open border—whatever. 
Here is the consequence. 
Again, it is hurting Mexico, too, and 
it is hurting lots of other countries. 
But in terms of Mexico, this gives the 
cartels enormous power and money. 
And, yes, ultimately, I think the most 
important thing to do is to reduce de-
mand. I do.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S3284 
July 13, 2022 
Again, we are making progress now. 
We had about a 20-percent reduction in 
2018. We need to get back to that. This 
Congress took the lead on much of this. 
But we also have to deal with the 
supply side and stop this enormous 
surge of drugs that is coming over and 
poisoning our communities. That is 
part of what is happening on the bor-
der. A few months ago, I was in 
Nogales, south of Tucson, to ride with 
the Border Patrol and go to the port of 
entry there. They are doing a very 
good job with what they have, but they 
need better equipment. 
This is one thing Congress can do. 
They need help. They need more re-
sources. They need better technology. 
They need to be able to scan cars and 
trucks that are coming in, particularly 
for these drugs that we talked about. A 
relatively small package of fentanyl 
this size can kill 1,000 people. A few 
specks could kill you. It is easy to hide 
it in a car or a truck. 
We now know that less than 2 percent 
of passenger vehicles and less than 20 
percent of commercial vehicles coming 
into the United States are scanned for 
these illegal drugs like fentanyl. This 
is just unacceptable. Congress has ap-
propriated more funding for this. That 
is good. Let’s get it moving. We should 
be scanning all vehicles, in my view. A 
smuggler with multiple pounds of 
fentanyl concealed in a hidden com-
partment might be worth hundreds of 
thousands or even millions of dollars. 
They know they have a good chance of 
getting across without a search. They 
take the risk. 
It is not just a gap in our security; it 
is a gaping hole. And, again, it leads to 
this flood of cheap fentanyl and other 
dangerous drugs. The southern border 
has faced the worst unlawful crisis that 
we have ever had, going back to the 
first chart. This tells the story, in red. 
The men and women of the Customs 
and Border Protection whom I have 
met over the years are doing the best 
they can. They are doing their best at 
the ports of entry. They are doing their 
best as Border Patrol between the 
ports of entry, but they need help. That 
is what legislation does. It provides 
them with the help they need to be 
able to respond to this crisis. 
We welcome legal immigration. We 
always should. They enrich our coun-
try. And we are a nation of immi-
grants, and we are proud of that. But 
we are also a nation of laws, and we are 
also a nation that cares about the in-
humanity of the current system and 
the flood of cheap, deadly drugs coming 
through our border. 
I urge the Biden administration to 
change course, to fix this broken sys-
tem, to follow the law, including the 
law on detaining people, to reform the 
asylum process so it stops acting like a 
pull factor and is used for what it is in-
tended for, to truly help those who are 
seeking asylum for the right reasons, 
to stop these policies that send a green 
light to the smugglers, to the cartels, 
to the drug traffickers, and that is 
causing so much human suffering along 
our southern border. 
I urge the administration to act. In 
the meantime, again, we are intro-
ducing legislation. I urge my col-
leagues to help us with that. There is 
no reason that we can’t work in a bi-
partisan way to deal with what every-
body has to acknowledge is a huge cri-
sis at our southern border. 
I yield the floor.

CELEBRATING 20 YEARS OF 
BARRIO CAFE´  
HON. RUBEN GALLEGO 
OF ARIZONA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, July 13, 2022 
Mr. GALLEGO. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to celebrate the 20th anniversary of 
Barrio Cafe´. Since 2002, Barrio Cafe´ has been 
a Phoenix institution, serving up world-re-
nowned Mexican food and promoting Mexican 
American arts and culture. 
Barrio Cafe´ was founded by Chef Silvana 
Salcido Esparza and her business partner, 
Wendy Gruber. Chef Silvana grew up in the 
Central Valley of California, learning to cook at 
her grandmother’s side and in her family’s 
bakery. Since opening Barrio Cafe´, she has 
been featured in Sunset Magazine, Esquire 
Magazine, and Food Network’s Diners, Drive 
Ins and Dives, and she has been a finalist for 
the James Beard Award. Now, she is men-
toring the next generation of chefs and small 
business owners. 
Chef Silvana is also a community leader in 
her own right. She has tirelessly advocated for 
the rights of all in Arizona and has worked to 
feed those in need during the COVID–19 pan-
demic. Her leadership and vision have trans-
formed a stretch of 16th Street into ‘Calle 16,’ 
a hub for local economic development, flour-
ishing with Mexican art, murals, culture, and 
food. 
For 20 years, Chef Silvana and the Barrio 
Cafe´ have embodied ‘comida chingona’. I am 
lucky to get to call Chef Silvana and Wendy 
friends, and I wish them all the best on 20 
more years of Barrio Cafe´.

CELEBRATING COLFAX’S 150TH 
ANNIVERSARY 
HON. CATHY McMORRIS RODGERS 
OF WASHINGTON 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, July 13, 2022 
Mrs. RODGERS of Washington. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the 150th 
anniversary of the founding of Colfax, Wash-
ington. This small town in Eastern Washington 
is known for its productive farmland and fam-
ily-oriented atmosphere. Colfax is also the 
county seat of Whitman County—the largest 
wheat producing county in America—and is a 
hub for wheat growers that feeds our region 
and people all around the world. 
The history of Colfax is a rich one with roots 
dating back to the late 1800s. First settled by 
James Perkins and Thomas Smith, the town 
was founded on July 10, 1870 and named 
after Schuyler Colfax, the 17th Vice President 
of the United States and 25th Speaker of the 
House of Representatives. 
Today, the town continues to thrive amidst 
the beautiful rolling hills and fertile countryside 
of the Palouse. Complete with a healthy quan-
tity of history, opportunities, great education, 
family values, exciting culture, and so much 
more, it is without a doubt that wonderful 
things continue to grow in Colfax. 
As the representative in Congress for this 
one-of-a-kind town, I am so inspired by 
Colfax’s heritage of family values. The families 
here understand the value of a hard day’s 
work on the farm and the invaluable life skills 
and lessons that come with it. Parents give 
everything to prepare their children to pursue 
the American Dream, whether that is one day 
taking over the family business or graduating 
college and starting a new career. The people 
of Colfax truly embody what it means to be 
from Eastern Washington, and they make it 
one of the best places to live in the world. 
Madam Speaker, on this most special day, 
I ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing 
Colfax’s 150 years of remarkable history and 
celebrating their personification of the Amer-
ican spirit.

HONORING WAR HERO AND 
TRAILBLAZER LUIS R. SIERRA 
HON. BRIAN HIGGINS 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, July 13, 2022 
Mr. HIGGINS of New York. Madam Speak-
er, I rise today to honor Luis Sierra. Mr. Sierra 
bravely defended our country during the Viet-
nam War and earned a Bronze Star Medal, 
the fourth highest military decoration for valor. 
Born on December 2, 1949, Luis Sierra 
grew up in Cidra, Puerto Rico. Eventually 
moving with his family to the city of Ponce, Mr. 
Sierra was raised in a Roman Catholic house-
hold and was an avid player of baseball and 
basketball as an adolescent. After graduating 
high school in 1967, Mr. Sierra spent the next 
two years working as a Linotype operator. 
Mr. Sierra left his job and enlisted in the 
Army on August 29, 1969. He spent the first 
few months of his service in Fort Jackson, 
South Carolina until he was called to join the 
2nd Battalion, 5th Cavalry in the Republic of 
Vietnam. Arriving on March 18, 1970, his unit 
participated in numerous battles which re-
sulted in 22 members of the unit, including 
Specialist Sierra, being awarded a Bronze 
Star Medal for meritorious service against a 
hostile enemy. 
Along with the Bronze Star Medal, Mr. Si-
erra received multiple other awards for his 
service including the Vietnam Service Medal 
with three bronze service stars, the National 
Defense Service Medal, Republic of Vietnam 
Campaign Ribbon with the 1960 Device, the 
Sharpshooter Badge with Rifle Bar, and the 
Vietnam Veteran Lapel pin. 
Mr. Sierra was honorably discharged from 
active duty on April 2, 1971 and he remained 
in the Reserves until his service ended on July 
23, 1975. 
Upon his return home, Mr. Sierra married 
Silvia M. Gonza´lez with whom he had 3 chil-
dren: Rau´l J. Sierra, Silvette Sierra, and

Esmeralda Sierra. While Rau´l sadly passed 
away in 2021, Silvette is employed as a Span-
ish Speaking Employment Counselor at the 
Erie County Department of Social Services, 
and Esmeralda is the current president of the

Bill. He then completed his Juris Doctor and 
began working in Ponce, Puerto Rico as an 
Administrative Judge for the Department of 
Consumer Affairs. Mr. Sierra also opened a 
private law practice in Puerto Rico, and 
worked there until moving to Buffalo. In Buf-
falo, Mr. Sierra worked for the New York State 
Division of Human Rights as a Human Rights 
Specialist until his retirement. 
Luis Sierra was one of more than 80,000 
Hispanic Americans to serve during the Viet-

tion, bravely defended our country. We thank 
Mr. Sierra for his contributions to the war effort 
and his exemplary behavior while enlisted in 
the military. 
Today, we join the Hispanic Heritage Coun-

achievements of Mr. Luis Sierra. Madam 
Speaker, we stand together today alongside 
Mr. Sierra, his family, and other Hispanic- 
American service members for whom we are 
eternally grateful.

PERSONAL EXPLANATION 
HON. VICKY HARTZLER 
OF MISSOURI

TRIBUTE TO A GREAT AMERICAN 
HON. CHRIS STEWART 
OF UTAH 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, July 13, 2022 
Mr. STEWART. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to pay tribute to a great American, Mr. 
Ed Mahen who died this past fall. Edward C. 
Mahen, Jr., was a dedicated civil servant, an 
Air Force combat veteran and an extraordinary 
engineer. Ed worked for the National Recon-
naissance Office (NRO) for more than 23 
years. Prior to his work for the NRO, he hon-
orably served for 27 years as an active duty 
officer for the United States Air Force, includ-
ing as a veteran of the Vietnam War. 
Ed was always excited about his work. He 
was fascinated by science his entire life, and 
he served as a trailblazer throughout his ca-
reer. He was a leader, a driving force behind 
innovation, and a model of procurement excel-
lence. Recognized for his contributions, he re-
ceived a number of awards over his career, in-
cluding that of Pioneer of National Reconnais-
sance. His work profoundly influenced the 
NRO’s capabilities, and he has left an indelible 
mark across the Intelligence Community (IC). 
Born in rural Missouri, Ed was raised by his 
mother and father who were born during the 
Great Depression. His upbringing was greatly 
influenced by his parents’ experience, as he 
was taught the importance of frugality, hard 
work, self-reliance and family loyalty. 
Once Ed entered high school, he was ex-
posed to his first experience with formal edu-
cation. He grew up in the post-World War II 
period with its proliferation of science and 
technology, including rockets and nuclear 
weapons. While still living at home, Ed built a 
high-frequency radio telescope to listen to the 
radio emissions of the planet Jupiter as it 
would rise at night. In high school, he excelled 
in science and math. After graduation, Ed 
worked his way through the University of Mis-
souri and graduated with a bachelor’s degree 
in physics and a master’s degree in electrical 
engineering. 
In 1969, Ed Mahen was drafted for the Viet-
nam War and joined the United States Air 
Force. His formal education was over, but Ed 
was a firm believer in life-long learning. He 
stated, ‘‘Education is a continuum. It doesn’t 
stop when you get a degree, and you have to 
continue to learn. So I never stopped going to 
school; I just stopped going to formal school 
. . . If I want to learn cryptography, I go off 
and study cryptography for a while. And I 
could figure it out. I could learn about it and 
apply it . . . So you just never stop learning.’’ 
From May 1972 to May 1973, Ed Mahen 
took an assignment on an AC–130 gunship in 
Vietnam. As was the case for many young 
Americans, this was a time of harrowing con-
flict and quick growth as he matured in a com-
bat zone. In 1972 alone, the squadron lost 
one-fourth of its airplanes. Ed reflected, ‘‘It 
was the first time anybody really tried to kill 
me. We tried to die a lot of times.’’ in that 
year, Ed earned two distinguished flying 
crosses and eleven air medals, and he flew 
144 combat missions. At the end of his tour, 
Ed returned to the United States and served 
in various assignments in the Air Force, in-
cluding overseeing all of the classified stra-
tegic and electronic warfare programs. He also 
served as a technical director for the Defense 
Advanced 
Research 
Projects 
Agency 
(DARPA). 
In 1996, Ed Mahen went to work for the 
Secretary of Defense to help resolve the situa-
tion in the Balkans, serving as the Director of 
the Bosnian Command and Control Initiative. 
He helped establish a peace-keeping mission 
with no loss of life and kept the price tag with-
in budget. 
Upon his return to the United States, as a 
Colonel in July 1997, the logical next step was 
promotion to Brigadier General. However, this 
would entail an assignment away from his 
family across the country. His upbringing and 
lessons from his parents meant putting family 
first. So he retired from a highly successful ca-
reer in the Air Force. 
In 1998, as a civilian, Ed Mahen was re-
cruited by the Director of the NRO to join the 
agency, where he served as the Chief Tech-
nology Officer for the Advanced Systems and 
Technology Directorate. In the years that fol-
lowed, he was recognized repeatedly for his 
many contributions in the field of national re-
connaissance. His work defeated current and 
emerging threats from terrorism and nuclear 
weapons proliferation—he became a standard 
of success at the NRO. 
In 2009, Ed was nominated for the NRO Di-
rector’s Award for Excellence in Acquisition. 
This time he was recognized for developing 
capabilities that ‘‘have yielded actionable intel-
ligence and made significant contributions to 
IC missions.’’ Further, ‘‘his mission-focused, 
technically driven, and results-oriented leader-
ship has and will continue to deliver revolu-
tionary new capabilities to help counter the 
most critical threats to our Nation’s security.’’ 
As well as his technical accomplishments, he 
served as a role model and mentor for his 
team. 
In January 2020, Ed Mahen was named a 
Pioneer of National Reconnaissance, the high-
est award offered by the NRO. The Director of 
the NRO, Dr. Chris Scolese noted, ‘‘Mr. 
Mahen’s work enabled intelligence analysts to 
understand adversary capabilities and intent 
and helped our warfighters locate and track 
adversaries.’’ 
Ed Mahen was a remarkable leader, apply-
ing the lessons learned over a lifetime of ex-
perience and focusing that knowledge on 
practical, technical problem solving for national 
security challenges. He developed a unique 
ability to hire junior people and groom them 
into subject matter experts. He explained, 
‘‘The key to program management, the first 
thing you do is put yourself out of business. 
So the first thing you do is hire the people 
who are going to replace you. So this program 
pretty much runs itself . . . it’s sort of the bib-
lical story of teaching people to fish. Teach 
people to be self-sufficient.’’ 
Ed was a storyteller, and he maintained a 
sense of humor. He illustrated his work at the 
NRO by telling the story of ‘‘Stone Soup,’’ con-
cluding, ‘‘A lot of these programs are finding 
the pieces to stitch together so that you can 
do things very quickly.’’ Most importantly, he 
never lost his enthusiasm and wonder for the 
accomplishments of the NRO. He once re-
flected, ‘‘I think the NRO is a magic place. 
And I think with visionary leadership, the NRO 
could do anything.’’ 
After nearly 50 years of service to the coun-
try, and still an active innovator, Ed Mahen 
passed away on September 29, 2021. Madam 
Speaker, our Nation has been blessed and 
prospered with greater national security by the 
lifetime of service of Ed Mahen. May he rest 
in peace and may his wife and family be com-
forted knowing their husband and father was a 
true patriot—one who endlessly loved them 
and his country.

TRIBUTE TO VIETNAM WAR 
VETERAN ARTURO LARA 
HON. JOAQUIN CASTRO 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, July 13, 2022 
Mr. CASTRO of Texas. Madam Speaker, 
today I rise in honor of United States Air Force 
Veteran Arturo Lara, who passed away on 
May 8, 2020. Mr. Lara hailed from my home-
town of San Antonio, Texas and is survived by 
his wife of 58 years, Consuelo R. Lara, eldest 
son Arturo R. Lara, Jr., daughter Elizabeth R. 
Lara, and youngest son Louis R. Lara. Al-
though I am saddened to learn of his passing, 
I am confident his memory will live on through 
his many loved ones. 
Arturo Lara was born in San Antonio, Texas 
on July 16, 1943, to Simon and Alfonsa 
Vargas Lara. At a young age, Mr. Lara knew 
he wanted to be a family man and to serve his 
country. With permission from his grandfather, 
Simon Lara, he enlisted in the United States 
Air Force at the age of 16. Mr. Lara coura-
geously served our country for 24 years, tak-
ing on different duty assignments across the 
globe. Mr. Lara notably served on high-risk 
missions as an Air Commando under Special 
Forces. During the Vietnam conflict, Mr. Lara 
was captured by enemy forces for 90 days to 
later escape shortly after his 18th birthday. 
Upon retiring from the Air Force, Mr. Lara 
went on to civil service and worked at Kelly Air 
Force Base in San Antonio and Fort Hood in 
Killeen, Texas. After 51 years of combined 
military and civil service, Mr. Lara retired in 
2011. 
Madam Speaker, I am proud to recognize 
the life and service of a person who dedicated 
themselves to family and country. The sac-
rifice and commitment our service members 
undertake is immeasureble and should never 
be taken for granted. We thank Mr. Lara for 
his many years of service and commitment to 
our great country.

INTRODUCTION 
OF 
THE 
FOOD 
SAFETY 
ADMINISTRATION 
ACT 
OF 2022 
HON. ROSA L. DeLAURO 
OF CONNECTICUT 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, July 13, 2022 
Ms. DELAURO. Madam Speaker, today I 
rise in support of the Food Safety Administra-
tion Act, which I am introducing—along with 
Senator DICK DURBIN—today. 
The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) 
regulates about 80 percent of our food sup-
ply—and consumers and industry depend on 
the FDA food program to perform its regu-
latory role. Every year, nearly 48 million peo-
ple get sick from one of the 31 pathogens 
known to cause foodborne illness. This results 
in 128,000 Americans being hospitalized each 
year—and 
3,000 
Americans 
dying 
of 
foodborne diseases. This is common, costly— 
and preventable. 
It is becoming increasingly clear that public 
confidence in the ability of the FDA to protect 
our food supply is diminishing. Between inad-
equate responses to recalls, a failure to imple-
ment a culture of outbreak prevention, and 
proposed rules and initiatives that languish for 
years, the food program has struggled in its 
role to protect consumers. 
The recent infant formula crisis, exacerbated 
by substandard safety practices at the Abbott 
Nutrition facility in Sturgis, Michigan, cannot 
be allowed to happen again. Parents and 
caregivers should never have to desperately 
scramble to find infant formula and wonder 
how they will feed their children. And when or 
if they finally find formula, they face an impos-
sible choice as they wonder whether it is safe 
for consumption. We should not have to 
choose between safety and supply when it 
comes to feeding our babies. I reject this false 
and dangerous dichotomy. This was a colos-
sal failure of Abbott Nutrition and the FDA, 
which dragged its feet to investigate a whistle-
blower report that unveiled damning allega-
tions of wrongdoing and neglect of Abbott. 
Food safety is currently a second-class cit-
izen at the FDA. It is clear that food safety is 
not prioritized at the FDA, which has the au-
thority to appoint an empowered Deputy Com-
missioner of Foods with a relevant background 
in food safety—but has yet to do so. The lack 
of a single, full-time expert leader affects all 
aspects of FDA’s food program. And perhaps 
the most significant impact is the delayed im-
plementation of the Food Safety Modernization 
Act and the New Era of Smarter Food Safety 
blueprint. These key initiatives depend on all 
FDA food program units, like the Center for 
Food Safety and Applied Nutrition, Center for 
Veterinary Medicine, and the Office of Regu-
latory Affairs—working together with state 
partners and with a common strategic direc-
tion, clear priorities, adequate resource man-
agement, and internal accountability. 
That is why I am introducing the Food Safe-
ty Administration Act that would establish the 
Food Safety Administration under the Depart-
ment of Health and Human Services by incor-
porating these existing food programs within 
FDA into this separate agency. This agency 
would be led by a food safety expert con-
firmed by the Senate. 
This bicameral legislation will bring focused 
leadership and more accountability, a unified 
structure and a full-time senior leader who will 
strengthen oversight of the food supply and 
enhance the industry’s ability to operate effec-
tively.

RECOGNIZING CECELIA ‘‘CECE’’ 
KING 
HON. CAROLYN B. MALONEY 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, July 13, 2022 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New York. 
Madam Speaker, I rise to pay tribute to 
Cecelia ‘‘Cece’’ King, on the occasion of her 
appointment as a John Robert Lewis (JRL) 
Scholar by The Faith & Politics Institute (FPI) 
in recognition of her civic engagement and de-
sire to create effective social change. 
Ms. King was born in New York, New York 
and attended Riverdale Country School. Dur-
ing her time in high school, Ms. King was ap-
pointed as a voting member on Manhattan 
Community Board 8. She sat on the Land 
Use, Small Business, and Youth, Education, 
and Libraries Committees, and was a constant 
advocate for her community. During her junior 
year, Ms. King spent a semester at the School 
for Ethics and Global Leadership in Wash-
ington, D.C. 
Ms. King now studies Arabic and Geog-
raphy as a student at Dartmouth College, 
where she continues her dedication to social 
equity. Ms. King has been an active member 
of the Coalition for Immigration Reform and 
Equality at Dartmouth and the Sexual Violence 
Prevention Project. As a major in Geography, 
Ms. King has studied global movements and 
displacements, and together with her fellow 
students, some of whom were refugees them-
selves, formed the Dartmouth Displaced Stu-
dents and Scholars Initiative, which aims to 
support displaced students on campus. 
Outside of her education, Ms. King con-
tinues her service. She has worked as an in-
terpreter for asylum seekers through legal clin-
ics in New York and Texas, created a docu-
mentary film about the challenges COVID–19 
posed to artists, and is a founding-member of

Curious Cardinals, an e-learning startup that 
develops personalized learning models for stu-
dents. 
The FPI has recognized Ms. King’s dedica-
tion by selecting her as one of their 2022 JRL 
Scholars. Each year, the FPI selects 20 civic- 
minded student leaders through a competitive 
application process. The JRL Scholars & Fel-
lows Program is designed for undergraduate 
scholars and graduate student fellows to ex-
amine Lewis’s nonviolent philosophy from a 
historical perspective; define its principles and 
strategies; and identify their applicability to 
modern times and movements, current issues, 
and everyday life. The JRL Scholars & Fel-
lows will become a nationwide network of 
emerging leaders who will be inspired to cre-
ate positive societal change from the revolu-
tionary nonviolent perspective that was em-
ployed with success in the Civil Rights Move-
ment. 
As a JRL scholar, Ms. King will focus her 
scholarship project on issues surrounding im-
migration. Inspired by her grandmother’s immi-
gration story as a daughter of Holocaust sur-
vivors, Ms. King is driven to share stories of 
displacement and advocate for immigrant and 
refugee support and solidarity. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in recognizing the accomplishments of 
Cecelia King. Her dedication and leadership 
have served not only her community but have 
guided her to be an effective social change-
maker. Ms. King carries these esteemed val-
ues as she joins the next generation of lead-
ers of our Nation.

HONORING DR. GLENDA BASKIN 
GLOVER 
HON. FREDERICA S. WILSON 
OF FLORIDA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, July 13, 2022 
Ms. WILSON of Florida. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to honor Dr. Glenda Baskin Glover. 
Dr. Glover is a native of Memphis, Ten-
nessee. As the daughter of a civil rights activ-
ist and from a family immersed in the Move-
ment, she determined early that education and 
equal justice were important for all people of 
color. She began her educational development 
as a student at Tennessee State University, 
where she majored in mathematics. After 
graduating with honors with a Bachelor of 
Science degree, she earned the Master of 
Business Administration at Clark Atlanta Uni-
versity in 1976. She completed her doctorate 
in business from George Washington Univer-
sity in 1990 and completed her law degree 
from the Georgetown University Law Center in 
1994. She is a certified public accountant, a li-
censed attorney, and one of a handful of Afri-
can American women to hold the Ph.D.-CPA- 
J.D. combination in the United States. 
Dr. Glenda Baskin Glover returned to her 
alma mater to serve as President of Ten-
nessee State University on January 2, 2013. 
She is the institution’s eighth and first female 
president. She has advanced a five-point vi-
sion that includes: academic progress and 
customer service, fund raising and partner-
ships, diversity and inclusion, shared govern-
ance, and business outreach. Under President 
Glover’s leadership, the University’s academic 
offerings have increased to 45 bachelor’s de-
grees, 24 master’s degrees and seven doc-
torate degrees. 
I salute this effort to close opportunity and 
access gaps for historically underrepresented 
students in colleges and universities. TSU is 
continuing to show that institutions can be 
hubs for providing pathways to access post- 
secondary educational instruction, connect 
students with emerging economic opportuni-
ties, and inspire them to fulflll their promise 
and potential. 
In addition to her academic success, Dr. 
Glover is the International President and CEO 
of Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, Incorporated, 
the oldest Greek-letter organization estab-
lished by African American college women. Dr. 
Glover leads the prestigious 114-year-old or-
ganization of nearly 300,000 members and 
1026 chapters located all over the world. 
I am thankful to President Dr. Glenda Glov-
er and the entire university team for providing 
students with the opportunity of a lifetime to 
pursue a higher education and run toward 
their dreams at Tennessee State University.

CELEBRATING 30 YEARS OF 
EQUALITY ARIZONA 
HON. RUBEN GALLEGO 
OF ARIZONA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, July 13, 2022 
Mr. GALLEGO. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to congratulate Equality Arizona on its 
30th anniversary. For three decades, Equality 
Arizona has been fighting for the rights of 
LGBTQ+ Arizonans to fully participate in so-
cial, economic, and civic life. They have done 
this by building a diverse community of sup-
port and engaging with all levels of govern-
ment. 
In response to the HIV/AIDS epidemic, 
Equality Arizona started in 1992 to support 
those living with HIV and AIDS and to repeal 
discriminatory laws that criminalized LGBTQ+ 
lives. Since then, they have continued that 
work in the campaigns to repeal ‘‘Don’t Ask, 
Don’t Tell’’ and pass marriage equality. Just in 
the past year, Equality Arizona has helped 
pass non-discrimination ordinances in Glen-
dale and Tolleson, both of which are in my 
district, and in Mesa and Scottsdale. I cannot 
wait to see the great work they will do over 
the next 30 years. 
I would like to congratulate Equality Arizona 
on their 30th anniversary and thank them for 
their tireless efforts to support the LGBTQ+ 
community in Arizona and across the country.

HONORING DR. TONY Q. CHAN 
HON. MELANIE A. STANSBURY 
OF NEW MEXICO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, July 13, 2022 
Ms. STANSBURY. Madam Speaker, I rise 
to honor Dr. Tony Q. Chan’s incredible con-
tributions to our beloved New Mexico commu-
nity. This Saturday, July 17th, Dr. Chan and 
his family will celebrate his 90th birthday. Over 
the more than 60 years that he has called 
New Mexico his home, Dr. Chan spent 40 of 
those years operating his optometry practice 
with an unmatched commitment to his patients 
and our community. 
Dr. Chan was born in Massachusetts and 
grew up in Mississippi, where he met his 
beautiful wife, Carolyn. After attending the Illi-
nois College of Optometry, where he earned 
his BS and Doctor of Optometry, he headed 
out west. Dr. Chan first moved to Albu-
querque, New Mexico, in 1959 when he broke 
barriers to become our state’s first Asian 
American optometrist. 
Dr. Chan did not stop there. In addition to 
opening his first practice, he eventually be-
came President of the Heights Lion’s Club, the 
Executive Association of Greater Albuquerque, 
and the New Mexico Optometric Association. 
He was also the first Asian American Trustee 
for the American Optometric Association. Dur-
ing his time at the American Optometrist Asso-
ciation, he served on the Minority Recruitment 
Committee, where he helped recruit women 
and minorities to become optometrists. 
Throughout his life, Dr. Chan received a va-
riety of accolades from organizations across 
the United States, including the Spirit of Amer-
ica Award from the Chinese American Citizens 
Alliance, the Alumnus of the Year award from 
the Illinois College of Optometry, and he was 
inducted into the National Optometry Hall of 
Fame in 2020. 
Happy Birthday to Dr. Chan. I thank him for 
his lifelong service caring for the health and 
well-being of the people of New Mexico. His 
love of community shines through everything 
he does, and I am honored to serve Dr. Chan 
in Congress and celebrate 90 years of his 
achievements.

Among Mr. Kadens’ many efforts to give 
back, Hope Chicago is one project that stands 
out as a testament to the values of leadership, 
philanthropy, and selflessness that make 
America so great. Founded by Pete Kadens 
and businessman Ted Koenig, the Hope Chi-
cago project aims to raise at least $1 billion 
over the next decade to fund post-secondary 
scholarships and non-tuition costs for grad-
uates of Chicago Public Schools and their 
adult family members who are eager to return 
to school and update their own skills. 
At a time when we are all fighting to create 
a more equitable economy and expand path-
ways into the middle class, removing barriers 
to educational attainment is critical. This is es-
pecially true in light of our nation’s student 
loan crisis, which has saddled far too many 
Americans with crippling debt and made the 
prospect of post-secondary education even 
more out of reach for many low-income, first- 
generation students. It is estimated that 9 in 
10 low-income, first-generation students drop 
out of higher education without a degree, and 
in my home state of Illinois, 61 percent of col-
lege grads who do earn a degree leave with 
debt. College is supposed to be a great equal-
izer in our country. Instead, these statistics 
provide a picture of higher education that ex-
acerbates inequality between the haves and 
have-nots across America. 
While we face significant challenges in over-
coming this issue, leaders like Pete Kadens 
have committed to doing the hard work need-
ed to create more opportunities for disadvan-
taged youth to obtain an advanced education. 
With the support and investment of partner 
schools and colleges, nonprofits, and cor-
porate and philanthropic donors, Hope Chi-
cago is fostering multigenerational change by 
working to enable approximately 30,000 indi-
viduals in the City of Chicago to go to college 
or trade school during the next decade. Just 
this year, Pete announced that Hope Chicago 
would cover full tuition costs for students at 
five high schools across Chicago, There is a 
long way to go, but the spirit of service that in-
spires this project is already transforming 
countless lives. 
We could all benefit by dedicating our own 
time and resources to the cause of expanding 
opportunity for those in need and following the 
example set by Pete Kadens and Hope Chi-
cago to create an America that prioritizes eq-
uitable access to education for all its children. 
After all, our future depends on it.

HONORING NOBEL LAUREATE 
ARDEM PATAPOUTIAN 
HON. MIKE LEVIN 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, July 13, 2022 
Mr. LEVIN of California. Madam Speaker, it 
is my great honor today to recognize Dr. 
Ardem 
Patapoutian, 
a 
constituent, 
a 
neuroscientist, and a Nobel Laureate, who 
was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or 
Medicine in 2021. 
Dr. Ardem Patapoutian was born in Leb-
anon in 1967 to Armenian parents. The 
youngest of three children, Ardem lived in Bei-
rut until 1986 when he emigrated to Los Ange-
les, California, to escape the Lebanese Civil 
War. 
Upon arriving to the United States, Dr. 
Patapoutian worked as an editor for the 
English section of an Armenian newspaper 
and a pizza delivery driver before being ac-
cepted into the cell and developmental biology 
program at the University of California, Los 
Angeles, an admission that changed the 
course of his professional life. 
Falling in love with research, he would go 
on to obtain a Ph.D. in Biology from the Cali-
fornia Institute of Technology in 1996, and a 
postdoctoral appointment at the University of 
California, San Francisco. In 2000, he began 
the work at the Scripps Research Institute in 
La Jolla, California, that awarded him the 
Nobel Prize 21 years later. 
Before being honored with the Nobel Prize, 
Dr. Patapoutian achieved a distinguished ca-
reer as a scientist and professor. He was a 
co-recipient of, among many other awards, the 
2020 Kavli Prize in Neuroscience. He is a 
member of the National Academy of Sciences, 
the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. 
and a fellow at the American Association for 
the Advancement of Science. He has main-
tained a full professorship at Scripps Research 
since 2008 and is an investigator at the How-
ard Hughes Medical Institute. 
Dr. 
Patapoutian’s 
work 
focuses 
on 
mechanosensation, the process by which me-
chanical stimuli convert into biological signals 
that influence the functions of our bodies. Spe-
cifically, Dr. Patapoutian was awarded the 
Nobel Prize for his discoveries of how our 
body feels and processes temperature and 
touch. His breakthrough research will not only 
further the understanding of how our bodies 
work, but it will help create better medications 
and therapies to treat neuropathic pain, hyper-
tension, blood disorders, and other conditions, 
improving the lives of residents of California’s 
49th Congressional District, our country, and 
the world.

HONORING THE LIFE OF TZEITEL 
PARAS-CARACCI 
HON. GRACE F. NAPOLITANO 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, July 13, 2022 
Mrs. NAPOLITANO. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today with a heavy heart to honor the life of 
the incomparable Tzeitel Paras-Caracci, who 
proudly served the City of Duarte as Mayor 
Pro Tem until her passing on June 25 at the 
age of 49, after a 3-year battle against lung 
cancer. 
Born August 8, 1972, in Quezon City, Phil-
ippines, Ms. Paras-Caracci and her family 
moved to Duarte in 1985. She graduated from 
Duarte High School in 1989 and went on to 
graduate from the Woodbury University in Bur-
bank before returning home to her beloved 
city. 
A trailblazing, dedicated, and caring public 
servant, Ms. Paras-Caracci was the first Fili-
pino-American to be elected to the Duarte City 
Council. She served as mayor in 2006, 2011, 
2015, and 2019, and was the longest sitting 
United 
States 
Filipino-American 
municipal 
elected official in office. 
Ms. Paras-Caracci participated in many 
32nd District Congressional events, always 
proud to represent her city. She was a mem-
ber of the National League of Cities Board of 
Directors, the League of California Cities 
Board of Directors, and President of the Asian 
Pacific American Municipal Officials. She was 
also a director for the Los Angeles County 
Sanitation Districts, a governing board mem-
ber of Foothill Transit, a board member of the 
Duarte Community Coordinating Council, and 
she was also a long-time member of the 
Duarte Woman’s Club. One of her proudest 
accomplishments was initiating the Mayor’s 
Youth Council to help students become famil-
iar and active with government. 
Ms. Paras-Caracci is survived by her par-
ents, Lino and Russel Paras; her husband, 
K.C. Caracci, stepdaughter, Dr. Blake Caracci, 
and their son, Jack Russell; and her brothers, 
Bertrand and John Paul George. 
I extend my deepest sympathies to the fam-
ily, colleagues, friends, and constituents of 
Tzeitel Paras-Caracci, and I urge all my col-
leagues to join me in recognizing her life and 
public service. She will be sorely missed.

HONORING 
MAYOR 
PATRICK 
FUREY OF THE CITY OF TOR-
RANCE 
HON. MAXINE WATERS 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, July 13, 2022 
Ms. WATERS. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to honor Mayor Patrick Furey for his out-
standing service over the past 40 years to the 
citizens of Torrance, which is partially in the 
43rd Congressional District of California. Last 
night, the City Council of Torrance honored 
Patrick Furey upon his retirement after 8 years 
as Mayor. 
Mr. Furey moved from Philadelphia to Los 
Angeles in 1973 after serving as a policeman 
in his hometown and as an infantry soldier in 
the United States Army. Always active in his 
community, while raising his family, Pat volun-
teered as a Boy Scout leader for more than 10 
years and served as a Little League umpire 
for more than 1,000 games. He was the Presi-
dent of the Northwest Torrance Homeowners 
Association and often served as a spokes-
person for the coalition of Torrance home-
owners associations concerning issues im-
pacting the entire city. Prior to his election to 
the City Council in 2008, Patrick Furey served 
Torrance as a civil service commissioner and 
a member of the Mayor’s Blue Ribbon Com-
mittee on Ethics and Integrity. 
When California was reapportioned after the 
2010 Census and much of Torrance was 
added to my District, then Councilman Furey 
and his wife Terry were the first Torrance resi-
dents to invite me to their home. We devel-
oped a strong friendship and have partnered 
on many projects together. Trained as a law-
yer, Pat retired after a full career as a Prin-
cipal Deputy County Counsel assigned to the 
Children’s Services Division before being seat-
ed as Mayor in 2014. He had also served as 
a Training and Advice Counsel to the Depart-
ment of Children & Family Services in Tor-
rance for more than 3 years. 
Pat Furey has always been concerned 
about young people. In addition to raising their 
own two children and nine grandchildren, Pat 
and Terry were founding members of the Tor-
rance Education Foundation, and he served 
as its President for 4 terms. He was a mem-
ber of every PTA in Torrance and a major 
supporter of public schools. He chaired the 
Torrance Unified School District’s Personnel 
Commission and chaired the Community Plan-
ning and Design Committee. 
Mayor Furey was also a huge advocate for 
Torrance businesses, from grocery stores to 
high tech industries. Always responding to 
community requests, he was a major booster 
of the Torrance Armed Forces Day activities 
and spent much time assisting the city’s non- 
profit organizations. He was a hard-working, 
dedicated and popular mayor, constantly fo-
cused on every aspect of his city’s operations. 
The region’s residents know they were fortu-
nate to have Mr. and Mrs. Furey serving in 
City Hall. Now that Mayor Furey has been 
termed out of office, he will be continuing his 
public service by returning to the Torrance 
Education Foundation. 
I am proud to congratulate Pat Furey upon 
his retirement as Mayor and look forward to 
working with him on whatever his next en-
deavors may be. 
PAMELA GOODWIN—HOMETOWN 
HERO 
HON. BETH VAN DUYNE 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, July 13, 2022 
Ms. VAN DUYNE. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor Pamela Goodwin of Texas 
Congressional District 24 who has gone above 
and beyond to ensure women in North Texas 
and across the country have a better chance 
at breast cancer survival. 
In 2019, Pamela was diagnosed with breast 
cancer. Displaying her courage and positive 
mindset, Pamela took this diagnosis and 
turned it into something truly positive. 
After catching her cancer early through a 3D 
mammogram test, Pamela has made it her 
mission to ensure all women receive an an-
nual, 3D mammogram so they too can catch 
this disease early and live to see another day. 
In an effort to better raise awareness and 
money, Pamela hosted the first annual ‘‘Kiss 
Breast Cancer Goodbye’’ event last year at 
the Country Music Hall of Fame in Nashville, 
Tennessee, headlined by the one and only 
Dolly Parton. 
The inaugural event proved to be incredibly 
successful—raising much needed awareness 
and $167,000 to benefit the Susan G. Komen 
Foundation. I thank Pamela for her inspiring 
fight to beat cancer and her incredible efforts 
to help women across the country.

HONORING DR. JULIETA GARCIA 
HON. VICENTE GONZALEZ 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, July 13, 2022 
Mr. VICENTE GONZALEZ of Texas. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to honor Dr. Julieta Gar-
cia, who recently was awarded the Presi-
dential Medal of Freedom, our Nation’s high-
est civilian honor. Dr. Garcia was the first 
Mexican American woman to serve as a col-
lege president in the United States. 
A native of Brownsville, Texas, Dr. Garcia 
received her Ph.D. in communication and lin-
guistics from The University of Texas at Austin 
and her M.A. and B.A. in speech and English 
from the University of Houston. Dr. Garcia has 
devoted her life’s work to bringing equitable 
education and opportunity to South Texas, 
leading the way for higher education innova-
tion. 
Dr. Garcia served as President of Texas 
Southmost College (TSC) from 1986 to 1991, 
where she successfully led a $13.5 million 
general obligation bond election, the first in 
the history of the college. During her tenure at 
Texas Southmost, she led a successful cam-
paign to raise $1 million for scholarships in the 
poorest community in the United States, help-
ing local students gain access to education. 
She also spearheaded efforts to establish a 
program between Texas Southmost College 
and University of Texas at Brownsville (UTB), 
allowing students in the region to pursue doc-
toral degrees. Garcia became the president of 
this unique partnership from 1991 to 2013. 
Over the course of her leadership, the institu-
tion doubled the number of degree programs 
offered, doubled the number of full-time fac-
ulty, grew enrollment by two and a half times, 
and tripled the number of degrees conferred 
annually. 
Dr. Garcia was named the 2009 Time Mag-
azine Top 10 College President, 2014 Forbes 
Magazine Top 50 World Leader, and holds 
honorary degrees from the University of Notre 
Dame, Brown University, Smith College, and 
Princeton University. She also is the recipient 
of an ACE Lifetime Achievement Award and 
has been inducted in the Texas Women’s Hall 
of Fame. 
Madam Speaker, Dr. Julieta Garcia is an in-
credible leader with an unwavering commit-
ment to accessible education and her legacy 
will be remembered for generations to come. 
She has enriched the lives of many South 
Texas students, and I am proud to recognize 
her latest achievement today.

RECOGNIZING THE 100TH ANNIVER-
SARY 
OF 
THE 
LACKAWANNA 
PUBLIC LIBRARY 
HON. BRIAN HIGGINS 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, July 13, 2022 
Mr. HIGGINS of New York. Madam Speak-
er. I rise today to recognize the 100th anniver-
sary of the Lackawanna Public Library in 
Western New York. Located minutes away 
from Our Lady of Victory Basilica, Lacka-
wanna City Hall, as well as the Buffalo and 
Erie County Botanical Gardens, in many ways, 
the library serves as the heart of the City of 
Lackawanna. Attracting Western New York 
residents of all ages, the library hosts a variety 
of community activities including movie nights, 
book clubs, and computer classes. 
The Lackawanna Library is rich in local and 
national history. Built in 1922, the building was 
one of the last libraries commissioned and 
funded by philanthropist Andrew Carnegie. 
The library stands on what was originally a 
potter’s field, otherwise known as a burial 
place of unknown people, which the City of 
Lackawanna acknowledged in 1992 with a 
monument. 
The first floor of the library houses a local 
history museum containing collections of pho-
tographs, maps, and artifacts from the Beth-
lehem Steel Company which was at one point 
the second largest producer of iron throughout 
the United States. The historical significance 
of the library itself can be seen in the build-
ing’s architecture and beautiful oak woodwork. 
In the library itself, dedicated employees 
and volunteers work tirelessly to ensure that 
those within the local community can gather 
and find enjoyment in the versatility of the li-
brary. For the past 100 years, staff and friends 
of the Lackawanna Library have sustained a 
focus on the enhancement of literacy, commu-
nity, and historic preservation that benefits the 
entire community in Western New York. 
Madam Speaker, I am proud to recognize 
the Lackawanna Public Library here today and 
I’m pleased I was able to join in the centennial 
celebration on Sunday, July 10, 2022. The 
Centennial Celebration Committee planned a 
celebration for the entire community which in-
cluded notable local writers, including author 
of the American Girl Series Connie Porter and 
Washington Post Columnist Margaret Sullivan, 
as well as the incomparable library staff to cel-
ebrate the distinguished legacy of the Lacka-
wanna Public library.

HONORING THE LIFE OF 2ND LT. 
EUGENE P. SHAUVIN 
HON. CATHY McMORRIS RODGERS 
OF WASHINGTON 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, July 13, 2022 
Mrs. RODGERS of Washington. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of U.S. 
Army Air Forces 2nd Lt. Eugene P. Shauvin, 
who was killed in action on September 17, 
1944. 
Lt. Shauvin was a resident of Spokane, 
Washington. He was a brave young man, who 
selflessly sacrificed his life during World War 
II to defend freedom and defeat evil. Lt. 
Shauvin was only 25 years old when his air-
craft was shot down en route to the Nether-
lands. Of the multiple service members aboard 
the plane, Lt. Shauvin was the only body un-
able to be identified and accounted for—until 
now. 
At long last, after 78 years of searching, Lt. 
Shauvin’s remains have been recovered, iden-
tified, and returned home to his family. On 
July 23, 2022, he will finally be laid to rest. 
The repatriation of the lieutenant’s remains 
took many years, but thanks to new tech-
nology and the tireless efforts of so many who 
worked hard to find him, Eugene has finally 
been brought back to American soil where he 
belongs. While the lieutenant had a long jour-
ney home, I pray his loved ones can find 
peace and closure after this decades-long 
search. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me today in recognizing 2nd Lt. Eugene P. 
Shauvin’s extraordinary heroism and honoring 
his ultimate sacrifice, while also celebrating 
our commitment to ensuring no American is 
ever left behind.

OF ARIZONA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, July 13, 2022 
Mr. GALLEGO. Madam Speaker, I rise

Collazos Kizer. Yolanda was a small business-
woman, community leader, mother, friend, and 
mentor to many. 
Yolanda had a passion and skill for busi-
ness and together with her husband, Aaron 
Kizer, founded Casa Unlimited—an airport re-
tail enterprise with stores at Phoenix Sky Har-
bor and airports across the country. Not just 
concerned with her own success, Yolanda 
served as Chairwoman of the Arizona His-
panic Chamber of Commerce where she 
mentored other small business owners, stu-
dents, and Chamber staff. She also spear-
headed programs to bring economic develop-
ment to the West, support rural businesses, 
and support small businesses development 
training. As Alumni of Arizona State University, 
Yolanda and Aaron were founders and sup-
porters of the Los Diablos Alumni Association 
which provides tuition assistance, mentorship,

dents. 
Yolanda believed strongly in the power of 
women, small business, and the Hispanic

Ms. WILSON of Florida. Madam Speaker, I

to honor and welcome Dr. Jose L. Dotres as 
the newly appointed Superintendent of Miami- 
Dade County Public Schools (M–DCPS). 
Dr. Jose Dotres is a product of the Miami-

educational specialist degree in Teaching 
English as a Second Language from the Uni-

from Barry University, and a bachelor’s degree 
in Public Administration from Florida Inter-

In 1988, he began a long career as an edu-

pacity of Teacher, Reading Coach, Principal, 
District Administrator, Regional Administrative 
Director, Region Superintendent, Assistant Su-
perintendent, 
Chief 
Academic 
Officer 
of 
Broward County Public Schools, Chief of Staff,

as the Council of the Great City Schools. Ad-
ditionally, he is the co-author of several edu-

INTRODUCTION OF THE RENT 
RELIEF ACT 
HON. DANNY K. DAVIS 
OF ILLINOIS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, July 13, 2022 
Mr. DANNY K. DAVIS of Illinois. Madam 
Speaker, today I introduce the Rent Relief Act 
to create an innovative tax credit to help mil-
lions of struggling renters. Thomas Jefferson 
once said: ‘‘The care of human life and happi-
ness, and not their destruction, is the first and 
only object of good government.’’ Unfortu-
nately, 213 years later, I still witness thou-
sands of people in Chicago struggling to pay 
rent. I see people pushed into the streets be-
cause they simply could not afford their hous-
ing. During the pandemic we saw clearly that 
the tax code can help provide direct financial 
assistance to struggling Americans to alleviate 
poverty and improve quality of life. The Rent 
Relief Act is an example of good government 
policy that cares for human life. 
It is unacceptable that 36 percent of children 
in Chicago, and 30 percent of children nation-
wide, wonder if today may be the last day they 
have a roof over their heads. It is unthinkable 
that nearly 45 percent of Hispanic and Black 
children experienced housing insecurity in the 
midst of a pandemic. Safe housing is at the 
foundation of social, emotional, and economic 
well-being, and Congress must do more to 
meet the profound need of millions of Ameri-
cans for stable housing. 
This is why I am proud to join with Rep-
resentatives JIMMY GOMEZ, SCOTT
PETERS, 
and JIMMY PANETTA to champion the Rent Re-
lief Act. The bill would create a fully-refund-
able tax credit that would cover a share of the 
difference between 30 percent of one’s ad-
justed gross income and the actual cost of 
rent and utilities, capping the benefit at 100 
percent of Small Area Fair Market Rent. Im-
portantly, the bill targets the families in great-
est need by limiting the credit to those earning 
less than $100,000. If you earn less than 
$25,000, the credit would cover the entire in-
come-to-rent gap, with the credit phasing out 
as one’s income increases. 
Direct grant assistance, affordable housing, 
eviction moratoriums, and the Low-Income 
Housing Tax Credit are essential federal tools 
to increasing housing stability. Unfortunately, 
only 1 in 4 eligible households receives any 
help, and some households spend years on 
waitlists due to inadequate funding. A renter’s 
credit could help every eligible taxpayer afford 
housing and improve their quality of life, work-
ing in concert with other federal programs to 
help end America’s housing crisis. 
By enacting the Rent Relief Act, families will 
not fall into the spiral of missed payment after 
missed payment because it wasn’t their turn 
on a waiting list. They will be able to get rental 
help when they need it to pay the bills when 
they need to. 
As a government, it is our duty to care for 
human life and that begins with making sure 
that Americans enjoy housing stability so they 
can live without the fear of eviction or making 
the horrible choice between a roof over their 
heads or medicine and food for their children.
