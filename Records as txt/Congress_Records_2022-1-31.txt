The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Ms. 
HIRONO). Without objection, it is so or-
dered. 
JANUARY 6 
Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I 
couldn’t help but think today that the 
distinguished Presiding Officer and I 
both had the opportunity to be pros-
ecutors. And I thought today about 
prosecutors—I listened to what former 
President Donald Trump said. I lis-
tened to him with horror and disbelief, 
especially when I saw it on television, 
and he was obviously reading his words 
off a teleprompter and knew exactly 
what he was saying. 
He basically said that if he was re-
elected, he would be inclined to give 
Presidential pardons to the people who 
stormed the U.S. Capitol a year ago, 
January 6—the people who came in 
here as insurrectionists; the people 
who came in here doing enormous dam-
age and injuries; the people who caused 
many to die; the people who set up a 
gallows outside the Capitol with a 
noose on it with Vice President Pence’s 
name on it, saying that if he is not 
willing to ignore the law and suddenly 
give the Presidency to Donald Trump, 
a man who had lost by millions of 
votes, this is what he deserved, the gal-
lows. 
It is the sort of thing that if you saw 
it in a B-rated horror movie, you would 
say this is so unbelievable, but here it 
is real. 
You had people committing terrible 
crimes—destruction of property, inju-
ries to people, trying to kill and even-
tually did kill police officers. I remem-
ber that day, and I am sure the Pre-
siding Officer does, because we were all 
on the floor of the Senate as the Vice 
President was rushed off the dais where 
the Presiding Officer is right now and 
where I opened the U.S. Senate just 
minutes ago. 
And then, before we knew what was 
going on, we suddenly saw several 
other plainclothes police officers come 
in here and a big one in a uniform car-
rying a submachine gun with a vest 
that said ‘‘POLICE.’’ We were told we 
had to leave and go to the safe room 
and were escorted out by armed police

officers. If it weren’t for some of the 
brave operations of these officers, we 
had Members of both parties who could 
have been victims of the mob. 
And just minutes after we were es-
corted 
from 
here, 
this 
place 
was 
stormed by some who thought it was 
the House of Representatives. I mean, 
they just obviously had been inspired 
to come up here and storm the Capitol. 
They wanted the election turned over 
at the request of Donald Trump to give 
it to him even though he had lost. And 
I thought—I never thought I would see 
something like this. 
I remember when I was a young law 
student at Georgetown Law School, I 
would come up here and sit in the Gal-
lery and watch this place, this body, 
and watch both Republicans and Demo-
crats debate everything from civil 
rights to voting rights and routine 
matters. I thought, ‘‘What a place to 
be.’’ 
These 
extraordinary 
Senators 
from both parties from all over the 
country speaking about the laws and 
the Constitution of our country. 
I remember, even after I went back 
to Vermont after I was practicing law 
and became a prosecutor, I thought of 
the days I was here with my parents 
and others just watching this body and 
how thrilled I was when I came here, 
thinking the U.S. Senate can and 
should be the conscience of the Nation. 
And then I looked on television and 
saw a man who was decisively defeated 
for reelection to the Presidency, saying 
to his followers: If I am elected Presi-
dent again, I can pardon all these 
criminals who came in here, these in-
surrectionists—people, actually, many 
whom it is very clear were encouraged 
to come here and storm the Capitol at 
his request. 
We are a nation of laws. We are not 
a nation of individuals; we are a nation 
of laws. And we survive as a nation and 
we excel as a nation if we follow the 
law, if all of us do. On the Senate floor, 
we can debate. Both parties can dis-
agree on things, and we do often. I 
think we all believe in the fact that we 
have laws, and you must follow them. 
When I was a prosecutor, I thought, if 
somebody broke the law, there are con-
sequences for it. I cannot imagine what 
it would have been like as a young 
prosecutor if I heard somebody running 
for high office in my State—in this 
case, a Governor—who said: Go ahead. 
Break every law you can to help me get 
elected because I will pardon you as 
soon as I get in there. I think I would 
be before a grand jury pretty quickly 
talking about that candidate. Yet that 
is what we see. 
How could anybody be so blinded to 
what this Nation is that they will ig-
nore what this Nation is? How can any-
body be so blinded to the laws of this 
country that they can ignore those 
laws? How can anybody be so blinded 
to our Constitution that they can ask 
people to violate the Constitution? 
‘‘Commit crimes in my name, and 
don’t worry, I will take care of you. I 
will make sure you are pardoned.’’ 
This country has to get back to—Re-
publicans and Democrats alike—believ-
ing in the rule of law. Disagree if we 
want, disagree at the ballot box, but 
follow the law and stop giving the im-
pression to the rest of the world that 
we are some kind of a pending dictator-
ship, where the law and the Constitu-
tion are set aside for the whim of who-
ever is elected. 
I will speak more on this at another 
time. I know the distinguished Pre-
siding Officer has spoken out on this 
matter before. I greatly admire what 
she has said, and I will continue to 
speak out. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to 
call the roll. 
Mr. SCHUMER. I ask unanimous con-
sent that the order for the quorum call 
be rescinded.

objection, it is so ordered. 
RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY LEADER 
The majority leader is recognized. 
TRIBUTE TO STEPHEN G. BREYER 
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, 
last Thursday, Associate Justice Ste-
phen Breyer announced that after 27 
years of service, he will retire from the 
Supreme Court at the conclusion of 
this term. 
Shortly after his nomination was 
first announced in 1994, then-Judge 
Breyer mused publicly about what he 
expected his time on the High Court 
would bring. He told reporters it was 
his hope to ‘‘make the average person’s 
ordinary life better.’’ Nearly three dec-
ades later, we can safely say that Jus-
tice Breyer has met that mark and 
then some. 
Throughout American history, only 
115 individuals have sat on the Nation’s 
High Court, and few have served as 
long and as effectively as Justice 
Breyer. From his opinions on voting 
rights, 
environmental 
protections, 
women’s reproductive freedom, and 
protecting 
access 
to 
affordable 
healthcare, Justice Breyer’s impact 
upon our Nation will last for genera-
tions. America is a more perfect Union 
today 
because 
of 
Justice 
Stephen 
Breyer. 
Of course, Justice Breyer’s legacy of 
service extends beyond even his re-
markable time on the Supreme Court. 
For 13 years, he also sat on the U.S. 
Court of Appeals for the First Circuit. 
Before that, he served for 8 years as a 
member of the Army Reserves. And, of 
course, Members of this Chamber can-
not forget that he was once a part of 
the Senate itself, serving as an aide on 
the Judiciary Committee in the seven-
ties, where he worked closely with our 
dear friend, the late Senator Ted Ken-
nedy. At every step of the way, he re-
mained his essential self—decent, bril-
liant, and dedicated to our democracy. 
Now, with this new vacancy on the 
Court, President Biden will have an op-
portunity to make history by nomi-
nating the first ever Black woman to 
serve on the Supreme Court. I am con-
fident that the President will select an 
outstanding individual to fill Justice 
Breyer’s seat, and we intend to move 
quickly on our constitutional duty to 
act on his nominee when announced. I 
can assure all Senators that the Senate 
will have a fair process that moves 
quickly so we can confirm President 
Biden’s nominee to fill Justice Breyer’s 
seat as soon as possible. 
Today, Members of this Chamber say 
thank you to Justice Breyer for his 
lifetime of public service. 
AMERICA COMPETES ACT OF 2022 
Now, Madam President, as our coun-
try continues to recover from the dark-
est days of the COVID–19 pandemic, 
last week, we received a remarkable 
bit of news: The U.S. economy grew 5.7 
percent—5.7 percent in 2021. 
Let me say it again. Last year, the 
U.S. economy grew by 5.7 percent—the 
largest single-year growth rate in 
about 40 years. 
Last year’s economic growth did not 
happen on its own. Faced with a his-
toric crisis, Democrats took unprece-
dented steps in 2021 to give American 
families and businesses the support 
they needed to make ends meet and 
stay healthy. Although we have more 
work to do to lower costs and expand 
opportunity, we are undeniably better 
off today than we were a year ago when 
we first took office as a majority Sen-
ate. 
It is frightening to merely remember 
how bad things were at the start of 
2021. We were entering the very worst 
of the pandemic. The economy had its 
worst year since World War II, and 11 
million people were out of work. More 
than 3,000 Americans were dying each 
day from COVID–19. 
But Democrats responded by passing 
the American Rescue Plan 2 months 
into the President’s term. We later 
passed a historic infrastructure pack-
age that is putting people to work fix-
ing our roads and our bridges and our 
highways. Thanks to the heroism of 
health workers, the leadership of the 
Biden administration, and action taken 
by congressional Democrats, over 200 
million Americans have now been vac-
cinated. 
Because of these steps that Demo-
crats took last year, unemployment 
has plummeted faster than many fore-
casts predicted a year ago, to below 4 
percent. The economy added the larg-
est number of manufacturing jobs in 
three decades. As wages keep climbing, 
layoffs are near record lows. 
Make no mistake, this economy is in 
the midst of a historic turnaround, 
thanks in large part to swift action by 
Democrats in the Congress and in the 
White House, but, of course, the work 
is far from over. We must keep working 
to lower costs for American families. 
We need to help businesses struggling 
with strained supply chains, particu-
larly the chip shortage affecting every-
thing from auto manufacturing to 
household appliances. Workers need 
protections to ensure they share in our 
continued economic recovery.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S397 
January 31, 2022 
That is why Congress must keep 
working on legislation like the United 
States Innovation and Competition 
Act, which the Senate passed last year 
with strong bipartisan support. This 
week, the House will hold a vote to 
pass their counterpart to this bill, the 
America COMPETES Act. I am glad 
the House is taking this important step 
in the right direction. When the Amer-
ica COMPETES Act passes, the House 
and Senate can begin the bicameral 
process of resolving the differences in 
each bill and send a final product to 
the President’s desk. 
With historic investments in science, 
technology, and American manufac-
turing, the policies of USICA represent 
the boldest steps in decades to secure 
America’s economic future. 
By bringing manufacturing back to 
the United States from overseas, it 
would 
strengthen 
domestic 
supply 
chains and help address our country’s 
dangerous semiconductor shortage that 
has driven up prices in everything from 
cars to microwaves. 
All this would not only relieve rising 
costs by making us less reliant on for-
eign manufacturing; it would also ad-
vance our national security. 
This legislation would help fix our 
country’s 
dangerous 
semiconductor 
shortage that has driven prices up in 
everything from cars to microwaves by 
strengthening domestic supply chains 
and by increasing production. It would 
not only relieve rising costs; it would 
also advance our national security. 
For months—months—I have spoken 
with both my Republican and Demo-
cratic colleagues about finding a way 
to get this bill to the President’s desk. 
Now I am glad that the House will 
take action later this week on their 
version of this legislation, and I look 
forward to working through this bill so 
that President Biden can finally sign 
this landmark manufacturing and in-
novation bill into law. 
BUSINESS BEFORE THE SENATE 
Madam President, on other Senate 
business, over the next few weeks there 
are other crucial priorities that the 
Senate must also attend to. As we re-
turn to this work period, discussions 
among Senate Democrats on BBB will 
continue. 
We will also work on nominations. At 
the end of the last work period, I filed 
cloture on 20 nominees to serve in both 
the Biden administration and on our 
Federal courts. Later today, we will 
hold a cloture vote on the first of these 
nominees, Ms. Bridget Brennan, to 
serve as a district judge for the North-
ern District of Ohio. And over the 
course of this week, we will work to 
get these men and women confirmed as 
quickly as possible. 
Among the 20 individuals I filed clo-
ture on, that includes one nominee for 
the U.S. Court of Appeals; several Fed-
eral district judges; several judges to 
serve in Washington, DC, Superior 
Court; the nominee to serve as U.S. 
Ambassador to Germany; and many 
other highly qualified men and women 
to serve in the Department of Defense, 
the Export-Import Bank, and the U.S. 
International 
Development 
Finance 
Corporation. We are going to work 
until we confirm all of these crucial 
nominees, and I look forward to work-
ing in good faith with the other side to 
get them done. 
Finally, in this work period, the Sen-
ate will also work on the vital task of 
passing an omnibus package to fund 
the Federal Government, prevent a 
shutdown, and make sure the Federal 
Government is well-equipped to serve 
the American people. I will sit down 
with a number of Democratic appropri-
ators tomorrow to discuss the state of 
negotiations, and I want to thank all of 
the appropriators for their hard work 
in bringing the funding package to-
gether. We are going to work day and 
night to bring a funding package to-
gether, avoid a shutdown, and make 
sure Congress fulfills this basic duty to 
the American people. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER 
The Republican leader is recognized. 
KENTUCKY 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President, 
Senators spent last week in our home 
States. We got to hear firsthand up-
dates about the real issues facing real 
families that we all represent. I was es-
pecially glad to return to Western Ken-
tucky to keep working on our recovery 
from the catastrophic tornadoes that 
hammered our State in mid-December. 
Kentuckians are tough. They are re-
silient. But many are still reeling from 
the impact of these storms. They have 
lost homes, businesses, even loved 
ones. 
I spent last week meeting with local 
leaders, small business owners, and 
Kentuckians in the hardest hit areas. 
We talked about our work here in 
Washington and the help they can ex-
pect to receive from us. 
Kentuckians in the affected areas 
have been grateful for the quick and ef-
ficient way that FEMA has begun dis-
tributing recovery aid. We know recov-
ery will be a very long process, but my 
office and I will be standing with our 
people every step of the way. 
And the entire State is excited to im-
prove our roads, bridges, railways, and 
broadband thanks to the bipartisan in-
frastructure deal that Congress struck 
last year. 
But like working people across Amer-
ica, Kentuckians also have serious con-
cerns 
about 
significant 
headwinds. 
Kentucky families are feeling the pain 
of the worst inflation in 40 years. Our 
country has been hammered by 7 per-
cent inflation over just the past year. 
Employers are trying hard to keep up. 
Even as they face inflation across all 
their expenses, businesses across our 
region have significantly upped their 
spending on wages and benefits, and 
many workers have gotten raises. But, 
actually, it is only on paper because 
the historic inflation on the Demo-
crats’ watch has more than canceled 
the average increase in wages. Infla-
tion is turning pay raises into pay cuts. 
This is just one of the many significant 
problems we confront. 
BIDEN ADMINISTRATION 
Madam President, after a year of 
record-setting bloodshed in America’s 
streets, violent crime is still forcing 
too many to live in fear. 
The historic humanitarian and secu-
rity crisis that unfolded at our south-
ern border on Democrats’ watch has ac-
tually gotten only worse. 
The Biden administration’s war on 
affordable and reliable American en-
ergy has put consumers in a bind. 
And half a world away, in multiple 
regions, growing storm clouds are 
darkening the international stage with 
major implications for America and for 
our allies. Across the Middle East, 
from proxy terrorist attacks to nuclear 
and missile development, Iran keeps 
reminding us it has no intention of 
playing by the rules. 
In Eastern Europe, Vladimir Putin 
himself is spelling out the reality of 
Russia’s threat to the international 
order, one armored vehicle at a time. 
I 
am 
encouraged 
that 
President 
Biden finally appears inclined to rein-
force Eastern European treaty allies 
with U.S. forces, and those deploy-
ments must take place sooner rather 
than later. And other NATO allies 
should join us in defending our eastern 
flank allies. 
Likewise, American and allied efforts 
to support Ukraine’s ability to defend 
itself must occur not at the speed of 
bureaucracy but at the speed of rel-
evance. 
Unfortunately, 
Washington 
Democrats have spent months focused 
on one distraction after another from 
these pressing challenges. 
Months before Russia began massing 
forces for an invasion of Ukraine, our 
colleagues on the Armed Services Com-
mittee produced a bipartisan Defense 
authorization bill that would reassert 
our commitments to our allies and 
partners in Eastern Europe, as well as 
Asia, and help our own forces stay on 
the cutting edge of competition with 
China and Russia. 
But instead of moving this legisla-
tion forward to prompt passage, the 
Democratic leader left the NDAA in 
limbo until almost the last minute. 
In the meantime, Senate Democrats 
spent months trying to assemble a 
massive reckless taxing-and-spending 
spree, packed with policies that nobody 
was asking for outside of the radical 
left. Our citizens were fighting for 
their economic lives, trying to fight off 
gas prices, grocery prices, car prices, 
housing prices, and here Democrats 
were claiming the way out of inflation 
was to spend trillions on windmills and 
welfare.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S398 
January 31, 2022 
And, of course, the multitrillion-dol-
lar debt explosion wasn’t even the most 
radical thing Democrats have recently 
tried to ram through. 
Earlier this month, the vast majority 
of Senate Democrats tried to break— 
break—this 
Chamber’s 
most 
funda-
mental rule for the sake of appointing 
themselves the entire country’s board 
of elections on steroids. 
Well, I hope our friends across the 
aisle can spend 2022 recommitting 
themselves to the actual problems that 
families are facing on their watch. This 
razor-thin Senate majority owes the 
American people at least that much. 
TRIBUTE TO STEPHEN G. BREYER 
Madam President, on a final matter, 
last week, Justice Stephen Breyer an-
nounced his plans to retire from the 
Supreme Court at the conclusion of 
this term. 
Justice Breyer deserves our country’s 
hearty congratulations. By this sum-
mer, he will have dedicated more than 
four decades of service to the Federal 
judiciary, including 28 years on our 
highest Court. During this time, the 
Justice has won respect and admira-
tion from across the legal profession. 
One does not have to agree with the 
substance of Justice Breyer’s legal phi-
losophy or the conclusions he has 
reached in many cases to appreciate 
the service he has rendered to the 
Court and to our country. 
He is universally regarded as a care-
ful and committed jurist. He is a top- 
shelf legal expert and intellectual 
heavyweight. In fact, Justice Breyer 
has published prolifically even beyond 
his caseload. Over the decades, the Jus-
tice has spent many hundreds of pub-
lished pages transparently laying out 
his 
legal 
philosophy 
and 
thinking 
through scholarly questions in public 
view. 
Most of all, I admire Justice Breyer’s 
staunch defense of the institution of 
the Supreme Court itself in the face of 
increasingly reckless rhetoric from 
loud voices on the political left who 
would like to consider themselves in-
tellectually 
aligned 
with 
Justice 
Breyer. 
The Justice proved that, in fact, they 
are not. He has been a loud and con-
sistent opponent of disastrous ideas 
such as modern Democrats’ partisan 
Court-packing proposals that would de-
stroy public trust and deal a perma-
nent blow to the rule of law. 
So my warm best wishes are with 
Justice Breyer, his wife Joanna, and 
the Breyer family as the Justice con-
cludes his term and his truly remark-
able tenure. 
Naturally, the country’s focus now 
turns to the next chapter for the Court, 
which President Biden and the Senate 
will author together. 
For now, I will simply note a basic 
fact: President Biden was elected on 
the specific promise to govern from the 
middle, steward our governing institu-
tions, and unite a divided country. Un-
derscoring that point, the American 
people handed President Biden a dead- 
even Senate, 50–50. 
I suggest that President Biden bear 
this in mind as he considers whom to 
nominate to our highest Court. The 
American people deserve a nominee 
who has demonstrated reverence for 
the written text of our laws and our 
great Constitution. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Illinois. 
Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, in 
keeping with the remarks of the Re-
publican Senate leader, I would like to 
start with recognition of Supreme 
Court Justice Stephen Breyer’s con-
tribution to America. 
On July 12, 1994, a court of appeals 
judge named Stephen Breyer appeared 
before 
the 
Senate 
Judiciary 
Com-
mittee. It was the first day of his Su-
preme Court confirmation hearing. As 
he began speaking, Judge Breyer laid 
out his view of the law and its role in 
maintaining the fabric of American 
life. 
He said: ‘‘I believe the law must work 
for people.’’ 
He argued that our Nation’s vast web 
of ‘‘Constitution, statues, rules, regula-
tions, practices and procedures . . . has 
a single basic purpose.’’ 
That purpose, he said, ‘‘is to help the 
many different individuals who make 
up America, from so many different 
backgrounds and circumstances, with 
so many different needs and hopes, live 
together productively, harmoniously, 
and in freedom.’’ 
In his nearly three decades on the 
Supreme 
Court, 
Justice 
Stephen 
Breyer has lived by those words. He has 
helped ensure that the law is a force 
for good, a force for unity, and a force 
for freedom and equality. 
So, for me, I have truly mixed feel-
ings as I stand here today and look 
back on the incredible legacy of Jus-
tice Breyer, who announced last week 
that he would retire at the end of this 
term. 
And what a legacy he leaves. 
Born in San Francisco, Stephen 
Breyer attended Stanford University 
and Harvard Law, and just 3 years after 
graduating from Harvard, he returned 
to the school as a professor, a role in 
which he inspired a generation of ju-
rists, public servants. 
He held a few other occupations as 
well. He served our country as a cor-
poral in the U.S. Army and in the 
Army Reserve. He was a clerk for Su-
preme Court Justice Arthur Goldberg, 
a member of the Watergate special 
prosecutor’s office, and chief counsel to 
the 
Senate 
Judiciary 
Committee, 
which I am honored to chair. From 
there, he was appointed to the U.S. 
Court of Appeals for the First Circuit, 
where he served for nearly 14 years be-
fore his confirmation to the U.S. Su-
preme Court. 
And I might add, for the record, his 
vote on confirmation to the Court was 
89 to 7. It was a remarkable showing of 
strength and support for a man whose 
politics were clear, as he served with 
Ted Kennedy on the Senate Judiciary 
Committee as his lead counsel for 
many years. 
Justice Breyer’s record when he came 
to the Supreme Court was nothing 
short of awe-inspiring. From voting 
rights to women’s reproductive free-
dom, from criminal justice to con-
sumer protection, from campaign fi-
nance to immigration, Justice Breyer’s 
voice has been powerful, pragmatic, 
thoughtful, and enduring, whether in 
the majority or in dissent. 
Consider, 
for 
instance, 
Justice 
Breyer’s dissenting opinion in the 1995 
case, United States v. Lopez. In that 
case, the Court’s conservative majority 
overturned the Gun-Free School Zones 
Act, finding that the statute exceeded 
Congress’s power under the commerce 
clause, a clear departure from existing, 
standing precedent. In his dissent, Jus-
tice Breyer melded sound constitu-
tional interpretation with his signa-
ture pragmatism. Citing the facts and 
the law, he methodically explained how 
the widespread problems caused by gun 
violence in and around schools clearly 
affected and threatened commerce. 
He concluded: ‘‘Holding that the par-
ticular statute before us falls within 
the commerce power would not expand 
the scope of the Clause. Rather, it 
would simply apply preexisting law to 
changing economic circumstances. It 
would recognize that, in today’s eco-
nomic world, gun-related violence near 
the classroom makes a significant dif-
ference in our economic as well as our 
social well-being.’’ 
That was one of the many opinions 
that captured Breyer’s vision of the 
law as a force for productivity, for har-
mony, and for the well-being of the 
American people. 
Fast forward 20 years. The case was 
Glossip v. Gross. In that case, they 
challenged a form of lethal injection as 
violating the Eighth Amendment’s ban 
on cruel and unusual punishment. The 
Court’s conservative majority rejected 
the challenge. But once again, Justice 
Stephen Breyer responded with con-
science and clarity. With his keen 
analysis and pragmatic reasoning, he 
explained 
the 
constitutional 
infir-
mities of the death penalty. He wrote: 
‘‘Nearly 40 years ago, this Court upheld 
the death penalty under statutes that, 
in the Court’s view, contained safe-
guards sufficient to ensure that the 
penalty would be applied reliably and 
not arbitrarily. The circumstances and 
the evidence of the death penalty’s ap-
plication have changed radically since 
then. Given those changes, I believe 
it’s now time to reopen the question.’’ 
Let me say, parenthetically, it is in-
teresting for me to note how many Su-
preme Court Justices, late in their 
term, facing retirement or nearing it, 
reflected on the death penalty. Justice 
Blackmun was another. And it says to 
me that these cases that they decided, 
once with an eye towards consistency, 
weighed on their consciences, and they 
came to conclude that the death pen-
alty truly needed to be questioned 
under our constitutional values. 
Justice Breyer, in that case, recog-
nized that in our system of justice,

January 31, 2022 
punishment must not only be firm but 
fair. During his 28 years on the Court, 
Stephen Breyer has been a stalwart de-
fender of Americans’ constitutional 
rights. 
As I mentioned, years before he was 
confirmed to the Supreme Court, Jus-
tice Breyer sat on the Court of Appeals 
for the First Circuit, located in Boston. 
Today, on the banks of Boston Harbor, 
stands a building that reflects his life-
time of service: the John Joseph Moak-
ley United States Courthouse. Let me 
add, I knew Joe Moakley. He was my 
colleague and friend in the House. 
Then-Judge Breyer helped design that 
courthouse, and he still has an office 
there. 
The building features a curved glass 
wall, stretching across tens of thou-
sands of feet, so passersby can peer 
into the courthouse during the day. It 
is designed to provide a clear view into 
the administration of justice. Engraved 
on the wall in the building are the 
names of the workers who had a hand 
in building it. Alongside the names of 
bricklayers and carpenters, etched in 
equal standing, is Stephen Breyer. 
Those two principles reflected in the 
building—transparency and equality— 
have, in many ways, defined Stephen 
Breyer’s legal philosophy and his con-
tribution to America. He understands 
that our system of justice is stronger 
when the American people understand 
how the law works and when the law 
works for them. 
Now, we must carry that tradition 
forward. Soon, President Biden will an-
nounce 
his 
selection 
for 
Justice 
Breyer’s successor to the Supreme 
Court—big shoes to fill. But I have no 
doubt that President Biden will select 
a jurist who parallels Justice Breyer in 
intellect, ability, and dedication to 
public service. 
With his retirement, we have an op-
portunity to confirm another out-
standing Justice, one who will indeed 
champion the freedoms and liberties 
we hold so dear, one who will also re-
main faithful to the rule of law and 
who will approach her work on the 
Court with the same thoughtful dedica-
tion displayed by Justice Breyer. 
We don’t yet know who the nominee 
will be, but here is what we do know: 
No matter the nominee, we will under-
take a process in the Senate Judiciary 
Committee that is both fair and time-
ly. This process will afford Senators an 
opportunity to review the nominee’s 
record and question the nominee thor-
oughly, while at the same time ensur-
ing the nominee is treated respectfully 
and receives a prompt confirmation 
vote. We owe that not just to this 
nominee but to the American people. 
Let me close by turning to Justice 
Breyer’s opening statement before the 
Judiciary Committee—July 12, 1994. 
America was watching when Justice 
Breyer said: ‘‘You are now considering 
my appointment to the Supreme Court 
of the United States. That Court works 
within a grand tradition that has made 
meaningful, in practice, the guarantees 
of fairness and of freedom that the 
Constitution provides.’’ 
He said, ‘‘I promise you, and I prom-
ise the American people, that if I am 
confirmed to be a member of the Su-
preme Court, I will try to be worthy of 
that great tradition.’’ 
There is no doubt in my mind or in 
the mind of any objective analyst, Ste-
phen Breyer has proven himself worthy 
of that great tradition. 
Whoever his successor may be, I am 
confident she will do the same. 
I want to personally thank Justice 
Breyer, as a Member of the Senate but 
as an American citizen first, for his 
thoughtfulness, 
his 
spirit 
of 
collegiality and consensus building, 
and for always working to advance the 
Constitution’s guarantees of fairness 
and freedom. 
ABDUCTION OF MARK FRERICHS 
Madam President, 2 years ago, Mark 
Frerichs, a veteran of the U.S. Navy, 
from Illinois, was abducted by the 
Taliban—2 years. 
At the time, Mark was working as a 
civil engineer. For a decade, he had 
been leading construction projects to 
benefit the people of Afghanistan. But 
on January 31, 2020, Mark was invited 
to a meeting, ostensibly to discuss his 
next project. When he arrived, he was 
kidnapped and taken to a stronghold in 
the mountains of Afghanistan. 
For 2 agonizing years, Mark’s family 
has prayed for his safe return. They 
shouldn’t be forced to wait a minute 
longer. 
Last week, Charlene Cakora, Mark’s 
sister, wrote an op-ed in the Wash-
ington Post, urging the Biden adminis-
tration to help finally bring Mark 
Frerichs home. 
My colleague Senator DUCKWORTH 
and I have made the same appeal to the 
President many times over to push 
every possible lever to secure the safe 
and urgent release of Mark. It seems 
the administration is committed to do 
so, and I thank the President for his re-
cent statement. 
He said in that statement that the 
Taliban 
must 
immediately 
release 
Mark before it can ‘‘expect any consid-
eration of its aspirations for legit-
imacy.’’ 
We all pray that Mark is still alive 
and in good health. So as the adminis-
tration continues to hold talks with 
the Taliban on everything from wom-
en’s rights to combating starvation 
and famine, I hope and pray that 
Mark’s release will remain on the fore-
front of those negotiations. 
I look forward to continuing to work 
with the administration on this case. 
Senator DUCKWORTH and I have worked 
behind the scenes as best we can, over 
and over, year after year, month after 
month, to bring him home. 
Let’s make sure that Mark Frerichs 
doesn’t spend another year in cap-
tivity. Let’s bring him home to Lom-
bard, IL, so he can turn 60 in the loving 
arms and company of family and 
friends. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The bill clerk proceeded to call the 
roll. 
Mr. BROWN. Madam President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Ms. 
DUCKWORTH). Without objection, it is 
so ordered. 
JUDICIAL NOMINATIONS 
Mr. BROWN. Madam President, it is 
an honor to speak today in support of 
three historic, highly qualified nomi-
nees to serve 6 million Ohioans in the 
Northern District of Ohio on the Fed-
eral bench. Each of these nominees 
brings with them not only impressive 
legal credentials but also diverse life 
experiences, empathy, and a deep com-
mitment to justice that will make 
them excellent district judges. It is 
why Senator PORTMAN and I together 
recommended these nominees to Presi-
dent Biden. It is why each of them was 
voted out of the Senate Judiciary Com-
mittee with bipartisan support. I urge 
my colleagues on the floor to support 
them. 
NOMINATION OF BRIDGET MEEHAN BRENNAN 
Madam President, tonight, we will 
vote to advance the nomination of 
Bridget Brennan. 
Bridget Brennan is the current act-
ing U.S. attorney in the Northern Dis-
trict. She has served Ohioans as an as-
sistant U.S. attorney for over a decade. 
She has taken on complex and difficult 
issues. She has focused on cases that 
help make our communities safer and 
more just. 
Ms. Brennan has dedicated her career 
to making the Northern District of 
Ohio a safer place for victims of human 
trafficking, including children. She 
served as the lead prosecutor in the 
largest juvenile sex trafficking case in 
the history of the Northern District—a 
horrific case that included victims as 
young as 12. She achieved the country’s 
first conviction for a sex trafficker’s 
use of heroin to control his victims, 
convincing the court to recognize her-
oin withdrawal as a ‘‘threat of serious 
bodily harm’’ for the purposes of prov-
ing coercion. 
She has been a champion for reli-
gious liberty. She successfully pros-
ecuted 16 defendants in a single case, 
under hate crime statutes, for their 
roles in religiously motivated assaults 
after they viciously attacked members 
of Ohio’s Amish community. She suc-
cessfully prosecuted a man for arson 
and the destruction of religious prop-
erty after he drove hours just to set 
fire to a mosque in northern Ohio. 
Ms. Brennan received glowing rec-
ommendations from those she has 
worked with and from those whom she 
has prosecuted. People who she has 
prosecuted write to her from jail, seek-
ing advice and guidance. She is some-
one whose commitment to justice is 
obvious to all of those who deal with 
her. 
I urge my colleagues to join me in 
supporting Ms. Brennan’s nomination.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S400 
January 31, 2022 
NOMINATION OF CHARLES ESQUE FLEMING 
Madam President, tomorrow, in addi-
tion to confirming Ms. Brennan, the 
Senate will consider the nominations 
of Charles Fleming and Federal Mag-
istrate Judge David Ruiz, both of 
whom are nominated to also serve in 
the Northern District. 
Mr. Fleming is an assistant public 
defender, which is not always the route 
to being a Federal judge, but it is a 
key, key, key part of our judicial sys-
tem. He is an assistant public defender 
in the Northern District, serving as 
trial team leader in the Northern Dis-
trict’s largest public defender branch. 
A career public servant, Mr. Fleming 
has extensive trial experience in Fed-
eral court, having served as a Federal 
public defender for 30 years. If con-
firmed, he would be the only Black 
man currently serving as an active- 
duty Federal district court judge for 
the Northern District. 
Mr. Fleming has received uniformly 
enthusiastic reviews from judges he 
has appeared before and from attorneys 
he has tried cases against. As a lead 
public defender, he takes on what his 
supervisor has described as the ‘‘most 
difficult and challenging cases,’’ as you 
can imagine. In his cases, he has al-
ways displayed exceptional empathy 
not only toward clients but also toward 
the victims of crime. One story illus-
trates his character well. 
He was representing an individual 
charged with committing a violent 
crime. According to the judge, when 
making his arguments for what he be-
lieved was a fair sentence for his client, 
Mr. Fleming turned and faced the vic-
tim and her family. The judge said Mr. 
Fleming didn’t alter his arguments, 
but he wanted to accord the victim and 
her family the dignity of hearing di-
rectly from him, the public defender. 
That is the kind of empathy and re-
spect we need on the bench. I urge my 
colleagues to join me in supporting his 
nomination. 
NOMINATION OF DAVID AUGUSTIN RUIZ 
Madam President, the third judge, 
David Ruiz, has served as a Federal 
magistrate judge in the Northern Dis-
trict for 5 years. Before that, he served 
for 16 years as an assistant U.S. attor-
ney in the Northern District and as a 
private practitioner. 
As an assistant U.S. attorney and in 
private practice, he took on a wide 
spectrum of cases. Those who worked 
with him praised his temperament and 
his intellect and described him as 
‘‘unflappable.’’ However, perhaps Judge 
Ruiz’s 
most 
powerful 
endorsement 
came from the judges who are already 
seated in the Northern District who se-
lected him to serve as one of their mag-
istrate judges. They selected Judge 
Ruiz to oversee groundbreaking, multi-
million-dollar, multidistrict litigation 
involving the manufacturers and dis-
tributors of opioids, which have done 
huge damage to families and commu-
nities across our State. 
He is also poised to make history as 
the first Latino district judge ever to 
sit in the Northern District. If this 
body concurs, as the Judiciary Com-
mittee did, he will become Ohio’s first 
ever Latino Federal judge. He is the 
grandson of immigrants. He is a de-
scendant of migrant farmworkers who 
picked fruit in the fields of Texas and 
Michigan to provide better lives for 
their families. Judge Ruiz’s success 
embodies the American dream of gen-
erations of immigrants. 
Finally, I want to thank publicly, in 
this forum, all of the members of the 
bipartisan 
commission 
who 
rec-
ommended these nominees to Senator 
PORTMAN and me. 
When I first came to the Senate, Sen-
ator Voinovich and I established this 
bipartisan commission process to help 
identify the best candidates for these 
important jobs. I am proud of the work 
that 
we 
have 
done 
with 
Senator 
PORTMAN
to continue that tradition 
through Presidents of both parties. 
The members took considerable time 
out of their busy schedules to identify 
and interview potential candidates. 
They undertook this task to ensure 
that the people living in the Northern 
District had access to justice and a 
bench that looks like the people they 
serve. This is by far the most diverse 
set of U.S. attorneys, U.S. Marshals, 
and U.S. Federal judges we have had 
ever in my State. 
I thank the members of the commis-
sion for their work. I would particu-
larly like to mention my representa-
tives on this commission: Mohamed Al- 
Hamdani, 
Paul 
Demarco, 
Barbara 
Doseck, Dennis Eckart, Kayla Griffin, 
Jacqueline 
Johnson, 
Barbara 
Lum, 
Carole Rendon, Carter Stewart, and 
Margaret Wong. I want to especially 
thank the chair of our commission, 
Joyce Goldstein, who put so much ef-
fort and time into this and who put so 
much energy into ensuring this effort 
was a success. The Northern District of 
Ohio is better off because of their 
work. 
Dr. King wrote: ‘‘[P]rogress never 
rolls in on wheels of inevitability.’’ 
Each of these nominees will serve as 
wheels of progress for our State and for 
our country. I don’t make predictions 
in politics often, but I am certain that 
every Member of this body, Republican 
and Democrat, who votes for these 
three judges will always be glad that 
they did. 
I urge my colleagues to vote yes so 
that they can get to work immediately 
serving the people of my great State. 
JUDICIAL NOMINATIONS 
Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, this 
week, the Senate will consider three 
judicial nominees for the Northern Dis-
trict of Ohio. 
Before I speak on the nominees them-
selves, I would like to commend Sen-
ators BROWN and PORTMAN for working 
across the aisle to develop a bipartisan 
selection process. 
All three of these nominees were rec-
ommended to the White House through 
a judicial commission that Senators 
BROWN and PORTMAN established. 
As Senator PORTMAN noted at our 
hearing on these nominees, the mem-
bers of the bipartisan screening com-
mission committed significant time 
and effort to ensure that they rec-
ommended 
well-qualified 
candidates 
for the bench. 
As a result of that process, we will 
soon vote on three distinguished nomi-
nees. 
The first nominee to the Northern 
District of Ohio is Bridget Brennan. 
For almost 15 years, Ms. Brennan has 
served as a prosecutor, rising through 
the ranks of the U.S. Attorney’s Office 
for the Northern District of Ohio. 
Last year, as a testament to her 
skills and leadership, she was named 
Acting U.S. Attorney for the Northern 
District of Ohio. 
Ms. Brennan has a wide breadth of 
experience, having led her office’s Civil 
Rights and Criminal Divisions. 
She has received a ‘‘Qualified’’ rating 
from the American Bar Association, 
has the strong support of Senators 
BROWN and PORTMAN, and received a bi-
partisan vote in the Judiciary Com-
mittee. 
Ms. Brennan has demonstrated a 
commitment to justice, integrity, and 
the rule of law, all of which will serve 
her well as a district court judge. 
We also will be considering Charles 
Fleming, 
another 
highly 
qualified 
nominee to the U.S. District Court for 
the Northern District of Ohio. 
Mr. Fleming is an experienced liti-
gator who has demonstrated a decades- 
long commitment to ensuring equal 
justice under the law. He has earned 
degrees from Kent State University 
and Case Western Reserve University 
Law School. After graduating, he spent 
a year working in private practice be-
fore dedicating his career to public 
service. 
For more than three decades, Mr. 
Fleming has worked as an Assistant 
Federal Public Defender in the North-
ern District of Ohio. During this time, 
he has tried 17 cases to verdict and has 
gained a truly remarkable breadth of 
courtroom experience. 
As I noted, Mr. Fleming has the 
strong support of Senators BROWN and 
PORTMAN. He received a bipartisan vote 
in the Judiciary Committee. He also 
has received a ‘‘Well Qualified’’ rating 
from the American Bar Association. 
He is clearly committed to maintain-
ing a fair, respectful temperament in 
his courtroom and will decide cases 
based on the law, the facts, and prece-
dent—not on his preferred outcome. He 
will make an excellent addition to the 
District Court. 
Finally, we have David Ruiz. For 
more than 5 years, Judge Ruiz has 
served as a U.S. Magistrate Judge in 
the Northern District of Ohio. In this 
role, he has presided over more than 80 
cases that have gone to verdict or judg-
ment. 
Prior to assuming the bench, Judge 
Ruiz served as an Assistant U.S. Attor-
ney for several years. And before that, 
he spent 10 years as a litigator in pri-
vate practice.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S401 
January 31, 2022 
Judge 
Ruiz 
received 
his 
under-
graduate degree from The Ohio State 
University and his law degree from The 
Ohio State University Moritz College 
of Law. And he received a unanimous 
‘‘Well 
Qualified’’ 
rating 
from 
the 
American Bar Association. 
As I mentioned at the outset, Judge 
Ruiz has the strong, bipartisan support 
of Senators BROWN and PORTMAN. 
He also received bipartisan support 
in 
the 
Judiciary 
Committee—with 
Ranking Member GRASSLEY, Senator 
GRAHAM, and Senator TILLIS joining 
with Democratic members to support 
his nomination. 
Senator PORTMAN stated that Judge 
Ruiz’s ‘‘experience, temperament, and 
high ethical standards have served him 
well as a federal magistrate judge’’ and 
‘‘make him well-qualified to continue 
serving the Northern District of Ohio 
as a federal judge.’’ 
Once confirmed, he will be the first 
person of Hispanic origin to serve as an 
article III Federal judge in Ohio’s his-
tory. 
I urge my colleagues to join me in 
supporting all three of these out-
standing nominees. 
Mr. BROWN. I suggest the absence of 
a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The bill clerk proceeded to call the 
roll. 
Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
SUPREME COURT NOMINATIONS 
Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, last 
week when the Senate was in recess, 
Justice Stephen Breyer announced he 
will soon retire from the U.S. Supreme 
Court. I want to first thank Justice 
Breyer for his service—more than four 
decades, including nearly three decades 
on the Supreme Court itself. 
Although I have disagreed with his 
rulings from time to time, I maintain 
deep respect for Justice Breyer’s com-
mitment to the rule of law and the in-
tegrity of our judicial system. 
Last year, when some of our Demo-
cratic colleagues renewed their threats 
to expand the Supreme Court and pack 
it with partisans, Justice Breyer, to his 
credit, spoke up. He echoed the com-
ments of the late Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
and warned about the potentially dan-
gerous 
consequences 
of 
Democrats’ 
Court-packing threats. As I said, I have 
great respect for Justice Breyer’s de-
fense of the Court and the rule of law 
and protecting the Court as an institu-
tion, especially at a moment when 
sound, principled leadership was need-
ed. 
Once again, I want to thank Justice 
Breyer for his service and wish him a 
well-deserved retirement. 
All eyes are now on the White House 
as we await news of President Biden’s 
nominee to succeed Justice Breyer. Al-
though this is the President’s first op-
portunity to nominate a Supreme 
Court Justice, he is standing at a very 
familiar fork in the road, outlining two 
separate and distinct paths. 
One of those paths involves conven-
tion and virtuous leadership. President 
Biden could select an individual whose 
stellar credentials and experience are 
matched by a deep respect for the rule 
of law and the Constitution. He could 
nominate someone who agrees that Su-
preme Court Justices are meant to act 
as umpires, not as players in the game. 
They are supposed to call balls and 
strikes, not to help their preferred 
team score runs. 
Of course, there is another path, one 
that was cleared and paved by the rad-
ical left. The President could listen to 
the liberal activists who want to select 
somebody who will deliver partisan 
wins regardless of the facts. He could 
nominate someone who would attempt 
to use a position on the Supreme Court 
to rule based on personal policies or 
preferences rather than what the law 
commands a Justice to do. 
As I have said, President Biden has 
found himself looking down these two 
diverging paths a number of times. 
When he first took office, he could have 
worked with Republicans to build on 
Congress’s perfect record of bipartisan 
pandemic relief. With the border crisis, 
he could have endorsed bipartisan ef-
forts to address the virtually uninhib-
ited flow of migrants across our south-
ern border during this last year. 
With a 50–50 Senate, he could have 
embraced the opportunity to work 
across the aisle to make progress on 
our shared priorities, but at every sin-
gle decision point, the President basi-
cally ignored the opportunity to build 
consensus. Even when he supported the 
infrastructure bill, it was only as a last 
resort after his attempt, along with 
that of Speaker PELOSI, to join the in-
frastructure bill to the Build Back Bet-
ter bill, which he knew did not have 
the support that it needed, even among 
Members of his own party. 
The President has repeatedly bowed 
to the radical left’s demands, and the 
results speak for themselves. Last 
spring, the American people were stuck 
with a nearly $2 trillion bill for unnec-
essary partisan spending. Illegal border 
crossings remain at historic highs, 
with more than 2 million apprehen-
sions since January of last year when 
he took office. 
Many of our Democratic colleagues 
abandoned their longstanding support 
for the filibuster or the bipartisan con-
sensus-building requirement of our clo-
ture rules and tried to blow up the 
foundation of the Senate in order to 
clear a path for even more partisan leg-
islation. 
Now we find ourselves 1 year into a 
Democratic-controlled 
government 
with a short list of legislative accom-
plishments. 
Time 
and 
time 
again, 
President 
Biden has abandoned bipartisanship 
and tradition in order to appease the 
progressive base in his political party, 
and the American people are the ones 
who have suffered the consequences. 
Once again, I would hope he would re-
member his inspiring words at his in-
auguration on January 20, just about a 
year ago, where he called for a healing 
of the divisions in our country and 
working together in a shared desire to 
improve the quality of life for Ameri-
cans and to make their place in the 
world one of leadership and peace. 
The left has already begun its cam-
paign to replace Justice Breyer with a 
judicial activist. In fact, the very fact 
that Justice Breyer decided to retire is 
an indication that the radical left is 
successful in browbeating a sitting Su-
preme Court Justice into retiring rath-
er than finishing his term of office. 
But clearly these folks on the left 
don’t want him to be succeeded by an-
other principled jurist who evaluates 
cases based on the law and the facts. 
They want a partisan who will deliver 
sure political wins. Our Nation does 
not need a radical ideologue serving on 
the highest Court in the land. 
We all know that the Supreme Court 
is a third and coequal branch of gov-
ernment. We also know that the role of 
a judge is far different from that of a 
legislator. Legislators are elected in 
order to represent their constituents 
and make public policy proposals that 
hopefully will become law which will 
improve their lot in life and their fu-
ture. 
The Supreme Court—or any judge, 
for that matter—is not supposed to 
start with a desired result and work 
backward from there. The Supreme 
Court is not a substitute for working 
together to pass legislation in the leg-
islative branch with the signoff by the 
executive branch. The Supreme Court— 
or any court—is not a failsafe that can 
be utilized to deliver particular results 
that can’t be secured through the legis-
lative process. 
Judges should not be legislators in 
black robes. They shouldn’t advocate 
for any particular policy outcome or 
promote a specific agenda. Our democ-
racy and the rule of law depends on 
Justices embracing not personal poli-
tics, not personal beliefs, and not a 
preference for a particular result in a 
case. The key to our constitutional Re-
public is a judge that calls balls and 
strikes, who decides each case based on 
the facts and the law. 
It is important because, every time a 
judge acts as an activist and takes 
away an issue that should be decided 
by the political branches, it shrinks 
the capacity of the American people to 
make their own choices at the ballot 
box when they elect members of the 
legislature and executive branch. 
In fact, that is the reason why our 
Constitution gives Justices lifetime 
tenure—so they will be insulated from 
politics, not so they can use that ten-
ure in order to impose their political 
preferences without retribution by the 
voters. 
Conversely, those of us in Congress 
are precisely elected in political elec-
tions for policy purposes, and the fact 
is we either listen to our constituents

and are guided by their desires or they 
hold the power to replace us and retire 
us at the ballot box. That is why our 
Founders gave courts the jurisdiction 
to apply and interpret the law, not to 
make the law up as they go along. 
We need dedicated public servants 
who follow the statutes passed by Con-
gress and signed by the President into 
law, and the Constitution representing 
the fundamental law of the land, and 
we need judges to make decisions based 
on what that law says, not, again, on 
what their preferred outcome may be. 
So as the President approaches these 
two paths, I hope he will ignore the 
clamor on the left and make a choice 
that serves in the best interest of the 
American people and send us a nominee 
who respects the law and the limited 
role of a judge in our political system, 
because a judge is not supposed to sub-
stitute his or her opinion for that of 
the elected representatives of the peo-
ple. 
And surely the Constitution itself is 
the fundamental law of the land. And, 
as Chief Justice Marshall said in 
Marbury v. Madison, the decisions of 
the Court interpreting that Constitu-
tion are the last word. 
But what we need is what Chief Jus-
tice Roberts called humility; that 
judges understand their important but 
limited role under our form of govern-
ment not to supersede the policy judg-
ments of the elected officials just be-
cause they can because they are the 
last word. We need judges who will 
demonstrate that sort of humility, who 
understand that, yes, they have a 
tough and important job to do but that 
it is within certain guardrails and limi-
tations about what that role should be. 
As the President looks down these 
two divergent paths, I hope he will ig-
nore the clamor on the left and make a 
choice that serves the best interest of 
the American people. And he would do 
that by choosing a mainstream nomi-
nee. 
The President promised during his 
campaign to nominate an African- 
American 
woman 
to 
the 
Supreme 
Court, making that a historic first. As 
the President weighs his decision, I 
want to remind him and our Senate 
colleagues that diversity extends far 
beyond just gender and skin color. We 
need a diversity of education, back-
ground, and experience. 
For example, all of the current Jus-
tices on the Court but one were edu-
cated at Ivy League colleges and uni-
versities. In fact, when Justice Barrett 
was confirmed, she became the first 
sitting Justice to attend a law school 
other than Harvard or Yale. It is true 
that the current Justices largely hail 
from coastal metropolitan areas, and 
one-third of the sitting Justices have 
previously served on the DC Circuit 
Court of Appeals. 
So I agree that diversity on the high-
est Court in the land is a valuable 
asset, and I encourage the President to 
consider 
nominees 
that 
can 
bring 
unique 
experiences, 
education, 
and 
viewpoints of all types to the Supreme 
Court. 
Whoever the President chooses will 
be evaluated based on their qualifica-
tions, experience, and ability to sepa-
rate politics from the rule of law. That 
is the job of the Senate Judiciary Com-
mittee, on which I am proud to serve. 
I presume we would treat any nomi-
nee—regardless of ethnicity, race, or 
gender—exactly the same in extending 
to them a respectful and dignified proc-
ess. Certainly, no nominee is going to 
get points, so to speak, toward their 
confirmation vote because they are of a 
particular race, ethnicity, or gender. 
Each nominee will be thoroughly vet-
ted and questioned, just as prior nomi-
nees have been. 
But unlike some of the mudslinging 
that we saw during the confirmation of 
Justice Kavanaugh, I expect this proc-
ess to be fair and dignified. We must be 
careful, thorough, and comprehensive 
because the American people and the 
institution of the Supreme Court de-
serve nothing less. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

BURMA 
Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, when 
freedom and democracy are threatened, 
we have a responsibility in this body of 
the U.S. Senate to speak up and speak 
out. It doesn’t matter if it is a chal-
lenge here at home or if it is happening 
somewhere else around the globe; we 
cannot remain silent. 
For the past year, Burma has been 
descending into chaos, violence, and 
authoritarian military rule. So I have 
come to the floor here tonight, the an-
niversary of the Burmese military’s il-
legal coup overthrowing the nation’s 
democratically elected government, to 
call on all of my colleagues to join me 
in passing S. Res. 35, a resolution con-
demning this desecration of democracy 
in Burma and a year of atrocities that 
have followed, and urging our allies 
around the world to join us in doing so. 
I also urge this body to pass the 
BURMA Act, which will give President 
Biden the tools he needs to apply pres-
sure to try to reverse this coup and 
help restore democracy. 
For those who are not aware of the 
situation in Burma, a year ago, the

S403 
January 31, 2022 
people of Burma took to the streets. 
They engaged in general strikes to 
peacefully protest the military’s over-
throw of their fledgling democracy. 
One woman who was part of the Gen-
eral Strike Committee—one of the 
main groups behind the protests—said 
she was participating because ‘‘I have a 
little girl. She’s one . . . I don’t want 
her to grow up under a dictatorship 
like I did.’’ 
Before taking to the streets, she told 
her husband: ‘‘Take care of our baby 
and move on with life if I get arrested 
or die in this movement.’’ 
And she finished by saying: ‘‘We will 
finish this revolution on our own and 
not hand it over to our children.’’ 
Early last year, the country’s Par-
liament was expected to sign off on the 
recent national elections in which the 
leading civilian party, the National 
League for Democracy, and its head, 
Aung San Suu Kyi, had won more than 
80 percent of the seats that were avail-
able. 
The Burmese military was never 
under civilian control, and it wasn’t 
happy with these overwhelming re-
sults—these results for the National 
League for Democracy. They had been 
deluded into thinking and believing 
that the people of Burma supported 
their military policies, and so they 
would support a strong military role in 
Parliament, which the people of Burma 
did not. 
Thus, the military leaders refused to 
recognize the outcome of the election. 
They tried to have the country’s su-
preme court throw out the results as 
fraudulent. And when that didn’t work, 
they declared a national emergency 
and surrounded Parliament with sol-
diers. 
Aung San Suu Kyi and other civilian 
leaders were arrested, the nation’s in-
frastructure was seized by the mili-
tary, and, almost overnight, Burma’s 
decade-long experiment with democ-
racy, as imperfect as it was, was 
thrown out the window, and the kind of 
brutal military rule that had governed 
the country for roughly half a century 
was reinstated. 
The initial reaction from the new 
military junta seemed restrained. The 
protests were allowed to go on peace-
fully, but only for a little while. The 
restraint didn’t last long. 
The military leaders who had been 
leading a brutal, yearlong genocide 
against the country’s Rohingya Mus-
lim minority turned to violence. They 
turned to violence, as they had done in 
1988 and as they had done in 2007, to 
crush the protests. 
One local filmmaker in Yangon, who 
took it upon himself to document the 
protests, said that at one protest in 
late 
February, 
‘‘about 
100 
people 
marched towards us quickly. I don’t 
know if they were police or they were 
soldiers. Without warning, they started 
shooting at us with sound bombs, 
[with] bullets and [with] gas bombs.’’ 
Since then, the military’s violence 
has escalated. They have fired rocket 
launchers, 
burned 
down 
homes, 
launched airstrikes, cut off food sup-
plies to starve entire communities, and 
shot at unarmed civilians as they fled. 
Just last week, there was a report 
that members of the military went to 
one village looking for two specific in-
dividuals, one of whom was disabled. 
After shooting and killing these two 
individuals, they set fire to the entire 
village. 
According to one organization moni-
toring the situation, nearly 1,500 Bur-
mese citizens have been killed since 
this coup began a year ago; another 
12,000 arrested; with warrants issued— 
often 
death 
warrants 
issued 
in 
absentia—for another 2,000 or so. Those 
are just the numbers that can be 
verified, and who knows what the total 
amount is. 
For the Rohingya people, a Muslim 
population in a largely Buddhist coun-
try, the situation has only grown 
worse. They have been the target of 
military oppression and genocide. Hun-
dreds of thousands have fled across the 
border. But the military has continued 
to crack down even more on the 
Rohingya 
population 
in 
Rakhine 
State—a state I visited a few years ago, 
leading a delegation of Senators and 
House Members, after the horrific 
genocide, when some 700,000 people fled, 
villages were fire-bombed from the air, 
and helicopters carrying soldiers shot 
from the air. On the ground, babies 
were killed in front of their parents, 
wives were killed in front of their hus-
bands, husbands were killed in front of 
their wives, and women were raped. It 
was one of the most horrific genocides 
in hundreds of villages that occurred at 
that moment. 
But the military now, in spite of all 
that happened then, is enacting new 
draconian restrictions on freedom of 
movement of the Rohingya that re-
main in Rakhine State. They have en-
gaged in continuous intimidation ef-
forts. They have warned of the dangers 
of collaborating with rogue groups re-
sisting the military’s authority. 
Colleagues, the Senate cannot stay 
quiet in the denial of freedom and the 
presence of massive human rights vio-
lations in Burma. America cannot stay 
silent in the face of such atrocities. 
The world must not stay silent in the 
face of genocide being carried out 
against any group of human beings. 
We must make it undeniably clear to 
any government around the world that 
when you systematically persecute 
your people; when you deny their 
human rights; when you murder inno-
cent men, women, and children; when 
you burn down their homes and their 
communities; when you starve them of 
food, deny them the opportunity to 
earn a living or even travel to the next 
community to see a doctor, there are 
consequences; that a community of na-
tions will not stand by idly as you 
commit these horrendous acts; and 
that we in the Senate will not sit by 
and fail to give voice about these 
atrocities. 
So for the sake of all the Burmese 
people who have lost their lives in this 
coup, for the sake of all those striving 
to restore democracy, let us pass S. 
Res. 35, and let us do it this week—‘‘A 
resolution condemning the military 
coup that took place on February 1, 
2021, in Burma and the Burmese mili-
tary’s detention of civilian leaders, 
calling for an immediate and uncondi-
tional release of all those detained and 
for those elected to serve in parliament 
to resume their duties without impedi-
ment.’’ 
Let’s pass that resolution, and let’s 
do it this week, the 1-year anniversary 
of the coup. And let us work with our 
allies around the globe to restore free-
dom in Burma and hold the perpetra-
tors of these atrocities accountable for 
the crimes that they have committed. 
CHINA 
Mr. President, this is not only the 
anniversary of the military coup in 
Burma; it is also the week of the start 
of the Winter Olympic Games in China. 
On this Friday, February 4, the torch 
will be lit, signaling the start of the 
2022 Winter Olympic Games, and mil-
lions around the world will gather 
around TVs and smartphones and com-
puters and iPads and every kind of de-
vice to watch the spectacle of the open-
ing ceremonies as they unfold in Bei-
jing. For 2 weeks, the audience will 
cheer as athletes from across the globe 
achieve the near impossible and join in 
the sorrow of defeat and the joy of vic-
tory. 
But while the world’s attention fo-
cuses on the glamour of the Games, a 
thousand miles away in Xinjiang Prov-
ince, millions of Uighurs will continue 
to suffer from acts of genocide; the peo-
ple of Hong Kong will still be denied 
their rights and their freedoms; and 
untold numbers of political prisoners 
will languish behind bars in China, 
many for nothing more than exercising 
the most basic voice they have as 
human beings. 
Colleagues, we cannot allow the glitz 
and glamour of Olympic Gold and glory 
to blind us to the reality of the pain 
and persecution that so many are suf-
fering under the Chinese Communist 
Party’s authoritarian control—people 
like Mahire Yakup, an insurance sales-
woman, a Mandarin tutor, the mother 
of three, who is currently serving a 61⁄2- 
year sentence for ‘‘funding terrorist ac-
tivities.’’ That sounds terrible. What 
has this mother of three done? What 
did she do? She sent money overseas to 
Australia to help her parents buy a 
house. 
Since first being taken into custody 
in March of 2018, Mahire has languished 
in detention. First, she was taken to a 
mass internment camp. Then she was 
moved to a pretrial detention center. 
She was released twice and taken back 
into custody twice before being sen-
tenced in December of 2020 to 61⁄2 years 
behind bars for the crime of helping her 
parents buy a house. But the whole 
world knows her real crime and why 
she is behind bars is she was born in 
the Uighur minority community.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S404 
January 31, 2022 
Mirzat Taher is another member of 
the Uighur community imprisoned by 
the Chinese Government for actions 
that here in the United States people 
would say: Where is the crime? What 
have you done wrong? 
Years ago, he lived in Istanbul, Tur-
key, where he worked as a tour guide. 
In China, especially in Xinjiang Prov-
ince, traveling abroad is a source of 
massive suspicion to Chinese officials. 
After about a year in Turkey, Mirzat 
moved back to Xinjiang Province. He 
met a young Uighur woman visiting 
from Australia. They fell in love. They 
got married and lived in Xinjiang for a 
year before they started hearing rum-
blings of people disappearing and the 
increased oppression of the Uighur 
community by the Chinese Communist 
Party, and they started to make plans 
to leave the country. 
This was in 2017, when China’s crack-
down on Uighurs and other Muslim mi-
norities was just starting to ramp up 
and a program of arbitrary mass deten-
tion was beginning. As an Australian 
citizen, his wife was able to get her 
husband Mirzat a visa, and they booked 
a flight to Melbourne, but 2 days before 
they were scheduled to leave, police 
knocked on the door in the middle of 
the night. Mirzat’s passport was con-
fiscated, and he was interrogated. Once 
they learned he had spent time in Tur-
key, the officers made him accompany 
them—leave his home—to the police 
station. 
He didn’t come home that night or 
the next week or the next month or the 
next year. It would be 2 years before he 
saw his wife again. He was locked up in 
a detention center for 10 months, 
moved to a mass internment camp, 
where he and other detainees were sub-
jected to political indoctrination and 
physical and mental abuse—including, 
at one point his arms were shackled to 
the top of a door for an entire day for 
the crime of speaking some Uighur 
words. 
In May of 2019, Mirzat was suddenly 
released, and he and his wife tried to 
get him to Australia, but twice more, 
the Chinese authorities detained him, 
until his most recent detention on Sep-
tember 26, 2020, for the alleged crime of 
‘‘organizing, leading, or participating 
in 
a 
terrorist 
organization.’’ 
Last 
April, he was sentenced to 25 years in 
prison for charges related to ‘‘ter-
rorism’’ or ‘‘separatism,’’ all because, 
as a young man, he traveled and lived 
in Turkey for a year. 
Go Sherab Gyatso—in fact, sepa-
ratism is often a common, general-pur-
pose charge used by the Communist 
Party against those they think might 
become critical of the policies of the 
Communist Party. 
We take for granted our freedom of 
speech and our ability to be critical of 
each other’s ideas or support those 
ideas or those of our own President, 
but in China, any word or presence in 
which you might do something other 
than just praise the party, you may be 
treated as a criminal and imprisoned 
for a long period of time. 
That charge, separatism, is a charge 
you can throw around, accusing basi-
cally anyone—and in this case, a young 
man working as a tour guide or a Ti-
betan scholar and monk like Go Sherab 
Gyatso, who was sentenced in a closed 
trial last December to 10 years in pris-
on. 
He was originally arrested in October 
of 2020 after traveling to Chengdu in 
southwestern China to act as a trans-
lator for an ill relative. It is the fourth 
time that he had been arrested by Chi-
nese authorities. He is a monk. He is a 
scholar. He is a rights advocate. He has 
been sentenced with the same state se-
curity crime that is so frequently used 
against his fellow Tibetans of ‘‘inciting 
separatism,’’ simply for having the 
courage to speak out about protecting 
and preserving Tibet’s environmental, 
religious, linguistic, and cultural herit-
age. And he faces a decade in prison. 
Separatism—it is the exact same 
charge that Rinchen Kyi was arrested 
on last August. She is former teacher, 
a fellow Tibetan. What was her crime? 
She expressed her displeasure that the 
private middle school where she was 
teaching, which was established to help 
educate those in the community with-
out the means to receive a formal edu-
cation—whether they be poor or or-
phaned children—had suddenly been 
shut down by the Chinese Government. 
No reason was given for the sudden 
shutdown, but it is believed from local 
sources that it was because the pri-
mary language used at the school was 
Tibetan—Tibetan language at a Ti-
betan school—and the school provided 
Tibetan culture-based learning. 
Rinchen Kyi was so disturbed by the 
closure of the school where she taught, 
she lost her appetite, basically stopped 
eating for 2 weeks. Her health deterio-
rated. She grew weaker. But before her 
family could get her help, the Chinese 
police knocked on her door, arresting 
her on charges of ‘‘inciting sepa-
ratism.’’ 
Rinchen Kyi was hospitalized for 2 
days in another city hundreds of miles 
away from home. She was transferred 
to another undisclosed location and de-
tained. Five months after she was ar-
rested, her status and whereabouts are 
unknown. Her crime was trying to help 
educate the poorest children in her 
community, in their own language and 
discussing their culture. 
The challenges are not just hap-
pening in Tibet. The same kinds of ef-
forts to silence voices and information 
that the Chinese Government doesn’t 
want out in the world is happening 
right now in Hong Kong. 
Earlier this month, Chow Hang-tung, 
a pro-democracy activist, was sen-
tenced to 15 months in prison for help-
ing to organize a vigil commemorating 
the victims of the Tiananmen Square 
massacre. For 30 years, this vigil has 
been held in Hong Kong on the anniver-
sary of the bloody military crackdown. 
As the former vice-chairwoman of 
the Hong Kong Alliance, which held 
these vigils, she had helped organize 
them for many years, but in 2020, the 
government 
banned 
them, 
citing 
COVID–19 restrictions. In spite of that, 
her organization continued to plan for 
holding these vigils. They submitted 
the paperwork. They notified the gov-
ernment. They alerted the police of 
their intentions to hold the event, just 
as they had done year after year after 
year. Then the paperwork was rejected, 
so they formally appealed the decision, 
and their appeal failed. 
So Chow took to social media, calling 
on 
her 
fellow 
Hongkongers, 
who 
wouldn’t be able to hold this gathering, 
to simply do this: Light a candle in re-
membrance of the anniversary. She 
didn’t suggest they come to any spe-
cific place, didn’t suggest they rally in 
person; just, in your home or wherever 
you are, light a candle in remem-
brance. 
She also wrote an article in the paper 
titled ‘‘Candlelight carries the weight 
of conscience and the Hong Kong peo-
ple persevere in telling the truth.’’ Her 
article was used against her as evi-
dence of ‘‘incitement to knowingly 
take part in an unauthorized assem-
bly,’’ even though she decided not to 
call for an assembly and just to ask 
someone, wherever they are, to light a 
candle in remembrance. She didn’t ask 
anyone to assemble. She didn’t ask 
anyone to gather. She didn’t define a 
particular place. 
The Tiananmen Square massacre by 
the Chinese Government is perhaps the 
most censored issue in mainland China. 
Since China has broken their agree-
ment with Great Britain over Hong 
Kong, their 50-year agreement, and 
wiped out the political rights of the 
people of Hong Kong, talking about 
Tiananmen in Hong Kong is cause for 
arrest—even the suggestion of simply 
lighting a candle. 
The Chinese Government tightens its 
grip on Hong Kong. It wants to erase 
all information or history related to it, 
just as they have done on the main-
land—that is, in regard to Tiananmen 
Square—just as they want to suppress 
the voices of people in Tibet, just as 
they want to wipe out the Xinjiang 
Muslim community. They want to 
make sure that any form of potential 
resistance to the Beijing Government 
and their version of the world is si-
lenced and, as we have seen far too 
many times over and over again, these 
folks who speak up against them in 
any way. 
This is Li Yuhan. She is 65. She was 
a human rights lawyer known in Chi-
na’s human rights community as ‘‘big 
sister.’’ She was held in custody for 4 
years before getting a trial. She was 
charged with that obscure crime of 
‘‘picking quarrels and provoking trou-
ble’’—another catch-all phrase used to 
lock up anybody the Chinese Govern-
ment sees as criticizing anything they 
do. 
Everyone in China has to live in im-
mediate fear of being arrested should 
they voice their inner opinions on 
something going wrong in the country,

something they want changed, some-
thing they want improved, something 
that disagrees with the official line of 
the Communist Party. 
She is in poor health, as indicated by 
the fact that when she was arrested, 
they had an ambulance outside. Actu-
ally, the ambulance was outside where 
the trial was held. She suffers from 
heart disease, hypertension, and hyper-
thyroidism, and her long time behind 
bars has made things worse. Staff at 
the detention center where she had 
been held reportedly instructed other 
inmates to urinate on her food, deny 
her hot water for showers, deny med-
ical treatment, and threaten to beat 
her to death—because she was a human 
rights advocate. 
In March of 2018, almost 4 years ago, 
Li went on a hunger strike to protest 
her mistreatment, which led detention 
center officials to force-feed her. 
Like many others, Li Yuhan had the 
courage to stand up for what is right, 
and she is mercilessly persecuted for 
doing so. 
These various individuals and the 
way that they are treated are the kinds 
of abuses that will be going on at the 
same time as the Winter Olympic 
Games are held in China. Figure skat-
ers fly across the ice, and while they do 
so, Li Yuhan will continue to suffer in 
custody for standing up for human 
rights. Bobsledders will careen down 
the track at lightning-fast speeds; 
Chow Hang-tung will continue to be 
punished for trying to ensure his cul-
tural history is remembered. As skiers 
race down the slalom slopes, Go Sherab 
Gyatso and Rinchen Kyi will still be 
locked up for sharing and defending 
their culture. 
As athlete after athlete climbs the 
podium to have beautiful bronze, sil-
ver, and gold medals around their 
necks, Mahire Yakup and Mirzat Taher 
will go on languishing in prison cells 
for the crime of being born in the 
Uighur community. 
That is the backdrop of this year’s 
Beijing Olympic Games—human rights 
abuses, genocide, the destruction of 
freedom and democracy. And we cannot 
allow that to be ignored or over-
shadowed. We cannot allow for that to 
be forgotten in the glitz and glamour of 
Olympic Gold. We cannot let these 
names and these faces and countless, 
countless others who have faced the 
same be lost in the shadows of the 
flames of the Olympic torch. 
The world must join together to say 
to the International Olympic Com-
mittee that never again can the per-
petrators of human rights abuses be al-
lowed to host a treasured event like 
the Olympic Games. Never again can 
the athletes of the world ask to be es-
sentially conspirators in the glitz and 
glamour of covering up genocide. 
And, for all of us, we need to remind 
the world throughout these games of 
what is going on in China. Do not let 
the Chinese Government succeed in 
having the world forget about their 
massive human rights violations—their 
genocide, their torture, their elimi-
nation, their imprisonment, their com-
plete crushing of the rights of people of 
Tibet and Hong Kong, the complete de-
struction of the right to speech and the 
right to religion within their country, 
the complete obliteration of the human 
spirit. We cannot allow all that to be 
forgotten during these Olympic Games.

CHINESE INFLUENCE IN LATIN 
AMERICA AND THE CARIBBEAN 
Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, before 
the holidays, the U.S.-China Economic 
and 
Security 
Review 
Commission, 
USCC, released its 2021 Report to Con-
gress. As is customary, the report re-
flects a bipartisan consensus, with 
unanimous support from the 11-mem-
ber commission. It includes 32 rec-
ommendations to the Congress, each of 
which is worth serious consideration, 
especially in light of the announce-
ment 
that 
Chinese 
President 
Xi 
Jinping will rule for at least another 5 
years. 
This is not the first time that I have 
spoken about China and the impor-
tance of increasing our Nation’s com-
petitiveness. I think we all recognize 
that it is an issue that impacts, di-
rectly or indirectly, the lives of every 
American. Today, I want to call atten-
tion to China’s expansionist foreign 
policy, particularly one section of the 
USCC’s report that discusses Chinese 
investments in Latin America and the 
Caribbean. 
Chinese foreign policy has become in-
creasingly bold, with goals that are 
both economic and political. China’s 
economic goals are twofold: increasing 
access to raw materials while devel-
oping new markets for Chinese prod-
ucts. China has supported growth in 
parts of Latin America by financing 
mining, transportation, electric power 
generation, large scale agriculture, and 
other infrastructure projects. 
However, there is a dark side to this 
increased investment and trade. Coun-
tries’ reliance on commodity exports 
and China’s control over supply chains 
strengthen China’s influence in Latin 
American and Caribbean economies. 
With so much of these countries’ 
economies 
dependent 
on 
continued 
trade and positive diplomatic relations 
with China, it is no wonder that we see 
some 
governments 
bypassing 
regu-
latory standards in order to obtain fur-
ther investment opportunities. This in-
creased 
dependence 
can 
undermine 
democratic institutions, weaken envi-
ronmental and social safeguards, and 
encourage corruption and violations of 
human rights. The Chinese Communist 
Party is promoting its own political 
agenda by supporting authoritarian re-
gimes, promoting pro-China media, and 
strong-arming governments into iso-
lating Taiwan. 
The USCC makes five recommenda-
tions to counter these trends: first, re-
spond to Chinese economic, diplomatic, 
and security initiatives by expanding 
U.S. funding mechanisms for infra-
structure projects, the distribution of 
COVID–19 vaccines, and educational ex-
changes; second, increase support for 
governments in Latin America and the 
Caribbean to create foreign investment 
review processes and require the De-
partment of State to report to Con-
gress on progress; third, require the Di-
rector of National Intelligence, Depart-
ment of State, and Department of De-
fense to submit an unclassified report 
detailing the implications of Chinese 
investment in port infrastructure, Chi-
nese military presence at such ports, 
and the potential for leveraging such 
ports for Chinese military purposes in 
the future; fourth, require that all ap-
plications for U.S. foreign assistance 
include a disclosure of debt owed to 
Chinese entities; and finally, create a 
partnership 
between 
coastal 
Latin 
American countries and U.S. Govern-
ment authorities identified in the Mar-
itime Security and Fisheries Enforce-
ment Act to increase maritime domain 
awareness and combat illegal Chinese 
fishing. 
I urge the administration to consult 
with Congress on a path forward to im-
plement each of these recommenda-
tions. 
The Senate’s fiscal year 2022 State, 
Foreign Operations, and Related Pro-
grams 
Appropriations 
bill 
includes 
$653.8 million for assistance for the 
countries of Central America, includ-
ing $100 million for localized develop-
ment in the Northern Triangle. Addi-
tional funds are included for economic 
and security assistance for the Carib-
bean countries. We must support pro-
grams in these countries that prioritize 
the well-being of their citizens, protect 
their national sovereignty, and encour-
age fair trade and investment by sup-
porting community policing, maritime 
security, energy independence, elemen-
tary and secondary education, anti- 
gang programs, employment opportuni-
ties, programs to improve government 
transparency and accountability, and 
by strengthening civil society. These 
are long-term investments, but they 
will provide the most effective alter-
natives to Chinese influence.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S406 
January 31, 2022 
of South Sudan, despite independence 
10 years ago that held so much promise 
and hope for that country. That inde-
pendence came as a result of the Com-
prehensive Peace Agreement, which 
took years of negotiations facilitated 
by the United States, Norway, and the 
United Kingdom, and it provided a 
roadmap for political stability, eco-
nomic development, respect for human 
rights, and justice. 
Since then, two former warlords, 
President Kiir and Vice President 
Machar, who were never elected, have 
dominated the political landscape in 
South Sudan. It is they, throughout 
these critically important formative 
years, who have had the executive 
power and the responsibility to trans-
form the aspirations of independence 
into tangible improvements in the 
lives of their people. Ten years later, it 
is fair to ask a simple question: What 
have they done? 
I would answer that question with 
these questions: 
After ten years, is South Sudan a country 
at peace where the rights of the people are 
respected and their basic needs, such as safe 
water, sanitation, food, shelter, and health 
care are being met? 
Has South Sudan’s vast oil wealth been in-
vested wisely in public infrastructure such 
as schools, hospitals, public transportation, 
roads, and bridges after decades of civil war? 
Is the country’s agricultural economy ex-
panding and reaching new markets? 
Are children in school and are teachers re-
ceiving a decent salary? 
Are South Sudan’s youth, who make up a 
majority of the population, able to find jobs? 
Do the security forces have the training, 
equipment, food, and barracks they need to 
maintain the peace, and are soldiers and offi-
cers receiving adequate pay? 
Are government ministries led and staffed 
by trained and honest professionals? 
Is the Parliament defending the people’s 
interests? 
Is the judiciary independent, and the 
courts accessible and trusted by the people? 
Have those who committed crimes against 
humanity and other gross violations of 
human rights been prosecuted and punished? 
Have the many thousands of South Suda-
nese refugees and internally displaced been 
able to return home to rebuild their lives? 
Is civic space being protected so civil soci-
ety activists and independent journalists can 
function without fear of harassment or 
threats? 
Has the necessary work been done to cre-
ate the conditions for transparent, free, and 
fair elections in which candidates from all 
political parties can participate? 
Has sustained progress been made in any of 
these areas? 
I think the answers are obvious, and 
the people of South Sudan know the 
answers. Despite billions of dollars in 
international aid and billions of dollars 
in oil revenues, the government of 
South Sudan has failed every test. 
Today, South Sudan ranks as among 
the world’s most corrupt country and, 
despite its oil wealth, one of the 
hungriest country in the world. 
We should remember that the Repub-
lic of South Sudan would not exist 
were it not for the sacrifice of millions 
of South Sudanese who gave their lives 
in the fight for independence. But it is 
also a fact that had it not been for the 
support of the United States, South 
Sudan would not be a Republic today. 
I have been a U.S. Senator for 47 
years, so I remember when South 
Sudan existed only in people’s dreams. 
I remember when John Garang would 
visit the U.S. Congress seeking sup-
port. He was an inspiring leader, and 
we supported him. I supported him. 
And we welcomed South Sudan’s hard- 
fought independence. 
But since John Garang’s tragic death 
in 2005, we have seen how greed and 
personal ambition can thwart the aspi-
rations of an entire population. 
The January 21 response of the office 
of the President of the Republic of 
South Sudan to my statement of Janu-
ary 6 was as revealing as it was pre-
dictable. 
The office of the President accuses 
me of calling for ‘‘regime change 
through uprising and violence.’’ Any-
one who read my statement, as the au-
thor of that accusation surely did, 
knows it to be absurd on its face. There 
is not a single word in my statement 
that remotely suggests what the office 
of the President accuses me of. Their 
resort to fabrication and intimidation 
is the all-too-common tactic of govern-
ments to deflect attention from their 
own failures. We have seen it even in 
our own country. 
The people of South Sudan have ex-
perienced far too much war, far too 
much violence, far too much displace-
ment, far too much insecurity, and far 
too much hunger and misery. The last 
thing they need or want is more vio-
lence, and nothing I have said would 
suggest otherwise. 
There are countless examples. Just a 
few days ago, on January 23, 5 kilo-
meters from Bor, the capital of Jonglei 
State, armed militia reportedly slaugh-
tered 35 and injured 17 civilians, includ-
ing women and children. Property was 
looted, and huts were burned down. The 
people of South Sudan know too well 
that these violent acts are orches-
trated or condoned by the country’s 
leaders. In a letter dated November 25, 
2020, addressed to the President of the 
U.N. Security Council from the Panel 
of Experts on South Sudan, they re-
ported the following: 
Political and security disputes within 
President Kiir’s coalition have contributed 
to conflicts that have killed and displaced ci-
vilians in Jonglei and the Greater Pibor Ad-
ministrative Area. Rival factions within the 
Government supplied weapons to various 
ethnic 
militias 
from 
the 
Government’s 
stockpile. Between May and August, eight 
humanitarian staff were killed, humani-
tarian facilities were looted and destroyed, 
and thousands of civilians were displaced at 
a time of widespread flooding in Jonglei and 
the Greater Pibor Administrative Area. 
The killings on January 23 were part 
of the same pattern, yet those who 
bear responsibility for these attacks 
accuse advocates for peaceful change of 
promoting violence. 
Rather than falsely accuse me and 
South Sudanese civil society organiza-
tions 
that 
have 
repeatedly 
dem-
onstrated their commitment to non-vi-
olence, the government should put a 
stop to these attacks and ask itself the 
questions I have posed. 
It should also reflect on the fact that 
U.S. S. Res. 380 passed unanimously, 
with the support of 100 U.S. Senators, 
Democrats and Republicans, less than 2 
months ago. I remind the office of the 
President what we said: 
Whereas despite years of fighting, wide-
spread suffering of South Sudanese civilians, 
punitive actions by the international com-
munity, and 2 peace agreements, the leaders 
of South Sudan have failed to build sustain-
able peace, and critical provisions of the Re-
vitalized Agreement on the Resolution of the 
Conflict 
[R-ARCSS] 
. 
. 
. 
remain 
unimplemented; 
Whereas the leaders of South Sudan have 
consistently failed to uphold their respon-
sibilities to create the conditions for peace 
and prosperity, have prioritized self-preser-
vation and corruption over the needs of the 
people they represent, have acted in bad 
faith in the implementation of cease fire and 
peace agreements, and have betrayed the 
cause of freedom, resulting in the loss of mil-
lions of lives; and 
Whereas South Sudan has not held an elec-
tion since its independence and the current 
leaders of South Sudan were appointed or in-
stalled through transitional arrangements 
based on peace agreements. 
That Resolution also urged the U.S. 
Secretary of the Treasury: 
(A) to prioritize investigations into illicit 
financial flows fueling violence in South 
Sudan; 
(B) to work with the Secretary of State to 
update, on a regular basis, the list of individ-
uals and entities designated under the South 
Sudan sanctions program, including individ-
uals at the highest levels of leadership in 
South Sudan and from within the National 
Security Service; and 
(C) to coordinate, in cooperation with the 
Secretary of State, with the United Kingdom 
and the European Union on South Sudan-re-
lated sanctions designations and enforce-
ment. 
So rather than make up falsehoods 
about those asking such questions, in-
cluding me, the People’s Coalition for 
Civil Action, and other South Sudanese 
activists and organizations that want 
nothing more than for the promise of 
the R-ARCSS to be realized so the peo-
ple of South Sudan can enjoy the secu-
rity and prosperity they are entitled 
to, I urge President Kiir and Vice 
President Machar to put their country 
first. 
Rather than falsely accusing others 
of violence or resorting to provocations 
to create a pretext for persecuting and 
silencing them, they should listen to 
them. They should listen to the voices 
of the people, expressed in the National 
Dialogue, that South Sudan needs a 
new beginning. 
Rather than claim to have taken sig-
nificant steps to put South Sudan’s 
failing economy on a solid footing, 
which fools no one, they should open 
up the government’s books so people 
can see the receipts and expenditures. 
Rather than hide behind the R- 
ARCSS to preserve the status quo, they 
should implement it in letter and spir-
it, including by unifying rival security

forces, by promulgating a new con-
stitution, and by opening up the polit-
ical space in the country. 
Rather than make excuses to delay 
elections as they have repeatedly done 
before, they should set a date, in ac-
cordance with the R-ARCSS, for na-
tional and Parliamentary elections, 
and they should support a roadmap for 
creating the necessary conditions for 
the 
refugees 
to 
return 
and 
for 
multiparty democratic elections to 
succeed with the support of the army. 
And without delay, they should declare 
their unconditional commitment not 
to contest the next election and to re-
linquish power as soon as South Su-
dan’s newly elected leaders take office. 
The sad reality is that while the 
South Sudanese people won their inde-
pendence from Sudan, they remain cap-
tives of the same ruthless and corrupt 
warlords who created so much ethnic 
conflict, bloodshed, and misery during 
the civil war and who have not been 
held accountable. 
They simply reinvented themselves 
as political leaders, with a stamp of le-
gitimacy from the international com-
munity, while continuing to act like 
the warlords they are and always were. 
They have shown no interest in im-
plementing the R-ARCSS or any other 
peace agreement. 
They have shown no interest in the 
welfare of their people. 
They have shown no interest in any-
thing except holding onto power, avoid-
ing justice, and enriching themselves. 
It is time to listen to the people of 
South Sudan and for the United States 
to reassess its policy toward South 
Sudan. The White House and the State 
Department need to recognize that the 
status quo in South Sudan has been a 
dead end for years and consult with 
Congress on a new way forward. As a 
first step, the U.S. should use the au-
thorities that already exist, including 
the Global Magnitsky Act, to sanction 
key officials in South Sudan’s National 
Security Service, which has long func-
tioned as a criminal enterprise that en-
gages in extrajudicial killings, arbi-
trary detention, torture, and other hei-
nous crimes. 
Real peace requires justice, and it re-
quires respect for fundamental rights 
regardless of ethnicity, race, or reli-
gion. It requires free and fair elections 
and equitable economic development. 
These should be at the heart of our pol-
icy.

*As defined in Section 47(6) of the Arms 
Export Control Act. 
POLICY JUSTIFICATION 
Egypt—C–130J–30 Super Hercules Aircraft 
The Government ofEgypt has requested to 
purchase twelve (12) C–130J Super Hercules 
aircraft with four (4) each Rolls Royce AE– 
2100D Turboprop Engines (installed); twelve 
(12) Rolls Royce AE–2100D Turboprop En-
gines (spares); thirty (30) Embedded GPS/INS 
(EGI) with GPS Security Devices (including 
6 spares); and seven (7) Multifunctional In-
formation Distribution System—Low Vol-
ume Terminal Block Upgrade Two (MIDS– 
LVT BU2) (including 3 spares). Also included 
are AN/APX–119 Identification Friend or Foe 
(IFF) 
Transponders; 
AN/AAR–47 
Missile 
Warning Systems (MWS); AN/ALE–47 Coun-
termeasures Dispensing System (CMDS); AN/ 
ALR–56M Radar Warning Receiver (RWR); 
AN/AAQ–22 (STAR SAFIRE 380); secure com-
munications, cryptographic equipment, and 
GPS-aided precision navigation equipment; 
publications and technical documentation; 
software and mission critical resources; air-
craft support and equipment; unclassified re-
turn and repair; integration and testing; per-
sonnel training and training equipment; U.S. 
Government and contractor engineering, 
technical, and logistics support services; and 
other related elements of logistical and pro-
gram support. The estimated total program 
cost is $2.2 billion. 
This proposed sale will support the foreign 
policy and national security of the United 
States by helping to improve the security of 
a Major Non-NATO Ally that continues to be 
an important strategic partner in the Middle 
East. 
The proposed sale will improve Egypt’s ca-
pability to meet current and future threats 
by providing airlift support for its forces by 
moving supplies, equipment, and people, thus 
strengthening its capacity in the security 
and humanitarian arena. This airlift capa-
bility would assist with border security, the 
interdiction of known terrorist elements, 
rapid reaction to internal security threats, 
and humanitarian aid. Egypt also intends to 
utilize these aircraft for maritime patrol 
missions and search and rescue missions in 
the region. Egypt, which already operates a 
mix of legacy C–130s, will have no difficulty 
absorbing these aircraft and services into its 
armed forces. 
The proposed sale of this equipment and 
support will not alter the basic military bal-
ance in the region. 
The principal contractor will be Lockheed 
Martin Aeronautics Company in Marietta, 
GA. There are no known offsets proposed in 
conjunction with this potential sale. 
Implementation of this proposed sale will 
require the assignment of two (2) contracted 
Field Service Representatives (FSR) and one 
(1) Logistic Service Representative (LSR) for 
a period of three (3) years. The FSRs and 
LSR will have expertise in airframe, avi-
onics/electrical, propulsion systems, ground 
maintenance systems, and logistics support. 
There will be no adverse impact on U.S. de-
fense readiness as a result of this proposed 
sale.

capable of operating from rough, dirt strips 
and is the prime transport for air-dropping 
troops and equipment into hostile areas. The 
C–130J improvements over the C130E include 
improved maximum speed, climb time, cruis-
ing altitude, and range. The C–130J has 55 
feet of cargo compartment length, an addi-
tional 15 feet over the original ‘‘short’’ air-
craft. 
2. The Rolls Royce AE1200D turboprop en-
gine is a two-stage, air cooled, vatable speed 
gas generator turbine, and turbo-prop en-
gine. Each engine contains a General Elec-
trics (GE) Dowty R391 composite propeller 
installed for ground/flight operations. The 
engine is capable of inflight (engine core) 
wind milling and air starts up to 25,000 feet 
and airspeeds between 0.43 Mach and 0.64 
Mach. 
3. The Embedded Global Positioning Sys-
tem (GPS) Inertial Navigational System 
(INS) (GPS/INS) (EGI) with GPS Security 
Devices is a highly accurate inertial naviga-
tion system has embedded GPS for blended 
INS/GPS, free-inertial, and GPS-only solu-
tions. Classified elements include Selective 
Availability Anti-Spoofing Module (SAASM) 
for decryption of precision GPS signals. 
4. The Multifunctional Information Dis-
tribution System—Low Volume Terminal 
Block Upgrade Two (MIDS–LVT BU2) is an 
advanced command, control, communica-
tions, computing and intelligence (C4I) sys-
tem incorporating high-capacity, jam-resist-
ant, digital communication links for ex-
change of near real-time tactical informa-
tion, including both data and voice, among 
air, ground, and sea elements. 
5. The AN/APX–119 Identification Friend or 
Foe (IFF) is a system that responds to inter-
rogating signals to assist in identification, 
location, and terrain avoidance. 
6. The AN/AAR–47 Missile Approach Warn-
ing System is an aircraft passive MWS de-
signed for detection of incoming surface-to- 
air and air-to-air missiles on transport and 
helicopter aircraft. The system detects, iden-
tifies, and displays potential threats. The 
AN/AAR–47 warns of missile approach by de-
tecting radiation associated with the rocket 
motor and automatically initiates flare ejec-
tion. 
7. The AN/ALE–47 Countermeasure Dis-
pensing System (CMDS) is an integrated, 
threat-adaptive, software-programmable dis-
pensing system capable of dispensing chaff, 
flares, 
and 
active 
radio 
frequency 
expendables. The threats countered by the 
CMDS include radar-directed anti-aircraft 
artillery, radar command-guided missiles, 
radar homing guided missiles, and infrared 
guided missiles. The system is internally 
mounted and may be operated as a stand- 
alone system or may be integrated with 
other on-board EW and avionics systems. 
The AN/ALE–47 uses threat data received 
over the aircraft interfaces to assess the 
threat situation and to determine a re-
sponse. Expendable routines tailored to the 
immediate aircraft and threat environment 
may be dispensed using one of four oper-
ational modes. 
8. The AN/ALR–56 Radar Warning Receiver 
(RWR) continuously detects and intercepts 
RF signals in certain frequency ranges and 
analyzes and separates threat signals from 
non-threat signals. It contributes to full-di-
mensional protection by providing individual 
aircraft probability of survival through im-
proved aircrew situational awareness of the 
radar 
guided 
threat 
environment. 
The 
ALR56M is designed to provide improved per-
formance in a dense signal environment and 
improved detection of modem threats sig-
nals.

gyro-stabilized, multi-spectral Electro-Opti-
cal/Infrared (EO/IR) system configured to op-
erate simultaneously in multiple bands in-
cluding the visible, near-IR and mid-wave IR 
bands. The system consists of an externally- 
mounted turret sensor unit and internally- 
mounted central electronics unit and system 
control unit. Images will be displayed in the 
aircraft real-time and recorded for subse-
quent ground analysis. 
10. The highest level of classification of de-
fense articles, components, and services in-
cluded in this potential sale is SECRET. 
11. If a technologically advanced adversary 
were to obtain knowledge of the specific 
hardware and software elements, the infor-
mation could be used to develop counter-
measures that might reduce weapon system 
effectiveness or be used in the development 
of a system with similar or advanced capa-
bilities. 
12. A determination has been made that 
Egypt can provide substantially the same de-
gree of protection for the sensitive tech-
nology being released as the U.S. Govern-
ment. This sale is necessary in furtherance 
of the U.S. foreign policy and national secu-
rity objectives outlined in the Policy Jus-
tification. 
13. All defense articles and services listed 
in this transmittal have been authorized for 
release and export to the Government of 
Egypt.

progress in Europe. 
(vi) Sensitivity of Technology: SM–2 serves 
as the U.S. Navy’s primary all-weather, ship 
launched medium range (MR) surface-to-air 
air defense weapon and is an integral part of 
the AEGIS Weapon System (AWS) aboard Ti-
conderoga-class cruisers and Arleigh Burke- 
class destroyers, and is launched (primarily) 
from the MK 41 Vertical Launch System 
(VLS). SM–2 uses tail steering controls and a 
solid fuel rocket motor for propulsion and 
maneuverability, an inertial midcourse guid-
ance capable of receiving midcourse com-
mand updates from the shipboard fire con-
trol system, an electronic countermeasures- 
resistant monopulse receiver for semi-active 
radar terminal guidance/homing, and direc-
tional warhead blast fragmentation warhead 
that directs high velocity warhead fragments 
in the direction of the target. SM–2 is able to 
engage high-speed maneuvering and low alti-
tude threats, chasing threats closer to the 
water’s surface and defending against anti- 
ship missiles and aircraft out to 90 nautical 
miles. The Guidance Section handles the in-
formation and link processing that delivers 
the missile to its target, and TDD detects 
the target and activates the warhead fuze, 
leading to warhead detonation. 
The highest level of classification of de-
fense articles, components, and services in-
cluded in this potential sale is SECRET.

after her 35th birthday. Although the 
surgeons were able to remove 97 per-
cent of the tumor, the remaining 3 per-
cent was rooted too deeply to reach. 
True to form, Kristin rebounded from 
her surgery with energy and renewed 
purpose. Despite her prognosis, she ran 
a half marathon in April 2018, reported 
to work every day, and planned family 
outings. 
Stanford 
Medical 
Center 
quickly 
took note of Kristin’s energy and opti-
mism and asked her to participate in a 
patient education video project, saying 
they had been looking for someone like 
her for nearly 2 years. She filmed the 
video the very next week. 
Commander Driscoll served in the 
U.S. Coast Guard for 20 years and was 
the first in her family to serve. For the 
majority of that time, she was sta-
tioned in California, from San Diego to 
Alameda, and had a clear passion for 
Coast Guard operations. Specifically, 
she focused on emergency management 
supporting natural disasters, oil and 
pollution response, and search and res-
cue. 
She was a leader on a diverse list of 
operational teams that ranged from 
the National Contingency Plan ‘‘Spe-
cial Teams’’ that monitored Federal 
Marine Environmental Response oper-
ations across the southwest border to a 
Command 
Center 
that 
conducted 
search and rescue efforts across 3.3 mil-
lion square miles of offshore waters 
from California to the Panama Canal. 
In reviewing the achievements of 
Commander Driscoll, I am struck by 
her unwavering dedication and poise in 
confronting terrific challenges. She 
contributed to the response to the BP 
Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill, led a se-
curity 
deployment 
to 
Guantanamo 
Bay, and oversaw the first-ever deploy-
ment of a U.S. Coast Guard standard 
boat from a foreign naval vessel in sup-
port of counter-drug smuggling oper-
ations in the Caribbean. She deployed 
in the wake of Hurricanes Irma and 
Maria as deputy incident commander 
to lead search and rescue and recovery 
efforts, took a leading role in sup-
porting COVID–19 response efforts as 
planning section chief, and took the 
lead role as incident commander for 
the USS Bonhomme Richard fire. 
Commander Driscoll’s ability was 
well-noted throughout her life, and her 
record of success is etched in Coast 
Guard history. After graduating cum 
laude from Baker University in 2005, 
Commander Driscoll earned a master’s 
degree in Homeland Security Leader-
ship from the University of Con-
necticut. Her personal awards include 
an Advanced Boat Force Operations In-
signia, six Coast Guard Commendation 
Medals, two Coast Guard Achievement 
Medals, two Letters of Commendation, 
a NOAA Corps Directors Ribbon, and 
various service and unit awards. She 
was a leader in every sense, and I take 
some solace in the fact that her inspi-
ration will live on in the thousands of 
officers 
she 
taught 
at 
the 
Coast 
Guard’s Leadership Development Cen-
ter. 
Today, I thank CDR Kristin Driscoll 
for her devotion, as well as her husband 
PJ, daughters Averie and Cameron, and 
son Nolan. Her service was an honor to 
us all.

REMEMBERING HERBERT M. 
FRANKLIN 
Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, I honor 
Herbert M. Franklin, who passed away 
on November 16, 2021. He has left a 
meaningful and beautiful mark on the 
heart of our Nation’s Capital. 
Mr. Franklin’s true affection for the 
history and buildings of our excep-
tional Capitol and Washington, DC, 
was put to great use through his serv-
ice as executive officer to George M. 
White and Alan M. Hantman, the 9th 
and 10th Architects of the Capitol, 
from 1989 until Mr. Franklin’s retire-
ment in 2001. In that capacity, he acted 
as chief of staff for all administrative 
policies and actions of the agency, 
which has over 2,000 employees and is 
essential to the preservation and main-
tenance of this marvelous structure 
and its grounds. 
His appreciation for architecture, 
politics, and gardens showed in the 
thoughtful proficiency he put into the 
many important projects under his 
purview. Among his accomplishments, 
he served as project director for the de-
sign and construction of the Thurgood 
Marshall Federal Judiciary Building, 
the 1995 refinement of the Capitol Cen-
ter Visitor Project, the National Gar-
den Project, and the renovation of the 
U.S. Botanic Garden. 
Additionally, Mr. Franklin served on 
the National Capital Memorial Com-
mission. While on the commission, he 
worked on a special task force that 
also included the Commission on Fine 
Arts and the National Capital Planning 
Commission. The group was asked to 
draw up a master plan for the place-
ment of memorials in the capital city, 
with the challenging objective of pre-
serving the remaining open space on 
the Mall for particularly significant 
memorials. Through his role at the Ar-
chitect of the Capitol, he also served on 
the D.C. Zoning Commission. 
A person needed only to take a tour 
of the Capitol with Mr. Franklin to see 
just how deeply he loved it, the people 
who work in these halls, and the proc-
esses and procedures at the core of its 
operation. He delighted in his work and 
took very seriously his charge to guard 
and honor our Capitol. 
Susan Hawkes Wheeler, chief of staff 
for my Washington, DC, office, is one of 
the very lucky people to have benefited 
from one of Mr. Franklin’s tours. He 
gave Susan her first and best tour of 
the Capitol, and I am so glad he did. 
Her visit with his warm and hospitable 
family was instrumental in her decid-
ing to join my staff just a few weeks 
later. And she is just one of many who 
benefited from his experience and guid-
ance throughout his extraordinary life 
and career. 
Mr. Franklin’s admiration for archi-
tecture and the building arts also 
showed in his volunteer work, as he 
was instrumental in the founding of 
the National Building Museum. In 1977, 
he was part of a small group that cre-
ated the Committee for a National Mu-
seum of the Building Arts, in response 
to concerns over the fate of the his-
toric Pension Building in Washington, 
DC. Mr. Franklin drafted the legisla-
tion that eventually led to Congress es-
tablishing the National Building Mu-
seum in 1980. He later served as its 
counsel, sat on its executive com-
mittee, and was chairman of its board, 
among his many contributions. 
Mr. Franklin also devoted consider-
able time to leadership roles for many

other 
organizations. 
He 
taught 
at 
American University, was a guest lec-
turer at numerous colleges and univer-
sities, and was very involved in the 
governance of the Cosmos Club in 
Washington, DC, including as its presi-
dent. He also authored and coauthored 
several published articles and books. 
Mr. Franklin graduated from Har-
vard College and Harvard Law School. 
Originally from Milwaukee, WI, he 
started his legal career in his home-
town before coming to Washington, DC, 
during the Kennedy administration as 
a lawyer in the Housing and Home Fi-
nancing Agency. In 1965, he served as 
the director of the Business and Devel-
opment Center for Urban America, Inc. 
before becoming the first development 
administrator for the city of Middle-
town, CT. He couldn’t stay away from 
his beloved Washington, DC, for long, 
though, returning in 1968 to serve in a 
leadership role for the National Urban 
Coalition, where he staffed a national 
task force on urban revitalization. 
In 1973, Mr. Franklin became a found-
ing partner in the law firm of Lane and 
Edson, P.C. in Washington, DC, special-
izing in real estate finance and devel-
opment. He was in private practice 
until joining the office of the Architect 
of the Capitol in 1989. 
I extend my condolences to Mr. 
Franklin’s wife of 61 years, Barbara 
Braemer Franklin; daughter Marcia; 
son and daughter-in-law Jonathan and 
Sharon; 
son 
David; 
grandchildren 
Stephanie, Noah, Sophia, Norah and 
Sarah; and other family and friends. 
Thank you for sharing Mr. Franklin 
with us and our extraordinary seat of 
government he loved so much. We are 
all, no doubt, bettered by the respect, 
intellect and calm he put into the 
measured problem-solving that typified 
his service to our country.

TRIBUTE TO LESTER CASH 
Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, as 
chair of the Senate Appropriations 
Subcommittee on Labor, Health and 
Human Services, Education, and Re-
lated Agencies, I would like to recog-
nize an exceptional public servant 
deeply committed to protecting and 
improving the health of the American 
people, Mr. Lester Cash. Mr. Cash re-
tired recently after a distinguished 37- 
year career in the civil service, most of 
it spent at the Office of Management 
and Budget and the Department of 
Health and Human Services. It is at 
HHS, where he was the Associate Dep-
uty Assistant Secretary for Budget 
since 2007, that I and my staff came to 
depend upon Mr. Cash’s expertise, wis-
dom, and judgement. 
Mr. Cash is one of those unsung pub-
lic servants whose analysis and in-
sights are relied upon equally by 
Democrats and Republicans in both 
Chambers. He epitomizes the best of 
the professional civil service: dedi-
cated, credible and trusted by all who 
work with him. His unique skills, 
starting with advanced degrees in pub-
lic policy, philosophy, and theology, 
have given Mr. Cash a perspective that 
is both broad and sufficiently deep. His 
judgement 
on 
appropriations 
legal 
matters and insight on legislative lan-
guage was always sound, and his ready 
responsiveness at any hour made him 
the vital go-to person for the commit-
tees when time was tight. Whenever 
there was a complex question that 
needs solving, he was the person to 
call, whether it was for funding to re-
spond to a natural disaster, meeting 
our obligations to our September 11 
first responders, or ensuring that unac-
companied migrant children are treat-
ed humanely. Most recently, during the 
pandemic, Mr. Cash was instrumental 
to 
removing 
obstacles 
to 
secure 
COVID–19 tests, vaccines, and thera-
peutics for communities across the 
country. It is not an exaggeration to 
say that millions of Americans have 
been directly affected by his efforts 
and that his commitment saved lives. 
We are all better off because of Les-
ter. His unyielding dedication and in-
stitutional knowledge made him truly 
indispensable, and his absence will be a 
loss for all of us who depend upon him. 
I am glad that he will have more time 
to spend with his wife and son, Ada and 
Brian, friends and family. He certainly 
deserves it, and I wish him the best of 
luck in the future.

TRIBUTE TO LIEUTENANT 
JONATHAN KOKOT 
Mr. WICKER. Mr. President, today I 
honor an exceptional member of the 
U.S. Navy, LT Jonathan Kokot. I am 
proud to enter this tribute into the 
RECORD as I have had the pleasure of 
traveling overseas with Jon on mul-
tiple occasions, allowing me to see his 
professionalism, leadership, and dedi-
cation to duty firsthand. 
Lieutenant Kokot has distinguished 
himself through his professional char-
acter and dedication to serving this 
Nation in uniform. He has continued to 
excel in peerless service to our country 
while assigned to the Navy Senate Li-
aison Office. A native of Houston, TX, 
Jon is a 2013 graduate of Vanderbilt 
University 
and 
was 
commissioned 
through the Naval ROTC program. He 
completed primary flight school at VT– 
27 in Corpus Christi, TX, followed by 
advanced flight training at HT–28 in 
Milton, FL. 
Lieutenant 
Kokot 
joined 
the 
Battlecats 
of 
Helicopter 
Maritime 
Strike Squadron Seven Three (HSM) 73 
in April, 2016. He deployed to the West-
ern Pacific onboard USS Sampson (DDG 
102), an Arleigh Burke class guided- 
missile destroyer, in September 2016 in 
support of the Oceania Maritime Secu-
rity Initiative (OMSI) and received a 
Humanitarian Service Medal for his 
part in disaster relief following an 
earthquake in New Zealand. On Jon’s 
second 
deployment, 
his 
helicopter 
squadron was embarked on USS Theo-
dore Roosevelt (CVN 71), and later USS 
Halsey (DDG 97), for a deployment to 
the CENTCOM and INDOPACOM areas 
of responsibility. 
Lieutenant Kokot has also been pub-
lished in ‘‘Rotor Review’’ magazine. 
His article, ‘‘Deployment: A Junior Of-
ficer’s Perspective,’’ was recognized as 
the article of the year in 2018. That ar-
ticle discussed the ‘‘beauty’’ of flight 
deck operations on a modern aircraft 
carrier, writing: ‘‘one only has to 
watch the flight deck during launch 
and recovery of jets to realize there’s a 
half-century worth of training involved 
in each evolution. The movement of six 
different types of aircraft, including 
fixed-wing 
and 
helicopters, 
trans-
formed from parked and folded to en-
gines full blast within minutes, is 
mind-boggling. Five-thousand people 
aboard this floating fortress work 
around-the-clock to make this dance 
happen, and each member plays his or 
her role in a system of cogs which 
drives the most powerful peace ma-
chine on the planet.’’ 
Lieutenant Kokot also models a com-
mitment to volunteering. During his 
time in the Senate, he served addition-
ally as a White House social aide, sup-
porting more than 30 high-visibility 
events. He also served as a mentor and 
role model for disadvantaged youth 
who need a helping hand. While in 
flight training in Corpus Christi, Jon 
cofounded a mentorship program at 
Flour Bluff High School and personally 
provided 10 hours of mentoring per 
week to students in need. He continued 
this worthy effort with his involve-
ment in the Big Brothers Big Sisters 
program, beginning with his first fleet 
assignment in San Diego and again 
these last 2 years here in Washington, 
DC. He regularly spent a dozen hours 
each month with his young mentee. 
Jon’s interest and empathy for under-
privileged youth reflects the influence 
of his mother, who mentored middle 
and high school youth for over a dozen 
years in Houston. 
As a legislative liaison in the Navy 
Senate Liaison Office from February 
2019 
to 
February 
2022, 
Lieutenant 
Kokot performed his duties with dis-
tinction, supporting the 116th and 117th 
U.S. Congresses. Jon’s direct assistance 
provided critical information necessary 
for the passage of three National De-
fense Authorization Acts in the U.S. 
Senate, as well as peace of mind for 
members concerned about the welfare 
of our constituents. His efforts also 
helped ensure the confirmation of the 
77th and 78th Navy Secretaries and the 
32nd Chief of Naval Operations. 
Lieutenant Kokot led 28 congres-
sional delegations across the United 
States and the globe. He has escorted 
many Members of this Chamber on 
travel, as well the personal and profes-
sional staff who work in this Chamber. 
I have had the pleasure of traveling 
with Jon on a number of these trips. He 
has gone above and beyond the call of 
duty to facilitate and successfully exe-
cute each trip, despite any weather, 
aircraft, or diplomatic complications. 
He consistently performs his duties 
selflessly, and with a smile.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S412 
January 31, 2022 
After 3 years of serving in this vital 
role, during which he became a very 
popular fixture on Capitol Hill, Lieu-
tenant Kokot will return to sea duty in 
USS Tripoli (LPH 10), the Navy’s new-
est America class amphibious assault 
ship homeported in San Diego, CA. 
Tripoli was built in Pascagoula, MS, 
and is the third ship to bear the name 
of the first U.S. battle fought on for-
eign soil. This Chamber will keenly 
feel Lieutenant Kokot’s absence. A 
substantial debt is owed to Jon’s par-
ents, Ronald and Pamela Kokot, for 
the parenting and love that produced 
this outstanding young leader. Regret-
tably, Jon’s mother passed away when 
he was 22, but I know that she watches 
over her son with the same pride that 
is felt by many Members of Congress. I 
am grateful for LT Jonathan Kokot’s 
service and his work with my office 
and the Senate, and I salute him. May 
he always have ‘‘fair winds and fol-
lowing seas.’’

ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS 
REMEMBERING KAREN FERGUSON 
∑ Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I ask my 
colleagues to join me in honoring the 
life of a lifelong champion for Amer-
ican workers across the country, the 
founder and longtime president of the 
Pension Rights Center, Karen Fer-
guson. 
Karen came to Washington, DC, in 
the early 1970s to work with Ralph 
Nader as a public interest lawyer, 
fighting for consumers and workers 
against unchecked corporate power. As 
one of ‘‘Nader’s Raiders,’’ she found her 
calling. Recognizing the void of public 
advocacy for retirees and pensioners, 
Karen founded the Pension Rights Cen-
ter in 1976. This marked the beginning 
of a crusade that lasted more than four 
decades, on behalf of pensioners who so 
often did not have much of a voice in 
their own government. Over the next 45 
years, Karen personally assisted thou-
sands of workers who were denied the 
retirement benefits they earned, and 
she advocated for retirement security 
for millions more. 
As one of our country’s leading ex-
perts on pension law and a passionate 
advocate for workers and their fami-
lies, Karen was a source of strength 
and guidance to her allies in Congress 
for decades. She was instrumental to 
the passage of a number of reforms 
that improved the cause of retirement 
security, including the Retirement Eq-
uity Act of 1984, a critical law that pro-
vided benefits to millions of widows 
and divorced women. 
Most recently, Karen was a leader in 
the fight to protect and restore multi-
employer pension benefits for millions 
of union members across the country, 
including 100,000 Ohioans. She worked 
directly with my office to help draft 
the Butch Lewis Act and fought for 
years alongside Mr. Lewis, his widow 
and leader in her own right, Rita 
Lewis, and other workers, families, and 
small businesses, for its passage. Be-
cause of their advocacy, we were fi-
nally able to pass the Butch Lewis 
Emergency Pension Plan Relief Act 
into law as part of the American Res-
cue Plan in 2021. We were successful in 
no small part due to the unwavering 
support she provided. Now, more than a 
million Americans who have worked 
hard all their lives and gave up raises 
at the bargaining table in order to put 
that money toward retirement are no 
longer at risk of losing the benefits 
they earned. And many American busi-
nesses—often 
small, 
family-owned 
businesses—will be able to continue to 
support their workers and grow and 
create more good, union jobs. 
Karen Ferguson will be remembered 
for a lifetime of service on behalf of 
workers and their families, and the 
compassion and skill she brought to 
our efforts. Her legacy will continue 
through the millions of past, current, 
and future workers and their families 
who will have a more secure retirement 
thanks to her work.∑

TRIBUTE TO TONY COLTER 
∑ Mr. DAINES. Mr. President, today I 
have the distinct honor of recognizing 
Tony Colter of Powell County as Mon-
tanan of the Month for his many years 
of leadership in resolving forestry and 
timber issues and his dedication to 
making Montana a better place to live 
for all Montanans. 
Tony is a founding member of the 
Beaverhead-Deerlodge Working Group, 
which was formed in 2011. The group 
brings Montanans with diverse inter-
ests together to collaborate with For-
est Service staff and community mem-
bers to promote collaboration and 
transparency when solving forest-level 
issues in the Beaverhead-Deerlodge Na-
tional Forest. 
Tony’s leadership and passion for the 
Working Group has impacted the lives 
of many of his fellow Montanans. He 
has been instrumental in helping de-
velop science-based restoration strate-
gies, forging diverse partnerships, and 
improving 
Forest 
Service 
projects 
through collaborative approaches and 
recommendations. 
Fellow members of the Working 
Group say that Tony cares deeply 
about the group’s vision for the Forest, 
and his passion and charisma made him 
a valuable leader and representative 
for the Working Group. They say that 
learning from and working alongside 
Tony was an honor. 
Tony also worked for many years at 
Sun Mountain Lumber in Deer Lodge. 
His former coworkers, friends, and col-
leagues all agree that his efforts have 
made a lasting impact. Bryan Lorengo 
with the Montana Logging Association 
said, ‘‘The one thing that sticks out 
about Tony is his calm demeanor and 
willingness to listen first while re-
specting people’s opinions and views 
even though they might be opposite of 
his own.’’ 
It is my honor to recognize Tony for 
his leadership and commitment to 
bettering the Forest and serving his 
community. Through his passion for 
advancing the Working Group’s mis-
sion for and dedication to solving for-
est-related issues, I have no doubt that 
Tony’s hard work has made the great 
State of Montana a better place to live. 
Congratulations on your retirement, 
Tony. You make Montana proud.∑

REMEMBERING VICE ADMIRAL 
PAUL FOSTER 
∑ Mr. 
MARSHALL. 
Mr. 
President, 
today I wish to recognize VADM Paul 
Frederick Foster, USN, of Wichita, KS, 
on the 50th anniversary of his passing. 
Foster was the first Naval Officer to re-
ceive 
the 
Congressional 
Medal 
of 
Honor. Moreover, he earned the Navy 
Cross, 
the 
Distinguished 
Service 
Award, and Navy Merit Commendation. 
VADM Paul Frederick Foster was a 
true American hero. 
Paul Foster was in Wichita, KS, in 
1889. He was the son of a traveling min-
ister and thus grew up in Kansas, Utah, 
Oklahoma, and finally Idaho. There, he 
would attend the University of Idaho 
for 1 year before earning an appoint-
ment to the U.S. Naval Academy in 
Annapolis, MD, from Senator Fred 
Dubois of Idaho in 1907. In June 1911, 
Foster exited the Naval Academy as a 
passed midshipman with a bachelor of 
science. He was commissioned as en-
sign in July 1911. After graduation he 
would be attached to the USS Wash-
ington, but by December was quickly 
transferred to the USS Utah, a battle-
ship in the Atlantic Fleet. 
In the beginning of 1914, the United 
States chose to intercede in the Mexi-
can Revolution. While on its way to 
Mexico, the USS Utah was instructed 
to intercept a German ship carrying 
arms intended for the Mexican dictator 
Victoriano Huerta. The German ship 
arrived in Veracruz before the Utah, 
which resulted in the American occu-
pation of the city. During the fighting 
on April 21 and 22, Foster led his com-
pany ashore. For distinguished conduct 
in battle, he was awarded the Medal of 
Honor. 
Paul Frederick Foster would go on to 
serve as commanding officer of mul-
tiple submarines during World War I. 
During his service a submariner, he 
was promoted to the rank of lieutenant 
commander and was decorated with the 
Navy Distinguished Service Medal for 
the sinking enemy submarine. At the 
outset of U.S involvement in World 
War II, Foster was called for Active 
Duty at the rank of commander. He 
was tasked with naval inspections. The 
highest rank he would achieve was vice 
admiral at the time of his second re-
tirement from the Navy. After the war, 
Paul Frederick Foster was appointed 
to the Atomic Energy Commission in 
Vienna, Austria, by President Eisen-
hower. 
It is my honor to commemorate 
VADM Paul Frederick Foster for his

TRIBUTE TO AYOKA LEE 
∑ Mr. MARSHALL. Mr. President, I 
rise today to recognize a truly incred-
ible, and historic performance on the 
basketball court from K-State’s own, 
Ayoka Lee. 
Ayoka is the starting center for the 
Kansas 
State 
Women’s 
Basketball 
Team and recently set the NCAA all- 
time record on January 23 in Bramlage 
Coliseum for most points in a single 
game, scoring an astounding 61 points 
against 
the 
14th-ranked 
Oklahoma 
Sooners. To put into perspective just 
how extraordinary this is, the entire 
Oklahoma roster only scored 65 points 
against the Wildcats in that game. 
There is not much more I enjoy than 
seeing my alma mater win, so this 
record performance truly brings im-
mense pride to myself and every other 
K-State alumni. 
It is also no surprise that Ayoka was 
able to achieve this, given her resume. 
She came to Manhattan as a top 50 na-
tional recruit out of high school, then 
went on to be Big 12 freshman of the 
year, and First Team All Big-12 her 
freshman and sophomore year. Not to 
mention, she has also been on the Big 
12 Commissioner’s Honor Roll four 
times. Now in her junior year, Ayoka 
will surely be First-Team All Big-12 
again and is even in the Wooden Award 
Top-25 Watch List. If this 61-point per-
formance doesn’t earn her the Wooden 
award, it has at least won her a spot in 
every K-Stater’s heart, and we are all 
thrilled to hear about her plans to 
come back and play in her final year of 
NCAA eligibility as she completes her 
master’s degree in the Little Apple. 
I ask my colleagues now to join me 
in 
recognizing 
this 
outstanding 
achievement by Ayoka Lee. She has 
made the K-State community proud, 
and we are all rooting for her to suc-
ceed in her career and can’t wait to see 
her and the team bring home a na-
tional championship. ‘‘Go Cats!’’∑

499—CELE-
BRATING 100 YEARS OF DIPLO-

RELATIONS 
BETWEEN 
THE UNITED STATES AND THE

LEY, Mrs. SHAHEEN, Mr. BOOZMAN, Mrs.

Mr. BARRASSO, Mr. COONS, Mr. TILLIS, 
Mr. MURPHY, Mr. CRUZ, Mr. CARDIN, 
Mr. RUBIO, Ms. KLOBUCHAR, Ms. COL-
LINS, Mr. MERKLEY, Mr. REED, and Ms. 
STABENOW) submitted the following 
resolution; which was referred to the 
Committee on Foreign Relations: 
S. RES. 499 
Whereas the Baltic States of Estonia, Lat-
via, and Lithuania originally declared their 
independence in 1918; 
Whereas, in 1920, Soviet Russia signed trea-
ties with Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania rec-
ognizing their sovereignty and renouncing 
all territorial claims over each Baltic State 
in perpetuity; 
Whereas the United States established dip-
lomatic relations with Estonia, Latvia, and 
Lithuania as independent countries on July 
28, 1922, and the United States and the Baltic 
States have grown strong as partners for the 
past century; 
Whereas, on August 23, 1939, the Soviet 
Union and Nazi Germany signed the Molo-
tov-Ribbentrop Pact, which contained a se-
cret protocol dividing Eastern Europe into 
spheres of influence, with the Baltic States 
ultimately being assigned to the Soviet 
Union, leading soon after to the forcible in-
corporation of the Baltic States into the So-
viet Union; 
Whereas, following World War II, the So-
viet Union forcibly occupied the Baltic 
States, imposing its model of Soviet totali-
tarianism for more than 5 decades; 
Whereas the United States never recog-
nized the illegal occupation of Estonia, Lat-
via, and Lithuania by the Soviet Union, in-
stead maintaining 100 years of continuous 
diplomatic relations with the Baltic States; 
Whereas, in August 1989, approximately 
2,000,000 people joined hands in Estonia, Lat-
via, and Lithuania to form a 373-mile human 
chain across the 3 states known as the Baltic 
Chain of Freedom; 
Whereas, in February 1990, the people of 
Lithuania participated in the first free elec-
tion to select a new parliament, which 
promptly voted to restore independence, 
making Lithuania the first occupied Soviet 
republic to declare independence on March 
11, 1990, a move subsequently followed by 
Latvia on May 4, 1990, and Estonia on August 
20, 1991; 
Whereas, in January 1991, Soviet military 
forces tried to quash the growing independ-
ence restoration movement, leading to ap-
proximately 14 Lithuanian deaths, 6 Latvian 
deaths, and many injuries; 
Whereas, in February and March 1991, the 
people of Lithuania, Estonia, and Latvia 
voted overwhelmingly in support of their re-
spective independence restoration referen-
dums, which the United States recognized 
later that year; 
Whereas the Baltic States helped pave the 
path for democracy and freedom across East-
ern Europe, leading to the fall of the Soviet 
Union; 
Whereas, after the restoration of independ-
ence, the economies of Estonia, Latvia, and 
Lithuania emerged as modern market econo-
mies leading in technology and financial 
services sectors; 
Whereas Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania 
continue to demonstrate their commitment 
to advancing democratic values, peace, and 
security through their membership and ac-
tive participation in the North Atlantic 
Treaty Organization (NATO), the European 
Union, and the Organisation for Economic 
Co-operation and Development; 
Whereas the Baltic States have been loyal 
NATO allies, contributing to regional and 
global security through operations in Af-
ghanistan and leadership in the NATO Coop-
erative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence 
in Estonia, the NATO Strategic Communica-
tions Centre of Excellence in Latvia, and the 
NATO Energy Security Centre of Excellence 
in Lithuania; 
Whereas the Baltic States contribute to 
the security of the Euro-Atlantic area by 
spending at least 2 percent of gross domestic 
product for defense and to global security 
through determined participation in inter-
national allied operations and missions; 
Whereas Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania 
were among the first countries to participate

Whereas, in 2019, the United States and the

timidation, and cyberattacks from the Rus-
sian Federation and, as a result, have 
worked to shape total defense strategies to 
counter intervention by the Russian Federa-
tion; 
Whereas, after building trade ties with Tai-
wan, the Government of Lithuania has faced 
severe economic and diplomatic coercion 
from the People’s Republic of China; 
Whereas the Government of the People’s 
Republic of China has brazenly imposed a 
customs blockade on products from Lith-
uania and imports containing Lithuanian 
parts, with the European Union considering 
taking the matter to the World Trade Orga-
nization as a violation of international trade 
rules; 
Whereas, on December 21, 2021, in a call 
with Prime Minister of Lithuania Ingrida 
Simonyte, Secretary of State Tony Blinken 
underscored the ironclad solidarity of the re-
lationship of the United States with Lith-
uania as Lithuania faces geopolitical chal-
lenges to regional stability, security, and 
economic prosperity; 
Whereas, on January 5, 2022, at a joint 
press conference with Foreign Minister of 
Germany Annalena Baerbock, Secretary of 
State Blinken added, ‘‘We have immediate 
concern about the Government of China’s at-
tempts to bully Lithuania, a country of 
fewer than three million people. China is 
pushing European and American companies 
to stop building products with components 
made in Lithuania or risk losing access to 
the Chinese market, all because Lithuania 
chose to expand their cooperation with Tai-
wan.’’; 
Whereas, on January 24, 2022, the Secretary 
of Defense put 8,500 members of the Armed 
Forces on high alert for potential deploy-
ment to Eastern Europe as part of a NATO 
response force; 
Whereas support for the Baltic States by 
the United States remains a crucial factor 
for countering such economic and diplomatic 
coercion by the Government of the People’s 
Republic of China and ensuring security in 
the Baltic States and complements the ef-
forts of NATO to strengthen its deterrence 
and defense posture, including an enhancing 
its forward presence in the eastern part of 
the 
NATO 
Alliance 
with 
multinational 
battlegroups; 
Whereas the Baltic States have been mod-
els for democratic governance with strong 
institutions and respect for civil liberties 
and the rule of law, which are cherished 
shared values between the Baltic States and 
the United States; and 
Whereas, since the restoration of independ-
ence, the democratic and economic develop-
ment and progress of the Baltic States has 
established Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania 
as 3 shining beacons for freedom: Now, there-
fore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) celebrates 100 years of continuous diplo-
matic relations between the United States 
and Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania; 
(2) looks forward to continued growth in 
diplomatic relations between the Baltic 
States and the United States; 
(3) commits to providing continued support 
for the Baltic States through economic and 
security cooperation, including through the 
Baltic Security Initiative, further strength-
ening transatlantic ties and regional pres-
ence through the North Atlantic Treaty Or-
ganization; 
(4) recognizes the courage and resilience of 
the people of Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania 
in their fight for freedom and democracy in 
the face of aggressive behavior by the Rus-
sian Federation; 
(5) stands in solidarity with Lithuania 
against economic and diplomatic coercion by 
the People’s Republic of China; and 
(6) expresses the wish that the next 100 
years of friendship between the Baltic States 
and the United States continue to build on 
the positive achievements and progress made 
since the Baltic States restored their inde-
pendence.
