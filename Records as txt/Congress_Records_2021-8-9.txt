RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY LEADER 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The majority leader is recog-
nized. 
H.R. 3684 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, now, 
it may have taken all weekend, but the 
Senate is now finally on the precipice 
of passing major bipartisan infrastruc-
ture legislation. 
Last night, an overwhelming bipar-
tisan majority of Senators voted to 
surmount the final few procedural hur-
dles and put the bill on a glidepath for 
passage tomorrow morning. The bill 
will represent a substantial downpay-
ment toward the level of infrastructure 
investment our country needs, and for 
the first time, the Senate has come to-
gether around such a package in dec-
ades. I will have more to say about it 
before final passage. 
BUDGET RECONCILATION 
Now, Mr. President, all summer, I 
have spoken about how the Senate 
would proceed along two tracks when 
it came to infrastructure: the bipar-
tisan bill we will vote on tomorrow as 
well as the budget reconciliation bill 
that will allow Democrats to make his-
toric investments in American jobs, 
American families, and efforts to re-
verse climate change. 
In order to achieve such an ambitious 
legislative effort, I laid out two clear 
goals for this summer work period: 
pass the bipartisan bill and a budget 
resolution to set up the second track of 
our process before we leave for August 
recess. 
Many folks called that two-track 
process unrealistic. Many others said it

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S6062 
August 9, 2021 
is 
unachievable 
on 
such 
a 
short 
timeline and in such a slow-moving 
Chamber. But we have managed to 
steer two trains at the same time. 
There have been some bumps. There 
have been some delays. But the Senate 
is on track to finish both tracks. 
Earlier this summer, I suggested the 
two-track strategy to President Biden 
and Speaker PELOSI. We all agreed it 
was the best way to move forward, and 
we are working in concert to make it 
happen. 
This morning, Senate Democrats un-
veiled our budget resolution with rec-
onciliation instructions, which is the 
first step in unlocking the legislative 
process for a budget reconciliation bill 
later this year. 
Several Members—many Members— 
had a hand in crafting this package. We 
worked closely with our committee 
chairs, but I want to especially thank 
the chair of the Budget Committee, 
Senator SANDERS. He kept his nose to 
the grindstone and led our caucus on 
the 
budget. 
He 
always 
kept 
the 
thoughts and needs of American work-
ers and families at the top of his mind. 
As a result, the Democratic budget will 
be the most significant legislation for 
American families since the era of the 
New Deal and the Great Society. It is 
big, bold change—the kind of change 
America thirsts for. 
I want to thank other members of 
the Budget Committee, like Senator 
WARNER, who worked closely with the 
White House and Chairman SANDERS to 
develop a framework, and Senators 
MURRAY and WYDEN and STABENOW and 
WHITEHOUSE and MERKLEY and KAINE 
and 
VAN
HOLLEN
and 
LUJA´ N
and 
PADILLA, all of whom came together, 
even though each had different views 
on different issues, to produce this re-
sult, and a great result it is. 
I want American families to under-
stand what this legislation will mean 
for them—four simple things to keep in 
mind. I am borrowing Senator STABE-
NOW’s chart for this. It will lower costs 
for Americans, it will cut taxes for 
American families, it will create mil-
lions of jobs while tackling the climate 
crisis, and it will be paid for by the 
wealthy paying their fair share. These 
are four goals. The American people 
support every one of them overwhelm-
ingly. 
In all phases, we will concentrate on 
communities that have been too often 
neglected, including communities of 
color and Native Americans, by mak-
ing education, childcare, healthcare, 
and housing more affordable. We can 
give tens of millions of families a leg 
up by making sure that we can get our 
children out of poverty, and I thank 
the Presiding Officer for his leadership 
on that issue. We can provide ladders 
to families who haven’t had them be-
fore and help them climb into the mid-
dle class. 
Many of the policies we are proposing 
were in President Biden’s American 
Jobs and Family Plan, but some go be-
yond, like expanding Medicare to cover 
dental, vision, and hearing benefits— 
something that was left out of Medi-
care at the beginning. It never should 
have been, and we can rectify it now. 
By cutting taxes for tens of millions 
of American families, we can expand 
opportunity and make it easier for par-
ents to pass on a better life to their 
children and their grandchildren. By 
making further investments in infra-
structure, we can create tens of thou-
sands—hundreds of thousands—of good- 
paying jobs. By finally tackling cli-
mate change, we can spare our country 
and our planet the most devastating ef-
fects of global warming. 
Just this morning, a major new re-
port from climate scientists at the 
United Nations concluded that the na-
tions of the world have only a small 
window 
to 
‘‘prevent 
the 
most 
harrowing future’’—‘‘prevent the most 
harrowing future’’—in the words of the 
New York Times. 
Without immediate and bold action, 
we are staring down ever worsening 
floods and heat waves, droughts and 
sea level rise. The future of our planet 
looks bleak until we do something 
right now. The budget reconciliation 
bill will do more to combat climate 
change than any legislation ever— 
ever—in the history of the Senate. 
That is a promise. 
While my Republican colleagues re-
gurgitate the same tired talking points 
about a Democratic spending spree, let 
me remind America that we plan to 
pay for this package by making the 
wealthy pay their fair share. 
When our Republican friends held the 
majority in this Chamber, they chose 
to use the same process Democrats are 
using now—budget reconciliation—to 
give corporations and the wealthy a 
massive tax break. At a time of egre-
gious income inequality, the former 
Republican majority rammed through 
a bill where 83 percent of the benefits 
went to the top 1 percent—83 percent of 
the benefits. 
I have nothing against the wealthy. 
God bless them—they are doing fine al-
ready—but it is time to cut taxes for 
American families, middle-class fami-
lies, not multinational corporations. 
To make our Tax Code more progres-
sive and more fair, that is what Demo-
crats are going to do. Under this plan, 
there will be no tax increases on small 
business or American families making 
under $400,000. 
We are going to help small businesses 
create many, many, many jobs. 
We are going to give American fami-
lies a fair shot. We are going to tell 
middle-class families we are going to 
make it easier for you to stay there 
with your increasing costs of things 
like childcare and school and college 
and so much else. We are going to tell 
poorer families we are going to make it 
easier for you to climb into the middle 
class with things like the child tax 
credit and better healthcare and so 
much more. 
We are going to confront the genera-
tional challenge of climate change 
head on. We are not flinching; we are 
not wincing; we are going right at it. 
As bad as COVID was this year, and it 
was horrible, 5 or 10 years from now— 
every year—climate change will make 
things worse and worse and worse, even 
worse than it was this year in COVID, 
because when climate changes, it is 
such an overwhelming force that, un-
less we do something now, we may not 
be able to stop it down the road. 
So, taking a step back, at its core, 
the Democratic budget is about restor-
ing the middle class in the 21st century 
and giving more Americans the oppor-
tunity to get there. Unfortunately, the 
past 20 years in America have been a 
story of middle-class decline. 
We have all watched as globalization 
and technology transformed the way 
our economy works. Industrial manu-
facturing jobs were shipped overseas. A 
global financial crisis cost Americans 
their homes and their wealth. Giant 
conglomerates wiped out Main Street 
businesses from Arizona to Arkansas, 
from Michigan to Maine. The cost of 
raising 
a 
family—everything 
from 
childcare to college tuition—has be-
come exorbitant, almost unaffordable, 
even for those solidly in the middle 
class. 
Now, after the worst pandemic in a 
hundred years, American families are 
just starting to climb out of the rubble 
and look toward the future. We want 
them to look toward that future with 
hope and with optimism, not with the 
sourness and anger that we have seen 
throughout 
the 
land—exacerbated, 
played upon by the previous President. 
What the future looks like, in large 
part, depends on what we do here now. 
These next few months are crucial for 
the future of our country, even for our 
democracy. 
What we need to do in Congress is to 
give our workers, our businesses, our 
families a chance to prosper in a rap-
idly changing world, a chance to have 
hope, a chance to restore that Amer-
ican dream, which simply says, if I 
work hard, I will be doing better 10 
years from now than I am doing today, 
and my kids will be doing still better 
than me. When Americans lose that 
faith, lose that hope, that sunny Amer-
ican optimism that has been part of 
our character for centuries, bad things 
happen. Bad things happen to our de-
mocracy, to our relationships with one 
another, to just about everything. 
The social contract in America relies 
on the fundamental promise of eco-
nomic 
opportunity, 
the 
chance, 
through hard work, to do better for 
yourself and then give your children 
and grandchildren a better life than 
you have. That is what America is all 
about. That is what we are trying to 
restore and revivify here. 
When that promise is broken, when 
that American dream is no longer shin-
ing brightly in the sky, when faith in 
economic opportunity evaporates, we 
are not the America we were meant to 
be. We are not optimistic and entrepre-
neurial and forward-looking. Instead,

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S6063 
August 9, 2021 
we are bitter and angry and backward- 
looking and, as a result, much more 
prone to the sway of demagogues like 
Donald Trump. The divisions in our 
country and our politics today have 
their roots in the decline of economic 
mobility. 
Now, the American people don’t ex-
pect one piece of legislation to solve all 
our Nation’s ills—no single law can do 
that—but we have to start in a bold, 
strong way rebuilding the basic social 
contract for middle-class American 
families and for everyone struggling to 
get there: a promise of equal oppor-
tunity and equality; helping middle- 
class Americans stay in the middle 
class; building ladders to help others 
climb into that middle class. At its 
core, that is what this budget is all 
about, and we are going to take the 
first steps toward passing it very, very 
soon. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. Without objection, it is so or-
dered. 
RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The minority leader is recog-
nized. 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, last 
election cycle, Americans elected a 50– 
50 Senate, a closely divided House, and 
a President who promised unity and 
moderation. 
What have Washington Democrats 
done in response? 
They have set out trying to tax and 
spend our country into oblivion. They 
have handed the keys to domestic pol-
icymaking to Chairman SANDERS and 
some socialist House Members. 
In the spring, they passed a massive, 
inflationary, liberal spending bill that 
Democrats bragged was the most lib-
eral bill in American history. 
Now, this week, just a few months 
later, they want to start ramming 
through trillions more that will make 
that disaster look like child’s play. 
They call it $31⁄2 trillion in spending. 
Nonpartisan experts say those plans 
would more likely cost Americans 
about $51⁄2 trillion—trillions more bor-
rowing and trillions more spending, 
when inflation is already sticking 
American families with higher costs; 
new permanent welfare, with no work 
requirements, when small businesses 
are already struggling to find workers; 
sweeping amnesty, when the southern 
border is already in crisis; Green New 
Deal regulations, when Americans’ gas 
prices have already shot up; and crush-
ing tax hikes for family businesses and 
farms, as they fight to recover from 
the recession. 
So, apparently, tragedy and comedy 
really are two sides of the same coin. 
The tragedy is that Democrats want to 
inflict all this pain on middle-class 
families. Here is the comedy: They 
won’t let Republicans have any say in 
this monstrosity, but they want our 
help raising their credit card to make 
it happen. 
Democrats want Republicans to help 
them raise the debt limit so they can 
keep spending historic sums of money 
with zero Republican input and zero 
Republican votes. 
So imagine a friend tells you he is 
flying off to Las Vegas to blow all of 
his money. He doesn’t care that you 
think it is irresponsible. You aren’t in-
vited to come along, but he wants you 
to cosign a loan for him before he 
leaves. 
Now, I understand the administra-
tion sent out the Treasury Secretary 
to argue that, historically, both parties 
have addressed the debt ceiling to-
gether. Of course, it is our Senate Dem-
ocrat colleagues who have no interest 
in what is historically normal. Their 
borrowing and spending are histori-
cally abnormal. Democrats keep boast-
ing about how wild and revolutionary 
their partisan vision is. 
So our friends across the aisle should 
not expect traditional bipartisan bor-
rowing to finance their nontraditional 
reckless 
taxing-and-spending 
spree. 
That is not how it is going to work. 
Democrats have all the existing tools 
they need to raise the debt limit on a 
partisan basis. If they want 50 lockstep 
Democratic votes to spend trillions and 
trillions more, they can find 50 Demo-
cratic votes to finance it. If they don’t 
want Republicans’ input, they don’t 
need our help. It couldn’t really be sim-
pler, and it really couldn’t be more 
fair. 
Besides, I thought my colleagues 
were literally thrilled to present an-
other 
reckless 
taxing-and-spending 
spree 
to 
the 
American 
people. 
I 
thought 
middle-class 
families 
were 
supposed to be delighted with their so-
cialist shopping list. 
So shouldn’t Democrats be proud to 
own all the debt it requires? 
Our colleagues seem confident that 
Chairman SANDERS’ vision is worth 
sticking our kids and grandkids with a 
massive bill. They deserve to have 
total ownership of that decision. 
AFGHANISTAN 
Now, Mr. President, on a totally dif-
ferent matter, when the Biden adminis-
tration announced its reckless retreat 
from Afghanistan in April, I made my 
opposition perfectly clear. 
But I wasn’t alone. One of the most 
prominent liberal editorial boards in 
the country responded to the Presi-
dent’s move with this headline: ‘‘Biden 
takes the easy way out of Afghanistan. 
The likely result is disaster.’’ 
The administration’s own top intel-
ligence experts made a similar pre-
diction: 
The Taliban is likely to make gains on the 
battlefield, and the Afghan Government will 
struggle to hold the Taliban at bay if the co-
alition withdraws its support. 
The Director of the CIA told Sen-
ators that withdrawal would make his 
Agency’s job harder. And needless to 
say, the last time a Democratic admin-
istration tried a hasty retreat from the 
region offered a cautionary tale. 
Reality was clear to everyone but the 
very top of the Biden administration. 
From their bizarre choice of a symbolic 
September 11 deadline, to the absence 
of any concrete plan, the administra-
tion’s decision appears to have rested 
on wishful thinking and not much else. 
The notion that Afghan Forces might 
be able to stop the Taliban’s advance 
with only ‘‘over-the-horizon’’ support? 
That has proven to be wishful think-
ing. 
That the Taliban might respond to 
the diplomatic plying of the inter-
national community? Wishful thinking 
as well. 
As the administration’s withdrawal 
proceeds at full speed, expert warnings 
have become deadly realities. 
The Afghan people and their demo-
cratic institutions are literally being 
ripped apart by murderous theocrats. 
Nearly 1,000 Afghans have reportedly 
been killed already by Taliban death 
squads in the Province of Kandahar 
alone. 
In the last 2 months, the militants 
have taken more territory—more terri-
tory in the last 2 months—than they 
have held since 2001. And in just the 
last 4 days, the Taliban have raised 
their flag over six—six—provincial cap-
itals, including northern cities far, far 
from the group’s historic base of power. 
Militants are engaged in a campaign 
to assassinate crucial members of the 
remaining resistance, from military pi-
lots to top government ministers. 
All across the country, women and 
children are already suffering, in par-
ticular. One recent report claimed 
Taliban militans beat a child to death 
because his father—listen to this: Beat 
a child to death because his father 
served in the Afghan Armed Forces. 
What is more, the prospect of an 
emboldened 
al-Qaida—capable 
of 
threatening not only the region, but 
the American homeland—is now a near 
certainty, no matter what the Biden 
administration tells itself about the 
state of that threat today. 
And yet the State Department still 
mouths unbelievably naive platitudes, 
like ‘‘expectation’’ is that the Taliban 
will work toward ‘‘political settle-
ment,’’ even as the Taliban spokesman 
asserted that the most recent attacks 
are just ‘‘the beginning of retaliatory 
operations.’’ 
So does this sound like a group com-
mitted to peaceful means? 
Goodness’ sake, get a grip. 
This willful denial isn’t just costing 
Afghanistan; it is already costing the 
American people and our interests. 
It has forced loyal coalition partners 
to second-guess whether we can be 
trusted to finish what we start. It has 
led brave Afghans, who earned prom-
ises of assistance, to fear they would be 
abandoned amid our incompetent—

August 9, 2021 
completely 
incompetent—retreat. 
It 
has even left overwhelmed Embassy 
personnel to urge remaining Americans 
in Afghanistan to leave immediately 
by any means available. 
This morning, I attended a classified 
briefing from administration officials 
about 
current 
conditions 
on 
the 
ground. Look, needless to say, the 
briefers faced some tough questions 
about an entirely avoidable—entirely 
avoidable—situation that is deterio-
rating faster every single day; and they 
will certainly face more as global ter-
rorists feed from the rise of an extrem-
ist government in Afghanistan. 
I, for one, have warned repeatedly 
that those who seek to harm us, our 
friends, and our interests simply do not 
abide by our political time tables. They 
do not care if our leaders get tired of 
the task at hand. 
And this is not what victory looks 
like. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The Senator from Illinois. 
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I at-
tended the same classified briefing as 
the Republican Senate leader, and I lis-
tened carefully as the administration 
presented the realities of Afghanistan, 
and I was drawn to a historical analogy 
that was best captured in a short verse 
by Rudyard Kipling. 
It goes like this: When you’re wound-
ed and down on the Afghan plain, and 
the women come out to cut up your re-
mains, just roll on your rifle and blow 
out your brains and go to your God like 
a soldier. 
That stark verse was a description of 
what happened to the British Empire 
when they felt that moving into Af-
ghanistan would be part of their record 
of conquest. They learned otherwise. 
The retreat from Kabul has been re-
ported over and over, but it basically 
was a retreat that killed every remain-
ing British soldier, every member of 
their family, save one. They wanted 
one person, the Afghans did, to return 
to Queen Victoria and tell her what 
happened when they threw the British 
out of Afghanistan. A similar story can 
be told by the Soviet Union—now Rus-
sia—when they occupied Afghanistan 
with visions of changing that country 
forever to a Russian communist mode. 
They left bitterly disappointed, paying 
a heavy price. 
So 20 years ago, in the wake of 9/11, 
with 3,000 innocent Americans dead, we 
debated the issue on this floor as to 
whether the United States would fol-
low the British and Russians into Af-
ghanistan. 
I was here. I was asked to vote, and 
I remember why I voted yes. It was 
simple. Those responsible for 9/11 and 
the deaths of 3,000 innocent Americans 
were holed up in Afghanistan building 
their forces to strike us again. Would 
we respond? The answer was obvious. 
Yes. No one gets away with that sort of 
an attack on the United States, and I 
voted for us to send our forces into Af-
ghanistan. I dare say that neither I nor 
anyone else who voted for that decision 
ever dreamed that 20 years later we 
would still be in Afghanistan having 
lost 2,000 American lives of the brave 
American women and men who served 
there; tens of thousands of people in-
jured, trillions of American dollars 
spent, with virtually nothing to show 
for it. What we learned, the bitter les-
son for America, as it was for the Great 
Britain and the Russians, is that Af-
ghanistan has no appetite for out-
siders. 
We tried to bring them dramatic, 
positive improvements in their culture 
and 
education, 
the 
liberation 
of 
women, creating new opportunities, 
and maybe we had some marginal suc-
cess. But it is a battle when you try to 
change a nation’s ethic, and we learned 
it the hard way. 
At the briefing today, one of our col-
leagues whom I respect very much, 
Senator KAINE from Virginia, I thought 
asked the most important question 
about the current situation in Afghani-
stan. He said it was his understanding 
that the United States had spent bil-
lions, maybe more, in the training and 
equipping of the Afghan military forces 
supporting the government and that we 
had in fact trained and equipped over 
100,000, maybe as many as 300,000, of 
these Afghan security forces, and now 
they are losing territory and melting 
away into the landscape when they are 
under attack by the Taliban. 
Senator KAINE
said: I understand 
that there are only tens of thousands of 
Taliban and hundreds of thousands of 
Afghan security forces, and it appears 
we cannot hold our ground despite all 
the training and all the money. Was 
this is a failure of training or more? 
And those representing the administra-
tion were very candid. It is not a fail-
ure of training. It is an issue that, 
frankly, cannot be accomplished. 
So when I hear the Senator from 
Kentucky coming to the floor and beg-
ging us to stay, to what end? For what 
purpose? Senator KAINE, myself, and 
others invited him and the entire Sen-
ate to openly debate this question on 
the authorization for use of force in Af-
ghanistan. There was resistance. 
And the idea of actually, finally, 
leaving Afghanistan after 20 years, it 
wasn’t an original Joe Biden idea. If 
you 
remember, 
it 
was 
Republican 
President Donald Trump, who actively 
engaged in the negotiation and picking 
a target date for our troops to be gone. 
He tried and wanted to achieve that be-
fore he left office. He didn’t, but it was 
clearly his intent. So to blame the 
Biden administration for this decision, 
frankly, it is a decision that has been 
obvious for almost 10 years. There 
comes a point when we have to ac-
knowledge that we cannot ask another 
American to die in a vain effort to 
change Afghanistan into a modern na-
tion. It will only come when the Af-
ghan people reach that conclusion. 
SENATE AGENDA 
Mr. President, you know well, and I 
do, too, that we are usually not in ses-
sion in this week of August. It is usu-
ally a time to head back home, meet 
our constituents, eat our way through 
our State Fairs, and enjoy some down-
time with our families. This year, I was 
looking forward to a visit by some of 
my grandkids to Springfield when Lo-
retta and I have a week or two of just 
getting to know the kids again. 
We didn’t get to see them much last 
year because of COVID–19, and I was 
looking forward to the opportunity 
this year, but because we are in session 
I was unable to. We hope maybe in a 
few days that changes. 
I think about those grandkids, all of 
my grandkids—six of them at this 
point, I am proud to say—and what 
kind of world we are going to be leav-
ing them. 
A new school year is right around the 
corner. Along with all the normal sup-
plies, they will be buying face masks. 
For a young child, this pandemic must 
be confusing and scary. As a parent, 
you want to be honest with them, but 
you want to reassure them that every-
thing is going to be OK. That goes for 
all the challenges of our day, starting 
with climate change. 
This morning, the U.N. Intergovern-
mental Panel on Climate Change re-
leased its first report in 8 years. It is 
an alarm bell to the world, warning 
that our climate is changing much 
faster than we anticipated. 
I would like to read a couple para-
graphs from this morning’s New York 
Times because they summarize these 
U.N. reports and did that summary so 
well. 
‘‘Nations have delayed curbing their 
fossil-fuel emissions for so long that 
they can no longer stop global warming 
from intensifying over the next 30 
years, though there is still a short win-
dow to prevent the most harrowing fu-
ture, a major new United Nations sci-
entific report has concluded. 
Humans have already heated the 
planet by . . . 2 degrees Fahrenheit, 
since the 19th century, largely by burn-
ing coal, oil, and gas for energy. And 
the consequences can be felt across the 
globe: This summer alone, blistering 
heat waves have killed hundreds of peo-
ple in the United States and Canada, 
floods have devastated Germany and 
China, and wildfires have waged out of 
control 
in 
Siberia, 
Turkey, 
and 
Greece.’’ 
So what do we say to our kids about 
this? Dad, granddad, what are you 
doing about this? 
How do we reassure our kids that the 
planet they inherit is still going to be 
livable. Words aren’t enough. Denial 
certainly isn’t a plan. We need to do 
something. And we need to do what 
generations of Americans before us 
have done: face reality and face the 
challenges squarely. 
So I ask myself and all of us: What 
are we doing to make sure that my 
grandkids and all of America’s kids 
will be OK? 
We are going to have a chance to an-
swer that question this week as the 
Senate begins to debate on a proposal

that 
will 
define 
the 
world 
my 
grandkids and everyone’s kids will 
grow up in. 
President Biden’s plan to build back 
better is the most ambitious invest-
ment in America’s future in a genera-
tion. And much of that plan is included 
in the budget blueprint that we will be 
considering in a very short time. 
This budget blueprint will strengthen 
our Nation’s economy and ensure that 
working 
families 
have 
a 
fighting 
chance and receive a fair share of the 
wealth that their work produces. 
It will help close the income and op-
portunity gaps between the wealthiest 
among us and working families who are 
struggling to make it. And most impor-
tantly, it will give American workers 
the tools they need to outcompete any 
country in the 21st century. 
I listened to the criticism of the plan 
by the Senator from Kentucky, and I 
thought: If we don’t embark on an am-
bitious plan to deal with climate 
change and to move this economy in 
the right direction for working fami-
lies in this country, then, frankly, we 
are right in preparing, as some are, to 
accept a second-place finish for the 
United States of America. I think that 
is tragic. I don’t think it is consistent 
with who we are as a people. 
The proposal by President Biden will 
build on a winning economic strategy 
we started earlier this year with the 
American Rescue Plan. 
Mr. President, you remember that 
American Rescue Plan and I do, too, 
because last year, in the year 2020, 
when we were facing this pandemic on 
two, three, or four separate occasions, 
emergency bills came before us pro-
posed by the Trump administration, 
negotiated with a Democratic and Re-
publican Congress, presented to us on 
the floor, and there was virtual una-
nimity. Both parties stood together in 
the midst of a pandemic crisis to do 
what was necessary so that America 
could move forward. And then came 
the election and then came the Big Lie 
and then came the disintegration of 
this bipartisanship. 
When it was Joe Biden’s turn to come 
up with the American Rescue Plan, not 
a single Republican Senator, not one 
Republican Congressman, would vote 
yes. Not one. 
So what was in the plan that was so 
objectionable? Could it have been the 
money invested so that we would ad-
minister the coronavirus vaccines to 
every American successfully? That was 
in the plan. 
How about more money that we put 
in that plan for businesses so they 
could reenlist their workforce and 
start up again at the end of this pan-
demic? That was in the plan. 
How about the money that we prom-
ised American families, $1,400 cash pay-
ment, promised by Trump, delivered by 
Biden? That was in the plan. And not a 
single Republican would support it— 
not one. All of a sudden rescue plans 
became a partisan measure in the U.S. 
Senate and the House. The Republicans 
walked away from it. 
Well, let me tell you what the Amer-
ican Rescue Plan has done. It has re-
vived our Nation’s economy. We are on 
the course for a historic recovery. In 
the first 6 months, President Biden’s 
economy has added nearly 700,000 jobs a 
month, on average. During the first 
part of the year, our economy grew at 
the fastest rate in nearly 40 years. The 
American Rescue Plan, which not a 
single 
Republican 
would 
support, 
worked because it provided financial 
relief to the people who need it the 
most: working families. And that relief 
has benefited everyone. 
As part of this package—and you 
know it full well, Senator, because you 
were one of the authors—we enacted a 
child tax credit that we believe, fingers 
crossed, will cut child poverty in Amer-
ica by half. Think about that for a mo-
ment. By half. 
With the Build Back Better Plan, 
President Biden is proposing to extend 
that credit and reduction in child pov-
erty. That enhanced child tax credit is 
already changing the lives of tens of 
millions of families across America. In 
my home State of Illinois, there are 
hundreds of thousands of parents who 
are now able to fill their gas tanks and 
buy groceries because of it. 
Let me tell you about one: Lydia. 
Here is what she wrote: ‘‘With the child 
tax credit, I’ll be able to buy my kids 
their school supplies, clothes, what 
they need to get back to school, and 
put groceries on the table.’’ 
In the wealthiest Nation on Earth, no 
parent should have to choose between 
clothing her children and feeding them. 
President Biden’s plan to build back 
better is a blueprint for America’s fu-
ture, a future where every family 
knows the safety and dignity of finan-
cial security, and every child can reach 
their full potential. 
I look forward to a vigorous debate in 
the Senate on these and other pro-
posals in the budget blueprint. But 
right now I want to speak specifically 
to the funding the budget resolution 
provides for the committee I chair, the 
Senate Judiciary Committee. 
I see the chairman of the Budget 
Committee has come to the floor, Sen-
ator SANDERS, and I thank you for 
crafting this important bill. 
(Ms. WARREN assumed the Chair.) 
This proposal will make historic in-
vestments in fixing our broken immi-
gration system. It has been 35 years—35 
years—since we have had any meaning-
ful changes in our immigration law. If 
you go back to Ronald Reagan as 
President, that was the last time— 
Simpson-Mazzoli—names those of us 
who study the subject remember. Most 
people don’t, I am afraid. Yet that was 
the last time. 
Is there anyone who can say with a 
straight face that we don’t have a bro-
ken immigration system in this coun-
try? We do. 
The proposal will give us historic in-
vestments in fixing it. These reforms 
have the potential to generate more 
than a trillion dollars of economic 
growth over the next decade. I listened 
as the Senator from Kentucky, the Re-
publican leader, dismissed this whole 
conversation as ‘‘blanket amnesty’’— 
blanket amnesty—and correlated all 
immigration problems to the current 
challenge, and it is a challenge, that 
we face on our southern border. 
The reforms that we have in mind 
will provide a pathway to citizenship 
for Dreamers. Excuse me if I take this 
one personally, but it was 20 years ago 
that I introduced the DREAM Act in 
the U.S. Senate. As I said jokingly, at 
the time, if you asked people, ‘‘Who are 
the Dreamers?’’ they would say a Brit-
ish rock group—right?—led by a fellow 
named Freddie. 
Well, maybe they were right then, 
but 20 years later, when you say 
‘‘Dreamers’’—and people say it fre-
quently—you know who we are talking 
about. They are kids brought to the 
United States by their parents, who 
grew up in this country, pledged alle-
giance to that flag every day in their 
school classrooms, and believed in 
their heart of hearts that they were 
Americans to the core, only to learn 
when the parents worked up the cour-
age to tell them when they were teen-
agers that they were undocumented. 
They were kids without a country. 
The DREAM Act said: We are going 
to give you a chance, young man, 
young woman. You can earn your way 
to legal status and citizenship. Keep 
your nose clean. Don’t get in trouble 
with the law. Pay the necessary fees 
and wait, and we will give you that 
chance to become part of America’s fu-
ture. 
And even with that uncertainty in 
their lives, with the inability to qual-
ify for even Federal Government loans 
to go to college, they have written 
some dramatic stories. We all know 
them. Those of us in public life have 
met them. They are doctors and nurses 
and 
dentists. 
They 
are 
on 
the 
frontlines of fighting the COVID–19 
pandemic. They want to enlist, and 
some already have enlisted, in our 
military. They are lawyers. They are 
entrepreneurs. They are amazing, and 
they did it all never certain that they 
were going to be accepted in America. 
According to Senator MCCONNELL, 
they are part of this blanket amnesty 
of these immigrants who want to come 
to our country. Forgive me, Senator, 
but they are much more than that. 
This measure would also take care of 
temporary protected status people— 
people in the United States who came 
here because of a crisis in their own 
countries. We accepted them. They 
have lived here for 20 years and, now, 
frankly, they are caught in the middle. 
We give them a chance to earn their 
way to citizenship. 
And farm workers—do you know we 
have 2.4 million farm workers? These 
are men and women who get out and do 
the dirty, dangerous, hot work that 
Americans will never queue up to do. 
And they do it because we want fruits 
and vegetables on our table. We want

meat and poultry processed safely, and 
Americans won’t do the work. Let’s 
just be very candid about it. And I 
know this based on all the people who 
come to my office. These farm workers 
have been used by our country for 
years to pick our crops and deliver 
them safely to our tables, and we have 
a bill that we put together, with the 
growers and the workers in total agree-
ment, that gives these farm workers a 
path to citizenship. 
When we had a hearing on it in the 
Senate Judiciary Committee, one of 
the Republican Senators said: Oh, just 
what we need—instant amnesty for 
farm workers. 
Do you know what that instant am-
nesty is like? You have to show that 
you have spent 10 years of your life 
working in the fields before you even 
qualify for the 9-year process that can 
bring you to citizenship. Nineteen 
years—instant amnesty? No, it isn’t. 
And, again, other essential immi-
grant workers who have been saving 
our lives and keeping our families fed 
during this pandemic. They are called 
essential workers, but the categories 
that created these essential workers 
were defined by Donald Trump—not us, 
not Democrats. And we believe essen-
tial workers—whom we thanked pro-
fusely during this pandemic—if they 
are 
undocumented, 
should 
have 
a 
chance at citizenship. Those are the 
groups we are trying to work to bring 
into a full-time status. 
This measure would expand funding 
for commonsense measures to make 
our system safer for everyone by im-
proving the process of asylum claims, 
reducing immigration court backlogs, 
and starting to secure our southern 
border. 
More than 200,000 DACA recipients 
are essential critical infrastructure 
workers. Tens of thousands of these 
young people have been saving our 
loved one’s lives as nurses, doctors, and 
medical 
professionals. 
Hundreds 
of 
thousands of undocumented farm work-
ers will account for about half of our 
Nation’s farm workforce and do back-
breaking labor every day to put food on 
our tables. These members of our com-
munities have more than earned their 
path to citizenship. 
I am going to get into the weeds a bit 
here, but I want to say, under a Senate 
rule known as the Byrd Rule, any pro-
vision included in reconciliation must 
have a substantial and direct impact 
on the budget, and this impact cannot 
be merely incidental. That is kind of 
the roadmap for this budget resolution. 
I am sure the Senator from Vermont 
knows it well. 
Let’s be clear. A pathway to citizen-
ship as part of our immigration pack-
age on the budget reconciliation bill 
would have a substantial and direct im-
pact on our budget. A pathway to citi-
zenship for Dreamers and immigrants 
with temporary protected status would 
have a budgetary cost of approximately 
$42.4 billion over 10 years, according to 
the Congressional Budget Office. This 
is a critical component of our eco-
nomic recovery. There is no world in 
which this budgetary impact is merely 
incidental—$42.4 billion. 
Creating a pathway to citizenship, 
though, is not just a matter of cost. 
There are also benefits. It would boost 
our Nation’s GDP by $1.5 trillion over 
the next 10 years. It would create 
400,000 new jobs and increase every 
American’s annual wage by an esti-
mated $600—win, win, and win. 
There is ample precedent for passing 
this 
important 
legislation 
through 
budget reconciliation. The Republicans 
have used this process to open up the 
Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in 
Alaska for drilling and enacted a $1.9 
trillion tax cut for the wealthiest 
Americans and corporations. 
In addition, in 2005, Senate Repub-
licans used reconciliation to dramati-
cally increase the number of lawful 
permanent residents by an estimated 
3.2 million over 10 years. Now they are 
saying it doesn’t belong in reconcili-
ation. In 2005, they put it in. This is the 
exact same immigration status we are 
proposing to give Dreamers, TPS hold-
ers, farm workers, and essential work-
ers. 
I have tried for many years to pass a 
path to citizenship. Republicans have 
obstructed bipartisan immigration re-
form time and time again, including 
filibustering the DREAM Act at least 
five times. This year, I convened bipar-
tisan immigration negotiations that 
dragged on for months. Republicans 
made unreasonable demands and in-
sisted on attaching partisan provisions 
that would actually cut legal immigra-
tion. Republicans have rejected com-
monsense measures to help secure our 
border. 
It is clear that the only viable option 
for passing immigration reform is 
through the reconciliation process. For 
those who claim they are concerned 
about our southern border, here is your 
chance. Here it is—to invest billions of 
dollars in smart and effective steps to 
improve border security. We need to 
provide a pathway to citizenship for 
Dreamers and others who are contrib-
uting to our economy every day and 
will help to grow it for years to come. 
I am going to close by thanking the 
Senator from Vermont. I don’t know 
when I first approached him with this 
notion of including immigration, but 
from day one, Senator SANDERS has 
been supportive of the concept and now 
has given us our chance. Millions, mil-
lions of people who make America bet-
ter are watching and hoping that in the 
next days and weeks we can achieve 
our goal and give them a chance to find 
a path to citizenship and become an 
important part of America’s future. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Vermont. 
Mr. SANDERS. Madam President, let 
me thank Senator DURBIN for his lead-
ership in so many areas, including the 
understanding, as he just indicated, 
that the time is long overdue for com-
prehensive immigration reform and a 
path toward citizenship for millions of 
undocumented workers and families in 
this country. Thank you very much, 
Senator DURBIN. 
As a former mayor, I do understand 
how important physical infrastructure 
is—roads, 
bridges, 
water 
systems, 
wastewater plants—and I am delighted 
that finally we are beginning to ad-
dress our long neglected physical infra-
structure. Frankly, it is rather incred-
ible that, year after year, we ignore 
crumbling bridges and roads. And as we 
address our physical infrastructure, we 
can create a whole lot of good-paying 
jobs. 
So that bill that we are discussing 
right now is enormously important. I 
will tell you what is even more impor-
tant, and that is to address the long ne-
glected needs of the working families 
of our country, of the children, of the 
elderly, of the sick, of the poor, wheth-
er they are Black or White or Latino, 
Native 
American, 
Asian 
American. 
These are needs that Congress has ig-
nored for much, much too long. 
Now, 
I 
understand 
that 
Senator 
MCCONNELL, the Republican leader, and 
others are really shocked by this bill. 
They cannot believe it. Imagine—just 
imagine—that the U.S. Senate is ad-
dressing the needs of working families 
and is going to stand up for ordinary 
Americans 
rather 
than 
just 
the 
wealthy and powerful? What is this 
world coming to? Don’t we understand 
that here in the Senate we are sup-
posed to take campaign contributions 
from the drug companies and the insur-
ance companies and the fossil fuel in-
dustry and from the 1 percent and do 
their bidding? Isn’t that the way it has 
always been done here in the U.S. Sen-
ate? 
Well, Senator MCCONNELL, things are 
changing. For once in a very long time, 
the U.S. Congress is going to stand 
with working families and not just the 
rich and the powerful. 
Further, above and beyond the eco-
nomic crisis facing working families, 
Congress has ignored the great existen-
tial threat of our time, and that is cli-
mate change. You don’t have to believe 
me. Maybe some of my Republican col-
leagues might want to take a look at 
the IPCC report, which came out 
today, which said that if we do not act 
boldly and immediately all over this 
planet, the world that we will be leav-
ing our children and grandchildren will 
be increasingly unhealthy and un-
inhabitable. 
But you don’t have to just read the 
IPCC report. Open up your eyes. Look 
at what is going on in California, the 
fires in Oregon, the fires in Greece, and 
the drought that is impacting coun-
tries all over the world, which will 
mean a decrease in food production and 
water supply. 
We have to act now in order to save 
the planet. There is no choice. We can-
not go home and look our children and 
grandchildren in the eye if we do not 
act now and lead the world. We can’t

do it alone. We are going to have to 
work with China and India and Europe, 
but we cannot continue to ignore this 
existential threat. 
The gap between the very, very rich 
and everybody else is wider today than 
it has been in 100 years. People on top 
are doing phenomenally well. In fact, 
we have two people in America today 
who own more wealth than the bottom 
40 percent. The top 1 percent owns 
more wealth than the bottom 92 per-
cent, and since 2009—the Wall Street 
collapse—45 percent of all new income 
has gone to the top 1 percent. 
And, incredibly, during the pandemic 
that we are experiencing now, billion-
aires in America have seen their 
wealth increase by $1.8 trillion during 
this pandemic, while at the same time, 
thousands of essential workers died 
providing the goods and services we 
needed. 
Billionaires become richer. Ordinary 
people have to go to work—public tran-
sit, 
grocery 
stores, 
hospitals—and 
thousands die. While some of our 
multi-multibillionaires 
are 
spending 
some of their enormous amounts of 
money flying off into outer space, 
today and in the coming days we are 
going to address the crises facing work-
ing families right here on the ground, 
on planet Earth. 
And that is why, as chairman of the 
Senate Budget Committee, I am proud 
to introduce a $3.5 trillion budget reso-
lution that we will soon be consid-
ering—I expect tomorrow. 
This is a budget resolution that will 
allow the Senate to move forward on a 
reconciliation bill that, in my view, 
will be the most consequential and 
comprehensive piece of legislation for 
working people, for the elderly, for the 
children, for the sick, and for the poor, 
that this body has addressed since 
Franklin Delano Roosevelt, the New 
Deal, in the 1930s. 
This is a budget resolution that will 
address the needs of working families 
because we understand, if our Repub-
lican colleagues do not, that there is 
something fundamentally wrong when 
real inflation accounted-for wages for 
working people has not gone up for al-
most 50 years. 
We have seen in recent years, as ev-
erybody knows, an explosion in tech-
nology, an explosion in worker produc-
tivity. And yet, in real inflation ac-
counted-for dollars, where the very, 
very rich become much richer, real in-
flation accounted-for wages for work-
ers has not gone up in almost 50 years. 
What does that mean? 
It means the cost of healthcare has 
soared. The cost of education has 
soared. The cost of housing has soared. 
And yet real workers, real working 
families of this country are earning in 
real dollars the same wages that they 
did decades ago, which means that 
many of them are struggling right now 
to keep their heads above water eco-
nomically. 
In the richest country in the history 
of the world, half of our people should 
not be living paycheck to paycheck, 
worried about how they are going to 
pay their rent or provide food for their 
kids. 
This legislation, in so many ways, be-
gins to address the working families of 
our country. But one important way— 
maybe the most important—is, as we 
address the needs of our people in 
healthcare, in education, in climate, 
we are going to create many millions 
of good-paying—good-paying—jobs that 
the American people desperately need. 
I want to say a few words today 
about the budget resolution that we 
are introducing and what is going to be 
in the reconciliation package that we 
will soon be undertaking. 
For a start, one of the questions that 
everybody is going to ask is: Well, how 
is this going to be paid for? Expensive 
bill, $31⁄2 trillion. You know, that is a 
lot of money. 
It is. 
Well, I happen to think, and I know 
that you do as well—I say to the Pre-
siding Officer that maybe, just maybe, 
the time is now for the wealthiest peo-
ple in this country and the largest cor-
porations who are doing phenomenally 
well, but in a given year, many of them 
have not paid a nickel in Federal in-
come tax—ah, the average Joe, the av-
erage Mary out there, they are work-
ing. They are paying their fair share of 
taxes. But if you are an Amazon, if you 
are a Jeff Bezos, if you are one of these 
multibillionaires, you have lobbyists, 
you have accountants, you have law-
yers, and you can avoid paying your 
fair share of taxes. 
So what some of us are saying is that 
maybe, just maybe, even if you are a 
billionaire, even if you are a large, 
profitable corporation with all kinds of 
lobbyists and accountants, maybe you 
should start paying your fair share of 
taxes. 
My Republican friends say we are 
going to be raising taxes. Well, you are 
right, we are. But we are going to be 
raising taxes on the wealthiest people 
in this country—something which is 
long overdue—and yet nobody in Amer-
ica earning less than $400,000 a year 
will pay a nickel in taxes, and many, 
many, will actually be paying less in 
taxes. 
So my Republican friends can com-
plain all that they want, but I do be-
lieve, and the American people do be-
lieve, that the time is now for the 
wealthy, the powerful, the large, prof-
itable corporations to start paying 
their fair share so that, in fact, we can 
lower taxes for working families in this 
country. 
I think the American people have al-
ready begun to see what good public 
policy for working families can mean. 
In Vermont, in Massachusetts, and all 
over this country, working families— 
the vast majority of our families—are 
now receiving a $300-per-month check 
per child, and this is long, long over-
due. 
Some say this is a radical idea. It is 
not. It is exactly what countries all 
over the world do because they under-
stand, and we understand, how difficult 
it is today for working families to raise 
children. 
And I am enormously proud of the 
fact—and everybody in this Chamber 
should be proud of the fact—that at a 
time when the United States has one of 
the highest rates of childhood poverty 
of any major country on Earth, as a re-
sult of the work in the American Res-
cue Plan, which must be extended in 
the reconciliation bill, we have reduced 
childhood poverty in America by 61 
percent—61 percent—because we are 
now getting the resources out to moms 
and dads that they need in order to 
adequately and decently raise their 
kids. 
You know, I hear a lot of talk about 
how we love our kids or the future of 
our country. Well, if we love our kids, 
we have to love their parents as well, 
and we have to make it easier for par-
ents to raise their kids. 
But it is not just the child tax credit. 
I suspect that there are very few people 
in this country who do not understand 
how dysfunctional our childcare sys-
tem is. We are not living in the 1950s, 
where dad goes out to work and mom 
stays home with the kids. That is not 
the case anymore. It has not been the 
case for a very long time. Dad is out 
working and mom is out working be-
cause families all across this country 
need two breadwinners in order to pay 
the bills. 
While mom is working and dad is 
working, who is taking care of the 
kids? 
And that is, in fact, a major, major 
crisis in this country, and the current 
system just is not working. 
In my State, the State of Vermont, it 
costs $15,000 a year, which is about the 
national average, to send your child 
into childcare. 
What does that mean? 
It means that if you are making 
$60,000 a year, you are spending a quar-
ter of your income just to make sure 
that your child is well taken care of 
while you go to work. If you have two 
kids, forget about it. It doesn’t pay to 
go to work because you are spending so 
much on childcare. Everybody under-
stands that. That is not a debate. 
So the time is long overdue not only 
to protect the needs of working fami-
lies, but also to provide well for our 
children. 
Psychologists 
after 
psychologists 
have told us that the most important 
years of human development are 0 
through 4. And yet so many of our kids 
all over this country—little kids—are 
sitting in front of TV sets, not getting 
the kind of nurturing, emotionally and 
intellectually, that they need. This leg-
islation begins to change that. 
Under our proposal, no working fam-
ily in this country should be paying 
more than 7 percent of their income for 
childcare. 
Working parents, do you hear what I 
just said? No more than 7 percent—not 
30 percent, not 25 percent.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S6068 
August 9, 2021 
That is what we should be doing. 
And we have so much work to do in 
childcare. I know the Presiding Officer 
understands that. We got to build new 
facilities for kids because once we open 
the door for affordable childcare, the 
truth is we don’t have enough space to 
accommodate the children. 
And we have got to start paying 
childcare workers the wages they are 
due for the enormously important 
work they are providing. We got 
childcare workers in America today 
making less than McDonald’s workers. 
What an insult. How wrong is that? 
So this legislation is going to provide 
increased subsidies for working fami-
lies to afford childcare. We are going to 
pay workers in childcare living wages 
and benefits, and we are going to build 
the new facilities that we need to ac-
commodate the families who will now 
have the opportunity to take advan-
tage of childcare. 
But in terms of our children, who we 
have ignored for so, so long, we are 
going to do even more than that. We 
are going to make pre-K education for 
3- and 4-year-olds free. God didn’t cre-
ate an education system that begins in 
kindergarten. It is created by human 
beings, and the world has changed. And 
what we have got to understand now, 
with so many of our parents working, 
that we have got to make pre-K edu-
cation for 3- and 4-year-olds free, and 
that is what we do in this legislation. 
And, by the way, not widely reported, 
but when we revolutionize childcare 
and pre-K so that moms and dads know 
that their kids are in quality and af-
fordable facilities, we are going to see 
more than a million women able to go 
into the workforce because they no 
longer have to stay home to take care 
of the kids. If they want to work, we 
will give them the opportunity to pur-
sue their careers. 
The Presiding Officer knows, and I 
know, that there is something a little 
bit absurd that the United States of 
America is literally one of two nations 
in the entire world—and I am talking 
about poor nations—that does not 
guarantee paid family and medical 
leave. 
What does that mean? 
What it means: That there are work-
ers today who are at work when they 
are sick. Maybe they are spreading the 
virus or some other illness. There are 
working families who have to make a 
choice: Does mom go to work and leave 
her sick child at home alone, or does 
she stay home and maybe lose her job? 
I have talked—and I am sure the Pre-
siding Officer has spoken—to women 
who gave birth to a baby and a week 
later—a week later—was forced to go 
back to work because they had no in-
come coming in. 
I know this may shock some of my 
Republican colleagues, but there are 
countries all over this world that un-
derstand that it is enormously impor-
tant that parents be able to bond with 
their babies. And in countries around 
the world, women get 4 months, 5 
months, 8 months off with full pay or 
with a significant part of their pay-
check in order to stay home with their 
newborn babies. 
So, finally, finally, we are begin-
ning—beginning; more to do; begin-
ning—to end the international embar-
rassment of the United States being 
the only major country on Earth not to 
guarantee paid family and medical 
leave. 
I know the Presiding Officer has been 
involved in this issue—I have and a 
number of my colleagues have—in the 
understanding that in the contem-
porary global economy, if our young 
people are going to go out and get de-
cent-paying jobs, a shock of all shocks, 
they actually need to have the skills 
and the education in order to perform 
those jobs. 
So you have a situation now where 
there are jobs all over this country 
that are lying vacant, not being taken, 
because people don’t have the skills. 
Now, I personally believe we should 
do what other countries are doing and 
we should make all public colleges and 
universities tuition-free and should for-
give all student debt. That is not in 
this bill. 
But what is in this bill is a begin-
ning—a beginning—and that says that 
we will make community colleges in 
this country tuition-free. 
Now, what does that mean? 
It means a couple of things. It means 
that if I go to community college, I can 
learn a skill—whether it is nursing, 
whether 
it 
is 
construction 
trades, 
whatever it may be. I can learn the 
skills that I need to go out and get a 
job that pays me a living wage. 
And that is enormously important 
because—especially as we rebuild this 
country—as we begin to pay attention 
to healthcare and to childcare and to 
taking care of our parents and the dis-
abled people, we need skilled workers, 
and making community colleges tui-
tion-free for 2 years is an important 
step forward in allowing people to gain 
those skills. 
But, also, for those people who want 
to go to a 4-year college, those 2 years 
of 
community 
college 
credits 
are 
transferrable. So your tuition is paid 
for the first 2 years. My hope is that we 
will soon be able to pay for the next 2 
years as well, but this is a real start in 
allowing millions of young people to 
get an education today that previously 
they could not afford. 
Two blocks away from where we are 
in the Nation’s capital there is an en-
campment of homeless people. All over 
this city, you can’t drive down the Na-
tion’s capital and not see people sleep-
ing out on the street, and that is true 
in virtually every major city in Amer-
ica. Once again, the richest country in 
the history of the world, and some 
600,000 Americans are homeless. 
Then, on top of that, you have got 
about 18 million households where peo-
ple are spending 50 percent or more of 
their limited incomes to put a roof 
over their heads. 
Now, how do you survive economi-
cally if you are spending 50 percent of 
your income on housing? 
This legislation will create a huge 
number of good-paying jobs by the 
largest investment in American his-
tory in low-income and affordable 
housing. And I see the chairman of the 
Banking Committee here, and I want 
to thank Senator BROWN for his impor-
tant work in that area. 
Just a few days ago, I had a chat with 
a gentleman whose wife is seriously ill. 
He works and he pays for the home 
healthcare that she needs, and it is an 
expensive proposition. 
What we understand is that, in an 
aging society and at a time when we 
have so many people with disabilities 
whose needs are not being met, it 
makes eminent sense to bring skilled 
home-healthcare 
workers 
into 
the 
home rather than to force people to go 
into a nursing home, which, by the 
way, is more expensive. And this legis-
lation, the reconciliation bill that we 
will soon be working on, will make his-
toric investments in home healthcare 
and make sure that those workers— 
like childcare workers, who do such 
important work—are adequately com-
pensated. 
IPCC today reported what all of us 
know, and that is, if we do not begin in 
an extremely aggressive way trans-
forming our energy system away from 
fossil fuel, the planet that we will be 
leaving our children will be increas-
ingly unhealthy. 
It really does take your breath away 
to look at those photos—whether it is 
Oregon, 
whether 
it 
is 
California, 
whether it is Greece right now—and see 
flames consuming entire communities. 
And if anybody out there thinks that, 
gee, isn’t this too bad that it is hap-
pening this year, you have got it 
wrong. It is only going to get worse if 
we do not act and act boldly, which is 
why this legislation will pour hundreds 
of billions of dollars into the fight to 
transform our energy system away 
from fossil fuel, including a civilian 
Climate Corps, which will give the 
young people of this country the oppor-
tunity to roll up their sleeves, get de-
cent pay, and get educational benefits 
in order to do what is so much in their 
hearts, and that is to combat climate 
change. 
I wish that I could tell you that my 
Republican colleagues understand the 
crises facing working families and that 
they understand the moral imperative 
of us having to address climate change 
and that we are working together to 
do, in fact, what the American people 
want: create millions of good-paying 
jobs, addressing the needs of working 
families and climate change. 
I wish I could tell you that, but I 
can’t. As we go forward, in all likeli-
hood, we will not get one Republican 
vote. We are going to have to do it on 
our own with 50 Democratic votes here 
in the Senate, plus the Vice President 
of the United States. 
Now, some of my Republican friends 
will say: Well, that is such a bad idea.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S6069 
August 9, 2021 
Why aren’t you more bipartisan in 
terms of reconciliation? 
Well, I would remind my Republican 
colleagues that they didn’t have a 
problem with reconciliation when they 
gave almost $2 trillion in tax breaks to 
the very richest people in this country 
and the largest corporations. No prob-
lem doing that. They didn’t have a 
problem with reconciliation when they 
tried to throw 30 million people off of 
the healthcare they had by abolishing 
the Affordable Care Act. 
So that is where we are. We are fac-
ing a crisis facing working families. We 
need to create millions of good-paying 
jobs. We need to tackle the existential 
threat of climate change. We need to 
expand healthcare and Medicare so 
that elderly people have dental care, 
eyeglasses, and hearing aids. We need 
to lower the cost of prescription drugs 
and have Medicare negotiate prices 
with the pharmaceutical industry. We 
need to make sure that we get doctors 
and nurses and dentists into under-
served areas. 
So, Madam President, tomorrow be-
gins one of the very important debates 
that we have ever had. And the ques-
tion is not complicated. Do we have the 
courage to stand up to powerful special 
interests and tell the corporate world 
and the 1 percent: Yeah, you are finally 
going to have to pay your fair share of 
taxes so that we can create millions of 
good-paying jobs for working families, 
so we can protect our children, protect 
the elderly, and address the threat of 
climate change? 
That is the issue. And I have absolute 
confidence that we will, in fact, rise to 
the occasion and do what the American 
people want and that we will pass the 
budget resolution tomorrow. 
With that, Madam President, I yield 
the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Ohio. 
Mr. BROWN. Madam President, I 
first thank Senator SANDERS for his 
passionate support for housing. He un-
derstands, having traveled the country 
and connected with so many people, 
that there is almost nothing more im-
portant—maybe nothing more impor-
tant to people’s lives, to their material 
lives, than having a safe, accessible, af-
fordable place to live. 
And 
Senator 
SANDERS
mentioned 
that 25 percent of renters in this coun-
try pay half their income in rent, for 
housing costs. And one thing goes bad 
in their lives—their car breaks down, 
their child gets sick, they miss a few 
days of work because of a minor in-
jury—and their whole lives can turn 
upside down. Senator SANDERS recog-
nizes that. 
And the legislation we begin later in 
the week is such an important step, as 
the Presiding Officer knows as a mem-
ber of the Banking and Housing Com-
mittee, that we are going to take on 
housing. So I thank Senator SANDERS 
for that. 
H.R. 3684 
Madam President, I rise today with a 
longer speech than I normally give, but 
in support of the legislation that will 
make the generational investment in 
infrastructure for Ohio communities, 
for our Nation—the infrastructure in-
vestment we should have been making 
for years. 
We remember, 4 years ago, all of us 
on this floor—all three members on 
this floor: the Presiding Officer and 
Senator SANDERS and I—were all ready 
to go with President Trump to move 
forward on infrastructure, and the 
President and the majority changed its 
mind. Instead of investing in jobs, in-
vesting in infrastructure, investing in 
people, they used that trillion-dollar- 
plus in a huge tax cut, 70 percent of 
which went to the wealthiest 1 percent. 
So this time we didn’t let that hap-
pen. I thank the 22 Members—11 Repub-
licans and 11 Democrats—that held to-
gether and negotiated this very com-
plicated bill. This investment is about 
jobs—creating good-paying union jobs; 
rebuilding 
bridges; 
replacing 
lead 
pipes; manufacturing next-generation, 
energy-efficient buses. 
It is about better connecting people 
with jobs through transit and bridges 
and highways. 
It is about getting people in rural 
Kansas or western Mass. or southeast 
Ohio 
or 
inner-city 
Cleveland 
the 
broadband they need to go to school 
and prepare for the jobs of the future. 
Supporting 
manufacturing 
jobs 
throughout my State, which this bill 
does, including at Cleveland-Cliffs in 
Cleveland and AK Steel in southwest 
Ohio and Nucor in central Ohio and 
other suppliers through the strongest 
ever—the strongest ever, by America’s 
standards—negotiated, working with 
Senator PORTMAN, legislation that we 
worked on with Senator BALDWIN, 
making steel and iron and other com-
ponents in Ohio for all these projects. 
Taken together, these investments 
are a recipe for job creation in commu-
nities large and small, rural and urban, 
in Ohio, from Appalachia to the shores 
of Lake Erie. 
For too long, Washington has ignored 
these places while Wall Street has 
preyed upon them. That ends now. We 
invest in people and places that make 
this country work. 
I hear from mayors of both parties in 
towns all over Ohio about their vision 
for their community and the projects 
they want to undertake. They know 
the opportunities we can unleash. They 
need the investment. It is time for all 
of our communities to share in this 
country’s prosperity. That is what this 
legislation does. 
I want to focus on a few key provi-
sions that will be central and critical 
to Ohio. Right now, there are more 
than 3,200 bridges across Ohio that need 
repairs to make them safer and to re-
duce congestion so people can get to 
work, kids can get to school, farmers 
and businesses can move their products 
and support Ohio jobs. 
I remember, as a kid, I worked on a 
family farm just outside Lexington, 
OH, in sort of north-central Ohio, and 
we used a tractor, and I used to drive 
grain to the market, or we would take 
hay wagons to the barn. We would 
cross some of these small, little culvert 
bridges or bridges across creeks. Some 
of us called them cricks. And I know 
how some of those bridges, even then, 
looked to be in some disrepair and how 
important it is that we keep them up 
for farmers and for small business all 
over my State. 
Many 
know 
the 
Brent 
Spence 
Bridge—talked about in all kinds of na-
tional infrastructure stories—between 
Ohio 
and 
Kentucky. 
Unbelievably 
enough, it carries 3 percent of the 
country’s GDP either north to Ohio or 
south to Kentucky across the river—3 
percent of the country’s GDP—every 
day. But it is dangerously outdated. 
It was completed, I believe, in 1960. 
Many of us fought for years for Federal 
investment. 
Many of us have fought for years for 
Federal investment. One of the first 
news events, community events, I did 
when I came to the Senate in 2007 was 
go to the Brent Spence Bridge and ex-
press my commitment that we needed 
to do something. It was not quite—it 
wasn’t in the shape then that it is now, 
but it clearly needed support and need-
ed help. 
Three and a half years ago, I intro-
duced the Bridge Investment Act, to 
put Ohioans to work, repairing and up-
grading Ohio bridges, with American 
iron and steel. This week, we are on 
the verge of getting it done. It will pro-
vide a grant to pay for half of the cost 
of replacing Brent Spence, and the ad-
ditional funding in the package will 
support the remainder of the project. 
We expect Ohio to get at least $9.8 
billion for Federal-aid highway assist-
ance, including $480 million of formula 
funds for bridge replacement to supple-
ment the Bridge Investment Act. 
It is not just Brent Spence that needs 
help; it is the Western Hills Viaduct in 
Hamilton County; it is I–70 over the 
Scioto River in Columbus in Franklin 
County; it is U.S. 30 in Richland Coun-
ty in North Central Ohio; it is the 
Broad Street Bridge in Columbus; it is 
major projects and smaller bridges on 
rural farmlands that let farmers get 
goods to market. 
I talked this week with 81-year-old 
Howard Krueger. He lives in Wyoming, 
OH, outside of Cincinnati. He is retired 
from Procter & Gamble. A few years 
ago, as he was driving, a piece of the 
Western Hills Viaduct fell on his wind-
shield. He stopped his car and got out 
and picked up the rock—about as big as 
his fist, a little bigger than his fist— 
took it with him and talked about it on 
a radio news conference we did. 
It is a pretty visceral example of 
what we all know: Our Nation’s infra-
structure is literally crumbling. We 
need this investment. Think about the 
economic potential waiting to be un-
leashed when we fix these crumbling 
bridges—the kinds of bottlenecks that 
frustrate commuters and farmers and 
businesses in Ohio every day.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S6070 
August 9, 2021 
I want to thank our bipartisan co-
sponsors of the Bridge Investment Act: 
Senators WYDEN, the chair of the Sen-
ate 
Finance 
Committee; 
Senator 
WHITEHOUSE; 
Senator 
INHOFE
from 
Oklahoma; Senator WHITEHOUSE from 
Rhode Island—early partners in this ef-
fort. I want to thank Chairman CARPER 
and Ranking Member CAPITO, just 
across the river from Southeast Ohio, 
from West Virginia; the EPW Com-
mittee for their continued support. 
The Banking and Housing Committee 
also provided a major part of this infra-
structure package that includes record 
record—record—investment in public 
transportation. The Presiding Officer 
sits on this as a prominent member of 
this committee. She knows, as I know, 
that through her career and through 
my career—for almost a decade and a 
half, as long as I remember—this com-
mittee is just referred to by the media 
and by Senators as the ‘‘Banking Com-
mittee.’’ It was all about Wall Street. 
It was little about community banks. 
It was almost nothing about housing. 
That has changed. This committee 
now we all refer to as the ‘‘Banking 
and Housing Committee.’’ Some refer 
to it as the ‘‘Housing and Banking 
Committee.’’ 
In this committee, we take our job 
with public transit seriously. This 
package contains historic funding: $90 
billion over the next 5 years, $40 billion 
increase for public transit—the largest 
ever. It will connect people with better 
jobs. It will promote equity. It will 
help our planet. 
The Banking and Housing Committee 
held extensive hearings this spring on 
infrastructure and transit. We heard 
from Ohioans like Darryl Haley, who 
heads SORTA, Southwest Ohio Re-
gional Transit Authority. We heard 
from Mayor Horrigan of Akron. We 
heard over and over and over again 
what we need to revitalize these essen-
tial systems, whether in Cleveland, 
where I live, or Youngstown or Toledo 
or anywhere in our State. We provide 
$11⁄2 billion so that cities like Cleveland 
and Ranking Member TOOMEY’s biggest 
city in his State, Philadelphia, can re-
place rail cars that, unbelievably, date 
back to the Reagan administration or 
earlier. 
This bill ensures that public trans-
portation receives more than 20 per-
cent of the new investment from the 
highway trust fund. Senator SHELBY, 
once chair of this committee—retiring 
after, I believe, 36, 37 years on this 
committee—talked to me about that 
80–20 split that has been here as long as 
he has been here, a tradition that both 
parties have respected. 
This bill takes a huge step toward 
electrifying the transit bus fleet, pro-
viding over $5 billion for the low emis-
sion and no emission program. It will 
mean modernizing the bus fleets in 
every city in America. 
These funds will also retrain workers 
who maintain our current diesel fleet. 
Every electric bus purchase will keep 
and create good-paying jobs. 
This bill will support investments in 
flood mitigation, an important issue 
that members of the Banking and 
Housing Committee, especially Senator 
MENENDEZ but a number of Senators in 
both parties who represent coastal 
States from Massachusetts, the Pre-
siding Officer’s State, all the way to 
Louisiana, Senator KENNEDY’s State. 
I want to thank the members of the 
Banking and Housing Committee, in-
cluding Ranking Member TOOMEY, who 
worked to reauthorize Federal transit 
programs. 
I particularly want to thank our 
Housing and Transit Subcommittee 
Chair TINA SMITH, from Minnesota, and 
the subcommittee’s ranking member, 
Senator ROUNDS, from South Dakota. I 
have worked with both of them. I have 
been to their subcommittee. Their ef-
forts have been especially important to 
improve rural transit, including in In-
dian Country. 
We are going to keep working to help 
rural transit agencies even more. We 
had hearings under the leadership of 
Chairman CRAPO 3 or 4 years ago where 
I heard stories from Senators in small-
er States—mostly Republicans—talk-
ing about the importance of rural tran-
sit, where someone who lives out in the 
country, a bus—a paratransit bus— 
picks her up, takes her to her dialysis 
treatment, and then takes her back. 
That is kind of different from city- 
urban, big city bus transit but equally 
important to families. 
I thank our Democratic Members for 
their strong focus on transit. Senator 
MENENDEZ, from New Jersey, and Sen-
ator REED, from Rhode Island, continue 
to be leaders in fighting for a fair share 
of funds for transit. Senator TESTER, 
from Montana, and Senator WARNER, 
from Virginia, played a key role in en-
suring the committee’s transit title 
moved forward in the bipartisan nego-
tiations. 
Our committee, the Banking and 
Housing Committee—we owe them spe-
cial thanks. Senator WARNER and Sen-
ator VAN
HOLLEN, from Maryland, 
fought to reauthorize funds for Ohio, 
for ‘‘America’s subway,’’ the Wash-
ington, DC Metro system, serving mil-
lions in this region; and Senator VAN 
HOLLEN’s legislation to improve agency 
safety plans and give workers a strong-
er voice in safety matters is a big vic-
tory for labor. 
The chair of the Labor Committee 
just walked in, and her work on these 
issues—in this case, bus safety, but 
safety of workers overall is so very im-
portant. We know that busdrivers are 
often a special target, and protecting 
them is essential. 
Senators WARNOCK and OSSOFF, our 
newest members on the committee 
from Georgia, helped us fight for better 
bus rapid transit and better planning, 
something that Metro Atlanta cries 
out for, and they have been loud, 
strong voices on that. 
Senator CORTEZ MASTO contributed 
provisions to link transportation plan-
ning with housing needs. 
I want to thank the Presiding Offi-
cer, Senator WARREN, and other Mem-
bers of our caucus who kept advocating 
for zero-emission buses, not just for 
Boston but for the whole country. 
These buses help fight the climate cri-
sis. They help clean the air in neigh-
borhoods plagued by air pollution. Peo-
ple in inner cities, more often than not 
the quality of the air they breathe is 
partly because there aren’t many trees; 
it is partly because of public transit. It 
is a whole host of issues, but this takes 
a major step in dealing with that. 
I want to thank Senator DUCKWORTH. 
The Americans with Disabilities Act 
became law 30 years ago, but some 20 
percent of our rail stations still—still— 
remain inaccessible. My friend Senator 
CASEY, who sits next to me on the 
floor—chair of the Aging Committee— 
he and I were proud to cosponsor her 
proposal. Her bill provides almost $2 
billion for accessibility grants. Sen-
ators DUCKWORTH, CASEY, and I will 
continue to push for more resources 
until every transit station is acces-
sible. 
I want to thank Senator SINEMA, also 
a member of our committee, and Sen-
ator PORTMAN and other Members of 
the bipartisan group for bringing this 
momentous infrastructure package to-
gether. 
It is obvious how some of the job cre-
ation in this package will happen. You 
build a bridge. You lay down rail 
tracks. You hire American workers to 
do it. None of these jobs ever, in an in-
frastructure plan, can be shipped over-
seas. But this investment is different 
from those that have come before it. 
For the first time, every single one of 
these projects will come from the 
strongest-ever ‘‘Buy America’’ rules. It 
means we get more job creation from 
Wichita to Seattle, to Boston, to Cleve-
land. We get more job creation for 
every single dollar of taxpayer invest-
ment. 
Throughout my time in the Senate, I 
have worked to strengthen our Na-
tion’s ‘‘Buy America’’ laws at every op-
portunity. And there have always been 
interest groups in this town that have 
written loopholes into these laws and 
weaken these laws. For instance, one of 
the most expensive bridges in Amer-
ican history, the Bay Bridge, in North-
ern California—a loophole enabled it to 
be made entirely of Chinese steel, from 
a company owned by the Chinese Gov-
ernment. 
Think about that. You know, we talk 
all the time about China. Our corpora-
tions lobby to get tax breaks and trade 
agreements to outsource jobs to China. 
We don’t see the hypocrisy there. We 
don’t see the hypocrisy in letting 
China make the steel for the Bay 
Bridge. But nonetheless, those days are 
behind us. We know how much steel 
can go into a bridge and how many 
steelworkers in Cleveland or Middle-
town or Gary, Indiana, can be em-
ployed to make the steel. 
I have worked with colleagues from 
both sides of the aisle to strengthen

‘‘Buy America’’ laws in the highway 
bill, in the Defense Authorization Act, 
and in the Water Resources and Devel-
opment Act. These efforts have been 
piecemeal. That is piecemeal. That is 
why I asked Senator PORTMAN to join 
me and Senator BALDWIN
in Build 
America, Buy America—a bill we intro-
duced on President Trump’s Inaugura-
tion Day. We have worked with other 
leaders on Buy America, and we will 
continue to. I especially call out Sen-
ator BALDWIN. 
It took 4 years; we are finally getting 
it right. We are putting in place a 
clear, comprehensive standard: Amer-
ican tax dollars should support Amer-
ican jobs, period. American tax dollars 
should support American jobs, period. 
These historic investments will sup-
port Ohio manufacturers and not their 
foreign competitors. With potential for 
hundreds of bridge repair projects 
alone, this investment in Ohio combine 
with our strong ‘‘Buy America’’ rules 
means job creation in every region of 
my manufacturing State. 
It keeps the promise I have made to 
Ohioans my entire career that I would 
fight for the dignity of work. When you 
love your country, you fight for the 
people who make it work, to ensure the 
industrial heartland would be the en-
gine of opportunity that drives us into 
a 21st century economy. 
Finally, while I am supporting this 
bill and am excited for all the invest-
ments it will make in Ohio commu-
nities and Ohio jobs, I am disappointed 
that a number of my colleagues re-
jected the idea that we should pay for 
this bill by enforcing our country’s tax 
laws. 
I oppose the provision forcing home 
buyers to pay more each month to help 
fund investments that wealthy tax 
cheats should pay for. The money that 
home buyers pay should be going to-
ward keeping our housing system sta-
ble, making sure that everyone has an 
affordable home. 
We can do more. We will do more in 
the coming months to address afford-
able housing. Those that were in the 
Chamber heard Senator SANDERS talk-
ing about the importance of housing in 
the reconciliation bill. I will come 
down to the floor later today and talk 
in some detail about that. 
Finally, I would be remiss if I did not 
thank my staff for their hard work on 
this effort. Many of them had planned 
August vacations. It is the only time of 
year where they really get sort of 
untrammeled, unrestricted time with 
their families. And all of them have 
given up something already this month 
and July. And they are public servants, 
for sure. They understand commit-
ment. They do this without com-
plaining. Their hard work has been so 
obvious to me and so obvious to people 
that pay attention, not necessarily ob-
vious to my constituents, and I want to 
call them out. 
Homer Carlisle was instrumental in 
helping negotiate and craft the transit 
title and the bridge legislation. Ben 
Lockshin, a fellow from the Federal 
transit Administration, assisted Homer 
in these efforts. I want to thank Re-
becca 
Higgins 
and 
Mary 
Frances 
Repko, with Chairman CARPER’s staff. I 
have done conference calls with them. 
My staff works closely with them. Rob-
ert Andres, with Chairman WYDEN— 
Chairman WYDEN is chair of one of the 
most important committees in this 
Congress and has been a leader in 
wanting the wealthy to pay their fair 
share and wants to make sure it is 
large corporations that share the tax-
payer bill and the tax burden and pay 
their fair share and less burden on 
small business. Aaron Goldner, for-
merly with Senator WHITEHOUSE, and 
my former aide Leah Hill—they all 
made the bridge legislation possible. 
In my office, Beth Cooper provided 
technical assistance on the very com-
plicated flood mitigation portion of 
this bill. Megan Cheney and Chad Bolt, 
Elisha Tuku, and Corey Frayer pro-
vided the analyses and guidance on 
matters relating to the bill’s pay for. 
Carolina Young—new on my staff but 
already making her mark—and Abigail 
Duggan worked on the ‘‘Buy America’’ 
provisions. 
My staff has worked with others on 
‘‘Buy America’’ over the years, but 
Sam 
Mulopolus, 
with 
Senator 
PORTMAN’s staff; Brian Conlan with 
Senator BALDWIN have been particu-
larly helpful. And I want to recognize 
my former aide, Nora Todd, who led 
our efforts for much of a decade on 
‘‘Buy America.’’ 
Through all of this, joining me on the 
floor today, too, is Laura Swanson, my 
staff director, who works unbelievable 
hours with a small child and continues 
to be a terrific mother and wife and an 
amazing staff director. 
I say exactly the same about our leg-
islative director, Jeremy Hekhuis, who 
is not a terrific mother but a terrific 
father with a family and has worked so 
very, very hard holding all this to-
gether for over a decade. I thank my 
staff. I thank my colleagues. 
This legislation—I remember saying 
to Senator CASEY on March 6 when we 
passed the American Rescue Plan—I 
turned to him because of the child tax 
credit and what we did with pensions 
and so much else that Senator MURRAY 
worked on too—I turned to BOB and 
said: This is the best day of my legisla-
tive life with what we are able to do to 
cut rates of child poverty and so much 
else. Well, this bill today is almost as 
big in its scope and is so very impor-
tant to this country. I am pleased to 
add my support to it. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Kansas. 
Mr. MORAN. Madam President, I 
joined the bipartisan infrastructure 
group of 22 Senators. I am one of the 
originals. I did so for a number of rea-
sons. One is how important infrastruc-
ture is to Kansas and to the country. 
I would highlight the importance of 
infrastructure investment to my State. 
We are in the middle of the country, 
where our manufactured goods and ag-
ricultural commodities need to be able 
to compete in the world economy. How 
efficiently and effectively we get those 
goods and those commodities to mar-
ket has a huge consequence to the abil-
ity for Kansans to earn a living. 
Across our State, from Southeast 
Kansas to Southwest Kansas, from the 
suburbs of Kansas City in Johnson 
County and Wyandotte County, all 
across Northwest and Central Kansas, 
the demand for improved roads, greater 
safety, is there. There is a great desire 
to see that roads and bridges are re-
paired. 
County 
commissioners 
and 
trustees of our townships have called 
to say: We have a bridge. Could you 
help us do something about that? 
So I entered this group of 22 Sen-
ators. I was one of the 11 to provide 
some input and to see that Kansas pri-
orities—that we had a seat at the table 
and to help negotiate a deal that didn’t 
raise taxes, that didn’t spend trillions 
of dollars and focused on actual tradi-
tional infrastructure, and to avoid 
what I fear is to follow, what I would 
describe as a Democratic wish list. I 
wanted this to be a smaller, more af-
fordable, paid-for package that was not 
excessive in scope, didn’t add to the na-
tional debt, and did not raise taxes on 
the American people. 
This package includes a number of 
priorities of mine, including a historic 
increase in investment in broadband 
and does provide critical resources to 
repair our roads, bridges, and airports. 
So a desire for a seat at the table, a 
desire to invest in infrastructure, and I 
also would add a desire to see that this 
U.S. Senate, Republicans and Demo-
crats, can work together for a bene-
ficial product for the American people. 
However, from the very beginning, I 
outlined criteria that would be needed 
to be met for my support on any final 
outcome of the negotiations. My pri-
ority was that the bill be paid for and 
therefore not raise the national debt. 
Half of the new spending in this bill 
is not offset—is not offset—with re-
duced spending or increases in nontax 
revenues. The Congressional Budget Of-
fice scores this bill as adding a quarter 
of a trillion dollars to the national 
debt. 
My view has been from the beginning 
that if we can only find offsets to pay 
for a certain amount—in this case, 
about half of the increased spending in-
cluded in this bill—then the size of our 
bill should be half of what it is. If you 
can only find a way to pay for half of 
what you are spending, then spend less 
money—spend 
half 
as 
much 
less 
money. That, of course, was not the 
outcome of these negotiations. 
Additionally, I had hoped that this 
bipartisan plan would dissuade Demo-
crats from pursuing their own partisan 
$3.5 trillion tax-and-spend spree. The 
Democratic plan to immediately follow 
this bipartisan infrastructure bill with 
their own spending bill significantly

undermines the bipartisan effort to de-
liver a good outcome for the people of 
this country. 
I had hoped that if we reached a bi-
partisan agreement—in fact, I had 
hoped a bipartisan agreement would be 
reached among the 22 Senators, but 
pretty early in the negotiations, it be-
came clear that there was significant 
input and direction from the Biden ad-
ministration and from the majority 
leader, the Democratic majority leader 
in the U.S. Senate. So instead of nego-
tiating with my colleagues and seeking 
an outcome that we supported, it had 
to be run by those who are in the White 
House and those who are the leadership 
of the Democratic Members of the U.S. 
Senate. 
My desire to see that we pass or 
reach an agreement to pass a bill that 
would be paid for did not occur, was 
not met—that criteria was not met— 
and the desire to see Democratic Sen-
ators say: If we do this together, we are 
not going to do something else on our 
own. In fact, some of the things we ne-
gotiated in or out of the bipartisan 
package will now be included in the 
broader package of the Democratic 
wish list. 
It doesn’t make a lot of sense to me 
to reach an agreement, only to dis-
cover then that in a succeeding bill, 
one that immediately follows, the 
things that we negotiated in or out are 
now included or taken out. So the bi-
partisan nature of the agreement is in 
many ways offset by the bill that fol-
lows. 
Reaching an infrastructure deal in a 
bipartisan way would send a great mes-
sage that we are capable of working to-
gether, and I certainly indicate to my 
colleagues—I particularly indicate to 
Senator SINEMA, the Senator from Ari-
zona, how much I appreciate her efforts 
to pull us together and to lead our 
meetings in a productive way, and I 
would say again that I am open to 
those opportunities. 
I am saddened by the fact that this 
did not reach an agreement that I can 
support, but I certainly indicate to my 
colleagues that I am willing to work 
with Republican and Democratic Mem-
bers of the Senate to see if, in other in-
stances, we can come together in a way 
that provides hope for the American 
people that we can work together on a 
better product than we were able to 
reach in this instance. 
Unfortunately, to sum up, there is 
too much spending, too much debt, and 
therefore there will be too much infla-
tion. My efforts to reach a compromise 
were honest and sincere, and I regret 
that we were unable to arrive at a bill 
that I can support. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Tennessee. 
CORONAVIRUS 
Mrs. BLACKBURN. Madam Presi-
dent, recently, Francis Collins, who is 
the current Director of the National 
Institutes of Health, said in an inter-
view: 
We call on China to really open up, some-
thing they have not done, and to be more 
transparent about what could be known 
there. 
He was, of course, talking about the 
origins of the COVID–19 pandemic. 
I couldn’t agree more with Dr. Col-
lins. The world is entitled to know 
what happened in Wuhan. However, we 
have a saying in Tennessee that I think 
applies here: What is good for the goose 
is good for the gander. 
Of course, my question to Dr. Collins 
is, When will we see transparency from 
the NIH about its role in the origins of 
the pandemic? 
On June 28, along with my colleagues 
Senators MARSHALL and GRASSLEY, I 
wrote to Dr. Collins asking him to open 
up the books on the NIH’s relationship 
with Chinese researchers. 
Madam President, I ask unanimous 
consent that this letter be printed in 
the RECORD. 
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the 
RECORD, as follows: 
JUNE 28, 2021 
FRANCIS S. COLLINS, M.D., Ph.D., 
Director, National Institutes of Health, Be-
thesda, MD. 
DEAR DR. COLLINS: On June 23, 2021, the 
Wall Street Journal reported that Chinese 
researchers ‘‘directed’’ the National Insti-
tutes of Health (NIH) ‘‘to delete gene se-
quences of early COVID–19 cases from a key 
scientific database,’’ called the NIH Se-
quence Read Archive. The article states that 
NIH confirmed that it deleted the sequences. 
The article further reports that the deleted 
data 
includes 
genomic 
sequences 
from 
SARS–Co V–2 and that these sequences were 
from viral samples collected in Wuhan ‘‘in 
January and February 2020’’ from patients in 
the hospital. 
This type of data may contain important 
and relevant information that could help to 
better determine the virus’s origins. The ef-
forts by Chinese researchers to delete the 
data demands additional explanation. As you 
are aware, the Chinese government has 
failed, from the beginning, to be open and 
transparent with the world with respect to 
its role in the pandemic. 
The COVID–19 pandemic has resulted in 
more than 600,000 deaths, and Congress has 
spent trillions of dollars to support the 
American people, businesses, and the econ-
omy during these difficult times. Simply 
put, the American people deserve to know 
what their government knows about the ori-
gins of this global illness. As part of our con-
tinuing oversight with respect to NIH’s role 
during the COVID–19 pandemic, we request 
additional information about the NIH Se-
quence Read Archive and the actions taken 
by Chinese researchers to have NIH delete 
SARS–CoV–2 
related 
data. 
Accordingly, 
please answer the following no later than 
July 12, 2021: 
1. Please describe, in detail, how and under 
what circumstances data can be provided to 
the NIH Sequence Read Archive and how and 
under what circumstances data can be de-
leted from the same. 
2. With respect to deleting data from the 
NIH Sequence Archive, please name all per-
sonnel that have the authority to do so. In 
your answer, please provide the names and 
titles of the personnel that were involved in 
the deletion of SARS–Co V–2 data. 
3. With respect to the Wall Street Journal 
report, 
which 
Chinese 
researcher(s) 
re-
quested that the data be deleted from the 
NIH Sequence Read Archive? When was the 
request made and when did the deletion 
occur? 
4. After deletion, does the NIH Sequence 
Read Archive maintain any accessible back- 
up of the deleted data? If so, please provide 
all records to us. 
5. Please list all collaborating partners to 
the NIH Sequence Read Archive. 
6. In the past five years, how many re-
searchers and other personnel associated 
with the communist Chinese government 
have requested that data be deleted from the 
NIH Sequence Read Archive? Please list by 
requestor, date, reason, and the information 
to be deleted. Please also note whether and 
when that material was in fact deleted. 
7. More specifically, in the past five years, 
how many researchers and other personnel 
associated with the communist Chinese gov-
ernment have requested that data be deleted 
from the NIH Sequence Read Archive relat-
ing to coronaviruses? Please list by re-
questor, date, reason, and the information to 
be deleted. Please also note whether and 
when that material was in fact deleted. 
Thank you for your attention to this im-
portant matter. 
Sincerely, 
MARSHA BLACKBURN, 
U.S. Senator. 
ROGER MARSHALL, 
U.S. Senator. 
CHARLES E. GRASSLEY, 
U.S. Senator. 
Mrs. BLACKBURN. Madam Presi-
dent, this letter asked Dr. Collins 
about news reports that Chinese re-
searchers were allowed to delete data 
from a genetic database managed by 
the NIH. The data they removed in-
cluded information about the novel 
coronavirus that caused the COVID–19 
pandemic. 
Dr. Collins has not responded to the 
letter, but this isn’t the sort of allega-
tion the NIH will be able to ignore into 
nonexistence. We need a response. We 
need to know what happened. We need 
transparency from the NIH, just as the 
NIH is asking for transparency from 
China. 
Dr. Collins must reveal what defini-
tion of ‘‘gain of function research’’ NIH 
used when it approved funding for the 
Wuhan Institute of Virology back in 
2016. We now know that the research 
we paid for helped Chinese researchers 
engineer 
different 
versions 
of 
coronaviruses. 
We also need to know why the Wuhan 
Institute of Virology was allowed to do 
dangerous research with American tax-
payer dollars in a ‘‘biosafety level 2’’ 
lab. In case you are not familiar with 
this designation, one scientist com-
pared the safety and security levels of 
a biosafety lab 2 to that of a dentist’s 
office. 
In 2017, NIH reversed the ban on gain 
of function research. Why was NIH al-
lowed to make such an important deci-
sion unilaterally? 
I was relieved to hear Dr. Collins ex-
press support for transparency from 
China, but getting answers out of Bei-
jing won’t end the investigation. The 
American people have suffered for al-
most 2 years under the threat of illness 
and economic collapse. It is not too 
much to demand that their own gov-
ernment live up to the same standards 
we all agree we should hold our re-
search partners to.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S6073 
August 9, 2021 
H.R. 3684 
Tennesseans want answers from the 
NIH. They are also still reeling over 
the price tag of this infrastructure bill. 
Over the past few days, I have gotten a 
lot of calls and text messages from peo-
ple back home. I stood right here and I 
have spoken about how Tennesseans 
are confused about this process. I want 
to amplify something for those who 
may not have caught my remarks. 
Tennesseans aren’t talking about 
process or pay-fors. They don’t follow 
the Senate rules. What they are con-
fused about is why my Democratic col-
leagues are in such a rush to spend 
money we do not have on projects the 
American people never asked for. 
I don’t want my Democratic col-
leagues to make a mistake and accuse 
Tennesseans of not caring about infra-
structure. They couldn’t be further 
from the truth on that one. Tennessee 
is a logistics State. We are roads, 
bridges, rivers, runways, railways. So 
believe me when I say Tennesseans 
care about infrastructure. They are 
ready to invest in infrastructure. In-
deed, the surface transportation bill we 
passed out of Commerce, Science, and 
Transportation—they like that. But 
cobbling together a trillion-dollar vehi-
cle for campaign promises and calling 
it infrastructure is not something that 
passes muster with them. 
Several of my Republican colleagues 
who were allowed to negotiate this bill 
have emphasized that this is a bipar-
tisan compromise. We thank them for 
their efforts. They want us to under-
stand that it is not a perfect bill. No 
bill is ever perfect. All of that is true. 
We understand that. We appreciate the 
efforts that have gone into this. But, as 
my colleague from Kansas said, it is 
not the compromise that is the prob-
lem. It is not the efforts; we appreciate 
those. It is the fact that this is a bill 
that is too expensive to afford. 
The minority leader said it best a few 
months ago when he compared this bill 
to a Trojan horse. It looks like one 
thing, but it is hiding something you 
don’t want getting past the front door. 
For months, the Democratic Party 
has been very public about their inten-
tions for the bill. The word ‘‘infrastruc-
ture’’ no longer has any meaning when 
it comes out of their mouths because 
everything has been infrastructure at 
some point—childcare for a while until 
it took a back seat to court-packing. 
Now climate action is infrastructure. 
Back home, we deal in truth and con-
sequences. Tennesseans have spent the 
past few days looking at everything 
hunkered down inside this package, 
and they know it is not all about infra-
structure investment. I am talking to 
county mayors. I am talking to State 
reps. I am talking to State senators. 
They are concerned about 5 percent of 
the bill for infrastructure and the rest, 
other projects. 
I have spoken numerous times about 
the ways President Biden and his faith-
ful lieutenants in Congress have tried 
to diminish freedom in the name of 
progress, but I am compelled to remind 
my colleagues once again that the de-
cision to increase government spending 
is a decision to increase government 
involvement and eventually govern-
ment control. You cannot have the one 
without getting the other too. 
This isn’t investing in the future. If 
anything, this pattern of reckless 
spending will ensure that the version of 
the American dream so many of us 
have enjoyed disappears before our 
youngest generations are old enough to 
sign the dotted line on their driver’s li-
cense application. Our Democratic col-
leagues aren’t paving the way to pros-
perity for our children and grand-
children with this type of spending; 
they are building the gateway to so-
cialism, and this bill can be seen as a 
down payment. 
Later this week, if all goes according 
to plan for my colleague from New 
York, we will take a vote on a budget 
that is going to make the American 
people think they got a discount on the 
infrastructure package. It is another 
day, another fight over a multitrillion- 
dollar spending spree that defies com-
mon sense and rejects all notions of ac-
countability. 
If the infrastructure bill was the 
down payment for that gateway to so-
cialism, this budget rips the gates off 
the hinges and invites the big spenders 
and central planners to roll right on 
through. For the low price of $3.5 tril-
lion, they will have it all: a laundry 
list of incentives for government de-
pendency, a foot in the door to our 
homes and families, and an excuse to 
seize power and centralize it right here 
in Washington. 
My 
Democratic 
colleagues 
really 
enjoy using the words ‘‘free’’ and ‘‘uni-
versal’’ to describe their government 
handouts. We have universal pre-K, tui-
tion-free community college, universal 
healthcare, and even a free path to citi-
zenship for illegal immigrants. 
The American people see this for 
what it is, though. It is bait. In ex-
change for your freedom and your au-
tonomy and all your hopes and dreams, 
you, too, can become a client of the 
State. You, too, can live ‘‘The Life of 
Julia,’’ as depicted in the roundly 
panned cartoon the Obama administra-
tion created. The left always signals 
where they are headed, and, for them, 
this is their goal, their utopia—total 
control from daylight to dark, 24 hours 
a day, 7 days a week, for the rest of 
your life. 
Our public debt is set to hit $45 tril-
lion by 2031—$45 trillion. Deficits are 
on track to hit $1.8 trillion—yes, in-
deed, that is every year—and no budget 
gimmick on the books can change that. 
President Reagan’s warning about the 
fragile nature of freedom rings espe-
cially true after hearing those num-
bers. 
Here is what he said: 
[F]reedom is never more than one genera-
tion away from extinction . . . It [has to] be 
fought for and defended by each generation. 
What does that mean? 
It means we—each of us, individ-
ually, 
collectively, 
together—has 
a 
duty to future generations to pull out 
of this skid before we tip the scales 
away from freedom and toward levels 
of government dependency and control 
you can’t unravel after fixing a 4-year 
mistake. 
I yield the floor. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
BLUMENTHAL). The Senator from Wash-
ington. 
Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, you 
know, when a disaster strikes—a tor-
nado or an earthquake or a wildfire— 
the first thing we do is work to keep 
people safe, but that is far from the 
last thing we do. When the storm has 
passed, we rebuild. We rebuild homes 
and schools, hospitals, businesses, com-
munities; and, if we are doing our job 
right, we build them back even better 
so we are ready when the next crisis 
strikes. That is exactly what this budg-
et is about—rebuilding our country 
now stronger and fairer. 
We need to pick up where the infra-
structure package leaves off by making 
bold investments in all of our infra-
structure. In addition to building roads 
and bridges and even broadband, we 
need to build our public health infra-
structure and help our local health de-
partments expand their capacity and 
modernize their data and lab systems 
and more. 
We need to build our affordable hous-
ing infrastructure to make sure every 
family can keep a roof over their head, 
and it doesn’t need to break the bank 
to do so. 
We need to build our school infra-
structure to make sure schools don’t 
have lead pipes or mold and do have 
adequate lighting and electricity and 
AC systems, not to mention so many 
other resources students need to learn 
and grow, like libraries and gyms. 
And we need to build our climate in-
frastructure. The climate crisis is here, 
and it is an existential threat. If we 
don’t take this opportunity to protect 
our planet for current and future gen-
erations, we may not get another one. 
Of course, rebuilding is about more 
than just infrastructure. We have to 
build a stronger, fairer country for our 
workers and our families too. Our Na-
tion is stronger when no worker has to 
choose between a paycheck and taking 
care of themselves, a child, or a loved 
one who is seriously ill; and every 
worker can afford to take time off after 
giving birth, a partner’s delivery, or 
adopting a child, which is why we must 
establish a national paid leave plan. 
Our Nation is stronger when every 
parent can get quality, affordable 
childcare; every young learner gets a 
strong start with quality early learn-
ing programs; and every adult learner 
can pursue a higher education, which is 
why we need to expand quality, afford-
able childcare and establish universal 
pre-K, and why we need to open the 
doors of higher education to even more 
people, starting by providing tuition- 
free community college.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S6074 
August 9, 2021 
Our Nation is stronger when older 
Americans and people with disabilities 
have the care they need to live inde-
pendently in their communities, which 
is why we need to invest in home- and 
community-based services and make 
sure the workers who provide that crit-
ical care get fair pay and better bene-
fits. 
Our 
Nation 
is 
stronger 
when 
healthcare is truly a right and not a 
privilege, which is why we need to ex-
tend the huge healthcare expansion we 
made in the American Rescue Plan, 
which has already helped 138,000 people 
in my home State of Washington save 
an average of $90 on their healthcare 
coverage, and we need to keep pressing 
for further progress toward universal 
coverage. 
And, of course, our Nation is stronger 
because of the contributions of so 
many hard-working immigrants, which 
is why we need a fair pathway to citi-
zenship for the more than 11 million 
undocumented residents living here, in-
cluding Dreamers, farmworkers, those 
with temporary protected status, and 
the 
many 
essential 
undocumented 
workers who do so much to keep our 
country running. 
You know, after a wildfire, would we 
leave the fire department in ashes, or 
the schools or the businesses or the 
homes? 
Of course not. 
So, after a pandemic and an eco-
nomic crisis, shouldn’t we rebuild our 
public health departments? Shouldn’t 
we rebuild our economy? Shouldn’t we 
address the deep-seated inequities that 
have made things so much worse for so 
many people? Shouldn’t we help fami-
lies get childcare and paid leave and 
healthcare and housing and citizen-
ship? Shouldn’t we build back our Na-
tion stronger and fairer? 
That is not a trick question, and it 
shouldn’t be a hard one either. The an-
swer is obvious to anyone who has been 
listening to people back home. 
Democrats are listening. We know 
what families are going through. We 
know they want us to act, and that is 
exactly what we are going to do. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Idaho. 
Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, I rise to 
speak about the devastating tax-and- 
spend policies we will shortly be debat-
ing here. 
First, I want to differentiate between 
the bipartisan infrastructure legisla-
tion we are currently debating and the 
separate, looming debate on my Demo-
cratic colleagues’ $3.5 trillion reckless 
tax-and-spend proposals. 
Senators on both sides of the aisle 
have long agreed to the need to mod-
ernize and expand our hard infrastruc-
ture, including transportation systems 
and broadband networks. We have done 
so in a bipartisan manner. Infrastruc-
ture investments have traditionally 
been accomplished through bipartisan-
ship and regular order. Traditional 
hard infrastructure investments in-
clude the funding of roads and bridges, 
transit, rail, airports, drinking water, 
and wastewater infrastructure, ports 
and inland waterways, water storage, 
and broadband infrastructure. 
The bipartisan infrastructure bill we 
are considering today focuses on those 
core elements and is built around sev-
eral vetted, unanimously consented 
committee-passed bills. It includes a 
number of priorities important to 
Idaho, including billions of dollars for 
roads, highways, and bridges; funding 
for high-speed internet and broadband 
infrastructure deployment; millions in 
water 
infrastructure, 
including 
for 
groundwater storage and conveyance; 
funding for resiliency against natural 
disasters, like wildfires and droughts; a 
reauthorization of the Secure Rural 
Schools program; and much more. 
It does not raise taxes. 
It reprioritizes the use of certain un-
used COVID relief funds from previous 
spending bills away from bailouts and 
idle funds and toward supply-side in-
vestments that will provide benefits to 
the American people for many years. 
Because this infrastructure spending 
focuses on long-term productivity rath-
er than near-term demand, it will not 
be inflationary. In fact, it will counter-
act the inflationary pressures we are 
now seeing as a result of the excessive 
spending in this Congress. This is espe-
cially critical right now, as rising 
prices are impacting families and small 
businesses across America. 
In June, the Bureau of Labor Statis-
tics reported that consumer prices 
were up 5.4 percent over 1 year ago— 
the largest increase since August 2008. 
Consumer price inflation has been ac-
celerating since the beginning of the 
year, and American families pay the 
price. In the past year, gas prices have 
increased 45.1 percent. The cost for 
major appliances has increased 13.7 per-
cent. Airfares have increased 24.6 per-
cent, and the list goes on. 
A recent University of Michigan sur-
vey showed that consumers expect 
prices to rise 4.8 percent over the next 
12 months, and a National Federation 
of Independent Business survey found 
that 47 percent of companies are in-
creasing average selling prices, up 7 
percentage points from May and the 
highest share in four decades. 
Economists on both sides of the aisle 
have warned that excessive, nonproduc-
tive spending could put us in this posi-
tion. 
And 
despite 
these 
warnings, 
in 
March, the Democrats passed nearly $2 
trillion in purported COVID relief 
spending on top of the nearly $4 trillion 
that had already been spent. A fraction 
of this $2 trillion was actually pan-
demic-related. 
That poorly targeted package has 
grown the national debt, spurred infla-
tion, and discouraged workers from re-
turning to the workforce. Now Demo-
crats are proposing to spend an addi-
tional $3.5 trillion to balloon the Fed-
eral Government even more, and that 
is just the advertised price. 
According to the nonpartisan Com-
mittee for a Responsible Federal Budg-
et, the Democrats’ new legislation will 
actually cost closer to $5 to $5.5 trillion 
over the next 10 years. Democrats in-
tend to couple this runaway spending 
with job- and growth-killing tax hikes 
to create and establish their reckless 
spree of tax-and-spend policies. They 
intend to go it alone with this social 
spending spree through another budget 
reconciliation process in a 50–50-tied 
Senate, which is willfully partisan. 
Yet, amazingly, despite having the 
tools to raise the debt limit within this 
process, Democrats want to ignore the 
debt implications of their reckless 
budget. If the Democrats are going to 
cram down this massive tax-and-spend-
ing spree, they will have to deal with 
the debt limit themselves. Yet they 
don’t include dealing with their irre-
sponsible growth of our debt in their 
bill. 
What about offset proposals? 
The Democrats’ budget proposals in-
clude provisions that will cause imme-
diate and long-term damage to our 
economy and send many of our most 
successful 
businesses—and 
the 
jobs 
they provide—abroad. 
One, they propose increasing taxes on 
all kinds of businesses, large and small, 
leading to lower wages, fewer jobs, and 
higher prices for consumers. 
Two, they would allow and encourage 
rival countries to change the inter-
national tax system for the worse. 
Three, they want to raise our taxes 
on our businesses in hopes that other 
countries may raise theirs sometime in 
the indefinite future, while ceding U.S. 
taxing rights to our competitors today. 
Four, they propose enacting a double 
death tax, particularly harmful for 
family farms and small businesses. 
Five, they want to substantially in-
crease 
taxes 
on 
investors, 
entre-
preneurs, savers, and retirees. 
Six, they want to drastically expand 
the powers of the IRS, while limiting 
its accountability, and turn banks into 
private investigators for monitoring 
law-abiding Americans. 
Seven, their ideas will raise taxes on 
middle-class individuals and families, 
and 
not 
just 
those 
earning 
over 
$400,000. 
At the very same time, they want tax 
relief for some of the wealthy living in 
the high tax-and-spend States. 
And, finally, they are also seeking to 
impose government price controls on 
the pharmaceutical industry that will 
stifle medical innovation. 
Let’s go back into a little detail on 
this. 
Business taxes. The Democrats plan 
to hike the tax rate paid by all types of 
businesses, including corporations, ig-
noring the fact that a significant por-
tion of the tax burden is paid by work-
ers. As the U.S. Chamber of Commerce 
notes, most corporations are small 
businesses, with 84 percent of them 
having fewer than 20 employees. As to 
those who actually bear the burden of 
a corporate tax increase, estimates say

S6075 
August 9, 2021 
that workers share anywhere from 20 
to more than 70 percent of this burden. 
A higher corporate tax rate would hit 
the nest eggs of everyone saving for re-
tirement. This stealthy but very real 
tax hike would hit retirement savers 
across the spectrum, falling most heav-
ily on the middle class and the elderly 
through retirement accounts and pen-
sions, and clearly violating President 
Biden’s pledge not to tax anyone mak-
ing less than 400,000. 
Any business tax increase will di-
rectly hit the very small businesses 
and workers that the administration 
claims it wants to help. 
International taxes. The Democrats’ 
tax plan would reverse the smart poli-
cies of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act 
adopted in 2017, once again raising the 
relative cost of doing business in Amer-
ica and punishing American businesses 
selling their products or services over-
seas. They fail to acknowledge that the 
tax increases in their plan will rocket 
the United States back into the outlier 
position it once occupied compared to 
peer nations. Once again, we will have 
the highest tax rates of the developed 
world. We are very near the top. The 
Democrats are intent on winning a 
race to get to the top of the heap in 
terms of international corporate tax 
rates. 
Their 
international 
tax 
proposal 
would more than double the minimum 
rate paid by U.S. businesses on their 
foreign earnings to 26.25 percent. This 
hike far outstrips the 15 percent min-
imum rate promised by some of our 
largest international competitors at 
the OECD. If the administration wants 
to promote economic growth that will 
benefit American workers and savers, 
why is it sharply increasing taxes on 
its global businesses when no other 
country even levies such taxes? 
The administration’s international 
tax proposals seem designed to reignite 
the job-crushing inversions and foreign 
acquisitions of American companies 
that the Obama administration faced. 
There is no reason to tax our busi-
nesses into moving abroad, as the 
Democrats’ proposals will do. 
Family farms and small businesses. 
Today, family businesses passed down 
at death are subject only to estate tax 
and not an additional income tax. In-
stead, a business’s tax basis is in-
creased or stepped up to fair market 
value, sparing the next generation a 
large capital gains tax bill. President 
Biden wants to create a double death 
tax by eliminating the benefits of this 
step-up in basis, including for small 
businesses, farms, and ranches passed 
down from one generation to the next 
at death. 
More insidiously, the Biden plan 
would tax these businesses on simple 
inflation, sticking them with a bill for 
reckless, 
inflationary 
tax-and-spend 
policies enacted by politicians in Wash-
ington. 
Capital gains tax. For decades, the 
Republicans and Democrats have rec-
ognized the importance of encouraging 
people to save for their future goals, 
including starting a business, saving 
for 
retirement, 
achieving 
financial 
independence, or even buying a home 
or a car. 
Members of both parties have long 
agreed on a key tool to encourage 
these goals for all Americans, specifi-
cally, a lower tax rate on long-term 
capital gains. 
President Biden wants to nearly dou-
ble this tax rate from 23.8 percent to 
43.4 percent, which will be the highest 
rate—and hear me on this: the highest 
rate—in a century. In many cases, 
when combined with similar State 
taxes, the government would take 
more than half of an asset’s apprecia-
tion in taxes. This is the appreciation 
that lower income, middle-income, and 
all income categories of workers and 
earners in the United States will have 
to pay. This supersized tax hike would 
be a powerful disincentive to small 
businesses, savers and retirees, and en-
trepreneurs and innovators who power 
our economy, and harm all Americans, 
regardless 
of 
their 
financial 
cir-
cumstances or goals. 
IRS funding and bank monitoring. 
The Biden administration has proposed 
nearly $80 billion in additional IRS 
funding, of which $72.5 billion would be 
accountability-hindering 
mandatory 
spending. Nearly doubling the IRS’ 
budget without increasing its account-
ability opens the door to repeating and 
supercharging the Agency’s past abuses 
of power. 
Further, the administration’s pro-
posal would press financial institu-
tions—private-sector financial institu-
tions—into reporting the deposit and 
withdrawal flows on their customer’s 
accounts of greater than $600 in value. 
Now, think about that. This isn’t big 
corporations. It is not even just cor-
porations. It is small businesses and in-
dividuals that have a financial account 
that has more than $600 in it. And what 
we are going to see is a dragnet pulling 
law-abiding Americans into this, expos-
ing sensitive data to future breaches, 
burdening financial institutions, and 
encouraging the growth of shadow 
banking—what a huge violation of the 
privacy of all Americans. As if this pro-
posal could not be worse, the data pro-
vided to the IRS would have almost no 
value in fighting tax evasion. 
The era of big data should not be 
viewed as an opportunity for Big 
Brother. 
The SALT deduction cap. While my 
colleagues 
are 
proposing 
reckless, 
across-the-board tax increases on busi-
nesses and families, they are simulta-
neously proposing to expand a tax de-
duction for the wealthiest—those liv-
ing in high-tax States. Democrats are 
fighting to reverse the cap on State 
and local taxes, or what is called the 
SALT tax—these deductions—stoking a 
tax break for the very wealthy. 
Democratic silence on who benefits 
from their proposal is telling. Per a 
2020 Brookings Institute study, 96 per-
cent of its benefits would go to the top 
quintile of earners, 57 percent would go 
to the top 1 percent of earners, and 25 
percent to the top one-tenth of 1 per-
cent of earners—a huge tax break for 
the wealthy. 
And, finally, price controls on phar-
maceutical manufacturers. Thanks to 
the genius of science, private-sector in-
novation, and the success of Operation 
Warp Speed, America is ready for its 
comeback. Unfortunately, my Demo-
crat colleagues are proposing sweeping 
governmental price controls on the 
very innovators who have enabled our 
return to normalcy. Under the guise of 
negotiation, the government would be 
empowered to set a maximum fair 
price for drugs and apply bureaucratic 
standards that determine the value 
that cures and therapies bring to 
American lives. 
As the nonpartisan Congressional 
Budget Office has confirmed, this type 
of scheme will lead to fewer new medi-
cations, threatening access to life-
saving healthcare options for our most 
vulnerable citizens. One of these for-
gone therapies could treat pancreatic 
cancer; another could cure ALS. While 
every patient should be able to afford 
lifesaving medications, their proposal 
has the potential to eliminate the ex-
istence of these very inventions and in-
novations. 
Congress should come together in a 
bipartisan way to make all healthcare 
services, including prescription drugs, 
more affordable and accessible, and I 
have introduced legislation to do just 
that. We do need to reduce the cost of 
prescription drugs, but using the sav-
ings from this misguided government 
price control scheme to pay for unre-
lated partisan priorities is not the an-
swer to the high cost of healthcare. 
Before the pandemic, a combination 
of reduced regulatory burden and pro- 
growth policies, including the 2017 Tax 
Cuts and Jobs Act, helped to create one 
of the strongest economies of our life-
time, with all-time high median house-
hold income, a 50-year low unemploy-
ment rate, and real wage gains month 
after month, especially and most for 
the low-income workers. Inflation-ad-
justed weekly median earnings grew 4.9 
percent for the 2 years between 2018 
and 2019—the fastest 2-year growth rate 
in real earnings since 1998 and 1999. 
Polling showed Americans’ general 
satisfaction at the highest level in 15 
years. 
We would do the American people a 
disservice if we mortgaged their future 
while undermining the foundations of 
their past successes, and, sadly, this is 
the approach that many of my col-
leagues are seeking to take as we move 
into the next step of this debate. 
We should, instead, be building on 
time-proven, pro-growth policies, not 
reversing them to fund a reckless 
spending spree. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from New York. 
Mrs. GILLIBRAND. Mr. President, I 
rise to join my colleagues in support of 
the Build Back Better plan budget res-
olution, which recognizes that care in-
frastructure is critical infrastructure.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S6076 
August 9, 2021 
We know that our economy has not 
been working for working families. 
Then, we saw a pandemic make a pre-
carious situation even worse for fami-
lies across the entire country. 
Our economy cannot fully recover 
and will not survive another pandemic 
or health emergency if people can’t 
keep their jobs or get back to work. 
That won’t happen until we start pro-
viding the economic support that we 
have actually needed for decades—sup-
port like childcare, universal pre-K, 
and universal paid leave. 
Paid leave is what allows people to 
keep their jobs when they get sick. It 
allows parents to stay home with chil-
dren who are ill or forced to learn re-
motely. It lets hard-working people 
care for their aging parents. And, right 
now, far too many people don’t have 
access to it. More than 8 in 10 workers 
lack access to paid leave, and they are 
often left to make the very impossible 
choices of: Do I care for my loved one? 
Do I stay by the bedside of my mother 
as she is dying or do I earn a paycheck 
and feed my children? 
Those are choices that we shouldn’t 
be forcing the American workforce to 
have to make every single day. 
So this budget reconciliation will 
help end the United States’ reign of 
being the only industrialized country 
in the world that doesn’t have access 
to paid family and medical leave for all 
workers. 
I have been fighting alongside Con-
gresswoman ROSA DELAURO for years 
to pass the bill. Our bill is called the 
FAMILY Act, the model for the Build 
Back Better plan’s paid leave program, 
which 
would 
provide 
every—nearly 
every worker with up to 12 weeks of 
paid leave. It will provide stability to 
workers, to families, to companies, and 
to our U.S. economy. 
Now, this is the moment that we can 
actually make it happen. This budget 
also recognizes the essential nature of 
the childcare industry. Nearly 27 mil-
lion people rely on childcare just so 
they can go to work and feed their chil-
dren. 
First, childcare is not readily avail-
able. Childcare deserts and shortages 
across the country leave families with-
out local options. Before the pandemic 
in New York, there was one slot for 
every four children who wanted access 
to affordable, high-quality daycare. 
After the pandemic, there was one slot 
for every eight children who wanted ac-
cess to affordable, quality daycare. In 
New York, a year of childcare is often 
more expensive than a year of in-State 
college tuition. 
Those problems were exacerbated by 
the pandemic. Staffing at childcare 
centers, which was already a problem 
pre-pandemic, is now down 15 percent. 
This budget will help us make the crit-
ical investments that are so long over-
due. Childcare investments ensure fam-
ilies have access to high-quality care 
that cost low- and middle-income fami-
lies no more than 7 percent of their in-
come. 
It also recognizes the nature of 
childcare as essential work. Childcare 
providers are essential workers, and 
they deserve a long overdue raise. This 
investment is critical to our economic 
recovery and will help working parents 
get back to the office, get back to their 
jobs and know that their children are 
safe and having access to that critical 
early childhood education. 
Every parent in America knows that 
if their child has the chance from 0 to 
5 to be in early childhood education, 
every dollar you put into early child-
hood education results in over $11 of 
benefit to society for that individual 
child over their lifetime. It is such an 
important investment. 
The Build Back Better plan invests 
in universal pre-K. It will not only help 
more parents of young children return 
to work, but it also ensures that those 
children get that early access to early 
childhood education, that high-quality 
learning gives them access to under-
standing their numbers, their letters, 
early reading, early math that is essen-
tial for them being able to thrive. 
These forms of care infrastructure 
are what make the difference between 
a family surviving or a family thriving, 
and that is what this country needs to 
actually recover from this global pan-
demic. 
These investments are just as impor-
tant as our investments in roads and 
bridges and sewers and clean water and 
clean air and high-speed rail and rural 
broadband. All of that matters and, to-
gether, that is how we recover from 
this economy. This is the moment to 
make this once-in-a-generation invest-
ment in the future of our families, the 
future of our middle class, the future of 
our economy, and this is something 
that we can do together. 
So I ask all of my colleagues to join 
us in getting the Build Back Better 
plan over the finish line. It is about our 
families; it is about our economy; and, 
most importantly, it is about our fu-
ture. 
I yield the floor. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Ms. 
HIRONO). The Senator from Maine. 
H.R. 3684 
Ms. COLLINS. Madam President, at 
long last, tomorrow morning, I expect 
that the Senate will approve the bipar-
tisan Infrastructure Investment and 
Jobs Act. 
For far too long, any discussion of 
transportation infrastructure in this 
country has been accompanied by the 
adjective ‘‘crumbling.’’ The backlog of 
needed repairs and upgrades and re-
placements in my State of Maine and 
throughout our country is simply enor-
mous. 
Americans know far too well the con-
sequences of the chronic underinvest-
ment in our infrastructure. Poor road 
conditions cost them, on average, hun-
dreds of dollars each year in vehicle re-
pairs and wasted gasoline due to con-
gestion. Structurally deficient bridges 
often require lengthy detours when 
they have to be posted. Slow or non-
existent internet connections create 
barriers to work, healthcare and edu-
cation. 
The recent pandemic has certainly 
laid bare inequities to high-speed inter-
net in our country. Every administra-
tion in recent memory has identified 
improving 
our 
infrastructure 
and 
transportation networks as a priority, 
but time and time again we have seen 
those ambitious goals thwarted by par-
tisanship. 
Well, the Senate has finally broken 
through the political gridlock and is on 
the merge of passing a landmark infra-
structure package that amounts to a 
major victory for the American people. 
I worked with my colleagues from 
across the aisle and across the country 
to produce this legislation. It will be 
the most significant investment in 
American infrastructure since the es-
tablishment of the Interstate Highway 
System in the 1950s. 
This bill will provide concrete bene-
fits for American families, as well as 
for our economy, by making historic 
investments in our Nation’s roads; 
highways; bridges; airports; seaports; 
waterways; rail; water treatment sys-
tems; and, of course, broadband. 
This is important not only for Amer-
ican families; it is important for Amer-
ica’s place in the world. Many other 
countries on a per-capita basis invest 
far more than our country does in in-
frastructure, including China. So this 
bill will help to improve our competi-
tiveness, create jobs, and improve our 
productivity. It represents the cul-
mination of months of bipartisan nego-
tiations and truly is transformational. 
For example, the package includes 
$110 billion to address the growing 
backlog of deficient bridges and roads. 
This includes $40 billion to improve our 
Nation’s bridges. In my State of Maine, 
there are 315 deficient bridges and 
nearly 1,500 miles of poor roads. 
This package provides $25 billion, as 
well as the flexibility, for our airports 
so that they can pursue the projects 
such as rebuilding or extending run-
ways and taxiways or expanding their 
terminals. This funding will benefit 
airports of all sizes. 
The package also bolsters our rail 
network by including funding for pro-
grams that support crucial capital and 
rail safety projects. We also included 
funding for Amtrak’s National Net-
work to help address its deferred cap-
ital needs and to bring new train cars 
to State-supported routes, like the 
Downeaster in Maine. 
I am also excited that the bill pro-
vides an additional $95 million to sup-
port the University Transportation 
Centers program. This program har-
nesses the research and development 
expertise at our institutions of higher 
education to improve our infrastruc-
ture. The University of Maine, I am 
proud to say, participates in this pro-
gram. It is leading the way by pio-
neering cutting-edge materials to build 
more durable, environmentally friend-
ly roads and bridges at a lower cost.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S6077 
August 9, 2021 
I recently participated in a bridge 
dedication that used the new materials 
and techniques that had been developed 
at the University of Maine. This bridge 
will last far longer. Because of the ma-
terials that were used to build it, it has 
a far lower carbon footprint and is a 
really exciting development. This pro-
gram will be better supported by the 
funding in our bill. 
The energy title of our bill will pro-
vide critical investments in clean en-
ergy demonstration projects and help 
to protect and harden our electric grid. 
Notably, $355 million is included for an 
energy storage pilot program, which 
was authorized through a law I au-
thored known as the BEST Act. 
I am really excited about this be-
cause I believe that energy storage 
technology will be the breakthrough 
that we need in the fight against cli-
mate change as far as allowing us to 
integrate new renewables, such as wind 
and solar, into the electric grid. That 
will, in turn, help to reduce emissions, 
but it will also improve the resiliency 
of our electric grid. 
The funding for coastal resiliency in-
cluded in this bill will help protect our 
Nation’s coastline and coastal commu-
nities from rising sea levels, including 
those in the State of Maine. There is 
funding that is included for NOAA’s 
Coastal Resilience Fund to help miti-
gate the impact of storms on our com-
munities and lessen flooding that has 
been so devastating in many areas of 
the country. 
To further address the infrastructure 
needs for our ports and waterways, $7 
billion is included for the Army Corps 
of Engineers to address the large back-
log of authorized projects that have yet 
to receive funding. There is also $2.25 
billion for the Port Infrastructure De-
velopment Program. 
Maintaining access to clean, reliable 
drinking water is essential to pro-
tecting the health of our public, our 
environment, our families, our econ-
omy. Our agreement includes invest-
ments in drinking water and waste-
water infrastructure. 
Although Maine is home to some of 
the cleanest sources of water in the 
country, the increasing and troubling 
prevalence of pollutants, like PFAS 
chemicals—the so-called forever chemi-
cals—require action to keep our drink-
ing water safe. 
There has been contamination in 
Maine in both public and private water 
systems from PFAS. That is why I 
worked so hard with Senator SHAHEEN 
of New Hampshire to provide funding 
to help clean up this source of pollu-
tion. 
Finally—and, in my view, one of the 
most important features of this bill—is 
the broadband investment. I want to 
reiterate the significance of our his-
toric 
$65 
billion 
investment 
in 
broadband. 
Senator SHAHEEN and I worked, lit-
erally, night and day to negotiate this 
section with our colleagues here in the 
Senate and with the administration, 
particularly Secretary Raimondo at 
the Department of Commerce. 
This will make a real difference in 
the lives of Americans, particularly 
those living in rural areas who do not 
have access to internet service at all in 
some areas or who have access only to 
unreliable, very slow service. 
It has become increasingly clear in 
recent years, and especially in light of 
the pandemic, that broadband is no 
longer a luxury; it is a necessity. And 
I can’t tell you how many people I have 
talked to in Maine about this problem. 
I talked to a selectman on Swan’s Is-
land, who was telling me that the resi-
dents of Swan’s Island were unable to 
participate in the telemedicine pro-
grams during the height of the COVID 
pandemic because they simply lacked 
access to high-speed internet. That is 
an example where healthcare is af-
fected. 
There were families in other rural 
areas of the State where schools had a 
hybrid system where families had to 
drive their children to the library to 
find a hotspot in order to connect with 
the internet for online education. One 
family in northern Maine told me it 
would cost them $15,000 to be connected 
to the internet. They can’t afford that. 
Most people in my State would be un-
able to afford $15,000 to be connected to 
the internet. I also talked to town 
managers who told me of employers 
who had decided to locate their busi-
nesses and employ people elsewhere be-
cause of the absence of high-speed, reli-
able internet service. 
This is why that $65 billion invest-
ment is so important and will have 
such an impact on people’s lives. We 
have both a deployment section and an 
affordability section, and both are a 
necessity. 
Ultimately, this bill is about rein-
forcing the connections that make our 
country more united. The investments 
in our roads and bridges will better 
connect our communities. The invest-
ments in our airports will better con-
nect rural and urban regions. The in-
vestments in our highways and sea-
ports will better connect manufactur-
ers and their customers and their 
workers. The investment in high-speed 
internet will better connect families, 
friends, 
coworkers, 
employers, 
healthcare providers, students, and 
educators. This investment package is 
good for America. It represents a far 
too rare example of the two parties 
working together to produce real re-
sults for the American people. 
I want to take just a final moment to 
thank those who were particularly in-
volved. I want to thank all of my col-
leagues for their contributions, but 
particularly I want to laud the work of 
Senator ROB
PORTMAN
and Senator 
KYRSTEN SINEMA, who led our group of 
10 Senators—5 Democrats, 5 Repub-
licans. The other Republican Members, 
in addition to myself, were Senators 
MURKOWSKI, CASSIDY, and ROMNEY. On 
the Democratic side, in addition to 
Senator 
SINEMA, 
were 
Senators 
MANCHIN, 
SHAHEEN, 
WARNER, 
and 
TESTER. All of us worked very hard, 
and we are grateful for the ideas and 
the input that we had from so many of 
our colleagues. 
I also want to thank our staffs. We 
couldn’t have done it without them. 
They, too, were here night and day. 
They haven’t had a weekend off in a 
very long time. 
It is essential that we make this his-
toric investment, and I urge all of my 
colleagues in voting tomorrow morning 
for final passage of this long-awaited, 
much needed, bipartisan legislation. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from California. 
CLIMATE CHANGE 
Mr. PADILLA. Madam President, I 
rise today because my home State of 
California is on fire. Nearly half a mil-
lion acres have burned in the last 
month by the Dixie Fire alone. That is 
more than 10 times the size of the Dis-
trict of Columbia. It is larger in size 
than the city of Los Angeles. Thou-
sands of Californians have been forced 
to flee their homes with only the 
clothes on their backs and the belong-
ings they can carry in their cars. En-
tire towns have burned to the ground. 
As of Sunday, Dixie is the largest sin-
gle-source fire in California’s history. 
California is not alone. The entire 
Western United States is on fire. 
Colleagues, this morning, the IPCC, 
the world’s foremost body of climate 
scientists, presented a new report. I am 
hoping you have seen it. There are 195 
countries, including the United States, 
that have agreed on every statement 
that it makes, and the verdict could 
not be clearer: Climate change is hap-
pening, and we must act now. 
As the report says, in more than 1,000 
centuries, the Earth has never seen a 
decade as hot as we have seen in the 
last 10 years. Scientists can show that 
particular disasters are fueled by cli-
mate change. The heat wave that is 
fueling fires, destroying crops, and 
sending areas across California into 
drought—that is on us. Devastating 
floods from Texas to Central Europe— 
those are on us. 
We have pushed our planet to this 
point, and if we continue to stall, the 
pace of recordbreaking catastrophe 
will only increase. This is planet 
Earth’s 10-alarm fire. Yet, my Repub-
lican colleagues pretend that they 
can’t see the smoke blowing across the 
country—smoke that is visible from 
space. 
But the good news is, we have a 
Democratic majority, and we know 
how to fight this fire. If we race to zero 
out our carbon emissions, we can slow 
the pace of climate change. We can 
even bring down temperatures by the 
middle of the century. But our path to 
avert a catastrophic cycle is narrowing 
by the day. We must act boldly and 
with urgency to tackle this crisis head- 
on.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S6078 
August 9, 2021 
Across the country, across industries, 
and across the world, we need to end 
our dependence on fossil fuels. We also 
need to aim high and fully fund trans-
formational infrastructure that will 
allow us not just to survive this transi-
tion but to come out better than we 
were 
before. 
On 
a 
zero-emissions 
schoolbus, students won’t have to 
breathe dirty air. In an economy re-
built to meet this challenge, millions 
of Americans will work in high-paying, 
sustainable jobs. 
Sometimes, I have worried that we 
have grown numb to the idea of the cli-
mate crisis. If we truly understood the 
meaning of those words, how could we 
even contemplate business as usual? If 
my colleagues across the aisle were to 
listen to scientists, how could a single 
one of them argue that we need to 
spend less on climate? 
As many of you know, my wife and I 
are raising three sons, trying to raise 
three gentleman. Today, they are age 
14, 8, and 6 years old. We are trying to 
get them ready to go back to school. 
Protecting them and giving them every 
opportunity to thrive is the cause of 
my lifetime. But the IPCC report 
makes clear that we will blow through 
the 1.5 degrees of global warming by 
the year 2040—it is right here—no mat-
ter what we do today. 
Come 2040, my sons will be ages 33, 27, 
and 25. I think about what their lives 
will be like at that stage—just starting 
their careers, maybe starting their own 
families. What will their adulthood 
look like? 
If we act now, we have a chance to 
turn the tide to begin the planet’s re-
covery as my children—my children— 
reach middle age. If we fail, they will 
face a world of accelerating disasters; 
up to 4 degrees of warming, the report 
says—4 degrees. 
Now, as an engineer, I understand 
how deadly serious it is to upset the 
delicate balance of our environment, 
but if 4 degrees does not sound signifi-
cant to you, just listen to the sci-
entists warning of what 4 degrees of 
warming will create: global conflict 
over food, water, and safe shelter; mil-
lions of climate refugees and desperate 
migrants. 
Failure is not an option. I refuse to 
tell my boys that we knew what to do 
but could not muster up the political 
will to act. I refuse to leave to them a 
world where their lives are defined by 
climate disaster and where they fear 
that every summer will bring the fire 
or drought or storm that consumes 
their home. I refuse to leave that world 
for my children or for anyone’s chil-
dren. That means time is of the es-
sence. 
Climate cannot be on the chopping 
block of any budget. It is nonnego-
tiable. So let’s rise to meet the chal-
lenge of our generation. We cannot, we 
will not let our home burn. 
BUDGET RECONCILIATION 
Madam President, on a different 
topic, I rise to speak today on the 
budget resolution that will soon come 
before us and the opportunity that it 
represents to finally provide a pathway 
to citizenship for millions of our neigh-
bors, friends, and family members. 
I rise today on behalf of the people 
who are the subject of our immigration 
debate and the immigrants who have 
lived 
and 
worked 
in 
communities 
throughout 
the 
United 
States 
for 
years, sometimes decades, while stuck 
in a limbo that Congress has created. 
Our Nation depends on the labor of 
immigrants. There has been bipartisan 
agreement on this for generations. But 
while our Nation depends on the labor 
of immigrants, we do not provide the 
pathways to citizenship that these in-
dividuals 
and 
their 
families 
have 
earned. Today, we stand on the brink 
of a historic opportunity to adopt long 
overdue reforms to our immigration 
system. 
I rise to share just a few stories of 
the people on whom our Nation de-
pends and for whom we must act. 
In May, I had the honor of welcoming 
Rose Tilus to testify before the Senate 
Judiciary Subcommittee on Immigra-
tion, Citizenship, and Border Safety, 
the Subcommittee which I chair. 
Rose was born in Haiti but fled gang 
violence and political instability at the 
age of 17. Alone, in an unfamiliar coun-
try, she dreamed of becoming a nurse, 
but Rose’s immigration status kept 
that dream out of reach. 
For 10 years, she sustained herself 
working as a housekeeper and as a 
babysitter to make ends meet. But 
Rose’s life changed in 2010, when a dev-
astating earthquake in Haiti allowed 
her to obtain a work permit under a 
program called temporary protected 
status, or TPS. 
Now, she seized this opportunity to 
return to school and fulfill her dream 
of becoming a nurse and going out to 
serve and care for others in nursing 
homes, in hospitals, in community 
health centers. 
Now, while Rose’s story is the story 
of the American dream, her legal sta-
tus in this country remains all too 
temporary. 
Our Nation’s economy has always de-
pended on the dreams, the dedication, 
and the contributions of immigrants. 
No State knows this better than my 
home State of California, which also 
represents the fifth largest economy in 
the world and which nearly a quarter 
of America’s immigrants call home. 
Immigrants make up 27 percent of 
California’s population, and, yes, they 
are essential to our success in every in-
dustry, from farm workers in the Cen-
tral Valley to tech innovators in the 
Silicon Valley, to construction and do-
mestic workers throughout the State, 
and to nurses and teachers, and more. 
In fact, the COVID–19 pandemic has 
made us a country that relies even 
more on the essential work of immi-
grants. More than 5 million undocu-
mented workers have held jobs that the 
Federal Government deems essential 
during the pandemic. 
TPS holders, like Rose, who care for 
our loved ones in hospitals and nursing 
homes; DACA recipients, like Erika 
Henriquez, a medical assistant who 
works helping to distribute COVID 
tests and lifesaving vaccines; farm 
workers, like Vicente Reyes and his 
parents, who show up to work every 
single 
day 
to 
keep 
grocery 
store 
shelves stocked and for us to be able to 
put food on our table—as has been the 
case since the founding of our Nation, 
immigrants are serving at the heart of 
the American story. 
An overwhelming bipartisan major-
ity knows that people like Rose, Erika, 
and Vicente have earned the right to 
live here without fear of deportation. 
Seventy percent of Americans support 
creating a pathway to citizenship for 
TPS holders, for Dreamers, and farm 
workers. That includes a majority of 
Democrats and Republicans and Inde-
pendents. 
Colleagues, right now, we have an op-
portunity to provide stability and secu-
rity for the very workforce that the 
Department of Homeland Security, be-
ginning during the Trump administra-
tion, has deemed essential to our Na-
tion’s economy and security. So as we 
write a reconciliation bill to create an 
equitable and sustainable economic re-
covery, we must include immigration 
reform. We have strong arguments and 
precedent from this very body in our 
corner. 
The logic is simple: Providing a path-
way to citizenship is a direct govern-
ment action, not some carrot-and-stick 
approach involving private businesses 
and private actors. 
Newly eligible immigrants would pay 
fees directly to the U.S. Government, 
as part of this direct government ac-
tion, which would then be processed by 
government employees. Every step of 
this process involves direct govern-
ment action and direct government 
revenues, expenditures, and personnel. 
And by expanding pathways to citi-
zenship, we will grow our economy and 
improve the workplaces for all. That is 
precisely the spirit and the intent of 
the infrastructure investments that we 
are developing as part of the budget 
reconciliation bill. 
Research by the Center for American 
Progress shows that providing a path-
way to citizenship for Dreamers, TPS 
holders, farm workers, and all essential 
workers will boost GDP by $1.5 trillion 
over 10 years. It will raise wages for all 
American workers. It will create 400,000 
new jobs, and it will generate billions 
of dollars of spending and tax revenue, 
fueling our economic recovery. 
We have more than just an oppor-
tunity; we have an obligation to pass 
meaningful immigration reform as part 
of the upcoming reconciliation bill—for 
Rose; for Erika; for Vicente; for the 
millions of essential workers and long- 
term residents who lack permanent 
status; for the bipartisan majority of 
Americans who support reform for 
their immigrant friends, families, and 
neighbors; and for every one of our con-
stituents, because all Americans will 
see the economic benefits of immigra-
tion reform.

August 9, 2021 
(English translation of the statement 
made in Spanish is as follows:) 
Madam President, we have more than an 
opportunity—we have an obligation—to pass 
meaningful immigration reform as part of 
the upcoming reconciliation bill. 
For the millions of essential workers and 
long-term residents who lack permanent sta-
tus. 
For the bipartisan majority of Americans 
who support reform for their immigrant 
friends, families, and neighbors. 
And for every one of our constituents—be-
cause all Americans will see the economic 
benefits of immigration reform. 
I recently met with President Biden 
in the Oval Office to discuss Califor-
nia’s immigration needs. And I am so 
thankful for President Biden and Vice 
President HARRIS’s unequivocal sup-
port for including immigration reforms 
in the budget reconciliation process. 
As I said, we have an opportunity and 
a responsibility to bring security to 
millions of federally recognized essen-
tial workers and their families. 
I urge my colleagues to join me in 
recognizing the essential work and eco-
nomic contributions of immigrants by 
opening the pathway to citizenship and 
the American dream. 
Thank you. 
I now yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Iowa. 
TRUMP INVESTIGATION 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Last week, Judici-
ary staff interviewed Jeffrey Rosen, 
Trump’s former Acting Attorney Gen-
eral, and Mr. Rosen’s Deputy at the 
Justice Department, Rich Donoghue. 
These interviews were done as part of 
the Democrats’ never-ending series of 
investigations into former President 
Trump. 
Their obsession with him has been 
very consistent, I will give them that. 
So, too, are the Democrats’ public com-
ments that grossly mischaracterized— 
at least for now—the state of the evi-
dence. 
I will start with a little history. This 
country has had to deal with Demo-
crats’ obsession with destroying Trump 
for much too long. In the process, I fear 
my colleagues on the other side of the 
aisle have done and will do lasting 
damage to our political system. 
For example, in May 2017, then-Rank-
ing Member FEINSTEIN and I met with 
then-Director Comey about Crossfire 
Hurricane. At that classified briefing, 
Comey said Trump was not under in-
vestigation. But that didn’t stop the 
Democrats from publicly saying that 
Trump was under investigation. 
And because Comey kept the answer 
classified, he couldn’t and didn’t rebut 
it. But Democrats knew it was a lie, 
and they kept on saying that lie until 
Trump fired Comey because Comey 
wouldn’t make the fact that Trump 
wasn’t under investigation public. 
Unfortunately, the Democrats’ big lie 
eventually got them what they wanted 
because Comey then helped orchestrate 
an investigation over his firing. 
Day after day, year after year, my 
colleagues on the other side of the aisle 
misled the country about the true facts 
relating to the Crossfire Hurricane. In 
doing so, they undermined their credi-
bility. But, somehow, they kept inves-
tigations going, along with an all-too 
supplicant press. 
My staff has participated in these 
staff-led interviews that have occurred 
in the last week, and I have been 
briefed on the matters at hand. I was 
also at the Rosen interview. 
Within hours of Saturday’s Rosen 
interview, the Democrats were already 
on television and in papers talking 
about the substance of the interviews. 
In their public comments, they pro-
vided politically slanted mischarac-
terizations about where the investiga-
tion currently stands. 
I would like to specifically note that 
the chairman of the Committee, Sen-
ator DURBIN, said, in part, to CNN on 
Sunday about the Rosen interview that 
‘‘the Justice Department had set it up 
for us and said we’re waiving any privi-
lege. He’’—meaning these people being 
interviewed—‘‘can speak to any issue. 
We’re not holding back.’’ 
At the Donoghue interview on Fri-
day, the Justice Department, contrary 
to what I just stated to you, objected 
to my staff’s questions on several occa-
sions and prevented Donoghue from an-
swering. So to go back to what I said 
from the quote on CNN, it had been set 
up ‘‘for us and said we’re waiving any 
privilege. He can speak to any issue.’’ 
But when it comes to some of the ques-
tions my staff was asking, that wasn’t 
true. 
The same happened at least once in 
the Rosen interview. And I believe the 
Justice Department made an objection 
even to a Democrat-led question in 
Donoghue’s interview. So we were not 
able to ask any questions as we were 
promised. 
So when the Democrats say these 
witnesses can ‘‘speak to any issue,’’ 
well, apparently that is not the case. 
The Biden administration and its Jus-
tice Department have waived executive 
privilege for these witnesses to speak 
about close and intimate conversations 
that the President had with his advis-
ers. 
If you get even a little bit away from 
Trump, then, in your questioning, well, 
then the Justice Department doesn’t 
want Congress to know the facts. You 
see what I mean by saying that Justice 
objected to some of my staff’s ques-
tions? 
Mind you, now, the Justice Depart-
ment and other executive Agencies 
consistently refuse to produce records 
to Congress, claiming what we call de-
liberative process. When it comes to 
Trump, the usual order doesn’t apply. 
Given the new executive privilege po-
sition that the Biden administration 
has created here, it is entirely possible 
that at some point in the future, we 
could all be talking to President 
Biden’s closest advisers about their in-
ternal deliberative process. Or is there 
a double standard? I have to laugh a 
little bit at that possibility, knowing 
how my colleagues on the other side of 
the aisle will complain about how such 
a decision to seek information is polit-
ical in nature. 
With respect to Trump and what was 
said at these high-level meetings, those 
are the types of meetings where all 
kinds of things are discussed. That is 
the whole point. The President has 
every right to discuss ideas and strate-
gies with his closest advisers. The 
President, whether that President is a 
Democrat or a Republican, should feel 
unrestrained to bring ideas to his clos-
est staff for robust discussion. 
Eventually, the facts will come out, 
and Trump will have to address them, 
good or bad, depending on the facts at 
hand. However, the essential question 
that should be asked is, What was the 
final decision? And that is my major 
concern about the recent public com-
ments coming out of these interviews I 
have discussed relating to this new 
Trump investigation. 
Unlike my Democratic colleagues, I 
won’t discuss the evidence publicly at 
this point in time, but let me remind 
the American public with a couple al-
ready-public points. 
Did Trump fire Acting Attorney Gen-
eral Jeffrey Rosen? No, he did not fire 
him. 
Did 
Trump 
fire 
Rich 
Donoghue, 
Rosen’s Deputy? No, he did not fire 
Rich Donoghue. 
Also, on August 7, 2021, a CNN article 
states—now, this is about those inter-
views that I have been talking about 
that happened in the last week. From 
CNN: ‘‘The men testified that in their 
interactions with Trump’’—I had bet-
ter start over again or we will get this 
wrong. 
‘‘The men testified that in their 
interactions with Trump, he didn’t 
order them to do anything illegal and 
eventually accepted their advice that 
the Justice Department couldn’t take 
actions to claim fraud when it had no 
evidence of it.’’ 
In other words—that is end of quote; 
I want to just interpret—claim fraud in 
the last Presidential election because 
there was no evidence of fraud. 
Incredibly, one of the same com-
mittee Democrats who spread the 
Trump lie today said criminal prosecu-
tions could come out of this investiga-
tion. 
If the facts eventually fit the Demo-
crats’ narrative that they so badly 
want to be true of their narrative, then 
they fit. It is what it is. But I haven’t 
seen anything backing up their mis-
leading conclusions from either what I 
saw at the interviews or what my staff 
has reported to me from those inter-
views over the last week. 
Now, until that point comes that the 
Democratic narrative proves out to be 
what they want it to be, the Democrats 
should quit trying to fit a square peg in 
a round hole, and they need to stop vio-
lating committee rules and protocols. 
Because of this, why would any wit-
ness want to testify now, at the risk of 
their words being leaked and twisted to

satisfy a partisan agenda? Facts and 
evidence matter, not speculative, par-
tisan cheap shots. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Connecticut. 
Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Madam Presi-
dent, I am here to talk about the Build 
Back Better proposal and the budget 
resolution that we will shortly take up, 
but let me just respond briefly to my 
good friend and colleague from Iowa’s 
remarks on the interview that was con-
ducted with Jeffrey Rosen on Saturday 
and the previous interview with Rich 
Donoghue. 
I agree completely that the facts and 
the evidence are what are important 
here, and this investigation is su-
premely significant. I hope that we will 
join, on a bipartisan basis, to follow 
the facts and the law wherever they 
lead and encourage voluntary coopera-
tion by the witnesses and collect all of 
the documents and other evidence that 
is necessary to fairly and fully present 
the truth to the American people. They 
deserve to know what we have heard so 
far, which amounts to a chilling and 
shocking picture of a President seeking 
to corrupt the Department of Justice 
and overthrow an election. That much 
has been clear from the evidence that 
we have seen. 
But I agree that we should not talk 
about the specific facts at this point 
because it is an ongoing investigation. 
And I hope that we will join, in a bipar-
tisan way, not only to encourage vol-
untary cooperation but to seek testi-
mony and documents by subpoena 
where necessary, where, as a matter of 
resort, if that evidence is denied, we 
need to do so because the interests of 
our Nation are best served by the 
truth. 
All of it should be made public. Even-
tually, these transcripts from inter-
views and other evidence should be 
made public so that the American peo-
ple can see the truth. I know that my 
colleague from Iowa has been a staunch 
and steadfast champion of whistle-
blowing, of making available the truth 
to the American people. Nobody in this 
body has been a stronger advocate of 
whistleblowers and protecting them so 
that the American people could see the 
truth than my colleague from Iowa. So 
I am hopeful that we will work to-
gether toward that end. 
BUDGET RECONCILIATION 
Madam President, the Build Back 
Better proposal that will soon be com-
ing before the Senate is literally a 
milestone for this country. 
The bipartisan infrastructure pro-
posal that we will shortly pass is trans-
formative for our Nation and for Con-
necticut. It will enable us to do long- 
overdue work on our roads and bridges, 
our railroads and broadband, on the 
physical assets that are essential to 
this country creating jobs and remain-
ing competitive around the globe. This 
work has been too long delayed, and I 
will be proud to support it. 
I thank all of our colleagues on both 
sides of the aisle who have contributed 
so critically to making this vote pos-
sible; final passage of a measure that 
will enable the bridge across the Con-
necticut River to be truly safe and reli-
able; the Mixmaster in Waterbury—so- 
called because it mixes several roads at 
once—to be finally done; a proposal 
that will enable, we hope, eventually, 
the tracks between New Haven and 
New York to be really reliable, to be 
maintained properly. 
On every one of those transportation 
byways, there are people who depend 
on them, people who are going to work 
or to visit their family. Those people 
are, at the end of the day, who this in-
frastructure serves. And the freight 
that will be on railroads or the goods 
and produce transported on our high-
ways go to people. They serve our econ-
omy. They create jobs. We need to do 
much more for those people. 
Just today in the New York Times, in 
the Business section, there is an article 
about a young mother who wants to go 
back to work, reenter the workforce, 
but she has two children. One is await-
ing the beginning of school, and the 
other, she feels, needs and deserves 
daycare before she can go back to 
work. That road that enables her to 
drive or the railroad, to commute, 
won’t be a link to the workplace for 
her until she has daycare. 
Our economy is interconnected in 
ways that we understand intuitively 
when we look at individual people, but 
too often, we have mounds of paper—no 
longer for all of us truly paper but 
mounds of print—and numbers and sta-
tistics. The real story is in that young 
mother whose account is so important 
to us, the human story. 
Universal daycare, paid family leave, 
affordable medical care, and housing— 
they are also the stuff of human needs. 
They are part of our human assets. 
Seniors need dental care and eye-
glasses and hearing aids so that they 
can appreciate all of the benefits that 
we are trying to bring them through 
this infrastructure program. 
The American people need jobs so 
that they can afford prescription drugs, 
and the cost of prescription drugs 
needs to be lower so they don’t have to 
make these choices that we describe 
day after day between paying the mort-
gage and putting food on the table and 
clothing their kids. 
The pandemic has affected health, 
food, shelter, and the financial and 
overall security of families across the 
country. It has taken a toll on small 
businesses. They, too, need help. The 
Restaurant 
Revitalization 
Program 
should be replenished and small busi-
nesses given a lifeline they need be-
cause they have been so direly injured 
and threatened. 
We need to build back America and 
the assets—the roads and bridges but 
also the systems—that serve Ameri-
cans, and we need to build it back bet-
ter. 
I am proud to support this budget 
resolution that will make investments 
for working families, the elderly, our 
environment. 
Over the past year, I have spoken to 
countless 
families 
who 
need 
that 
childcare and providers who furnish it 
across the northeast. Childcare is crit-
ical not only to those jobs and the peo-
ple who fill jobs, but also to the emo-
tional and educational development of 
children—allowing moms and dads, and 
grandparents, to go back to work, but 
also for children to have the basics in 
preparation for education that they 
need. 
By establishing a universal pre-care 
system and providing families with in-
centives, like the child care tax cuts, 
to help them afford care, we can ensure 
that children are prepared for success 
and parents can go to work. 
But it isn’t enough to ensure that 
families can just afford childcare. We 
have to ensure they are able to live 
healthy lives. And we know healthcare 
is complicated; it is confusing; it is ex-
pensive, especially for our aging sen-
iors and people with disabilities and 
our fellow Americans with preexisting 
conditions. 
Over this past year, we learned clear-
ly and dramatically how resource-de-
prived our healthcare system has be-
come—individuals 
forced 
to 
make 
choices between keeping a roof over 
their head or going to the doctor or 
paying for medications. No American 
family should be forced to make those 
choices. 
And we need to invest. It is not about 
spending; 
it 
is 
investing 
in 
our 
healthcare system. This budget pro-
posal will accomplish exactly that 
goal. 
Lower prescription drug costs, low-
ering those burdens, providing broader 
access to medical providers, including 
that dental care, hearing aids, and vi-
sion for individuals—all individuals— 
on Medicare should be our paramount 
goal. 
And 
it 
is 
critical 
that 
home 
healthcare workers and patients under-
stand their value. Individuals with dis-
abilities were left struggling to find af-
fordable home- and community-based 
services throughout the pandemic. We 
need to appreciate the home care work-
ers and support them and pay them 
adequately, just as we need to provide 
that home care for seniors who need it. 
Healthcare is more than access to care; 
it is the basic system that provides 
that access. 
And there should be no delay when 
we are talking about the air we breathe 
and the water we drink, because those 
assets also are essential to healthcare. 
Rail will be supported—better rail-
roads, tracks, cars—by this proposal 
that we are passing today or tomorrow, 
but there is more that needs to be done 
to ensure high-speed rail. Right now, 
the link between New Haven and New 
York is slower than it was 50 years ago. 
We need to make sure that it is 
quicker—not just more reliable, but 
faster and more reliable and safer. 
Too often, the impacts of unsafe air 
and unhealthy drinking water fall on 
minority and low-income communities.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S6081 
August 9, 2021 
They have disproportionately faced ad-
verse impacts from public and environ-
mental health grants, and the Amer-
ican people are counting on our leader-
ship to authorize funding for invest-
ment in programs that support clean 
energy resources. Climate change is an 
enemy that we must conquer, just as 
we are working to conquer the pan-
demic. 
In the Senate, I have worked with 
the administration to meet the goal of 
conserving 30 percent of our country’s 
lands and 30 percent of our waters 
within the next decade. That goal is 
ambitious, but it is a vital effort that 
takes an important step toward reduc-
ing environmental justice and ensuring 
healthy lives for all. 
This proposal is comprehensive, and 
that is exactly what is needed now—a 
comprehensive program that deserves 
our support and our leadership. We 
must invest in our country’s leadership 
by putting the American people and 
what they need—childcare, healthy 
homes, and environments—put it first. 
I am proud to support this proposal, 
and I look forward to advancing it on 
the Senate floor. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Ohio. 
Mr. PORTMAN. Madam President, I 
appreciated the comments from my 
colleague from Connecticut. And he 
talked about both the bipartisan infra-
structure bill that is on the floor of the 
Senate and will be voted on tomorrow 
morning, and he also talked about the 
budget proposal that is also going to be 
considered by the Senate this week. 
I want to start by just being sure 
that those two are distinguished be-
cause there is a big contrast between 
them. The bipartisan infrastructure 
package, I believe, is a sensible ap-
proach to restoring our Nation’s infra-
structure, as we will talk about in a 
moment. And that legislation, again, is 
meant to be voted on tomorrow morn-
ing. 
The other proposal is the $3.5 trillion, 
or more, budget resolution that will be 
partisan—not bipartisan—that is being 
proposed by the Democrats, which is a 
tax-and-spending extravaganza. 
And my concern is, not only does it 
spend a lot of money we don’t have— 
and not on long-term assets, like infra-
structure, but on social programs—but, 
also, it raises taxes substantially. In 
fact, it raises taxes more than taxes 
were cut back in 2017, which created 
such a strong economy going into the 
pandemic. And I really do worry about 
what is going to happen to our country 
should we do that. 
The bipartisan infrastructure pack-
age has no tax increases. The $3.5 tril-
lion budget resolution has these huge 
new taxes. I will tell you, most econo-
mists believe that the tax reform and 
tax cuts back in 2017 led to not just an 
incredibly strong economy, but an in-
clusive economy. 
Going into the pandemic, February of 
2020, we not only had historically low 
levels of unemployment for certain 
groups in our economy—Blacks, His-
panics, and others—we had a 50-year 
low on unemployment overall. We had 
the lowest poverty rate ever recorded 
in the United States of America. We 
started recording it back in the fifties. 
We also had wages that were going up 
consistently, more than 3 percent an-
nually for 19 straight months going 
into the pandemic. That was fantastic. 
In my home State of Ohio, we had 
seen flat wages or even declining wages 
when you take inflation into account 
for years, probably a decade and a half. 
So things were working. And even com-
ing out of this pandemic, most econo-
mists had thought that, Wow, we have 
a pretty darned resilient and resurgent 
economy here. 
And you see the economic growth 
numbers. Last month and this past 
quarter—I mean, the economy is doing 
just what we had hoped it would do 
coming out of the pandemic. To raise 
taxes now and to get rid of these tax 
cuts and tax reforms—importantly, tax 
reforms as well that created this 
strong opportunity economy—is a huge 
mistake. 
So I would just draw a very distinct 
contrast between what my colleague 
and friend from Connecticut was talk-
ing about because he kind of mixed the 
two—one is infrastructure that is bi-
partisan, no taxes; the other is a dif-
ferent kind of spending—social spend-
ing—that we cannot afford and on top 
of the huge new tax increases. 
So I hope that we will choose to vote 
tomorrow on the infrastructure pack-
age in a bipartisan way because it is 
landmark and needed legislation in fix-
ing our Nation’s roads, bridges, rail-
roads, our ports, our waterways, our 
electrical grid, our broadband network, 
and more. 
And I am proud of the work the Sen-
ate has done on that. It will be a last-
ing bipartisan achievement to help the 
people we represent. It is going to im-
prove the lives of all Americans. It is 
long-term spending to repair and re-
place and build assets that will last for 
decades. 
In doing so, it makes life better for 
people. It improves the life of the mom 
or dad who commutes to work and gets 
stuck in rush hour every day and would 
much rather be spending that time 
with their family. It improves the lives 
of people who are tired of those pot-
holes. We all want to fix those pot-
holes. We all hate them. 
One quick story there. When I am 
asked how I got into public service, I 
often relay a story that when I was 7 or 
8 years old, I remember driving with 
my mom on a rough road and telling 
her: Someday, Mom, I want to fix those 
potholes. 
And she loved to tell that story. 
That was my first exposure to what 
it could be like in public service, being 
able to fix potholes. Unfortunately, I 
then went on to public service at the 
Federal level in the House and the Sen-
ate and two Bush White Houses, and I 
never got to fix any potholes. 
Maybe this legislation is taking it 
full circle because it will be fixing pot-
holes, and it will make driving more 
safe. 
There is a story I want to relate. Re-
cently, in Cincinnati, OH, a guy named 
Howard Krueger was driving along I–75 
South, and a big piece of concrete fell 
down from a bridge called the Western 
Hills Viaduct, which is in terrible 
shape. It is one of our crumbling infra-
structure projects we have to fix. A big 
piece of concrete hit his windshield. 
Thank God it didn’t come through his 
windshield or kill him, but it shattered 
part of his windshield. He actually 
pulled off the road to go try to find the 
concrete, to get it off the road for 
someone else, and to talk to the work 
crew that he assumed had dropped it. 
He went up and looked up, and there 
was no work crew; it was just concrete 
falling from the bridge. 
Infrastructure—it matters to people. 
It is about safety. That truckdriver, 
who leaves his family to go on a long 
haul, he wants to have a road and 
bridge that is safe. 
We recently had another accident in 
Ohio. It was on the Brent Spence 
Bridge; two trucks colliding. There is 
no shoulder left on that bridge because 
it is carrying twice the number of vehi-
cles it was meant to carry—twice. It is 
functionally obsolete, and yet we have 
talked about it for 20 years and noth-
ing has happened. After 20 years of 
talking about it, it is time to get some-
thing done. 
Here in this town, we have talked 
about infrastructure being improved 
for a long, long, long time—longer than 
20 years. In fact, every President in 
modern times has proposed a big infra-
structure package, and yet we never 
seem to get it done. 
Donald Trump actually proposed a 
$1.5 trillion infrastructure package. 
This one we are talking about today is 
$548 billion. He is a developer. He un-
derstands the need for infrastructure, 
to make investments in hard assets, 
because it comes back to help the econ-
omy. 
So whether you are that truckdriver, 
or whether you are that mom or dad, or 
whether you are somebody who lives in 
a rural and underserved area of our 
country because you don’t have access 
to broadband and you can finally now 
get it for your schoolwork or your 
work-work or for your healthcare, this 
is going to make a difference. 
It improves our overcapacity ports. 
Right now, at our seaports, ships are 
backing up. If you are trying to get a 
product and you are a consumer and 
you are wondering why you are not 
getting it, that might be the reason. 
And guess what. It also invests in our 
overwhelmed 
southern 
border 
land 
ports, with $3.85 billion to GSA and 
Customs and Border Protection. So for 
those of you concerned about the 
southern border and what is happening 
there, this infrastructure bill does 
help. It helps with our land ports and 
our seaports and, therefore, helps Cus-
toms and Border Protection.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S6082 
August 9, 2021 
We also have more for water infra-
structure 
in 
this 
legislation—clean 
drinking water. Lead pipes is a big 
issue in my home State of Ohio, as it is 
in other States. That is dealt with 
here—remediation of the lead pipe dan-
ger and risks. 
There is a lot in here that helps peo-
ple, helps make their lives better. 
Very importantly for me, it also 
makes our economy more efficient by 
fixing that bridge, by fixing that port. 
When you make the economy more ef-
ficient, the economy becomes more 
productive. When the economy is more 
productive, you have higher GDP. 
When you have higher GDP, you have 
more taxes coming into the economy 
than you would have had otherwise. 
That is what happens with infrastruc-
ture spending, if it is done right. 
It has been made clear in poll after 
poll this is something that actually 
brings our country together. According 
to a CNBC poll, 87 percent of Ameri-
cans think it is important that we in-
vest in improving our crumbling roads 
and bridges. A month or so later, a CBS 
poll found 87 percent of Americans sup-
port more Federal spending on repair-
ing roads and bridges. And an Associ-
ated Press poll found 8 in 10 Ameri-
cans—80 percent—favored plans to in-
crease funding for roads, bridges, and 
ports and for pipes that supply drink-
ing water. 
So, of course, it is popular because it 
affects their lives, and they know it. 
And we need the investment right 
now. The American Society of Civil En-
gineers gives our infrastructure a C- 
minus and projects our economy stands 
to lose more than $10 trillion in GDP 
by 2039 should we fail to invest in re-
pairs. We have fallen to 13th in the 
world in a report card on infrastruc-
ture while China continues to spend 
much more than we do as a percent of 
their GDP on infrastructure. Why? 
They want to have a more efficient 
economy. We want to be able to com-
pete and win the global competition. 
We, too, should be sure infrastructure 
is up to speed. 
The need for fixing and repairing our 
Nation’s infrastructure is clear. It is no 
surprise, again, that these Presidents, 
through the modern times, including 
Donald 
Trump, 
have suggested it. 
Frankly, I believe Donald Trump’s ad-
vocacy 
in 
infrastructure 
helped 
changed the way many in the Repub-
lican Party view these kinds of invest-
ments. This investment in repairing 
and upgrading our infrastructure will 
also have a real and lasting impact on 
our economy long term. 
There is a lot of discussion about in-
frastructure right now. Again, making 
the economy more efficient, more pro-
ductive, growing the economy, that is 
what economists would call, by invest-
ing in hard assets and jobs, the supply 
side. These are supply-side invest-
ments. This is why economists have 
said, including Michael Strain of the 
Conservative American Enterprise In-
stitute, 
this 
will 
be 
counterinfla-
tionary. That is important to note too. 
By the way, this money is not going to 
be spent next year. It is not going to be 
spent hardly at all the next year. It is 
going to be spent over 5, 10, 15 years on 
these long-term projects. 
There is one recent study by Associa-
tion of Equipment Manufacturers find-
ing that this legislation will create 
about half a million new jobs by 2024. 
So it is also about new jobs in indus-
tries 
ranging 
from 
construction, 
plumbing, electrical engineering to 
software development. 
Importantly, it accomplishes these 
goals while avoiding the tax hikes that 
will kill our economy, destroy jobs, 
and undermine our competitiveness 
around the world. 
That is why I started talking about 
the $3.5 trillion package that is wrong-
headed, in my view, in part because of 
the spending, but in part because of 
what it would do to our economy at a 
time when we are trying to get back on 
our feet postpandemic. 
We are going to provide billions in 
funding for some of our most pressing 
hard infrastructure needs, like $110 bil-
lion in new spending over the next 5 
years to construct, rebuild, and main-
tain our roads and highways. 
I heard one of my colleagues say only 
24 percent of this money goes into 
roads and bridges and ports. That is 
just not true. The number actually is 
about 42 percent into roads and bridges 
alone. This is going to make a big dif-
ference in my home State of Ohio. We 
have 123,000 miles of roads. Traffic con-
gestion costs motorists an estimated 
$4.7 billion each year in lost time and 
wasted fuel, according to the American 
Society of Civil Engineers. The same 
group, the Society of Civil Engineers, 
says there are currently more than 
46,000 bridges in our country that are 
considered structurally deficient and in 
‘‘poor condition.’’ Yet 178 million trips 
are taken on these deficient bridges 
every single day. 
Ohio is No. 2 in the Nation in the 
number of bridges. We have a lot of 
them, but nearly half of those are not 
in good condition. That is why I am 
pleased this legislation does provide for 
new funding for our bridges. It will 
work competitive grants to improve 
the bridges that would help with all of 
our bridges but particularly a huge 
problem in Ohio, which is the Brent 
Spence Bridge—this dangerous bridge I 
talked about where there are no shoul-
ders anymore. It is bearing twice the 
number of vehicles per day as it was 
constructed to do. It was considered 
structurally obsolete for years, for two 
decades. It is time to fix it. 
We also do something here that is 
very important to stretch that Federal 
dollar and to take out some of the inef-
ficiency in the way we construct our 
roads and our bridges and other infra-
structure. We make needed reforms to 
the Federal permitting process and 
give project sponsors more certainty to 
help them create more jobs and develop 
our Nation’s infrastructure with less 
costs. This was a priority of the Trump 
administration that was never codified 
into law. 
But in this bill, we actually expand 
and improve what is called FAST–41, 
which was in the last highway bill—not 
the one currently but before. But it has 
a sunset on it, and these permitting re-
forms have worked. They lowered the 
amount of time and saved billions of 
dollars for key permitting projects. We 
make this a permanent part of our law. 
Also, the surface transportation bill 
itself has additional permitting reform 
in it. This, frankly, is better permit-
ting reform than we have been able to 
get for years, even when we had a Re-
publican President, Republican Con-
gress. I am very pleased that that is 
part of this legislation, and it should 
be. All Americans should support that. 
Taking the average from 2 years— 
from currently 6, 7, 8 years down to 2 
years for a project, why doesn’t that 
make sense? Everybody should be for 
that. 
We also made necessary investments 
in the future of our economy on the 
digital side by increasing access to 
broadband services. In Ohio, that is 
really important. We have a bunch of 
counties and about 18 of them are 
unserved and we have probably another 
20 that are underserved. 
In Appalachian Ohio, we need inter-
net. We need it fast enough so people 
can start a business, so kids can use it 
for school, so veterans can use it to get 
their healthcare and not have to drive 
into the big city. 
These are only a few highlights. And 
I could go on, but the bottom line is we 
are dedicating this $548 billion in infra-
structure spending over the next 5 
years toward a wide range of projects 
that will collectively have a positive 
impact on our economy and on the 
American people. 
This has been a different sort of proc-
ess, I acknowledge that. And, frankly, 
a lot of this, I think, should have been 
done directly through committees, par-
ticularly with regard to transit, with 
regard to broadband. In other areas, we 
simply picked up the work of the com-
mittee—surface transportation, as an 
example, much of the work by the 
Commerce Committee, the EPW Com-
mittee, and others, the ENR Com-
mittee, the Energy and Natural Re-
sources Committee. 
Many of us worked hard to ensure 
that this was a truly bipartisan project 
but also that we got the best input 
from all the experts here in the Con-
gress. I would have drafted this bill a 
little differently if it had been just me. 
I am sure everybody feels that way 
about it. It was a true bipartisan 
project and, therefore, there were con-
cessions made on both sides. 
But I am proud of the broad support 
it has received in this Chamber. I am 
proud of the broad support it has re-
ceived from the outside. More than 100 
industry 
associations, 
unions, 
and 
trade groups have already come for-
ward to endorse the Infrastructure In-
vestment and Jobs Act. Among them

I think it is safe to say we have an

in our country. They know it is the 
right thing to do for our economy, for 
our future. I thank all of the stake-

these combined efforts, tomorrow, I be-
lieve, we will be getting it right for the 
American people, for our economy, and 
for the future of our great country. 
I look forward to seeing this legisla-
tion pass the Senate tomorrow, and I 
urge the House to pass it soon so that 
it can move to President Biden’s desk 
for his signature. 
I yield the floor. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
COONS). The Senator from Pennsyl-
vania. 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST—AMENDMENT 
NO. 2656 TO H.R. 3684 
Mr. TOOMEY. Mr. President, we had 
a big controversy in the infrastructure 
bill over how to go about imposing 
transaction reporting requirements on 
crypto exchange programs. 
I am very pleased to be able to report 
that a group of us reached a bipartisan 
agreement: 
Democrats 
and 
Repub-
licans, the Biden Treasury, and the ad-
ministration is on board. 
I want to thank the cosponsors of the 
amendment that brought everybody to-
gether on this: Senator WARNER, Sen-
ator LUMMIS, Senator PORTMAN, and 
Senator SINEMA are all in agreement 
on this. I should point out I appreciate 
Senator RON WYDEN’s work throughout 
this entire process. 
Let me just give a little bit of con-
text here, and then I am going to yield 
to some colleagues and then ask unani-
mous consent that we adopt this com-
monsense change. 
To start off, we have very broad 
agreement, probably unanimous agree-
ment, that centralized digital asset ex-
changes, when they behave as brokers, 
should be required to report trans-
actions of their customers just like or-
dinary brokers do: stockbrokers, bond 
brokers. The problem is that the under-
lying text of this bipartisan infrastruc-
ture bill, while it attempts to do this, 
I think it is very significantly flawed 
with how it goes about it. 
The unintended consequence of the 
current text is it will ensnare people 
and companies and impose this trans-
action reporting requirement on those 
to whom it shouldn’t apply and, in 
some cases, people who couldn’t even 
possibly comply. 
For example, the underlying text of 
this bill would impose this kind of 
transaction reporting requirement on 
crypto transaction validators. These 
are the people who are building out the 
block chain by validating a trans-
action. They would be obligated to re-
port things like a name and a tax ID 
number associated with the dollar 
amount. They don’t have that informa-
tion. For them, the transaction is just 
an anonymized number. It doesn’t 
make any sense at all. 
Also, people who write software code 
and then have no further involvement 
in any transactions, I think they would 
be captured by this language in the un-
derlying bill. Certainly, that doesn’t 
make any sense. It would apply to any-
body who is providing a service that ef-
fectuates these transactions. 
Think about the parallel in the ordi-
nary securities brokerage business. 
Think about Merrill Lynch. We require 
Merrill Lynch to report the informa-
tion about me if I give them my money 
to buy stock. That makes sense. But 
we don’t require the electric company 
that provides electrical service to Mer-
rill Lynch to make any such reporting 
because that would not make sense. 
What happened was a group of us 
came together to clarify the rules of 
who 
are 
the 
actual 
brokers 
of 
cryptocurrency who should be respon-
sible for the transaction reporting re-
quirement. 
We are not proposing anything that 
is the least bit sweeping or radical. Our 
solution just makes clear that a broker 
means only those persons who conduct 
transactions on exchanges where cus-
tomers are buying and selling and trad-
ing digital assets. 
We make sure that the bill does not 
sweep in software developers. It does 
not 
sweep 
in 
crypto 
transaction 
validators, regardless of which of the 
various methods they use for the vali-
dation. It doesn’t sweep in node opera-
tors or any other nonbrokers. But any-
one 
who 
owes 
any 
tax 
from 
a 
cryptocurrency transaction should pay 
their tax obligation. 
So if you are actually a crypto 
broker, you would be required to turn 
over that information under our ap-
proach. Our amendment would do that. 
But it is important that the reporting 
requirement only applies to those 
kinds of intermediaries. 
I don’t think any one of our cospon-
sors thinks our solution is absolutely 
perfect, but it is a big improvement 
over the underlying text. 
I would also point out that this space 
is changing. It is changing fast. A year 
from now, people will have come up 
with innovations and applications that 
we can’t even imagine that probably 
nobody has even thought of yet. What 
I don’t want to do is impose a burden 
that is going to stifle that kind of in-
novation. 
What we shouldn’t do is have an 
overly broad mandate or reporting re-
quirement on people who can’t even 
comply. We shouldn’t favor or punish 
any particular methodology or plat-
form design or validation mechanism. 
And we shouldn’t—we shouldn’t—stifle 
innovation. 
There is time to do this. There is an 
agreement. It is bipartisan. The White 
House is on board. We can get this 
done. We can do it right now. 
I am going to yield to my colleague 
from Wyoming before making a unani-
mous consent request. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Wyoming. 
Ms. LUMMIS. Mr. President, I am 
pleased to join with my colleagues in 
urging the Senate to allow this widely 
supported bipartisan amendment to 
move forward. 
I want to thank Ranking Member 
TOOMEY, 
Senator 
WARNER, 
Senator 
PORTMAN, Senator SINEMA, and Chair-
man WYDEN. Chairman WYDEN, in par-
ticular, thank you for your early com-
mitment to me to get this right and for 
your partnership. 
The amendment before us specifies 
that persons who validate distributed 
ledger data, including digital asset 
miners and stakers, and those who pro-
vide hardware and software wallets, are 
not required to report customer infor-
mation to the Internal Revenue Serv-
ice. This is essential because those per-
sons would not have access to the cus-
tomer information necessary to comply 
with this requirement anyway. 
Equally important in this amend-
ment are clarifications to the defini-
tion of ‘‘broker’’ that will ensure that 
software protocol developers will not 
be swept up in IRS reporting require-
ments. Developers are the lifeblood of 
innovation and subjecting them to re-
porting would have far-reaching impli-
cations on privacy and on the evo-
lution of technology in this country, 
not to mention that most developers 
would not have access to useful data. 
This bill is very likely going to be-
come law, and it is important that 
these changes become law along with 
the bill. That is why I urge my col-
leagues not to let the perfect be the 
enemy of the good. 
I recognize there is dissatisfaction on 
both sides of the aisle with the lack of 
opportunity to offer amendments and 
to expedite debate. 
However, I ask you to weigh those 
concerns against the importance of 
providing millions of Americans with 
additional clarity on the scope of their 
coming obligations to the IRS. 
America is a country of innovation. 
Right now, our financial system is 
evolving before our eyes in much the 
same way that the internet first began 
to find a foothold in the mid-1990s. Dis-
tributed ledgers, digital assets, and 
other forms of financial technology are 
in the early stages of transforming the 
way we share and store value. 
This amendment has started the de-
bate on many difficult questions re-
lated to financial technology that the 
Senate must address over the next few 
years. We are reacting to what was put 
before us. I wish that we were imple-
menting from the get-go, but that is 
not where we find ourselves today. So

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S6084 
August 9, 2021 
let’s get this broker definition as good 
as possible now and then move forward 
this fall with other definitions that 
will be important to producing a regu-
latory sandbox for digital assets that 
allows innovators to keep innovating. 
We are in a difficult space right now. 
We are transitioning from the indus-
trial economy to technology, and it is 
a bumpy ride. It is disruptive for all of 
us, especially those of us who grew up 
at the end of the industrial age and are 
so new to this technology age. But we 
can adapt, we can be helpful, and we 
can help forge a very reasonable place 
for the innovators to work from. 
There is a proverb that says: ‘‘A jour-
ney of 1,000 miles begins with a single 
step.’’ 
This amendment is the very first step 
in a long journey, and we are all going 
to take it together. This journey is 
about America renewing its commit-
ment to innovation and retaining its 
role as the leader in the global econ-
omy for future generations. 
I look forward to working with each 
of you to make sure we get there, and 
I promise to be a partner to anyone 
willing to listen and learn. 
I urge my colleagues not to object 
and to allow this amendment to pro-
ceed to adoption. 
I yield back to the Senator from 
Pennsylvania, Mr. TOOMEY. 
Mr. TOOMEY. Mr. President, I want 
to thank the Senator from Wyoming 
for her very constructive leadership in 
this area, and I yield at this time to 
the Senator from Ohio. 
Mr. PORTMAN. I just want to say 
briefly to my colleague from Wyoming 
and my colleague from Pennsylvania, 
and also to our other colleagues who 
worked with us over the past week or 
so to come up with a good approach to 
this issue that is vexing, that we need 
to figure out how to get this into the 
legislation. So I support the amend-
ment, of course. 
I think there is a general consensus 
that information reporting is a good 
thing, and that particularly for our 
constituents, who are everyday holders 
of digital currency, they want to have 
that reporting in order to be able to 
pay their taxes properly. 
The vast majority of them are good, 
hard-working taxpayers who just want 
to be able to get what their basis is or 
what their information is from a 
broker, just as they would for a stock 
or a bond. 
So what we have done here through 
this language is ensure that, while 
doing that, we are not putting a sweep-
ing provision in place that includes 
people who shouldn’t be included. 
As an example—and my colleague 
from Pennsylvania said it very, very 
well—we are not trying to bring in peo-
ple who are involved in validating dis-
tributed ledger transactions through 
proof of work, commonly known as 
miners. 
We are also not trying to bring in 
‘‘proof of stake’’ validation or stakers, 
and we are also ensuring that we are 
not bringing in people who are involved 
with hardware and software selling for 
digital wallets. They wouldn’t be sub-
ject to these rules as well. And I think 
that was very important to make that 
clear. I think the language needed clar-
ification. 
So I am pleased with the amendment. 
I would hope that we would be able to 
get it passed because I think it is very 
important to have it as part of this leg-
islation, and I want to thank, again, 
my 
colleagues, 
from 
Pennsylvania, 
from Wyoming, as well as Senators 
WARNER, SINEMA, OSSOFF, WYDEN, and 
others who have worked with us in this 
process, and thank you for bringing 
this amendment to the floor today. 
Mr. TOOMEY. I thank the Senator 
from Ohio for his very constructive co-
operation on this, and let me yield to 
our colleague from Texas. 
Mr. CRUZ. Thank you. I want to 
thank the good efforts of the Senators 
who have led the work in finding a 
compromise in this regard, particularly 
Senator TOOMEY and Senator LUMMIS, 
who have worked very, very hard on 
this issue. 
You know, Bismarck said many years 
ago that there are two things you don’t 
want to see being made—sausage and 
legislation. And when it comes to par-
ticularly ugly legislation, this compo-
nent—the 
regulation 
of 
cryptocurrency—may take the prize for 
the ugliest we have seen. 
Moments from now, I expect that we 
are going to see objections to this com-
promise amendment that was nego-
tiated. If we do in fact see objections 
and if the underlying language in this 
bill goes into effect, it will have dev-
astating effects. 
There is a new and exciting industry, 
in 
the 
United 
States, 
of 
cryptocurrency, whether Bitcoin or 
otherwise, that is generating jobs, en-
trepreneurs who are creating new val-
ues, new hedges against inflation, new 
opportunities, and it is fast moving. It 
is dynamic. 
And this infrastructure bill—a bill 
being sold to the American people as 
‘‘let’s build some roads and bridges’’— 
has one little portion in there designed 
to obliterate cryptocurrency. 
Now, I fully understand that there 
are some bureaucrats at the Treasury 
Department that have never seen any-
thing they don’t want to regulate the 
life out of. But if the underlying lan-
guage in this so-called infrastructure 
bill becomes law, we will be destroying 
billions of dollars’ worth of industry in 
the United States. We will be destroy-
ing jobs in the United States—many of 
those jobs are in my home State of 
Texas—and we will be sending them 
overseas. 
Listen. 
It 
isn’t 
complicated. 
Cryptocurrency isn’t tied to any par-
ticular piece of dirt. So the grand ef-
forts of the U.S. Senate will be to say: 
We don’t want those jobs in America. 
We don’t want those resources in 
America. Go somewhere else. 
The ugly truth, which Bismarck un-
derstood and which is particularly true 
on cryptocurrency, is that there aren’t 
five Senators in this body with any 
real 
understanding 
of 
how 
cryptocurrency operates. We have had 
no hearings on this. The Senate has 
had no hearings on this. The House, as 
far as I know, has had no hearings on 
this. And yet this body is prepared to 
obliterate an industry willy-nilly or, 
for that matter, the compromise—and, 
listen, the compromise that was put 
forward would be a meaningful im-
provement, would do much, much less 
damage, but even the compromise 
would essentially kick the can down 
the road and allow bureaucrats at 
Treasury to do massive damage. And 
the bureaucrats at Treasury don’t un-
derstand this any better than does the 
U.S. Senate. 
The right outcome, I think, is an 
amendment I introduced—strike the 
whole damn thing. If we want to legis-
late on this, actually do our jobs, be a 
deliberative body, hold hearings, listen 
to 
witnesses, 
understand 
the 
con-
sequences, know what we are doing. 
That would be the reasonable, rational 
thing to do. Don’t just put out a rule of 
massive taxes and regulations with no 
understanding of the consequences and 
jobs and real people who would be hurt. 
For whatever reason, the Senate 
doesn’t seem to want to behave reason-
ably or rationally, and I think the con-
sequences are going to be longstanding 
of this foolish legislation. 
I think Senator TOOMEY and Senator 
LUMMIS have worked hard on a com-
promise to brunt the worst aspects of 
this legislation, and so I hope the pro-
posal they have put forward—or are 
about to put forward—is adopted. But 
if it is not, I am going to predict that 
every one of the 100 Senators here is 
going to come to regret that this body 
took a part in destroying jobs and a 
budding industry that will provide bil-
lions of dollars of new opportunity. 
And if the Senate keeps on this course, 
we are going to send it instead overseas 
to our competitors. That would be a 
tragic mistake. 
Thank you. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Pennsylvania. 
Mr. TOOMEY. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous 
consent 
that 
notwith-
standing adoption of substitute amend-
ment No. 2137, the Toomey-Warner- 
Lummis-Sinema-Portman amendment 
No. 2656 be agreed to.

Mr. SHELBY. Reserving the right to 
object, I ask that the Senator from 
Pennsylvania modify his request to in-
clude my amendment No. 2535 dealing 
with defense infrastructure to this bill 
and that it be agreed to. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the 
Senator from Pennsylvania so modify? 
Mr. TOOMEY. I do. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
any objection to the request as modi-
fied?

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S6085 
August 9, 2021 
Mr. SANDERS. Reserving the right 
to object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Vermont. 
Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, as I 
understand it, the Senator from Ala-
bama is interested in increasing mili-
tary spending by some $50 billion. 
You know, there is a headline in the 
New York Times today. It doesn’t talk 
about the fact that the United States 
now spends more than the next 10 na-
tions on the military. It doesn’t talk 
about the fact that the Pentagon is the 
only major Agency of government that 
has not submitted successfully to an 
independent audit. It doesn’t talk 
about the fact of huge profits among 
defense contractors. 
What it does talk about is that a hot-
ter future is now inevitable, a U.N. re-
port says. Scientists urge immediate 
switch from fossil fuels to avert great-
er peril. 
So I would say to my friend from 
Alabama, if we are going to invest $50 
billion, let us, in fact, invest in trans-
forming our energy system so that we 
can save this planet for future genera-
tions 
and 
prevent 
the 
kind 
of 
unhealthy deterioration that we will 
inevitably see if we do not act. 
So, Mr. President, I object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard. 
The Senator from Delaware. 
Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous 
consent 
that 
notwith-
standing adoption of substitute amend-
ment No. 2137, the Toomey amendment 
No. 2656 be considered and agreed to. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Alabama. 
Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, reserv-
ing the right to object again, I ask that 
the Senator modify his request to in-
clude my amendment No. 2535 and that 
it be agreed to. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the 
Senator from Delaware so amend? 
Mr. CARPER. I do not. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection to the original request by the 
Senator from Delaware? 
Mr. SHELBY. I object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ob-
jection is heard. 
Mr. TOOMEY. Mr. President. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Pennsylvania. 
Mr. TOOMEY. So for people who have 
been watching this and aren’t familiar 
with the bizarre practices in this body, 
I want to just explain briefly what just 
happened here. 
Because there is a difference of opin-
ion on whether or not the Senator from 
Alabama should get a vote on his 
amendment—because 
that 
is 
not 
agreed to—the body is refusing to take 
up an amendment that has broad bipar-
tisan support that we all know fixes 
something that badly needs to be fixed. 
This isn’t like a whim of the Senator 
from Pennsylvania. There is, like, no-
body who disputes that there is a prob-
lem here. 
You want to know the specifics of the 
problem? According to the underlying 
bill, this is what is going to pass. This 
is what is going to get sent ultimately 
to the President’s desk. It is a trans-
action reporting requirement, includ-
ing name, taxpayer ID number, dollar 
amount, date. It is imposed on any per-
son who, for consideration, is respon-
sible for regularly providing any serv-
ice effectuating transfers of digital as-
sets on behalf of another person. 
Well, look, I am not even a lawyer, 
but I can read. It sounds to me like any 
service 
effectuating 
transfers—that 
would include validators. I don’t know 
how 
that 
doesn’t 
include 
miners, 
stakers. It probably includes hardware 
and software wallets, software devel-
opers all across any kind of platform. 
We are going to ask these people to 
provide information that they don’t 
have and they can’t get. 
In what universe does that make any 
sense at all? All I want to do is have a 
vote on an amendment that fixes this 
in a way that has bipartisan agree-
ment, in a way that constrains this to 
apply narrowly to the people who actu-
ally are the intermediaries running a 
centralized exchange, who have this in-
formation. But apparently we are not 
going to be able to do that. So we will 
be back on this because we are going to 
do a lot of damage. Who knows how 
much innovation we are going to stifle. 
Who knows exactly what kind of new 
apps will never emerge. It is hard to 
predict what kind of completely impos-
sible mandate results in, but it is not 
good, and it is going to bring us back 
here having to try to clean up a mess 
which we could have prevented. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Texas. 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST—AMENDMENT 
NO. 2466 
Mr. CRUZ. Mr. President, unfortu-
nately, we just saw the Senator from 
Vermont object to a compromise solu-
tion negotiated by Senator TOOMEY and 
Senator LUMMIS that would have miti-
gated some of the harm from the dev-
astating 
new 
regulations 
on 
cryptocurrency in this so-called infra-
structure bill. Because the Senator 
from Vermont raised that objection, 
the status quo right now is that these 
new regulations are going into effect, 
and billions of dollars of value are 
going to be destroyed. 
Right now, today, about 106 million 
people 
are 
using 
cryptocurrencies 
around the world according to at least 
one recent report. The average annual 
income in the United States for a 
blockchain developer is $136,000. That 
represents a steady career of good in-
come for someone to own a home, to 
raise a family, to live a good and com-
fortable life. Texas is helping lead the 
way. Texas has taken the lead this past 
year as a major hub for cryptocurrency 
businesses and is even being hailed as 
the ‘‘cryptocurrency capital.’’ But all 
of this is under threat. 
Regulatory uncertainty is the No. 1 
barrier to blockchain adoption accord-
ing to 48 percent of respondents in a re-
cent report, and they are right to be 
worried. The current bill widens the 
definition 
of 
‘‘broker,’’ 
those 
who 
would have to collect information on 
cryptocurrency consumers and report 
this information to the IRS. It would 
force every single participant in the 
cryptocurrency structure to operate as 
a financial institution, which would 
mean they would have to provide con-
sumer information to the IRS even if 
they don’t have access to that informa-
tion. This overly broad definition of 
the word ‘‘broker’’ will block rapid in-
novation in cryptocurrency, and it will 
endanger the privacy of millions of 
Americans in cryptocurrency. 
This is wrong, so I applaud my col-
leagues for trying to find an incre-
mental approach. Unfortunately, be-
cause the Senator from Vermont ob-
jected, 
that 
incremental 
approach 
hasn’t been adopted. 
So let’s exercise a brief shining mo-
ment of common sense, and let’s recog-
nize that if we gathered all 100 Sen-
ators in this Chamber and asked them 
to stand up and articulate two sen-
tences defining what in the hell a 
cryptocurrency is, that you would not 
get greater than 5 who could answer 
that question. 
Given that reality, the barest exer-
cise 
of 
prudence 
would 
say 
we 
shouldn’t regulate something we don’t 
yet understand. We should actually 
take the time to try to understand it. 
We should hold some hearings. We 
should consider the consequences. We 
shouldn’t destroy people’s lives and 
livelihoods from complete ignorance. 
My amendment is very simple. It 
doesn’t add anything to this bill; it 
just strikes these provisions. It says: 
Look, let’s not do this until we know 
what we are talking about. Let’s be 
cautious. Let’s be reasonable. Let’s not 
be the No. 1 economic developer for the 
Communist Party of China by sending 
cryptocurrencies overseas to our com-
petitors because we have made it im-
possible for them to succeed here. 
Accordingly, Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous 
consent 
that 
notwith-
standing adoption of substitute amend-
ment No. 2137, that the Cruz Amend-
ment No. 2466 be agreed to. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
The Senator from Alabama. 
Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, reserv-
ing the right to object, I ask unani-
mous consent that the Senator from 
Texas modify his request to include my 
amendment No. 2535 dealing with de-
fense infrastructure in this country 
and that it be agreed to. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the 
Senator from Texas agree to so amend? 
Mr. CRUZ. Reserving the right to 
modify my request, I would share with 
the Senator from Alabama that I have 
the deepest respect for the leadership 
of the Senator from Alabama, that I 
understand the Senator from Alabama

has a profound commitment for the 
fighting men and women of our mili-
tary, as do I; that the Senator from 
Alabama’s commitment to invest in 
our military and military infrastruc-
ture is laudable, and I fully support 
that commitment. Indeed, I would 
commit to the Senator from Alabama 
that I am more than ready and eager to 
partner with him to press through in 
this body, through any avenue that is 
available, investing sufficient funds in 
our military, in our soldiers and sailors 
and airmen and marines, and in the 
weaponry they need to defend this Na-
tion. 
But, sadly, we know in this context 
that our Democratic colleagues are 
going to object to funding for the mili-
tary. They have decided that is not 
within their priorities. Even as they 
are spending trillions of dollars on ev-
erything else, defending this Nation is 
not a priority for the Democratic Mem-
bers of this conference. So, if your 
amendment is added to my amend-
ment, the effect will be what we just 
saw a moment ago, which is a Demo-
cratic Senator standing up and object-
ing and claiming the reason for object-
ing is they don’t want to fund the mili-
tary anymore. 
I believe it is in the interest in this 
body to have a clean vote on, do we de-
stroy cryptocurrencies, yes or no, with-
out any other issues, because as much 
as I would like to join the Senator 
from Alabama in investing more in the 
military—and 
I 
am 
committed 
to 
working with him in doing so—I also 
don’t believe we should be destroying 
jobs and millions of dollars of value in 
this country. Accordingly, I do not so 
modify my request. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection to the original request of the 
Senator from Texas? 
The Senator from Alabama. 
Mr. SHELBY. I object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard. 
The Senator from Arizona. 
H.R. 3684 
Ms. SINEMA. Mr. President, I rise 
today as we approach a final Senate 
vote on historic legislation to invest in 
America’s critical infrastructure, a bi-
partisan 
proposal 
that 
will 
make 
America stronger and safer, creating 
good-paying jobs, and expand economic 
opportunities across the country. 
After months of negotiations, the 
Senate has now debated our bipartisan 
Infrastructure Investment and Jobs 
Act for nearly 2 weeks in an open and 
legislative process. We considered 22 
amendments from both sides of the 
aisle and voted to adopt many of those 
amendments. In the coming hours, the 
Senate will have the opportunity to ap-
prove legislation that meets the needs 
of everyday families, employers, and 
communities. 
For decades, American infrastructure 
has 
been 
crumbling. 
For 
decades, 
American families have asked Congress 
for infrastructure investment. For dec-
ades, progress was blocked by partisan 
disagreements. Now, as the Senate pre-
pares for a final vote, what will this 
historic legislation actually mean for 
the people we serve? 
Our bill will mean better roads by in-
vesting a historic $110 billion to repair 
and upgrade our roadways, bridges, and 
other major transportation projects. 
It will mean faster internet for peo-
ple in more places by investing $65 bil-
lion to deploy high-speed broadband 
and help families afford internet serv-
ice. 
It will mean cleaner, more reliable 
water sources by making the strongest 
investment in drinking water and 
wastewater infrastructure in U.S. his-
tory, including water storage and recy-
cling and drought contingency plans 
throughout Western States like Ari-
zona. 
It will mean fewer power outages and 
stronger, 
more 
reliable 
electricity 
grids by investing $65 billion in power 
infrastructure. 
It 
will 
mean 
better 
protections 
against wildfires by investing in fire 
suppression and recovery and the re-
moval of hazardous fuels. 
It will mean stronger water and sani-
tation systems and better broadband 
access in Tribal communities, as well 
as full funding for all currently author-
ized Indian water settlements. In Ari-
zona, that includes the infrastructure 
for the Southern Arizona Indian water 
rights settlement with the Tohono 
O’odham Nation, completing the Gila 
River Indian Community water rights 
settlement, and funding the White 
Mountain Apache Tribe’s water rights 
settlement. 
Our legislation will mean safer, more 
convenient airports by investing $25 
billion to repair and upgrade terminals, 
runways, taxiways, and air traffic con-
trol towers. 
It will mean the strongest invest-
ment ever in American public transit 
by expanding transit networks, im-
proving accessibility, and funding the 
Nation’s transit repair backlog of thou-
sands of buses, railcars, stations, and 
thousands of miles of track, signals, 
and power systems. 
It will mean the largest investment 
in clean energy transmission and elec-
tric vehicle infrastructure in U.S. his-
tory, electrifying thousands of school 
and transit buses, boosting critical ma-
terials supply chains, and building out 
a national network of electric vehicle 
charging stations. 
We achieve all of these goals without 
raising taxes on everyday Americans. 
Strong, reliable infrastructure rep-
resents more than pipes and pavement; 
it represents the opportunities for 
Americans to visit loved ones, for new 
businesses to open and compete glob-
ally, for veterans to access telemedi-
cine, and for children to learn in safe 
and effective ways. That is why our 
legislation has earned the support of 
such a wide cross section of Americans. 
From the U.S. Chamber of Congress to 
the AFL–CIO, from agricultural pro-
ducers to clean energy leaders, from 
healthcare providers to transit advo-
cates to local mayors, the list of ex-
perts and organizations that have en-
dorsed our Infrastructure Investment 
and Jobs Act is long enough to take an 
entire speech just to list them all. But 
don’t worry, I won’t. Rarely does Fed-
eral legislation so directly address 
issues that matter to all our constitu-
ents, and rarer still does such historic 
legislation earn broad support in both 
parties. 
How many times have we heard in re-
cent months that bipartisanship isn’t 
possible anymore? 
We have been asked to accept a new 
standard by which important policy 
can only come together on a party line. 
And while Americans are more united 
than our politics would have you be-
lieve, we certainly face divisions. And, 
unfortunately, it is not commonplace— 
and by some, even expected—for elect-
ed leaders to feed those divisions on a 
daily basis with extreme and hyper-
bolic rhetoric, all-or-nothing policy de-
mands, and toxic partisan attacks. 
In Washington, palace intrigue and 
insider drama often steal the spotlight 
from important policy issues, but I 
promised 
Arizonans 
something 
dif-
ferent. I chose instead to follow the ex-
ample 
of 
the 
late 
Senator 
John 
McCain, who, as the Arizona Republic 
recently recalled, refused to demonize 
the opposition party and worked to 
reach bipartisan agreements that tried 
to bring the country together. 
This infrastructure effort is a perfect 
example of how I work to deliver re-
sults for Arizona. It is the easiest thing 
in the world for politicians to stay in 
their partisan corners, to line up on 
their respective sides of every partisan 
battle, and declare that bipartisanship 
is dead. But what is harder is getting 
out of our comfort zones and forming 
coalitions with unlikely allies that can 
achieve 
lasting 
results—lasting 
re-
sults—rather than temporary victories 
destined to be reversed, undermining 
the certainty that Americans depend 
on. 
Ask just about any constituent in 
any of our States about our country’s 
political divisions, and you will hear a 
desire from America’s citizens for all of 
us to find ways to bridge our dif-
ferences and work together to address 
the issues that actually matter to their 
daily lives. 
Our bipartisan Senate group that ne-
gotiated this historic legislation and 
those we have partnered with to 
strengthen the bill throughout this 
process provide an example of how to 
achieve that goal. 
In a demonstration of how the Senate 
was designed to work, the Senators in 
our group effectively represented the 
needs of the regions we represent: Sen-
ator CASSIDY in the Deep South and the 
gulf coast; Senator WARNER in the mid- 
Atlantic; Senator MANCHIN
in Appa-
lachia; 
and 
Senators 
ROMNEY
and 
TESTER in the West. And with Senator 
PORTMAN
representing the Midwest, 
the northeast and Alaska—each with

unique infrastructure needs—were ably 
represented by Senators SHAHEEN, COL-
LINS, and MURKOWSKI. 
In what should not be a surprise to 
anyone, those women in our bipartisan 
group brought a no-drama work ethic, 
policy expertise, and a knowledge of 
our region’s priorities that earned my 
designation of them as the ‘‘Wonder 
Women.’’ 
I sincerely thank my co-leader in 
partnering together on this effort, Sen-
ator ROB
PORTMAN
of Ohio, whose 
knowledge on issues ranging on permit-
ting requirements to the Federal budg-
et is matched only by his steadfast 
commitment to delivering on this pri-
ority for our country. 
I am just not sure how we or our 
teams will manage daily schedules 
without the endless meetings, calls and 
Zooms, negotiating the nuances of for-
mula funding and CBO scores. Actu-
ally, just kidding; we will manage just 
fine. 
Our bipartisan group eventually grew 
to include more than 20 Senators, in-
cluding my fellow home State Senator 
from Arizona, MARK KELLY. And a sig-
nificant portion of our legislation is 
made up of the surface transportation 
reauthorization, which was painstak-
ingly assembled in serious bipartisan 
committee negotiations led by Sen-
ators 
CARPER, 
CAPITO, 
CANTWELL, 
WICKER, BROWN, TOOMEY, and many 
others. Our proposal is a historic deal 
for communities across the country be-
cause of their hard work and expertise. 
We have also worked very closely 
with U.S. House leaders and the Prob-
lem Solvers Caucus, whose support will 
be absolutely crucial as our legislation 
moves to the House. Through every 
step in these negotiations, President 
Biden and his team, as well as Majority 
Leader SCHUMER, stood firmly behind 
us, helping navigate the difficult chal-
lenges; and I am honored that we have 
also earned the support of Republican 
Leader MITCH MCCONNELL as well. 
I would like to especially thank my 
legislative director, Michael Brownlie, 
for his hard work; and my entire policy 
team, who worked incredibly tirelessly 
over countless hours; along with our 
other 
Senate 
staff 
and 
President 
Biden’s team at the White House, to 
help turn our negotiated framework 
into this legislation. 
And what we have here today is what 
it looks like when elected leaders set 
aside their differences, shut out the 
noise and distractions, and just focus 
on forging common ground around our 
shared values. And this is what it looks 
like for elected leaders to ignore the 
extreme rhetoric and the cheap polit-
ical attacks and put energy instead 
into delivering lasting results that 
matter to everyday Americans. This is 
what it looks like when elected leaders 
take a step toward healing our coun-
try’s divisions, rather than feeding 
those very divisions. 
And with those shared values in 
mind, I urge my colleagues in both par-
ties to support the bipartisan Infra-
structure Investment and Jobs Act and 
help show the world that our democ-
racy still works and that we still lead 
the world in innovation and competi-
tiveness, and that Americans can be 
confident that their government is 
working for all of us and is indeed wor-
thy of all of us. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Alaska. 
Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I 
am pleased to be able to follow my 
friend and colleague, the Senator from 
Arizona. And while she is still on the 
floor, I want to thank her personally 
for her Herculean efforts that she has 
made throughout this process. It has 
not been easy. It has sometimes been 
challenging, and sometimes it takes 
somebody who just exudes optimism 
and enthusiasm and a deep-hearted, 
deep-seeded belief that what we are 
doing is good and it is right for all the 
right reasons. 
We have acknowledged here on the 
floor, each and every one of us, this in-
frastructure bill is not the perfect bill. 
But I am waiting—I am waiting—for 
the day when we here in the U.S. Sen-
ate can come to a place where all 100 of 
us agree that we have the perfect bill. 
But what we have for the Senate to 
consider is a product that is really 
built around core fundamentals and 
core principles that a group of Sen-
ators, equally divided, came together 
months ago to work through, knowing 
that the work was going to be hard. 
This is probably one of the most con-
sequential bills that I have been in-
volved with in my Senate career, in the 
close to 19 years that I have been here. 
What we are presenting to the Senate 
is truly historic in its proportions. It is 
historic in its impact going forward. 
This is truly legacy infrastructure that 
we are speaking about. 
Yesterday, it was a little frustrating. 
We have had some frustrating days 
where colleagues were sitting and wait-
ing, hoping for things to move more 
rapidly than they were, and that is 
challenging. We have a process here in 
the Senate that is hard for those on the 
outside to understand and oftentimes 
hard for us on the inside to understand, 
but it is a process that, after a period 
of time, yields the results. 
So as I was visiting with fellow Sen-
ators, I overheard somebody say: I am 
not really sure how we got here. How 
did we get to this point? 
Well, I tell you, it wasn’t magic. It 
wasn’t magic that produced a legisla-
tive package that, again, is historic in 
its funding for roads, rails, bridges, 
ports, ferries, and waterways. It was 
certainly not an accident that nego-
tiated this 2,700-page document that 
works to meet the broadband needs of 
Americans, particularly in unserved or 
underserved parts of the country, like 
my State in Alaska. 
It also wasn’t inevitable that this in-
frastructure deal would come together, 
and yet that is all following what we 
have learned in this past year and a 
half dealing with the COVID pandemic 
and the reality that we have true dis-
parities when it comes to basic infra-
structure, like clean water, sanitation 
facilities, and energy. It was not inevi-
table that this infrastructure deal 
would come together. 
In an age of cynicism and punditry, 
we kind of grow accustomed around 
here to believing that it is hard to get 
good things done in Washington, DC, 
and that is not good for any of us. 
Those of us here in the Senate, we 
signed up to do a job. We were sent 
here to do a job. We were sent here to 
work, and that is it. That is how we 
came to be where we are: through 
work, through hard work, and through 
compromise. So it wasn’t magic; it 
wasn’t accidental; it wasn’t inevitable. 
We went to work. 
And for a time, I think we really ban-
ished the demon of faction that casts 
his scepter all too often. Alexander 
Hamilton warned us of this polarizing 
temptation. And as the champion of in-
frastructure—or they called it internal 
improvements in the days of the 
Founding Fathers—I am hoping that he 
is looking favorably on us today. 
But, again, this has not been an easy 
road, this infrastructure project. Every 
morning—those of us who were in-
volved in these negotiations—we would 
wake up not surprised to read in the 
paper or see on TV that something had 
happened outside our control that was 
designed to kill this package. 
And every day, instead of taking in 
those headlines, we saw our constitu-
ents, we heard from them, and we 
heard from the people across this coun-
try urging us to continue—people like 
Carl Uchytil, Mario Cordero, Chris 
Conner. They penned an op-ed in one of 
our Alaska newspapers, and they urged 
us to advance the bipartisan infra-
structure 
framework 
because, 
for 
them, the emphasis on what it would 
do to build out our ports and our wa-
terways were significant. 
The emails and the phone calls that 
we received reminded us of the infra-
structure and how important it is for 
industries, for the jobs, for Alaskans, 
for folks all over the country, for 
health, the future; and it reminded us 
that we have an opportunity to do 
something that actually matters in 
their lives and in their communities. 
And the other thing that I heard is 
they wanted us to do it together. Fig-
ure it out, you guys. Work together. 
When you look at the survey data that 
is out there, it is pretty resounding. 
Several different polls show 87 percent 
of Americans overwhelmingly support 
fixing infrastructure. The list of orga-
nizations that support it, everyone 
from the Associated Wire Rope Fab-
ricators to the Institute of Makers of 
Explosives, to the National Governors 
Association, to the Steel Manufactur-
ers Association, the TechNet—this bi-
partisan infrastructure package proves 
that good things can happen in Wash-
ington, DC, but that it takes work. 
It takes a majority of those of us in 
this Chamber deciding that it is better

August 9, 2021 
to get some of what our constituents 
want rather than none of it. It is better 
to make progress and actually deliver 
results to your constituents rather 
than just delivering a message. We do a 
lot of messaging around here, and, as 
my friend, the Senator from West Vir-
ginia, reminds us, a message doesn’t fix 
a pothole. 
Now, I have been disappointed that 
we haven’t been able to get some of the 
amendments that we have heard about 
today. We heard Senator SHELBY from 
Alabama talk about defense infrastruc-
ture. We have heard the Senator from 
Texas, Senator CORNYN, talk about 
flexibility to the States. We have heard 
the Senator from Pennsylvania, Sen-
ator TOOMEY, working with Senator 
WYDEN and Senator LUMMIS, on the 
cryptocurrency issue. 
So, again, is this perfect? 
No. But is it a process that has deliv-
ered us to a place where we are deliv-
ering results to the people who have 
sent us here. 
I was on the floor late last week out-
lining many of the benefits that Alas-
kans will see from this measure, but I 
want to take a few more minutes this 
afternoon to highlight just a couple of 
more in perhaps some detail. Because, 
as I have mentioned, and everyone 
knows, part of the role or the view that 
I offered in our bipartisan working 
group was to make sure that the needs 
of rural Americans were met. And this 
bill addresses some of the greatest in-
frastructure needs that, again, we see 
in rural America, but also in urban and 
everyone in between, to connect them 
in ways that we haven’t before. 
Southeast Alaska, this is the region 
of the State that I grew up in. It is an 
island and archipelago. It is not pos-
sible to travel by road from one city in 
the southeastern part of the State to 
another, for the most part. Our capital 
is not accessible by road. 
Our reality is that we either travel 
by airplane or we are traveling on the 
water. So a strong ferry system, the 
Alaska Marine Highway System, is ab-
solutely essential to local economic de-
velopment, to quality of life, to com-
munity well-being. 
There are 35 different ports along the 
Alaska Marine Highway System. This 
spans an area of 35,000 miles. 
I am only looking at my colleague 
from Delaware because we have been 
working on the ferry initiative, and he 
is proud of the ferry system that he has 
there. But I have a lot of water that I 
have to cover, and it makes it chal-
lenging. It makes it challenging. But it 
is no different than Delaware, in terms 
of the significance that these small fer-
ries can offer to people as they are 
moving their families around, as they 
are moving the basketball team, as 
they are going to Costco in Juneau and 
then delivering them to Hoonah. 
To those military who are PCSing, 
going outside of the State, they have 
to move their families and all their 
goods and the dogs and the trucks, and 
they have to get out of town. And they 
get out by way of the ferry. 
It is easy to compare Alaska’s ferry 
to an urban bus or subway system or 
other form of mass transit that re-
ceives operation support. But until 
now, because Alaska’s communities are 
rural and not urban, our ferry system 
hasn’t been eligible for any meaningful 
Federal support for its operations. 
There has been some Federal funding 
available through allocation formula 
or grant program to the ferry system 
for construction and maintenance, but 
now ferry operators will be able to use 
funding for construction, maintenance, 
repairs, and operations costs. 
In so many parts of Alaska, the Ma-
rine Highway System is the only high-
way. It is the only highway. So it is 
truly an essential mode of transpor-
tation. 
When you come from a State where 
over 80 percent of your communities 
are not connected by road, again, you 
figure it out. It is air. It is on the 
ocean. It is in the rivers. But, more 
often than not, our transportation is 
not roads. 
So to make sure that we are address-
ing this essential sector of transpor-
tation, we included language that es-
tablishes a program for essential ferry 
service to support our rural commu-
nities. So through this program, the 
Department of Transportation will be 
able to provide funds to the States to 
provide for essential ferry service. 
We are also looking forward, as we 
think about how our ferries move, how 
our schoolbuses move, how our vehicles 
move, and we know that this adminis-
tration has moved very aggressively 
when it comes to EVs. There is lan-
guage in this bill that helps to facili-
tate that. 
But, again, when you are thinking 
about what is on the roads—electrifica-
tion of our vehicles, our schoolbuses, or 
our city buses—let’s not forget what I 
just referred to, and that is these, ef-
fectively, buses that are on the water. 
So what are we doing to electrify or to 
look to alternative fuels for our fer-
ries? 
This is not a new concept. In the 
Scandinavian countries, where, again, 
hydropower is in great abundance, as it 
is in southeast Alaska, an electric 
ferry system makes sense. So we are 
kind of pushing out on this to buildout 
this notion, this concept, that we can 
reduce emissions with our ferries by 
using alternative fuels or onboard en-
ergy storage systems, other related 
charging infrastructure, again, to re-
duce our emissions or produce zero on-
board emissions under normal oper-
ations. 
So folks in Skagway and Haines are 
looking at this with great interest be-
cause they view that as a real oppor-
tunity. Diesel doesn’t come cheap up 
there, and that is what moves these 
ferries around. These communities, 
Skagway, are powered by hydro. So 
let’s pull this all together. 
I have mentioned the potential for 
EV and low-emitting ferries, but I am 
reminded that the United States has 
and will continue to be a leader in en-
ergy production. We certainly know 
that in my State. And we are going to 
need to continue being an energy su-
perpower. As we are continuing to ad-
vance as a society, we are going to be 
using more energy, we are going to be 
using more electricity, and, yes, we are 
going to need to produce much of it in 
the good, old-fashion way for a long 
time to come. But electricity is becom-
ing increasingly important. It is vital 
to so many facets of modern life, and 
this bipartisan infrastructure package 
takes that electrified future into ac-
count. 
So looking at the different ways that 
it enhances the broader energy system 
by investing in next-generation clean 
energy production, there are three ex-
amples that I will just cite that are 
pertinent to Alaska. 
There is funding for advanced nuclear 
reactors, including ‘‘micro’’ reactors. 
You might not think about Alaska and 
nuclear or ‘‘micro,’’ but it holds great 
promise for deployment in certain 
rural and remote areas. 
We also provide for funding for hy-
dropower and marine energy research. 
We have a great Hydrokinetic Energy 
Research Center at the University of 
Alaska Fairbanks. 
We provide for renewable energy 
projects, 
including 
geothermal. 
We 
have pioneered in this. In fact, we have 
the Secretary of Energy, who is going 
to be visiting the State shortly and 
who will have an opportunity to look 
specifically at low-temperature geo-
thermal, as well as promising opportu-
nities that we have in the Aleutians. 
More energy production from more 
types of energy means greater resil-
ience, greater affordability, greater ac-
cess to reduced emissions. So let’s con-
sider the ways the bill directly impacts 
the electric grid and the power sector— 
three areas, again, that are pertinent 
to Alaska and to rural areas. 
We have included a measure that I 
had introduced, the PROTECT Act, 
which authorizes funding to improve 
our cyber defenses in smaller commu-
nities. I think we recognize that we 
have a big focus on the bigger commu-
nities, but your utilities in your small-
er communities still have to provide 
for that cyberprotection. 
The bill also sets aside grants for 
small utilities, like we have in Alaska, 
to prevent outages, to enhance resil-
ience, for hardening of the grid. This is 
going to help in preventing wildfires 
that can be caused by powerlines or 
other disruptive events. We are talking 
about weatherization, fire prevention 
systems, installing equipment under-
ground, maintaining utility poles and 
powerlines. 
We also provide support for rural and 
remote areas in many communities in 
the State for the modernization of gen-
eration, transmission, and distribution. 
So this is going to help the cost effec-
tiveness. It is going to help with en-
ergy efficiency, microgrids, siting and 
upgrading, as we shift to cleaner 
sources of energy.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S6089 
August 9, 2021 
Again, I think it is important to rec-
ognize that we are working to not only 
address the transmission but distribu-
tion, generation, and what we are real-
ly looking to do is look toward the fu-
ture—a future in which we will need 
more energy production, more elec-
tricity, more batteries, and a more se-
cure grid. 
And as we are doing this, as we are 
building this all out, I want to make 
sure that we do ensure that all Ameri-
cans are included in this energy and in-
frastructure transition. 
And I speak specifically now to our 
Alaska Indian, American Indian, and 
Native people around the country. This 
bill—this 
Infrastructure 
Investment 
and Jobs Act—is really a historic 
achievement for all of us who are con-
cerned with American Indian, Alaskan 
Native Tribes, and villages. 
I am the vice chair of the Senate In-
dian Affairs Committee, and I have 
worked hard to make sure that Indian 
Country’s voices have been heard. 
Let’s look at the Indian Health Serv-
ice. It has a vital sanitation construc-
tion program. We are talking about 
water and wastewater, things that 
most of us just take for granted. We 
provide $3.5 billion in funding for 
American Indian, Alaska Native Tribes 
and villages to complete all—all—of 
the 
identified 
sanitation 
projects. 
These are projects that have been on 
the books for way, way too long. 
I am reminded by my friend Val Da-
vidson of the Alaska Native Tribal 
Health Consortium. She testified be-
fore our Indian Affairs Committee 
about both the funding needed in Na-
tive communities and sanitation’s real-
ly significant impact on health. She 
shared a story—her own personal story 
but also a statistic—that one in three 
infants in communities from her region 
without adequate sanitation are hos-
pitalized in their first year simply be-
cause they lack basic water and sanita-
tion services. And it is not just a visit 
to a hospital as an infant that is scary, 
but so many then develop long-term 
health problems, which are absolutely 
unacceptable. 
Any infrastructure bill has to live up 
to our Federal Government’s trust ob-
ligations to our Tribes. This is vital to 
allowing Tribes access to water for 
their health and for their livelihood. So 
within the bill, we provide $2.5 billion 
to fund Indian water settlements. 
Now, outside the legal world, most 
people know Indian water settlements 
by the term ‘‘water rights.’’ But the 
outstanding settlements include the 
Aamodt, 
the 
Crow, 
Navajo-Gallup, 
White Mountain Apache, Blackfeet Na-
tion, Navajo Utah, Confederated Salish 
and Kootenai Tribes, and the Arizona 
Water Settlement Act. So this funding 
is going to complete the balance of 
each and every one of these settle-
ments. 
We also provide $250 million for the 
Bureau of Indian Affairs to help build 
and repair irrigation, power, and sani-
tation systems, because you have to be 
able to move clean water from one 
place to another and keep it clean and 
be able to use it productively. 
We provide grants for Native village 
firefighting training, resilient trans-
portation 
infrastructure, 
a 
Native 
Youth Public Land Corps to restore 
and protect ecosystems, adaptation 
projects for climate change impacts, 
and funding for a new program to pro-
vide Indian Tribes grants to clean up 
orphan wells. 
There is more included in this. There 
is a $110 million ‘‘set aside’’ for Tribal 
bridge investments. There is the Tribal 
Transportation Program and eligibility 
for grants under advanced energy and 
battery manufacturing and recycling 
programs. 
We are really looking to ensure that 
we are prioritizing infrastructure needs 
in Tribal areas. 
I haven’t mentioned broadband, but 
it is absolutely significant. We know 
that broadband deployment on Tribal 
lands has lagged far behind the rest of 
the Nation. So to address this, the bill 
includes an additional $2 billion for 
Tribal broadband connectivity grants. 
We have heard it on this floor by all 
of us, Republicans and Democrats, 
urban 
and 
rural. 
We 
know 
that 
broadband 
is 
vital 
to 
education, 
healthcare, 
economic 
development, 
self-governance. It applies absolutely 
across the board as we think of the 
needs in Indian Country. 
I think we know that the Federal fi-
nancing provisions, the dollars going 
forward, are significant. But we also 
know that it is not just about the fund-
ing. It is about making these programs 
work better. So we do things like re-
quiring expedited environmental re-
view for Tribal transportation safety 
projects. We streamline categorical ex-
clusions by empowering the Tribes in 
relation to the Federal Government. 
Within the middle mile grants, there 
is consultation with Tribes on a proc-
ess to designate tribally unserved and 
underserved areas. 
So there is so much that we have 
really focused on in ensuring that Alas-
ka Natives, American Indians, and our 
Native people around the country are 
included in these many provisions as 
they relate to infrastructure, including 
grid infrastructure, resilience, and reli-
ability. 
So I have spoken for a while now on 
three specific areas that I have chosen 
to highlight: certainly, within marine 
transportation, the benefits that places 
like Alaska will see; the significance of 
energy production and what this infra-
structure bill will provide there; and 
benefits to our Native peoples around 
the country. 
I want to conclude my comments by 
ending with where I began, which is to 
acknowledge the efforts of so many 
who have really gotten us here today, 
not through a miracle, not through an 
accident, not through an inevitability 
but just through hard work. 
I am very pleased to have been part 
of this group, really honored to work 
with such hard-working people and 
their teams, led by Senator SINEMA, 
who just spoke, and Senator PORTMAN. 
Their leadership has been, in my view, 
really extraordinary. The work that 
they have put behind managing us all 
to this point deserves the recognition. 
I also want to acknowledge the good 
work of the chairman and the ranking 
member on the Environment and Pub-
lic Works Committee, Senator CARPER 
and Senator CAPITO, who really laid 
the base for so much of this bill. So to 
the G–10 and the broader G–22, all those 
who have contributed so much, I con-
vey my thanks. 
I also want to acknowledge col-
leagues on the other side of the Capitol 
here, those who are known as the Prob-
lem Solvers over there. They really 
have jumped in, rolled up their sleeves, 
and helped us in solving problems when 
it comes to this infrastructure pack-
age. 
And I am looking forward to being 
able to move this legislation, this 
package, from this body tomorrow, to 
send it over to the House so that they 
can then pick up those efforts. 
But I am pleased that we have come 
to this place, after a long process, after 
a tough process but one where we were 
really able to focus on common goals 
that we identified at the outset, and we 
really held true to; that we were going 
to be dealing with core infrastructure, 
core infrastructure. 
We agreed that we were not going to 
impose new taxes. We agreed that we 
needed to ensure that the spending 
pay-fors were true and legitimate. We 
agreed that long-term spending on in-
frastructure needed to improve our Na-
tion’s efficiency, our productivity, our 
GDP, and our revenue and not increase 
inflation. 
And we have achieved that. We set 
out these parameters, and we achieved 
it. But we did it with a lot of give and 
a lot of take. 
So while the end product is not some-
thing that any one of us individually 
would have written, I am very proud to 
be able to support what we have 
worked to bring to this body, again, 
with the help and hard work and col-
laboration of so, so many Members. 
I am disappointed that immediately 
after we advance this bill tomorrow, 
the infrastructure package, that we 
will turn to a wholly partisan exercise, 
one that, in my view, taxes and spends 
without limit, a wish list that really 
knows no limit. 
But, for now, let’s move to this infra-
structure bill. Let’s get it to the 
House. Let’s do what people in Alaska, 
what people in Illinois, what people 
around the country have asked us to 
do, and that is to address our Nation’s 
competitiveness, 
our 
Nation’s 
effi-
ciency, and our Nation’s advantages by 
securing and ensuring that we are able 
to move, to connect, and to provide for 
our country’s needs. 
With that, I yield the floor.

August 9, 2021 
BUDGET RECONCILIATION 
Mr. BROWN. Madam President, I rise 
to urge my colleagues to support the 
budget resolution immediately after 
the infrastructure vote tomorrow. 
I particularly am glad to see the Pre-
siding Officer in the Chair today. Ear-
lier I spoke on this floor about the in-
frastructure bill and her efforts—Sen-
ator DUCKWORTH from Illinois, her ef-
forts—to ensure disabled-access transit 
stops. 
We still have far too many transit 
stops in this country in big cities like 
hers in Chicago and mine in Cleveland 
and Philadelphia and New York and all 
over that are not accessible, and that 
has got to be our mission. 
I chair the Banking, Housing, and 
Urban Affairs Committee. Most people 
call it just the Banking Committee. In 
reality, it is the housing, banking, and 
transit committee. And that is our re-
sponsibility to move in the right direc-
tion, and we are moving there rapidly. 
And I thank Senator DUCKWORTH for 
her work on that. 
I want to talk not long. I know that 
Senator CARDIN is awaiting and has 
been patient, and I believe that Sen-
ator INHOFE might be here too. 
This week we have moved forward a 
bill to provide critical investments in 
transportation infrastructure. I am 
glad we are doing that. The next step is 
to address housing. 
Nothing is more important than 
housing. As chair of the Banking and 
Housing Committee, I have held hear-
ings about housing needs across the 
country. This committee, called Bank-
ing, Housing, and Urban Affairs—most 
refer to it as ‘‘Senate Banking’’—has 
been mostly about Wall Street in the 
past and not nearly enough about hous-
ing. Those issues are changing. 
I know Senator CARDIN knows—and 
not just in Baltimore but in Western 
Maryland and everywhere, as in urban 
Ohio and rural Ohio—how important 
housing is. We hear repeatedly about 
the shortage of affordable housing, 
about wide disparities in access to 
home ownership. 
This isn’t just about a few coastal 
cities. We heard from mayors in Akron, 
OH; in Bozeman, MT, Senator TESTER’s 
State; in Tempe, AZ, about their hous-
ing needs. Their markets vary. In Boze-
man, home prices are up 50 percent. It 
is almost impossible for a young family 
to find a place to live. In Akron, home 
values are sometimes too low to find fi-
nancing, and banks tell us they can’t 
make a profit on selling a $60,000, 
$70,000, $80,000 mortgage on a $60,000, 
$70,000, $80,000 house. 
Their issues are different, but all 
three mayors told us they need the 
Federal Government to be a better 
partner in helping to invest in their 
housing and in their communities. 
Without 
housing 
investment, 
there 
cannot be economic growth. That is be-
cause housing—by any real definition, 
housing is infrastructure. 
Where you live determines so much 
about your life: where your kids go to 
school, how far you have to go to work, 
what kind of jobs you get. It deter-
mines where you do your grocery shop-
ping and whether you have access to 
fresh fruits and vegetables; whether 
your kids are exposed, as they are in 
far too many old neighborhoods— 
whether it is Appalachia, Southern Illi-
nois, or whether in Ohio or whether it 
is Cleveland or Chicago—too often to 
hazardous lead or mold. 
We saw over the past year that hous-
ing certainly affects our health. Peo-
ple’s paychecks have not kept up with 
the cost of living, particularly the cost 
of rent. 
Senator SANDERS, earlier today—and 
this was before the pandemic, what he 
was talking about, that 25 percent of 
American renters pay more than half 
their income in rent. One thing goes 
wrong in their lives—their car breaks 
down, their child gets sick, they miss 3 
days of work because of a minor in-
jury—and 
everything 
turns 
upside 
down for them. This is even more of a 
problem, of course, for Black and 
Latino renters, with little left over 
each month for food and medication, 
let alone saving. 
It is not just renters. Today, more 
than one in five homeowners still pay 
more than one-third of their income in 
rent. And the Black ownership rate— 
this is pretty unbelievable. The Black 
ownership rate is as low as it was 
when, in 1968, this body finally passed 
open housing, finally passed fair hous-
ing. 
The first Secretary of HUD, after we 
passed the fair housing law, was Sen-
ator ROMNEY’s father, George Romney. 
As hard as he tried—partly because the 
President, his boss, followed a southern 
strategy—he did very little in the end, 
could accomplish very little for hous-
ing equality. 
We are the wealthiest country in the 
world. We have half a million people, 
including 100,000 children, without a 
place to stay on a given night. 
The budget resolution on the floor 
tomorrow will finally make the invest-
ment we need to help more families 
find and afford a place that they can 
call home. Think of the word ‘‘home.’’ 
It helps us provide funding to make 
critical repairs to our Nation’s public 
housing, to make it more sustainable, 
to save families money, to reduce 
harmful effects on our climate. It helps 
provide affordable places for families 
and seniors to rent, including in rural 
areas, and helps more families become 
first-time homeowners. 
It will help communities invest in 
their neighborhoods, including Brown 
and Black communities who have been 
left out of our Nation’s recovery. It 
will make their homes more resilient 
in the face of changing climate. Com-
munities will have housing and transit 
investments that work together to 
bring down the cost of daily commutes, 
to reduce harmful effects on our cli-
mate. 
With the resolution before us tomor-
row, we have an opportunity to make 
people’s lives better and to give local 
economies the chance to grow. We can 
expand access to affordable rentals. We 
will make it easier to purchase a home. 
We will put tradespeople to work in 
good-paying, often union jobs, building 
housing and making it safer and mak-
ing it resilient. 
I urge my colleagues to support this 
long-overdue investment in our homes, 
in our communities, and in our work-
ers. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Oklahoma. 
WESTERN SAHARA 
Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, I 
know we have all been talking about 
what is going to happen in the next 2 
days, and it is very significant, the 
things that have to take place. 
But I want to remind some people 
out there that it doesn’t mean that ev-
erything else stops. We have a couple 
of issues that are major issues but not 
to really large numbers of people. But 
they are issues that are meaningful— 
very meaningful—to a few, and it hap-
pens that there has been progress in 
both of these. 
Now, one of them is an issue that has 
to do with Western Sahara. And I know 
that a lot of people are not really fa-
miliar with that or what the issue is, 
but it is an old issue. It has been 
around since 1966. It is a very signifi-
cant issue. It is one that you have 
heard me talk about for quite some 
time, but we have made some great 
progress. 
First of all, it bears repeating be-
cause—they are called the Sahrawis. 
The Sahrawis are the people from 
Western Sahara, and they are kind of a 
voiceless people. That is why I am 
here—because nobody else is here on 
that. 
So how we got here: As West Africa 
was being decolonized, Western Sahara 
was clear and declared an independent 
nation, despite Morocco attempting to 
claim it as a territory. 
In 1966, the U.N. General Assembly 
resolution agreed that the referendum 
of self-determination should be held. 
That is the U.N. General Assembly. 
There was no disagreement at that 
time except from Morocco. Everyone 
was in agreement. In fact, at that time, 
Morocco was even in agreement. This 
is 1966. And we were going to have a de-
termination in the form of a ref-
erendum that would be taking place in 
1975. So it was 1966, planning for 1975. 
Self-determination is just merely let-
ting the Sahrawi people decide for 
themselves the imperative principle of 
action, the right to judge for them-
selves to be independent or to be a part 
of Morocco. Now, this was just the first 
promise of a referendum. To date, none 
has been kept. 
The International Court of Justice 
opinion from 1975 also agreed that Mo-
rocco did not have any sovereignty 
over the land and that the referendum 
of self-determination should be held. 
So you have the International Court of

Justice agreeing with this, the U.N. 
General Assembly—all in agreement. 
Morocco 
maintained 
its 
unlawful 
claim to Western Sahara and, after 
decolonization, attempted to annex the 
country with force. Western Sahara— 
officially the Sahrawi Arab Democratic 
Republic—through the Polisario, de-
fended their rights to the land. 
And after more than a decade of vio-
lence from Morocco, the United Na-
tions finally intervened in 1991, and 
both sides agreed to a cease-fire and a 
path forward. That was 1991. It was 
called at that time the Settlement 
Plan. It solidified that Morocco and 
Western Sahara agreed to hold a ref-
erendum and a date for that ref-
erendum and created the United Na-
tions Mission for the Referendum to so-
lidify this. 
If you are keeping track, that was 
the third promise. And it is worth not-
ing that the U.N. regularly reaffirms 
the 1991 commitment to a referendum 
for self-determination. 
Now, self-determination is something 
that people assume there is not opposi-
tion to. Self-determination is some-
thing that is very meaningful to us and 
our history in this country, and this is 
something that at that time was ac-
cepted. 
I can remember talking several times 
in 
previous 
administrations, 
going 
back to the Reagan administration, 
and people were, at that time, knowing 
that this was going to happen but just 
didn’t know for sure how it was going 
to happen or when it was going to hap-
pen. And here it is now decades later, 
and it hasn’t happened yet. 
The referendum for 1992 never took 
place, and the process stalled. The 
process stalled, although the cease-fire 
held. Morocco just wouldn’t hold up its 
end of the bargain. 
Former Secretary of State James 
Baker—I remember when the previous 
administration came in, James Baker 
had read someplace that I was con-
cerned about this issue. This old issue 
had never been resolved, and he called 
me up, and he said: Well, I want you to 
know that I spent a lot of years with 
three different Presidents trying to get 
this done. We were unable to do it, but 
let me work with you. 
This is one of these rare things where 
everyone agrees. 
So, anyway, they had a special envoy 
to Western Sahara. Baker worked on 
multiple plans with Morocco and West-
ern Sahara and came close many times, 
but it never happened. 
Most notable is the Houston agree-
ment was signed by Morocco and West-
ern Sahara and recommitted to a ref-
erendum of self-determination plan for 
1998. That would have been the fourth 
time. Morocco recognized they would 
likely lose a vote quickly and tanked 
all negotiations. The next year, by dec-
laration, they would never accept a ref-
erendum that included independence as 
an outcome despite years of promise 
otherwise. 
The conflict stalled then, leaving us 
in what is called a frozen conflict for 
more than two decades. At the end of 
last year—November, to be precise— 
Morocco tried to violently crush a 
peaceful protest in the Gujarat area. 
The Western Saharans were peacefully 
protesting Morocco’s direct violation 
of the United Nations’ cease-fire agree-
ment by using the road in this direc-
tion. 
The international community did 
nothing. Then truly the worst thing 
happened. There was a change in policy 
of the United States that had been a 
policy for some three decades where 
they actually were recognizing Moroc-
co’s sovereignty. That decision was 
wrong. It reversed decades of U.S. pol-
icy. But the policy held until 1966. It 
was a shocking announcement and 
deeply disturbing to all who valued in-
dividual rights and self-determination. 
That is why earlier this year Senator 
LEAHY and I led 25 of our colleagues in 
a bipartisan letter to President Biden 
urging him to reverse the harmful pol-
icy and to recommit to a policy of self- 
determination. This is something that 
I know that he recognizes. I actually 
personally talked to him about this in 
his first week in office. It hasn’t been 
done yet, and it should be done. Many 
of our colleagues and I are not alone in 
our push for Western Sahara to have 
the right for self-determination. So 
does the African Union, which is com-
prised of 55 member states. We have 
most of the European community who 
supports the U.N. efforts on our side. 
The European Court of Justice also 
ruled that Western Sahara is not a part 
of Morocco, and the EU and the eco-
nomic agreements can cover Western 
Sahara. 
So, anyway, this has happened over 
and over again for a long period of 
time. Just fairly recently, Sultana 
Khaya had a CNN—I am actually going 
to wind this up with an agreement with 
my friend from Maryland—this is the 
statement that she made. She said: 
Morocco’s repression of the Sahrawi peo-
ple, and Sahrawi human rights defenders in 
particular, is well documented. The Sahrawis 
have struggled under Moroccan occupation 
since 1975, and this repression will continue 
until the occupation is ended. And while the 
United Nations Security Council supports 
giving the people of Western Sahara the 
chance 
to 
determine 
their 
own 
future 
through a referendum, Morocco has refused 
to allow the referendum to take place, de-
priving us of the chance . . . [for] self-deter-
mination. 
She concluded by saying: 
I cannot find the words to describe the end-
less suffering that I personally, and the 
Sahrawi people more generally, have en-
dured under this violent occupation. 
They are resolute, and we should be 
too. 
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the 
RECORD, as follows: 
[From CNN, July 29, 2021] 
I’VE BEEN RAPED, BEATEN AND HELD UNDER 
HOUSE
ARREST
FOR
FIGHTING
FOR
MY 
SAHRAWI PEOPLE 
(Opinion by Sultana Sidibrahim Khaya) 
Earlier this month, the Biden administra-
tion reaffirmed the United States’ recogni-
tion of Morocco’s sovereignty over Western 
Sahara, a disputed region on the northwest 
coast of Africa. The United Nations calls 
Western Sahara a ‘‘non-self-governing terri-
tory’’; I call it home. My home is under occu-
pation and my people, the Sahrawis, are 
under attack, and the US position on West-
ern Sahara legitimizes this occupation and 
will be used as license for further attacks. I 
know this because I have lived it. 
As an outspoken advocate for self-deter-
mination in Western Sahara, I have long 
been a target for the occupying Moroccan 
government. I have been beaten, tortured, 
and abducted by Moroccan police while en-
gaged in peaceful protests; after a particu-
larly violent assault in 2007, I lost my right 
eye. 
Because I refuse to be silenced, Morocco 
stepped up its efforts against me late last 
year. On November 19, while driving to my 
home in Boujdour, I was stopped at a police 
and military checkpoint. The authorities 
forced me into a police car and took me to a 
nearby police station, where I was interro-
gated, sexually assaulted, and told to go 
home and not to speak to anyone. I arrived 
home soon thereafter to find it surrounded 
by 21 police vehicles and numerous officers, 
who physically pushed me into the house. I 
have been forcibly confined to the house ever 
since. My de facto house arrest, which is now 
in its ninth month, has absolutely no legal 
basis—I have never been shown a court order 
authorizing my detention or informed of any 
criminal charges against me. 
The Moroccan government has told Am-
nesty International that I’m not under house 
arrest and denied a statement by the UN 
Special Rapporteur on the situation of 
Human Rights Defenders that included de-
tails of the assaults, saying that the 
rapporteur’s statement ‘‘interferes with the 
ongoing debates in the framework of the 47th 
Session of the Human Rights Council’’ and 
‘‘do not fit at all with the framework of dia-
logue and mutual respect’’ it expected at the 
UN. Meanwhile, the occupying Moroccan 
forces appear determined to not just detain 
me unlawfully, but to harass, torture, and 
perhaps even kill me. 
Moroccan police, military, and other secu-
rity agents maintain a constant presence 
outside the house and prevent anyone from 
leaving or coming in, even to bring food. 
They cut the electricity in mid-April. Police 
throw a toxic, foulsmelling liquid into the 
house on a near-daily basis, making it dif-
ficult to breathe. They frequently (and ex-
plicitly) threaten to kill me. 
Moroccan authorities have also repeatedly 
raided the home and brutally assaulted me, 
my sister. my brother, and my mother. In 
May, during one such raid, Moroccan agents 
raped my sister and I—in a barbaric message, 
they penetrated my sister using the broom-
stick that we use to wave the Western Sa-
hara flag. Despite all this, I continue to wave 
the Western Sahara flag from my rooftop 
every day—an act of resistance that may end 
up costing me my life. 
Unfortunately, my story is just one of 
many. Morocco’s repression of the Sahrawi 
people, and Sahrawi human rights defenders 
in particular, is well documented. The 
Sahrawis have struggled under Moroccan oc-
cupation since 1975, and as recently as July 
1, the State Department reiterated that 
there is no change in the administration’s 
policy. 
The 
Biden 
administration 
has 
claimed that human rights are central to its 
foreign policy—this is difficult to believe 
while it sides with Morocco in its occupation 
of Western Sahara and its repression of the 
Sahrawi people. 
Second, as part of its reengagement with 
the United Nations Human Rights Council, 
the US should press forcefully for a ref-
erendum on self-determination in Western

Sahara. The U.N. General Assembly re-
affirmed the right to self-determination of 
the people of Western Sahara as far back as 
1966, when it was still referred to as ‘‘Spanish 
Sahara,’’ and the U.N. Security Council 
unanimously established a mission to coordi-
nate a referendum on self-determination for 
the people of Western Sahara in 1991. 
The US, for its part, has consistently voted 
in favor of Security Council resolutions 
seeking a referendum on self-determination. 
Since President Biden has advocated for a re-
turn to a rule-based international order, the 
US should take the lead to ensure that the 
long-promised referendum is finally held and 
the results are honored. 
And third, the U.S. should make the pro-
tection of human rights in occupied Western 
Sahara 
and 
self-determination 
for 
the 
Sahrawi people key issues in its bilateral re-
lationship with Morocco. For example, the 
readout from a recent call between US Sec-
retary of State Antony Blinken and Moroc-
can Foreign Minister Nasser Bourita shows 
that while Blinken encouraged Morocco to 
reaffirm its commitment to human rights, 
the readout omitted any mention of Western 
Sahara or the right of its people to self-de-
termination. 
For any productive change to occur, Mo-
rocco needs to know that its powerful allies 
care about both. 
I cannot find the words to describe the end-
less suffering that I personally, and the 
Sahrawi people more generally, have en-
dured under this violent occupation, But we 
remain strong, our will unshaken, and we 
will persevere with our peaceful resistance. 
Mr. INHOFE. With this, I would like 
to offer my friend, since he has been 
waiting for a long period of time, to 
use the remainder of my time if he will 
then yield the floor to me at the con-
clusion. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Maryland. 
Mr. CARDIN. Madam President, I 
thank my friend from Oklahoma. The 
two of us arrived in the House of Rep-
resentatives on the same day. We have 
been friends for all this period of time. 
I thank him for his generosity. 
BUDGET RECONCILIATION 
Madam President, I take this time to 
talk about legislation we will be con-
sidering tomorrow, which will be the 
budget resolution. It gives us a once-in- 
a-generation opportunity. 
I would just like to pause for a mo-
ment because it is part of President 
Biden’s Build Back Better, that we can 
have a more competitive nation, and 
we can create the jobs that we need for 
the future. 
I was with Secretary Blinken earlier 
today in College Park, and he talked 
specifically about the challenges our 
Nation faces. We go back a generation 
ago, and America was clearly in the 
forefront of creating jobs, of taking ad-
vantage of all innovation and new, 
emerging fields. We were the envy of 
the world. Today, the rest of the world 
has caught up and in some cases, ex-
ceeds us. 
This 
once-in-a-generation 
oppor-
tunity to build back better gives us an 
opportunity to do what we need to do 
for America’s future and to show the 
world that our free market, democratic 
society is the best way to take care of 
its people. 
This is an incredibly important part 
to deliver on President Biden’s Build 
Back Better. We already did with the 
American Rescue Plan. That gave us 
the opportunity to get the COVID–19 
vaccines distributed so we can get that 
behind us. It helped our State and local 
governments. It took half of our chil-
dren out of poverty. In Maryland, 52,000 
Maryland children were taken out of 
poverty. Forty million families nation-
wide benefited from the child credit 
and the earned income tax credit. We 
took a major step forward in building 
back better with the passage of the 
American Rescue Plan. 
Tomorrow, with the passage of this 
bipartisan infrastructure package, we 
will take the second step in building 
back better, and there is a lot to be 
celebrated in the legislation that we 
will pass tomorrow. 
I was proud to work on the transpor-
tation and water infrastructure issues, 
along with my colleague who is pre-
siding, to make sure that we provided 
the building blocks necessary for mod-
ern infrastructure—for transportation, 
for roads, bridges, transit systems, and 
our water infrastructure, which is 
critically important. 
We will take a second step to build 
back better with the passage of the bi-
partisan bill, but there is a third step 
that is critically important, and that is 
the budget resolution we will be taking 
up starting tomorrow. 
The budget resolution takes us be-
yond COVID–19. Yes, we have to rebuild 
from COVID–19, but we also need to re-
build our Nation, make it modern and 
provide the needs that Americans need. 
The budget resolution will provide 
America more competitiveness, better 
prepared for the future, create jobs, 
millions of jobs, and lower the cost for 
Americans in dealing with their every-
day needs. We are asking the wealthier 
people to pay their fair share—first of 
all, to pay their taxes, and then pay 
their fair share of taxes. We tackle the 
climate crisis, and we develop the 
workforce to meet the jobs of the fu-
ture. 
So I am very excited about the oppor-
tunity of taking up the budget resolu-
tion. Let me just comment on a few 
specifics as chair of the Senate Small 
Business and Entrepreneurship Com-
mittee. I expect we will be given budg-
et instructions to deal with those 
issues. 
Madam President, you are part of 
that group. We need to look at access 
to credit, investment, and markets, 
particularly in underserved commu-
nities, those that have not had the op-
portunities in the past. I am talking 
about women-owned small businesses, 
minority-owned small businesses, vet-
eran-owned small businesses, and en-
trepreneurs from other underserved 
communities. 
We are going take a look at govern-
ment contracting. The United States is 
the largest purveyor of goods and serv-
ices of the world. How can we improve 
that in building back better to make 
sure all are included in that oppor-
tunity? 
We are going to look at innovation 
and growth. Small businesses are the 
innovator of our economy. They create 
a better way to do things. We saw that 
during COVID–19. We get more innova-
tion from small businesses than from 
the larger companies. But as we look 
at emerging markets, there has been a 
real separation between the under-
served communities not being able to 
participate in new, emerging markets. 
When you take a look at the amount 
of venture capital that goes to minor-
ity small businesses or women-owned 
small businesses, it is a small fraction 
of their demographic numbers. The last 
time I checked, White men controlled 
93 percent of all venture capital fund-
ing. Now, I am all for everyone partici-
pating, but that is not a fair division 
and opportunity for emerging markets. 
So we need to take a look at emerg-
ing markets, incubator and accelerator 
programs, and then access to capital. 
We need direct help through the Small 
Business Administration to help small 
businesses because we know we have a 
better chance for the underserved com-
munity to get a fair shake with the 
SBA controlling the loans. We also 
need to have partnerships with the pri-
vate sector, as we have seen in pro-
grams like the SBIC Program and 
other programs. 
So we are going to work as a com-
mittee to try to deal with the needs 
particularly of those small businesses 
that have been left behind in the past. 
I also serve on the Environment of 
Public Works Committee and chair the 
Subcommittee on Infrastructure, work-
ing with the Presiding Officer. I men-
tion this because both of us have been 
directly involved in creating new pro-
grams to help underserved commu-
nities. 
There is a program that I was in-
volved with that deals with water af-
fordability, a pilot program that will 
allow those who cannot afford their 
clean water bills help from govern-
ment, as we do for utility costs. That 
was included in the bipartisan package 
but not the funding. I am hoping that 
we will have the opportunity to fund 
that program and to fund other pro-
grams that we deal with in underserved 
communities, the water projects; that 
we will be able to deal with that in the 
Environment and Public Works Com-
mittee in the budget resolution. 
We are going to deal with climate, 
and we need to deal with climate. In-
vestments in jobs and growth and deal-
ing with the environment go together, 
and we are finding that America is not 
as far ahead internationally as other 
countries, such as China, investing a 
lot more in electric convention than 
America is investing in electric vehi-
cles. 
We are going to work with the Envi-
ronment and Public Works Committee, 
the Agriculture Committee, and the 
Commerce Committee to deal with 
coastal resiliency, which is critically

important to my State. The Chesa-
peake Bay—the iconic symbol of Mary-
land in our region, the largest estuary 
in our hemisphere—it has challenges. 
This once-in-a-generation opportunity 
gives us the opportunity to do things 
that are going to be beneficial for our 
environment and help us deal with cli-
mate change; for example, the bene-
ficial use of dredge material. We want 
to keep our channels dredged for com-
merce. It is very important. Where do 
we put that material? Well, in the 
Chesapeake Bay, we want to put it into 
restoring wetlands, creating new wet-
lands, which will help our environ-
mental issues as well. In agriculture, 
we are going to look at land conserva-
tion programs, all that are important. 
I was pleased to see that in the expla-
nation of the budget resolution, there 
is a specific reference to the Appa-
lachian Regional Commission. It is 
very important to two western coun-
ties in Maryland, and we need to do 
more to help them and their economy 
and to grow back better, and we are 
going to have an opportunity in the 
budget resolution to do exactly that. 
As I mentioned earlier, lower costs 
for Americans—childcare. We need to 
bring down the cost so Americans can 
afford childcare. 
There is extension of the child tax 
credit, the earned income tax credit, 
because we want to make sure that the 
progress we have made in lifting fami-
lies out of poverty—that we do that on 
a permanent basis. Let’s get that 
longer period of time providing that re-
lief. 
Help for high education—the cost of 
higher education is way out of line 
here in America. This bill will give us 
a chance to deal with the cost of higher 
education, 
community 
colleges, 
HBCUs, Pell Grant increases. 
I was listening to Senator BROWN 
talk about affordable housing and 
home ownership. I was with Secretary 
Fudge this week in Prince George’s 
County, MD, and we talked about tools 
that are available to help with afford-
able housing and home ownership so 
families can afford a home today. 
I am proud to cosponsor a bill with 
Senator PORTMAN, the Neighborhood 
Reinvestment Act, so that commu-
nities can do the investment in their 
community, and where there is a dif-
ference between market rate and the 
cost to do the renovation or building, 
we have a credit so that communities 
can have the type of housing commen-
surate with their needs. 
We can do a lot more. Paid family 
medical leave—we are one of the only 
countries that don’t have that. There 
is an opportunity in the budget resolu-
tion for us to be able to accomplish 
that. 
Expansion of Medicare: I have been 
trying to get Medicare to cover dental 
care for a long time. Seniors need that 
type of protection. We have a chance to 
do that in this budget resolution, along 
with 
eyeglasses 
and 
hearing 
aids, 
which should be—they are essential. 
They should be included in Medicare. 
We have a chance to do that. 
Then on the climate issue, we are 
going to have an opportunity to really 
deal with one of the greatest threats 
we have, and that is our planet is burn-
ing up. We know that. We need to take 
dramatic action in order to deal with 
the realities of climate change. We see 
it all around us. We see it in flooding in 
Maryland, wildfires out West, in flood-
ing—lands disappearing in our commu-
nity and around the world. 
We will have a chance with electric 
vehicles and transportation and re-
search. We will have a chance with the 
Tax Code to reduce carbon emissions. 
We will have a chance in public build-
ings to build green buildings and en-
ergy efficiency. We will have an oppor-
tunity for weatherization programs. 
All that is contemplated in the budget 
resolution. 
I can’t give specifics because that is 
what committees will be doing in the 
next several weeks, coming up with 
specifics to fill in. But to make this 
once-in-a-generation 
opportunity 
to 
bring down the cost to Americans, to 
deal with climate change, to deal with 
job creation and preparedness and job 
training—this is a responsible package 
that will help working families and 
have the wealthy who are not paying 
their taxes today to pay their taxes 
and pay their fair share of taxes. 
Winston Churchill remarked: 
The pessimist sees difficulty in every op-
portunity. The optimist sees the opportunity 
in every difficulty. 
I agree with Sir Winston Churchill. 
Together, we can meet the most formi-
dable challenges our Nation faces, and 
the Build Back Better budget is the 
next step in that process, and I look 
forward to our taking this resolution 
up, moving it forward, and then letting 
our committees get back to work and 
fill in the blanks and get this done in 
order that Americans can meet the 
challenges of the future, create the 
jobs we need in the future, and get the 
cost reliefs that they need to deal with 
life essential needs. 
I thank my friend from Oklahoma for 
allowing me to give my remarks. 
I yield the floor. 
Mr. INHOFE. I thank my friend. We 
worked on a lot of bills—infrastruc-
ture—together since we were both 
elected the same year many years ago 
and we accomplished a lot together. 
What I want to do is complete my re-
marks that I began a few minutes ago. 
Before I do, Madam President, I ask 
unanimous consent that during the 
course of the remarks I made con-
cerning 
Western 
Sahara, 
that 
the 
speech that was made by Sultana 
Khaya, that was published in CNN, be 
printed in the RECORD
during the 
course of my presentation. 
LIGADO 
Madam President, let me repeat what 
I said in the beginning of my previous 
remarks, and that is we are all talking 
about the same thing right now. We are 
now getting down to the last—conceiv-
ably, the last two votes that we are 
going to be having, so all of the con-
centration has been on those. 
But I want to mention two of the 
other issues that were made very pop-
ular issues and they are making great 
progress right now. Let me go ahead 
and do that for a short while, and that 
is to provide an update on the Ligado 
issue—the Ligado issue. 
Friday was inauguration day of a 
thing called the Space Beat Memo. It is 
a new weekly newsletter from POLIT-
ICO designed to focus on space and sat-
ellites. This is their inaugural, first- 
ever newsletter with a great rundown 
on—they chose the Ligado issue. 
Just to remind everyone what we are 
talking about—Ligado, L-I-G-A-D-O— 
the Ligado Order was a spectrum sale 
approved back in April of 2020, that 
would let Ligado use the L-band or the 
spectrum—that is the spectrum close 
to the GPS for commercial use. 
Why is that a problem? 
It is a problem because Ligado’s sig-
nals are about 2 billion times as power-
ful as GPS signals, so they would cause 
interference, according to all unbiased 
sources, to the GPS. 
Here is one way to put the inter-
ference into perspective: Because GPS 
signals travel from satellites in space, 
by the time those signals get to the 
Earth’s surface, they are low power. 
Because the FCC order allowed Ligado 
to repurpose spectrum to operate in a 
terrestrial-based network, Ligado sig-
nals on Earth’s surface will be much 
more powerful than GPS, causing sub-
stantial harm and interference. 
Now, we know that basically every-
one in government opposes this. We 
talked about this now since the last 
time—just June 23, down here on the 
floor. Shortly after the Ligado Order 
was announced in April of 2020, the 
NTIA filed a petition to reconsider—ba-
sically, a petition asking them to re-
consider their decision again, given the 
negative impact it would have. This 
was signed on behalf of some 15 govern-
mental Agencies. 
The NTIA is the National Tele-
communications Information Adminis-
tration. They are an Agency within the 
Department of Commerce that serves 
as the President’s primary adviser on 
telecom policies. 
As I announced on June 23, I recently 
received a letter from Secretary of 
Commerce Gina Raimondo confirming 
that—and I’m quoting now—‘‘there has 
been no change to the Department of 
Commerce’s or NTIA’s opposition to 
the FCC’s Ligado Order.’’ 
That is a direct quote. That is the 
new administration. We know the last 
administration 
believed 
the 
same 
thing, and this administration is fol-
lowing on this cause. It is a very sig-
nificant one. 
She also pledged that NTIA will con-
tinue to pursue the petition for recon-
sideration. The petition represents the 
Departments of Commerce, Defense, 
Interior, Justice, Homeland Security, 
Energy, Transportation, NASA, FAA,

and more. This is primarily the entire 
government. This is huge. 
It showed, once again, that there is a 
bipartisan opposition to the Ligado 
Order that is continuing into the Biden 
administration. 
But that is not all I am doing. I am 
also introducing the RETAIN GPS Act, 
which would ensure Federal Agencies, 
State governments, and all others neg-
atively impacted—all that were nega-
tively impacted by Ligado’s activi-
ties—by the actions of a private actor 
are not left holding the bag when the 
costs start coming in and, worse, are 
not put in a position where they have 
to push the costs onto the American 
consumers. 
The House has introduced legislation 
as well, led by Representatives COOPER, 
MIKE TURNER, FRANK LUCAS, and oth-
ers. It is just common sense and only 
fair. 
As David Grossman, the Executive 
Director of GPS Innovation Alliance, 
said to POLITICO: 
The RETAIN Act— 
Talking about the act that I have in-
troduced— 
is just extending those protections that the 
FCC recognized were critical for Federal 
Agency GPS systems on the civil side. 
In other words, if we are going to 
protect government, protect individ-
uals, too, if it is done through the neg-
ative operations of Ligado. 
The GPS Innovation Alliance is just 
1 of more than 100 we are talking 
about. This is a large number of people, 
companies, and industry groups who 
support my RETAIN GPS Act. 
Why is it so popular? 
Because GPS is essential to every-
thing 
we 
do. 
You 
know, 
people 
thought—when this thing first came 
on, they were just concerned about the 
air industry, the airlines, and others; 
but these are some of the day-to-day 
things. I don’t really have to read this, 
but I think it is important that people 
know it is important to others and 
themselves. 
I don’t know anyone who isn’t really 
concerned about GPS and its safety 
and working ability. A big one is using 
your credit or debit card. Every time 
you use a credit or debit card, when 
you are making a purchase or using an 
ATM, our financial systems rely on 
GPS timing to work. 
Another: Making a phone call. Cell 
phone networks rely on GPS to syn-
chronize cell towers so calls can be 
passed seamlessly. If they experience 
interference, your call can drop when 
moving from tower to tower. 
Here is one people don’t expect, and 
that is energy, whether that is filling 
up your tank at the pump or managing 
electrical grids to light our homes. We 
rely on GPS timing to safely operate 
underground pipelines and our elec-
tricity grid. 
Farmers 
and 
ranchers, 
we 
don’t 
think about them as being involved in 
this. But in this day and age, when 
they are planting crops, when they are 
applying fertilizer, and during harvest 
operations, moving large and critical 
machinery with precision, they depend 
on GPS working to do it. 
Working out. All these healthy peo-
ple doing what they are supposed to be 
doing—and I am not doing—and that is 
running and keeping in good health. 
Twenty percent of them use a fitness 
tracker or smartwatch, the majority of 
which use GPS to count steps and 
track distances. 
Taking a flight. Commercial and 
civil aviation relies on GPS to navi-
gate safely. 
Just 
driving 
around. 
Each 
day, 
countless Americans rely on Google 
Maps, Waze, Apple Maps, and other 
navigation systems to get them from 
point A to point B. 
And while no one hopes that there 
could be any kind of a problem in 
terms of a fire, an ambulance, or an in-
jury—the 9/11 operators and EMS used 
GPS and satellite communications to 
locate a caller and navigate as quickly 
as possible. We had a group coming in, 
documenting cases of lives that have 
been saved. 
And there is more: Weather fore-
casting, the movement of goods on our 
highways, and the rest. It goes on and 
on. 
That is why everyone agrees we need 
to protect GPS usage from being dam-
aged by the Ligado Order. 
Who is on the other side? 
Just Ligado and the people who they 
pay to support them. That is a whole 
lot of lobbying firms. The POLITICO 
article highlighted that they are staff-
ing up their lobbying and public rela-
tions: 
So far this year the Virginia company has 
enlisted a powerful roster of lobbying firms 
. . . currently numbering some 15. 
And on the side of GPS and satellite 
communications are Members of the 
House and the Senate, 15 Federal Agen-
cies, over 100 companies and organiza-
tions. The other, Ligado, is really just 
a lobbying group. 
I will just leave with one reminder. 
We know that the Ligado Order will 
damage GPS. The FCC said as much 
when they approved the order. The FCC 
said: 
Ligado shall expeditiously repair or re-
place as needed any U.S. Government GPS 
devices that experience or are likely to expe-
rience harmful interference from Ligado’s 
operations. 
But if Ligado believes that their 
press states that they won’t cause in-
terference to GPS, then why should 
they be afraid of my RETAIN Act? 
While they ponder that, I yield the 
floor. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
HEINRICH). The Senator from Hawaii. 
H.R. 3684 
Mr. SCHATZ. Mr. President, you 
know, this is a very important week in 
the United States Senate. Our infra-
structure bill is big, it is bold, and it is 
bipartisan, and it reflects the needs of 
a population especially important to 
me—Native communities and Indian 
Country across the United States. 
As chair of the Indian Affairs Com-
mittee, I have made it my mission to 
support these communities. This legis-
lation contains more than $11 billion in 
direct investments for Native commu-
nities, including $3.5 billion for clean 
water access and delivery, $3 billion for 
safe roads and bridges, and $2 billion to 
close the digital divide for American 
Indian, Alaska Native, and Native Ha-
waiian families. This bill will have a 
direct and long-lasting impact, and I 
am proud to support it. 
Since taking the committee gavel, I 
have worked with President Biden, 
with the Presiding Officer, with the 
members of the committee, and my 
colleagues in both Chambers to ensure 
that Native voices are always at the 
table. 
Our Tribal provisions in the Amer-
ican Rescue Plan and the Infrastruc-
ture Investment and Jobs Act were the 
two largest investments in Native com-
munities in American history—the two 
largest investments in Native commu-
nities in American history. Both bills 
contained resources and policy reforms 
that were long awaited and desperately 
needed, and they are already paying 
dividends. 
But our work has to continue, and 
this historic budget resolution is the 
next step. At its core, our budget is 
about restoring the middle class and 
giving more Americans the oppor-
tunity to get into the middle class. 
It cuts taxes for millions of American 
families. It creates millions of Amer-
ican jobs while tackling the climate 
crisis, and it is paid for by the wealthy 
paying their fair share. No one who 
makes under $400,000 will see an in-
crease in their taxes. 
I used to hate charts. I used to not be 
a chart guy. I have a rule in my office: 
If you are coming in to present to me, 
no PowerPoints. I just don’t like 
charts. 
But I am making an exception right 
now because it is really important that 
the public understand what we are 
about to do. 
We are going to lower costs for all 
Americans. We are going to cut taxes 
for American families. We are going to 
create millions of jobs while tackling 
the climate crisis. And it is going to be 
paid for by requiring the wealthy to 
pay their fair share in taxes. 
The budget also addresses Native 
communities specifically. For far too 
long, historical underfunding of Fed-
eral programs serving Native commu-
nities and Tribes has left them vulner-
able. Today, one in three Native Amer-
icans lives in poverty, and just 19 per-
cent of Native American students are 
attending college. Native Americans 
have a life expectancy 51⁄2 years lower 
than the general population, and Na-
tive Americans are on the frontlines of 
the climate crisis. 
This budget reverses these systemic 
injustices through a $20.5 billion tar-
geted investment. The budget makes 
significant investments in climate re-
siliency for Native communities and

gives them the tools that they need to 
mitigate 
the 
impacts 
of 
climate 
change, deploy their own clean energy 
solutions on their own terms, and re-
store and protect their homelands. 
It ensures that Native students and 
families have more access to Native 
language programs, early childhood 
education, and college. It also includes 
historic investments in health and edu-
cation programs to provide much need-
ed support to Native people across the 
country. 
We have already made the biggest in-
vestment in Native communities in 
American history, and we are not done 
yet. The responsibility of the U.S. Gov-
ernment to American Indians, Alaska 
Natives, and Native Hawaiians isn’t 
just for Democrats or Republicans to 
live up to. It is a commitment that we 
all share. 
This budget resolution will empower 
these Native communities like never 
before, and it will make our country 
stronger, safer, and more resilient. 
I will be proud to move it forward. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Ohio. 
Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent to enter into a col-
loquy with Senator WARNER
of Vir-
ginia. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, I rise 
today to clarify the provisions in the 
underlying bill text we are working on 
this evening. 
As we know, cryptocurrency is a dig-
ital asset that more and more people 
are investing in, and we should want 
that to continue in a healthy and sus-
tainable way. I would like to discuss 
the provisions in the bill that address 
information reporting requirements for 
digital asset brokers. 
Under IRS rules, sales or exchanges 
of assets, like digital assets, give rise 
to gain or loss in the same manner as 
sales of securities. Taxpayers who sell 
stocks or other securities through a 
broker receive an information return, 
IRS form 1099–B, that provides infor-
mation on the gross proceeds and the 
basis of those sales. Those information 
returns are prepared by their brokers 
or custodians or other agents involved 
in the effecting of the sales. 
Today, there is lack of clarity on how 
these reporting rules apply to digital 
asset transactions. The underlying bill 
has two simple provisions to address 
that. 
The cryptocurrency provision in the 
bill makes it clear as to who counts as 
a broker within this market. Under the 
bill, a broker is defined as ‘‘any person 
who (for consideration) is responsible 
for regularly providing any service ef-
fectuating transfers of digital assets on 
behalf of another person.’’ For tax pur-
poses, this means a sale on behalf of 
someone else. 
The concern has been expressed that 
some in the cryptocurrency industry 
who are not brokers would be caught 
up in this definition. The Treasury De-
partment, the nonpartisan Congres-
sional Joint Committee on Taxation, 
and others believe that the current lan-
guage is clear enough that the report-
ing requirements only cover brokers. 
The purpose of this discussion is to fur-
ther clarify that is the actual intent of 
the underlying bill. I think that is im-
portant. 
That is the goal we had in our discus-
sions over a compromise amendment, 
but, unfortunately, we have been un-
able to consider and adopt that amend-
ment thus far in this debate. 
Some of us were on this floor today, 
including Senator LUMMIS, Senator 
WARNER, Senator TOOMEY, myself to 
try to get that amendment passed, and 
we were not able to do so. 
The purpose of this provision is not 
to impose new reporting requirements 
on people who do not meet the defini-
tion of brokers. For example, if you are 
someone who is solely involved with 
validating distributed ledger trans-
actions through proof of work—com-
monly known as miners—if you are 
solely mining, you will not be consid-
ered a broker. The same would be true 
for proof of stake validation and other 
validation methods now or in the fu-
ture associated with other consensus 
mechanisms that are developed and 
might come into the market as the 
technology evolves. If you are solely 
staking your digital assets for the pur-
pose of validating distributed ledger 
transactions, you will not be consid-
ered a broker. 
We want to be sure that miners and 
stakers and others who play a key role 
in validating transactions now or in 
the future, or hardware and software 
sellers for digital wallets, will not be 
subject to the rules or those activities. 
Again, you will need to provide the 
information reporting only if you are 
functioning as a broker. 
It is my understanding that that is 
true, and I ask my fellow Finance Com-
mittee member and colleague from the 
bipartisan 
working 
group, 
Senator 
WARNER, if this is his understanding as 
well. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Virginia. 
Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank 
my friend from Ohio, who has been 
such a leader on the underlying bill, 
and I have been proud to work on this 
clarification on this critical issue on 
cryptocurrency. 
I thank the Senator, who is correct 
in his understanding. 
I would also like to add some addi-
tional clarifications. 
The bill ensures that digital asset 
market players who provide a platform 
to facilitate digital asset trades by tax-
payers will be considered brokers re-
quired to report information to the IRS 
and 
taxpayers 
about 
those 
trans-
actions. 
Reporting entities may be digital 
asset exchanges or hosted wallet pro-
viders, often called custodians, or other 
agents involved in effectuating digital 
asset transactions. 
The bill recognizes that digital assets 
are different from stocks and bonds. 
For example, some taxpayers regularly 
transfer digital assets between digital 
asset exchanges or to an off-exchange 
wallet and then back to an exchange. 
Those taxpayers need information re-
turns that link the steps in those 
chains so they have the complete infor-
mation they need to prepare their tax 
returns. 
This bill treats digital asset busi-
nesses that, for consideration—in ef-
fect, money—regularly effect transfers 
of digital assets as brokers and pro-
vides for reporting of digital asset 
transfers to or by a broker, including 
in cases where transfer is not directly 
from one broker to another. 
Senator PORTMAN, do you have any-
thing further to add on this item? 
Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, first 
of all, I appreciate the clarification by 
my colleague from Virginia, and, Sen-
ator WARNER, you are correct in your 
understanding. 
I would also ask Senator WARNER to 
clarify the intent of the proposal with 
respect to the application of the bill to 
persons solely engaged in the business 
of validating distributed ledger trans-
actions through proof of work, often 
called miners. 
Am I correct that under our provi-
sions it is our understanding that 
Treasury and the IRS will not treat 
these miners as brokers? 
Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, the 
Senator is entirely correct in his anal-
ysis of the application of the bill, and 
further, I believe, and Treasury has in-
dicated, that this would also be true 
for individuals engaged in staking their 
digital assets for the purpose of vali-
dating 
distributed 
ledger 
trans-
actions—proof 
of 
stake—which 
we 
know 
to 
be 
much 
more 
environ-
mentally sustainable. 
It would also be true for other valida-
tion methods associated with other 
consensus mechanisms, some of which 
are just coming to market, while oth-
ers are still in the developmental 
stage. 
People who solely act to validate 
transactions will not be treated as bro-
kers for those validation activities. 
Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, I 
would ask Senator WARNER to clarify 
the intent of the Senate in this legisla-
tion with respect to persons solely en-
gaged in the business of selling hard-
ware or software that allows people to 
access their private keys. 
Am I correct that these persons 
would not be treated as brokers under 
the underlying legislation? 
Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I think 
the Senator asked a question that has 
been queried by a number of folks in 
the media and elsewhere, and the Sen-
ator is entirely correct in his analysis 
of the application of the bill. 
Those 
persons 
do 
not 
effectuate 
transfers of digital assets and, there-
fore, would not be treated as brokers. 
If you are selling hardware or soft-
ware for which the only function is to

permit persons to control private keys 
which are used for accessing digital as-
sets on a distributed ledger, you will 
not be considered in the business of 
being a broker. 
I also want to say a word about the 
bipartisan amendment that I worked 
on with Senators PORTMAN, SINEMA, 
TOOMEY, and LUMMIS. 
I am pleased that we were able to file 
it today, and I would have hoped that 
we would have gotten a vote, but I 
thank them for their diligence and 
hard work to clarify, in concert with 
the Treasury Department, this critical 
section of the bill. 
We want to ensure that taxes legiti-
mately owed are paid, and full and ac-
curate transaction reporting is a prov-
en way to make that happen. 
We don’t, however, want to place re-
porting requirements on individuals 
who shouldn’t have them. 
The amendment memorializes the 
common understanding that the re-
quirements are to apply only to per-
sons who regularly, and for consider-
ation, effectuate transfers of digital as-
sets. 
Persons solely engaged in validating 
distributed ledger transactions will not 
be covered for those activities, whether 
they use proof of work, proof of stake 
or some other new consensus mecha-
nisms. 
Nor will they apply to persons solely 
engaged in selling hardware or soft-
ware with the sole function of permit-
ting someone to control private keys 
used to access digital assets. 
Of course, if these entities provide 
additional services for consideration 
that would qualify as brokerage, the 
rules would apply to them as any other 
broker. 
This is an exciting new technology 
that, in theory, could help bring serv-
ices to the underserved and reduce 
costs for everyone. We need, however, 
to strike the appropriate balance be-
tween capturing the promised benefits 
and guarding against the potential for 
serious abuse and creation of a shadow 
financial system beyond the reach of 
established rules to combat illicit fi-
nance and tax evasion. 
Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, I 
thank my friend and colleague from 
Virginia for those comments. 
Our provisions are designed to bring 
more clarity and legitimacy to the 
cryptocurrency industry by more close-
ly aligning the reporting requirements 
with those of more traditional finan-
cial services, and we believe it does 
just that, and in doing so, will help 
provide more certainty for people look-
ing to invest in digital assets. 
I thank my colleague Senator WAR-
NER for coming to the floor to discuss 
this important provision. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Michigan. 
BUDGET RESOLUTION 
Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I 
rise today to speak about Michigan 
families. Our families are a lot like 
families in every other State. Families 
in Michigan worry about making ends 
meet. It is something that keeps them 
up at night a lot of times. 
Parents of young children wonder 
how they will be able to pay for quality 
childcare. The costs may be as much or 
more than their rent. I know for my 
daughter and her husband, it is more 
than their mortgage payment for their 
three children. A mom wonders how 
she will feed her kids healthy meals in 
the summer when there are no school 
meals. Parents of older children worry 
about how they will be able to pay for 
their college tuition. Seniors in Michi-
gan wonder why their hearing aid or 
their glasses or their trips to the den-
tist aren’t covered by Medicare right 
now. They should be. And with our 
budget, they will be. And they want to 
know why their medicine is so expen-
sive. 
And then we have Michigan farmers 
diligently planning cover crops for 
healthier soil while directly battling 
the effects of the climate crisis and the 
destruction of their crops, and they 
need support to help them do more. 
They want to do more. All of our fami-
lies wonder if we will be able to tackle 
the climate crisis in time to save lives 
and land and jobs. Their worries are 
our worries. 
That is why Democrats are com-
mitted to passing the Build Back Bet-
ter Budget. Let me also say that I con-
gratulate all of my colleagues on both 
sides of the aisle who have, through 
their 
hard 
work 
and 
leadership, 
brought us to this point of passing part 
1 of President Biden’s Build Back agen-
da, which is the bipartisan infrastruc-
ture bill, and I am enthusiastically 
supporting it. 
So the Build Back Better Budget is 
the second piece, and it is focused on 
keeping 
historic 
economic 
growth 
going, and it is a game changer for our 
families. It really is. It is a game 
changer for our future, and it does four 
things, simply. It lowers costs for 
Americans—those 
things 
that 
keep 
folks up at night when they are trying 
figure out how to juggle all the costs 
coming in for themselves or their fami-
lies. 
It is going to cut taxes for American 
families, continue the biggest—maybe 
ever—tax cut that has gone to Amer-
ican families that we passed in the 
American Rescue Plan. 
It is going to create millions of jobs 
while tackling the climate crisis. As 
we saw the report today, it said what 
we knew, but we have to be very seri-
ous about what comes next here in 
tackling the climate crisis. 
And the great news is this: The great 
news is that we can cut costs and cut 
taxes and create millions of jobs and 
tackle the climate crisis and pay for it. 
We pay for it just simply by saying 
that the wealthy will pay their fair 
share. It is only fair that everybody be 
contributing to America and everybody 
be contributing to building back better 
in our country. 
The Build Back Better Budget will 
cut costs for the things that keep fami-
lies up at night: the cost of food, 
childcare, home care, price of medi-
cine, college tuition. For the first time, 
seniors will be able to have their hear-
ing aids, their glasses, and their dental 
care that they need covered by Medi-
care. I know a lot of folks think it al-
ready does cover those things. It does 
not yet, but we want that to happen. 
And families will have paid leave 
when they need it. That is really im-
portant 
because 
no 
family 
should 
worry that a birth of a child, an illness, 
or the need to care for an aging parent 
will leave them in a financial hole that 
they can never get out of. 
Speaking of support for families, 
about a month ago, Michigan families 
began to receive monthly help based on 
the number of children in their family. 
This is for families across the country. 
It is a tax cut that was made possible 
by the American Rescue Plan passed by 
Democrats in Congress and signed into 
law by President Biden. 
Our families today are receiving up 
to $250 a month for each child age 6 to 
age 17 and up to $300 for each child 
under age 6. It is estimated that 
around 92 percent of Michigan families, 
that Michigan children will benefit 
from this tax cut that we passed in the 
American Rescue Plan. 
And the tax cuts in other parts of the 
American Rescue Plan are now begin-
ning to cut child poverty in half. I will 
say that again: child poverty in half 
this year, not 5 years from now, not 10 
years from now, this year. What a 
great thing that we should all be ex-
cited about. And it not only helps chil-
dren and families being lifted out of 
poverty, but it helps the whole econ-
omy. It helps strengthen us as a coun-
try. 
Unfortunately, when Republicans are 
in the majority, tax cuts always seem 
to go to people who need it the least: 
the wealthy and the well connected. 
This tax cut is going to people who 
need it most: American families. And 
the Build Back Better Budget doubles 
down on this tax cut, extending this, 
resulting in one of the largest tax cuts 
for American families ever, cutting 
taxes for American families. 
The Build Back Better Budget will 
also create millions of jobs, including 
in agriculture and rural communities. 
The Build Back Better Budget will en-
sure that the United States will not 
only compete but will lead the world’s 
race toward a clean energy future. And 
I know our Presiding Officer cares 
deeply about that and is a leader in 
that, and it is exciting to see what we 
can do through this budget. 
Currently, 
Chinese 
companies 
produce 60 percent of the parts for wind 
turbines, 80 percent of solar cells, 80 
percent of battery cells, and it is time 
to bring those jobs home, and there is 
no reason that we can’t. Through the 
right support and incentives, we can 
bring those jobs home. 
Investing in technology will ensure 
that these parts are made in America

and will create good-paying American 
jobs—nearly 2 million jobs per year 
over the next 10 years. That is 2 mil-
lion, then 2 million, then 2 million, 
then 2 million over the next 10 years. 
And it will help us address the cli-
mate crisis head-on through critical 
policies and incentives that will reduce 
U.S. carbon emissions 50 percent by 
2030. That is essential. 
We are investing in farmers who 
want to keep leading the charge to 
combat the climate crisis, while mak-
ing sure we have the resources to re-
store our forests, make them more re-
silient in the face of climate-driven 
wildfires. We are fulfilling the promise 
of a climate-smart future by investing 
in research at land-grant and agricul-
tural universities like my own alma 
mater, Michigan State University. 
The Build Back Better Budget will 
lower costs for families; it is going to 
cut their taxes; it is going to create 
millions of good-paying jobs, while we 
are tackling the climate crisis. And we 
simply just have to make sure the 
wealthiest people in this country step 
up and are paying their fair share. 
Folks in Michigan work really hard 
to provide for their families. It is time 
to reward that hard work, not just 
wealth. It is unacceptable that some of 
the world’s most profitable companies 
and billionaires pay little or no tax at 
all; that is despite their profits and 
their fortunes growing every single 
year. 
Under the Build Back Better Budget, 
no one who makes under $400,000 per 
year will see their taxes go up. Let me 
say that again. No one under a $400,000 
a year in income will see their taxes 
go. Instead, the typical American fam-
ily will see their costs and their taxes 
go down. 
For too long—far too long—when Re-
publican 
colleagues 
have 
been 
in 
charge, the wealthy and huge corpora-
tions have come first, receiving special 
treatment over and over again. I think 
it is about time we put the American 
people first. 
And, by the way, I have heard so 
many colleagues on the other side of 
the aisle come to the floor over and 
over again lamenting that we are going 
to increase taxes. So for the record, let 
me just say that I don’t think it is in-
creasing taxes to tell a billionaire they 
have to pay more than zero. And that 
is what we are talking about here, just 
people paying their fair share for the 
majority of Americans in this country 
who are working hard to have a fair 
shot to work hard and to make it and 
to know that somebody is going to 
have their back. And that is what the 
Build Back Better Budget is all about. 
So let me just say again: It is time to 
lower costs for the big things that keep 
families up at night. It is time to cut 
taxes for American families. It is time 
to create millions of jobs, which we can 
do. This is the great news: We can cre-
ate millions of jobs while tackling the 
climate crisis, which we must seriously 
tackle. And it is time for the wealthy 
in this country to pay their fair share. 
Michigan families, families across the 
country 
have 
been 
waiting 
long 
enough. They are ready for us to build 
back better. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Connecticut. 
Mr. MURPHY. Mr. President, I come 
to the floor today, first, to talk about 
the Build Back Better Budget. This is 
an opportunity for this country to get 
it right. 
For far too long, millionaires and bil-
lionaires, corporations in this country 
have accrued more and more wealth, 
have paid less and less taxes, while av-
erage Americans have seen the cost of 
living rise, their lives get more dif-
ficult, and Washington do virtually 
nothing about it. We are going to make 
a huge downpayment in fixing that im-
balance. 
The Build Back Better Budget, which 
we will begin considering tomorrow, is 
going to lower costs for Americans. We 
are talking about the cost of Medicare, 
making sure that seniors get a benefit 
for things like vision and dental; lower 
the costs for families, like childcare 
costs. 
The Presiding Officer and I are 
amongst the few parents of relatively 
young school-age children. We know 
the cost of childcare today can bank-
rupt families that don’t have the in-
comes that we do. It is going to cut 
taxes for American families but the 
right American families. People who 
are making $30,000, $60,000 a year, that 
is who needs a tax break, not the mil-
lionaires and billionaires. 
It is going to create millions of jobs 
while tackling the climate crisis. Come 
to Connecticut. We have renewable en-
ergy companies building jobs all over 
our country, but they are having to 
compete with other nations that are 
making big investments in climate, 
which are creating their own renewable 
energy economies. If somebody is going 
to capture millions and millions of jobs 
in wind and solar and geothermal and 
electric cars, it should be the United 
States. 
Lastly, we are going to pay for this 
by asking the wealthy to pay their fair 
share, not more as a percentage of in-
come than anybody else but their fair 
share. We have corporations, some of 
the biggest in America, that are paying 
virtually no taxes today. All of the 
wealth that is being accumulated by 
the CEOs of these massive internet 
companies, virtually untaxed. That has 
to change. That has to change. I am ex-
cited to be a part of this process. 
As I said, we have the chance to 
tackle the climate crisis and create 
millions of new jobs. We can and have 
to do both. 
You saw the new report challenging 
us, right? The facts are dire with re-
spect to what has already happened as 
this planet has warmed. But what that 
report says is that the next 8 years are 
critical. The decisions we make in this 
decade will determine whether there is 
a livable planet for our children. That 
is our obligation. But here is our op-
portunity: create millions of new jobs. 
In Connecticut, we have solar compa-
nies, advance battery companies, fuel 
cell companies, that are just waiting 
for the U.S. Government to create a 
market for their technologies in the 
way that so many other countries 
around the world are doing. 
We have the chance to invest in com-
munity violence intervention programs 
and save lives. This is part of the Build 
Back Better agenda. President Biden 
has made it clear that if you want to 
tackle the epidemic of gun violence in 
this country, then you have to invest 
in communities in need. 
If you take a look at what drives vio-
lence and exposure to violence in this 
country, the No. 1-correlated factor is 
income. The poorer you are, the more 
likely you are to be the victim of vio-
lence. 
By investing in communities that 
have high rates of violence—and not, 
coincidentally, high rates of poverty— 
you are reducing violence in this Na-
tion. 
We have so many examples of pro-
grams, like Project Longevity in New 
Haven and Bridgeport, CT, for example, 
that show, when you wrap services 
around a small subset of at-risk fami-
lies and at-risk young people, you can 
dramatically lower the rates of vio-
lence in this country. 
And, by the way, that puts people to 
work, too, creating these investments 
in anti-violence programming. 
Then we have a chance to transform 
our rail system and create jobs, speed 
up our commutes, and address the cli-
mate crisis. 
And we are making a big downpay-
ment in the bipartisan infrastructure 
bill, $66 billion for rail. And I hope to 
see an additional downpayment in the 
budget reconciliation process. But in-
vesting in rail, it is kind of the Holy 
Grail because it creates short-term 
jobs as we rebuild our decrepit rail 
lines. It speeds up commutes for peo-
ple. That just makes their lives better, 
more time with family. But it also cre-
ates a lot of economic development po-
tential. Companies want to locate here 
when they can get their people faster 
from point A to point B. 
Boston to DC is about half the dis-
tance as Beijing and Shanghai, but it 
takes twice the amount of time to get 
from those two spots in the United 
States as it does in Asia. We are way 
behind the curve in investment in high- 
speed rail, and that is hurting us eco-
nomically. 
But, of course, an investment in rail 
is also about addressing the climate 
crisis because the only way to make a 
dent in transportation emissions is to 
move people out of cars, especially dur-
ing the period of time in which we are 
ramping up the deployment of electric 
vehicles, and get those individuals into 
trains, get people out of planes and 
into trains, especially in a corridor 
like the Northeast, where the trains

are electrified, right, where these are 
cleaner trains than in other parts of 
the country. We have a real oppor-
tunity, if we get more people onto 
trains by investing in them to address 
the climate crisis. 
So I want to just spend a moment, 
really, telling my colleagues both the 
responsibility and opportunity that we 
have. Millionaires, billionaires, and 
corporations are doing better than ever 
before in this country. Regular people 
are hurting. They want a government 
that is responsive to that. We need to 
address the huge costs people are hav-
ing to pay today. We need to cut taxes 
for regular people. We need to create 
jobs, solve the climate crisis, and ask 
those who are doing very well, the top 
0.1 percent, to pay their fair share. 
AFGHANISTAN 
Mr. President, as the Taliban con-
tinues this rapid advance into territory 
that had been controlled by the Kabul- 
based Afghan Government, there is 
going to be a lot of hand-wringing in 
Washington, especially amongst those 
who cheered our open-ended occupation 
of Afghanistan for the last 20 years. 
Those who opposed President Biden’s 
plan to leave are going to engage in a 
battery of ‘‘I told you so’s’’ and blame 
the President for the Taliban’s march 
on Kabul. 
But the Taliban’s surge isn’t a reason 
for the United States to reverse course 
and put massive troop presence back 
into the country. 
No. The Taliban surge is actually a 
reason to stick to the withdrawal plan, 
because the complete, utter failure of 
the Afghan National Army, absent our 
hand-holding, to defend their country 
is a blistering indictment of a failed 20- 
year strategy predicated on the belief 
that billions of U.S. taxpayer dollars 
could create an effective, democratic 
central government in a nation that 
has never had one and a Western-mod-
eled 
army 
structure 
populated 
by 
troops who are willing to die to pre-
serve a government. 
Staying 1 more year in Afghanistan 
means we stay forever because, if 20 
years of laborious training and equip-
ping of the Afghan security forces had 
this little impact on their ability to 
fight, then another 50 years wouldn’t 
change anything. 
If we choose to keep spending tril-
lions of dollars in Afghanistan until 
that nation is a fully functioning de-
mocracy and their security forces can, 
by themselves, repel extremist attacks, 
then we are never ever leaving. 
Now, I went to Afghanistan four 
times in 6 years, from 2007 to 2013. And 
each time, what struck me most was 
the heroism, the patriotism, the capa-
bility of our soldiers. Too many of 
them never came home. Too many oth-
ers came home with injuries that 
changed their lives. Many of them were 
from my home State. 
But also, each time I went to Afghan-
istan, I also met with a new, impres-
sive American general who had just re-
cently arrived in country for his short 
12-month 
tour. 
Each 
walked 
me 
through a PowerPoint presentation de-
tailing how the previous general hadn’t 
made that much progress in training 
the Afghan security forces and how 
this general would change course and 
finally get it right. 
This cycle of failure, readjustment, 
and continued failure must have played 
out over a dozen times in Afghanistan 
between our arrival there and the be-
ginning of the Biden administration, 
and the Taliban took full advantage. 
Now, President Trump made a little- 
noticed decision to stop publicizing the 
estimates of how much territory the 
Taliban controlled in Afghanistan, no 
doubt because the news, especially in 
the last 5 years, got worse and worse. 
Yes, the Taliban is moving quickly to-
ward regional capitals right now, but 
they have been gaining territory for 
nearly a decade. That trend is just ac-
celerating now. 
One repeating mistake was our belief 
that we could create the Afghan Na-
tional Army from our own mold. Now, 
our country’s sense of nationalist pa-
triotism, which inspires Americans to 
put their lives on the line for the flag 
and what it represents, does not have a 
corollary in Afghanistan. But we didn’t 
get that. 
We had no sense of how competing 
tribal and ethnic affiliations made cre-
ating this common military purpose 
difficult. And each time our military 
leaders and our on-the-ground trainers 
started to learn about these local nu-
ances and started adapting their meth-
ods, they were sent home because their 
deployment was done, and a new de-
ployment of Americans arrived to start 
from scratch and start making the 
same mistakes again. Our military 
leaders are incredibly capable, but we 
gave them an impossible task. 
Our presence in Afghanistan also cre-
ated a deadly feedback loop where 
Taliban and terrorist recruiters easily 
and eagerly scooped up trainees champ-
ing at the bit to fight the Americans. 
For instance, research suggests that in 
the northwest of Pakistan, where the 
Taliban and allied groups organized, 
our drone attacks actually led to in-
creased, not decreased, numbers of 
Taliban fighters. Bombs falling from 
pilotless flying machines more often 
killed innocent civilians instead of 
enemy combatants, and this simply 
caused more anger against the United 
States and our Afghan Government al-
lies and more interest in locals to join 
the fight against us. 
Now, as the Taliban begins to quick-
en the pace of their assault on Afghan 
forces, hawks in the United States are 
going to lead the charge for Biden to 
reverse course and continue these 
failed policies of the last 20 years. But 
to what end? 
If the Afghan National Army was so 
willing to stand aside after 20 years of 
U.S. investment, why would anything 
change if we stuck around longer? 
Of course, the answer is nothing 
would change. I know that that is hard 
to hear and to accept. Staying longer 
would just be to admit that American 
taxpayers have got to foot the bill for 
a permanent occupation of Afghani-
stan, to shore up a corrupt government 
and keep the Taliban at bay. 
Now, this isn’t wise, mostly because 
my constituents, understandably, have 
little interest in putting that much 
money in Afghanistan when they can’t 
afford groceries or college for their 
kids 
or 
their 
monthly 
rent. 
The 
Taliban are bad guys, but so are the 
leaders who rule Turkmenistan or 
Equatorial Guinea or Kazakhstan or 
North Korea, amongst others. But we 
can’t afford, as a country, to invade 
and displace every brutal regime in the 
world. 
Now, what my constituents do care 
about is preventing another attack on 
American soil, which is why thousands 
of our brave men and women in uni-
form made the ultimate sacrifice fight-
ing in Afghanistan. That is why we 
went there in the first place. So if 
spending trillions to fight the Taliban 
was vitally necessary to this project, 
then the American public would prob-
ably back the investment, but right 
now it isn’t necessary. 
U.S. officials believe al-Qaida in Af-
ghanistan is no longer capable of car-
rying out attacks against the United 
States. We are talking about 200 to 400 
al-Qaida fighters in Afghanistan today. 
Now, this is likely because the Taliban 
is seeking a less contentious relation-
ship with the United States and, there-
fore, has promised to deny al-Qaida a 
safe haven. 
Now, I get it. Assurances from the 
Taliban are of very limited value, but 
our intelligence collection on al-Qaida 
is good enough to be able to monitor 
the Taliban’s compliance and adjust 
accordingly. 
Now, I understand how difficult it is 
to watch the Afghan National Army 
refuse to defend its territory, to watch 
the Taliban move so quickly into pro-
vincial capitals. I understand how infu-
riating it must be for families who lost 
loved ones in Afghanistan to see these 
gains be eliminated so quickly. 
But let’s understand, finally, what 
would 
have 
happened 
if 
President 
Biden had chosen to keep 2,500 troops 
in Afghanistan. Twenty-five hundred 
troops is not a sufficient number to 
repel this offensive. Our military lead-
ers have been crystal clear that a min-
imum of 8,500 troops are required to 
provide any modicum of support nec-
essary to keep the Taliban’s gains to a 
crawl. 
That is how many troops were there 
at the beginning of Trump’s term, but 
as part of his agreement with the 
Taliban, he drew down the numbers to 
2,500, a force size completely inad-
equate to stop any Taliban advance. 
And the only reason why those 2,500 
soldiers didn’t get overrun by the 
Taliban is because, as part of the 
Trump-Taliban agreement, the Taliban 
promised to hold off on attacks until 
the United States had withdrawn.

So if President Biden decided to keep 
our open-ended mission to support the 
Afghan military against the Taliban, 
he would have had to surge troop levels 
back to 8,500. Every single troop in Af-
ghanistan costs over $1 million a year. 
Now, never mind the complete unwill-
ingness of the American public to sup-
port yet another Afghanistan troop 
surge; the cost of this escalation would 
have just been indefensible. 
The Afghan military, on paper, is far 
superior 
a 
fighting 
force 
to 
the 
Taliban. The Afghan National Army 
has approximately three times the 
number of soldiers. The Afghan Na-
tional Army has an air force. The 
Taliban doesn’t. The Afghan National 
Army’s 
equipment 
and 
weapons— 
thanks to the United States—are much 
more sophisticated and deadly. The 
United States trains that force. We pay 
their salaries. We support them. 
But despite this advantage, despite 20 
years and trillions of dollars of invest-
ment, they are losing to the ragtag 
Taliban badly. This isn’t a reason for 
the United States to reescalate. This is 
evidence of the wisdom and courage of 
President Biden’s decision to withdraw. 
Our counterterrorism mission in Af-
ghanistan is going to remain, but we 
should refuse, as a nation, to remain in 
forever wars that don’t make our Na-
tion safer. 
I yield the floor. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Ms. 
SMITH). The Senator from Massachu-
setts. 
BUDGET RECONCILIATION 
Mr. MARKEY. Madam President, I 
rise to speak about the $3.5 trillion 
budget resolution that will cut costs 
for American families, provide our sen-
iors with comprehensive healthcare, 
and finally take the much-needed and 
long-overdue action to protect our-
selves, our future, and our existence 
from the climate crisis. 
Our urgency in action must be as 
fierce as the crisis on our shores, in our 
cities, and in our States across Amer-
ica. The climate deniers are out of ex-
cuses, and we are out of time. 
The 
United 
Nations 
Intergovern-
mental 
Panel 
on 
Climate 
Change 
issued its sixth assessment report. The 
new warning from the U.N., from the 
IPCC, is actually code red. They are 
saying that the planet is in great dan-
ger, that our country is in great danger 
if we do not respond to the climate cri-
sis. And now the challenge for this Sen-
ate, for this country, is whether or not 
we are going to respond. And we are. 
The code red warning from the 
United Nations is going to have a code 
green response from the U.S. Senate in 
the $3.5 trillion package. 
We will invest in the technologies 
that will make it possible for us to re-
spond to this dire warning from the 
United Nations, a warning that reaf-
firms what we are seeing and suffering 
right now across our country: Climate 
change is going to continue to cost us 
lives and livelihoods if we don’t re-
spond with the scope and the scale that 
this moment demands. 
The report says our responsibility is 
unequivocal. The effects of the climate 
crisis are unprecedented, and we have 
an undeniable need to act. From in-
creasing intensity and frequency of ex-
treme heat to catastrophic precipita-
tion and devastating droughts, no com-
munity will be able to hide from the 
most dire impacts of our human-driven 
climate crisis. 
This report must be the final warning 
that we must respond. And right now 
we are preparing, as Senate Democrats, 
a budget resolution that will be our 
best opportunity to respond to the code 
red warning we have received today 
from the United Nations, from the cli-
mate experts of the planet. 
That is our challenge, but we are 
going to have resistance. We have to 
basically sweep away this rising tide of 
cynicism that we hear from climate 
deniers, from the fossil fuel industry, 
and from too many Republicans. 
Senate Democrats are ready to forge 
ahead. This budget resolution is our 
opportunity 
to 
prevent 
the 
most 
alarming consequences of the climate 
crisis and equip ourselves to survive 
the climate impacts we cannot avoid. 
With policies to drive deep cuts in 
emissions, protect communities, pro-
vide equity and justice to overburdened 
communities, we can respond to over-
whelming evidence and take the nec-
essary action to save our people and 
our planet. 
We have received the final warning. 
We now have the best opportunity any 
Congress has ever had to respond. That 
legislation will be on the floor of the 
Senate in the next 2 days. 
As chair of the Clean Air, Climate, 
and Nuclear Safety Subcommittee of 
the Environment and Public Works 
Committee, I am ready to get to work 
and turn this budget resolution into 
legislative action. This vital invest-
ment will build on what we have al-
ready done, adding on climate, equity, 
and even more good-paying union jobs. 
We can save all of creation by engag-
ing in massive union job creation. 
We can fund a clean-energy accel-
erator that uses innovative, flexible fi-
nancing to lower our emissions and 
create jobs with public dollars that can 
deploy and leverage private invest-
ment. This accelerator will unleash 
clean energy generation, energy-effi-
cient retrofits, and opportunities in 
communities across our country. 
We can fund environmental justice 
mapping efforts to understand the bur-
dens of affected communities and di-
rect our investments and our programs 
accordingly. We can provide the fund-
ing and support to monitor and to ad-
dress the dangers of extreme heat, 
toxic chemicals, and polluted air. 
We can create a civilian Climate 
Corps and put millions of people to 
work on projects to protect our com-
munities from climate impacts, sup-
port local projects, and get trained and 
get to work in building our clean en-
ergy economy. We must ensure that 
these jobs have high standards, pre-
vailing wages, and just recruiting and 
hiring practices. 
And in this legislation that responds 
to the code red climate threat, we will 
have the tax breaks. The oil, gas, and 
coal industry, for a hundred years, 
have had their control over tax breaks 
coming out of this Congress. Well, in 
this bill, we are going to have the tax 
breaks for wind and for solar and for 
all-electric vehicles and for battery 
storage technologies. We are going to 
have the tax breaks for the solution to 
the climate crisis. 
This is the moment. This is what the 
world is waiting to see from our coun-
try. If we are going to lead, we cannot 
preach temperance from a barstool. We 
have to step up and do the right thing 
and create the innovation economy 
that will save our country and save the 
world. 
And we can kick start a clean energy 
revolution. And, not only that, we can 
ensure that we have a revolution that 
is made in America—jobs here, union 
jobs here, good-paying jobs here, in the 
United States. 
We are going to have a domestic 
manufacturing revolution that we have 
not seen in a generation, and we are 
going to do it in the green budget reso-
lution that we are going to bring out 
onto the floor of the Senate in the next 
2 days. 
The answer to our clean future is 
blowing in the wind. This is a once-in- 
a-generation opportunity to save our 
people and our planet by going bigger 
and bolder than ever before. 
Senate Democrats are going to de-
liver real results for Americans: for our 
seniors, our children, our families, our 
working people across our country. 
As Massachusetts’ own Ralph Waldo 
Emerson said, ‘‘the first wealth is 
health.’’ And this budget makes sure 
Americans’ healthcare and futures are 
a priority second to none. 
Under our budget resolution, every 
child—regardless of their ZIP Code— 
will have the opportunity attend pre-K. 
Every teen will be able to reimagine 
their future with the ability to enroll 
tuition-free 
in 
community 
colleges 
across our country. 
And I will be fighting to provide crit-
ical broadband connectivity support to 
ensure educational success for all stu-
dents at home, especially poor chil-
dren, Black, Brown, immigrant chil-
dren in our country. 
And thanks to this budget, Medicare 
will now cover essentials like hearing 
aids, eyeglasses, and dental care for 
our seniors for the first time ever—cov-
ered by Medicare. Millions of women 
will be brought into the workforce 
when we provide accessible and afford-
able childcare for American families. 
And we will expand the child tax credit 
and make the child and dependent care 
tax credit permanent in our country— 
permanent tax relief for every family 
with a child in our country. 
And we will do all of this by paying 
for all of these investments, unlike Re-
publicans who put tax cuts for the

wealthy on the American taxpayers’ 
dime. We will do this without any 
American making under $400,000 paying 
a single cent more in taxes and asking, 
instead, for the ultrawealthy and the 
big corporations—including Big Oil and 
Big Gas—to pay more of their fair 
share, like workers and small busi-
nesses have always done in our coun-
try. 
These are the investments that will 
restack the deck in our country, level 
the playing field, and set in motion a 
more just future where every child and 
every family has the opportunity to 
achieve the American dream. 
The second train is finally about to 
pull 
into 
the 
station. 
Progressive 
champions in the House of Representa-
tives are doing an incredible job hold-
ing the line to ensure that this resolu-
tion is passed alongside the bipartisan 
infrastructure bill. 
But as we recover from the multiple 
crises we face, we cannot accept to re-
turn to the status quo—a status quo 
that has left too many people behind in 
our country. 
Over the last several months, we 
have worked tirelessly to deliver for 
Americans COVID relief, an expanded 
child 
tax 
credit, 
$7 
billion 
for 
broadband access, support for students 
and families, and much more. 
Now we need to pass this $3.5 trillion 
package and not a cent less to push for-
ward and create a more just and livable 
future for every person in our country. 
That is what this moment demands. 
And I look forward to working with 
all of my colleagues on this budget res-
olution this week and taking the first 
steps to ensure this future is guaran-
teed for every child and family across 
our country. 
We can do it for families. We can do 
it for our planet. That is what our 
agenda has to be for the remainder of 
this week. And I think if we respond, 
we will have become one of the great-
est Congresses that has ever served in 
the history of our country. 
I yield back to you. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Michigan. 
Mr. PETERS. Madam President, I 
rise today to highlight the incredible 
opportunity before us to build on the 
strong foundation laid in the bipar-
tisan Infrastructure Investment and 
Jobs Act through the Build Back Bet-
ter budget. 
The bipartisan infrastructure bill 
will make historic investments that 
will help create good-paying American 
jobs, 
upgrade 
our 
roads 
and 
our 
bridges, improve access to high-speed 
internet, and so much more. 
With the Build Back Better budget, 
we have the opportunity to go beyond 
these initial, long overdue investments 
and take strong action to help secure 
our future for generations to come. 
This budget will provide crucial tax 
cuts to hard-working American fami-
lies and tackle some of the toughest 
challenges they are facing, like the 
cost of childcare, prescription drugs, 
and the lack of family leave that is 
paid. 
This budget will create good-paying 
American jobs by incentivizing the de-
velopment of new clean power sources 
that simply cannot be outsourced. We 
will finally confront the very serious 
and very real threat posed to our eco-
nomic and national security by climate 
change. 
As chairman of the Homeland Secu-
rity and Governmental Affairs Com-
mittee, I am working to ensure that 
the budget resolution makes critical 
payments to electrify the Federal Gov-
ernment’s vehicle fleet, including the 
U.S. Postal Service’s delivery vehicles. 
Not only will this set us on a path to a 
more sustainable future; it helps grow 
America’s domestic manufacturing sec-
tor. Thanks to these investments, 
American workers and companies will 
have greater opportunity to build and 
assemble the battery cells, electric 
drive trains, and other auto parts right 
here in the United States. 
In addition to creating great jobs, we 
will strengthen our domestic supply 
chains, reduce our dependence on for-
eign producers, and lead the world in 
advancing clean electric vehicle tech-
nologies. 
This is especially an important in-
vestment at a time when we are seeing 
the effects of climate change ravage 
communities all across our country. 
From devastating wildfires out West to 
severe flooding in Michigan and across 
the Midwest, to destructive hurricanes 
along the gulf and east coast, we sim-
ply cannot wait any longer to address 
the impacts of climate change. 
Just today, the United Nations cli-
mate panel released a landmark report 
on climate change, calling it a ‘‘code 
red’’ situation for the survival of our 
planet. 
This budget will help limit further 
harmful 
pollution 
from 
greenhouse 
gases and fossil fuels that are contrib-
uting to this worldwide crisis by mak-
ing important down payments on clean 
energy. 
While we invest in transformative 
technology to help secure our future, 
we also need to deal with the natural 
disasters that communities are facing 
right now. We must protect American 
families and businesses from the con-
sequences 
of 
increasingly 
severe 
storms, floods, and fires by making im-
portant investments in disaster mitiga-
tion efforts. 
We must help communities reduce 
the impact of severe disasters by ad-
dressing rising water levels, improving 
flood prevention and storm water man-
agement efforts, and strengthening 
wildfire mitigation efforts. These cli-
mate-change driven threats are de-
stroying homes, small businesses, and 
communities in every corner of the 
United States, and this budget will en-
sure that we take swift action and bet-
ter secure our future and limit further 
destruction. 
Finally, this budget will also make 
historic investments to tackle one of 
the fastest growing threats to our na-
tional security—cyberattacks from for-
eign adversaries and criminal organiza-
tions. We must secure critical infra-
structure, support State and local gov-
ernments in their efforts to increase 
cyber security, and overhaul outdated 
and insecure Federal networks. 
Over the past year, we have seen 
time and time again how vulnerable in-
formation networks can be. Attacks on 
everything from K–12 schools and small 
businesses to major oil pipelines and 
Agencies across the Federal Govern-
ment have played out on the front page 
of newspapers across our country. 
Whether we are talking about our crit-
ical infrastructure or our Federal Gov-
ernment, we simply cannot wait any 
longer to fix these serious problems. 
Targeted investments in new infor-
mation technology will not only im-
prove our cybersecurity defenses but 
will also help increase efficiency, re-
duce energy consumption, and save 
taxpayer dollars. 
Cybersecurity investments will help 
defend 
our 
information 
networks 
against 
further 
intrusions 
and 
breaches, protect our national secu-
rity, prevent Americans’ personal in-
formation from being stolen, and help 
reduce attacks that could threaten our 
very way of life. 
These are just a few of the critical 
down payments we will be making with 
the Build Back Better budget. Now is 
the time to take on some of the biggest 
challenges that are facing American 
families. Whether it is working to 
lower 
costs, 
improving 
access 
to 
healthcare, or ensuring our commu-
nities can weather the next major 
storm or major cyberattack, the Build 
Back Better budget will help ensure 
that we are securing the future that we 
want for future generations of Ameri-
cans. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to 
call the roll. 
Mr. MERKLEY. Madam President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
Mr. MERKLEY. Madam President, I 
am here on the floor today to talk 
about climate chaos. It is a monu-
mental crisis that requires immediate 
and bold action. 
The reason I am speaking about cli-
mate chaos at this moment is because 
several things are happening today 
that create this connection. The one is 
that the IPCC, the International Panel 
on Climate Change, has released its 
2021 climate report, and the second is, 
we are in the middle of talking about 
infrastructure for our Nation, and the 
investments in climate infrastructure 
are going to be critical to take on the 
crisis that we are facing. 
We are in pretty big trouble. This re-
port that came out today—‘‘5 Big Find-
ings from the IPCC’s 2021 Climate Re-
port’’—it lays out how dramatically

August 9, 2021 
things have shifted in just a few years. 
It notes that the concentration of car-
bon dioxide is now higher than it has 
been for 2 million years, and we have 
made that happen over just the last 100 
or so years but particularly the last 30; 
that the glacial retreat is unmatched 
for the last 2,000 years; that the last 
decade was warmer than any period for 
125,000 years; that the summer Arctic 
ice coverage is smaller than at any 
time in the last 1,000 years; that the 
ocean is warming faster than at any 
time since the last ice age; and that 
ocean acidification is at the highest 
level in the last 26,000 years. 
These things would not have been 
true a few years ago, and it is because 
of the massive buildup in carbon diox-
ide from our burning of fossil fuels to 
power our energy economy, and it is 
from the massive release of methane 
gas because of our use of natural gas, 
which is a very nice name for what is 
mostly methane gas. We collect meth-
ane gas, and we have accelerated that 
through 
fracking. 
A 
tremendous 
amount leaks out through that drilling 
and fracking system. A tremendous 
amount more leaks out through the 
millions of miles of pipes that carry it 
to its destinations, and then when we 
burn it, it creates carbon dioxide, also 
a global warming gas. 
So we don’t need to really get this re-
port to know we are in trouble because 
we just have to look at the facts on the 
ground from our home States right 
now. I mean, Oregon is aflame. We have 
so many fires burning simultaneously, 
and the largest fire is over 400,000 
acres—400,000 acres. Think how long it 
would take, if you were on a hike, to 
pass through 400,000 acres. 
You know, a few years ago, we had a 
group of homes that were burned out in 
John Day, OR, some 24 or so homes, 
and we thought that was a big deal. 
Then last summer, we had six towns 
burn to the ground, completely inciner-
ated. Now we have these massive, mas-
sive fires, as do Idaho and Montana and 
Washington State and California State 
and Colorado and Utah and New Mex-
ico, Arizona. The West is aflame be-
cause the temperatures are so much 
higher. 
What else is happening in Oregon? 
Well, our snowpack is disappearing; av-
erage snowpack is decreasing. It is af-
fecting the amount of irrigation water 
we have. It is affecting the fact that 
our streams are now smaller and warm-
er than they were before, affecting our 
trout and our salmon, and the ocean is 
acidifying. Now we have some 30 per-
cent more acid in the ocean. It affected 
first the reproduction of our oysters, so 
now we artificially buffer the water for 
our oyster scene to survive, baby oys-
ters to survive. Now it is starting to af-
fect the Dungeness crab, one of the 
most significant financial enterprises 
in terms of sea life production in a 
commercial sense off the coast of Or-
egon. So we are seeing impacts in every 
possible way. 
I know that as I travel rural Oregon, 
people emphasize that this is a huge 
impact on rural Oregon and rural 
America because it is affecting our 
farming. It is affecting our fishing, and 
it is affecting our forests. 
So we are engaged here in a two-part 
plan. The first plan is an infrastructure 
bill that address water, transportation, 
and broadband. Well, all well and good, 
but if part one sails away from the 
dock and leaves part two stranded, 
what is left behind? Housing, massive 
investment; education, a massive in-
vestment in 2 years of preschool and 2 
years of community college. Founda-
tions for thriving families are left be-
hind, the support for daycare for work-
ing families; and the child tax credit, 
which is lifting half of the children in 
poverty out of poverty in America—the 
most massive tax cut ever envisioned 
for middle-class America. 
What other thing is left on the dock? 
The investment in climate; the transi-
tion from burning fossil fuel, the fossil 
fuel economy, to the renewable energy 
economy. 
We cannot let part one sail away of 
the infrastructure bill without doing 
part two, and the report from the IPCC 
today emphasizes how absolutely im-
portant it is that we act and we act 
boldly. That report said it is unequivo-
cal that human influence has warmed 
the atmosphere, the ocean, and the 
land. The report, crafted by 200 global 
scientists, concludes, as one of the re-
port’s coauthors summarizes: 
There is no uncertainty language in this 
sentence because there is no uncertainty 
that global warming is caused by human ac-
tivity and the burning of fossil fuels. 
The report goes on to say that we are 
now on an irreversible course towards a 
hotter planet; that if we do the sever-
est cuts in carbon emissions right now, 
the severest cuts, we are still going to 
see temperatures rise 11⁄2 degrees Cel-
sius or about 2.7 degrees Fahrenheit. 
That was the goal of the Paris Agree-
ment. We would have to massively cut 
our carbon emissions and our methane 
emissions right now to meet the Paris 
target. 
The report goes on to say that ex-
treme weather events, which were rare 
or completely unprecedented, will now 
be common and more common as we 
approach the new normal or it becomes 
a new normal because of climate 
change. 
I think the U.N. Secretary General, 
Antonio Guterres, summed it up when 
he said this report is ‘‘a code red for 
humanity’’—‘‘a code red for human-
ity.’’ So that is why all 100 of us here 
in the Senate should be on the floor 
discussing how to respond to a code red 
for humanity. 
Wow, we have a lot of work to do, but 
that first part of the package has noth-
ing in it or almost nothing in it—a lit-
tle bit of money for charging stations, 
a little bit of money for electric buses, 
a little bit of money for improving the 
electric grid, but nothing like the mas-
sive investment that is required to re-
spond to a code red, a code red for the 
planet. 
Now, clearly, as the planet gets hot-
ter and it is affecting our forests and 
our farming and our fishing—forest 
fires that are destroying towns, more 
powerful hurricanes affecting the sea-
shore, more intrusion of saltwater into 
freshwater supplies—cities are having 
to basically start to build dikes around 
themselves in order to keep the sea-
water out. 
I heard one Member of the Senate 
say: You know, here is the thing. We 
shouldn’t do anything about this be-
cause the investments required to take 
on climate change will be disruptive. 
Well, I will tell you what is disrup-
tive. Forest fires are disruptive. The 
loss of the snowpack for our winter 
sports and our irrigation water and our 
healthy streams, that is disruptive. 
Sea life being damaged by ocean acidi-
fication, that is disruptive to our econ-
omy. Forests with pine beetles thriving 
and trees dying, that is disruptive to 
our forestry. Lack of rain, such that 
the groundwater is not recharged, is 
disruptive to our irrigation for our 
ranchers and our farmers. 
What is disruptive is doing nothing, 
and the damage will far exceed the cost 
of taking an honest effort to transition 
quickly to renewable energy. 
Failing to act means failing our fu-
ture generations. We cannot allow that 
to happen. So that is why I am so 
pleased that on the same day that the 
IPCC released their report, we also saw 
the budget resolution released. 
Now, the budget resolution is the sec-
ond half of the package, the part that 
addresses families, that addresses for-
ests, that addresses housing, that ad-
dresses children, and, yes, addresses 
climate. So there is hope. 
And what does it do? Well, it funds 
the Civilian Conservation Corps to put 
Americans to work in good-paying jobs 
to help conserve our Nation’s public 
lands and waters and bolster commu-
nity resilience and to advance environ-
mental justice. 
It establishes the Energy Efficiency 
and Clean Electricity Standard that 
my colleague from Minnesota, who is 
presiding over the Senate right now, 
has been so instrumental in laying out 
for the Senate to act on. That clean 
electricity standard will have an enor-
mous impact because to escape the fos-
sil fuel energy economy, we have to 
electrify everything on the production 
end. We take the power off the grid, 
but we have to put renewable energy 
onto the grid. So it is the key. It is the 
centerpiece—the centerpiece—of how 
we act. 
And there are a lot of subsidies, yes, 
for things like electric buses and also 
for electric vehicles. And I think it is 
so exciting that we now are going to 
have an F–150 electric. And the F–150 
electric goes from zero to 60 miles per 
hour in 4.4 seconds. Try that with your 
fossil fuel car, my friend, because you 
will fail. But you get the new Ford F– 
150, and it will press you back in the 
seat like you have never experienced as 
you take off, and you can still do your

industrial work with your pickup. And 
there is a Ford Mustang coming on, 
electric, and that is going to be a hot 
item, an exciting item as well. And so 
it is kind of neat that what is good for 
the environment is also going to be 
good for all of us to have a good time 
driving. 
So all of these pieces that are in the 
second half—the second half of the in-
frastructure package—that has to get 
done, and it should be absolutely bipar-
tisan because these investments in 
families are desired by Democratic 
families and Republican families and 
Independent families. These invest-
ments in housing—affordable housing 
in our country—are needed by Repub-
lican and Democratic and Independent 
families. 
And you know what? It is going to be 
completely paid for—completely paid 
for by having the megarich pay their 
fair share. And as you all know from 
all the reports, they have been jumping 
and diving and ducking their taxes, 
many of them paying zero. Billionaires 
who are putting themselves into space 
on a joy ride pay zero in taxes. Billion-
aires are using tons of the products of 
what we paid for of our road infrastruc-
ture and our water infrastructure and 
our education infrastructure. They are 
employing all kinds of folks who are 
funded by Pell grants to get through 
college, paying zero—zero—in taxes. 
Why are the billionaires paying less 
than you and me? Why are they paying 
less than the clerk at the grocery store 
or the person bagging your groceries? 
Why are they paying less than the sec-
retaries? Why are they paying less in 
taxes, the billionaires? Good question. 
It shouldn’t be the case. So the re-
sponsible thing is to pay for the pack-
age with tax fairness for all Americans, 
everyone doing their fair share, includ-
ing our companies, some of which have 
posted tremendous, astronomical prof-
its while paying absolutely zero in 
taxes. 
If we turn the clock back to Henry 
David Thoreau, who said many inter-
esting things in his book, ‘‘On Walden 
Pond,’’ and one of the things he said is, 
‘‘What is the use of a house if you 
haven’t got a tolerable planet to put it 
on?’’ 
Well, his question was kind of look-
ing toward the future that we are now 
in, where the ravages of a heated plan-
et are destroying our forests, our fish-
ing, and our farming, undermining the 
foundations of our rural economy, cre-
ating storms that assault our shores, 
creating fires that burn down houses 
and towns as well as trees. 
It is time for us to act, and to act 
boldly, because we are under a red alert 
for the planet and we need to act. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Tennessee. 
BUDGET RESOLUTION 
Mr. HAGERTY. Madam President, as 
I said earlier in this debate, I agree 
that working to shore up our hard in-
frastructure is a worthy cause. Invest-
ing in infrastructure the right way is a 
wise investment in America’s future 
and in our long-term competitiveness. 
But that is not what we are being 
asked to vote on here. Rather, we have 
a package with some infrastructure 
that is good for our economy. Yet it is 
riddled with Big Government and mas-
sive deficit spending, over a quarter of 
a trillion dollars in the hole. 
And we want to rush through this as 
quickly as possible? 
There is a right way and a wrong way 
to pursue noble goals. And let’s be 
clear. The Democrat leadership has 
tied this infrastructure bill to their ef-
fort to use their 50-vote reconciliation 
process to fundamentally move Amer-
ica toward Western Europe-style so-
cialism, which as anyone can see 
today, brings with it limited oppor-
tunity, less innovation, crushing taxes, 
a bloated government bureaucracy, and 
cradle-to-grave 
government 
depend-
ency. 
Right on cue, Democrats have intro-
duced a $3.5 trillion part of the plan 
this morning, and the Democrat leader 
promised that the Senate will turn to 
it just as soon as this bill is passed. 
I wish this wasn’t the case. And all it 
would take for it not to be the case is 
for just one of my Democrat colleagues 
to say that they won’t support the $3.5 
billion part of this plan. 
I am still hopeful, but I remain con-
cerned, given the statements by Demo-
crats just like my colleague, who just 
spoke a minute ago, from Oregon. 
President Biden and Speaker PELOSI 
have been clear that this bipartisan 
deal on infrastructure won’t become 
law unless all of the socialist Big Gov-
ernment items that got excluded from 
the so-called track 1 of the first deal 
are later tacked on to it in track 2 of 
their plan. The Democrat leader is say-
ing this quite clearly, using the con-
sistent refrain of a two-track plan. 
They are doing this because the far 
left has pushed the Democrats over the 
edge. Whether the subject is court 
packing, election takeovers, or govern-
ment dependency, it is clear that the 
far left is calling the shots in the 
Democratic Party today. 
Sadly, Democrats view this infra-
structure bill as an important tool to 
advance the far left’s agenda. Demo-
crat leaders have promised to link it to 
trillions of dollars more in government 
taxing, spending, and dependency pro-
grams that this body will take up later 
this 
week. 
This 
smoke-and-mirrors 
charade is the kind of thing that 
makes Americans shake their heads. 
I have negotiated deals my whole ca-
reer, and often what is negotiated out 
of a deal is just as important as what is 
in it. There is not a deal if, at the last 
minute, the other side uses a side deal 
or a different program to put every-
thing in it that you never wanted. That 
is why, when we consider this infra-
structure bill, we must also look to the 
multitrillion-dollar, 
tax-and-spend 
path to socialism that the Democrat 
leaders have promised will be part of 
the total package. So Members of this 
body and the American people need to 
listen carefully to what is expected to 
be in this second part of the plan and 
try not to let your jaw hit the floor in 
the process. 
Just listen to what Democrats are 
promising to stuff into this reconcili-
ation bill. It will enable the Green New 
Deal. It will crush the American fossil 
fuel industry—never mind the fact that 
the industry is continuing to become 
ever more industry clean on its own. 
This will cost millions of American 
jobs. It will sacrifice the energy inde-
pendence we have already achieved, 
and it will make us more dependent on 
foreign adversaries. Ultimately, Demo-
crats would rather placate the far left’s 
near-religious fervor for government- 
subsidized electric cars and windmills, 
even if it means hollowing out Amer-
ican communities that provide our en-
ergy independence today. 
And they will jeopardize our national 
security in the process. It is a great 
deal for the green energy lobby which 
supports Democrat politicians, but it is 
a terrible deal for our Nation and for 
our national security. 
It will drastically increase taxes on 
job creators, which will cost untold 
number of jobs and reduce wages. Get 
ready to see more jobs shipped out of 
the United States and into the wel-
coming arms of China. Don’t worry, 
though, Democrats are proposing to 
create a Civilian Climate Corps that 
will hire some of the people who lose 
their jobs. To do what? Proselytize on 
the virtues of clean energy? 
It will impose one of the largest ever 
tax increases on American capital, re-
sulting in America having one of the 
highest tax rates on investment and 
capital in the industrialized world. 
Capital investment creates new jobs 
and innovation, and this will crush 
that process in America. 
It will expand the death tax that 
Americans must pay on savings and 
property of their loved ones that pass 
away. It will make it much harder for 
small businesses and farms to be passed 
on to the next generation. 
It will move America closer to a Eu-
ropean socialist model for healthcare, 
with less choice, longer wait times, and 
less quality. If we have learned any-
thing during the coronavirus pandemic, 
it 
is 
that 
we 
have 
the 
greatest 
healthcare 
system 
and 
healthcare 
workers in the world. The last thing we 
need to do is try to make our 
healthcare system weaker. 
It will nullify the State right-to- 
work laws and ensure American work-
ers don’t have a choice but to submit 
to union bosses. It is impossible to say 
how many good-paying jobs this will 
cost States like Tennessee, States that 
have experienced enormous growth and 
prosperity in recent decades by passing 
laws that put workers first by allowing 
them to choose whether or not they 
want to join a union. But union dues 
are used to fund Democrat political 
campaigns. 
So 
rather 
than 
make 
unions earn the support of workers, 
Democrats want to mandate it.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S6103 
August 9, 2021 
At a time when American small busi-
nesses are desperately looking for em-
ployees, this legislation will provide 
even more incentives for American 
workers not to work. Small businesses 
and American consumers will suffer as 
a result. 
It will provide more handouts to 
teachers unions who have refused to 
open schools in much of the country 
for the last year and a half. Teachers 
unions provide a great windfall benefit 
to Democrat political campaigns. 
It will provide more handouts to 
green unions and green energy inter-
ests, which conveniently fund the cam-
paigns of Democrat politicians. 
Are you noticing a trend yet? 
In addition to taking more American 
taxpayers’ hard-earned dollars, it will 
be debt-financed and not paid for, at 
least not by our generation. It may be 
convenient for today’s politicians, but 
our children and grandchildren will be 
left footing the bill. It will be so large 
that it will likely be beyond the capac-
ity of Congress to even oversee it to 
prevent the waste, fraud, and abuse 
that are sure to come. 
We should all be deeply concerned. 
Ultimately, this package is designed 
to create a permanent state of govern-
ment dependency and reliance for ev-
erything from jobs to your choice of 
doctors, to fueling your car. That way, 
you will have to turn to the institution 
Democrats have captured most: gov-
ernment and the unelected bureauc-
racy that controls virtually every-
thing. 
In the short term, this is a reckless, 
multitrillion-dollar step toward social-
ism—again, several trillion dollars. 
That is 13 digits, a number that many 
calculators don’t even have room for. 
This step will likely add further fuel to 
already rampant inflation. 
As we know, inflation is a hidden tax 
on all Americans, cutting into our sav-
ings, decreasing real earnings, and 
hurting our retirees most of all. 
Over the longer term, this path to so-
cialism will slow job creation and pro-
ductivity. It will reduce wages. It will 
ship jobs overseas. It will harm small 
businesses and workers and freeze in-
vestment right here in America. It will 
drastically increase taxes, and it will 
hobble innovative industries and tech-
nologies in which America was poised 
to lead. And Green New Deal mandates 
and regulations will crush industries 
where we currently do lead, such as the 
energy industry. 
With this massive expansion of ineffi-
cient government, bureaucratic gov-
ernment in our day-to-day lives will in-
crease. It is as if Democrats’ goal is to 
emulate the totalitarian central plan-
ners of the Chinese Communist Party. 
Rather than competing against China 
by creating a free market-driven envi-
ronment for innovation and job cre-
ation, which, by the way, is how we 
won the Cold War, Democrats seem to 
want to copy China’s model. 
This tax-and-spend spree by Demo-
crats will also burden our children and 
grandchildren with even more debt. 
Sadly, this isn’t a pig-in-a-python mo-
ment, and the harmful effects of this 
spending spree will last for genera-
tions. 
America is nearly $30 trillion in 
debt—$30 trillion. Thirty trillion is sig-
nificantly more than the total value of 
what our economy produces annually. 
As Democrats impose policies that will 
limit economic growth and produc-
tivity, our ability to pay our debts will 
become much more difficult. As the 
debt payments we owe continue to in-
crease and become a larger and larger 
share of the Federal revenue pie, we 
are going to leave our children with 
some really tough choices. 
So while I support hard infrastruc-
ture and working to find a right way to 
invest in it, joining it at the hip with 
a vision for America as a socialist uto-
pia isn’t it. The stakes are too high, 
and it is time to get serious about the 
path we are heading down. We must 
think beyond today and our short-term 
interests. We need to stop endangering 
our children’s and our grandchildren’s 
future while we still can, by getting 
our spending under control and devel-
oping a plan for paying down our debt, 
not by making it far worse. 
This multitrillion-dollar path to so-
cialism threatens the future of our 
country. It not only threatens to leave 
our children with an unpayable debt, 
but it also limits their ability to pay it 
off by smothering our economy with 
massive government bureaucracy that 
stifles the private-sector innovation 
that has until now led the world. 
America has always been a beacon of 
hope for the world because we are ex-
ceptional. We have provided more free-
dom, opportunity, and prosperity than 
any other nation. We have been proud 
of this exceptionalism and have care-
fully safeguarded it through genera-
tions. 
The strength of America is our 
unique system—our spirit, our work 
ethic, our compassion, and the commu-
nities we create. This multitrillion-dol-
lar plan, which increases government 
control and decreases freedom and op-
portunity, threatens the system at our 
core. 
Our government exists to preserve 
the freedoms that allow the American 
people and our communities to flour-
ish, not to control the American peo-
ple. And the American people will 
flourish, if permitted to do so. In this 
sense, the only thing that can stop 
America is America’s government by 
limiting our own people’s opportunity 
and our prosperity. 
I am asking my colleagues to fight to 
ensure that the America that we know 
endures for our children. The ‘‘greatest 
generation’’ gave us the most just and 
prosperous country in the history of 
the world, the country that won World 
War II and then the Cold War, and we 
must fight to preserve it, not throw it 
away. 
Because the President and Demo-
cratic leaders have bound this infra-
structure bill to a plan that will dra-
matically weaken America and reduce 
opportunity and prosperity for our peo-
ple, I will be casting a ‘‘no’’ vote and 
urge my colleagues to do the same. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ma-
jority leader. 
Mr. SCHUMER. Well, it has taken 
quite a while. There have been a lot of 
bumps in the road. But in a few min-
utes, I will announce that we have 
come to an agreement for final passage 
of the bipartisan infrastructure pro-
posal. 
Let me say this: It has taken quite a 
long time, and there have been detours 
and everything else, but this will do a 
whole lot of good for America, and the 
Senate can be proud it has passed this. 
As we move forward, we are pro-
ceeding on both tracks, the track of 
the bipartisan infrastructure proposal 
and the track of the budget resolution 
with reconciliation instructions. On 
our side of the aisle, we know we need 
both tracks—one dealing with tradi-
tional infrastructure and one dealing 
with climate and the problems Amer-
ican families face as they move into 
the new, global, transformational 21st 
century. 
So this is a very good day. We have 
come to an agreement after all the 
long, hard negotiating, the stops and 
starts. We are here, and it is a good 
thing—a very good thing—for America.

HARLEM 
HELLFIGHTERS 
CON-
GRESSIONAL GOLD MEDAL ACT 
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the Com-
mittee 
on 
Banking, 
Housing, 
and 
Urban Affairs be discharged from fur-
ther consideration and the Senate pro-
ceed to the immediate consideration of 
H.R. 3642. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will report the bill by title. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
read as follows: 
A bill (H.R. 3642) to award a Congressional 
gold medal to the 369th Infantry Regiment, 
commonly 
known 
as 
the 
‘‘Harlem 
Hellfighters’’, in recognition of their bravery 
and outstanding service during World War I. 
There being no objection, the com-
mittee was discharged and the Senate 
proceeded to consider the bill. 
Mr. SCHUMER. I ask unanimous con-
sent that the bill be considered read a 
third time and passed and that the mo-
tion to reconsider be considered made 
and laid upon the table. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
The bill (H.R. 3642) was ordered to a 
third reading, was read the third time, 
and passed. 
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, 
just a word, I was proud to be a cospon-
sor, along with Senator GILLIBRAND, of 
this legislation. 
The Harlem Hellfighters are an ex-
ample of bravery and courage under 
fire, and even though this regiment 
was consigned to racial segregation, 
they still loved America and fought 
hard for America and died for America. 
They are brave. They did a great job in 
World War I. 
It is unfortunate that it has taken so 
long for this country to recognize their 
bravery, because so many of our sol-
diers of color were not recognized for 
their service. But this brings us to a 
wonderful, wonderful moment where 
the Harlem Hellfighters will get the 
Congressional Gold Medal. 
I am very proud that we have done 
this.

OFFICER.

The senior assistant legislative clerk 
read as follows: 
A resolution (S. Res. 202) designating May

who have served, or are presently serving, in

HONORING THE LIVES AND LEG-
ACIES OF THE ‘‘RADIUM GIRLS’’ 
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the Com-
mittee on the Judiciary be discharged 
from further consideration and the 
Senate now proceed to S. Res. 285. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will report the resolution by 
title. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
read as follows: 
A resolution (S. Res. 285) honoring the 
lives and legacies of the ‘‘Radium Girls’’. 
There being no objection, the com-
mittee was discharged, and the Senate 
proceeded to consider the resolution. 
Mr. SCHUMER. I ask unanimous con-
sent that the Menendez substitute 
amendment at the desk to the resolu-
tion be agreed to; the resolution, as 
amended, be agreed to; the Menendez 
amendment at the desk to the pre-
amble be agreed; the preamble, as 
amended, be agreed to; and that the 
motions to reconsider be considered 
made and laid upon the table. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
The amendment (No. 2724) in the na-
ture of a substitute was agreed to as 
follows: 
(Purpose: In the nature of a substitute) 
Strike all after the enacting clause and in-
sert the following: ‘‘That the Senate— 
(1) honors the Radium Girls and their de-
termination to seek justice in the face of 
overwhelming obstacles; 
(2) recognizes the invaluable contributions 
of the Radium Girls to developing modern 
workplace safety standards; and 
(3) reaffirms the importance of protecting 
the health and safety of all workers in the 
United States. 
The resolution (S. Res. 285), as 
amended, was agreed to. 
The amendment (No. 2725) to the pre-
amble was agreed to as follows: 
(Purpose: To amend the preamble) 
Strike the preamble and insert the fol-
lowing: 
Whereas Marie and Pierre Curie discovered 
radium in 1898, sparking a craze for radium- 
infused consumer goods in the early 20th 
century; 
Whereas 
many 
entrepreneurs 
touted 
radium’s supposedly limitless curative prop-
erties, even as some scientists began to re-
port serious health hazards associated with 
the element; 
Whereas the ‘‘Radium Girls’’ were teen-
aged girls and young women who, starting in 
1917, worked in United States factories 
painting watch dials and airplane instru-
ments using glow-in-the-dark, radium-in-
fused paint; 
Whereas the early Radium Girls painted 
watches and instruments that United States 
troops relied on during World War I; 
Whereas the majority of the Radium Girls 
worked for corporations located in Orange, 
New Jersey, Ottawa, Illinois, and Waterbury, 
Connecticut; 
Whereas the Radium Girls primarily came 
from working-class backgrounds and some 
were first- and second-generation Americans; 
Whereas, in several instances, the radium 
corporations’ leadership knew that the ele-
ment could be harmful to human health, but 
they did not inform the Radium Girls of the 
risks or implement basic safety standards; 
Whereas, in many cases, the radium cor-
porations’ management encouraged the Ra-
dium Girls to keep their paintbrush tips 
moist and as fine as possible by putting the 
paint-covered brushes between their lips, a 
technique known as ‘‘lip-pointing’’; 
Whereas, due to lip-pointing, many of the 
early 
Radium 
Girls 
ingested 
extremely 
harmful quantities of radium; 
Whereas the Radium Girls breathed in ra-
dium-infused dust and touched radium-in-
fused paint, and they often glowed by the 
end of the workday due to the radioactive 
paint on their clothes and skin; 
Whereas many of the Radium Girls began 
to experience mysterious health problems, 
including necrosis (rotting) of the jaw, can-
cer, anemia, bone fractures, and infertility; 
Whereas many of the Radium Girls were 
eventually plagued by debilitating physical 
pain and severe disabilities; 
Whereas an unknown number of the ap-
proximately 4,000 Radium Girls died pre-
maturely or experienced the devastating 
health effects of radium poisoning; 
Whereas some physicians and dentists ini-
tially dismissed the Radium Girls’ hypoth-
esis that their illnesses were linked to their 
occupations; 
Whereas, in some cases, the radium cor-
porations conspired with members of the 
medical community to conceal the origins of 
the Radium Girls’ illnesses and smear their 
reputations; 
Whereas a number of the Radium Girls, in 
different States, fought to secure justice for 
themselves, their families, and their col-
leagues by suing the radium corporations; 
Whereas the Radium Girls’ difficult and 
prolonged legal battles and often horrific 
medical conditions drew national attention; 
Whereas some of the Radium Girls who 
challenged the radium corporations were 
shunned by their communities for harming 
the reputation of a prominent local em-
ployer; 
Whereas many of the surviving Radium 
Girls volunteered to participate in scientific 
studies on the effects of radium on the 
human body; 
Whereas investigations of the Radium 
Girls’ illnesses led to the creation of the new 
scientific field of human radiobiology; 
Whereas the Federal Government relied on 
data from the Radium Girls’ cases to develop 
safety standards for radium and other radio-
active materials for factory workers, med-
ical personnel, and scientists, including the 
workers and scientists of the Manhattan 
Project; 
Whereas some of the Radium Girls and 
their families received either no compensa-
tion or only meager compensation related to 
their harmful exposure to radium and their 
contributions to science; 
Whereas the Radium Girls’ highly pub-
licized case was among the first in which the 
courts held an employer responsible for the 
safety and health of its workers; 
Whereas the Radium Girls’ struggle was a 
turning point in the movement to promote 
workers’ safety and occupational health re-
forms; and 
Whereas many workers in the United 
States today are still fighting for a safe and 
equitable workplace: Now, therefore, be it 
The 
preamble, 
as 
amended,

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S6107 
August 9, 2021 
a bipartisan issue. The Infrastructure 
Investment and Jobs Act offers a once- 
in-a-generation vision for America’s in-
frastructure that is long overdue. This 
bipartisan 
infrastructure 
package 
makes the largest Federal investment 
in public transit, passenger rail, and 
bridges in more than 50 years. 
Gone are the days when ‘‘infrastruc-
ture’’ has meant only bridges, high-
ways, roads, and rail. While we need to 
invest in all of those areas, States like 
Vermont 
have 
infrastructure 
needs 
that also include climate resiliency, 
broadband, and renewable energy. That 
is exactly what this sweeping infra-
structure package does. 
The need for action in Vermont is 
clear. It is no secret that Vermont’s in-
frastructure is aging. For decades, in-
frastructure in Vermont has suffered 
from a systemic lack of investment. 
Vermont has more than 2,700 bridges, 
570 miles of freight railroad, 14,000 
miles of public road, and an overall C 
grade from the American Society of 
Civil Engineers—ASCE—for the condi-
tion of these facilities. There are 66 
bridges and over 666 miles of highway 
in the State that are in poor condition 
and need of repair. When it comes to 
stormwater and wastewater infrastruc-
ture, Vermont’s report card is even 
more dismal, receiving a D+ grade from 
ASCE, an unacceptable reality as our 
communities continue to see the im-
pacts of climate change and extreme 
weather. With the passage of this indis-
pensable infrastructure package, that 
will all change. The State of Vermont 
is expected to receive over $1.5 billion 
in formulaic funds to repair highways 
and bridges and also install a network 
of electric vehicle charging stations 
throughout the State. 
This desperately needed infrastruc-
ture 
package 
will 
help 
repair 
Vermont’s roads and bridges, while 
also creating good-paying jobs. It pro-
vides 
significant 
investments 
and 
makes key programmatic changes to 
competitive discretionary infrastruc-
ture programs to make more these 
Federal revenue streams more acces-
sible 
to 
small, 
rural 
States 
like 
Vermont. 
The bill tackles the challenge of 
bringing broadband to the 19 million 
Americans, including 60,000 Vermont 
homes, in rural areas and other parts 
of the country that still lack access to 
quality, high-speed internet service. 
Not only will the Infrastructure Invest-
ment and Jobs Act buildout broadband 
in unserved areas, it permanently es-
tablishes the Emergency Broadband 
Benefit program created through the 
passage of the American Rescue Plan 
Act 
renaming 
it 
the 
Affordable 
Connectivity Benefit program. This 
program will provide a $30 per month 
voucher for low-income families to use 
toward any internet service plan of 
their choosing. It builds on the EBB 
program by expanding eligibility to 
help 
more 
low-income 
households, 
while also making it more sustainable 
for taxpayers. 
Importantly, this package will also 
make significant down payments on 
climate resiliency initiatives to make 
Vermont more prepared to tackle the 
climate crisis, which has for too long 
been overlooked. Later this month will 
be the 10-year anniversary of Tropical 
Storm Irene. The devastation that oc-
curred as the storm swept through our 
State showed that we must build back 
better to make our communities and 
critical infrastructure more resilient 
to extreme climate events like Trop-
ical Storm Irene. And anyone who 
doubts the obvious link between our in-
frastructure needs and the climate cri-
sis need only look at what happened to 
Texas’s energy grid during the winter, 
or the devastating heat wave and 
drought taking place across the West 
this summer, where record tempera-
tures have literally melted power lines 
and buckled roads. 
The Infrastructure Investment and 
Jobs Act includes climate mitigation, 
adaptation, and resilience programs 
that are both pragmatic and forward- 
thinking. It includes record amounts of 
funding for weatherization assistance 
to reduce energy costs for low-income 
households, makes the largest invest-
ment in clean energy transmission and 
electric vehicle infrastructure in his-
tory, funds the electrification of thou-
sands of school and transit buses across 
the country, and establishes new pro-
grams to overhaul our energy grid and 
rapidly accelerate development and de-
ployment of battery storage tech-
nology. 
The bill amounts to the single larg-
est investment in clean drinking water 
in American history, including dedi-
cated funding to replace lead service 
lines and address the PFAS contamina-
tion in our communities, and provides 
an additional $40 million for water 
quality projects in the Lake Champlain 
Basin. Taken together, the Infrastruc-
ture Investment and Jobs Act will 
leave every community in Vermont 
better prepared to face the challenges 
of the 21st century and help restore 
American 
leadership 
in 
the 
fight 
against climate change. 
This significant legislative and stim-
ulus package shows what can be done 
when we all work together in the Sen-
ate. This hasn’t been easy, but it is im-
portant to Vermont and to our coun-
try, and thanks to these efforts, we 
will be able to repair roads and bridges, 
build electric charging stations, and 
build out broadband throughout the 
country. I hope that the Senate will 
pass this legislation today, and that 
the House of Representatives will soon 
consider this legislation, so President 
Biden can sign this historic infrastruc-
ture investment into law. 
Mr. BROWN. Madam President, I am 
pleased to see language in the State 
broadband grant program prioritizing 
employers 
with 
‘‘a 
demonstrated 
record of and plans to be in compliance 
with Federal labor and employment 
laws.’’ It is unfortunately common for 
employers to violate our Nation’s labor 
laws, from the National Labor Rela-
tions Act to the Occupational Safety 
and Health Act. 
The broadband industry, sadly, is no 
exception. 
In many industries, employers are 
engaging in rampant subcontracting 
and outsourcing. 
This situation is generally known as 
a ‘‘fissured workplace,’’ a circumstance 
where a primary employer outsources 
noncore business functions to subcon-
tracted firms but still maintains tight 
control over the outcomes of those sub-
contractors. 
These arrangements impede enforce-
ment of our Nation’s labor laws. 
At times, employers engage in these 
practices strategically to evade ac-
countability for labor law violations. 
I have worked with several Senators 
on this problem in the past, across the 
ideological 
spectrum 
and 
including 
with members who helped craft the bi-
partisan infrastructure package. 
It is my understanding that the lan-
guage in the State broadband grant 
program was written chiefly to ensure 
that 
American 
taxpayer 
dollars 
prioritize 
projects 
with 
both 
past 
records of strict compliance with Fed-
eral labor and employment laws and 
plans to continue compliance with fu-
ture projects. 
American taxpayer dollars should 
create good-paying American jobs. 
With its strong Buy America provi-
sions, the bipartisan infrastructure 
package works to do that. 
We need to ensure that Federal dol-
lars support good jobs and high stand-
ards and limits the use of subcontrac-
tors. 
There are many examples of ‘‘high 
road’’ employers who go above and be-
yond the minimum standards we set 
with our labor laws. 
That is the way it should be. 
I expect to see this funding prioritize 
such ‘‘high road’’ employers who use 
direct employees for projects.

HONORING CHIEF WARRANT 
OFFICER 2 BRYAN J. NICHOLS 
Mr. MORAN. Madam President, 10 
years ago I attended the memorial 
service for CW2 Bryan J. Nichols. I viv-
idly remember the outpouring of sup-
port from the Hays community as hun-
dreds of people lined the streets with 
American flags to honor their home-
town hero. 
On 
Friday, 
August 
6, 
2021, 
a 
memorilization ceremony was held in 
New Century, KS, by the Army Reserve 
Center and Aviation Support Center to 
once again honor the bravery and sac-
rifice of Chief Nichols. 
I have been told that Bryan knew his 
life’s purpose was to become a soldier, 
a calling he pursued to defend our free-
dom. 
He took his oath of enlistment in 
1996, swearing to protect our country 
from enemies foreign and domestic. 
After 9/11, he answered our country’s 
call to defend our homeland, serving on

multiple tours abroad, including in 
Iraq. 
As we approach the 20th anniversary 
of 9/11, the way Americans like Bryan 
dedicated themselves to their country 
following the attacks continues to 
move and inspire me. 
After graduating flight school in 2008, 
he was assigned as a pilot to the Army 
Reserve’s 7th Battalion of the 158th 
Aviation Regiment in New Century, 
KS. He deployed in May 2011 in support 
of Operation Enduring Freedom as a 
CH–47 Chinook pilot. 
On August 6, 2011, he gave his life for 
his country alongside 29 of his brothers 
in arms when his helicopter was shot 
down by enemy fire. It remains the sin-
gle deadliest loss of U.S. forces during 
the war in Afghanistan. 
The ultimate sacrifice he made a dec-
ade ago is a painful reminder that free-
dom is not free. And that it is the sol-
emn duty of our Nation to make cer-
tain his sacrifice—and those of all 
American heroes—are never forgotten. 
On Friday, that duty was fulfilled in 
a particularly special way with the Me-
morialization Ceremony remembering 
Chief Warrant Officer 2 Nichols as a 
fallen hero and beloved member of this 
community. 
As Kansans so naturally do, we have 
also seen the Hays community con-
tinue to keep his legacy at the fore-
front of our minds, from creating the 
annual Memorial Ride in his honor to 
dedicating the new flag pole outside 
Thomas More Prep-Marian High School 
in his name. 
Shortly after his passing, I was also 
pleased to support efforts to designate 
the junction of I–70 and US 183 as the 
‘‘CW2 Bryan J. Nichols fallen veterans 
memorial interchange.’’ This designa-
tion serves as a reminder to all those 
who drive by of the heroes who have 
safeguarded our opportunity to live in 
the strongest, freest, and greatest Na-
tion in the world. 
While Bryan was an American hero 
to all of us, he was also a son, brother, 
husband, and dad to those who loved 
him most. Military service is family 
service, and I want to recognize his 
family’s sacrifice to this country as 
well. Thank you. 
Our nation is forever indebted to 
Bryan for his service. 
May God bless our servicemembers 
and their loved ones.

ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS 
RECOGNIZING TENNESSEE 
OLYMPIANS 
∑ Mrs. BLACKBURN. Madam Presi-
dent, if the past year has taught us 
anything, it is that we should cherish 
the moments of joy and unity many 
Americans experienced while watching 
this year’s belated Summer Olympics. 
The athletes who earned a spot on 
Team U.S.A. have also won a very spe-
cial place in our history. While many 
sports fans watch the Games for the 
pageantry and spectacle, it is our 
champions who forge connections with 
their countrymen and cultivate a sense 
of pride and patriotism. 
It is my honor to recognize the fol-
lowing Tennesseans who did their 
country proud at the 2021 Tokyo Sum-
mer Olympics: Erica Bougard, of Mem-
phis; Wes Kitts, of Knoxville; Tennys 
Sandgren, of Gallatin; Alex Walsh, of 
Nashville; and Alex Young, of La 
Vergne. 
On behalf of all Tennesseans, I thank 
these Olympians for their passion, 
their perseverance, and their stunning 
displays of athleticism.∑ 
f 
TRIBUTE TO CLIFF HARRIS 
∑ Mr. BOOZMAN. Madam President, I 
rise today to recognize Cliff Harris, one 
of the newest inductees into the NFL 
Hall of Fame for his remarkable foot-
ball career with the Dallas Cowboys. 
Cliff is a proud Arkansan who has 
spent his life defying odds and dem-
onstrating that hard work and dedica-
tion pay off. 
Cliff was born in Fayetteville, AR, 
and grew up in the Hot Springs area 
where he began his football career as 
backup quarterback at Hot Springs 
High School. He earned a scholarship 
to Ouachita Baptist University—OBU— 
and followed in his father’s footsteps 
joining the Tiger football team. Cliff 
was extremely successful on the field 
where he was an accomplished defen-
sive back and a skilled kick returner. 
During his time at OBU, he was named 
to two All-Arkansas Intercollegiate 
Conference—AIC—teams 
and, 
during 
his freshman year, helped his team win 
the 1966 AIC Football Championship. 
Despite a stellar college football ca-
reer, Cliff was not selected in the 1970 
NFL draft. That didn’t prevent him 
from pursing his dream. He partici-
pated in the Cowboys training camp 
and signed as a free agent. Cliff’s perse-
verance paid off as he earned the start-
ing free safety position his rookie year. 
His NFL career was postponed when 
he was called to service in the U.S. 
Army. Following his military service, 
Cliff jumped right back into the game 
and helped the Cowboys earn Super 
Bowl victories in 1972 and 1978. 
Nicknamed ‘‘Captain Crash’’ for his 
ruthless tackles and ferocious pursuit 
of ball carriers, Cliff dominated the 
field and, even today, is heralded as 
one of the best free safeties to ever 
play the sport. Hall of Fame head 
coach George Allen described Cliff as a 
‘‘rolling ball of butcher knives.’’ 
In addition to playing in five Super 
Bowls, Cliff was named to the Pro Bowl 
six times and was named a first team 
All-Pro player for four consecutive sea-
sons. He was named to the Dallas Cow-
boys’ Silver Season All-Time Team, 
was selected by ‘‘Sports Illustrated’’ as 
the free safety on the magazine’s All- 
Time Dream Team, was given the NFL 
Alumni Legends Award, and was the 
free safety of the All-Decade Team for 
the 1970s. In 2004, Cliff was inducted 
into the Dallas Cowboys Ring of Honor. 
The Cliff Harris Award was named 
after him and is presented to the top 
defensive player in small college foot-
ball each year. Back in Arkansas, Har-
ris’s alma mater Ouachita Baptist Uni-
versity honored Cliff by naming its new 
football stadium the Cliff Harris Sta-
dium. 
From backup high school quarter-
back to two-time Super Bowl cham-
pion, Cliff has remained the same hard- 
working kid from Arkansas. Known for 
his vast knowledge of the game and 
strong leadership among the team, 
Cliff was an extremely well-liked and 
respected player. As a fellow Arkansan, 
I looked up to him not only because of 
his football skills but also his out-
standing character both on and off the 
field. 
I applaud Cliff for his outstanding ac-
complished career that has culminated 
with a spot in Canton. He deserves this 
recognition for his perseverance on the 
field and for the positive example he 
set for children in Arkansas and all 
across the country. We honor and sa-
lute one of my boyhood heroes who has 
never let us down.∑

REMEMBERING ISIDORE B. 
TORRES 
∑ Mr. PETERS. Madam President, I 
rise today to honor the memory and 
legacy of a trailblazer, the Honorable 
Isidore B. Torres, one of the first His-
panic judges in the State of Michigan 
and a prominent figure within the 
Michigan 
Latino 
community, 
who 
passed earlier this year. 
Born in 1947 in Texas to Chicano mi-
grant workers, Judge Torres began his 
life traveling between Texas and Michi-
gan, following whatever work was 
available, until later in his childhood 
when his parents settled in Bay City, 
MI, so their children could receive an 
education. Once settled, Judge Torres 
and his siblings were still expected to 
contribute to the family’s well-being 
and would come home from school to 
help their mother work in sugar beet 
fields outside of Bay City. 
Upon graduation from Bay City Cen-
tral High School in 1966, a guidance 
counselor advised Judge Torres not to 
pursue a legal education and instead 
suggested other careers, particularly 
those that were attached to Hispanic 
stereotypes and influenced by preju-
dice. Ignoring other’s doubts and racial 
biases, Judge Torres graduated with 
his bachelor’s degree in criminal jus-
tice from Michigan State University in 
1973 and later earned his law degree 
from Wayne State University in 1976. 
Beginning his career with Neighbor-
hood Legal Services in Detroit, in 1978, 
Judge Torres was hired by the city of 
Detroit as senior assistant corporation 
counsel and later cofounded the law 
firm of Torres & Horvath. In 1983, he 
was appointed by Governor Blanchard 
to the 36th District Court, where he be-
came the first Hispanic magistrate and 
later judge in the Wayne County court 
system.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S6109 
August 9, 2021 
Eventually, Judge Torres rose to the 
Wayne County Circuit Court and han-
dled first criminal and then civil cases 
until he retired in 2010. He was also ap-
pointed to serve on numerous commis-
sions including the Michigan Supreme 
Court 
Racial/Ethnic 
Task 
Force, 
Michigan Sentencing Guidelines Com-
mission and State Bar of Michigan 
Open Justice Commission. 
Throughout his successful career and 
during 
his 
well-earned 
retirement, 
Judge Torres remained humble and 
spent a large amount of time within 
the community helping people navi-
gate whatever legal troubles they had. 
He stayed strongly tied to and felt pas-
sionately about his Chicano roots and 
never lost sight of what was most im-
portant to him: working to ensure 
equal access to justice for all. 
I ask you and my fellow colleagues to 
join me in celebrating the life of the 
Honorable Isidore B. Torres. As we re-
member Judge Torres’ life, I hope his 
family—including 
spouse 
Goharik 
Karian Torres, children Felipe Torres, 
Laura Torres, Marissa Savitskie, and 
five grandchildren—finds comfort in 
the precious moments and memories 
they shared with him, in the lessons he 
taught them, and in the love he showed 
them.∑

S. RES. 344 
Whereas the State of Israel enjoyed ob-
server status in the predecessor organization

tion of African Unity until its dissolution in

Whereas 
the 
late 
Libyan 
dictator 
Moammar Gadhafi blocked Israel from ob-
taining observer status at the African Union 
in 2002; 
Whereas Israel, in the span of a few dec-
ades, has emerged as a developed nation and 
therefore offers an example of a path to eco-
nomic progress for developing countries; 
Whereas Israel has long been an active and 
valuable partner to many African nations, 
cultivating numerous strong bilateral rela-
tionships across the continent; 
Whereas 
Prime 
Minister

Netanyahu made a historic visit to Africa in 
July 2016 and became the first leader outside 
of Africa to address the Economic Commu-
nity of West African States (ECOWAS) in

of Ethiopia, the Republic of Ghana, the Re-
public of Coˆte d’Ivoire, the Republic of 
Kenya, the Republic of Rwanda, the Republic 
of Sierra Leone, the Togolese Republic, and 
the Republic of Zambia; 
Whereas the Abraham Accords paved the 
way for further normalization agreements 
between Israel and other nations; 
Whereas Israel has supported African na-
tions through economic investments and hu-
manitarian assistance; and 
Whereas, on July 22, 2021, the African

tween the State of Israel and African na-
tions, particularly in areas that are signifi-
cant in progress towards the implementation 
of the Sustainable Development Goals, such

and humanitarian development; 
(2) expects Israel’s observer status in the 
African Union will help enable such coopera-
tion to develop between Israel and the Afri-
can Union; 
(3) commends the African Union for grant-
ing Israel observer status in the African 
Union; and 
(4) thanks Felix Tshisekedi, the President

in strengthening Israel-African relations by 
ensuring the recognition of Israel under ob-
server status occurred during his tenure as

they did not recognize the legitimacy of the 
election results; 
Whereas after the August 9, 2020 presi-
dential election, the Government of Belarus 
responded to the resulting peaceful protests, 
the largest in the country’s history, with a 
violent crackdown, including the detention 
of more than 10,000 peaceful protectors, ac-
cording to the United Nations Special 
Rapporteur on the situation of human rights 
in Belarus; 
Whereas the Government of Belarus, under 
the misrule of the Lukashenka regime, con-
tinues to engage in a pattern of clear and 
persistent violations of human rights and 
fundamental freedoms and disrespects the 
basic principles of democratic governance by 
subjecting tens of thousands of pro-democ-
racy political activists, peaceful protesters, 
and ordinary citizens to harassment, beat-
ings, abductions, forced deportations, and 
imprisonment and by committing acts of 
transnational repression to punish any dis-
sent expressed by Belarusian citizens; 
Whereas the Lukashenka regime continues 
to silence independent media, such as Nasha 
Niva, tut.by, and Belsat, and has unlawfully 
raided the offices of media outlets, including 
Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, and ar-
rested journalists; 
Whereas on September 11, 2020, then-Dep-
uty Secretary of State Stephen Biegun said 
that ‘‘we stand by our long-term commit-
ment to support the sovereignty of Belarus 
as well as its territorial integrity, as the as-
pirations of the Belarusian people to deter-
mine their own path remains in front of us’’; 
Whereas on May 23, 2021, the Lukashenka 
regime forced a commercial airliner flying 
between two European Union member states 
to land in Minsk in order for the regime to 
arrest journalist Raman Pratasevich and his 
partner Sofia Sapega, an action that resulted 
in near universal condemnation from the 
international community and coordinated 
sanctions by the United States, the United 
Kingdom, and the European Union; 
Whereas on May 28, 2021, the White House 
announced the re-imposition of full blocking 
sanctions against nine Belarusian state- 
owned enterprises and announced a new Ex-
ecutive order to increase sanctions on ele-
ments of the Lukashenka regime; 
Whereas the Lukashenka regime has ac-
tively encouraged over 4,000 migrants from 
other countries to cross through Belarus into 
European Union member state Lithuania, 
amounting to people smuggling and obliging 
Lithuania to declare a state of emergency; 
Whereas on June 9, 2021, the Committee on 
Foreign Relations of the Senate held a hear-
ing regarding the political situation in 
Belarus, in which United States Ambassador 
to Belarus Julie Fisher testified that ‘‘De-
spite the oppression, the violence, and the 
turmoil that followed the events of the past 
year provide glimmers of hope. A new gen-
eration of brave Belarusians, with coura-
geous women at the front, have emerged.

chart its own path. They represent a Belarus 
in which wearing a red and white dress, 
hanging a flag, or playing a particular song 
will not result in torture, forced confessions, 
or even death.’’; 
Whereas on July 27, 2021, President Biden 
met Belarusian opposition leader Sviatlana 
Tsikhanouskaya at the White House and de-
clared that ‘‘The United States stands with 
the people of Belarus in their quest for de-
mocracy and universal human rights.’’; 
Whereas on August 9, 2021, President 
Biden— 
(1) announced an Executive order author-
izing the imposition of blocking sanctions on 
certain sectors of the Belarus economy, in-
cluding the potash, tobacco products, and 
construction sectors; and 
(2) pursuant to such executive order and 
Executive Order 13405, issued additional 
sanctions on Belarusian individuals and enti-
ties, including Belaruskali (a state-owned 
potash fertilizer company) and the Belarus 
National Olympic Committee; and 
Whereas 
Belarusian 
opposition 
leader 
Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya continues to rep-
resent the widely shared desire of the 
Belarusian people for free and fair elections 
and democracy: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) continues, on the first anniversary of 
the illegitimate presidential election in 
Belarus on August 9, 2020, to refuse to recog-
nize Alyaksandr Lukashenka as the legiti-
mately elected leader of Belarus; 
(2) condemns Lukashenka’s ongoing crack-
down on members of the pro-democracy

ical professionals, professors, teachers, ath-
letes, and cultural leaders; 
(3) continues to call for the fulfillment by 
the Government of Belarus of Belarus’ freely

participate in the OSCE process; 
(4) calls for new presidential and par-
liamentary elections to be held in Belarus, 
conducted in a manner that is free and fair

(8) condemns the forced diversion of 
Ryanair 
Flight

DUCKWORTH, Mr. LUJA´ N, Mr. PETERS, 
Mr. DURBIN, and Ms. ERNST) submitted 
the following resolution; which was 
considered and agreed to: 
S. RES. 346 
Whereas investment in the education, 
training, and career advancement of the 
workforce in the United States, known as 
‘‘workforce development’’, is crucial to the 
ability of the United States to compete in 
the global economy; 
Whereas collaboration among Governors, 
local governments, State and local edu-
cation, workforce, and human services agen-
cies, community colleges, local businesses, 
employment service providers, community- 
based organizations, and workforce develop-
ment boards provides for long-term, sustain-
able, and successful workforce development 
across traditional sectors and emerging in-
dustries; 
Whereas jobs that require more than a 
high school diploma but not a 4-year degree 
comprise 52 percent of the labor market, but 
only 42 percent of workers in the United 
States have been able to access training at 
that level, creating a discrepancy that may 
limit growth in changing industries such as 
health care, manufacturing, and information 
technology; 
Whereas 76 percent of business leaders say 
greater investment in skills training would 
help their businesses; 
Whereas, as of summer 2021 in the United 
States— 
(1) nearly 10,000,000 individuals are unem-
ployed; 
(2) unemployment rates for Black and His-
panic adults are well above the unemploy-
ment rates for White adults; 
(3) workers without a bachelor’s degree are 
nearly 2 times more likely to be unem-
ployed; 
(4) more than 1⁄2 of the jobs lost due to the 
Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID–19) pan-
demic were by workers earning less than 
$40,000 per year; and 
(5) according to a recent poll, nearly 1⁄2 of 
workers said they will need to learn new 
skills in the next year to do their jobs, while 
more than 1⁄2 said they would retrain for a 
career in a different field or industry if they 
had the opportunity; 
Whereas, as of June 2021, employment 
rates among workers with lower levels of 
educational attainment remained far below 
pre-COVID–19 pandemic levels, including 7.2 
percent below those levels for workers with a 
high school diploma and 10.1 percent below 
those levels for workers without a high 
school diploma, even as workers with higher 
levels of educational attainment have nearly 
returned to pre-COVID–19 pandemic employ-
ment levels; 
Whereas, in 2014, Congress reauthorized the 
Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act 
(29 U.S.C. 3101 et seq.) with overwhelming bi-
partisan support in recognition of the need 
to strengthen the focus of the United States 
on the skills necessary to fill jobs in local 
and regional industries; 
Whereas the Workforce Innovation and Op-
portunity Act (29 U.S.C. 3101 et seq.) supports 
employment, training, and support services 
for individuals with barriers to employment, 
including— 
(1) individuals who earn low incomes; 
(2) individuals who are out of work, includ-
ing the long-term unemployed; 
(3) individuals displaced by outsourcing; 
(4) individuals living in rural areas or areas 
with persistently high unemployment; 
(5) individuals looking to learn new skills; 
and 
(6) individuals with disabilities; 
Whereas the more than 550 workforce de-
velopment boards and 2,400 American Job 
Centers are a driving force behind growing 
regional economies by providing training, re-
sources, and assistance to workers who aim 
to compete in the 21st century economy; 
Whereas ongoing State and local imple-
mentation of the Workforce Innovation and 
Opportunity Act (29 U.S.C. 3101 et seq.) pro-
vides unprecedented opportunities to develop 
the skills of workers in the United States 
through access to effective, quality work-
force education and training, including the 
development and delivery of proven strate-
gies such as sector partnerships, career path-
ways, integrated education and training, 
work-based learning models, and paid intern-
ships; 
Whereas, in 2019, programs authorized 
under the Workforce Innovation and Oppor-
tunity Act (29 U.S.C. 3101 et seq.)— 
(1) served nearly 6,300,000 young people and 
adults; and 
(2) exceeded employment targets across all 
programs; 
Whereas State programs established under 
the Wagner-Peyser Act (29 U.S.C. 49 et 
seq.)— 
(1) ensured that more than 3,400,000 work-
ers, including more than 212,000 veterans, 
had access to career services through Amer-
ican Job Centers in 2019; and 
(2) are a foundational part of the workforce 
development system; 
Whereas workforce development programs 
will play a critical role in addressing the 
500,000 additional jobs that remain open in 
manufacturing industries compared to pre- 
COVID–19 pandemic levels;

August 9, 2021 
Whereas community colleges and other 
workforce development training providers 
across the United States are well situated— 
(1) to train the next generation of workers 
in the United States; and 
(2) to address the educational challenges 
created by emerging industries and techno-
logical advancements; 
Whereas participation in a career and tech-
nical education (referred to in this preamble 
as ‘‘CTE’’) program decreases the risk of stu-
dents dropping out of high school, and all 50 
States and the District of Columbia report 
higher graduation rates for CTE students, as 
compared to other students; 
Whereas community and technical colleges 
operate as open access institutions serving 
millions of students annually at a compara-
tively low cost; 
Whereas the Strengthening Career and 
Technical Education for the 21st Century 
Act (Public Law 115–224; 132 Stat. 1563) sup-
ports the development and implementation 
of high-quality CTE programs that— 
(1) combine rigorous academic content 
with occupational skills; and 
(2) served approximately 12,500,000 high 
school and college students between 2018 and 
2019; 
Whereas there are more than 600,000 reg-
istered apprentices in the United States, and 
there is growing and bipartisan support for 
expanding quality earn-and-learn strategies 
to help current and future workers gain 
skills and work experience; 
Whereas the federally supported workforce 
system and partner programs— 
(1) have helped rebuild the economy of the 
United States and provide increased eco-
nomic opportunities; and 
(2) provide a pathway into 21st century 
jobs that support families while ensuring 
that businesses in the United States find the 
skilled workforce needed to compete in the 
global economy; and 
Whereas workforce development is crucial 
to sustaining economic security for workers 
in the United States: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) designates September 2021 as ‘‘National 
Workforce Development Month’’; 
(2) supports Federal initiatives to promote 
workforce development; and 
(3) acknowledges that workforce develop-
ment plays a crucial role in supporting 
workers and growing the economy.

Mr. 
MCCONNELL, 
and 
Mr. 
PETERS) submitted the following reso-
lution; 
which 
was 
considered 
and 
agreed to: 
S. RES. 347 
Whereas the members of the airborne 
forces of the Armed Forces of the United 
States have a long and honorable history as 
bold and fierce warriors who, for the na-
tional security of the United States and the 
defense of freedom and peace, project the 
ground combat power of the United States 
by air transport to the far reaches of the bat-
tle area and to the far corners of the world; 
Whereas, on June 25, 1940, experiments 
with airborne operations by the United 
States began when the Army Parachute Test 
Platoon was first authorized by the Depart-
ment of War; 
Whereas, in July 1940, 48 volunteers began 
training for the Army Parachute Test Pla-
toon; 
Whereas the first official Army parachute 
jump took place on August 16, 1940, to test 
the innovative concept of inserting United 
States ground combat forces behind a battle 
line by means of a parachute; 
Whereas the success of the Army Para-
chute Test Platoon before the entry of the 
United States into World War II validated 
the airborne operational concept and led to 
the creation of a formidable force of airborne 
formations that included the 11th, 13th, 17th, 
82nd, and 101st Airborne Divisions; 
Whereas, included in those divisions, and 
among 
other 
separate 
formations, 
were 
many airborne combat, combat support, and 
combat service support units that served 
with distinction and achieved repeated suc-
cess in armed hostilities during World War 
II; 
Whereas the achievements of the airborne 
units during World War II prompted the evo-
lution of those units into a diversified force 
of parachute and air-assault units that, over 
the years, have fought in Korea, the Domini-
can Republic, Vietnam, Grenada, Panama, 
the Persian Gulf region, and Somalia, and 
have engaged in peacekeeping operations in 
Lebanon, Egypt’s Sinai Peninsula, Haiti, 
Bosnia, and Kosovo; 
Whereas, since the terrorist attacks of 
September 11, 2001, the members of the 
United States airborne forces, including 
members of the XVIII Airborne Corps, the 
82nd Airborne Division, the 101st Airborne 
Division (Air Assault), the 173rd Airborne 
Brigade Combat Team, the 4th Brigade Com-
bat Team (Airborne) of the 25th Infantry Di-
vision, the 75th Ranger Regiment, special op-
erations forces of the Army, Marine Corps, 
Navy, and Air Force, and other units of the 
Armed Forces, have demonstrated bravery 
and honor in combat, stability, and training 
operations in Afghanistan and Iraq; 
Whereas the modern-day airborne forces 
also include other elite forces composed of 
airborne trained and qualified special oper-
ations warriors, including Army Special 
Forces, Marine Corps Reconnaissance units, 
Navy SEALs, and Air Force combat control 
and pararescue teams; 
Whereas, of the members and former mem-
bers of the United States airborne forces, 
thousands have achieved the distinction of 
making combat jumps, dozens have earned 
the Medal of Honor, and hundreds have 
earned the Distinguished Service Cross, the 
Silver Star, or other decorations and awards 
for displays of heroism, gallantry, intre-
pidity, and valor; 
Whereas the members and former members 
of the United States airborne forces are all 
members of a proud and honorable tradition 
that, together with the special skills and 
achievements of those members, distin-
guishes the members as intrepid combat 
parachutists, air assault forces, special oper-
ation forces, and, in the past, glider infantry; 
Whereas individuals from every State of 
the United States have served gallantly in 
the airborne forces, and each State is proud 
of the contributions of its paratrooper vet-
erans during the many conflicts faced by the 
United States; 
Whereas the history and achievements of 
the members and former members of the 
United States airborne forces warrant spe-
cial expressions of the gratitude of the peo-
ple of the United States; and 
Whereas, since the airborne forces, past 
and present, celebrate August 16 as the anni-
versary of the first official jump by the 
Army Parachute Test Platoon, August 16 is 
an appropriate day to recognize as National 
Airborne Day: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) designates August 16, 2021, as ‘‘National 
Airborne Day’’; and 
(2) calls on the people of the United States 
to observe National Airborne Day with ap-

following resolution; which was consid-
ered and agreed to: 
S. RES. 348 
Whereas, in enacting the Americans with 
Disabilities Act of 1990 (42 U.S.C. 12101 et 
seq.), Congress recognized that ‘‘historically, 
society has tended to isolate and segregate 
individuals with disabilities, and, despite 
some improvements, such forms of discrimi-
nation against individuals with disabilities 
continue to be a serious and pervasive social 
problem’’; 
Whereas the Americans with Disabilities 
Act of 1990 recognized the rights of individ-
uals with disabilities to fully participate in 
their communities through independent liv-
ing, equality of opportunity, and economic 
self-sufficiency; 
Whereas, 31 years after the enactment of 
the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 
and 22 years after the decision of the Su-
preme 
Court 
of 
the 
United 
States 
in 
Olmstead v. L.C., 527 U.S. 581 (1999), many in-
dividuals with disabilities continue to live in 
segregated institutional settings because of 
a lack of support services; 
Whereas continued instances of segregated 
institutional settings have hindered the in-
clusion of individuals with disabilities in 
communities, schools, and workplaces, un-
dermining the promise of the Americans 
with Disabilities Act of 1990; 
Whereas people with disabilities living in 
institutional and long-term care settings 
suffered disproportionate rates of infection 
and death during the COVID–19 pandemic, 
with data showing 60 percent of COVID–19 
deaths involved a person with a disability; 
Whereas people of color with disabilities 
experience disproportionately greater bar-
riers to quality, accessible health care, edu-
cation, and employment opportunities, in-
fringing on the right of such people under 
the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 
to full participation in their communities; 
Whereas, 31 years after the enactment of 
the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, 
people with disabilities continue to face 
higher rates of unemployment and barriers 
to accessible workplaces and access to com-
petitive integrated employment opportuni-
ties.

August 9, 2021 
Whereas, 31 years after the enactment of 
the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, 
some telecommunication, electronic, and in-
formation technologies continue to be devel-
oped without the goal of full accessibility 
and inclusion for all people of the United 
States; and 
Whereas, 31 years after the enactment of 
the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, 
many businesses, public and private organi-
zations, transportation systems, and services 
are still not accessible to all individuals 
with disabilities: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) recognizes the importance of inde-
pendent living for individuals with disabil-
ities made possible by the enactment of the 
Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (42 
U.S.C. 12101 et seq.); 
(2) encourages all people of the United 
States to celebrate the advancement of in-

possible by the enactment of the Americans

(3) pledges to continue to work on a bipar-

Whereas, in 1942, the Federal Government 
ordered that a Maryland National Guard 
Training Ground be turned into a War De-

Military 
Intelligence 
Training 
Center, which was named Camp Ritchie after 
the late Governor, Albert C. Ritchie; 
Whereas, starting in 1942, more than 19,000

Whereas, while the approximately 2,800 ref-

entry of the United States into World War II 
only constituted approximately 14 percent of 
the total number of Ritchie Boys, they had 
the strongest motivation to return to Europe 
and fight for their newly adopted country; 
Whereas the Ritchie Boys included— 
(1) soldiers of many faiths (including 
Protestant, Jewish, and Catholic soldiers); 
(2) both soldiers born in the United States 
and foreign-born soldiers from more than 70 
countries; 
(3) soldiers with German, Japanese (Nisei), 
and other language skills; and 
(4) more importantly, soldiers with general 
intelligence skills suitable for being trained 
as order-of-battle specialists, counterintel-
ligence operatives, photo interpreters, psy-
chological warfare experts, and other spe-
cialists; 
Whereas, during World War II, Ritchie 
Boys were assigned to every unit of the 
Army and the Marines as well as to the Of-
fice of Strategic Services and the Counter 
Intelligence Corps; 
Whereas, starting in 1942, the Ritchie Boys 
were sent as individual specialists to the Su-
preme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary 
Force (‘‘SHAEF’’) in small elite teams to 
join combat units in the North African, Med-
iterranean, European, and Pacific theaters 
and 
to 
military 
camps, 
prisoner-of-war 
camps, and interrogation centers (such as 
Fort Hunt, VA) in the United States; 
Whereas the Ritchie Boys accompanied the 
Army on D-Day in Europe as foot soldiers 
with all Army divisions and as paratroopers 
with all airborne divisions and were often se-
lected to be the second soldier to land after 
the commander in order to provide needed 
immediate interpretation in languages such 
as French, German, and Italian; 
Whereas the Ritchie Boys served as per-
sonal interpreters for General George Patton 
and other military leaders; 
Whereas the Ritchie Boys served honorably 
in the Pacific in the assaults on Guadal-
canal, Okinawa, Iwo Jima, and the Phil-
ippines, including 2 Marine Corps Ritchie 
Boys who died in the initial landing on Iwo 
Jima and a Ritchie Boy who was awarded the 
Medal of Honor posthumously for bravery; 
Whereas about 140 Ritchie Boys lost their 
lives during World War II; 
Whereas the Ritchie Boys garnered more 
than 65 Silver Star Medals and numerous 
Bronze Star Medals as well as at least 5 Le-
gion of Honor and many Croix de Guerre 
Medals; 
Whereas, among the 150-man Second Mo-
bile Radio Broadcast Company of the Ritchie 
Boys, 6 members received the Croix de 
Guerre Medal and at least 15 received Bronze 
Star Medals for service and bravery; 
Whereas the Ritchie Boys made significant 
contributions to the success of the Allied 
Forces on the Western Front through their 
knowledge and their skills, as demonstrated 
by a classified postwar report by the Army 
finding that the Ritchie Boys were the 
source of nearly 60 percent of the credible in-
telligence gathered in Europe during World 
War II; 
Whereas many of the Ritchie Boys contin-
ued to serve their country following the con-
clusion of World War II, including through 
service as translators or interrogators pros-
ecuting war criminals with the Judge Advo-
cate General’s Office during trials at Dachau 
and Nuremberg; 
Whereas the Ritchie Boys include such no-
table figures as David Rockefeller, Archibald 
Roosevelt Jr, William Sloane Coffin, Philip 
Johnson, J.D. Salinger, and William War-
field, as well as Senators John Chafee of 
Rhode Island and Frank Church of Idaho, 
and the father of the current senior Senator 
from Oregon, Ron Wyden; 
Whereas the Ritchie Boys also contributed 
outside of the military through careers as 
writers, artists, architects, academics, dip-
lomats, 
economists, 
financiers, 
philan-
thropists, and psychologists; 
Whereas, because the roles of the Ritchie 
Boys remained classified for decades, the 
public generally lacks awareness of their 
contributions; 
Whereas Camp Ritchie closed in 1998, and a 
museum and educational center is now being 
planned for the location; and 
Whereas, approximately 200 Ritchie Boys 
are still living, ranging in age between 95 
and 107: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) honors the bravery and dedication of 
the Ritchie Boys; 
(2) recognizes the importance of their con-
tributions to the success of the Allied Forces 
during World War II; and 
(3) respectfully requests that the Secretary 
of the Senate transmit an enrolled copy of 
this resolution to Mr. Landon Grove of the 
Ritchie History Museum.

lution;

agreed to: 
S. RES. 350 
Whereas the 200th anniversary of the entry 
of Missouri into the Union as the 24th State 
marks a time for Missourians and all people 
of the United States to remember the past 
and celebrate the future, including recog-
nizing the significant contributions of the 
State of Missouri to the culture, governance, 
and intellect of the United States; 
Whereas Congress and President James 
Monroe approved statehood and entry into 
the Union for the Missouri Territory on Au-
gust 10, 1821, making it the Nation’s 24th 
State and the ‘‘Gateway to the West’’; 
Whereas the City of Jefferson, lying on the 
Missouri River, was named the Missouri 
State capital in 1821 for President Thomas 
Jefferson, the third President of the United 
States; 
Whereas the State served as the ‘‘Gateway 
to the West’’, symbolized by the Gateway 
Arch in St. Louis, Missouri, representing a 
new beginning for so many people in the 
United States and marking the beginning for 
Lewis and Clark, the Pony Express, the Or-
egon and Santa Fe Trails, and individuals 
venturing West to test their luck in the Gold 
Rush; 
Whereas, despite the State’s role in some 
dark moments in the history of the United 
States, Missouri proves that we can have a 
brighter future, as evidenced by the fact that 
as commander of the District of South-
eastern Missouri, General Ulysses S. Grant 
utilized the Mississippi River to combat Con-
federate forces, and Francis Preston Blair, 
Jr., who later became a United States Sen-
ator, fought for the Union and organized the 
protection of Jefferson Barracks in St. 
Louis, which contributed to the Confederate 
defeat in Missouri; 
Whereas General John Pershing, born in 
Laclede, Missouri, was president and first 
captain of the West Point class of 1886, be-
came a 5-star general and commander of the 
American Expeditionary Forces (AEF) dur-
ing World War I and served as the Chief of 
Staff of the United States Army from 1921 to 
1924; 
Whereas Missouri is the birthplace of 
President Harry S. Truman, the 33rd Presi-
dent, who— 
(1) served as a captain in World War I, a 
United States Senator, and Vice President 
before succeeding President Franklin D. 
Roosevelt; 
(2) oversaw the end of World War II and 
rocketed the United States to the inter-
national stage through his foreign policy, in-
cluding the founding of the United Nations 
and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization 
(‘‘NATO’’) and the recognition of Israel; and 
(3) promoted the advancement of civil 
rights by desegregating the United States

Whereas Marie and Pierre Curie discovered

Whereas 
many 
entrepreneurs 
touted 
radium’s supposedly limitless curative prop-
erties, even as some scientists began to re-
port serious health hazards associated with 
the element; 
Whereas the ‘‘Radium Girls’’ were teen-
aged girls and young women who, starting in 
1917, worked in United States factories 
painting watch dials and airplane instru-
ments using glow-in-the-dark, radium-in-
fused paint; 
Whereas the early Radium Girls painted 
watches and instruments that United States

August 9, 2021 
Whereas the majority of the Radium Girls 
worked for corporations located in Orange, 
New Jersey, Ottawa, Illinois, and Waterbury, 
Connecticut; 
Whereas the Radium Girls primarily came 
from working-class backgrounds and some 
were first- and second-generation Americans; 
Whereas, in several instances, the radium 
corporations’ leadership knew that the ele-
ment could be harmful to human health, but 
they did not inform the Radium Girls of the 
risks or implement basic safety standards; 
Whereas, in many cases, the radium cor-
porations’ management encouraged the Ra-
dium Girls to keep their paintbrush tips 
moist and as fine as possible by putting the 
paint-covered brushes between their lips, a 
technique known as ‘‘lip-pointing’’; 
Whereas, due to lip-pointing, many of the 
early 
Radium 
Girls 
ingested 
extremely 
harmful quantities of radium; 
Whereas the Radium Girls breathed in ra-
dium-infused dust and touched radium-in-
fused paint, and they often glowed by the 
end of the workday due to the radioactive 
paint on their clothes and skin; 
Whereas many of the Radium Girls began 
to experience mysterious health problems, 
including necrosis (rotting) of the jaw, can-
cer, anemia, bone fractures, and infertility; 
Whereas many of the Radium Girls were 
eventually plagued by debilitating physical 
pain and severe disabilities; 
Whereas an unknown number of the ap-
proximately 4,000 Radium Girls died pre-
maturely or experienced the devastating 
health effects of radium poisoning; 
Whereas some physicians and dentists ini-
tially dismissed the Radium Girls’ hypoth-
esis that their illnesses were linked to their 
occupations; 
Whereas, in some cases, the radium cor-
porations conspired with members of the 
medical community to conceal the origins of 
the Radium Girls’ illnesses and smear their 
reputations; 
Whereas a number of the Radium Girls, in 
different States, fought to secure justice for 
themselves, their families, and their col-
leagues by suing the radium corporations; 
Whereas the Radium Girls’ difficult and 
prolonged legal battles and often horrific 
medical conditions drew national attention; 
Whereas some of the Radium Girls who 
challenged the radium corporations were 
shunned by their communities for harming 
the reputation of a prominent local em-
ployer; 
Whereas many of the surviving Radium 
Girls volunteered to participate in scientific 
studies on the effects of radium on the 
human body; 
Whereas investigations of the Radium 
Girls’ illnesses led to the creation of the new 
scientific field of human radiobiology; 
Whereas the Federal Government relied on 
data from the Radium Girls’ cases to develop 
safety standards for radium and other radio-
active materials for factory workers, med-
ical personnel, and scientists, including the 
workers and scientists of the Manhattan 
Project; 
Whereas some of the Radium Girls and 
their families received either no compensa-
tion or only meager compensation related to 
their harmful exposure to radium and their 
contributions to science; 
Whereas the Radium Girls’ highly pub-
licized case was among the first in which the 
courts held an employer responsible for the 
safety and health of its workers; 
Whereas the Radium Girls’ struggle was a 
turning point in the movement to promote 
workers’ safety and occupational health re-
forms; and 
Whereas many workers in the United 
States today are still fighting for a safe and 
equitable workplace: Now, therefore, be it 
SA 2726. Mr. SCHUMER (for Mr. 
JOHNSON) proposed an amendment to 
the resolution S. Res. 319, expressing 
support for the designation of July 2021 
as 
‘‘National 
Sarcoma 
Awareness 
Month’’; as follows: 
Beginning in the first whereas clause of 
the preamble, strike ‘‘Whereas sarcoma’’ and 
all that follows through the semicolon at the 
end of the fourth whereas clause and insert 
the following: 
Whereas sarcoma is a rare cancer of the 
bones or connective tissues, such as nerves, 
muscles, joints, fat, and blood vessels, that 
can arise nearly anywhere in the body; 
Whereas, in the United States— 
(1) about 16,000 individuals are diagnosed 
with sarcoma each year; 
(2) approximately 7,000 individuals die from 
sarcoma each year; and 
(3) about 50,000 individuals struggle with 
sarcoma at any 1 time; 
Whereas, each year, about 1 percent of can-
cers diagnosed in adults and around 20 per-
cent of cancers diagnosed in children are sar-
coma; 
Whereas more than 70 subtypes of sarcoma 
have been identified; 
Whereas the potential causes of sarcoma 
are not well understood; 
Whereas treatment for sarcoma can in-
clude surgery, radiation therapy, or chemo-
therapy;

ORDER FOR ADJOURNMENT 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, if 
there is no further business to come be-
fore the Senate, I ask unanimous con-
sent that it stand adjourned under the 
previous order, following the remarks 
of Senator WYDEN and Senator WHITE-
HOUSE. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
The Senator from Oregon. 
H.R. 3684 
Mr. WYDEN. Madam President, as we 
have just heard, thankfully, instruc-
tion is almost complete on the infra-
structure 
bill. 
Once 
infrastructure 
passes, it is on to the budget resolu-
tion, which lays the foundation to pass 
Build Back Better this fall. 
The Senate Finance Committee is 
immersed in this effort. For several 
months, we have been working with 
members of the committee on a host of 
proposals that are included in the reso-
lution. These proposals stem from es-
sential American priorities, making it 
easier to support a middle-class family, 
lowering the cost of healthcare, and ad-
dressing the climate crisis. 
When you focus on those key prior-
ities, you build a stronger, more fair 
economy and create good-paying jobs. 
There is going to be a lot to say about 
these issues in the hours and days 
ahead. Tonight, I will take just a few 
minutes to discuss the Finance Com-
mittee’s work and why the policies are 
so important. I will begin with support 
for American families. 
For decades, typical working families 
in Oregon and across the land have felt 
that it has gotten harder and harder 
for them to climb the economic ladder. 
The cost of housing and education have 
shot into the stratosphere. Yet wages 
have largely been stuck on the launch 
pad. 
Despite being the best-educated gen-
eration in history, young people work-
ing in America today earn less on aver-
age than their parents did at the same 
age. It ought to be easier to raise a 
family in America. That is why Demo-
crats created the monthly child tax 
credit expansion as part of the Amer-
ican Rescue Plan. 
The new program, as our colleague 
from Ohio, Senator BROWN, has said, is 
Social Security for America’s children. 
Too many kids have been growing up in 
poverty—or very, very close to it. The 
expanded child tax credit is cutting 
child poverty by more than half. But so 
far, it has only been funded for a year. 
With this resolution, Democrats are 
going to lock in the longest extension 
possible. Children and parents need 
help, and they need the certainty and 
predictability of a long-term extension. 
Together with the help of the HELP 
Committee, the Finance Committee is 
also leading the way for a comprehen-
sive national paid leave program. This 
sort of program is long overdue, and 
there will be a special focus on our ef-
forts—the HELP Committee and the 
Finance Committee—on making sure 
that it is equitable so that workers of 
modest incomes can afford to take paid 
leave, too. 
Every family in American needs reli-
able income and a roof over their

August 9, 2021 
heads. Tragically, affordable housing is 
in short supply, and as the pandemic 
proved, it takes just one big economic 
jolt to put millions and millions of 
Americans out of work. 
As part of this resolution, the Fi-
nance Committee is working on finan-
cial support for America’s renters, as 
well as funding for new affordable 
housing. The challenge of affordable 
housing is no longer just an issue for a 
handful of big cities. It is a nationwide 
concern that needs creative big solu-
tions. 
The Finance Committee is also zero-
ing in on worker training and making 
America’s 
unemployment 
insurance 
more reliable and resilient for those in 
America who are laid off through no 
fault of their own. 
Having enough affordable housing, 
job training, and support for those 
workers is an economic win-win—good 
for families, good for businesses who 
rely on the strength of the American 
workforce. 
I am going to turn now to healthcare. 
Democrats have promised to allow 
Medicare to negotiate a fair price with 
Big Pharma. As the chairman of the 
Senate Finance Committee, I intend to 
make good on that promise. Americans 
have been getting clobbered at the 
pharmacy window because Big Pharma 
holds all the power over drug costs. 
With the help of Republicans, Big 
Pharma is now engaged in classic hos-
tage taking. They say, We decide the 
prices you pay or the pipeline for inno-
vation gets shut down. 
That is just not a reasonable propo-
sition. Big Pharma doesn’t need to 
treat Medicare and American tax-
payers like their own private ATM, and 
we don’t need that in order to develop 
the next blockbuster drug. 
We also intend to build on the bipar-
tisan work the Finance Committee has 
already done in the last Congress: 
fighting back against drug company 
price gouging, strengthening the Medi-
care prescription drug benefit, pro-
tecting seniors with an out-of-pocket 
maximum for their medications. Life-
saving medications shouldn’t be send-
ing anybody in America into bank-
ruptcy. 
We are also going to be updating the 
Medicare guarantee for the modern era. 
The Finance Committee has already 
put a lot of work into updating the pro-
gram, particularly to helping seniors 
with chronic conditions. That now 
makes up the bulk of the program— 
cancer, diabetes, heart disease, strokes, 
COPD. We have made a lot of headway 
there. 
The next update is giving seniors ac-
cess to a dental, vision, and hearing 
benefit because those also are crucial 
to the health of America’s elderly. 
Back in the days when I was a co-
director of the Oregon Gray Panthers, 
we said Medicare was just half a loaf. It 
didn’t address those concerns. Now we 
have the opportunity to make sure 
those essential benefits are available 
for seniors. 
Now, President Biden has called for 
major investment in home- and com-
munity-based care. And this is another 
priority for the Senate Finance Com-
mittee. We have been led in this effort 
by our colleague from Pennsylvania, 
Senator CASEY, and I have been pleased 
to assist him with that effort. 
And I believe the distinguished Sen-
ate majority leader has a question that 
he would like to pose. 
ORDER OF BUSINESS 
Mr. SCHUMER. It is not a question. I 
would just ask the Senator to yield for 
30 seconds so I might inform the Mem-
bers. I have been getting questions. 
After we finish on the bipartisan in-
frastructure bill, we will move imme-
diately to proceed to the budget resolu-
tion with reconciliation instructions 
and expect to move to vote-arama 
shortly thereafter. 
I yield the floor. 
H.R. 3684 
Mr. WYDEN. I thank my colleague 
for that timely information. 
Madam President, as I was saying, 
the Better Care Better Jobs Act, led by 
Senator CASEY, really fulfills another 
dream that goes back to those Gray 
Panthers days. We know that Amer-
ica’s most vulnerable would always 
prefer to get quality care at home, 
where they can be with loved ones. And 
yet this country really hasn’t fulfilled 
that dream. Our legislation for seniors 
and for those with disabilities will give 
those individuals a long overdue oppor-
tunity to get good quality care at 
home and raise the work wages for the 
crucial workers who provide this front-
line care. 
In this resolution, Democrats will 
also push to expand on the success of 
the Affordable Care Act. Already this 
year, the Congress expanded middle- 
class tax credits for health insurance 
on a temporary basis. We wish to make 
that permanent. 
Finally, more than a decade after the 
Affordable Care Act became law, there 
are still holdout Governors who have 
chosen to deprive vulnerable people in 
their States of access to Medicaid. Fi-
nance Committee Democrats are lead-
ing the effort to close that coverage 
gap. 
CLIMATE CHANGE 
I want to briefly touch on our work 
on energy and climate. Life for Orego-
nians 
this 
summer—and 
virtually 
every 
summer—has 
become 
about 
record-high temperatures and record-
breaking wildfires. Over one weekend 
last month, temperatures outside my 
house in Southeast Portland were at 
108, 110, and then up to 116. And, unfor-
tunately, I just learned that we are 
headed for another big, severe hit in 
terms of weather starting tomorrow 
and going through Saturday. 
It has gotten so bad that I have been 
spending time on the phone over the 
last few days trying to use a section of 
our CHRONIC Care Act, which allows 
Medicare Advantage plans to cover 
services essential for the elderly that 
didn’t used to be considered healthcare, 
like air conditioners. And we are get-
ting a good response from the plans. 
They know because we are seeing story 
after story—just another one yester-
day—about seniors, often seniors who 
own their own homes but haven’t been 
able to get the air filters and the air 
conditioners and the like. 
That is what we are faced with now 
this week in my home State. That is on 
top of the severe drought. And that 
kind of heat adds fuel to the mega-in-
fernos that we have been seeing. 
Now, the Congress has to act to pre-
vent the worst most catastrophic out-
comes of climate change, and the 
linchpin of the Finance Committee’s 
effort to tackle climate is the Clean 
Energy for America Act. 
The Finance Committee passed this 
earlier this year, and for the Finance 
Committee, this is the most dramatic 
proposal passed from the committee in 
more than 100 years—more than 100 
years. And I am pleased to see cli-
mate’s most vigorous champion on the 
floor here, our friend from Rhode Is-
land. What we did, with the Senator 
from Rhode Island’s help, is we took 
the 44 tax breaks in the Federal Tax 
Code for energy and we put them in the 
dustbin of history—gone, over, lights 
out—and we substituted, instead, one 
for clean energy, one for clean trans-
portation fuel, and one for energy effi-
ciency. 
And then we said for America going 
forward, we will have a tech-neutral 
free-market system for energy tied to 
one very clear measure; and that is, if 
you are a renewable energy program or 
you are a fossil fuel program, if you re-
duce carbon emissions—that one stand-
ard, reducing carbon emissions—you 
are eligible for the tax reductions in 
the Senate Finance Committee’s pro-
posal. 
The proposal also makes electric ve-
hicles more affordable to middle-class 
families and boosts clean energy manu-
facturing in everything from semi-
conductors to solar components. 
An independent analysis of the Fi-
nance Committee’s energy plan said it 
would help create more than 600,000 
jobs, and I just believe it would be a 
catastrophic mistake to pass that up in 
order to protect the status quo. The 
status quo is an outdated system that 
basically cuts special taxpayer-funded 
checks every year to these powerful in-
terests—these oil and gas firms. So we 
are going to talk a lot more about cli-
mate in the days ahead, and I think it 
is very fitting that Senator WHITE-
HOUSE is here. 
I will close by way of saying that the 
proposals that I have just outlined 
would be paid for under what we have 
focused on by restoring fairness to the 
Tax Code. I know there has already 
been some discussion on the floor of 
the Senate about how these proposals 
will be paid for. We will have a lot of 
discussion about it, but it sure takes 
chutzpah for the Members who spent $2 
trillion on the Trump tax handouts to

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S6188 
August 9, 2021 
the megacorporations and wealthy to 
come over to the Senate floor and say 
it is the Democrats who are fiscally ir-
responsible. 
Senate Democrats in the Biden ad-
ministration have been working on a 
number of changes that can help pay 
for the proposals in this resolution. 
That 
includes 
making 
sure 
megacorporations, which are paying 
less today than they have in decades— 
are required to pay a fair share. It in-
cludes legislation to close the carried 
interest loophole for private equity ex-
ecutives and legislation to close other 
loopholes abused by wealthy investors. 
And Democrats made a promise that 
nobody who earns less than $400,000 per 
year pay more in taxes, and we are 
going to stand by that. In fact, the ex-
panded child tax credit is the largest 
tax cut for working-class and middle- 
class families in decades. And we have 
proposed as well to cut taxes for Main 
Street small businesses from one end of 
the country to another. 
Now, the Republican position has 
been something else. Their position is 
that megacorporations and those at 
the very, very, very top of the eco-
nomic system, basically, shouldn’t pay 
one penny in taxes. That is unfair. It is 
wrong. And the American people know 
it. 
We are going to have a lively debate 
on the resolution, and I am pleased to 
be able to stand up with colleagues to 
make the push, to make the fight for 
making it easier to support a middle- 
class family, lowering the cost of 
healthcare, addressing the climate cri-
sis, and building a stronger, more fair 
economy. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Rhode Island. 
Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Madam Presi-
dent, I am delighted to follow my dis-
tinguished chairman on the Finance 
Committee as he gives assurances 
about our important work on climate 
change. 
The majority leader has announced 
that the final vote on the bipartisan in-
frastructure package will be tomorrow 
at 11 a.m., and we will then roll into 
the rather ignominious spectacle of the 
Senate known as vote-arama. What 
vote-arama does, however, it allows us 
to go to budget reconciliation, which 
allows us to pass measures with a sim-
ple majority. 
We should do that bearing in mind 
what just came out—the latest IPCC 
report on climate change. It is getting 
increasingly dire. The IPCC report uses 
words like ‘‘unequivocal,’’ ‘‘unprece-
dented,’’ ‘‘irreversible.’’ 
Unequivocal is the link between fos-
sil fuel pollution and the climate dam-
age we are doing to our oceans and at-
mosphere—unequivocal. 
Unprecedented. We talk about un-
precedented around here if it hasn’t 
happened in a decade. They talk about 
unprecedented across many centuries 
or many thousands of years. We are 
undoing the basic operating systems of 
our planet as humankind has come to 
know them. 
Irreversible means, for some of this, 
there is no going back. We were warned 
and warned and warned. We ignored it 
and ignored it and ignored it, and now 
we are in it. We can make it less bad, 
but parts are irreversible. As one 
United Nations spokesman said, this is 
red alert for humanity. 
It doesn’t take the IPCC or the U.N. 
or the universities in our home States 
or our environmental community to 
tell us this. All we have to do is look 
around. Look at the wildfires that are 
tearing through the West. Senator 
PADILLA was here earlier today talking 
about what is going on in California. 
Here is a report from California, from 
the head of the Plumas National For-
est, its supervisor: 
We are seeing truly frightening fire behav-
ior, I don’t know how to overstate that. We 
have a lot of veteran firefighters who have 
served for 20, 30 years and have never seen 
behavior like this, especially day after day, 
and the conditions we’re in. So we really are 
in unchartered territory around some of 
these extreme, large fires and the behavior 
we’re seeing. 
That is the report from the front of 
the wildfires. But we are not just in un-
chartered territory with wildfires; we 
are in unchartered territory with re-
spect to flooding. Here is what we are 
predicting in Rhode Island. Right now, 
this is the northern part of my State. 
Everything you see here that is a 
bright-blue color, that is land right 
now. People live there. People have 
businesses there. People have recre-
ation there. There are things that peo-
ple do that are part of their lives there, 
and it all disappears under current pre-
dictions of sea level rise. It disappears. 
This is a place called Warwick Neck. 
It becomes Warwick Neck Island. This 
is a place called Poppasquash Point. It 
becomes two little islands off of Bris-
tol, and Bristol becomes its own island. 
Barrington gains sort of the Bar-
rington Great Salt Lake in the middle 
of it, and now you have an island along 
what is now Barrington’s southern 
coast. We stop being Rhode Island, and 
we become the Rhode Island Archi-
pelago. That is a big change, and if I 
can stop it, I am going to. 
Drought. You have seen the pictures 
of the western lakes at alltime lows, 
and the dependence of those Western 
States on water is acute. The hurricane 
cycle we are already in has warnings 
about how serious the coming hurri-
cane season is going to be. 
If you step down to God’s creatures, 
you have manatees that are dying in 
unprecedented numbers in Florida. Off 
the northwest coast, in the Pacific 
Ocean, you have the humble tetrapod, 
a tiny, small oceanic snail that just 
happens to be a big part of the bottom 
of the ocean food chain. Half of the 
tetrapods sampled have severe shell 
damage because of ocean acidification, 
which is happening because the ocean 
absorbs carbon dioxide, and it turns 
acidic when it happens. I have proven 
that little experiment from this desk 
early in the morning once. 
Our Atlantic fisheries are all in flux, 
all moving. Our Connecticut and Rhode 
Island and southern Massachusetts lob-
ster fisheries pretty much collapsed. 
Species that farmers didn’t used to see 
are now turning up in our waters. 
There were these horrible stories 
about the heat that Chairman WYDEN 
spoke about. Small birds get so dis-
oriented in the heat as fledglings that 
they jump out of their nests to get 
away and then, of course, become prey 
and incapable of getting back to their 
nests on the ground. And birds gen-
erally and insect populations generally 
are crashing. 
We think about this very often in 
terms of looking back at what we have 
been through, and we are told over and 
over again and we know from our own 
experience that this past year has been 
the worst in the last 10 years or the 
last 20 years across all of these meas-
ures. But I want you to think about 
this. Yes, it has been the worst year in 
the last 10 or 20 years, but here is what 
else we know and here is what the 
IPCC report warns us: It is the best 
year of the next 10 or 20. This is getting 
worse, period—end of story. We can 
slow down it getting worse, and we can 
slowly turn it around, but the disasters 
we are seeing now are child’s play com-
pared to what is coming. 
So action is now necessary, and 
thankfully, our timing is such that we 
have a reconciliation measure starting 
tomorrow that gives us the tools to 
take action. We have to do this now, 
and unfortunately, we have to do this 
alone. 
There are three sad facts about our 
predicament. One is, we can’t count on 
Republicans. If we lose the House next 
year, as people are predicting, to gerry-
mandered States, we are done getting 
serious about climate because we know 
perfectly well that since the Citizens 
United decision, no Republican has got-
ten on a serious climate bill in the Sen-
ate—not one. It used to be bipartisan. 
John McCain ran for President on a 
climate plan that was very good. There 
were three or four different serious cli-
mate bills kicking around before Citi-
zens United. But then Citizens United 
came. Unlimited money came. The fos-
sil fuel industry used unlimited money, 
and they shut down the Republican 
Party on climate. 
They said: We are tolerating no dis-
sent any longer. You are all going to 
line up and do as you are told. If you 
don’t do what you are told, we will do 
what we did to Bob Inglis—take him 
out in a primary. And if you do as you 
are told, we will send boatloads of dark 
money to throw into elections through 
super PACs. 
You have a party that is hip deep in 
fossil fuel money and has a decade—a 
lost decade—in which it would do noth-
ing serious about climate. So, unfortu-
nately, and to the great sorrow of my 
friend John Warner, who passed away 
recently, and John McCain and others 
who worked hard before this when the 
Republican Party was less dependent

August 9, 2021 
on fossil fuel money, unfortunately, we 
have to do it alone. 
We can’t count on the fossil fuel in-
dustry to mend its ways. They have 
been at a decade of lying. They built 
this, an entire web of phony-baloney 
front groups all paid for with fossil fuel 
money—in the hundreds of millions, 
billions of dollars—to put out fake 
science, to hide who they are behind 
the dark money, behind these front 
groups. They ran an enormous corrupt 
scheme to fool Americans and block 
progress here in this building so that 
they could keep polluting. And now we 
are supposed to count on them? No 
way. 
They still haven’t come clean about 
their years of funding denial, and they 
won’t come clean. Guess why. Because 
they are still at it. Their CEOs will say 
one thing at a press conference, but 
this machine of disinformation and ob-
struction—this machine is still funded, 
and it is still rolling. So you can’t 
count on the fossil fuel industry to 
change its ways. 
Third, unfortunately—and I really 
hate to say this—you can’t count on 
corporate America. They are full of 
great statements. CEOs go to the busi-
ness roundtables, and they go to the 
Climate Leadership Council, and they 
go to C2ES. They join series and talk 
about their support for climate and 
how it is urgent and how they support 
carbon pricing. But when it comes to 
the levers of power here in this build-
ing, forget about it. They have built 
the most powerful lobbying and elec-
tioneering apparatus in our country’s 
history. Trade association after trade 
association, business group after busi-
ness group—not one has been switched 
on to do anything about climate. 
By the way, when it is a CEO giving 
a press conference in New York, but 
that trade association is saying noth-
ing or ‘‘Don’t do it,’’ guess who people 
listen to here in Washington. They lis-
ten to that trade association. They 
know what greenwashing is, and they 
know when corporate America is seri-
ous. At this moment, no major trade 
association is taking any interest in 
climate action. 
The chamber of commerce—nothing. 
They are embroiled in a long conversa-
tion with members of theirs who are 
fed up with their climate denial, but 
they have done nothing. 
The National Association of Manu-
facturers—also nothing. They were re-
cently 
the 
two 
worst 
climate 
obstructers in America. Have they 
changed their direction? No. Now they 
are just climate obstruction light, cli-
mate obstruction 2.0. 
Look at API, the American Petro-
leum Institute. This one is pretty 
funny. They come out and they say 
they support carbon pricing. They are 
going to support putting a cost on pol-
lution, on greenhouse gas. And then we 
come out of the Budget Committee and 
we announce, as Leader SCHUMER did, 
that we are going to actually price 
methane, another greenhouse gas—an 
even more potent greenhouse gas and 
actually kind of a dangerous one—so, 
uh-oh, suddenly it looks real. Some-
body might actually price methane. 
And what did API to? Came out against 
it. 
Now, you tell me how you can be for 
pricing a milder greenhouse gas in 
order to help address climate change 
but against pricing an even more toxic 
chemical to help solve climate change. 
It makes no sense. The only way you 
can reconcile those two things is with 
the statement of the Exxon lobbyists 
that the only reason the industry is 
talking about carbon pricing is because 
it doesn’t think it is going to happen. 
It is another fake. It is another 
scheme. It is another denial and ob-
struction—in this case, probably 5.0. 
The American Bankers Association. 
You read from central banks around 
the country warnings about the eco-
nomic crash that is going to happen if 
we don’t get ahead of the climate prob-
lem. Those are the central banks’ 
warnings, but what did the American 
Bankers Association have to say to us? 
Nothing. 
Insurance companies are screaming 
about the risks that they are facing 
now from worse hurricanes, worse 
flooding, 
worse 
droughts, 
worse 
wildfires; claims going up, difficulty 
anticipating what risks are, and hard- 
to-price insurance. Yet where is the 
American Insurance Association? Si-
lent. 
Freddie Mac has warned us that 
there is going to be a coastal property 
values crash as those sea levels rise 
and, as you can predict, that that home 
is going to be literally under water in 
the 30-year mortgage period, not just 
figuratively under water—so no mort-
gage, no insurance, no market; hence, 
our property values crash. 
And where is the Realtors Associa-
tion? Where are the American Home 
Builders? Silent. 
The American Beverage Association. 
Oh, Coke and Pepsi talk a really big 
game. What is the American Beverage 
Association doing on this? Nothing. 
And all those big barons out in Sil-
icon Valley are represented by a group 
called TechNet. A year ago, they didn’t 
even mention climate change in their 
lobbying materials. They didn’t even 
mention clean or renewable energy, 
and they have clean and renewable en-
ergy companies in their membership. 
So we cannot count on corporate 
America to take climate change seri-
ously here, where a solution is needed. 
So this is on us. 
And I will tell you, we intend to—I 
intend to—meet the moment. And 
there are those out there who will 
grouse and complain. And to you, I say: 
Too damned bad. You have had years 
to help, and you did nothing or worse. 
So you have lost your right to com-
plain. 
But under pressure of the facts and 
the realities of what is going on around 
us, under pressure of the warnings 
about this being irreversible, unequivo-
cal, and unprecedented, we are going to 
act. We are going to act. 
And I don’t want to hear your com-
plaining because you had a decade to 
come in and try to do something about 
this and you shirked your responsibil-
ities for a decade, you funded trade as-
sociations that were doing nothing, 
you funded these creepy front groups 
that were attacking us on climate 
change. So you lost your right to com-
plain. 
And in the next 6 or 7 or 8 weeks, as 
we go through building this reconcili-
ation instruction, we aren’t just going 
to address climate change, we are not 
just going to do more than has ever 
been done before; we are going to get 
on a safe pathway for this country and 
for the planet. 
Because I will tell you, ‘‘more than 
we have ever done before on climate’’ is 
a pathetically low bar because, for a 
decade, thanks to the fossil fuel indus-
try and its web of denial and its con-
trol over the Republican Party, we 
have done nothing on climate. 
So we have got a lot of catching up 
to do. Reconciliation gives us the 
chance to do it. I pray to God that we 
meet the moment. 
I yield the floor.
