50TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE 
PASSAGE OF TITLE IX 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
North Carolina (Ms. FOXX) for 5 min-
utes. 
Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, today is the 
50th anniversary of the passage of Title 
IX, 
legislation 
that 
revolutionized 
women’s sports and women’s access to 
education. 
Since the Education Amendments of 
1972 passed, women’s participation in 
sports has skyrocketed. Mr. Speaker, 
50 years ago, only 1 out of every 27 
women participated in college-level 
sports. Today, that number is one in 
five. 
Title IX granted women equal access 
to educational opportunities, including 
college admissions and teaching posi-
tions at postsecondary institutions. 
Because of this, more women are going 
to college today than ever before. 
While this monumental legislation 
has strengthened our country and our 
workforce beyond belief, it is under 
threat today. Expanding this legisla-
tion to include other designations like 
sexual orientation and gender identity 
goes beyond the intent of Congress. 
It also dilutes protections for women, 
and in some cases, threatens their safe-
ty. 
We already knew Democrats were 
willing to weaponize Title IX when 
they used it to deny due process to stu-
dents accused of sexual assault on col-
lege campuses. 
The rights of due process should not 
end simply because someone is a stu-
dent, but, thankfully, the Trump ad-
ministration set things right on this 
front. 
Now, 
new 
threats 
are 
emerging. 
While the advancements made under 
Title IX have been numerous, the 
Biden administration is attempting to 
use this legislation to further a pro-
gressive social agenda. 
For example, the Biden administra-
tion is threatening to hold school 
lunches hostage if K–12 schools do not 
agree to a slew of controversial gender- 
neutral policies. 
One of these policies will likely be 
forcing schools to allow biological 
males to compete in girls’ sports, 
something already happening at many 
schools across the country. 
The results are in: It erases women. 
Let me say that again: It erases 
women. 
Ignoring the biological differences 
between the male and female body is a 
catastrophe for women, especially in 
sports. It destroys a level playing field 
and makes women second-class citizens 
in their own sports. 
Even the international stage has 
begun to take notice as the Inter-
national Swimming Federation voted 
to restrict many transgender women 
from competing in international swim-
ming competitions. We have already 
seen women’s records in swimming and 
track obliterated by biological males. 
Athletes give their all to be the best 
they can be. It is cruel to take the 
chance of success away from women, 
especially when it could mean losing 
out on a college scholarship or other 
important opportunities. 
Perhaps even more concerning is the 
threat these policies pose to women’s 
safety. It is completely irresponsible to 
take away a woman’s right to privacy 
and security by mandating gender-neu-
tral spaces. 
Allowing biological males, even if 
they identify as a woman, into wom-
en’s locker rooms, bathrooms, jails, 
and domestic violence shelters poses a 
threat to the safety of women. 
I shouldn’t have to spell this out for 
you. It is common sense. Today should 
be a day of celebration, one where we 
marvel at the gains women have made 
in sports and in education, but the 
Biden administration’s actions have 
certainly put a damper on this momen-
tous anniversary. 
It is time for Democrats to regain 
their senses, and, once again, commit 
to protecting—protecting—the integ-
rity of women’s sports and the safety 
of women. This political agenda is de-
structive and unbecoming of a country 
dedicated to equal opportunity for all.

SLASHING THE FEDERAL DEFICIT

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5826 
June 23, 2022 
Biden’s massive accomplishment of 
slashing the Federal deficit by more 
than any other President in the first 16 
months. 
Mr. Speaker, this is huge. But even 
better news: Biden is on track to dou-
ble down on building a better America 
for generations to come. 
This year’s deficit is on track to fall 
by $1.7 trillion which is the single larg-
est 1-year reduction in American his-
tory. I repeat: This is the single largest 
reduction in American history. 
In contrast, the Trump administra-
tion increased the Federal budget def-
icit. Every single year in office, it went 
up. 
I can’t say I am surprised, however. 
This accomplishment of the President 
is not coincidence. It is the result of a 
well-designed and well-managed recov-
ery plan from the pandemic. 
It is a result of President Biden and 
Congress passing key legislation like 
the historical American Rescue Plan 
which got people back to work, kids 
back in school, and families healthy 
again. 
It is the result of a President who 
puts people first—not politics, people. 
But on another note, it is no secret 
that the recent price hikes that have 
been caused by the war criminal Putin 
are burdening hardworking families. In 
fact, Putin’s price hike has increased 
gas prices by $2 a gallon in many places 
since Russian troops began to threaten 
Ukraine, and families are seeing higher 
prices in the grocery aisles, too. 
Sadly, Putin is increasing inflation, 
not only here in America, but also 
throughout the globe. House Demo-
crats and President Biden won’t stand 
for this. My colleagues and I are work-
ing side by side with the President to 
lower costs for working people at the 
gas pump, at the grocery store, and 
across the shelves. 
That is why House Democrats passed 
critical bills like the Lowering Food 
and Fuel Costs Act, Ocean Shipping 
Reform Act, and the Consumer Fuel 
Price Gouging Prevention Act. 
These key bills will strengthen our 
supply chains, create more maritime 
jobs in communities like my home dis-
trict, and lower both gas and goods 
prices. 
Just yesterday, Mr. Speaker, the 
President announced that he is in favor 
of taking a pause of 3 months on the 
Federal gas tax. He has challenged 
Congress to pass that, to put a pause 
on the Federal gasoline tax for 3 
months. 
Now, our tax is 18 cents. That would 
be 18 cents per gallon every time some-
one fills up. He challenged all of the 
Governors to do the same. 
Some Governors, like the Governors 
of Florida and Georgia and others, have 
already done this. In my State of 
Texas, that means an additional sav-
ings of 20 cents. Added together, that 
would be 38 cents a gallon. 
That is huge. That is a huge savings 
in cutting prices down. For an average 
tank of 15 gallons, that would be a sav-
ings of $5.70 every time they fill up. 
So I hope that our Governor does like 
Florida and Georgia and rises to the 
challenge that the President has made 
yesterday and puts a pause on Texas’ 
gasoline tax. 
House Democrats are taking strong 
steps. We are joining hands with the 
President to make sure that we lower 
rising prices caused by Putin’s cruel 
war in Ukraine. I call on all my Repub-
lican colleagues across the aisle to join 
us. 
Most Republicans voted against all 
those bills that I just mentioned. It is 
time to act. Enough is enough. I urge 
them to fight with us for hardworking 
American families. Together, we can 
build a better America for today and 
for generations to come.

HONORING THE LEGACY OF 
COTTON ROSSER 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
California (Mr. LAMALFA) for 5 min-
utes. 
Mr. LAMALFA. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today with deep, deep regret and sad-
ness over the loss of a local legend, 
Cotton Rosser, who was 93 years old. 
Known as a top rodeo man all over 
the north State and even all over the 
country, he is known for winning so 
many awards and accolades in his job 
as a rodeo man. 
He used to open for the National 
Finals Rodeo in Las Vegas at least 10 
years in a row. He had the Flying U 
Company, a rodeo company that trav-
eled all over the Western States, bring-
ing his show. 
He was always, always improving the 
show, making it into something spec-
tacular. He would bring ideas from ice 
skating and others to make the show 
even more spectacular. He was innova-
tive in that. 
He was recognized in 2019 as a Legend 
of ProRodeo, 1995 ProRodeo Hall of 
Fame inductee, 1985 PRCA Stock Con-
tractor of the Year, over 60 years doing 
shows, and over 70 years in rodeo. 
He was truly a good man, a nice man, 
and his family is his legacy, the good 
people they are, that he leaves behind. 
The legacy with the Red Bluff Round- 
Up and taking stock up there and 
Colusa Western Days, I have partici-
pated in all these things as an ob-
server, the Marysville Stampede. It has 
just been such a rich part of northern 
California and the West and, indeed, 
the whole country. 
I will leave you with a quote from 
him. You know, he was 93, so in recent 
years, having had to retire somewhat, 
he said, ‘‘I am just the PR man now. I 
never imagined my rodeo career would 
be like this. I am the richest guy in the 
world with memories and friends. I 
loved every minute of the rodeo busi-
ness, and I would do it all over again.’’ 
Such a great memory, indeed. 
A good friend of mine; hard to deal 
with. We are very proud of Cotton 
Rosser in northern California. 
SECURITY FOR OUR SUPREME COURT JUSTICES 
Mr. Speaker, any day now, the Su-
preme Court is expected to make an of-
ficial announcement on their decision 
in the Dobbs v. Jackson case. 
Ever since the draft opinion was 
leaked, radical leftists have tried to in-
timidate, threaten, and harass the con-
servative Justices on the Court. 
There have been multiple attacks 
against pro-life and pregnancy centers 
across the whole country. A deranged 
individual was caught plotting to as-
sassinate Justice Brett Kavanaugh and 
his family at their home. 
He was caught carrying a handgun, 
two clips of ammunition, a tactical 
knife, pepper spray, a crowbar, a nail 
punch, duct tape, a hammer, and a 
screwdriver outside their home. 
The White House refused to condemn 
this heinous crime. The pro-abortion 
group, Ruth Sent Us, publicly threat-
ened Justice Amy Coney Barrett’s chil-
dren, as well. They tweeted the exact 
location of the children’s school and 
church, along with the schedules of 
when they would be there. These radi-
cals are jeopardizing the lives of our 
Justices’ families. 
It took a month for congressional 
Democrats and Senate Leader SCHUMER 
to bring the Supreme Court Police Par-
ity Act to the floor for a vote. This bill 
offers security to family members of 
the Supreme Court Justices, which is 
more critical than ever. 
While 
unnecessarily 
delaying 
the 
bill, Speaker PELOSI even had the au-
dacity to claim, ‘‘Nobody is in danger 
over the weekend because of our not 
having a bill.’’ There was an assassina-
tion plot. Of course, people were, in 
fact, in danger. 
Despite the slew of threats, I pray 
that the Court does the right thing for 
our Nation’s unborn and upholds our 
Constitution. 
Overturning Roe does not ban abor-
tion but rightly returns the abortion 
debate back to Congress and to the 
State legislatures. In our Republic, 
those elected by the people should be 
the ones to create laws and balance 
tradeoffs, not judges. 
In the nearly 50 years since Roe be-
came the law of the land, over 63 mil-
lion unborn children have been killed 
due to judicial activism. 
Life begins at the moment of concep-
tion, and an overwhelming number of 
Americans believe in protecting babies 
still in the womb. In order to preserve 
our judicial system, we cannot allow 
these intimidation tactics to win the 
day. The Court must be allowed to do 
its job unfettered while not actively 
legislating from the bench.

CELEBRATING 50 YEARS OF PELL 
GRANTS 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Pennsylvania (Mr. EVANS) for 5 min-
utes. 
Mr. EVANS. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to mark the 50th anniversary of 
the Pell Grant Program.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5827 
June 23, 2022 
In 1972, Congress amended the Higher 
Education Act by creating the Basic 
Educational Opportunity Grant to pro-
vide direct financial aid to low-income 
students so they could have the same 
access to higher education and oppor-
tunity for success as their higher in-
come peers. 
The program was later named the 
Pell grant for its original sponsor, Sen-
ator Pell, Democrat from Rhode Island. 
The original bill was signed into law by 
Republican President Richard Nixon, 
and the program has maintained this 
original bipartisan support over the 
last 50 years. 
To date, more than 80 million stu-
dents have received a Pell grant to go 
to college since the program was cre-
ated. Currently, nearly 7 million stu-
dents are going to college with a Pell 
grant, or about 40 percent of under-
graduate students. In my district in 
the great city of Philadelphia, nearly 
22,000 students receive $90.5 million to 
pursue their higher education goals. 
The 
Federal 
investment 
in 
Pell 
grants is targeted to students with 
demonstrated financial need, students 
whose families have incomes of $40,000 
or less. The investment pays off by in-
creasing college completion and eco-
nomic mobility. 
On the 50-year anniversary of the 
Pell Grant Program, I encourage the 
United States to celebrate national 
Pell grant day by recognizing the cur-
rent students and successful graduates 
who have benefited from the program 
by telling their student success stories 
and encouraging the same access for 
future students, demonstrating the im-
portance of what the Pell grant has 
meant. 
The Pell grant is significant to the 
future of this country, and it is impor-
tant that we all stand up for this pro-
gram that has been valuable to our 
young people for the future, no matter 
what side of the aisle we are on. 
f 
THE PERILS OF EXPERTS 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
California (Mr. MCCLINTOCK) for 5 min-
utes. 
Mr. MCCLINTOCK. Mr. Speaker, we 
all know the tale of ‘‘The Emperor’s 
New Clothes.’’ Grifters convince an em-
peror that they are expert tailors who 
weave a cloth so fine that only the vir-
tuous can see it. The emperor wraps 
himself in nothing and parades the 
streets as all the townspeople compete 
to signal their own virtue by pro-
claiming how beautiful the material is, 
even though their own common sense 
tells them otherwise. This scheme is 
successful until a little boy who knows 
better states the obvious. 
For 2 years now, we were told by the 
experts that they could stop COVID–19 
if everyone did exactly as they com-
manded. I am science, as one put it. 
They quashed debate within the med-
ical 
community 
and 
ridiculed, 
censored, and fired any dissenters. 
Looking back, we can clearly see 
what a self-destructive folly they pro-
duced. Study after study now confirms 
the obvious, that the mask mandate, 
school closures, home detention orders, 
and business closures had virtually no 
impact on the virus. But they did ap-
palling damage to the economy, seri-
ously harmed children in ways we are 
still cataloging, and cost untold lives 
due to suicides, drug and alcohol 
overdoses, delayed health screenings 
and treatments, and poverty-related 
deaths. 
This recent, tragic experience should 
warn us all to be much more skeptical 
of surrendering common sense to so- 
called experts and of suppressing free 
debate over what science actually is 
telling us, which brings us to the 
Democrats’ ongoing and escalating war 
on fossil fuels. 
The road they have placed us on 
leads to a bleak future of unaffordable 
energy, 
rolling 
blackouts, 
empty 
shelves, and increasingly brutal ration-
ing of every watt of electricity and 
drop of gasoline that we once took for 
granted. 
Gasoline prices are already the high-
est ever seen in this country as we 
have 
discouraged 
production. 
Elec-
tricity prices are skyrocketing, pushed 
by the crushing cost of renewables. 
Utilities across the county are now 
warning of summer blackouts because 
renewable mandates have destabilized 
the electricity grid. 
Joe Biden and the Democrats prom-
ised to wage war on fossil fuels, and 
they have succeeded. On his first day in 
office, he canceled the Keystone pipe-
line, which today should have been 
completed and delivering 830,000 barrels 
of crude oil every day into American 
markets. He canceled oil and gas explo-
ration on Federal lands. Just last 
month, he withdrew 1 million acres of 
land from exploration and production 
in oil-rich Alaska and the Gulf of Mex-
ico. 
And 
he 
blames 
Vladimir 
Putin? 
Under the progrowth policies of the 
Trump administration, America didn’t 
need Putin’s oil. We were energy inde-
pendent for the first time in our life-
times. We were producing more oil 
than Russia and even Saudi Arabia. 
The day the Democrats took office, 
gasoline was averaging $2.39 a gallon. 
Today’s sky-high fuel prices are ag-
gravating supply chain breakdowns and 
adding to consumer prices. Acreage 
once devoted to growing corn for food 
is now used to produce ethanol, which 
requires trading an entire acre of corn 
to produce just 550 gallons of ethanol. 
The irony is, at a time when these 
Green New Deal policies can’t guar-
antee enough electricity to keep the 
lights on this summer at any price, 
these Democrat elitists are telling 
families to buy electric cars. Where do 
they think the electricity for their 
electric cars comes from? Eighty per-
cent comes from fossil fuels that they 
are ruthlessly shutting down. 
The excuse for all of this, of course, 
is to stop global warming, but they 
cannot account for why it is that there 
have been periods throughout paleo 
history when temperatures have been 
much higher and also much lower than 
they are today. Nor do they account for 
the infinitely more powerful natural 
forces 
that 
shape 
our 
constantly 
changing climate. 
The blind reliance on handpicked ex-
perts and the suppression of dissent in 
our approach to COVID cost lives and 
destroyed the most prosperous eco-
nomic expansion in our lifetimes. But 
its excesses pale in comparison to what 
the green left is now doing to our soci-
ety. The pain and damage we are feel-
ing today is just the first bitter taste 
of what is to come if they prevail. 
Of one thing we can be certain: 
Whether or not we destroy our Nation’s 
prosperity by continuing the Demo-
crats’ war on fossil fuels, the Earth 
will continue to warm and cool, as it 
has for billions of years. The only ques-
tion we can answer is whether ours will 
be a future of abundance or scarcity, 
prosperity or poverty, comfort or mis-
ery.

FAREWELL TO JULIE NICKSON 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
California (Ms. LEE) for 5 minutes. 
Ms. LEE of California. Mr. Speaker, I 
rise today to acknowledge my chief of 
staff, Julie Little Nickson, who, after 
22 years of service in the House and 20 
years in my office, will soon be depart-
ing the Hill. 
Let me take a moment to acknowl-
edge Congresswoman MARCY KAPTUR, 
who Julie worked for prior to coming 
to my office and for her gracious help 
with Julie’s transition to my office. 
Julie joined my staff in 2002 and 
quickly 
distinguished 
herself 
as 
a 
skilled manager and leader of Team 
Lee. She undoubtedly got to know 
many district constituents and hit the 
ground running. 
Her keen understanding of the inter-
section of policy, politics, and proce-
dure has helped drive so many accom-
plishments through the decades. She 
has also ensured that my constituents 
understand the relationship between 
our work in Washington, D.C., and 
their daily lives. 
From her work advancing my efforts 
as coauthor of the President’s Emer-
gency Plan for AIDS Relief, PEPFAR, 
back in 2003 to the development and en-
actment 
of 
the 
historic 
American 
Women Quarters act in 2020, Julie has 
been the strategic guiding force propel-
ling my agenda. She makes sure that 
the inclusion of staff is prominent in 
everything I do and that staff is recog-
nized and is central to her work. 
She has been the key and steady 
leader of my work to prevent the wars 
in Iraq and Afghanistan. Of course, 
that work grew and expanded to in-
clude numerous efforts to end our for-
ever wars and rein in unchecked execu-
tive war powers, including my work to 
repeal the 2001 and 2002 AUMFs.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5828 
June 23, 2022 
As my chief of staff during my time 
as both the chair of the CPC and later 
when I chaired the Congressional Black 
Caucus in 2009 and 2010, Julie helped 
build coalitions and advanced our pol-
icy and communications agenda for-
ward. This was really not an easy task, 
but as always, she rose to the occasion. 
Her two decades of appropriations ex-
perience has helped me deliver signifi-
cant resources to my congressional dis-
trict over the years, including from 
major 
infrastructure 
and 
transit 
projects, 
critical 
research 
and 
healthcare 
funding, 
and 
so 
many 
projects that have helped improve the 
lives of my constituents. 
Her knowledge of both domestic and 
international Federal spending pro-
grams and policies has helped me 
champion and support the growth of 
vital human needs programs along with 
domestic and international health and 
development. 
As a manager, Julie has always led 
by example with her deep commitment 
and mission-driven approach to the 
work. She has helped and led, shaped, 
and developed numerous staff, interns, 
and many fellows over the years, and 
they have soared in their professions 
and what they do after they leave my 
office. 
In a very determined yet congenial 
way, she has made sure my district 
staff and D.C. staff work together as 
one seamless staff, reflecting the val-
ues and commitment to public service 
and constituent casework as Team Lee. 
I have had the privilege to know 
Julie through many phases of her life. 
When she came to my office, she was 
single with no children. She got mar-
ried to a wonderful man, Mike Nickson. 
Later, when she became pregnant, we 
were really all happy for her and Mike 
but wondered when she would stop 
working. She worked until the last 
minute, and we all were delighted that 
she had a beautiful daughter, Cate, who 
will turn 16 next month. 
Cate has become a progressive, free- 
spirited young lady. Of course, Cate 
spent many years in my office through 
the years and developed a keen sense of 
social justice through watching and lis-
tening to her mother as she executed 
our agenda for the people. 
As the daughter of Sandra and Harell 
Little, who instilled such a strong com-
mitment to public service, Julie has 
been a caring and loving daughter and 
has always demonstrated an amazing 
work-life balance. I thank her parents 
for raising such a brilliant and pas-
sionate daughter. 
As Julie enters her next phase of life, 
she will now work directly to save lives 
as a representative of the American 
Cancer Society Cancer Action Net-
work. She has always been about life- 
affirming efforts, and no doubt she will 
continue with her life’s mission as she 
has answered God’s call for this next 
chapter of her life. 
We wish her good luck. We wish her 
God’s blessings. 
And just a reminder, Julie, that once 
a member of Team Lee, always a mem-
ber of Team Lee.

CORRECTING AN EGREGIOUS 
MISTAKE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Tennessee (Mr. ROSE) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. ROSE. Mr. Speaker, almost 50 
years ago, the Supreme Court incor-
rectly decided that the right to end an 
unborn child’s life existed in the U.S. 
Constitution. On that day, the United 
States became one of only six countries 
that 
allow 
abortion 
on 
demand 
throughout the entirety of pregnancy, 
putting us in the same category as 
Communist China and North Korea. 
Now, almost 50 years later, we might 
be on the precipice of the Court cor-
recting their egregious mistake. Unfor-
tunately, due to the actions of a rogue 
actor with no regard for the laws or in-
stitutions of our country, Justices 
must withstand attempts to dissuade 
them from changing that ruling. Inex-
cusably, those attempts to intimidate 
the High Court’s opinion have even 
turned violent. 
In fact, since that rogue actor, who I 
believe broke the law and should be 
held accountable to the full extent of 
the law, leaked Justice Alito’s draft 
opinion on Dobbs v. Jackson, a fence 
had to be constructed outside the 
Court to prevent attempts from left-
wing agitators to ‘‘burn it down.’’ 
There was also a reported attempt to 
assassinate Justice Kavanaugh, which 
was thankfully foiled by our brave law 
enforcement officers. 
As we are all surely aware, anti-life 
demonstrators have held protests for 
weeks outside the homes of Justice 
Clarence Thomas, Amy Coney Barrett, 
and Brett Kavanaugh, which is a direct 
violation of 18 U.S.C. 1507. 
Instead of breaking up these illegal 
demonstrations and putting an end to 
the intimidation and mob rule so prev-
alent on the left these days, President 
Biden’s Justice Department has al-
lowed them to proceed unabated. 
This, in my mind, sounds like an en-
dorsement of lawlessness or at least a 
two-tiered justice system. This admin-
istration doesn’t seem interested in en-
forcing laws that aren’t politically ex-
pedient, whether it is at the southern 
border or elsewhere. 
Mr. Speaker, it is no secret that I am 
100 percent pro-life. I signed an amicus 
brief in support of overturning Roe v. 
Wade, and I remain hopeful that the 
Supreme Court will, indeed, finally 
overturn it. The number of lives lost 
since Roe v. Wade was wrongly decided 
is truly unfathomable. Countless lives 
have been lost that will never be grant-
ed the privilege to walk on God’s Earth 
with those listening to this speech 
today. 
For years, we have prayed. Finally, 
those prayers may potentially be an-
swered. 
b 1030 
If so, that does not mean our work is 
done. While the power to legislate with 
regard to abortion policy will be re-
turned to the legislative bodies where 
our Founders intended such power to 
reside, much work remains at every 
level of government—State, local, and 
Federal—to ensure Progressives don’t 
pass legislation that provides for tax-
payer-funded 
abortions, 
something 
that polls show 58 percent of Ameri-
cans do not support. 
I promise to work day in and day out 
to ensure that every child is guaran-
teed the same right to life we all enjoy 
today. I will be a voice for the voiceless 
throughout the remaining time I have 
in Congress and even well after, much 
like my time before I arrived here in 
Washington. Because after all, if there 
is no life, there is no liberty or pursuit 
of happiness.

WE MUST REPEAL THE WEP AND 
GPO 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
California (Mr. RUIZ) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. RUIZ. Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
on behalf of older Americans in my dis-
trict to call for the repeal of the wind-
fall elimination provision and the gov-
ernment pension offset. 
For far too long, the WEP and GPO 
provisions have wrongfully penalized 
our Nation’s public servants who have 
paid into Social Security by working 
second or even third jobs. That means 
that public servants in my district, 
like Fran, a retired schoolteacher from 
San Jacinto, are seeing their Social Se-
curity cut because of bureaucratic red 
tape. She wrote to me and told me that 
her Social Security benefits have been 
reduced by $500 per month. Fran de-
serves better. 
Our Nation’s retired teachers, police 
officers, and firefighters deserve better, 
too. After a lifetime of hard work and 
paying into Social Security, there is no 
justification for them to miss out on 
their earned income in their golden 
years. We have an obligation, a respon-
sibility, to take care of them and en-
sure they receive the benefits that they 
have earned through years of hard 
work. 
We must pass the Social Security 
2100 Act to finally eliminate the WEP 
and GPO provisions, strengthen Social 
Security, and give our Nation’s seniors 
a much-needed increase in benefits. 
This repeal is long overdue. Our seniors 
cannot afford to wait any longer for 
the fairness, relief, and peace of mind 
that they deserve. 
IN SUPPORT OF THE FARM WORKFORCE 
MODERNIZATION ACT 
Mr. RUIZ. Mr. Speaker, as chair of 
the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, I

Modernization Act, immediately.

key national and regional organiza-
tions that advocate for farmworkers 
who, despite carrying the burden of in-
juries and illnesses during the pan-
demic, kept our country fed. 
We discussed injustices that our 
campesinos face when it comes to 
healthcare, education, housing, work-
ers’ rights, and immigration. Together, 
we are working together to craft mean-
ingful solutions to these challenges 
that will help our Nation’s farmworker 
communities thrive. 
An immediate solution is for the Sen-
ate to pass the bipartisan Farm Work-
force 
Modernization 
Act 
that 
the 
House has passed. We need 10 Repub-
lican Senators to agree and pass the 
Farm Workforce Modernization Act 
out of the Senate to make this much- 
needed legislation into law. 
Right now, from vineyards in Cali-
fornia to fields in the Midwest and 
ranches in the South, growers are con-
cerned about an unstable workforce 
and a labor shortage. Many farm-
workers toil in the fields with uncer-
tainty and fear of being deported and 
separated from their families. The 
COVID–19 pandemic has only height-
ened these concerns. 
Unfortunately, this uncertainty and 
these labor disruptions are contrib-
uting to the destabilization of our 
farms and to higher food prices across 
America. 
We need the Farm Workforce Mod-
ernization Act to bring certainty and 
solutions for growers, farmworkers, 
and their families. 
Now, more than ever, we must sta-
bilize and modernize our farm work-
force, keep families together, and se-
cure a pathway to citizenship for our 
essential and vital farmworkers. 
This Congress, the CHC recognized 
these urgent needs and led the charge 
to get this bipartisan bill passed out of 
the House. 
Now, I repeat, we just need 10 Repub-
lican Senators to get on board so that 
we can pass this out of the Senate and 
make it law. 
To them I say, Let’s get it done. 
To our Nation’s farmworkers, I say, 
We stand with you. We fight for you. 
The CHC is doubling down. We will 
never stop fighting for our farmworker 
communities. 
We 
will 
fight 
‘‘with 
strength,’’ ‘‘con puno y fuerza,’’ to en-
sure that their labor rights, immigra-
tion status, and access to education, 
healthcare and housing are secure. 
Together, we stand firm in our re-
solve and strong in our fight to protect 
farmworkers, our vital workforce, and 
their access to healthcare, education, 
housing rights, and citizenship. 
As the proud son of farmworkers, I 
stand before this body today to let our 
farmworkers know, ‘‘Together, we can. 
Yes, we can.’’ ‘‘Juntos podemos. Si se 
puede.’’

REMEMBERING PAUL LOVEZZOLA 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Georgia (Mr. CARTER) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, I rise today to remember the won-
derful life of Mr. Paul Lovezzola of 
Bloomingdale, Georgia, who passed 
away on Friday, June 3. He was 79 
years old. 
He was the owner and operator of the 
beloved Lovezzola’s Pizza Family Res-
taurant since 1978, which has proudly 
fed of city of Pooler for almost 45 
years. 
Above all, Paul was a devout family 
man who worked hard to support his 
family and spoil his grandchildren. 
Paul was orphaned at the age of 12. 
From that young age, he looked up to 
our military servicemembers, which 
led him to serve in the U.S. Air Force. 
He was communicant of Our Lady of 
Lourdes Catholic Church, where he is 
remembered as a people person, a hard 
worker, and for always having a story 
to tell. 
Paul served the people of Pooler for 
many years. In fact, he loved the city 
so much that he faced his restaurant 
toward Pooler instead of I–95. 
My prayers are with his wife of 57 
years, Juanita Lovezzola, and his three 
children, Steven, Sherri, and Tim, 
along with their nine grandchildren 
whom he dearly loved. 
RECOGNIZING SOUTHERN SOUL BARBEQUE 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, I rise today to recognize Southern 
Soul Barbeque for winning the Bruns-
wick-Golden Isles Small Business of 
the Year for their superior barbecue 
and service to their community. 
The Small Business of the Year 
award is awarded to a business that 
demonstrates excellent knowledge and 
integrity while providing a valuable 
service to the community. 
Southern Soul Barbeque has continu-
ously delivered their mission of sup-
port for the citizens and the local busi-
ness community while exhibiting ini-
tiative, creativity, and a can-do atti-
tude. 
Businesses like this are what binds 
our precious communities together and 
keeps our economies moving in the 
right direction. Plus, it is always great 
to enjoy some exceptional southern- 
style barbecue. 
I look forward to being in St. Simons 
for many reasons, but the pulled pork 
from Southern Soul Barbeque is cer-
tainly toward the top of the list. It is 
a must every time for me. 
It is my honor to recognize a com-
mendable business such as Southern 
Soul Barbeque, and I wish them great 
success in the future as they continue 
to set an example for other small busi-
nesses in the community. 
IN MEMORY OF KIRK WARNER 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, I rise today in memory of the leg-
endary and beloved Kirk Warner, a 
teacher, a coach, a mentor, a father 
figure, and a friend to so many in his 
community, 
who 
peacefully 
passed 
away last June 16. 
Kirk was a football fanatic with an 
apparent gift for the game from a 
young age, which ultimately led him to 
play tight end for the University of 
Georgia and then go on and spend 21 
seasons as the head coach of the Lib-
erty County High School football team. 
From his first day at the school, he 
made Liberty County his home and was 
known for being a humble man with a 
true passion for inspiring the next gen-
erations through his coaching. 
He was known for putting highly 
competitive teams on the field and 
took pride in his players being the best 
they could be, inspiring some to make 
it to the NFL. 
The fact that his players respect him 
as much as they do, truly speaks to his 
character as a coach and as a man. 
His legacy has been left for the rest 
of us to learn from and live by, to help 
guide the future generations of young 
student leaders and athletes through 
faith, love, and respect for others.

STANDING IN SOLIDARITY WITH 
THE LGBTQI+ COMMUNITY 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Michigan (Mr. LEVIN) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. LEVIN of Michigan. Mr. Speaker, 
I 
rise 
today 
in 
solidarity 
with 
transgender and nonbinary young peo-
ple and condemn the relentless dis-
criminatory, anti-LGBTQ+ bills and 
hateful rhetoric we are witnessing 
across the Nation. 
In recent months, Republican State 
legislatures and elected officials have 
targeted the LGBTQ+ community for 
cheap political gain and referred false-
ly to anyone who opposes attempts to 
infringe on the rights of others as 
‘‘groomers’’. 
There are at least 206 active bills 
across State legislatures this year 
alone that target the LGBTQ+ commu-
nity. 
Here are some samples of this hateful 
legislation: 
Excluding trans youth from partici-
pating in school sports. 
Restricting trans youth from access-
ing the bathroom. 
Banning curriculum to deny the ex-
istence of LGBTQ+ people in the class-
room. 
Criminalizing medical providers who 
provide gender-affirming healthcare. 
Targeting parents of LGBTQ+ chil-
dren who simply want to support their 
kids as best they can. 
That is right: LGBTQ+ rights are 
being attacked from all angles. 
In Texas, providing gender-affirming 
healthcare is now considered ‘‘child 
abuse,’’ and parents of transgender 
youth face a real risk of being sepa-
rated from their children. 
This month, in Idaho, a group of ex-
tremists were arrested after plotting to 
riot and cause violence during a Pride 
event. In recent days, as people around 
the United States have sought out the 
joyous parades and events that come 
with Pride Month, including in my own 
district, GOP politicians and preachers 
have put out calls for killing LGBTQ+ 
people.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE

June 23, 2022 
There is no doubt: Bigotry toward 
the LGBTQ+ community has grave and 
potentially 
life-threatening 
con-
sequences. According to the Trevor 
Project, in the past year, 45 percent of 
LGBTQ+ young people seriously con-
sidered attempting suicide, including 
more than half of transgender and non-
binary youth. Similarly, 93 percent of 
transgender and nonbinary youth re-
ported worrying about being denied ac-
cess to medical care due to State and 
local laws. 
Mr. Speaker, I stand here today as 
the dad of a gay son and a longtime 
ally of the LGBTQ+ community to say 
that these radical policies have no 
place in America and that this Con-
gress must take concrete action. 
In February of this year, I was proud 
to vote to pass the Equality Act, which 
protects LGBTQ+ people from discrimi-
nation in jobs, housing, and public ac-
commodations. While it would not 
undo every single one of these horrible 
State policies I have mentioned, it 
would go a long way to enhance the 
civil rights of the LGBTQ+ community 
and send the message that we stand 
against bigotry and hate. 
Unfortunately, the filibuster is hold-
ing this bill up in the Senate. One 
thing is for certain: The filibuster must 
be abolished to create any viable path-
way to send the Equality Act to Presi-
dent Biden’s desk. I urge my colleagues 
on the other side of the Capitol to hear 
the cries of the LGBTQ+ community 
members, and particularly trans and 
nonbinary young people, who need 
these protections desperately and are 
counting on your support. 
Here in the House, our work is far 
from done. I am glad we are consid-
ering the LGBTQI+ Data Inclusion Act, 
which improves data collection on sex-
ual orientation and gender identity to 
provide 
better 
resources 
for 
the 
LGBTQ+ community so that we have 
the data we need to make good law. We 
must also pass legislation to provide 
mental health care for LGBTQ+ people, 
offer hate crimes protections, and up-
lift and support the dignity of all 
LGBTQ+ individuals across this Na-
tion. 
All of us, regardless of sexual ori-
entation 
or 
gender identity, must 
stand collectively against this hate and 
foster inclusion for all. Let’s get to 
work.

FARM BILL IMPACT SERIES 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Kansas (Mr. MANN) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. MANN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
to deliver the twelfth installment of 
my Farm Bill Impact Series: The Sec-
ond State of Agriculture. 
We are at the end of the second quar-
ter, and one of the biggest issues facing 
agriculture across the board is the cost 
of things. Farmers, ranchers, and agri-
cultural producers are laboring under 
the skyrocketing input costs while 
they work hard to keep our country 
fed, fueled, and clothed. They deserve 
workable solutions to this inflation 
crisis before the situation gets any 
worse. 
The U.S. farm economy crashed in 
the early to mid-1980s due in part to 
surging inflation. From 2000 to 2020, 
the average annual rate of inflation 
was 2.1 percent, which economists con-
sider a normal rate of inflation that 
helps drive overall economic growth. 
Last year, prices increased 7 percent 
overall throughout 2021, which was the 
largest 
December-to-December 
per-
centage change since 1981. 
b 1045 
Inflation is a matter of life and death 
for the American farm. We saw it in 
the early 1980s, and now we are seeing 
it again. Farmers, ranchers, and agri-
cultural producers are feeling the ef-
fects of inflation more acutely than al-
most anyone else in America. 
In 
agriculture, 
commodity 
prices 
generally rise during periods of infla-
tion, but input costs rise as well. Data 
collected by USDA shows that over the 
past three decades, on average, the 
input costs for U.S. farmers, ranchers, 
and agricultural producers tend to in-
crease more than the rate of inflation 
and more than the prices that they re-
ceive for their products. To make mat-
ters worse, USDA estimates that input 
costs will continue to rise at least 5 to 
6 percent throughout 2022. 
In the last 12 months, feed, supplies, 
and repairs are all up 13 percent while 
ag chemicals, building materials, and 
machinery are all up 21 percent. 
Most shockingly, just during the last 
12 months, fuel is up 115 percent, nat-
ural gas is up 202 percent, and fertilizer 
is up 220 percent. 
Think about that. This year it is 
costing farmers more than double what 
it cost last year to farm their land. 
The farm bill contains relief safety 
net programs like crop insurance and 
livestock indemnity, but these pro-
grams don’t account for the rising 
costs of fuel, fertilizer, pesticides, and 
seed. Agriculture is a business, and 
business owners can’t afford to lose 
money year after year, which is hap-
pening now thanks to skyrocketing in-
flation. We need to get this situation 
under control. 
A Kansas wheat grower recently said 
to me: 
‘‘Fertilizer is one of the largest ex-
penses on any commercial farming op-
eration. My farm has already used 
more than 450 tons of fertilizer for this 
cropping season, which includes nearly 
350,000 pounds of UAN, specifically. 
Even though we cut back on how much 
we use because of the increased price, 
it will still cost our farm almost $70,000 
more than last year. Looking forward, 
we will undoubtedly have to cut back 
on fertilizer again until prices begin to 
come down.’’ 
Fertilizer cost is a major problem, 
but the rising cost of everything else is 
only compounding the issue further. 
For instance, if you are a Kansas 
rancher looking to replace all the fence 
on your farm with 4-barb, Red Brand 
wire, last year you would have been 
quoted $10,000 per mile. This year, 
quotes are coming in at around $20,000 
a mile, so it has doubled. Think about 
that. 
From fertilizer to fuel to equipment 
to fencing, inflation is crushing pro-
ducers across this country. How can 
small business owners keep up with 
this? How can we expect the people 
who bear the responsibility of feeding, 
fueling, and clothing the world to 
shoulder that burden while going broke 
from doing so? 
The people who make sacrifices so 
that we can eat can’t afford to buy gas 
to drive their kids to school right now. 
They can’t afford to pay their mort-
gages. American farmers are perfectly 
capable of producing plentiful, healthy 
affordable food, but no matter how 
much they grow and sell, inflation is 
killing their margins and they are 
going out of business. 
How does the Biden administration 
respond to this crisis? Well, the Presi-
dent’s budget proposal dismantles the 
stepped-up basis and imposes new cap-
ital gains taxes like the farm killer tax 
on small businesses held in families for 
90 years or more. These proposals 
would destroy thousands of American 
family farms overnight. House Demo-
crats, for their part, would like to dis-
tract the Federal Reserve with social 
policy while inflation is at a 40-year 
high. 
These ideas are a slap in the face to 
every American farmer, rancher, and 
agricultural producer. While this ad-
ministration burns through money like 
there is no tomorrow, American pro-
ducers are working tirelessly to keep 
America secure despite the effects of 
inflation on their businesses. We owe 
them not only a debt of gratitude, but 
also real solutions to the inflation cri-
sis before it is too late.

SOCIAL SECURITY—A SACRED 
TRUST 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Connecticut (Mr. LARSON) for 5 min-
utes. 
Mr. LARSON of Connecticut. Mr. 
Speaker, this global pandemic has im-
pacted every nation in the world. But 
here in America, as we have seen, with 
just over a million people who have 
passed, 750,000 of them are over the age 
of 65. 
Those seniors are also the people 
hurt hardest by inflation, as are all the 
individuals who are on a fixed income. 
Democrats have a plan. We have a plan 
to address all of Americans’ rising ex-
penses that they are experiencing. We 
have a plan to address them today, to-
morrow, and into the future. It is 
called Social Security.

ber one antipoverty program for the el-
derly and the number one antipoverty

program for children. And yet, Con-
gress has not taken any action to ex-
pand benefits in more than 50 years. 
Democrats have a plan to expand bene-
fits today, tomorrow, and forever. 
The Republicans have a plan also. 
Their plan is to end Social Security in 
5 years. It is time for us to have this 
debate in front of the American public, 
not behind closed doors and let people 
know where their Member stands. 
Mr. Speaker, I refer you to this post-
er behind me. This poster demonstrates 
that Democrats have a plan to increase 
Social Security benefits. Republicans 
have a plan to cut benefits 20 percent 
across the aboard. 
Democrats have a plan that will en-
sure that Americans are able to keep 
pace with inflation and rising costs. 
The last time Congress did anything 
with Social Security, a gallon of milk 
was 71 cents. We all know what the 
cost of living is today, but inaction is 
inexcusable. 
The Republicans call for 20 separate 
benefit cuts to Social Security, and 
most importantly, say we are going to 
get there by raising the age. For every 
year you raise the age, that is a 7 per-
cent cut in people’s benefits. The idea 
that people would say, Well, people are 
living longer so we have to raise their 
age—imagine that. So you are living 
longer; the Republicans want you to 
live on less or work until you die. 
The time of reckoning is upon us. 
President Biden has called Social Secu-
rity a sacred trust. As you heard Mr. 
RUIZ say before, the concept of making 
sure that WEP and GPO is repealed so 
that teachers and firefighters and po-
licemen can get the benefits they de-
serve, and also to make sure that no-
body who works all their life and pays 
into a system. These are not entitle-
ments, as they say in their book and in 
their Republican study plan. These are 
the benefits that people have paid for 
out of their pockets; working people, of 
all races, colors, and creed in this Na-
tion who deserve that sacred trust, 
that promise that the American people 
know is theirs in the sacred trust that 
Social Security represents. 
The Republicans have a plan to end 
Social Security in 5 years. How about 
you join us and expand Social Security 
benefits for people who need them in 
the midst of this pandemic, in the face 
of what is happening to our seniors. 
The time to act is now. We don’t need 
a double-secret probation study like 
they are advocating in the Senate. We 
need to do this out in public, with the 
people, demonstrating what we stand 
for. 
Democrats stand for enhancing bene-
fits and improving the quality of life of 
our seniors. You stand for cutting their 
benefits and ending Social Security in 
5 years. 
Mr. Speaker, we will have a Special 
Order on this topic later today. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Mem-
bers are reminded to direct their com-
ments to the Chair. 
KEEP KIDS FED ACT 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Utah (Mr. OWENS) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. OWENS. Mr. Speaker, summer is 
the hungriest time of year for over 11 
million children currently facing food 
insecurity. That is 11 million children 
who rely on school meals as their only 
meal of the day. 
The Federal waivers that provide free 
or reduced-price meals—especially dur-
ing the prolonged school closures—are 
set to expire at the end of the month, 
leaving far too many students without 
a reliable food source. 
Local schools are facing an uphill 
battle: Four-decade high inflation, sky-
rocketing costs of food, and supply 
chain disruptions have made for unique 
challenges in my district and across 
the country. 
The Keep Kids Fed Act will transi-
tion schools—and the families served— 
back to paid school meal programs 
without increasing costs to taxpayers. 
Mr. Speaker, I am proud to be a co-
sponsor to the Keep Kids Fed Act, and 
I urge Congress to do its part and pass 
this important legislation.

MY BODY, MY DATA ACT 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
California (Ms. JACOBS) for 5 minutes. 
Ms. 
JACOBS 
of 
California. 
Mr. 
Speaker, right now, as we meet in this 
Chamber, the Supreme Court is releas-
ing a new slate of opinions. And like 
millions of people across the country, I 
have been waiting with dread for what 
is coming. As we wait, we are texting, 
messaging our friends and loved ones, 
providing support, looking for more in-
formation, and it is all taking place on 
our devices. That is how we live in 2022. 
I am determined to make sure that 
as we continue to fight for our rights, 
we do so with policies that reflect to-
day’s world. That is why I am proud to 
have introduced the My Body, My Data 
Act, new legislation to protect our per-
sonal reproductive health data. I am 
proud that Senator HIRONO and Senator 
WYDEN have introduced a companion 
bill in the Senate and that we have 43 
cosponsors from across the ideological 
spectrum here in the House. 
When the Supreme Court’s draft deci-
sion on Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s 
Health Organization leaked, the deci-
sion that would undo decades of prece-
dent and overturn the landmark opin-
ion of Roe v. Wade, I immediately 
started hearing from friends and con-
stituents, panicked that their repro-
ductive health data could fall into the 
wrong hands, panicked that the per-
sonal information on their phones, on 
their computers could be used against 
them in a post-Roe world where abor-
tion is criminalized and where laws, 
like the Texas bounty hunter law, give 
extremists a financial incentive to tar-
get vulnerable people. 
Shortly after, experts started sound-
ing the alarm that our personal repro-
ductive health data—from search en-
gines to menstruation and pregnancy- 
tracking apps—would be used to target 
people if abortion is criminalized. 
Right now, there are no protections 
from that happening. 
Mr. Speaker, as a young woman, re-
productive 
healthcare 
is 
my 
healthcare. And like tens of millions of 
Americans, I have used apps to track 
my period. When the draft decision 
leaked, I knew we couldn’t wait for the 
final opinion. We couldn’t just wait for 
Roe to be overturned so I got to work, 
because it is unconscionable that our 
personal 
reproductive 
information 
could be sold to the highest bidder and 
weaponized against us—and especially 
against low-income people and people 
of color, who would be the most im-
pacted if Roe is overturned. 
To protect access, Congress must 
codify the right to an abortion, and I 
am proud to be an original cosponsor of 
the Women’s Health Protection Act. 
Alongside strong protections for abor-
tion access, we need strong privacy 
protections. That is why I introduced 
the My Body, My Data Act. Our per-
sonal reproductive and sexual health 
information is our most sensitive and 
personal data, and it deserves the high-
est level of privacy protection that the 
government can provide. 
I am proud to say that is what the 
My Body, My Data Act accomplishes. 
It is endorsed by Planned Parenthood, 
NARAL, the Electronic Frontier Foun-
dation, and many others. This bill re-
stricts 
businesses 
and 
nongovern-
mental organizations from collecting, 
using, retaining, or disclosing repro-
ductive 
health 
information 
beyond 
what is strictly necessary to provide a 
product or service. 
The bill provides everyday people 
with the right to access or delete their 
personal reproductive health informa-
tion, if they choose to, and it requires 
organizations to publish their privacy 
policies. 
Importantly, the My Body, My Data 
Act includes strong enforcement mech-
anisms, including a private right of ac-
tion that allows individuals to bring a 
lawsuit if their privacy is violated. 
With 26 States likely or certain to 
ban abortion if Roe is overturned, this 
legislation is more urgent than ever. I 
am proud to lead this legislation, and I 
urge my colleagues to support it.

RED FLAG LAWS RIPE FOR ABUSE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
North Carolina (Mr. CAWTHORN) for 5 
minutes. 
Mr. CAWTHORN. Mr. Speaker, our 
Founders 
were 
clear. 
The 
Second 
Amendment was designed as the back-
bone upon which individual rights and 
liberties could be secured. 
Efforts by the ruling class in our gov-
ernment are aimed at crippling this 
Nation and corroding our Republic.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5832 
June 23, 2022 
It is true: Red flag laws sound benign 
on paper. Flagging dangerous individ-
uals and keeping them from weaponry 
seems like a cut-and-dried issue, but a 
simple cursory glance at the actions of 
our overreaching Federal Government 
clearly shows that these laws are ripe 
for Federal abuse. They will abuse your 
rights and mine. 
Make no mistake, red flag laws will 
be used to flag those who vote for free-
dom, strip them of their right to self- 
defense, and empower faceless bureau-
crats to dole out or not to dole out the 
right of self-defense to a downtrodden 
and oppressed class of citizens. 
They will be weaponized to demonize 
and destroy political dissidents in this 
country. If you raise your children to 
adhere to Proverbs instead of POTUS, 
you may be stripped of your gun rights. 
If you vote against the regime, you 
may be stripped of your gun rights. If 
you 
refuse 
the 
medical 
decisions 
pushed by the regime, you may be 
stripped of your gun rights. 
To the American people, I say this: It 
is not a right if you have to ask per-
mission to exercise it. We are very near 
to this government becoming the exact 
reason our Founders penned the Second 
Amendment, not to hunt deer but to 
defend against tyranny or invasion. 
Red flag laws sound harmless on 
paper. We all want to keep firearms out 
of the hands of dangerous people, but 
remember who the government says 
that you are. The CDC has labeled you 
a national security problem for pro-
tecting your health. The FBI, last Sep-
tember, called your mothers and wives 
domestic terrorists for protecting your 
children. A House committee labeled 
half the country as coup-sympathetic 
just a few weeks ago. 
The same faceless fact checkers who 
censor your speech will seize your sov-
ereignty and come to your front door, 
and they won’t be coming with a clip-
board and a smile. 
These liberal lackeys will show up 
before dawn, invade your home, seize 
your property, and smash any concept 
of individual liberty you may possess. 
Remember the actions the ruling elite 
took against those at Waco and Ruby 
Ridge. 
We must wake up. We cannot trust 
this government, and we must not give 
them more legal avenues to persecute 
Americans that they took an oath to 
defend. 
INVESTIGATE FIRES AT FOOD PROCESSING 
FACILITIES 
Mr. CAWTHORN. Mr. Speaker, what 
is next? You want our guns. You took 
our gas. Now, it seems that even the 
simple act of providing food is too dif-
ficult for this administration to ac-
complish. 
Last week, according to The Wash-
ington Times, a fire ravaged a Festive 
Foods plant near Waupaca, Wisconsin. 
Earlier 
this 
month, 
at 
a 
JBS 
meatpacking plant near Green Bay, a 
fire caused nearly $30,000 in damage. In 
April, fires destroyed the headquarters 
of Azure Standard, a distributor of or-
ganic food in Oregon; the Taylor Farms 
processing facility in Salinas, Cali-
fornia; and an East Conway Beef & 
Pork butcher shop and slaughterhouse 
in Conway, New Hampshire. 
At least 12 U.S. food processing fa-
cilities have burned down in the last 6 
months. Does no one else believe that 
this is worth an investigation? 
This comes as 37 million chickens 
have been killed on U.S. poultry farms 
this year due to the avian flu, the 
worst outbreak in recorded U.S. his-
tory, and the deaths of at least 2,000 
cattle in Kansas during a heat wave 
this month. 
These accidents are coming at a time 
of shortages across our Nation. Essen-
tials such as fuel, semiconductors, and 
even baby formula have ceased being 
commodities and have become as rare 
as coherent speech from the White 
House. 
The American people have every 
right to be skeptical and to demand an-
swers about the incidents shutting 
down food facilities. 
It begs the question: What exactly 
are they doing in the White House 
about this? Why has a seemingly 
unexplainable series of food industry 
accidents 
gone 
unreported 
by 
the 
media? 
Mr. Speaker, does no one care that 
children are starving while you and 
your colleagues feast at Le Diplomate? 
We survived the Great Depression be-
cause our supply chains were local and 
a large share of American households 
grew much of their own food. I hope we 
are all practicing hunting and gar-
dening because I am afraid that we 
may need it soon. 
f 
CELEBRATING LIBERTY 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
Texas (Ms. JACKSON LEE) for 5 minutes. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I 
love this Nation, and I stand on the 
premise of the Declaration of Independ-
ence. Even though my ancestors did 
not benefit at the origins of this Na-
tion, I am a patriot. 
I remind my fellow colleagues of the 
Declaration of Independence: 
We hold these truths to be self-evident, 
that all men and women are created equal, 
that they are endowed by their creator with 
certain unalienable rights, that among these 
are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. 
Our Founding Fathers understood 
that this Nation would grow and would 
breathe life into these words and 
breathe life into democracy. The Con-
stitution began with: 
We the people of United States, in order to 
form a more perfect Union, establish justice, 
ensure domestic tranquility, provide for the 
common defense, promote the general wel-
fare, and secure the blessings of liberty. 
This is a living document that en-
sures that we safeguard America and, 
particularly, that we safeguard its citi-
zens and our children. 
This Pride Month, I wish all of those 
who are in our wonderful community of 
LGBTQ a wonderful existence and rec-
ognition of their individual liberty. I 
am so grateful that this Nation allows 
everyone to have a seat at the table. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleagues 
for 
their 
vigorous 
celebration 
of 
Juneteenth, which is legislation that I 
introduced and fought for, for over a 
decade. I am so amazed at the celebra-
tions from east to west and north to 
south, understanding the ancestors of 
African descendants didn’t get free in 
Texas until June 1865. 
All of us, no matter our backgrounds, 
were having celebrations. Members, 
Republicans and Democrats, were join-
ing in on the liberty of Juneteenth. 
That gives me hope as we move to dis-
cuss the response to H.R. 40, the Com-
mission to Study and Develop Repara-
tion Proposals for African Americans 
Act, and find ways for repair and res-
toration. It gives me hope. 
As I mentioned, this Pride Month is 
about liberty and empowerment for all 
people. I stand here on the floor of the 
House with such excitement and ex-
hilaration that I have standing on the 
foundation of this very book that cov-
ers the Declaration of Independence 
and the Constitution. That is why it is 
so important to fight for democracy 
and to recognize the sovereignty of this 
Nation. 
Mr. Speaker, I ask my fellow col-
leagues to join me in fighting for the 
release 
of 
Brittney 
Griner, 
Paul 
Whelan, and many others who are held 
as hostages, and those who went to vol-
unteer to fight for democracy in 
Ukraine who are now held. 
I raise my voice for Brittney Griner 
today, a young woman born and raised 
in Houston, Texas, a graduate of Nim-
itz High School whose family in Hous-
ton is in desperate need for us to pay 
attention to the very vile way that she 
now is being held as a hostage in Rus-
sia. 
I ask the Russian people and Mr. 
Putin to release these people, release 
them from this inappropriate deten-
tion, incarceration, and holding. Re-
lease them now. 
Let us pray with the family. Release 
them now. Release Brittney Griner. 
Free 
Brittney 
Griner, 
a 
renowned 
WNBA player and Olympian, but just a 
plain human being, an American who 
has shown herself to love this country 
and to be such a wonderful, generous 
person who gives to others, as many 
have said. 
Mr. Speaker, my colleague Congress-
man STANTON of Arizona, my colleague 
Congressman ALLRED, and I will be pre-
senting a resolution that says: Free 
Brittney Griner now. 
Mr. Speaker, I want to talk about 
how we honor our dear friend, who 
passed away in 2020, John Lewis. 
I am reminded of his nonviolent ten-
dencies, and he taught us well. In 
teaching us, we were here on the floor 
of the House to demand gun safety leg-
islation some years ago. At one point, 
we just couldn’t manage it and take it 
anymore. We sat on the House floor. I

have pictures that I will cherish be-
cause it was nonviolent resistance. 
Now, we have an opportunity to 
stand in the gap for the families in 
Uvalde, families in Buffalo and Tulsa, 
and pass real gun safety legislation. 
Join us and be what America is all 
about, taking care, creating a more 
perfect Union, Mr. Speaker, and pass-
ing gun safety legislation that I and 
the Judiciary Committee, Chairman 
NADLER, and other Members have real-
ly stood up for.

RECOGNIZING MATTHEW E. 
MCLOGAN 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Michigan (Mr. MEIJER) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. MEIJER. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize west Michigan’s 
own Grand Valley State University 
Vice President Matthew E. McLogan, 
who for nearly 35 years has delivered 
unparalleled leadership and expertise 
to our region’s academic communities. 
Originally hired in 1987—I won’t men-
tion that that is the year before I was 
born—he is the longest serving execu-
tive officer in university history. 
Prior to his time at GVSU, Matt was 
a fixture in broadcast news and served 
honorably as Michigan’s former public 
service commissioner with a booming 
baritone voice that many of us recog-
nize. 
He took the exceptional skill set that 
he had built in these professions and 
brought it to Grand Valley State Uni-
versity. When Matt joined GVSU and 
became a Laker, the school’s lone cam-
pus was home to just 8,000 students. As 
of 2022, the Laker community has 
grown threefold, boasting over 23,000 
students across five locations. Their 
technological centers, libraries, and re-
sources are the envy of competing uni-
versities at home in west Michigan and 
across the Nation. 
Having served through the previous 
four of five university presidents, Matt 
facilitated 
and 
witnessed 
firsthand 
Grand Valley State University’s his-
toric expansion. For years, he has been 
essential to the success of Grand Val-
ley’s executive leadership, playing a 
crucial role in government and alumni 
relations and the school’s marketing 
programs and as secretary to the board 
of trustees. 
Matt maintains responsibility for 
some of the institution’s memorable 
accomplishments: 
the 
university’s 
presence on our famous Medical Mile in 
Grand Rapids, the school’s unprece-
dented expansion, and game-changing 
additions requiring public support. 
Matt is known widely throughout the 
community as one of west Michigan’s 
best boosters and academic profes-
sionals. 
It is largely thanks to the leadership 
and 
expertise 
of 
Vice 
President 
McLogan that GVSU is poised to con-
tinue unprecedented growth for years 
to come. Matt has brought great for-
tune to the Lakers, and there is no 
doubt that the successes of his leader-
ship have made a lasting impact on our 
community. 
Mr. Speaker, it is my distinct honor 
to take this time to recognize his ac-
complishments. I applaud Matt for his 
decades of selfless leadership and serv-
ice to the Grand Valley State Univer-
sity community. I can say with great 
certainty that his accomplishments 
will not soon be forgotten. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman 
from Michigan (Mr. HUIZENGA), my col-
league and friend from the Second Dis-
trict. 
Mr. HUIZENGA. Mr. Speaker, I ap-
preciate my colleague yielding. As we 
come to the floor to honor Matt, I 
know that Matt and his colleagues are 
watching right now. 
My colleague was able to run through 
the litany of his career, but I will note 
that, in 1987, I was just graduating 
from high school when Matt was hired. 
He has had an incredible tenure. 
I can tell you that throughout his ca-
reer, Matt has put the staff and Grand 
Valley community at the center of it 
all, but most importantly, it was about 
the students for him. It was always 
about the students. 
Whether it was him looking out for 
who would be the next leader for the 
student council and the student body 
president or who would be a great in-
tern in an office like mine or many 
others, whether it be in Lansing or in 
Washington, D.C., Matt was always 
there for the students. 
As was said, when he joined the uni-
versity, it was a smaller college of 8,000 
students literally in the middle of a 
cornfield, and it now is this jug-
gernaut, powerhouse of a university in 
Michigan with five locations and 23,000 
students. That is, in part, due to Matt’s 
efforts. 
Mr. Speaker, I have had the privilege 
of knowing Matt personally for well 
over 25 years, and I, too, grew up lis-
tening to Matt on local television at 
first. I can tell you that his wisdom, 
his counsel, and his encouragement 
that he has to offer to friends, family, 
and colleagues is something that he is 
known for. I have never met anyone 
quite so positive as Matt when it comes 
to life. 
In addition to his time at Grand Val-
ley and his time on television, he 
served the State in lots of various 
ways, on committees and commissions. 
b 1115 
One very notable one was the Public 
Service Commission as he was there 
serving and trying to help lead the di-
rection of the State through multiple 
administrations 
and 
various 
Gov-
ernors. 
I will tell you this though, Mr. 
Speaker, the thing that Matt is espe-
cially known for is his Michigan polit-
ical trivia. Now, I can tell you that if 
you had been wondering who the Lieu-
tenant Governor was in 1923, all you 
had to do was ask Matt. He would be 
able to tell you, and he is probably tell-
ing and saying the name right now to 
his colleagues as he is watching this. 
So here is what I need to say today: 
Congratulations, Matt, and thank you. 
Jane is going to enjoy that time to-
gether with you. I know that you have 
got more coming. Even though you 
may not have quite figured it out, I 
know you are fighting to the very end 
for Grand Valley and for that budget 
period that is in Lansing right now. 
But here is something that we all 
need to know: Matt is a Laker for life, 
and I thank him for his service. 
f 
PELL GRANT ANNIVERSARY 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
California (Mr. PANETTA) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. PANETTA. Mr. Speaker, today I 
rise to celebrate the 50th anniversary 
of the Federal Pell grant. Created in 
1972, the Pell targets students with a 
demonstrated financial need. It helps 
cover the cost of tuition, fees, room 
and board, and many, many other ex-
penses. 
Now, unlike loans which can burden 
low-income students, Pell grants do 
not need to be repaid. The Pell actually 
helps students focus on school rather 
than have them wondering about how 
to pay for it. 
The Pell has benefited more than 80 
million students in the past 50 years 
and is an absolute lifeline for students 
at colleges in my district on the cen-
tral coast of California. Currently, 
there are close to 16,000 students re-
ceiving $68 million in Pell grants to 
pursue their higher education goals at 
our local colleges and universities. 
Now, clearly, support for the Pell is 
widespread and bipartisan. I am proud 
to say that we here in Congress actu-
ally increased the Pell by $400 for 2022. 
That is the largest increase, Mr. 
Speaker, to the Pell in 10 years, but I 
think you would agree with me that 
this is not enough. As we celebrate this 
anniversary, Mr. Speaker, the Pell now 
only covers less than one-third of aver-
age attendance costs. So we must do 
everything we can to strengthen the 
Pell. I believe we can do that by dou-
bling the Pell. 
I look forward to working with my 
colleagues to ensure that that happens 
and ensure that students, regardless of 
need, can afford college and attain a 
brighter future.

ments in Orlando and representing

RECOGNIZING THE ACCOMPLISHMENTS OF 
MAXWELL RANTILLA OF BETTENDORF, IOWA 
Mrs. MILLER-MEEKS. Mr. Speaker, 
I rise today to recognize the accom-
plishments of Maxwell Rantilla of 
Bettendorf, Iowa. 
Maxwell is currently a junior at 
Bettendorf High School. This past 
year, Maxwell joined millions of stu-
dents across the country in taking the 
ACT test. This test is used by colleges 
to help with admissions decisions and 
tests students on their knowledge of 
English, reading, math, and science. 
Maxwell’s commitment to studying 
paid off when he got a perfect score on 
the ACT. Out of the millions of high 
schoolers who take the standardized 
test, only 0.5 percent receive a perfect 
score. 
Maxwell 
is 
very 
involved 
at 
Bettendorf High School, qualifying for 
the national tournament the past 3 
years in the speech and debate club. He 
is a member of the school band and the 
president of Bettendorf High School’s 
National Honor Society. 
I congratulate Maxwell on this out-
standing accomplishment. I know that 
this is just the beginning of his jour-
ney, and I cannot wait to hear about 
his future accomplishments and en-
deavors.

HONORING THE LIFE OF JESUS 
RODRIGUEZ 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
California (Mrs. KIM) for 5 minutes. 
Mrs. KIM of California. Mr. Speaker, 
I rise to honor the life of Jesus Rodri-
guez, a La Habra resident, a dear 
friend, a community leader, a Korean 
war veteran, and a Silver Star recipi-
ent who recently lost his fight against 
cancer. 
He joined the Army after dropping 
out of his junior year of high school, 
deploying to Okinawa and then to the 
Korean war. At age 19, he was dis-
charged as a corporal and came back 
home to begin and raise his family. 
Jesus moved up the ranks from janitor 
to plant manager and worked really 
hard. 
Throughout his entire life, however, 
he never forgot his time in war, and 
neither did his 29th Infantry Regiment. 
After sharing his story at a reunion, 
Jesus accepted every invitation to 
speak to area veteran groups, ROTC 
units, and the local Korean commu-
nity. 
Although Jesus is no longer with us, 
I know his story and his sacrifice will 
live on and inspire others.

PRAYER 
The Chaplain, the Reverend Margaret 
Grun Kibben, offered the following 
prayer: 
Almighty God, give us eyes of faith. 
Like little ones who live with open 
hearts, open minds, and open hands, re-
mind us that, as Your children, You 
welcome us into Your arms and hear 
our prayers. 
Restore to us if not the innocence of 
the young—for we have seen, heard, 
and experienced too much to be that 
naive—then grant us the ability to 
trust You and the people and purpose 
You put before us. Dispel our cynicism 
and hurt and open our hearts to Your 
movement in our lives. 
Enable us to be respectful of dif-
ferences of opinion. Relieve us of our 
need to dismiss people who disagree 
with us with labels and stereotypes, 
and open our minds to find not only 
our shared passions but the value of di-
versity in the health of our society. 
Then encourage us to reach out in 
ways that will bolster up the other. For 
woe to the one who is alone and has no 
one to lift him up. Woe, too, to the one 
whose helping hands are bound by fear 
and contempt. Open our hands that we 
would be a strength and encourage-
ment to those around us. 
We give You thanks for the blessings 
You bestow on each of Your children. 
And 
we 
pray 
Your 
blessing 
that 
through what we seek to accomplish 
today, all would feel Your loving em-
brace. 
In the name of the one who gives us 
life that we may live it abundantly, we 
pray. 
Amen.

MESSAGE FROM THE SENATE 
A message from the Senate by Ms. 
Byrd, one of its clerks, announced that 
the Senate has passed bills of the fol-

BIOMEDICAL RESEARCH 
ALLEVIATES SUFFERING 
(Mr. HIGGINS of New York asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute.) 
Mr. HIGGINS of New York. Madam 
Speaker, biomedical research can ac-
celerate discoveries to alleviate human 
suffering due to illness if we allow it. 
The speed with which the COVID–19 
vaccines 
were 
developed 
using 
groundbreaking messenger RNA tech-
nology is one of the most important 
biomedical advancements in 100 years. 
By establishing the Advanced Re-
search Projects Agency for Health, oth-
erwise known as ARPA-H, we can har-
ness those lessons for new discoveries 
in many other diseases. 
The potential for lifesaving treat-
ments for devastating conditions like 
ALS, diabetes, Alzheimer’s, and cancer 
is right in front of us. For millions of 
Americans suffering and the people 
who love them, this can’t come soon 
enough.

THE ONLY CHOICE IS LIFE 
(Ms. FOXX asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Ms. FOXX. Madam Speaker, we al-
ways hear Democrats preach about 
choice when it comes to the issue of 
abortion. However, we never hear them 
discuss the other side of the coin, 
choosing life instead of death. 
We do not hear them condemn crimi-
nal acts, such as the defacing of

churches or crisis pregnancy centers 
being firebombed and vandalized by 
radical progressive activists. 
If they believe choice is so impor-
tant, why don’t they respect the people 
who refuse to choose death and instead 
choose life? 
Democrats use ‘‘choice’’ as a subjec-
tive term. They agree with choice as 
long as you agree with them—choice on 
their terms. 
Madam Speaker, Americans over-
whelmingly choose life. We would all 
do well to remember that. 
f 
CONOR FRYER HAS BEEN AN 
INVALUABLE ASSET 
(Ms. BROWN of Ohio asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
her remarks.) 
Ms. BROWN of Ohio. Madam Speak-
er, I rise to thank my communications 
director, Conor Fryer, for his commit-
ment to the 11th Congressional District 
of Ohio and his invaluable contribu-
tions to my team and that of my prede-
cessor. 
Conor joined the office in 2019 under 
the leadership of then-Congresswoman 
and now Secretary Marcia L. Fudge 
and was pivotal in my transition in 
2021. He consistently raised the bar and 
that of those around him. 
When we arrived in Congress, we had 
a skeleton crew of a staff. Conor al-
ways stepped in and stepped up, filling 
those gaps, from legislation to trans-
portation and everything in between. 
His boundless energy, strategic cre-
ativity, and Ohio pride has served my 
constituents well. I wish Conor well as 
he moves closer to reaching his long- 
term professional goals. He will be 
missed.

BIDEN MUST ADDRESS OPEN 
BORDERS FOR TERRORISTS 
(Mr. WILSON of South Carolina 
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend his remarks.) 
Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. 
Madam Speaker, American families are 
at greater risk of mass murder ter-
rorist attacks than ever before due to 
the failing border policies of President 
Biden. 
Intentionally opening the southern 
border, nearly 3 million illegal aliens 
from over 160 countries have intruded 
since Biden took office. 
American jobs are destroyed. Deadly 
drugs are smuggled by cartels, leading 
to over 100,000 deaths last year, dev-
astating American families. Most grue-
some is the imminent danger of known 
terrorists from the Terrorist Screening 
Database crossing into America. 
Last year, in Del Rio, Texas, officials 
would not reveal to me the number of 
terrorists crossing. Now, we see the 
threat is real, with 50 terrorists just 
this year. These terrorists are skilled, 
well-financed, fully equipped, and ma-
niacally motivated mass murderers. 
Open borders for terrorists must be 
addressed. Biden should now take every 
action to protect American families. 
In conclusion, God bless our troops 
who successfully protected America for 
20 years in the global war on terrorism, 
as it continues, moving from the Af-
ghanistan safe haven to America. 
f 
EXPANDING BENEFITS FOR 
VETERANS EXPOSED TO TOXINS 
(Mr. KAHELE asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. KAHELE. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today in strong support of the Hon-
oring our PACT Act. 
The PACT Act will finally expand 
benefits and comprehensive healthcare 
for millions of veterans who have been 
exposed to toxic substances while serv-
ing their country. 
Included in this bill is the Mark 
Takai Atomic Veterans Healthcare 
Parity Act, championed by my dear 
friend, the late Congressman Mark 
Takai, who served his country admi-
rably as a lieutenant colonel in the Ha-
waii Army National Guard and as Ha-
waii’s 
First 
Congressional 
District 
Representative. 
The United States conducted 43 nu-
clear tests on Enewetak Atoll, located 
in the Marshall Islands. In the 1970s, 
U.S. servicemembers risked their lives 
to clean radioactive material from 
Enewetak Atoll. 
Without the PACT Act, veterans who 
served at Enewetak are not eligible for 
much-needed benefits. 
I am honored to continue Congress-
man Mark Takai’s legacy by proudly 
casting my vote for the Honoring our 
PACT Act to ensure that we improve 
on our sacred obligation to care for our 
veterans and their families. 
f 
RECOGNIZING MUSICAL PRODIGY 
TAYTE CHOUDHURY 
(Mr. NEHLS asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. NEHLS. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize a true musical prod-
igy with the kind of gift that many of 
us may only come across once in a life-
time, 
my 
constituent 
Tayte 
Choudhury. 
At only 17 years old, Tayte is inter-
nationally 
recognized 
for 
his 
out-
standing ability in piano. He is a first- 
place winner of the American Protege 
award and is performing a winning 
piece at the world-renowned Carnegie 
Hall in New York City on June 26. 
Despite a physical disability that left 
him 70 percent deaf in both ears, Tayte 
has achieved great success in both 
music and scholastics. I was sent a 
video of Tayte playing this week and 
was completely blown away to be hear-
ing and seeing such talent that can 
only be handed down by God himself. 
But the thing about talent like that 
is that it is meaningless without hard 
work, sacrifice, resilience, and an en-
tire village to get you where you need 
to go. 
From myself and all of Texas 22, we 
are extremely proud of you, Tayte, and 
can’t way to see how high you fly.

JOSEPH HART’S PASSING LEAVES 
A VOID 
(Ms. SCANLON asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Ms. 
SCANLON. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
local journalism is the lifeblood of our 
democracy and the backbone of our 
communities. I rise today to honor the 
life and legacy of a constituent who 
dedicated his career to that very Amer-
ican public service. Joseph Hart, an 
award-winning local journalist who 
spent his career telling the stories of 
our community, most recently as exec-
utive editor of the Delaware County 
Daily Times, tragically passed away 
this week. 
He leaves behind a void in the hearts 
of his colleagues and readers across 
PA–5 who have relied on his insightful 
and dependable reporting for decades. 
Joe grew up with the Delco Times, 
starting as an intern 40 years ago and 
rising to executive editor in 2020. His 
friends and colleagues describe an in-
credible friend, mentor, and journalist, 
calling him kind, witty, principled, en-
thusiastic, 
knowledgeable, 
profes-
sional, and passionate. 
In the words of retired Delco Times 
editor Phil Heron, ‘‘The institutional 
knowledge Joe had of the county, you 
can’t replace that. He was the walking 
encyclopedia of Delco politics.’’ 
Our hearts go out to Joe’s family, 
friends, and his team at the Delco 
Times as they mourn this tremendous 
loss. 
f 
COMBATING THE OPIOID EPIDEMIC 
(Mrs. SPARTZ asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mrs. SPARTZ. Madam Speaker, my 
district in central Indiana represents a 
cross-section of our Nation, cities, sub-
urbs, and rural farmland, none of which 
have proven themselves immune to the 
devastating possibility of opioid addic-
tion. 
Americans know that we must use 
every tool at our disposal to combat 
the opioid pandemic killing young and 
old. Unfortunately, the Federal Gov-
ernment ties the hands of doctors, lim-
iting their ability to hold long-acting 
injectable addiction treatment to just 
14 days after receipt from pharmacy. 
To remedy this problem, last Novem-
ber, I introduced the IMPACT Act with 
Congresswoman DEAN, which passed 
the House as part of H.R. 7666. I am 
grateful to my colleagues for their sup-
port of this legislation, and I urge the 
Senate and administration to do the 
same.

BRING HOME ILLEGAL DETAINEES 
IN RUSSIA 
(Mr. STANTON asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. STANTON. Madam Speaker, for 
126 days now, Brittney Griner has been 
wrongfully detained by Russia. 
Every single day that goes by is a 
lifetime for her wife, Cherelle, her fam-
ily, friends, and teammates on the 
Phoenix Mercury. 
As mayor of Phoenix, I was so lucky 
to watch her develop and grow as a pro-
fessional athlete and also as a re-
spected leader in the Phoenix commu-
nity. One of the best basketball players 
of our generation, she has won gold 
medals representing the United States 
twice at the Olympic Games. Like 
many WNBA players, she needed to 
supplement her income by playing pro-
fessional basketball in Russia, and she 
was proud to do so. 
But, now, Brittney finds herself a 
prisoner of the Russian Government. 
Her legal hearings continue to be de-
layed without good reason. It is unac-
ceptable. 
It is time for the House to speak with 
one 
unified 
voice 
and 
call 
for 
Brittney’s safe return and to show sup-
port for every American wrongfully de-
tained in Russia.

BIDEN’S BABY FORMULA CRISIS 
(Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania asked 
and was given permission to address 
the House for 1 minute and to revise 
and extend his remarks.) 
Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania. Madam 
Speaker, in the past 18 months, Presi-
dent Biden has shown the American 
people that he and his administration 
are not prepared to lead. 
According to a new whistleblower re-
port, problems at the Michigan baby 
formula plant were actually reported 
to the U.S. Department of Labor in 
February of 2021. Instead of addressing 
this crisis head-on, the Biden adminis-
tration squandered precious time. As a 
result, American families were unable 
to buy the formula that their infant 
children so desperately need. 
As a father, I think back on shopping 
for children’s formula for my own chil-
dren, and I am saddened by the thought 
of parents arriving today at the gro-
cery store and seeing empty shelf after 
empty shelf. 
The longer President Biden remains 
in office, one thing continues to be-
come clear: Americans cannot afford 
the failed leadership that has allowed 
this crisis and so many crises to con-
tinue. 
f 
SUPPORTING THE SECOND 
AMENDMENT 
(Mrs. MILLER of Illinois asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute.) 
Mrs. MILLER of Illinois. Madam 
Speaker, today is a historic day as the 
Supreme Court upheld the Second 
Amendment right to keep and bear 
arms. 
I thank President Trump for appoint-
ing Justices who defended the constitu-
tional rights of gun owners. 
It is unfortunate that at the same 
time the Supreme Court is upholding 
our Second Amendment rights, Con-
gress is working behind closed doors to 
push unconstitutional red flag gun con-
fiscation. 
I strongly oppose efforts by the 
House and Senate to infringe upon the 
Second Amendment rights of my con-
stituents, and I urge this body to reject 
the gun control legislation. 
f 
HONORING THE LEGACY OF THE 
MCGOVERN-DOLE FOOD FOR EDU-
CATION AND CHILDHOOD NUTRI-
TION PROGRAM 
(Mr. MANN asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. MANN. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor the legacy of the 
McGovern-Dole Food for Education and 
Childhood Nutrition Program, named 
in part after a Kansas legend, the late 
Senator Bob Dole. 
The McGovern-Dole program has pro-
vided 5.5 billion school meals bene-
fiting 31 million school-age children in 
48 countries over the last two decades, 
improving the food security, nutrition, 
literacy, and primary education of 
these children and their families. When 
schools closed due to COVID, the pro-
gram distributed 23,000 metric tons of 
commodities to more than 1.7 million 
children and their families. This pro-
gram is a success story of public-pri-
vate partnership. 
Representative MCGOVERN and I have 
a resolution before the House express-
ing this body’s commitment to build-
ing on the success of the McGovern- 
Dole 
program 
and 
supporting 
the 
American farmers, ranchers, and agri-
cultural producers who provide the 
commodities required for it to func-
tion. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to cosponsor this resolution, 
submit appropriation requests for fund-
ing, and ensure that this program can 
continue to support nutrition and edu-
cation for children around the world.

A GAS TAX HOLIDAY IS AN 
ELECTION-YEAR GIMMICK 
(Mr. ROSE asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. ROSE. Madam Speaker, Ten-
nesseans are fed up with prices at the 
pump. They are paying double what 
they were a year-and-a-half ago be-
cause of the attacks on American en-
ergy that began on day one of the 
Biden administration. Now, the Presi-
dent has asked Congress to consider a 
gas tax holiday. How curious. 
This is what Washington does when 
there is a big problem. Politicians pre-
tend they are looking out for you, but 
they are just looking out for their own 
poll numbers. 
Those 
aren’t 
my 
words, 
Madam 
Speaker. That is a quote from Presi-
dent 
Biden’s 
former 
boss, 
Barack 
Obama, on the campaign trail in 2008. 
He said a gas tax holiday would threat-
en Federal highways and possibly cost 
jobs while only saving families pennies 
a day. He called the idea an election- 
year gimmick, not a real solution. I 
agree. 
A real solution would be supporting 
policies that return our Nation to en-
ergy independence.

REMEMBERING DONALD WAYNE 
PORTER 
(Mr. ARRINGTON asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Mr. ARRINGTON. Madam Speaker, 
God’s Word says, To be absent from the 
body is to be present with the Lord. 
On June 21, 2022, after 76 years, Don-
ald Wayne Porter went home to be 
with his Lord. 
Despite a battle with Parkinson’s 
that may have overcome his body, it 
never conquered his spirit. 
Wayne Porter represents the very 
best of America, the epitome of west 
Texas, and a true cowboy spirit. 
He was a third generation cattle 
rancher, grocery store owner, deacon in 
the First Baptist Church, and a deco-
rated combat veteran of the Vietnam 
war. 
But his greatest legacy, Madam 
Speaker, was his fierce love and com-
mitment to his God and his family. 
Wayne had just celebrated 50 years 
with his beloved wife, Edith, and is sur-
vived by his 6 children and 11 grand-
children. 
His only son, John Porter, served as 
my chief of staff. 
While I didn’t know Wayne Porter, 
they say the apple doesn’t fall too far 
from the tree, so I felt like I knew the 
man. It was clear to me that Wayne 
Porter was a man of immense char-
acter, quiet strength, with a Texas- 
sized heart for God and people, the 
proudest of family men, and a patriot 
to his core. 
God has blessed America with men 
like Donald Wayne Porter, and may 
God continue to bless John, Madison, 
Duke, and the entire Porter family in 
their great loss but in heaven’s gain. 
Go west Texas.

KEEP KIDS FED ACT OF 2022 
Mr. 
SCOTT 
of 
Virginia. 
Madam 
Speaker, I move to suspend the rules 
and pass the bill (S. 2089) to amend

June 23, 2022 
all Members may have 5 legislative 
days in which to revise and extend 
their remarks and include extraneous 
material on S. 2089. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Virginia? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. 
SCOTT 
of 
Virginia. 
Madam 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
Madam Speaker, S. 2089 was amended 
to replace the language of that bill 
with the language of H.R. 8150, the bi-
partisan and bicameral Keep Kids Fed 
Act of 2022, in order to send the bill to 
the Senate for expedited passage. 
Roughly 2 years ago, our commu-
nities experienced an unprecedented 
surge in child hunger, spurred by the 
COVID–19 pandemic. Just weeks into 
the pandemic, more than one of every 
three households with children, and 
nearly half of all mothers with young 
children, struggled with food insecu-
rity. 
In response, Congress took decisive 
action to ensure that child nutrition 
programs, our best tools for addressing 
child hunger, could continue feeding 
hungry children during the pandemic. 
One of the most important steps we 
took was providing child nutrition pro-
grams with the flexibility they needed 
to expand access to school meals and 
address the challenges of serving stu-
dents who are not physically in the 
school buildings. 
This relief made a measurable dif-
ference in our fight against child hun-
ger. By expanding access to child nutri-
tion programs, we allowed an addi-
tional 10 million students to receive 
free school meals each day. From Janu-
ary 2021 to April 2021, food shortages 
among households with children fell by 
more than 40 percent. 
Regrettably, unless Congress acts, 
these key flexibilities would expire at 
the end of this month. 
The bipartisan and bicameral Keep 
Kids Fed Act of 2022 is likely our best 
and last opportunity to preserve relief 
for child nutrition programs. This leg-
islation would: 
Maintain school meal flexibilities 
that do not increase costs; 
Continue flexibilities to support sum-
mer food programs this year; 
Provide additional support for child 
and adult care feeding programs; and 
Increase school meal reimbursement 
rates for this upcoming school year. 
As we continue to recover from the 
pandemic, the Keep Kids Fed Act of 
2022 would take a critical step to sup-
port child nutrition programs and pre-
vent children from going hungry dur-
ing the ongoing public health emer-
gency. This is a step well worth taking. 
I thank the ranking member of the 
full committee, Dr. Foxx, and Senators 
STABENOW and BOOZMAN for working 
with me on this legislation. 
Madam Speaker, I urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote 
on the bill, and I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mrs. STEEL. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Madam Speaker, I am pleased to sup-
port this bipartisan legislation that 
will 
help 
ensure 
students 
receive 
healthy school meals. Students need 
access to nutritious meals so that they 
can be their best, both in and out of the 
classroom. Today’s bipartisan legisla-
tion does just that. 
During pandemic lockdowns, school 
food programs were critical to those in 
need. These programs play an impor-
tant role in non-pandemic times, too. 
It is important that we ensure this 
program is sustainable for schools, and 
that means responsible oversight and a 
return to regular order. 
We want to make sure that students 
who rely on school meals have access 
to them and that schools can continue 
to supply them, even in the face of sky-
rocketing, record-high inflation. 
As our constituents know, the price 
of just about everything has increased. 
The average family is spending $450 
more per month. Eggs are up 32 per-
cent, milk is up 16 percent, and bacon 
is up 15 percent. Our school meals pro-
grams are no exception to these rising 
costs. 
This measure will help schools cope 
with rising food prices by temporarily 
providing 
supplemental 
reimburse-
ments as these programs transition 
back to normal operations. 
I do think it is very important to em-
phasize that these increases are tem-
porary and will last 1 year. 
I appreciate the Democrats and the 
Senate for working with us to ensure 
these 
are 
temporary, 
supplemental 
funds to address inflation specifically. 
They are not an arbitrary increase in 
spending. Using the inflation crisis or 
the supply chain problem to increase 
Federal spending permanently would 
be especially unwise and irresponsible. 
I also am glad the legislation re-
quires USDA to provide school leaders 
and parents with support and guidance 
as the program transitions to normal 
operations. 
It is Congress’ job to ensure these 
programs are working as efficiently 
and effectively as possible. It is our 
duty to make sure these programs are 
fulfilling their intended purpose, which 
is to help students. 
I am happy to see this legislation put 
these school nutrition programs back 
on the right track. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to support this bill, and I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. 
SCOTT 
of 
Virginia. 
Madam 
Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentle-
woman from Minnesota (Ms. OMAR), a 
distinguished member of the Com-
mittee on Education and Labor and a 
leading advocate to reduce and elimi-
nate child hunger. 
b 1230 
Ms. OMAR. Madam Speaker, I thank 
the chairman for his leadership on this 
legislation and for working tirelessly 
to negotiate a solution. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today to ex-
press my support for the Keep Kids Fed 
Act. As food costs continue to soar, 
this critical legislation is a lifeline for 
millions of American families strug-
gling to make ends meet. 
In my home State of Minnesota, one 
in nine children are food insecure. This 
bipartisan legislation builds on my 
bill, the MEALS Act, to ensure chil-
dren continue to receive school meals 
this summer. I am proud to have been 
part of this fight. 
While I wish this agreement could 
have provided a permanent solution, 
this is a vital step to prevent millions 
of children from going hungry through-
out the next few months. In the mean-
time, I will continue to fight for the 
passage of my bill, the Universal 
School Meals Program Act, to ensure 
that no child in the richest country in 
the world goes hungry. 
Mrs. STEEL. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. 
SCOTT 
of 
Virginia. 
Madam 
Speaker, I yield 11⁄2 minutes to the gen-
tlewoman from North Carolina (Ms. 
ADAMS), a member of the Committee 
on Education and Labor and chair of 
the Subcommittee on Workforce Pro-
tections. 
Ms. 
ADAMS. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
I 
thank the gentleman for yielding. I 
rise today for the millions of children 
who will go hungry next week if Con-
gress does not extend child nutrition 
waivers. 
No student or child should ever go 
hungry in our country. At the start of 
the 
pandemic, 
Congress 
authorized 
waivers to help make it easier for 
schools to deliver meals to kids, and we 
gave 10 million more children access to 
healthy food. 
Given the reality of higher prices at 
the grocery store, children and their 
families can’t afford to lose the free, 
nutritious meals available at schools 
across the country. As a 40-year educa-
tor, I know hunger has been a crisis in 
our schools and our communities since 
long before the pandemic. 
Madam Speaker, one in seven house-
holds today has a child struggling with 
food insecurity. In my home State of 
North Carolina, food insecurity has 
been a tragic fact of life for our kids 
and our students. 
Before the pandemic, in North Caro-
lina, 92,000 students were participating 
in the Summer Food Service Program, 
and 441,000 children were receiving 
SNAP assistance. 
These numbers have only gone up. 
Our choice is clear: We can choose to 
act, or we can let millions of children 
go hungry. 
Madam Speaker, as always, I am 
standing with our students, and I urge 
all of my colleagues to support S. 2089, 
as amended. 
Mrs. STEEL. Madam Speaker, I yield 
2 minutes to the gentlewoman from 
North Carolina (Ms. FOXX), Republican 
leader of the Committee on Education 
and Labor. 
Ms. FOXX. Madam Speaker, I thank 
my colleague for yielding time. 
Madam Speaker, evidence is clear 
that students are able to focus more at

school if they are receiving adequate 
nutrition. Too many students are still 
suffering from the harmful effects of 
school closures, and we cannot afford 
to let students fall further behind. 
The rise in food prices is putting 
most Americans in a tight spot. The 
same is true for schools. The bipartisan 
Keep Kids Fed Act will empower 
schools to meet the crises our country 
is facing, from supply chain problems 
to record-high inflation. 
It is, however, extremely important 
to emphasize that the support provided 
in this legislation is both targeted and 
temporary, as all aid should be. We 
also worked hard to ensure that this 
legislation was budget-neutral so it 
does not put additional burden on tax-
payers. Importantly, this legislation 
will return our Nation’s school meal 
programs to regular order. This is the 
primary reason I support this legisla-
tion. 
For over 2 years, Democrats used a 
permanent pandemic narrative to in-
crease Federal spending across the 
board, including within school meal 
programs. This has fueled inflation. 
This is not only irresponsible but ig-
nores the narrow limits Congress pur-
posefully placed on these programs. 
Congress never intended to provide 
universal free breakfasts and lunches 
to all K–12 students regardless of need. 
By returning these programs back to 
normal, we can uphold our responsi-
bility to taxpayers and the principle 
that aid should be targeted and tem-
porary. 
The Keep Kids Fed Act offers a viable 
solution to the problems facing school 
meal programs while also refocusing 
these programs on their purpose: help-
ing students in need. 
Mr. 
SCOTT 
of 
Virginia. 
Madam 
Speaker, I yield 11⁄2 minutes to the gen-
tleman from Indiana (Mr. MRVAN), the 
distinguished member of the Com-
mittee on Education and Labor. 
Mr. MRVAN. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the chairman for yielding. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today in sup-
port of the Keep Kids Fed Act, which 
will aim to ensure our communities, 
schools, and daycares can provide 
healthy meals to children this summer. 
At a time when parents are strug-
gling to put food on the table and 
prices at the grocery store are at an 
all-time high, I am grateful for this bi-
cameral, bipartisan effort to address 
food insecurity. 
Throughout my career, I have fo-
cused on making sure to stay in touch. 
I had the opportunity to sit with over 
60 nutritionists for the school lunch 
programs, who had a sense of urgency 
and concern not about their jobs, but 
about the rising costs and their ability 
to make sure that young people, K–12, 
are able to have the meals in a dig-
nified matter, to be able to be educated 
and overcome obstacles, and to make 
sure that they were fed and ready for 
class. 
That being said, today, I thank 
Chairman SCOTT and all my colleagues 
for their example to solve this imme-
diate and pressing challenge, and I look 
forward to continuing to work with all 
of my colleagues to ensure that we cre-
ate the ideal environments that allow 
all students to learn and thrive.

SHARE OUR STRENGTH’S LISA DAVIS ON THE 
INTRODUCTION OF THE ‘KEEP KIDS FED’ ACT 
TO EXTEND CHILD NUTRITION WAIVERS 
WASHINGTON, DC.—This afternoon, leader-
ship from the Senate Committee on Agri-
culture, Nutrition and Forestry and the 
House Committee on Education and Labor 
announced an agreement to extend nation-
wide child nutrition waivers, which are set 
to expire on June 30. The Keep Kids Fed Act 
would extend some of these waivers through 
the 2022–2023 school year and provide school 
nutrition programs with additional funding 
to help address food price inflation and sup-
ply chain challenges. The following is a 
statement from No Kid Hungry Senior Vice 
President Lisa Davis: 
‘‘We are grateful that a deal has come to-
gether to help address the immense chal-
lenges facing schools and community organi-
zations working tirelessly to feed kids this 
summer and during the school year. This 
issue couldn’t be more urgent with waivers 
expiring in nine days and summer meals pro-
grams already up and running. 
‘‘Time is of the essence, especially for 
those operating summer meals sites without 
the certainty and flexibility of the waivers 
who will face difficulties turning on a dime. 
We know these waivers are needed and that 
they work. The reach of the summer meals 
program increased dramatically with them, 
doubling in 2021 and even tripling in 2020. 
‘‘While these waivers don’t solve supply 
chain issues, lower the rising cost of food 
and gas, or solve our nation’s inflation prob-
lem, they do help soften their impact on 
schools and community organizations and, 
ultimately, keep kids fed and nourished. 
‘‘As we know with legislation like this, 
there can be miles to go before it gets across 
the finish line. We urge Congress to move 
quickly on the Keep Kids Fed Act before na-
tionwide child nutrition waivers expire on 
June 30.’’ 
[From Luis Guardia, president, Food 
Research & Action Center (FRAC)] 
HUNGRY
CHILDREN
CAN’T
WAIT: CONGRESS 
MUST ACT QUICKLY TO PASS CRITICAL LEG-
ISLATION 
WASHINGTON, June 21, 2022.—FRAC com-
mends the bi-partisan legislation introduced 
today by Senate Agriculture Chairwoman 
Debbie Stabenow (D–MI), Ranking Member 
John Boozman (R–AR) and House Education 
and Labor Chairman Bobby Scott (D–VA) 
and Ranking Member Virginia Foxx (R–NC), 
to help support children, families, schools, 
and child care providers as they struggle to 
recover from the fallout of the pandemic. 
Provisions in the Keep Kids Fed Act would 
increase reimbursements to schools and 
child care, support access to summer meals 
by extending the summer waivers, allow 
children eligible for reduced-price school 
meals to receive free school meals, and 
streamline access to healthy meals for chil-
dren in family child care. 
We and our network of anti-hunger advo-
cates all across the country call on Congress 
to pass this legislation immediately as time 
is running out. The child nutrition waivers 
that have been available since the onset of 
the pandemic are set to expire on June 30. 
This legislation would help mitigate the im-
pact of the loss of the waivers and also would 
be critical to supporting children’s access to 
summer meals and meals at childcare. The 
provisions in the legislation are only tem-
porary and do not go as far as we would like, 
but they are a critical first step to help 
shield some of the impact of inflation, sup-
ply chain disruptions, and labor shortages. 
Still, more must be done. FRAC looks for-
ward to working with Congress to make 
much-needed, long-term improvements to 
the child nutrition programs to more fully 
address our nation’s hunger crisis. 
Hungry children can’t wait. 
Mr. 
SCOTT 
of 
Virginia. 
Madam 
Speaker, I am prepared to close, and I 
reserve the balance of my time. 
Mrs. STEEL. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself the balance of my time. 
Madam Speaker, the Keep Kids Fed 
Act is a bipartisan, budget-neutral bill 
that supports students and protects 
taxpayers. This bill will return our 
school nutrition programs back to nor-
mal, pre-pandemic operations. I appre-
ciate the majority working with us to 
ensure this is a true transition back to 
regular operation, which is fully paid 
for and includes a requirement to sup-
port parents and school leaders. 
This legislation will also support 
schools dealing with the supply chain 
and inflation crisis. This allows our 
Nation’s schools to focus on delivering 
healthy meals for students so they can 
focus on being successful in the class-
room. I am pleased we were able to 
come to a bicameral and bipartisan so-
lution, and I urge my colleagues to 
vote for the Keep Kids Fed Act. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. 
SCOTT 
of 
Virginia. 
Madam 
Speaker, I yield myself the balance of 
my time. 
Madam Speaker, as I said at the be-
ginning of the debate, the legislation 
before us is likely our last and best op-
portunity to protect millions of stu-
dents’ access to nutrition programs, 
which have been critical to feeding 
hungry children during the pandemic. 
The simple reality is that schools, 
children, and families are still dealing 
with the impacts of COVID–19. As 
school meal programs continue to en-
dure supply chain disruptions, infla-
tion, and other challenges, the Keep 
Kids Fed Act of 2022 would provide 
school meal programs that are ur-
gently needed for stability and will 
help continue providing students with 
nutritious meals that they need. 
We know this bill alone will not end 
all hunger in America, but it will be an 
important step to stand up for our Na-
tion’s children and fulfill our basic re-
sponsibility to keep them from going 
hungry. 
Again, I thank the ranking member 
of the committee, Dr. FOXX, and I 
thank the gentlewoman from Cali-
fornia, Mrs. STEEL, for helping to bring

this bipartisan, bicameral legislation 
to the floor. I also thank Senators STA-
BENOW and BOOZMAN for their work in 
bringing this legislation to reality. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to support S. 2089, as amended, 
and I yield back the balance of my 
time. 
Ms. DELAURO. Madam Speaker, I rise in 
support of the Keep Kids Fed Act, which pro-
vides vital funding to ensure our children are 
fed healthy meals over these next few sum-
mer months—and that schools and daycares 
are supported throughout the school year. 
As one of the wealthiest nations in the 
world, no child should go hungry. Yet far too 
many children struggle with hunger in this 
country. This is a tragedy. For more than 22 
million children who rely on school breakfast 
and lunch programs, summer vacation means 
worrying about when they will eat next. 
We all know that hunger can have lifelong 
consequences for children—making it more 
difficult to learn . . . play . . . and connect 
with kids their age. Kids who go hungry during 
summer often start school behind, which can 
lead to serious health concerns like develop-
mental delays . . . chronic illness . . . and 
mental health issues. They are at higher risk 
for anemia, asthma, diabetes—and more likely 
to experience anxiety and depression. 
So, I am pleased that we have reached a 
bipartisan agreement on extending school 
meal waivers until the summer’s end and con-
tinues to support schools and daycares 
throughout the year. These child nutrition 
waivers are a lifeline to schools, children, and 
hardworking families across the country. 
During the pandemic, school meals were a 
lifeline 
to 
students—providing 
them 
with 
healthy meals whether they were attending 
school in person or virtually. They have been 
a critical component of our nation’s response 
to this pandemic. But schools continue to face 
a variety of challenges, including supply chain 
disruptions, labor shortages, serving meals 
safely, and rising food prices. Waivers have 
been vital this school year to support school 
nutrition. And extending the waivers is the 
path forward to ensure all children have ac-
cess to nutritious school meals over the sum-
mer months that they need to learn and thrive. 
As I have said from the start—failure is not 
an option. And we need to get a deal across 
the finish line. It is our responsibility to ensure 
that our children do not go hungry. School 
meal waivers have given stability to hundreds 
of children who prior to this program, likely did 
not know where their next meal was coming 
from. 
I am disappointed that House Republicans 
insisted on an offset. We need to feed children 
in this country—and that should never be up 
for debate. 
With that, I am proud of this bill and the im-
pact I know it will have—providing school 
workers . . . parents . . . and caregivers with 
the security of knowing that the children they 
care for will be fed through the summer. 
So, I am voting in favor of this critical legis-
lation—and I urge my colleagues to do the 
same. 
Ms. MOORE of Wisconsin. Madam Speak-
er, I rise in strong support of the Keep Kids 
Fed Act. 
I want to thank Chairman SCOTT for his 
steadfast leadership and determination to work 
to get something worked out to help ensure 
that our school meals are available to as 
many of our students as possible. 
The school meals provisions were an effec-
tive response by this Congress to the COVID– 
19 pandemic. Schools, children and families 
were disrupted as this deadly disease raced 
through our country. Congress acted to make 
sure that we provided flexibility to ensure that 
no child would miss a meal that they would 
otherwise have received in school. 
Why is that important? Because Congress 
has long recognized that hunger and learning 
do not mix well, if at all. This isn’t some theo-
retical or academic debate. I know what its 
like to be hungry and in school. And I am sad-
dened that decades after I went through that 
experience as a student, many other children 
still must deal with that reality each and every 
school day. 
Food is not a luxury. So hearing that the 
USDA COVID waivers that had allowed mil-
lions of kids to stay nourished were expiring 
was an emergency for me. And I know the 
Chairman shares that sentiment. 
Frankly, it has been hard to sleep thinking 
of what happens in communities like Mil-
waukee when families find this lifeline cut off 
arbitrarily even while the pandemic that 
spawned these provisions, continues. 
The reality is that hunger and food insecu-
rity did not take a break during this pandemic. 
In fact, reports indicate it got worse. Hunger 
doesn’t take a summer vacation even though 
our schools do. 
It shouldn’t have taken all of this to get us 
to agree on this: Feed our kids so they can 
concentrate on learning and being kids. These 
waivers have done a great deal to help us 
achieve that and I hope we can continue to 
work to ensure that we can take the great les-
sons learned about how to effectively reach 
and nourish school children during this pan-
demic and use them to put in place permanent 
provisions that will ensure that all of our chil-
dren can go to school and focus on their edu-
cation 
That includes taking up and passing bills 
like the Universal School Meals Program Act 
which I have joined with Rep. OMAR in intro-
ducing that would provide the most cost-effec-
tive and inclusive model for ensuring all stu-
dents have access to nutritious meals during 
the school day without facing barriers such as 
stigma or burdensome paperwork. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, I am 
proud to rise in strong support of the House 
Amendment to S. 2089, the ‘‘Keep Kids Fed 
Act of 2022.’’ 
Today’s bill is a matter of urgency. 
If Congress does not act now to pass this 
emergency legislation, millions of children will 
spend their summer hungry. Millions of chil-
dren may be forced to spend their school days 
not learning and growing but feeling the pangs 
of empty stomachs. 
Hungry children cannot focus their attention 
on their studies and learning. They simply 
cannot thrive while trying to survive. 
Free and reduced breakfast and lunch waiv-
ers are lifelines for families across the nation. 
I think of the struggling families in my district 
who have battled against the COVID–19 pan-
demic for the past two years. 
Families who now face record high inflation 
rates, skyrocketing gas prices, and the rising 
cost of food. 
Families who are stretching dollars to pay 
for rent, to get to the doctor, to keep the lights 
on. 
Families for whom every penny counts. 
I think of how these families must have felt 
when they learned that the aid on which they 
had relied to feed their children was suddenly 
going to be taken away. 
I imagine they felt helpless. 
It is in our power to feed these children. 
The ‘‘Keep Kids Fed Act of 2022’’ would 
allow schools to feed children throughout the 
upcoming school year. This bill would extend 
free meals and snacks for children during the 
summer months, and it would provide en-
hanced supports to Child and Adult Care pro-
grams—all without disrupting the budget. 
In the summer of 2020, hungry children 
were provided with more than 10 million meals 
via the federally supported Summer Meal Pro-
gram. 
195,000 children were fed. 
195,000 children were given apples, sand-
wiches, yogurts, juice boxes. 
They were given the opportunity to enjoy a 
summer free of hunger. 
That is reason enough to act. 
The ‘‘Keep Kids Fed Act’’ would also in-
crease reimbursements to school nutrition pro-
grams for both breakfast and lunch meals. 
American families are not the only ones 
struggling to put food on the table amidst the 
current economic crisis. 
School nutrition professionals have ex-
pressed deep concern over the impacts that 
supply-chain issues and inflation have had on 
their ability to provide quality meals to their 
students. 
With the end of pandemic-relief nutritional 
aid fast approaching, and the cost of labor ris-
ing, some schools could see their yearly budg-
ets decrease by 40 percent this year. 
School cafeterias cannot produce meals out 
of thin air. 
They need our help. 
The House Amendment to S. 2089 would 
increase the reimbursement rates for the 
2022–2023 school year by an additional 15 
cents per breakfast and 40 cents per lunch— 
money that our nation’s schools desperately 
need. 
This bill would not fix the inflation problem, 
lower the cost of gas, or unclog the supply 
chain. But it would put food on the plates of 
hungry children across America. 
That is why I rise in support of the House 
Amendment to S. 2089, the ‘‘Keep Kids Fed 
Act’’ and urge my colleagues to do the same. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from Virginia (Mr.

tleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. KEL-
LER) each will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from Virginia. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. 
SCOTT 
of 
Virginia. 
Madam 
Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that 
all Members have 5 legislative days in 
which to revise and extend their re-
marks and include extraneous material 
on the measure under consideration. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Virginia? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. 
SCOTT 
of 
Virginia. 
Madam 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
Madam Speaker, over the last 2 
years, our Nation’s college students 
have grappled with a mental health cri-
sis that was significantly worsened by 
the COVID–19 pandemic. A national 
survey last year found that 65 percent 
of students reported having poor or 
only fair mental health. And according 
to the CDC, suicide attempts amongst 
females aged 15 to 23 increased by 87 
percent from 2007 through 2020. 
The surging mental health needs of 
students on college campuses have fur-
ther strained campus-based mental 
health care providers. Since the start 
of the pandemic, campus counseling 
centers have been forced to respond to 
an increased demand for services with-
out the funding, staffing, and resources 
that they need. 
Regrettably, insufficient access to 
mental health care during the pan-
demic 
has 
exacerbated 
preexisting 
mental health inequities. A 2015 survey 
indicated that students of color are sig-
nificantly less likely to be diagnosed or 
treated for mental health conditions 
than White students. The gaps between 
the increased mental health needs of 
students and the limited capacity of in-
stitutions to address them demand ur-
gent action. 
In response to this crisis, the gentle-
woman from Pennsylvania (Ms. WILD), 
along with the gentleman from Penn-
sylvania (Mr. KELLER), introduced a 
bill, Enhancing Mental Health and Sui-
cide Prevention Through Campus Plan-
ning Act. 
This bill will help institutions of 
higher education develop comprehen-
sive mental health and suicide preven-
tion plans to better support mental 
health needs of college students. 
Specifically, the legislation directs 
the Department of Education to build 
on existing mental health programs to 
create evidence-based approaches to 
suicide prevention and mental health 
care. And it would encourage the De-
partment to collaborate with State 
agencies, nonprofit organizations, and 
stakeholders to help ensure that these 
programs fully meet the needs of stu-
dents. 
b 1245 
In other words, the Enhancing Men-
tal Health and Suicide Prevention 
Through Campus Planning Act is a 
critical opportunity for each of us to 
stand up for the healthcare needs of 
our Nation’s students and ensure that 
we care for their well-being. 
I thank Ms. WILD and Mr. KELLER for 
their work on this critical priority, and 
I urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote on this bill. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. KELLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Today, I rise in strong support of 
H.R. 5407, the bipartisan Enhancing 
Mental Health and Suicide Prevention 
Through Campus Planning Act. 
The mental health of our Nation’s 
students is on the minds of many 
Americans. According to a study by 
Boston 
University, 
mental 
health 
issues increased steadily over the past 
8 years among college students. In fact, 
60 percent of students met the criteria 
for at least one mental health problem, 
including increased rates of anxiety, 
depression, and thoughts of suicide. 
According to the Centers for Disease 
Control and Prevention, approximately 
25 percent of 18-to-24-year-olds sur-
veyed in 2020 had seriously considered 
suicide. Unfortunately, these issues 
were made only worse by the pandemic. 
Clearly, something needs to be done. 
That is why I joined my Pennsyl-
vania colleague, Representative WILD, 
in introducing H.R. 5407. This legisla-
tion will encourage institutions of 
higher 
education 
to 
develop 
com-
prehensive mental health and suicide 
prevention plans to support college 
students. 
H.R. 5407 directs the Secretary of 
Education to encourage institutions of 
higher education to develop and imple-
ment comprehensive campus mental 
health and suicide prevention plans. 
The bill also directs the Department of 
Education 
and 
the 
Department 
of 
Health and Human Services to work to-
gether in a way that will allow the in-
stitutions to draw from existing evi-
dence-based approaches and programs 
enacted by the 21st Century Cures Act, 
the Garrett Lee Smith Memorial Act, 
and the Suicide Prevention Resource 
Center, as well as other existing Fed-
eral and State programs. 
We all want to see our Nation’s stu-
dents thrive and succeed. Yet, many 
students are battling severe depression 
and contemplating suicide. We must all 
come together to prevent such tragedy. 
The best way to do this is to ensure 
that students know safe resources are 
nearby, so they can get the mental 
health support they need. 
It is time to break down barriers to 
mental health access. This means 
breaking down the stigmas and the 
practical barriers associated with seek-
ing mental health services. That is 
what this bill seeks to do. 
Madam Speaker, I encourage my col-
leagues to vote for H.R. 5407, and I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. 
SCOTT 
of 
Virginia. 
Madam 
Speaker, I yield such time as she may 
consume to the gentlewoman from 
Pennsylvania (Ms. WILD), the sponsor 
of this legislation. 
Ms. WILD. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to speak about this bipartisan

bill, H.R. 5407, the Enhancing Mental 
Health 
and 
Suicide 
Prevention 
Through Campus Planning Act, which 
will be taken up for consideration 
today. 
Supporting the young people of our 
country is not a partisan issue. I thank 
the co-lead of this bill, Representative 
FRED KELLER, and the original cospon-
sors, 
Representatives 
FITZPATRICK, 
RASKIN, 
STEVENS, 
TRONE, 
SCANLON, 
MOULTON, GRIJALVA, ROYBAL-ALLARD, 
DEAN, HARDER, and DESAULNIER
for 
their support. 
In the last several years, young 
Americans have faced unprecedented 
challenges resulting in a rise in mental 
health needs. College campus coun-
seling centers have been tasked with 
responding to this increased demand 
for mental health services with limited 
staff, funding, and resources. 
The mental health effects of the pan-
demic are widespread, with a study 
conducted by Pennsylvania State Uni-
versity reporting that 94 percent of 
students seeking mental health serv-
ices said that COVID–19 negatively im-
pacted at least one area of their life 
and 72 percent reporting that the 
pandemic’s main impact has been on 
their mental health. 
To help institutions of higher edu-
cation better serve students, once 
passed, this bill will encourage colleges 
and universities to develop and imple-
ment mental health programs in con-
cert with both State-level programs 
and community-based organizations. 
During my visits to colleges in the 
Lehigh Valley of Pennsylvania, even 
before the pandemic, students shared 
with me the importance of improving 
mental health care access on campus. 
Today, I am proud that the Enhanc-
ing Mental Health and Suicide Preven-
tion Through Campus Planning Act 
will receive a vote, and I look forward 
to casting mine in support. 
Mr. KELLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself the balance of my time. 
In closing, I want to discuss the im-
portance of what we are doing. COVID– 
19 burdened young people with more 
anxiety, stress, and isolation than ever 
before. Now, they need support that 
works. 
According 
to 
one 
study, 
mental 
health problems among young adults 
rose 50 percent over the past 10 years. 
Many of us have seen the young people 
in our lives struggling, and it is dev-
astating to watch. 
I am dedicated to serving the needs 
of students nationwide. To me, this bill 
is a no-brainer. 
Empowering postsecondary institu-
tions to develop comprehensive suicide 
prevention plans and partner with com-
munity-based mental health organiza-
tions will do much to solve this mental 
health crisis. This critical investment 
in the mental health of our young peo-
ple is an investment in the future of 
this country. 
Lastly, I express my gratitude to my 
colleagues on both sides of the aisle for 
working together on this important 
legislation. 
Madam Speaker, I encourage all of 
my colleagues to vote ‘‘yes’’ on H.R. 
5407, and I yield back the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. 
SCOTT 
of 
Virginia. 
Madam 
Speaker, I yield myself the balance of 
my time. 
Madam Speaker, the evidence is clear 
that our Nation’s students are con-
tinuing to grapple with an ongoing 
mental health crisis. Even as we con-
tinue to recover from COVID–19, we are 
still seeing far too many students suf-
fer from depression, anxiety, and stress 
without the support and services they 
need to get back on their feet. 
Madam Speaker, students in this 
country should not have to grapple 
with serious mental health challenges 
on their own. However, we cannot ex-
pect campus mental health care pro-
viders to support students if we do not 
support them with the resources that 
they need. 
The Enhancing Mental Health and 
Suicide Prevention Through Campus 
Planning Act is legislation that we 
need to help ensure that our institu-
tions of higher education are equipped 
to support students’ mental health, 
both during the pandemic and into the 
future. 
I, again, thank the gentlewoman 
from Pennsylvania (Ms. WILD) and the 
gentleman 
from 
Pennsylvania 
(Mr. 
KELLER) for their leadership and co-
operation on this bill. 
Madam Speaker, I urge all of my col-
leagues to support this legislation, and 
I yield back the balance of my time. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today in support of H.R. 5407—to amend the 
‘‘Higher Education Act of 1965’’ to promote 
comprehensive campus mental health and sui-
cide prevention plans within the Higher Edu-
cation Act of 1965. 
The mental health crisis plaguing our Nation 
is astounding. Particularly in our Nation’s insti-
tutions of higher education, we see higher re-
ported rates of anxiety and depression, which 
have unfortunately led some students to sui-
cide. 
According to studies done in the year 2020, 
suicide was the 12th leading cause of death 
within the Unites States. Within this year, 
45,979 Americans died by suicide, and an es-
timated 1.2 million Americans attempted sui-
cide. 
Within the reported suicide rates of 2020, 
people ranging from ages 15–34 made up 
32.59 percent of the total. 
The COVID–19 pandemic exacerbated the 
mental health crisis showing a 25 percent in-
crease in the number of depression and anx-
iety cases recorded globally. 
In my home state of Texas 34.2 percent of 
adults reported symptoms of anxiety and de-
pression between September 29, 2021, and 
October 11, 2021. 
The transition period into institutions of high-
er education can be difficult for numerous rea-
sons. Some of the leading triggers for anxiety 
and depression are the constant pressure for 
success, homesickness, adjustment to work-
load, or even the social aspects of the colle-
giate environment. 
No matter the cause, it is our job as elected 
officials of the United States to ensure that we 
are putting our time and resources into ensur-
ing that we are providing outlets for those 
struggling with mental health issues to seek 
refuge. 
I want to be very clear when I say that pro-
viding these resources alone will not ensure 
that zero lives are taken at the hands of men-
tal health struggles. 
However, taking the steps to ensure that 
there are proper resources and parameters in 
place on the campuses of our college cam-
puses will aid in helping our young adults re-
ceive the assistance they need to lead healthy 
lives. 
We cannot sit idly as our Nation stares 
down the barrel of an all-time low for mental 
health. 
By invoking comprehensive mental health 
and suicide prevention plans across higher 
education institutions, we are pouring into our 
next generations. 
H.R. 5407 allows for collegiate institutions to 
draw on the expertise and resources provided 
by the Suicide Prevention Centers nine strat-
egy model, while also working with the Sec-
retary of Health and Human Services to create 
a comprehensive approach to mental health 
concerns and suicide prevention. 
This mental health assistance model will 
allow for all institutions throughout the Nation 
to collectively pool together and ensure each 
campus is administering the highest level of 
care for students with mental health struggles. 
I urge for each of my colleagues to vote in 
support of H.R. 5407 to help us get our col-
lege students across the stage. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. 
SCOTT) that the House suspend the

GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. 
SCOTT 
of 
Virginia. 
Madam 
Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that 
all Members may have 5 legislative 
days in which to revise and extend 
their remarks and include extraneous 
material on the measure under consid-
eration. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Virginia? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. 
SCOTT 
of 
Virginia. 
Madam 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
Madam Speaker, across the country, 
students on college campuses are fac-
ing an increased incidence of substance 
misuse. 
Even before the pandemic, there was 
a rising demand for substance preven-
tion and recovery programs on cam-
puses. Unfortunately, the pandemic has 
only exacerbated the mental health 
and student well-being crisis. 
In fact, as a result of the COVID–19 
pandemic, a study found that 89 per-
cent of college students experienced in-
creased anxiety, and one in four stu-
dents surveyed said their depression 
significantly increased. 
College-aged students misuse sub-
stances more than any other age group. 
In a lot of cases, substance misuse in 
college can lead to lower academic per-
formance 
and 
unemployment 
after 
graduation. Tragically, in the worst 
cases, substance misuse can lead to ill-
ness and death. 
That is why the gentlewoman from 
New Mexico (Ms. LEGER FERNANDEZ) 
acted and introduced the bipartisan 
Campus Prevention and Recovery Serv-
ices for Students Act. 
This bill brings together the Depart-
ments of Education and Health and 
Human Services to encourage institu-
tions to develop evidence-based sub-
stance misuse prevention and recovery 
programs for students with substance 
use disorders. 
This bill also encourages institutions 
to holistically address substance use 
and mental health concerns. Impor-
tantly, it reauthorizes grants to help 
institutions carry out these efforts. 
Madam Speaker, if we want to tackle 
the mental health crisis head-on and 
help our students reach their full po-
tential, then we must invest in their 
well-being. This legislation will help 
deliver on that goal. 
I thank the gentlewoman from New 
Mexico for leading this effort, and I 
urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote on this bill. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. KELLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
I stand today in support of H.R. 6493, 
the bipartisan Campus Prevention and 
Recovery Services for Students Act of 
2022. 
Sadly, college students were not ex-
empt from the tremendous pressure 
brought by the COVID–19 pandemic. 
For many students, these escalating

June 23, 2022 
pressures have resulted in behavioral 
and mental health challenges, such as 
substance abuse. 
Even before the pandemic, studies 
found that young adults were turning 
to dangerous substances as 18-to-25- 
year-olds were reported to have the 
highest percent of opioid use of all age 
groups. 
This is why I am proud to join my 
colleagues in support of this bill today. 
H.R. 6493 promotes evidence-based 
prevention and recovery efforts on col-
lege campuses by providing colleges 
and universities the tools they need to 
support students struggling with sub-
stance abuse. 
Specifically, this bill requires insti-
tutions of higher education that re-
ceive Federal funding to adopt an evi-
dence-based program to prevent alco-
hol and substance misuse by both stu-
dents and employees. The bill also en-
sures 
that 
the 
institutions 
are 
equipped with proven, evidence-based 
methods by directing the Secretary of 
Education to coordinate with the Sec-
retary of Health and Human Services 
to develop best practices for colleges 
and universities when implementing 
substance abuse programs. Such co-
ordination and cooperation are crucial. 
For those colleges and universities 
that may need additional help for stu-
dent recovery services, the bill updates 
an existing Federal grant for these 
uses. We know that colleges and uni-
versity staff can serve as a critical sup-
port system for students suffering from 
an addiction or mental health issue. 
This bill will also empower staff to do 
so. 
With college students experiencing 
increased loneliness, isolation, and de-
pression, it is important that these 
students have access to alcohol and 
substance misuse prevention programs. 
H.R. 6493 will keep students from 
falling into substance abuse, thus en-
suring they start their future out on 
the right foot and on a path to a suc-
cessful career. I urge my colleagues to 
support this bill today. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
b 1300 
Mr. 
SCOTT 
of 
Virginia. 
Madam 
Speaker, I yield such time as she may 
consume to the gentlewoman from New 
Mexico (Ms. LEGER FERNANDEZ), who is 
the sponsor of the legislation. 
Ms. LEGER FERNANDEZ. Madam 
Speaker, I thank Chairman SCOTT and 
Ranking Member KELLER
from the 
State of Pennsylvania for their support 
of this much-needed legislation. 
Alcohol and substance misuse is a 
devastating issue across the country 
and on college campuses. It steals the 
dreams and futures of too many of our 
community. 
I lost two brothers to addiction—al-
cohol and drug misuse. That misuse 
began during their time in college. My 
family has never recovered from the 
loss of those two beautiful brothers of 
mine, and I understand all too well the 
pain substance misuse inflicts on stu-
dents, their families, and their commu-
nities. Sadly, my family’s story is not 
unique in New Mexico or across this 
country. 
Since the start of the pandemic, 
States have reported increased num-
bers of drug overdoses. Campuses have 
reported increased mental health con-
cerns in students as well. College stu-
dents who deal with substance misuse 
and addiction often find themselves 
isolated and without a support net-
work. 
Congress has an opportunity to ad-
dress this serious issue by making sure 
that colleges and universities support 
students through strong prevention 
and recovery programs. I don’t want to 
see another headline or obituary of a 
promising young person lost to over-
dose. 
That is why I introduced the bipar-
tisan Campus Prevention and Recovery 
Services for Students Act along with 
Representatives DUSTY JOHNSON, LUCY 
MCBATH, JOHN
JOYCE, and MICHAEL 
GUEST. I would also like to acknowl-
edge Representative DAVID TRONE who 
is co-chair of the Bipartisan Mental 
Health and Addiction Task Force of 
which I am also a member. He led this 
bill during last Congress. 
Our bill will help to cut the chains of 
addiction and unlock access to treat-
ment and prevention for countless stu-
dents across the United States. Specifi-
cally, it will reauthorize the drug and 
alcohol abuse prevention provision of 
the Higher Education Act to promote 
evidence-based prevention and inter-
vention strategies on college campuses. 
I have met with college students across 
my district to hear from them what is 
needed. What is needed is what is in 
this bill. 
It encourages campus collaboration 
and service integration to address sub-
stance use and mental health concerns 
in a holistic manner. The bill also au-
thorizes $15 million to implement those 
grants for fiscal year 2023 and the 5 fol-
lowing years. 
I was pleased to see my bill pass 
unanimously during its markup in the 
Education and Labor Committee. I 
thank Chairman SCOTT and his staff for 
working to get this bill to the House 
floor. 
Madam Speaker, I urge all my col-
leagues to vote ‘‘yes’’ on H.R. 6493 and 
to vote ‘‘yes’’ in support of our stu-
dents. 
Mr. KELLER. Madam Speaker, I 
have no further speakers, I am pre-
pared to close, and I yield myself the 
balance of my time. 
Through this commonsense bipar-
tisan legislation, we will support insti-
tutions of higher education in their 
work to address the health and well- 
being of students and employees. 
The isolation brought on by the pan-
demic exacerbated the mental health 
challenges students in this country 
were already facing. Data shows that 
substance abuse is a serious problem on 
college campuses. Some students may 
feel anxious about pursuing a degree in 
higher education and moving away 
from home for the first time, the chal-
lenges surrounding the pandemic have 
exacerbated those feelings. 
Current and future generations of 
college students will be well-served 
with access to high-quality mental 
health and substance abuse disorder 
treatment services. The best thing 
postsecondary institutions can do is 
give students tools to handle those 
pressures in a healthy way. 
Today, I am honored to stand in sup-
port of this legislation, H.R. 6493, as I 
believe it will give vulnerable students 
the assistance they desperately need. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. 
SCOTT 
of 
Virginia. 
Madam 
Speaker, I yield myself the balance of 
my time. 
Madam Speaker, as lawmakers, we 
have an opportunity to make a dif-
ference in students’ lives and protect 
their health, including their mental 
health. The benefits of doing so are 
clear. Students with higher rates of 
well-being have higher GPAs and are 
more likely to graduate and be engaged 
in 
our 
community. 
Unfortunately, 
mental health issues and substance 
misuse are rising, and that is a concern 
for our college campuses. 
The Campus Prevention and Recov-
ery Services for Students Act will pro-
vide both guidance and funding to help 
make sure that students have the tools 
that they need to reach their full po-
tential. 
Again, I thank the chief sponsor of 
the bill, Ms. LEGER FERNANDEZ; the 
lead cosponsor of the bill, the gen-
tleman from South Dakota (Mr. JOHN-
SON); and Mr. KELLER for their leader-
ship on this important bill. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to support H.R. 6493, and I yield 
back the balance of my time. 
Mrs. MILLER-MEEKS. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today in support of H.R. 6493, the Cam-
pus Prevention and Recovery Services for 
Students Act. As we are coming out of a two- 
year pandemic, taking care of individuals with 
mental health and substance use disorders, 
especially college students, is crucial. 
H.R. 6493, requires schools to develop evi-
dence-based prevention and intervention strat-
egies for college students and employees. 
H.R. 6493 requires both the Department of 
Education and the Department of Health and 
Human Services to identify and promote suc-
cessful programs. 
As a physician and former Iowa Director of 
Public Health, I know just how critical evi-
dence-based practices are for prevention of al-
cohol and substance use disorders and how 
life saving these practices can be for any stu-
dent. It is equally important for college cam-
puses and the medical community to come to-
gether to do what is best for our nation’s stu-
dents. 
I look forward to voting in support of H.R. 
6493 and urge my colleagues to do the same. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today in support of H.R. 6493—to amend the 
‘‘Campus Prevention and Recovery Services 
for Students Act of 2022’’ to promote sub-
stance misuse treatment rehabilitation and re- 
entry within institutions of higher education.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5845 
June 23, 2022 
Today substance misuse targets our nation 
at a volatile rate. Specifically, when looking at 
our institutions of higher education our stu-
dents are much more susceptible to being vic-
tims of substance misuse. 
Common triggers for substance misuse in-
clude peer pressure, stress, social organiza-
tion, and mental health issues. 
Currently the ‘‘Campus Prevention and Re-
covery Services for Students Act of 2022’’, 
seeks to ensure that our public institutions are 
using funding given to them to provide the 
necessary outlets for recovery and re-entry 
into campus life. 
Solutions the original bill provides include 
models for ‘‘prevention of the use of illicit 
drugs and the abuse of alcohol’’ by students 
and staff through connecting them with cam-
pus intervention, and rehabilitation resources. 
As it stands the bill targets many of the nec-
essary areas it needs to promote rehabilitation 
of substance abuse, but what it fails to do is 
provide the necessary funding allocations in 
ongoing to ensure the longevity of keeping our 
students safe. 
Students who are struggling with substance 
misuse issues deserve to know that they are 
receiving the best possible care that they can, 
and we can foster that by making sure that 
our institutions of higher education have the 
resources they desperately need to be able 
continue to serve their student populations. 
Through H.R. 6493 it will further push cam-
puses to ensure that they are working with or-
ganizations both on and off campus. 
Campuses will now be required to work with 
the Secretary of Education in conjunction with 
the Secretary of Health and Human Services 
to ensure that each campus is using their 
funding for the highest quality of rehabilitation 
and re-entry services. 
H.R. 6493 will grant $15 million to institu-
tions annually from to 2021–2028 to aid in 
funding public institutions’ recovery, rehabilita-
tion, and re-entry programs. 
I ask that my colleagues join me in support 
of H.R. 6493—the Campus Prevention and 
Recovery Services for Students Act of 2022. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. 
SCOTT) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 6493, as 
amended. 
The question was taken. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the 
opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being 
in the affirmative, the ayes have it. 
Mr. GOOD of Virginia. Madam Speak-
er, on that I demand the yeas and nays. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to section 3(s) of House Resolution 
8, the yeas and nays are ordered. 
Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, fur-
ther proceedings on this motion are

all Members may have 5 legislative 
days in which to revise and extend 
their remarks and to insert extraneous 
material on H.R. 6411, as amended. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. LEVIN of California. Madam 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today in sup-
port of H.R. 6411, as amended, the Sup-
port The Resilience of Our Nation’s 
Great Veterans Act, or STRONG Vet-
erans Act. 
Chairman TAKANO
introduced this 
bill with Ranking Member BOST, and 
we are grateful to them and their staff 
for 
working 
together 
over 
many 
months to bring this vital package to 
the House floor. This represents a true 
bipartisan effort to address a pressing 
issue. 
Although we all were glad to see the 
veteran suicide rate drop in the last 
year for which we have data, one death 
is one too many, and suicide is prevent-
able. We must honor our veterans’ 
service by getting them the care they 
have earned and deserve now. 
Preventing 
veteran 
suicide 
and 
strengthening veterans’ mental health 
and well-being remains a top priority 
not only of the Biden administration 
and the Department of Veterans Af-
fairs but also of our committee. There 
are prevention approaches and treat-
ments that work, and we must expand 
all veterans’ access to these lifesaving 
and life-improving services. 
Madam Speaker, while we are talk-
ing about access, I want to make sure 
everyone listening today has the Vet-
erans Crisis Line phone number. If you 
or somebody you care about is in dis-
tress, call 1–800–273–TALK—that is 1– 
800–273–8255—and press 1 for responders 
with military and veteran expertise. 
There is no reason to suffer alone. 
Along with our colleagues in the Sen-
ate, we have advanced bipartisan bills 
over the past year that now make up 
the 22 sections of the STRONG Vet-
erans Act. 
I want to especially thank our col-
leagues both on and off the committee 
for their individual legislative con-
tributions to this omnibus package. 
Congresswoman 
BROWNLEY, 
who 
chairs our Veterans’ Affairs Health 
Subcommittee, introduced what we 
consider a cornerstone of STRONG— 
her American Indian and Alaska Na-
tive Veterans Mental Health Act. This 
provision mandates that VA hire full- 
time minority veteran coordinators at 
every VA medical center to provide 
culturally competent mental health 
and suicide prevention outreach to our 
Tribal veterans. 
Congresswoman 
SLOTKIN’s 
Solid 
Start Act is included in STRONG and 
will ensure that VA continues to con-
tact and check in with veterans fol-
lowing their transition from Active 
Duty during what we know is a very 
high-risk 
time 
for 
stress, 
mental 
health challenges, and even suicide. 
The committee also was pleased to 
include the Veteran Peer Specialist 
Act from Congressman SCOTT PETERS. 
This is an important provision direct-
ing VA to expand its peer specialist 
program which is extremely popular 
with veterans. 
Although our colleague, former Con-
gressman Delgado, recently left the 
House to become Lieutenant Governor 
of New York, I thank him for intro-
ducing the REACH for Veterans Act in 
the House. It is a critical component of 
STRONG and will strengthen VA’s Vet-
erans Crisis Line. 
Finally, Chairman TAKANO’s bill in 
STRONG, the VA Governor’s Challenge 
Expansion Act, mandates, for the first 
time, VA-included Tribes in addition to 
States in the successful Governors’ 
Challenge program to prevent veteran 
suicide. No sovereign nation should 
have to wait to be invited to a State 
Governor’s Challenge team. Instead, 
Tribes selected for the program will 
work directly with VA to tailor inno-
vative suicide prevention ideas to the 
needs of their own Native veterans. 
Overall, STRONG will give VA im-
portant new authorities and resources 
to support veterans’ mental health and 
well-being through increased training, 
outreach, mental health care delivery, 
and research in line with the commit-
tee’s public health approach and Presi-
dent Biden’s strategy to address vet-
eran suicide. 
It addresses gaps along the spectrum 
of prevention and care by expanding 
mental health outreach to tradition-
ally underserved veterans, developing 
and delivering the most effective treat-
ments, better equipping VA’s work-
force to provide care, and further 
strengthening VA’s crisis response sys-
tem.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5852 
June 23, 2022 
With this legislation, we will help VA 
better meet veterans where they are— 
literally. STRONG directs VA to hire 
more mental health staff at vet centers 
close to where veterans live and work. 
STRONG also directs VA to assess 
and improve how well it serves vet-
erans on college campuses. It requires 
VA to more consistently and com-
prehensively reach out and provide 
mental health services to veterans who 
have been involved with the criminal 
justice system. 
STRONG mandates that as the new 
three-digit crisis hotline number goes 
live across the country in July, VA fur-
ther strengthen its Veterans Crisis 
Line to meet the predicted surge in de-
mand for emergency care and followup. 
STRONG lays out important guid-
ance for VA’s research program related 
to suicide, substance use challenges, 
and other mental health issues. While 
caring for veterans today, VA must al-
ways be investing in science and look-
ing for tomorrow’s innovative solu-
tions to improve veterans’ lives. 
STRONG and its component bills are 
endorsed by too many veterans service 
organizations and health organizations 
to list, but, Madam Speaker, let me 
leave you with these words from An-
drew Marshall, National Commander of 
Disabled American Veterans, ‘‘There is 
simply no greater or more urgent chal-
lenge within the veteran community 
right now than addressing mental 
health concerns and ensuring our Na-
tion’s heroes have access to the sup-
port they need to both prevent and 
mitigate crisis. 
‘‘DAV is pleased to support the 
STRONG Veterans Act, and we urge its 
swift passage and signing into law.’’ 
In closing, Madam Speaker, Chair-
man TAKANO and I support this impor-
tant piece of legislation, and we urge 
our colleagues to support H.R. 6411, as 
amended. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. BOST. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today in sup-
port of H.R. 6411, as amended, the Sup-
port The Resiliency of Our Nation’s 
Great, STRONG, Veterans Act. 
This bill would improve VA’s mental 
health and suicide prevention strate-
gies by doing a number of things. It 
would expand the Vet Center work-
force, and it would also allow student 
veterans the opportunity to seek coun-
seling at Vet Centers during what can 
be yet another stressful time in that 
period of transitioning into civilian 
life. 
b 1315 
Additionally, the bill would allow 
family members of veterans who died 
by suicide to seek bereavement coun-
seling at Vet Centers. This support, 
from counselors who know veterans 
and the challenges that their families 
often face, would be a valuable re-
source for those in mourning. 
This bill would expand training, 
scholarship, and loan repayment pro-
grams for the VA mental health pro-
viders. It would direct a series of ac-
tions to improve the Veterans Crisis 
Line, including enhanced training and 
oversight. It would codify an existing 
VA program that reaches out to vet-
erans in their first year out of the mili-
tary to provide them with information 
about relevant resources. 
This bill would require VA to con-
duct numerous studies with the goals 
of improving care for veterans with 
sleep disorders, refining inpatient care 
for veterans struggling with addiction, 
identifying treatments for veterans 
suffering from both mental health and 
substance use disorders, and assessing 
the possible secondary impacts PTSD 
and depression may have on veterans’ 
families. 
This bill is the product of bipartisan, 
bicameral negotiations between the 
Veterans Affairs’ Committee leaders. I 
thank Chairman TAKANO for working 
with me to introduce this bill and 
move it forward today. 
I thank Senate colleagues Chairman 
TESTER and Ranking Member MORAN 
for their work on this bill. 
This bill contains many provisions 
that were in standalone bills intro-
duced by many of our other Members, 
and I recognize them today. I send a 
particular thank-you to Dr. Murphy, 
Congressman ROUZER, and to two of my 
fellow committee members, veterans 
themselves, 
Dr. 
MILLER-MEEKS
and 
Congressman ELLZEY. Each of them 
spearheaded vital pieces of this legisla-
tion that will help veterans and their 
families thrive for years to come. 
I encourage any veteran listening to 
this who is struggling and in need of 
support to contact the veterans hotline 
by calling 1–800–273–8825 and pressing 1. 
Once again, that is 1–800–273–8825 and 
pressing 1. Or you can also get there by 
texting 838255. That is 838255. Or you 
can actually visit the Veterans Crisis 
Line at veteranscrisisline.net, all one 
word. 
There is absolutely no shame in ask-
ing for help if you need it. 
I urge my colleagues to join me in 
supporting this bill. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. LEVIN of California. Madam 
Speaker, I have no further speakers, 
and I am prepared to close. I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. BOST. Madam Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentleman from North 
Carolina 
(Mr. 
MURPHY), 
my 
good 
friend. 
Mr. MURPHY of North Carolina. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today in enthu-
siastic support of H.R. 6411, the Sup-
port The Resiliency of Our Nation’s 
Great Veterans Act, commonly known 
as the STRONG Act. 
I am proud that this legislation in-
cludes language from my bill, H.R. 
4233, the Student Veterans Counseling 
Centers Eligibility Act. I introduced 
this bill alongside Ranking Member 
BOST to aid veteran transition back to 
civilian life, especially for those look-
ing to further their education. 
Far too often, we see the tragedy of 
our selfless defenders losing their bat-
tle to mental health issues when re-
turning from service. The intention of 
our provision is to aid more of our vet-
erans who are readjusting to civilian 
lives by providing them with overdue 
access to vital mental health re-
sources. 
This is especially personal to my dis-
trict, as I represent 89,000 veterans, 
many of whom are or will be receiving 
benefits via the Post-9/11 GI Bill. 
Regardless of which side of the aisle 
we sit on, we have an obligation to 
make sure that our counseling services 
are more accessible for our veterans, 
and I am glad that the STRONG Act fo-
cuses on this obligation. 
My provision would expand coun-
seling and mental health support to 
student veterans through the VA’s re-
adjustment counseling centers, also 
known as Vet Centers. These centers 
provide individual, group, marriage, 
and family counseling, as well as peer 
support opportunities for Active-Duty 
servicemembers, veterans, members of 
the National Guard and Reserve, and 
certain military family members. Vet 
Centers are community based, con-
fidential, and free. 
A recent RAND study shows that 20 
percent of veterans on the GI Bill face 
feelings of depression from PTSD. That 
20 percent amounts to over 170,000 vet-
erans, double the number of veterans in 
my district. 
Currently, the option of student vet-
erans using school psychologists, in ac-
tuality, provides very little relief for 
our veterans. The director of policy 
and advocacy for the National Associa-
tion of School Psychologists has re-
ported that the national ratio of school 
psychologists to students is anywhere 
from 1 to 2,000 to 1 to 5,000. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentleman has expired. 
Mr. BOST. Madam Speaker, I yield 
an additional 2 minutes to the gen-
tleman from North Carolina (Mr. MUR-
PHY). 
Mr. MURPHY of North Carolina. I 
have heard personal stories from stu-
dent veterans who have had to wait 
weeks or even months for a mental 
health appointment if their mental 
health crisis was not deemed in need of 
‘‘immediate attention.’’ Unfortunately, 
many of our veterans do not have the 
luxury of weeks or months to see a 
mental health provider. 
In addition, many of our universities’ 
mental health counselors are actually 
not licensed professionals but, instead, 
graduate or doctoral students. Our vet-
erans deserve better than this. They 
deserve the best healthcare from quali-
fied professionals. 
Helping students succeed in school 
and their civilian lives is one of the 
most important ways we can thank 
them for their service. 
Tragically, the suicide rate among 
our veterans now is estimated to be 
anywhere from 17 to 22 suicides a day. 
Forty-six percent of military students

have reported suicidal thoughts, com-
pared with only 6 percent of their non-
military peers. 
If we can provide mental health serv-
ices that are able to assist just a single 
veteran who is contemplating suicide 
to choose to live, I believe it is our 
sworn duty to do so. We have that op-
portunity now. 
I am proud to support the STRONG 
Veterans Act, and I am very grateful to 
Chairman TAKANO and Ranking Mem-
ber BOST for including my bill, the Stu-
dent Veterans Counseling Center Eligi-
bility Act. I urge my colleagues to vote 
‘‘yes’’ on H.R. 6411 in support of our 
Nation’s veterans. 
Mr. LEVIN of California. Madam 
Speaker, I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. BOST. Madam Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentleman from North 
Carolina (Mr. ROUZER). 
Mr. ROUZER. Madam Speaker, after 
hearing from my constituent whose 
veteran spouse tragically died by sui-
cide, and learning of the obstacles they 
faced when trying to receive critical 
mental health support for themselves 
and their children following his death, 
I introduced a bill to ensure veteran 
families struggling from such a loss 
have access to the support they need 
and deserve. 
My legislative language, included in 
this bill before us today, the STRONG 
Veterans Act, expands Vet Center eligi-
bility for counseling and mental health 
services to families of servicemembers 
or veterans who died by suicide. This 
expansion of services is necessary so 
that these families can receive the 
critical mental health support needed 
to help them heal and move forward. 
We all know that grief can be ex-
tremely isolating, and the families of 
servicemembers and veterans who have 
died by suicide should not have to 
worry about enduring this difficult 
journey alone. 
Our military families who support a 
loved one who is serving, or has served, 
make a tremendous sacrifice for our 
country, as well. We must ensure they 
have access to the care that they de-
serve and the help that they need when 
trying to move forward after a suicide 
has devastated them and their family. 
Madam Speaker, I thank the chair-
man and the ranking member for work-
ing with me to include this very impor-
tant piece of legislation in this pack-
age, and I encourage my colleagues to 
support it. 
Mr. LEVIN of California. Madam 
Speaker, I am prepared to close. I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. BOST. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself the balance of my time. 
First off, I say thank you to all the 
people who have worked on this impor-
tant piece of legislation for the support 
that it is has received. 
The important thing is that we get 
the care, treatment, and support for all 
the veterans who are considering sui-
cide and the families who suffer from 
the fact that they have done it. 
Madam Speaker, I encourage all of 
my colleagues to support this bill, and 
I yield back the balance of my time. 
Mr. LEVIN of California. Madam 
Speaker, again, I ask all of my col-
leagues to join me in passing H.R. 6411, 
as amended, and I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, I rise 
in support of H.R. 6411, known as the 
STRONG Veterans Act of 2022. 
As a senior member of the House Commit-
tees on Judiciary and Homeland Security, I 
care deeply about our veterans. 
I offer my deepest gratitude to our Nation’s 
troops and reservists, their families, and the 
21.6 million veterans, including 29,126 in the 
18th Congressional District of Texas that I 
proudly represent. 
In Congress, I have sponsored many legis-
lative proposals and co-sponsored well over 
50 pieces of legislation that will positively ben-
efit our veterans and their families. 
Veterans with mental health diagnoses have 
a significantly elevated suicide risk. Suicide 
rates of veterans are at an all-time high, rising 
25 percent in 2021 over the previous year. 
Veterans continue to have a 50 percent higher 
risk of suicide than their peers who have not 
served. 
More than 80 percent of post-9/11 veterans 
say that the public does not understand the 
problems that veterans face when transitioning 
to civilian life. 
Current resources to help the mental health 
of our veterans are inadequate. Our veterans 
need our support when transitioning back to 
civilian life. 
The STRONG Veterans Act will: 
Open eligibility for more student veterans at 
Vet Centers; 
Expand culturally competent suicide preven-
tion at VA for native veterans; 
Significantly increase mental health staffing 
and training at VA medical centers and Vet 
Centers; 
Further strengthen the Veterans Crisis Line; 
Allow more veterans to benefit from engag-
ing with peer specialists; and 
Collect data for VA to guide expansion of in-
patient mental health and substance use treat-
ment. 
I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of H.R. 
6411. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from California (Mr. 
LEVIN) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 6411, as 
amended. 
The question was taken; and (two- 
thirds being in the affirmative) the 
rules were suspended and the bill, as 
amended, was passed. 
A motion to reconsider was laid on 
the table.

LGBTQI+ DATA INCLUSION ACT 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Mr. Speaker, pursuant to House 
Resolution 1191, I call up the bill (H.R. 
4176) to improve Federal population 
surveys by requiring the collection of 
voluntary, self-disclosed information 
on sexual orientation and gender iden-
tity in certain surveys, and for other 
purposes, and ask for its immediate 
consideration. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. 
CICILLINE). Pursuant to House Resolu-
tion 1191, in lieu of the amendment in 
the 
nature 
of 
a 
substitute 
rec-
ommended by the Committee on Over-
sight and Reform printed in the bill, an 
amendment in the nature of a sub-
stitute consisting of the text of Rules 
Committee Print 117–52, modified by 
the amendment printed in part A of 
House Report 117–381, is adopted and 
the bill, as amended, is considered 
read. 
The text of the bill, as amended, is as 
follows: 
H.R. 4176 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled. 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘LGBTQI+ Data 
Inclusion Act’’. 
SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
The Congress finds the following: 
(1) The National Academies on Sciences, Engi-
neering, and Medicine (NASEM), in their 2022 
report, found that complete and accurate demo-
graphic information on the LGBTQI+ commu-
nity should be standardized and collected. 
(2) Comprehensive statistics are needed to in-
form public policy and Federal programs. 
(3) The availability of data also has a critical 
role in ensuring that any disparities in areas 
like health outcomes, housing, and employment 
can be addressed. 
(4) As of the March release of the NASEM re-
port, limited Federal surveys collect data on sex-
ual orientation and gender, with none currently 
measuring intersex populations. 
(5) The integrity of the Federal statistical sys-
tem relies on the ability of agencies to determine 
the content of their statistical surveys based on 
considerations of relevance, timeliness, accu-
racy, objectivity, and ability to maintain con-
fidentiality. 
SEC. 3. REQUIREMENT TO COLLECT DATA ON 
SEXUAL 
ORIENTATION, 
GENDER 
IDENTITY, AND VARIATIONS IN SEX 
CHARACTERISTICS. 
(a) SURVEY REQUIREMENT.—Not later than 360 
days after the date of the enactment of this Act, 
the head of any agency that collects informa-
tion through a covered survey shall establish 
data standards that require, with regard to the 
survey, the following: 
(1) REVIEW.—The review of covered surveys to 
determine in which surveys information about 
sexual orientation, gender identity, and vari-
ations in sex characteristics is not included. 
(2) METHODS.—An identification of appro-
priate methods to include questions on sexual 
orientation, gender identity, and variations in 
sex characteristics in covered surveys that facili-
tate categorization and voluntary participation 
and preserve privacy and confidentiality. 
(3) DATA COLLECTION.—The use of the appro-
priate methods identified in paragraph (2) to 
gather data on sexual orientation, gender iden-
tity, and variations in sex characteristics for 
any survey identified in paragraph (1). 
(4) ASSESSMENT.—The implementation of a 
process to routinely assess needed changes in 
covered survey methods related to asking ques-
tions on sexual orientation, gender identity, and 
variations in sex characteristics. 
(b) DATA REPORTS; WAIVER.— 
(1) DATA
REPORTS.—Not later than 3 years 
after the date of the enactment of this Act, any 
report published by an agency that relies on 
covered survey demographic data shall include 
information on sexual orientation, gender iden-
tity, and variations in sex characteristics. 
(2) WAIVER.—The statistical official (as de-
scribed in section 314 of title 5, United States 
Code) of each agency, or the head of the agen-
cy, for any agency that does not have a statis-
tical official, may waive the requirement under 
paragraph (1), on a case-by-case basis, if the 
standards and policies in subsection (c) can not 
be met, or if adding such information to the sur-
vey would impair the ability of the agency to 
preserve the utility, accuracy, or objectivity of 
the survey while also generating relevant evi-
dence about the LGBTQI+ community. 
(c) CONFIDENTIALITY.—Any information col-
lected relating to the sexual orientation, gender 
identity, or variations in sex characteristics of a 
covered survey participant shall be maintained 
in accordance with applicable confidentiality 
and privacy laws, policies, and standards. 
(d) CONSTRUCTION.—Nothing in this Act shall 
be construed to require an individual to disclose 
their sexual orientation, gender identity, or 
variations in sex characteristics to an agency. 
(e) RULE OF CONSTRUCTION.—Nothing in this 
section shall be construed to permit the use of 
information collected under this section in a 
manner that would adversely affect any indi-
vidual, or that is inconsistent with disclosure 
limitations established in any other law. 
(f) DEFINITIONS.—In this section: 
(1) AGENCY.—The term ‘‘agency’’ has the 
meaning given that term in section 551 of title 5, 
United States Code. 
(2) COVERED SURVEY.—The term ‘‘covered sur-
vey’’ means a survey that includes demographic 
data in which— 
(A) a subject self-reports information; or 
(B) a knowledgeable proxy provides informa-
tion about the subject or responds for all indi-
viduals in a household. 
(3) DEMOGRAPHIC
DATA.—The term ‘‘demo-
graphic data’’ means information about the race 
or ethnicity, sex, and age of a survey partici-
pant or population. 
(4) GENDER

pearance, mannerism, or other gender-related 
characteristic of an individual, regardless of the 
designated sex at birth of the individual. 
(5) SEXUAL ORIENTATION.—The term ‘‘sexual 
orientation’’ means how a person identifies in 
terms of their emotional, romantic, or sexual at-
traction, and includes identification as straight, 
heterosexual, gay, lesbian, or bisexual, among 
other terms. 
(6) SURVEY.—The term ‘‘survey’’ means a data 
collection activity involving a questionnaire for 
a sample of a population and includes the de-
cennial census. 
(7) VARIATIONS IN SEX CHARACTERISTICS.—The

mosome patterns), that differ from normative ex-
pectations for male or female bodies regarding 
the development, appearance, or function of 
sex-related characteristics; and 
(B) is sometimes referred to as intersex traits. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The bill, 
as amended, shall be debatable for 1 
hour equally divided and controlled by 
the chair and ranking minority mem-
ber of the Committee on Oversight and 
Reform or their respective designees. 
The gentlewoman from New York 
(Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY) and the 
gentleman from Kentucky (Mr. COMER) 
each will control 30 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from New York (Mrs. CAROLYN 
B. MALONEY).

GENERAL LEAVE 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous 
consent that all Members have 5 legis-
lative days in which to revise and ex-
tend their remarks and insert extra-
neous material on the bill before us. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from New York? 
There was no objection. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such 
time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support 
of H.R. 4176, the LGBTQI+ Data Inclu-
sion Act. This historic bill takes the 
long overdue step of ensuring that Fed-
eral agencies collect data on sexual 
orientation, gender identity, and vari-
ation in sex characteristics so that the 
Federal Government can better under-
stand and serve America’s LGBTQI+ 
communities. 
We are considering this legislation at 
a critical time. Across the United 
States, the rights of the LGBTQI+ peo-
ple are under attack and the health 
and safety of LGBTQI+ people are 
under threat. From the limited data 
currently 
available, 
we 
understand

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5857 
June 23, 2022 
that LGBTQI+ people disproportion-
ately experience poverty, housing inse-
curity, adverse physical and mental 
health outcomes, discrimination, and 
more. For example, according to the 
Williams Institute, more than one in 
five LGBTQI+ people live in poverty. 
According to the American Psychiatric 
Association, LGBTQI+ people are 2.5 
times more likely to experience depres-
sion, anxiety, and substance abuse 
than people who are heterosexual. 
There is also an epidemic of violence 
against transgender and gender-non-
conforming people across the U.S.—an 
epidemic that killed more than 50 peo-
ple last year. 
The LGBTQI+ Data Inclusion Act, in-
troduced by my friend and chair of the 
Natural Resources Committee, RAU´ L 
GRIJALVA, would close many long-
standing gaps in the collection of data 
pertaining to our Nation’s LGBTQI+ 
communities. By ensuring that Federal 
surveys collect data on sexual orienta-
tion, gender identity, and variations in 
sex characteristics, this bill will equip 
Congress and Federal agencies with the 
information they need to better under-
stand the specific challenges faced by 
the LGBTQI+ communities and help us 
develop equitable policy solutions. 
This bill currently has 128 cospon-
sors. The legislation has also received 
overwhelming support from more than 
200 civil rights, health, and scientific 
organizations and the LGBTQ+ Equal-
ity Caucus. 
This bill builds on the Biden adminis-
tration’s efforts to advance equity for 
LGBTQI+ populations, including by 
empowering Federal agencies to carry 
out the President’s recently announced 
executive order to expand collection of 
Federal data pertaining to LGBTQI+ 
people. 
The Biden administration issued a 
Statement of Administration Policy 
that strongly supports passage of the 
bill. 
Importantly, under this bill answer-
ing questions about one’s sexual ori-
entation, gender identity, and vari-
ations in sex characteristics would be 
entirely voluntary, and the bill also in-
cludes strong confidentiality and pri-
vacy protections. The design of this 
bill strikes a necessary balance be-
tween 
informing 
policymaking 
and 
protecting the personal information of 
LGBTQI+ people across the country. 
Before I conclude, let me take a mo-
ment to acknowledge the importance 
of the House taking this historic step 
during Pride Month—a celebration of 
immeasurable contributions made by 
LGBTQI+ people in every aspect of 
American life and a reminder of our 
continued mission to ensure that every 
community in the United States is 
treated with equality and respect. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support this bill, and I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. COMER. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, the LGBTQI+ Data In-
clusion Act requires Federal agencies 
to collect highly sensitive information 
from the American people. 
With Americans facing record infla-
tion, record gas prices, supply chain 
shortages, 
and 
skyrocketing 
drug 
overdoses, it is unbelievable that this 
is a priority for the House Democrats. 
Mortgage rates are at their highest 
levels since 2008. Inflation rates are at 
their highest levels in 40 years. Nation-
ally, gas prices are averaging over $5 
per gallon. There is a severe shortage 
of baby formula across our country. It 
has been a free-for-all at the southern 
border since President Biden took of-
fice both for illegal immigrants and 
deadly drugs. 
The House majority is ignoring these 
issues. They have also ignored the 
botched withdrawal from Afghanistan, 
the origins of the COVID pandemic, 
and the impact of shutdowns and 
school closures on American children. 
Instead, today we are considering a di-
visive bill, a bill that does nothing to 
address Americans’ problems. 
H.R. 4176 requires Federal agencies to 
include questions regarding sexual ori-
entation and gender identity on their 
surveys. There are over 130 such sur-
veys across the Federal agencies. This 
also includes the Census. My colleagues 
across the aisle oppose asking whether 
someone is an American citizen on the 
Census because they say it could deter 
participation, but they want to ask 
about sexual orientation and gender 
identity. 
This is information many Americans 
would not want to share with the Fed-
eral Government. This could certainly 
reduce response rates to the Census 
and a host of statistical surveys our 
government relies on to inform impor-
tant policy decisions. 
I would remind my House colleagues 
that asking these questions during a 
job interview is illegal. In fact, Title 
VII of the Civil Rights Act protects 
against employment discrimination on 
the basis of sex. This has been inter-
preted by the Supreme Court to include 
sexual orientation and gender identity. 
Yet, House Democrats want the Fed-
eral Government to ask Americans 
about this most private of information. 
My Democrat colleagues claim this 
bill will expand funding and services 
for those who identify as LGBTQI+, but 
they haven’t specified funding and for 
what services. 
We also don’t know how agencies will 
actually use this information, and we 
don’t know how bad actors would ex-
ploit this information. Federal agen-
cies are constantly the targets of 
cyberattacks and subject to leaks. A 
Chinese attack on the Office of Per-
sonnel Management exposed the data 
of millions of Americans. The Internal 
Revenue Service has leaked tax infor-
mation on high-profile Americans to 
the press. This information could be 
used for harmful purposes, so Ameri-
cans may be reluctant to risk answer-
ing a survey entirely. 
House Democrats say that these in-
trusive questions will remain optional 
under the bill, but we all know the 
pressure respondents will feel to an-
swer a Federal agency survey. In fact, 
the bill has been amended by the rule 
to strike the exemption from penalty 
provision which protected survey re-
spondents from fine or other penalty if 
they refused to answer a question. 
Why did this language need to be re-
moved if the questions are optional? 
Are they planning to penalize re-
spondents for not answering questions 
about their sexuality and gender? 
We do not know why, and that is be-
cause this bill hasn’t gone through any 
due diligence. 
Another troubling part of the bill is 
how it allows observers or proxies to 
fill out these surveys on behalf of oth-
ers. 
Should we really have other people 
asking highly personal questions about 
somebody else on a Federal agency sur-
vey? 
Republicans don’t think so. 
A proxy could make a guess, or a per-
son would have to tell this proxy their 
sexual orientation or gender identity— 
something they may not want to dis-
cuss. 
When the House Oversight and Re-
form Committee considered the bill 
last week, committee Republicans sup-
ported an amendment offered by Rep-
resentative MICHAEL CLOUD to strike 
this provision, but committee Demo-
crats rejected it. 
House Republicans also have con-
cerns about presenting children with 
questions about sexual orientation or 
gender identity. 
Why should a minor be confronted by 
such topics? 
For instance, the National Survey of 
Fishing, Hunting and Wildlife-Associ-
ated Recreation includes respondents 
as young as 6 years old. Federal sur-
veys are no place to confront the 
American people or their children with 
intrusive questions and concerns about 
sexual orientation or gender identity, 
especially when parents are worried 
about this agenda with an ever-evolv-
ing list of identities. It is hard to keep 
up. 
Many parents have grave concerns 
that advocates of this agenda are seek-
ing to indoctrinate their children and 
drive a wedge within their families, 
and this bill confirms some of these 
concerns by allowing these questions 
to be directed to children. Democrats 
have not addressed or even acknowl-
edged these concerns. 
In the committee markup of H.R. 
4176, my colleague, GLENN GROTHMAN, 
offered an amendment to prohibit the 
collection of this information from mi-
nors, but committee Democrats voted 
this sensible amendment down unani-
mously. 
What is more telling is House Demo-
crat leadership have refused to make 
either Representative GROTHMAN’s or 
Representative CLOUD’s amendments in 
order today. I wonder why the House 
majority refuses to consider an amend-
ment aimed at protecting children.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5858 
June 23, 2022 
These amendments address impor-
tant issues. The American people’s 
Representatives should be able to vote 
on them before sending this troubling 
bill to the Senate. The American peo-
ple deserve better from this legislative 
body. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such 
time as I may consume. 
I point out to my good colleague that 
this year the National Academies put 
out a report which found that complete 
and accurate demographic information 
on the LGBTQI+ community should be 
standardized and collected. The report 
showed that only a limited number of 
Federal surveys collect data on sexual 
orientation and gender identity, and 
that none collect data on intersex pop-
ulations. 
This bill would greatly improve our 
data collection efforts. This would help 
ensure the Federal Government’s pro-
grams and services can reach every 
person in the U.S. with the greatest ef-
fectiveness. 
It would help us also to better ad-
dress longstanding health and eco-
nomic 
inequities 
for 
America’s 
LGBTQI+ population. From the limited 
research currently available, we under-
stand that LGBTQI+ people dispropor-
tionately experience poverty, housing 
insecurity, adverse physical and men-
tal health outcomes, discrimination, 
and more. So collecting this data is 
critically important to ensure that our 
policies 
meet 
the 
needs 
of 
our 
LGBTQI+ constituents. 
I will give one example of why this is 
so important. Without the collection of 
this data, States were not able to 
measure the impact of the pandemic on 
the LGBTQI+ individuals. They were 
completely left out of all medical sur-
veys leaving pandemic response pro-
grams at risk of neglecting these indi-
viduals. It moves us to a more inclu-
sive and equitable society. 
Representative RAUL GRIJALVA is the 
distinguished and outstanding chair-
man of the Committee on Natural Re-
sources. He is the author of the origi-
nal bill. I was proud to work with him, 
with the committee members to bring 
it to the floor. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he 
may consume to the gentleman from 
Arizona (Mr. GRIJALVA). 
Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
Mrs. MALONEY, who is the chair of the 
House Oversight and Reform Com-
mittee, and the LGBTQ+ Equality Cau-
cus for their work and support for the 
LGBTQI+ Data Inclusion Act. 
As we celebrate Pride Month and re-
member the 53rd anniversary of the 
Stonewall 
riots, 
we 
recognize 
the 
progress, lived experience, and suf-
fering of the LGBTQI+ community. 
In many ways our Federal Govern-
ment is falling short on the promise to 
craft and implement inclusive public 
policy, in part, because we lack the 
necessary data to address the issues af-
fecting the LGBTQI+ community. 
b 1500 
While some data is currently col-
lected and Federal agents have made 
progress, far too many LGBTQI+ indi-
viduals remain overlooked in many 
Federal data collection efforts. 
As the Center for American Progress 
has calculated, more than five in six 
LGBTQ adults cannot be identified by 
existing questions in non-experimental 
survey conducted by the U.S. Census 
Bureau such as the American Commu-
nity Survey and the Census, which 
only accounts for cohabitating same- 
sex couples. 
That is why I introduced this legisla-
tion, the LGBTQI+ Data Inclusion Act, 
to ensure we have robust and accurate 
data. 
The bill would require Federal sur-
veys to include data collection on sex-
ual orientation, gender identity, and 
variations of sex characteristics on a 
voluntary basis. Again, let me empha-
size what the Chair emphasized, this 
bill would only collect voluntary, self- 
disclosed data. 
An individual will not be required to 
disclose this information, nor would 
this information be used in a manner 
that would adversely affect any indi-
vidual. 
It would ensure that lawmakers and 
Federal agencies have the comprehen-
sive data they need to address the 
LGBTQI+ issues. 
We cannot craft policies that remedy 
the disparities faced by these individ-
uals, particularly people of color, in 
issues of discrimination, unemploy-
ment, healthcare, housing instability, 
and more if we do not have the ade-
quate and correct data. 
We have seen how the pandemic has 
impacted many Americans, and we are 
still learning how the LGBTQI+ com-
munity were disproportionately af-
fected by the COVID–19 crisis. This is 
just one of many areas that our Fed-
eral Government lacks knowledge in 
how to respond to these issues. 
In many ways, the tireless work of 
LGBTQ organizations in gathering this 
information has provided a better 
scope of the problems and disparities 
than the Federal Government itself. 
The LGBTQI+ community deserves 
to be visible and heard so public policy 
can better reflect their needs. It is crit-
ical to close the data gap that often in-
validates their lives. 
Perhaps more importantly, this bill 
comes at a time when Republican State 
legislatures across this country have 
introduced more than 300 anti-LGBTQ 
bills that target youth and their fami-
lies. This bill would force those indi-
viduals focused on denying rights to 
LGBTQ individuals to have a reck-
oning. 
It will allow the community to be 
counted and, therefore, heard. 
Not only is this bill necessary, it is a 
top priority of President Biden. 
During his first day in office, Presi-
dent Biden issued numerous executive 
orders to strengthen the rights and im-
prove the lives of LGBTQI+ people 
across this country. 
He directed all Federal agencies that 
enforce Federal laws prohibiting sex 
discrimination to also prohibit dis-
crimination based on sexual orienta-
tion and gender identity. 
Just last week, he established a new 
Federal coordinating committee on 
sexual orientation and gender identity 
for data which will lead efforts across 
agencies to identify opportunities to 
strengthen this data collection, while 
safeguarding privacy protection and 
the civil rights of individuals. 
These are all great initiatives, but we 
need to go further and codify them into 
law. This is why this bill is so impor-
tant. 
In addition, this bill includes imple-
mentation of a process for Federal 
agencies to routinely assess changes 
needed in the collection of this data. 
This will provide enough flexibility for 
Federal agents to use the most effec-
tive data collection methods for their 
agency. 
We are grateful for the invaluable 
support and input of more than 200 
LGBTQI+ groups and allies that have 
helped get this legislation to where it 
is today. It could not have been done 
without them. 
This is an important piece of legisla-
tion for each and every LGBTQI+ indi-
vidual in our Nation. As a proud ally, I 
urge my colleagues to support this bill 
so that all our constituents are seen, 
heard, and counted. 
We are not ignoring the current chal-
lenges facing Americans. They are not 
being ignored, as was brought up. 
Rather, we are treating all Americans 
equally and being inclusive. 
And in this great legacy of our Na-
tion, one of the great legacies that all 
of us who take pride in being part of 
this Nation, who take pride in being 
Americans, one of the great legacies is 
that this Nation offers, under the rule 
of law, an inalienable right of equality; 
an inalienable right of access, and for 
public policy to reflect the needs and 
respond to the needs of all individuals. 
This bill takes us one step further in 
this direction. This bill is not punitive; 
it is inclusive. This bill is not mean- 
spirited; it is welcoming. And this bill, 
above all, is American for all Ameri-
cans. 
Mr. COMER. Madam Speaker, I yield 
3 minutes to the gentleman from Wis-
consin (Mr. GROTHMAN). 
Mr. GROTHMAN. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman for yielding. 
I rise today in strong opposition to 
H.R. 4176. This horrifying bill would re-
quire all Federal agencies that collect 
demographic data to ask Americans 
about their sexual orientation or gen-
der identity; and that goes all the way 
to including the Census, ultimately, af-
fecting every American. 
I realize the majority party will 
claim that you don’t have to fill out 
this form. But we all know, as a prac-
tical matter, almost all people pre-
sented with a form will fill out the 
whole thing. There are very people who 
have the gumption or whatever to say,

I refuse to fill out such and such a 
question. 
Now, 
honestly, 
this 
bill 
affects 
adults. And I am old enough to remem-
ber when the gay rights movement was 
supposed to be about, we are not going 
to poke around and see what people are 
doing in the bedroom. Now we are kind 
of going in the opposite direction. We 
are going to require everybody to talk 
about their sexual orientation which, 
by itself, is a little bit offensive. 
But I am also going to focus more on 
the fact that this bill requires—doesn’t 
require but asks for responses from 
people under 18 years of age, which is 
just almost beyond belief. 
If a parent gets randomly selected to 
fill out the National Survey on Chil-
dren’s Health, Democrats want the 
Federal Government to ask parents to 
disclose if their 3-year-old son is at-
tracted to boys or girls. That is why we 
should call this, steal our children’s 
childhood act. 
When public schools report data to 
the U.S. Department of Education’s 
Civil Rights Data Collection, schools 
will ask kindergartners through 12th 
graders what their sexual orientation 
is or which gender they think they are. 
What exactly are you supposed to re-
spond if you are an 8-year-old child? 
What are they supposed to do with 
this question? 
Johnny, here we have a question for 
you. And what is he going to say? I am 
gay because my favorite cartoon char-
acter is gay. I’m trans because I like 
my mother’s dress. 
I don’t know what they are supposed 
to do with this question, and I think it 
is absurd that we would ever expect 
anybody to ask these questions of a lit-
tle child. But clearly, that is what the 
majority party wants. 
And we hear about today like people 
you couldn’t tell what they are when 
they are 6 years old or 5 years old. I 
mean, really beyond belief. 
And like I said, our corrupt popular 
culture today, we are told people are 
identifying as something or other when 
they are 7 or 8 years old. 
So in any event, I think it is obvious 
to vote ‘‘no’’ on this bill. I don’t know 
how, as a country, we got to a place 
where we are asking 7- or 8-year-olds to 
declare a sexual preference, but that is 
where we are today; and the majority 
party thinks it makes perfect sense. 
The Democrats must know this is 
wrong. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Ms. 
JACKSON LEE). The time of the gen-
tleman has expired. 
Mr. COMER. I yield an additional 1 
minute to the gentleman from Wis-
consin. 
Mr. GROTHMAN. I guess we can 
about wrap this up. 
I want the American public, though, 
to stop and think where we are today. 
We are going to pass a bill in which 7- 
or 8- or 9-year-olds are supposed to de-
clare a sexual preference. 
I will close by saying, the clergy of 
this country should ponder how we got 
this far and what they want to do 
about it. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute 
to the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. 
HOYER), the distinguished majority 
leader. 
Mr. 
HOYER. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
I 
thank the gentlewoman for yielding. 
Obviously, in order to serve the 
American people and to serve their 
needs, we take in a lot of information— 
in this case, voluntary information, to 
determine what we can do to assist and 
make better the lives of people and the 
challenges they face. 
This Pride Month we celebrate all 
the progress we have made over the 
years to help LGBTQ Americans ex-
press themselves more openly, to help 
their community become more visible, 
and to be free from the danger of vio-
lence perpetrated against them because 
of who they are. 
We must acknowledge, however, that 
the Federal Government does not do 
enough to ensure that that community 
is seen and considered when making 
key policy decisions. 
Although there is evidence that 
LGBTQ 
Americans, 
especially 
transgender people, still face substan-
tial prejudice in areas such as housing, 
employment, and education, we need 
more data to determine the scope of 
these challenges and to devise a policy 
solution that works for all. 
To promote visibility, foster inclu-
sion, and build equity and equality for 
LGBTQ Americans, this legislation 
would ask the Federal agencies to col-
lect voluntary information on orienta-
tion and gender identity whenever they 
ask for other demographic data. 
I want to emphasize, as I know has 
been emphasized, that although this 
data will be processed anonymously, 
submission of this information will al-
ways be and continue to be completely 
voluntary. 
Americans should never be forced to 
disclose their sexual orientation or 
gender identity to the government, pe-
riod. To that extent I think we all 
agree. 
I thank Representative GRIJALVA for 
introducing this legislation, as well as 
Chairwoman MALONEY
and her col-
leagues on the Oversight and Reform 
Committee for their efforts to advance 
this bill. 
Although we still have much to do to 
address 
the 
disparities 
and 
marginalization of the LGBTQ people 
and what they face in America, this 
bill will help equip policymakers with 
the tools and information needed to 
make further progress. 
Our vote today is a continuation, 
frankly, of the efforts of Johnson, 
Milk, and other leaders who showed 
courage in the LGBTQ community to 
come forward and to say that we are 
people and we need to be treated as 
equal under the law. And this will, I 
think, help us meet that responsibility. 
Mr. COMER. Madam Speaker, I yield 
5 minutes to the gentleman from Ari-
zona (Mr. BIGGS). 
Mr. BIGGS. Madam Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman for yielding. 
Madam Speaker, today we have heard 
impassioned arguments from House 
Democrats about the need to gather 
better data on the American popu-
lation. In fact, the majority leader just 
said: Obviously, we take information to 
better provide services to Americans. 
That is what he said. 
As required by the Constitution, the 
decennial Census is carried out every 10 
years to conduct an actual enumera-
tion ‘‘in such manner as Congress shall 
by law direct.’’ 
It is well past time—it is well past 
time that Congress, again, directs the 
Census Bureau to collect data on the 
citizenship of respondents. 
I realize that many of my colleagues 
do not believe that there is a crisis on 
our southern border. But just last 
month, CBP had 239,416 encounters 
along the southern border. And what 
that means is every encounter is either 
a surrender or an arrest of somebody 
who is illegally in the country. 
Of those, 25 percent involved an indi-
vidual who had at least one prior en-
counter in the previous 12 months. This 
does not include the number of known 
and unknown getaways which, last 
year, are estimated to have been a mil-
lion individuals we don’t know any-
thing about. 
So whether someone is a U.S. citizen 
is an important data point that should 
be recorded in the Census and on other 
Federal data surveys. If we are going to 
get information, as the majority leader 
said, this should be in that panoply of 
information. 
As we have heard today from my col-
league across the aisle, data from these 
Federal surveys inform policy deci-
sions. For instance, decennial Census 
data informs Federal funding and en-
forcement of the Voting Rights Act. 
b 1515 
I believe we should know whether the 
Federal Government is serving its citi-
zens well, but how can we do that when 
we do not know how many citizens 
there are, how many actual citizens 
there are, or where they live? 
Today, I will offer a straightforward 
solution to this problem as a motion to 
recommit. If we adopt the motion to 
recommit, we will instruct the Com-
mittee on Oversight and Reform to 
consider an amendment to require the 
Federal surveys covered by the bill—in-
cluding the U.S. Census—to also ask 
respondents whether they are U.S. citi-
zens. 
In contrast to asking intrusive ques-
tions about sexual orientation that 
serve no legitimate purpose, the Fed-
eral Government should have a better 
understanding of the U.S. citizens re-
siding in America and those who are 
not citizens. 
This information will better inform 
lawmakers and ensure the government 
is working to better the lives of Ameri-
cans, which is what I have heard is the 
stated goal of the Democrats.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5860 
June 23, 2022 
It is time that the U.S. Govern-
ment—and U.S. Congress, especially— 
works to protect the prosperity of the 
American people. Such serious work 
starts with strong borders and a sound 
immigration policy that is actually en-
forced. 
Contrary to what the chairwoman 
stated in the Rules Committee, the Su-
preme Court has not decided it is un-
lawful to inquire about citizenship on 
the Census. 
The Supreme Court—let me reiterate 
that—has not said you cannot inquire 
about citizenship. That is false. It has 
been done historically. 
In the prior case before the Supreme 
Court, the process leading up to put-
ting the question on the Census was 
flawed. Upon that basis, the question 
was decided. 
But the decision states, ‘‘The Enu-
meration Clause permits Congress, and 
by extension, the Secretary, to inquire 
about citizenship on the Census ques-
tionnaire.’’ 
That is what we are doing. We are 
following the Constitution as has been 
recognized by the Supreme Court. It is 
critical to ensuring an accurate appor-
tionment of Representatives in the 
House based on the Census—in this 
House—unlike the information this bill 
seeks to collect. Similar to your under-
lying bill, this information will be vol-
untarily gathered. 
Today, the American people will fi-
nally get to see their Representatives 
take a vote on this important matter. 
Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous 
consent to insert the text of the 
amendment 
in 
the 
RECORD
imme-
diately prior to the vote on the motion 
to recommit. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Arizona? 
There was no objection. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Madam Speaker, I respond to his 
statements on the citizenship status in 
saying that it should be collected with 
LGBT data. 
I want to make it very clear that the 
citizenship question should not be part 
of this bill. Requiring that citizenship 
questions be included in this bill is a 
duplication and totally unnecessary. 
The Census Bureau and the Bureau of 
Labor Statistics already ask about 
citizenship status in two different sur-
veys: the American Community Sur-
vey, and the Current Population Sur-
vey. 
This data is collected in addition to 
the volumes of citizenship records col-
lected and maintained by the Depart-
ment of Homeland Security. 
The Trump administration’s efforts 
to add the citizenship question to the 
Census was a fear tactic, intended to 
discourage specific people from partici-
pating in the Census, and to exclude 
them from the count. 
Requiring citizenship data collection 
on Federal surveys was, and always 
will be, about suppressing data sets and 
denying U.S. citizens and residents the 
representation and resources they need 
to contribute to their communities. 
Now, the Supreme Court ruled that 
the Trump administration’s stated rea-
soning for adding the citizenship ques-
tion was ‘‘pretextual.’’ 
Unlike the citizenship question, col-
lecting data on sexual orientation, gen-
der identity, and variations in sex 
characteristics will allow individuals 
to receive the proper care and re-
sources they need to thrive, while help-
ing to combat the discrimination they 
face every day. 
Unlike 
the 
citizenship 
question, 
these questions will be voluntary, and 
respondents’ privacy will be vigorously 
protected. 
Madam Speaker, I yield such time as 
he may consume to the gentleman 
from Rhode Island (Mr. CICILLINE), 
Chair of the LGBTQ+ Equality Caucus. 
Mr. CICILLINE. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the chairwoman for yielding. 
I rise in strong support of the 
LGBTQI+ Data Inclusion Act. I will 
say it is troubling for me to hear of the 
ongoing effort by our Republican col-
leagues to cancel the LGBT commu-
nity. 
Efforts are underway to be sure that 
you are not allowed to speak about 
members of the LGBTQ community, 
the ‘‘Don’t Say Gay’’ laws that are per-
colating in State legislatures and that 
have been passed in some; efforts un-
derway to ban books that include de-
pictions of members of our community; 
and now, today, an effort to oppose col-
lection of data so you can pretend we 
don’t exist. 
We are not going to tolerate that be-
cause LGBTQ+ members have existed 
in this country for a very long time, 
and for far too long, Federal surveys 
have failed to collect critical data on 
our community. 
But we know even with the limited 
data that we have that the LGBTQ 
community is facing many, many great 
challenges. LGBTQI+ people face high-
er rates of unemployment, poverty, and 
housing insecurity and have worse 
physical and mental health outcomes 
than their peers. That is a fact. 
These adverse experiences are not 
just a consequence of who they are, but 
they are a consequence of the way the 
LGBTQI+ community is treated in our 
country and in society. 
They are disparities that are a result 
of a society where discrimination, re-
jection, harassment, even bullying of 
LGBTQI+ people is still common. They 
are the result not of our identities, but 
of how society treats members of our 
community. 
Unfortunately, we are in particularly 
perilous times for our community be-
cause in the last year alone, State leg-
islatures have enacted more than two 
dozen anti-LGBTQI+ laws. Is it any 
surprise that our community still has 
so many obstacles to overcome? 
While we know of some of these ob-
stacles, we lack clear, comprehensive 
Federal data on our community and 
our experiences. The LGBTQI+ Data 
Inclusion Act will change that. 
Good policy comes from good data. If 
we are going to better serve the 
LGBTQI+ community, we need to be 
represented in Federal studies and sur-
veys so that we can better tailor policy 
solutions and address the most press-
ing issues facing LGBTQI+ Americans. 
As States move to codify discrimina-
tion into law, it is even more critical 
than ever that the Federal Government 
collect this data on our experiences so 
that we will have better data to be able 
to develop better tools to tackle the 
many obstacles that face our commu-
nity. 
You know, the whole purpose of this 
is a recognition that particularly for 
LGBTQ+ youth, which seems to be the 
real target of this effort to cancel, this 
cancel culture, that they deserve to be 
treated with respect and kindness and 
empathy like every other kid. 
It is imperative that we collect data 
so that young people can understand 
that they matter, and that when we 
think about mental health strains and 
housing instability and more, that we 
are going to develop solutions that ad-
dress their issues. 
This legislation is about making us 
better as a country, more inclusive, 
making us better policymakers, while 
preserving the privacy of all people in 
the United States, including children. 
You know, some people in this Cham-
ber want to deprive LGBTQ youth of 
the care and the resources they need to 
live healthy, authentic lives. They are 
making inaccurate claims about to-
day’s legislation for that reason. 
Let me remind you: The Trevor 
Project just released a report. Madam 
Speaker, 45 percent of LGBTQ youth 
seriously considered suicide in the past 
year. Almost half of these kids in the 
LGBTQ community seriously consid-
ered killing themselves. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
25 
percent 
of 
LGBTQ youth experience homelessness 
or housing insecurity. If you are an 
LGBTQ youth, you are four times as 
likely to attempt to kill yourself, and 
43 percent of trans kids report being 
bullied in school. 
So these are real challenges. Nobody 
should be okay with that. We want to 
make sure, as so many leading medical 
organizations have already affirmed, 
the importance of providing safe, sup-
portive 
environments 
for 
LGBTQI 
youth and young people to grow up. 
By ensuring that we have robust, ex-
clusive data, today’s legislation will 
help to ensure that our policies provide 
every family in this country and every 
LGBTQI+ young person access to the 
resources they need. 
We should all want that. You just 
can’t cancel a group of folks because 
you don’t like them. This is America. 
Every single person deserves to be 
counted, deserves to be respected, de-
serves to have access to their govern-
ment, and the collection of data does a 
critical part of that work. 
I will end by thanking Chairman GRI-
JALVA for introducing this legislation, 
thanking Chairwoman MALONEY
for

helping shepherd this bill to the floor 
and for her strong advocacy, and I urge 
my colleagues: Think about those sta-
tistics. Think about the young people 
who are being impacted when you vote, 
and vote ‘‘yes.’’ 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Madam Speaker, I thank the 
gentleman for his extraordinary state-
ment, and I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. COMER. Madam Speaker, I yield 
2 minutes to the gentleman from Ari-
zona (Mr. BIGGS). 
Mr. BIGGS. Madam Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman for yielding. 
Madam Speaker, I just want to cover 
and address some of the statements 
made by the chairwoman regarding my 
previous statement. 
She admitted in her statement that 
several surveys already gather the info 
that they seek in the underlying bill. 
Yet, that was a rationale for not ask-
ing the citizenship question. 
What is good for the goose is good for 
the gander. You are already collecting 
some of this information, as you ad-
mitted, from 5 different agencies, and 
you want to expand it to 130. You said, 
well, you guys get it from the Depart-
ment of Labor statistics on the ques-
tion of citizenship. Hey, let’s get it all 
across the board. Let’s do it all across 
the board. Same rationale. 
The chairwoman said the LGBTQ 
question will be voluntary, but the 
citizenship question is not. That is 
simply untrue. If you look at the 
amendment, that would be there. 
We discussed this in the committee. 
All you are doing is you are adding, in 
some cases, just the word ‘‘citizenship’’ 
to the questions that you are already 
asking, or you are asking whether or 
not the respondent is a citizen of the 
United States. 
That is voluntary. It is not manda-
tory. That is just untrue to say that. 
Then the argument was made that 
the Supreme Court used a rationale 
that was inaccurate. The Supreme 
Court rationale for not allowing the 
Trump administration, through an ex-
ecutive agency, to ask the citizenship 
question on the Census was this: It was 
because the process was not initiated 
by Congress. 
The Supreme Court specifically stat-
ed, ‘‘The Enumeration Clause permits 
Congress, and by extension, the Sec-
retary, to inquire about citizenship on 
the Census questionnaire.’’ 
It had not been done by Congress. It 
had been done by a lower-level agency. 
So all of those things should now dispel 
the arguments against including this 
amendment. That is why I am going to 
encourage everyone in this body to 
support the motion to recommit. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Madam Speaker, I yield 2 min-
utes to the gentlewoman from Texas 
(Ms. JACKSON LEE), the distinguished 
chief deputy whip. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, 
I thank the gentlewoman from New 
York, Chairwoman of the Oversight 
Committee, for her leadership, and 
Chairman GRIJALVA for his dynamic 
leadership, as well. 
I rise today because I just feel moved 
by the moment to really talk about 
truth in the moments that I have. I 
started this morning by citing the Dec-
laration of Independence that said, we 
all are created equal—a portion there-
of—with the unalienable rights of life 
and liberty, and the pursuit of happi-
ness. 
It is important that today in Pride 
Month, as I recognize my constituents 
in Houston, all of them, and the caucus 
that has been a steadfast advocate in 
Houston for the rights of all people in 
the LGBTQI community. 
It is important to be counted, to be 
recognized, and I want to emphasize, 
again, the distortion of how punitive 
this will be. It is voluntary. 
I know my constituents. Some of 
them don’t even fill out the Census be-
cause they are free. They know they 
don’t have to do it. Some of them don’t 
answer questions on the Census. 
b 1530 
For anyone to suggest that this 
would be punitive and that people 
would be fearful and they would think 
not to do it, it is voluntary. And I can 
assure 
you 
that 
this 
community, 
LGBTQI+ Americans, remains vulner-
able to discrimination on a daily basis. 
Only 21 States have laws that explic-
itly prohibit discrimination based on 
sexual 
orientation 
in 
employment, 
housing, and public accommodations, 
and only 20 States have such protec-
tions for gender identity. 
H.R. 4176, the LGBTQI+ Data Inclu-
sion Act, is to include and affirm and 
to be counted. 
Do you realize that in most States a 
same-sex couple can get married on 
Saturday, then be legally denied serv-
ice at a restaurant on Sunday, be fired 
from their jobs on Monday, and evicted 
from their apartment on Tuesday? 
We thought we would be past that 
after years of working and fighting, 
but it is important to note that this 
bill will provide us with the appro-
priate information. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Ms. 
ROSS). The time of the gentlewoman 
has expired. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. I yield such time as she may con-
sume to the gentlewoman from Texas. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, 
it is high time that we provide equal 
protection for all members of the 
LGBTQI 
community 
in 
accordance 
with the 14th Amendment. 
H.R. 4176—again, not punitive—will 
take us one more step forward in the 
decades-long journey toward equality 
by creating a tool kit through which 
our LGBTQI community members can 
be represented and the demographic 
data can be taken. 
Let me just simply say that the num-
bers speak truth. I said I wanted to dis-
cuss a moment of truth. When we have 
the data, we can help with housing, 
healthcare, schooling, or special needs 
that this community would have, rep-
resentation as it relates to them being 
counted in Federal funding that may 
be necessary to aid in their cir-
cumstances. 
I am reminded of tragedies that have 
happened before. Does anyone remem-
ber a young man being assailed against 
a fence just because he was part of the 
LGBTQI+ community? 
I met with Matthew Shepard’s moth-
er. I remember these atrocities. 
I see in a State like mine that 
transgender families are threatened 
over trying to find resources for their 
children. We love our children. We love 
our families. 
The only thing I can see in this legis-
lation is the importance of affirming, 
counting, treating with dignity, and 
recognizing that this wonderful com-
munity, 
the 
LGBTQI+ 
community, 
they, too, are America. We, too, are 
America. 
This is a moment of truth, and it is 
simply collecting data, punishing no 
one but uplifting all Americans. I ask 
my colleagues to support H.R. 4176. 
Mr. COMER. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself the balance of my time. 
Madam Speaker, the U.S. House of 
Representatives should focus on help-
ing the American people survive eco-
nomic turmoil and defending our bor-
ders and national security. 
I urge House Democrats to get back 
to what the American people elected us 
to do: conduct oversight over the Fed-
eral Government and the Biden admin-
istration, which is on a path to destroy 
America. 
We need to hold hearings, conduct 
oversight, and pass legislation address-
ing the crises affecting Americans 
today. That is our constitutional re-
sponsibility. That is the responsibility 
of the House Oversight Committee. 
Instead, we are spending valuable re-
sources and time on divisive political 
messaging bills, and that is what this 
is. I oppose H.R. 4176, and I urge my 
colleagues to do the same. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Madam Speaker, I yield myself 
the balance of my time to close. 
I thank the gentleman from Arizona 
(Mr. GRIJALVA) for introducing this im-
portant legislation. I am pleased that 
we were able to bring this bill before 
the House during Pride Month to show 
that we care about everyone in our 
country. We think everyone should be 
counted, everyone should be surveyed, 
and everyone’s needs should be listened 
to. 
I particularly thank the LGBTQ+ 
Equality Caucus for their attention 
and work on this bill and the Com-
mittee on Oversight staff for all the 
work required to make this happen. 
I am also very grateful to the more 
than 124 cosponsors, my colleagues 
here in this body, and more than 200 
civil rights, health, and scientific orga-
nizations that have supported this bill

and affirm the need for comprehensive 
Federal data collection on members of 
the LGBTQI+ communities. 
This bill, H.R. 4176, moves this coun-
try one step closer to equality and 
gives us the tools to see and support all 
of our communities, all of our constitu-
ents. 
I again urge my colleagues to support 
this bill. I thank the leadership of this 
body, our Speaker, our majority leader, 
and our Caucus chair, all of whom have 
played a role in supporting this legisla-
tion and moving it to a vote today. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, I am 
proud to rise in strong support of H.R. 4176, 
the LGBTQI+ Data Inclusion Act, and to dis-
cuss my amendment to this legislation. 
Despite significant legal advances over the 
past several years, including marriage equal-
ity, LGBTQI+ Americans remain vulnerable to 
discrimination on a daily basis. 
Today, only 21 states have laws that explic-
itly prohibit discrimination based on sexual ori-
entation in employment, housing, and public 
accommodations, and only 20 states have 
such protections for gender identity. 
In most states, a same-sex couple can get 
married on Saturday, then be legally denied 
service at a restaurant on Sunday, then be 
fired from their jobs on Monday, and evicted 
from their apartment on Tuesday. 
Our country is comprised of trans people of 
color, lesbians living with a disability, gay im-
migrants, and those experiencing all other 
manners of intersecting and layering levels of 
oppression and privilege. 
H.R. 4176 would make note of these stories 
and add their voices to the mosaic of our 
country. 
The data available through these newly de-
veloped federal surveys will allow federal 
agencies to create better policies and prac-
tices designed to accommodate the needs of 
all our Nation’s people. 
I am conscious of the fact that if Congress 
expects the LGBTQI+ community to trust the 
federal government with their information, we 
must ensure their privacy and protection. 
It is imperative that this data not be used to 
exclude, discriminate against, vilify, ostracize, 
or in any other way negatively impact anyone 
in this already vulnerable community. 
That is a promise we make today. 
Again, I remind you of the long path to full 
equality we walk. Let it be known, however, 
that one day our Nation will find itself knocking 
on equality’s door. 
When that happens, future LGBTQI+ Ameri-
cans will look back and see themselves not 
hidden in shame, but present. 
Present in our census, in our housing sur-
veys, in our employment surveys. 
They will be present in our metropolitan cit-
ies and in our rural towns, from the Atlantic 
beaches to the Pacific Northwest. From the 
forests of Alaska to the plains of my own 
Texas. 
Through the LGBTQI+ Data Inclusion Act, 
LGBTQI+ Americans will be able to say—I 
was there. I am here. 
It is high time that we provide equal protec-
tion for all members of the LGBTQI+ commu-
nity in accordance with the 14th Amendment, 
which ensures equal protection for ALL Ameri-
cans. 
H.R. 4176 will take us one more step for-
ward in the decades-long journey towards 
equality by creating a toolkit through which our 
LGBTQI+ community members can be rep-
resented in demographic data collection—and 
ultimately protected under the law. 
This bill will require federal agencies to as-
sess the ways in which they document sexu-
ality, gender identity, and gender variance in 
surveys and provide new opportunities for 
LGBTQI+ individuals to self-identify them-
selves—all while ensuring the privacy and dig-
nity of the people involved. 
Though this legislation enacts a simple 
change on federal surveys, it represents a 
great gesture for our future. 
We are not just talking about numbers 
today. 
We are not just talking about percentages 
and ratios and clusters. 
We are talking about the documentation and 
legacy of the great diversity of this Nation, and 
about enacting tools through which that diver-
sity can be represented and protected. 
As you all know, representation is the bed-
rock of American democracy. 
If the government does not see you, how 
can it serve you? 
As we discuss this Act, I especially want to 
keep in mind the members of the LGBTQI+ 
community who experience the fluidity and 
intersectionality that are aspects of gender 
and sexual identity. 
Of course, gender and sexuality are just two 
facets of personhood. 
Race, religion, socio-economic status, geo-
graphic region, disability status, and culture all 
play a part in crafting identity. 
Madam Speaker, all of this is true about 
H.R. 4176, and yet, I encourage my col-
leagues in Congress to push for more. 
That is why I believe my amendment is very 
important. 
My amendment would direct the Comptroller 
General to issue a report to Congress about 
the impact of the implementation of this Act on 
the provision of services to LGBTQI+ persons. 
It would assess the impact of H.R. 4176 by 
ensuring transparency into the correlation be-
tween the provision of services and one’s gen-
der identity, sexual orientation, and variations 
in sex characteristics. 
Data collected through this Act would be 
used to monitor the flow of social services to 
LGBTQI+ communities. This will encourage 
the provision of services to the LGBTQI+ com-
munity, and if there are shortcomings, Con-
gress and the public will be informed of them 
so that they can be remedied soon thereafter. 
Despite our many gains, the United States 
is not always a welcoming place for individuals 
across 
the 
spectrum 
of 
genders 
and 
sexualities. 
This is especially true for those coming from 
un-affirming communities and families—those 
for whom living their authentic lives may come 
at the cost of social ties and support systems. 
For some, authenticity can be isolating. 
As my colleagues know, the depression and 
suicide rates of LGBTQI+ individuals are 
horrifically high. 
LGBTQI+ youth in particular are at greatest 
risk. 
In Texas, The Trevor Project saw nearly 
15,000 crisis contacts from LGBTQI+ youth in 
2021. 
Research consistently shows that trans and 
gay youth are more likely to experience de-
pression when living in un-affirming or dis-
criminatory environments. 
Alternatively, the presence of supportive 
close friends and family in the life of an 
LGBTQI+ youth has a direct positive impact 
on that youth’s self-esteem and overall health. 
That supportive person could be a teacher, 
an athletic coach, a mental health counselor, 
or a troop leader. 
The data available in H.R. 4176 could be 
used to help put more of these mentors in the 
lives of LGBTQ+ youth every day. 
The LGBTQI+ Data Inclusion Act would en-
able agencies that provide mental health and 
other social services to gain access to a 
wealth of information about the communities 
they serve, so that they can better serve the 
LGBTQI+ community. 
My amendment would allow us to see if 
they then use this data and their resources to 
safeguard the well-being of some of our Na-
tion’s most vulnerable individuals. 
Ultimately, the Comptroller General study 
required by my amendment enables Congress 
to monitor the progress of H.R. 4176 in action. 
It is with that in mind that I urge my col-
leagues to step forward in support of the 
LGBTQI+ Data Inclusion Act and my amend-
ment. 
Our lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, 
queer, and intersex communities deserve to 
be documented in our Nation’s history. They 
deserve to have their stories collected and 
used for their well-being. I am honored to be 
a part of that aim today.

Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker,

this legislation to the floor. 
Data collection is an indispensable 
tool to understand and address changes 
facing the LGBTQI community and 
other sexual- and gender-diverse com-

Madam Speaker, I include in the

an article from American 
Progress dated May 24, 2022. 
[From American Progress, May 24, 2022] 
COLLECTING
DATA
ABOUT
LGBTQI+ 
AND 
OTHER SEXUAL AND GENDER-DIVERSE COM-
MUNITIES 
Data collection is an indispensable tool to 
understand and address challenges facing 
LGBTQI+ and other sexual and gender-di-
verse communities. Although strides have 
been made in recent years, a persistent lack 
of routine data collection on sexual orienta-
tion, gender identity, and variations in sex 
characteristics (SOGISC) is still a substan-
tial roadblock for policymakers, researchers, 
service providers, and advocates seeking to 
improve 
the 
health 
and 
well-being 
of 
LGBTQI+ people. More comprehensive and 
accurate point-in-time and longitudinal de-
mographic data on SOGISC are crucial to: 
Advance research agendas; 
Evaluate population trends; 
Identify community-based needs; 
Provide high-quality services; 
Track and address discrimination; 
Equitably distribute funding and other re-
sources; and 
Shape evidence-based policy solutions to 
promote equity and reduce disparities faced 
by LGBTQI+ populations. 
As the size and diversity of LGBTQI+ popu-
lations in the United States continue to ex-
pand, particularly among youth and young 
adults, the importance of collecting data on 
these communities only continues to grow. 
Failing to collect these data can create 
harms by hindering the ability of research-
ers, policymakers, service providers, and ad-
vocates to understand the experiences of 
LGBTQI+ communities, identify disparities, 
generate policies that promote equity, and 
evaluate the effectiveness of those policies. 
Yet currently, the number of federally fund-
ed surveys that include questions to identify 
LGBTQI+ respondents is limited. 
While there are many kinds of data rel-
evant to the experiences of LGBTQI+ com-
munities, this report focuses specifically on 
data collection to capture SOGISC in two 
types of settings: general population surveys 
and surveys of LGBTQI+ communities. Gen-
eral population surveys assess a large sample 
of the entire population, of which the major-
ity identify as cisgender and heterosexual 
and will not have intersex traits. In con-
trast, LGBTQI+ community-based surveys 
sample a population predominantly com-
prising sexual and gender minorities. Com-
munity-based surveys can provide important 
opportunities to learn more about even 
smaller or less-studied sexual and gender mi-
nority populations, such as people who are 
asexual, same-gender-loving, or Two-Spirit. 
Because of their specific focus on sampling 
LGBTQI+ 
populations, 
community-based 
surveys may also be more likely to reach 
larger 
proportions 
of 
groups 
such 
as 
LGBTQI+ people of color, older adults, 
youth, people with disabilities, people re-
ceiving social welfare support services, peo-
ple whose primary language is not English, 
and people interacting with the criminal 
legal system. 
When designing questions to accurately 
and effectively survey either the general 
population or a predominantly LGBTQI+ 
population, researchers must carefully weigh 
a number of key considerations that are ex-
plained in this report. Regardless of the type 
of survey, however, it is imperative to ensure 
the following: 
Entities collecting demographic data, in-
cluding data related to SOGISC, do so with a 
specific and well-defined goal, such as col-
lecting statistics on health experiences or 
understanding the performance of a govern-
ment benefit program. 
Data are collected, used, maintained, and 
shared only with strong privacy, confiden-
tiality, and ethical standards in place to 
minimize the risk of data disclosure and mis-
use. 
Entities collecting data adopt and post 
clear nondiscrimination and confidentiality 
policies. These policies should identify rel-
evant legal nondiscrimination protections; 
state why the data are being collected and 
how they will be used; share contact infor-
mation for resources to enforce protections; 
and provide assurance that confidentiality 
will be respected and that participation is 
voluntary, allowing respondents to provide 
well-informed consent with the knowledge 
that disclosure is voluntary and that they 
have the right to opt out of responding. 
Research and researchers comply with and 
are certified through the Collaborative Insti-
tutional Training Initiative and consult 
community-based resources about how to 
conduct effective and ethical research with 
LGBTQI+ populations that ensures minority 
populations have a voice and role in the de-
sign of survey questions. 
LGBTQI+ people are meaningfully involved 
in question development, testing, and the 
evaluation process. 
This report examines best practices and 
key considerations for collecting data on 
SOGISC in both general population surveys 
as well as LGBTQI+ community-based sur-
veys. The first section of the report high-
lights evidence related to asking these ques-
tions in general population surveys and ex-
amines critical considerations, as well as 
avenues of future research that policy-
makers and researchers should support. The 
second section of the report compiles both 
evidence from existing survey designs and 
interviews with LGBTQI+ individuals to cre-
ate new suggestions and recommendations 
for SOGISC question design in surveys of 
LGBTQI+ communities. Ultimately, improv-
ing SOGISC data collection through these 
kinds of general population and community- 
based instruments is crucial to identifying 
disparities and crafting policy solutions that 
promote 
more 
equitable 
outcomes 
for 
LGBTQI+ communities. 
General population surveys are used to col-
lect data from representative samples of the 
population, allowing researchers to create 
population estimates, describe population 
demographics, assess disparities, compute 
statistical weights for survey analysis, and 
develop policy, program, and funding prior-
ities. Federal, state, and local governments 
rely on data from general population surveys 
such as the decennial census, the American 
Community Survey (ACS), and the Current 
Population Survey (CPS) for everything 
from allocating budget resources to deciding 
where to locate hospitals. 
The persistent lack of routine data collec-
tion on SOGISC remains a significant chal-
lenge for policymakers, researchers, service 
providers, and advocates seeking to improve 
the health and well-being of LGBTQI+ peo-
ple. Currently, most surveys, including those 
fielded by the U.S. federal government and 
many state governments, do not collect 
SOGISC information. While some surveys, 
such as the census and the ACS, now invite 
people to answer questions about their mar-
ital status or living arrangements in ways 
that allow researchers to identify same-sex 
couples, this only captures a small segment 
of the LGBTQI+ population. By not asking 
specific questions about SOGISC, these sur-
veys fail to account for single LGB people or 
LGB people who are in a relationship but not 
cohabitating with their partner(s), as well as 
transgender people and intersex people alto-
gether. For example, according to the latest 
Gallup data, just 10 percent of LGBT adults 
in the United States are married to a same- 
sex spouse, while an additional 6 percent live 
with a same-sex domestic partner. This 
means that more than 5 in 6 LGBT adults 
cannot be identified by existing questions in 
nonexperimental surveys conducted by the 
U.S. Census Bureau such as the ACS and the 
census, which only account for cohabitating 
same-sex couples. Failing to collect SOGISC 
data creates real harms—hindering the abil-
ity to fully understand the experiences of 
LGBTQI+ communities; to craft sound poli-
cies that are inclusive of LGBTQI+ people 
and their needs; and to evaluate the effec-
tiveness of policies to address disparities and 
promote more equitable outcomes. 
More than 5 in 6 LGBT adults cannot be 
identified by existing questions in nonexperi-
mental surveys conducted by the U.S. Census 
Bureau such as the ACS and the census. 
As recommended by the National Acad-
emies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine 
in their 2020 report, U.S. population surveys 
must routinely collect, analyze, and report 
demographic data that include SOGISC ques-
tions. The information gathered by general 
population surveys shapes major policy deci-
sions and allocations of critical resources re-
lated to health care, housing, employment, 
education, and other services and benefits, 
affecting the everyday lives of LGBTQI+ peo-
ple and making the need to adopt SOGISC 
measures even more urgent. Notably, ex-
panding data collection on SOGISC through 
government population-based surveys will 
result in a larger sample size than in pri-
vately conducted surveys. This is important 
because larger samples allow for better, 
more reliable study and a richer under-
standing of the diversity of the LGBTQI+ 
community. Moreover, having larger sam-
ples will facilitate analysis and provide 
greater comprehension of the experiences of 
populations that are living at the intersec-
tion of multiple marginalized identities. 
Expanding and enhancing SOGISC data 
collection also provides critical tools nec-
essary to craft policy solutions to improve 
outcomes and advance equity. By improving 
data collection on LGBTQI+ populations, 
government agencies can take meaningful 
steps to fulfill the directives set out by exec-
utive orders 13988 and 13985, which President 
Joe Biden signed on day one of his presi-
dency. 
LGBTQI+ advocates have long called for 
the federal government and researchers to 
add SOGISC questions to major surveys and 
other data collection efforts as a way to 
begin addressing the deficiency of data on 
LGBTQI+ populations and gaps in knowledge 
and policy affecting LGBTQI+ people. Gov-
ernment officials, researchers, and others 
have questioned whether the general popu-
lation, composed mainly of non-LGBTQI+ 
people, would understand these questions, 
answer them accurately, or even refuse to 
answer them. The answers to these questions 
are important because they affect the qual-
ity of data gathered about LGBTQI+ people 
and, by extension, the resources allocated, 
decisions made, and policies created that af-
fect LGBTQI+ communities.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5864 
June 23, 2022 
Importantly, numerous federally supported 
entities and other expert bodies have issued 
reports to determine methodological best 
practices 
and 
improve 
measurement 
of 
SOGISC in federal surveys. These groups 
have contributed to a robust and continually 
growing body of research providing evidence 
that SOGISC questions can be readily de-
ployed in federally funded and other surveys. 
For example, evidence indicates that: 
Sexual orientation and gender identity 
data are not considered especially difficult 
or sensitive for survey respondents to report, 
meaning that people generally understand 
what the questions are asking and are will-
ing to answer them. 
Securing participation of sexual minorities 
in surveys does not require higher levels of 
effort, meaning it will not create added costs 
or obstacles that would prohibit the govern-
ment or other researchers from conducting 
more inclusive data collection. 
People with intersex traits appear willing 
to disclose their status and support col-
lecting data on this measure in research. 
People will answer sexual orientation and 
gender identity questions even across a vari-
ety of modes (for example, telephone surveys 
and paper surveys) and via both self-report-
ing and proxy reporting (for example, when a 
single household member responds on behalf 
of all household members) in federal large- 
scale general population surveys. 
In other words, existing evidence addresses 
many of the major hesitations or questions 
posed by government researchers and others. 
Put simply, while more research is needed to 
continue improving SOGISC measures, evi-
dence suggests these questions can function 
well in major general population surveys, 
and they should be asked. For example, in 
2021, the Census Bureau updated its experi-
mental data collection effort on the COVID– 
l9 pandemic to include questions about sex-
ual orientation and gender identity in the 
Household Pulse Survey. This historic step 
marks the first time a Census Bureau-spon-
sored survey has asked sexual orientation 
and gender identity questions and highlights 
the ways in which these questions can—and 
do—work in large, nationally representative 
surveys. Expanding LGBTQI+-inclusive data 
collection by asking SOGISC questions on 
general population surveys is paramount to 
advancing equity for LGBTQI+ communities. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, 
I include in the RECORD an article from 
the National Education Association, 
‘‘New Survey Data Shows LGBTQ+ 
Youth Mental Health Crisis.’’ 
[From the National Education Association, 
May 25, 2022] 
NEW SURVEY DATA SHOWS LGBTQ+ YOUTH 
MENTAL HEALTH CRISIS 
Last year, nearly half of LGBTQ+ youth 
seriously considered killing themselves, in-
cluding more than half of trans youth, ac-
cording to new data from The Trevor 
Project. 
These figures reveal a deadly, mental- 
health crisis among high school and college- 
age LGBTQ+ youth of all races, which has 
been worsened by the Covid–19 pandemic and 
by recent, political attacks on LGBTQ+ stu-
dents by state legislators across the nation. 
‘‘The [Trevor Project] study is actually on 
my computer screen right now to send it to 
my colleagues,’’ says Florida high school 
teacher Michael Woods, whose state recently 
passed a law that enables parents to sue 
school districts for teaching LGBTQ-positive 
curriculum. ‘‘Especially here in Florida, 
with the ‘Don’t Say Gay’ law, which should 
also be called ‘Don’t Say Trans,’ we have a 
lot of kids in stress,’’ he says. 
The study, which involved 35,000 LGBTQ+ 
high school and college-age youth, of various 
races and identities, also shows how schools 
and colleges can help. A little more than half 
of LGBTQ+ youth identified their school or 
college as ‘‘an LGBTQ-affirming space’’—and 
those students reported lower rates of at-
tempted suicide. Even something as simple 
as using the correct pronouns—the ones that 
match students’ gender identify—can de-
crease suicidal ideas. 
‘‘Small steps can make a big difference,’’ 
says Joe Bento, a Seattle high school teach-
er who also is chair of the Washington state 
chapter of GLSEN, a national organization 
that helps educators make schools more af-
firming for LGBTQ+ students. 
The Trevor Project data shows how things 
have gone from bad to worse for LGBTQ+ 
youth in the past two years. In 2019, 40 per-
cent of LGBTQ+ seriously considered suicide; 
in 2021, the rate hit 45 percent. 
And it’s even scarier among students of 
color. About one in five Black LGBTQ+ stu-
dents attempted suicide last year, as did a 
slightly higher rate of Indigenous LGBTQ+ 
students. 
Meanwhile, mental-health care is scarce. 
Nearly half of LGBTQ+ youth—and more 
than half of Latino LGBTQ+ students—told 
the Trevor Project that they wanted coun-
seling and didn’t get it. 
The pandemic is an obvious factor, edu-
cators 
say. 
When 
colleges 
and 
schools 
switched to virtual learning, many LGBTQ+ 
students were closeted in homes where their 
identities are hidden. (Only 1 in 3 LGBTQ+ 
youth 
said 
they 
have 
LGBTQ-affirming 
homes.) These students may have lost access 
to counselors or other supports, like a Gay- 
Straight Alliance or GenderSexuality Alli-
ance (GSA) club. 
‘‘For a lot of queer students, school is their 
safe space,’’ says Bento. ‘‘For a year and a 
half, they weren’t in that safe space.’’ 
Now, students are back on campuses, in 
school buildings—but that doesn’t mean ev-
erything is okay, notes Bento. After two 
years of pandemic-related isolation and trau-
ma, students desperately need mental-health 
support ‘‘When we got back, that didn’t nec-
essarily happen,’’ he says. ‘‘Suddenly it’s 
state testing! And it’s this, this, this! Every-
thing is ‘back to normal,’ but normal was 
garbage.’’ 
Many students are suffering. But it’s al-
most always the most marginalized students 
who have the least access to mental-health 
supports, Bento points out. 
It’s not just the pandemic. Making matters 
worse for LGBTQ students, nearly 240 anti- 
LGBTQ+ bills have been filed this year in 
state legislatures, most of them targeting 
trans people, according to an NBC News 
analysis. 
Many of these bills have been signed into 
laws that ban trans women and girls from 
participating in high school sports, prohibit 
trans students from using school bathrooms 
and locker rooms that match their gender 
identity, and restrict LGBTQ-positive school 
curriculum. For example, Florida’s new law 
enables parents to sue districts if they think 
their child has had inappropriate instruction 
on gender and sexuality. The cost of litiga-
tion will be borne by districts, which already 
are removing curricula. 
LGBTQ+ students are very aware of laws 
that seek to harm them, educators say—and 
it causes them anguish. ‘‘They’re just com-
ing back to the rigors of school [after the 
pandemic]—and now this!’’ says Woods. 
NEA and its affiliates strongly oppose 
these laws. This spring, NEA President 
Becky Pringle wrote an open letter to Flor-
ida students, published in the Sun-Sentinel 
newspaper. ‘‘From protests to walkouts, you 
are bravely showing these politicians that 
you aren’t afraid to stand up for yourselves 
. . . To our students in Florida and else-
where: We see you! We hear you! We are with 
you!’’ 
For his part, Woods, an educator of 29 
years, isn’t afraid either. He wears his 
‘‘We’re All Human’’ t-shirt and answers his 
students’ distressed questions. But he wor-
ries about younger teachers with less job se-
curity, living in more conservative areas. 
Many may feel like they can’t be the edu-
cators that students need. 
‘‘When young people don’t feel like they 
have anywhere to turn or anyone to talk to 
. . . well, I know why the stats are the way 
they are,’’ he says. 
NEA members and their unions are work-
ing hard to get more supports for students. 
In St. Paul, Minn., educators went to the 
brink of striking this spring to protect the 
presence of mental-health teams in every St. 
Paul school. Other K12 unions—like in 
Natrona County, Wyo.—are making sure fed-
eral pandemic-relief funds are spent to hire 
more school counselors and other profes-
sionals. 
Recently, the Biden administration urged 
colleges and universities to do the same with 
their money. 
But it’s also possible for individual edu-
cators to create affirming spaces in their of-
fices, classrooms, buses, and other spaces. 
‘‘Words matter,’’ says Bento, who introduces 
himself to his students like this: ‘‘My name 
is Mr. Bento. I use he/him pronouns.’’ 
Safe space posters are great at signaling 
that you support your LGBTQ+ students but 
may not be allowable in all places. ‘‘In those 
places, you can still put something on your 
body, like a lanyard,’’ says Bento. (The NEA 
LGBTQ+ caucus, of which Bento is a mem-
ber, offers ‘‘Safe Person, Safe Space’’ cards 
for educators to put in their lanyards.) 
Bento uses the word ‘‘partner,’’ instead of 
boyfriend or girlfriend, a subtle nod to the 
fact that not every relationship looks the 
same and that some students may not iden-
tify as male or female. ‘‘Think about who is 
not represented [in your words, in your cur-
riculum],’’ urges Bento. 
Yes, 
curriculum 
matters, 
too. 
(See 
GLSEN’s inclusive curriculum resource.) 
‘‘Students need curriculum that reflects who 
they are, they need positive representation,’’ 
says Bento. ‘‘And not just Harvey Milk! Not 
just the AIDS epidemic! Where’s the joy?’’ 
In fact, The Trevor Project asked LGBTQ+ 
youth the same question: ‘‘Where do you find 
joy?’’ The responses can guide educators in 
creating better spaces for all students. An-
swers include: 
Learning about LGBTQ history; 
Learning I’m not alone and there are more 
people like me; 
Supportive teachers; 
Having a safe space to express gender, gen-
der identity, and sexuality; 
LGBTQ clubs on campus; and 
Living as their authentic self.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5865 
June 23, 2022 
Americans experienced prior to the pan-
demic have continued to endure 18 months 
in. For some, those disparities have grown 
deeper. 
According to the data, which captures re-
sults from July 21 to September 13, LGBTQ+ 
people often reported being more likely than 
non-LGBTQ+ people to have lost employ-
ment, not have enough to eat, be at elevated 
risk of eviction or foreclosure, and face dif-
ficulty paying for basic household expenses, 
according to the census’ Household Pulse 
Survey, a report that measures how Ameri-
cans are faring on key economic markers 
during the pandemic. 
While think tanks like the Williams Insti-
tute at the UCLA School of Law and advo-
cate-led research groups have previously 
studied LGBTQ+ poverty, no large govern-
ment population surveys, like those con-
ducted by the census or the Treasury Depart-
ment, 
have 
attempted 
to 
capture 
the 
realtime economic experiences of LGBTQ+ 
people. 
Previously, those analyses were limited to 
studies of ‘‘same-sex couples,’’ a question the 
census began analyzing with limited success 
in 1990, but that leaves out significant por-
tion of LGBTQ+ people. Lack of accurate 
data on the population as a whole—and par-
ticularly on transgender people, a group that 
has been chronically under surveyed—ham-
pered any federal response to persisting in-
equities, advocates say. 
‘‘Having this on [the Pulse survey], both as 
a way to understand what’s going on during 
the pandemic, but also hopefully as a start-
ing point to more federal data collection, is 
really an important moment,’’ said Bianca 
D.M. Wilson, the senior scholar of public pol-
icy at the Williams Institute. 
The data has only begun to be collected, 
and it’s still too early to tell whether the 
differences between groups are representa-
tive of the LGBTQ+ population overall or 
just those who were surveyed by the census 
at a given moment in time. 
While researchers cautioned against draw-
ing major conclusions, the trends that 
emerge in the data are consistent with what 
other surveys have found prior to the pan-
demic as a result of employment discrimina-
tion, underpay, discriminatory lending prac-
tices and other policies that have limited 
economic mobility for queer people. 
According to The 19th’s analysis of the 
first four releases of data from the census 
survey, as much as 23 percent of LGBTQ+ 
people and 32 percent of trans people re-
ported having lost employment in the month 
before the census conducted its question-
naire. About 15 to 16 percent of non-LGBTQ+ 
people reported the same. 
About 12 percent of LGBTQ+ people said 
they sometimes or often did not have enough 
to eat. For non-LGBTQ+ people, the figure 
was between 6 and 7 percent, and for trans 
Americans, it was as high as 24 percent. 
About 31 percent of queer people also said 
they had difficulty paying for basic house-
hold expenses; for non-LGBTQ+ people it was 
23 percent. 
Housing insecurity was prevalent across 
all groups, with more than 40 percent of peo-
ple—both LGBTQ+ and non-LGBTQ+—saying 
they were very or somewhat likely to face 
eviction by the end of September or October. 
It’s unclear how accurate the data for 
transgender Americans is because the sample 
sizes are much smaller. But it does follow 
what is already known: Roughly 29 percent 
of respondents to the 2015 U.S. Transgender 
Survey, done by the National Center for 
Transgender Equality and seen as the only 
comprehensive study of its kind, said they 
lived in poverty. About 30 percent said they 
had experienced homelessness in their life-
times. 
‘‘These are sort of the systemic disparities 
that we observed pre-pandemic, that the pan-
demic has not only deepened for both groups, 
but also sort of widened,’’ said David 
Schwegman, assistant professor of public 
policy and administration at American Uni-
versity, who has conducted research on 
‘‘same-sex couples’’ and housing discrimina-
tion. 
Wilson at the Williams Institute said that 
absent this kind of large-scale data collec-
tion about LGBTQ+ people, policymakers 
couldn’t truly answer big questions about 
whether attempts to address economic stress 
exacerbated by the pandemic—like the now- 
expired federal eviction moratorium—were 
working for everyone. 
But data collection is only one step toward 
equity. 
Dean Spade, an associate professor at Se-
attle University School of Law who has also 
advised the upcoming National LGBTQ+ 
Women’s Community Survey by think tank 
Justice Work, said that real change requires 
more than just counting trans and LGBTQ+ 
people at the federal level. 
Counting marginalized people to better un-
derstand the issues they face doesn’t nec-
essarily mean their suffering will be ad-
dressed through policy, he noted—and trans 
people are accustomed to social services 
leaving them out or not being designed with 
them in mind. It’s why trans people, for ex-
ample, are helping each other pay for med-
ical procedures that aren’t covered by insur-
ance, housing those experiencing homeless-
ness and creating mutual aid networks, 
Spade said. 
‘‘We’re helping each other survive right 
now,’’ he said. 
And there are still significant challenges 
with the data as it is. Samples sizes are 
small, an issue that has barred marginalized 
communities, including Asian women, Na-
tive Americans and Pacific Islander women, 
from representation in real-time data on 
some national surveys. 
Those small sample sizes make it difficult 
to draw big conclusions from the data until 
months down the line. The Census Bureau 
said in a statement that it currently doesn’t 
have additional analysis to offer on the data, 
though it did publish a report on the first set 
of LGBTQ+ data this summer, finding that 
LGBTQ+ people are more likely than non- 
LGBTQ+ people to face economic hardship. 
‘‘The primary focus has been on collecting 
and releasing data in a timely manner but 
there are plans in the future to release data 
products that will provide additional con-
text,’’ the bureau said in a statement. 
The other challenge has been crafting 
questions in a way that takes into account 
knowledge gaps people may have about what 
terminology best describes them. 
The census survey, for example, asks re-
spondents to choose which best represents 
how they think of themselves: ‘‘gay or les-
bian’’; ‘‘bisexual’’; ‘‘something else’’; ‘‘I 
don’t know’’; or ‘‘straight, that is not gay or 
lesbian.’’ In past attempts to phrase these 
questions, heterosexual people have been 
found 
to 
incorrectly 
mark 
themselves, 
economists said, so additional phrases have 
been added to improve clarity. 
The survey also asks if people describe 
themselves as male, female or transgender, 
and some transgender people may not want 
to identify themselves given the rise in anti- 
trans bills across the country, Schwegman 
said. 
Spade pointed to smaller studies led by ad-
vocates as important pools of information 
that can’t be found anywhere else, since they 
ask questions about daily threats like over- 
policing and poverty. 
‘‘I think that those kinds of studies can be, 
to a lot of us, more valuable than something 
larger that didn’t ask the questions or that 
missed whole groups of people in our commu-
nity,’’ he said. 
The real-time data from surveys like the 
current census one, which will be collecting 
responses from July 21 to October 11, could 
help impact policies in real time. The prob-
lem for pandemic-related policies being ne-
gotiated in Congress this fall is that this 
data may be coming too late, Wilson said. 
‘‘It’s 18 months into the pandemic, and had 
that been the starting place, we would not be 
looking at a sample size that would create 
problems for all the analyses that we want 
to do to understand a trans-specific experi-
ence,’’ Wilson said. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, 
my amendment would direct the Comp-
troller General to issue a report to 
Congress about the impact of the im-
plementation of this act on the provi-
sion of services to LGBTQI+ persons. It 
would ensure the impact of H.R. 4176 by 
ensuring transparency in the correla-
tion between the provision of services 
and one’s gender identity, sexual ori-
entation, and variation in sex charac-
teristics. 
Again, I have emphasized, we want to 
have truth and discussion here. We 
want to be helpful. We want to affirm 
people and have them counted. Data 
collection through this act will be used 
to monitor the flow of social services 
to LGBTQI communities. 
This will encourage the provision of 
services to the LGBTQI+ community, 
and if there are shortcomings, Congress 
and the public will be informed of them 
so that they can be remedied soon 
thereafter. 
Despite our many gains, the United 
States is not always a welcoming place 
for individuals across many spectrums. 
This is essentially true for those com-
ing from unaffirming communities and 
families, those for whom living their 
authentic lives may come at the cost of 
social ties and support systems. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues 
to support this amendment because it 
affirms children, families, our fellow 
colleagues, our soldiers, law enforce-
ment, first responders, firefighters, 
teachers, people who see us in the re-
tail area. It affirms America. This 
knowledge about who we are can be 
enormously helpful to being a better 
America. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues 
to support the Jackson Lee amend-
ment, and I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. For 
what purpose does the gentleman seek 
recognition? 
Mr. COMER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
in opposition to the amendment offered 
by Congresswoman JACKSON LEE. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from Kentucky is recognized 
for 5 minutes. 
Mr. COMER. Madam Speaker, the 
amendment admits that the ultimate 
purpose of this bill is to steer tax-
payers’ hard-earned dollars to yet an-
other demographic subgroup. 
The amendment requires GAO to re-
port on how the bill will impact Fed-
eral agency provision of services to in-
dividuals—in other words, how Federal

grant programs and financial assist-
ance will be provided based on people’s 
sexual orientation and gender identity. 
House Republicans believe that all 
Americans deserve equal treatment 
and respect. In fact, that is guaranteed 
under our Constitution. We oppose the 
continual dividing of Americans for po-
litical purposes. This amendment is 
pure identity politics and an abuse of 
taxpayer dollars. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to vote against this amend-
ment, and I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, 
I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman 
from New York (Mrs. CAROLYN
B. 
MALONEY), 
the 
distinguished 
chair-
woman of the full committee. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Madam Speaker, I rise in support 
of the Jackson Lee amendment. 
This amendment would require re-
porting to Congress on the impact of 
data collection on the LGBTQI+ popu-
lations, facilitated by this act, and the 
provision of services extended to those 
groups. 
As the chair of the Committee on 
Oversight and Reform, I am committed 
to ensuring the effectiveness and effi-
ciency of government operations for all 
Americans. Reporting on the impacts 
of H.R. 4176 will provide transparency 
into the data collection and help in-
form our policymaking efforts. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to support this amendment. 
Mr. COMER. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, 
may I inquire how much time remains 
on each side. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tlewoman from Texas has 2 minutes re-
maining. The gentleman from Ken-
tucky has 4 minutes remaining. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, 
let me offer what we are living in. 
There are more than 300 laws that have 
been passed across the Nation that are 
discriminating against the LGBTQI+ 
community. In addition, we find that 
less than half of these 50 States are 
protecting 
this 
community. 
That 
means that there is a half loaf for 
many in this community. 
How do we remedy and educate 
States and local communities? We do 
so by ensuring that information is 
given. That is how you protect tax-
payer dollars, that you are construc-
tive in the use of dollars. 
This is only to help with better im-
plementation of social services that 
are already rendered, but such social 
services may not be geared toward ad-
dressing some of the populations here 
in the United States. 
My amendment, which is what we al-
ways ask for, is making sure that we 
are accountable when we are address-
ing the concerns that have not been ad-
dressed in the LGBTQI+ community. 
That is what I hope most people will 
see. But at the same time, I hope my 
amendment characterizes what Amer-
ica is: a compassionate, with passion, 
caring, and humanitarian Nation. 
We go all over the world to fight for 
human rights, justice, and equality. 
Our soldiers put on the uniform to dig-
nify our Constitution. Why not here in 
America? 
Do my friends on the other side of 
the aisle realize how many men and 
women in the United States military 
come from the LGBTQI+ community? 
They didn’t ask questions; they put on 
the uniform. I know they fought really 
hard not to have questions asked. 
I ask my colleagues to support the 
Jackson Lee amendment for account-
ability and fairness and to recognize all 
of us are Americans. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to House Resolution 1191, the pre-
vious 
question

woman from Texas (Ms. JACKSON LEE).

AMENDMENT NO. 2 OFFERED BY MRS. CAROLYN 
B. MALONEY OF NEW YORK 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. It is now 
in order to consider amendment No. 2 
printed in part B of House Report 117– 
381. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Madam Speaker, Representative 
SEAN PATRICK MALONEY has an amend-
ment at the desk, and I am his des-
ignee. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Clerk will designate the amendment. 
The text of the amendment is as fol-
lows: 
Page 4, line 22, insert after ‘‘proxy’’ the fol-
lowing: ‘‘(including a proxy of a deceased in-
dividual, if applicable)’’. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to House Resolution 1191, the gen-
tlewoman from New York (Mrs. CARO-
LYN B. MALONEY) and a Member op-
posed each will control 5 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from New York. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Madam Speaker, I yield myself 
such time as I may consume. 
Today, I rise in support of this 
amendment that clarifies the Federal 
surveys governed by this bill can and 
should collect data on deceased LGBTQ 
individuals when applicable. 
As we know, due to mistreatment 
and being stigmatized, LGBTQ+ youth 
are over four times more likely to at-
tempt suicide than their peers. 
In recent years, the number of vio-
lent fatal attacks against transgender 
people have hit record highs. But im-
portantly, the actual number of fatal 
attacks is widely believed to be under-
counted. Allowing a proxy of a de-
ceased person to respond to a Federal 
survey can right this wrong. 
Federal surveys often do not collect 
key demographic information on those 
they study, such as the gender identity 
or sexual orientation of a deceased per-
son. As a result, we as policymakers do 
not have the full picture and cannot 
accurately identify disparities or cre-
ate policy solutions that serve each 
person we represent. 
For example, the Justice Depart-
ment’s National Crime Victimization 
Survey only asks questions about the 
victim’s sexual orientation but not 
about their gender identity. 
This potentially severe undercount of 
targeted 
violence 
against 
the 
transgender community has left us 
making policies with one hand tied be-
hind our backs. 
This amendment ensures that re-
searchers and policymakers can under-
stand 
the 
experiences 
of 
deceased 
LGBTQ individuals and make more in-
formed decisions as we fight for equal-
ity and justice under the law. 
Madam Speaker, I urge support of 
this amendment, and I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. COMER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
in opposition to the amendment. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from Kentucky is recognized 
for 5 minutes. 
Mr. COMER. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Madam Speaker, this amendment 
stoops to the lowest level possible—in 
fact, 6 feet under. 
It is bad enough that under H.R. 4176, 
House Democrats seek to subject living 
people, including children, to intrusive 
and inappropriate questions related to 
their private sexual orientation and 
gender identity. It is especially trou-
blesome that House Democrats would 
allow proxies to answer such sensitive 
questions on behalf of others, as this 
bill 
allows. 
But 
shockingly, 
this 
amendment expands that authority to 
allow proxies to answer survey or Cen-
sus questions about sexual orientation 
and gender identity on behalf of dead 
Americans. 
If someone claims to be a ‘‘knowl-
edgeable proxy,’’ this amendment per-
mits that individual to answer a Fed-
eral survey on behalf of a deceased per-
son who can no longer answer for him-
self or herself. 
With this amendment, someone who 
has guarded their personal privacy 
their entire life will have to worry that 
sensitive aspects of their personal life 
will be shared with the Federal Govern-
ment after they die or worry that it 
could even be made up. How is col-
lecting this information even useful at 
all?

tiality’’ the following: ‘‘, including protocols 
for anonymizing data collected and destroy-
ing personally-identifiable information at 
the appropriate time and not later than 
three years after the date on which the infor-
mation is collected’’. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to House Resolution 1191, the gen-
tlewoman from New York (Mrs. CARO-
LYN B. MALONEY) and a Member op-
posed each will control 5 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from New York. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Madam Speaker, this straight-
forward amendment requires the agen-
cies collecting information through 
this bill to create standards and proto-
cols for anonymizing and destroying 
personally identifiable information at 
the appropriate time. 
This amendment is a strong addition 
to the underlying bill, as it ensures 
that the necessary demographic infor-
mation collected will be responsibly 
destroyed to fully protect an individ-
ual’s privacy. 
Complete and accurate data collec-
tion is essential to informing policies, 
laws, and programs that address the 
needs of our communities. 
Individuals who identify as LGBTQI+ 
have been underrepresented in Federal 
data collection efforts for generations. 
This critical information has been 
missing from this community in all 
areas of data collection and has led to 
worsened outcomes compared to indi-
viduals who are fully counted in Fed-
eral data collection. 
I am proud to support this common-
sense pro-privacy amendment, and I 
urge my colleagues to do the same. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. COMER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
in opposition to the amendment. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from Kentucky is recognized 
for 5 minutes. 
Mr. COMER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
in opposition to the amendment which 
ironically highlights the underlying 
bill’s serious intrusion into Americans’ 
privacy. 
When the government collects very 
personal and sensitive information, as 
H.R. 4176 seeks to recklessly expand, 
Americans’ data regrettably becomes 
the target of malicious actors. 
Too often, we see this story play out 
in our government, the over-collection 
of 
Americans’ 
private 
information 
being hacked or improperly disclosed. 
From the leaking of Americans’ tax 
records to the breach of Federal em-
ployees’ entire background investiga-
tion files, the Federal government does 
not have a very good track record of 
securing private data. Yet, this amend-
ment allows government agencies to 
place Americans’ most private data at 
risk for up to 3 entire years. 
Republicans will not stand for sub-
jecting Americans’ most private infor-
mation to cyber hackers and other 
wrongdoers, information that should 
not even be collected in the first place. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to vote against this amend-
ment, and I yield back the balance of 
my time.

HONORING SENATOR CLAIBORNE 
PELL’S LEGACY 
(Mr. LANGEVIN asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. LANGEVIN. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to celebrate the 50th anniversary 
of the Pell grant, a Federal program 
named after my mentor, role model, 
and friend, the late Senator Claiborne 
Pell, who proudly served Rhode Island 
for 40 years in the United States Sen-
ate. 
Senator Pell was one of Rhode Is-
land’s finest statesmen who embodied 
the highest ideals of public service. He 
was also a fierce advocate of education 
and deeply believed in supporting the 
next generation of American leaders. 
In fact, one of the reasons I am here 
today is because of Senator Pell. 
When I interned in his office as a 19- 
year-old college student, Senator Pell 
placed his faith in me, and it was one 
of the things that inspired me to run 
for office myself. 
It is only fitting that the grant pro-
gram which bears Senator Pell’s name 
is now the single largest source of Fed-
eral grant aid for undergraduate stu-
dents. 
Last year, over 6 million students re-
ceived $27 billion in Pell grants to help 
them complete a college degree. Pell 
grants have made higher education ac-
cessible and affordable for tens of mil-
lions of Americans, which I know made 
Senator Pell enormously proud. 
Mr. Speaker, it has been 13 years 
since we lost Senator Pell, but his re-
markable legacy lives on. 
f 
CELEBRATING 50TH ANNIVERSARY 
OF PELL GRANTS 
(Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania 
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend his remarks.) 
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. 
Mr. Speaker, today is the 50th anniver-
sary of the Pell Grant Program. 
This program was authorized in 1972 
to provide direct financial aid to low- 
income students for access to higher 
education and the opportunity to pur-
sue their full potential. 
The effort that year was bipartisan, 
and the program maintains bipartisan 
support today, 50 years later. 
More than 80 million students have 
received the Pell grant to attend col-
lege, and currently, 7 million students, 
about 40 percent of undergraduates, are 
utilizing the Pell grant to earn a de-
gree today. 
At Pennsylvania’s land-grant institu-
tion, Penn State University, annually, 
about 18,000 students are using the Pell 
grant to access and afford a great de-
gree at 20 undergraduate campuses 
throughout the Commonwealth, includ-
ing two Penn State campuses in the 
counties I serve. 
Mr. Speaker, for individuals, this 
program is critically important to ac-
cess and affordability, but it also en-
courages degree completion, on-time 
graduation, and lower levels of student 
debt. For the Nation, this program is 
an essential investment to maintaining 
and strengthening our Nation’s skilled 
workforce and enhancing global eco-
nomic competitiveness. 
f 
RECOGNIZING AND 
CONGRATULATING SKEEK FRAZEE 
(Ms. PINGREE asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.) 
Ms. PINGREE. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize and congratulate a 
great Mainer, Skeek Frazee. 
Skeek is retiring this month after 12 
dedicated years of constituent service 
to the people of Maine’s First District. 
I believe the great majority of us who 
work in this institution do so because 
we want to make life better for our 
neighbors. Skeek exemplifies that spir-
it. 
For over a decade, she has committed 
herself to some of the most challenging 
and sensitive cases that come through 
my office. She has fought for asylum 
seekers and refugees who have lived 
through horrors in their home coun-
tries. It is no exaggeration to say that 
new Mainers can build thriving new 
lives because of her help. 
She is known across the country for 
her work advocating for survivors of 
military sexual trauma bravely seek-
ing benefits that they deserve from the 
VA. 
Beyond her considerable skill as a 
caseworker, she has also mentored 
countless interns; been an unfailingly 
generous, 
hilarious, 
and 
kind 
col-
league; and become a treasured friend 
to so many of us in and outside of our 
office. 
Skeek, the people of Maine are infi-
nitely better for having you as an ad-
vocate, a neighbor, and a friend. We 
will miss you dearly, and we wish you 
the very best in your next chapter.

HONORING PAT COOPER 
(Mr. CARTER of Georgia asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and 
extend his remarks.) 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speak-

both financially and with their time 
through the organizations they sup-
port, including Hospice of the Golden 
Isles, Boys and Girls Club of Southeast 
Georgia, the American Cancer Society,

CONGRATULATIONS TO THE 
HOUSTON PRIDE COMMUNITY 
(Ms. JACKSON LEE asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I 
rise today to congratulate the Houston 
pride community and the 44th annual 
pride parade in Houston and to cele-
brate the caucus that has fought 
against HIV/AIDS, political empower-
ment, educating the public, and help-
ing those in the LGBTQI community 
who could not help themselves. 
I congratulate them for a stupendous 
commitment to civic participation in 
our State and in our community. 
Let me also say that I rise again to 
raise the Protect Our Kids Act, an act 
passed by this House really dealing 
with gun safety and protecting our 
kids by raising the age for assault 
weapons, by banning magazines, by en-
suring they are stored, by stopping 
trafficking, stopping ghost guns, and 
stopping bump stocks. 
Yes, we did a magnificent job in the 
House. We look forward to moving for-
ward with legislation that we hope will 
make a difference. We are a part of the 
change, and I hope that we will move 
some elements of the Protect Our Kids 
Act as we go forward to make sure we 
do, in fact, protect our kids.

ENCOURAGING THE PRESS TO RE-
PORT 
ON 
EVENTS 
REGARDING 
UKRAINE 
(Mr. GROTHMAN asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Mr. GROTHMAN. Mr. Speaker, not a 
lot has been said about the conflict in 
Ukraine right now, but it doesn’t mean 
we should take our eye off the ball. 
There is a division, I think, on elected 
officials between two groups, and it is 
important for the press to identify 
which one of these two groups has the 
upper hand, not only in Congress but in 
the Biden administration. 
Some people feel that it would be 
good to wrap up this war, including me. 
Ukraine has the second-lowest birth 
rate of any sizeable country in the 
world, and the population of Ukraine 
has sunk about 5 percent in the last 
few years. Russia also has a low birth 
rate and is having a lot of people leave 
their country. So we have two coun-
tries that should be primarily con-
cerned about keeping the few young 
people they have alive rather than en-
gaged in a war. For that reason, I 
would like to believe that if an off- 
ramp is provided for Mr. Putin then we 
could end the war before we have more 
people dying. 
Mr. Speaker, I would like to ask the 
press corps to weigh in a little bit and 
find out where the Biden administra-
tion stands on this.

PENDING ECONOMIC DISASTER 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. 
LIEU). Under the Speaker’s announced 
policy of January 4, 2021, the gen-
tleman from Arizona (Mr. SCHWEIKERT) 
is recognized until 10 p.m. as the des-
ignee of the minority leader. 
Mr. SCHWEIKERT. Mr. Speaker, just 
because we are doing some organiza-
tion and because we are all up against 
the tyranny of the clock, I yield to the 
gentleman from West Virginia (Mr. 
MOONEY). 
RUGBY WORLD CUP 
Mr. MOONEY. Mr. Speaker, as a com-
petitive college rugby player at Dart-
mouth College, I picked up a love for 
the game of rugby. I continue to enjoy 
watching the sport as a Member of the 
U.S. Congress. I proudly serve as the 
co-chair of the Congressional Rugby 
Caucus, and I am honored to be an ad-
vocate for the Rugby World Cup. I am 
thrilled to rise today to celebrate that 
the United States has been named the 
host site of both the 2031 Men’s Rugby 
World Cup and the 2033 Women’s Rugby 
World Cup, a monumental accomplish-
ment that brings the third largest 
sporting event in the world to our 
shores. 
Earlier this year, my caucus co- 
chair, Democrat ELEANOR HOLMES NOR-
TON, and I introduced a bipartisan con-
current resolution to recognize and 
support the efforts of USA Rugby and 
its partners to bring upcoming Rugby 
World Cup tournaments to the United 
States. Rugby is one of the fastest 
growing sports in the United States 
with more than 100,000 USA Rugby 
members playing in over 2,500 clubs na-
tionwide. 
The United States possesses all the 
necessary state-of-the-art infrastruc-
ture in its stadiums and potential host 
cities to ensure that the tournaments 
set a new standard of quality, comfort, 
security, and safety for players, fans, 
and sponsors. The eventual location of 
U.S.-based Rugby World Cup events 
will be chosen from a group of over one 
dozen cities in the United States. 
Rugby is about so much more than 
the tailgaiting and tackling. At its 
core, rugby teaches comradery, resil-
ience, and respect for the opposition. It 
is also a sport with a massive inter-
national reach. With rugby boasting 
405 million fans across the globe, the 
Men’s Rugby World Cup has become 
among 
the 
most 
popular 
sporting 
events in the world. I congratulate all 
the hardworking individuals at USA 
Rugby who have spent a huge amount 
of time and effort on the lengthy and 
involved bid process. I would also like 
to recognize the efforts and vision of 
the leadership from World Rugby and 
the World Rugby Council. 
This moment marks a pivotal turn-
ing point for the sport of rugby in the 
United States and around the world. 
This will be the first time a Men’s 
Rugby World Cup has been held in 
North 
or 
South 
America. 
A 
new 
hosting concept has been put in place 
as the United States stages consecutive 
men’s and women’s events within the 
same organizational structure. 
A projected 4.1 million fans will at-
tend both the men’s and women’s 
Rugby World Cup events in the United 
States. Recent Rugby World Cup tour-
naments 
have 
brought 
more 
than 
242,000 international fans from around 
the world into the host countries and 
seen more than 1.7 million spectators 
flock to the stadiums, generating sig-
nificant revenue at the local and na-
tional level. 
USA and World Rugby will now lead 
a multi-year effort to build anticipa-
tion for 2031 and 2033 while developing 
infrastructure to guarantee successful 
tournaments. Additionally, USA Rugby 
will use the next decade to drive sig-
nificant investment in the game at the 
youth level, increase access to and di-
versity in rugby, take rugby to the 
next level at the high school and col-
lege levels, and grow USA Rugby mem-
bership to 450,000 members. 
Bringing this event home is great 
news for our country and for the future 
of the great sport of rugby in our Na-
tion. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman 
from Arizona for yielding. 
Mr. SCHWEIKERT. Mr. Speaker, I 
am going to try something tonight be-
cause I am very, very concerned this 
place isn’t paying attention to the 
numbers and how much trouble I be-
lieve we are in. My argument and my 
thesis is very simple: If I am wrong, I 
am wrong; but if I am right and this 
place didn’t prepare because of the 
numbers we are seeing, then we will 
damage the people, we will damage the 
economics, we will damage the coun-
try, and we will damage our future. We 
are not taking it seriously enough on 
how the numbers are eroding and how 
fast—how fast—the numbers are erod-
ing around us economically. 
Now, originally, this was going to be 
a 1-hour presentation. Now it looks 
like I have 22 minutes because of the 
tyranny of the clock, so I will try not 
go too fast, and I promise I will dispose 
of some of the boards. As always, wave 
at me if I start rambling at high rates 
of speed. 
b 2140 
This is our baseline. The problem is 
this chart is now a year and a half old 
and the numbers are much worse. The 
reality, 29 years from now, CBO—this

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5873 
June 23, 2022 
isn’t some off group; this is our Con-
gressional Budget Office—functionally 
says we have $112 trillion. My back of 
the napkin now says $120 trillion of 
publicly borrowed debt in today’s dol-
lars, not inflated dollars. 
Functionally, 75 percent of that debt 
is Medicare. Twenty-five percent is So-
cial Security. The rest of the budget is 
in balance. 
Well, what happens to Medicare par-
ticularly when you start having infla-
tion like we do? 
And I represent a district that has 
had over 11 percent inflation. I rep-
resent the district with the highest in-
flation in America. 
Let’s actually start to walk through 
what many of the experts are saying. 
And remember, I am trying to make a 
very simple point here. I am worried 
about my country. I am worried about 
our debt and the ability to pay, and it 
is skyrocketing; and then the cascade 
effect of how many people are getting 
poorer. 
Remember, in the first 15 months of 
Democrat control here, Americans are 
dramatically poorer today than they 
were a year ago. 
So let’s actually walk through this. 
When Larry Summers—when I am com-
ing to the floor using quotes for Larry 
Summers—you have got Larry Sum-
mers. In order to do what is necessary 
to stop inflation, the Fed is going to 
raise interest rates enough that the 
economy will slip into recession. That 
is one of the Democrats, at least up 
until he had heresy of telling the truth 
on Democrats’ $1.9 trillion spending 
last year, and then you put him on the 
outs. But up till that moment he was 
Democrats’ favorite economist. 
But now he is basically telling us we 
have structurally built in so much in-
flation, we are going to have to have 
the Federal Reserve force us into reces-
sion. 
Do you know what happens to people, 
what happens to poor people, the work-
ing middle class, the working poor 
when you are in a recessionary cycle, 
and how many years it takes for the 
public to get their lives back? 
The economy is heading for a hard 
landing when we are now starting to 
see over and over and over the very 
economists that, a month ago, were 
saying we might be able to negotiate a 
soft landing. Oh, we may just tip a lit-
tle bit of growth and unemployment 
and come back. 
And now those same economists, a 
month later, are saying, no, we are 
heading toward a hard landing. We are 
going into recession. 
By the love of the Dear Lord, I hope 
they are wrong. But if they are right, 
have you seen a single thing this body 
has done to prepare? 
The U.S. economy is heading for a 
hard landing, and this one is impor-
tant. We have got to understand. We 
are starting to see numbers now that— 
and we had a Member of the majority 
here, I think a couple of days ago, 
come and somewhere they threw out, 
oh, but there is all this excess money 
in the people’s savings accounts. That 
isn’t true anymore. 
You do understand, the personal sav-
ings rate has plummeted from 26.6 per-
cent a year ago, functionally, a year 
ago, to 4.4 in April, and it continues to 
vault. And understand, that personal 
savings rate of 4.4 is below where we 
were before the pandemic. 
If we start to hit recession right now, 
our brothers and sisters out there don’t 
have that cash reserve in their bank 
accounts. 
Do you understand the concept of 
fragility? 
And now we actually start to see the 
other thing that really genuinely terri-
fies me, and we are going to do a couple 
of slides on this. And I know I am 
going fast but we are up against the 
clock here. We have a mandatory shut-
down in about 20 minutes. 
Treasury yields are really starting to 
decline. And you have got to under-
stand, we basically had budget projec-
tions, Congressional Budget Office and 
others, who had been basically building 
analysis of what will the debt look 
like? And they were using remarkably 
historically low interest rates. 
A year ago we had expert after expert 
coming in front of the Ways and Means 
Committee and other places, Joint 
Economic Committee, oh, we are going 
to be in historically low interest rates 
because we are getting sold as a soci-
ety. We have all these people saving. 
We are going to be more like Japan. 
Turns out they are wrong. 
Remember the previous slide? The 
savings rate from the largesse of the 
giveaways, just structurally we are 
getting 
demographically 
older. 
We 
should be retaining. It is gone. The sav-
ings are gone. 
And now we are going into an inter-
est rate cycle where they are having to 
start to raise interest rates on Treas-
uries and everything else to attract 
capital from around the world. If you 
have been watching the U.S. dollar, 
you understand what is going on with 
this. 
What happens when U.S. sovereign 
debt—if interest rates are 2 points his-
torically—so we go a 30-year run, and if 
we are just 2 percent higher than what 
CBO modeled last year, 2 points, in 
about 25 years, I believe the math is, 
every dollar of tax receipts, tax reve-
nues, goes just to pay interest. There is 
no more government. We are just cov-
ering our debt. 
Do you understand the fragility we 
have done to ourselves with this infla-
tionary cycle? 
The average interest rate being paid 
on Federal debt—and this, I know this 
board is a little hard to read and hard 
to see. But historically, go back to the 
1960s, 1970s, 1980s, the period that we 
have modeled is way down here. This 
was not normal. 
God forbid, if we go back to nor-
mality in U.S. sovereign interest rates, 
and then we are functionally running 
$30 trillion of debt, do you understand 
how much of—the left wants to spend 
money on these things. The right, we 
want to defend the military. There is 
no money. 
And you saw the first board that ba-
sically said the massive, massive short-
fall in Medicare. Remember, Medicare 
is mostly a general fund expenditure. It 
is like only 20 percent of it really is a 
part A trust fund, and that is gone in 5 
years. And it has begun. It has begun. 
And the other thing, it is more than 
what we borrow today. It is the amount 
of U.S. sovereign debt. And I didn’t 
bring that board, and I probably should 
have, that has to be refinanced every 
month. So you may borrow $1 trillion 
this year, but you had to refinance 5 or 
6 or $7 trillion, and every dime of that 
now is reset at the new interest rates. 
And the higher interest costs—and I 
am going to do a couple of variations of 
this. But this is functionally, 9 budget 
years from now. If it is going where we 
think it is going, publicly held debt— 
you are now in the 126 percent of GDP. 
And most of this movement here, when 
you start to see this movement, it is 
the financing costs. It is the financing 
costs of this government. Because the 
real explosion of our demographic 
spending, you know, the fact that in 7 
years, 22 percent of our country is 65 
and older, that explosion of the baby 
boomers costs—it really starts—it has 
already begun, but it really, that curve 
really starts to take off at the end of 
the decade; at the very time we are al-
ready pushing 126 percent of debt to 
GDP. 
b 2150 
Does anyone understand the level of 
fragility? It is this inflationary cycle. 
Democrats 
did 
something 
horrible 
March last year. They didn’t listen to 
their own economists because they 
were so busy living in this fantasy 
world of free money. Give it away. Peo-
ple will love us. Don’t require them to 
participate in the economy. Now we 
are paying the price. 
If you are trying to save for retire-
ment; if you are a young couple trying 
to get ready to buy your first house, 
there is a technical form for it in eco-
nomics. You are screwed. Because 
every single day that savings you have 
is worth less. 
If you are a saver, your savings today 
is functionally about 7 percent less val-
uable than it was a year ago. 
I mean, those of you who intend to 
retire one day, have you actually start-
ed to think about that the value of the 
savings you had, if you put it in safe 
things like bonds or savings accounts, 
is substantially less valuable today. Its 
purchasing power is less today than it 
was a year ago. 
If this continues for a couple years, 
do you understand how many more 
years you really need to work? Do you 
understand how much more savings 
you have to have? Do you have an un-
derstanding of how much you are going 
to have to help your kids buy that first 
house? This is not a game.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5874 
June 23, 2022 
Two weeks ago, I came here, and we 
tried to do some of the math on the 
board of how many seniors. If the cur-
rent inflation cycle lasts for about 24 
months, we basically were trying to do 
the math of, okay, here is what hap-
pens to seniors’ savings. It falls, the 
value of it. It is functionally trans-
ferred to government. 
What happens to the COLA? Well, the 
COLA and Social Security never gets 
close to keeping up to the actual infla-
tion rate because of the lag problem. 
That 20 percent copay you have on 
your healthcare, and if healthcare in-
flation is almost double the CPI rate, 
and you’ve got to pay that 20 percent, 
we were looking at math that said you 
could potentially double the number of 
seniors in poverty in a decade. 
Has anyone here actually wanted to 
dig into that math and start to under-
stand? This is not a game. 
I know there is a desperate attempt 
by the administration and my Demo-
crat colleagues, oh, this is inflation be-
cause of a war in Ukraine. This is 
greedy oil companies. 
No, it is not. You believed in modern 
monetary policy, and it blew up. 
Remember, much of this inflation 
was structurally built in before the war 
in Ukraine. You see it in these sorts of 
numbers. 
By the end of 2021—and remember, 
that 
is 
before 
Russia’s 
invasion, 
right?—credit card debt climbed to $856 
billion. It is a 28 percent annualized in-
crease in the fourth quarter of last 
year. 
It had already begun. People were al-
ready borrowing on their credit cards 
because prices were going up so fast. So 
the way they were supplementing their 
consumption is they were building up 
debt. 
I have showed you the board before. 
Savings rates have collapsed. We are 
now seeing credit card debt explode. 
When those hit up the wall—you see 
what happened 3 weeks ago—consumer 
sentiment collapsed. 
It is because all of a sudden I can’t 
keep financing my lifestyle by using up 
my savings and chewing up credit card 
debt. 
This is going on right now. Where is 
the concern? Does anyone here care 
about people and what is going on to 
them economically out there, outside 
the walls of this building? 
The U.S. economy is heading for a 
hard landing, and this is just function-
ally that same thing, once again, by 
other sources talking about the growth 
of credit card debt—or, excuse me, the 
collapse of savings rates. 
Credit card balances, once again, 
really, really—from other sources, say-
ing the growth. This is a real problem. 
If we were in a time of prosperity—a 
couple minutes ago, I was in the back 
room. I saw the spokesperson for the 
White House. These are fine economic 
times. Have they lost their minds? Do 
they own, like, a subscription to any 
economic journal? 
To say things are fine at the same 
time you can see the aggregated data 
of savings collapsing, credit card debt 
exploding, interest rates going up, in-
terest rates and sovereign debt, and 
now start to understand what that is 
going to mean in the financing of this 
government. 
Now you have got to deal with the 
Democrats’ policy set. The fact of the 
matter is, thank God, the Senate has a 
couple Democrats that actually may 
have saved the country—it is hard to 
say that—by stopping the Build Back 
Better and the just stunning amount of 
debt the left wanted to build on. 
When you start seeing numbers say-
ing that if the Democrats’ package had 
passed, we functionally would have 
gone from about $17 trillion of pub-
licly-held borrowing before the pan-
demic to $44 trillion by the end of the 
decade. This is if the Democrats’ spend-
ing plans and borrowing plans had 
passed. 
An absolute, absolute lie, and we 
have shown it over and over, oh, it is 
all paid for; except it wasn’t. It wasn’t 
even close. 
I think in the Build Back Better, the 
best estimate we were able to come— 
and we used their math—was they were 
covering about 30 percent of the ex-
penditures, and they were covering it 
in a way where they were going to 
raise certain taxes that would have ac-
tually 
slowed 
down 
the 
economic 
growth that we are desperate for. 
Now you start to see my fear for the 
country. When we start to model what 
happens to the projected Federal debt 
under various interest rate scenarios— 
and I know I am sounding like a highly 
caffeinated accountant on steroids, but 
this is the stuff we are paid to read and 
understand. 
We are not paid to stand behind these 
microphones and virtue signal. But, 
God, that seems to be what we do here. 
We do policy by virtue signaling. 
Let’s come here for just one moment. 
Here is functionally where we are at. If 
you start to say, okay, the mean of 
U.S. sovereign debt, the 30 years, the 10 
years, the 20s, you know, up and down, 
CBO’s baseline basically says we are at 
202 percent of debt to GDP. 
With a small increase going back to 
almost normality, with the historic av-
erage over the last 30 years, we are 
starting to hit numbers close to 300. 
If we actually were slightly above 
historic normal, you are at 357 percent 
of debt to GDP. Does anyone believe 
this economy doesn’t collapse long be-
fore that? 
People run from the U.S. dollar. They 
dispose of U.S. debt. Can you imagine 
what the chaos, what the misery, what 
the dystopian nature of economics 
would be in this country if you start to 
run up these levels of debt. 
You already saw in a previous chart 
we are heading toward 126 percent of 
debt functionally at the end of the dec-
ade. Debt to GDP. That is publicly held 
borrowed money. 
At the same time, you are going to 
be up against the Social Security trust 
fund running out of money. Social Se-
curity recipients are heading toward a 
25 to 27 percent cut. The Medicare trust 
fund will have already been gone for 5 
years, so we still haven’t figured out 
what is going to happen to the pay-
ments to doctors and hospitals within 
that. 
This is not a game, and it is in front 
of us. If we get here a couple years 
from now, and all this is blowing up on 
us, and this place pretends they didn’t 
know, maybe I could sit them in front 
of the hours I have spent behind this 
microphone going over the math. The 
math is in those binders that are sent 
to us two times a year. 
Here is one of the things that truly 
terrifies me, as you start to get into 
the new interest rate scenarios. This 
isn’t long term. This is basically, yeah, 
we start to think of what mean rates 
mean, and you start to add in just a 2 
percent change. 
That 2 percent—and this is within 
the current 10-year window—you start 
to basically add $13.4 trillion addi-
tional—well, debt, and this marginal 
here is just the marginal increase be-
cause you start to chase your tail. 
I have a chart, and I need to actually 
have it graphically made so it is easier 
to see. We will be financing the debt 
that we are financing. We will be chas-
ing our tail, and that is where we are 
heading. 
Now the cruelty. 
Mr. Speaker pro tem, may I ask, be-
cause I am looking at the clock above. 
Can you tell me how many minutes I 
have? 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. About a 
minute and a half. 
Mr. SCHWEIKERT. I promise you, I 
am going to use all 5 minutes. 
This is the cruelty now to poor peo-
ple, to the working poor, to that hard-
working middle class, to those retirees. 
When you come to them and say, all 
right, let’s take a look here. 
Forgive the colors, but the green 
would have been if we had hit the 2 per-
cent sort of Federal Reserve bench-
mark inflation goal. This here is where 
we seem to be annualizing right now, 
and this is some of the newest projec-
tion for the next couple years. It is 
about 7.4. 
But when you see this bar come 
down, it basically means the $100 you 
had in 2022, if you get to 2032, so a dec-
ade, that $100 you have, if we stay at 
this sort of inflation rate, functionally, 
you have lost half of its purchasing 
value. 
So you have saved and saved and 
saved and saved and saved, and if you 
start running—if the current interest 
or current inflation environment were 
to hang around for a decade, at the end 
of that decade, half the value is gone. 
You have lost half of your savings. 
This is what is going on. What if it is 
just for 2 years? You start just doing it 
for 2 years, and you start to realize you 
have lost almost a quarter. Then you 
compound that out to you want to re-
tire one day. You want to finance your 
kids’ school. You want to do these 
things.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5875 
June 23, 2022 
Do you understand how the dif-
ference of your earning power has to 
change just to make up for the loss of 
the value? I represent a community 
that is going through 11 percent infla-
tion rates. 
Then the last one in the last how 
many seconds I have. Please. Please. 
Someone hire an economist to talk to 
the White House. A gas tax holiday? I 
mean, you can hear the economists 
rolling on their backs laughing right 
now. 
Mr. Speaker pro tem, thank you for 
your tolerance tonight. I yield back 
the balance of my time.

Let us pray. 
Mighty God, the source of all life and 
the light of all seeing, lift our thoughts

we strive to do right by trusting You 
completely. 
Lord, judge our thoughts and desires, 
leading us with Your love and faithful-
ness. Today, teach our lawmakers to 
love in the presence of hate, to forgive 
in the presence of injustice, and to illu-
minate in the presence of darkness.

ter in the time of storm. 
We pray in Your righteous Name.

RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY LEADER 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-

nized. 
BIPARTISAN SAFER COMMUNITIES ACT 
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, as 
we approach the conclusion of a truly 
consequential work period, the Senate 
this morning will take the next major 
step toward accomplishing something 
that hasn’t been done in decades, pass-
ing a strong gun safety bill. 
The bill can be described simply in 
three adjectives: common sense, bipar-
tisan, lifesaving. And if Republicans 
work with us, we could very well finish 
the job in its entirety before the day is 
done. 
Later this morning, the Senate will 
vote to invoke cloture on the Bipar-
tisan Safer Communities Act, and I ex-
pect that vote to have robust bipar-
tisan support, just as we saw earlier 
this week. 
We are not going to leave until we 
pass this bill. After this morning’s 
vote, it is my intention to work with 
Republican colleagues to reach an 
agreement to secure a vote on final 
passage before the day is out. 
As the author of the Brady bill near-
ly 30 years ago, the last legislative ef-
fort to fight gun violence, I am so 
pleased that we are at last on the prec-
ipice of taking action once again. It 
has been a long time, but this break-
through is welcome. So I urge my Re-
publican colleagues, let’s get this bill 
passed and pass it today. Let’s pass it 
so we can send it to the House; they 
can send it to the White House; and the 
President can sign it. Americans have 
waited long enough. Let us finish our 
job today. 
As we take the final steps in this 
process, few could have anticipated we 
would reach this point just a few weeks 
ago. The morning after the tragedy in 
Uvalde, the U.S. Senate faced a choice: 
We could surrender to gridlock, and we 
could swiftly vote on a bill with provi-
sions many of us would have wanted, 
but because of rigid opposition from 
the other side had no hope of passing 
the Chamber—it would have failed—or 
we could choose to try and forge a bi-
partisan path forward to pass a real 
bill, as difficult as that may have 
seemed to many. 
Over the past 4 weeks, we chose to 
try and get something done. Imme-
diately after Uvalde, I spoke with Sen-
ator MURPHY, who asked me to give ne-
gotiators time and space to do their 
work. With his deep experience in this 
area, he believed that given the oppor-
tunity, maybe, maybe, maybe these

talks 
could 
succeed; 
although, 
of 
course, there was no guarantee. 
I was happy to agree because I knew 
that even if there was a chance to get 
something positive and tangible done 
on gun safety, it was worth the effort. 
So I told Senator MURPHY I would give 
him the space he needed. That quickly 
became the consensus of our caucus 
and the consensus of many of our gun 
safety advocates who pressed us to se-
cure real progress. Senator MURPHY 
and I called them the day after Uvalde, 
and they agreed, get something done, 
even if it wouldn’t be everything we 
would all want. 
We were all on the same page. In-
stead of voting on a bill that would 
fail, we would try and get something 
real passed in the Senate. In the end, it 
was the right decision because before 
long we had a bipartisan guns frame-
work. A week later, we had legislative 
text. A few days ago, that bill came be-
fore the Senate with strong bipartisan 
votes. And today—today—we can take 
final steps to passing the first major 
gun safety bill in nearly 30 years. 
As I said, this is not a cure-all for all 
the ways gun violence affects our Na-
tion, but it is a long overdue step in 
the right direction. It is significant; it 
is going to save lives; and it is my in-
tention to get it done as soon as we 
can. 
I want to thank all of my Democratic 
and Republican colleagues for working 
together to reach this point, and I want 
to thank the leaders of the effort: Sen-
ators MURPHY
and SINEMA, Senators 
CORNYN and TILLIS, as well as all of our 
colleagues on the bipartisan working 
group, all of our chairs and Members 
who contributed their expertise and 
their leadership in shaping the bill. I 
also want to thank every single sur-
vivor of gun violence, every family who 
has spoken up, every advocate who has 
organized, and every voter and con-
cerned citizen who has pushed this 
body to take action for so many years. 
Even with the holes in their heart, the 
lost loved ones through needless, cruel 
gun violence, so many advocates per-
sisted and persisted and persisted. And 
without them keeping that candle 
burning, even in the darkest of mo-
ments, we wouldn’t have gotten this 
done. I salute them. I thank them. 
America thanks them. And I say to all 
of them, all the advocates who worked 
so hard and so long on this, very soon 
your efforts will bear real fruit. 
We are going to keep going until we 
finish the job. So I urge my colleagues 
to reach an agreement with us to do 
precisely that. 
REMEMBERING LEONA I. FAUST 
Now, Madam President, on a dif-
ferent and sadder subject, I wish to 
offer a few words this morning in honor 
of Leona Faust, the Senate Librarian, 
who passed away after decades of work-
ing to serve in this body. 
In Psalm 19, it is written: 
Day after day they pour forth speech; 
Night after night they reveal knowledge. 
This Chamber is well accustomed to 
long speeches from many Members day 
after day, but for a century and a half, 
it has been the responsibility of one 
person, the Senate Librarian, to help 
reveal, preserve, and safeguard the 
knowledge and work of this body. For 
44 years, that was the work Leona dedi-
cated herself to with intelligence and 
grace. 
Leona’s first day on the job was very 
different from what library employees 
might encounter today. When she was 
first hired in 1978, her responsibilities 
were primarily to manage hundreds of 
calls that came every day inquiring 
about the status of this or that piece of 
legislation. 
In time, Leona, who became the Li-
brarian in 2010, worked dramatically to 
improve the efficiency of the Library. 
She modernized it, digitized it, and 
made it far more accessible for Mem-
bers and their staffs. Her accomplish-
ments forever changed the way infor-
mation flows across the Senate and de-
mocracy—democracy itself—is better 
off for her work. 
But most of all today, we pay tribute 
to Leona not for what she did but for 
what she was—a beloved member of the 
Senate community, a friend to so 
many, and someone whom we will miss 
very, very dearly. 
Today, all of us keep her memory 
permanently in our hearts and her fam-
ily in our prayers. 
TRIBUTE TO WILLIAM WALSH 
Madam President, I want to con-
gratulate 
our 
Journal 
Clerk 
Billy 
Walsh on his retirement from the Sen-
ate. 
The Senate could not function with-
out the hard-working staff here in the 
Chamber. Billy began his career as as-
sistant bill clerk, and he has been with 
us for 19 years. A native of Cum-
berland, MD, he is retiring as the 21st 
Journal Clerk of the U.S. Senate. 
We all wish him a happy and healthy 
retirement. And as Billy has said, 
‘‘Those umbrella drinks by the ocean 
aren’t going to drink themselves.’’ 
Enjoy your libations and your retire-
ment—to the wonderful, wonderful, 
wonderful and always smiling Billy 
Walsh. 
I yield the floor. 
RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The minority leader is recog-
nized. 
BIPARTISAN SAFER COMMUNITIES ACT 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President, 
the American people do not have to 
choose between safer schools and the 
Constitution, and neither does the U.S. 
Senate. 
The American people want their con-
stitutional rights protected and their 
kids to be safe in school. They want 
both of those things at once, and that 
is just what the bill before the Senate 
will help accomplish. 
Thanks to the leadership and dedica-
tion 
of 
Senator 
CORNYN, 
Senator 
TILLIS, and several of their counter-
parts across the aisle, we are consid-
ering a bipartisan bill that will make 
our country safer without making it 
any less free. This is the sweet spot: 
making America safer, especially for 
kids in school, without making our 
country one bit less free. 
The legislation before us would make 
our communities and schools safer 
without laying one finger on the Sec-
ond Amendment for law-abiding citi-
zens. Its key provisions are hugely pop-
ular with the American people. This 
bill supplies significant new funding to 
law enforcement and police, to school 
security, and to mental health treat-
ment both in school and in the wider 
community. 
Under this bill, if a teenager has been 
convicted of a crime or adjudicated to 
be mentally ill, even before their 18th 
birthday, that important information 
will show up in a firearms background 
check until they are 21. This strength-
ens the existing background check sys-
tem without expanding it. 
States will receive new money for 
crisis intervention programs of their 
own choosing, and if they choose to use 
the money for so-called red flag laws, 
those laws will have to meet a new, 
higher standard for due process. 
This is a commonsense package. Its 
provisions are very, very popular. It 
contains zero—zero—new restrictions, 
zero new waiting periods, zero man-
dates, and zero bans of any kind for 
law-abiding gun owners. 
Police and law enforcement support 
the bill strongly. The police chiefs’ as-
sociation and the Fraternal Order of 
Police say: ‘‘This bipartisan measure is 
. . . one that will save lives,’’ accord-
ing to the FOP and the police chiefs’ 
association. 
The National Sheriffs’ Association 
calls it: 
A bill that can actually save lives . . . that 
allows the States to craft their own unique 
answers to the questions raised by gun vio-
lence. 
After years—literally years—of lib-
eral demands that would make war on 
citizens’ 
constitutional 
rights, 
our 
Democratic colleagues have finally ac-
cepted that we can make schools and 
communities safer without impeding 
on the Second Amendment. 
We can do more to protect innocent 
Americans, schoolkids especially, with-
out—without—eroding 
the 
Bill 
of 
Rights 1 inch, and that is just what the 
Senate will do when we pass this bill. 
U.S. SUPREME COURT 
Madam President, speaking of public 
safety, as the Supreme Court prepares 
to issue its final opinions of the term, 
far-left activists are openly calling for 
riots and violence in the streets. 
For months, many of the country’s 
most prominent Democrats have in-
dulged in reckless talk and irrespon-
sible rhetoric, fanning the flames of 
fear and rage among their supporters. 
This poisonous climate has illegal 
mobs assembling outside Justices’ pri-
vate family homes and has prompted 
one unhinged person to travel across 
the country for the purpose of commit-
ting an assassination.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S3103 
June 23, 2022 
The far left is promising that all of 
this will only be the prelude—the prel-
ude—to the main event if they don’t 
like the rulings coming down the pike. 
One activist group is promising that 
our cities will be submerged in—listen 
to this—‘‘a night of rage.’’ 
Well, yesterday, the Senate unani-
mously 
passed 
some 
supplemental 
funding for law enforcement to protect 
the rule of law and to keep the Court, 
its staff, and the Justices safe from all 
this. This noncontroversial funding 
passed here unanimously last night— 
zero objections. The House of Rep-
resentatives needs to pass this urgent 
bill without delay. 
BORDER SECURITY 
Madam President, on another mat-
ter, in 2021, on President Biden’s watch, 
each monthly total for illegal migrant 
apprehensions was higher than the 
same month’s number the previous 
year. The same thing is happening in 
2022. Every month has topped the total 
from 12 months prior. In fact, this past 
May didn’t just eclipse May of 2021; it 
set a new alltime record. Border Patrol 
officers conducted nearly 240,000 appre-
hensions in May, and 25 percent of 
them—an ‘‘unusually high’’ rate—in-
volved migrants they had apprehended be-
fore in just the past year. 
These jaw-dropping numbers are a 
clear and direct symptom of failed 
leadership. The Biden administration is 
making a conscious decision—a con-
scious decision—to fumble the ball. 
Last spring, right after apprehen-
sions hit a 20-year high, President 
Biden claimed: 
It’s way down . . . We’ve now gotten con-
trol. 
Look, no reasonable person could 
have looked at the facts and concluded 
that things were under control, but 
that is exactly what President Biden 
and his team insisted. Apparently, a 
functionally open border is how they 
define success. A functionally open bor-
der is how, apparently, they define suc-
cess. 
Senate Democrats rubberstamped the 
Biden nominees who are presiding over 
this failure. The Biden DHS swiftly 
issued internal guidance encouraging 
ICE and CBP personnel to use more po-
litically correct terminology when re-
ferring to the border crisis. They were 
quicker to police employees’ language 
than to actually police the border. 
Vice President HARRIS spent her time 
as the administration’s supposed bor-
der czar, staying as far away as pos-
sible from the border itself. 
Just this spring President Biden sub-
mitted a budget request that would cut 
funding for Immigration and Customs 
Enforcement detention. He also prom-
ised to cut out the emergency authori-
ties that border officials were relying 
on—in the absence of a coherent strat-
egy from his administration—to turn 
away thousands of illegal migrants 
every single day. 
Their response to a functional open 
border is just to hit the gas pedal. 
Stable prices, public safety, and se-
cure borders are three of the most fun-
damental duties of any government. 
Sadly, for our country, the Biden ad-
ministration has swung and missed 
three times. 
TRIBUTE TO WILLIAM WALSH 
Madam President, today, I have the 
honor of acknowledging a longtime 
Senate staff member who is proceeding 
to a well-earned retirement at the end 
of this month. 
Billy Walsh has been with the Sec-
retary of the Senate’s office for 19 
years. He spent several years as an as-
sistant bill clerk before moving to the 
Journal Clerk’s office and working his 
way up to that top post. 
As the Senate’s Journal Clerk for the 
last 4 years, Billy has brought both 
good humor and professional dedica-
tion to his work in serving the Senate. 
So, Billy, congratulations on your re-
tirement, and thank you for your serv-
ice. 
REMEMBERING LEONA I. FAUST 
Madam President, yesterday was a 
sad day for the Senate. We learned that 
we had lost a distinguished, long-serv-
ing staff leader in our institution. 
Leona Faust had served her country 
as Senate Librarian for the past 12 
years, and that key position was the 
capstone of a long and storied Senate 
career that had just entered its 45th 
year. 
Everyone who knew Leona had ster-
ling praise for her work. I have heard 
our Librarian described by her friends 
and colleagues as being devoted to the 
institution—as a true Senate all-star, 
as the first to volunteer whenever a 
task needed tackling. 
Leona was a beloved colleague. She 
was also an expert whose profes-
sionalism and institutional knowledge 
filled an essential niche in the Senate’s 
day-to-day functioning. 
As leader of a talented team, Leona 
was constantly looking for new ways to 
expand the resources the Library offers 
to Senators and to our staff. She was 
instrumental in expanding the ref-
erences and databases of the Senate’s 
information system, especially as the 
pandemic left big chunks of the insti-
tution to working and researching re-
motely for a while. Year after year, she 
demonstrated her devotion, often with-
out much fanfare. 
The Senate Library staff pull long 
hours attending to pressing questions 
here on the floor. Leona led by exam-
ple. She made herself available at all 
hours. So the Senate hasn’t just lost a 
talented Librarian who helped people 
find resources they needed, we lost a 
true steward of the institution who had 
become a resource herself in her own 
right. 
Our prayers today are with Leona’s 
family and with her colleagues at the 
Senate Library and with everyone 
across the Senate who spent decades 
admiring Leona’s commitment and her 
expertise and who are now joined to-

E-CIGARETTES AND VAPING PRODUCTS 
Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, if 
you look at the marketing plan of Big 
Tobacco in America over the last half- 
century, it is very obvious: Tobacco 
companies sell an addictive product. 
There is a chemical included in the to-
bacco—nicotine—which is highly ad-
dictive. To be successful, they have to 
convince people to take up smoking, 
even though it is dangerous to their 
health and is a product that is difficult 
to quit. How do they achieve that goal? 
They prey on children, and they always 
have. Kids start smoking at an early 
age, and if the tobacco companies have 
their way, it leads to an addiction for 
a lifetime—a compromise on a person’s 
health and even their death. 
Over the years, I have done battle 
with Big Tobacco. The first, I guess, 
exchange was over banning smoking on 
airplanes. It seems so long ago, but we 
were successful, and we really changed 
the national conversation on tobacco. 
More and more people became sensitive 
to the fact that tobacco companies 
were, in fact, exploiting our children, 
addicting them to their product, and 
steps were taken at every level—local, 
State, and Federal—to stop that from 
happening, and it worked. The number 
of children in America who are ad-
dicted 
to 
tobacco-related 
products 
began to decline precipitously. 
Big Tobacco was in a panic. They 
were losing their market share. Kids 
weren’t taking up tobacco smoking the 
way they had in the past, and so they 
devised and invented new products. The 
most obvious one, I want to address 
this morning: e-cigarettes, vaping. 
The nicotine inside these vaping de-
vices is the same nicotine as in the to-
bacco cigarette, and it is just as addict-
ive. Where have these companies di-
rected their marketing? To children. 
Once again, to children. 
We believe that 2 million or more 
children in America are currently 
using vaping products and e-cigarettes. 
Many of them believe that they are 
harmless, that they cause no damage 
to you from a health viewpoint. These 
children are wrong. 
The Agency that is responsible for 
regulating this product—vaping prod-
ucts, e-cigarettes—is the Food and 
Drug Administration. They have writ-
ten a sad and sorry record when it 
comes to regulation of this deadly 
product. 
Over the years, we have begged them, 
pleaded with them, argued with them 
over why they didn’t show more leader-
ship in banning this product from the 
shelves across America because so 
many children were becoming addicted. 
It reached the point where a Federal 
court—after years of delay by the Food 
and Drug Administration, the U.S. Dis-
trict Court for the District of Maryland 
ordered the Food and Drug Administra-
tion to finally begin regulating these 
addictive, kid-friendly vaping products, 
giving a deadline of September 9, 2021, 
to finalize review of e-cigarette appli-
cations.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S3104 
June 23, 2022 
You see, the law requires the com-
pany to prove that the product is not 
dangerous to the public health before it 
can be marketed. The FDA really 
dropped its guard and allowed them to 
sell the product without that proof, 
and it took a Federal court setting a 
deadline to get the FDA back into the 
business of regulating this deadly prod-
uct that was addicting millions of chil-
dren across America. 
I have had my ups and downs with 
the Food and Drug Administration 
over this issue. I think they could have 
been much more aggressive. They could 
have protected more children. But, un-
fortunately, they did not. During the 
entire 
Trump 
administration, 
we 
backpedaled, came up with excuses, did 
nothing, and so vaping products be-
came more prolific across America, and 
more children became addicted. 
Now we have a new head of the FDA, 
Dr. Califf. We had our back-and-forth 
exchanges over this issue, and I made 
it very clear to him that there was no 
possible explanation or justification 
for not regulating this product when 
the lives and health of so many chil-
dren were at stake. As I said, we had 
our good days and bad days in that ex-
change. 
I am happy to report that the Food 
and 
Drug 
Administration 
has 
an-
nounced this morning a dramatic, his-
toric step forward to protect the chil-
dren across America from e-cigarette 
and vaping products. They are finally— 
finally, the FDA is starting actions to 
remove from the shelves products pro-
duced by the JUUL company—J-U-U-L, 
JUUL company—that, in fact, endan-
ger our children. This is long overdue. 
You won’t be surprised to learn that 
Big Tobacco has a major investment in 
these companies. They believe this is 
the future, their new product that they 
can addict children with—the nico-
tine—and hook them, perhaps for life, 
on their products. 
The Food and Drug Administration 
has taken a bold step today. It is going 
to be a battle royal in court—you can 
just bet on it—but finally they have 
stood up and said they are ready and 
prepared for the battle. I want to join 
them in that effort. 
I also want to say that taking these 
products off the shelves across America 
will invite the possibility of contra-
band or black market sales. We are 
calling on all those entities which 
could supply those black market prod-
ucts, including internet sources, to 
stand up for children across America 
and join the FDA in stopping the sale 
of these products. 
We estimated that if the Food and 
Drug Administration did not take ac-
tion to do this today, did not initiate 
this effort to stop the sale of this prod-
uct, we know more children would be 
addicted. As many as 750,000 to a mil-
lion children have started since the 
FDA defied a court deadline in Sep-
tember. That just gives you an idea of 
the reach of this product and how seri-
ous it is. 
If you don’t know the story behind e- 
cigarettes and vaping, ask a high 
school student in America. If that 
doesn’t work, ask their parents when 
they discover that their kids are ad-
dicted to these products. They are in-
nocuous-looking little delivery sys-
tems that look like they belong in a 
computer, while they end up damaging 
the health of children and people 
across the United States. 
When I spoke to Dr. Califf this morn-
ing and he told me about this historic 
announcement by the Food and Drug 
Administration, he made it clear that 
tobacco and smoking and nicotine 
products were a major threat to the 
health of children across this country 
and to Americans. Tobacco regulation, 
as he noted, is a major step forward in 
reducing the number of cancer deaths 
in America and heart disease. It is still 
a problem. It is still a challenge. And 
Big Tobacco and their new Big Vaping 
allies are determined to once again get 
their hooks in our kids at an early age. 
I am heartened by this decision by 
the Food and Drug Administration. 
They are in for a legal battle, for sure, 
but it is worth the effort. 
In the end, make sure that you come 
down on the side of children when we 
are talking about tobacco and nicotine. 
It is an issue that I have been involved 
in for years. I see the Senator from Or-
egon on the floor, and I know that he 
was involved in the House of Rep-
resentatives and in the Senate in the 
same battle. But our efforts against 
vaping and e-cigarettes are going to 
mean that children have a healthier 
life and better future. 
I commend the Food and Drug Ad-
ministration for this decision removing 
JUUL products from the shelves of 
America, and I hope we can do more. 
I yield the floor.

The Senator from New Mexico. 
S. 2938 
Mr. HEINRICH. Mr. President, like 
many of my constituents in New Mex-
ico, I am a gun owner. I have a sin-
cerely held respect of law-abiding gun 
ownership. 
Many of my own most cherished 
memories involve the responsible use 
of a firearm to feed my family and to 
forge memories with my sons and my 
closest friends. But those same sons 
grew up doing active shooter drills in 
their 
classrooms, 
something 
that 
would have been absolutely unimagi-
nable when I was their age. And just 
this spring, my son’s high school was 
on lockdown when I arrived, due to a 
nearby shooting that actually involved 
students from that high school. That 
type of experience has become all too 
common in our country. 
The gun violence our communities 
are experiencing is appalling, and it is 
unacceptable. It is evident from the un-
thinkable mass shootings that we have 
witnessed in Uvalde and Buffalo and 
Tulsa and Vestavia Hills and El Paso. 
And it is evident in the mounting num-
ber of gun homicide and gun suicides 
that have taken tens of thousands of 
lives each year. 
My home State of New Mexico con-
tinues to struggle with one of the high-
est rates of gun deaths in the country; 
and in recent years, far too many New 
Mexicans have lost friends and family 
members to this epidemic of violence. 
I personally refuse to accept the idea 
that we are so divided in this country 
that we can’t do something to make 
this situation better. That is why I join 
my good friend Senator CHRIS MURPHY 
of Connecticut and a number of my col-
leagues from both sides of the aisle to 
try and chart a meaningful path for-
ward. Over these past weeks, we have 
engaged in challenging but productive 
conversations. We found areas of agree-
ment on real solutions that we can and 
we will pass here in the U.S. Senate. 
Our bipartisan negotiations and the 
legislation that they have produced 
prove that we can work together in 
this body. And they show that when we 
set aside the vicious politics that have 
held us back for too long on this par-
ticular issue, we can actually create 
policies that save lives. 
The Bipartisan Safer Communities 
Act includes Federal resources to help 
States and Tribes implement crisis 
intervention programs. 
New Mexico passed a law to establish 
one of these programs just last year. 
The goal was to ensure that deadly 
weapons were kept out of the hands of 
those that a court, with due process, 
determined to be a significant danger 
to themselves or others. But as of last 
month, New Mexico had only used our 
law nine times, primarily due to a lack 
of funding and resources and training. 
Just last month, on Mother’s Day, 
New Mexico tragically lost two teens, 
shot and killed by a man who very 
likely could have had his firearm re-
moved using New Mexico’s crisis inter-
vention law. 
The alleged suspect had been issued a 
temporary restraining order at the re-
quest of his former girlfriend and the 
mother of one of the victims. The re-
straining order showed that he was in 
possession of two firearms. Unfortu-
nately, the local sheriff’s office failed 
to recognize the threat that he posed 
and didn’t use our State’s law to re-
move the firearms that he used to take 
the lives of two young New Mexicans. 
If we can provide our law enforce-
ment officers and courts the funding 
and training they need to make crisis 
intervention laws effective, we can pro-
tect our communities and ensure that 
future lives are not lost. The Bipar-
tisan Safer Communities Act will help 
us do just that. 
Our legislation also enhances the re-
view process for firearms buyers under 
21 years of age. This new process will 
require an investigative period to re-
view 
criminal 
and 
mental 
health 
records, including checks with State 
databases and local law enforcement. 
Over the last 4 years, six of the nine 
deadliest mass shootings were by peo-
ple who were 21 or younger. The Bipar-
tisan Safer Communities Act ensures 
we respond to this deadly trend in a 
meaningful way. 
Our legislation also makes clear who 
the Federal firearm licensing require-
ments apply to, leading to more fire-
arm sales that require a background 
check. 
We are finally making sure that con-
victed domestic violence abusers and 
individuals subject to domestic vio-
lence restraining orders are included in 
the Federal background check data-
base, whether or not the abuser is mar-
ried to the victim. That has long been 
a major failure in Federal law, and it 
has allowed dangerous abusers, who are 
dating but not married to their part-
ners but whom we know pose a violent 
threat, to acquire deadly weapons. This 
provision alone will save an enormous 
number of lives. 
Our legislation will also make his-
toric investments in community behav-
ioral health and school-based mental 
health services, and it will increase ac-
cess 
to 
behavioral 
health 
services 
through telehealth. 
The bill will help support school vio-
lence prevention efforts and provide 
training to school personnel and stu-
dents so that they can recognize the 
signs that so often precede some of 
these violent shootings events. 
Over the course of our negotiations, I 
worked especially hard on a few key 
provisions with my colleague from 
Maine, Senator SUSAN
COLLINS. Our 
provisions will crack down on straw 
purchasing and trafficking of firearms. 
These provisions will directly reduce 
gun violence in our home States and 
internationally. Let me take a moment 
to explain how.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S3106 
June 23, 2022 
Under current law, it is a minor pa-
perwork offense to buy a gun for some-
one else. And even then, that only ap-
plies if you buy the gun from a Federal 
firearm licensee. Under the Bipartisan 
Safer Communities Act, we are making 
it a serious crime to buy a gun for 
someone else when you know that per-
son will use the gun to commit a felony 
or that they are not allowed to buy a 
gun themselves. That applies whether 
you buy the gun from a Federal fire-
arm licensee or not. 
The consequences of this simple 
change will be real. It will keep deadly 
weapons out of the hands of people who 
would use them to hurt others, and it 
will level serious consequences for 
those who break the law. 
Just last year, a New Mexico State 
Police officer was tragically killed dur-
ing a traffic stop in Deming, NM. Offi-
cer Darrion Jarrott was shot and killed 
by a convicted felon whose wife had al-
legedly purchased the gun for him. She 
is now being prosecuted under the pa-
perwork offense that is currently on 
the books. But under the Bipartisan 
Safer Communities Act, she would be 
facing more severe and deserved con-
sequences for her role in the death of a 
State police officer. 
This legislation will also stop the 
type of organized straw purchasing and 
trafficking that we have seen too often 
in New Mexico and elsewhere. Right 
now, law enforcement has to watch as 
an organized chain of straw purchases 
happen one after another, intended to 
protect the person most at fault—the 
mastermind of the operation—by keep-
ing them far removed from the pur-
chase that happens at an FFL, at a 
Federal firearm licensee. 
Our law enforcement watched this 
happen, but they can only go after the 
person who walked into the FFL and 
made the very first of that series of 
straw purchases—that is usually the 
person least involved in the scheme. 
But that is about to change. Soon, 
these ringleaders won’t be able to dis-
tance themselves from the law any-
more. 
With our new straw purchase provi-
sion, law enforcement will be able to go 
after every link in the illegal chain of 
purchases to take down the entire ring, 
not just the vulnerable individuals 
these rings sometimes rely on to make 
the initial purchase. 
There is more. While trafficking fire-
arms into the United States is a major 
Federal crime under existing law, traf-
ficking firearms out of the United 
States has not been. For years, this has 
meant that firearms trafficked out of 
the United States are the primary sup-
ply of guns used to commit violent 
crimes in Mexico, in El Salvador, in 
Honduras, and in Guatemala. 
It has also invited dangerous firearm 
trafficking into communities on both 
sides of our Nation’s southern and 
northern borders. We saw this in my 
home State about a decade ago when a 
major firearms trafficking ring was un-
covered in Columbus, NM. This traf-
ficking operation involved the chief of 
police, the mayor, a village trustee, 
and an estimated 190 firearms, includ-
ing large numbers of handguns and as-
sault rifles. And the crime they were 
charged with? Lying on their paper-
work. 
Not anymore. The Bipartisan Safer 
Communities Act takes this violence 
on with the severity that it deserves. It 
gives law enforcement the tools they 
need to stop this activity and the vio-
lence it directly and indirectly creates 
in our communities and within our bor-
ders. By taking on the violence that 
families are fleeing in their home coun-
tries—violence that our inadequate gun 
laws have actually contributed to—we 
are also taking meaningful action to 
address a root cause behind so many 
refugees coming to our country. 
Now, I fully recognize that the Bipar-
tisan Safer Communities Act is a com-
promise. Many of the parents and stu-
dents who have raised their voices to 
demand action on gun violence would 
like us to go further. But progress has 
to start somewhere. The hardest part 
of every negotiation is letting go of the 
perfect for the possible, and I am con-
fident that the legislation we are vot-
ing on will make a real difference in re-
ducing gun violence—a difference that 
will be measured in lives. It will boost 
public safety, it will invest in mental 
health, and it will keep more firearms 
out of the hands of those who would 
use them against their communities. 
The painful truth is that we can 
never bring back those precious chil-
dren whose lives were cut short in 
Uvalde, TX; in Parkland, FL; in New-
town, CT; or Aztec High School, West 
Mesa High School, Deming Middle 
School, and Washington Middle School 
in my State. We can never offer enough 
words to heal the grieving families all 
across the country who have lost their 
sons and daughters and their brothers 
and sisters and their fathers and moth-
ers to gun violence. But what we can 
do by voting to pass this legislation in 
the Senate is to honor their memory— 
not just with condolences and hopes 
and prayers but with concrete action. 
I would encourage all of my col-
leagues to support the Bipartisan Safer 
Communities Act. Each life that we 
save by passing this legislation will 
mean literally everything to that per-
son’s loved ones, and that is what this 
is all about.

ator from Alabama. 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST—S. 251 
Mr. TUBERVILLE. Mr. President, 
today is a great day. Today marks the 
50th anniversary of title IX. For half a 
century, we have witnessed the impact 
title IX has had on generations of 
women in sports. Title IX provided 
women the long-denied platform that 
had always been afforded men. It en-
sured female athletes have the same 
access to funding, facilities, and ath-
letic scholarships, but it also gave 
young women the opportunity to com-
pete, to learn the life lessons of hard 
work and perseverance, to go to college 
on an athletic scholarship, to overcome 
obstacles in order to reach their God- 
given potential. 
Since 1972, female participation in 
sports at the college level has risen 
more than 600 percent, and today, 43 
percent of high school girls participate 
in some competitive sports, compared 
to 50 years ago—only 3 to 5 percent. 
What a turnaround. 
For all these reasons, decades later, 
we have proof that title IX has worked. 
Sports can transform lives. I have seen 
it. I began my coaching career as a 
high school girls basketball coach just 
a few years after title IX was enacted, 
and now, 50 years later, America’s fe-
male athletes are not only the best per-
forming on the world stage in team and 
individual sports, but they also are the 
leaders in our communities and in our 
country. 
Title IX sent an incredible—an in-
credible—message to female athletes 
across the Nation, which is, you can 
compete, you can win, and you will be 
afforded a fair and level playing field 
to do so. 
I have personally witnessed how title 
IX protections allowed young women 
to gain all the opportunities and life 
lessons that participating in sports has 
to offer. That is why, just 3 months 
into my time as a U.S. Senator, I intro-
duced an amendment to prohibit Fed-
eral funding to schools that allow bio-
logical males to compete in women’s 
sports. And I, along with 23 of my col-
leagues, introduced the Protection of 
Women and Girls in Sports Act. This 
bill would make it a violation of Fed-
eral law for a recipient of Federal funds 
who operates or sponsors athletic pro-
grams to permit biological males to 
compete in women’s sports activities. 
The bill also establishes the long-need-
ed definition of ‘‘sex’’ in title IX to be 
recognized based solely on a person’s 
reproductive biology and genetics at 
birth. 
Democrats have turned their backs 
on these efforts, and by doing so, they 
have turned their backs on female ath-
letes all across our country. Just last 
month, I sent a letter to U.S. Depart-
ment of Education Secretary Miguel 
Cardona warning the administration to 
rethink their rule change. 
On this 50th anniversary, we should 
be asking ourselves how we can pre-
serve title IX and preserve fairness for 
all female athletes across our country, 
but unfortunately, women’s athletics 
are currently under attack by the 
Biden administration. Just this morn-
ing, we learned that the Department of 
Education will publish a proposed rule 
to change title IX to align with the ad-
ministration’s 
progressive 
agenda. 
These proposed changes would allow bi-
ological males to compete in women’s 
sports. What a tragedy. It would take a 
wrecking ball to the five decades of 
title IX success for women. The Biden 
administration’s proposed rule flies in 
the face of the so-called science that 
Democrats are quick to pledge their al-
legiance to by ignoring the scientific

differences in the biological makeup of 
male and female athletes. Apparently, 
science only matters when it conforms 
to Democrats’ partisan agenda. 
Allowing biological males to compete 
in women’s sports will set women’s 
rights back 50 years, to a time before 
title IX. It will discourage young girls 
from entering the court, jumping in 
the pool, or walking onto the field, 
knowing that they have to compete 
with the deck stacked half against 
them, and the winner will already be 
determined. With the proposed rule 
change, 
female 
athletes 
can 
only 
hope—can only hope—to finish in sec-
ond or third place. There is no pregame 
speech or halftime talk that you can 
give a woman or girl who feels like 
they aren’t competing on a fair playing 
field. 
The Biden administration should do 
the right thing and rethink their deci-
sion to disenfranchise female athletes 
of the future. 
This fight is far from over. The very 
least the Senate can do for the future 
of female sports is to reinforce the pro-
tections already afforded women in 
title IX. 
Mr. President, that is why I call up S. 
251, the Protection of Women and Girls 
in Sports Act of 2021. I ask unanimous 
consent that the Committee on Health, 
Education, Labor, and Pensions be dis-
charged from further consideration of 
S. 251 and the Senate proceed to its im-
mediate consideration; further, that 
the bill be considered read a third time 
and passed and that the motion to re-
consider be considered made and laid 
upon the table. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
The Senator from Hawaii. 
Ms. HIRONO. Mr. President, reserv-
ing the right to object, I rise today in 
opposition to S. 251, legislation that 
would ban transgender women and girls 
from participating in sports consistent 
with their gender. 
My Republican colleagues falsely 
claim 
that 
allowing 
transgender 
women and girls to play sports is 
harmful to cisgender women and girls. 
They continue to hurl insulting lies 
about transgender girls dominating 
sports, but what is true is that these 
bans are deeply harmful to transgender 
girls, particularly transgender girls of 
color, girls who are gender-noncon-
forming or born with intersex traits, as 
well as cisgender girls. 
These sex tests invade every girl’s 
privacy and open the door to harass 
anyone who is perceived as different. 
If my Republican colleagues were ac-
tually worried about women and girls 
in athletics, they would join in our ef-
forts to address unequal athletic oppor-
tunities in school, unequal pay, sexual 
abuse and harassment, and more. But 
this isn’t about supporting women and 
girls; this is about discrimination. 
Earlier today, I stood in Statuary 
Hall as we unveiled the portrait of the 
late Congresswoman Patsy T. Mink on 
today’s 50th anniversary of title IX be-
coming law. Title IX, which was re-
named the Patsy T. Mink Equal Oppor-
tunity in Education Act, says: 
No person in the United States shall, on 
the basis of sex, be excluded from partici-
pating in, be denied the benefit of, or be sub-
jected to discrimination under any education 
program or activity receiving Federal finan-
cial assistance. 
Thirty-seven words that are just as 
relevant today as they were 50 years 
ago. 
Patsy fought for equal opportunities 
for all, and this bill stands in direct op-
position to her work. And to listen to 
my colleague talking about title IX as 
being that act that is going to support 
his bill, I can tell you, as someone who 
knew and was friends with Patsy T. 
Mink, she would be standing right next 
to me to say that title IX in no way or 
shape supports what my colleague is 
attempting to do. 
Republicans have the wrong prior-
ities. We shouldn’t be banning anyone 
from playing sports; we should be 
fighting the discrimination that all 
women and girls continue to face in 
athletics, in the classroom, and in 
workplaces. 
I am proud to stand up and oppose 
this harmful legislation and continue 
to advance Patsy Mink’s legacy of 
equal opportunities for all. 
Mr. President, for these reasons, I ob-
ject. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ob-
jection is heard. 
The Senator from Alabama. 
Mr. TUBERVILLE. Mr. President, 
what I would like to say about equal 
opportunity is that over the last few 
years, biological males playing in 
women’s sports have won 22 champion-
ships. 
The 
girls—other 
girls—were 
playing for second and third. 
I am disappointed that my colleague 
thinks this is not about equal rights. I 
am disappointed that my colleague 
won’t stand up for women and women’s 
rights. We should all be here fighting 
for the same thing. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. HAGERTY. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
SUPREME COURT SECURITY FUNDING ACT OF 2022 
Mr. HAGERTY. Mr. President, I rise 
today to speak in support of the Su-
preme Court Security Funding Act of 
2022, which I introduced with Senator 
WARNER
just last week. Yesterday 
evening, the Senate approved by unani-
mous consent this bipartisan legisla-
tion, which provides emergency secu-
rity resources to the Supreme Court of 
the United States and to the U.S. Mar-
shals Service. 
The House of Representatives must 
approve this bill without amendment 
or delay and send it to the President’s 
desk before adjourning this week. The 
need is urgent and obvious. There is no 
question the Supreme Court, its Jus-
tices, their families, and Court employ-
ees are under unprecedented and unex-
pected threat. This includes recent 
highly publicized threats against Jus-
tice 
Kavanaugh 
and 
Justice 
Sotomayor. These threats may well be-
come more acute in the coming weeks 
as the Court concludes its term. 
There is no question that protecting 
the Court from these threats requires 
additional resources in Fiscal Year 2022 
because unexpected resources are being 
deployed. 
This 
legislation 
provides 
those necessary resources. 
More specifically, the U.S. Marshals 
Service has been providing around-the- 
clock security for the nine Justices at 
their homes and needs 10.3 million in 
emergency funding to cover these costs 
for the remainder of this fiscal year. 
The Supreme Court needs 9.1 million to 
cover its increased security costs for 
this fiscal year. These include overtime 
pay for Supreme Court Police officers, 
mutual aid payment to assisting law 
enforcement agencies, and increased 
physical security around the Supreme 
Court Building. 
If Congress doesn’t immediately pro-
vide this funding, the Court and Mar-
shals Service may be forced to transfer 
funds from other critical functions and 
entities, like the U.S. District Courts 
and U.S. Courts of Appeal. That is an 
unacceptable outcome given the obvi-
ous and urgent need for this security 
funding and the gravity of the threat 
against one of our three constitutional 
branches. 
Congress recently passed—and the 
President signed into law—legislation 
by Senators CORNYN and COONS to in-
crease the scope of authorized Supreme 
Court Police protection to include the 
Justices’ immediate family members. 
Congress rightly provided this addi-
tional security authorization to pro-
tect the Court. 
These expanded authorities are im-
portant, but there should be no ques-
tion regarding whether Congress will 
separately provide the resources nec-
essary to protect the Supreme Court 
during its hour of need. 
I thank my colleague from Virginia, 
Senator WARNER, for working with me 
on this legislation. I also want to 
thank the senior Senator from Ala-
bama, Vice Chairman SHELBY, and his 
staff, as well as the senior Senator 
from Vermont, Chairman LEAHY, for 
their help and their guidance. Finally, 
I thank my Senate colleagues for their 
cooperation in ensuring the swift pas-
sage of this legislation in the Senate. 
Now, I urge the House of Representa-
tives to promptly send this bill to the 
President’s desk before it adjourns 
later this week. 
I yield the floor.

OFFICER

KING). The Senator from South Da-
kota.

June 23, 2022 
that definitely speaks to me. I am an 
outdoors guy through and through. I 
love pheasant hunting, boating, swim-
ming, running. I will shoot hoops 
whenever I get the chance, indoors or 
outdoors, but this is nothing better 
than doing it outdoors. 
When I was a kid, my dad attached a 
basket to a pole in our backyard, and 
there was nothing my siblings and I 
liked better than spending long sum-
mer days and sometimes fall days and 
spring days shooting hoops in our 
backyard in Murdo. 
The outdoors was a huge part of my 
life as a kid. We spent the long summer 
days outside, barring the hour every 
day my mother made us come inside to 
read. On summer evenings, my dad 
would take us to get ice cream cones, 
and then we would drive down to the 
White River to watch the sunset. 
Another outdoor pastime we em-
braced was hunting. My dad taught my 
siblings and me to hunt, and I loved 
going out with him. Pheasant hunting 
remains one of my favorite outdoor ac-
tivities, and I get excited every year as 
the third Saturday in October—the of-
ficial start to pheasant season—rolls 
around. 
It is a tradition that I am happy to 
be able to share with the next genera-
tion, as my dad shared it with me. 
There is nothing better than a day 
spent outdoors with friends and family, 
followed by a communal meal, some-
times involving pheasant. 
Being in the outdoors isn’t just en-
joyable; I think it is a part of the good 
life. The health benefits of time spent 
outdoors are well-established, and I 
know a day—or even an hour—out in 
the fresh air always clears my mind 
and refreshes my spirit. 
With more and more of our life spent 
in front of screens, I think time spent 
outdoors and disconnected is even more 
important than ever. I am grateful for 
all those hours we spent as kids run-
ning around outside and for family ac-
tivities outdoors, like our summer trip 
to the Black Hills. We used to go out 
there for Labor Day, stay in this little 
non-air-conditioned 
cabin 
and 
just 
enjoy the outdoors. 
We would hike, and we would visit 
caves. We would go to Mount Rush-
more, head to the lake—I loved and 
still love visiting Sylvan Lake in 
South Dakota. 
I loved being there with my parents 
and siblings, and I loved taking my 
daughters there on trips like the ones I 
took growing up. Nobody who visits 
South Dakota should miss the Black 
Hills. 
I am not sure there is a more beau-
tiful place on Earth—the interplay of 
light and shadow on the trees and 
rocks late on a summer afternoon, the 
endless South Dakota sky reflected in 
the blue of Sylvan Lake and other 
lakes in the Black Hills, the Milky 
Way carpeting the night sky with mil-
lions of diamonds. There is no better 
place to spend time in the great out-
doors than South Dakota. 
Our State is filled with natural won-
ders, the Missouri River, Jewel Cave 
and Wind Cave, two of the longest 
caves in the world. Together, they offer 
hundreds of miles of underground pas-
sageways to explore, filled with glim-
mering crystals and remarkable rock 
formations. 
We have the magnificent Black Hills 
National Forest in Custer State Park, 
rolling prairies, and, of course, the 
Badlands. If you haven’t experienced 
the rugged beauty of the Badlands, you 
are missing out—extraordinary layered 
rock formations that look like they 
might have come from another planet, 
a wealth of fossils. 
Everybody should see the sunset over 
the Badlands at least once in their life, 
turning the tops of the rocks to a sea 
of fiery orange. 
And, of course, no mention of South 
Dakota’s great outdoors would be com-
plete without a mention of Mount 
Rushmore, one of our national treas-
ures. Nature got a little help from man 
here, and the result is magnificent. 
You can’t help but be awed when you 
see Mount Rushmore soaring up in 
front of you. And you can’t help but 
feel a little prouder to be a citizen of 
this great land. 
Our Nation’s great outdoor spaces 
need to be cared for so that we can pre-
serve them for future generations— 
from wildlife enthusiasts to hikers and 
runners to farmers and ranchers. I am 
a longtime supporter of the Conserva-
tion Reserve Program. 
Agricultural producers are familiar 
with the Conservation Reserve Pro-
gram, or what we call CRP, which pro-
vides incentives for farmers, ranchers, 
and 
landowners 
to 
take 
environ-
mentally sensitive land out of produc-
tion for 10 to 15 years. 
The Conservation Reserve Program 
helps the environment by improving 
soil health and water quality and pro-
viding habitat for wildlife, including 
endangered and threatened species. I 
pushed for an increase in the CRP acre-
age cap in the 2018 farm bill, and the 
final bill raised that acreage cap to 27 
million acres. 
Currently, I am working on further 
improvements of CRP that I will work 
to get included in the 2023 farm bill. 
Based on my conversations with farm-
ers and ranchers, I developed the Con-
servation Reserve Program Improve-
ment Act, which I introduced in March. 
This legislation would make CRP graz-
ing a more attractive option by pro-
viding cost-share payments for all CRP 
practices for the establishment of graz-
ing infrastructure, including fencing 
and water distribution. 
It would also increase the annual 
payment limit for CRP—which has not 
changed since 1985—to help account for 
inflation and the increase in land 
value. 
This would enhance the appeal of 
CRP for farmers and ranchers, improv-
ing their bottom line while helping to 
protect the environment and increase 
wildlife habitat. 
Another priority of mine is improv-
ing forest management in the Black 
Hills National Forest to reduce the 
risk of wildfires and damaging insect 
infestations. 
I have introduced two pieces of legis-
lation during this Congress to help im-
prove management of our national for-
ests, including the Black Hills. Cur-
rently on-the-ground management ac-
tivities, including timber thinning, are 
significantly lagging in the Black Hills 
National 
Forest 
and 
other 
forests 
throughout the country. 
My Expediting Forest Restoration 
and Recovery Act would require the 
U.S. Forest Service to expedite treat-
ment of more than 70 million acres of 
National Forest System lands to re-
duce the threat of insect and disease 
infestations and catastrophic wildfires. 
My Black Hills Forest Protection and 
Jobs Preservation Act is also designed 
to help expedite forest management 
projects in the Black Hills and else-
where. The bill, which I introduced 
with my Wyoming colleague, Senator 
JOHN BARRASSO, would require the U.S. 
Forest Service to quickly issue Na-
tional Environmental Policy Act deci-
sions that are necessary to carry out 
forest management projects, including 
thinning of overly dense timber stands 
in the Black Hills National Forest. 
Our bill would also expedite timber 
production projects in the Black Hills 
National Forest and neighboring na-
tional forests to help maintain the tim-
ber sale program that plays a critical 
role in keeping these forests healthy 
while also supporting the regional 
economy. 
I am grateful to live in a State that 
has so much to offer when it comes to 
the great outdoors. And I will continue 
to work to protect and preserve our na-
tional treasures, and I hope every 
American will take advantage of Great 
Outdoors Month to get outside and 
enjoy our natural world. 
I yield the floor.

FIXING OUR REGULATORY MAY-
HEM UPSETTING LITTLE AMERI-
CANS ACT 
Mr. LEE. Mr. President, for months, 
American moms and dads have endured 
an unprecedented baby formula short-
age. 
All of us know someone that this cri-
sis has personally affected. In May 
alone, reports showed that the out-of- 
stock rate jumped from 43 percent to 74 
percent nationally. In my home State 
of Utah, that out-of-stock rate is much 
higher. 
And while the Biden administration 
made ambitious attempts to invoke the 
Defense Production Act and fly in for-
mula from other countries, these ef-
forts ultimately provided less than 2 
days’ worth of formula for our coun-
try’s hungry babies—less than 2 days. 
So yesterday, I took to the floor ask-
ing that this body take immediate ac-
tion to address our Nation’s massive

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S3109 
June 23, 2022 
formula shortage by unanimously pass-
ing my FORMULA Act, something that 
I have come repeatedly to the Senate 
floor in an effort to pass and it has 
been met with objections so far. 
My bill included three measures to 
accomplish this goal. The first was a 
regulatory component, one that would 
remove certain FDA requirements for 
imported formula, mostly dealing with 
labeling. And I will explain more about 
that one in a moment. The second re-
moved the restrictions that limited the 
availability of formula brands avail-
able to WIC recipients. And, finally, 
the bill temporarily suspended import 
tariffs on formula, increasing supply 
and decreasing consumer costs. 
These three components would pro-
vide immediate relief to anxiety-ridden 
parents who were forced to scour super-
markets, make dangerous homemade 
formula, or, even worse, hospitalize 
their infants. 
I need not explain why a problem of 
this magnitude is so deserving of our 
immediate attention. 
After addressing the Senate on each 
of these topics, I engaged in a lengthy 
and substantive debate with my friend 
and distinguished colleague from Penn-
sylvania, Senator BOB CASEY. I listened 
intently to his objections regarding his 
concern for the safety and quality of 
formula crossing over our borders. 
And while I appreciate my col-
league’s concerns, I still believe that 
this body can and must fix this prob-
lem, a problem that is, no doubt, the 
sole creation of the Federal Govern-
ment. It is no accident, for example, 
that we are the only country facing 
this particular shortage. 
No other country is dealing with this 
because our country and our own Fed-
eral laws in this area and the way they 
have been enforced and implemented 
have caused it. 
So I am determined to provide relief 
to 
families 
dealing 
with 
this 
inexplicably, unnecessarily prolonged 
crisis. 
For far too long, the people enduring 
this mess have gone without answers. 
And so in the spirit of comity and com-
promise, I have modified my request by 
removing the FDA regulatory compo-
nent of the bill. I hoped that this would 
resolve any reservations that my col-
league from Pennsylvania may have 
had regarding the safety of these prod-
ucts. 
And I should add here, those concerns 
are not concerns that I agree with for 
the simple reason that the countries 
that, under my bill, we would have al-
lowed to produce formula, to have that 
formula introduced into the United 
States, they are countries that we have 
already identified as having safe regu-
latory systems. 
They are countries with regulatory 
systems that are strong enough, in 
fact, that we allow imports of their 
pharmaceutical products produced in 
those countries because their standards 
are as rigorous as those imposed by our 
own FDA. 
Nonetheless, I offered to remove that 
and made that a request for passage by 
unanimous consent. Still, my friend 
objected to expanding the range of 
products available to WIC recipients. 
Remember, this component to the bill 
would have simply allowed American 
moms and dads who were beneficiaries 
under the WIC program to use their 
vouchers to purchase any form of for-
mula they would prefer, or more com-
monly these days, any form of formula 
that is available. Whereas, right now, 
the WIC vouchers require you to stick 
to the brand specified on the vouchers 
in question. 
My distinguished colleague objected 
also to that version of what I offered, 
despite the retention of FDA regu-
latory authority and the fact that 
wealthy Americans are personally im-
porting these products already from 
Europe. 
And while I find this unfortunate, I 
was still determined to make an argu-
ment and to, ultimately, formulate an 
agreement consistent with that argu-
ment to fix a problem that our Federal 
Government has made and has created 
and in which it has made no discernible 
progress in its attempts to resolve it. 
So, again, in the spirit of comity and 
compromise and a willingness to do ab-
solutely whatever it takes to provide 
whatever relief we can provide to hun-
gry babies throughout America suf-
fering from malnutrition, I modified 
my request yet again. This time to in-
clude only the provisions related to the 
tariff suspension. 
And while I am hopeful that we will 
be able to come together to address the 
concerns of my colleagues and pass the 
first two provisions of my bill as well, 
I hope to report today to families 
across the country that my legislation 
has achieved unanimous support and 
passed the Senate. 
This would be an incredible win for 
families and for hungry babies nation-
wide. My bill would make meaningful 
headway in dealing with an issue that 
some doctors call ‘‘the worst crisis of 
their careers.’’ 
By suspending the import tariff on 
formula imports or providing cheaper 
access to formulas to individual con-
sumers and to retailers alike, no longer 
will access to these safe formulas be 
limited to a select group of wealthy in-
dividuals because, again, wealthy indi-
viduals have been able to pay the high-
er prices and suffer the inconvenience 
of going online or otherwise making a 
special order on their own of these Eu-
ropean formulas. 
Again, these European formulas from 
the countries that we are talking 
about—countries covered by the bill— 
are countries that produce safe, effec-
tive formula and that are regulated by 
regulatory bodies that are every bit as 
stringent as the U.S. Food and Drug 
Administration. And on that basis, in 
fact, we import pharmaceutical prod-
ucts from those same countries. 
Currently, formula is produced in 
those countries, countries like France 
and Switzerland and the United King-
dom. Babies there do just fine on those 
formulas. In fact, they do great. And 
some American families have been able 
to benefit from those formulas as they 
have ordered it online, but they pay 
higher prices, and they have to deal 
with restrictions that make it more 
difficult to access those things. So this 
bill will open that up. 
This is relief that really is long over-
due, particularly for Utahns who have 
the largest families, the most children 
per capita, and, also, the highest birth-
rate. 
Not coincidentally, those are some of 
the same reasons why the baby formula 
shortage is felt so acutely in Utah, but 
it is being felt acutely throughout the 
United States. 
I hope that we can come together and 
pass even more meaningful reforms 
that will help solve the problem com-
pletely and once and for all. 
I am grateful, however, that the 
countless hours of behind-the-scenes 
work and successful negotiations with 
my colleagues on a bipartisan basis 
have resulted in a win for the most vul-
nerable Americans. Passing my FOR-
MULA Act is a victory for families and 
for babies in Utah and everywhere else 
in the United States. 
And so, to that end, I ask unanimous 
consent that the Senate proceed to the 
immediate consideration of Calendar 
No. 372, S. 4261. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will report the bill by title. 
The bill clerk read as follows: 
A bill (S. 4261) to suspend duties and other 
restrictions on the importation of infant for-
mula to address the shortage of infant for-
mula in the United States, and for other pur-
poses. 
There being no objection, the Senate 
proceeded to consider the bill. 
Mr. LEE. I ask unanimous consent 
that the Lee substitute amendment at 
the desk be considered and agreed to; 
that the bill, as amended, be considered 
read a third time and passed; and that 
the motion to reconsider be considered 
made and laid upon the table. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
The amendment (No. 5130), in the na-
ture of a substitute, was agreed to, as 
follows: 
(Purpose: In the nature of a substitute) 
Strike all after the enacting clause and in-
sert the following: 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Fixing Our 
Regulatory Mayhem Upsetting Little Ameri-
cans Act’’ or the ‘‘FORMULA Act’’. 
SEC. 2. DUTY-FREE TREATMENT OF IMPORTS OF 
INFANT FORMULA. 
(a) IN GENERAL.—During the 90-day period 
beginning on the date of the enactment of 
this Act, infant formula shall enter the 
United States free of duty and free of quan-
titative limitation. 
(b) INFANT FORMULA DEFINED.—In this sec-
tion, the term ‘‘infant formula’’ has the 
meaning given that term in section 201(z) of 
the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act 
(21 U.S.C. 321(z)).

Mr. HICKENLOOPER. Mr. President, 
I ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
The Senator from Colorado. 
S. 2938 
Mr. HICKENLOOPER. Mr. President, 
next month marks an anniversary that 
nobody wants to celebrate: 10 years 
since 70 people were shot and 12 killed 
while sitting in a movie theater in Au-
rora, CO. 
At the time, it was the largest mass 
shooting in American history. Since 
then, several shootings, like the Pulse 
Nightclub and the Las Vegas shooting, 
have surpassed that grim milestone. 
Most Senators have a similar story of 
some sort of a mass shooting in their 
State that killed people who were try-
ing to enjoy a movie or worship God or 
shop for groceries like the 10 people 
murdered last year in a supermarket in 
Boulder or sitting in a fourth grade 
classroom. Mass shootings have be-
come uniquely American, a problem 
that has grown consistently in the 23 
years since the Columbine school at-
tack shook us all. There were seven 
school shootings that year. Last year, 
there were 42. 
The Aurora shooting happened when 
I was Governor, and it has stayed with 
me, as those things do. Friday, July 20, 
2012, almost 10 years ago—it was a 
local premiere of ‘‘The Dark Knight,’’ 
and it was a packed house. Every seat 
had a person in it, a person with loved 
ones and ones who loved them who ex-
pected them to come home that night. 
I arrived the next morning at the 
scene and walked into the command 
center that the FBI and the police were 
using. Aurora Police Chief Dan Oates 
showed us a video of the crime scene 
that had been taken by police shortly 
before, using a hand-held camera. The 
images haunt me still: popcorn every-
where mixed with bullet casings, ran-
dom clothing, and blood. There was 
blood all over the seats and the floor. 
Aurora Mayor Steve Hogan and I 
spent the afternoon visiting hospitals 
all over town. We visited almost every 
surviving wounded victim. In the days 
and weeks and months after that day, 
we had the gun debate in Colorado. Of 
course, we had the debate. What kind 
of a State would we be if we were too 
scared to go to a movie? The debate 
was difficult and hard to find agree-
ment. 
Guns are a tradition in the West, and 
Colorado is no exception. We became 
the first purple State to successfully 
pass gun safety laws. Coloradans, in-
cluding the vast majority of gun own-
ers, wanted to get something done. 
That 
led 
to 
universal 
background 
checks and a ban on high-capacity 
magazines; not everything—not every-
thing—that we wanted but steps that 
made a real difference. We didn’t want 
dangerous people to have guns. 
One night while I was Governor, I 
came home tired and cranky in the 
midst of working on these gun laws. I 
made the mistake of complaining to 
my 
11-year-old 
son 
Teddy. 
Teddy 
couldn’t find it in him to understand 
why it was so hard. He asked me: Dad, 
why don’t you just make the decision? 
It is easy. Get the facts, make a deci-
sion, check, next. 
I started to explain, and he repeated: 
Get the facts, make a decision, check, 
next. 
He said: Every day I go into school, 
and I have to learn something com-
pletely new that I didn’t know existed 
the day before. If I don’t get it com-
pletely right, the next day is misery 
because everything is based on the day 
before. 
Teddy was right about one thing: The 
facts do matter. Part of our problem 
has been not having good data. Many 
assume passing new laws like back-
ground checks or magazine limits 
wouldn’t work because crooks don’t 
buy guns from legal dealers. The facts 
proved that they very much do. In 2013, 
2,782 convicted felons tried to buy a 
gun in Colorado and were stopped. 
Even last year, nearly a decade later, 
3,539 convicted felons were blocked 
from buying a gun. Laws can work to 
keep guns out of the hands of dan-
gerous people. 
The solutions are often straight-
forward. Nonpartisan facts and basic 
data help us cut through the noise of 
division. Guns can be a divisive issue, 
to say the least, but we don’t accept 
that there is no room to get things 
done. 
The Bipartisan Safer Communities 
Act proves that. For the first time in 
three decades, Congress is poised to 
pass gun legislation that will make 
Americans safer, and it is based on the 
very simple principle: We all agree we 
should keep guns out of the hands of 
dangerous people. 
The bill will give States the re-
sources to implement red flag laws to 
prevent people who are a danger to 
themselves or others from buying or 
having guns. It will finally close the 
boyfriend loophole that allows con-
victed domestic abusers to get fire-
arms. It will strengthen background 
checks for 18- to 21-year-olds and take 
mental health into account and will 
crack down on strawman purchases 
that allow criminals to dodge back-
ground checks altogether. 
Now, these are commonsense pro-
posals, and I am heartened to see that 
they are going to pass with bipartisan 
support, but we all know there is more 
that needs to be done to reduce gun vi-
olence in America. 
The question is, What is next? 
For that, we can turn to Teddy’s wis-
dom as an 11-year-old. What we need is 
a common set of facts that both sides 
can accept and can act on. 
In 1970, Congress created the Na-
tional Highway Traffic Safety Admin-
istration to respond to the public out-
cry over fatal vehicle crashes. By 2019, 
there were 60 percent fewer vehicle fa-
talities than in 1970. So in that period 
from 1970 to 2019, fatalities were re-
duced 60 percent, even though there are 
now 21⁄2 times as many cars on the 
roads. 
The Agency’s strength is in its strict-
ly nonpartisan research. It conducts a 
survey and a detailed analysis of vehi-
cle fatalities across the country and 
forms an objective basis to evaluate ve-
hicle safety standards and procedures— 
things like whether airbags and seat-
belts can make a difference or what 
size and shape child restraints should 
take, essentially every safety feature 
in our cars today. 
Why can’t we have something similar 
for guns? We now have more gun 
deaths in America than we have deaths 
from car crashes, and yet for years, we 
could barely discuss possible solutions. 
So while this Chamber is working to-
gether, let’s make sure we measure the 
success of these bills that we are about 
to pass. Let’s think about establishing 
a research body that will create an ob-
jective baseline of hard facts, not con-
ventional wisdom. The path forward is 
as simple as my 11-year-old son knew it 
to be a decade ago: Get the facts, make 
a decision, check, next. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Vermont. 
CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, as Sen-
ators are preparing to return home to 
their home States over the Fourth of 
July, it is frustrating to me that we 
once again kick the can down the road 
on providing needed funding to address 
the ongoing COVID pandemic. 
For months, the administration, sci-
entists, and healthcare experts have 
raised the alarm that we don’t have the 
resources we need to stay ahead of this 
virus. And actually with COVID, if you 
are not staying ahead of it, you are 
slipping behind, to the detriment of all 
Americans. 
To keep our recovery afloat, we have 
robbed Peter to pay Paul. Earlier this 
month, the administration announced 
that it is repurposing $10 billion that 
we appropriated in Congress—$10 bil-
lion—to purchase additional vaccines 
and additional therapeutics because 
our stocks are running low. 
The action by the administration, 
unfortunately, was necessary. Projec-
tions indicate that as many as 100 mil-
lion Americans—100 million Ameri-
cans—nearly 1 in 3, will be infected or 
reinfected with COVID this fall and 
winter as our immunity from this dis-
ease wanes.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S3111 
June 23, 2022 
The President requested COVID fund-
ing. President Biden requested that 3 
months ago. Republicans have blocked 
this funding. Without new funding ap-
propriated by Congress, the adminis-
tration is left with no choice but to re-
purpose that $10 billion. Even that, ex-
perts across the board agree, is totally 
insufficient to prepare for the coming 
surge. 
But even this necessary choice has 
consequences. To pay for these vac-
cines and therapeutics, the administra-
tion had to take funding from research 
for the next generation of vaccines and 
to sustain our testing capacity. It was 
not, as some Republican Members have 
indicated, excess cash that was simply 
there for the taking. This means that 
as the next surge crashes over the 
country, we will not have the resources 
necessary to assure that people can get 
tested. 
Have we already forgotten the mad 
scramble driving from pharmacy to 
pharmacy to get a rapid test so we 
could safely spend the holidays with 
our friends and families just 6 months 
ago? It means that as new variants will 
emerge, we are not going to have the 
necessary resources to adequately con-
tinue the groundbreaking research we 
have 
supported 
for next-generation 
vaccines. 
And fueled by our waning immunity 
and insufficient vaccination efforts 
abroad, new variants could emerge, and 
those will impose new threats to us 
here at home. 
The desperate measures taken by the 
administration, which they had to do 
in the absence of congressional action, 
do nothing to support a global vaccina-
tion effort that is running on fumes. 
The U.S. Agency for International De-
velopment, which manages our global 
response to the COVID pandemic, has 
already obligated more than 95 percent 
of the funds they have available—95. 
Soon, they will have no choice but to 
start shutting down their vaccine de-
livery operations. That will mean more 
mutations, more variants, more infec-
tions, and more deaths abroad and at 
home. 
Keep in mind what we are doing with 
USAID. We are trying to stop this pan-
demic outside our borders because we 
realize that every single one of these 
variants is one airplane trip away from 
crossing our borders even as we have to 
do things to stop it within our borders. 
Finally, I want to make clear that we 
don’t have time to say, ‘‘Well, we can 
act later on,’’ as this is not a problem 
that can be solved by flipping a switch, 
or to produce the tens of millions of 
doses of vaccines and therapeutics nec-
essary to prepare for a fall surge. The 
government and biotech companies 
need to begin purchasing supplies now. 
They can’t say: Oh, we have an epi-
demic. Golly, go out and buy some sup-
plies. 
Well, we have to make them first. 
Come back to us in a few months. 
That doesn’t do anything for the peo-
ple who are getting hit with COVID. 
The longer we wait, the further we 
will fall behind as other countries will 
place their orders ahead of ours. 
I tell my friends on the other side of 
the aisle who are blocking this money: 
We can’t wait and see what happens. 
That is why we were wholly unprepared 
for the pandemic in the first place. You 
will recall the last administration said: 
We will wait and see what happens. 
We refused to invest and prepare for 
the worst. Let’s prepare for the worst. 
We can hope for the best, but hope is 
not a vaccine. Preparation can create 
vaccines. I am frustrated, once again, 
that we are leaving town without ad-
dressing this looming crisis. Since 
March, I have called on us to act. 
As chairman of the Senate Appro-
priations Committee, I will continue to 
make these calls, and I will fight for 
these urgently needed resources, but 
we have to wake up to the fact that we 
have to do it now. You don’t do it after 
the epidemic hits. You don’t do the re-
search after. You try to do the research 
before and hope you can stop the pan-
demic from happening. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. VAN 
HOLLEN). The Senator from Colorado. 
S. 2938 
Mr. BENNET. Mr. President, this 
morning, the Supreme Court weakened 
gun safety laws in America for the first 
time in over a decade. It gutted a cen-
tury’s-old law to make sure that people 
carrying concealed weapons actually 
needed them. The Court is taking us 
backward at a time when the American 
people are demanding that we do more, 
not less, to protect our communities. 
The shooting at Columbine High 
School happened the year before my 
oldest daughter was born. She is now 22 
years old. We have raised three daugh-
ters, and their entire generation has 
grown up in the shadow of gun vio-
lence. Since Columbine, my State has 
endured one tragedy after another. 
In 2012, a gunman killed 12 people at 
a movie theater in Aurora. 
In 2019, a shooter injured eight stu-
dents at a STEM high school in High-
lands Ranch. 
Last March, a shooter killed 10 peo-
ple at the King Soopers grocery store 
in Boulder. That was almost a year to 
the day, really, of the shootings in Buf-
falo, which took another 10 lives of 
people who had just gone to shop for 
their families. 
Two months after that grocery store 
shooting in Colorado, a gunman killed 
six people at a birthday party in Colo-
rado Springs. 
Now, I remember back—it is hard be-
cause, over time, you lose track of 
things—in 2017, after a gunman in Las 
Vegas killed 58 Americans after shoot-
ing across the street from a hotel 
room. I came to work the following 
Monday, and I realized at about three- 
quarters of the way through the day 
that nobody had talked to me about 
the shooting. I don’t know whether it 
was the shooting before that or the two 
or three or four before that when we 
became so desensitized that 58 people 
could be killed in Las Vegas, and it 
wasn’t even mentioned the following 
Monday. 
We cannot allow this to become nor-
mal in this country, and the people of 
Colorado have refused for this to be-
come normal in this country. It is not 
just mass shootings; it is the daily 
shootings that stalk our communities 
like the West Side of Chicago, where I 
have spent time with my friend Arne 
Duncan who, after being the Secretary 
of Education, has gone back to his 
hometown to try to keep young men 
from killing. They can’t afford for us 
to continue to just move on and forget 
that it ever happened. Communities, 
once they have been savaged by some-
thing like the Aurora movie theater 
shooting or the Columbine shooting, 
never move on. 
The pages here are a little bit young-
er than my daughters are, but I can 
tell you that there is a whole genera-
tion of Americans that has grown up in 
this country savaged by gun violence 
and the prospect that it could happen 
to them when they go to school the 
next day or the next week. You can see 
it. You can see kids sitting on the 
couch, cringing, when they are watch-
ing the television reports, wondering 
whether that is going to be them or 
their classmates. 
They have carried a burden that no 
generation of Americans has ever had 
to carry. No generation of humans liv-
ing in the industrialized world has had 
to carry this particular burden. Today, 
our kids are growing up with a reason-
able fear that they could get shot in 
their schools or in their temples or in 
their churches. 
I didn’t grow up in a country with 
more gun-related deaths than in vir-
tually any country in the industri-
alized world. That was not the country 
I grew up in. I grew up in a country 
with a Second Amendment but not a 
country with more shootings than any-
place else in the industrialized world. 
Our attitude about this has changed. It 
is different from what our parents and 
grandparents believed, no matter what 
party they were in. 
After a shooting, I heard somebody 
on the radio—some well-known talk 
show host—say that this was just the 
price of freedom, that being victimized 
in a mass shooting or being worried 
that your family members could be 
killed in a mass shooting was just the 
price of freedom. That is not what free-
dom meant to America when I was 
growing 
up. 
Partly 
what 
freedom 
means is being free from the fear that 
you are going to get gunned down. 
That is a freedom, and we have denied 
that freedom to the next generation of 
Americans. What a shame that some-
body would say something like that 
after a mass shooting. What a limited 
view of what freedom is. What a sur-
render that represents to our children 
and the victims of these crimes. 
In 2020, the leading cause of death for 
kids in America was guns—guns—not

June 23, 2022 
car accidents, not drugs but guns. 
There was a study that looked at how 
many kids, ages 4 or younger, had been 
killed by guns across 29 industrialized 
countries. This was of kids 4 or young-
er in 29 industrialized countries. The 
United States accounted for 97 percent 
of the deaths. This country accounted 
for 97 percent of the deaths of kids who 
were 4 years old and under. What a dis-
grace. What an indictment. The entire 
rest of the industrialized world ac-
counted for 3 percent. We accounted for 
97 percent. We have nearly 200 times 
the rate of violent gun deaths as Japan 
or South Korea and nearly 100 times 
what they experience in the United 
Kingdom. 
I can tell you, speaking as a father, it 
is not because we love our children any 
less or because we are uniquely violent 
or that somehow we have got a mental 
health problem that other countries 
don’t have or that we are mentally 
more unwell, which I hear some people 
say. It is because we have a U.S. Sen-
ate, year after year after year, that has 
been paralyzed by the National Rifle 
Association, by the NRA. We have a 
Senate that has allowed our kids to get 
shot in schools, in movie theaters, in 
grocery stores, and at concerts but has 
offered nothing but thoughts and pray-
ers. We have a Senate that, until now, 
has failed to respond to the over-
whelming demand of the American peo-
ple to protect our communities. 
That is what I hear when I go home. 
I live in a Western State. As you will 
hear, we have been able to enact mean-
ingful gun reforms in my State. If we 
can make progress in a Western State 
like Colorado, where people are de-
manding it—Democrats, Independents, 
Republicans, and most importantly, all 
of our children are demanding it—we 
can do it here. I have said it over and 
over and over again on this floor after 
we have had mass shooting after mass 
shooting across our country. Finally, 
for the first time in a decade, we have 
the chance to make progress. 
I want to thank my colleagues. I 
really do. I don’t mean that in the 
usual way that people do when they 
come out here and say, you know, ‘‘I 
thank my colleagues.’’ I want to thank 
my colleagues CHRIS MURPHY and JOHN 
CORNYN for leading this really impor-
tant bipartisan effort. 
I strongly support what they have 
put forward, which would strengthen 
background checks for young people 
buying firearms, so we are checking 
their 
mental 
health 
and 
juvenile 
records. 
It would help States strengthen their 
red flag laws, which would help keep 
guns out of the hands of people who are 
a threat to themselves or others. We 
passed a bill like that already in Colo-
rado. 
It would make a historic investment 
in mental health and school security. I 
said a minute ago that sometimes you 
just hear people talking about how we 
have mental health, and I pointed out 
that we probably have got the same 
mental health that other countries in 
the world have, but that doesn’t mean 
that it is not an issue. It is an issue. 
We are having an epidemic of mental 
health and behavioral health on the 
back end of this pandemic, especially 
among adolescents in this country and 
in the State of Colorado. There is $15 
billion in this bill for mental health, 
and I am proud that that is in there. 
That is a historic investment, and it is 
both sides that are making it. 
We are going to close the boyfriend 
loophole, which allows abusive part-
ners to buy a gun. We are going to 
crack down on straw purchases, where 
people illegally buy guns on behalf of 
someone else. That is a big problem we 
are going to address in this bill. 
Frankly, I don’t know how anybody 
on this floor could object to any of 
those ideas. I don’t know how anyone 
could go home and say they opposed in-
vesting in mental health or making 
sure they are not letting a troubled 18- 
year-old have access to an AR–15 or 
some other weapon. 
On that point, this can’t be the end of 
our work. There is more for us to do. 
We should raise the age for buying a 
semiautomatic weapon from 18 to 21. 
We should pass universal background 
checks. In Colorado, after Columbine, 
we 
passed 
universal 
background 
checks. I have said it over and over 
again on this floor. Every year, some-
where around 3 percent of the people 
who try to buy a gun can’t buy a gun 
in Colorado. Do you know why they 
can’t buy a gun? Because they are con-
victed felons, because they are mur-
derers, because they are domestic abus-
ers. 
In the 10, 12 years that I have been 
coming down here talking about this, I 
have challenged people. I have said: 
Come tell me why Colorado is not safer 
with that law in place. There is nobody 
who has ever come here and said, ‘‘Here 
is why you are not safer,’’ because ob-
viously we are safe. The country would 
be safer and Colorado would be safer if 
we pass background checks at the na-
tional level. 
We should close the gun show loop-
hole. We should limit the size of maga-
zines, which we also have done in my 
Western State of Colorado. We should 
ban bump stocks. People in Colorado 
and across the country overwhelmingly 
support these steps. But in the mean-
time, let’s pass this bipartisan pro-
posal. 
A few weekends ago—it was actually 
over the Memorial Day weekend—I had 
high school kids—not in the same place 
and not just one—literally coming up 
to me in tears out of desperation that 
we were not responding to what had 
happened in Texas and we hadn’t done 
anything in this country about guns. I 
think we need to show them and the 
young people who are here today, the 
young people who are living all over 
America, that we aren’t so broken that 
we can’t respond to one more massacre 
of kids at a school. We need to show 
them when we have this opportunity to 
demonstrate that we are not going to 
fail again and that we can succeed in 
passing this bipartisan bill and that, 
after all these years, we can meet the 
American people’s reasonable expecta-
tion to begin to protect our commu-
nities against gun violence that hap-
pens in the United States of America 
and only in the United States of Amer-
ica. 
With that, I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from California. 
Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, our 
country is still mourning the tragic 
shootings in Buffalo and Uvalde in 
which a total of 31 innocent people 
were gunned down by teenagers using 
weapons of war. 
While these terrible events get our 
attention and have in this case galva-
nized the Senate to act, they are only 
2 of the 279 shootings that have taken 
place this year. So it is good that the 
Senate is now considering legislation 
to address the epidemic of gun vio-
lence. 
The Bipartisan Safer Communities 
Act, which we are now considering, is a 
good, albeit modest, bill. I am particu-
larly pleased to see that two issues I 
have prioritized are addressed in this 
bill. The first is grants to State red 
flag laws, like the law in my home 
State of California, which has proven 
effective at removing guns by people 
who have been found by a court to pos-
sess a threat, and a provision closing 
the boyfriend loophole, which has let 
too many domestic abusers continue to 
possess firearms. 
However, while this bill is a step in 
the right direction, it is far from the 
bold action that we need to address 
mass shootings that occur on a daily 
basis. It remains too easy for private 
citizens to obtain weapons of war in 
this country. Sadly, this bill does very 
little to address that tragic reality. 
Almost 30 years ago, in 1993, I stood 
on this floor and offered the amend-
ment to ban the sale and possession of 
assault weapons. That goal was simple: 
Limit access to weapons of war that 
have no place on our streets. And guess 
what? It worked. In the 10 years the as-
sault weapons ban was law, gun mas-
sacres dropped 37 percent. After the 
ban lapsed in 2004, gun massacres rose 
by 183 percent. That is a big difference. 
Back then, a different shooting was 
on the minds of Americans: the 101 
California Street shooting in my home-
town of San Francisco, where a dis-
turbed man entered a law firm and 
killed eight people. For many, this 
tragedy was a wake-up call that re-
quired action. And we did act. 
Now, 30 years later, teenagers are 
able to purchase AR–15s, multiple high- 
capacity magazines, and shoot up a 
grocery store or elementary school, 
and we are left mourning the deaths of 
innocent people and asking, what is the 
solution? 
I applaud the sponsors of the legisla-
tion now before the Senate, but I have 
to ask, what will it take for us to hear

the wake-up call and pass stronger gun 
legislation? Our Nation, our children, 
are under constant attack. Nowhere is 
safe. There are mass shootings at 
schools, at churches, in synagogues, 
newspaper offices, stores, movie thea-
ters, on and on. It is simply too easy to 
get a weapon designed to kill as many 
people as possible. Today’s legislation 
will help, but there is so much more we 
could and should be doing. 
Our gun laws are lax, and they make 
it too simple for anyone—even those 
we know are prone to violence—to ob-
tain a weapon. This is especially true 
of teenagers. Even though they can’t 
buy a beer or a pack of cigarettes, they 
can buy an AR–15 assault rifle and 
thousands of rounds of ammunition 
once they turn 18 years old. The results 
are heartbreaking. In Uvalde, 19 chil-
dren and 2 teachers were massacred 
last month because an 18-year-old was 
able to buy an assault weapon. Just 10 
days earlier in Buffalo, 10 people were 
shot to death in a grocery store be-
cause an 18-year-old was able to buy an 
assault weapon. The common denomi-
nator in so many mass shootings today 
is assault weapons. 
I understand the Senators who nego-
tiated the bill couldn’t reach agree-
ment on this issue. Consequently, the 
bill fails to prevent teenagers—teen-
agers—from buying assault weapons. 
Under current law, a Federal fire-
arms licensee may not sell or deliver a 
handgun to a buyer younger than 21; 
however, this commonsense protection 
does not apply to purchases of assault 
weapons. This disparity actually costs 
lives. 
It is simple logic: If you can’t buy a 
beer, you shouldn’t be able to buy an 
assault weapon. If you can’t buy a 
handgun, you shouldn’t be able to buy 
an AR–15. That is why I introduced, 
along with 13 of my colleagues, the Age 
21 Act. I have also filed it as an amend-
ment on the bill before us. 
The bill would raise the minimum 
age to purchase assault weapons and 
high-capacity ammunition from 18 to 
21. So before you have a powerful weap-
on, before you buy big bullets, you 
have to at least be 21 years old. I don’t 
think that is too much to ask. 
This commonsense reform has public 
support among both Democrats and Re-
publicans. A recent POLITICO poll 
showed that 88 percent of Democrats 
and 68 percent of Republicans support 
requiring people to be 21 or older to 
purchase a firearm. 
I believe that failing now to act and 
address the ease with which teenagers 
can buy assault weapons is really a 
grave mistake. And make no mistake 
about it, it will cost lives. So now is 
the time to act. 
I urge my colleagues to support the 
Age 21 Act and pass it before the next 
massacre. I hope these words are heard. 
I hope people understand. I hope there 
is no more killing of young people this 
way. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. MANCHIN. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
Mr. MANCHIN. Mr. President, I rise 
today to acknowledge the years of bi-
partisan hard work on one of the most 
challenging subjects we have here, 
which is gun violence, mental illness, 
and all the things that basically con-
tribute to these horrible, horrible trag-
edies. Something has to be done, and 
something has been done. 
There are going to be people who 
look at the piece of legislation we are 
about to pass in a bipartisan way and 
say that it is not enough. I can under-
stand that. There are going to be other 
people saying that it is too much, that 
it is the camel’s nose under the tent 
and they want to take my guns away. 
I can understand their concern because 
people have scared them. It is a con-
stitutional amendment. That is not 
going to happen. 
So what I want to reaffirm is, myself 
coming from a little town—Farm-
ington, WV—being raised in a gun cul-
ture, growing up in a gun culture—my 
father was not a sportsman. He was not 
a gun person. But he wanted to make 
sure I had access to people who knew 
how and lived in this culture and who 
knew how to teach me properly. 
So, growing up, they had what they 
called the Farmington Sportsman’s 
Club. These were a lot of the men who 
worked in the mines who kind of took 
us under their wing, all us young kids. 
They taught us gun safety. They called 
it ‘‘gun sense.’’ We are going to teach 
you some gun sense, JOE. I said OK. 
And I understood it. Gun sense—it is 
the sensible thing you do with a gun. It 
is the law-abiding thing law-abiding 
gun owners do. The first thing they 
teach you is the safety of how to han-
dle the gun. It is never loaded. It is al-
ways broken down before you go into 
the woods, before you prepare to hunt 
or if you are going to shoot, whatever 
you are going to do. They would teach 
us about that. They would teach us ev-
erything they possibly could, and then 
they explained to us why they were 
teaching us. 
They said: First of all, the most im-
portant thing to know when you ac-
quire a weapon—and it is a weapon—it 
is basically to feed your family, to de-
fend your family, and basically the 
sporting of skeet shooting or target 
shooting. 
I said: I got it. I understand. 
They said: Do you understand this? 
I said: What? 
You never sell your gun to a strang-
er—never, ever, ever. If you don’t know 
the person, that is not someone you 
want to sell to until you know exactly 
who they are and what their intent 
may be. 
Fine. So that is part of my gun cul-
ture: You never sell your gun to a 
stranger. 
He said: You never loan your gun— 
even to a family member who is not re-
sponsible. If you deem them to be not 
a responsible person and you have not 
trusted them by giving them your car 
or doing anything with them with any 
valuables you had, why would you loan 
them your gun? It is a dangerous—you 
know, they don’t know how to do it. 
They won’t, basically, take care of it 
and honor it and understand the gun 
culture that you do. 
These are things I learned very 
young. 
I am going to fast-forward to Sandy 
Hook. Never in my mind, never in my 
imagination, 
never 
in 
the 
United 
States of America could I believe that 
20 babies would get slaughtered, that 
we had become so mentally disturbed 
that someone could feel that was some-
thing they needed to do or something 
drove them to it. I couldn’t com-
prehend that. But what was even hard-
er than that was, once I got to know all 
the families, knowing that most of the 
children were hard to identify or that 
they had to use DNA to identify them, 
that told me everything. 
So I was on the floor of the Senate 
one time in 2013, and people were talk-
ing about, we have got to do some-
thing. Every time there is a horrific 
tragedy, we are all willing to start 
talking about, we have got to do some-
thing. 
Mr. President, during that time I was 
here and we were talking, a person said 
we have got to ban this and ban that 
and take this off the streets and take 
this. I heard all those things. 
I confronted one of our Senators at 
that time about the types of guns. 
They never—they didn’t come from a 
gun culture. We were all raised a little 
differently. They never had the oppor-
tunity to learn as I did. 
I said: I think what you are doing is 
taking a position right now that by me 
being a law-abiding gun owner—and I 
own guns—that I am going to do some-
thing criminally with them or abuse 
them. I am not. You have got to give 
me that certain amount of concern 
that I am a law-abiding gun owner the 
same as you buy—whether you buy a 
car or whatever you buy that may do 
danger to yourself or others in public, 
you have that right as a law-abiding 
citizen, and that is a product that is 
being sold. I understand all that. 
They said: Well, JOE, if you know so 
much, why don’t you write a bill? 
I said: Well, the thing I see, where 
the loopholes are—I just told you. As a 
law-abiding gun owner, you can’t in-
fringe on me by saying I can’t give it 
to my child or my grandson or I can’t 
give it to my brother or my cousin— 
my family, immediate family. You 
have to give me that ability to make 
those decisions as a law-abiding gun 
owner with common gun sense. 
But I said: What you do is—you have 
a problem at a gun show. You can go to 
a gun show anywhere—they are all 
over the country—and there will be 
somebody in that gun show selling

guns who doesn’t do a background 
check because they are not a licensed 
dealer. That is the way the system is 
set up. 
I said: That is not right. That person 
is either not a law-abiding gun owner 
or doesn’t understand guns well enough 
of how we were trained. So that should 
be a loophole to be stopped. 
Then we talked about, well, how 
about on the internet now? We have all 
these transactions on the internet any-
more. So with the transactions that 
are happening on the internet, the way 
the law is set up today, if I buy from 
you in Maryland or you buy from me, 
then I have got to send my gun to a 
dealer, a licensed firearm dealer in 
Maryland, before, Mr. President, you 
can go pick it up, and they will do a 
background check on you. But if I sell 
my gun to somebody in my State of 
West Virginia—whether you are down 
in Bluefield, WV, or in Wheeling, WV— 
I can do that without going through 
any gun dealer, a licensed dealer, to do 
a background check. That should be 
stopped. 
So basically we did a bill, and I got 
Senator PAT
TOOMEY
from Pennsyl-
vania. That was the Manchin-Toomey 
bill we did back in 2013. It has probably 
been vetted longer than anyone else— 
any piece of legislation as far as on 
guns. 
I would dearly love to have a com-
monsense background check bill that 
did not infringe on law-abiding gun 
owners’ rights and protected the Sec-
ond Amendment. We weren’t able to 
get that in. But, you know what, I un-
derstand. I am OK. I would have loved 
to. But we got some other things in. 
So what I am trying to point out, 
those of you who didn’t think you got 
what you wanted, trust me, we need to 
start somewhere. This is a start. 
The only thing I had—advice to the 
committee—we worked on a bipartisan 
group—was this: Whatever we do, we 
have got to make sure that we are able 
to say what we are doing today would 
have prevented this horrible Uvalde 
tragedy. 
Again, we had young, young kids— 
babies, if you will, innocent—whose 
lives were taken away from them and 
their families. 
Something has to be done. It is not 
open season on children. So if we do 
anything, it has to be towards the safe-
ty of children and the school system. If 
you can’t, as a parent or a grandparent, 
see your child off to school, knowing 
full well they are going to return home 
safe or if you have that doubt in your 
mind or if that child has that doubt 
and they are scared to go to school, 
something is wrong with our system in 
America. 
We are asking just basically for good, 
decent people to step up. This is a piece 
of legislation that will do an awful lot 
of good, and it is something we can 
build off of, and I think that is our pur-
pose. 
Support State crisis intervention or-
ders. We are putting $750 million that 
will be available for States to create 
and administer laws that help keep 
weapons out of the hands of those de-
termined by a court, with strong due 
process—now, they have been talking 
about what kind of a flag it is, what 
kind of a law. Forget about that. 
What we are saying is, when we iden-
tify them—let me tell you something. 
The people who can do more good and 
help us more are the students who are 
going to school and have befriended 
their group of friends, and all of a sud-
den, this student goes dark. Something 
happens. They take you off of their so-
cial media page. They don’t want to 
interact with you anymore. They have 
another group of friends. Something is 
wrong. But if you had a mental hygiene 
professional in that school system that 
you could go to as a student and say, ‘‘I 
have a friend I am concerned about,’’ 
then it is in the proper hands. We 
haven’t had that. This gives us that 
chance. This gives us that chance to do 
it. 
Protection of victims of domestic vi-
olence. We know, far too many times— 
and to tell you how rampant this is and 
the culture that we have, there are do-
mestic violence shelters almost in 
every corner of the country. Wherever 
you live in America, you can find a do-
mestic violence shelter. We are that 
committed to protecting people going 
through abuse. 
This basically closes the boyfriend 
loophole, which is something that has 
been needed to be done for quite a 
while. I think that it is going to save 
lives. I really do. 
Enhanced background checks for peo-
ple under 21. Myself, I was very open. I 
think it should have gone to 21. Makes 
all the sense in the world. 
I use this rationale: If you are less 
than 21 years of age and over the age of 
18, you cannot go to a gun store legally 
and buy a handgun. It is the law. Not 
once have we ever had a strong posi-
tion to where people are saying: Oh, 
you have got to have 18-year-olds go 
buy handguns—trying to retract that. 
We haven’t. It doesn’t make sense. But 
for some reason, we never have on the 
long guns. And I am going to tell you 
why. Rite of passage: my first long 
gun, single shot .22—it is considered 
long. It is one single shot, bolt-action 
.22. My next gun was a .410 shotgun to 
go squirrel hunting. Then I jumped 
over 16-gauge to a 12-gauge because I 
wanted to be big time. I wanted to 
show them I can shoot a 12-gauge and 
take the kick. But that is the reason. 
So at 18, you know, you are out 
there—and they told me this: Well, 
wait a minute, 18-year-olds can go into 
the military, and they are going to be 
taught all these weapons. 
I said: Let me make sure you under-
stand. They are going to be properly 
trained, and they are not going to 
leave base with them. They are prop-
erly trained. And those weapons that 
you are talking about are used only for 
the military and defense of our country 
and does not leave base unless they are 
on duty. That is the difference in what 
you want to do. 
So we opened it up, and this new 
product comes onto the market. And 
this product comes onto the market 
with a vengeance. The only thing I 
have said—and I have been very public 
about it—I don’t own one, but I have 
friends and family members who do, 
and I trust they will do the right thing. 
They enjoy them, for whatever reason. 
So I haven’t gone down that path. 
But the bottom line is we have got to 
take a position that we are going to 
protect our children. And this is what 
it is about. It is a child protection bill, 
as far as I am concerned. And if you 
can’t protect the children in America, 
if you can’t protect the children in 
your neighborhood, in your school sys-
tem, that go to school, the same school 
as your children and grandchildren, 
then God help us all. And if that is not 
at the front of every discussion on a 
PTO meeting today going on around 
the country, in every school board 
going on around the country, then 
something is wrong. How hardened is 
your school? How well are our children 
protected? If I am a parent or grand-
parent, that is what I am asking. 
I have three young grandchildren in 
that age exactly in the school system, 
very close to where this happened. And 
you can imagine where my heart was 
when I heard about this horrible trag-
edy. So I can only imagine. My heart 
and prayers go out to these family 
members who will never bring back 
their children. I am still very close to 
the Sandy Hook parents and the move-
ment that made people more aware. It 
has taken a long time, but we are going 
in the right direction. 
I see my good friend Senator CORNYN, 
who has worked so hard on this. 
This is something that is long over-
due—long overdue. So what we are 
going to do, if you are 18 to 21, we want 
to make sure that we know what your 
juvenile record is. If there is a juvenile 
record, we are going to find it, and we 
are going to see if you are worthy or 
not to have this type of gun. And that 
is going to be a 3- to 10-day process for 
us to get the records back through the 
different systems to make sure that we 
have evaluated them properly and to 
review the juvenile and mental records, 
which are so important. I can assure 
you, a young person who maybe didn’t 
have the family support they needed or 
the nurturing that was needed and they 
have been in the juvenile system for vi-
olence or behavior problems, it is going 
to be someone that more than likely is 
going to have a problem as they grow 
older, unless they can get help. Maybe 
now we can identify and get that per-
son help so they don’t harm themselves 
or anyone else in society. That is the 
purpose of what we are doing. 
And then you have the investment in 
mental health funding: $11 billion we 
are investing in mental health. That is 
serious. For the first time, for us to put 
this type of money—of public money— 
towards something that is a public

tragedy that we are dealing with, I 
think the money is going in the right 
place. So when we said we want to be 
able to prevent—this bill should be able 
to prevent someone who shouldn’t have 
a gun in that age group, and it gives us 
a little extra eyes and time to look 
into it, we have done it. To say that we 
basically are going to be able to iden-
tify this person and maybe help that 
person save themselves and a whole lot 
of other innocent people, we have done 
it. 
We have started in the right direc-
tion. There is a lot more we can do. So 
for all of you that are out there saying, 
You didn’t do enough, it is just not 
good enough—don’t let the perfect be 
the enemy of the good. This is a good 
piece of legislation, and it has bipar-
tisan support. And I am so proud of my 
colleagues on both sides of the aisle. 
It is time to move forward. We will 
be voting very shortly on that some-
time today. It will be a historic vote, a 
very historic vote. And I am proud that 
the colleagues are standing tall on 
this. We have 50 Democrats and 15 Re-
publicans, and that is a major accom-
plishment in today’s atmosphere. 
So I am proud to be a Senator that is 
going to take part in a historic piece of 
legislation to maybe correct a lot of 
the fears that people have right now of 
sending their children or grandchildren 
to school, of maybe relieving the fears 
of children who are saying, I am afraid 
to go to school today. That is some-
thing I have never heard growing up. It 
is something I couldn’t imagine in the 
United States of America. I don’t want 
my children or grandchildren and their 
children having to live through this. It 
is time for us to stop it. 
This is a right start. It is a right 
piece of legislation. It is a good piece of 
legislation. And this is one time we 
have put our money where our mouth 
is and the mental health illness that 
goes on around in this country to make 
sure we are taking care of a problem 
that has been festering for a long time. 
With that, I want to thank my col-
league, Senator CORNYN, from Texas. I 
want to thank all of the group, if you 
will. We have 20-plus strong, equally di-
vided—Democrats and Republicans— 
working for the right cause and the 
purpose for us being here, making sure 
we do something good for America and 
protect our children. We have done 
that in this bill. 
With that, I say thank you to all of 
my friends, all of my colleagues, for a 
job well done. 
With that, I see my friend is here, 
and I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. COR-
TEZ MASTO). The Senator from Texas. 
Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, I 
came to the floor to talk about the Bi-
partisan Safer Communities Act. But 
first, let me just express my gratitude 
to the Senator from West Virginia for 
his longtime commitment to come up 
with a bipartisan solution. This is not 
easy. 
And there are a lot of examples of 
good-faith attempts to try to come up 
with an answer that can get the req-
uisite number of votes. And I know the 
Senator from West Virginia knows how 
hard that is. But it hasn’t deterred him 
from contributing to our efforts, and I 
think our product that we are voting 
on is better for that. I want to say 
thank you. 
Mr. MANCHIN. If I could say one 
thing, Senator CORNYN, if you give me 
a minute here. 
The leadership you have shown is ad-
mirable. It really is. You come from a 
gun culture. I come from a gun culture. 
We know the challenges in a gun cul-
ture. I said: To a group of people, it is 
not enough; to other people, it is too 
much. Anything is too much because it 
is the camel’s nose under the tent they 
are afraid of. We protected the Second 
Amendment. And we attacked the 
problem we have been identifying, 
which is mental illness. And you 
brought that to the forefront, took it. 
We put our money where our mouth is. 
I think this is a great piece of legisla-
tion for us to start protecting the chil-
dren of America. And I thank you 
again for that. 
Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, I 
thank my friend, our friend, from West 
Virginia for those generous remarks. 
As we all know, a lot of people have 
been working on this issue, for the last 
few weeks especially, intensely. And 
this included, obviously, a lot of people 
beyond those that I have the time to 
name here. But we finally introduced 
our proposed legislation last Tuesday, 
exactly 4 weeks after the last terrible 
shooting in Uvalde, TX. I am not a pa-
tient person by temperament or per-
sonality. So I was hoping we would get 
here faster. But the truth is, since it 
requires 
consensus 
and 
persuasion, 
sometimes it takes a little longer than 
you hoped for. And I appreciate the 
space that both the majority leader 
and the Republican leader have given 
us to come up with something that will 
achieve a result. 
So often around here, people do 
things and say things not with the in-
tention of actually passing legislation 
but with the intention of making a po-
litical statement, or messaging, as it is 
sometimes called. That is not what we 
are doing here. We are not looking to 
posture or to try to embarrass any-
body. We are trying to find a solution 
to a very real problem. And I think 
what we have come up with will, in the 
end, pass the test, which I know so 
many of us believe is the standard. And 
that standard is: Will it save lives? Will 
it save lives? And I believe the answer 
to that is yes. And that makes this 
worth doing. 
Well, from the beginning, I was opti-
mistic that we could reach a bipartisan 
agreement, but I know that on both 
sides of the aisle, there were some 
places that we could not go. As the 
Senator from West Virginia said—a 
proud defender of the Second Amend-
ment, as am I—I was not going to go 
anywhere in this negotiation that jeop-
ardized the rights of law-abiding Amer-
icans under the Second Amendment to 
the U.S. Constitution. 
Some people act as if the Second 
Amendment is somehow different than 
the rest of the Bill of Rights—the free-
dom of speech, the freedom of press, 
the freedom of association, the freedom 
of religion. Well, it is right there all in 
the same 10 first amendments to the 
U.S. Constitution, called the Bill of 
Rights. So it is entitled to no less re-
spect than those other constitutional 
rights contained in the Bill of Rights. 
But I think we have come up with a 
way to make good public policy and 
also to maintain that commitment to 
the Constitution. Some people want to 
create a false choice. I don’t think we 
need to go there because there is not a 
false choice, as I said, between the Con-
stitution and the Second Amendment 
and making good public policy. They 
don’t have to overlap or interfere with 
each other. Both can stand on their 
own merits. Well, as I said, law-abiding 
gun owners are not the problem. And 
that was a redline for me. 
During the course of our negotia-
tions, our Democratic colleagues did 
push for a range of provisions that I be-
lieve stood no chance of becoming law, 
particularly in a 50–50 Senate. We know 
that if Democrats want to do every-
thing their way or Republicans want to 
do everything our way, almost by defi-
nition in a 50–50 Senate, nothing will 
happen. 
And to me, that was one of the most 
important things we are doing here. 
One is demonstrating that our institu-
tions—in this case, the U.S. Senate— 
can actually work at a time when a lot 
of people are questioning whether our 
institutions can work and also ques-
tioning whether it is possible to come 
up with some bipartisan piece of legis-
lation rather than fail as we have so 
many times before and each side sort of 
returning to their corner of a boxing 
ring and trying to message it to their 
base and not actually get a result. 
So there were a lot of things that the 
President has asked for in this bill. For 
example, a ban on so-called assault 
weapons, which are a semiautomatic 
long gun, named, I guess, because of 
focus groups or polling assault weap-
ons, but it is really a semiautomatic 
rifle. And there was also some discus-
sion about high-capacity magazines. 
Neither of those are part of this legis-
lation. 
Now, I know there are Members who 
would perhaps love to have that, but 
they understand that to press that 
point to its logical extreme would 
mean we would not have anything at 
all. There is also no mandatory waiting 
period. There is no potentially uncon-
stitutional requirement that gun own-
ers store their weapons in a particular 
way. 
Unless a person is adjudicated men-
tally ill or is a violent criminal, no 
one’s Second Amendment rights will be 
impacted by this legislation, period. 
We know already that the National In-
stant Criminal Background Check Sys-
tem—which is the gold standard, in my

view, to make sure we draw the line in 
the right place between law-abiding 
gun owners and those who cannot, 
under existing law, purchase a firearm. 
For example, if you have been adju-
dicated in a mental institution, you 
can’t buy a firearm. If you have been 
convicted of a felony, if you have been 
dishonorably discharged from the mili-
tary, if you are addicted to drugs—all 
of those are current questions in the 
National Instant Criminal Background 
Check System, which if you answer yes 
to, then you cannot legally purchase or 
possess a firearm. 
Some wanted to include more cat-
egories, but we did not. We essentially 
are, by doing what we have done here, 
saying we are going to make sure that 
existing law is enforced but not add ad-
ditional requirements. 
Well, some of our colleagues like to 
say that to keep guns out of the hands 
of dangerous individuals, we need to 
limit the rights of law-abiding citizens. 
But as we know, the bad guys—the 
criminals—aren’t going to respect the 
law; they are going to get the guns by 
any means they can, including ille-
gally. 
Frequently, they obtain firearms on 
the street or through straw purchasers. 
Background checks don’t deter them 
because they don’t buy them from a 
Federal firearms licensee, which does a 
background check. They buy it from a 
member of a street gang or someone 
else. 
So we have rejected those attempts 
to add restrictions, as I say, on law- 
abiding gun owners, but we have added 
stiffer penalties for straw purchasers 
and gun traffickers. That, I believe, is 
the most effective way to deal with the 
problem of street sales of illegal guns 
through trafficking and straw pur-
chasing. That is a way to improve pub-
lic safety. 
Following the shooting in Uvalde 4 
weeks ago, I said I wanted to look at 
reforms that might have prevented this 
terrible tragedy from occurring. 
To me, that is the best way to ap-
proach these cases because it is hard, 
sort of in the abstract, to say what it 
is we could do that might save lives. 
Frequently, we can look at the fact 
pattern of what happened and say: Here 
is where there was a failure, and here is 
another place there was a failure. Un-
fortunately, in Uvalde, there were mul-
tiple points of failure. 
One is a lack of our access to juvenile 
records. This young man showed up 
after he had his 18th birthday. Right 
now, the criminal background check 
system doesn’t look back before you 
were 18 to see whether you had a men-
tal health adjudication or some dis-
qualifying criminal conviction. 
That is a problem because if some-
body who we know, in retrospect, is 
sort of a ticking timebomb as a result 
of his troubled past, there is no way 
under the current system to get access 
to that information. 
So one of the things we have done 
here is to say: Let’s see if we can work 
with the States to make sure that they 
supply to the National Instant Crimi-
nal Background Check System infor-
mation that had it occurred as an adult 
post-18 would clearly disqualify some-
one from purchasing a firearm. This is 
a little bit of a challenge because every 
State kind of does things differently, 
and there is no way we can compel the 
State to provide the information, but I 
would think that Governors and State 
legislatures would want to work with 
us to try to keep guns out of the hands 
of people who we know are a threat to 
themselves and a threat to public safe-
ty. 
Our bill incentivizes the States to 
upload whatever juvenile records they 
have to the National Instant Criminal 
Background Check System to ensure 
that any disqualifying criminal convic-
tions or mental health adjudications 
are available. 
This is, to be clear, not an expansion 
but a clarification of the types of con-
duct and records that would disqualify 
somebody if you were an adult that are 
not currently available because we 
don’t look past the 18th birthday—be-
hind the 18th birthday to juvenile 
records. 
So what we are doing is simply en-
suring that those records, which would 
already disqualify somebody had it oc-
curred if they were an adult, are avail-
able and could be considered as part of 
that background check. 
If the background check for a buyer 
under 21 returns a potentially disquali-
fying record, what we have provided in 
this enhanced background check is an 
opportunity for the FBI to ask more 
questions. 
And under our legislation, we don’t 
change this part of it. The NICS sys-
tem—the National Instant Criminal 
Background Check System—has 3 days 
to do a background check. But because 
it is computerized, 90 percent of them 
are done just in a matter of seconds, 
but on occasion the FBI has other in-
formation they need to investigate. 
This was a real problem, for example, 
in Charleston, where Dylann Roof, 
somebody we know had a misdemeanor 
drug conviction—and on further in-
quiry, the FBI would have found out he 
was addicted to narcotics, which is also 
a disqualification. But because there 
was no opportunity to expand the 
background check beyond just the 3 
days under current law, it wasn’t part 
of the NICS system. And, unfortu-
nately, he bought a gun and killed a lot 
of innocent people at Mother Emanuel 
Church there in Charleston. 
So giving the FBI, for this cohort of 
18- to 21-year-olds, an opportunity, if 
they come across something that needs 
further investigation, to give them up 
to an additional 7 business days to look 
into it. 
I will give you another example. 
Let’s say they come up with a record 
that demonstrates there was an as-
sault. Well, there are different types of 
assaults against someone. It may be a 
bar fight or punching someone in the 
nose or it could be domestic violence. 
Well, the first is not a disqualifier 
under the law, but if the assault con-
viction actually turns out to be domes-
tic violence, it would be. And so that is 
the kind of information that we are 
giving the FBI an opportunity to ex-
plore in this extension of the back-
ground check. 
But this is not a mandatory waiting 
period, and it doesn’t apply to gun buy-
ers of all ages. For example, if some-
body is 19 years old and they do the 
background check and they do what we 
require here, which is inquire of the ju-
venile record repository and the reposi-
tory for mental health adjudications 
and local law enforcement, and they 
find nothing, then the transaction can 
occur in a matter of hours or a matter 
of days. 
There is no mandatory waiting pe-
riod. And this really addresses only 
that cohort of 18-, 19-, and 20-year-olds, 
which has become a common profile for 
young shooters who have shot innocent 
people everywhere from Uvalde to 
Sandy Hook in Connecticut and other 
places. 
The profile, unfortunately, is very 
sad and very tragic, people who are a 
danger to themselves and others, and 
that is the reason why we thought this 
enhanced process was important. 
We also included comprehensive due 
process requirements relating to fire-
arms. I have talked about the fact that 
this is a constitutional right, and of 
course the Constitution guarantees due 
process of law. And a lot of folks are, 
frankly, concerned about these red flag 
laws, these crisis intervention orders 
when somebody is demonstrated to be a 
danger to themselves and others. 
And the concern is that not all of 
these red flag laws contain robust due 
process requirements. What are we 
talking about? Well, due process gen-
erally is understood to include notice, 
the opportunity to be heard, the oppor-
tunity to cross-examine witnesses, and 
to present evidence in front of an im-
partial judicial officer. 
So, in order to make sure that none 
of the grant funds would be available 
to States that did not have robust due 
process requirements and had red flag 
laws, as 19 States and the District of 
Columbia do, we have very strong due 
process conditions on the grants that 
are available. 
But many States don’t have red flag 
laws. For example, Texas does not, but 
we sure have a lot of crisis interven-
tion programs that are sort of focused 
on the same sort of problem. 
We have mental health courts, vet-
erans courts, drug courts. We have 
something called assisted outpatient 
treatment for people who, under court 
order, can be an outpatient and be re-
quired to show up for their counseling 
or treatment but also to take the medi-
cations that their healthcare provider 
requires them to take if they are going 
to manage their mental health chal-
lenges. That is done under a court 
order but as an outpatient. So it is an-
other way of sort of addressing this

problem of people having unmanaged 
mental health challenges and, in some 
cases, becoming a danger to themselves 
and others. 
We firmly rejected the idea that the 
Federal Government would impose a 
national red flag law. And we did not 
view it as appropriate for the Federal 
Government to make the grant funds 
that are available through the Depart-
ment of Justice be seen as an incentive 
to sort of nudge States or encourage 
States to pass their own extreme risk 
protection orders. 
Those are decisions that are made at 
the State level, not here. But like I 
said, we provided robust due process re-
quirements of any grants that go to 
those States. And it may be, as one of 
my colleagues said this morning, in his 
State, they have red flag laws, and he 
thinks that money could be used to en-
sure that the rights of law-abiding gun 
owners are protected by a robust due 
process. 
And for States that don’t have red 
flag laws, as I mentioned, there are 
other ways this money can go to help 
and address a similar problem. So all 
States will have access to these funds 
through the Department of Justice 
Byrne JAG law enforcement grant pro-
gram. 
So while some have said that tax-
payer dollars are being used to violate 
someone’s Second Amendment rights 
without due process, that is, clearly, a 
false accusation. Unfortunately, we 
know that when there is so much 
money to be made and so many people 
to be recruited to one cause or another 
when it deals with this general subject 
matter, that a lot of reckless and irre-
sponsible and false statements get 
made, which is the reason I am here ex-
plaining what is in the bill and what is 
not in the bill. 
One of the things that was very im-
portant to our Democratic colleagues 
is the definition of the ‘‘boyfriend loop-
hole.’’ Just by way of explanation, 
under current law, before we passed 
this bill, if you are married to some-
one, if you are cohabitating with some-
one, if you have a child with someone 
and are not married or cohabitating or 
if you are in a relationship which is, 
for all practical purposes, similar to a 
marriage but not official, if you com-
mit a domestic violence offense in your 
State and are convicted of that mis-
demeanor domestic violence, you are 
forever barred from purchasing or pos-
sessing a firearm. 
One of the things we negotiated, 
frankly, because I think it just makes 
a lot of sense, is that for this category 
of boyfriends, so-called, roughly de-
fined as recent or current serious rela-
tionship of a romantic or intimate na-
ture, if you find yourself in one of 
those relationships and you commit an 
act of domestic violence, one of the 
things we negotiated is 5 years later, 
with a clean record, then you can have 
your Second Amendment rights re-
stored. 
And I think that is an important pro-
tection, again, of Second Amendment 
rights. Well, we would not agree that 
someone who was convicted of mis-
demeanor domestic violence against a 
girlfriend 30 years ago would be forever 
barred from their Second Amendment 
rights or someone who just had a cas-
ual dating relationship. 
But as I said, we did include a provi-
sion to restore the Second Amendment 
rights to certain individuals who have 
a clean record of not committing any 
additional criminal acts, including do-
mestic violence, for a period of 5 years. 
We all know that there are plenty of 
people who make mistakes but then 
turn their lives around, and this legis-
lation opens up the anatomy for indi-
viduals to have their Second Amend-
ment rights restored if they do that. 
We have worked throughout this 
process with a lot of different people, 
from the school safety portion to the 
mental health portion, and we have 
worked with law enforcement, and we 
have worked with a variety of groups, 
including some of the groups that rep-
resent gun owners as well as those who 
have advocated reform of our gun laws. 
I thought it was important for us to 
hear from everybody. 
And now it may be that in the end, 
some of these outside groups do not 
love 100 percent of what we are doing 
here. We know that no piece of legisla-
tion is perfect. By definition, it is a 
compromise and a consensus to try to 
find that common ground. And so some 
outside groups may say: Well, we can’t 
support that because it doesn’t give us 
100 percent of what we want, but frank-
ly there is never a bill that passes that 
gives one side or the other 100 percent 
of what they want. 
So just to conclude, just to repeat 
myself for emphasis, this bill does not 
infringe on law-abiding citizens rights 
under 
the 
Second 
Amendment. 
It 
doesn’t actually expand the back-
ground checks system. It doesn’t im-
pose mandatory waiting periods or any 
other restrictions. 
There is a lot of misinformation and, 
believe me, I think that is what social 
media was created for, for spreading 
misinformation or disinformation. 
So there is a lot of misunderstanding 
about what is in this legislation, which 
is the reason I wanted to come to the 
floor and set the record straight. 
This bill does, however, include im-
portant targeted reforms, complete 
with robust due process protections, 
that I believe in the end will keep our 
children and our communities safe 
while respecting Second Amendment 
rights. 
Over the last couple of days, we have 
had a chance to have even further and 
more robust discussions among not 
only Republicans, but Democrats, and I 
appreciate those who perhaps may have 
been skeptical to what we were trying 
to do here—their willingness to keep 
an open mind, to ask us hard questions, 
and to force us to come up with good 
answers that will address their con-
cerns. That is how we pass legislation 
here in the Senate; and my hope is that 
through those good-faith negotiations 
and debates and discussions, we can 
continue to build additional support 
for this legislation. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to 
call the roll. 
Mr. REED. Madam President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
Mr. REED. Madam President, we are 
on the brink of passing meaningful gun 
safety legislation, and it is regrettable 
that it took the deaths of 31 people, in-
cluding 19 children, in the recent Buf-
falo and Uvalde mass shootings to pro-
vide the needed momentum to break 
the hold that the National Rifle Asso-
ciation and the gun lobby has had over 
Congress. 
I commend my colleagues on both 
sides who have stepped forward to 
reach a compromise. This bill is a big 
accomplishment that can save lives, 
but I feel an inescapable dread that we 
will face the horror of another mass 
shooting if we do not take further 
steps. 
As a veteran, I have shot many of the 
weapons we have heard debated on the 
floor this week. I know their power, 
and I know they were designed for kill-
ing people. 
Now, I know that some of my col-
leagues hold the view that more fire-
arms in the hands of more people is the 
antidote to gun violence, but I have to 
ask: Will more and more guns and more 
and more people carrying guns in pub-
lic make our schools, our churches, or 
our streets safer? Is that really a vision 
for this country? I don’t think so. 
According to an academic study by 
the Council on Foreign Relations, the 
United States, with less than 5 percent 
of the world’s population, has 46 per-
cent of the world’s civilian-owned guns, 
and it has the highest homicide-by- 
firearm rate of the world’s most devel-
oped countries. 
Indeed, Americans kill each other 
with guns at a rate 25 times higher 
than other high-income countries. In 
addition, Americans use firearms to 
harm themselves in alarming numbers. 
According to the CDC, in 2020, there 
were more than 45,000 firearm-related 
deaths in the United States, and rough-
ly half of those deaths were suicides. 
That is the academic data. But what 
grips me and so many other Rhode Is-
landers are the mass killings of Ameri-
cans, particularly children, over the 
last 
quarter 
century: 
Columbine, 
Sandy 
Hook, 
Parkland, 
and 
now 
Uvalde. 
Hospitals, 
concert 
venues, 
houses of worship, and military instal-
lations have also been targeted. People 
have been targeted based on race, sex-
ual orientation, and religious beliefs. 
Innocent lives have been taken again 
and again, and many more lives have 
been shattered. The common element

is a firearm; and while correlation isn’t 
necessarily 
causation, 
these 
mass 
killings have become more and more 
common as more and more guns have 
been marketed and sold. 
Roughly two-thirds of Americans do 
not own a gun, and the majority of 
Americans agree on a commonsense so-
lution 
like 
expanding 
background 
checks. But groups like the NRA have 
lined up to block these efforts even in 
the face of devastating loss. 
The Bipartisan Safer Communities 
Act 
before 
us 
today 
represents 
progress. It represents a momentary 
break in the NRA’s stranglehold on re-
form. This bill will establish a 10-day 
waiting period for firearms purchases 
for individuals under 21 years of age. It 
will close the ‘‘boyfriend’’ loophole 
that allows abusers to access guns. It 
will strengthen requirements for gun 
sellers to obtain a Federal firearms li-
cense. It will establish clear penalties 
for straw purchases and gun traf-
ficking, and it will invest in violence 
intervention 
programs 
and 
mental 
health solutions in communities across 
the country. Those are real changes 
that are worthy of support on their 
own. 
I am also encouraged that the bill in-
cludes incentives for States to adopt 
extreme risk protection orders, or a red 
flag system, similar to the legislation I 
have introduced. State red flag laws 
have proven effective in keeping guns 
away from individuals who have dem-
onstrated clear warning signs of danger 
to themselves and others, and we 
should be encouraging every State to 
adopt a red flag system. 
I would also like to talk about the 
mental health aspects of the bill. First, 
it needs to be repeated that a person 
with a mental health condition is more 
likely to be a victim of violent crime, 
not the perpetrator. The most reliable 
predictor of future violence is actually 
a history of violent behavior, not a di-
agnosis of mental illness. 
That being said, we do have a mental 
health crisis in this country that de-
mands attention. In Rhode Island, fam-
ilies and providers have been asking for 
more resources for treatment and more 
training for mental health workers, 
particularly 
resources 
dedicated 
to 
children with mental health needs. I 
am pleased that the negotiations over 
the gun control package so far include 
new resources for mental health care, 
including a national expansion of the 
certified community behavioral health 
clinic model, which would provide sus-
tainable funding to expand mental 
health and substance abuse treatment 
and services at the community level. I 
have worked with my colleagues Sen-
ator STABENOW and Senator BLUNT for 
over a decade to move this provision 
forward. 
I am also pleased that this agreement 
invests new funding in a National Sui-
cide Prevention Lifeline. Next month, 
the Lifeline will be making the switch 
to an easy to remember three-digit 
number: 988. We need to make sure 
that call centers have the staff and ca-
pacity to handle call volume and make 
sure people who reach out for help get 
appropriate follow-up care. As I men-
tioned earlier, half of all gun deaths 
each year are suicides, and firearms are 
the most lethal method of suicide. In 
addition to keeping guns out of the 
hands of people in crisis, we need to 
make sure we have well-funded and or-
ganized systems in place for people who 
reach out for help in these times of cri-
sis, like the Lifeline. Again, I would 
hope every American, and particularly 
those who face these mental health 
challenges, remember 988. It could be a 
lifesaver. 
I hope we are able to consider bipar-
tisan efforts to strengthen our mental 
health care system over the coming 
weeks and months. For example, we 
should pass the National Suicide Pre-
vention 
Lifeline 
Improvement 
Act, 
which 
I 
introduced 
with 
Senator 
MORAN
last year. The HELP Com-
mittee reported the bill out of the com-
mittee unanimously nearly a year ago, 
but this bipartisan bill still has not yet 
come before the Senate. 
The bill also includes critical re-
sources for schools, not only to imple-
ment measures to address physical 
safety, but also to ensure that schools 
have the resources to address the so-
cial, emotional, and mental health 
needs of students and staff. Our edu-
cators have not just been on the 
frontlines of the pandemic. Too often— 
much too often—they are on the 
frontlines of the gun violence epidemic. 
And they are also on the frontlines of 
our mental health crisis. Finally, be-
cause of this legislation, some help is 
on the way. 
The gun violence bill we are debating 
will hopefully prevent some tragedies 
going forward. Though we cannot help 
but celebrate any progress on gun vio-
lence, we should not lose sight of the 
fact that we need more comprehensive 
action than this bill if we are really 
committed to preventing gun violence 
in our Nation. 
There is no single law or regulation 
that we can pass that would have 
stopped every single one of these trage-
dies we have seen over the past few 
decades. But in my view, Congress 
should do more, including reinstating 
the assault weapons ban, cracking 
down on illicit ghost guns, and, most 
importantly, 
eliminating 
the 
near 
total immunity of the gun industry, 
which has an unparalleled level of li-
ability protection. 
The gunman in Buffalo bought a 
semiautomatic weapon, but he was able 
to ‘‘illegally’’ transform it into a fully 
automatic weapon. If you go to your 
cell phone and get YouTube, put in 
something like ‘‘transform AR–15 to 
fully automatic,’’ you will have a host 
of videos. One of them lasts 1 minute 
and 38 seconds. Why is this happening? 
Well, when you have no liability for 
the consequences of building a weapon 
that can be easily transformed from 
semi to fully automatic and you can 
wink-wink to your potential market 
and say, ‘‘Yes, this is semiautomatic,’’ 
we need legislation to get that immu-
nity removed. 
Now, I am proud that in the days fol-
lowing the tragedy, my home State of 
Rhode Island took the decisive action 
of banning magazines that hold more 
than 10 rounds, raising the minimum 
age for buying shotguns and rifles from 
18 to 21, and prohibiting loaded rifles 
and shotguns from being carried in 
public. Congress should do the same by 
passing the bill before us and then 
pressing on with additional reforms. 
I will vote for this bipartisan bill. It 
is a significant step, but it cannot be 
the last step. 
50TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE PELL GRANT 
PROGRAM 
Madam President, I rise to com-
memorate the 50th anniversary of the 
enactment of the Pell grant, which was 
named in honor of its author and my 
predecessor, Senator Claiborne Pell—I 
might add, a mentor, a friend, and a re-
markable example to me. 
Senator Pell believed in the power of 
education to transform individuals, 
communities, 
and 
our 
Nation. 
He 
worked to put the power of education 
in the hands of the people. 
When Senator Pell introduced the 
legislation to create what would be-
come the Pell grant, he said: 
There is no greater investment this coun-
try can make than in the education of its 
youth. Our young people, who are simulta-
neously our responsibility, our legacy, and 
our key to problem-solving in the future, 
must be enabled to pass easily into the realm 
of postsecondary education, and our institu-
tions of higher education must be equipped 
to accommodate and train them. 
His words were prophetic and pro-
found. The Pell grant became the cor-
nerstone for broadening access to post-
secondary education. Because of the 
Pell grant, over 80 million students and 
counting have been able to attend col-
lege. In 1972, before the Pell grant, less 
than half of high school graduates im-
mediately enrolled in college. Today, 
two-thirds make that transition. Since 
the establishment of the Pell grant, 
the percentage of people ages 25 to 30 
with a bachelor’s degree has doubled. 
Today, the Pell grant supports nearly 
7 million students across the Nation, 
including nearly 24,000 in Rhode Island. 
It remains one of the most effective 
Federal programs in assisting low-in-
come families, with most recipients 
coming from families with annual in-
comes of $40,000 or less. It is one of our 
greatest tools to promote equity and 
opportunity in the United States. Yet, 
despite this success, today we find our-
selves at a crossroads when it comes to 
fulfilling the promise of the Pell grant. 
We have seen declining enrollment 
over the past 5 years. Even more 
alarming is that the institutions that 
enroll the lion’s share of low-income 
and first generation college students— 
our community colleges and public 4- 
year colleges—have seen some of the 
most significant declines.

June 23, 2022 
We have seen an explosion of student 
loan debt, now standing at more than 
$1.7 trillion—debt that threatens to 
foreclose on educational opportunity 
for this generation of Americans. We 
need to correct course. 
We have made a start with the bipar-
tisan, $400 increase to the maximum 
Pell grant in the fiscal year 2022 appro-
priations act, but we need to do much 
more. The Pell grant used to cover over 
three-quarters of the cost of a public 4- 
year college. Today, it covers less than 
a third. 
When I was growing up and later with 
the passage of the Pell grant, it was 
relatively—I wouldn’t say easy—but 
less challenging to go ahead and work 
your way through college with a sum-
mer job and a Pell grant, graduating 
with very little debt and moving on in 
the community and this society and 
this economy. Today, it is much, much 
more difficult. So it is time to double 
the grant. 
We also need States and institutions 
to step up. Affordability is a shared re-
sponsibility. Fifty years ago, Senator 
Pell led the effort to ensure costs did 
not keep talented and committed stu-
dents from pursuing a college edu-
cation. In his farewell speech in the 
Senate, he called on us to continue his 
commitment 
to 
educational 
oppor-
tunity. He said: 
In education, I want us to be known as the 
nation 
that 
continually 
expanded 
edu-
cational opportunities, [the nation] that 
brought every child into the education main-
stream, and [the nation] that brought the 
dream of a college education within the 
reach of every student who has the drive, 
talent, and desire. We should always remem-
ber that public support for education is the 
best possible investment we can make in our 
Nation’s future. It should be accorded the 
highest priority. 
So, as we commemorate the 50th an-
niversary of the Pell grant, it is time 
to renew our commitment to college 
access and affordability. Let’s work to-
gether to double the Pell grant, rein in 
college costs, and reduce the burden of 
student loan debt. Let’s do our part to 
realize Senator Pell’s vision for a coun-
try that continually expands oppor-
tunity. 
One final point: Getting to know Sen-
ator Pell, it always impressed me that, 
I think, one of the formative periods in 
his life was the beginning of World War 
II. Senator Pell came from an old fam-
ily. Pelham, NY, was named after his 
family. I was once with him when he 
informed me that his family once 
owned Fort Ticonderoga, but then they 
donated it to the State of New York. 
He could have very easily, in 1941, 
gotten a promotion, gotten a rank, and 
served comfortably in some office. He 
chose not to. 
He enlisted in the Coast Guard as a 
cook and sailed across the Atlantic in 
multiple convoys in dangerous waters. 
I think there, he learned the potential 
of the American people—those other 
cooks who would never be able to go to 
college because they didn’t have the 
money, but they had talent and, in 
some cases, more talent perhaps than 
the Senator himself. I think that 
image, that impression, drove him in 
many respects to make the Pell grant 
a reality. 
Now, of course, it is quite a tribute 
to a gentleman who could have avoided 
the difficulties and dangers of war and 
chose, just like other Americans, to go 
into the fight. And we have to have 
that same spirit as we address the Pell 
grant. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to 
call the roll. 
Mr. SULLIVAN. Madam President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
TRIBUTE TO JEFF STREIT 
Mr. SULLIVAN. Madam President, it 
is Thursday, and normally, when I am 
giving this speech, our ‘‘Alaskan of the 
Week’’ speech—you notice we have a 
new, 
pro-energy 
‘‘Alaskan 
of 
the 
Week’’ diagram here—normally, when I 
give this speech, everybody has gone 
home. The pages love it because it is 
the most interesting speech of the 
week. Some of our reporters who like 
this speech, they are kind of viewing 
this as the end of the week. 
Unfortunately, we are not at the end 
of the week. There is a lot more busi-
ness to do for the next day or two or 
three—who knows?—important busi-
ness, no doubt about it. But I still want 
to come down to the floor and talk 
about a really impressive man who has 
done incredible stuff for our State. His 
name is Jeff Streit. 
Jeff has been a builder of the Trans- 
Alaska Pipeline—what we call TAPS— 
and then has helped run it for 48 years, 
almost half a century. We are going to 
talk about Jeff here in a minute. He 
has done an incredible job. 
I always like to talk a little bit 
about what is going on in Alaska. All 
the people who watch this speech—we 
know there are millions who tune in 
every Thursday—come on up to Alas-
ka. Come visit. 
What is happening right now is real-
ly, really exciting. It is just a few days 
past summer solstice. Boy, did we cele-
brate 
in 
Alaska: 
parties, 
baseball 
games. The famous Midnight Sun Base-
ball Game took place in Fairbanks. I 
talked about that last week. It took 
place in Fairbanks on Tuesday. The 
Goldpanners, whom I talked about, the 
famous Alaskan baseball team, pulled 
out a 10-to-9 victory in the bottom of 
the 10th. The crowd of thousands went 
wild—Midnight Sun baseball. 
So if you are visiting Fairbanks, as 
many tourists do right now, you might 
want to check out a baseball game. We 
have great baseball in Alaska, as I de-
scribed last week. 
You also might want to travel a cou-
ple of miles outside of Fairbanks to get 
a firsthand view of one of the engineer-
ing marvels of the world, the Trans- 
Alaska Pipeline, what we call TAPS. 
That is it right there, a big, beautiful, 
incredible engineering feat: 800 miles of 
steel pipeline crossing 3 mountain 
ranges—one about 5,000 feet high— 
crossing more than 600 streams and riv-
ers, and has transported over 17 billion 
barrels of oil to a thirsty America. 
That is energy security right there. 
TAPS has provided countless benefits 
in terms of tens of thousands of jobs— 
good union jobs, I might add—not just 
to Alaskans but to Americans all over 
the country. I think even one of our 
Senate colleagues worked on this. It 
was the largest privately funded infra-
structure project ever undertaken in 
America at the time it was built in the 
early seventies. 
Here is the thing: It took 3 years to 
build—3 years; that is it—this mam-
moth, huge, important energy project. 
By the way, we need to get back to 
that in this country. I and many other 
Senators are working on that. You 
can’t do an EIS in 6 years. We have to 
get back to this can-do American spir-
it, building things that benefit our 
great Nation in a timely manner. I am 
going to talk a little bit about that. 
Our Alaskan of the Week, Jeff Streit, 
was one who did this. He helped con-
struct this incredible engineering feat, 
and then he stayed on, and he worked 
for a company in Alaska, a very fa-
mous company called Alyeska, which is 
a consortium of companies that own 
and run and built the pipeline. 
This week, Alyeska celebrated its 45- 
year anniversary—45 years of supplying 
a thirsty America with billions and bil-
lions and billions of barrels of oil. Ev-
erybody should applaud that. 
I know we have some, unfortunately, 
who think that if you work in the en-
ergy sector, somehow you are a bad 
guy. Actually, you are a hero. 
America needs energy. Alaska has a 
lot of it. Alyeska has produced it and 
sent it 800 miles down this incredible 
pipeline to the whole country. So I 
want to first congratulate Alyeska for 
their incredible work. 
Jeff, our Alaskan of the Week, is the 
longest serving employee there. He has 
been working for Alyeska all of those 
45 years and, as I mentioned, started 
work on TAPS even longer, 48 years in 
total, because he is one of the Ameri-
cans—by the way, there were over 
30,000 who came up to build this incred-
ible work of energy infrastructure. 
Forty-eight years, Jeff Streit, Alyeska, 
building TAPS—what an amazing ca-
reer. He is our Alaskan of the Week. 
So let me tell you a little bit about 
Jeff. Jeff’s father came to Alaska after 
World War II, where he flew for the 
Army Air Corps. 
That is another theme you may have 
seen on our Alaskan of the Week: a lot 
of vets, a lot of veteran families. Alas-
ka has more veterans than any State 
per capita in the country. 
Jeff’s father worked on projects 
across the State, married Jeff’s mother 
in 1952 when they were both working on

the 
Alaska-Canada 
Highway—the 
ALCAN Highway, as we call it in Alas-
ka. 
By the way, you want to talk about 
building something efficiently in terms 
of infrastructure that we need in Amer-
ica? The ALCAN Highway—1,600 miles 
through Canada, all the way to the 
lower 48—built in 8 months. We can do 
that, America. We can build great 
things—ALCAN Highway, TAPS—effi-
ciently. We have just got to get back to 
it. More on that later. 
Jeff’s parents then moved back to Il-
linois, where Jeff was born, but he 
might have been raised in Alaska be-
cause his parents talked about the 
great State of Alaska so much—their 
adventures there, what they did there. 
So he wanted to go back. 
He went to pre-vet school at Iowa 
State for 2 years, and the first chance 
he got, in 1973, he moved to Alaska to 
work on a farm and go to college at the 
University of Alaska Fairbanks. 
Now, Madam President, I am sure a 
lot of our Senate colleagues know this, 
but 
for 
the 
interns—the 
pages, 
I 
mean—you might remember in the 
early seventies, studying history, that 
we had this big energy crisis where en-
ergy prices were going up—a little bit 
familiar, unfortunately, today—going 
way up, primarily because there was an 
Arab oil embargo led by the Gulf Arab 
States, 
Saudi 
Arabia, 
against 
the 
United States and other countries. It 
was devastating. You couldn’t get gas. 
There were lines at gas stations that 
stretched for blocks. States issued ra-
tioning based on odd and even license 
plates. Prices surged, a little bit like 
today. Motorists turned on each other. 
It was bedlam. By the way, it really 
hurt the economy, like today, in terms 
of inflation. 
Enter the great State of Alaska and 
our vast, vast energy reserves for 
America. Congress said: We need to get 
Alaska moving. We need to get that 
Alaskan energy to the rest of the coun-
try. 
So this body and the House debated 
the Trans-Alaska Pipeline Authoriza-
tion Act—what we call, as I mentioned, 
TAPS—to build this for the country, 
and we did it. 
It was drama, Madam President. You 
are sitting right there in the President 
of the Senate’s seat. The TAPS act in 
the U.S. Senate was deadlocked. It was 
a tie vote here in the Senate, and the 
Vice President of the United States 
had to come and break the tie so Amer-
ica could build this for a country that 
needed energy—American energy, by 
the way, not energy from the Middle 
East. 
Another incredible story as it relates 
to legislation and TAPS was the late, 
great Congressman DON YOUNG, a fresh-
man at the time. We just lost our dear 
Congressman a couple of months ago. 
He was a brandnew freshman in 1973. 
He got an amendment—and, boy, do we 
need amendments like this today—that 
said: On this big infrastructure project, 
we are going to stop any litigation. We 
are going to stop more studies. We are 
just going to build it. 
We can do that here, by the way, the 
Congress. We can say: No more litiga-
tion; let’s build. And that is what we 
did. That is what America did. 
As the debate was happening here in 
the Congress, Jeff moved back up to 
Alaska, visited a local union hall, got 
on with the Teamsters, and his life’s 
work in Alaska began. 
As I said, Madam President, this was 
the 
largest 
private 
construction 
project in our country’s history. At its 
height, we had over 30,000 Americans— 
great Americans, by the way—building 
this incredible piece of American en-
ergy infrastructure that transformed 
our State in Alaska, and it trans-
formed America. At one point, this 
pipeline was producing 2.2 million bar-
rels a day for our Nation. Over 17 bil-
lion barrels of oil have flown down that 
pipeline for America. 
By the way, Madam President, Alas-
ka has billions and billions of barrels of 
oil left, if our Federal Government 
would just help us produce it. 
Eventually, Jeff got a job, after 
building TAPS, with Alyeska running 
TAPS, working at Pump Station 8. In 
the 48 years since, he has worked near-
ly every inch of that line as a techni-
cian at three pump stations, as a task 
force supervisor, as a project super-
visor, as a pump station operations su-
pervisor, and as a pipeline technician 
trainer. You get where I am going here, 
Madam President: He has done it all 
for Alyeska. 
He has great stories and great memo-
ries. He remembers the mess halls 
filled with smoke and laughter and the 
hard work it took to build this pipe-
line. He remembers watching ‘‘Jaws’’ 
at a packed theater camp in the middle 
of the Alaska wilderness. He remem-
bers the time a Russian delegation 
came to visit TAPS. The TAPS pump 
station was so clean. 
By the way, Alaska has the highest 
environmental standards of energy pro-
duction anywhere in the world. 
He said: The Russians came, saw how 
we produced, saw pump stations, and 
thought that we were lying about how 
we produce and transport oil because it 
was so clean. They thought it was 
staged. 
Jeff said: We were setting standards 
on the environment—cleanliness, envi-
ronmental 
standards—that 
people 
across the world didn’t think were pos-
sible. ‘‘It made us proud.’’ 
Well, guess what, we are still doing 
that in Alaska. Jeff still marvels at the 
engineers who designed one of the most 
complicated engineering projects ever 
built—before computers; using paper, 
pencils, slide rules. ‘‘Every square inch 
of the system has to be intact to move 
even one drop of oil,’’ Jeff said. ‘‘If 
there is a leak anywhere, we shut the 
whole thing down.’’ 
It is a testament to so many that 
this incredible system has kept oil 
flowing for America for 45 years. That 
is what Jeff just said about TAPS and 
Alyeska. 
To keep it running, there are always 
upgrades, adjustments, installing en-
hanced monitoring, detection, surveil-
lance, but, as Jeff said, ‘‘The pipeline 
itself is still the same pipeline that was 
built in the ‘70s, still doing battle with 
the 
geological 
and 
meteorological 
forces,’’ and still standing strong for 
our country. 
Jeff has no plans to retire soon. He is 
still highly engaged. He is still highly 
curious. He is now taking on a greater 
mentorship role, including developing 
and teaching a hydraulics class, emu-
lating those who taught him. 
Jeff said: ‘‘When I think about the 
last 48 years, I think about the thou-
sands of people who have made a dif-
ference, who helped me and taught me. 
And I really think that that’s what 
America is all about—passing on values 
and work ethic[s]’’ to each other. 
That is what America is all about. 
That is the best of our country: people 
who work hard, who are loyal to their 
jobs, to their communities, to their 
State, to their country, and impor-
tantly, who produce important things 
like American energy, which we need 
to this day. Jeff is exactly one of those 
kind of people. He built this, ran it, 
still runs it, and our Nation still needs 
it. 
So, Jeff, thank you for all that you 
have done. 
Thanks to the workers at Alyeska 
who are currently working right now, 
24/7, to keep hundreds of thousands of 
barrels of oil a day, which we need, 
coming down the Trans-Alaska Pipe-
line. 
A big congratulations to Alyeska for 
45 years and 17 billion barrels of oil for 
America. 
That company, Alyeska, has pro-
duced many great leaders—Jeff being 
one and Tom Barrett, my good friend, 
being another. And I just want to say 
to him—to everybody at Alyeska but 
particularly to Jeff—congratulations 
on being our Alaskan of the Week. You 
people who are producing American en-
ergy are American heroes. We need 
more of you, and we really appreciate 
all you have done for our great State 
and our great Nation. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Missouri. 
Mr. BLUNT. Madam President, be-
fore I get to my topic today, I would 
like to say that when Senator SUL-
LIVAN first came to the Senate, I hadn’t 
been here very long, either, and this 
was my presiding time every week. I 
loved the Alaskan of the Week. I don’t 
think they are ever going to run out of 
Alaskans of the Week as long as Sen-
ator SULLIVAN is here. So I was right 
back in that chair, where you are, 
thinking of the many times I heard 
Senator SULLIVAN do the presentation 
on the Alaskan of the Week and how 
much I enjoyed it. 
S. 2938 
Madam President, I would say the 
topic today is tragic in so many ways 
but, I think, moving forward in others.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S3121 
June 23, 2022 
Last month, 19 kids were killed in their 
own school rooms and 2 teachers were 
killed in Uvalde, TX. It was a horrific 
act, an agonizing thing for family, an 
agonizing thing for community, and I 
think, along with the Buffalo, NY, 
event, an agonizing thing for our coun-
try. 
One thing that almost all these mass 
shootings have in common is a perpe-
trator who had a mental health issue 
that wasn’t dealt with properly. 
Let me say before Senator STABENOW 
and I talk any more about mental 
health—and I believe I will repeat this 
again—be sure we know what we are 
talking about here. People with mental 
health conditions are not dangerous. 
Mental health is a health issue, and we 
ought to treat it as a health issue, but 
in rare and tragic occasions, people 
with a mental health issue not dealt 
with can become dangerous, and that is 
what we have seen in this and other 
similar circumstances. 
So one of the responses is always, 
Well, we need to have a better mental 
health delivery system. That is true, 
but we should realize that, according 
to the National Institutes of Health, 
for at least a decade now, they have es-
timated that at least one in five Amer-
icans has a diagnosable and almost al-
ways treatable mental health or behav-
ioral health issue. Frankly, the pan-
demic made that even greater. 
A June 2020 survey by the Centers for 
Disease Control and Prevention found 
that 41 percent of adults in the United 
States said they had had at least one 
symptom of a mental health condition 
in a recent time, and 11 percent said 
they had seriously considered suicide 
in the previous month. Now, those are 
extraordinary numbers, but even if half 
of those numbers were correct, you see 
the size of the problem we have and the 
importance of dealing with that prob-
lem. 
Of course, we had even more alarm-
ing numbers with children and young 
adults during that. The lockdowns, 
months of virtual learning, time away 
from their friends, I would argue too 
much time on screens—the effect of the 
pandemic on close family members had 
a staggering toll on the country. 
Children’s 
hospitals 
saw 
mental 
health emergencies among 5- to 17- 
year-olds increase by 14 percent in the 
first half of 2021 compared to 2019 and a 
45-percent increase in self-injury and 
suicide for children in that age group. 
Pediatric hospital needs and pediatric 
mental health care needs are greater 
than they have ever been. 
We need to be sure that everyone who 
has a mental health crisis or has an on-
going mental health problem has the 
help they need when they need it. The 
bipartisan legislation we are debating 
today expands access to high-quality 
mental health and behavioral health 
through what Senator STABENOW and I 
will point out we believe to be a truly 
proven 
model 
of 
community-based 
care: the Excellence in Mental Health 
Program, a program that we brought to 
the floor in 2013 and then got passed 
and signed into law in 2014. 
At the time, Senator STABENOW men-
tioned that bill marked the most sig-
nificant expansion of community men-
tal health and addiction services in 
decades. 
When we pass this bill, it will be even 
more dramatic in its long-term impact. 
And we have worked on these issues to-
gether with pilot States. We worked on 
these issues together that brought 
projects 
in 
individual 
States 
that 
weren’t part of that eight-State origi-
nal and, eventually, nine-State pilot. 
And so today we are able to come 
with 5 years of history in this program, 
a reimbursement model that matters, 
and results that we think make a big 
difference. And I am glad to be here 
with my good friend from Michigan. 
And we are going to kind of do this to-
gether for the next few minutes, talk 
about what can happen because of a 
critical piece of this community safety 
bill that is in so many ways a mental 
health and mental health delivery bill 
that we are going to see expanded in 
the country in unique ways. 
Senator STABENOW, I would like to 
turn to her for a few minutes to talk 
about this, and then I have got some 
things to say, too. 
Ms. STABENOW. All right. Thank 
you, Senator BLUNT. 
Mr. President, I have to say this has 
been a wonderful partnership and a 
wonderful journey now for, gosh, al-
most 10 years, I think, since we origi-
nally started talking about the idea 
that we should be funding healthcare 
above the neck the same as healthcare 
below 
the 
neck 
as 
part 
of 
the 
healthcare system. And that is your 
‘‘stop and start’’ grants, when we have 
community health centers that are so 
wonderful for physical health. And so 
we have done that. 
I do want to, before going into the 
substance, give a shout-out, though— 
because we are not the only ones who 
have been working for almost 10 
years—to our wonderful staff: Alex 
Graf, on my staff, who has been work-
ing on this legislation for 8 of those 
years, and Caitlin Wilson, on your 
staff, who was amazing, and I under-
stand recently stolen by Senator COR-
NYN. And so she has continued her 
work. But so many people have worked 
with us that we are very grateful to, 
including the main authors and the 
folks who have put this bill together, 
like Senator CORNYN, who has been 
such a strong supporter of what has be-
come an evidence-based quality initia-
tive. We don’t have to make something 
up. When folks say, ‘‘What do you want 
to do about mental health care or ad-
diction care,’’ we actually have a prov-
en model now. And also to KYRSTEN 
SINEMA and to CHRIS MURPHY and Sen-
ator TILLIS—so many people have been 
supportive of this as well. 
And I just want to take us back for 
just a moment because when we came 
to the floor, Senator BLUNT, when he 
mentioned 2013, we actually came to 
the floor to mark the 50th anniversary 
of President Kennedy signing the Com-
munity Mental Health Act. As we 
know, that was the last bill he ever 
signed before his being shot. And part 
of that was to stop housing people in 
hospitals, just locking people in the 
hospitals, and create more quality care 
in the community—you know, shut the 
hospitals and open up services in the 
community. 
As you have said so many times, half 
of that happened. The hospitals were 
closed, but we didn’t provide the qual-
ity and the funding—permanent fund-
ing—for the community care. That was 
1963. We are doing it now in this bill. 
That is what we are doing in this bill is 
completing what was promised in a na-
tional bill signed in 1963. 
We know, again, that one out of five 
people in our country—and this is be-
fore COVID—will have a mental illness 
in their lifetime. So many leading 
causes 
of 
death—again, 
prior 
to 
COVID—for people under age 50 is a 
drug overdose, most likely opioid over-
dose. We know that the most likely 
gun death is a suicide, which, by the 
way, in this bill, there is an important 
piece on red flags that I think is so im-
portant because that means that if a 
family member, if those around some-
one feel that they are a danger to 
themselves 
and 
someone 
else 
and 
should not have access to a gun, they 
can go through a legal process to have 
that happen so that that person is not 
using a gun to commit suicide or a sui-
cide-homicide through a mass shoot-
ing. 
But what is so significant about this 
is that we know that across this coun-
try, certainly across Michigan, I know 
in Missouri, we have so many people— 
I mean, there are millions of people 
today who want to be able to get help 
for mental health or addiction as part 
of the healthcare system. And we want 
them to do that. We don’t want there 
to be a stigma. 
There used to be a stigma. People 
would whisper, ‘‘He’s got cancer,’’ and 
now, we openly talk about that. We 
have wonderful programs and people 
get treatment, and there is no stigma 
related to that. It is very challenging, 
but there is no stigma. We want that 
for 
mental 
illness, 
for 
behavioral 
health. 
So this isn’t about saying every per-
son with a mental illness is dangerous 
at all—at all. This is about saying we 
want everyone to get the help they 
need. And in that situation, that rare 
situation where somebody doesn’t get 
help and then takes those next steps 
and is unstable and dangerous, we cer-
tainly 
want 
to 
address 
protecting 
them, their family, the school, the 
neighborhood, the community. And 
that is what the gun safety provisions 
of this are all about. 
Let me just say one other thing and 
turn it back to Senator BLUNT. We now 
have—between the number of dem-
onstration States we have had now for 
a number of years, we also have 435

June 23, 2022 
clinics, many of them funded through 
what we developed as startup grants so 
that they can get started, develop the 
quality standards, be able to show 
what a difference it made. 
But I think we were both pretty 
blown away when we saw the difference 
it made, when we saw those original 
numbers from Health and Human Serv-
ices, the studies that were done—both 
in Democratic and Republican adminis-
trations, reinforcing that. The fact 
that right now, if you have a 24-hour 
psychiatric 
crisis 
services 
center, 
which is part of this, these clinics, peo-
ple aren’t going to jail—60 percent 
fewer people are going to jail because 
they are getting the help they need, 
which is why law enforcement so 
strongly supports this. 
What has been happening is people go 
to the emergency room instead because 
there is no place—our jails, our emer-
gency rooms have become de facto 
mental health treatment centers be-
cause there was no place else; 41-per-
cent reduction in homelessness with 
comprehensive care in the community. 
And that is what is in this bill. 
And 
it 
really 
is 
transformative; 
wouldn’t you say, Senator BLUNT? 
Mr. BLUNT. Yes. I think the point 
you are making here, too, are that 
these are—we now have 5 years of evi-
dence in several States, multiple years 
in other States. So this isn’t just as-
suming what will happen but looking 
at what we have carefully tried to keep 
track of, of what does happen. And as 
you pointed out, that de facto mental 
health system, mental health delivery 
system of the emergency rooms and po-
lice—nobody was well-served by that. 
Certainly, the police weren’t well- 
served. The emergency rooms weren’t 
well-served. And people had many men-
tal health challenges that weren’t 
served by that as well. And seeing 
those numbers go down dramatically of 
people having to go to the emergency 
room for mental health services or 
being kept in jail overnight or longer 
than overnight for mental health serv-
ices, nobody benefits from that system. 
And so we are seeing real numbers 
where the people who work at the 
emergency room, the people who are in 
the police department are among the 
biggest supporters of this system when 
it gets in place. Also, the whole idea of 
crisis intervention, there are opportu-
nities in this law for that to happen. 
In any of the new structures, whether 
that is drug court or veterans court or 
other places you would go to try to be 
sure somebody is getting the help they 
need when they need it, there also 
would be due process involved in any-
thing added; that we use this bill to 
add to the system due process where 
people have a right. 
If there is an emergency moment, ob-
viously, you have to deal with that as 
an emergency moment. But people 
then have a right to have their day in 
court as well, if they are not part of 
that crisis intervention moment of see-
ing that happen. And so that is impor-
tant. 
But in Missouri, 150,000 people are 
now part of this excellence in mental 
health effort. That is about a 40-per-
cent increase on what some of the same 
facilities were doing before, but now, 
they do it with more certainty that 
they are going to get their cost reim-
bursed. They do it with the right kind 
of staff, and 365 days a year, 24 hours a 
day, 7 days a week, they have to be 
available. And the new States that 
enter the program will go through that 
same type of competition to be among 
the 10 States every 2 years that could 
enter the program and get us to all 50 
States in that program and have the 
kind of staff they need, the kind of ac-
cessibility they need. 
I think, originally in our bill, which 
was 8 years ago now—2014—24 States 
applied to be one of the first 8 States in 
the pilot program; 19 of them went 
through the whole process, and 8 States 
were selected. But in the other States, 
there are now 30 States that have big 
units that were able to qualify as indi-
vidual demonstration grant units to 
show what they could do. And we real-
ly, I think, both believe that those 
units in those States will become both 
the models and the incentive to bring 
the whole State into that program now 
that that is possible and seeing what 
we are seeing with results and also re-
sults on the nonmental health side. 
One of the unique things I think that 
this pilot did was—part of the pilot was 
to see what happens with the other 
healthcare issues that people have who 
have mental health concerns. And what 
has happened is that they have seen 
those costs go dramatically down. If 
you have a behavioral health problem 
that is being dealt with, you are much 
more likely to show up to your doctor’s 
appointment. You are much more like-
ly to show up to dialysis. You are much 
more likely to take the medicine that 
has been prescribed, whether it was for 
your mental health situation—and oc-
casionally, that is the best way to deal 
with mental health—or your other 
health situations. And so those costs 
go down. 
And 
even 
in 
the 
immediate 
healthcare space, we are seeing that 
States believe they are saving money 
in the immediate space of healthcare. 
There has never been any question that 
in the long run you would save money 
if you treat mental health like you 
treat all other health. There has never 
been any question, whether it is the 
prison system or law enforcement or 
your personal income capacity, that all 
those were good things to do. 
I think what we have shown in these 
early States is that even in the imme-
diate healthcare space, you save as 
much money or virtually as much 
money or even more money on the 
other health costs for the one in five 
adult Americans—and now big numbers 
among the younger Americans who 
have a mental health problem—you 
save as much space for their other 
health problems, and one in five adult 
Americans are going to have a lot of 
other health problems. It is a pretty 
big segment of our society. 
And I think, Senator STABENOW, see-
ing what happened there has also been 
persuasive to States as they are begin-
ning to think about making this part 
of their permanent program when these 
pilot projects are over. 
Ms. STABENOW. Absolutely. Senator 
BLUNT, as we know, in the end, this is 
all about people. And I think what has 
been most exciting for me, and I know 
for my friend and partner, is that peo-
ple’s lives are changing. Opportunities 
for them are changing. 
When we look at this legislation 
broadly, it is about saving lives, wheth-
er it is through issues related to gun 
safety, whether it is through getting 
the help you need, mental health help 
and addiction services help, whether it 
is making sure our schools are safer, 
making sure laundry services are avail-
able in the schools. It is all be creating 
safety and a better quality of life. 
I think it is also exciting—you know, 
we were talking about community be-
havioral health clinics with broader in-
vestments here on mental health as 
well. There is a strengthening of the 
suicide hotline, which is so connected 
to what we have been talking about 
today. Telehealth, we know during the 
pandemic 
how 
critically 
important 
that was for mental health services and 
so on. And that is strengthened. 
There is about a billion dollars’ 
worth of investments in some way in 
our schools—school health clinics and 
other opportunities. 
What I think is exciting is that we 
are not only supporting schools and 
teachers in all of these areas that are 
so important, but we are making sure 
that when they find a child that needs 
help, there is somewhere to go because 
when you are talking about really in-
vesting in transformative, certified 
community behavioral health clinics, 
that means there is a service in the 
community. 
So if a parent or if a teacher or the 
principal or the coach or somebody is 
saying, ‘‘This young person needs some 
help,’’ they won’t only be trained to 
identify they need help, they will actu-
ally be able to get them help because 
there will be services available. And so 
I think that is the whole point of all of 
this. 
And I would also finally say, when we 
talk about funding as healthcare, tra-
ditionally mental health and addiction 
services have been funded by grants to 
stop and start. And so you may need 
help or want your child to get help, but 
the grant that was doing that went 
away; or you may suddenly decide you 
want to deal with your own addiction, 
you are finally ready—it is so hard— 
you are finally ready to do that, and 
you reach out and the services aren’t 
there anymore. 
And so this is about funding this as 
healthcare through the healthcare sys-
tem, so it doesn’t stop and start. It be-
comes a way of looking at healthcare 
above the neck the same as healthcare

below the neck. And that is why we 
call it transformative. 
And it is such an important commit-
ment. I am so proud of everyone here 
that has been so wonderfully sup-
portive and enthusiastic about taking 
this big step. This is an area of this bill 
that is a huge step that will really save 
lives and transform communities, I 
think. 
Mr. BLUNT. Just one final thought, 
we want to be sure that we are encour-
aging people to get the healthcare they 
need. You know, if this system works 
like it should work, you really never 
know what you are doing in terms of 
how you have changed people’s lives in 
the future or the lives of people they 
might impact. 
We don’t want to create any stigma 
here that a resilient, broad-based men-
tal health system that is part of this 
bill means that you should be hesitant 
to seek mental health help. You know, 
if you have a mental health problem, 
you are more likely to be the victim of 
a crime than you are the perpetrator of 
a crime. 
But if those problems get out of con-
trol—often suicidal thoughts first be-
fore you have homicidal thoughts—but 
if this system works the way it should, 
who knows what good you have done by 
just letting people go through their 
normal lives as contributing citizens 
with treating their mental health and 
talking about their mental health. 
As Senator STABENOW
said, being 
able to talk about somebody in your 
family that has a mental health chal-
lenge as readily as you talk about 
somebody in your family that has a 
cancer challenge or a dialysis trip that 
they have to make multiple times a 
week to go somewhere or medicine that 
they take for something else and talk-
ing about this in the context of the 
good it does in making our society 
safer should, in no way, be interpreted 
to mean that people with a mental 
health concern are unsafe. 
But if you don’t deal with that prob-
lem in the right way at the right time, 
it has the potential to be unsafe. Most 
of these shootings we have seen, the 
shooter goes into that shooting clearly 
anticipating that they will not come 
out of that shooting alive either. So it 
is suicide; it is homicide; it is things 
that if you dealt with that problem a 
decade earlier—and maybe in some 
cases, the specific problem even a week 
earlier—but if you dealt with it a dec-
ade earlier, as people began to see that, 
you know, We need to get you some 
help. 
Just like if your hearing is going bad 
or your eyesight is going bad, people 
say, ‘‘Let’s get an appointment and go 
see what we need to do,’’ and anybody 
can be seen at these certified commu-
nity behavioral health centers. Any-
body can be seen if you are covered 
by—it is very much based on the feder-
ally qualified health center model. If 
you have insurance that covers this, 
you can go there. If you have a govern-
ment program that covers it, you can 
go there. If you need to pay cash, you 
can go there on a very affordable slid-
ing scale. But people are seen, and no-
body—in our State, at least, and I 
think this would be the case in all nine 
of the pilot States—nobody who needs 
to be seen that day is not seen that 
day. Nobody who needs to be seen that 
day is not seen that day. 
And nobody who needs to be seen 
isn’t seen pretty quickly as you have 
time to schedule that appointment. It 
changes people’s lives; it changes com-
munities; it changes the way we talk 
about mental health. 
As Senator STABENOW said on the 
floor, the last 50 years after President 
Kennedy signed his last bill into law— 
now, here we are, almost 60 years after 
that bill was signed into law taking 
what would be, so far, the biggest step 
toward accomplishing what that Com-
munity Mental Health Act envisioned. 
And Senator STABENOW, I will turn to 
her for any final comments. 
Ms. STABENOW. I just want to say 
thank you to my friend and partner, 
and I really do mean friend and part-
ner. And Senator BLUNT thinks he is 
retiring; I am not going to let him. We 
have really done so much important 
work together, and I am going to miss 
him dearly. 
I am really seriously figuring out a 
strategy where we are not going to let 
you leave the building. 
But I am very grateful and, again, for 
him, for all of the great staff work, and 
it is a day to feel good about the abil-
ity to come together and get some-
thing done. 
I yield the floor. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
WARNOCK). The Senator from Mary-
land. 
Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, first of 
all, while Senator BLUNT and Senator 
STABENOW are still on the floor, I want 
to thank both of them for their ex-
traordinary leadership on this mental 
health issue. 
I am so pleased that the Bipartisan 
Safer Communities Act includes robust 
provisions to deal with community 
mental health. 
I have worked with Senator STABE-
NOW on the Senate Finance Committee. 
I know her passion on this issue. We 
have put together bipartisan working 
groups that are dealing with a lot of 
different issues in regards to mental 
health. A lot of that has to do with pe-
diatric mental health, which is very 
much engaged in the bill that we have 
before us today. And a lot of those pro-
visions have been incorporated into the 
legislation before us. 
But what you have done on these cer-
tified behavioral health centers to be 
able to have the pilot programs and 
now to be able to expand them to more 
communities, to have a 24/7 facility 
that is available that is included in 
this legislation, that is going to make 
a real difference in people’s lives. 
So I just really want to thank both of 
you for your tremendous contributions 
on this issue. Senator STABENOW, I 
want you to know, through the Chair, 
I agree with you in regards to Senator 
BLUNT. We are going to miss his per-
sonal presence here on the U.S. Senate 
floor, but we know that we will be able 
to continue on having his friendship 
and counsel on so many issues that 
have affected us. 
And if my friend from Kentucky 
would allow me just a few more min-
utes, I would like to make a couple 
comments about the underlying bill. I 
know that he is scheduled to speak. 
Mr. PAUL. No. Go ahead. 
Mr. 
CARDIN. 
After 
the 
horrific 
shooting in Uvalde where innocent 
children were murdered, inaction was 
not an option. Congress had to do 
something substantive to help stem the 
epidemic of gun violence that is scar-
ring our communities daily. For this 
reason, for all the victims of gun vio-
lence who may not make the headlines 
every day, I was proud to vote today in 
favor of the Bipartisan Safer Commu-
nities Act. 
The Senate is taking an important 
step forward today to break the dec-
ades-long gridlock on gun safety. Leg-
islation will save lives by boosting 
funding for community violence inter-
vention and prevention initiatives like 
those underway in Baltimore. 
It strengthens protection for victims 
of domestic violence by adding con-
victed domestic violence abusers to 
background checks. 
It creates a new source of funding for 
States to implement red flag laws 
which help to keep weapons out of the 
hands of dangerous individuals who 
should not have access to a firearm. 
It cracks down on criminals who 
tried to evade licensing requirements 
and makes clear which gun sellers need 
to 
register, 
conduct 
background 
checks, and keep appropriate records. 
It strengthens the background check 
process for those under 21 seeking to 
buy firearms, by ensuring that officials 
have access to juvenile and mental 
health records. 
The bipartisan legislation also pro-
vides much needed mental health re-
sources to communities by providing 
funding to improve and expand access 
to mental health services. It includes 
policies from the MENTAL Health for 
Kids and Underserved Act and the Sen-
ate 
Finance 
Committee 
Bipartisan 
Mental Health Working Group tele-
health discussion draft led by Senator 
THUNE and me to improve telehealth 
services for students with Medicaid and 
CHIP. 
Increasing 
resources 
for 
mental 
health services are critical, but it is 
important that we not conflate mental 
illness and gun violence. And I heard 
Senator BLUNT talk about that. Not 
every instance of gun violence is con-
nected to mental illness, and not every 
mental health crisis prompts the use of 
a weapon. 
To that end, the COVID–19 pandemic 
has made abundantly clear that our 
children need additional mental health 
resources offered in schools. We must

also significantly increase the pipeline 
of individuals willing to serve in those 
school-based mental health service po-
sitions. 
This legislation addresses that chal-
lenge head on and provides supple-
mental funding to both train new 
school-based mental health service pro-
viders and provide students with the 
specific mental health services they re-
quire. 
While not able to meet the needs of 
every school currently without coun-
selors or mental health professionals, 
this bill will make significant strides 
to ensure that a significantly greater 
percentage of students have access to 
mental health services. 
The legislation we pass in the Senate 
soon will save lives and help keep our 
communities safer, but there are many 
more reasonable steps we can and 
should take, consistent with the Sec-
ond Amendment rights of law-abiding 
citizens. 
I will continue to strongly support 
the establishment of universal back-
ground checks for all gun purchases, 
the banning of assault weapons and 
high-capacity magazine clips from pri-
vate ownership, and raising the min-
imum age to 21 to buy assault weapons, 
in the absence of a ban. 
The Senate should also act quickly 
to confirm the nomination of Steven 
Dettelbach to be the director of Bureau 
of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Ex-
plosives. The ATF has not had a per-
manent 
Senate-confirmed 
director 
since 2015, and the Agency is sorely 
overdue for permanent leadership who 
can carry out its critical mission to 
stem the illegal use and trafficking of 
firearms, among other important prior-
ities. 
To that end, let me point out I am a 
cosponsor of the Background Check Ex-
pansion 
Act, 
which 
would 
require 
checks for all gun sales, including 
those by unlicensed sellers; the Assault 
Weapons Ban Act, which would gen-
erally 
ban 
the 
sale, 
manufacture, 
transfer, and importation of assault 
weapons; the Background Check Com-
pletion Act, which would eliminate the 
Charleston loophole that allows for a 
sale to go forward if a check is not 
completed within 3 days; the Keep 
Americans Safe Act, which prohibits 
the importation, sale, manufacture, 
transfer, or possession of magazines 
that hold more than 10 rounds of am-
munition. 
The Bipartisan Safer Communities 
Act, which we can and will pass, will 
save lives, but there is still more work 
that we should do to keep our students 
and our communities safe. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Kentucky. 
Mr. 
PAUL. 
Mr. 
President, 
Jon 
Miltimore, who writes for the Founda-
tion for Economics and Education 
writes: 
Red flag laws don’t involve precogs seeing 
into the future. Yet, like precrime, they are 
designed to prevent a crime before it hap-
pens, even if it means violating civil rights 
in the process. 
Miltimore asks several important 
questions: Can people who are flagged 
as threats be involuntarily committed? 
Are they appointed legal counsel? Will 
a Federal database be established to 
track flagged citizens? 
These are questions that civil lib-
ertarians should be asking, especially 
since many people who are red-flagged 
will have committed no crime. 
There will simply be, like Philip 
Dick’s ‘‘Anderton,’’ people who might 
commit or might be a danger to some-
one. Miltimore reminds us that the 
idea of precrime didn’t originate with 
‘‘The Minority Report.’’ In ‘‘1984,’’ Or-
well writes that Big Brother’s ‘‘endless 
purges, 
arrests, 
tortures, 
imprisonments, and vaporizations’’ are 
not the result of people breaking laws, 
for there are no laws in Oceania. These 
punishments, readers learn, are merely 
the wiping out of persons who perhaps 
might commit a crime at some time in 
the future. 
Red flag laws are well-intentioned. 
Everyone is searching for a way to pre-
vent the senseless massacres of school 
mass shootings. 
I think accessing the violent crimi-
nal records of juveniles is a reasonable 
way to try to prevent these killings. 
Though, really, most States have al-
ready laws on the books that crim-
inalize threats of violence. The prob-
lem isn’t a lack of laws to stop these 
killers, it is a lack of persistent appli-
cation of existing laws. 
The shooters at Parkland and Buffalo 
both committed criminal threats in ad-
vance of their killing sprees, and yet 
law enforcement did not vigilantly 
prosecute them. Instead of seeking to 
enforce existing laws, States have, one 
after another, instituted red flag laws 
to use gun confiscation orders to try to 
predict crime in advance. 
The problem comes in trying to cre-
ate such laws and still protect the con-
stitutional right to bear arms for the 
innocent. 
Basic aspects of the Constitution 
should not be abandoned, such as the 
right to confront your accuser. Some 
red flag laws allow anonymous accus-
ers to initiate a gun confiscation order. 
That is not just, and that is not con-
stitutional. 
We should not abandon the right to 
legal counsel, the right to confront the 
evidence. Many State red flag laws 
allow gun confiscation orders without 
the defendant even knowing they have 
been accused of anything. Many State 
red flag laws allow guns to be con-
fiscated without hearing evidence from 
both sides. 
Jacob Sullum, in Reason, writes of 
Colorado’s red flag law that the stand-
ard of proof for the initial gun confis-
cation order when the accused does not 
have an opportunity to respond—see, 
for the initial order, the accused is not 
present or doesn’t need to be present, 
and the evidence comes from one side. 
But the standard that is used is called 
the preponderance of the evidence, 
meaning the standard used is that the 
accused is more likely than not to pose 
a significant risk. 
Historically, gun rights were only re-
moved when the defendant was con-
victed of a crime using a constitutional 
standard 
of 
‘‘beyond 
a 
reasonable 
doubt.’’ 
As Philip Mulivor writes at PJ 
Media: 
Because ‘‘reasonable doubt’’ has been long 
established as the standard of proof for 
criminal cases, it must naturally apply to ju-
dicial proceedings in which an individual, 
who has not even been charged with a crime, 
can be stripped of a constitutional right. 
Nevertheless, red-flag laws often rely on ‘‘a 
preponderance of the evidence,’’ a radically 
diminished standard of proof. This, above all 
other injuries— 
According to Philip Mulivor— 
to due process, offends our system of liberty 
and [a] fair trial. 
Colorado’s red flag law, as well as 
many other States’, confiscates guns 
using a less-than-constitutional stand-
ard. 
Using 
a 
preponderance-of-evidence 
standard, which is a standard lower 
than the Constitution uses for criminal 
cases, allows a gun confiscation order 
when a judge decides that it is a better 
than 50–50 chance of a person being a 
‘‘significant risk.’’ 
Think about that. It is a little better 
than 50–50 that the person who has 
come before me, whom I have heard 
evidence only from the person who 
doesn’t like that person—it is 50–50, 
maybe it is 51–49, but I am going to 
take 
away 
a 
constitutional 
right, 
whereas in a court proceeding where 
you are convicted of a crime, where 
you lose your gun rights because of a 
felony, the standard is beyond a rea-
sonable doubt. 
In practice, the other problem with 
the red flag laws is that judges will be 
inclined to err on the side of caution. 
When the only evidence comes from 
someone who believes the respondent 
poses a threat, judges will rarely, if 
ever, decline to issue a temporary gun 
confiscation order. 
One might ask if our laws should 
allow the abridgement of a constitu-
tional right when only one side of the 
evidence is presented. Imagine if the 
proceeding is a complaint filed by an 
unhappy spouse in the midst of a di-
vorce. Most cases of divorce involve 
one side cheating or at least one side 
lying. It is exceedingly difficult to as-
certain the truth in a divorce pro-
ceeding even when both sides are 
heard. One can just imagine what mis-
chief might occur if divorce pro-
ceedings only allowed testimony from 
one side. 
If you think red flag laws will be easy 
to adjudicate, just imagine the case in-
volving 
Johnny 
Depp 
and 
Amber 
Heard. 
As Sullum points out, there is—from 
the judge’s point of view, ‘‘The possible 
downside of rejecting a petition’’—a se-
rious downside—‘‘the death of a re-
spondent or someone else—will weigh

heavily on the judge’s mind, while the 
temporary deprivation of the subject’s 
constitutional rights will seem trivial 
by comparison.’’ 
The presumption will be, if the tem-
porary order, where you only heard evi-
dence from one side, was granted, that 
the judge is taking a real risk by over-
turning or not granting the permanent 
order when evidence is actually heard 
on both sides. 
So you begin with a temporary 
order—it is ex parte; you don’t have 
legal counsel; evidence is only heard 
from one side—but then you get to the 
next stage and you say: Well, the per-
son gets justice later. They are going 
to get a lawyer. There will be a pro-
ceeding. There will be due process at a 
later date. 
Yet the cards are stacked because 
think of the perspective of the judge, 
think of the predicament of the judge. 
He now has before him an emergency 
order that says this person is a dan-
gerous person. For him or her to rule 
otherwise, they are taking a big risk 
because the first judge or the first rul-
ing said this person is dangerous. Now 
the judge has to say and has to some-
how attest and prove and live with 
themselves that he is now attesting 
this person is not a danger. 
But the first hearing was only one 
side of the evidence. The first hearing 
may have been an aggrieved party in a 
divorce. It may have been an unhappy 
person who doesn’t like you at work. It 
may have been someone who doesn’t 
like your political views and is reading 
online and says, that so-and-so had a 
picture of a gun, or that so-and-so 
made some sort of violent innuendo. 
Read Twitter. Find out how much of 
that is going on. There is a danger to 
this. 
It is not that anyone is downplaying 
the sad, awful nature of these mas-
sacres and that we don’t want to stop 
them, but we should do it in a fashion 
consistent with the Constitution. 
With the red flag law, the initial 
hearing has evidence only from those 
who accuse you of something. That 
cannot be justice. The bedrock aspect 
of justice in our country is that you 
get legal counsel, that there is a debate 
back and forth. 
Go to family court—and you think 
some of this won’t originate from fam-
ily court? You think there is not going 
to be an angry spouse who says: My 
husband cheated on me. My husband is 
a hunter. I am going to accuse him of 
something so I can get his guns taken 
away from him. 
You have to hear both sides. How 
could you only hear from the angry 
spouse? In divorce, we don’t hear from 
one side. How could we have a hearing 
where you take away an amendment— 
or take away a constitutional right 
from the Bill of Rights without hearing 
evidence on both sides? 
You say: Well, we will hear it at the 
second hearing 14 days later. 
The problem with the second hearing 
is you now have a judge who feels the 
incumbent pressure of not changing an 
initial ruling, a feeling of, well, we 
have already decided this person is a 
threat, and now I have to take the re-
sponsibility of guaranteeing they are 
not a threat. 
See, if you had the jurisprudence, if 
you had the due process in the first 
hearing, then you wouldn’t have to 
worry so much about it being fair in 
the second hearing. If you have time to 
go before a judge, I see no reason why 
you don’t have time to have your at-
torney present. They have time enough 
to have a hearing. They have time 
enough to hear the person accusing 
you. Shouldn’t they have time enough 
to have someone defending you? 
In Colorado, a temporary gun confis-
cation order lasts for about 14 days, at 
which point the judge has to schedule a 
hearing where the accused finally has a 
chance to challenge the claims. 
At this second proceeding, the legal 
standard is a little greater—at least in 
Colorado. It goes from preponderance 
or 50–50—slightly better than 50–50—it 
goes from a standard of that to a 
standard that is ‘‘clear and convincing 
evidence.’’ 
Under 
Colorado’s 
red 
flag 
law, 
though, the first gun confiscation order 
needs to show imminent risk, but when 
you get to the second order, interest-
ingly—the order that is going to last a 
year—you don’t have to prove that the 
person is an imminent risk; all you 
have to say is that they might be a risk 
at some point in time. So we have lost 
sort of the imminence to it. 
In 14 days, the imminence is gone, 
and now we have a proceeding where 
we are going to hear evidence on both 
sides, and you can have counsel—not 
always guaranteed counsel, but you at 
least can have a lawyer present. In 
order to remove a gun confiscation 
order, though, and recover one’s Sec-
ond Amendment rights, the burden, 
though, is now placed on the accused. 
So there is something that is very, 
very common and is throughout all of 
our jurisprudence: that you are inno-
cent until proven guilty; the burden is 
on the government. But now, once you 
have gone through one of these gun-re-
straining orders, in order to get your 
rights back, you have to prove that you 
are not a risk. The burden is now on 
the accused to prove that either you 
are sane or that you are not a risk. It 
is proving a negative. If you never were 
a risk, how do you prove that you are 
no longer a risk? How do you prove you 
are the negative of something? How do 
you prove that you are not a risk? This 
turns typical jurisprudence on its head. 
Instead of innocent until proven guilty, 
the burden is for the accused to prove 
his or her innocence. This is the oppo-
site of what our jurisprudence system 
was founded upon. 
Sullum writes: 
If the judge issues a [gun confiscation 
order], it lasts for 364 days unless the subject 
seeks early termination and shows by clear 
and convincing evidence that he [or she] does 
not pose a significant risk. 
Rhode Island’s red flag law is similar, 
remaining in effect for about a year be-
fore the accused can challenge it. 
For the accused to restore his Second 
Amendment rights, once again, the 
burden is on the accused to prove they 
are innocent. 
The ACLU of Rhode Island asks an 
important question: How does one 
prove this negative, and how does one 
do it with such a high burden of proof? 
The ACLU concludes that in ending a 
gun confiscation order, ‘‘the burden 
should be on the GOVERNMENT to 
prove by clear and convincing evidence 
that it should remain in effect, not on 
the accused to halt the continued im-
position.’’ 
This is the ACLU of Rhode Island 
saying the burden should be on the 
government the same way the burden 
is traditionally in any other court pro-
ceeding in our country. You don’t have 
to prove you are innocent; the govern-
ment must prove you are guilty. 
If the government is going to take 
away your Second Amendment right, 
shouldn’t the government have to 
prove that you are either a threat or 
that you are guilty of something? 
Eagle County Sheriff James Van 
Beek notes that when the subject of a 
gun confiscation order tries to have it 
terminated, ‘‘the burden of proof is not 
on the [government], as it is in every 
other legal case, but instead, is placed 
on the [accused] to prove that the ac-
cusations are wrong.’’ 
Sheriff 
Van 
Beek 
explains 
that 
‘‘proving one’s sanity could be very dif-
ficult, as it is highly subjective.’’ But 
proof of one’s sanity is not enough to 
remove a valid gun confiscation order 
since the accused can be a threat even 
if determined to be sane. 
Van Beek also worries that ‘‘if a per-
son is truly in a mental crisis, this ag-
gressive approach will create even 
greater stress, possibly resulting in a 
violent overreaction, as their personal 
property has been taken without a 
crime ever having been committed.’’ 
In Maryland, this is precisely what 
happened. When police attempted to 
serve a gun confiscation order, a fight 
ensued. The person was startled by it. 
He had never heard there was a prob-
lem. They showed up at his house, and 
he ended up dying in the ensuing alter-
cation. 
When police seize guns from the sub-
ject of a gun confiscation order, Sheriff 
Van Beek notes, ‘‘[t]here is no warning 
or ability to defend themselves against 
the charges.’’ 
In addition, if troubled individuals 
understand that seeking care exposes 
them to the risk of a gun confiscation 
order, some may be inclined to avoid 
psychiatric help. 
With the large universe of people who 
can initiate a gun confiscation com-
plaint, from ex-girlfriends, to former 
roommates, to grandparents, to in- 
laws, to second cousins, Sullum con-
cludes that ‘‘the opportunities for mal-
ice or honest error are multiplied.’’ 
In some ways, the process really is 
biased throughout because of the risk

aversion on the part of the judge. Once 
a gun confiscation order is issued and 
the accused has been labeled a threat, 
many judges will simply not want the 
responsibility of judging otherwise be-
cause of the deadly consequences if 
they are wrong. 
Sullum concludes: 
Given that bias, the indeterminacy of ‘‘sig-
nificant risk,’’ and the difficulty of pre-
dicting [an accused’s] behavior, it seems in-
evitable that the vast majority of people who 
lose their constitutional rights under this 
sort of law will [in actuality] pose no real 
threat to themselves or others. 
Philip Mulivor, writing at PJ Media 
on the constitutional deficiencies of 
gun confiscation orders, points out an-
other deficiency. He says: 
The Void-for-Vagueness Doctrine, a corner-
stone of American jurisprudence, requires 
laws to be written ‘‘in a manner that does 
not encourage arbitrary and discriminatory 
enforcement.’’ 
He goes on to say: 
By forcing a judge to predict a person’s fu-
ture criminal behavior in the absence of any 
violation of law, red-flag statutes descend to 
the most disreputable level of ‘‘arbitrary and 
discriminatory’’ legislation. 
Mulivor concludes that ‘‘due process 
is always denied when a law fails to 
comport with the Vagueness Doctrine’s 
imperative for clear and consistent 
standards.’’ 
Fortunately, the Vagueness Doctrine— 
This is also Mulivor’s point— 
is most likely to prevail when an ambig-
uous law threatens a constitutional right, 
such as free speech or the right to keep and 
bear arms. 
The ACLU of Rhode Island has writ-
ten perhaps one of the best reasoned 
critiques of red flag laws. 
The ACLU of Rhode Island writes: 
We are deeply concerned about [the red 
flag law’s] breadth, its impact on civil lib-
erties, and the precedent it sets for the use 
of coercive measures against individuals not 
because they are alleged to have committed 
any crime, but because somebody believes 
they might someday commit one. 
The ACLU of Rhode Island writes 
that the court order authorized by this 
legislation would be issued without any 
indication that the person poses an im-
minent threat to others. The order 
would be issued without any evidence 
that the person ever committed, or has 
even threatened to commit, an act of 
violence with a firearm. 
The ACLU continues: The Rhode Is-
land red flag law—that the standard for 
seeking and issuing an order is so 
broad 
it 
could 
routinely 
be 
used 
against people who engage in over-
blown 
political 
rhetoric 
on 
social 
media. 
Realize what we are talking about 
here. We are talking about red flag 
laws being used against people for over-
blown political rhetoric. If you have 
been on social media, that is 90 percent 
of what is on social media. 
This is, once again, the ACLU of 
Rhode Island: Without the presence of 
counsel, individuals who have no intent 
to commit violent crimes could none-
theless unwittingly incriminate them-
selves regardless of lesser offenses be-
cause, when they are brought in with-
out a lawyer, they can be questioned as 
to other things that could possibly be 
illegal. 
‘‘The heart of the legislation’’— 
Rhode Island’s gun confiscation or-
ders—‘‘requires 
speculation—on 
the 
part of both the petitioner’’—the ac-
cuser—‘‘and judges—about an individ-
ual’s risk of possible violence.’’ 
Mulivor writes: 
But psychiatry and the medical sciences 
have not succeeded in this realm, and there 
is no basis for believing courts will do any 
better. 
He concludes that the potential im-
pact on individuals subject to these 
gun confiscation orders involves much 
more than a long-term seizure of law-
fully owned firearms. 
This is once again from the Rhode Is-
land ACLU. They point out that with-
out a right to appointed counsel, re-
spondents can be forced to submit to a 
mental health evaluation, be subject to 
fairly widespread notifications even be-
fore a court order has been used 
against 
them, 
face 
contempt 
pro-
ceedings and prison for failing to abide 
by any part of the order and unwit-
tingly place themselves in danger. 
So the Rhode Island red flag law ac-
tually requires that people be notified 
that you are a risk to them, that they 
are a potential victim, before the order 
is issued. So we are not talking just 
about the lack of due process in the 
sense that you don’t have a lawyer 
there, you may not have been accused 
of a crime or informed that you might 
be potentially going to commit a 
crime, but, also, in advance of the 
judge even making the judgment, the 
police are told that if this accusation is 
being made, they must inform people. 
So you have to imagine the innocent. 
We can all imagine the guilty. We say: 
Lock ‘em up. Take away their guns. 
But imagine the innocent. Imagine 
someone who is innocent and he is in a 
divorce 
proceeding 
and 
his 
angry 
spouse calls up and says, He’s a threat. 
They go, and even before the judge 
makes the court order, the judge and 
the police say: We must inform those 
who he might be a threat to. 
What if that involves his business 
place? Are we going to inform his boss? 
Are we going to inform his friends? We 
are going to call all the schools in the 
area. 
What if they are innocent? You 
haven’t even heard the evidence that is 
only coming from one side. What if 
they are innocent? Can you imagine a 
person’s life—entire life—being ruined? 
How do you ever get employment 
again? Do you think he could be fired if 
the boss has now been called by the po-
lice and they say: We have a gun order 
against this guy because we think he’s 
a threat. He might be a threat to his 
fellow employees; he might be a threat 
to his wife; he might be a threat to 
schools. We are going to do this, and 
we are letting you know so you can be 
aware. 
Who wants that person to work with 
them? 
If you are doing a background check 
years later and they have had a gun 
confiscation order in their background, 
who ever wants to work with this per-
son? 
So you have to imagine what happens 
to the innocent. We can all imagine the 
terrible, horrible murdering psycho-
paths who committed these massacres 
and how we want them locked up, how 
we want to prevent the killings. 
But you have to imagine when you 
have sweeping laws, what are the po-
tential abuses of the law. You have to 
imagine what it would be like to be an 
innocent person accused of something 
in a divorce proceeding where it esca-
lates and they ask for a gun confisca-
tion order and it is based on malice and 
it is based on lies and deceit and anger 
over a broken marriage. 
This can and will happen. It happens 
in family court every day. The dif-
ference between a divorce and a gun 
confiscation order is that in a divorce, 
if it is very messy, you hear both sides. 
In a gun confiscation order, the initial 
order to take away a gun, in almost 
every red flag law, involves only the 
judge and the accuser. Nobody believes 
that to be justice. It has never been 
justice. 
I mean, when people point out the in-
justice of systems in legal systems, 
they go back to Venice, and they point 
out the doge. They had a lion’s mouth, 
and you could put your complaint in 
the mouth, and it was anonymous, and 
they would make people walk the 
Bridge of Sighs to prison or to death. 
That wasn’t justice. We point that 
out as the height of injustice—anony-
mous accusations, hearing only one 
side. 
There are some people who argue 
that the bedrock of our jurisprudence 
is the adversarial process of the legal 
system. The adversarial process is: You 
get a lawyer, the other side gets a law-
yer. And you know what? We go one 
step further in our system. The govern-
ment has a lawyer. You have a lawyer. 
But you know what? The presumption 
is that you are innocent. 
We start out with the presumption of 
the individual being innocent, and we 
add the hurdle to the government—the 
burden of proof that they must prove 
your guilt. And in the Constitution we 
say for a criminal offense, we must 
prove the guilt beyond a reasonable 
doubt. And yet we are talking about 
taking away fundamental constitu-
tional rights with only hearing the evi-
dence from one side and the standard 
would be a preponderance of the evi-
dence. 
What is a preponderance? It is 50–50. 
And if it is 51–49, we think the person 
may be a threat. But we have only 
heard from their spouse, and we didn’t 
hear from them. We only heard from 
their estranged spouse or we only 
heard from the person who is angry 
with them from work or we heard only

from the person from the opposite po-
litical 
persuasion 
that 
read 
their 
writings on the internet. 
We can see. We can all see the mis-
chief for this. 
So I wish, in the middle of this, in 
the middle of these tragedies, that we 
would think of what we could do. 
New York has already got these red 
flag laws. New York has got lots of 
them. New York has got a lot of gun 
control, and yet the shooting happened 
in Buffalo. 
But the kid in Buffalo had made a 
threat. It is a felony to make a threat 
to kill others. He could have been pros-
ecuted. 
So I fear, even with this law, if we 
don’t pay attention to the laws we al-
ready have, if we don’t persist and per-
severe in prosecuting these kids that 
show this danger—we already had—it is 
not that we just had the signals they 
might; they are committing crimes. 
Why don’t we prosecute them? Why 
don’t we use the laws on the books? 
But I would say that there is a big risk 
today to encouraging, across the coun-
try, jurisprudence where you don’t 
have legal representation, where the 
adjudication is based on evidence only 
from one side, and then you finally get 
your day in court and you get your 
lawyer, and everybody is petrified of 
reversing a decision where you have 
been named a threat. 
I think we want the same thing in 
the end. My hope, though, is that peo-
ple would be very careful because I 
would not want to see a day where we 
change and reverse justice in our sys-
tem such that people are guilty until 
proven innocent. 
The bedrock of American jurispru-
dence 
is 
‘‘innocent 
until 
proven 
guilty.’’ The burden is on the govern-
ment. And until we can make red flag 
laws consistent with innocent until 
proven guilty, we should reject them. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Ohio. 
TRIBUTE TO COLIN MCGINNIS 
Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I would 
like to honor a longtime member of the 
Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs 
Committee staff, Colin McGinnis, as he 
moves on to a new, well-deserved chap-
ter: retirement. 
He will be spending more time with 
his beloved wife Claire—and with the 
first person he visited upon retire-
ment—his 95-year-old mother Barb, at 
her peaceful lake home in Minnesota. 
Colin is a lifelong public servant. He 
spent 33 years working in Congress. 
Even when he briefly left this institu-
tion, he remained in service, working 
for the Orthodox Relief Service. 
To say the least, Colin’s career is un-
paralleled. Colin grew up in Morris, 
MN, and attended Carleton College in 
Northfield, MN. He went on to earn his 
masters of divinity from Yale Univer-
sity—and we saw those divinity school 
values woven throughout his career. 
Colin’s congressional career began in 
service to his home State. He worked 
for Representative Jim Oberstar, Rep-
resentative Bruce Vento, Representa-
tive 
Terry 
Sabo, 
and 
the 
former 
Carleton College professor, Senator 
Paul Wellstone. In each office, he made 
a positive difference for Minnesotans. 
Colin was serving as chief of staff to 
Senator Wellstone at the time of his 
tragic death in 2002. It was a cata-
strophic loss for Minnesota and for our 
country. And for his staff, it was a 
heartbreaking personal tragedy. Colin 
took care of his colleagues and got 
them through an unimaginably dif-
ficult time. He was a rock for the office 
and led with composure and grace 
while grieving a mentor he met while 
he was a student at Carleton, then 
later worked with for a decade. 
In 2008, Colin became the acting staff 
director of the Senate Banking, Hous-
ing, and Urban Affairs Committee 
under Chairman Dodd. He led the com-
mittee through one of the worst finan-
cial crises in U.S. history. 
As always, Colin stepped up. It was a 
scary time. The economy was in 
freefall. We had never seen anything 
like that in our lifetime. Colin was the 
steady hand that Senator Dodd and the 
committee needed. He was a trusted 
and an invaluable adviser to Chairman 
Dodd, Chairman Johnson, and to me. 
For the last 9 years, Colin has served 
as the committee’s policy director. I 
remember when I first took over as 
ranking member on the committee, 
meeting with the staff in our hearing 
room on the fifth floor of Dirksen in 
late 2014. I didn’t know anyone yet, and 
these talented public servants were ex-
perts in their field. Many had spent 
years working for the committee. 
Frankly, I was a little nervous. And 
at the end of the meeting, of course it 
was Colin who came up to talk to me, 
reassure me, break the ice. He could 
not have been more kind and wel-
coming. 
Colin’s 
many, 
many 
accomplish-
ments with the Banking and Housing 
Committee include his instrumental 
work on the Joint Comprehensive Plan 
of Action—the Obama administration’s 
diplomatic success to limit Iran’s nu-
clear program—the bipartisan Coun-
tering America’s Adversaries Through 
Sanctions Act in 2017, and the historic 
Anti-Money Laundering Act and the 
Corporate Transparency Act in 2020. 
That bill was the product of over a 
decade and a half of attempts and 
months of bipartisan negotiations— 
often expertly shepherded by Colin. 
Today, its passage is giving law en-
forcement new, modern tools to stop 
human traffickers and other criminals 
and root out shell companies. 
In his 30-plus years on the Hill, Colin 
has seen administrations and majori-
ties of both parties come and go. And 
through them all, he had an uncommon 
skill at fostering relationships across 
the aisle. Throughout his career, Colin 
also became known for his deep knowl-
edge on international sanctions—he 
was the one that everyone wanted to 
work with. Sanctions have become one 
of our country’s primary foreign policy 
tool over the last decade. And Colin 
was the expert. And of course, that ex-
pertise has probably never been more 
relevant than it has this year, as we 
have worked to unite this body in sup-
port of the President’s strong sanctions 
on Russia. 
But these wins are only a small part 
of Colin’s lasting legacy on the Hill—he 
impacted everyone he worked with. He 
could work effectively with pretty 
much 
everyone—Republicans 
and 
Democrats alike, through Presidential 
administrations of both parties. Colin 
impressed all of us with that effective-
ness, with his dedication to his work, 
and, perhaps most of all, with his kind-
ness. 
He worked toward big-picture goals— 
from mental health parity to inter-
national sanctions—but he never lost 
sight of the individuals: the people 
whom he worked with and the people 
whom we serve. 
Those who were lucky enough to 
work alongside Colin describe him as 
someone who makes the hard things 
look flawless, day in and day out—an 
impressive feat in this line of work. 
Among staff, he was known for his love 
of language. Colin sometimes referred 
to his work as ‘‘toiling in the legisla-
tive vineyards’’—one of many examples 
that reflect his natural optimism. He is 
a voracious reader, and he made good 
use of the Library of Congress, often 
getting several books a week delivered 
to the office. 
He always had time for his cowork-
ers, regardless of their position—from 
the staff director to the interns. He 
carved out space for everyone to grow 
professionally and personally. He chal-
lenged us, too. 
Colin had an open-door policy. His of-
fice was always tidy and decorated 
with pictures of friends and family. 
And most days, you could find a mem-
ber of staff—sometimes Banking and 
Housing, but often from other offices— 
sitting on his couch asking for advice 
and counsel. Colin always had wisdom 
to share. 
Colin commuted every day from Bal-
timore for 24 years—rain or shine. He 
came in to work early so that, most 
days, he could catch the 5 p.m. train 
back to Baltimore and sit down at the 
dinner table with his family. 
To his wife Claire and their children 
Killian and Patrick: Thank you for 
sharing him with us. 
Colin’s dedication and commitment 
to public service made a difference for 
so many. Our country is a better place 
because of his service. And each of us 
are better because of his leadership. 
On behalf of everyone in my office 
and on the committee and all those 
who had the honor of working with 
him, we congratulate Colin on his ca-
reer, we wish him well in retirement, 
and we thank him for his service.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S3128 
June 23, 2022 
are printed in today’s RECORD under 
‘‘Statements on Introduced Bills and 
Joint Resolutions.’’) 
Mr. PADILLA. I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Utah. 
S. 2938 
Mr. LEE. Mr. President, I rise to 
speak in opposition to the bill before 
us. 
All too often, we very often applaud 
instinctively the concept of ‘‘biparti-
sanship’’ but fail to actually evaluate 
the policies underlying bipartisan leg-
islation and the effect that our policies 
may have on law-abiding Americans. 
Bipartisanship is a good thing. In 
fact, bipartisanship is an inevitability 
in any legislative body that contains 
multiple parties with significant rep-
resentation. It certainly is an indispen-
sable feature of this legislative body, 
as it is virtually impossible to pass any 
legislation—with only the rarest of ex-
ceptions arising at most once or twice 
in a year—except through bipartisan-
ship. 
The question isn’t whether to achieve 
bipartisanship or whether it is good 
but what policies are produced through 
the bipartisanship in question. 
Don’t get me wrong—in this polar-
ized climate, it is good when people of 
different political affiliations and dif-
ferent backgrounds, representing dif-
ferent parts of our great country, are 
able to come together and have produc-
tive conversations. These conversa-
tions occur with some regularity. In 
fact, they occur far more often than 
most people would assume based on de-
pictions in the news and entertainment 
media in this country. 
It is also good when those conversa-
tions lead to legislation that is further 
refined on the Senate floor through ro-
bust debate and an amendment process, 
one that refines the legislation in ques-
tion to make sure that all viewpoints 
have been taken into account. But that 
is, tragically, not what happened with 
this legislation. No one—no one except 
a small ‘‘gang’’ of Senators and a few 
favored members of the news media— 
no one was allowed to view the legisla-
tion until Tuesday evening. Less than 
an hour later, less than an hour after it 
had been released to the public, re-
leased to us, the Senate was forced to 
vote on whether we should proceed to 
the legislation in question. 
Immediately after that vote, the ma-
jority leader filled the amendment tree 
and filed the cloture motion to end de-
bate on the bill without a single hear-
ing held or a single amendment having 
been debated or considered or even of-
fered. In fact, it couldn’t be offered be-
cause prior to that time, there was 
nothing to amend. 
Now, less than 48 hours after we re-
ceived the text of this legislation for 
the very first time, the Senate has 
voted to end debate—a debate that 
never really started; a debate that in-
volved 
not 
a 
single 
amendment 
passed—no, not one single one; a de-
bate in which there was not a single 
opportunity for Members to offer im-
provements to the legislation. No. This 
small gang came together, material-
ized, and put together a bill. It released 
the bill, and all of a sudden, we were 
expected to vote on it up or down, yes 
or no, no changes, no questions asked. 
Those of us who are not members of 
this particular gang were told, essen-
tially: Too bad. We don’t want your 
input. Your only option is to support 
this entire bill, warts and all, ambigu-
ities and all, vagueness and all, with-
out any changes; or, on the other hand, 
you can oppose it, and you would be ac-
cused of savagely not wanting to pro-
tect children from school shootings. 
That is not what our Founding Fa-
thers envisioned for the U.S. Senate. It 
is not how they imagined it working. It 
is also not how it worked for hundreds 
of years. 
For more than two centuries, the 
U.S. Senate functioned in a way that 
has had as its distinguishing char-
acteristic those procedures that earned 
it the title of being the world’s great-
est deliberative body. Chief among 
those features was the willingness and 
the ability of each Member to offer up 
improvements in the form of amend-
ments and have those amendments 
considered, debated, discussed, and ul-
timately voted upon. 
But, unfortunately, this is how the 
Senate has been run over the last few 
Congresses. Sadly, we have seen some 
of this under Democratic and Repub-
lican leadership alike. This isn’t just 
bad news for the Senate; it is especially 
bad news for the American people, who 
deserve better from an entity that still 
calls itself the world’s greatest delib-
erative body. 
It is not without notice that this has 
become a problem. It is not without no-
tice that we have deviated from this. 
The thing is, when we deviate from our 
own procedure and our own processes, 
the substance shows. The inadequacies 
of the substance are the natural, fore-
seeable result. They are the inevitable 
product of a defiant refusal to abide by 
our 
most 
time-honored 
procedures: 
rules and customs. 
In this case, the substantive prob-
lems with this bill are pretty signifi-
cant. The restrictions that it imposes 
on the Second Amendment rights of 
law-abiding Americans are significant, 
and those impositions come about in 
such a way that burdens the American 
people, while doing little or nothing to 
address actual gun violence committed 
by prohibited persons in many of our 
largest cities. 
You would think that a bill that pur-
ports to be able to keep kids safe in 
schools would at least have some fund-
ing for school security measures or 
school resource officers, but if you felt 
that, you would be wrong. 
I am very skeptical of Federal inter-
vention in education. If Congress is 
going to provide billions of dollars of 
mental health funding to schools and 
claim to keep kids safe, we should at 
least allow States to use some of their 
funding for security measures, like re-
inforced doors, school resource officers, 
or training programs for teachers who 
are allowed to conceal and carry if 
they choose. 
This bill provides Federal grant fund-
ing for State red flag laws without suf-
ficient due process protections. This is 
a trick—a trick—often used by Con-
gress, increasingly so of late. Congress 
does this sometimes when it has no 
constitutional authority and some-
times when it lacks political will. 
Instead of passing the Federal law at 
issue—the Federal law that it wishes it 
could pass—Congress bribes the States 
with money to pass the laws that Con-
gress wants, that Congress wishes Con-
gress could pass but for whatever rea-
son can’t or won’t. This allows Mem-
bers of Congress to go to their home 
States and take credit for doing ‘‘some-
thing,’’ even if that ‘‘something’’ does 
nothing to address the problem. 
That impulse to do something has 
been noticed. It has been noticed by 
Professor Robert Leider of George 
Mason University and the Antonin 
Scalia Law School. He penned an op-ed 
in today’s copy of the Wall Street 
Journal. In that op-ed, he begins with 
the following words: 
When mass shootings such as Uvalde hap-
pen, a rallying cry emerges for Congress to 
do something—anything—to prevent such 
tragedies in the future. On Tuesday, senators 
introduced the Bipartisan Safer Commu-
nities Act—their effort to do something. But 
when your sole rallying cry is to do some-
thing, the thing you do may be worse than 
the status quo. The Bipartisan Safer Com-
munities Act is a terrible bill, and in its cur-
rent form, it ought to be defeated by a bipar-
tisan coalition of Congress. 
Professor Leider then goes on to ex-
plain why opposition to this legislation 
ought to be coming from the left and 
from the right. He explains in great de-
tail why Democrats and Republicans, 
liberals and conservatives alike, some-
times for similar reasons, sometimes 
for different reasons, should be out-
raged, should be upset by this legisla-
tion. It offends people at every end of 
the political spectrum. I will go more 
into some of those details in a moment 
from Professor Leider. 
But, look, when the government 
seeks to deprive an American citizen— 
a law-abiding American citizen—of a 
constitutional right, we have protec-
tions in place, and those protections 
can be found among other provisions in 
the Constitution. They can be found in 
the 5th and 14th Amendments to the 
Constitution. In both provisions, you 
have a due process clause. In both the 
5th and the 14th Amendments, it says 
that a person can’t be deprived of life, 
liberty, or property without due proc-
ess of law. 
What does ‘‘due process’’ mean? Well, 
‘‘due process’’ means the right to be 
heard. You can’t have a deprivation of 
life, liberty, or property without due 
process. The word ‘‘without’’ has been 
interpreted and fairly does mean ‘‘be-
fore.’’ You have to have due process be-
fore they take it away from you. It

means meaningful review at a mean-
ingful time. It doesn’t—it can’t mean 
they can take away life, liberty, or 
property and then ask questions later. 
It doesn’t mean they can take away 
life, liberty, and property and there-
after demand that the person from 
whom they took it return to litigate 
his or her right to exercise that thing 
that was taken. 
Red flag laws enacted in States thus 
far get this exactly backward—confis-
cation first; due process later. That is 
not how due process works. That is not 
what due process is. You can call that 
process, but it is not due process, not 
for these purposes. It doesn’t work. 
The confiscation before notice and a 
hearing, this model—this confiscation 
before notice and hearing model of red 
flag laws raises concerns of civil asset 
forfeiture, when a person is forced to 
forfeit her firearm pursuant to a civil 
order without a hearing. 
This legislation places overly broad 
and undefined restrictions on Second 
Amendment 
rights—the 
Second 
Amendment rights of law-abiding citi-
zens—creating the risk that false alle-
gations could and inevitably would 
lead to the deprivation of a constitu-
tional right with no recourse afforded 
to address the harm suffered. 
Now, when you look at the legisla-
tion, there are pieces of the legislation 
that pay lipservice to due process. 
While the legislation, you might say, 
draws near unto due process with its 
lips, its heart is far from it. When you 
read the fine print, the due process of 
which it refers is not due process at all; 
it is post-depravation due process. 
The very specific procedural protec-
tions that we associate with due proc-
ess—an opportunity to be heard before 
a fair, impartial tribunal; the oppor-
tunity to offer up evidence; the oppor-
tunity to cross-examine adverse wit-
nesses, for example—things that we as-
sociate 
as 
inextricably 
intertwined 
with due process because they are, 
those things are all articulated at the 
back end of this due process paragraph 
of the bill. 
And it makes reference to the fact 
that that is the type of due process 
that, in the view of the bill, can, ac-
cording to State law, be made either 
before or after the constitutional dep-
ravation in question, depending on the 
dictates of the State law at issue. That 
is not due process; that is something 
else, and that creates a lot of problems. 
There are other problems with the 
legislation 
dealing 
with 
juveniles, 
problems arising out of uncertainties 
that the legislation itself creates. 
Now, I want to be clear about some-
thing: I could certainly consider sup-
porting a measure prohibiting certain 
older juveniles who have been con-
victed of crimes as adults, crimes that 
if they had been committed by an adult 
would have been deemed felonies, and, 
on that basis, deem them prohibited 
persons. I could consider that. There 
are a lot of public policy questions sur-
rounding that. 
And I think there are a lot of people 
on the left and on the right who would 
have concerns with opening that up, 
with saying: We are going to allow—in 
fact, require—juvenile records to be en-
tered into the NICS system. Remem-
ber, the NICS system is a database, a 
database that is used to identify pro-
hibited persons, persons who are pro-
hibited from buying or otherwise ac-
quiring or even possessing firearms and 
ammunition, as defined by 18 U.S.C. 
section 922(g) or, alternatively, persons 
to whom one may not lawfully sell or 
otherwise transfer firearms or ammu-
nition, as defined by 18 U.S.C. section 
922(d). Both 922(d) that talks about 
those to whom you may not transfer a 
weapon and 922(g), those who may not 
acquire or possess a weapon—both pro-
visions have nine paragraphs attached 
to them. In each instance, the nine 
paragraphs are virtually identical. In 
other words, the universe of those who 
may not buy or possess weapons is es-
sentially the same as those to whom 
you may not sell them. 
It is almost essential—in fact, the 
only distinction I can think of under 
existing law is that while under 922(g) 
you may not possess a firearm if you 
are a convicted felon, that same prohi-
bition extends in 922(d) in such a way 
that you may not sell or otherwise 
transfer a firearm to a person who is 
either a convicted felon or has been in-
dicted for a felony and is standing 
under 
indictment, 
under 
currently 
pending criminal charges. Other than 
that, as far as I can tell, 922(d) and 
922(g) are coextensive. 
This legislation changes that a little 
bit, and it prohibits the transfer of a 
weapon, under 922(d), to a person who, 
as a juvenile, stood convicted of a 
crime that would be a felony. Now, this 
creates all sorts of uncertainties in the 
law because, in many if not most 
States, juvenile proceedings—what we 
would consider juvenile criminal pro-
ceedings—are, in fact, not criminal 
proceedings. The defendant isn’t enti-
tled to a jury trial. And in the Federal 
criminal system, a juvenile criminal 
defendant may not have a jury trial; 
that even if they want one, even if all 
the parties were to agree, they can’t 
allow them. 
In many State systems, including the 
State system in my State, the State of 
Utah, juvenile criminal proceedings are 
not even criminal proceedings; they are 
civil proceedings, very often conducted 
under civil law procedures rather than 
criminal law procedures. So the same 
protections aren’t in place. 
Again, I am open to the idea of open-
ing this up because I think there are 
some juveniles who commit some of-
fenses, particularly in their later teen-
age years, that perhaps ought to be 
taken into account for purposes of 
922(d) such that you can’t give them a 
gun or under 922(g) such that they may 
not possess a gun without committing 
a felony. 
I think we could have that debate 
and discussion. We should have that de-
bate and discussion. That hasn’t oc-
curred here. Instead, what we have 
done is muddied the waters by creating 
a very significant difference between 
922(d) and 922(g), between those prohib-
ited from being given a gun and those 
who are prohibited from possessing a 
gun. But we haven’t defined it well, 
and it is not really clear what it is that 
we are doing or what it is that makes 
it fair; nor is it clear, as I read the leg-
islation—and, again, it has been less 
than 48 hours since we have had access 
to it. It is about 80 pages long. It 
doesn’t read like a fast-paced novel. It 
is full of cross-references. 
And even someone such as a former 
Federal prosecutor who is very familiar 
with these laws and prosecuted cases 
under them—even with that level of fa-
miliarity, it has taken me some time 
to get through it and understand what 
it means. In fact, to this moment, it is 
difficult for me to ascertain exactly 
how far these changes go. 
It is not clear to me, for instance, 
which kinds of criminal records for ju-
veniles will be added onto the NICS 
system. Remember, the NICS system is 
this database that identifies those pro-
hibited from possessing firearms or 
being given firearms under 922(g) and 
922(d), respectively. It is a database 
that keeps track of those prohibited 
persons. It is not clear to me which 
types of juvenile records can be taken 
into account in those proceedings. 
This also allows for a prohibited—one 
can be a prohibited person under 922(d) 
and 922(g) if they have been adju-
dicated—and this is terribly awkward 
language—if they have been adju-
dicated as a ‘‘mental defective’’ or if 
they have been ordered institutional-
ized. No one really knows what that 
term means. It is a sloppy term. It is 
an offensive term to many, and it is 
full of uncertainty. 
We have compounded the uncertainty 
by now saying that mental health 
records of older teenagers, those be-
tween 16 and 18, will now be uploaded 
onto the NICS system such that cer-
tain mental health crises one experi-
ences as an older teenager could result 
in an older teenager later in life being 
unable to possess a firearm without 
committing a felony. 
That raises some concerns—or at 
least those drafting the bill would 
probably interpret it differently, to say 
they may possess one in some cases but 
not necessarily be someone to whom a 
gun can lawfully be sold or otherwise 
transferred. That also raises additional 
questions. Sections 922(d) and 922(g) are 
currently nearly identical, except in 
the rare exception that I noted just a 
moment ago. 
Yet we have had no conversations 
about these. We have had no conversa-
tions about what this does for juvenile 
criminal justice, about what this does 
to the rights of individuals who, as ju-
veniles, may not fully understand the 
ramifications of the criminal pro-
ceedings against them or of decisions 
regarding their mental health at the

time those decisions are made and that 
might affect them later in life, includ-
ing after they have become adults. 
My point is not to say these things 
don’t matter. They do. And I think 
there are a lot of these people who 
probably 
shouldn’t 
have 
guns 
and 
should be prohibited persons, but we 
need to know what we are doing. We 
need to agree on what is actually hap-
pening because right now we take some 
areas of the law that are already 
fraught with some uncertainty, and we 
are 
magnifying 
that 
uncertainty 
manyfold. 
I think that is dangerous, and I think 
it is dangerous in a way that both 
Democrats and Republicans ought to 
find offensive—sometimes for the same 
reasons, sometimes for entirely dif-
ferent reasons. My point is this. There 
is no reason why legislation like this— 
it does—it has got some good provi-
sions in it. There is no reason why this 
couldn’t be amended in such a way that 
would allow more Members of this body 
to vote for it or vote against it, de-
pending on what it looked like at the 
end of the day. 
But the way it is written, it has got 
a lot of problems with it. We have got 
the due process problem that I men-
tioned with the red flag laws. That is 
their distinguishing characteristic is 
due process problem. You have got the 
juvenile records problem that I men-
tioned just a moment ago. It is not fair 
to people to leave them in that state of 
uncertainty, especially juveniles. So 
that ought to be a concern to all of us. 
Perhaps we might get to the place 
where these provisions do just what the 
proponents of the bill say that it does. 
But in this instance, as in so many 
other areas, the best way to get there 
is to go through the normal delibera-
tive process, the process that long de-
fined this institution as the world’s 
greatest deliberative body, which in-
cludes a full opportunity to present 
and vote on amendments and to hear 
concerns 
and 
objections 
raised 
by 
Members of this body, Members of this 
body some of whom have experience 
with the statutory framework in ques-
tion and can offer insights as to what 
might have been overlooked. 
Now, look, I speak here of my col-
leagues who were part of this effort. I 
speak with great respect toward them 
and admiration for the fact that I 
think they are motivated, by and large, 
by a desire to help people. I don’t think 
any Member of this body wakes up 
every day and says, ‘‘I want to make 
America less safe’’ or ‘‘I want to make 
America less fair.’’ I don’t think that is 
what is going on. 
But I do think we delude ourselves, 
we sell ourselves short, and we harm 
our constituents when we pretend that 
it is OK to pull the functional equiva-
lent, the legislative equivalent, of run-
ning through a congested intersection 
with our eyes closed and think that 
that is not going to cause problems. 
That is exactly what we are doing here. 
This is the legislative equivalent of 
driving with your eyes closed through 
a busy intersection, and we are making 
some really big mistakes here. And a 
lot of these are mistakes that could be 
fixed with relative ease. 
Now we will never know. We will 
never know what might have happened. 
It may be that this could have been 
something that, had we gone through 
the whole amendment process, could 
have been supported by nearly all or 
even all Members of this body, but we 
will never know of that now. We will 
never have that opportunity. Instead, 
we are going to push through this 
rushed piece of legislation that I am 
convinced no one had read in its en-
tirety prior to its release and, essen-
tially, no one was familiar with by the 
time we started voting on it. 
And then we were told: No oppor-
tunity to make it better. If you notice 
a problem with it—and I have noticed 
several—we really don’t care to hear 
about it. Expediency demands that we 
somehow just rush this through. 
But the American people deserve bet-
ter. There are, moreover, other provi-
sions of the legislation that have raised 
some eyebrows in some corners. They 
are provisions of this bill that provide 
funding to encourage States to provide 
Medicaid and CHIP services in schools 
under the auspices of an effort to in-
crease access to mental health, to men-
tal health services in the schools. 
While Federal Medicaid funding is, of 
course, something that cannot lawfully 
be used to perform abortions except in 
the case of rape, incest, or to preserve 
the life of the mother, some have 
pointed out that schools under this leg-
islation easily could use the clinics es-
tablished under the bill as a means of 
accomplishing the provision of abor-
tions and also prescribe abortifacient 
drugs using State rather than Federal 
Medicaid funds. There has been some 
discussion even today about this. The 
fact that we still don’t know this is 
troubling to many. I certainly would 
like to know what the definitive an-
swer to it is. As far as I can tell, it does 
open the door to that, and we ought to 
at least have that discussion. 
Now, there are some legislative op-
tions before us that address things that 
can be done practically to improve 
safety. One is the Luke and Alex 
School Safety Act, which is included in 
this bill. Like I said, there are plenty 
of 
things 
in 
this 
bill 
that 
are 
unobjectionable. And this is, certainly, 
first among them. And it codifies into 
law 
the 
Federal 
clearinghouse 
on 
school safety. I spoke in favor of this 
bill at a Judiciary Committee hearing 
just last week. 
Additionally, I support the bill’s pro-
visions increasing penalties for straw 
purchasers who know or have reason to 
know that the gun they are purchasing 
for someone might be used in a crime. 
And I am open to other proposals that 
tackle safety in schools head-on. 
Senator MARSHALL, from Kansas, has 
an interesting amendment that would 
use unspent COVID funds to improve 
school safety and school security. 
Look, there are a lot of things in this 
legislation that really ought to be dis-
cussed 
in 
greater 
detail. 
And 
we 
haven’t been able to discuss them. We 
haven’t been able to debate them. We 
haven’t been able to amend them be-
cause of the rushed process. It begs the 
question: Why are we in such a rush? 
Don’t America’s schoolchildren and 
America’s 
teachers 
and 
America’s 
moms and dads deserve better consider-
ation than this? 
Schools are out for the summer at 
the moment. It would actually be a 
good thing for us to take a few more 
weeks to debate and discuss these 
things and get to a better solution. 
Why are we rushing it? 
I want to get back to the juvenile 
provisions for a minute. This is some-
thing that Professor Leider speaks 
about at some length. And he raised 
some observations that I hadn’t en-
tirely considered. And I would like to 
share some portions of that. At the end 
of this, I will be offering this. 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-
sent to have printed in the RECORD this 
op-ed submitted by Professor Leider. 
Professor Leider describes one fea-
ture of the bill as particularly discour-
aging, particular troubling. I spoke of 
the juvenile provisions a moment ago. 
I identified some troubling features of 
them. Professor Leider gives additional 
commentary on this and provides addi-
tional observations, not all of which 
had been noticed by me. Here is how he 
puts it: 
The most significant provision in the bill 
is the prohibition against firearm possession 
by those convicted of a misdemeanor violent 
crime against a dating partner—closing the 
‘‘boyfriend loophole.’’ 
He goes through this after he has dis-
cussed the problems with the juvenile 
provisions, noting that this will create 
disparities. It will cause uncertainties 
with juvenile offenders of one sort or 
another. And then he does go through a 
fuller explanation of how those oper-
ating under the boyfriend loophole pro-
visions might be affected. 
He continues: 
But the senators who negotiated this bill 
evidently couldn’t agree on the definition of 
a dating partner. They define ‘‘dating rela-
tionship’’ as a ‘‘relationship between individ-
uals who have or have recently had a con-
tinuing serious relationship of a romantic or 
intimate nature.’’ But relationships come in 
all forms, and this definition provides little 
guidance. 
He continues: 
The senators provided three criteria for 
consideration: (1) the length of the relation-
ship, (2) the nature of the relationship and 
(3) the frequency and type of interaction be-
tween the people involved in the relation-
ship. 
Professor Leider continues: 
This means that a ‘‘continuing serious re-
lationship’’ will be some function of quantity 
of dates, length of time and physical inti-
macy. But these vague factors don’t provide 
fair notice and are susceptible to incon-
sistent application. 
We pause there to just note what he 
is referring to. The so-called boyfriend

loophole exists because two of the pro-
visions in 18 USC 922(g), defining the 
prohibitive persons, paragraphs 8 and 9 
respectively, apply to those individuals 
who have either been in receipt of a re-
straining order arising out of a domes-
tic relationship, under paragraph 8, or 
those who have been convicted of a 
misdemeanor crime of domestic vio-
lence under paragraph 9 of 922(g). 
In both cases, there has to be a rela-
tionship that makes it about a domes-
tic situation, has to be an intimate 
partner of one sort or another. Current 
law tends to define that as a spouse— 
when you are dealing with a spouse or 
a live-in partner, for example. But this 
provision seeks to address what the 
sponsors of the bill referred to as the 
‘‘boyfriend loophole,’’ meaning what 
about someone who is not married and 
who doesn’t reside with or hasn’t re-
sided in the past, didn’t reside at the 
time with the person but was nonethe-
less in a type of romantic relationship. 
Now, here again, it is not a bad im-
pulse to want to close some ambigu-
ities in the law, but you have got to do 
it with language that makes sense. You 
have to do it with language that puts 
people on fair notice of what the con-
sequences of a guilty plea might be or 
what the consequences of not litigating 
more aggressively in the context of a 
restraining order or something like 
that might be. Particularly in the con-
text of 922(g)9, where we are dealing 
with a domestic violence misdemeanor, 
the person needs to know when that 
person is being asked to plead guilty 
what consequences that might have on 
the person later in life. And those ques-
tions aren’t answered here. 
Professor Leider continues: 
By failing to define ‘‘dating relation-
ship’’— 
The term ‘‘dating relationship’’— 
[A]dequately— 
That is the term of art that they in-
troduced into this legislation— 
Congress is effectively delegating the crit-
ical question of who falls within this ban. To 
whom it is delegating the hard details re-
mains to be determined. Perhaps it will be to 
the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms 
and Explosives, which has regulatory au-
thorities over firearms or the courts may de-
cide as they resolve cases. Either way, Con-
gress has yet again handed off its responsi-
bility for defining crimes to unelected bu-
reaucrats and judges. 
Then he continues: 
Until a specific definition exists, it is un-
clear how the federal government will imple-
ment this prohibition. Suppose a criminal- 
records check indicates that a potential pur-
chaser has committed assault or battery. 
What next? Maybe the trial record will show 
that the defendant was in a relationship with 
the complaining witness. Or maybe it won’t. 
If such information is available, how is the 
examiner supposed to gauge the relation-
ship? The available records likely won’t pro-
vide the precise details of the relationship. 
Even if they do, the examiner still has to de-
cide whether the relationship was serious 
enough to trigger the gun disability. The 
Senate compromise feeds many prospective 
gun owners to the bureaucratic wolves. 
Professor Leider’s point is an excel-
lent 
one. 
When 
people 
are 
going 
through criminal proceedings, if they 
have been charged with a misdemeanor 
and they are deciding how aggressively 
to fight it—whether to take it to trial, 
whether to plead guilty, under what 
terms to plead guilty—it is nearly al-
ways going to be in State court. After 
all, very few criminal convictions are 
in criminal court, a tiny percentage of 
them. And the prohibited persons, as 
defined under sections 922(d) and 922(g), 
the underlying convictions can be ei-
ther State or Federal. 
These proceedings, nearly always 
taking place in State court rather than 
Federal court, are not going to be in a 
position, it is not knowing to be within 
their jurisdiction to decide whether, or 
to what extent, this will put them in 
that status, in that boyfriend status, in 
that status of a ‘‘dating relationship.’’ 
The fact that the term is so vague, 
the structure is so broad and undefined 
that it is not reasonably possible to 
know what consequences the law might 
attach to a guilty plea in that cir-
cumstance or to a conviction following 
a jury trial in that circumstance. 
You know, James Madison said, in 
‘‘Federalist No. 62’’—and I am para-
phrasing here—something to the effect 
that it will be of little avail to the 
American people that their laws may 
be written by individuals of their own 
choosing. If those laws are so volumi-
nous, complex, or ever changing that 
they can’t reasonably know from one 
day to the next what the law requires 
of them, this is one of those moments. 
We are imposing a pretty significant 
restriction—a restriction on a con-
stitutionally protected right, one that 
may well apply for the rest of their life 
in some cases without them even 
knowing what is happening. 
This is the kind of rain that will fall 
on the criminal defendant of all back-
grounds, of all political views. Every 
demographic could be harmed by this 
in one way or another. So it really 
would be better if we were taking the 
time to draft this legislation carefully. 
And that is my No. 1 complaint. That 
is why I can’t vote for it. 
There are some things in here I wish 
I could vote for, but they have lumped 
it all together. They said: Here you go. 
Take it or leave it. 
But, look, you put red flag laws in 
here, knowing the red flag laws, the 
way we have now outsourced them to 
States and that we have now started 
paying the States, giving them money 
to adopt red flag laws whose distin-
guishing characteristic is to take away 
someone’s constitutionally protected 
right without due process of law—that 
is a problem. And when you add to that 
complexity 
by 
adding 
uncertainty 
about the juvenile records problem 
that I identified, which ought to be 
concerning to many liberals as well as 
many conservatives, and when you add 
to that by coming up with this vague, 
broad definition of ‘‘dating relation-
ship,’’ it has huge consequences with 
no reasonable ability to understand 
and ascertain how certain court pro-
ceedings might affect someone’s rights, 
perhaps for the rest of their life, that is 
a problem. 
It doesn’t have to be this way. I look 
forward to the day when the Senate 
will operate the way that it was de-
signed to, the way that it once did, the 
way that, in fact, it has operated in the 
not-too-distant past. But we have to 
demand it. As long as people continue 
to tolerate, continue to accept and con-
done and reward and encourage this 
type of sham process, we will be left 
with subpar legislation, sloppily writ-
ten. 
I will conclude with the words, once 
again, of Professor Leider, who says it 
well. 
The Bipartisan Safer Communities Act 
will likely pass because members of Congress 
feel enormous pressure to do something. But 
it is not a good bill, and it deserves further 
deliberation and refinement. The Senate’s 
job is to help draft good laws by cooling the 
passions of the moment. Right now, it is fail-
ing. 
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the 
RECORD, as follows: 
(By Robert Leider) 
‘‘When mass shootings such as Uvalde hap-
pen, a rallying cry emerges for Congress to 
do something—anything—to prevent such 
tragedies in the future. On Tuesday senators 
introduced the Bipartisan Safer Commu-
nities Act—their effort to do something. But 
when your sole rallying cry is to do some-
thing, the thing you do may be worse than 
the status quo. The Bipartisan Safer Com-
munities Act is a terrible bill, and in its cur-
rent form, it ought to be defeated by a bipar-
tisan political coalition of Congress. 
Liberals should hate the bill because most 
of its gun-control provisions are antithetical 
to their criminal-justice reform agenda. The 
law expands the categories of those to whom 
it is unlawful to sell a gun or ammunition to 
include anyone convicted of a felony as a ju-
venile. This will ensnare many because the 
modern definition of a ‘‘felony’’ is exception-
ally broad and includes offenses that aren’t 
particularly serious. The bill also changes 
the federal prohibition on selling firearms to 
those who have been involuntarily com-
mitted to a mental institution. While it ex-
cludes involuntary commitments before age 
16, the bill significantly strengthens the en-
forcement of the prohibition against those 
involuntarily committed between 16 and 18. 
We should be cautious before we make it 
impossible for children to live normal adult 
lives. As liberals often point out (particu-
larly when the death penalty is involved), 
children and teenagers lack maturity and 
impulse control. If this bill becomes law, a 
12-year-old who joyrides in a car may find 
that he may never be allowed to purchase a 
gun or ammunition. Although liberals may 
not cry at the thought of fewer people being 
able to own guns, they should be concerned. 
A gun ban for youthful indiscretions means 
that these juveniles will become unemploy-
able as adults in many security, law-enforce-
ment and military positions that require 
firearm possession. And this ban will affect 
them no matter how much time has passed 
since their juvenile convictions. 
The gun ban would have significant racial 
and socioeconomic disparities. Wealthy com-
munities will find ways around the gun ban 
for their children: having robust pretrial di-
version programs that don’t result in tech-
nical convictions, accessing pardons through 
the political process, and hiring lawyers to

expunge convictions. In poorer communities, 
children will simply be forced to take pleas 
that will forever alter their futures. The 
same 
goes 
on 
the 
mental-health 
side: 
Wealthy parents can seek voluntary treat-
ment for their children in circumstances 
that may cause poorer families to seek in-
voluntary commitment. The bill also raises 
the maximum prison term for unlawful fire-
arm possession from 10 years to 15, and these 
regulatory offenses—as liberals often com-
plain—disproportionately affect poor and mi-
nority communities. 
Conservatives and gun owners should hate 
the bill, too. Gun owners who have com-
mitted juvenile indiscretions will find that 
they are no longer able to purchase firearms 
or ammunition. The bill also has strange 
technical defects. It prohibits the sale of 
guns and ammunition to those convicted of 
juvenile offenses, but it doesn’t explicitly 
ban possession—a loophole that someone will 
clamor to close later. For adults who had in-
voluntary commitments before they were 16, 
the reverse is true: 
The bill allows firearms to be sold to them, 
but it doesn’t decriminalize their possession 
of a firearm. 
The most significant provision in the bill 
is the prohibition against firearm possession 
by those convicted of a misdemeanor violent 
crime against a dating partner—closing the 
‘‘boyfriend loophole.’’ But the senators who 
negotiated this bill evidently couldn’t agree 
on the definition of a dating partner. They 
define ‘‘dating relationship’’ as a ‘‘relation-
ship between individuals who have or have 
recently had a continuing serious relation-
ship of a romantic or intimate nature.’’ But 
relationships come in all forms, and this def-
inition provides little guidance. The senators 
provided three criteria for consideration: (1) 
the length of the relationship, (2) the nature 
of the relationship and (3) the frequency and 
type of interaction between the people in-
volved in the relationship. This means that a 
‘‘continuing serious relationship’’ will be 
some function of quantity of dates, length of 
time and physical intimacy. But these vague 
factors don’t provide fair notice and are sus-
ceptible to inconsistent application. 
By failing to define ‘‘dating relationship’’ 
adequately, Congress is effectively dele-
gating the critical question of who falls 
within this ban. To whom it is delegating the 
hard details remains to be determined. Per-
haps it will be the Bureau of Alcohol, To-
bacco, Firearms and Explosives, which has 
regulatory authority over firearms. Or the 
courts may decide as they resolve cases. Ei-
ther way, Congress has yet again handed off 
its responsibility for defining crimes to 
unelected bureaucrats and judges. 
Until a specific definition exists, it is un-
clear how the federal government will imple-
ment this prohibition. Suppose a criminal- 
records check indicates that a potential pur-
chaser has committed assault or battery.

that the defendant was in a relationship with 
the complaining witness. Or maybe it won’t.

Mr. LEE. I yield the floor. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
KAINE). The Senator from Texas. 
Mr. CRUZ. Mr. President, I rise today 
to discuss the pending business on the 
floor. 
The Presiding Officer and I both ar-
rived in the Senate at the same time 10 
years ago. When you and I had barely 
been here a few days, the country was 
shocked with a tragic shooting, the 
Sandy Hook shooting in Newtown, CT, 
when a deranged monster came in and 
murdered little children—elementary 
school children. Everyone across the 
country was horrified; and over the 
past decade, we have seen that pattern 
repeat itself over and over again. 
Tragically, my home State of Texas 
has seen more than our fair share of 
horrific crime, of mass murder, most 
recently in Uvalde. I was there in 
Uvalde the day after the shooting 
where a deranged monster murdered 19 
little children and 2 teachers. 
Before that, I was in Santa Fe where 
yet another deranged monster mur-
dered schoolchildren. 
I was in Sutherland Springs, the 
worst church shooting in U.S. history. 
I stood in that sanctuary the day after 
the shooting, a beautiful, small coun-
try church. The pews had been flung 
aside in the chaos. There was shattered 
glass. There was a cell phone with a 
shattered screen covered in blood. 
And I saw the pool of blood where an 
18-month-old child was systematically 
murdered by that psychopath. I was in 
El Paso; I was in Midland-Odessa; I was 
in Dallas. Over and over again, we have 
seen the face of evil. We have seen hor-
rific crimes. And let me be the first to 
say there are too damn many of these. 
And we need to stop them. 
Unfortunately, I have also seen what 
inevitably 
follows 
these 
horrific 
crimes, which is a political debate that 
breaks out within seconds of the crime 
occurring. 
There are two principal approaches 
one can take to try to prevent crimes 
like this. One is to target the bad guys, 
to focus on criminals, to focus on fel-
ons, to focus on fugitives, to focus on 
those trying to illegally buy guns, to 
put them in jail, to lock them up, to 
get them off the street so that they 
cannot terrorize and murder innocent 
people. That is the approach that actu-
ally works. That is the approach that 
is actually successful. That is the ap-
proach that is most likely to prevent 
subsequent mass murders. 
There is a second approach, which is 
an approach that is disarming law- 
abiding 
citizens. 
Inevitably, 
Demo-
cratic members of this Chamber, min-
utes after an attack, move towards 
wanting to disarm law-abiding citizens. 
That approach is, I believe, No. 1, un-
constitutional; but, No. 2, it doesn’t 
work. It is ineffective. 
Put simply, taking guns away from 
law-abiding citizens—disarming you or 
disarming me—is not going to stop a 
mass murder. And we know this. If you 
look across the country consistently, 
the jurisdictions with the strictest gun 
control laws over and over again have 
among the highest crime rates and 
among the highest murder rates. 
When you disarm law-abiding citi-
zens, what happens is the people who 
follow the law disarm. That is almost 
by definition if they are law-abiding 
citizens. But the criminals don’t follow 
the laws. 
And if you disarm all the victims, the 
result is it is easier for the criminals to 
commit their acts of mayhem. 
Let me point out a statistic that 
many Americans don’t know. It is a 
statistic that comes from the Barack 
Obama White House, so it is hardly a 
rightwing source. According to the 
Barack Obama White House, every year 
in America, firearms are used defen-
sively to stop a crime between 500,000 
and 1 million times each and every 
year. 
What does that mean? That means 
that if Democratic proposals to disarm 
law-abiding citizens succeed, the result 
will be even more crimes. The result 
will be those 500,000 to a million crimes 
that are right now stopped every year 
won’t be stopped. 
That means more assaults. That 
means more sexual assaults. That 
means more murders. That means sin-
gle moms riding home on the train, if 
they are not able to have a revolver in 
their purse to defend themselves from 
marauding criminals, then they are 
left defenseless. 
In debates over how to approach vio-
lent crime, that 500,000 to a million 
people each year who are using a fire-
arm to stop a crime, they get left out 
of a lot of these discussions. But they 
would be victims if Democratic Sen-
ators succeed in taking away their 
right to keep and bear arms. 
When the Presiding Officer and I 
were brand new here in the wake of 
Newtown, CT, there was a Democrat 
majority in this body at the time. 
Harry Reid was the majority leader. 
Barack Obama had just been reelected 
President. And you will recall well 
Senate Democrats were exultant. Sen-
ator SCHUMER was on TV saying we 
were in the sweet spot to finally pass 
far-reaching gun control. 
And I will tell you the colleagues on 
my side of the aisle were discouraged 
and demoralized, and many thought 
there was nothing we could do to stop 
the agenda that was being pushed for-
ward. 
Well, I can tell you, I didn’t believe it 
then, and I don’t believe it now. And so 
I sat down and drafted legislation de-
signed to actually do what every per-
son in this Chamber, I believe, really 
wants to do, which is stop violent 
crime, stop these murders, stop the 
next lunatic who would shoot up a 
school or shoot up a church or shoot up 
a mall or shoot up a grocery store. 
The legislation I drafted was called 
Grassley-Cruz. I teamed up with my 
colleague, the senior Senator from 
Iowa, CHUCK GRASSLEY. Grassley-Cruz 
focused on several things. First of all,

it focused on strengthening the back-
ground check system. It required the 
Department of Justice to conduct an 
audit of every Federal agency to make 
sure that any felony convictions are re-
ported to the background check sys-
tem. 
It provided funding and incentives for 
States to report felony convictions to 
the background check system. Inter-
estingly, many States have a lousy 
record of reporting felonies to the 
background check database. Ironically, 
many of those are blue States led by 
Democrats who talk about gun control, 
and yet the State governments and 
local governments often fail to report 
felony convictions to the database. 
Grassley-Cruz provided strong incen-
tives to get those felony convictions in 
the database. Secondly, Grassley-Cruz 
provided funding for prosecutors to 
prosecute those who commit violent 
crimes with firearms and put them in 
jail. 
Third, Grassley-Cruz provided fund-
ing for the Department of Justice to 
create a gun crime task force to pros-
ecute felons and fugitives who try to il-
legally buy guns. 
Many people don’t know this, but it 
is actually quite shocking. The Depart-
ment of Justice has a consistent pat-
tern of refusing to prosecute felons and 
fugitives who illegally try to buy guns. 
In the year 2010, roughly 48,000 felons 
and fugitives tried to illegally pur-
chase firearms. Of those 48,000, the 
Obama Justice Department prosecuted 
44 of them—not even 50—44 out of 
48,000. I think that is completely unac-
ceptable. 
So Grassley-Cruz provided funding 
and directed the Department of Jus-
tice: Prosecute them and put them in 
jail. And on top of that, Grassley-Cruz 
created grants for schools to enhance 
school safety, to enhance security, to 
make our schools and make our kids 
safer. 
So what happened? Well, Grassley- 
Cruz, we voted on it here on the floor 
of the Senate. And Grassley-Cruz re-
ceived a majority vote on the Senate 
floor, 52 Senators voted in favor of 
Grassley-Cruz, including nine Demo-
crats. Remember, this was a Democrat 
Senate. Democrats had a sizable major-
ity, and yet nine Democrats—we got 
the most bipartisan support of any of 
the comprehensive legislation that was 
considered on the floor. 
So why didn’t Grassley-Cruz pass 
into law? We got a majority vote in the 
Senate. Well, the answer is simple: 
Grassley-Cruz didn’t pass because Sen-
ate Democrats filibustered it. They de-
manded 60 votes; and so even though it 
got a majority, it didn’t get 60, and it 
didn’t pass. 
I am going to share something that is 
deeply frustrating. 
There is a powerful argument that 
had Grassley-Cruz passed, had Senate 
Democrats not filibustered it, that 
multiple of these mass shootings in 
Texas could have been prevented. 
Let’s start with Sutherland Springs. 
Sutherland Springs should never have 
happened. The shooter was doubly in-
eligible to buy a firearm. He had a fel-
ony conviction. He had a domestic con-
viction. So under Federal law, existing 
Federal law, it was illegal for him to 
buy a gun. 
So how did he get his gun? 
Well, the Air Force, in the Obama ad-
ministration, failed to report his felony 
conviction to the background check 
database. It wasn’t in there. 
So the shooter went to buy a gun. He 
filled out the background check form, 
and he lied. He lied on the form. The 
form asked: Do you have a felony con-
viction? He said: No. 
The form asked: Do you have a do-
mestic violence conviction? He said: 
No. 
They ran the check, and it came up 
clean because the Obama Air Force 
never reported the felony and so it 
wasn’t in the database and so it came 
up clean. 
He bought that gun, and he used it to 
murder those innocent people in that 
beautiful sanctuary. 
If Grassley-Cruz had passed, presum-
ably, the mandated Department of Jus-
tice audit of every Federal Agency 
would have caught that felony convic-
tion. The whole purpose of the audit 
was to make sure we catch every fel-
ony conviction that is out there, which 
would have meant his conviction would 
have been in the database, but that is 
where the second part of Grassley-Cruz 
matters because when he went in and 
lied on that form, he committed two 
more felonies. When he checked ‘‘I 
don’t have a felony conviction,’’ that is 
the felony. Lying on that form is a fel-
ony. It is a crime. 
When he checked ‘‘I don’t have a do-
mestic violence conviction,’’ that is 
the felony. And Grassley-Cruz would 
have directed the Department of Jus-
tice: Prosecute him, and put him in 
jail. And that monster would have been 
locked in a 6-by-8 concrete cell instead 
of murdering innocent people in the 
wonderful community of Sutherland 
Springs. 
You also look at Santa Fe and 
Uvalde, and there is a possibility that 
both of those crimes could have been 
prevented by Grassley-Cruz. 
Part of Grassley-Cruz was funding to 
enhance school security—grants to go 
to schools. One of the things that is 
frustrating about these school shoot-
ings is they follow predictable pat-
terns. 
In Parkland, FL, the shooter jumped 
over a fence and came inside. In Santa 
Fe, the shooter went in an unlocked 
side entrance. 
Afterward—you know, the Santa Fe 
High School is less than an hour from 
my house. I was at home that morning, 
the morning of the shooting. I was on 
that campus about an hour after the 
shooting occurred. It was horrific. It 
was tragic. I grieved and cried with the 
parents who lost their children that 
day. 
I remember sitting down afterward at 
a roundtable with the parents from 
Santa Fe and parents from other mass 
shootings that occurred and talking 
about what are the solutions we can do. 
How can we prevent this? 
One of the solutions we discussed was 
best practices. How do you make a 
school safer? One of those best prac-
tices is limiting the number of en-
trances to a school—ideally, bringing it 
down to one single main entrance, the 
front entrance. 
Now, that doesn’t mean, as some on 
the Twittersphere have said, that you 
have no fire exits. Of course, you have 
fire exits. It means you do what we do 
in many other places—in Federal build-
ings, in banks, in courthouses. It is a 
standard security step to have one 
major entrance to a building if that 
building is at risk of violence, and that 
one main entrance is then much, much 
safer if you have armed police officers 
at that entrance. 
When you go into a bank, there is a 
reason you see an armed officer at the 
entrance. When you go into a court-
house, there is a reason you see an 
armed officer at the entrance. When 
you go into the U.S. Capitol, there is a 
reason you see an armed officer at the 
entrance. Our kids are at least as valu-
able. 
If the Santa Fe High School or the 
Robb Elementary School had been able 
to get a school funding grant to en-
hance security, those crimes could 
have been prevented because, I will tell 
you, when I was in Uvalde the day after 
the shooting, what was so infuriating 
is that monster got in the exact same 
way—through an open back door. Just 
like in Santa Fe, he got in through an 
open back door; he got into the class-
room; and he began murdering children 
long before he encountered anyone 
from law enforcement. 
If, 
instead, 
that 
door 
had 
been 
locked, if he had been forced to come 
around to the front main entrance, if 
at the front main entrance there were 
armed police officers, they could have 
shot that monster dead outside, and 19 
children and 2 teachers would still be 
alive. 
So, like millions across this country, 
I am angry. I am angry that these hor-
rific crimes keep happening. 
But I am also angry that this august 
Chamber plays political games. The 
bill that is before this body is being 
heralded in the press as a bipartisan 
bill because it has got every Democrat 
and some Republicans. 
I think the chances that this bill will 
do anything meaningful to actually 
prevent the next mass murder are very 
low. That is not what this bill is de-
signed to do. 
This bill is designed, among other 
things, to satiate the urge to do some-
thing. After every one of these, the call 
comes out: Do something. I agree. Do 
something. But do something that 
works. Do something that will stop 
these crimes. This bill ain’t that. 
But it does have provisions that are 
troubling. It does have provisions that

satisfy the Democratic political pri-
ority to go after the Second Amend-
ment right to keep and bear arms of 
law-abiding citizens. 
Most troubling in this bill is the 
funding of so-called red flag laws. Now, 
these so-called red flag laws have been 
implemented in multiple States, and 
they enable the State to take away the 
right to keep and bear arms from law- 
abiding citizens. 
They render you vulnerable; that if 
you have a disgruntled coworker, if 
you have an angry ex-boyfriend, an 
angry ex-girlfriend, they can go and 
give the State the power to strip you of 
the right to keep and bear arms—not if 
you are a criminal, not if you have 
committed crimes, not if you have been 
adjudicated to be a danger to yourself 
or others. All of those are existing law. 
Red flag laws lower the threshold and 
make it easier to take away your right 
to defend yourself. 
And in too many of these States, 
these provisions have little to no pro-
tections of due process. 
If the Senate passes this bill, Federal 
dollars will be used to encourage more 
States to enact laws like this. That 
means Federal tax dollars will be used 
to implement programs that will strip 
away Americans’ constitutional rights. 
And mark my words, people will lose 
their lives over this; that we will see 
red flag laws that are abused and citi-
zens who are disarmed—and, tragically, 
we are going to see a citizen who is dis-
armed who is subsequently murdered. 
Look, the right to keep and bear 
arms—it is not about hunting. It is not 
about skeet shooting. Those can be a 
lot of fun to do, but that is not why it 
is in the Constitution. The Bill of 
Rights does not have an amendment 
devoted to recreational shooting. 
The reason the Second Amendment is 
in the Bill of Rights is because you and 
I and every American have a God-given 
right to defend our life. There is no 
right more fundamental than the right 
to defend your own life and the right to 
defend your family. If a criminal comes 
into your house at night seeking to do 
harm to your children, you and I have 
a right, I believe that derives from God 
Almighty, to defend our kids, and 
whether any individual Member of this 
Chamber agrees with that right or not 
doesn’t really matter because it is 
right there in the Bill of Rights. So the 
Constitution protects it whether you 
agree with it or not. 
And the reason I say these red flag 
laws, we are going to see people lose 
their lives over it, is because often 
when people go and buy a firearm, it is 
because they are afraid. It is because 
maybe they have got an angry ex-boy-
friend, an angry ex-girlfriend. Maybe 
they have got a neighbor whom they 
are scared of. Maybe they have got 
someone threatening them. And we are 
going to see these laws abused to dis-
arm someone who is subsequently 
made the victim of a violent crime. 
And none of the politicians in this 
Chamber who vote for this bill will 
take any responsibility for the people’s 
lives that will be lost because of it. 
You might say: Well, look, that is all 
fine and good, but if you don’t like this 
bill, what should we do? 
Well, it so happens I have an answer 
to that. This week, I filed legislation, 
along with Senator JOHN
BARRASSO 
from Wyoming. The Cruz-Barrasso leg-
islation builds on what already re-
ceived a majority vote in this Cham-
ber, the Grassley-Cruz legislation of a 
decade ago. 
Let me tell you what Cruz-Barrasso 
does. It focuses on actually stopping 
this problem. So Cruz-Barrasso funds 
the Department of Justice to prosecute 
violent criminals who use firearms. 
Mr. President, you are from the Com-
monwealth of Virginia, a wonderful 
State. As you know well, some of the 
most important work stopping violent 
crime and gun crime was pioneered in 
the Commonwealth of Virginia. During 
the Bill Clinton Presidency, an initia-
tive was started called Project Exile in 
the Western District of Virginia. The 
U.S. attorney there laid out a policy 
that if anyone commits a crime with a 
firearm who is illegally possessing that 
firearm, meaning likely they are a 
felon in possession, that the Feds were 
going to prosecute them, put them in 
jail, and they are going to face manda-
tory minimum crimes. 
And the U.S. attorney passed out to 
local prosecutors laminated cards say-
ing: Here are all the Federal prohibi-
tions on gun possession. They put up 
ads. They put up billboards in Rich-
mond, VA. Richmond tragically had an 
incredibly high murder rate. They put 
up billboards: Carry a gun, do hard 
time. 
And Project Exile worked phenome-
nally. The murder rate in Richmond, 
VA, plummeted, and we began hearing 
stories of criminals—criminals who 
would come to knock off a liquor store, 
criminals who would come to do a 
home burglary, who would leave their 
gun at home. They would say: Do you 
know what? Look, if I break into this 
house and I have got a gun with me, I 
am doing hard time in Federal prison. 
I think I will just go there without a 
gun. It worked. 
What does Cruz-Barrasso do? It takes 
Project Exile national. It provides 
funding for U.S. attorneys to pros-
ecute. If you commit a crime and you 
have got a gun, you are off the streets. 
You want to stop these crimes? That 
is the step that will stop these crimes. 
What else does Cruz-Barrasso do? It 
creates a gun crime task force at the 
Department of Justice to prosecute the 
felons and fugitives year after year 
after year who try to illegally buy a 
gun and whom DOJ won’t prosecute 
right now. 
If Cruz-Barrasso passes, the next 
Sutherland Springs can be stopped. 
You know, there are some Democrat 
officials who say: We don’t have time 
to prosecute people who try to illegally 
buy guns. I repeatedly heard testimony 
from Democratic witnesses on the Ju-
diciary Committee saying that. 
Let me tell you something right now. 
If a murderer or a felon is trying to il-
legally buy a gun, I don’t think that is 
a paperwork offense; I think they 
should be prosecuted and put in jail. 
What else does Cruz-Barrasso do? It 
provides major funding to make our 
schools safer. It provides much more 
funding than the Democrats’ bill. All 
told, there is $36 billion in this bill. 
It provides funding to double the 
number of police officers in schools 
across America—to double them. If you 
want to keep kids safe, the single best 
step you can do is have police officers 
on campus so that our children have 
the same protection that Members of 
Congress do; so that our children have 
the same protection that courthouses 
do; so that our children have the same 
protection that banks do. 
Cruz-Barrasso will double the number 
of police officers in schools across 
America—not only that, let’s talk 
mental health. We all know there is a 
problem. These deranged shooters over 
and over again follow similar patterns 
of being isolated, angry loners with a 
long pattern of struggling with mental 
health, often making multiple threats 
before they carry out a horrific crime. 
Cruz-Barrasso provides $10 billion in 
funding for mental health counselors in 
schools across the country to help 
identify troubled youth and to stop 
them before they commit a crime like 
this. 
(Mr. OSSOFF assumed the Chair.) 
Now, earlier today, there had been 
discussion that Majority Leader SCHU-
MER would schedule a vote on Cruz- 
Barrasso. Right now, it appears that 
may not happen. We are going to vote 
one way or another, and if I have to ex-
ercise the procedural avenues available 
to me as a Senator to force that vote, 
I am more than happy to do so. But let 
me tell you actually why we are not 
seeing the vote so far—because my 
amendment is drafted as a substitute. 
In other words, it would replace the 
pending bill on the floor, and an awful 
lot of Senators don’t want to have to 
vote on that. 
Now, I challenge any Senator in this 
Chamber to try to make the case that 
this Democrat bill on the floor would 
be even half as effective in stopping 
violent crime, in stopping mass shoot-
ings, in stopping criminals from mur-
dering children in schools, as my legis-
lation would be. The Democrat bill has 
a fraction of the funding for police offi-
cers. It has a fraction of the funding for 
mental health. The Democrat bill 
doesn’t provide that violent felons who 
use guns should be prosecuted. The 
Democrat bill doesn’t provide that peo-
ple who illegally try to buy firearms, 
who are felons and fugitives, should be 
prosecuted. The Democrat bill is not 
focused on criminals. It is not focused 
on bad guys. It is focused on the Demo-
crat priority of disarming law-abiding 
citizens. That is a political priority 
that too many Senate Democrats value 
more than keeping kids safe. 
So if we don’t see a straight-up vote 
on my amendment, it is because too

June 23, 2022 
many Senators in this Chamber don’t 
want to vote on a head-to-head choice 
between actually keeping kids safe 
versus achieving the political agenda 
of the left of disarming law-abiding 
citizens. That is wrong. It is cynical. 
I have to say that in these debates— 
listen, this is a topic that is emotional. 
It is a topic that is personal. It is a 
topic where inevitably the rhetoric 
gets overheated. It gets overheated on 
both sides. 
Some years ago, I found myself, curi-
ously enough, in a Twitter debate with 
Alyssa Milano, the actress from Holly-
wood, the leftwing activist, over the 
question of guns. We began going back 
and forth over gun control and the Sec-
ond Amendment, and at some point, 
she said something to the effect of, you 
wouldn’t dare sit down and have this 
conversation with me in person. I said: 
Of course I would. I invited her to come 
to my office, and she did. She came to 
my office, and what proceeded is we 
had a 90-minute discussion and debate 
about violent crime, about gun control, 
and about the Second Amendment. We 
live-streamed it, so anyone who wants 
to see it can go and watch a 90-minute 
discussion. I will say, I commend Ms. 
Milano. I think the two of us managed 
to have a much more civil conversation 
on this than most of the interlocutors 
on this topic. 
One of the things I said to her at the 
start of that discussion was, I said: Lis-
ten, if we start from the premise—if we 
sit in this room and look at each other 
and we both assume the other is evil, 
the other is lying, the other seeks to do 
harm, we are not going to have a very 
productive conversation. If each of us 
thinks of the other ‘‘You want children 
to die; you want people to be mur-
dered,’’ you know what, that is not 
going to lead to a very productive con-
versation. 
I suggested to her—I said: Why don’t 
we start from the proposition that you 
and I both would like to see innocent 
people protected and safe; that you and 
I both, like anyone sane and rational, 
are utterly horrified at the depraved 
monsters who murder innocent people 
and especially those who murder chil-
dren? 
There is a special circle of Hell for 
the people who hurt kids. 
If we start from the premise that 
even though we are of different polit-
ical parties and even though we may 
believe different things politically, we 
both want to see human life preserved, 
then maybe we can have a productive 
discussion about what steps can be 
taken to be most effective in saving 
human life. 
We agreed that we both want to pre-
vent future murders, that we both want 
to protect our kids and your kids and 
kids across America. Then we can have 
a real discussion that is factual, that is 
empirical, that is based on evidence, 
that is based on data, as to what poli-
cies are actually effective in stopping 
violent crime. 
There was a time when this august 
Chamber had discussions like that, had 
debates. 
I would note, this particular bill— 
there have been no committee hearings 
on it. There has been no meaningful de-
bate. This is an exercise of partisan 
power and political objectives. 
So we are not engaged in a meaning-
ful discussion of what policies are actu-
ally effective in stopping crime, pre-
venting mass murder, and protecting 
children. If we were, I would challenge 
any Democrat in the Chamber to stand 
up and explain how on Earth this Dem-
ocrat bill could be even half as effec-
tive in preventing school shootings as 
the Cruz-Barrasso bill. By any meas-
ure, the legislation that I am fighting 
for is stronger, it will put more violent 
gun criminals in jail, and it will double 
the number of police officers in schools 
across America. It will make our chil-
dren safer. 
If we were willing to have a discus-
sion about substance, about the merits, 
that should be a pretty easy discussion, 
but, sadly, too many in this body im-
mediately play politics and also give in 
to the overheated rhetoric on this 
issue. 
Those who advocate gun control in-
evitably say: If you support the Second 
Amendment, blood is on your hands. 
Well, let me tell you something: If 
you oppose the Second Amendment and 
you disarm people who become victims 
of violent crime, blood is on your 
hands. 
Rather than either of us saying lan-
guage like that, it seems to me we 
should come together and say: How do 
we stop the bad guys? What works? 
What is effective? What can we do to-
gether to make sure to maximize the 
chances 
that 
we 
prevent 
another 
Uvalde, another Santa Fe, another 
Sutherland Springs, another El Paso, 
another Midland-Odessa, another Dal-
las? 
The stakes are too serious for polit-
ical games. 
The Presiding Officer wasn’t serving 
in this body 10 years ago when we voted 
on Grassley-Cruz, but at the time, nine 
Democrats voted for it. It received the 
most bipartisan support of any of the 
comprehensive legislation before this 
body. It got a majority vote in the 
Harry Reid Democrat Senate, where 
the Democrats had a substantial ma-
jority. 
I would urge you, Mr. President, and 
every other Democrat to demonstrate 
the same principle and the same cour-
age that those nine Democrats did a 
decade ago. 
Let’s vote for legislation that will ac-
tually solve the problem, that will ac-
tually stop violent criminals, and that 
will actually keep our kids safe. Let’s 
resist the political urge to try to at-
tack 
and 
undermine 
the 
Second 
Amendment, to try to disarm law-abid-
ing citizens. 
I can tell you, as long as I am serving 
in this body, I will fight with every 
breath I can to defend the constitu-
tional right to keep and bear arms of 
every American. It is in the Bill of 
Rights. It is a foundational right. 
We can do both. We can stop crimi-
nals and protect the Second Amend-
ment. This bill on the floor, the Demo-
crat bill, does not. So I urge my col-
leagues on both sides of the aisle to 
pass Cruz-Barrasso and abandon the 
Democrat legislation that doesn’t stop 
violent crime but does infringe on the 
Second Amendment. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Maine. 
Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise 
today in strong support of the Bipar-
tisan Safer Communities Act. 
Once again, our Nation has been hor-
rified by mass shootings, this time of 
shoppers killed in Buffalo, NY, and of 
schoolchildren and teachers murdered 
in Texas. 
Twelve of us have come together to 
develop the bipartisan proposal before 
us to help address the gun violence 
that is plaguing our country. We were 
led by Senators CHRIS MURPHY, JOHN 
CORNYN, KYRSTEN SINEMA, and THOM 
TILLIS. I want to thank and recognize 
each of them for their efforts. 
Our 
commonsense 
plan 
increases 
needed mental health resources, im-
proves school safety and support for 
students, and helps ensure that dan-
gerous criminals and those who are ad-
judicated as suffering from mental ill-
ness cannot purchase firearms. If en-
acted, our bill will save lives. At the 
same time, it steadfastly protects the 
Second Amendment rights of law-abid-
ing gun owners. It is not hyperbole to 
say that this legislation represents the 
most significant gun safety legislation 
in decades. 
I would like to highlight two specific 
provisions of this bill that I worked on 
and that will have a significant impact 
in Maine and across the country. 
First, our bill will fund crisis inter-
vention programs, like Maine’s yellow 
flag law, which our State supreme 
court just upheld as constitutional this 
very week. 
Maine’s law, which has robust due- 
process protections, allows the court— 
following an assessment by a medical 
professional—to determine if individ-
uals should temporarily lose possession 
of firearms because they pose a serious 
threat to themselves or to others. 
Maine’s law was developed in consulta-
tion with the Sportsman Alliance of 
Maine, and it has likely saved lives. 
This Federal legislation will provide 
Maine with more resources to fully im-
plement this important program. It 
will help connect law enforcement, 
medical professionals, and people in 
crisis through telehealth services, as 
well as provide additional financial 
help to ensure that the law can be effi-
ciently and effectively utilized when 
necessary. 
Second, our bill will also help keep 
guns out of the hands of dangerous 
criminals. The bipartisan package in-
cludes the Stop Illegal Trafficking and

June 23, 2022 
Firearms Act that I coauthored with 
Senator PATRICK
LEAHY. It cracks 
down on straw purchasing and firearms 
trafficking. 
I would like, particularly, to thank 
Senator HEINRICH, with whom I worked 
to further refine this proposal so that 
it could be included in this bipartisan 
package. Senator HEINRICH was a won-
derful partner as we worked through 
all of the details of this provision. 
The trafficking of firearms to violent 
criminals, gangs, and drug trafficking 
groups presents a serious threat to 
public safety in communities across 
America. Straw purchasers—individ-
uals who purchase guns for other peo-
ple who are prohibited by law from re-
ceiving such weapons—are the linchpin 
of most firearms trafficking oper-
ations, which are responsible for fun-
neling firearms into our cities and 
across our southern border. 
Currently, there is no criminal stat-
ute specifically prohibiting straw pur-
chasing or firearms trafficking in the 
way that we need it to do. Instead, 
prosecutors rely primarily on paper-
work violations that prohibit making 
false statements in connection with 
the purchase of a firearm. 
Our bill establishes new, specific 
criminal offenses with significant pen-
alties for straw purchasers and fire-
arms traffickers, along with enhanced 
penalties when straw-purchased fire-
arms are used in connection with seri-
ous criminal activity like terrorism or 
drug trafficking. 
The danger presented by straw pur-
chasers and firearms trafficking is not 
abstract. It is not theoretical. It is 
very real—a real and present danger. 
Maine’s 
U.S. 
attorney, 
Darcie 
McElwee, recently described how gun 
and drug trafficking in our State and 
elsewhere are often intertwined. ‘‘Indi-
viduals would come to Maine for guns 
and leave us their drugs and go back,’’ 
she explained. She added that in recent 
years, guns acquired in Maine rep-
resented ‘‘7% of Massachusetts gun re-
coveries at crime scenes,’’ while Massa-
chusetts guns ‘‘were responsible for 
20% of ours. So, that means that both 
their guns and their drugs are coming 
into our state.’’ I am quoting our new 
U.S. attorney. 
In a recent example of gun and drug 
trafficking along the I–95 pipeline, a 
Massachusetts man was sentenced to 7 
years in prison after receiving two pis-
tols 
from 
a 
straw 
purchaser 
in 
Androscoggin 
County, 
while 
facili-
tating fentanyl sales in Bangor. What 
we have seen are gang members from 
Connecticut coming to Maine with her-
oin and swapping heroin for guns. 
Gun trafficking is also a border secu-
rity issue. Law enforcement has long 
been concerned about the flow of fire-
arms from the United States into Mex-
ico. 
According to a recent report, more 
than 70 percent of all crime guns recov-
ered and traced to Mexico between 2009 
and 2014—and that represents more 
than 73,000 firearms—were traced back 
to the United States. And the Mexican 
Government has estimated that 200,000 
firearms are smuggled from the United 
States into Mexico each year. 
Our bill provides additional tools to 
law enforcement and prosecutors to 
prevent and prosecute these crimes. 
This is meaningful legislation that re-
flects input from gun safety advocates, 
gun rights groups, the U.S. Department 
of Justice, law enforcement officers, 
and others. Thus, in addition to help-
ing keep our schools safe and our com-
munities safer, this bill will help to ad-
dress the gun violence and drug prob-
lems that are plaguing our commu-
nities, more generally. 
Mr. President, I come from a State 
with a strong heritage of responsible 
gun ownership. This package reflects 
conversations that I have had with the 
Sportsman’s Alliance of Maine, the Na-
tional Shooting Sports Foundation, 
and other responsible groups. It is 
worth my emphasizing one more time 
that we are able to make these signifi-
cant improvements without infringing 
on the rights of law-abiding gun own-
ers. 
Finally, it is important to note that 
this package demonstrates that Mem-
bers of the Senate can come together 
and work in a constructive way to get 
important goals achieved on behalf of 
the American people. I urge my Senate 
colleagues to join me in supporting 
this bill. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to 
call the roll. 
Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I 
come to the floor tonight sharing the 
concerns of every Member of this body, 
to find the best way to protect children 
who go to school, so that children can 
go to school in safety and parents can 
send their children to school feeling 
that the children will be safe. 
And after we have seen the tragedies 
across the country, I think every Mem-
ber is here trying to find the best solu-
tion, and I think that the one that Sen-
ator CRUZ and I have offered is one that 
will provide the kind of safety and se-
curity for our kids, for our schools, and 
for our communities; and that is why 
we have introduced this substitute 
amendment that we are bringing to the 
floor this evening in an effort to do 
just that. We bring this at a time when 
the Nation’s attention is focused on 
what has happened at schools and com-
munities across the country and how 
to best address it. 
And as a physician, a doctor who 
served in a State legislature and now 
in this body, I have seen the dev-
astating impact of mental health chal-
lenges and problems in families and 
how much that has contributed to what 
we have seen with these terrible acts. 
So what we bring here tonight is legis-
lation focused on safe schools and men-
tal health while protecting the Second 
Amendment rights of law-abiding citi-
zens. 
And, with that, I would turn to Sen-
ator CRUZ to make a motion to that ef-
fect. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Texas. 
Mr. CRUZ. Mr. President, this body 
has a choice before it: Do we pass legis-
lation that will be ineffective in stop-
ping violent crime, that has very little 
prospect of preventing the next mass 
shooting, that will do very little to 
make schools safer but, at the same 
time, 
will 
undermine 
the 
Second 
Amendment rights of law-abiding citi-
zens? That is the Democrat bill that is 
currently on the floor. 
Or do we, instead, move to pass real 
legislation that will stop violent crime, 
that will put gun criminals in jail, that 
will prosecute felons and fugitives who 
try to illegally buy guns, and that will 
provide serious funding for school safe-
ty? 
The Cruz-Barrasso legislation pro-
vides funding to double the number of 
police officers in schools across Amer-
ica so our kids can be kept safe—$36 
billion total in funding, repurposed 
from unspent Democrat emergency 
funds. This bill also provides $10 billion 
in funding for mental health counselors 
in schools to stop troubled teens before 
they go down a horrible road. 
The Democrat bill has much smaller 
funding for cops and schools, much 
smaller funding for mental health, but 
much more infringement of the Second 
Amendment rights of law-abiding citi-
zens. 
So it is a choice all of us have: Do we 
want to stop these crimes, or do we 
want to play politics? 
And I would note, Mr. President, that 
the proponents of this bill at the outset 
swore up and down: There will be 
amendments. We will have amend-
ments on this bill. 
Well, right now, the majority leader 
wants no amendments. And how do we 
know that? Because the majority lead-
er has filled the amendment tree, has 
blocked amendments. 
This morning, the majority leader 
was saying that he would allow a vote 
on Cruz-Barrasso, a straight-up vote. 
But, for whatever reason, that has 
changed; and so, right now, amend-
ments are blocked. But, fortunately, it 
is the right of any Senator to move to 
table that blocking amendment, and 
that is what I will do momentarily. 
And the reason I am moving to table 
this blocking amendment is to take up 
Cruz-Barrasso. 
And so this vote is a straight-up vote: 
Do you support serious law enforce-
ment? Do you support prosecuting vio-
lent criminals who use guns in their 
crimes? Do you support prosecuting 
and sending to jail felons and fugitives 
and those with serious mental illness 
who try to illegally buy firearms? And 
do you support getting serious about

protecting our schools? Do you support 
doubling the number of cops in our 
schools so that our kids are safe? Do 
you support funding mental health 
counselors so our kids are safe? 
This is an opportunity for every Sen-
ator to decide if they support doing 
something that actually fixes the prob-
lem or if they put a higher priority on 
partisan politics. On the merits, this 
vote should be 100 to 0. We will see 
what the vote is in reality. 
MOTION TO TABLE 
Mr. President, accordingly, I move to 
table amendment No. 5100, and I ask

KEEP KIDS FED ACT OF 2022 
Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous 
consent 
that 
notwith-
standing rule XXII, the Chair lay be-
fore the Senate the message from the 
House of Representatives to accom-
pany S. 2089; that the motion to concur 
in the House amendment to S. 2089 
with amendment No. 5133 be considered 
made and agreed to; the title amend-
ment from the House be considered and 
agreed to; and the motion to reconsider 
be considered made and laid upon the 
table, all without intervening action or 
debate. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
The Presiding Officer laid before the 
Senate the following message from the 
House of Representatives: 
Resolved, That the bill from the Senate (S. 
2089) entitled ‘‘An Act to amend title 38, 
United States Code, to ensure that grants 
provided by the Secretary of Veterans Af-
fairs for State veterans’ cemeteries do not 
restrict States from authorizing the inter-
ment of certain deceased members of the re-
serve components of the Armed Forces in 
such cemeteries, and for other purposes.’’, do 
pass with amendments. 
The motion was agreed to. 
Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I 
want to thank my colleagues for sup-
porting this effort in this legislation 
which we have dubbed ‘‘Keep Kids 
Fed,’’ because that is exactly what we 
are going to be able to do, to help our 
schools and churches and local pro-
viders provide meals for children this 
summer and help for the school year. 
I want to thank my colleague and 
partner—true partner in this—Senator 
BOOZMAN for all of his efforts. 
We know we are getting back to nor-
mal, but we are not there yet, and the 
folks who run our schools and summer 
meal programs need extra support 
through this coming year. And that is 
what we are doing right now. 
So we just passed something fully 
paid for that will ensure that millions 
of children don’t go hungry this sum-
mer and next school year, and I would 
just finally say this: You know, keep-
ing kids fed is nothing new. We have 
been doing this on a bipartisan basis 
since the National School Lunch pro-
gram was established 76 years ago. So 
we are just continuing a bipartisan tra-
dition, and I want to thank colleagues 
for allowing us to be able to move for-
ward on this bill. 
And I would now yield to my friend 
Senator BOOZMAN. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Arkansas. 
Mr. BOOZMAN. Mr. President, I rise 
today for just a moment to discuss the 
Keep Kids Fed Act, which will help 
schools and summer providers operate 
as they return to normal, while facing 
supply chain problems and fighting 
food costs. 
This bill is a result of a bicameral, 
bipartisan 
agreement 
that 
assists 
schools and students as they resume 
regular operations of the meal pro-
grams. 
The waivers to provide higher reim-
bursement rates and universal free 
meals under these programs during 
COVID are no longer necessary. 
However, schools still face unusual 
times with a 35 to 40 percent increase 
in food prices due to inflation and sup-
ply chain difficulties. This bill provides 
targeted and temporary relief for the 
2022–2023 school year to help schools 
with higher food costs and is fully off-
set. 
We all want to ensure that children 
in this country receive healthful and 
affordable meals to help them focus on 
their education. 
This bill will help schools provide 
those meals as they return to normal, 
and I urge my colleagues to support 
the bill. And, again, thank you so 
much, Senator STABENOW, to you and 
your staff, and to my staff and every-
one that has worked so hard to come to 
an agreement. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ma-
jority leader. 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, to-
night, the Senate is passing bipartisan 
legislation that will keep America’s 
schoolkids fed for the summer. 
A hungry child is a horrible thing to 
see, and because of the amazing, per-
sistent work of a great team, a great 
bipartisan team—Senator STABENOW, 
chairman of the Agriculture Com-
mittee and Senator BOOZMAN, ranking 
member 
of 
the 
Agriculture 
Com-
mittee—that won’t happen. 
The worst of the pandemic is hope-
fully behind us, but schools across the 
country are still suffering from the 
challenges that COVID created—supply 
chain issues making it harder to pro-
vide students free meals they need to 
stay healthy over the summer. 
It would have been just awful— 
awful—for the Senate to leave without 
taking action to make sure we pro-
vided the waivers necessary to make 
sure kids can get the free meals they 
need over the summer. 
Kids deserve to be healthy. They de-
serve to be well fed. And by extending 
these nutrition waivers before they ex-
pire, we can make sure that no student 
will have to worry about where they 
are going to get their lunch during the 
summer. 
There is no justification in the world 
for letting these waivers come to an 
end, and the good, persistent, steady 
hard work of Senators Stabenow and 
Boozman made sure that didn’t happen.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S3138 
June 23, 2022 
He then shot his own grandmother 
because she wanted him to go back 
into the classroom rather than drop 
out of school, and then went to the 
Robb Elementary School through an 
unlocked door. 
He then opened fire on two fourth- 
grade classrooms, killing 19 students 
and 2 teachers. 
The American people were shocked, 
outraged, and devastated by this at-
tack and collectively asked: How can 
we prevent this from happening again? 
Well, the discussion surrounding this 
topic causes emotions to run high, and 
I understand why. 
For too long, some politicians have 
tried to pit the right to live in a safe 
community against the constitutional 
right to keep and bear arms. They 
make it seem like our country can only 
have one or the other—either the Sec-
ond Amendment or safe schools and 
churches and grocery stores. And, of 
course, this is a false choice. 
Law-abiding gun owners are not the 
problem. Men and women who buy guns 
to protect themselves and their family 
to hunt or engage in sports—they are 
not a public safety problem. 
Following the shooting, I promised to 
do everything in my power to try to 
answer that call to do something. I 
don’t believe in doing nothing in the 
face of what we saw in Uvalde and we 
have seen in far too many commu-
nities. Doing nothing is an abdication 
of our responsibility as representatives 
of the American people here in the U.S. 
Senate. 
At the same time, I reiterated my 
bottom line, which is: I would not sup-
port any provisions that infringed on 
the rights of law-abiding gun owners. 
Again, they are not the problem. 
But I knew that this effort was about 
the art of the possible; looking at areas 
where we could agree and setting aside 
those areas where we could not. 
I was fortunate to find partners who 
were thoughtful and realistic about 
how we could pass this bill. 
I want to thank Senator MURPHY, 
Senator SINEMA, Senator TILLIS, as 
well as a larger group of Senators with-
out whom this legislation would not be 
on the cusp of passage. Thank you. 
Thank you for not listening to the 
naysayers and the critics and those 
who would spew disinformation and 
outright lies about what we are doing 
here and for standing up to the respon-
sibility that we all have as U.S. Sen-
ators to do our very best to make 
progress, to try to answer the call in 
the face of these tragedies, and try, in 
the end, to save lives, which is what 
this is all about. 
Now, less than 1 month after the 
shooting in Uvalde, the Senate will 
vote soon on the Bipartisan Safer Com-
munities Act. This legislation will pro-
tect our schools, protect our commu-
nities, 
and 
safeguard 
the 
Second 
Amendment rights of law-abiding citi-
zens. 
I have said it before, and I will say it 
again: No parent should ever fear for 
the safety of their child at school, and 
no child should be afraid to go to 
school in fear of their safety. 
This legislation responds to that in a 
positive and affirmative way. This bill 
includes targeted, commonsense meas-
ures to prevent violence and to save 
lives while respecting our Constitution. 
(Ms. BALDWIN assumed the Chair.) 
Madam President, the dirty little se-
cret is America is experiencing a men-
tal health crisis. Our mental health de-
livery system is a scandal. Too many 
people are not getting the sort of at-
tention and care they need in order to 
manage their mental health chal-
lenges. And many of them can be saved 
from the fate of Salvador Ramos or 
Adam Lanza if they can get access to 
timely care and the medication that 
will help them manage their mental 
illness. So this bill will represent the 
single largest investment in commu-
nity-based mental health care in Amer-
ican history. 
That is huge. That is enormously im-
portant. And to me it may be the most 
important aspect of what we do here. 
So police officers answering a 9–1-1 
call from somebody in a mental health 
crisis, they don’t have to take that per-
son to jail where they won’t get help. 
They can take them to a community- 
based mental health delivery system— 
to a clinic. And a person experiencing a 
mental health crisis, they don’t have 
to go to the emergency room. They can 
go to a clinic and get the sort of care 
and help they need in order to manage 
their condition, whatever it may be. 
This bill will also provide support 
and services for our schools. Our 
schools should be sanctuary—a sanc-
tuary—for our children, not a place 
where they plan on what will happen 
during the next shooting and how they 
can hide under their desks or try to 
make their escape. Schools should be a 
sanctuary. And this bill will provide 
the kind of services that will help iden-
tify students in crisis and help inter-
vene to provide them the assistance 
they need. 
This bill also provides major invest-
ments in school safety and security. It 
includes physical safety measures. We 
probably can’t eliminate human error 
like we saw in Uvalde, TX, but we can 
promulgate the best practices, which 
we have done in this bill, from the best 
minds based on evidence—what works 
and what does not—to make sure we 
keep unauthorized visitors out of the 
hallways and the classrooms as well as 
evaluate current protocols and, like I 
said, develop best practices. 
Again, those who say we need to in-
fringe on the rights of law-abiding citi-
zens under the Constitution in order to 
make good policy are offering a false 
choice. Passing good public policy and 
supporting the Constitution are not 
mutually exclusive. 
One of the ways we are providing as-
sistance to the States is through crisis 
intervention grants which will provide 
the States with funding to implement 
programs to help those in crisis and 
prevent them from committing self- 
harm or harm to others. 
We have rejected the idea of a na-
tional red flag law, even though 19 
States and the District of Columbia 
have chosen to do that themselves, and 
one of the ways we can help is to make 
sure that these funds assist State offi-
cials in training them on how to make 
sure that the due process rights of an 
individual 
are 
protected, 
as 
they 
should be. 
This legislation also closes a gaping 
hole in the background check system 
which is the lack of juvenile records. 
This is a real challenge because most 
juvenile records are sealed or ex-
punged. But we know that Salvador 
Ramos, who went in at 18-years-old and 
passed a background check—he was a 
ticking timebomb. Everybody knew he 
was struggling with his mental health 
challenges, and he was slowly circling 
the drain because he didn’t get the help 
that might have prevented his self- 
harm, not to mention the harm to oth-
ers. 
But if a person’s record includes a 
criminal conviction or mental health 
adjudication that prohibits them from 
purchasing a firearm as an adult, it 
shouldn’t matter whether they were 17 
or 18 at the time. That information 
should be available on the National In-
stant Criminal Background Check Sys-
tem, and that is what this bill will en-
courage. 
Our 
bill 
incentivizes 
the 
States to upload this information to 
ensure that disqualifying criminal con-
victions or mental health adjudica-
tions are available. 
Unless a person is convicted of a 
crime or adjudicated as mentally ill, 
their Second Amendment rights will 
not be impacted by this legislation, pe-
riod. 
Let me close by saying, I am grateful 
to Senator MURPHY, who has been a 
good-faith partner. He would like to do 
a lot of things in addition to what we 
have done here, but he was pragmatic 
and realistic enough to know that if we 
were actually going to be successful, 
we weren’t going to be able to do ev-
erything that he wanted. Conversely, 
there were things that we did on our 
side that were outside of our comfort 
zone that, frankly, we are having to ex-
plain to people, but that is what a 
good-faith negotiation looks like. And 
again, I think, on balance, the good we 
are doing here and the potential we 
have to save lives is worth any sort of 
concession we might have had to make 
during the negotiation. 
Let me also express my gratitude to 
Senator SINEMA, the Senator from Ari-
zona, who has been a key partner in the 
negotiation as well as Senator TILLIS, 
the Senator from North Carolina. But 
the truth is, a lot of people were in-
volved in this. And I want to thank all 
of our colleagues who helped us round 
out this legislation and make sure it 
delivers the benefits that we sought. 
We also worked with a variety of 
stakeholders from education to mental 
health groups, to law enforcement, as

well as gun rights groups. And I appre-
ciate everybody who has helped us 
make this product better. And obvi-
ously we don’t agree on a lot of things, 
but I am encouraged about how much 
common ground we were able to find. 
Our bill has earned the endorsement 
of more than 100 mental health and 
education groups, including the Na-
tional Alliance on Mental Illness and 
the National Association of School 
Psychologists. It has received the sup-
port of law enforcement organizations, 
including the Fraternal Order of Po-
lice, the National Sheriffs’ Association, 
the National District Attorneys Asso-
ciation, and the Major Cities Chiefs As-
sociation. It has been backed by domes-
tic violence groups such as the Na-
tional Network to End Domestic Vio-
lence 
and 
the 
National 
Coalition 
Against Domestic Violence. 
I believe we have in the Gallery to-
night people who have suffered un-
thinkable losses of loved ones in some 
of these mass shooting incidents. But I 
want to tell them that their advocacy 
has turned their pain into something 
positive. I believe the best antidote for 
the sort of unthinkable loss that they 
have suffered is the knowledge that 
something good will come out of their 
tragedies, something that will save 
lives. 
This broad support for this legisla-
tion shows that it is a meaningful com-
prehensive response to the tragedies we 
have experienced. And I am proud of 
what we have been able to do together. 
And I am very optimistic about the im-
pact it will have on our schools and 
communities across the country. So, 
thank you, colleagues, for working to-
gether in good faith in a bipartisan 
way. 
I think in one way we have dem-
onstrated to people that our institu-
tions can work. Many have come to 
doubt whether we are capable of mak-
ing our institutions work, including 
the world’s greatest deliberative body, 
the U.S. Senate. And we have proved 
that we can, when sufficiently inspired 
by the people in the Gallery and oth-
ers, when they say do something to 
come 
together 
and 
find 
common 
ground that will help keep our commu-
nities safer, protect our children, and 
save lives. 
I look forward to voting yes and mov-
ing this bill one step closer to the 
President’s desk for signature. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The sen-
ior Senator from Connecticut. 
Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Madam Presi-
dent, I want to thank my colleague and 
friend from Texas as well as the team 
that worked with him—Senators MUR-
PHY, TILLIS, SINEMA, and all of us who 
worked with them. Where he is surely 
right is that we have shown that de-
mocracy works, at least that it can 
work, when people come together seek-
ing common ground and responding to 
the overwhelming sense of urgency 
from the American people about solv-
ing a problem. And that democracy 
working stands in stark juxtaposition 
to the tableau on the other side of Con-
gress, the House Commission that is in-
vestigating the near-overthrow of that 
democracy. So for all who are doubting 
and all who may have doubts in the fu-
ture, we are providing some reassur-
ance that we can get things done and 
solve problems. 
My mind goes back to watching that 
Gallery almost 10 years ago in the 
wake of the Newtown tragedy—the un-
thinkable murder of 20 beautiful chil-
dren and 6 brave educators at Sandy 
Hook Elementary School. And when we 
failed to take action then on a very 
modest 
improving 
the 
background 
check system—we had 55 votes but not 
enough to reach 60—I will never forget 
the cry of ‘‘Shame, shame’’ that came 
from that Gallery. 
I remember the Sandy Hook families 
were in that Gallery, and at least two 
of them are here today, Mark Barden 
and Nicole Hockley. And it is not only 
those families that are in the Gallery, 
it is the movement that those families, 
through their immeasurable grief and 
unthinkable trauma, created in the 
wake of that unimaginable murder. 
That movement is here, comprised of 
survivors and first responders, medical 
professionals, 
educators, 
advocates, 
and so many others. And today when 
the U.S. Senate passes the Bipartisan 
Safer Communities Act, we won’t hear 
cries of ‘‘Shame,’’ there will be cries of 
relief, finally. 
I am proud to have been part of the 
team that negotiated this measure and 
to have worked with colleagues on the 
other side of the aisle like Senator 
CORNYN. This is not the measure I 
fought for. It is not the measure I 
would have written if I had been doing 
it alone, but it marks meaningful 
progress. 
If you wait to get everything in the 
U.S. Senate, chances are you will get 
nothing. Progress is better than noth-
ing. This measure will save lives—not 
all the lives that we want to save, but 
it will save lives, and I will be proud to 
vote for it today. 
After 30 years, hundreds of thousands 
of gun deaths after Sandy Hook and 
dozens of failed legislative proposals, 
we are finally taking this step forward. 
The Sandy Hook victims, the Parkland 
victims, the Uvalde victims, and so 
many more deserve so much better, 
and they deserve more, but the Bipar-
tisan Safer Communities Act is that 
significant step forward that responds 
to the Nation’s sense of urgency to get 
something done. 
One way the legislation will do so 
that I am particularly proud of is in-
vesting in crisis intervention pro-
grams. This bill will increase funding 
for these programs, including red flag 
laws and programs already in place in 
21 jurisdictions like Connecticut, which 
was the first. These laws will keep fire-
arms out of the hands of individuals 
who are dangerous to themselves or 
others. It is separating those guns from 
people who say they are going to kill 
someone or themselves. More than half 
of all gun deaths are suicides. Red flag 
laws are practical and proven and they 
prevent not only suicides but school 
mass 
shootings 
and 
other 
violent 
crimes. Just last week, Connecticut 
probably saved tens of lives by sepa-
rating an individual who told his par-
ents that he was having those thoughts 
again about killing people, and he was 
separated from a firearm. 
I have worked on the red flag issue 
for years with Senator GRAHAM and 
with Senator FEINSTEIN in the bipar-
tisan negotiations that led to this bill. 
We worked collaboratively and closely 
to develop the funding framework that 
can support States that already have 
these laws and States that choose to 
enact these laws going forward. Imple-
mentation is so important, and the re-
sources necessary for implementation 
are key to making them work effec-
tively. In fact, very arguably, the fail-
ure of the New York red flag law to 
prevent the Buffalo massacre was due 
to a lack of resources commitment. 
To alleviate concerns among some of 
my Republican colleagues and some 
gun owners, we reached a bipartisan 
agreement to include provisions that 
specify that, for States to be eligible to 
use funding under red flag programs, 
those programs have to include min-
imum due process protections. These 
protections are consistent with due 
process safeguards provided in the 21 
jurisdictions that already have these 
laws, and several have already been 
upheld in the face of constitutional 
challenges. 
The Constitution already applies to 
these laws. The due process guarantees 
would apply in any event, but we had 
no problem spelling it out. That ex-
plicit protection in the legislative text 
is added for reassurance. In so doing, 
our bipartisan group agreed that all 21 
jurisdictions that already have red flag 
laws will all qualify for funding under 
this bill. So, too, we agreed that any 
future jurisdiction that enacts such a 
law must at least meet the same con-
stitutional due process minimum to be 
eligible. 
I spell out this legislative history be-
cause it is important to understand not 
only the context but also the intention 
of these provisions. Let no one doubt 
that States like Connecticut, which al-
ready have these laws, will receive 
funding. 
I am also pleased that, among other 
measures, 
we 
have 
substantially 
shrunk, even if not eliminated, the 
boyfriend loophole. We made straw pur-
chasing and trafficking illegal at the 
Federal level—a measure that I know, 
as a former U.S. attorney and chief 
Federal prosecutor in Connecticut, is 
enormously important. We are invest-
ing hundreds of millions of dollars in 
community violence intervention and 
in the STOP School Violence Program. 
We have been meeting just this week 
and throughout these past years with 
community groups and educators and 
others who want to stop mental health

issues upstream before they create vio-
lence downstream. I know how enor-
mously important these measures can 
be for Connecticut and other States. 
Finally, let me say that I have come 
to the Senate floor too many times— 
too many times to count—to call on us 
to honor with action those incredibly 
strong, brave families from Sandy 
Hook and from all around the country 
who have created this movement that 
we have now. It is a movement that 
will go on. They are not stopping. Nei-
ther should we. We need to continue 
with the same sense of urgency and 
purpose—that movement—toward mak-
ing America even safer. 
This bill is a breakthrough that 
builds a foundation for the future. It 
opens the door. Hopefully, it will show 
colleagues who have, perhaps, been re-
luctant to stand up to the gun lobby in 
the past and have helped to maintain 
the vice-like grip of that gun lobby on 
the Congress that their power is done. 
They have not only waned in their im-
pact, 
but 
their 
intimidation 
and 
threats will no longer hold sway here. 
So we are saving lives. It is a proud 
moment for the U.S. Senate, and I 
thank all of my colleagues for sup-
porting this breakthrough measure. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The sen-
ior Senator from Louisiana. 
Mr. CASSIDY. Madam President, let 
me begin by saying that I am proudly 
pro-Second Amendment. I believe in 
the God-given right for law-abiding 
Americans to keep and bear arms. The 
Second Amendment has given millions 
of Americans the right to defend their 
spouses, their families, their children, 
and their homes. 
But if you consider yourself a sup-
porter of the Second Amendment, you 
absolutely want to do something about 
Uvalde, to do something about the 
murders related to domestic violence, 
to do something about straw pur-
chases, and to do something about teen 
suicide by gun. You cannot be pro-Sec-
ond Amendment unless you care deeply 
about these issues. 
That is why we have targeted legisla-
tion, the Safer Communities Act, that 
addresses the specific problems that 
have led to mass shootings. We do it by 
restricting the access of someone who 
should not have a weapon, by providing 
additional mental health resources, 
and by hardening schools. This legisla-
tion accomplishes these goals without 
infringing upon a law-abiding citizen’s 
Second Amendment right. 
Let me repeat that because there has 
been confusion in speeches from this 
floor. There has been the internet ex-
ploding. There are rumors afloat that 
somehow this infringes upon a law- 
abiding citizen’s right to keep and bear 
arms. That is absolutely false, and if 
anyone says so, they are misleading 
the American people. This doesn’t do 
any of that. 
What this legislation says is that un-
less you are adjudicated—now, ‘‘adju-
dicated’’ is a $5 word that means you 
go before a judge, and the judge looks 
at the evidence. Under this bill, if a 
State puts this into law, then they 
have got to follow due process, which 
says that the person who may lose his 
Second Amendment right has the right 
to an attorney, a higher standard for 
the evidence that must be presented, 
and that the person has his day in 
court. 
This was the gold standard that the 
National Rifle Association always ad-
vocated for, as if we were going to take 
Second Amendment rights from some-
one who should not have them, and this 
bill has that gold standard. 
I had a couple of townhalls just to 
find out what folks back in Louisiana 
were thinking about as to all of this. 
Frankly, they are talking about infla-
tion and the price at the pump as much 
as they are talking about this, but I 
got a message: They think that we can 
protect Second Amendment rights and 
do something about a tragedy such as 
Uvalde. Let me give you some of the 
comments because it shows you the 
confusion and it shows you the con-
cerns and it shows you where the 
American people are. 
Chris asked if, when he dies, he can 
pass his gun to his child if his child is 
law-abiding. 
Absolutely. That is preserved. We 
don’t touch that, and, by golly, Chris 
should be able to do so. 
We were asked by Tyler if this raises 
the age of the ability to purchase a 
weapon from 18 to 21. 
It does not. It doesn’t touch that—al-
though, apparently, Tyler had been 
told that that was the case. 
I was asked by R.J. about keeping 
guns out of the hands of criminals. 
I said: Man, we have got something 
in there, R.J., that actually addresses 
that. 
I heard from two people who said we 
should forbid the purchase of so-called 
assault weapons. Then I heard from one 
guy who said: Man, I live in a tough 
section of town, and if somebody in-
vades my house, I don’t want it to be a 
fair fight. 
So I have heard all sides of these ar-
guments as to what, but the message I 
got was that we can address—we can 
protect—Second Amendment rights but 
still do something about Uvalde. 
Now, it is not just Uvalde. There are 
other types of gun violence in our soci-
ety. This bill addresses at least four. 
There is the domestic violence. There 
is the suicide by the child. There is the 
gangster buying a gun and shooting 
people up. Then there is the rampage 
shooting. Let’s talk about each of 
those. 
When it comes to the domestic vio-
lence—when 
a 
guy 
beats 
up 
his 
girlfriend and he comes back with a 
weapon and shoots her a month later— 
that happens too much. I have talked 
to my police chief, Murphy Paul, in 
Baton Rouge, and he tells me that do-
mestic violence and domestic murder 
spiked under the pandemic. This bill 
does something about it. 
I asked people who oppose this bill: 
What about domestic violence, man? 
What about that woman who is threat-
ened? Shouldn’t we do something for 
her safety? 
This bill does something for her safe-
ty and, quite likely, for her children’s 
safety, and it quite likely prevents a 
suicide by the troubled man who goes 
there in the first place. 
Let’s talk about crime, gangsters, 
straw purchases. 
A boyfriend has got a felony and 
can’t buy a weapon. So the girlfriend 
buys one and slips it to him. It is 
against the law now, but it happens all 
the time. 
R.J., if you are watching on C–SPAN, 
man, I am channeling you. 
We took the provision R.J. said we 
should do, and we increased the pen-
alties for that person who buys a weap-
on merely to pass it to another. They 
will, hopefully, throw her in prison for 
as much as 10 years if she contributes 
to a murder by buying a gun for some-
one who goes out and commits that 
murder. 
We talk about rampage shootings. Do 
you know what is much more common? 
It is the teenager shooting himself. We 
stop that. Oh, they can still steal a 
weapon if they want to, but there is $12 
billion in some form or another for 
mental health services. We do our best 
to reach that child. 
By the way, the rampage shooting is 
the worst. Then comes suicide. Then 
comes the addiction. I am a doctor. I 
have seen this stuff. After the addic-
tion, it just becomes the person who is 
emotionally troubled. 
We are putting in mental health serv-
ices that can address it all with money 
for a 9–8-8 line so that if somebody is 
just like, ‘‘Oh, my gosh, I am des-
perate,’’ they have somebody to call. 
Personally, I would like to have an 
app. I would like to have an ‘‘I am a 
troubled teenager’’ app, and ‘‘I need 
somebody to talk to.’’ They are doing 
this in Utah, and they tell me that the 
investment has been tremendous. I 
think they told me they prevent a sui-
cide a week. That is off the top of my 
head. Call it a suicide every 2 weeks. 
That is a powerful intervention. This 
bill has that capability. 
Lastly, there is the information re-
garding the rampage shooting—Uvalde. 
Somebody told me: You know, I 
searched on the internet, and I didn’t 
see that this guy was troubled. 
That is precisely the point. This man 
is troubled, but he is less than 18. 
Those records are sealed. You can’t get 
to them. So, even though every indica-
tion was that this young, troubled man 
would have had a reason not to be able 
to purchase a weapon, it is sealed. 
When he turns 18, he is a clean guy, and 
he goes out and buys two assault weap-
ons and starts planning his assault. 
If you are pro-Second Amendment, 
by golly, you want to stop that. What 
this bill does is it allows the court to 
look into that and say: ‘‘Oh, he is 
clean; that is OK,’’ or ‘‘No, he is trou-
bled, and we need a little extra time to 
look at this.’’

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S3141 
June 23, 2022 
By the way, that is a provision that 
has been distorted and twisted to imply 
that 
law-abiding 
18-to-21-year-olds 
would not be able to purchase a weap-
on. If you are law-abiding, you can still 
purchase that weapon if you are 18, but 
if not or if there is another indication, 
then the background check has a 
chance to look at it. If you are pro-Sec-
ond Amendment, by golly—I will say it 
one more time—you should applaud 
that provision. 
Now, let’s do a couple of other 
things. 
Do you know that, right now, a Mexi-
can cartel can smuggle weapons to 
Mexico to shoot people up? We make 
that illegal. You would think it al-
ready would be, but it is not. How can 
somebody be against that, criminal-
izing cartels for smuggling weapons to 
Mexico? But, somehow, we are infring-
ing upon the Second Amendment rights 
of cartels. My gosh, I wish we would do 
worse to them. 
We increase penalties for illegal gun 
traffickers 
and 
criminal-to-criminal 
gun transfers. We are doing something 
about criminals, but—have I said it 
yet?—we preserve the Second Amend-
ment rights for the law-abiding. 
Now, I am a gastroenterologist. So I 
don’t know anything about due process 
except as a term, but in speaking to 
JOHN CORNYN, who has done a fantastic 
job, and the other attorneys, I have 
learned a little bit about due process. 
By the way, whenever somebody calls 
me up and they say they have heard 
something on the internet, I say: Why 
don’t you read the bill? It is 80 pages. 
Read the bill. On page 33, you are going 
to read about due process. 
It says that any State red flag law— 
and we don’t encourage those red flag 
laws, but if the State decides to do one 
and they want Federal dollars, they 
now have got to obey these rules. The 
rules say that it must include, at a 
minimum, due process rights that pre-
vent any violation or infringement of 
the Constitution of the United States. 
If you are pro-Second Amendment, 
you should like that. A State can actu-
ally have a red flag law right now and 
not have that in there, but under this 
bill, by golly, they had better. How can 
anyone object to that? 
The bill also ensures that no State 
can sidestep due process. It strengthens 
the citizen’s right to due process. It in-
creases the evidentiary bar. It can’t be 
hearsay. It can’t be a social worker: 
Oh, I am a little nervous. It has to be 
before a judge, and it has to have evi-
dence, and the person losing their right 
or may be losing their right has to 
have the ability to have an attorney 
with them. 
Now, no offense to my people on the 
other side of the aisle, but if a liberal 
State puts forth a law that has poor 
due process, they won’t get Federal 
dollars. That should be something we 
are proud of. 
My State doesn’t have a red flag law. 
This bill does not require, mandate, or 
incentivize that Louisiana develop a 
red flag law. But, you know, my State 
does get money for drug courts, for en-
forcing restraint orders so the fellow 
who is not supposed to go near his wife 
because they are afraid he will beat her 
up again—the police have more re-
sources in order to prevent that. Who 
can be against that? That is in this 
bill. 
By the way, our legislation also hard-
ens schools. There is money for the 
STOP School Violence school safety 
program, including school resource of-
ficers and school hardening. There is 
additional funding for mental health 
resources, drug and violence preven-
tion, mentoring, crisis intervention, 
high-quality training for school per-
sonnel 
on 
suicide 
prevention, 
and 
human trafficking. How can someone 
be against that? This is a solution. 
By the way, we have a serious prob-
lem in mental health. In my career, I 
have been privileged to work with Sen-
ator MURPHY and others on solutions 
for mental health. There are increased 
dollars for Medicaid, including tele-
health services for schools that might 
be in a rural area otherwise without a 
mental professional around. It expands 
mental health services under Medicaid, 
school-based mental health services— 
all expanded. It reauthorizes the Pedi-
atric Mental Health Care Access Pro-
gram. It gives pediatric providers extra 
training in mental health. I could go 
on. 
Now, there is still a lot of misin-
formation out there, but I would say, if 
you don’t know what is in the bill, it is 
online. Pick it up, and read it. But if 
you are pro-Second Amendment, you 
should be for this bill. 
We can protect Second Amendment 
rights. We can make an impact on teen 
suicide, upon domestic abuse, upon 
straw purchases landing guns in the 
hands of criminals, and upon rampage 
shootings, and we could do that while 
protecting the Second Amendment. 
That is what I am hearing from the 
American people. That is what this bill 
does. 
With that, I yield the floor. 
Mr. 
DURBIN. 
Madam 
President, 
today, the Senate is considering bipar-
tisan legislation to help protect our 
kids and our communities from the 
scourge of gun violence. 
This is a critical issue. And it is one 
we have spent a lot of time on in the 
Senate Judiciary Committee, which I 
chair. 
We have held nine hearings in our 
committee in the 117th Congress to dis-
cuss ways to address our Nation’s gun 
violence epidemic. 
Four of those hearings were held in 
the Constitution Subcommittee, which 
is chaired by Senator BLUMENTHAL, and 
I want to commend him for the sub-
committee’s focus on important issues 
like red flag laws, ghost guns, safe 
storage, and gun violence by domestic 
abusers. 
And we have held five hearings in the 
full Judiciary Committee, where we 
have heard testimony from witnesses 
on how to reduce violence. 
I am pleased that the bipartisan bill 
before us includes a number of meas-
ures that witnesses before the Judici-
ary Committee urged the Senate to 
adopt. 
Last December, the Judiciary Com-
mittee held a field hearing in Chicago 
to discuss the firearms trafficking that 
floods the city with illicit guns. 
We heard testimony from David 
Brown, superintendent of the Chicago 
Police Department, who pointed out 
that 93 percent of murders in Chicago 
last year were committed by guns. 
Superintendent Brown testified that 
we need strong Federal laws to crack 
down on gun trafficking and straw pur-
chases, which fuel Chicago’s gun vio-
lence. And the bill before us today pro-
vides those laws. 
Straw purchases are not minor of-
fenses. They have devastating con-
sequences. 
Superintendent 
Brown 
talked about Chicago Police Officer 
Ella French, who was murdered last 
year with a straw purchased gun. I will 
never forget the outpouring of grief I 
saw in the city after we lost Officer 
French. 
The bill before us would crack down 
on straw purchases that put guns in 
the hands of criminals and prohibited 
people. The Senate first voted on this 
issue in 2013 and fell short, so this step 
is long overdue. 
We also held a hearing in March of 
last year where we heard testimony 
from Dr. Selwyn Rogers. He is a trau-
ma surgeon and public health expert 
from the University of Chicago Medi-
cine. 
His 
emergency 
room 
is 
on 
the 
frontlines of the gun violence epidemic, 
stitching up bullet wounds to save 
lives. He called upon Congress to do 
more to help prevent gunshot victims 
from showing up in his hospital in the 
first place. 
He described the way that trauma 
and witnessing violence harms the 
brain and development of a child, mak-
ing it difficult to regulate emotions, 
form healthy relationships, and resolve 
conflicts. 
Dr. Rogers implored us to address 
these emotional scars of trauma that 
fuel the cycle of violence. And so did 
Dr. Moira Szilagyi, the president of the 
American Academy of Pediatrics, who 
testified before our committee last 
week. 
The bill we are considering today 
does just that. It provides billions of 
dollars in grants for school- and com-
munity-based mental health programs. 
It includes more than $28 million for 
a bipartisan program that I passed into 
law in 2018 with Senator CAPITO, Re-
publican of West Virginia. This pro-
gram would expand trauma-informed 
care for students by training more 
school personnel and bringing in more 
mental health professionals from the 
community. 
The bill also provides $40 million to a 
program I have supported for years, the 
National Child Traumatic Stress Net-
work, which is providing specialized

care to thousands of children in Chi-
cago. 
And it will help expand mental 
health treatment for students by en-
hancing the ability for schools to use 
Medicaid coverage for this care. 
Helping children cope with traumatic 
experiences is a vital strategy to pre-
vent and break the cycle of violence. 
The investments provided in this bill 
will make a dramatic difference in this 
effort. 
At another of our hearings, which fo-
cused 
on 
the 
problem 
of 
armed 
carjackings, we heard testimony from 
Vaughn Bryant of the organization 
Metropolitan Family Services in Chi-
cago. 
He testified about the importance of 
community violence intervention, or 
CVI, programs to help steer those who 
are at risk of committing gun violence 
onto a better path. 
These CVI programs have shown real 
promise in Chicago, as another of our 
hearing witnesses, Roseanna Ander of 
the University of Chicago, testified. 
But the programs do not have adequate 
funding to meet the need. 
The bill before us would provide $250 
million over 5 years in Department of 
Justice grants for CVI programs. That 
is double the current annual funding 
for these programs, and it will make a 
big difference. 
We also heard compelling testimony 
last week at our hearing about the im-
pact of gun violence on children. It is a 
grim reality that gunfire is now the 
leading cause of death of American 
children and teens, according to the 
Centers for Disease Control. 
Every day, on average, we lose 12 
kids in America to gun homicides, sui-
cides, and accidents. In the year 2020 
alone, we lost 4,368 American babies, 
children, and teens in firearm deaths— 
an increase of nearly 30 percent over 
the previous year. 
At our hearing, we heard testimony 
from law enforcement and pediatrician 
witnesses about how the Senate needs 
to act to protect our kids. And we also 
heard moving testimony from 19-year- 
old Ernest Willingham, who grew up on 
the West Side of Chicago as the young-
est of 11 kids in his family. 
He has an incredible story. He is the 
first in his family to attend college and 
the first male in his family to graduate 
high school. He is currently in college 
in Boston and is well on his way to a 
career in the healthcare field. Ernest 
has been surrounded by gun violence 
his whole life. His father has been shot. 
His brother has been shot twice. His 
cousin has been shot. And a few years 
ago, his best friend was killed by a 
stray bullet. Ernest talked about the 
anguish of seeing loved ones around 
him get shot. And he described his con-
stant fear that he, himself, would be 
shot too. 
At the hearing Ernest called for gun 
law reforms, but he also talked about 
the importance of mental health. He 
urged us to make sure that commu-
nities that are hard hit by gun violence 
have the counselors and mental health 
professionals they need to help kids 
who are traumatized by gun violence. 
Ernest, help is on the way. This bill 
makes dramatic investments—billions 
of dollars—in mental health treatment 
and care in schools and in commu-
nities. 
I was so impressed by this young 
man’s testimony at our hearing and 
the way he has benefited from ‘‘a vil-
lage’’ of supporters—family, friends, 
teachers, and mentors—to build the re-
silience to rise above trauma in his life 
to pursue his dreams in the medical 
field. 
For the sake of the kids we have lost 
to the gun violence, and for the sake of 
kids like Ernest who shouldn’t have to 
grow up surrounded by this violence, 
we need to act. The bill before us, the 
Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, is a 
compromise. It doesn’t accomplish ev-
erything I want when it comes to gun 
violence, and it has provisions I would 
like to change or could do without. 
It won’t end gun violence in America. 
But it takes important steps toward 
making our Nation safer. It is a mean-
ingful bipartisan package, negotiated 
in good faith by Senators from across 
the political spectrum. 
I want to commend those Senators 
for their hard work, especially Sen-
ators MURPHY, CORNYN, SINEMA, and 
TILLIS. 
We have heard so much in the Senate 
Judiciary Committee about the need to 
do something to reduce gun violence 
and about commonsense reforms and 
investments that would help. It heart-
ens me that a number of those reforms 
and investments are included in this 
package, particularly when it comes to 
cracking down on straw purchases, 
treating trauma, supporting commu-
nity violence intervention programs, 
and investing in mental health and 
counseling in schools and communities. 
This bill doesn’t have everything I 
want. But it is a good, meaningful bi-
partisan compromise, and I will sup-
port it. I urge my colleagues to do the 
same. 
Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, I 
rise today to thank the National Sher-
iffs’ Association for its tireless work on 
the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act. 
I ask unanimous consent that their let-
ter of support be printed in the 
RECORD. 
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the 
RECORD, as follows:

Sheriffs across this great nation, we write to 
lend our support to ‘‘The Bipartisan Safer 
Communities Act.’’ The Sheriffs do request 
that the Medicaid Inmate Exclusion Policy 
(MIEP) be addressed in a colloquy as the bill 
is debated. As you know, the federal law does 
not differentiate between a convicted inmate 
and a person incarcerated prior to convic-
tion. This anomaly needs to be corrected. 
Sheriffs see, up close, the daily carnage of 
gun violence carried out by criminals and in-
dividuals suffering from mental illness. We 
appreciate the authors coming together on a 
bill that can actually save lives, which is 
written in such a way that allows the States 
to craft their own unique answers to the 
questions raised by gun violence. 
Important to Sheriffs and their commu-
nities: 
Supporting better access to mental health 
services in schools is an important part of 
early screening for 40 million Medicaid stu-
dents nationwide. Furthermore, in our dis-
cussions we have determined that school 
property hardening is a critical and nec-
essary step in preventing mass school shoot-
ings. 
Reviewing juvenile records improves cur-
rent law and may help detect persons not eli-
gible for firearm purchases while protecting 
their Constitutional rights. 
Allowing flexibility in the administration 
of the new purpose Byrne JAG grant pro-
gram will help States, and therefore coun-
ties, implement crisis intervention courts 
which may take many forms such as Veteran 
courts, drug courts and outpatient treat-
ment. 
We also find that the due process provi-
sions for extreme risk protection, ‘‘red flag’’ 
orders, maintain the 5th and 14th amend-
ments and provide the rights and tools nec-
essary to defend oneself. 
There are many other provisions of the leg-
islation that are also important but too nu-
merous to mention here. The Sheriffs are 
available to discuss this bill with any mem-
ber of your Caucus/Conference who might 
have questions. Thank you for your work on 
this legislation. 
Very respectfully, 
JONATHAN THOMPSON, 
Executive Director and CEO, 
National Sheriffs’ Association. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The jun-
ior Senator from Connecticut. 
Mr. MURPHY. Madam President, 4 
weeks ago, I was sitting where you are 
sitting, presiding over the Senate on a 
quiet Tuesday afternoon, when news 
broke that 19 children—all the same 
age as my youngest son—had been 
gunned down in their Texas elementary 
school. 
As I scrolled through the early re-
ports of the carnage, all I could think 
of were these two simple questions: 
What are we doing? Why are we here? 
I sat up there obsessing over our will-
ful decision as a body to ignore the 
slaughter that has become so regular 
that the news only seems to pay atten-
tion now when over a dozen die. Our 
collective decision year after year is to 
do nothing. What is the point of this 
job that we fought so hard to get if we 
just decide that saving children’s lives 
is too hard or involves too inconven-
ient an amount of political risk? 
Shooting 
after 
shooting, 
murder 
after murder, suicide after suicide—for 
30 years, Congress stood in its political 
corners and did nothing. But not this 
time. Within 2 days of the Uvalde mas-
sacre, Senator CORNYN, Senator TILLIS, 
Senator SINEMA, and I, joined by other 
Members of this body, had started talk-
ing, not about our disagreements—we

have 
plenty 
of 
those—but 
instead 
about what could be possible if we sat 
together and refused to give up until 
we figured out the set of things that we 
could agree on—the things that could 
get 60 votes—to save lives. 
I am so grateful in the bottom of my 
soul to JOHN, to THOM, to KYRSTEN, and 
the other Senators here who took part 
in these talks for what they did over 
these last 4 weeks. 
I am grateful to Senator SCHUMER 
and Senator MCCONNELL
for empow-
ering these discussions and allowing us 
to have this debate this week. 
I am equally proud of my team—Alli-
son and Samir, Emily and Rebecca, 
Pete and Elizabeth—who worked 24/7 
for the last 30 days straight to get this 
bill done. 
But mostly I am proud of the regular 
people all across this country, many of 
whom were forced to become advocates 
after this epidemic took from them a 
son or a daughter, a mother or a father. 
Those citizens, many of whom are 
watching this debate right now, who 
protested or wrote letters or showed up 
at townhalls year after year, failure 
after failure, roadblock after road-
block, refusing to give up because the 
stakes—their children’s safety—was so 
high that they couldn’t afford to give 
up, that is who I am really proud of 
today, people who would not take no 
for an answer and knew that the right-
eousness of their cause had to eventu-
ally prevail. 
This bill is a compromise. It doesn’t 
do everything I want. But what we are 
doing will save thousands of lives with-
out violating anyone’s Second Amend-
ment rights. 
Through more effective red flag laws, 
by keeping guns away from domestic 
abusers, by being more careful about 
giving weapons to 18-year-olds, by get-
ting more people access to treatment 
for their mental illness, this will be-
come the most significant piece of 
anti-gun violence legislation Congress 
has passed in three decades. 
As a result, this bill also has the 
chance to prove to a weary American 
public that democracy is not so broken 
that it is unable to rise to the moment 
when the need for action, like right 
now, in the wake of Uvalde and Buf-
falo, is most acute. 
What are we doing? Why are we here? 
We are answering those questions 
today—not fully but with enough force 
that anxious moms and dads and kids 
all across this Nation will wake up to-
morrow and be a little more confident 
that the adults who run this country 
actually care about their safety, be-
cause, you know what, people still be-
lieve in us. People still count on us. 
Two months after his son was gunned 
down by a 19-year-old with an assault 
rifle in Sandy Hook, one of the dads 
came to Congress and gave this testi-
mony: ‘‘Before he died,’’ Neil Heslin 
told Congress, my son ‘‘Jesse and I 
used to talk about maybe coming to 
Washington someday. He wanted to go 
up to the Washington monument. When 
we talked about it last year Jesse 
asked if we could [go] meet the Presi-
dent. Now I could be a little cynical 
about politicians. But Jesse, he be-
lieved in you. He learned about you in 
school and he believed in you. I want to 
believe in you, too. I know you can’t 
give me Jesse back. Believe me, if I 
thought you could, I’d be asking you 
for that. But I want to believe that you 
will think about what happened to my 
son and what I’ve seen. I want to be-
lieve that you’ll think about it and 
then you’ll do something about it.’’ 
What are we doing? What are we here 
for if not to do something—something 
meaningful, something real, something 
together—to end this carnage. 
Jesse believed in us. And, today, 
more so than at any time since I came 
to Congress 16 years ago, I believe in us 
too. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ma-
jority leader. 
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, 
first, let me thank Senator MURPHY for 
his amazing work and that powerful 
speech. He did a great, great job, as did 
many others. 
Now, tonight, the U.S. Senate is 
doing something many believed was 
impossible even a few weeks ago: We 
are passing the first significant gun 
safety bill in nearly 30 years. 
The gun safety bill we are passing to-
night can be described with three ad-
jectives: bipartisan, commonsense, life-
saving. 
As the author of the Brady bill in 
1994—the last legislative effort to fight 
gun violence in Congress—I am pleased 
that this moment has finally come and 
that we are finally taking meaningful 
action to keep our communities safe. I 
hope it paves the way for future action 
on guns in Congress and at all levels of 
government. 
As I said, this is not a cure-all for all 
the ways gun violence affects our Na-
tion, but it is a long-overdue step in 
the right direction. Passing this gun 
safety bill is truly significant, and it is 
going to save lives. It was so, so signifi-
cant that we let the process work in-
stead of just having one vote, which 
would divide us and not accomplish 
anything. And I hope that portends 
doing it again on guns and on other 
issues as well. 
I want to thank my colleagues for 
their incredible work. This was a great 
moment here on a very, very difficult 
issue. I want to thank Senators MUR-
PHY and SINEMA; Senators CORNYN and 
TILLIS, who showed amazing courage; 
and all of my colleagues on both sides 
of the aisle for working together to 
break this logjam. The American peo-
ple have waited long enough. Let’s fi-
nally take action to pass this life-
saving gun safety bill. 
AMENDMENT WITHDRAWN 
Now, Madam President, I withdraw 
amendment No. 5100. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator has that right. 
The amendment is withdrawn.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE

June 23, 2022 
PACT Act. We passed that bill with 84 
votes in favor of it, something that 
rarely happens around here. 
This bill was supported by the Presi-
dent; it was supported by the VA Sec-
retary; and it was the No. 1 priority for 
nearly every major veterans advocacy 
group in the Nation. In fact, I cannot 
think of one that this wasn’t the No. 1 
priority for. 
Upon passage, it was transmitted to 
the House, and they indicated that 
they would move it within days to the 
President’s desk. Unfortunately, after 
Senate passage, the bill ran into a pro-
cedural hurdle, as bills often do around 
here, but tonight we have a chance to 
get back on track. We have a chance to 
get it to the House without further 
delay. And I might add, what this bill 
does is it takes care of a decades-long 
issue with toxic exposure. 
The 
ranking 
member, 
Senator 
MORAN, and I talked about this bill a 
week or two ago at length. This bill 
will help save veterans’ lives who have 
been exposed to toxins and will help 
support 
their 
families 
after 
they 
passed. I would hope my colleagues will 
keep that in mind as they decide 
whether this is an appropriate time to 
play political games, to delay this 
bill’s ability to become law, and ob-
struct for the sake of obstruction. 
Everyone in this body knows that our 
veterans deserve more than that. They 
have waited long enough for the care 
and the benefits that are provided by 
this bill, and they shouldn’t have to 
wait any longer because it did receive 
84 votes in this body a week or so ago. 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-
sent that the Secretary of the Senate 
be authorized to request the House of 
Representatives to return the papers 
on H.R. 3967; I further ask that not-
withstanding the lack of receipt of the 
papers, the Senate proceed to the im-
mediate consideration of the Tester 
resolution that is at the desk to re-
move the blue-slip provision in the 
PACT Act; that the resolution be 
agreed to and the motion to reconsider 
be considered made and laid upon the 
table without intervening action or de-
bate. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
The Senator from Pennsylvania. 
Mr. TOOMEY. Mr. President, reserv-
ing the right to object, and let me be 
clear that the nature of my objection is 
not about the fact that this legislation 
authorizes about $280 billion, I think, 
for healthcare for veterans that re-
sulted from toxic exposure and it cre-
ates new categories of eligibility and it 
contemplates this and authorizes this 
$280 billion of additional spending over 
10 years. 
What everybody should be aware of is 
that absent of this legislation, existing 
statute already obligates the Federal 
Government, through the VA, to spend 
about $400 billion over the next 10 
years on veterans’ healthcare that re-
sults from veterans being exposed to 
toxic circumstances during their serv-
ice. So there is $400 billion that 
preexisted this bill and $280 billion of 
new spending. 
Now, the $400 billion that we were al-
ready going to spend—and we will 
spend—is put under the discretionary 
spending caps in that category of dis-
cretionary spending because, as you 
know, discretionary spending is lim-
ited. There is a cap every year on how 
much can be spent in this discretionary 
spending category. There is one other 
category of spending around here, and 
that is mandatory spending that is not 
subject to caps. That is just unlimited 
whatever is required. 
The legislation puts the $280 billion 
in new spending in the mandatory 
spending category, and we can argue 
about whether that is a good idea or 
not. I don’t think it is a great idea, but 
that is not what really is outrageous 
about what is going on here. What is 
really outrageous is in this legislation, 
they take the $400 billion that was 
going to be spent anyway that is al-
ready preexisting under existing stat-
ute—they take that out of discre-
tionary spending and move it over to 
mandatory spending. 
Why would they do a thing like that? 
Why would that be necessary to move 
$400 billion that is already authorized 
to be spent under current law and move 
it out of discretionary and into the 
mandatory spending? The reason is be-
cause that way you create a big gaping 
hole in the discretionary spending cat-
egory, which can be filled with another 
$400 billion of totally unrelated spend-
ing. Who knows on what? That is why 
it had to be moved out of discretionary 
and into mandatory spending. 
My objection isn’t about the sub-
stance of this bill. It is about this 
budgetary gimmick that is designed to 
allow hundreds of billions of dollars of 
additional spending on totally unre-
lated, who-knows-what categories. We 
have inflation hitting a 40-year high. 
We have a government that has been 
spending trillions of dollars, too much 
money—printing the money to spend— 
and everybody sees it every day at the 
pump, at the grocery store, every-
where. And what this gimmick does is 
it makes it possible to spend yet an-
other $400 billion. 
This is terrible policy. I am going to 
suggest the modification to the unani-
mous consent request from my friend— 
and he is my friend—from Montana. 
And it is very simple. It says nothing 
about the $280 billion in new spending 
that is permitted under this legisla-
tion. It simply would keep the $400 bil-
lion that we were going to spend any-
way, keep it right in the category that 
it has always been in—keep it in the 
discretionary 
spending 
category 
so 
that it doesn’t create this hole that 
gets filled with another $400 billion on 
who knows what. That is what my 
amendment does. 
My 
amendment 
wouldn’t 
reduce 
spending on veterans’ healthcare by a 
penny. It wouldn’t, in any way, impede 
the ability of veterans to get the 
healthcare that they need as a result of 
toxic exposures. It has nothing to do 
with that. It is only about preventing 
huge, excessive spending in other cat-
egories—who knows what—that would 
be permitted under this bill. 
Mr. President, therefore, I ask unani-
mous consent that the Senator modify 
his request to include my amendment 
to the Tester resolution; that the 
amendment be considered and agreed 
to; that the resolution, as amended, be 
agreed to, and the motions to recon-
sider be considered made and laid upon 
the table without intervening action or 
debate. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection to the modification? 
The Senator from Montana. 
Mr. TESTER. Reserving the right to 
object. I don’t know where to start. 
First of all, this amendment does 
nothing to fix the blue-slip issue that 
was the real problem here. That was a 
de minimis amount of money anyway. 
Nonetheless, it is a blue-slip issue, and 
we have to fix it. 
I would wholeheartedly disagree with 
my friend, the Senator from Pennsyl-
vania, in saying that what you are ac-
tually doing is stopping benefits from 
veterans with this amendment. We are 
a body here in the U.S. Senate. If you 
want to talk about the appropriations 
process, we can talk about the appro-
priations process. But in the process of 
those debates, you shouldn’t be deny-
ing healthcare to veterans, which is ex-
actly what the good Senator from 
Pennsylvania is doing today. For that 
reason, I object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard. 
Is there objection to the original 
Tester request? 
Mr. TOOMEY. I object.

tion is heard.

NA-
TIONAL CHAMPIONSHIP 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the Senate 
proceed to the consideration of S. Res. 
699, submitted earlier today. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will report the resolution by 
title. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
read as follows: 
A resolution (S. Res. 699) congratulating 
the Terrapins men’s lacrosse team of the 
University of Maryland, College Park for 
winning the 2022 National Collegiate Ath-
letics Association Division I men’s lacrosse 
national championship. 
There being no objection, the Senate 
proceeded to consider the resolution. 
Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I rise 
today to congratulate the University of 
Maryland’s Men’s Lacrosse Team for 
winning the NCAA Division 1 cham-
pionship. The Terrapins completed an 
historic undefeated season, winning 18 
games—an NCAA record for the most 
victories in a season without a loss. 
The perfect season culminated with a 
9–7 victory over Cornell University for 
the national championship. 
Lacrosse is the oldest organized team 
sport in North America, dating back 
among Indigenous communities to 1100 
AD. Jesuit missionaries in Canada doc-
umented the Mohawk people playing 
the game in 1757. Here in the United 
States, lacrosse is popular nationwide, 
but New York and Maryland remain 
the ‘‘hotbeds’’ of lacrosse. The game 
became popular in the Baltimore area 
in the 1890s. The NCAA began hosting a 
tournament to determine the national 
champion in 1971. In the 51 years since 
then—there was no tournament in 2020 
because of the COVID–19 pandemic— 
the Terps have won four national 
championships, Johns Hopkins Univer-
sity—JHU—has won nine, and Loyola 
University Maryland has won one. 
Maryland universities have been na-
tional champion or runner-up in 37 of 
the 51 years the NCAA has hosted the 
tournament. 
The Terps’ championship season was 
particularly sweet, coming on the heels 
of a one-goal loss to the University of 
Virginia—UVA—in last year’s cham-
pionship match. That was the team’s 
only loss last season; over the last 2 
years, the Terps have gone 33–1. This 
year’ team was the first Division 1 
team to go undefeated since 2006 and 
just the fourth undefeated team over 
the past 30 years, joining UVA, JHU, 
and Princeton in that exalted club. The 
championship is the second for head 
coach John Tillman, who has guided 
the Terps to the NCAA tournament all 
11 years he has been the head coach. 
Lacrosse is truly a team sport. There 
are a few players, however, whose con-
tributions deserve special recognition. 
Logan 
Wisnauskas—attack—became 
the first Terp to record 100 points in a 
single season and then went on to win 
the Tewaaraton Award as the Nation’s 
top collegiate player after a 61 goal, 42 
assist, 
103 
point 
season. 
Anthony 
DeMaio—midfield—scored 
the 
100th 
goal of his career during the national 
championship game and scored 17 goals 
in the postseason. He scored three 
straight goals during a span of 2:09— 
and four overall for his fifth hat trick 
in his last six games—as Maryland 
ended the first quarter on a 4–0 run to 
take a lead the team would not relin-
quish. Goalie Logan McNaney was the 
2022 NCAA Tournament’s Most Out-
standing 
Player, 
making 
17 
saves 
against Cornell and 61 saves in the 
tournament. 
Wisnauskas, 
DeMaio, 
McNaney, Luke Wierman—faceoff—and 
Ajax Zappitello—defense—were named 
to the NCAA All-Tournament Team. 
I congratulate all the players, coach-
es, and staff for guiding the Terps 
through a season for the record books 
and making all Marylanders proud. The 
players are: Noah Beacham, Colin 
Burlace, Jack Brennan, B.J. Burlace, 
Chace Cope, Joshua Coffman, Jonathan 
Donville, 
Anthony 
DeMaio, 
Bubba 
Fairman, Gabe Goforth, John Geppert,

50TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE PELL 
GRANT PROGRAM 
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, today 
marks the 50th anniversary of the Pell 
Grant Program, a program that has 
been the bedrock of our Nation’s in-
vestment in higher education. 
This bipartisan program has provided 
direct financial aid to low-income stu-
dents since 1972, and there currently 
are 7 million students receiving a Pell 
grant. In my home State of Illinois, 
more than 208,000 Pell grants totaling 
nearly $860 million were awarded in the 
2020–2021 academic year. These Federal 
dollars help provide students and fami-
lies access to higher education, well- 
paying jobs, and economic mobility.

S3151 
June 23, 2022 
But Pell grants have failed to keep 
up with the times. When it was cre-
ated, the Pell grant covered more than 
75 percent of the average cost of at-
tendance at a 4-year public college. 
Today, Pell grants cover less than 30 
percent of these expenses. This means 
that students are forced to take on stu-
dent loans, exacerbating the student 
loan debt crisis. Fourty-five million 
Americans owe $1.7 trillion in student 
loan debt, which is second only to 
mortgages as the largest category of 
consumer debt. 
Doubling the Pell grant would be an 
investment in our Nation’s future and 
would help ensure students can access 
higher education. At the same time, 
the for-profit college industry—an in-
dustry with a track record of preying 
on low-income students—must con-
tinue to be held accountable so stu-
dents and taxpayers are not being 
ripped off. The for-profit college indus-
try enrolls only 8 percent of all post-
secondary students in America, but ac-
counts for 30 percent of all Federal stu-
dent loan defaults. Too often, students 
and taxpayers are left holding the bag. 
As we celebrate the 50th anniversary 
of Pell grants, I urge my colleagues to 
support low-income students by in-
creasing these grants to cover a great-
er amount of college expenses and en-
suring the most vulnerable students 
are protected from fraudulent for-prof-
it colleges.

BUDGETARY REVISIONS 
Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, S. 
Con. Res. 14, the fiscal year 2022 con-
gressional budget resolution, included 
a reserve fund in section 3003 to allow 
the chairman of the Committee on the 
Budget to revise budget aggregates and 
committee allocations for legislation 
that would not increase the deficit over 
the period of fiscal years 2022 to 2031. 
The Senate will soon consider S. 2938, 
the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, 
as proposed to be amended by Senate 
Amendment No. 5099, which meets the 
condition of not increasing the deficit 
over the relevant 10-year period. As 
such, I am filing a revision to the ag-
gregates and committee allocations 
under the budget resolution, which 
were last revised on April 7, as well as 
the Senate pay-as-you-go scorecard. 
Specifically, the Congressional Budget 
Office estimates that Division A of the 
bill would increase 2022 budget author-
ity by $7.5 billion and increase 2022 out-
lays by $1 million but decrease spend-
ing over the 5- and 10-year windows. 
Over the 2022–2026 period, the bill would 
decrease spending by $5.7 billion and 
increase revenues by $4 million. Over 
the 2022–2031 period, the bill would de-
crease spending by $5.3 billion and in-
crease revenue by $10 million. Division 
B of the bill appropriates additional 
discretionary spending, but that spend-
ing is designated as an emergency and 
not subject to budget enforcement. 
I ask unanimous consent that the ac-
companying tables, which provide de-
tails about the adjustment, be printed 
in the RECORD. 
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the 
RECORD, as follows:

June 23, 2022 
AGM–114 Hellfire missiles. Also included 
were communication equipment, electronic 
warfare systems, M197 20mm machine guns, 
Target Sight System, support equipment, 
spare engine containers, spare and repair 
parts, tools and test equipment, technical 
data and publications, personnel training 
and training equipment, U.S. government 
and contractor engineering, technical, and 
logistics support services, and other related 
elements of logistics and program support. 
The total estimated program cost was $205 
million. Major Defense Equipment (MDE) 
constituted $180 million of this total. 
On August 4, 2020, Congress was notified by 
Congressional certification transmittal num-
ber 0I–20 of the addition of forty-four (44) 
AGM–114A Hellfire Missiles; four (4) M36E8 
Inert Hellfire Captive Air Training Missiles 
(CATMs); twelve (12) 7.62MM M240D Machine 
Guns; and one hundred fourteen (114) Ad-
vance Precision Kill Weapon System II 
(APKWS–II) WGU–59/B Guidance Sections. 
The estimated value of these MDE items was 
$9.7 million and resulted in an increase of the 
estimated MDE cost to $189.7 million. The 
total case value increased to $214.7 million. 
This transmittal reports the replacement 
of fifty-eight (58) AGM–114A Hellfire Missiles 
(MDE) with fifty-eight (58) AGM–114R (NN) 
Hellfire Missiles (MDE); four (4) M36E8 Inert 
Hellfire 
Captive 
Air 
Training 
Missiles 
(CATMs) (MDE) with four (4) M36E9 Inert 
Hellfire CATMs (MDE); and one hundred 
fourteen (114) Advanced Precision Kill Weap-
on System (APKWS–II) WGU–59B Guidance 
Sections (MDE) with one hundred fourteen 
(114) Advanced Precision Kill Weapon Sys-
tem (APKWS–II) WGU–59/B Guidance Sec-
tions (Single Variant) (MDE). No additional 
quantities will be provided. The estimated 
MDE value will remain $189.7 million. The 
total case value will remain $214.7 million. 
(iv) Significance: These proposed weapons 
systems will augment the Czech Republic’s 
multi-mission, multi-role helicopters, in-
creasing the Czech Republic’s ability to meet 
current and future threats. 
(v) Justification: The proposed sale will 
support the foreign policy and national secu-
rity objectives of the United States by im-
proving the security of a NATO ally that is 
an important force for political stability and 
economic progress in Europe. It is vital to 
U.S. national interests to assist the Czech 
Republic in developing and maintaining a 
strong and ready self-defense capability. 
(vi) Sensitivity of Technology: The AGM– 
114R Hellfire Missile is an air-to-surface mis-
sile with a multi-mission, multi-target, pre-
cision strike capability. The M36E9 is an 
inert Hellfire Captive Air Training Missile. 
The Advanced Precision Kill Weapon Sys-
tem (APKWS) is an air-to ground weapon 
that consists of an APKWS Guidance Section 
(GS), legacy 2.75-inch MK66 Mod 4 rocket 
motor, and legacy MK152 and MK435/436 war-
head/fuze. The APKWS is a tactical rocket 
system that can be launched from several 
platforms, offering multi-mission, multi-tar-
get capability and precision-strike lethality. 
These guided rockets are steered to the tar-
get by following reflected laser beam energy 
directed onto the target either by the 
launching aircraft, a second aircraft, or 
ground-based troops operating a laser desig-
nator. 
The highest level of classification of de-
fense articles, components, and services in-
cluded in this potential sale is SECRET.

by Congressional certification transmittal 
number 19–0D, of the inclusion of an addi-
tional one hundred thirty (130) Javelin Block 
1 (FGM–148) missiles (MDE). The addition of 
these items resulted in a revised total MDE 
cost of $75.6 million. The total estimated 
case value increased to $91 million. 
This transmittal reports the inclusion of 
an additional one hundred fifty-six (156) Jav-
elin Block 1 (FGM–148F) missiles (MDE). 
This inclusion will result in a revised MDE 
value of $111.6 million. The total estimated 
case value will increase to $127 million. 
(iv) Significance: Estonia plays an impor-
tant role in strengthening deterrence capa-
bilities on the northeastern flank of NATO. 
Sale of the requested items will significantly 
enhance this NATO partner’s ability to 
counter threats posed by armored and hard-
ened targets, greatly increasing NATO’s 
overall security, and providing a demon-
strable deterrent effect.

Export Control Act. 
POLICY JUSTIFICATION 
NATO Support and Procurement Agency 
(NSPA)—Precision Guided Munitions 
NATO Support and Procurement Agency as 
Lead Nation has requested the possible sale 
of two hundred thirty-nine (239) GBU–39/B 
Small Diameter Bombs, Increment I; two 
hundred four (204) FMU–152 fuzes; two hun-
dred four (204) MK–82 500LB General Purpose 
Bombs; and fifty (50) BLU–109 2000LB Hard 
Target Penetrator Bombs, that will be added 
to a previously implemented case. The origi-
nal FMS case, valued at $1.87 million, in-
cluded forty (40) GBU–39/B Small Diameter 
Bombs, Increment I. Therefore, this notifica-
tion is for a total of two hundred seventy- 
nine (279) GBU–39/B Small Diameter Bombs, 
Increment I; two hundred four (204) FMU–152 
fuzes; two hundred four (204) MK–82 500LB 
General Purpose Bombs; and fifty (50) BLU– 
109 2000LB Hard Target Penetrator Bombs. 
Also included are smoke signal cartridges; 
engineering and technical support and assist-
ance; and other related elements of logistical 
and program support. The total estimated 
cost is $22.7 million. 
This proposed sale supports the foreign 
policy and national security of the United 
States by increasing the flexibility of Bel-
gium, Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, 
Greece, Hungary, Italy, the Netherlands, 
Norway, Poland, Portugal, Spain, and the 
United Kingdom, twelve NATO nations and 
one NATO enhanced opportunity partner na-
tion, to contribute to overseas contingency 
operations. This sale increases the quantity 
of precision-guided munitions within NATO 
and allows for their pre-coordinated transfer 
in support of national and NATO require-
ments. 
The proposed sale will improve NATO’s ca-
pability to meet current and future ground 
threats with precision. NATO will use the 
enhanced capability as a deterrent to re-
gional threats, and to increase interoper-
ability within contingency operations. Many 
of the purchasing nations already have preci-
sion-guided munitions in their inventories 
and will all have no difficulty absorbing 
these munitions into its armed forces. 
The proposed sale of this equipment and 
support will not alter the basic military bal-
ance in the region. 
The principal contractors for production 
are the Boeing Corporation, St Louis, MO; 
and Raytheon Missile Systems, Tucson, AZ. 
The principal contractor for integration is 
unknown and will be determined during con-
tract negotiations. There are no known off-
set agreements proposed in connection with 
this potential sale. 
Implementation of this proposed sale will 
not require the assignment of any additional 
U.S. Government or contractor representa-
tives to NATO. 
There will be no adverse impact on U.S. de-
fense readiness as a result of this proposed 
sale.

Offer Pursuant to Section 36(b)(1) of the 
Arms Export Control Act 
Annex Item No. vii 
(vii) Sensitivity of Technology 
1. The GBU–39 Small Diameter Bomb In-
crement 1 (SDB–1) is a 250 pound GPS-aided 
inertial navigation system, small autono-
mous, day or night, adverse weather, conven-
tional, air-to-ground precision glide weapon 
able to strike fixed and stationary re- 
locatable non-hardened targets from standoff 
ranges. It is intended to provide aircraft 
with an ability to carry a high number of 
bombs. Aircraft are able to carry four SDBs 
in place of one 2,000 pound bomb. 
2. The Joint Programmable Fuze (JPF) 
FMU–152 is a multi-delay, multi-arm and 
proximity sensor compatible with general 
purpose blast, frag and hardened-target pene-
trator weapons. The JPF settings are cock-
pit selectable in flight when used with nu-
merous precision-guided weapons. 
3. MK–82 General Purpose (GP) bomb is a 
500 pound, free-fall, unguided, low-drag weap-
on used for attacking soft and intermedi-
ately protected targets. 
4. The BLU–109 is a 2,000 pound hard target 
penetrator warhead designed to penetrate 
hardened structures before detonating. 
5. The highest level of classification of de-
fense articles, components, and services in-
cluded in this potential sale is SECRET. 
6. If a technologically advanced adversary 
were to obtain knowledge of the specific 
hardware and software elements, the infor-
mation could be used to develop counter-
measures that might reduce weapon system 
effectiveness or be used in the development 
of a system with similar or advanced capa-
bilities. 
7. A determination has been made that 
NATO Support and Procurement Agency 
(NSPA) and the participating countries can 
provide substantially the same degree of pro-
tection for the sensitive technology being re-
leased as the U.S. Government. This sale is 
necessary in furtherance of the U.S. foreign 
policy and national security objectives out-
lined in the Policy Justification. 
8. All defense articles and services listed in 
this transmittal have been authorized for re-
lease and export to NSPA, Belgium, Czech 
Republic, Denmark, Finland, Greece, Hun-
gary, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Po-
land, Portugal, Spain, and the United King-
dom.

WATER RESOURCES 
DEVELOPMENT ACT 
Mr. RISCH. Mr. President, I rise 
today to discuss and express my sup-
port for the Columbia River Federal 
Power System. The federal dams on the 
Columbia River System are a boon to 
the Pacific Northwest and stands as an 
example to other hydropower projects 
across the country and the world. Its 
capacity to generate always-on, base-
load carbon-free power is vital not just 
to the Northwest, but relied upon by 
our friends in surrounding regions as 
well. The dams also bring substantial 
benefits for flood control, local recre-
ation, irrigation, navigation, wildlife 
conservation, 
and 
industry. 
Even 
Idaho, my landlocked home State, is 
able to have a working seaport because 
of the navigation benefits provided by 
these dams, sending Idaho’s products 
all around the world in an efficient, 
cost-effective, and low-carbon manner. 
As additional challenges have risen, 
scientists and managers at the U.S. 
Army Corps of Engineers have adapted 
to ensure the dams are still beneficial 
to humans and our natural environ-
ment. 
In the Water Resources Development 
Act before the Senate today, there is a 
seemingly innocuous but rather con-
sequential and far-reaching study di-
rected at aquatic habitat restoration in 
the Columbia River Basin. Other stud-
ies in this section are small enough to 
be measured in acres or at largest, a 
portion of a state. The Columbia River 
Basin spans nearly 260,000 square miles 
and reaches into seven States. This is 
not a small, localized review but in-
stead an authorization for a com-
prehensive study on anything relating 
to aquatic restoration in one of the 
largest basins in the country. 
This may sound benign to my col-
leagues who are not from the North-
west, but this issue is not a new or 
small one. I have been discussing the 
Columbia River System and salmon re-
covery since my early days in the 
Idaho Legislature. Improving salmon 
and 
steelhead 
populations 
in 
the 
Northwest is an important goal and 
one I have long supported. What I can-
not, however, support are the constant 
efforts to remove the benefits provided 
by our hydropower system under the 
guise of salmon recovery. The fact of 
the matter is we have studied this river 
and these dams ad nauseam. Most re-
cently, we completed the Columbia 
River System Operations review, which 
specifically considered whether dam 
breaching was necessary for fish recov-
ery and determined the opposite. It is 
pointless and irresponsible to spend 
further taxpayer dollars considering 
dam breaching. 
This brings me back to the study in 
title II. I appreciate very much the 
chairman and ranking member work-
ing with me to place appropriate

sideboards to ensure this study will not 
consider any recommendations that 
would result in the removal or reduc-
tion of the federally authorized pur-
poses of the system or any measures 
that would result in a reduction in 
services provided by those purposes. 
While I still believe that this study is 
far too large and untargeted to result 
in timely recommendations for anad-
romous fish recovery—and as such, 
wastes funding better used in the re-
gion than on yet another river study— 
with this important limitation, I am 
pleased to be able to support the over-
all WRDA bill and the many important 
priorities it encompasses for our water 
infrastructure. Should this study be 
signed into law, I expect and will pay 
careful mind that it meets the specific 
congressional intent of preserving our 
hydropower system and the many bene-
fits it provides. I look forward to con-
tinue working with my colleagues to 
identify solutions to salmon recovery 
that do not inhibit the clean energy, 
flood control, navigation, agricultural, 
and recreation benefits of our Federal 
power system.

UNITED STATES INNOVATION AND 
COMPETITION ACT OF 2021 
Mr. WARNOCK. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the following 
letters be printed in the RECORD. 
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the 
Record, as follows: 
APRIL 27, 2022. 
Hon. RAPHAEL WARNOCK, 
U.S. Senate, 
Washington, DC. 
DEAR SENATOR WARNOCK: As a business or-
ganization focused on a vibrant economy, 
the Metro Atlanta Chamber encourages you 
to support the INFORM Consumers Act as 
part of the bipartisan U.S. Innovation and 
Competition Act of 2021. This will ensure le-
gitimate businesses and consumers in Geor-
gia and across the country are better pro-
tected. 
The Metro Atlanta Chamber represents 
businesses, colleges and universities, and 
nonprofits across the 29–county region that 
makes up the nation’s ninth largest market. 
As a more than 160-year-old organization, we 
strive to ensure that Georgia maintains its 
status as the number one state to do busi-
ness. 
In recent years, Georgia shoppers have 
been provided access to a vast network of af-
fordable on line products and convenient, 
fast delivery. Georgia retailers are proud of 
the supply chain that has allowed for this, 
especially when our economy was upended 
due to the COVID–19 pandemic. Families 
could depend on Georgia retailers that were 
essential in keeping our state open for busi-
ness and our communities safe. However, the 
rapid growth of online shopping has provided 
new 
opportunities 
for 
criminals 
and 
fraudsters—with many of the latter located 
in China—to peddle cheap counterfeits and 
stolen products designed to undercut Amer-
ican manufacturers and local retailers. 
The INFORM Consumers Act will help stop 
unsafe counterfeit products such as N95 
masks, toys, and automobile parts from 
being sold in significant quantities, which 
are putting Georgia consumers at risk. 
Today, illegitimate imports cost domestic 
retailers at least $54.1 billion in sales. We 
can only expect this number to grow as Rus-
sia scraps trademark protections amid the 
ongoing conflict in Eastern Europe and joins 
China as one of the most egregious intellec-
tual property offenders. 
Meanwhile, sophisticated rings of crimi-
nals are brazenly stealing merchandise off 
the shelves of retail store shelves and selling 
these items online using fake screennames 
and bogus business accounts. In addition to 
putting retail workers and customers in 
harm’s way, these thieves pose a serious eco-
nomic threat. Research suggests that retail 
theft has cost retailers across the nation 
$68.9 billion in losses. Congress must address 
these growing problems before additional 
consumers or legitimate American busi-
nesses pay the price. The common-sense 
measures of the INFORM Consumers Act, in-
troduced by Senators Dick Durbin (D–IL) 
and Bill Cassidy (R–LA) in the Senate, and 
Representatives Jan Schakowsky (D–IL) and 
Gus Bilirakis (R–FL) in the House will make 
it harder for criminal networks and con art-
ists from around the globe to use the ano-
nymity of online marketplaces to dupe con-
sumers with counterfeit and stolen products. 
INFORM would require online market-
places to verify high-volume sellers on their 
platforms and provides consumers with a 
method to contact sellers if they suspect 
they have been ripped off and sold a fake, 
broken, or dangerous item. This bill would 
not in any way inhibit the small businesses 
in Georgia that conduct legitimate com-
merce on marketplaces every day, and it pro-
tects the personal information of small sell-
ers. That’s why it has united consumer 
groups, manufacturers, retailers, and mar-
ketplaces who want to protect American 
consumers from stolen, fake, and dangerous 
products. 
This simple, bipartisan measure will bring 
transparency and accountability to third- 
party sellers online and make it harder for 
criminals and counterfeiters to harm local 
businesses and consumers. On behalf of Geor-
gia retailers—and especially for our employ-
ees and customers—we strongly urge you to 
support the INFORM Consumers Act and in-
clude it as part of the U.S. Innovation and 
Competition Act of 2021. 
Sincerely, 
KATIE KIRKPATRICK, P.E., 
President and Chief Executive Officer.

Hon. RAPHAEL WARNOCK, 
Washington, DC. 
DEAR SENATOR WARNOCK: On behalf of the 
LaGrange Troup County Chamber of Com-
merce, I am pleased to provide support for 
increased funding for domestic semicon-
ductor production. Our membership includes 
several industrial partners in Troup County 
who have been negatively impacted and re-
peatedly shutdown due to chip shortages. 
Our Chamber appreciates your efforts to pro-
vide U.S. manufacturers access to these im-
portant components now and in the future. 
The LaGrange Troup County Chamber of 
Commerce was established in 1911 to support 
and enhance the businesses and business cli-
mate of Troup County. Through our mission 
of championing our member businesses and 
serving as a catalyst for advancing the re-
gion’s economic success, we work diligently 
on their behalf.

The LaGrange Troup County Chamber

forts to alleviate challenges in workforce de-
velopment and strengthen supply chain resil-

Sincerely, 
CONNIE HENSLER,

MARCH 2, 2022. 
Senator RAPHAEL WARNOCK. 
DEAR SENATOR WARNOCK: On behalf of the 
Greater Columbus Chamber of Commerce, I 
am excited to offer this letter in support of 
the U.S. Innovation and Competition Act as 
well as the America COMPETES Act. As our 
economy and workforce continue to change, 
we believe that strengthening our ability to 
compete globally is key to our long-term 
success. The Chamber is actively engaged in 
supporting and enhancing our local commu-
nity as a regional catalyst in economic 
growth, workforce development, community 
vibrancy, and inclusion. 
We are hopeful that the passing of this bill 
means stronger funding and policy support 
for regional job growth; especially with sup-
port for semi-conductor manufacturing that 
further enables technology manufacturing 
and strengthens Georgia’s automobile indus-
try, the outcome of alleviating supply chain 
obstacles and the inclusion of historic in-
vestments in commercial development and 
science and technology. Further, strength-
ening the designated innovation hub between 
Columbus and Opelika remains an important 
focus and we’d look forward to the avail-
ability of funding to support research and de-
velopment and commercialization in this 
arena. 
Lastly, as we tackle the challenge of build-
ing a world class workforce in a tough envi-
ronment, support via workforce development 
programs and funding is imperative. 
Please accept our support for SB 1260, the 
U.S. Innovation and Competition Act. We 
look forward to this advancing and to con-
tinuing to build a strong Columbus, a strong 
Georgia and a strong nation. Thanks for 
your continued partnership. 
Very respectfully, 
JERALD MITCHELL, 
President and CEO. 
JUNE 16, 2022. 
Hon. Rev. RAPHAEL WARNOCK, 
Washington, DC. 
DEAR SENATOR REVEREND WARNOCK: As Di-
rector of the Georgia Manufacturing Exten-
sion Partnership (GaMEP), I want to thank 
you for your ongoing efforts to enhance 
Georgia’s innovation and manufacturing sec-
tors and work to strengthen U.S. competi-
tiveness. Each year, GaMEP assists more 
than 1,000 small and medium-sized manufac-
turers across Georgia through onsite imple-
mentation, training and learning opportuni-
ties, connections to partners, and other re-
sources. I hope you can further support the 
success of Georgia’s manufacturing sector in 
your important role as Senate conferee to 
the bicameral conference for the United 
States Innovation and Competition Act 
(USICA, S. 1260) and the America COM-
PETES Act of 2022 (COMPETES Act, H.R. 
4521). 
These important bills under negotiation 
have the potential to transform the U.S. 
economy by spurring new innovations in 
emerging technologies, jumpstarting our do-
mestic semiconductor production capabili-
ties, and dramatically expanding and solidi-
fying the resiliency of the U.S. manufac-
turing base. I strongly encourage the inclu-
sion in the final conference agreement the 
proposed increase of authorized funding for 
the National Institute of Standards and 
Technology’s Manufacturing Extension Part-
nership (MEP) program and the establish-
ment ofa National Manufacturing Advisory 
Council as outlined in both the Senate 
USJCA and the House COMPETES Act. The 
bills also include important provisions to 
create new supply chain resiliency programs 
to identify, prepare for, and respond to 
threats to the U.S. supply chain. Looking to-
ward development of future and emerging in-
dustries, manufacturers will also have an im-
portant role in furthering Georgia’s eco-
nomic development through the proposed De-
partment of Commerce Regional Technology 
Hubs program. Without actual funding be-
hind these tremendously important policy 
proposals, these activities may never ad-
vance. As such, I encourage Congress to in-
clude appropriated funding to begin these ef-
forts. 
GaMEP is proud to promote the success of 
the manufacturing industry within Georgia 
and support our manufacturers to be glob-
ally competitive. The competitiveness legis-
lation under negotiation will propel our ef-
forts even further. I urge Congress to come 
to a final agreement, which includes these 
important manufacturing and supply chain 
provisions, and swiftly enact this crucial leg-
islation. I want to reiterate my appreciation 
for your work to support the manufacturing 
and innovation industries in Georgia and I 
would be happy to answer any questions you 
or your office may have. 
Sincerely, 
TIMOTHY D. ISRAEL, 
Director, Georgia Institute of 
Technology—Georgia Manufacturing 
Extension Partnership.

TRIBUTE TO KAREN FISHER 
Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I am 
honored to recognize Karen Fisher for 
her decades of leadership toward inno-
vation and systematic change to im-
prove the health of Americans. Karen 
may be retiring from a momentous 
health policy career, but the Nation 
will long feel the positive impact of her 
work. 
From 2011 to 2016, the Senate Finance 
Committee was fortunate to benefit 
from Karen’s expertise on the Medicare 
program and other key health policy 
issues. Serving as senior health coun-
sel, Karen led the committee’s work in 
2015 to permanently repeal the out-
dated and flawed sustainable growth 
rate—SGR—formula previously used to 
determine 
Medicare 
physician 
pay-
ments and to replace it with a new pay-
ment system that advances value-based 
care for the millions who rely on the 
Medicare program as a lifeline. 
In addition to her historic role in 
permanently retiring the SGR, Karen 
oversaw legislative activities related 
to the Center for Medicare and Med-
icaid Innovation—CMMI—and the Pa-
tient-Centered Outcomes Research In-
stitute—PCORI—as she uplifted the 
transformative effect alternative pay-
ment models could have in driving 
greater commitments to quality and 
value in healthcare. She also served— 
and continues to serve—as a mentor to 
early-career staff on the Committee 
and across Capitol Hill, offering profes-
sional guidance and networking oppor-
tunities for the next generation of fe-
male leaders. 
At the Association of American Med-
ical Colleges—AAMC—Karen has con-
tinued her commitment to improve 
healthcare 
through 
public 
policy. 
Throughout her nearly 6 years as chief 
public policy officer, the AAMC has 
been an important voice on the need to 
expand access to healthcare nationwide 
by 
strengthening 
coverage 
through 
both the Affordable Care Act and the 
Medicaid program and by addressing 
shortages 
of 
physicians 
and 
other 
health professionals. 
Her more than 25 years of experience 
also have been an essential asset dur-
ing the COVID pandemic, as she liaised 
between Federal policymakers and the 
academic medicine community to sup-
port the heroic efforts of the country’s 
health professionals and scientists in 
treating patients, expanding access to 
telehealth, 
developing 
and 
admin-
istering COVID tests, advancing re-
search on new countermeasures, devel-
oping and deploying vaccines, and en-
hancing health equity interventions. 
I know that I speak for health policy 
professionals nationwide as I express 
my gratitude for Karen’s dedication, 
talent, mentorship, leadership, and per-
sistence in public service and in better-
ment of the Nation’s health. 
Thank you, Karen. I am wishing you 
and your family all the best for a very 
well-deserved retirement.

TRIBUTE TO ACKLEY PADILLA 
Mr. PADILLA. Mr. President, I rise 
to proudly recognize the outstanding 
public service of Ackley Padilla, my 
brother, who is retiring after nearly 
two decades of helping to lead the city 
of Los Angeles. 
Ackley is a proud son of Pacoima, 
CA—and I know that Pacoima takes in-
credible pride in him. Ackley, my sis-
ter Julie, and I all learned to value 
public service from our parents, Santos 
and Lupe Padilla. Ackley made his ca-
reer serving the people of the San Fer-
nando Valley while working for a num-
ber of local elected officials. 
Ackley worked for the first Latino 
and the first Latina presidents of the 
Los Angeles City Council. And, yes, 
that means that I was once his boss. 
For the past 9 years, he has worked for 
council president Nury Martinez. As 
her chief of staff, he has been crucial to 
Los Angeles’s response to the COVID– 
19 pandemic, including getting testing 
and vaccination sites up and running, 
as well as food distribution sites and 
other assistance for families in need. 
In addition to his public service, 
Ackley is a passionate fan of the An-
gels and the Clippers—and known hater 
of the Lakers and the Dodgers. He 
clearly followed his father instead of 
his brother on those decisions. Ackley 
is a proud dad to three wonderful 
girls—Kaylyn, Kathryn and Khloey— 
and a proud handyman. He has come to 
love his minivan, ‘‘Pony Boy,’’ and will 
surely drive into many adventures in 
the years ahead. 
The people of Pacoima, the San Fer-
nando Valley, and all of Los Angeles 
have benefited from Ackley’s public

TRIBUTE TO CAMILLE PEASE 
Mr. KING. Mr. President, as most of 
us here in the Senate know, this Cham-
ber functions with a dedicated and able 
staff to support us. Because we are a 
relatively small body that has to over-
see the actions of the far larger execu-
tive branch, we rely on specialists de-
tailed from other Agencies throughout 
the government. It is really a two-way 
deal. When they come here, they learn 
about the intricacies of the legislative 
process and get to participate in it. In 
return, we benefit from their years of 
experience in the Agency they come 
from. 
In my case as chairman of the Stra-
tegic Forces Subcommittee of the Sen-
ate Armed Services Committee, we 
rely on the Government Accountability 
Office or GAO staff who specialize in 
nuclear and space systems to help us 
on the programmatic details of a mul-
titude of programs in the Department 
of Energy and Defense, and every year, 
the committee sponsors one of them to 
spend a year with us. 
For the past year, we were fortunate 
enough to have Ms. Camille Pease with 
us from the GAO as our detailee, and 
now, her year is up, and she is heading 
back. 
Because of the way the Armed Serv-
ices Committee works in preparing for 
a markup, members such as myself and 
Senator FISCHER, our ranking member 
on the subcommittee, spend a tremen-
dous amount of time with staff, includ-
ing Cami, on hearings and briefings in 
order to build a legislative record and 
develop legislation for our annual 
markup of the National Defense Au-
thorization Act, or NDAA. In every as-
pect, Cami was there to enrich us with 
her expertise on the National Nuclear 
Security Administration. In return, I 
hope she is wiser on how we work in 
this Chamber, and in the Armed Serv-
ices Committee in particular, on a bi-
partisan legislative process that has 
managed to produce a NDAA for the 
past 61 years. 
So we thank you, Cami, for spending 
time with us, and we wish you the best 
on your return to the GAO. We hope 
your time with us will help you in the 
years to come. I hope you take back to 
the GAO that, when it comes to the na-
tional security of this nation, and the 
NDAA in particular, this Chamber does 
work in a bipartisan and productive 
fashion, and it is my hope it will con-
tinue to do so in the years to come.

ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS 
RECOGNIZING THE NORTH GREEN-
VILLE UNIVERSITY CRUSADERS 
∑ Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise 
today to commend the North Green-
ville 
University 
Crusaders 
baseball 
team for winning the 2022 NCAA Base-
ball Division II National Champion-
ship. 
The Crusaders outscored their four 
World Series opponents by a combined 
34–12. Their victory earned the program 
its first national championship and 
marked the second Conference Caro-
linas baseball team to win the title. 
Throughout the season, Landon Pow-
ell, head coach of the Crusaders, was 
consistently a role model to the play-
ers. When he was hired in 2014, the Cru-
saders were 8–35 and had three and one- 
half scholarship players. Coach Powell 
turned the team around and guided 
them to a 29–25 winning record in his 
first year; since then, the Crusaders 
have consistently averaged more than 
41 wins per season. 
On the field, Jax Cash went three for 
four at the plate and drove in the final 
run of the game. Reece Fields pitched 
5.0 innings, allowing one run on six 
hits, three walks, eight strikeouts, and 
was named the tournament MVP. Nate 
Roof pitched 3.0 innings, allowing no 
runs, two hits, and a walk. The entire 
team should be proud of their hard 
work and accomplishments. The North 
Greenville baseball team displayed out-
standing 
dedication 
and 
teamwork 
throughout the season and brought 
pride to the State of South Carolina. 
The university, under the leadership of 
Dr. Gene C. Fant, Jr., and Coach Pow-
ell, has much to be proud of, and I look 
forward to another great season by the 
Crusaders. 
I ask that our colleagues join me in 
congratulating the North Greenville 
University Crusaders baseball team for 
winning the 2022 NCAA Baseball Divi-
sion II National Championship.∑

TRIBUTE TO RON NUTZ 
∑ Mr. MARSHALL. Mr. President, I 
rise today to recognize and thank Mr. 
Ron Nutz of Haddam, KS. 
Last September, I traveled to Wash-
ington County and met many out-
standing Kansans, amongst them was 
Mr. Ron Nutz. Ron is responsible for 
spearheading the construction of the 
Mark Nutsch Horse Soldier Monument 
and the 9/11 Memorial in Washington 
County, KS. Mark Nutsch served as a 
Ranger in the Army and as a special 
forces officer, deploying on multiple 
combat tours. Shortly following the 9/ 
11 attacks on our country, he led his 
team into northern Afghanistan and 
fought against the Taliban and al- 
Qaeda, much of the time on horseback. 
I would like to thank Ron for the 
work he has done towards the comple-
tion of this project. The monument 
will depict a soldier on horseback and 
will also incorporate the stone, lapis 
lazuli, which is found throughout Af-
ghanistan. The groundbreaking cere-
mony will be held on June 27. 
I now ask my colleagues to join me 
in recognizing Mr. Ron Nutz for all of 
his hard work, as well as in wishing 
him nothing but success in the future.∑ 
TRIBUTE TO DALE W. MOORE 
∑ Mr. MORAN. Mr. President, I would 
like to recognize Dale W. Moore for 
dedicating more than 40 years of his 
professional life to being a champion 
for agriculture in the public and pri-
vate sector. 
For the past 10 years, Dale has served 
farmers and ranchers as a leader at the 
American Farm Bureau Federation, 
first as executive director, public pol-
icy, then vice president, public affairs, 
and finally spending the past 4 years of 
his career serving as the executive vice 
president. 
Dale served as chief of staff at the 
U.S. Department of Agriculture under 
four Secretaries of Agriculture, served 
as legislative director for the House 
Agriculture Committee, and as a legis-
lative assistant for then-Representa-
tive Pat Roberts, who represented the 
‘‘Big First’’ district of Kansas. 
Dale’s Kansas roots run deep. He is a 
native of Copeland, KS, with a popu-
lation of approximately 250 people. 
Dale grew up on a livestock, hay, and 
grain farm, where he learned firsthand 
the intricacies of agriculture, the value 
of hard work, and fostered an apprecia-
tion of rural America that he carried 
with him throughout his entire career. 
Dale received a bachelor of science in 
animal science and biology from Fort 
Hays 
State 
University, 
located 
in 
Hays, KS, where he participated in ac-
tivities such as Rodeo Club, Block and 
Bridle Club, and Delta Tau Alpha. 
In all of his roles throughout his il-
lustrious career, Dale earned a reputa-
tion that continues with him today as 
a mentor, problem solver, counselor, 
and storyteller whose commitment sets 
a shining example for policymakers 
across the political spectrum. Dale has 
not only been an advocate for farmers 
and ranchers, but has contributed to 
the strength of American farm and 
ranch families, serving as a trusted 
friend and advisor to many. 
On behalf of this body, the U.S. Sen-
ate, it my honor to recognize and 
thank Dale W. Moore for his dedication 
to agriculture and service to the Amer-
ican Farm Bureau Federation, U.S. De-
partment of Agriculture, and Congress 
and to congratulate him on his retire-
ment.∑

CENTENNIAL OF DAVIESS COUNTY 
FARM BUREAU 
∑ Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, today I 
want to honor the 100th anniversary of 
the founding of the Daviess County 
Farm Bureau. Established in 1922 by a 
handful of people, the Daviess County 
Farm Bureau quickly grew to include 
approximately 100 farmers. With mem-
bership dues of only $2, the organiza-
tion was forced to meet wherever it 
could: the courthouse, the rural elec-
tric office, and even members’ homes. 
It was in these early meetings that the 
Daviess County Farm Bureau first 
dedicated itself to advocacy on behalf

of farmers, and soon after, the organi-
zation began lobbying in the Common-
wealth’s capital for the electrification 
of rural Daviess County. 
In its early years, the Daviess Coun-
ty Farm Bureau supported the commu-
nity through disaster and development. 
In response to the flood of 1937, the or-
ganization provided support to the 
local hospital, fire department, and 
Red Cross. The organization took on 
local issues; this included conducting a 
study to establish a tobacco warehouse 
and assessing warehouse charges re-
lated to the sale of tobacco. Daviess 
County Farm Bureau also established a 
food locker refrigerating and proc-
essing plant, formed a committee to 
head a funding drive—which ultimately 
raised a total of $23,669—for Kentucky 
Wesleyan College, and started a suc-
cessful newsletter in the ‘‘Messenger 
Inquirer’’. In response to the outbreak 
of the COVID–19 pandemic, the Daviess 
County Farm Bureau partnered with 
River Valley Behavioral Health to cre-
ate the ‘‘You’re Not Alone’’ campaign, 
which sought to bring mental health 
awareness to rural communities. 
Today, after a century of service to 
Daviess County, the Commonwealth of 
Kentucky, and farmers everywhere, the 
Daviess County Farm Bureau con-
tinues to serve as ‘‘The Voice for Agri-
culture.’’ By lobbying the county, 
State, and Federal governments, the 
Daviess County Farm Bureau ensures 
that the needs of its membership are 
communicated to and considered by 
elected officials. Daviess County Farm 
Bureau is also active in the Kentucky 
Farm Bureau and American Farm Bu-
reau. 
In addition to its advocacy efforts, 
the Daviess County Farm Bureau still 
supports a number of local programs 
and organizations. These include 4–H 
clubs, Future Farmers of America 
chapters, and local schools and teach-
ers that incorporate agriculture edu-
cation in the classroom. The organiza-
tion also sponsors the Annual Farm 
Expo, the Farm-City Breakfast, and 
the annual Rooster Booster Breakfast 
hosted 
by 
the 
Greater 
Owensboro 
Chamber of Commerce. Daviess County 
Farm Bureau is also responsible for ad-
ministering several programs offered 
by the Kentucky Farm Bureau, includ-
ing the Institute for Future Agricul-
tural Leaders—IFAL—the Leadership 
Enhancement for Agricultural Devel-
opment program, and college scholar-
ship programs. 
A dedication to advocating on behalf 
of farmers and a love of community 
have defined the first 100 years of the 
Daviess County Farm Bureau’s history. 
In celebrating this momentous mile-
stone, we also cast a hopeful eye to-
ward the future. I have no doubt that 
the Daviess County Farm Bureau will 
play an integral role in shaping that 
future.∑

RECOGNIZING SIMON’S SHOES 
∑ Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, as ranking 
member of the Senate Committee on 
Small Business and Entrepreneurship, 
each week I recognize an outstanding 
Kentucky small business that exempli-
fies the American entrepreneurial spir-
it. This week, it is my privilege to rec-
ognize Simon’s Shoes of Henderson, 
KY, as the Senate Small Business of 
the Week. 
Operating a small business requires 
unparalleled commitment and perse-
verance, traits that have been inher-
ited to each successive generation of 
the Simon Family. Jacob Simon immi-
grated to Henderson, KY, from Lith-
uania in 1910, following his two broth-
ers who made Henderson their new 
home years prior. He began as a ped-
dler selling merchandise across the 
county, but at times found it difficult 
to attract clients due to his lack of 
English. Insistent on improving his 
craft, Jacob developed a sense of trust 
with the locals as his career as a ped-
dler led him to become a steadfast 
member of the community. As such, it 
did not take long for Jacob to embrace 
Henderson as his home. In the fol-
lowing years, Jacob mastered English, 
became 
an 
American 
citizen, 
and 
opened Simon’s Shoes in January 1919. 
In addition to footwear, Simon’s 
Shoes offered a diverse array of cloth-
ing, and the store quickly became 
known for carrying any type of gar-
ment one could desire, from suits to 
base layers. His childhood in Lithuania 
and initial years in America had 
taught Jacob key principles of saving 
and being conservative with money, 
which were integral to the success of 
his business and the store’s ability to 
survive the Great Depression. When Ja-
cob’s son, Larry, became involved in 
the family business, they decided to 
narrow the focus of the store to spe-
cialize in shoes. 
As the store continued to flourish, 
Larry, who eventually took ownership 
of the business, was able to purchase 
the former J.C. Penny building next 
door and use this space for the store’s 
inventory. The decades of success made 
Simon’s Shoes a destination for people 
across the State and beyond. To this 
day, 
residents 
from 
Evansville, 
Owensboro, Louisville, St. Louis, as 
well as tourists traveling along the 
Ohio River make the journey to visit 
Simon’s Shoes. Customers are continu-
ously attracted by their wide range of 
shoes, inclusive of varying sizes and 
widths, and their benefits as a full- 
service store. 
Three generations of the Simon fam-
ily have been involved in the oper-
ations of Simon’s Shoes, the latest 
Simon to take the reins being Larry’s 
son Bruce Simon. Even as the store 
passes down through the successive 
generations, the Simons remain active 
members of the business for as long as 
possible. In 1975, then 85-year-old Jake 
Simon 
told 
local 
newspaper 
‘‘The 
Gleaner’’, ‘‘When I draw my last 
breath, that store will be in my con-
sciousness.’’ Likewise, Larry continues 
to visit Simon’s Shoes often, stating 
that he would be in the store up to 6 
days a week for several hours each day 
at 84 years of age. The Simons’ passion 
for their business has grown into a 
now-century long catalyst for its suc-
cess, as the store that once occupied a 
fraction of the building on First and 
Main Street now consists of three 
buildings on the same corner. Con-
gratulations to the entire Simon fam-
ily and to the whole team at Simon’s 
Shoes. I look forward to seeing their 
continued growth and success in Ken-
tucky.∑

REMEMBERING REGINALD M. 
FELTON 
∑ Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Mr. President, I 
rise to honor the life of a dedicated 
public servant and a champion for edu-
cation: Mr. Reginald ‘‘Reggie’’ M. 
Felton from my State of Maryland. Our 
community lost Reggie only a few days 
ago, at the age of 75. Today, I would 
like to take a moment to celebrate his 
extraordinary life and pay tribute to 
his lasting legacy of good works. 
The story of Reggie’s life can be de-
fined by one word: service. He served 
our Nation in the military as a member 
of the U.S. Coast Guard and, later, as a 
Senior Executive within the Depart-
ment of the Navy. He served his town 
and county as president of a local citi-
zens association, as chair of the Silver 
Spring Center Citizens Advisory Board, 
and as chairman of the Freedom Fund 
Dinner organized by the Montgomery 
County Branch of the NAACP. 
But most of all, Reggie served our 
students. With the trust of his commu-
nity behind him, Reggie won a seat on 
the Montgomery County Board of Edu-
cation in 1994. He would serve on the 
board for another 20 years, winning re-
election in 1998 and 2002 and rising to 
become 
the 
first 
African-American 
president of the Montgomery County 
Board of Education, a position he held 
for three terms. 
Reggie’s commitment to the mission 
and spirit of the school board led to 
real results during his tenure. The 
Montgomery 
County 
School 
Board 
earned national recognition for excel-
lence while Reggie served on the board, 
and it is no wonder why. Under his 
leadership, the Montgomery County 
Public Schools, which make up the 
largest school district in my State, saw 
major improvements in the quality of 
education and in the process for select-
ing and onboarding superintendents. 
Reggie also focused his efforts on es-
tablishing higher standards in cur-
riculum, and those higher standards 
continue to inform a tradition of excel-
lence at Montgomery County Public 
Schools that lives on to this day. In 
short: Reggie’s time as president of the 
Montgomery 
County 
School 
Board 
helped 
make 
Montgomery 
County 
schools some of the best in the Nation. 
Throughout his extraordinary life, 
Reggie Felton nurtured his talent for 
leadership, stepped up to serve his com-
munity and his country, and did all 
that he could to improve the lives of

his fellow citizens. He was beloved by 
all—respected across our communities 
for his kindness, his good humor, his 
brilliance, and his grace. 
On a personal note, Reggie was a 
good friend whom I admired greatly. I 
will always remember his warm and 
generous spirit, his wonderful smile, 
and his determination to serve others. 
I know I speak for Marylanders every-
where when I say our State is eternally 
grateful for his service and sacrifice. 
Today, Reggie’s legacy lives on in 
every young student who benefits from 
his good deeds—whether they know it 
or not—and his story will continue to 
inspire us all. Thank you, Reggie. We 
love you.∑

STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED 
BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS 
By Ms. HIRONO: 
S. 4464. A bill to authorize the Sec-
retary of the Interior to conduct a 
study to assess the suitability and fea-
sibility of designating certain land as 
the Kaena Point National Heritage 
Area, and for other purposes; to the 
Committee on Energy and Natural Re-
sources. 
Ms. HIRONO. Mr. President, I rise 
today to introduce a bill, the Kaena 
Point National Heritage Area Act. This 
bill requires the Secretary of the Inte-
rior to conduct a study to assess the 
suitability and feasibility of desig-
nating certain land in Hawaii as the 
Kaena Point National Heritage Area. 
Such a designation would bring Federal 
resources to bear on elevating public 
awareness of Kaena Point through in-
creased interpretation and enhanced 
management activities to protect re-
sources, both cultural and natural, for 
future generations. 
The National Park Service currently 
oversees 55 National Heritage Areas 
across the country, none of which are 
in Hawaii. Kaena Point, located on the 
westernmost tip of Oahu, is home to 
some of the last remaining unimproved 
semiwilderness areas on Oahu and one 
of the last intact dune ecosystems in 
Hawaii. Native species such as criti-
cally endangered Hawaiian monk seals, 
humpback whales, spinner dolphins, 
and green sea turtles can be found in 
the waters at Kaena Point. Native 
shorebirds such as albatrosses and 
shearwaters also frequent Kaena Point 
to nest. In addition, the area is one of 
the last remaining examples of intact 
coastal strand vegetation on Oahu and 
is home to a number of endangered 
plant species and the endangered yel-
low-faced bee. 
Kaena Point is significant to Native 
Hawaiian culture, being deemed one of 
the most sacred places on Oahu as it is 
home to numerous cultural and his-
toric sites. The area currently includes 
a State park and a Natural Area Re-
serve, both operated by the Hawaii De-
partment of Land and Natural Re-
sources. Kaena State Park is the sec-
ond most visited park on Oahu, illus-
trating the significance of the area. 
This bill directs the U.S. Department 
of the Interior Secretary to conduct a 
study in consultation with State and 
local historic preservation officers, 
State and local historical societies, 
State and local tourism offices, and 
other appropriate organizations and 
governmental 
agencies. 
This 
study 
would, among other things, assess the 
area’s unique cultural, historic, and 
natural resources, cultural contribu-
tions to the story of the United States,

cational opportunities, resources avail-
able for interpretation by visitors, in-
clusion

portive of and involved with the plan-
ning of the Heritage Area, existence of 
a local management entity willing to 
work with these stakeholders to de-
velop the Heritage Area, and include a 
map identifying the boundaries of the 
Heritage Area. 
The Secretary of the Interior is given 
3 years to conduct the study and report 
the results to Congress. Information 
from that report will then indicate if 
Kaena Point is a suitable location to be 
added as a National Heritage Area and 
if so, the boundaries for such a designa-
tion. This bill is supported by the Ha-
waii Department of Land and Natural 
Resources. 
By Mr. REED (for himself and 
Mr. KING): 
S. 4478. A bill to provide for assist-
ance to improve the resilience of his-
toric light stations, to study the long- 
term protection needs of historic light 
stations, and to establish a national 
database of historic light stations, and 
for other purposes; to the Committee 
on Environment and Public Works. 
Mr. REED. Mr. President, today I am 
introducing the Historic Lighthouse 
Resiliency Act with Senator KING. This 
legislation would authorize the Army 
Corps of Engineers to partner with 
State, local, and nonprofit organiza-
tions, which own and operate historic 
light stations, to improve lighthouse 
resiliency and ensure continued public 
access to these valuable landmarks. 
Our Nation’s historic lighthouses are 
important parts of communities across 
the country and our maritime history. 
They serve as beacons of history, edu-
cation, recreation, and often are asso-
ciated with the unique character and 
identity of a community. Yet these his-
toric structures are facing increased 
risk for catastrophic damage due to sea 
level rise, flooding, and aging infra-
structure. 
Indeed, in my State of Rhode Island, 
these historic lighthouses are inter-
woven in the fabric of our communities 
and our State’s history. Rhode Island 
was home to perhaps the most famous 
lighthouse 
keeper 
in 
history, 
Ida 
Lewis. During her tenure as the Keeper 
of Lime Rock Lighthouse, Ida Lewis 
rescued at least 18 people and earned 
the title of ‘‘Bravest Woman in Amer-
ica.’’ Beavertail, Watch Hill, and Cas-
tle Hill Lighthouses, just to name a 
few of the 21 lighthouses remaining in 
my State, are iconic structures dotting 
the Rhode Island shoreline. 
These historic landmarks must be 
protected and preserved for future gen-
erations. This bill would allow the 
Army Corps of Engineers to conduct 
projects that restore damaged light-
houses and increase their future resil-
iency to the adverse effects of climate 
change, including sea level rise and se-
vere weather events. To conduct re-
pairs and other improvements, the 
Army Corps would partner with public 
or nonprofit entities that have ac-
quired light stations through convey-
ance 
under 
the 
National 
Historic 
Lighthouse Preservation Act. Addi-
tionally, it would require the Army 
Corps to conduct an assessment and 
maintain a database of all lighthouses 
nationwide. 
Congress has already recognized the 
importance of preserving these struc-
tures and ensuring public access in the 
National Historic Lighthouse Preserva-
tion Act of 2000. However, these his-
toric light stations must not only have 
the appropriate caretakers but must 
also have the appropriate funding to 
invest in infrastructure needs. Federal 
investment in lighthouse resiliency re-
quirements will ensure they are main-
tained and accessible for future genera-
tions. 
I urge my colleagues to join us in 
supporting this commonsense legisla-
tion. 
By Mr. PADILLA (for himself, 
Mrs. FEINSTEIN, Ms. WARREN, 
Mr. BLUMENTHAL, Mr. BOOKER, 
Mr. 
SANDERS, 
Ms. 
CORTEZ 
MASTO, Mr. WYDEN, Mr. VAN 
HOLLEN, Ms. KLOBUCHAR, Mr. 
BROWN, and Mr. MARKEY): 
S. 4480. A bill to amend the Fair 
Labor Standards Act of 1938 to provide 
increased labor law protections for ag-
ricultural workers, and for other pur-
poses; to the Committee on Health, 
Education, Labor, and Pensions. 
Mr. PADILLA. Mr. President, I rise 
to speak in support of the Fairness for 
Farmworkers Act, which I introduced 
today. 
Throughout the ongoing COVID–19 
pandemic, farmworkers continued to 
keep our country going. This was espe-
cially true in California—the agricul-
tural heart of the Nation. California is 
the most successful State in agricul-
tural production and has the largest 
population of farmworkers. In fact, 
more than one-third of our country’s 
vegetables and two-thirds of fruits and 
nuts come from California. 
During a time of incredible hardship, 
farmworkers put food on the tables of 
millions of Americans despite working 
in extreme conditions and facing deep- 
rooted inequities in the workforce. The 
time to address these inequities is now. 
While the 1938 Fair Labor Standards 
Act established Federal standards for 
minimum wage and overtime pay, the 
law excluded millions of domestic and 
agricultural workers, who were over-
whelmingly people of color. 
In 2016, California recognized the 
need to provide farmworkers with over-
time protections. The California over-
time law, which ensures farmworkers 
have an equal right to overtime pay, is 
a model for this Federal bill. 
Farmworkers 
in 
California 
and 
across the Nation deserve an end to 
discrimination in labor laws. As we 
work to rebuild from the pandemic, we 
must also undo the discriminatory ex-
clusion of farmworkers by amending 
the Fair Labor Standards Act. 
That is why I am proud to introduce 
this bill, which will improve the lives 
of farmworkers and their families, cre-
ate equity in our food system, and ben-
efit farming communities as the in-
creased wages are spent in local busi-
nesses. 
This bill will gradually implement 
overtime pay over the course of 4 years 
and bring greater equity to the Amer-
ican agricultural industry and greater 
prosperity to historically marginalized 
workers. 
This legislation will also boost farm-
ing community economies as increased 
wages are spent in local businesses. 
I want to thank Representative GRI-
JALVA for joining me in introducing 
this bill, and I hope our colleagues will 
join us in support of this bill that 
would provide a measure of long over-
due fairness for our Nation’s farm-
workers. 
Mr. PADILLA. Mr. President, the 
first thing you need to know about 
picking radishes is that it is hard 
work. You have to work literally on 
your knees, and you pick each radish 
out of the ground by hand—no ma-
chines, no tools. 
I learned how to pick radishes and 
parsley about 3 weeks ago when I re-
ceived an invitation from the United 
Farm Workers and the UFW Founda-
tion to spend a day working alongside 
them in California. 
Now, I have said countless times 
that, day in and day out, farmworkers 
show up to some of the hardest jobs in 
America. I have always believed that 
farmworkers are essential, but not 
until that day did I appreciate the 
physical demands of long hours on 
one’s knees under the Sun. 
Many of the workers picking radishes 
are older than I am and have worked in 
the fields for decades. They have la-
bored through heat waves, through 
storms, wildfire smoke, and more. 
They have labored through a global 
health pandemic, and they are the 
backbone of our economy in helping to 
keep food on our tables. Yet the major-
ity of farmworkers don’t have legal 
status to live and work in the United 
States of America. That includes those 
I worked alongside who were picking 
radishes—people like Efren, who has 
worked on American farms for more 
than 40 years, and Patricia, who has 
raised her children here. 
Several of them told me that one of 
the hardest parts of being undocu-
mented was being cut off from their 
families in Mexico or in other coun-
tries, being denied the opportunity of 
seeing their mothers or their fathers 
one last time before passing away or 
being able to attend their funerals to 
pay their last respects. 
Imagine that heartbreaking choice of 
never seeing your parents again be-
cause doing so means risking not being 
able to see your children ever again. 
That is the fate that we are forcing on 
countless undocumented farmworkers 
who fill our grocery stores with fruits 
and vegetables. This is the choice that

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S3164 
June 23, 2022 
we exacerbate every time we push im-
migration 
reform 
off 
for 
another 
month, another year, another session 
of Congress. And this is why we must 
pass legislation that creates a pathway 
to citizenship for farmworkers. 
Did you know that when you pick 
radishes, you get paid by the number of 
crates that you fill? On the day that I 
worked the fields, it comes as no sur-
prise that I picked at a slower rate 
than the highly skilled and experienced 
farmworkers, who depend on speed for 
their livelihoods. 
Yet laws across the country leave 
farmworkers in a position of uncer-
tainty that few other workers have to 
face. If you are a farmworker and you 
miss a day of work, there is no paid 
sick leave. If you are a farmworker and 
you are injured on the job, you can’t 
get disability insurance. And living and 
working while undocumented means 
worrying constantly about your status. 
So when the Senate says that immi-
gration reform can wait, we are not 
seeing the people whose lives are at 
stake: 
Isidro, 
Armando, 
Isabel, 
Epigemio. As they pick radishes, these 
workers are not taking jobs from 
American citizens. I repeat: They are 
not taking the jobs of American citi-
zens. In fact, the opposite is true. We 
don’t have enough farmworkers to 
meet the demand, not just for radishes 
but for countless other crops. As dif-
ferent produce comes into season, 
growers need skilled labor on tight 
timelines. 
Corporate leaders, small business 
owners, and economists agree that we 
need more immigrants with more pro-
tections. The stakes for our economy 
are high. Right now, American families 
are paying higher prices not just at the 
gas pump but at the grocery store. Our 
labor shortage is contributing to high-
er inflation. Over $1 trillion of Amer-
ica’s GDP is linked to agriculture. 
All across the Nation, we rely on im-
migrant farmworkers. In North Caro-
lina, agriculture is the top industry, 
aided by tens of thousands of undocu-
mented workers in growing soybean, 
corn, and peanuts. In Idaho, agri-
culture accounts for 17 percent of the 
economic output, including a booming 
dairy industry. Around 90 percent of 
Idaho’s dairy workers are foreign born, 
the vast majority undocumented. In 
Texas, agriculture is worth more than 
$20 billion each year. More than 100,000 
immigrant workers, mostly undocu-
mented, 
are 
employed 
on 
Texas’s 
ranches, farms, and fields. 
I can go on and on, but I think the 
point is clear: This is truly a national 
issue. The majority of all farmworkers 
lack legal status, and growers say that 
more help is needed. 
Congress can make a difference. We 
can do so by passing the laws that 
farmworkers need and deserve. Our 
country cannot afford to wait. That is 
why it was the first bill I introduced— 
the Citizenship for Essential Workers 
Act—when I joined the Senate last 
year. I am talking about the workers 
who keep us healthy and safe and fed, 
the workers we as the Federal Govern-
ment have deemed to be essential. 
They deserve dignity; they deserve re-
spect; and they have earned a pathway 
to citizenship. 
Today, I am also proud to introduce 
the Fairness for Farmworkers Act. 
This bill will support fair pay for agri-
cultural workers under the Fair Labor 
Standards Act. 
In 1 day, I had just a small dose of 
the physically demanding life of a 
farmworker. Still, there is so much 
more that I could tell you about the 
kind, 
funny, 
generous 
individuals 
whom I worked alongside that day. 
As we shared a lunch of homemade 
tortillas, beans, and carne con chiles, 
they told me about their hometowns 
that they miss, their favorite music, 
and their dreams for their children. 
They had one more message that they 
asked me to deliver, that they im-
plored me to deliver to all of you, and 
that is that you should come too. I was 
the first U.S. Senator to accept an in-
vitation to work in the fields. Last 
week, my friend and colleague Senator 
BOOKER became the second. 
I urge you, each and every Member of 
the Senate, to take this opportunity, 
take a day to work alongside the he-
roes who feed America, and then come 
back here, as I have, humbled and in-
spired to do our job. Let’s come to-
gether behind a solution so farm-
workers can finally live and work with 
dignity and security. 
By Mr. PADILLA (for himself and 
Mrs. FEINSTEIN): 
S. 4482. A bill to help persons in the 
United States experiencing homeless-
ness and significant behavioral health 
issues, including substance use dis-
orders, by authorizing a grant program 
within the Department of Housing and 
Urban Development to assist State and 
local 
governments, 
Continuums 
of 
Care, community-based organizations 
that administer both health and home-
lessness services, and providers of serv-
ices to people experiencing homeless-
ness, better coordinate health care and 
homelessness services, and for other 
purposes; to the Committee on Bank-
ing, Housing, and Urban Affairs. 
Mr. PADILLA. Mr. President, I rise 
to speak in support of the Helping Peo-
ple Experiencing Substance Use Dis-
order and Homelessness Act, which I 
introduced today. 
Housing is a fundamental social de-
terminant of health, and unhoused in-
dividuals are often the victims of stark 
health disparities. Of the more than 
580,000 people experiencing homeless-
ness in the United States, an estimated 
20 percent have a substance use and/or 
a 
mental 
health 
disorder. 
Mental 
health concerns, including substance 
use disorders, can cause and exacerbate 
homelessness. 
A lack of affordable housing is the 
primary driver of homelessness, and we 
are working to address this issue. An-
other piece of the puzzle is to ensure 
housing and social service providers 
have the resources to work together to 
ensure access to supportive services. 
That is why I am proud to introduce 
this bill to provide essential funding 
and tools for frontline organizations to 
coordinate health and homelessness 
services. 
If enacted, it will create a Federal

(4) sex-based harassment, including sexual 
harassment and assault, dating violence, do-
mestic violence, and sex-based stalking; 
Whereas since 1972, the United States has 
made great progress in providing educational 
opportunities to women and girls and, in 
2022, women earned the majority of doctoral, 
master’s, and associate degrees; 
Whereas in the 2020–2021 academic year, 
women earned approximately 60 percent of 
the bachelor’s degrees awarded by institu-
tions of higher education in the United 
States; 
Whereas since 1972, the participation of 
women and girls in sports has increased by 
1,057 percent in high school and greater than 
600 percent in college, providing women and 
girls with the opportunity— 
(1) to develop leadership and teamwork 
skills; 
(2) to earn athletic scholarships to help fi-
nance a college degree; and 
(3) to become successful professional ath-
letes; 
Whereas despite the progress that has been 
made in higher education and athletics, 
women, girls, pregnant or parenting stu-
dents, 
and 
lesbian, 
gay, 
bisexual, 
transgender, queer, intersex, and gender non- 
conforming (LGBTQI+) individuals in the 
United States are still frequently denied 
equal educational opportunities; 
Whereas pregnant and parenting students 
are more likely to drop out of high school 
compared to other students, only 50 percent 
of teenage mothers earn a high school di-
ploma by the age of 22, 38 percent of Black 
teen mothers and 36 percent of Latina teen 
mothers never obtain a diploma or GED, and 
fewer than 2 percent of all teen mothers 
graduate college by age 30, leading to de-
creased opportunities for continuing edu-
cation and employment; 
Whereas a 2018 report from the Govern-
ment Accountability Office found that, com-
pared to White girls, Black girls were 5 times 
more likely and American Indian and Alas-
kan Native girls and multiracial girls were 
nearly 2 and a half times more likely to re-
ceive an out-of-school-suspension; 
Whereas the number of baccalaureate de-
grees in science, technology, engineering, 
and math earned by women has decreased 
over the past decade and, as of the 2019–2020 
academic year, women earn only— 
(1) 39.1 percent of physical science degrees; 
(2) 18.7 percent of computing degrees; 
(3) 20.9 percent of engineering degrees; and 
(4) 42.4 percent of mathematics degrees; 
Whereas despite representing 60 percent of 
all students enrolled in colleges and univer-
sities in the United States, women hold al-
most 2/3 of all outstanding student debt 
($929,000,000,000 of the total $1,762,000,000,000), 
and the average amount of student debt 
owed by a woman following the completion 
of a baccalaureate degree is $2,700 more than 
the average amount of student debt owed by 
a man; 
Whereas men still hold the vast majority 
of leadership positions, while women make 
up approximately— 
(1) 6.4 percent of the chief executive offi-
cers of companies included in the S&P 500; 
(2) 18 percent of Governors; 
(3) 31 percent of executive officers elected 
in statewide elections; and 
(4) 30 percent of college and university 
presidents; 
Whereas 
when 
data 
is 
disaggregated, 
women of color have lower rates of— 
(1) leadership positions; and 
(2) science, technology, engineering, and 
math degrees; 
Whereas despite constituting a majority in 
their field or industry, women remain under-
represented in leadership positions and, for 
example, constitute— 
(1) 50 percent of law school graduates over 
the past 20 years, but only 31 percent of non- 
equity partners and 21 percent of equity 
partners at major law firms; 
(2) 76 percent of the health care workforce, 
but only 27 percent of the chief executive of-
ficers of hospitals; and 
(3) 44 percent of all National Collegiate 
Athletic Association Division I, Division II, 
and Division III student athletes, but only 14 
percent of the athletic directors in Division 
I sports; 
Whereas since the enactment of title IX in 
1972, inequities in participation opportuni-
ties for women and men NCAA athletes have 
persisted, with women having 60,000 fewer 
opportunities than men for the 2020–2021 
school year; 
Whereas women continue to experience 
sexual harassment and assault— 
(1) in elementary and secondary schools; 
(2) at colleges and universities; and 
(3) in the workplace; 
Whereas among individuals in elementary 
or secondary school, 1 in 4 girls will experi-
ence some form of sexual abuse before turn-
ing 18 years old, with more than 50 percent of 
girls in grades 7 through 12 experiencing sex-
ual harassment; 
Whereas multiple studies have confirmed 
that— 
(1) 1 in 5 women and 1 in 4 transgender or 
gender non-conforming students are sexually 
assaulted on college campuses; and 
(2) approximately 20 percent of girls have 
been the victims of sexual assault or at-
tempted sexual assault while in high school; 
Whereas experiencing sexual harassment 
and discrimination can— 
(1) lead to higher rates of depression, anx-
iety, and suicidal ideation; and 
(2) have severe educational and financial 
consequences and negatively impact aca-
demic achievement, including dropping out 
of school; and 
Whereas students face pervasive discrimi-
nation and harassment on the basis of sexual 
orientation and gender identity in school, on 
college campuses, and in the workplace, 
which impedes the ability of the students to 
fully access the educational opportunities to 
which the students are entitled: Now, there-
fore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) applauds the tremendous increase in 
educational opportunities for women and 
girls, including in sports, since the passage 
of title IX of the Education Amendments of 
1972 (20 U.S.C. 1681 et seq.); 
(2) encourages the Department of Edu-
cation and the Department of Justice to pro-
tect the rights of students to have safe learn-
ing environments by working to ensure 
schools prevent and respond to discrimina-
tion and harassment on the basis of sex, in-
cluding based on— 
(A) pregnancy, childbirth, termination of 
pregnancy, and medical conditions related to 
pregnancy, childbirth, and termination of 
pregnancy; 
(B) actual or perceived sexual orientation, 
gender identity, and sex characteristics; 
(C) sex stereotypes; and 
(D) sex-based harassment, including sexual 
harassment, sexual assault, dating violence, 
domestic violence, and sex-based stalking; 
and 
(3) recognizes the work that still remains 
to be done to secure the rights and opportu-
nities guaranteed by title IX of the Edu-
cation Amendments of 1972 (20 U.S.C. 1681 et 
seq.) that no federally funded educational in-
stitution shall discriminate against any indi-
vidual on the basis of sex.

NIZING AND CELEBRATING THE 
50TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE EN-
ACTMENT OF TITLE IX OF THE 
EDUCATION 
AMENDMENTS 
OF 
1972 INTO LAW 
Mrs. BLACKBURN (for herself, Mr. 
WICKER, Ms. ERNST, and Mrs. HYDE- 
SMITH) submitted the following resolu-
tion; which was referred to the Com-
mittee on Health, Education, Labor, 
and Pensions: 
S. RES. 692 
Whereas, on June 23, 1972, President Rich-
ard M. Nixon signed the Education Amend-
ments of 1972 (Public Law 92–318; 86 Stat. 235) 
into law; 
Whereas title IX of the Education Amend-
ments of 1972 (20 U.S.C. 1681 et seq.) is com-
monly referred to and referenced in common 
vernacular as ‘‘title IX’’; 
Whereas title IX originally read, ‘‘No per-
son in the United States shall, based on sex, 
be excluded from participation in, be denied 
the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimi-
nation under any education program or ac-
tivity receiving Federal financial assist-
ance’’; 
Whereas Representatives Patsy T. Mink of 
Hawaii and Edith Green of Oregon and Sen-
ator Birch Bayh of Indiana are recognized as 
the early authors and sponsors of the legisla-
tive proposal that would eventually become 
title IX; 
Whereas, on May 4, 1980, the Department of 
Education began enforcing title IX through 
the creation of the Office for Civil Rights; 
Whereas, on February 26, 1992, in Franklin 
v. Gwinnett County Public Schools, 503 U.S. 
60 (1992), the Supreme Court of the United 
States unanimously ruled that students who 
are subjected to sexual harassment in public 
schools may sue for monetary damages 
under title IX; 
Whereas only 1 in 27 girls participated in 
school sports before title IX was enacted, 
and 2 in 5 girls now participate in school 
sports; 
Whereas, in 1972, 12 percent more men than 
women received college degrees, but today, 
women are more likely than men to receive 
college degrees; and 
Whereas, since title IX became the law of 
the land, women and girls have enjoyed in-
creased access to higher education, gradua-
tion, athletic participation, and overall ad-
vancement in every facet of education: Now, 
therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) recognizes and celebrates the 50th anni-
versary of title IX of the Education Amend-
ments of 1972 on June 23, 2022; 
(2) honors and commemorates the work of 
women’s rights activists who led the fight 
for the equal treatment of men and women 
in education; and 
(3) encourages all women and girls in the 
United States to continue pursuing academic 
and athletic accomplishments, if they so 
choose.

Ms. KLOBUCHAR, Mr. MENENDEZ, Mr. 
VAN
HOLLEN, and Mr. OSSOFF) sub-
mitted the following resolution; which 
was referred to the Committee on the 
Judiciary: 
S. RES. 693 
Whereas spirituals, ragtime, blues, jazz, 
gospel, classical composition, and countless 
other categories of music have been created 
or enhanced by African Americans and are 
etched into the history and culture of the 
United States; 
Whereas the first Africans transported to 
the United States came from a variety of 
ethnic groups with a long history of distinct 
and cultivated musical traditions, brought 
musical instruments with them, and built 
new musical instruments in the United 
States; 
Whereas spirituals were a distinct response 
to the conditions of African slavery in the 
United States and expressed the longing of 
slaves for spiritual and bodily freedom, for 
safety from harm and evil, and for relief 
from the hardships of slavery; 
Whereas jazz, arguably the most creative 
and complex music that the United States 
has produced, combines the musical tradi-
tions of African Americans in New Orleans 
with the creative flexibility of blues music; 
Whereas masterful trumpeters Louis Arm-
strong and Miles Davis achieved national 
and international recognition with the suc-
cess of ‘‘West End Blues’’ by Louis Arm-

Whereas 
in 
the 
1940s,

clubs in Harlem, New York, such as Minton’s 
Playhouse; 
Whereas earlier classical singers such as 
Elizabeth Taylor Greenfield, one of the first 
widely known African-American vocalists, 
and other early African-American singing 
pioneers, including Nellie Mitchell Brown, 
Marie Selika Williams, Rachel Walker Tur-
ner, Marian Anderson, and Flora Batson Ber-
gen, paved the way for the female African- 
American concert singers who have achieved 
great popularity during the last 50 years; 
Whereas the term ‘‘rhythm and blues’’ 
originated in the late 1940s as a way to de-
scribe recordings marketed to African Amer-
icans and replaced the term ‘‘race music’’; 
Whereas lyrical themes in rhythm and 
blues often encapsulate the African-Amer-
ican experience of pain, the quest for free-
dom, joy, triumphs and failures, relation-
ships, economics, and aspiration and were 
popularized by artists such as Ray Charles, 
Ruth Brown, Etta James, and Otis Redding; 
Whereas soul music originated in the Afri-
can-American community in the late 1950s

ists such as Aretha Franklin, James Brown, 
Ray Charles, Sam Cooke, Bill Withers, and 
Jackie Wilson; 
Whereas Motown, founded as a record label

pop and soul musical stylings made popular 
by prominent Black artists such as Marvin

Whereas in the early 1970s, the musical 
style of disco emerged and was popularized 
by programs such as Soul Train and by art-
ists such as Donna Summer; 
Whereas reggae is a genre of music that

incorporates some of the musical elements of 
rhythm and blues, jazz, mento, calypso, and 
African music, and was popularized by art-
ists such as Bob Marley; 
Whereas rock and roll was developed from 
African-American musical styles such as 
gospel and rhythm and blues and was popu-
larized by artists such as Chuck Berry, Bo 
Diddley, Little Richard, and Jimi Hendrix; 
Whereas rap, arguably the most complex 
and influential form of hip-hop culture, com-
bines blues, jazz, and soul and elements of 
the African-American musical tradition with 
Caribbean calypso, dub, and dance hall 
reggae; 
Whereas the development and popularity of 
old-style rap combined confident beats with 
wordplay and storytelling, highlighting the 
struggle of African-American youth growing 
up in underresourced neighborhoods; 
Whereas Dayton, Ohio, known as the ‘‘the 
Land of Funk’’, helped give rise to the genre 
of funk as a mixture of soul, jazz, and 
rhythm and blues and popularized bands 
such as the Ohio Players, Heatwave, Roger 
and Zapp, and Lakeside; 
Whereas contemporary rhythm and blues, 
which originated in the late 1970s and com-
bines elements of pop, rhythm and blues, 
soul, funk, hip hop, gospel, and electronic 
dance music, was popularized by artists such 
as Whitney Houston and Aaliyah;

a wide variety of styles, including funk, 
rock, contemporary rhythm and blues, new 
wave, soul, psychedelia, and pop; 
Whereas the incredible Billie Holiday cre-
ated a cultural reset by recording ‘‘Strange 
Fruit’’, originally a poem that depicted 
lynching in the southern United States, that 
became the first protest song of the civil 
rights era; 
Whereas the talented jazz artist Duke 
Ellington pushed boundaries with his hits 
‘‘It Don’t Mean a Thing if It Ain’t Got That 
Swing’’ and ‘‘Sophisticated Lady’’ and re-
ceived 13 Grammys as well as the Presi-
dential Gold Medal; 
Whereas Sister Rosetta Tharpe, known as 
the Godmother of Rock ‘N Roll, combined 
her distinctive guitar style with melodic 
blues and traditional gospel music that in-
fluenced the likes of Aretha Franklin and 
Chuck Berry; 
Whereas trailblazer Florence Price is the 
first noted African-American female com-
poser to gain national status and the first 
African-American woman to have her com-
posed work performed by a major national 
symphony orchestra; 
Whereas the classical singer Marian Ander-
son broke down racial barriers by performing 
at the Lincoln Memorial in 1939 after being 
denied to sing in front of an integrated audi-
ence at the DAR Constitution Hall in Wash-
ington, D.C.; 
Whereas country music singer Charley 
Pride was inducted into the Country Music 
Hall of Fame in 2000 and has over 40 number 
1 country hits; 
Whereas Nina Simone, one of the most 
prominent and extraordinary soul singers, 
has music spanning over 4 decades that has 
impacted generations with her detailed story 
telling; 
Whereas musician Bobby McFerrin brought

hit ‘‘Don’t Worry Be Happy’’; 
Whereas famous saxophone player John 
Coltrane made his impact on genres like

his work such as ‘‘A Love Supreme’’; 
Whereas musical force Marvin Gaye used 
his versatility as an artist to produce hits 
like ‘‘I Heard It Through the Grapevine’’ and 
‘‘Ain’t No Mountain High Enough’’; 
Whereas a recent study by the Department 
of Education found that only 28 percent of 
African-American students receive any kind 
of arts education; 
Whereas African-American students scored 
the lowest of all ethnicities in the most re-
cent National Assessment for Educational 
Progress arts assessment; 
Whereas students who are eligible for the 
school lunch program established under the 
Richard B. Russell National School Lunch 
Act (42 U.S.C. 1751 et seq.) have significantly 
lower scores on the music portion of the Na-
tional Assessment for Educational Progress 
arts assessment than students who are ineli-
gible for that program, which suggests that 
students in low-income families are dis-
advantaged in the subject of music; 
Whereas a recent study found that— 
(1) nearly 2⁄3 of music ensemble students 
were White and middle class, and only 15 per-
cent of those students were African Amer-
ican; and 
(2) only 7 percent of music teacher licen-
sure candidates were African American; and 
Whereas students of color face many bar-
riers to accessing music education and train-
ing, especially students in large urban public 
schools: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) recognizes— 
(A) the contributions of African Americans 
to the musical heritage of the United States; 
(B) the wide array of talented and popular 
African-American 
musical 
artists, 
com-
posers, songwriters, and musicians who are 
underrecognized for contributions to music; 
(C) the achievements, talent, and hard 
work of African-American pioneer artists 
and the obstacles that those artists over-
came to gain recognition; 
(D) the need for African-American students 
to have greater access to, and participation 
in, music education in schools across the 
United States; and 
(E) Black History Month and African- 
American Music Appreciation Month as an 
important time— 
(i) to celebrate the impact of the African- 
American musical heritage on the musical 
heritage of the United States; and 
(ii) to encourage greater access to music 
education so that the next generation may 
continue to greatly contribute to the musi-
cal heritage of the United States; and 
(2) designates June 2022 as ‘‘African-Amer-
ican Music Appreciation Month’’.

PRESSING 
SUPPORT 
FOR 
THE 
DESIGNATION OF JULY 2022 AS

AWARE-
NESS MONTH’’ 
Mr. JOHNSON submitted the fol-
lowing resolution; which was referred 
to the Committee on Health, Edu-
cation, Labor, and Pensions: 
S. RES. 694 
Whereas sarcoma is a rare cancer of the 
bones or connective tissues, such as nerves, 
muscles, joints, fat, and blood vessels, that 
can arise nearly anywhere in the body; 
Whereas, in the United States— 
(1) about 16,000 individuals are diagnosed 
with sarcoma each year; 
(2) approximately 7,000 individuals die from 
sarcoma each year; and 
(3) about 50,000 individuals struggle with 
sarcoma at any 1 time; 
Whereas, each year, about 1 percent of can-
cers diagnosed in adults and around 20 per-
cent of cancers diagnosed in children are sar-
coma; 
Whereas more than 70 subtypes of sarcoma 
have been identified; 
Whereas the potential causes of sarcoma 
are not well understood; 
Whereas treatment for sarcoma can in-
clude surgery, radiation therapy, or chemo-
therapy; 
Whereas sarcoma is often misdiagnosed 
and underreported; and 
Whereas July 2022 would be an appropriate 
month to designate as National Sarcoma 
Awareness Month— 
(1) to raise awareness about sarcoma; and 
(2) to encourage more individuals in the 
United States to get properly diagnosed and 
treated: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate supports the des-
ignation of July 2022 as ‘‘National Sarcoma

f 
SENATE RESOLUTION 695—DESIG-
NATING 
JUNE 
AS 
‘‘NATIONAL 
ANNUITY AWARENESS MONTH’’ 
Mr. MORAN (for himself and Mr. 
GRASSLEY) submitted the following res-
olution; which was referred to the 
Committee on the Judiciary: 
S. RES. 695 
Whereas annuities provide a predictable 
way to meet immediate, ongoing, and future 
financial obligations and objectives in retire-
ment; 
Whereas surveys consistently indicate that 
the vast majority of individuals in the 
United States are looking for a financial so-
lution that provides the benefits offered by 
annuities, specifically the ability to address 
the critical concern of running out of money 
during retirement; 
Whereas 
outliving 
retirement 
savings 
can— 
(1) create a financial hardship that reduces 
the standard of living in retirement; 
(2) defeat the fulfillment of legacy goals; 
and 
(3) require dependence on family and 
friends for monetary support; 
Whereas millions of individuals in the 
United States currently lack an adequate 
level of guaranteed income in retirement to 
ensure a secure financial future for them-
selves and their loved ones; 
Whereas research indicates that an owner 
of an annuity has a higher confidence in 
overall retirement readiness; 
Whereas an annuity is the only product in 
the financial marketplace that can provide 
guaranteed lifetime income; 
Whereas determining the type of annuity 
to buy and when to take income is one of the 
most important financial decisions a con-
sumer will ever make, and individuals and 
families can benefit greatly from the expert 
guidance of a financial professional; and 
Whereas numerous stakeholders who sup-
port annuities have designated June as ‘‘Na-
tional Annuity Awareness Month’’, the goals 
of which are— 
(1) to educate consumers on annuity bene-
fits; 
(2) to support access to annuities to meet 
the individual financial goals of consumers; 
and 
(3) to encourage savers to seek professional 
guidance to implement annuities effectively 
in income and legacy planning: Now, there-
fore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) designates June as ‘‘National Annuity

COMMITMENT

RE-
BUILDING UKRAINE 
Mr. MANCHIN (for himself, Ms. MUR-
KOWSKI, Ms. HASSAN, Mr. BLUMENTHAL, 
Mr. PORTMAN, and Ms. DUCKWORTH) 
submitted the following resolution; 
which was referred to the Committee 
on Foreign Relations: 
S. RES. 696 
Whereas Vladimir Putin’s invasion of 
Ukraine has generated massive levels of 
human and economic suffering in the sov-
ereign nation of Ukraine; 
Whereas, according to the United Nations 
Human Rights Council, Putin’s war has 
caused more than 7,000,000 civilians to flee 
from Ukraine since February 24, 2022; 
Whereas, according to the World Bank, 
Putin’s war will cause Ukraine’s economy to 
shrink by 45.1 percent during 2022; 
Whereas, according to the World Bank, 
Putin’s war in Ukraine has created almost 
$60,000,000,000 worth of damage to buildings 
and infrastructure; and 
Whereas Ukrainian civilians are being 
killed every day and the true number of 
Ukrainian civilian casualties might never be 
known: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) recognizes that the United States— 
(A) has long sought to alleviate the suf-
fering of civilians and nations hurt by war; 
and 
(B) remains committed to ensuring the 
long-term peace, prosperity, and territorial 
integrity of Ukraine; 
(2) recognizes that aid packages, such as 
the Marshall Plan— 
(A) helped Western Europe recover from 
the economic damage and human suffering 
generated by the World War II; and 
(B) did much to promote the stability of 
global good order nations enjoy today; 
(3) recognizes that an effective Ukrainian 
reconstruction effort can only be accom-
plished by working in concert with other na-
tions and international bodies; and 
(4) encourages the United States Govern-
ment to lead an international group of allies 
that will equitably contribute to provide the 
Government of Ukraine and the Ukrainian 
people with a reconstruction assistance 
package for the purpose of increasing ties be-
tween nations that are seeking a stable 
international order to counter malign and 
rogue actors.

SENATE RESOLUTION 697—DESIG-
NATING JULY 2022 AS ‘‘PLASTIC 
POLLUTION ACTION MONTH’’ 
Mr. MERKLEY submitted the fol-
lowing resolution; which was referred 
to the Committee on the Judiciary: 
S. RES. 697 
Whereas plastic pollution represents a 
global threat that will require individual and 
collective action, both nationally and inter-
nationally, to address; 
Whereas, since the 1950s, over 8,000,000,000 
tons of plastic have been produced world-
wide; 
Whereas, in the United States— 
(1) just 9 percent of plastic waste is sorted 
for recycling; and 
(2) less than 3 percent of plastic waste is 
recycled into a similar quality product; 
Whereas a recent study found that, despite 
the United States only accounting for 4 per-
cent of the global population in 2016, in that 
same year the United States— 
(1) generated 17 percent of all plastic 
waste; and 
(2) ranked third among all countries con-
tributing to coastal plastic pollution; 
Whereas single-use plastics account for at 
least 40 percent of the plastic produced every 
year; 
Whereas over 12,000,000 tons of plastic 
waste enter the ocean every year from land- 
based sources alone; 
Whereas, if no action is taken, the flow of 
plastics into the ocean is expected to triple 
by 2040; 
Whereas studies estimate that there are 
between 15,000,000,000,000 and 51,000,000,000,000 
pieces of plastic in the oceans; 
Whereas, globally, 100,000 marine mammals 
die every year as a result of plastic pollu-
tion; 
Whereas plastics, and associated chemicals 
of plastics, directly impact human health; 
Whereas studies suggest that, every week, 
humans swallow the amount of plastic that 
is in a credit card; 
Whereas taking action to reduce plastic 
use, collect and clean up litter, and reuse 
and recycle more plastics will lead to less 
plastic pollution; 
Whereas, every July, people challenge 
themselves to reduce their plastic footprint 
through ‘‘Plastics Free July’’; 
Whereas, during the International Coastal 
Cleanup in 2020, nearly 950,000 people across 
the globe cleaned up over 10,000 tons of plas-
tic from beaches; 
Whereas switching to reusable items in-
stead of single-use items can prevent waste, 
save water, and reduce litter; and 
Whereas July 2022 is an appropriate month 
to designate as Plastic Pollution Action 
Month to recommit to taking action, indi-
vidually and as a country, to reduce plastic 
pollution: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) designates July 2022 as ‘‘Plastic Pollu-
tion Action Month’’; 
(2) recognizes the dangers to human health 
and the environment posed by plastic pollu-
tion; and 
(3) encourages all individuals in the United 
States to protect, conserve, maintain, and 
rebuild the environment by responsibly par-
ticipating in activities to reduce plastic pol-
lution in July 2022 and year-round.

ORING THE DEDICATION OF THE 
BALL 
FAMILY 
TO 
PROVIDING 
COLLEGE 
EDUCATIONS 
AND 
CELEBRATING 
THEIR 
100-YEAR 
LEGACY AT BALL STATE UNI-
VERSITY 
Mr. BRAUN submitted the following 
resolution; which was referred to the 
Committee on the Judiciary: 
S. RES. 698 
Whereas, in 1880, the Ball brothers, Ed-
mund, Frank, George, Lucius, and William, 
founded an American manufacturing com-
pany to produce wood-jacketed tin cans with 
a $200 loan from their uncle; 
Whereas, in 1884, the Ball family began 
making glass home-canning jars, the product 
that made the Ball Corporation a household 
name; 
Whereas the Ball brothers moved from Buf-
falo, New York, to Muncie, Indiana, in 1887; 
Whereas the first glassware was produced 
in Muncie in 1888, and the Ball Corporation 
led the United States in production of fruit 
jars by 1900; 
Whereas, by purchasing the land and build-
ings, the Ball brothers rescued Muncie Na-
tional Institute, which was renamed ‘‘Indi-
ana State Normal Institute, Eastern Divi-
sion’’, and later donated the school to the 
State of Indiana; 
Whereas, in June 1918, classes began at the 
new Muncie campus to prepare students in 
east central Indiana to become educators; 
Whereas, in recognition of the generosity 
of the Ball family, the Indiana General As-
sembly renamed the school as ‘‘Ball Teach-
ers College’’ in 1922 and ‘‘Ball State Teachers 
College’’ in 1929; 
Whereas, in 1927, the Muncie Chamber of 
Commerce proposed a memorial to express 
gratitude for the generosity of the Ball fam-
ily on behalf of Muncie and Ball Teachers 
College; 
Whereas, by the 1960s, the school had begun 
to attract faculty from outside the Midwest 
and students sought majors in business, ar-
chitecture, and other emerging disciplines; 
Whereas, in 1965, the Indiana General As-
sembly renamed the school ‘‘Ball State Uni-
versity’’, acknowledging phenomenal growth 
in enrollment and facilities, the variety and 
quality of educational programs and serv-
ices, and the anticipation of the broader role 
the school would play in the future of Indi-
ana; 
Whereas enrollment and funding at Ball 
State University surged with trends across 
the United States and new facilities and de-
gree offerings were added, including the col-
lege of architecture, the human performance 
lab, and the center for radio and television, 
marked a new period of growth, and solidi-
fied the shift from a small regional teachers’ 
college to a major State university empha-
sizing ‘‘education, research, and service’’; 
Whereas Ball State University continues 
to produce alumni who, in various fields and 
endeavors, make great impacts in Indiana 
and throughout the United States; and 
Whereas Ball State University and its 
namesake, the Ball family, have played a 
vital role in education of Hoosiers and other 
individuals throughout the United States: 
Now therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) acknowledges that— 
(A) the philanthropy and dedication to the 
Muncie and Delaware County, Indiana, com-
munity by the Ball brothers and their fami-
lies has been and continues to be vital to the 
economic 
development, 
growth, 
cultural 
identity, and rich history of the community 
and Indiana; and 
(B) the legacy of the Ball brothers, their 
families, and Ball State University, with its 
education program and service to the com-
munity, continues to enrich the community, 
Indiana, and the world; 
(2) honors the dedication of the Ball broth-
ers and their families to providing college 
educations; and 
(3) celebrates the 100th anniversary of the 
renaming of Indiana State Normal Institute, 
Eastern District as ‘‘Ball Teachers College’’ 
and later as ‘‘Ball State University’’.

lowing: 
TITLE lll—EAGLES ACT OF 2022 
SEC. lll01. SHORT TITLE. 
This title may be cited as the ‘‘EAGLES 
Act of 2022’’. 
SEC. lll02. FINDINGS; SENSE OF CONGRESS. 
(a) 
FINDINGS.—Congress 
finds 
the 
fol-
lowing: 
(1) On February 14, 2018, 17 individuals lost 
their lives in a senseless and violent attack 
on Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School 
in Parkland Florida, a school whose mascot 
is the eagle. 
(2) These individuals lived lives of warmth, 
joy, determination, service, and love, and 
their loss is mourned by the Nation. 
(3) The shooter in that attack exhibited 
patterns of behavior that were alarming and 
that should have alerted law enforcement 
and other Federal, State, and local officials. 
(4) The attack on Marjory Stoneman Doug-
las High School was preventable. 
(5) Lives were saved because of the brave 
and exemplary conduct of many students, 
teachers, and staff at Marjory Stoneman 
Douglas High School, including several of 
the victims of the attack. 
(6) The National Threat Assessment Center 
(referred to in this title as the ‘‘Center’’) was 
established in 1998 to conduct research on 
various types of targeted violence. 
(7) Studies conducted by the Center on tar-
geted school violence, in particular, have 
shown that— 
(A) most incidents were planned in ad-
vance; 
(B) the attackers’ behavior gave some indi-
cation that the individual was planning, or 
at least contemplating, an attack; 
(C) most attackers had already exhibited a 
pattern of behavior that was of concern to 
other people in their lives; and 
(D) prior to the attack, someone associated 
with the attacker, such as a family member 
or peer, knew the attack was to likely to 
occur. 
(8) Through their research, the Center de-
veloped the threat assessment model for re-
sponding to indicators of targeted violence, 
which includes a 3-step process— 
(A) identifying individuals who are exhib-
iting behaviors that indicate they are plan-
ning an attack on a school; 
(B) assessing whether the individual poses 
a threat to the school, based on articulable 
facts; and 
(C) managing the threat the individual 
may pose to the school. 
(9) The threat assessment model works 
most effectively when all the relevant par-
ties, including school officials, local law en-
forcement, and members of the community, 
are part of a comprehensive protocol to iden-
tify, assess, and manage a potential threat 
to the school. 
(10) The primary goal of threat assessment 
programs in schools should be to prevent vio-
lent conduct, with an emphasis on early 
intervention, treatment, and care of individ-
uals exhibiting behaviors associated with 
targeted violence. 
(11) Early intervention, treatment, and 
prevention of violent behavior is an effective 
way to prevent violent conduct that would 
harm others and necessitate disciplinary ac-
tion, including criminal penalties. 
(12) The parties involved need the appro-
priate training and tools to establish the ap-
propriate mechanisms for implementing this 
type of approach. 
(b) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of 
Congress that a fact-based threat assessment 
approach, involving school officials, local 
law enforcement, and members of the com-
munity, is one of the most effective ways to 
prevent targeted violence in schools, and is a 
fitting memorial to those who lost their 
lives in the February 14, 2018, attack on Mar-
jory Stoneman Douglas High School and 
those who heroically acted to preserve the 
lives of their friends, students, and col-
leagues.

OTHER PURPOSES 
SPEECH OF 
HON. NANCY PELOSI 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, June 22, 2022 
Ms. PELOSI. Madam Speaker, in his State 
of the Union Address this year, President 
Biden laid out his powerful ‘‘Unity Agenda.’’ 
This inspiring vision encompassed areas of 
broad bipartisan agreement on four of the big-
gest challenges we face. 
And today, I proudly rise in support of legis-
lation that forges important progress on three 
of the President’s ambitious and unifying 
goals: 
improving mental health and addressing the 
opioid epidemic, with the Restoring Hope for 
Mental Health and Well-Being Act; 
and intensifying the fight against cancer, 
with the Advanced Research Projects Agen-
cy–Health Act. 
Today, the House will pass a package of 
critical resources to address our Nation’s twin 
crises of mental health and the substance use 
disorders. 
The CDC estimates that more than half of 
American adults will be diagnosed with a men-
tal illness or disorder at some point in their 
lifetime. 
At the same time, more than two million 
Americans suffer from an opioid use dis-
order—and our Nation has seen a 30 percent 
spike in overdose deaths from 2019 to 2020. 
Families and communities are being torn 
apart—and we must act now. 
Our Restoring Hope for Mental Health and 
Well-Being Act strengthens and expands more 
than 30 essential, life-saving initiatives: from 
crisis response, including the National Suicide 
Prevention Lifeline; to treatments helping com-
bat the opioid epidemic; and to behavioral 
health services for our children, to name just 
a few. 
Let us salute the unyielding leaders of the 
Bipartisan Addiction and Mental Health Task 
Force: who have moved us all with their pow-
erful personal stories of these issues have 
touched their lives. 
And thank you to Energy & Commerce 
Chairman FRANK PALLONE for helping steer 
this crucial package to the Floor. 
At the same time, the House will today pass 
legislation to supercharge our Nation’s Cancer 
Moonshot. 
Our hearts break for the hundreds of thou-
sands of American families each year who 
lose a loved one to the scourge of cancer. 
Six years ago, then-Vice President Biden in-
spired our Nation with his bold and personal 
leadership in the fight to defeat cancer. 
And this year, as President, he has proudly 
reignited this ambitious initiative: redoubling 
our Nation’s efforts to slash the cancer death 
rate in half over the next 25 years. 
Thanks to the determined leadership of 
Congresswoman ANNA ESHOO, the ARPA–H 
Act will accelerate innovation in medicine and 
technology: harnessing the power of American 
ingenuity; and fueling new breakthroughs in 
the search for a cure. 
In doing so, we will take an important step 
to save lives—not only from cancer, but from 
additional devastating diseases such as ALS, 
Alzheimer’s and diabetes. 
In his inspiring State of the Union Address 
last March, President Biden called on the Con-
gress to ‘‘show the Nation that we can come 
together and do big things.’’ 
And today, the House proudly answers that 
call—with strong, popular legislation that the 
American people want and deserve. 
So I urge all Members to join together in a 
strong ‘‘aye’’ vote for these bipartisan bills, so 
we can prove that Congress still works For 
The People.

RECOGNIZING NAVAL AIR STATION 
LEMOORE 
HON. DAVID G. VALADAO 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, June 23, 2022 
Mr. VALADAO. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize Naval Air Station (NAS) 
Lemoore on its 60th anniversary. 
Construction of the Naval Air Base in 1960 
brought an important military presence to the 
Central Valley. On July 8, 1961, thousands 
came to witness the commissioning of the 
base, as it became the largest air station on 
the West Coast. For the next sixty years, NAS 
Lemoore has been a fixture in the community. 
Throughout its history, NAS Lemoore has 
been critical to the United States Military. The 
base has trained thousands of Navy pilots 
since its opening and has been a consistent 
source of innovation and testing of the newest 
military equipment. In 1998, NAS Lemoore 
was chosen to host the latest in Navy aircraft 
technology, the F/A 18 E/F Super Hornet, and 
in 2017, the F–35 Lightning II onsite. Today, 
NAS Lemoore is the Navy’s largest master jet 
base. 
NAS Lemoore has not only been vital to the 
U.S. Military, but it has also been a source of 
public service for Valley residents. Over the 
past sixty years, the base has hosted job fairs, 
partnered with the non-profit group Habitat for 
Humanity to build homes for veterans, and 
has hosted air shows featuring the Blue An-
gels among many other community-centered 
events. 
I ask my colleagues in the United States 
House of Representatives to join me in cele-
brating the 60th anniversary of Naval Air Sta-
tion Lemoore.

COMMEMORATING THE LIFE AND 
SERVICE 
OF 
U.S. 
CONGRESS-
WOMAN PATSY MINK OF HAWAII 
ON THE 50TH ANNIVERSARY OF 
TITLE IX 
HON. ED CASE 
OF HAWAII 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, June 23, 2022 
Mr. CASE. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
join so many others in honoring the life and 
legacy 
of 
U.S. 
Congresswoman 
Patsy 
Takemoto Mink and the 50th Anniversary of 
her signature stamp on our nation, Title IX. 
Born in Paia, Hawaii, Congresswoman Mink 
was a true pioneer in so many areas: the first 
female elected class president at Maui High 
School, the first Japanese-American woman 
admitted to the Hawaii bar in 1953, and the 
first woman of color ever elected to this body. 
She experienced many firsts throughout her 
life but spent her career ensuring that she 
would not be the last. She is best remem-
bered as the principal author of Title IX, where 
she fought successfully to end the gender dis-
crimination in academics and athletics in fed-
erally funded education that she and so many 
others had endured. 
A half century later, we see the results of 
her labor with nearly three million young 
women participating in high school sports 
across the country and 1.1 million female col-
lege graduates every year. For this, we owe 
her an immense amount of gratitude. 
But it would be a true mistake to remember 
her only for this one singular accomplishment, 
for over her long and productive career she 
fought endlessly on so many fronts to end 
poverty, discrimination and injustice, advance 
the inherent right of all peoples and realize a 
more perfect union. And, as a true keiki o ka 
aina, child of the land, she always stayed true 
to her roots and her Hawaii home. 
Mahalo nui loa, or thank you very much, on 
behalf of a grateful Nation and home.

Mrs. DINGELL. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize the one hundred and sixty- 
five years of the Bethel African Methodist 
Episcopal Church located in Ann Arbor, Michi-
gan as they host the Michigan Annual Con-
ference of the Fourth Episcopal District of

fifty years of service and dedication to our 
community is worthy of commendation.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks
E660 
June 23, 2022 
The AME Church is the oldest historically 
Black church denomination, founded by faith 
leaders who faced racial discrimination that 
would prevent African American worshippers 
from attending the same sermons as their 
white peers. Beginning with the first Church in 
Philadelphia, Mother Bethel African Methodist 
Episcopal Church, the AME churches ex-
panded rapidly following the end of the Civil 
War and the emancipation of enslaved African 
Americans who sought a spiritual home. The 
Mission of the AME Church is to minister the 
social, spiritual, and physical development of 
all people. 
Founded by John Wesley Brooks in 1857, 
Bethel AME is the oldest historically Black 
church in Washtenaw County. Since their 
humble beginnings in a shared worship space, 
they have been a welcoming a vibrant mem-
ber of our diverse faith collaborative in South-
east Michigan. Currently led by Reverend 
Mashod A. Evans, Sr. Bethel AME is a bea-
con of the Ann Arbor community. Their work 
goes far beyond worship with their charitable 
work done throughout the county by the con-
gregation. They arrange donation drives for 
agencies that assist our neighbors at all walks 
of life, run a literacy program for children, and 
host events that support the health of our en-
tire community. The church and its members 
are dedicated to uplifting and bettering our 
community, and for that we are thankful for 
their nearly two centuries of service. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me today in celebrating one hundred and 
sixty-five years of Bethel AME Church. As the 
Fourth Episcopal District celebrates their one 
hundred and thirty sixth Michigan Annual Con-
ference here in Ann Arbor, we welcome lead-
ers and delegates representing over fifty 
churches from across this great state. I join 
with Bishop John F. White, Reverend Mashod 
A. Evans, and the entire congregation of Beth-
el AME and the Fourth Episcopal District in 
extending my best wishes and gratitude to all 
on this special day. We are grateful for Bethel 
AME’s impactful work and wish them contin-
ued success in the coming years.

RECOGNIZING 
MATT 
MCLOGAN 
AND HIS YEARS OF SERVICE AT 
GRAND VALLEY STATE UNIVER-
SITY 
HON. PETER MEIJER 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, June 23, 2022 
Mr. MEIJER. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to recognize West Michigan’s own Grand Val-
ley State University Vice President Matthew E. 
McLogan, who for nearly 35 years has deliv-
ered unparalleled leadership and expertise to 
our region’s academic communities. 
Originally hired in 1987, he is the longest 
serving executive officer in university history. 
Prior to his time at GVSU, Matt was a fixture 
in broadcast news and served honorably as 
Michigan’s former Public Service Commis-
sioner. He took the exceptional skillset he built 
in these professions and brought it to GVSU. 
When Matt joined Grand Valley and became 
a Laker, the school’s lone campus was home 
to just 8,000 students. Now, as of 2022, the 
Laker community has grown nearly threefold, 
boasting over 23,000 students across five lo-
cations. The university’s technological centers, 
libraries, and resources are now the envy of 
competing institutions at home in West Michi-
gan and across the Nation. 
Having served through the previous four of 
five university presidents, Matt facilitated and 
witnessed firsthand Grand Valley State Univer-
sity’s historic expansion. For years, he has 
been essential to the success of Grand Val-
ley’s executive leadership, playing a crucial 
role in government and alumni relations, the 
school’s marketing programs, and as secretary 
to the Board of Trustees. 
Matt maintains responsibility for some of the 
institution’s 
most 
memorable 
accomplish-
ments: the university’s presence on Grand 
Rapids’ famous Medical Mile, the school’s un-
precedented expansion, and game-changing 
additions requiring public support. Matt is 
known widely throughout our community as 
one of West Michigan’s best promoters and 
academic professionals. 
Largely due to the leadership and expertise 
of Vice President McLogan, Grand Valley 
State University is poised to continue unprece-
dented growth for many years to come. Matt 
has brought great fortune to the Lakers, and 
there is no doubt that the successes of his 
leadership have made a lasting impact on our 
community. 
Madam Speaker, it is my distinct honor to 
take this time to recognize the accomplish-
ments of this distinguished leader. I applaud 
Matt for his decades of selfless leadership and 
service to the Grand Valley community and 
can say with great certainty that his accom-
plishments will not soon be forgotten.

CELEBRATING 
THE 
MILITARY 
SERVICE AND RETIREMENT OF 
LTC JASON MALONE 
HON. TRENT KELLY 
OF MISSISSIPPI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, June 23, 2022 
Mr. KELLY of Mississippi. Madam Speaker, 
today I rise to recognize the outstanding mili-
tary service and retirement of Lieutenant Colo-
nel (LTC) Jason Malone. He has dem-
onstrated a devotion to America throughout hit 
long and distinguished military career in the 
U.S. Army and as a member of the Mississippi 
Army National Guard. 
In 1995, LTC Malone completed Basic 
Training and Advanced Individual Training. 
Additional professional development training 
included the Non-Commissioned Officer Pro-
fessional Development Course (2000), Re-
serve Officer Training Corps (Commissioned 
as a 2nd Lieutenant in 2003), Armor Officer 
Basic Course (2003–2004), Advanced Military 
Transition Trainer Course, Combat Lifesavers 
Course (2008), Logistics Captain’s Career 
Course (2008), Logistics Captain’s Career 
Course (2009), Command General Staff Col-
lege (20I3–2014), Division Transportation Offi-
cer (2014), Joint Planners Course, and Air-
borne Course. 
LTC Malone is proud of his military service. 
He served in the Mississippi Army National 
Guard (155th Armored Brigade) from January 
1998 until May 2003. LTC Malone is a third 
generation 82nd Airborne Paratrooper. He led 
troops in combat as a Tank Platoon Leader 
with 3rd Infantry Division and Company Com-
mander in the 82nd ABN Division. LTC Ma-

COMMEMORATING THE NATIONAL 
FEDERAL PELL GRANT DAY 
HON. PETER A. DeFAZIO 
OF OREGON 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, June 23, 2022 
Mr. DEFAZIO. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the 
Pell Grant Program. 
All Americans, regardless of their income, 
should have the right to access quality edu-
cation, which is invaluable for accessing good 
jobs, financial stability, and economic mobility. 
Throughout my career, I have strongly sup-
ported the Pell Grant Program, which provides 
direct financial assistance to low-income stu-
dents to ensure they have the same access to 
higher education and opportunities for success 
as their higher-income peers. 
Since its creation, more than 80 million stu-
dents have received a Pell Grant. Today, 
nearly 7 million students are going to college 
with Pell Grants, including over 17,000 stu-
dents in my district who are receiving $71 mil-
lion to pursue their higher education goals. 
As a recipient of financial aid who couldn’t 
have attended college without help, I under-
stand the need for the federal government to 
ensure students have access to higher edu-
cation. I believe that a college education—

whether from a vocational school, a commu-
nity college, or a four-year college—should 
open doors for students, not weigh them down 
with insurmountable debt. 
When the program was created 50 years 
ago with bipartisan support, it could cover 
more than 75 percent of the cost of earning a 
four-year degree at a public university. But 
today, it doesn’t even cover 30 percent of the 
cost. That’s why I’ve fought throughout my ca-
reer to increase Pell Grant funding in order to 
help current and future students with the rising 
costs of higher education. 
Our investment in the Pell Grant is an in-
vestment in our children’s and our nation’s fu-
ture. As we mark 50 years of the Pell Grant 
program and recognize the success of grad-
uates who have benefitted from it, I look for-
ward to continuing my support for the program 
to ensure future students have access to in-
valuable opportunities without being saddled 
with burdensome loan debt. 
I urge my colleagues to support the bipar-
tisan resolution declaring June 23, 2022, as 
National Pell Grant Day, as well as to work to-
wards protecting the right for all Americans to 
pursue 
a 
higher 
education 
should 
they 
choose, regardless of their financial status.

RECOGNIZING DR. CHRIS 
MARKWOOD 
HON. SANFORD D. BISHOP, JR. 
OF GEORGIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, June 23, 2022 
Mr. BISHOP of Georgia. Madam Speaker, it 
is my honor and pleasure to extend my per-
sonal congratulations and best wishes to a 
gifted educator and devoted community lead-
er, Dr. Chris Markwood, on his retirement as 
the President of Columbus State University 
(CSU). Dr. Markwood’s retirement from three 
decades of work in higher education will be 
celebrated at a reception on June 23, 2022, at 
the Cunningham Conference Center in Colum-
bus, Georgia. 
Dr. Markwood earned a bachelor’s degree 
in Political Science and History from South-
west Baptist University in Bolivar, Missouri. He 
then returned to his native state of Texas to 
earn his doctorate and a master’s degree in 
Political Science from the University of Mis-
souri-Columbia. 
Before beginning his tenure as President of 
Columbus State University, Dr. Markwood as-
cended to several distinguished higher edu-
cation positions across the United States, in-
cluding the inaugural Dean of the University of 
Central Oklahoma’s College of Arts, Media & 
Design; interim chancellor at the University of 
Wisconsin-Superior; and provost and vice 
president for Academic Affairs at Texas A&M 
University-Corpus Christi. 
In June of 2015, Dr. Markwood joined Co-
lumbus State University as the institution’s fifth 
president, where he implemented an ambitious 
plan to reconnect the university with the great-
er 
Columbus 
community 
of 
fostering 
‘‘communiversity.’’ During seven years of dedi-
cated service, Dr. Markwood not only led CSU 
to achieve outstanding academic success but 
also oversaw the growth of community events 
such as Winter Fest, a holiday festival that 
brings thousands from the surrounding Colum-
bus area to CSU’s Main Campus every year 
for a celebration of the many religions, cul-
tures, and traditions that live in the hearts of 
the people of the Chattahoochee Valley. Dr. 
Markwood’s philosophy of ‘‘communiversity’’ 
has certainly paid off, expanding the reach of 
the University into the greater Columbus area 
and forging bonds that have created new op-
portunities for students, graduates, and the 
businesses that serve as the economic back-
bone of the community. This includes CSU 
being among the inaugural group of University 
System of Georgia institutions offering the sys-
tem’s new nexus degree programs—designed 
to aid more Georgians in accessing careers in 
high-demand areas and to help employers 
identify highly qualified talent. 
Under Dr. Markwood’s leadership, Colum-
bus State University has remained a mainstay 
in the U.S. News and World Report’s ranking 
of regional public universities and the publica-
tion’s mobility index. Other publications and 
websites have lauded the university’s aca-
demic strengths in business, communication, 
nursing, and online degrees, as well as its 
military-friendly environment. Additionally, CSU 
has introduced nearly thirty new under-
graduate and graduate degree offerings, a 
nearly equal number of new certificate pro-
grams, and modernized more than a dozen 
academic programs to better serve its stu-
dents. This transformation was exemplified 
through 
several 
corporate-community-aca-
demic partnerships, such as the creation of 
new cybersecurity and robotics engineering 
programs in collaboration with TSYS, Fort 
Benning, and Pratt & Whitney. Moreover, 
under Dr. Markwood’s tenure, CSU dem-
onstrated its preeminence in the arts by 
launching a new film production degree in 
partnership with the Georgia Film Academy, 
and created Flat Rock Studio, a state-of-the- 
art film and television production campus, with 
support of Columbus’ own W.C. Bradley. 
These robust community partnerships have 
positioned Columbus State University and its 
students extremely well for successful future 
careers in an expanding field of job opportuni-
ties. 
Dr. Markwood has been honored both lo-
cally and statewide; in 2021, he received the 
Meritorious Public Service Medal from the De-
partment of the Army—presented by Major 
Gen. Patrick Donahoe, Commanding General 
of the U.S. Army Maneuver Center of Excel-
lence and Fort Benning. He has also been in-
cluded on Georgia Trend’s 2022 list ‘‘100 Most 
Influential Georgians’’ which marked his sixth 
consecutive appearance among the handful of 
university presidents across the state to be in-
cluded each year. Dr. Markwood currently 
serves as an executive committee member of 
the Peach Belt Conference, a member of the 
Georgia Council on Economic Education’s 
Board of Trustees and the University System 
of Georgia’s Comprehensive Administrative 
Review Steering Committee. He is also a 
longtime Rotarian and current member of the 
Columbus Rotary Club. 
Dr. Markwood’s official service at CSU will 
soon be coming to an end, but his dedication 
to helping others will continue. As a servant 
leader and man of faith, Dr. Markwood has 
shown a strong commitment to both serving 
students and improving the quality of life in the 
Chattahoochee Valley. Dr. Chris Markwood 
has accomplished much in his life, but none of 
it would have been possible without the grace 
of God; the love and support of his wife, 
Bridget, and their daughter, Reagan. 
Nelson Mandela once said that ‘‘education 
is the most powerful weapon which you can 
use to change the world.’’ Dr. Chris Markwood 
has dedicated his life’s work to educating 
scholars who will turn their passions into thriv-
ing careers that will improve our communities 
and change the world. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues in the 
House of Representatives to join my wife, Viv-
ian, and me along with the more than 730,000 
residents of the Second Congressional District 
of Georgia in extending our sincerest appre-
ciation 
and 
best 
wishes 
to 
Dr. 
Chris 
Markwood, and his family, upon the occasion 
of his retirement. Throughout his career, Dr. 
Markwood has done so much for so many for 
so long and we wish him the very best as he 
embarks upon the next chapter of his life.

RECOGNIZING THE 50TH ANNIVER-
SARY OF THE PELL GRANT 
HON. LINDA T. SA´NCHEZ 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, June 23, 2022 
Ms. SA´ NCHEZ. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to mark the 50th Anniversary of the Pell 
Grant program. 
When Congress created the Basic Edu-
cational Opportunity Grant in 1972, they did so 
to provide direct financial aid to working fami-
lies, like my own, who faced numerous chal-
lenges in paying for college. 
My parents arrived in the U.S. in pursuit of 
the promise of the American dream for them-
selves and their seven children. 
When I was accepted into UC Berkeley, the 
question of how to pay for it loomed large over 
my parents and me. It took me 20 years to 
pay off my school loans, which I always con-
sidered an investment in myself. 
However, at 17 years old, taking out student 
loans was terrifying. And these days, paying 
for college has only gotten harder. Most of the 
families receiving Pell Grants earn incomes of 
$40,000 or less. That is why the federal Pell 
Grant program eases families’ student loan 
burden and is critical to ensuring folks can 
pursue higher education. 
My district is made of families like my own- 
working families trying to ensure their children 
have access to the economic mobility that col-
lege can provide. In the 38th district of Cali-
fornia, a little over 15,000 students are receiv-
ing almost $59,000,000 in Pell Grant awards. 
That’s only a portion of the 7 million students 
that can attend college because of Pell 
Grants. 
As we approach the 50–year mark on the 
Pell Grant program, I encourage the United 
States to celebrate ‘‘National Pell Grant Day’’ 
on June 23. Let us recognize the current stu-
dents and successful graduates who have 
benefited from the program. 
Madam Speaker, I hope we can count on 
another 50 years of bipartisan support for low- 
income students through the Pell Grant pro-
gram. I urge my colleagues to support the bi-
partisan resolution declaring June 23, 2022, 
National Pell Grant Day this year, and in the 
future.

NING 
ACT 
AND 
THE 
CAMPUS 
PREVENTION 
AND

FOR STUDENTS ACT OF 2022 
HON. GWEN MOORE 
OF WISCONSIN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, June 23, 2022 
Ms. MOORE of Wisconsin. Madam Speak-
er, I rise in support of legislation to address 
the mental health and substance use needs of 
our college students. Our Nation continues to 
struggle with adequately meeting these needs, 
resulting in devastating consequences for too 
many of our constituents. 
Milwaukee has long been a magnet for 
higher education. Students from across the 
globe enter our city to attend any of our twelve 
colleges and universities. When students en-
roll, we must offer them the support they need 
to attend and successfully complete their edu-
cation. This includes those who need addi-
tional physical health, mental health, and sub-
stance misuse services during this exciting yet 
trying time of life. 
We know the need for mental health and 
substance misuse services is increasing in our 
communities. It is critical that we take steps to 
protect the mental health of all Americans, es-
pecially our college students. Across the coun-
try, young adults struggling with mental health 
and addiction lack access to the quality, on- 
campus treatment they desperately need. With 
an average of 1,100 suicides on campuses 
each year, suicide is currently the number two 
leading cause of death among college stu-
dents. 
Today, I am proud to join my colleagues in 
supporting the passage of H.R. 5407, the En-
hancing Mental Health and Suicide Prevention 
Through Campus Planning Act, and H.R. 
6493, the Campus Prevention and Recovery 
for Students Act. These bills will fund pro-
grams that better support students on our col-
lege campuses. 
The Enhancing Mental Health and Suicide 
Prevention Through Campus Planning Act 
would authorize federal support to encourage 
campuses to establish comprehensive, evi-
dence-based mental health and suicide pre-
vention programs that meet their student pop-
ulations’ diverse and urgent needs. 
Such plans would consider existing Federal 
and State efforts to address mental health and 
suicide prevention at higher education institu-
tions. They must also align with existing fed-
eral and state programs, including those au-
thorized under the Garrett Lee Smith Memorial 
Act. 
The Campus Prevention and Recovery for 
Students Act would mandate all college cam-
puses receiving federal funding or participating 
in the federal student loan program to have in 
place evidence-based programs and policies 
that prevent alcohol and substance misuse by 
students and school employees. 
The legislation would also increase author-
ized funding (to $15 million annually) for fed-
eral grants, allowing institutions of higher edu-
cation to implement and support evidence- 
based programs (including programs to im-
prove access to treatment, referral for treat-
ment services, or crisis intervention services) 
that eliminate illegal substance use, decrease 
substance misuse, and improve public health 
and safety for students. Universities may uti-
lize these funds for a range of new activities, 
including recovery support services, peer-to- 
peer counseling, and integration of campus- 
based health services that coordinate screen-
ing, diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of 
mental, behavioral, and substance use dis-
orders. 
Our students are struggling. In my home 
state 
of 
Wisconsin, 
opioid 
misuse 
out-
numbered national trends by half a percent. 
According to data from the Wisconsin Depart-
ment of Health Services, 3.5 percent of Wis-
consin youth admit to misusing opioids. Imple-
menting the measures outlined in these bills 
will help our schools and educators provide 
much-needed support to millions of college 
students throughout the country, including an 
estimated 68,000 in the Milwaukee area.

RECOGNIZING THE 50TH ANNIVER-
SARY OF THE PELL GRANT 
HON. DEREK KILMER 
OF WASHINGTON 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, June 23, 2022 
Mr. KILMER. Madam Speaker, I would like 
to take a moment to recognize and celebrate 
the 50th Anniversary of the Pell Grant Pro-
gram. 
This program is aimed at ensuring that the 
door of educational opportunity is open to all 
students seeking higher education—regardless 
of economic background or income. The fed-
eral investment in Pell Grants is targeted to 
students with demonstrated financial need, 
with most families at incomes of $40,000 or 
less. The investment pays off by increasing 
college completion and economic mobility. It’s 
a legacy that I’m committed to protecting and 
expanding so that future generations can con-
tinue to reach their educational goals free from 
financial barriers or undue cost burdens. 
For me, personally, this is also an important 
program. My folks were schoolteachers, and I 
could not have gone to college if it hadn’t 
been for the help of my community and the 
assistance of financial aid. I look at education 
as the door to opportunity for a lot of fami-
lies—including mine—and it’s clear that finan-
cial aid is the key to that door. 
Since the creation of the Pell Grant, more 
than 80 million students have felt the impact of 
this program firsthand. Last year, Pell Grants 
benefited 5,419 students attending our local 
colleges in the district that I have the honor of 
representing. At the University of Washington, 
more than 10,000 students across the univer-
sity system are Pell recipients. Furthermore, at 
Washington State University, 26.9 percent of 
enrolled undergraduate students across the 
university system were eligible to receive a 
Pell Grant this past Fall. 
As we recognize today as the 50-year mark 
of the Pell Grant program, I encourage all of 
us to not only celebrate this milestone, but to 
recognize the current students and successful 
graduates who have benefited from the pro-
gram by telling their stories, encouraging the 
same access for future students, and resolving 
to continue support for this vital program for 
the next 50 years and beyond. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
join me in supporting the bipartisan resolution 
declaring June 23, 2022, National Pell Grant 
Day this year.

HONORING THE LIFE OF MR. 
HOLDER C. ESTES 
HON. TRENT KELLY 
OF MISSISSIPPI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, June 23, 2022 
Mr. KELLY of Mississippi. Madam Speaker, 
today I rise to recognize the life and out-
standing service of World War II veteran Hold-
er C. Estes. Mr. Estes was born on July 5, 
1919, to Eli Hugh ‘‘E.H.’’ and Lillian Jones 
Estes. His siblings were Fred Estes and Hoyle 
Estes. After the death of his first wife, E.H. 
married Verble Dozier on June 3, 1935. She 
had one son, Harold Sullins. Together, they 
had Joe Howard Estes, Margie Estes Cook, 
Maynor Estes Blackburn, Martha Estes Drap-
er, Willie Gene Estes, Tommy Estes, Geneva 
Estes Melko, Hugh Allen Estes, Mary Estes 
Hallman, Robert Estes, and Janice Estes. 
On August 29, 1936, Mr. Holder Estes mar-
ried Mary Ruth Brooks. They had four chil-
dren, Cecil Estes, Charlie Estes, Jimmy Estes, 
and Brenda Estes Spearman. 
In life, Mr. Estes was a retired contractor 
and a brick mason for 35 years. He served as 
the treasurer for the Brick Masons-Plaster 
Union and was a former member of the Lee 
County School Board. Mr. Estes was also a 
member of the Eggville Church of Christ. Prior 
to this death, he was a member of the East 
Main Church of Christ. 
Mr. Estes served his country in the U.S. 
Army from June 28, 1944, until February 9, 
1946. He fought in World War II with honor 
and pride. His commitment to serving our 
great nation earned him the American Cam-
paign Medal, the European-Africa-Middle East-
ern Campaign Medal, the World War II Victor 
Medal, the Honorable Service Lapel Button 
WWII, and the Marksman Badge with Rifle 
Bar. 
Mr. Estes’ medals and ribbons could not be 
found after his death. At the request of his sis-
ter, Mary Hallman, the office of U.S. Rep-
resentative Trent Kelly submitted a request for 
replacement medals to the National Personnel 
Records Center (NPRC). We were honored to 
present the medals to members of Mr. Estes’ 
family during a ceremony held at the Eggville 
Church of Christ. 
Mr. Estes was a true hero who served our 
great Nation. He will always be remembered 
as a man who loved God, country, and family.

tures and teaches at a private studio, and pre-
viously served as music department chair at 
Our Lady of Victories School in Sayreville, NJ. 
He continues to share his talent and love of 
music with the community and has received 
well-deserved accolades for his work. 
Mr. Deibert brought his experience and tal-
ents to St. Mary Church in South Amboy, NJ, 
founding the Music at St. Mary’s concert se-
ries in 2001, which many in the public enjoy 
frequenting. Throughout his tenure at St. 
Mary’s, he has served as Director of Music

HONORING THE SERVICE OF 
COLONEL MICHAEL F. BRESLIN 
HON. BARRY MOORE 
OF ALABAMA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, June 23, 2022 
Mr. MOORE of Alabama. Madam Speaker, 
today, I recognize the service of Colonel Mi-
chael Breslin. 
Over 30 years ago, Michael began a long 
and storied career in the U.S. Army. Michael 
began his career in 1992, attending flight 
school at Fort Rucker, Alabama, where he 
learned to fly the U.S. Military’s premier me-
dium lift tactical transport aircraft, the UH–60 
Black Hawk. Michael then went on to serve in 
a myriad of commands starting at Fort Camp-
bell and Fort Bragg, then moving to several lo-
cations in Asia and Europe—ultimately becom-
ing the Commander of the 1–214th Aviation 
Regiment in May 2005, where he served until 
May 2007. 
At the conclusion of his service with the 
214th Aviation regiment, Michael went on to 
earn his Master of Business Administration de-
gree from Webster University. Upon comple-
tion of his degree, he assumed the position of 
Directorate of Evaluation and Standardization 
Operations Officer, where he established Army 
aviation policy and ensured compliance across 
all mission sets and components. He also 
went on to plan and execute four separate 
team deployments to Iraq and Afghanistan to 
assist deployed commanders and bring back 
evolving tactics to follow on units. Immediately 
following this assignment, he served as the 
Commander of the 1–228th Aviation Regiment 
in Central America. 
In 2012, Michael was assigned to the Pen-
tagon, where he served as the Chief, Current 
Operations, U.S. Army Aviation G3, and was 
responsible for the movement of over 1,000 
aircraft in and out of numerous combat zones, 
sequencing all redeployed aircraft to the Reset 
program while ensuring Commanders were 
adequately resourced for their mission. While 
serving in this capacity, Michael simulta-
neously managed over 300 taskings over the 
course of his two-year assignment. 
Michael was subsequently returned home to 
Alabama, where he served as Director, Army 
Medical Evacuation Proponency, defining and 
articulating Aeromedical Evacuation require-
ments for the entire U.S. Army. He also man-
aged all programmatic efforts to sustain and 
improve the aeromedical evacuation fleet of 
over 600 aircraft, and he successfully collabo-
rated with over twenty different entities—cen-
tered on the training, organizing and funding 
of the Army medical evacuation program. 
Colonel Breslin’s final assignment came in 
2018 as he took on the title of Assistant Dean 
of the U.S. Army School of Aviation Medicine. 
In this position, he oversees fourteen pro-
grams of instruction, including 37 staff mem-
bers and over 2,000 students. 
After 30 years of military service, Michael 
began his hard-earned and well-deserved re-
tirement on June 1, 2022. Colonel Breslin rep-
resents the best of what this country has to 
offer. Michael and his family have given so 
much over the years, and I could not be 
prouder to pay tribute and honor his decades 
of selfless, dedicated service to our country. 
PAYING RESPECTS TO DAVID FIN-
GER THE CHIEF OF LEGISLATIVE 
AND REGULATORY AFFAIRS AT 
THE 
NATIONAL 
VOLUNTEER 
FIRE COUNCIL 
HON. STENY H. HOYER 
OF MARYLAND 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, June 23, 2022 
Mr. HOYER. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to pay my respects to Dave Finger of the Na-
tional Volunteer Fire Council who passed 
away on June 3rd following a courageous bat-
tle with pancreatic cancer. 
Prior to joining the National Volunteer Fire 
Council (NVFC) as its Chief of Legislative and 
Regulatory Affairs in 2005, Dave served as 
the lead staffer on first responder issues for 
the Research and Technology Subcommittee 
of the House Committee on Science, Space, 
and Technology. Dave worked closely with my 
staff and the staff of my three fellow co-chairs 
of the Congressional Fire Services Caucus 
sharing input on legislation pending before the 
House Science Committee that benefited our 
nation’s fire and emergency services. 
As NVFC’s Chief of Legislative and Regu-
latory Affairs, Dave represented the interests 
of our nation’s volunteer firefighters on Capitol 
Hill. His efforts played a critical role in the pas-
sage of federal legislation that not only ad-
vanced the health and safety of our nation’s 
volunteer firefighters, but all firefighters and 
emergency services personnel. 
Dave was the embodiment of collaboration. 
While his primary focus was always on advo-
cating for the volunteer fire service, he under-
stood the importance of working together with 
the other national fire organizations to ad-
vance a common agenda. Tributes from his 
colleagues expressed appreciation for his pas-
sion, integrity, and character. Cerebral in na-
ture, he possessed a depth of knowledge and 
insight on the issues he championed. There 
was never a time when he walked into a 
meeting with Members of Congress or their 
staff unprepared; he was the consummate 
professional. 
Dave was only forty-four when his life was 
cut short by cancer. He leaves behind his 
wife, Allison, and their two children: Vivienne, 
7, and Sullivan, 2. He also leaves behind 
many friends and thousands of firefighters 
across the nation who owe him their deep 
gratitude for the work he performed on their 
behalf throughout his career. 
Madam Speaker, on behalf of my fellow Co- 
Chairs of the Congressional Fire Service Cau-
cus, I extend my sympathies to Dave’s family 
and to his colleagues at the National Volun-
teer Fire Council and throughout the fire and 
emergency services community for the loss of 
their loved one and friend.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks
E664 
June 23, 2022 
Since its inception in 1962, the Tulare-Kings 
Police Academy has been a vital part of train-
ing our future law enforcement officers in the 
Central Valley. The program initially began its 
operations out of the Tulare County Sheriff’s 
Office and trained future recruits there for over 
a decade. 
In 1973, the program moved to the College 
of the Sequoias campus in Visalia, providing 
even more access to young students looking 
to enter a career of public service. The pro-
gram spent nearly forty years at the Visalia 
campus, with dozens of students graduating 
each year eager to begin protecting and serv-
ing the Central Valley. In 2010, the program 
made its most recent move into a state-of-the- 
art facility on the Hanford College of the Se-
quoias campus. 
After sixty years of operation, the Tulare- 
Kings Police Academy has produced over 150 
graduating classes from its programs across 
three different campuses. These men and 
women have gone on to protect our commu-
nities throughout the Valley. Their service has 
been a consistent display of duty, honor, and 
commitment to their communities—all traits in-
stilled into them by the Tulare-Kings Police 
Academy. 
I ask my colleagues in the United States 
House of Representatives to join me in cele-
brating the 60th anniversary of the Tulare- 
Kings Police Academy at the College of the 
Sequoias.

INTRODUCTION OF THE VETERANS 
EQUAL ACCESS ACT 
HON. EARL BLUMENAUER 
OF OREGON 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, June 23, 2022 
Mr. BLUMENAUER. Madam Speaker, today 
I introduced the Veterans Equal Access Act. 
This legislation would provide equal access to 
state-legal medical marijuana for veterans par-
ticipating in Department of Veterans Affairs 
(VA) health care by ending the harmful VA 
prohibition on doctors and healthcare pro-
viders giving opinions or recommendations on 
or completing forms for state-legal medical 
marijuana programs. 
The cannabis laws in this country are bro-
ken, including our laws that govern veterans’ 
access to medical cannabis. Many veterans 
report using cannabis for medical purposes as 
a substitute for prescription drugs. The VA Na-
tional Center for Post-Traumatic Stress Dis-
order (PTSD) has acknowledged that veterans 
use cannabis to relieve symptoms of PTSD, 
and that in many states, PTSD is a qualifying 
condition for enrollment in medical cannabis 
programs. 
Most states with state-legal medical can-
nabis programs require some sort of rec-
ommendation or approval from a medical pro-
vider for patients to enroll in the program. 
However, VA policy prevents VA physicians 
and care providers from any participation, in-
cluding helping with the required paperwork or 
forms. 
This forces veterans to seek care outside of 
the VA system to receive medical cannabis 
recommendations, which can interrupt con-
tinuity of care, lead to mistakes or gaps in 
care, and require veterans to pay out of pock-
et for addition physician visits. VA physicians 
should not be denied the ability to offer a rec-
ommendation that they think may meet the 
needs of their patients. 
Veterans should not be forced outside the 
VA system to seek treatment that is legal in 
their state. 
The Veterans Equal Access Act would allow 
VA doctors and healthcare providers to give 
their opinions or recommendations on medical 
cannabis and to complete forms in compliance 
with state-legal medical marijuana programs. 
I look forward to working with my co-lead, 
Representative BRIAN
MAST, and my col-
leagues in the House and Senate to enact this 
legislation and provide equal access to state- 
legal medical cannabis for our veterans partici-
pating in VA health care.

RECOGNIZING NATIONAL 
SCLERODERMA AWARENESS DAY 
HON. BRIAN HIGGINS 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, June 23, 2022 
Mr. HIGGINS of New York. Madam Speak-
er, today I rise to honor the estimated 300,000 
Americans living with Scleroderma, an auto-
immune disease for which there is currently no 
cure, and we are unsure of its cause. The ac-
tions of individuals like Amy Gietzen and orga-
nizations such as the National Scleroderma 
Foundation have helped—and will continue to 
help—the community of individuals affected by 
Scleroderma spread awareness about this dis-
ease and work to advance research on a cure. 
Scleroderma is an autoimmune disease that 
affects connective tissue and the vascular sys-
tem through the excess production of col-
lagen. A localized version of the disease can 
cause thickening and scarring of connective 
tissue, or fibrosis, in small areas of the skin. 
Scleroderma can also be systemic and result 
in fibrosis in the internal organs. Scleroderma 
can affect almost anyone and results in issues 
with the skin, muscles, joints, blood vessels, 
and in some cases, the heart, lungs, and 
esophagus. The disease is progressive, pre-
sents differently in every individual, and, in 
many cases, can be terminal. 
Amy Gietzen, born and raised in Buffalo, 
NY, was diagnosed with Scleroderma when 
she was just 19 years old and has been living 
with the diagnosis ever since. Today, Ms. 
Gietzen is on the Board of Directors for the 
Buffalo chapter of the National Scleroderma 
Foundation, and she serves as the Chair of 
the Patient Education and Support Committee. 
In addition to her involvement with the Na-
tional Scleroderma Foundation, Ms. Gietzen is 
a 
columnist 
for 
the 
online 
publication 
Scleroderma News. She also travels across 
the country to speak publicly about her experi-
ences with Scleroderma and her personal 
medical journey. In her quest to raise aware-
ness for the disease, Ms. Gietzen has made 
it a priority to share her personal story and 
support others who receive a Scleroderma di-
agnosis. 
Organizations like the National Scleroderma 
Foundation are similarly working to support 
those living with the disease. The National 
Scleroderma Foundation was founded in 1998 
to ‘‘advance medical research, promote dis-
ease awareness, and provide support and 
education to people with scleroderma, their 
families, and support networks.’’ The Founda-
tion provides resources including research up-
dates and support groups. The National 
Scleroderma Foundation is focused on build-
ing a sense of community and solidarity for 
those living with Scleroderma. 
I am proud to join the National Scleroderma 
Foundation in recognizing June 2022 as Na-
tional Scleroderma Awareness Month and 
celebrating National Scleroderma Awareness 
Day on June 29, 2022. Throughout this month, 
the National Scleroderma Foundation is pro-
moting the ‘‘#tealforscleroderma’’ campaign. 
To 
show 
support 
for 
those 
living 
with 
Scleroderma and raise awareness about the 
disease, on June 29th, lights on the Peace 
Bridge, Niagara Falls, and The Electric Build-
ing in Buffalo will turn teal. 
It is due to the efforts of individuals like Ms. 
Amy Gietzen that I speak on this matter today. 
I thank Ms. Gietzen for her perseverance in 
the face of this disease and her tireless work 
advocating for scientific advancements, and I 
ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing 
the courageous work of Ms. Amy Gietzen and 
the National Scleroderma Foundation and go 
#tealforscleroderma.

RECOGNIZING DR. SHETAL SHAH, 
MD, FAAP 
HON. THOMAS R. SUOZZI 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, June 23, 2022 
Mr. SUOZZI. Madam Speaker, as I near the 
end of my Congressional public service, I rise 
today to recognize my constituent Dr. Shetal 
Shah, MD, FAAP of Syosset, New York for his 
sustained and expert advocacy in support of 
children’s health. During my tenure rep-
resenting New York’s third Congressional Dis-
trict, Dr. Shah has been an indispensable re-
source to my office—and the entire Long Is-
land Congressional Delegation, on issues re-
lated to children. 
As former Legislative Chairman of the Long 
Island Chapter of the American Academy of 
Pediatrics and an expert in the intricacies of 
children’s health insurance, Dr. Shah worked 
with my office to staunchly defend the gains in 
children’s health insurance coverage made as 
a result of passage of the 2010 Patient Pro-
tection and Affordable Care Act. His vigorous 
advocacy, in partnership with several national 
medical organizations, assisted our office and 
other members of New York State’s Congres-
sional Delegation in preserving core provisions 
of this landmark legislation, including the ex-
pansion of Medicaid and pediatric-specific te-
nets of the essential health care benefits pack-
age. 
He has also worked to ensure reauthoriza-
tion of the Children’s Health Insurance Pro-
gram, which in New York insures almost 
750,000 of our state’s children. Dr. Shah has 
been a vocal supporter of the need to reau-
thorize this program since its inception and 
worked with myself and fellow members of 
Congress to reauthorize this incredibly suc-
cessful program again in 2018, safeguarding 
health coverage and access for all children 
covered by Child Health Plus. 
A national pediatric leader in advocacy and 
child health policy. He has articulated the im-
portance of providing robust federal funding

June 23, 2022 
for major programs which impact children 
across Long Island and the nation. These in-
clude the Children’s Hospital Graduate Med-
ical Education program, the PREEMIE Act, 
and the Emergency Medical Services for Chil-
dren Act. His worked has been a supporter of 
legislation to increase access to pediatric sub-
specialty care and provide loan repayment to 
pediatric subspecialty physicians who care for 
patients from medically underserved areas in 
those branches of medicine. 
Through lectures and scholarly articles in 
the medical literature, Dr. Shah also outlined 
the need to modernize the Vaccines for Chil-
dren Program, advocating for legislation that 
would create incentives for more physicians to 
participate and provide routine childhood im-
munizations. This work closely aligned with his 
work to increase Medicaid payments to those 
of Medicare, creating more equity for children 
throughout our federal healthcare system. 
Throughout the COVID pandemic, Dr. Shah 
had served as a leader in the state on the pe-
diatric implications of the pandemic. At the 
pandemic’s onset, Dr. Shah—now serving as 
President of New York Chapter 2 of the Amer-
ican Academy of Pediatrics, helped support 
pediatric immunization efforts by allaying fears 
about COVID vaccines, combatted the omni-
present vaccine misinformation that appeared 
across social media, reinforced the importance 
of wearing a facemask to prevent virus trans-
mission, provided timely updates on changes 
to COVID protocols to over 1500 pediatricians 
across Long Island. Though fighting the pan-
demic as frontline physician, Dr. Shah hand- 
delivered over 10,000 pieces of personal pro-
tective equipment to pediatricians across 
Brooklyn, Queens, Nassau and Suffolk coun-
ties. At a time when these resources were ex-
tremely scarce, these deliveries helped over 
200 physicians across New York City and 
Long Island. In several cases, these deliveries 
allowed pediatric offices to stay open, so they 
could continue to care for children with chronic 
medical issues throughout the early months of 
the pandemic. Upon creation of the Paycheck 
Protection Program, he assisted practices rep-
resenting over 100 physicians in applying, 
often working in their backyards so they could 
navigate the process of securing financial as-
sistance and forestall layoffs or furloughs of 
office staff. 
I was extremely proud to partner with Dr. 
Shah, who noticed that an initial draft of the 
Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Secu-
rity (CARES) Act, did not provide for payment 
of telehealth services for certain Employee 
Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) and 
high deductible health plans. As these plans 
cover a large proportion of my constituents 
across New York State, my office served as 
an agent for New Yorkers, working to certify 
they could use telehealth to access healthcare 
during the stay-at-home period of 2020. 
We should take special note that all of this 
work is done as a volunteer, and independent 
of Dr. Shah’s work as a specialist in neonatal- 
perinatal medicine, providing care for the most 
critically-ill and premature infants in our state 
at a Regional Perinatal Center, New York’s 
highest designation for a neonatal intensive 
care unit. This work, made harder by the chal-
lenges of the pandemic, is among the most 
emotionally and physically demanding special-
ties in medicine, and we are fortunate that we 
have dedicated newborn specialists like Dr. 
Shah caring for our most fragile New Yorkers. 
For this work with my office, his leadership, 
dedication and service to the members and 
children of the Long Island Chapter of the 
American Academy of Pediatrics, the chapter 
received the coveted 2020 Outstanding Chap-
ter Award during his presidency, their first 
such award in over 57 years. 
Madam Speaker, as I prepare to leave Con-
gress, I wish to thank constituents like Dr. 
Shah for volunteering his time, passion and 
energy to provide advice on children’s health 
issues. He serves as an example of how 
strong partnerships between engaged rep-
resentatives and local experts in their districts 
can achieve better health for children. He has 
been among my most trusted advisors over 
the past 6 years on Medicaid, vaccinations 
and all aspects of child health policy. I take 
this opportunity to congratulate him, and the 
Long Island Chapter of the American Acad-
emy of Pediatrics for their dutiful work on be-
half of our children.

THE 
UNICO 
NATIONAL 
PRESIDENT 
HON. MATT CARTWRIGHT 
OF PENNSYLVANIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, June 23, 2022 
Mr. CARTWRIGHT. Madam Speaker, today 
I honor Dr. Peter Pettinato, VMD, who will be 
named the UNICO National President at the 
group’s annual convention in New Orleans, 
Louisiana. Founded in 1922, UNICO is the 
largest Italian American service organization in 
the United States. 
Peter was born in Carbondale Pennsylvania 
in 1962. He graduated from Carbondale Area 
Junior-Senior High School in 1980 as the val-
edictorian of his class. He continued his aca-
demic career at the Pennsylvania State Uni-
versity, University Park where he studied ani-
mal bioscience and chemistry. In May 1984, 
he graduated from Penn State with his Bach-
elor of Science degree and went on to attend 
graduate school at the University of Pennsyl-
vania. He graduated with his Veterinariae 
Medicinae Doctoris in 1989. 
After receiving his VMD, he returned to 
Northeastern Pennsylvania and began working 
at the Carbondale Veterinary Hospital as a 
staff veterinarian. In July 1996, he joined 
Johnson Technical Institute as an instructor of 
veterinary technology and the staff veteri-
narian. Seeking to return to private practice, 
Peter opened his own clinic, French Hill Vet-
erinary Clinic, in Greenfield Township in 1999, 
and he continues to own and operate the 
practice. 
In 1989, Peter joined the Carbondale Chap-
ter of UNICO, and over the past three dec-
ades, he has dedicated himself to the organi-
zation and truly embodied the motto of service 
above self. He was elected the president of 
Carbondale UNICO in 1996, and he has 
served as the secretary since July 2000. He 
has served as the governor of Pennsylvania 
District II twice. Additionally, he spent eight 
years as the secretary for the eastern region. 
He was elected 2nd vice president in 2018, 
1st vice president in 2019, and executive vice 
president in 2021. He has also been both a 
trustee and secretary of the UNICO founda-
tion. 
Peter has dedicated his life to the service of 
others and is actively involved in his commu-
nity in addition to his work with UNICO. He is 
a past president of the Northeastern PA Vet-
erinary Medical Association and past president 
of the Board of Trustees of the Carbondale 
Public Library. He also participates in bringing 
theatrical productions to life in the region. He 
has served as president of both the Area 
Community Theater and the Coal Company 
Theater. He is the founder and president of 
the Royal Mutineers: A Fairly Talented The-
ater Company, and he is a member of the Ritz 
Company Players. 
I am honored to congratulate Peter as he 
takes on this leadership role with UNICO Na-
tional. May he have a successful and fulfilling 
tenure as president during which I know he 
will lead with intention and integrity.

INTRODUCTION OF THE DEFENSE 
ACCESS 
ROADS 
IMPROVEMENT 
ACT 
HON. JOHN GARAMENDI 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, June 23, 2022 
Mr. GARAMENDI. Madam Speaker, today I 
introduce the ‘‘Defense Access Roads Im-
provement Act,’’ which would make common-
sense reforms to reduce congestion outside 
military installations. The Defense Access 
Roads program is a unique partnership be-
tween the U.S. Departments of Defense and 
Transportation. Under the program, the Sec-
retary of Defense designates civilian roadways 
that provide critical access for domestic mili-
tary installations as Defense Access Roads, 
making them eligible for military construction 
funding transferred to the Department of 
Transportation for road improvements off 
base. 
Military installations anchor communities 
across the nation, including California’s Travis 
and Beale Air Force Bases in my Congres-
sional district. The Defense Access Road Pro-
gram ensures that the Department of Defense 
pays its fair share for maintenance, upkeep, or 
upgrades of roads impacted by military traffic 
and the constant movement of heavy equip-
ment and vehicles. 
My ‘‘Defense Access Roads Improvement 
Act’’ would create a new, public process for 
state, county, or municipal governments to pe-
tition the Department of Defense to designate 
new Defense Access Roads, unlocking military 
construction funding for needed roadway im-
provements off base. My bill would establish a 
new online database for designated Defense 
Access Roads and any federal funding re-
quests outstanding, which improves public 
transparency and holds the Pentagon account-
able. Lastly, my bill would also allow roads 
leading to commercial shipyards used by the 
U.S. Navy or Coast Guard to be designated 
as Defense Access Roads under the program, 
instead of just seaports as under current law. 
As 
chairman 
of 
the 
Readiness 
Sub-
committee, which oversees all U.S. military in-
stallations and the Defense Access Road Pro-
gram, I am committed to securing additional 
federal investment in off-base infrastructure. 
As a senior member of both the Committee on 
Armed Services and the Committee on Trans-
portation and Infrastructure, I plan to make

HONORING DR. SANDRA HARRIS’ 
70TH BIRTHDAY 
HON. DEBBIE DINGELL 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, June 23, 2022 
Mrs. DINGELL. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize Dr. Sandra Harris of Ann 
Arbor, Michigan on the occasion of her 70th 
birthday. Her excellent service to our commu-
nity is worthy of commendation. 
Born and raised in Ann Arbor, Dr. Harris is 
a graduate of Mack Elementary, Forsythe Mid-
dle School, and Pioneer High School. She at-
tended Eastern Michigan University in Ypsi-
lanti where she earned four degrees: a bach-
elors, masters, specialists, and doctorate, all 
in the education field. She began her career at 
Ann Arbor Public Schools, serving in various 
roles, including as teacher, Vice Principal, Per-
sonnel Director, and Vocational Coordinator. 
Dr. Harris then went on to serve as Super-
intendent at Lincoln Consolidated Schools and 
the Oak Park School District before retiring. 
Coming out of retirement, Dr. Harris now 
serves as Dean Emerita and Director of Grad-
uate Education at the School of Education at 
Concordia University in Ann Arbor. 
Dr. Harris’ lifelong dedication to education 
exemplifies her passion for helping the youth 
in our community succeed and thrive. Her 
work has touched the lives of so many and 
her warmth and enthusiasm for helping others 
is made known wherever she goes. Even if 
she is busy, she always has time to mentor 
the next generation. Her commitment to our 
students has not gone unnoticed, and Dr. Har-
ris is the recipient of multiple awards including 
the Women of Distinction Award from the Girl 
Scouts of the Huron Valley Council, the Out-
standing Professional Educator Award from 
the Ann Arbor Club of the National Association 
of Negro Business and Professional Women’s 
Clubs, the Most Influential Women Award from 
Business Direct Weekly, and the Women of 
Courage-Women of Change Award from the 
Minerva Educational Development Foundation. 
Dr. Sandra Harris has paved the way for 
young African American women in our com-
munity and is a trailblazer in educational lead-
ership. She is the first African American to 
earn a Doctor of Education from Eastern 
Michigan University, the first African American 
to hold the position of Superintendent for Lin-
coln Consolidated Schools and the first African 
American to become a Dean at Concordia 
University. Additionally, she was the first fe-
male Superintendent at Oak Park School Dis-
trict. Dr. Harris is a member of the Ann Arbor 
Chapter of the Links, Delta Sigma Theta So-
rority, Inc., the National Association of Negro 
Business and Professional Women’s Clubs, 
and the Second Baptist Church of Ann Arbor. 
Her continued involvement and outstanding 
contributions to our community are commend-
able, and I am proud to honor all her accom-
plishments here today. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in celebrating Dr. Sandra Harris on her 
70th birthday. She is someone that I am proud 
to call my friend. I join with Sandra’s family 
and friends in extending my best and warmest 
wishes to her on this special day.

HON. TRENT KELLY 
OF MISSISSIPPI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, June 23, 2022 
Mr. KELLY of Mississippi. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to recognize the life of Mississippi 
State Representative Lynn Wright. Mr. Wright 
passed away on June 17, 2022, in Tusca-
loosa, Alabama. He was 69. 
He was preceded in death by his parents, 
Willie Loyd Wright, Sr. and Jo Etta Lipsey 
Wright. Survivors include his wife of 47 years, 
Ginger Howell Wright; sons, Josh Wright 
(Caroline), Jody Wright (Meredith) and Jona-
than Wright (Pearl); brothers, Loyd Wright

(Penney) and Lane Wright (Carol); sister, Beth 
Wright Ludwig (Michael), and six grand-
children, Roper Penny, Thomas Wright, Levee 
Wright, Lydia Wright, Wellesley Wright and 
Landon Wright. 
Lynn Wright graduated valedictorian from 
Carrollton High School (AL) in 1970, where he 
played football for Hall of Fame Coach Billy 
McGee. He went on to play football at the Uni-
versity of West Alabama where he helped lead 
the Tigers to a 22–7–3 overall record during 
his three years in Livingston, including an 
overall record of 8–1–2, and a trip to the NAIA 
Semifinals in 1972. After graduating from 
UWA in 1975, Mr. Wright began his coaching 
career in 1983 at McIntosh Academy, where 
he would serve as head coach through the 
1987 season. 
Mr. 
Wright 
has 
also 
coached 
five

RECOGNIZING THE 50TH ANNIVER-
SARY OF THE PELL GRANT 
HON. CATHY McMORRIS RODGERS 
OF WASHINGTON 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, June 23, 2022 
Mrs. RODGERS of Washington. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to recognize the 50th an-
niversary of the Pell Grant Program. Congress 
first enacted this program in 1972 to ensure all 
students would have the same access to high-
er education and opportunities for success, re-
gardless of their income. 
Since then, the Pell Grant Program has 
evolved into the foundation of federal college 
assistance for students nationwide. It has be-
come an essential tool for students in financial 
need to utilize in their pursuit of the American 
Dream, and it’s working. 
Over the last 50 years, more than 80 million 
students—including 7 million currently—have 
received a Pell Grant to pursue opportunities 
in higher education nationwide. In Washing-
ton’s 5th Congressional District alone, Pell 
Grants have helped more than 19,000 stu-
dents pursue degrees at one of Eastern 
Washington’s prestigious college institutions 
by providing an incredible $83 million in finan-
cial support during the 2020–21 academic 
year. The program has been especially 
impactful across the Washington State Univer-
sity system, where approximately 10,000 stu-
dents received a Pell Grant to help pay for tui-
tion. 
This program has changed the lives of so 
many in Washington and across the country. 
Many of these bright minds will go on to earn 
their degree and become the next generation 
of entrepreneurs, innovators, and world lead-
ers. All because this program gave them a 
chance that they may not have had 50 years 
ago. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in celebrating ‘‘National Pell Grant Day’’ 
today, June 23, and recognize both the stu-
dents and successful graduates who have 
proved how special of an investment this pro-
gram has become. Together, let us continue 
to teach our children that their circumstances 
do not define them, encourage them to chase 
their dreams, and celebrate this program that 
has provided support to so many.

RECOGNIZING BRUCE PLATZMAN 
HON. JAMES P. McGOVERN 
OF MASSACHUSETTS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, June 23, 2022 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize Bruce Platzman, a pas-
sionate entrepreneur and community leader 
who, as CEO and President of the furniture 
manufacturing company Affordable Interior 
Systems (AIS), has improved lives both locally 
and nationally over the last three decades. 
Beginning his career as a salesperson, 
Bruce has been a worker in the furniture in-
dustry for over 35 years. In 1989 Bruce co- 
founded AIS and has been the driving engine 
for its rapid growth, ushering the company into 
the 21st century as a strong leader in the in-
dustry. 
Under 
his 
leadership, 
AIS 
has 
prioritized working with local groups, such as

Veterans agencies, on a regular basis. From 
customer service to product development, 
Bruce has never wavered in his commitment 
to making AIS a company that serves and 
centers people. 
Bruce’s passion for giving back isn’t limited 
to his work with AIS. He serves on the board 
of directors at Make-A-Wish Massachusetts 
and Rhode Island, Mass Econ, and the 
Worcester Chamber of Commerce and is also 
a board member of the North Central MA 
Chamber of Commerce and the United Way of 
North Central Massachusetts. 
Madam Speaker, Bruce’s commitment and 
love for our community doesn’t stop there. At 
the onset of the Covid–19 pandemic, Bruce 
led the AIS launch of Sew the Masks, a na-
tionwide initiative to make and distribute high- 
quality facemasks. The program amassed al-
most 1,000 volunteers from 45 states and re-
sulted in the donation of over 600,000 
facemasks to first responders, frontline work-
ers, and people in need. 
The impact of Bruce’s leadership cannot be 
understated. He has shown, time and time 
again, remarkable initiative and commitment to 
both Central Massachusetts and this country. 
Although Bruce is stepping back from his du-
ties as CEO and President, I know he will con-
tinue to put forth his unwavering commitment 
to supporting and nurturing the communities 
he loves for years to come. 
Madam Speaker, on behalf of the United 
States Congress and all the people in whose 
lives Bruce has made a difference, it is my 
great honor to thank Bruce Platzman for his 
service to the people of Massachusetts and to 
congratulate him on his retirement.

H.R. 5274 would require Customs and Bor-

prevent secondary exposure to fentanyl and 
other potentially lethal substances. The bill 
also would require CBP to provide contain-
ment devices for officers, agents, and other 
personnel who are at risk of accidental expo-
sure to synthetic opioids. 
CBP is currently carrying out activities 
similar to those required by H.R. 5274. Thus, 
CBO estimates that implementing the bill 
would not have a significant cost; any spend-
ing would be subject to the availability of 
appropriated funds.

H.R. 7174 would reauthorize the National 
Computer Forensics Institute at the Depart-
ment of Homeland Security through fiscal 
year 2032. The current authorization for this 
program expires at the end of fiscal year 
2022. The bill would require the institute to 
update its curriculum to include inves-
tigating cybersecurity incidents, conducting 
forensic examinations, and using digital evi-
dence in court. Also, the bill would require 
the institute to analyze how it could expand 
its capacity and to report to the Congress on 
its activities. 
The Congress appropriated $43 million for 
the institute in 2022. Using historical spend-
ing patterns and adjusting for inflation, CBO 
estimates that enacting H.R. 7174 would cost 
$227 million over the 2022–2027 period and an 
additional $275 million after 2027; such spend-
ing would be subject to the availability of 
appropriated funds. 
The costs of the legislation, detailed in 
Table 1, fall within budget function 750 (ad-
ministration of justice).
