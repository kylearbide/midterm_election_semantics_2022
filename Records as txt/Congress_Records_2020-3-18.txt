PRAYER 
The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, of-
fered the following prayer: 
Let us pray. 
Holy God, we love You. You are our 
strength, rock, and protection. Use our 
Senators today to make our Nation 
safer and better. May they often think 
of the positive legacy they can lead 
through faithful service to You and 
country. 
Lord, remind them that You have 
brought our Nation through much 
greater difficulties than the ones we 
now face. As they strive to unite for 
the common good of this land we love, 
may they embrace Your promise that 
You will never leave or forsake us. 
We pray in Your merciful Name. 
Amen. 
f 
PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE 
The President pro tempore led the 
Pledge of Allegiance, as follows: 
I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the 
United States of America, and to the Repub-
lic for which it stands, one nation under God, 
indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mrs. 
LOEFFLER). The Senator from Iowa is 
recognized. 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I 
ask unanimous consent to speak in 
morning business for 1 minute. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, 
the Trump administration wants the 
U.S.-Mexico-Canada 
agreement 
to 
enter into force by June 1. I am eager, 
as well, for that to happen, but we 
must first ensure that Canada and 
Mexico are complying with their com-
mitments under that agreement. 
I am especially concerned that the 
June 1 date presents unique challenges 
for the U.S. oil industry, when it is al-
ready facing significant supply chain 
disruptions due to COVID–19. 
As we learned in 2009, the health of 
the auto industry is critical to the 
health of the entire American econ-
omy. I urge the administration to take 
very seriously the concerns expressed 
by the highest level of the auto indus-
try to ensure a reasonable timeline for 
entry into force of the U.S.-Mexico- 
Canada agreement auto regulations. 
It would be prudent right now to let 
these companies focus instead on the 
health of their workforce and supply 
chains. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The bill clerk proceeded to call the 
roll. 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President, 
I ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY 
LEADER 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ma-
jority leader is recognized. 
f 
CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President, 
every day our country grows more af-
fected by the continued spread of the 
coronavirus. Every American is feeling 
the anxiety and uncertainty of this na-
tional challenge—older Americans and 
young Americans, healthy Americans 
and those with underlying medical con-
ditions, 
parents, 
teachers, 
working 
Americans, and small business owners, 
certainly, our first responders and 
healthcare professionals. Everyone— 
everyone—is 
impacted 
in 
different 
ways and to different degrees, but all 
Americans are affected. 
All of us have seen our daily lives 
transformed in what feels like the 
blink of an eye. That is the bad news, 
and it is the good news too. We are all 
in this together—all in it together. Our 
Nation faces this serious challenge, but 
working together we can take bold 
steps to combat it. 
Earlier this month, Congress passed 
billions in urgent funding for public 
health and small businesses, and this 
Senate majority remains committed to 
taking further bold steps to preserve 
and protect the economic foundations 
of our country. 
Later today, the Senate will vote on 
a House proposal that seeks to address 
one small piece of the problem before 
us. It is a well-intentioned, bipartisan 
product assembled by House Democrats

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1782 
March 18, 2020 
and President Trump’s team that tries 
to stand up and expand some new relief 
measures for American workers. 
I will vote to pass their bill. This is 
the time for urgent, bipartisan action, 
and, in this case, I do not believe we 
should let perfection be the enemy of 
something that would help even a sub-
set of workers. 
However, the House’s bill has real 
shortcomings. It does not even begin to 
cover all of the Americans who will 
need help in the days ahead. And, more 
specifically, it achieves one of its sig-
nature policies by imposing a new, un-
tested mandate on small businesses 
without—without—guaranteeing 
they 
will have sufficient funds in advance to 
finance this new employee benefit. 
Everyone agrees that workers need 
relief. The Republicans are working on 
bold solutions to help individuals and 
families as we speak, but small busi-
nesses need relief as well. 
This is literally the worst time in liv-
ing memory to pile even more burdens 
and costs onto small businesses, which 
are, themselves, fighting to stay alive 
unless—unless—we back it up with 
major assistance. 
We all know what small businesses 
are up against. Just this week, New 
York City joined the list of towns and 
cities across the country where local 
officials have shuttered every bar and 
every restaurant for the sake of public 
health. At 5 p.m. today, all public-fac-
ing businesses in my home State of 
Kentucky will do the same. These job 
creators are literally being taken off-
line by their own governments for the 
public good. 
It is not only bars, restaurants, and 
entertainment businesses we need to 
worry about. Nobody expects Main 
Street small businesses of any sort to 
hold the kind of cash buffer they would 
need to remain in business and wait 
out a national economic disruption 
that could last for weeks or months. 
Men and women who pour their en-
tire lives into small businesses do not 
need even more obstacles. They need 
help. They need a lifeline. They need to 
know that Congress understands the 
historic obstacles they are facing and 
that we have their back as well. 
There is no moral hazard here. This 
is not some rescue following risky busi-
ness decisions. Nobody thinks any of 
this is the fault of small businesses. So 
while I will support the House bill in 
order to secure emergency relief for 
some American workers, I will not ad-
journ the Senate until we have passed 
a far bolder package that must include 
significant relief for small businesses 
all across our country. 
As we speak, Chairman RUBIO, Sen-
ator COLLINS, and others are assem-
bling a historic level of assistance for 
small businesses across America. We 
want to help them survive this disrup-
tion, absorb the new mandate in the 
House bill, and continue to make pay-
roll and avoid layoffs as much as they 
can and emerge this storm in the best 
shape possible. That means a historic 
injection of liquidity and access to 
credit, and it means Washington work-
ing directly with the lenders who al-
ready work with these small businesses 
to minimize the new bureaucracy so 
the assistance can flow as fast as pos-
sible. 
So we are going to pass the House’s 
bill, but its imperfections will just 
make our more comprehensive package 
even more urgent. So we aren’t leav-
ing. So everybody understands, we 
aren’t leaving until we deliver. The 
Senate is not going to leave small busi-
ness behind. 
This will be just one component of 
our work. As we speak, Chairman 
GRASSLEY and others are determining 
the best pathway to put money di-
rectly in the hands of the American 
people—those who are employed, those 
who may be laid off, retirees, disabled 
Americans, families—as quickly as pos-
sible. 
Of course, Chairman ALEXANDER and 
a number of our colleagues are working 
on further steps in our public health 
fight against the virus itself, such as 
getting more tools in the hands of 
healthcare providers, removing bar-
riers to treatment, and helping re-
searchers 
develop 
therapeutics 
and 
vaccines. 
Chairman WICKER and several Sen-
ators are considering the possibility of 
targeted relief for key industries that 
are shouldering an outsized burden 
from the public health directives and 
which our Nation will need to be oper-
ational on the other side of this. 
We are crafting bold and significant 
legislation to meet this crisis head-on 
and to strengthen our Nation. 
The Congress has an enormous role 
to play in responding to this challenge, 
and we are determined to do that duty. 
But, at the same time, never in our Na-
tion’s history have Americans looked 
solely to Washington for answers. That 
is not who we are. This is no different. 
Even amidst the uncertainty, the 
American people are stepping up and 
reminding everyone what solidarity 
and citizenship look like. In my home 
State, Kentuckians are going out of 
their way to stand with their neigh-
bors. Stay-at-home parents are volun-
teering 
to 
help 
neighbors 
with 
childcare when parents are unable to 
telework. Grocery stores in the Louis-
ville area are setting aside the first 
hour they are open each day, right 
after their cleaning, so older shoppers 
and those with underlying conditions 
can shop first and with less exposure. 
One local restaurant is distributing 
free meals to service industry workers 
whose hours have been cut. 
This is what makes the United States 
of America what it is, and it is what we 
are today: generosity, friendship, re-
solve, and strength. 
This is not a challenge anyone want-
ed for our Nation, but it is a challenge 
we will overcome. Someday—hopefully, 
soon—our Nation will have this virus 
on its heels, mainstream small busi-
nesses will be thriving again, and fami-
lies will be flying around the country 
again to reunite and catch up. We will 
have gotten through this together. In 
part, it will be because the Federal 
Government and Congress did our part, 
but, just as important, it will also be 
because every single American did 
theirs. 
f 
ORDER OF BUSINESS 
Mr. 
MCCONNELL. 
Now, 
Madam 
President, some observations about 
how we will conduct the voting that 
will likely occur later today, for the in-
formation of all of our colleagues. 
What we will do is have a 30-minute 
rollcall vote. We want to avoid congre-
gating here in the well. I would encour-
age our colleagues to come in and vote 
and depart the Chamber so we don’t 
have gaggles of conversation here on 
the floor. That is particularly impor-
tant for our staff here in the front of 
the Chamber. 
So I would encourage everyone to 
take full advantage of the full 30- 
minute rollcall vote. Come in and vote 
and leave, and be aware of the social 
distancing that Dr. Monahan and oth-
ers have recommended as we come over 
to the Chamber and as we depart. With 
that, I think we will be able to get 
through the voting that will occur, in 
all likelihood, later today without vio-
lating any of the safety precautions 
that have been recommended to us by 
the Capitol physician and others. 
f 
RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under 
the previous order, the leadership time 
is reserved. 
f 
MORNING BUSINESS 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under 
the previous order, the Senate will be 
in a period of morning business, with 
Senators permitted to speak therein 
for up to 10 minutes each. 
Mr. MCCONNELL. I suggest the ab-
sence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The bill clerk proceeded to call the 
roll. 
Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
f 
CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I 
come to the floor this morning with 
sad news. Illinois has lost its first resi-
dent to the coronavirus—a pandemic 
which is threatening our country and 
the world. Her name was Patricia 
Frieson, 61 years old, a retired nurse. 
She was an exceptional person. Her 
brother said she cared for everyone but 
herself. She lived taking care of people, 
and she loved it.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1783 
March 18, 2020 
She started having breathing dif-
ficulties last week and was hospitalized 
at one of our better hospitals in the 
city of Chicago and succumbed yester-
day to the coronavirus and its com-
plications. She had a history of res-
piratory illness, but she was taking 
care of herself and staying home, as 
she was told to do. 
The family remembers the last time 
she left the house was 2 weeks ago to 
attend a funeral of a friend. She did en-
tertain visitors at her home from time 
to time. Her two sisters have asked for 
tests themselves because they were in 
contact with her. I am sorry to report 
they have been unable to obtain those 
tests, at least as of late last night. 
I have spoken with the Governor of 
Illinois almost every day, and we are 
having—through 
the 
State 
labora-
tories—about 350 tests each day, this 
State of almost 13 million people. In 
addition to the State lab tests are the 
private labs and hospital tests, which 
account for a number comparable but 
not much larger than 350. There just 
aren’t enough tests. I am sure our 
plight is not unusual. 
We have heard a lot about the tests 
on the horizon, coming soon—the soon-
er the better. Until we get into more 
complete testing, it is going to be dif-
ficult for us to measure the extent of 
the infection and the impact. It is al-
most impossible to target areas of our 
State that need more attention than 
others because of the lack of testing. 
We had a nursing home over the 
weekend where there was a patient who 
tested positive for the coronavirus. The 
Department of Public Health of the 
State of Illinois went to that nursing 
home in Willowbrook as a consequence 
of the first test and tested all of the 
residents and staff and found 22 tested 
positive for the coronavirus infection. 
Naturally, that raised our numbers 
dramatically. We now have 160 known 
cases in our State, in 15 different coun-
ties. It is an indication where there is 
a signal of infection that testing is ab-
solutely essential so we can identify all 
of those who may test positive. 
Patricia Frieson’s brother Richard 
was asked what he thought about the 
news that she was the first fatality in 
our State. He said it was heart-
breaking. But then he said: I tell every-
body to take this very seriously, as we 
should. 
I think, across the United States, we 
are coming to realize that this is an ex-
ceptional public health crisis and chal-
lenge, the likes of which we have never 
seen. 
Sometime later this morning or early 
this afternoon, we will consider the 
package that was passed by the House 
of Representatives in the early morn-
ing hours of Saturday. It is a package 
that was designed to provide some 
help, some financial assistance, to 
workers and families across the United 
States who are coping with the illness 
or losing their jobs or being laid off be-
cause of the state of the economy. 
We on the Democratic side feel—and 
I believe that feeling is shared on the 
Republican side—that one of the first 
things we need to do is to assure those 
employees who may not feel well that 
it is best to stay home, and there is a 
way to do that without sacrificing the 
basics in life—your home, your food— 
which your family counts on. 
We put together this package with 
the White House on a bipartisan basis 
that provides family leave and medical 
leave. It also provides extension of un-
employment benefits that are nec-
essary for many workers across this 
country. 
Passing this bill this morning or this 
afternoon is an important step forward 
to let the people across America know 
we are doing what we can here in the 
Senate and in the House to be respon-
sive. 
Senator MCCONNELL
came to the 
floor this morning and announced the 
next bill—coronavirus 3, if you wish— 
which is a much larger undertaking, 
and it will embark on trying to get the 
economy on its feet enough to sustain 
what we are facing with layoffs and 
business closures. It is a daunting task. 
The amount of money involved is any-
where from $700 billion to $1 trillion. I 
have heard these estimates from time 
to time. That is a massive amount of 
money by any measure, but when 
measured against the economy of the 
United States, it may not be adequate 
to the challenge. 
Some have suggested cash payments 
to individual Americans. I have no 
aversion to that idea, but I hope it is 
substantial, and I hope it isn’t a one- 
time helping hand that isn’t followed 
up. 
Many of us on the Democratic side 
are working on a program that we 
think will say to families that we are 
not just going to send you one check 
and wish you the best; we are going to 
stand by you during this very difficult, 
challenging time. 
I spent the last several days on the 
telephone with business leaders across 
our State. It started with calling one of 
my favorite restaurants that sent an 
online message about closing down for 
business and being not quite sure of 
their future. It is troubling to hear a 
person or family member who put their 
life into a restaurant now facing clo-
sure, wondering if they will ever open 
again. 
Some of us are buying gift certifi-
cates at our favorite restaurant to help 
them get through this and help their 
employees during this period of time. 
My wife is doing that in Springfield. I 
have done it in Chicago. We will prob-
ably do it more. I encourage others 
who want to make sure that restaurant 
is there after we weather this storm to 
extend a helping hand if we can. 
Some 
of 
these 
restaurants 
are 
teaming up with charitable organiza-
tions to produce the meals that are 
needed for schoolchildren and their 
families. It is a little different assign-
ment, but these restaurants are the 
best in their profession, and it is great 
to see them cooperating and working 
together. 
I might also add that the Democrats 
have a proposal that Senator SCHUMER 
has spelled out and will undoubtedly 
speak to again when he comes to the 
floor this morning. At this moment, we 
have at least two tracks, two paths to-
ward the third bill to try to help the 
economy. Senator MCCONNELL has sug-
gested that he will do his exclusively 
among Republicans, and that may be a 
necessary starting point, but I urge 
him and all of the leaders to come to-
gether on a bipartisan basis as quickly 
as possible. 
The first two measures that we have 
passed—the initial $8 billion supple-
mental 
appropriation 
for 
the 
healthcare side of the equation was es-
sential and done quickly on a bipar-
tisan basis. 
The second measure, which I hope we 
pass today in the Senate, was also done 
with 
the 
White 
House, 
Speaker 
PELOSI—Democrats 
and 
Republicans 
working together. Each of us had to 
give. This measure we are voting for is 
not what I would have drawn up, and I 
am sure Republicans feel the same, but 
it is a compromise and one on which we 
ought to move forward. 
The third measure we are considering 
should be nothing less—it ought to be 
bipartisan from the start. In a press 
conference yesterday, Senator SCHU-
MER suggested that the four leaders in 
the House and Senate, Democrats and 
Republicans, meet with the White 
House and sit down at the table now to 
get started on putting together this 
measure rather than to retire to our 
sidelines and each work individually or 
separately. The sooner we come to-
gether, the better. 
One of the provisions Senator SCHU-
MER insists on—and I would add my 
voice in chorus—is that we be sensitive 
to the reality of the healthcare facili-
ties across America and what they are 
likely to face in the weeks to come. 
Hospitals and frontline responders are 
telling us they are worried they lack 
the equipment and resources we need. 
Some experts predicted as many as 1.9 
million—1.9 
million—intensive 
care 
unit admissions from this outbreak 
will take place over the next several 
months, swamping existing facilities. 
There are only 100,000 ICU beds across 
the entire United States, and we know 
accommodating 1.9 million will just 
overwhelm the system. There is also a 
major dearth of necessary masks, res-
pirators, ventilators, gowns, goggles— 
all of the things that are essential to 
protect healthcare workers and to save 
the lives of those who are facing this 
illness. 
What a frustration it is in my State, 
the State of Illinois, that I still get re-
ports from virtually every level that 
the so-called national stockpile has not 
opened up its doors for my State when 
it comes to basic needs. I mentioned 
earlier about a nursing home with 22 
positive infections in my State. The 
head of the Illinois Department of Pub-
lic Health, who alerted me to this, told 
me that in a very short period of time,

March 18, 2020 
they were going to use up the protec-
tive equipment and masks and gloves, 
for example, that they had available. 
They didn’t know where to turn for 
more. 
Let’s get this together. I believe 
there is a national stockpile, and I be-
lieve it should be open for the States 
that need it immediately. Our State is 
one of those. 
Referring to these ventilators and 
breathing devices, in a press conference 
a couple of days ago, the President said 
the Governors should do their best. We 
can do better than that. The largest 
stockpile of this equipment is in pos-
session of the Federal Government, and 
we should turn to it quickly to help 
those in need. 
I am very concerned as well—I will 
close. I see other colleagues on the 
floor, and I know they would like to 
make comments as well. I will close by 
also saying that as we undertake the 
next piece of legislation—the $800, $900, 
$1 trillion bill—I hope the first priority 
is to make sure we help our hospitals. 
I have a measure with Senator 
LANKFORD, Republican of Oklahoma, 
that will compensate hospitals in rural 
areas and downstate areas in Illinois. I 
am fearful they will be the first to be 
overwhelmed. I hope those representing 
rural States will come together and 
join, as Senator LANKFORD and I have, 
to try to find a way to make sure they 
are adequately funded to get through 
this crisis. 
I might add that we also need med-
ical professionals in the long term. I 
hope we will dedicate ourselves to im-
proving the National Health Service 
Corps as one way of doing that and fo-
cusing that in rural areas. 
Finally, I have a bill with Senator 
ALEXANDER, Senator MURRAY, and Sen-
ator BLUNT to take a survey through 
the National Academy of Sciences of 
our dependence on foreign-made medi-
cines and medical supplies and medical 
equipment so that we can establish, 
not only during this challenge and cri-
sis but for future challenges and cri-
ses—whether we have adequate domes-
tic production capacity or a necessary 
stockpiles to protect us. We found, for 
example, that some 20 major drugs 
were 
manufactured 
exclusively 
in 
China. As China went through the 
early stages of this coronavirus crisis, 
there was a fear that we would be cut 
off from sources. We have asked the 
National Academy of Science to give us 
a survey as quickly as possible. 
I will close by saying that it is inter-
esting, as I follow the emails of my 
friends and family and hear from my 
colleagues, that as we are separated 
with this social distance which we are 
trying to respect across the United 
States—as we are separated, it is inter-
esting how much we are drawn to-
gether. Our family’s emails and phone 
calls have been more numerous than 
ever as we think about one another 
more and reach out as we hear that 
there is a need within our family. 
There is more conversation and candor 
than I can ever recall in our family 
conversations. 
Perhaps adversity has a created com-
munity. Perhaps this situation, this 
concern that we have, is leading to 
more empathy. 
We are going to get through this. 
America always does. There will be 
some painful moments and very dif-
ficult ones. I think those who sent us 
to do this job in Washington expect us 
to put our party labels at the door, find 
solutions to the challenges we face, 
help our Nation through this crisis, and 
come out strong on the other side. 
I yield the floor.

RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY 
LEADER 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
Democratic leader is recognized. 
f 
CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, I 
thank my good friend, the Senator 
from South Dakota, for his usual dis-
play of patience. 
The coronavirus pandemic continues 
to test our Nation in new and difficult 
ways. There is now a confirmed case of 
coronavirus in all 50 States and the 
District of Columbia. Our public health 
system 
was 
understaffed 
and 
underresourced, and without interven-
tion, 
it 
could 
soon 
become 
over-
whelmed. 
Even as the market shifts from day 
to day, the coronavirus is slowing our 
economy to a near-standstill, and we 
are almost certainly anticipating a re-
cession. You go to the streets of many 
cities, towns, and villages, and they are 
empty. Schools are closed in large por-
tions of the country. Businesses are 
struggling not to lay off workers be-
cause they don’t have customers, they 
don’t have clients, and they don’t have 
income. There is great urgency here. 
There are really two separate and si-
multaneous emergencies—one in our 
healthcare system and another in the 
economy. We have to deal with both. If 
we 
don’t 
solve 
the 
one 
in 
our 
healthcare, the economy will continue 
to get bad no matter what we do for it. 
Less tangible than those two emer-
gencies but still very real is the impact 
the virus is having on American soci-
ety. My home city of New York is ef-
fectively on lockdown. You can go to a 
place like the Times Square subway 
station and see actually nobody there. 
Americans are being asked—rightly— 
not to gather in groups of 10 or more, 
not to go to dinner or to a bar or to 
their church or place of worship. 
I lived through 9/11. It occurred in my 
city. I knew people who were lost. I 
lived through the days of the financial 
crisis in 2008 and other moments of na-
tional urgency. But there is something 
much worse about this crisis we face. I 
have never sensed a greater sense of 
uncertainty, a greater fear of the fu-
ture, of the unknown. We don’t know 
how long this crisis will last. 
You don’t even know if you con-
tracted the virus right away, or maybe 
your spouse, maybe your child, maybe 
your parent, maybe your friend. 
Then there is a much greater sense of 
isolation, a problem for which there is 
no cure. I miss not meeting and talking 
to my constituents. They are our life-
blood. That is not happening just to us 
here in the Senate; it is happening 
across America—friends who used to 
get together and families who had 
gatherings. Different social activities 
are gone—book clubs, card games. The 
fabric and sinew of our lives as human 
beings have been put on hold, and no-
body knows for how long. 
By necessity, Americans are now sac-
rificing their normal lives and daily 
routines and, maybe worst of all, sacri-
ficing the sense of community because 
we all, each individually and together 
as a country, must fight this awful 
virus. 
Unfortunately, we are only just be-
ginning to see the necessary serious-
ness and mobilization of resources from 
the Federal Government. Sadly, unfor-
tunately, and with awful consequences, 
this administration took far too long 
to wake up to this global crisis. It has 
wasted precious weeks in downplaying 
the severity of the coronavirus—weeks 
that could have been spent in earnest 
in the preparation of building our test-
ing capacity. As a result, the United 
States continues to lag behind other 
countries in the number and the per-
centage of the population we are test-
ing. 
Stories of Americans who feel sick 
and show symptoms but who are unable 
to access coronavirus tests appear 
every day in every single newspaper. 
Warnings of the potential shortages of 
masks, hospital beds, and ventilators 
appear in the paper every day. In 2 
weeks, the issue of ventilators and ICU 
beds will be like the issue of tests 
today. In other words, 2 or 3 weeks ago, 
many of us were saying to get those 
tests out. A month ago, people were 
saying it, and now we are seeing the 
consequences—lockdowns because we 
can’t test people. We don’t know who 
has the virus and who doesn’t. The 
same crisis will be occurring in a few 
weeks. Mark our words. Unfortunately, 
it is true about ventilators and ICU 
beds. We are behind the eight ball on 
tests, and we are soon going to be be-
hind the eight ball on ICU beds and 
ventilators as more and more people 
get sick. 
The administration didn’t pay atten-
tion to tests, and now we are paying 
the price even though many of us were 
hollering for weeks about the emerging 
issues with testing. The same problem 
is about to happen with ventilators. We 
know, in 2 weeks, the number of ven-
tilators might become a massive prob-
lem. We must get ahead of it and get 
ahead of it now. I call on President 
Trump to use his existing authority to 
help address the widespread shortages 
of 
medical 
equipment, 
particularly 
ventilators, as a result of the COVID–19 
outbreak.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1785 
March 18, 2020 
I joined 27 of my colleagues in a let-
ter to President Trump to urge him to 
invoke the Defense Production Act of 
1950, which authorizes the President to 
strengthen domestic manufacturing ca-
pacity and supply in extraordinary cir-
cumstances. It is used in times of war, 
and we must mobilize as if it were a 
time of war when it comes to hos-
pitals—beds, supplies, equipment. The 
DPA, the Defense Production Act, al-
lows for the President to direct the 
production of private sector firms of 
critical manufactured goods to meet 
urgent and national security needs. 
The President should do so imme-
diately. 
A report came out today that the 
Army Corps of Engineers and FEMA 
are ready and willing to participate in 
the response process. The Army Corps 
could build temporary hospitals with 
beds, but it still hasn’t received in-
struction from the White House, from 
the administration. I thank the men 
and women who are willing to be on 
the frontlines, combating the pan-
demic, but this kind of inexcusable ac-
tion is maddening, infuriating, and 
must be rectified. Lives are at stake. 
Public health infrastructure is the 
top priority because, if we can curb 
this virus, the economy will get better. 
We need to do things to help it, obvi-
ously, but if you ignore the public 
health crisis with regard to the equip-
ment and infrastructure and personnel 
which is needed in many more numbers 
than we have ever seen, the economy 
will not get better. 
The legislation passed by the House 
on 
Saturday—phase 
2 
of 
the 
coronavirus response—has a little bit 
of this, and it must pass the Senate 
today. Unfortunately, first, we must 
dispose of a Republican amendment 
that would make a condition of the bill 
a requirement for the President to ter-
minate military operations in Afghani-
stan. Yes, you heard me right. Our Re-
publican leadership has put on the 
floor an amendment that would make a 
condition of the bill a requirement that 
the President terminate military oper-
ations in Afghanistan. 
In a time of national emergency, this 
Republican amendment is ridiculous—a 
colossal waste of time. We probably 
could have voted on this bill a day or 
two ago if it had not been for the need 
to have scheduled this amendment. I 
am eager—we are all eager—to dis-
patch this absurd Republican amend-
ment and send this bill to the Presi-
dent. For instance, it allows for the 
free testing and treatment of the 
coronavirus, which is very much need-
ed. We can send this bill to the Presi-
dent and begin work on the next phase, 
phase 3. 
As 
my 
colleagues 
know, 
Senate 
Democrats have already outlined sev-
eral proposals for the next phase of leg-
islation, and the specifics have been 
made public. The proposal has four 
main priorities: public health capacity, 
unemployment insurance, paid sick 
leave, and priority treatment for labor 
in any bailout to industry. There are 
many things in this bill that are im-
portant: no payment on student loans 
or mortgages and help with our mass 
transit 
systems. 
There 
are 
many 
things, and the Democrats are going to 
fight for them in the next phase of the 
response, but the priorities I men-
tioned are key: public health capacity, 
unemployment insurance, paid sick 
leave, and priority treatment for labor 
in any bailout to industry. 
On the public health capacity, as I 
mentioned, we need masks; we need 
hospital beds; we need ventilators; and 
we still need testing kits. So the Demo-
crats are proposing a Marshall Plan for 
our public health infrastructure. The 
sooner we act on it, the better. We also 
need to help in terms of public trans-
portation for our healthcare system. 
Tens of thousands of healthcare work-
ers in New York City and in many 
other cities cannot get to their jobs— 
their very needed jobs—if there is no 
public and mass transit. So a Marshall 
Plan for our public health infrastruc-
ture is what is needed now. It will pre-
vent the situation from getting even 
worse, and it will allow our ailing econ-
omy to begin to heal once we contain 
this virus. 
Workers who get laid off or have 
their hours cut to almost nothing need 
expanded unemployment insurance— 
period. The Secretary of the Treasury 
reportedly told Republican Senators 
yesterday that unemployment could 
hit 20 percent. Unemployment insur-
ance is a nonnegotiable part of our re-
sponse to the coronavirus. 
With regard to paid sick leave, Sen-
ators MURRAY and GILLIBRAND have a 
paid sick leave policy to meet this cri-
sis. It should be added to this part of 
the legislation. I think they will ask 
for it in a unanimous consent request 
or will offer an amendment to do so. If 
it is not included in this part, it 
should, certainly, be included in the 
next phase of legislation. 
There will be other items that we 
will have to address down the road. 
Certain industries are struggling—air-
lines, hotels—but we must make sure 
that we prioritize public health and 
workers over corporate bailouts. If 
there is going to be a discussion about 
a bailout, it must include workers’ pri-
orities and protections. The airlines 
are very important, for sure, as they 
employ a lot of people. Many of us who 
fly back and forth to our States know 
of the good people who work as the pi-
lots and the flight attendants and the 
mechanics and the clerks and the tick-
et takers. They are good, fine people. 
We want to make sure they are pro-
tected. One of the reasons—let’s not 
forget—that many airlines are so short 
of cash right now is that they have 
spent 
billions 
on 
stock 
buybacks, 
which is money they had to send out 
when they should have been saving it 
for a rainy day for their workers and 
customers. That issue should be ad-
dressed. 
A few of my Republican colleagues 
have proposed a onetime cash payment 
of $1,000. My fellow Americans, this is 
not a time for small thinking, and this 
is not a time for small measures. This 
is a time to be bold, to be aggressive. A 
single $1,000 check would help people 
pay their landlords in March, but what 
happens after that? How do they pay 
their rent in April when their offices or 
restaurants or stores are still closed 
for business? How about May? How 
about June? The President has sug-
gested that this recession could last 
through the summer. One thousand 
dollars gets used pretty quickly if you 
are unemployed. In contrast, expanded 
unemployment 
insurance, 
beefed-up 
unemployment insurance, covers you 
for a much longer time and would pro-
vide a much bigger safety net. 
This is the time to put tribalism 
aside and acknowledge that this reces-
sion, if we allow it, will do real harm to 
Americans up and down the income 
scale, and it will hurt Americans of all 
ages. So, if we are going to provide di-
rect payments, they need to be bigger, 
more frequent, and more targeted. Mil-
lionaires shouldn’t get them. 
These are the kinds of issues that all 
parties are going to have to discuss— 
Democrats and Republicans in the 
House and Senate with the White 
House. The sooner we discuss them to-
gether, the quicker we will be able to 
move forward. Yet Leader MCCONNELL 
announced yesterday that, in his plan 
to develop the next phase of legisla-
tion, Senate Republicans would sit 
among themselves and then sit down 
with the administration and come up 
with their own proposal before pre-
senting it to Senate Democrats, let 
alone to House Democrats. The process 
that Leader MCCONNELL has outlined 
for phase 3 legislation is too cum-
bersome, too partisan, and will take far 
too long given the urgency and need for 
cooperation. 
Secretary Mnuchin says he wants 
legislation passed by the end of the 
week. The McConnell process will not 
get us there. The phase 3 legislation 
should be the product of a five-corners 
negotiation, that being with House and 
Senate leaders—majority and minor-
ity—plus the White House. That is the 
way it has worked the best, the 
quickest, and the fairest in the past. If 
all parties are in the room from the 
get-go, the final product will be guar-
anteed swift passage. The process Lead-
er MCCONNELL outlines is far too remi-
niscent of the typical legislative proc-
ess in the Congress—a process that far 
too often results in delay and gridlock. 
We can’t afford that right now. 
Leader MCCONNELL was right when 
he said that, in times of national emer-
gency, we must shed our partisanship 
and rise to the occasion. So let’s begin 
that way—Republicans and Democrats, 
the House and Senate, Congress and 
the White House. The best way to ad-
vance phase 3 legislation is to have a 
five-corners negotiation from the out-
set. 
I yield the floor.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1786 
March 18, 2020 
CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, here in 
the Senate, we are continuing to move 
forward with the next installment of 
coronavirus relief legislation. I expect, 
later today, we will pass the bill that 
was passed by the House earlier, and 
we are looking beyond it to a third bill 
that will provide additional relief to 
the American people. 
As the leader has said, we have three 
priorities: providing direct assistance 
to American workers and families, 
many whose lives have been disrupted 
and dislocated in jobs, who are feeling 
a lot of economic harm, economic pain; 
giving our economy, especially our 
small businesses, the necessary support 
with which to weather the storm; and 
most importantly, providing medical 
professionals with the resources they 
need in order to fight this virus. The 
House bill addresses these priorities to 
some degree, but it is not a comprehen-
sive bill, and additional legislation is 
going to be needed. 
We especially need to ensure that the 
worker benefit requirements the House 
bill places on small businesses are ac-
companied by sufficient support. Small 
businesses are at the most risk eco-
nomically during this time, and we 
need to ensure they have the resources 
they need to get through this. I am 
looking forward to continuing to work 
with my colleagues of both parties on 
the House bill and on additional legis-
lation. 
This is a time for all of us to come 
together to ensure that medical profes-
sionals, 
American 
businesses, 
and 
American families have what they need 
to combat the coronavirus and to deal 
with its effects. I can’t think of a time 
at which we have seen schools and 
businesses close on such a mass scale. 
It is a challenging time for our coun-
try, but if we pull together, we can get 
through this and come out even strong-
er. 
All of us have roles to play in com-
bating this virus—washing our hands 
regularly and thoroughly, practicing 
social distancing, staying at home as 
much as possible, listening to advice 
from healthcare officials. All of these 
things are essential to our flattening 
the curve and limiting the number of 
infected Americans. 
It is vital that we keep as many peo-
ple as possible from getting infected so 
that our hospitals and medical profes-
sionals are not overwhelmed with 
cases. Our medical professionals are 
putting their lives on the line every 
day to care for coronavirus patients. 
Let’s make sure we do everything we 
can to keep the number of cases they 
are dealing with as low as possible. 
In difficult times, Americans rise to 
the occasion, and I am confident that 
is what we will do again. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Oregon. 
Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, I 
walked outside across the Capitol 
grounds, and it is such a beautiful day. 
The cherry blossom trees are blooming. 
There were mothers with young chil-
dren, 3- and 4-year-old children, play-
ing on the grass, and it seemed like 
just so idyllic, so perfect. It seemed 
like nothing could be wrong in Amer-
ica. 
But, in fact, so much is wrong in 
America. Our everyday rhythm of life 
has been shattered. We are facing a 
medical pandemic and an economic col-
lapse: K–12 schools, closed; univer-
sities, 
shut 
down; 
grocery 
stores, 
empty; 
restaurants, 
locked; 
gyms, 
movie theaters, music venues, closed 
for business. 
The reverberations of so many core 
businesses and core retail being shut 
are affecting virtually every family 
and every small business across this 
country. So many forms of commerce 
are grinding to a halt. The economy is 
imploding, and it is touching the work-
ers and it is touching those small busi-
nesses. Workers are experiencing the 
reality of reduced hours, lost shifts, 
layoffs; and they don’t know when they 
are going to be able to pick up that 
work again. 
Then, they are not sure how they are 
going to pay their utilities. How are 
they going to pay their rent? How are 
they going to pay their mortgage? And 
when will America and the economy 
start to heal, and when will they be 
able to go back to work? 
So the American people are anxious 
and worried, rightly, about the threat 
of the disease and worried, rightly, 
about the collapse of the economy. 
Coronavirus is marching on America. 
As of yesterday—or, actually, as of this 
morning—we have almost 6,000 cases 
here in our United States of America— 
5,881 cases as of this moment. Compare 
that to a week ago. We are talking 
about 1,200 cases a week ago. That is a 
five-fold increase in a week. 
We now have more than 50 States af-
fected—all the States, Puerto Rico, 
Guam, and the U.S. Virgin Islands. 
Then, we can ponder the fact that the 
number of deaths has gone up—51 
deaths compared to in the thirties a 
week ago. 
So the coronavirus is marching on 
America and marching on the econ-
omy. It is a double hammer affecting 
families and small business, and it is 
particularly appropriate at this mo-
ment to share with all of you the sto-
ries of small businesses in my home 
State that are being impacted. 
More than 40 businesses sent in their 
stories, and I am going to share 6 or 7 
of those stories. But as we think about 
how we proceed, we need to recognize 
that this recovery needs to be one 
where we invest in the foundation of 
our economy, we invest in the families, 
we invest with sick leave, we invest 
with unemployment insurance, we in-
vest by covering the health costs of 
getting tests and the cost of getting 
treatment, and we invest in our small 
businesses. 
Not so long ago we had a bailout that 
favored big business, and big business 
went on to make billions of dollars and 
then get a massive tax break in 2017. 
Right now, the airlines are asking for 
a $50 billion bailout, but they have 
spent almost $50 billion in stock 
buyouts over the last few years because 
they were so profitable. And why did 
they do stock buyouts? Because it in-
creased the value of the stock options 
of the corporate executives in that in-
dustry. 
This is a version of private gain and 
public pain. When a business says, 
‘‘During the good times I will keep all 
that money; thank you very much for 
not charging me any taxes to maintain 
our infrastructure or our military or 
our medical care system, and then, 
when we hit a hard time, we will ask to 
be bailed out’’—so we will have con-
versations about that strategy for big 
business. 
How about, instead, we focus on the 
families and the pain they are feeling, 
and focus on the small businesses and 
the challenges they are facing? 
We need a Main Street recovery, not 
a Wall Street bailout. We need an econ-
omy rebuilt from the bottom up, not 
from Wall Street down—small busi-
nesses, like Bargaritas, a small Mexi-
can restaurant in Ontario, OR. It is a 
great place for people to gather for a 
meal, and unlike nearby fast food res-
taurants, they aren’t known for their 
takeout. 
But to combat the virus, the State of 
Oregon has shut down sit-down res-
taurants and asked them to go to take-
out only. Well, that is taking a toll on 
Bargaritas. When a couple came re-
cently in the door and sat down for a 
meal, the restaurant staff had to ex-
plain that they could make their meal 
for them, but they would have to make 
it to go. The couple got up, and they 
didn’t order to go. They walked out the 
door. 
The owner of Bargaritas notes that 
they are just struggling to keep their 
restaurant open, that business is not 
coming in enough to pay the workers. 
So if things don’t pick up quickly, he is 
going to have to close and ask his em-
ployees to file for unemployment. 
Or how about the Paddington family 
of stores in Ashland, OR, in business 
since 1973? In recent years they have 
endured all kinds of challenges, includ-
ing a couple of summers in which wild-
fire smoke created major challenges 
for the businesses in Ashland, OR. But 
things were looking pretty good this 
year. Business was going OK. 
Now, however, the owner says they 
‘‘felt [their] world crumble in March 
with the threat of the coronavirus 
changing our world.’’ They have laid 
off eight staff members just this week. 
That is 30 percent of their staff. In a 
single day, their sales dropped 50 per-
cent. As things are going now, they 
will need to lay off more staff within 
the next few weeks if the business cli-
mate does not change. 
And the story is much the same for 
the retailers throughout the town of 
Ashland, OR.

The story is similar in Portland, 
where Betsy and Iya, a company that 
has designed and manufactured jewelry 
for the past 12 years and regularly em-
ploys 
about 
17 
workers, 
had 
to 
downsize. They had to ask three of 
their workers to be let go. 
This is a business that has gone out 
of its way to promote other local busi-
nesses, but sales have dropped off very 
quickly. I would presume that in this 
sense of crisis, families are buying es-
sentials, and that means those in the 
jewelry industry are seeing their sales 
drop. The sales have dropped very 
quickly, and they are seeing the virus’s 
huge economic impacts, and they are 
expecting to have to lay off more peo-
ple soon, and they are looking for help. 
Ultrazone 
Laser 
Tag—now, 
you 
might think that, with folks being out 
of work, they might go to a place to 
get some exercise and have some recre-
ation, and a sense of separation might 
be OK. Maybe laser tag would see an 
upsurge in sales—not the case. Lee 
Sturman, of Ultrazone Laser Tag, in 
Milwaukie says: 
My name is Lee Sturman, and I am the 
owner of Ultrazone Laser Tag, a family en-
tertainment center Located in Milwaukie, 
Oregon. As the founder, I have successfully 
operated for 26 years. During this time, like 
all small business owners, I have battled 
competitors and overcome other challenging 
obstacles. On a level playing field, I have 
managed to survive and thrive. But, unfortu-
nately, my business has been upended by an 
invasion of tiny microbes. COVID–19 has 
struck fast and struck hard. In a matter of 
two weeks, Ultrazone has gone from busy 
crowds to near emptiness. 
Steve and Kristi Ball operate Basin 
Indoor Gardening in Klamath Falls, 
OR. In response to the Klamath County 
Chamber of Commerce collecting sto-
ries of the financial impact that 
COVID–19 is having on local businesses, 
they submitted the following and ap-
preciate the opportunity to share, and 
I appreciate the fact that they re-
sponded and are sharing. Steve and 
Kristi note: 
[They have] owned a small retail business 
in downtown Klamath Falls for nearly 11 
years so have experience with seasonal fluc-
tuations and customer trends that affect the 
cash flow and overall revenues of my store. 
Things have been shockingly slow since the 
beginning of March but especially this last 
week where customer traffic has almost 
halted. Based on last years total for March 
and daily sales compared to this years same 
time frame my store gross sales are down to 
about 36% of normal, indicating 64% loss in 
revenues. I hope this is a short lived situa-
tion and business can go back to what is nor-
mal, more than a month like this will force 
some difficult decisions for the future of my 
store. 
April Severson of Portland writes: 
I’ve owned my event production company 
for 20-years. My business has always had it’s 
ups and downs but this is the first time I’ve 
had all of my contracts cancelled. I am the 
sole employee of my company however, my 
cancelled contracts have also cancelled the 
work for my associates and vendors in audio- 
visual, entertainment, decor, furniture rent-
als, floral and catering. Since most of my 
vendors are small and emerging businesses 
as well this has had a spiraling effect on our 
ability to pay for bills, insurance, mortgages 
and to take care of our families. 
Amy Baker is the owner of Thread 
Bare Press in Eugene, and she notes: 
My screen printing business relies pri-
marily on schools, restaurants and events to 
keep our T-shirt presses running. On Friday 
March 13th as the stock market tanked and 
major cultural centers shut down across the 
country, I saw a third of our monthly rev-
enue vanish in one day. In the five days 
since, my email inbox has remained empty 
as our client base struggles to shore up their 
expenses. I have laid off half of my six staff 
this week and have let the rest know that 
next week they will temporarily not have a 
job. It’s hard to feel like so many people de-
pend on me for their paychecks, let alone my 
own children that depend on me for our own 
livelihood. I have helped my staff apply for 
unemployment, but there is no unemploy-
ment for business owners. We are a small 
business that essentially lives week to week 
based on our clients. In a perfect world there 
would be money to pay my staff paid leave or 
savings to sustain myself while we close our 
doors for what I estimate to be a month. 
However, we are not in that position. What 
I’m hoping for is to ride out this storm with 
forgiveness on my own bills and expenses 
that will not get paid next month. I’ll need 
emergency, low interest capital to get back 
to work and bring my staff back on. 
Then we have all of our State’s music 
venues, like Mississippi Studios and 
the historic Liberty Theater in Astoria 
and the Ashland Shakespeare Festival 
in Ashland. All of them are in danger 
of going out of business. With social 
distancing and prohibitions on large 
gatherings and a sudden cancellation of 
musical acts, the venues are experi-
encing a sudden and total loss of in-
come. 
Those stories are representative of 
things happening all over my State and 
I know in every State of the United 
States of America. The economy is im-
ploding, and with each and every small 
business that can’t pay its bills, it af-
fects other small businesses and other 
larger businesses. It affects those who 
have rental housing and those who 
have mortgages. All of us are going to 
be touched. 
That is why it is going to be so im-
portant that we turn to this third stage 
of response by the U.S. Senate. The 
first 
stage 
was 
to 
shore 
up 
the 
healthcare industry. The second stage 
was some immediate help with sick 
leave and unemployment insurance and 
food assistance and free testing for the 
coronavirus. That bill inexplicably has 
been sitting untended in this Chamber. 
Why aren’t all 100 of us here debating 
it before the American people and vot-
ing on it? 
I am told now that maybe, possibly, 
the bill may come to the floor this 
afternoon; that some deal will be 
worked out. Wouldn’t it be better that 
we actually be on the floor talking 
about it, discussing it, and voting on 
amendments, if necessary? In a perfect 
world, I would like to pass it just the 
way the House sent it to us and get it 
into law immediately. The President 
has signed on, the House has signed on. 
You have Republican leadership and 
Democratic leadership. Why is this 
Chamber not acting? 
Then we must immediately go to this 
broader strategy—the stimulus to sup-
port our economy through this collapse 
to try to keep the collapse from being 
as severe and shortening the period be-
fore it can be restored. That period is 
going to depend a lot on how successful 
we are at interrupting the course of 
this disease. That is why this is so im-
portant—social distancing is so impor-
tant. We have to stop the disease from 
moving from one person to another. 
The disease is on the march against 
America, and we have to interrupt it. 
We have to bring it to a standstill. 
Meanwhile, we have to help those 
families and businesses being so pro-
foundly affected across America. Let’s 
rebuild this economy from the bottom 
up, paying attention to the impact on 
families and the impact on our small 
businesses. As John F. Kennedy once 
put it, ‘‘In a time of domestic crisis, 
men of goodwill and generosity should 
be able to unite regardless of party or 
politics.’’ That is what we did after 9/ 
11. That is exactly what must happen 
today. 
Let us not be moved by the powerful 
and the wealthy to give yet more 
wealth and power to them. Let us be 
moved by the fact that we are all 
Americans in this together. Let us tend 
to the fundamental needs of healthcare 
and housing and education and, most 
importantly, good jobs as those jobs 
disappear across America. 
Let’s pay attention and work to-
gether to shore up small businesses 
with low-interest loans and with grants 
to see them and their employees 
through this difficult time. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from West Virginia.

CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. MANCHIN. Mr. President, thank 
you. I want to thank my colleague 
from Oregon for his big heart and his 
compassion, continually always wor-
rying about those being left behind and 
forgotten. I can assure you that Mr. 
MERKLEY does not leave anybody be-
hind, and he never forgets those who 
are in need of help. 
Let me just say, in speaking about 
what we are dealing with, unlike any-
thing we have ever seen in my lifetime 
and most people’s lifetimes, up until a 
couple days ago, my State of West Vir-
ginia felt like we were immune. There 
were no cases reported, and we were 
like an island in a sea of infestation 
around us. I knew that was not the 
case. Many people did not know that 
we were just not testing and the 
amount of tests were just not out 
there, so people had a false sense of 
hope and security. 
That has been shattered. We have our 
first case now. I am praying to the 
good Lord we don’t have many more, 
but I suspect because of the fragility of 
our citizens and the elderly population 
that we have, those who have done

March 18, 2020 
hard work all their lives and have res-
piratory ailments could be in jeopardy. 
We are very concerned about that. 
I was reluctant to come and speak, 
but I think there are some things that 
need to be said. We are moving in an 
unprecedented 
way 
to 
how 
much 
money should be thrown at a pandemic 
and how much money do they believe it 
will take to get us through this hor-
rible time. First of all, we should be 
thinking about are we investing and 
trying to build our healthcare defense 
system back up? It has been basically 
decimated over the last 2 or 3 years. 
Should we not put the scientists and 
people who know back in positions 
where they can be looking at these hor-
rible illnesses and diseases, pandemics, 
and viruses that we have coming from 
different parts of the world to protect 
us from them hitting our country 
again like this? 
Next of all, should we not be putting 
everything we have into our research 
capabilities and working with all the 
scientists in all the different centers so 
that we can find a way to treat this 
virus with a vaccine that would pre-
vent people from contracting this 
virus? Those are the measures we 
should be totally and absolutely com-
mitted to and spending our time and 
effort immediately upon. 
Next of all, the financial help that we 
are going to need. First of all, don’t 
you think we should be using this— 
through every challenge that we have 
ever had in this great country, we have 
found a way to come out of it bigger 
and stronger. Don’t you think we 
should be manufacturing the medical 
devices that we need to heal and cure 
and take care of American citizens 
right here in the good old USA? Don’t 
you think we should have the amount 
of products it takes to make the phar-
maceutical pills that we need in order 
to keep us healthy or cure us, if you 
will? Don’t you think some of that 
should be done in the USA that we 
have allowed to leave our shores and 
which now we find is desperately need-
ed? Don’t you think we should be mak-
ing the medical masks to protect our 
first responders and all of our medical 
workers whom we need to have on the 
job? Those are the things we are wor-
ried about from the fallout that can 
come from this horrific pandemic. It 
gives us a chance to reconnect and also 
a way to correct the lackadaisical ap-
proach we have had to manufacturing 
over the years. This is a time for 
change. 
Let me throw something else out. I 
don’t think that you and I need a $1,000 
check. I don’t think we need that. I 
think there are an awful lot of people 
in America who still have a job, even if 
they are working from home, and that 
basically is not going to change their 
life with that $1,000 check. Think about 
the people who truly do need that 
check and a lot more—people on the 
frontline who have no control of this 
whatsoever, that don’t have a guaran-
teed source of income unless they are 
out there earning it every day. Don’t 
you think we could help them more 
through expanded unemployment bene-
fits, working through the system that 
we already have in place in all of our 
States and in this country? Don’t you 
think that might be a better way? 
How about the small businesses that 
are not capitalized to the point that 
they have no ability whatsoever to 
continue to operate when there is no 
capital or cashflow or reserves to take 
care of themselves? Don’t you think we 
can help them through the SBA by re-
moving the restrictions and redtape we 
have? Unemployment benefits: Basi-
cally, waiving all the wait times, in-
creasing that to a $500-a-week limit? 
Things of that sort would help, don’t 
you think? 
The large corporations, which I know 
everyone is concerned about, got one 
tremendous tax break. That being said, 
they will come back. They can afford 
to pay back a loan at zero percent in-
terest, if you will, helping in some way 
to keep that part of the economy stim-
ulated but not to the point where we 
are putting our children and grand-
children into a debt that we can 
avoid—but not being compassionate 
and sympathetic toward those who 
really need it on the frontline, which is 
the average working person who gets 
up every day and finds out there is no 
work for them. They are already on un-
employment. They are in the system. 
Also, the small businesses are strug-
gling. They are there. 
We are to the point now where we are 
going to bite off a lot more, and we are 
going to write checks that our children 
can’t cash. That is exactly what we are 
doing, if we are not smart about this. It 
seems 
that 
everyone 
is 
gathering 
around now for whatever type of cover. 
I am not sitting here blaming the 
President or blaming any administra-
tion or anybody else for what we didn’t 
do 2 or 3 or 4 months ago. I am asking 
now: Are we going to take responsi-
bility for what we are about to do that 
doesn’t make any sense whatsoever? 
With that being said, let’s make sure 
that the money we are putting in the 
system is fixing the medical end of it, 
finding a cure for this virus, making 
sure that other viruses or pandemics 
don’t attack us. Let’s make sure we are 
doing everything we can with what we 
are responsible for. 
Every leader takes an oath of office. 
When you raise your hand, whether you 
are a mayor or Governor or President, 
whatever, you should be thinking im-
mediately upon taking that oath, what 
can I do to protect the people I am re-
sponsible to represent? If you can’t do 
that, then you are going into the wrong 
job with the wrong ideas, I can assure 
you of that. 
I am saying that I have the most at- 
risk population in the country. It is an 
older population that has done heavy 
lifting and heavy jobs and basically has 
respiratory 
concerns 
and 
ailments. 
They are the most vulnerable, and this 
pandemic can take a horrific toll on 
the population of the State of West 
Virginia if we are not careful with 
what we do. 
We can also change the course of how 
we do business and how we look after 
each other in America. This situation 
is asking all of us and challenging 
every one of us to look to humanity 
with compassion and to bring us to-
gether as a people. The American peo-
ple are a most generous, caring, and 
compassionate people. West Virginians 
treat everybody as their neighbors. 
That is who we are. We must take care 
of our neighbors and reach out and help 
those in need. 
Right now, we have a situation where 
I am concerned. I am concerned that 
all of us have not done our job as well 
as we could have, and we are just 
throwing caution to the wind, thinking 
we can make everybody happy with 
this political coverage because we are 
going to be throwing money at every-
thing, thinking this will take care of 
it. It will not. It will not unless we deal 
with the root problems we have. That 
means fixing our manufacturing base, 
taking care of Americans, making sure 
people who can’t work and who have no 
other recourse, basically have no con-
trol of their destiny—basically provide 
the services. That means the jobs have 
to be there to meet the demand. We cut 
most of that out. Let’s make sure we 
can take care of them and do that 
without bankrupting our future gen-
erations. I think it can be done. 
I will say this. I spoke to Vice Presi-
dent MIKE PENCE last night and told 
him the dire need we were in. I said: 
Mr. Vice President, I know the people 
are thinking that West Virginia has 
been spared. We have not. We haven’t 
been tested. We need more test kits. 
We need more protection for our first 
responders. We need respirators and 
ventilators. We need the tents and 
first-tier operations. We are not in a 
second tier. We are too vulnerable to be 
in that second tier. If you want to stop 
the carnage that could happen if this 
thing breaks loose in my State full- 
fledged, then please help us. 
I want to thank the Vice President 
for basically reaching out and helping 
West Virginia. We are going to get 
through this. There will be a light at 
the end of the tunnel. There will be a 
new day. We will have a chance to 
right the problems we have right now 
that have been of our own making, and 
we can correct them by our own ac-
tions right now. 
I want to thank you, Mr. President. I 
hope all our colleagues are working in 
a bipartisan way. We should be work-
ing together. There are few times this 
opportunity 
comes. 
In 
a 
political 
arena, there are two things that hap-
pen. You better never ever take advan-
tage of a crisis, and make something 
better happen. That is what we are 
dealing with now. 
It is a mandate. People are man-
dating us to do our job. They are man-
dating us to work together, not to be 
irresponsible or act like we are not in

touch with the average person. We are 
because that is whom we represent. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Oregon. 
f 
CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, shortly, 
the Senate will vote on the Paul 
amendment, and I want this body to 
understand why I strongly oppose it. 
The Paul amendment, in its essence, 
has nothing to do with the underlying 
proposal responding to this enormous 
COVID–19 crisis. The Paul amendment 
is a poison pill that essentially focuses 
on an old political issue that this body 
has debated before and very likely is 
going to debate again. I just don’t be-
lieve the Paul amendment has any 
place in a debate on an emergency 
coronavirus bill. 
Every Member of this Senate under-
stands our country is facing and deal-
ing with a national health and eco-
nomic crisis. The country wants us to 
focus like a laser on emergency meas-
ures that can help save lives and keep 
families from falling into destitution. 
The Paul amendment says, in effect, 
that immigrant families with kids are 
going to pay for the emergency with 
their kids’ well-being. These families, 
like so many others, are especially vul-
nerable at this moment. It is just 
wrong to bring misery into their 
homes. 
I would just ask my colleagues to 
save the immigration debates for an-
other time when we are not in the mid-
dle of a pandemic. Today, the focus is 
about that pandemic and acting in an 
emergency, where we come together, 
both political parties, both sides of the 
aisle. When you are dealing with this 
kind of pandemic, your focus is helping 
families and workers, small businesses, 
and all of those people who are walking 
on an economic tightrope. They are not 
getting paychecks, is what we are hear-
ing, and they are trying to figure out 
how to pay the rent. If they pay the 
rent, do they have money for food? If 
they have money for food, what do 
they 
do 
about 
out-of-pocket 
healthcare? Folks want our support 
with those survival issues. 
On the Finance Committee—I am 
very pleased to see the distinguished 
President of this body working with us 
on the Finance Committee. What we 
have tried to do is focus on modern-
izing unemployment insurance. I have 
said to my colleagues: Let’s just face 
it—unemployment is a system that has 
been in a time warp. 
I think we have a very important 
proposal that is going to help an enor-
mous number of people from sea to 
shining sea. We need to do so much 
right now, particularly in terms of sav-
ing lives and getting healthcare to our 
people. 
What I hear from home is people who 
are following this are saying: There is 
so much to do. Act now, then get on 
with the additional steps that have to 
be taken. But for today, get on with 
this. Get on with passing this bill and 
getting ready to move to the next bill. 
Those in need of healthcare and citi-
zens struggling to make it through 
these unprecedented times want action 
now. They all realize that there will be 
several additional pieces of legisla-
tion—hopefully 
sooner 
rather 
than 
later—but our job today is to make 
sure we pass this bill. 
I urge my colleagues, when we vote 
on the Paul amendment very shortly, 
to oppose it. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Kentucky. 
Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, I rise in 
support of my amendment to pay for 
this economic stimulus package by re-
moving less important spending from 
elsewhere in the budget. 
I would ask every American: If you 
were faced with a personal crisis and 
had to spend extra money and you had 
to spend extra money on food and med-
icine—money that you had to borrow 
from 
a 
relative—wouldn’t 
you 
prioritize your resources and imme-
diately stop loaning money to friends 
overseas for their children to go to, for 
example, space camp? Wouldn’t you 
stop funding clown colleges in Argen-
tina? If you had a true emergency like 
this pandemic, wouldn’t you stop build-
ing roads and gas stations in Pakistan? 
If you had a true emergency like this 
corona pandemic, wouldn’t you imme-
diately stop spending money studying 
why drunk people fall down more than 
sober people? 
I ask my colleagues to stop wasting 
money in this time of crisis. Stop being 
a rubberstamp for wasteful spending. 
Do your jobs and prioritize our pre-
cious resources. It is our job and our 
responsibility to conserve these re-
sources. 
Why 
is 
this 
important? 
Why 
shouldn’t we just print or borrow the 
money instead of making cuts in 
things like foreign aid? Because next 
time, maybe in the not too distant fu-
ture, our children may not even be able 
to borrow their way out of a crisis. Our 
dollar will be devalued, our economy 
ruined, and all because we will have 
been profligate fools with our re-
sources; all because we refused to do 
what we were elected to do, which is to 
prioritize the truly vital, such as 
coronavirus relief and medical re-
search, over the extraneous, such as 
spending money on clown colleges, gas 
stations, and roads in Afghanistan. 
To my fellow Americans, remain 
hopeful, remain kind, remain faithful, 
and above all, remain resilient. In the 
world’s history, pandemics are the 
norm, not the exception. It is only re-
cently—in the modern era of anti-
biotics and vaccines—that pandemics 
have become less frequent. 
Ever since vaccines eradicated polio 
and smallpox, modern man has become 
accustomed to the idea that life is rel-
atively safe and that a long life is to be 
expected. Consequently, any re-erup-
tion of diseases beyond our control 
paralyzes us with fear. 
People have forgotten what it is like 
to experience the annual dread of re-
curring infectious disease. My parents 
remember vividly the polio pandemics 
of the 1950s. In one of the last great 
outbreaks of polio, before the vaccine, 
almost 60,000 people contracted polio 
and over 3,100 died. Jonas Salk was 
greeted as a conquering hero for devel-
oping the first widespread polio vac-
cine, but that was nearly 70 years ago. 
In the early 18th century, Dr. Zabdiel 
Boylston showed great courage in in-
troducing inoculation for smallpox. 
Within a generation, smallpox was on 
the wane and ultimately defeated when 
Edward Jenner discovered how to vac-
cinate using the milder cowpox. 
This latest pandemic already has he-
roes—some known, but most of these 
heroes are unknown doctors and nurses 
on 
the 
frontlines. 
The 
innovators 
among us are already putting forth po-
tential treatments and possible cures. 
A half dozen antiviral medications are 
in the final stages of study. Research-
ers believe that an old drug developed 
for malaria may help. Reports indicate 
that scientists will likely set a speed 
record in developing a vaccine. 
Now is not the time for malaise; now 
is the time for optimism. By summer, 
there is a very good chance we will be 
in the recovery phase. Now is not the 
time to give in. 
Several generations have grown up 
unfamiliar with the devastation of 
pandemics, and even now, when it is 
impossible to look the other way, the 
young and healthy rationalize their 
relative safety. Psychologically, it is 
easier for the young and healthy to 
view mortality as something that hap-
pens 
to 
the 
old 
and 
unhealthy. 
Coronavirus scares us because it kills 
not only the old and infirm but the 
young and vibrant, although much less 
frequently. One of the coronavirus’s 
first victims was a 32-year-old, pre-
viously healthy ophthalmologist in 
Wuhan. 
The question is not how serious is the 
pandemic or whether we should act but 
whether there is a plan of action that 
can preserve our economy and lead to a 
quick rebound. 
I don’t think anyone will ever know 
for certain whether grinding the U.S. 
economy to a halt was necessary. Like-
wise, no one can really know the con-
verse—what would have happened had 
we not attempted to slow the virus’s 
spread. It is useful, though, to remem-
ber that just 10 years ago, we suffered 
the swine flu pandemic, and the swine 
flu was no walk in the park. It is esti-
mated that about 60 million Americans 
were infected and over 12,000 people 
died. 
Now experts have said that the 
coronavirus is much more lethal than 
the swine flu—likely true—but world-
wide deaths from the swine flu were es-
timated to be between 150,000 and 
575,000. When calm returns, it will be 
helpful to examine how our responses

S1790 
March 18, 2020 
differed between the swine flu and the 
coronavirus. 
At one time, we were completely 
helpless before the ravages of natural 
disasters, such as infectious diseases, 
but our history is one of great innova-
tion and perseverance. We will survive 
this pandemic. What government does 
to mitigate the calamity should be 
short-lived, temporary, and cause as 
little distortion to the free market 
economy as possible. 
The history of pandemics indicates a 
strong likelihood that the peak of in-
fections and mortality could pass in a 
few weeks to a few months. Congress 
should remain calm and try not to ex-
plode the debt in our response. 
The public should know that Con-
gress has already enacted reforms that 
will free up millions of industrial 
masks to be used by our doctors and 
nurses. Thoughtful sequestration and 
quarantining is in place and helping. In 
addition, I have introduced legislation 
to allow our university labs and ad-
vanced private labs to be able to de-
velop 
additional 
testing 
for 
coronavirus and possible cures by re-
moving redtape at the FDA. 
I do worry, though, that as we go fur-
ther into debt, we may reach a point 
where our debt is so large that we are 
unable to manage the next pandemic. 
We should never forget fiscal responsi-
bility, even in a crisis. We should pay 
for any new Federal funding by taking 
that money from areas of the budget 
where it is not being wisely used. My 
amendment does just that. 
My amendment says that if you want 
to apply for money from the govern-
ment through the child tax credit pro-
gram—this is money the government 
gives to people—then you have to be a 
legitimate person and you have to have 
a Social Security number. We have 
been talking about this reform for a 
decade now, and we never seem to be 
able to get it passed. It has nothing to 
do with not liking immigrants; it has 
to do with saying taxpayer money 
shouldn’t go to nonpeople. You should 
have to be a person to get taxpayer 
money. It just says you have to have a 
Social Security number. People esti-
mate this will save $26 billion. That 
goes a long way toward paying for this 
bill. 
I think we should also end the war in 
Afghanistan. We are spending $50 bil-
lion a year on that war. And it is most-
ly not to fight war. It is to build stuff 
for them. It is to build infrastructure 
for them. We have a lot of problems 
with infrastructure in our own country 
without spending $50 billion a year in 
Afghanistan. 
If we have a true emergency now, it 
is our job to prioritize, to take that 
money from where it is not being spent 
wisely and spend it on something we 
need at the moment. 
My bill also allows the President to 
look throughout the budget and trans-
fer money from any other wasteful 
areas. If you look at our budget, it is 
loaded with waste. Nobody ever culls 
the waste, and then we have an emer-
gency, and they say: Let’s just borrow 
more money. Instead, what we should 
do is we should actually take money 
that is unwisely spent and move it over 
to account for this emergency. 
What I am offering is a very reason-
able proposal. We simply pay for this 
emergency bill by taking money from 
other areas of waste in the budget. 
I yield the floor.

my amendment No. 1556 and ask that 
be it reported by number. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will report the amendment by 
number. 
The legislative clerk read as follows: 
The Senator from Kentucky [Mr. PAUL] 
proposes an amendment numbered 1556. 
The amendment is as follows: 
(Purpose: To amend the Internal Revenue 
Code of 1986 to require a social security 
number for purposes of the child tax credit, 
to provide the President the authority to 
transfer funds as necessary, and to termi-
nate United States military operations and 
reconstruction activities in Afghanistan) 
At the appropriate place, insert the fol-
lowing: 
SEC. lll. SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER REQUIRE-
MENT FOR CHILD TAX CREDIT. 
(a) IN GENERAL.—Paragraph (1) of section 
24(e) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is 
amended to read as follows:

pursuant to subclause (I) (or that portion of 
subclause (III) that relates to subclause (I)) 
of section 205(c)(2)(B)(i) of the Social Secu-

addressing, or ameliorating the coronavirus 
pandemic.

CORONAVIRUS 
Ms. HASSAN. Mr. President, Granite 
Staters are known for our all-hands-on- 
deck spirit—coming together in dif-
ficult times to support our friends and 
neighbors. 
The COVID–19 pandemic has forced 
us all to change our daily routines and 
adjust to new challenges; however, one 
thing that has not changed throughout 
this public health emergency is the 
compassion and empathy we are seeing 
from people all across our State. 
Every month, I recognize a person or 
a group of people in New Hampshire 
who have gone above and beyond to 
help their community. I recognize 
them as the Granite Stater of the 
Month. But this month, I couldn’t 
choose just one person and, instead, 
wish to recognize all Granite Staters 
for coming together to try to slow the 
spread of this virus and to help those in 
need. 
All across New Hampshire, people are 
taking commonsense steps, both to 
keep themselves healthy and to avoid 
unknowingly passing along the virus to 
others, particularly those who are at 
high risk. This includes washing your 
hands thoroughly and for at least 20 
seconds and wiping down frequently 
touched surfaces, like cell phones and 
door handles. It also means practicing 
social distancing by going out in public 
only when absolutely necessary and 
keeping at least 6 feet between you and 
another person. 
We have also seen that events people 
look forward to all year, like the Bos-
ton Marathon or St. Patrick’s Day fes-
tivities, have been canceled or post-
poned. People are following public 
health officials’ guidelines by staying 
at home and canceling long-awaited 
travel plans. 
Taking these necessary measures is 
hard and unpleasant, but it has been 
inspiring to see how many people are 
willing to make these sacrifices to pro-
tect the public health. 
Additionally, 
many 
people 
might 
contract only mild symptoms from 
COVID–19, especially those who are 
younger and in good health; however, 
it is heartening that so many of those 
individuals recognize how important it 
is to protect others who might be at 
higher risk, like those over 60 or people 
living with chronic health conditions. 
As many Americans know, it is also 
crucial that we don’t overwhelm our 
healthcare system and prevent an in-
flux of patients from crowding hos-
pitals, which could lead to a shortage 
of critical medical equipment and per-
sonal protective gear. Collective ac-
tions, like staying home and mini-
mizing interactions with others, will be 
crucial in combating this public health 
emergency. 
As people’s lives continue to experi-
ence disruption, I have been inspired to 
see such a tremendous outpouring of 
support from people all across New 
Hampshire in an effort to help one an-
other during this very difficult time. 
For instance, nonprofits, food pantries, 
and volunteers are partnering with 
local schools in New Hampshire to 
combat food insecurity in their com-
munities. One school district held a 
food drive over the weekend with a 
local nonprofit. They were concerned 
that given the last-minute nature of 
the event, there would be low partici-
pation. To their surprise, the school re-
ported that the community came out 
in droves to donate goods. 
Stories like this are abundant in 
communities across my State, and I 
am immensely proud of how people 
across New Hampshire have come to-
gether to respond to this public health 
emergency. 
In the coming weeks and months, it 
will be even more important that Gran-
ite Staters and all Americans lean on 
one another for support. I encourage 
everyone to reach out to your neigh-
bors, especially those at higher risk, to 
see what you can do to help. If you 
have an older neighbor, see if they need 
help picking up their groceries. If you 
know someone who is a medical profes-
sional with young kids at home, ask if 
you can babysit. 
Right now, it is important for people 
to remember what we can all do to help 
contain the spread of this virus and 
that we all have a role to play in doing 
so. In New Hampshire, we pull to-
gether, and we help one another to get 
through challenging times, and I know 
we can come together to slow the 
spread of this virus. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Texas. 
Mr. 
CORNYN. 
Mr. 
President, 
as 
healthcare professionals, first respond-
ers, and communities across our coun-
try work around the clock to fight the 
spread of the coronavirus, our tele-
visions and news feeds have been filled 
with a lot of numbers—the number of 
new cases reported each day, the rising 
number of fatalities, unfortunately, 
and the volatile ups and downs of the 
stock market. All of this data paints a 
picture of the widening scope of this 
outbreak on a national scale, but it 
fails to represent the impact it is hav-
ing on individuals and on small busi-
nesses in our communities. 
I think of people like Joe Kenney, 
who opened Cobbleheads Bar & Grill in 
Brownsville, TX, nearly 25 years ago. 
Like other restaurant owners around 
the country, he is trying to adapt so he 
can keep his doors open while he fol-
lows guidelines from the Centers for 
Disease Control and Prevention. He 
canceled the restaurant’s popular St. 
Patrick’s Day celebration and, instead, 
offered corned beef and cabbage as a 
takeout option, but he is nervous about 
just how long he can hold on and how 
he will be able to stay afloat. 
Joe said: ‘‘Shutting down two, three, 
four weeks, you can leave 25 years on 
the table with what we put into this 
place.’’ 
Joe, to his credit, is especially, wor-
ried about his more than 30 employees 
and what will happen to them.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1792 
March 18, 2020 
This is a familiar story for countless 
small businesses and their employees— 
small businesses that are losing cus-
tomers through no fault of their own. 
Erin Willis owns RM 12:20 Bistro in 
northeast 
Dallas. 
When 
she 
heard 
Mayor Johnson’s announcement of lim-
iting restaurants to takeout service, 
she said: ‘‘I just hope we can survive 
this.’’ 
Like Joe, Erin is mostly concerned 
about the well-being of her staff. Hour-
ly workers, particularly those who rely 
on tips, are seeing fewer and fewer op-
portunities to collect paychecks. Erin 
is rotating employees so that everyone 
can have some work, but the fears 
about how long this could last are real-
ly settling in. 
She said: 
The service industry is their livelihood. If 
we all close, they literally have nothing. 
As more and more Americans are 
staying home, small businesses and 
their employees are the hardest hit, 
but the impact does not end with them. 
The hard stop on large gatherings 
doesn’t just mean businesses, schools, 
and workplaces are shutting down; it 
means vital community events, includ-
ing things like blood drives, are being 
canceled. 
Officials from the South Texas Blood 
& Tissue Center said this has put their 
community blood supply at risk of col-
lapse, and while this isn’t related to 
treating those who have been diag-
nosed with the coronavirus, it is vital 
to the ongoing, everyday work of our 
healthcare system. Blood donations 
help people who lose blood during 
major surgeries or after having suf-
fered traumatic injuries. They also 
help those who have chronic conditions 
and require occasional blood trans-
fusions. 
Hospitals and donation centers are 
taking every precaution to protect do-
nors while they are fulfilling the need 
of blood donations, and I encourage all 
Texans who are healthy and at low risk 
of contracting the coronavirus to con-
sider donating blood. During times like 
these, when it is, perhaps, easy to feel 
that circumstances are beyond your 
control, this is one small step each of 
us can take to support our commu-
nities. 
I know this is a time of serious un-
certainty for both the physical and fi-
nancial health of our families and our 
country, but I want to assure my con-
stituents—the 29 million people I am 
privileged to represent in the State of 
Texas—that the Senate is working to 
provide them with the relief that we 
can. 
Less than 2 weeks ago, the President 
signed a bill we passed that provided 
$8.3 billion in emergency funding to 
combat the virus, which has sent vital 
funding toward treating and preventing 
the spread of the virus, including to-
ward the purchase of masks and per-
sonal protective equipment, as well as 
in supporting the development of a vac-
cine, possible treatments, and more 
diagnostics. This was an important 
first step toward bolstering our re-
sponse in the early phases of commu-
nity spread, and now we are working to 
address the larger impact this virus is 
having on American workers, families, 
and our economy. 
Soon, the Senate will take another 
bipartisan step of providing support by 
passing the Families First Coronavirus 
Response Act. This legislation will go a 
long way in providing immediate relief 
for those who are struggling to make 
ends meet during this challenging 
time. 
It creates a new Federal emergency 
paid sick leave program for those who 
are 
impacted 
by 
the 
coronavirus. 
Whether workers are diagnosed with 
the virus or are caring for dependents 
who are affected, they will be able to 
take up to 10 days of paid sick leave, 
and many Texas workers will have ac-
cess to 12 weeks of paid leave in order 
to care for dependents because of 
coronavirus-related school closures. 
This legislation makes important 
changes to unemployment insurance to 
ensure that Texans can take advantage 
of these benefits during this time of 
uncertainty. 
It also provides food security for 
Americans of all ages, from school-
children who rely on free lunches at 
school to seniors who are unable to 
leave their homes, for every American 
deserves access to basic nutrition. 
This bill also makes coronavirus 
testing free of charge for all Ameri-
cans, and it includes a range of meas-
ures to support the healthcare profes-
sionals 
who 
are 
literally 
on 
the 
frontlines of this fight. 
I proudly support the bill, and I am 
eager to get it to the President for his 
signature. We shouldn’t delay in send-
ing it to his desk. We have been able to 
come together and move two bills 
through 
Congress 
that 
support 
healthcare 
workers, 
neighbors, 
and 
communities that are being impacted 
by the coronavirus. I hope this trend of 
bipartisanship will continue in the 
coming weeks and months as we work 
to build on the actions we have already 
taken. 
I echo the comment made by the ma-
jority leader that this is only the be-
ginning of our efforts to support our 
country. We will keep working this 
week and next and for however long it 
takes in order to assist American 
workers and families, to support our 
local businesses, and to secure both the 
immediate and long-term viability of 
our economy. Via three task forces, the 
Senate has already begun the work of 
putting together the next economic re-
covery legislation, and we will not 
leave until we get that bill passed, too. 
While most Americans’ daily lives 
have been upended by the spread of the 
coronavirus, there are countless men 
and women who continue to go to work 
and fill critical needs in our society. 
We owe a debt of gratitude to the dedi-
cated healthcare professionals who are 
on the frontlines of this pandemic; to 
the scientists who are working dili-
gently to develop a vaccine; to the first 
responders who are continuing to ex-
pose their own health for our safety; to 
the farmers and ranchers and producers 
who are keeping us fed; to the grocery 
store employees who are restocking 
shelves; and to the countless others 
who are leaving their homes and their 
families each morning to keep us safe 
and healthy. We need to say thank you 
to each of them. As these men and 
women continue doing everything they 
can to respond to the spread of the 
coronavirus, the Senate will do the 
same. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING

The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to 
call the roll. 
Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded.

LOEFFLER). Without objection, it is so

AMENDMENT NO. 1559 
Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I 
call up amendment No. 1559, as pro-
vided for under the previous order. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will report. 
The legislative clerk read as follows: 
The Senator from Washington [Mrs. MUR-
RAY] proposes an amendment numbered 1559. 
Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the read-
ing be dispensed with. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
(The amendment is printed in today’s 
RECORD under ‘‘Text of Amendments.’’) 
Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I 
have been in the Senate during 9/11, for 
Hurricane Katrina, for the 2008 finan-
cial crisis, and I still have never expe-
rienced anything like what we are see-
ing today. These are truly extraor-
dinary circumstances, and the stories I 
am hearing from my constituents and 
from people across the country are 
crushing. Some of the most heart-
breaking stories are the ones about 
people who want to do the right thing 
in this moment but are having to 
choose between staying home, as public 
health experts say we must, and paying 
the rent or putting food on the table. 
I am hearing from workers like 
Cristal Westwood from Auburn, WA. 
She and her husband just welcomed 
their first child on February 7 of this 
year. They both have autoimmune dis-
eases, but her husband’s job is not al-
lowing him to work from home. And 
she says: 
This is an extremely stressful situation for 
our family. We have the option for my hus-
band to take leave without pay for the next 
month or so, but that would mean we 
wouldn’t have any income coming in to sup-
port our family. He could use up all of his 
sick and vacation time, but that would mean 
he doesn’t have any left for the rest of the 
year in case something happens. Both of 
those options don’t seem right. 
I agree. That is not right. A pastor in 
Tukwila, WA, shared similar concerns

S1793 
March 18, 2020 
from a parent in their congregation 
with school-aged children who worries: 
What if they call off school? I don’t have 
anyone to care for the kids. Then, without a 
paycheck, we will get evicted. As it is, we al-
ready run close to eviction every month. 
Since that time, all of our schools in 
Washington State are closed. 
And then there is Chris, who lives in 
Seattle, works in a grocery store, and 
is at high risk for coronavirus. She 
writes: 
It’s an awful decision: Go to work and put 
your life at risk, or lose your job, lose your 
income, and lose your insurance. I haven’t 
committed either way at this point. I’m try-
ing to find a way to stay home. 
I am not just hearing from workers 
but from small business owners, as 
well, across our State, people who own 
restaurants and shops. Everyone from 
farmers to fishers who are used to the 
spring being a time when the phones 
are ringing off the hook. Now no one is 
coming in the door. No one is calling. 
They want to do the right thing for 
their workers, but they don’t have the 
cashflow to keep them on. 
People are scared. They feel they 
have gotten the rug pulled out from 
under them, and they need our help. 
Unfortunately, here is what the Sen-
ator from Wisconsin wants to do. After 
the House overwhelmingly passed a bi-
partisan agreement that includes an 
important step forward to provide 
workers the paid sick leave they need 
in this crisis, his amendment would 
undo that bipartisan work by stripping 
any paid sick leave progress out of the 
bill we are voting on today. 
Instead of helping people keep their 
jobs and their paychecks by providing 
sick leave, Senator JOHNSON’s amend-
ment would force workers to seek com-
pensation through their State unem-
ployment system, meaning they would 
be on their own until they were com-
pensated by the State, and the unem-
ployment system in each State would 
be drastically overburdened at a time 
when workers are going to need it in 
the event they are laid off. 
Democrats are pushing for solutions 
through the unemployment insurance 
to support families and workers in the 
months ahead, but simply using this 
program now as a replacement for paid 
sick leave workers is unacceptable, and 
it is shameful. We have to do better 
than that. 
At a time when families are facing 
impossible decisions, my fellow Sen-
ators face a glaringly simple one. We 
need to be doing as much as we can as 
fast as we can, and his amendment 
would set us backward at the worst 
possible time. 
That is why I am here on the floor to 
offer our amendment, based on legisla-
tion I have worked on with Senator 
GILLIBRAND
and 
Representative 
DELAURO, introduced yesterday. Our 
legislation would simply provide work-
ers with 7 days of accrued paid sick 
leave, 2 weeks of paid emergency days, 
and 12 weeks of paid emergency leave, 
and it would make sure that their em-
ployers can be quickly and fully reim-
bursed by the Treasury Department for 
providing that leave. 
For those who may not be ready just 
yet to agree we need paid sick days and 
paid leave going forward permanently, 
the amended version of this bill that 
we are introducing today and asking 
for a vote on shortly would only pro-
vide this support through December 
2021. 
My No. 1 priority right now is getting 
people the support they need right now 
for this emergency that is at hand, and 
this is a commonsense step. It is good 
for workers who need to stay home if 
they are sick or to take care of their 
family without losing a job or their 
paycheck, and it is good for small busi-
nesses that want to keep their workers 
and communities safe and that are 
struggling to stay afloat during this 
crisis. 
It is the right thing to do for our 
economy, for our public health, and we 
should get it done as soon as possible. 
If we don’t do this, if we let this oppor-
tunity slip by, we are sending a mes-
sage to scared people across the coun-
try that we are still not willing to ac-
knowledge the scope of the tragedy we 
are seeing unfold and not listening to 
the stories like the ones I just shared, 
stories that I know my colleagues have 
heard as well. 
We must not and we cannot send that 
message. People need help; they need 
hope; and they need to see that we are 
willing to do the right thing and pass 
big solutions. So I hope all of our col-
leagues join us in supporting our 
amendment. I want to see this passed 
and sent to the President’s desk as part 
of this response, and by the way, I am 
not going to stop fighting until that 
happens. 
I yield the floor.

ator from New York is recognized.

dent, across New York State and 
around the country, schools are closing 
and businesses are shutting their doors 
as we face this unprecedented crisis. 
This public health emergency has ex-
posed the weakness in our economy 
and in our system. We are not doing 
nearly enough for workers, for their 
families, and those who need to deal 
with medical and financial emergencies 
that this virus has caused. 
Congress has a duty to look out for 
families who are staring down uncer-
tainty, fear, and financial ruin. Our top 
priority must be strengthening our 
public health system and ensuring that 
hard-working Americans, who are fac-
ing this crisis due to no fault of their 
own, can keep their jobs while taking 
care of themselves and their loved 
ones. 
We must also ensure that businesses, 
many of which have been forced to 
close their doors in the name of the 
public good, do not have to cover these 
unexpected costs alone. The PAID 
Leave Act ensures that every worker in 
America has full paid sick and family 
leave. It strengthens their financial 
footing. It gives certainty and con-
fidence to businesses. Congress has a 
responsibility to pass this legislation. 
It is not only a health imperative but 
a financial one too. 
Unfortunately, our colleague, Sen-
ator JOHNSON—his amendment is cyn-
ical 
and 
counterproductive. 
This 
amendment would eliminate paid sick 
and family leave provisions in favor of 
providing coronavirus-infected people 
with unemployment compensation. So 
what he is saying is you have to actu-
ally lose your job if you need to stay 
home to care for a loved one or because 
you are sick yourself, and that is just 
wrongheaded because, the truth is, we 
want people to keep their jobs. We 
want people to have their jobs be there 
when they get better or when their 
family member gets better. We want 
them to have their jobs after they re-
cover themselves. This is why paid 
leave and sick leave is such a better so-
lution than just straight-up unemploy-
ment insurance. 
Workers deserve protections so they 
don’t lose their job just because their 
kids’ school closed, and they need to be 
home to look after them. Wouldn’t any 
employee in America today prefer to 
keep their job and have paid sick leave 
rather than having to quit and take un-
employment insurance? Wouldn’t every 
Member of this body and President 
Trump himself want to keep unemploy-
ment numbers from exploding any fur-
ther than they are already? 
While the unemployment system will 
continue to play a very important role 
for those who have lost their jobs, it 
cannot be the only answer. I thank 
Senator MURRAY for her leadership and 
her steadfast advocacy for family and 
medical leave and paid sick days. This 
amendment is crafted to provide ex-
traordinary economic stimulus and 
support to our businesses when they 
need it absolutely the most, and most 
of all, it is giving certainty because 
people are afraid. They don’t want to 
have to spread coronavirus to every 
person they work with. They don’t 
want to have to leave their children 
unattended at home. They would love 
to stay at work, but under the cir-
cumstances, they cannot. 
Allow them to keep their jobs. Allow 
them to draw down on paid leave while 
their child is at home for a week, a 
month, or 3 months. If they themselves 
are sick, God forbid, make sure they 
are not in the community spreading 
this virus, make sure they can be home 
getting better and reemerging to do 
their work when they are well. 
Democrats stand ready to work with 
Senate Republicans to pass this impor-
tant bill. We need to meet the needs of 
the American people today. This is our 
duty in this grave time of need. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Wisconsin is recognized.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1794 
March 18, 2020 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, the clerk will report the 
amendment by number. 
The bill clerk read as follows: 
The Senator from Wisconsin [Mr. JOHNSON] 
proposes an amendment numbered 1558. 
The amendment is as follows: 
(Purpose: To strike Federally mandated sick 
pay and paid family leave and replace it 
with financial support provided through 
State administered unemployment insur-
ance systems and funds) 
Strike divisions C, E, and G. 
At the end of division D, add the following: 
SEC. ll. SENSE OF CONGRESS. 
It is the sense of Congress that— 
(1) it is the intention of Congress and the 
administration to provide immediate finan-
cial support to workers who will be idled and 
lose pay and benefits because of COVID-19; 
(2) Federally mandated sick pay and paid 
family leave will prompt some employers 
who cannot afford this mandate to preemp-
tively terminate the employment of workers 
they no longer have work for due to cir-
cumstances surrounding COVID-19; 
(3) even without that negative incentive, 
the COVID-19 will cause many Americans to 
lose their jobs, and not be eligible for Feder-
ally mandated sick pay or family and med-
ical leave, so the only income support will be 
unemployment insurance; and 
(4) it would be more efficient to administer 
this Federal financial support for workers 
using only one, rather than two or more pro-
grams. 
SEC. ll. TEMPORARY EMERGENCY FEDERAL 
CORONAVIRUS UNEMPLOYMENT IN-
SURANCE BENEFIT PROGRAM. 
(a) IN GENERAL.—In order to receive the 
credit against the Federal Unemployment 
Tax Act (26 U.S.C. 23), States shall provide 
temporary emergency Federal coronavirus 
unemployment insurance benefits to any in-
dividual who has worked for pay at any time 
in the last 30 days and who for any calendar 
day is not able to engage in employment due 
to any of the following reasons: 
(1) The individual is subject to a Federal, 
State, or local quarantine or isolation order 
related to COVID-19. 
(2) The individual has been advised by a 
health care provider to self-quarantine due 
to concerns related to COVID-19. 
(3) The individual is experiencing symp-
toms of COVID-19 and seeking medical diag-
nosis; 
(4) The individual is caring for an indi-
vidual who is subject to an order as described 
in paragraph (1) or has been advised as de-
scribed in paragraph (2); 
(5) The individual is caring for a son or 
daughter under the age of 18 years of such in-
dividual if the school or place of care of the 
son or daughter has been closed, or the child 
care provider of such son of daughter is un-
available, due to COVID-19 precautions. 
(6) The individual is subject to a temporary 
lay-off under section 604.5(a)(3) of title 20, 
Code of Federal Regulations, due to COVID- 
19. 
(b) WAITING PERIOD.—States shall not re-
quire any waiting period in order to receive 
benefits for those individuals described in 
subsection (a). 
(c) BENEFITS.— 
(1) IN GENERAL.—States shall pay benefits 
to those individuals described in subsection 
(a) on a weekly basis for each calendar day 
an individual is not able to engage in em-
ployment for up to 14 weeks. 
(2) CALCULATION.— 
(A) AMOUNT.—The weekly benefit shall be 
the lesser of— 
(i) two-thirds of the individual’s average 
weekly earnings; or 
(ii) $1,000. 
(B) DETERMINATIONS.—The amount of an 
individual’s average weekly earnings shall be 
determined by the State. 
(d) 
RETROACTIVE
APPLICATION.—States 
shall make temporary emergency Federal 
coronavirus unemployment insurance bene-
fits under this section retroactively avail-
able to March 1, 2020. 
(e) WORK REQUIREMENTS.—Individuals re-
ceiving 
temporary 
emergency 
Federal 
coronavirus unemployment insurance bene-
fits under this section shall not be required 
to search for work. 
(f) FEDERAL REIMBURSEMENTS.—The Fed-
eral government shall— 
(1) reimburse States for the full cost of 
complying with the requirements under this 
section that are above and beyond the bene-
fits currently provided under each State’s 
current unemployment insurance law for 
benefits paid under this program; and 
(2) reimburse any employer who employs 
fewer than 500 employees and who volun-
tarily provides paid leave to an employee for 
the reasons described in subsection (a) an 
amount equal to two-thirds of the actual 
payment made up to $1,000 per week and not 
to exceed $10,000 per employee. 
(g) NATIONAL UNEMPLOYMENT RATE.—For 
purposes of calculating the National unem-
ployment rate, the Bureau of Labor Statis-
tics of the Department of Labor shall not in-
clude workers obtaining temporary emer-
gency Federal coronavirus unemployment 
insurance benefits. 
(h) REGULATORY AUTHORITIES.— 
(1) LABOR.—The Secretary of Labor (or the 
Secretary’s delegate) shall prescribe such 
regulations or other guidance as may be nec-
essary to carry out the purposes of this sec-
tion.

(or the Secretary’s delegate) shall prescribe 
such regulations or other guidance as may be 
necessary to carry out the purpose of this 
section. 
(i) SUNSET.—The temporary emergency 
Federal coronavirus unemployment insur-
ance benefit program under this section shall 
expire on the earlier of the date of the termi-
nation of the national emergency declared 
by the President under the National Emer-
gencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1601 et seq.) with re-
spect 
to 
the 
Coronavirus 
Disease 
2019 
(COVID-19) or December 31, 2020. 
ADDITIONAL COSPONSORS 
Mr. JOHNSON. Madam President, I 
ask unanimous consent that Senator 
BLACKBURN, Senator COTTON, Senator 
CRUZ, Senator LOEFFLER, and Senator 
PERDUE be added as cosponsors to my 
amendment No. 1558 to H.R. 6201. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
Mr. JOHNSON. Madam President, I 
ask unanimous consent that I be al-
lowed and the Senator from Pennsyl-
vania be allowed to finish our com-
ments before we start the vote. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
Without objection, it is so ordered. 
Mr. JOHNSON. Madam President, we 
are facing, with the coronavirus, an un-
precedented situation, certainly in my 
lifetime. These are extraordinary times 
we are living in and trying to live 
through, and there is no doubt that ex-
traordinary 
times 
require 
extraor-
dinary measures. 
The good news is that there is a lot of 
agreement in terms of what we need to 
do. We all recognize that Americans 
and American businesses are suffering, 
through no fault of their own, and they 
need help. We all want to provide that 
help. Hopefully, we want to provide 
that effectively and efficiently with as 
few negative, unintended consequences 
as possible. 
What I would suggest is, this is really 
no time, though, to follow Rahm 
Emanuel’s famous dictate that you 
should never let a crisis go to waste. 
From my viewpoint, I think one of the 
reasons we have had a more successful 
economy—certainly far more success-
ful than the economy, the slow recov-
ery we had out of the 2009 recession—is 
that this administration has focused on 
reducing the regulatory burden. First 
we stopped adding to it, and then we 
actually reduced it. That brought a fair 
amount of optimism and animate spir-
its 
to 
our 
economy 
because 
businesspeople 
could 
actually 
con-
centrate on their products and their 
services rather than looking over their 
shoulders to find out what new govern-
ment regulation was going to cause 
them to hire a new compliance officer, 
increase their cost, and possibly put 
them out of business. 
What I am suggesting is, when we 
provide that help—and we need to pro-
vide that help to both hard-working 
American workers as well as American 
businesses—that we do it in the most 
efficient and effective manner, and we 
do more good than harm. Now, I would 
argue that a new mandate on business 
is going to do a great deal of economic 
harm. It may sound good, but it is not 
the right way to go. 
We will eventually come out of this. 
We will be recovering from economic 
woes. We need to learn the lesson from 
2009, where overregulation hampered 
our recovery. So let’s not add a new 
mandate. I know the House bill is only 
temporary, but temporary becomes 
permanent around this place pretty 
good. As Ronald Reagan once said, the 
closest thing to eternal life in our life-
time is a government program. 
I will also say that my office has 
been flooded with businesses calling in 
also not believing this is only going to 
be temporary and not really having 
confidence in the Rube Goldberg fi-
nancing mechanism for this, again, 
temporary mandate for paid sick and 
family leave. 
The good news is, there is a better 
way, and that is what my amendment 
does. It creates a temporary emergency 
Federal unemployment insurance pro-
gram sitting on top of what already ex-
ists. Rather than having two or three 
or more programs trying to provide 
that funding to workers for whom we 
all want to provide that support, we 
would have basically a single program, 
a single method for doing that using 
State unemployment offices. They are 
already set up to do this. With some 
slight modifications, they would be 
able to handle this, and here would be 
the slight modifications.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1795 
March 18, 2020 
First of all, our bill waives any wait-
ing periods, but then, we also reim-
burse the States for paying unemploy-
ment during that waiting period. We 
have the exact same eligibility as the 
House bill. It is focused on those indi-
viduals affected by the coronavirus, the 
exact same definition. The benefits are 
identical as well. We would provide 
support. We would plus-up the State 
unemployment benefits up to two- 
thirds of employee’s wages, not to ex-
ceed $1,000 a week. 
We also recognize those companies 
that are willing to voluntarily offer 
sick pay and paid family leave by reim-
bursing them up to that same level— 
two-thirds of actual wages, up to $1,000 
per week, no more than $10,000 per em-
ployee. They are the exact same bene-
fits as the House bill. And, of course, 
we actually make ours temporary. 
There will be a great deal of pressure 
on the part of State unemployment 
programs to get out of this as soon as 
they possibly can. But they can accept 
it, accept that Federal help, while they 
need it. 
So our bill sunsets; the earliest 
would be either at the expiration of the 
national declared emergency or on De-
cember 31, 2020. 
This is a commonsense piece of legis-
lation. It does not saddle small busi-
nesses, American businesses, with a 
new mandate that they don’t have a 
great deal of confidence in. It would ac-
tually be funded 100 percent by the 
Federal Government. By the way, the 
House bill does not fund this 100 per-
cent. It leaves gaps. And it would defi-
nitely be temporary in utilizing the ex-
isting programs in the States that are 
sitting on top of it, providing Federal 
support for the workers who are going 
to actually need it as we go through 
this unprecedented event in our Na-
tion’s history. 
With that, I yield the floor to the 
Senator from Pennsylvania. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
PERDUE). The Senator from Pennsyl-
vania. 
Mr. TOOMEY. Mr. President, I thank 
the Senator from Wisconsin for leading 
on this effort. 
I rise in strong support of this 
amendment. The two of us—and I sus-
pect almost everybody in this Cham-
ber—fully support the idea, the goal, 
and the need to provide relief to work-
ers who have been affected by this pan-
demic. That is not what is in dispute 
here. There is a legitimate and serious 
concern about the mechanism by which 
that is provided. 
The House bill imposes a very signifi-
cant administrative burden on the very 
small businesses struggling to survive. 
We are all taking these phone calls 
from all across our States—men and 
women who are operating a business. 
They are on the edge, and they are try-
ing to figure out: How do we stay alive? 
How do we keep this business alive 
until we can come out on the other 
side? They are struggling with all 
kinds of very, very tough decisions 
that they are having to make for the 
first time ever in completely unchart-
ered waters. 
Then this legislation comes along 
and says: Now, by the way, you are 
going to have to figure out and navi-
gate your way through a whole new 
system you have never heard of before, 
and you are going to have to go 
through all the books and the rules and 
regulations and consult your lawyer 
and figure out exactly how you comply 
with this complex, new mechanism so 
that you comply with the law and get 
the reimbursement that is intended. 
That is a huge problem for these folks 
who are struggling to stay alive. 
So what Senator JOHNSON’s amend-
ment does is this: It just shifts the sub-
stantial administrative costs and bur-
dens off the back of the business owner 
and operator and allows it to be man-
aged by the State unemployment sys-
tems that are in the business of pro-
viding compensation. We plus it up, 
and we waive the waiting periods so 
that the individual workers who are 
adversely affected by this COVID–19 
pandemic will still get the benefits 
that we all want them to get. It is just 
a better way to deliver this. 
So I hope my colleagues will vote in 
favor of it. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from New York. 
Mrs. GILLIBRAND. Mr. President, I 
strongly disagree with both of my col-
leagues’ statements because, in fact, 
there is no administrative burden given 
to the small businesses. 
In fact, our bill is doing exactly what 
the small businesses want, which is to 
provide direct payments to the busi-
nesses—not a tax credit that they get 
many months in the future but direct 
payments to them. 
I don’t think unemployment insur-
ance given to the States is going to re-
sult in immediate relief for the em-
ployees who need it. Again, you are 
creating a false structure. Requiring 
people to quit their jobs so they can 
care for a child who has been sent from 
school is absurd. It is far better to have 
a national paid leave program in this 
country. And unlike what my colleague 
said, it is not permanent; it is tem-
porary, and there is no administrative 
burden. 
I yield the floor.

The bill (H.R. 6201) was passed. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under 
the previous order, the motion to re-
consider is considered made and laid 
upon the table. 
The majority leader. 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President, 
we just passed the bill that came over 
from the House, and it is on its way to 
the President. It is a very important 
first step, which we are calling phase 2. 
We continue to work on the next bill 
to respond to the crisis. I want to re-
peat again that the Senate is going to 
stay in session until we finish phase 3, 
the next bill, and send it over to the 
House. 
Now, Republicans hope, shortly, to 
have a consolidated position along with 
the administration. Then we intend to 
sit down with our Democratic col-
leagues to see what we can agree to. 
I would recommend that Senators 
stay around, close. Just how long it 
will take to get through these steps is 
unclear, but as everyone knows, we are 
moving rapidly because the situation 
demands it.

CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. LANKFORD. Madam President, 3 
months ago, no one in the country—in 
fact, no one in the world—had heard 
the 
term 
‘‘COVID–19.’’ 
The 
term 
‘‘coronavirus’’ was around, but most 
folks didn’t use that because it was 
connected to SARS or to MERS in the 
past. 
In December of 2019, an infection 
started in China, and it spread rapidly 
through the Wuhan region. By Janu-
ary, there were thousands of people af-
fected before most of the world even 
knew it existed. Now, almost every 
country in the world has infections. We 
have hundreds of thousands of people 
who have had contact with this virus, 
and unfortunately we have lost thou-
sands of people worldwide. 
In the United States, the numbers 
continue to increase as we are con-
tinuing to increase the number of peo-
ple we can actually test. Fortunately, 
the vast majority of the people who get 
this virus have little to no symptoms. 
It is a cold; it is a mild flu to them. 
But for our vulnerable populations— 
our elderly populations, those with 
heart issues, those with lung issues, 
smokers, diabetics—this can be a very, 
very serious thing. 
The 
challenge 
we 
face 
in 
our 
healthcare is that every person who 
walks in to get tested is face to face 
with one of our healthcare workers, es-
pecially in rural areas of our State, 
who may be the only healthcare profes-
sional for that entire county. If that 
person—who has not been vaccinated 
as well because there is no vaccine 
yet—is not able to serve the rest of the 
population, that health situation be-
comes even worse because of dimin-
ishing care. 
We, as Americans, have taken this 
seriously, as we should. We are paying 
attention. The younger population is 
spending time trying to get away from 
other individuals, to self-isolate, to 
self-quarantine—‘‘social distancing’’ is 
the new term—to find some way to not 
be close to someone else so they don’t 
accidentally pass the virus on, because 
although the virus may be within them 
and they are not personally physically 
affected much, the effect on someone 
else could be pretty dramatic. So, out 
of respect for others, they are trying to 
manage that distance and be attentive 
to that. 
There have been multiple actions 
from the government over the past sev-
eral months. There are the travel bans 
we all know very much about, starting 
with China and now in multiple areas 
of the world, and lots of encourage-
ment to limit gatherings, first to 250 
and then to 50 and now to 10. Now it is 
a series of just keep social distancing, 
to make sure you are aware of that. 
There have been emergency declara-
tions. 
CMS has changed coverage, as re-
cently 
as 
yesterday, 
dealing 
with 
issues like telehealth, making sure in-
dividuals who may have other care 
needs don’t have to actually go in to a 
healthcare professional—for their fear 
of who else is sitting in the waiting 
room—but they can get access to tele-
health, which is a much needed change. 
The FDA has been very aggressive in 
giving access to different States to do 
their own testing regimens. 
The CDC has been active in trying to 
get to a point where they can get a 
testing system that can actually get 
out to the entire country. The chal-
lenge was, early on, many other coun-
tries did tests and developed tests with 
a high false-positive rate. The CDC was 
very focused on trying to get as accu-
rate as it possibly could. That meant it 
took longer, and we don’t have the 
tests out. The tests are more accurate, 
but we don’t have the tests in the num-
bers we need at the moment we needed 
them, which was last week. So now we 
are still struggling to catch up on test-
ing all over the country. 
Multiple other labs and multiple uni-
versities are also coming on board. In

fact—it is interesting—multiple other 
countries are also developing their own 
testing processes. In the days ahead, 
we will be able to catch up on the test-
ing so that any American could be able 
to get testing, but for now, it is lim-
ited. 
In States like my State of Oklahoma, 
where the virus is beginning its accel-
eration—we were late in actually get-
ting the virus coming to Oklahoma, 
but now that the virus is there, it 
starts to accelerate, and testing is ex-
ceptionally important to us, as it is to 
everyone else. 
The Department of Transportation is 
engaged on things like waivers for 
hours of service to allow the movement 
of goods all over the country dealing 
with livestock and with food. 
There has been a big push from just 
about every retailer in the country to 
make sure they are cleaning facilities 
more and being open and accessible and 
having hours early in the morning for 
those in the most vulnerable popu-
lations so they are not shopping with 
people who may have the virus and 
don’t even know it. 
There has been a shift around the 
country 
to 
encourage 
people 
to 
telework or to find ways to separate in 
their place of work. 
All of these things have occurred just 
in the last few months. Again, 3 
months ago, none of us knew this term 
or this virus existed. All of this is hap-
pening extremely rapidly. 
Three weeks ago, Congress and the 
President agreed on a proposal—it was 
a wide bipartisan proposal—to deal 
with additional funding for testing, ad-
ditional funding for vaccine develop-
ment, additional funding for State and 
local departments of health to make 
sure they are taking care of that. My 
own State of Oklahoma has already re-
ceived almost $7 million to help with 
what is happening in our county, and 
we are in desperate need of those dol-
lars to get that done. 
Vaccine development is already in 
human trials now. It is in phase 1. It 
will take multiple months to get that 
done, but we have already begun that 
process. That is important to us. 
The bill that was on the floor today 
dealt with multiple helpful things. It 
expands SNAP—what some people still 
call food stamps, but it is supplemental 
nutrition. It is assistance for those 
families. It is an expansion of that. 
It also deals with unemployment in-
surance benefits to make sure those 
are staying consistent and those get 
extended to people who are going to 
need them because in the past week, 
unemployment has dramatically in-
creased all over the country. In the 
days ahead, when we see the numbers, 
we will see the difference between what 
is happening this week versus the week 
before versus the week before that. 
The struggle is, my phones have been 
filled with one other element that is in 
that bill, and that deals with a man-
date on small businesses for sick leave. 
Small businesses in my State are 
closed. 
Many 
retailers 
and 
res-
taurants—many small businesses are 
really struggling with how they are 
going to pay for this when they have no 
income coming in right now. They are 
hearing the promise of a Federal reim-
bursement coming to them, but they 
don’t know when that is coming, and 
they are literally teetering on the edge 
right now. Their struggle: Please don’t 
do something that pushes us over the 
edge. We need help, but we don’t need 
a bureaucracy that is going to be slow 
to respond or a way that is actually 
going to get us some help but help that 
comes to us too late. 
I have heard these terrifying words 
from multiple employers: I cannot 
make it with that structure. I am 
going to have to lay people off and 
hope to be able to hire them back when 
this all ends. 
For those families who are laid off 
and in unemployment now, this is a 
very different day for them. My fear is 
that some of what pushed some of 
those individuals over the edge into un-
employment was a nudge to say we are 
going to add one more mandate to you 
at your worst possible economic mo-
ment. 
The first principle we should have as 
Congress is, do no harm. We need to 
step in and help those folks who need 
help. There are lots of ideas being ban-
tered around by the Senate and the 
House, from both sides of the aisle, to 
figure out how we can get help as rap-
idly as we can to as many people as we 
can. 
This is a moment unlike what we 
have seen before where it is not that 
the economy is crashing because of 
some economic foundation that is not 
there; it is fear and panic that is glob-
al, that literally we are struggling with 
‘‘what if’’ and the CDC and our own 
governments saying to employers: It 
would be best if you closed for a sea-
son. And they, being good citizens and 
good neighbors, quite frankly, are com-
plying with that out of fear for their 
own business and for their own employ-
ees. 
I finished my day yesterday—late 
last night—talking to a small business 
owner in Oklahoma who related to me 
what he is going through right now and 
the struggles he is having keeping the 
doors open. Quite frankly, he was fairly 
blunt with me to say: The things that 
are being passed in the bill tomorrow 
will affect me, but my competitors 
that are big companies—it doesn’t af-
fect them. It is already hard enough for 
me as a small business to compete with 
them, and now I have a new mandate 
on me that is not a mandate on them, 
and it makes it even harder, and I 
don’t think I will have the cash flow to 
be able to make this work. 
Toward the end of the conversation, 
he paused and literally began to cry, 
and he pulled himself together and 
said: I am having to call people and tell 
them ‘‘I don’t have hours for you next 
week,’’ and these are people I care 
about. 
We need to take action, but we need 
to take action that helps people keep 
their jobs, helps people stay employed, 
and helps us deal with the dip in the 
economy right now to help them pull 
back out. My fear is that we didn’t do 
that just now. We might have just 
made it worse. 
There are important things for us to 
do, and many of those things we are 
working on this week. We have to get 
help to as many people as we can, as 
fast as we can. It is my hope that the 
Senate will continue to stay in ses-
sion—as the leader has already said 
and promised that it would—until we 
actually come to some proposals where 
we have wide bipartisan agreement 
that can get help rapidly to the people 
who need the help the most: those 
workers, those individuals who are 
struggling, the folks who are hourly, 
those folks who are waiters and wait-
resses, those folks who work at the cof-
fee shop and own the coffee shop, and 
those folks in retail locations that are 
shut down. They need us to stand with 
them, and this is our moment to do it. 
Let’s do it together. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Massachusetts. 
f 
CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. MARKEY. Madam President, I 
want to start my remarks by saying to 
the people of Massachusetts and fami-
lies all across the country: Many of 
you are making big sacrifices—quaran-
tining yourselves, postponing or can-
celing 
major 
events, 
dealing 
with 
closed schools and daycare. We are 
grateful. 
Right now, our primary goal needs to 
be to slow the spread of this virus, and 
we all share in that responsibility. So 
we thank you for everything you are 
doing to keep your loved ones and ev-
eryone else’s loved ones safe at this 
time. 
We are at war with the coronavirus, 
and we need a massive wartime manu-
facturing mobilization for coronavirus 
testing kits and personal protective 
equipment for medical personnel and 
emergency responders. That is why, 
last weekend, I was the first to call on 
President Trump to immediately use 
existing authorities under the Defense 
Production Act to bring all of the 
power of the Federal Government to 
bear in mobilizing industry to meet 
this crisis. It is why I authored the 
Senate resolution calling on him to do 
so. It is why I spoke directly to Vice 
President PENCE yesterday to urge the 
administration to take this critical ac-
tion, and I am glad they are doing so. 
The Defense Production Act allows 
the Federal Government to direct sup-
plies of critical materials and equip-
ment that our hospitals and first re-
sponders need. It allows us to mobilize 
industry to expand production and 
gives us the power to coordinate indus-
try to respond to this crisis. We need to 
fully use all of those powers that are 
provided under this law.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1798 
March 18, 2020 
That is why I am so glad President 
Trump has today invoked the power of 
the Defense Production Act to respond 
to the coronavirus crisis. I am glad he 
is exercising it. I am glad that after my 
conversation 
yesterday 
with 
Vice 
President PENCE, they decided to put 
this on the agenda for our country. 
We need to massively increase pri-
vate production of the lifesaving per-
sonal protective equipment, medical 
supplies and devices, and diagnostic 
testing supplies we need to combat this 
viral enemy. We need to activate our 
capable and talented domestic industry 
and bring the full weight of the Federal 
Government behind this effort. 
We are talking about gowns, gloves, 
face shields, surgical masks, N95 res-
pirators, 
ventilators, 
disinfectant 
wipes, and hand sanitizers. We do not 
have nearly enough of this lifesaving 
equipment. 
For instance, the U.S. Department of 
Health and Human Services estimates 
that the United States could need up to 
3.5 billion respirator masks. Let me say 
that again. Our own Department of 
Health and Human Services says that 
we could need upwards of 3.5 billion 
respirator masks. But our strategic na-
tional stockpile, the country’s emer-
gency medical supply bank, holds only 
a tiny fraction of that, just 12 million 
respirator masks—not 3.5 billion but 12 
million. 
The medical community calls this 
personal protective equipment ‘‘PPE,’’ 
but ‘‘PPE’’ also stands for a ‘‘promise 
to protect everyone,’’ and this is a 
promise we should make and keep for 
our hospital personnel, first respond-
ers, and patients. Invoking the powers 
of the Defense Production Act will help 
ensure that we can keep this promise 
to our American heroes who are on the 
frontlines of battling this epidemic. 
I have been in regular contact with 
the Massachusetts Health and Hospital 
Association 
and 
the 
Massachusetts 
Nurses Association, and both have 
issued a terrible alarm: There are in-
sufficient medical equipment and sup-
plies to test and treat affected individ-
uals and protect healthcare workers 
and first responders. For example, the 
Berkshire hospital told me that they 
required 3,500 respirator masks a day. 
That is 35,000 in just 10 days for the 
Berkshire hospital, which is in the 
least populated part of our State—for 
just that one smaller hospital. Yet the 
entire State of Massachusetts recently 
received only 70,000 of these respirator 
masks. That is not nearly enough. We 
do not want our nurses and our doctors 
reusing or rationing masks. 
Additionally, 
hospitals 
and 
labs 
across the Nation are trying to ramp 
up testing capacity but face shortages 
in test kits and supplies. But we need 
to dramatically scale up testing and 
ensure our continued ability to test. 
Our Nation must be able to conduct 
tens or hundreds of thousands of tests 
daily, ultimately testing millions of 
people over the course of our response. 
That means producing swabs, which we 
are now running short of, and other 
testing materials. 
We have used the Defense Production 
Act before—during the Korean war—to 
mobilize defense infrastructure and 
during the Cold War. Make no mistake, 
we are facing an equally deadly enemy 
in this virus, and we need to bring all 
of our authority and resources to bear 
to defeat it. 
All of us owe a debt of gratitude to 
our frontline health and medical care 
workforce. They don’t have a roadmap 
for what is happening right now. It is 
unprecedented. They just have skills, a 
commitment, and the hearts of heroes. 
We owe them the resources they need 
to be protected in order to do their 
jobs. 
Sadly, this pandemic is going to get 
worse before it gets better. I had been 
calling for the President to declare a 
national emergency, which he finally 
did last week. Now that he has done so, 
we need Massachusetts to get all of the 
funding that is due. I have been in reg-
ular contact with Governor Baker and 
Mayor Walsh, and I will support their 
requests for Federal resources. 
As the Senate works on an economic 
relief package that matches the scale 
of this crisis, we need to ensure that we 
put people and family first—no half 
measures, no hidden bailouts and give-
aways just to big corporations: paid 
sick time for all workers; unemploy-
ment insurance for all workers, includ-
ing for tipped workers, gig workers, 
contractors, home workers; expansion 
of SNAP, WIC, and other food security 
programs; no evictions, no cutting off 
of utilities, no cutting off of Wi-Fi; 
halting all deportations and releasing 
of detained immigrants who pose no 
threat to public safety; provide free Wi- 
Fi to low-income households with stu-
dents who cannot afford it but are 
going to be at home because of school 
closures so that we don’t have a huge 
homework gap that now explodes in 
our country, as poorer children don’t 
have access to the Wi-Fi technology at 
home, so they can learn at the same 
pace that kids who just happen to live 
in wealthier families will have. We can-
not allow that to happen. These kids 
should be able to learn at home, re-
gardless of their income. We need free 
Wi-Fi for those kids. We have to reim-
burse our States and cities and Tribes. 
They are bearing the brunt of this cri-
sis, and they need resources imme-
diately. 
My commitment to protecting the 
health professionals, ensuring the con-
sumers, workers, and families of Mas-
sachusetts get relief from the impacts 
of the coronavirus is my No. 1 priority. 
We have to protect the small busi-
nesses in our country. We have to 
make sure they receive the resources 
they need. Millions and millions of 
small businesses right now are feeling 
enormous stress. We have to make it 
possible for them to receive the relief 
they need, the help they need in order 
to survive, and we have to put upfront 
whatever the capacity is to make sure 
they get the resources they need. If 
that system in our country, where 48 
percent of all workers are employed— 
small businesses in our country—and 
they are living on the margin, then we 
are going to have an economic catas-
trophe by August or September where 
millions of these small businesses will 
just declare bankruptcy. That is the 
bottom-line economic fact of the mat-
ter. We have to give them help, and we 
have to make sure we have the re-
sources inside the Federal Govern-
ment—the personnel—that will ensure 
we can deliver that relief too. 
To the people of Massachusetts, I 
want you to know I am here for you, 
and I will help any of you individually 
who need any assistance during this 
emergency. This current moment may 
call for distancing and isolation, but 
we cannot and should not sever our 
basic human connections to one an-
other because we are all in this to-
gether. 
I want to end with the most impor-
tant remark. We must continue to lis-
ten to the guidance of scientists and 
medical professionals. This pandemic is 
unprecedented and will require an un-
precedented mobilization and response 
at every level of society. We can get 
through this, but it will require a com-
mitment from every single one of us. 
We are one big family in the United 
States. Many families are going to be 
suffering. It is going to be our job to 
make sure that we protect those fami-
lies, and it is the job of this institution 
to do so. We are the legislative first re-
sponders. We are the ones who have to 
provide the resources that then allow 
the first responders, the families in 
every community across our country 
to have the resources to help everyone 
in our society. That is our goal. 
A pandemic should know no partisan-
ship. Let us come together and produce 
the big package our country right now 
so desperately needs. 
With that, I yield back. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Kansas.

CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. 
MORAN. 
Madam 
President, 
thank you very much. This has been a 
trying and difficult and challenging 
time in our country and in my home 
State of Kansas. There are lots of con-
versations, care, and compassion going 
on. We can’t give anybody a hug these 
days. We can’t extend a hand—at least 
literally—but we are extending a hand 
to all of our friends and our neigh-
bors—those 
across 
our 
community, 
those across our State, and across the 
country. 
I am troubled, of course, by what cir-
cumstances Americans find themselves 
in. There are those who are in a poor 
circumstance in which they can re-
cover from the circumstances that we 
face. I want to make sure that Kansans 
know that we hear their cries, that we 
know of their problems, and that work 
is afoot to try to make a difference.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1799 
March 18, 2020 
Just a couple of examples of things 
that perhaps, in the overall scale of 
where we are, don’t seem significant 
enough but can make a difference in in-
dividual lives and families’ well-being: 
We have been successful to this point 
in getting the school lunch program 
available for students whose schools 
are no longer in session, who don’t go 
to the classroom, and therefore aren’t 
in the school lunchroom. The USDA 
and the school food program are now 
available for those who are at home be-
cause their school classes have been 
canceled as a result of the virus. 
We are paying a lot of attention, as I 
hope Kansans know and Americans 
know, to the veteran and the veteran 
community. We have had success in 
passing 
legislation 
on 
the 
Senate 
floor—waiting 
for 
House 
consider-
ation—that will allow those veterans 
who are no longer in the classroom, in 
a university, or in a technical college 
and are now learning by distance edu-
cation, by technology, to be able to 
continue to receive their GIeducational 
benefits. That required a change in the 
law, and it is in the works so that 
those benefits continue, even though 
the student is not, as now required, in 
a classroom itself. 
We are trying to make sure the De-
partment of Veterans Affairs has the 
resources necessary to meet the needs 
of our veterans. It is a vulnerable popu-
lation because of the age and existing 
condition of many of our veterans. We 
are in constant contact not only with 
the Department of Veterans Affairs but 
with veterans themselves and with our 
veteran hospitals and clinics and other 
healthcare providers in Kansas. 
Today, we are dealing with economic 
relief for those who are losing their 
job, fearful of losing their job, or have 
already lost their job. Much of life’s 
meaning comes from our employment, 
from what we do. A job is certainly 
something that helps put food on a 
family’s table and provides some secu-
rity for an individual, but it also pro-
vides meaning. No one can understand, 
unless they are without a job, how dev-
astating that can be. 
I am pleased by the number of busi-
ness men and women who have called 
me to tell me the last thing they want 
to do is lay off anyone who works in 
their business. We have been through 
economic difficulties before. We have 
seen the cycle of the economy, the ups 
and downs, the normal flows, but this 
is something totally different from 
that. 
Oil and gas—the price of oil is such 
that keeping our oil and gas producers 
in Kansas in business is a real chal-
lenge. Aviation manufacturing is an 
important component of the Kansas 
economy, and today Textron indus-
tries, which manufactures Cessna air-
craft and Beechcraft, announced they 
are furloughing 7,000 of their 9,000 
workers. That is on top of other chal-
lenges in the aviation industry in 
which 
Spirit 
AeroSystems, 
headquartered in Kansas, has already 
laid off 2,800 employees. 
From the oil and gas industry of 
Western and South Central and East-
ern Kansas to the manufacturing hub 
of Wichita and South Central Kansas, 
the consequences of the coronavirus 
are real and felt in the pocketbook, felt 
in the brain, and felt in the heart. Our 
restaurants, hotels, our car rental 
agencies, and those who serve others— 
I have been in circumstances this week 
in visiting with the people who work at 
a restaurant, the people who work at a 
cafe, the people who work here in 
Washington, DC, at the cafeteria where 
I had breakfast this morning. Those 
who have jobs wonder if they are going 
to have jobs tomorrow, and those who 
have already lost jobs wonder how they 
are going to pay the bills. 
This morning I had a conversation 
with an optometrist telling me the cir-
cumstances of no longer being able to 
care for patients except in the emer-
gency setting, which means that the 
business in the optometrist office—an 
important 
healthcare 
provider—and 
the business in the dental office has 
been curtailed, and the necessity of 
considering laying off the clinical 
workers there is front and center in 
that conversation. 
It is a troublesome situation across 
Kansas. It does not matter what city or 
town you live in. If you are a farmer, 
the cattle prices today are signifi-
cantly depressed, despite the fact that 
it is still pretty expensive at the gro-
cery store. 
I think about my hometown and the 
loss of a business. There aren’t many 
businesses in many rural communities 
in Kansas, and many businesses don’t 
really earn much of a living or a profit. 
It could be a family circumstance; it 
could be this is what they did; this is 
what their parents did; this could be a 
service to the community; and they 
live on a lot less because that business 
is important to a small community. 
But this kind of challenge is such that 
if that business closes, the chances are 
that it will not reopen. The financial 
circumstances of smalltown America 
are such that there is little likelihood 
of recovery and reopening. 
The legislation we passed today is 
now on its way to the President. It in-
cluded a few things that I was troubled 
by and think will create significant dif-
ficulties for some. We need to continue 
to work to change those provisions 
that are troublesome and cause prob-
lems. But it was important in my view 
to make certain the things that were 
wrong in that bill didn’t prevent us 
from passing something to help those 
with the things that are right. None of 
our economic efforts that we have to 
make certain people feel more secure 
economically will work until they feel 
more secure in the health and well- 
being of themselves and their families. 
Even though you may get some as-
sistance—a person may get some as-
sistance, a family may be relieved of 
some of the financial burdens they now 
face, a laid-off worker may get unem-
ployment benefits—your mind is al-
ways going to be on the issue of your 
health and the well-being of your chil-
dren and your parents and your grand-
parents, those we know in the nursing 
home and those we know in the nurs-
ery. And as long as we are troubled by 
what may happen to us and our health, 
no amount of economic stimulus can 
overcome the fear of one’s well-being 
and particularly the well-being of their 
spouse, their children, and their par-
ents. 
So clearly economic relief in and of 
itself, in my view, is insufficient. We 
need 
to 
make 
certain 
that 
our 
healthcare providers have the nec-
essary tools to meet the healthcare 
needs of American citizens. Front and 
center in that regard is testing, and we 
are woefully inadequate and undersup-
plied in what we need to test the nec-
essary number of Kansans and Ameri-
cans to know what they face and to 
know what their circumstances are and 
to respond in the medically required 
way. 
We are working to make sure there 
are more tests across the country and 
working to make certain those tests 
are distributed in a way that Kansans 
and their healthcare providers can ac-
cess them. Most recently, we were suc-
cessful in getting CDC to undo a prob-
lem that kept tests from being trans-
ferred to the Kansas Department of 
Health and Environment in my home 
State. We are pleased to see that the 
FDA, for example, has modified the 
necessary steps it takes for a manufac-
turer of these test kits to be certified 
to be qualified to manufacture them. 
And the amount of test kits that are 
being produced, the amount of manu-
facturing has increased, and we are ex-
pecting significant improvements in 
the next couple of weeks. Yes, I wish 
they were here earlier, but can we fix 
the problem we face now and get them 
here soon, immediately? 
I sit in the desk of Senator Bob Dole, 
a predecessor of mine in Kansas—his 
name is etched in this desk drawer— 
now known for his bipartisanship and 
held in great respect not only at home 
in Kansas but across the country. I 
stand at the desk that is here in the 
place of Senator John McCain. These 
are two people who demonstrated the 
desire to work together. 
While I have outlined a few things 
that I think are important, and I want-
ed Kansans to know, the mission in my 
remarks today—maybe the most im-
portant—is to ask my Republican col-
leagues and my Democratic colleagues 
to set aside the usual bickering and po-
litical posturing that takes place in 
the U.S. Congress. No American can 
feel well, no American can feel that 
things are going to be OK if they don’t 
see leadership and cooperation among 
us. 
So while we today are preparing for 
the presentation of new legislation 
dealing with the challenges that busi-
nesses, employers, and employees face, 
trying to relieve the economic and fi-
nancial burden that many Americans

are experiencing and more will experi-
ence in the future, could Americans 
please see that I and my colleagues are 
taking every step not to make this a 
political exercise but to demonstrate 
our care and concern for those we rep-
resent. 
I mentioned a moment ago about vet-
erans. This is the point in time in 
which, if you take a walk on the Na-
tional Mall, as I have often done, to 
walk to the Lincoln Memorial, I will 
walk by now the World War II Memo-
rial; I will walk by the Vietnam Wall; 
and on my return, I will walk by the 
Korean War Memorial. We should hold 
those veterans—those military men 
and women who are honored in those 
settings—as our role models. We should 
do that every day, but could we please 
do it over the next few weeks, the next 
few months, and into the next year as 
we try to address the challenges that 
America faces today. No person memo-
rialized in those settings fought and 
sacrificed their life for a Republican or 
for a Democrat. They sacrificed be-
cause they believed they could make 
life better for the folks back home— 
their own family members, their neigh-
bors, and people they didn’t know. 
They sacrificed because they believed 
they could make the world a more safe 
and secure place. I pledge myself in 
every way possible to see that I do the 
things today, tomorrow, and into the 
future that mean that this Congress 
has come together on behalf of the 
American people, just like those who 
served our country did and now rest in 
peace. 
To the Democratic colleagues here in 
the Senate, please consider me open to 
their suggestions. And to my Repub-
lican colleagues, please know that I am 
an ally in the things that we believe in. 
But we may all need to give a little so 
America can return, Americans can be 
safe, Americans can be secure, our 
health is protected, and our economy 
flourishing. 
I 
would 
ask 
God 
in 
these 
cir-
cumstances to bless this country, to 
bring us together, hold us in his arms 
in a way that we can’t do today, and to 
make certain that this Congress rep-
resents the will of the people, not the 
will of any political party. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Tennessee. 
Mr. ALEXANDER. I ask unanimous 
consent to speak for as much time as I 
may require. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
f 
CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, 
I congratulate the Senator from Kan-
sas on his eloquent remarks, expressing 
the feelings—certainly mine and those, 
I believe, of virtually every Member of 
this body—that we are here not as 
Democrats or Republicans but to work 
together to do whatever we can to ad-
dress the concerns that are literally 
unprecedented. 
This is an unprecedented time in our 
country. I cannot remember a time in 
my life or in our history when the gov-
ernment has literally closed down the 
country in order to contain a disease. 
That is literally what we are doing. 
Whether it is the Federal Government 
by its travel restrictions, or whether it 
is the State governments suggesting 
that schools be closed, or whether it is 
mayors saying that restaurants must 
be closed, we are closing down the 
country to contain a disease. Because 
the government is doing that on behalf 
of all the people, we are going to have 
to pay the costs of closing down the 
country to contain this disease. 
Today, the news is that the auto in-
dustry across the country is closing 
down, at least temporarily. There are 
layoffs. 
I have watched over the last 40 years 
as Tennessee has gone from almost no 
auto jobs to proudly calling itself, in 
many ways, the No. 1 auto State. One 
hundred forty thousand Tennesseans 
work in auto jobs in Tennessee; that is 
one-third of all of our manufacturing 
jobs. They are spread through 88 coun-
ties. And over these 40 years as textiles 
and other industries moved away from 
the United States and out of our State, 
the auto companies moved in—vir-
tually into every county—and our fam-
ily incomes went up. So if we are, in 
many ways, the No. 1 auto State, then 
we are the No. 1 State to be hurt when 
the auto plants begin to close. 
We are also hurt, as are citizens in 
every State, when the restaurants shut 
down. Fifteen million Americans work 
in restaurants. It is one of our largest 
industries, if not our largest industry. 
Almost all of those workers are being 
laid off in Tennessee and in many other 
places in the country and even more 
will be. 
Not all of those affected are working 
for big auto companies or medium- 
sized restaurants. I received an email 
yesterday from friends in Tennessee 
who run a kennel. Well, you may say 
that is not so important. Well, it is im-
portant to a lot of us. They say: 
We are . . . suffering a massive drop off in 
our business as a result of the Coronavirus. I 
fear we may have to close our doors for a 
month or two (hopefully not that long), as 
our wonderful customers are forced to cur-
tail travel. I am currently trying to secure 
around $50,000 in loans to supplement our 
dwindling reserves to see us through until 
May [or] June. I am currently applying . . . 
for SBA disaster relief. This precipitous drop 
in business comes on the heels of major flood 
damages to our fencing [caused] by the [re-
cent] floods . . . our flood insurance refuses 
to cover [that]. We are not seeking charity, 
just a business loan from $30,000 [to] $50,000 
to secure our business until it passes. We al-
ways pay our way. 
This couple has two young children 
and maybe a couple of employees in 
their kennel. They are awfully good 
people. They are salt-of-the-earth Ten-
nesseans. They are like many Ameri-
cans who are suddenly confronted with 
this disease that just came out of the 
blue and has caused our government to 
shut our country down. 
Now, what shall we do about it? 
Well, a couple of weeks ago, Congress 
and the President reacted with $8.3 bil-
lion to help beef up our public health 
system. We have the best public health 
system in the world, and we wanted to 
help it get started. 
Today, we passed a bill that some 
people have estimated at $100 billion, 
which includes a whole variety of other 
steps from Democrats and Republicans 
that includes encouraging more test-
ing, that creates a new system of paid 
leave for businesses of less than 500 em-
ployees, and family leave. 
As Senator MCCONNELL said, we are 
going to stay here this week until we 
take step 3. And step 3, according to 
the President’s proposal, would include 
direct financial payments to Ameri-
cans; it would include support for es-
sential businesses that need stabiliza-
tion like the airlines; and it would in-
clude loans to small businesses so they 
can keep their employees working. 
Perhaps that proposal would be good 
for that small kennel I talked about. 
That is said to cost perhaps another 
trillion dollars. A trillion dollars is a 
lot of money, even in the United 
States. Our gross domestic product is 
about $22.3 trillion. We have 25 percent 
of all the money in the world in this 
country just for 5 percent of the people. 
But the idea that we would have to 
spend a trillion dollars or more to con-
tain a disease would be unthinkable a 
few weeks ago, but what we have 
learned very quickly is we are going to 
have to pay the cost of containing the 
disease because the way we are con-
taining it is that the government is 
shutting down major parts of our econ-
omy. I don’t believe that what we do 
today or what we propose to do later in 
the week will be enough because, as I 
look at the number of people being laid 
off in this country, our State unem-
ployment agencies are not going to be 
able to deal with that. 
In Tennessee, for example, where un-
employment has been very low and 
where people have found it easy to find 
a job, there were only 2,000 applications 
for unemployment insurance last week, 
but already this week by 2 p.m. on 
Wednesday, in the middle of the week, 
there were four times that many appli-
cations, 9,177. If you are successful in 
unemployment compensation in our 
State, you get $257 per week for 26 
weeks. 
So we are going to have to do even 
more than the Congress has done, even 
more than the President has done, and 
I think we have to recognize that the 
President was wise on January 31, 
when 
we 
only 
had 
six 
cases 
of 
coronavirus detected in the United 
States, to impose the strictest travel 
bans on people coming into our coun-
try in 50 years. Dr. Fauci, whom all of 
us respect, said if he hadn’t done that, 
we would have many more cases today. 
Still, we have a disease that is caus-
ing the governments—this one, the 
State government, the local govern-
ment—to shut major parts of our econ-
omy down. That is why I voted today

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1801 
March 18, 2020 
for the legislation that was phase 2 in 
our effort to respond to that, even 
though I have significant issues with 
the sick leave and family leave pro-
posals that are part of it. I believe 
those provisions, while well-intended 
by the administration and by the 
House of Representatives, will hurt 
many employers and will shortchange 
many employees. 
First, to be fair, I want to try to 
make sure that what the Treasury in-
tends to do is on the record. I have had 
several conversations with the Sec-
retary of the Treasury and with other 
officials to ask them just what they in-
tended to do and to list the problems 
that I had. So here is what they say— 
and I am characterizing the conversa-
tions and the writings we have had. 
They pointed out that what many 
businesses have read is in this bill was 
what was in the draft of it that the 
House passed on Friday before tech-
nical corrections were made over the 
weekend and that the technical correc-
tions greatly improved the bill from 
the point of view of employers. 
The 
Treasury 
Department 
writes 
that, under the legislation, employers 
receive a dollar-for-dollar refundable 
tax credit for the COVID–19-related 
sick and family leave payments made 
to their employees. As amended—they 
made the technical corrections over 
the weekend—the credit is carefully 
calibrated, in the Treasury’s words, to 
ensure that there is no sick or family 
leave requirement in excess of the 
credit. The legislation now also in-
cludes explicit grants of regulatory au-
thority to both the Secretary of Labor 
and the Secretary of the Treasury to 
ensure consistency between the leave 
requirements and the credit provisions. 
In addition—and this is what the 
Treasury officials have been saying to 
us over the last few days—the legisla-
tion now provides that the sick and 
family leave payments are not consid-
ered wages for employment tax pur-
poses. The legislation now extends the 
employer credit to include costs for the 
maintenance of health benefits that 
are paid by the employers while em-
ployees are on leave. 
Lastly, the Treasury and the Internal 
Revenue Service are considering op-
tions to provide an advance payment 
for the refundable credit to ease any 
tax flow burden that a small fraction of 
employers may experience. I will have 
more to say about that in a minute, 
but in plain English, what that means 
is that they are considering a way to 
make sure that, before the employer 
has to pay this required family leave to 
an employee, the Federal Government 
has given the money to the employer. 
Besides this, the legislation now in-
cludes an explicit grant of authority, 
the Treasury writes, to the Secretary 
of Labor to exempt small businesses 
from the only long-term leave require-
ments it contains where those require-
ments would result in financial hard-
ship. 
In its conversations with me and in 
the writings that it has sent out, the 
Treasury makes the argument that, far 
from imposing special burdens, the net 
effect of this legislation is to provide 
an important benefit given that many 
already provide sick leave and that 
many more will need to do so in re-
sponse to the COVID–19 outbreak. 
Moreover, by structuring coverage for 
paid sick leave as a credit, the legisla-
tion ensures that employers generally 
receive relief immediately rather than 
having to wait for refunds. 
In the event the amount of the credit 
exceeds an employer’s tax liability, the 
credit is made refundable to ensure 
that the employer is fully compensated 
for all payments made under the leave 
requirements. The Treasury goes on to 
write that the Treasury and the IRS 
are working on options to provide an 
advance payment of the credit in order 
to get cash in the pockets of small 
businesses and their employees imme-
diately. 
The intent of the legislation, the 
Treasury argues, is to fully fund the 
payments employers make to their em-
ployees who experience employment 
interruptions related to the COVID–19. 
In summary, according to the De-
partment of the Treasury, the amended 
legislation does not require employers 
to 
make 
payments 
in 
excess 
of 
amounts eligible for the refundable tax 
credit and does not require employers 
to pay employment taxes on those 
amounts. To the contrary, it provides 
an important and immediate benefit to 
small businesses and their employees 
for whom financial assistance is needed 
as quickly as possible. That has been 
the argument of the Secretary of the 
Treasury and his subordinates in con-
versations with many of us over the 
last few days. That is their intention. 
Now, I read that in detail because, in 
the Dakotas, in Tennessee, and in 
many places all across this country, if 
my figures are right, there are about 6 
million businesses that could be af-
fected by this mandate, businesses that 
employ 51 million employees—or at 
least that did employ 51 million em-
ployees until all of the problems that 
have been created by this virus. 
In my having tried to be fair in giv-
ing you what I understand the Treas-
ury’s intention to be, which I think 
will be useful to the owners of small 
businesses, to their accountants, and 
to their lawyers, who are trying to fig-
ure out the law that was passed today, 
here are my problems with it. 
No. 1, I am not sure that the Treas-
ury can live up to its promise to make 
sure that the employer has the money 
from the Federal Government before 
the employer has to pay the sick leave 
to the employee. 
Here is my principle. I think, in these 
circumstances, sick leave and family 
leave are a good idea. I mean, if some-
one is quarantined for 2 weeks, I think 
all of us should have to pay the cost of 
that and, for another 10 weeks, some of 
the cost of the medical and family 
leave. I buy that, and I can support 
that. Yet I believe, if Washington, DC, 
is going to require it, Washington, DC, 
should pay for it. If Washington, DC, is 
going to require a small business— 
many of which are struggling and 
many of which are going out of busi-
ness—to pay a mandate, Washington, 
DC, should pay for it. 
This is no time to be imposing on 
small businesses an expensive, new 
mandate—an unexpected new cost— 
when they don’t have money coming in 
to pay for the normal costs that they 
had. I know it is the Secretary’s goal 
to let it work this way, for he has told 
me this, and he has told all of us this. 
He has said it in public and has put out 
a statement. 
Under the sick leave proposal, every 
couple of weeks, a businessman will 
put aside enough money for with-
holding and social security taxes. That 
adds up to about 15 percent of an em-
ployee’s salary. What the Treasury is 
saying is that the employer can use 
that money. Instead of setting it aside 
for the government, the employer can 
use it to pay sick leave. 
There are two problems with that. 
One is that I don’t like the idea of the 
employer’s using the employee’s tax 
money. You usually get in trouble for 
that. If I were to set aside the Senator 
from North Dakota’s tax payment and 
then use it for some purpose, you could 
go to jail for that in some cases. At 
least it is inappropriate. I am uncom-
fortable with that. A business might 
only have 7.5 percent of the salary set 
aside for that purpose, but even if it is 
15 percent, I am not sure it is enough. 
The Treasury Secretary said the 
Treasury understands that, so it will 
allow advance payment, and it hopes 
that it can come up with a system that 
would get it there immediately. He 
hasn’t promised that it would come in 
1 day. I am sure, if he were here on the 
Senate floor, he would like to say his 
objective would be to get it there on 
the same day. Well, wanting to get it 
there on the same day and getting it 
there are two different things. 
If I am a small business person in 
Tennessee and know that I am going to 
have to cut a payroll check on Monday 
and that I have no money coming in to 
pay for it and that there is not enough 
money in my escrow account to pay for 
it, I would want my money from the 
Federal Government before I would cut 
the check. 
So I intend to try to amend the legis-
lation that we passed this weekend to 
say that, with sick leave and paid fam-
ily leave, since Washington is requiring 
it and Washington is paying for it, then 
Washington will need to make sure the 
employer has the money before the em-
ployer has to write the check. That is 
No. 1. 
No. 2, I want to make sure that the 
employer doesn’t have to pay more on 
sick leave than the Federal Govern-
ment’s cap. There is a cap that, I 
think, is about $132,000 annualized pay 
on sick leave. If an employee makes 
more than that, that employee is going 
to have to take a pay cut or he or she

March 18, 2020 
might use the private right of action to 
sue the employer and say: I want you 
to pay the gap between the $132,000 and 
whatever I made. 
You may say, I am not too sympa-
thetic to the employee who makes that 
much money. Yet I am not talking 
about being sympathetic to the em-
ployee; I am talking about being sym-
pathetic to the employer who may not 
have any money. Remember, this is a 
Washington mandate, and Washington 
should pay for it. Through technical 
changes this past weekend—and it said 
so in the information I just read—the 
Treasury Department has amended the 
bill to try to make that clear, and I 
hope that it is successful. 
No. 3 is with regard to layoffs, and I 
mentioned the restaurant industry. 
There are 15 million people who work 
in the restaurant industry. If they are 
not laid off now, they are going to be 
mostly all laid off before very long. Un-
fortunately, none of those men and 
women who have been laid off are eligi-
ble for this sick leave because you are 
going to have to work for 30 days for 
this small business, for this company 
with fewer than 500 employees, in order 
to be eligible for the paid sick leave. 
I am afraid, as a result of this, many 
employers who are worried about this 
provision may have an incentive to lay 
off more of their employees. The truth 
is that one doesn’t need much more in-
centive because you are a restaurant 
and have been told by the local health 
board to close down. You don’t have 
any money coming in, and you can’t 
pay your employees anyway, so you 
don’t have any choice. My point is that 
this is a very limited benefit in the res-
taurant industry and, probably, in 
many other industries because it does 
not help the laid-off employee. 
Finally, there has been a lot said 
with regard to the smallest compa-
nies—those with fewer than 50 employ-
ees—in that they can apply to the Sec-
retary of Labor and he will make you 
exempt from the mandate. I think that 
is a good idea because this is the small 
mom-and-pop diner or it might be the 
kennel that I just talked about that 
might have three or four employees 
and that is not accustomed to dealing 
with all of this Washington legalese 
and its requirements and regulations. 
It is not geared up for that. 
As I read the language in the law, it 
is a much narrower exception than 
that, so I am going to attempt to 
amend the law that passed today in 
order to broaden the exception so the 
Secretary of Labor has more authority 
to waive the mandate for businesses 
with fewer than 50 employees. 
As I said, there are a number of im-
portant benefits in the bill that we 
passed today, especially on testing. We 
have seen a great increase in the num-
ber of available tests over the last few 
weeks. The Governor of Tennessee said 
yesterday that we have sufficient test-
ing. Well, that is for today but maybe 
not for tomorrow or the next day. 
One of the greatest steps forward has 
been to finally allow commercial test-
ing to be used. I mean, why shouldn’t 
the Mayo Clinic or the Cleveland Clinic 
be able to go ahead and develop tests 
and move ahead with them? Now, they 
can. While we have done a great deal, 
there is a great deal more that we must 
do. 
I am convinced, even if we do as Sen-
ator MCCONNELL has said and pass our 
phase three legislation this weekend, 
which would include loans to small 
businesses, direct payments to individ-
uals, and stabilizing payments to air-
lines, for example, and maybe to other 
industries, that there is more to do. 
My guess is that the next step after 
that—phase four, let’s call it—will be 
to look to our State employment com-
pensation systems and make sure they 
are able to handle the large numbers of 
people who are losing their jobs be-
cause the government is shutting down 
the economy in order to contain the 
disease. 
I voted for the Johnson amendment 
today, which was to the bill for which 
I later voted, because I thought it was 
headed in the right direction. Rather 
than Washington’s issuing mandates, I 
would rather Washington work with 
the States in an existing program and 
make sure that States have sufficient 
funding on top of their own funds to 
deal with the large numbers of auto-
workers, 
restaurant 
workers, 
and 
workers at the small kennel that has 
two or three employees. In addition to 
that, I believe the figure in the weekly 
fund is going to have to be higher than 
the $327 that it is in Tennessee. 
This is unprecedented. We are closing 
down the economy in order to contain 
the disease. Because we are doing that, 
we governments at all levels are going 
to have to pay the bill. 
I yield the floor. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
CRAMER). The Senator from Delaware. 
f 
CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. COONS. Mr. President, the Sen-
ate of the United States has just acted. 
It has taken up and passed a roughly 
$104 billion package of assistance that 
will go out to American families, to 
American workers, to our healthcare 
system, to our States, and to our com-
munities. I want to take a few minutes 
to talk about this important step we 
have just taken and where we have to 
go next. 
The Delawareans I have heard from 
today and this week and this month 
are worried, and they are anxious. 
They have been up all night and are 
trying to figure out how they are going 
to care for their children who are home 
from school and need support and in-
struction and how they are going to 
care for their parents who are vulner-
able and elderly and sick. They are 
concerned about our hospitals and our 
healthcare system and its capacity. 
They are anxious because they are 
frontline workers, they are first re-
sponders, and they are volunteer fire-
fighters, nurses, and orderlies, who are 
exposed every day and concerned. They 
are just average citizens asking: How 
can I get a test and where? 
I have heard from the presidents of 
our major universities, the head of our 
hospital system, our Governor, and my 
colleagues in our congressional delega-
tion. We have talked repeatedly to our 
director of public health, our secretary 
of health and human services, and I 
have heard from business owners, large 
and small, who run everything from 
coffee shops and diners to restaurants 
and hotels in our State. There is a lot 
of anxiety and concern. 
The folks in my State want to know 
that we here in Washington are going 
to put the partisan bickering aside, 
find answers, and get resources out to 
deal with this significant public health 
emergency. 
And so I hope folks take some en-
couragement from today’s actions. It 
passed 90 to 8. Very little passes in this 
Senate 90 to 8, and I have very rarely 
seen a bill of this size, scope, and mag-
nitude that goes from an idea to bill 
text, to enactment in such a short pe-
riod of time, but this moment demands 
it. 
Let me talk through, also, the prior-
ities that are reflected in the Families 
First Coronavirus Response Act, be-
cause the name reflects the priorities. 
Hubert Humphrey, who is a former 
leader in the United States in our po-
litical community and system, once 
said, ‘‘The moral test of our govern-
ment is how it treats those who are in 
the dawn of life, the children; those 
who are in the twilight of life, the el-
derly; and those who are in the shad-
ows of life, the sick, the needy and the 
handicapped.’’ 
I am pleased that the package just 
passed here in the Senate takes impor-
tant strides to take care of exactly 
those 
folks. 
Children 
home 
from 
school, who need support for learning 
remotely, and those, in particular, who 
rely on school lunch programs for their 
one good, stable healthy meal a day, 
will be able to continue to get school 
lunches delivered, either through their 
schools or at home. There are signifi-
cant resources in this bill for that. 
Those who are on the frontlines of this 
crisis, the individuals who are cleaning 
offices and cleaning hospital rooms and 
cleaning Amtrak cars and public buses, 
those who are putting themselves di-
rectly at risk by cleaning the spaces we 
all count on for our society, frontline 
workers, people who are in our first re-
sponder community, people who are 
working in our hospital emergency 
rooms—this provides support for them. 
And for anyone who is concerned 
about the cost of access to testing, this 
bill makes clear that testing for 
COVID–19, for this dreaded disease 
caused by the novel coronavirus, will 
have a test for free, including those 
without health insurance. 
There are some big pieces in this bill 
that I will briefly mention. There is 
paid emergency leave for workers at 
companies below 500 employees for 2

S1803 
March 18, 2020 
weeks of sick leave and up to 10 weeks 
of additional paid family and medical 
leave. We just had a disagreement over 
exactly how that is going to get paid 
for and how it is going to get com-
pensated and on what timeline, and we 
are going to work out those details. 
My office’s website will have an ac-
cessible, readable summary of what is 
in this bill up later tonight. 
The larger point was that we thought 
it essential that folks who we want to 
stay home, but who are maybe living 
paycheck to paycheck, know that they 
will get paid sick leave so they can 
stay home and we can slow the spread 
of this disease. 
There is also an increase in funds 
from the Federal Government to States 
for Medicaid, because a lot of our 
States are going to see increased costs 
as folks move to Medicaid as the place 
they get healthcare as they move to 
unemployment. One hundred million 
dollars in additional resources will go 
to the State of Delaware alone to pro-
vide support for those who may be 
newly dependent on Medicaid. 
Then, last is an expansion of unem-
ployment benefits—26 weeks of unem-
ployment 
benefits, 
including 
tem-
porary unemployment caused because 
of COVID–19. 
There are more details as to how this 
temporary 
unemployment 
insurance 
will work, but it will last longer and 
have a higher level of benefit and be 
more flexible than previous versions of 
Federal unemployment insurance, and 
it is being delivered in partnership 
with States. 
So those are the biggest pieces of this 
bill. It is just $104 billion, but the bill 
we are already hard at work on will be 
an order of magnitude greater, likely 
more than $1 trillion. If what we have 
seen in terms of anxiety and concern 
from families up and down my State 
and all over our country is any indica-
tion, we must take this up quickly and 
enact it. 
There are small business owners, 
whom I have heard from today, who 
want to keep employing the folks who 
work for them but have lost half of 
their business since our Governor took 
the bold and necessary step of closing 
our restaurants and bars to all except 
drive-through and delivery service. Ten 
percent of the folks who work in Dela-
ware work in restaurants and hospi-
tality. Folks who want to keep their 
people on payroll but have no work for 
them to do face a very hard choice. 
We need to find ways that we can 
both defer the payments that are nec-
essary for students, for homeowners, 
for businesses, for those who have out-
standing payments on SBA loans or on 
federally guaranteed mortgages or on 
bank loans where we can work out 
some way to provide temporary relief, 
and then individual payments that will 
help students, that will help heads of 
households, and that will help individ-
uals. 
So there are a lot of different pieces 
that are being debated and discussed 
here in the Senate—support for Am-
trak, a priority for me because I com-
mute by Amtrak and it is one of the 
biggest modes of transportation on the 
east coast; support for the airline and 
hospitality industries because they em-
ploy hundreds of thousands of people 
and have seen their business drop off 
sharply; support for long-term struc-
tural changes to how we provide access 
to healthcare, access to skills and 
training for our workforce, and access 
to higher education. 
I have heard very concerning stories 
from the folks who lead some of the 
most important nonprofit and faith 
and educational institutions in my 
State, and they are looking to us for 
bold and decisive leadership. 
Last, we must not forget those on the 
margins of our society—people who are 
homeless, people who are incarcerated, 
people who are uninsured, people who 
are undocumented. If we want to make 
sure that we make our country safe, we 
need to practice not just good hygiene, 
not just social distancing, but we need 
to refrain from moral distancing. We 
need to remember the words of Hubert 
Humphrey, and we need to be reminded 
exactly why people look to this Federal 
Government for prompt action and for 
significant resources: It is because they 
look for us to be able to make sure 
that we see all Americans and that we 
know that we are all in this together. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to 
call the roll. 
Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
f 
CORONAVIRUS 
Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. President, I 
have so appreciated the comments of 
my colleagues today as they have come 
to the floor and they have talked about 
how they are approaching what is hap-
pening with this coronavirus pandemic 
and what they are hearing from the 
citizens of their States. 
I know each of us is spending our day 
listening to the people in our States 
and listening to their concerns and 
hearing them say: As you look at how 
you are going to address this, don’t for-
get about us. Don’t forget about us— 
whether it is independent contractors 
who are working in the music industry 
or television producers—I was talking 
to one last night; they lost $9,000 worth 
of 
production 
work 
this 
week—or 
theme park owners who are trying to 
figure out how they are going to work 
through this or the CEO of one of our 
Nation’s airlines earlier today. People 
are looking to us to make certain that 
we address this situation in a way that 
is going to stabilize it and that is going 
to provide assistance. 
As we have worked through this, one 
of the things I think sometimes is just 
a really good thing to do is to stop and 
kind of take stock of where we are and 
how it is going to be best to move for-
ward. 
I think it is important to realize that 
we have already directed resources to 
the coronavirus pandemic. There is the 
coronavirus supplemental, which was 
an $8.3 billion piece of legislation. That 
may seem like a lifetime ago to some 
of those in our States. It was a couple 
of weeks ago. That money is already 
making its way out. Tennessee re-
ceived $10 million this week in order to 
work on public health needs around the 
coronavirus. 
We also had our President move for-
ward without hesitation to do the na-
tional emergency declaration. That 
freed up $50 billion of resources. That is 
money that is going to our States and 
our localities to help with the response 
for this, to get those resources where 
they need to go. 
Of course, there was legislation that 
passed today, and in that, I supported 
the Johnson amendment. I do fully be-
lieve that working through this with 
our unemployment insurance and our 
employment security system is the 
way to go. I have supported the payroll 
tax holiday. I am one of those who 
have always said: Why should we have 
to pay the government to hire some-
body? So the payroll tax holiday made 
sense to me. The Johnson amendment 
that I cosponsored makes sense to me, 
that we could do it because we could 
more quickly get resources to individ-
uals, from the Federal Government to 
the taxpayer, to the individual. That is 
what we need to do at this time. 
Tennessee is very blessed. We have 
had a very low unemployment rate. 
But what we have seen in the last 2 or 
3 weeks is that unemployment claims 
have quadrupled, and we expect this is 
going to continue as workers, inde-
pendent contractors, sole proprietors, 
and small businesses see their income 
stream or their revenue stream go from 
something healthy to zero. That has 
happened literally overnight, just with-
in a few days as the economy started to 
shut down. 
What we hear from people is, look, 
this is not something we have done, it 
is something that has been done to us, 
and we are being asked to close our 
doors and to change the way we oper-
ate. So they repeatedly say: Don’t for-
get about us, and do not give us man-
dates we cannot afford, because what 
we need is assistance to bridge that 
gap. 
When we talk about mandates that 
you can’t afford, Tennesseans are very 
concerned about the paid family leave 
provisions that are in the legislation 
today. What I have heard repeatedly— 
repeatedly—whether it is someone who 
runs a nursing staffing company or a 
furniture store or a small manufac-
turing company, is that the tax credit 
provision is not going to work with 
cash flow. They mention that repeat-
edly. So my hope is that we can come 
together on a bipartisan basis and we

March 18, 2020 
can address the concerns that are there 
around that because we want our small 
businesses to keep those doors open 
and to return to health and vitality. 
We need to listen to what they are say-
ing, which is, help to stabilize, to assist 
us and to help us bridge this divide so 
that we can come back. 
We also need to be listening to our 
nonprofits that are saying the same 
thing about the family leave provisions 
and their concerns there. 
You know, we have to bear in mind 
that all of these employers really care 
for and value their employees. They 
want to do right by them. They want 
to do right by their communities. And 
certainly they want to do right by the 
country. But they need our listening 
ears, and they need our attention. 
Another thing that has come up that 
is of concern that was in the legisla-
tion that cleared the Chamber today is 
the Medicaid expansion provisions and 
the way it affects the non-expansion 
States. It adversely impacts States 
like Tennessee that were non-expan-
sion States. There are some defini-
tional changes that need to be made in 
that provision so that we are not ad-
versely impacting these States. 
For our Tennessee business owners 
and employers, this is a very tedious 
and emotional time. I talked with an 
employer last night who laid off 20 peo-
ple at a small business. They had to do 
it in order to keep the doors open. But 
what they all tell me is that they are 
really very grateful that the President, 
the Vice President, and the task force 
are focused on getting the virus under 
control, getting the response from our 
country under control, and making cer-
tain that we address the economic and 
financial impact of this. They know 
that it is going to be a long way back 
on this one, that there isn’t a quick fix. 
They realize that the way this all hap-
pened had to do with China and China 
knowing in December that they had a 
virus, that they had a problem. Know-
ing that China has lied to us; they kept 
hidden information; they have not been 
forthcoming; they did not make the 
viral sample available to us in a timely 
manner; and that lack of transparency 
is something that they point to and 
they say that we are all in this fight 
together, we want to make certain that 
China does not have the ability to take 
down our economy or take down our 
healthcare system. 
It is one of the reasons—two of the 
provisions that I have that will come 
before us are provisions that are fo-
cused on, one, bringing our production 
of pharmaceuticals back to the United 
States. Senator MENENDEZ has joined 
me in this provision, and it is the SAM- 
C bill—Securing America’s Medicine 
Cabinet, the SAM-C legislation. What 
this would do is incentivize returning 
pharmaceutical 
production 
to 
the 
United States, allowing our colleges 
and universities to access funds from a 
$100 million grant pool to partner up 
with pharmaceutical companies so that 
we never find ourselves in the position 
of not being able to get the active 
pharmaceutical ingredients—they are 
called APIs—those ingredients that are 
necessary 
to 
make 
vaccines 
and 
antivirals for viruses like the COVID– 
19. 
Right now, China is saying they may 
not let us have one of the products that 
we need. We commend our scientists 
and our companies and people like the 
Denison Lab at Vanderbilt University 
for the work they are doing to find 
that vaccine and to test that vaccine. 
We commend these labs for the work 
they are doing to find the right 
antivirals to help people fight this so 
that we are able to slow the growth, 
and we are able to cap the growth in 
this. 
Now, we know also that as we go 
through this, telehealth is vitally im-
portant. This is something that I have 
discussed. As you know, I have dis-
cussed it with our conference, I have 
discussed it with the White House, and 
with the President, and the Vice Presi-
dent, and I am grateful to see the 
changes that we have in telehealth 
that is making it more available. 
I was talking with a physician from 
another State—not Tennessee. I was 
talking with him yesterday, and he 
said: Well, our insurance company, 
which kind of is the only big insurance 
provider in this State, had decided they 
would allow telehealth through the end 
of the month. It is vitally important 
that we move these medically complex 
patients and the elderly—especially el-
derly who have comorbidities and have 
complex medical situations—to tele-
health. It is important that CMS pro-
vide specificity and clarity on how this 
is going to be paid for these Medicaid 
and Medicare enrollees. 
We commend CMS for moving for-
ward through the 1135 waiver system— 
that section of the code with Med-
icaid—for making some adjustments, 
but it is imperative that for these pri-
vate insurance companies, that we 
allow more specificity so we can utilize 
them. 
We have a situation. We know that 
this virus came out of Wuhan, China. 
We know they knew about it in Decem-
ber. We know that the rest of the world 
found out about it about 6 weeks later. 
We know it has caused a global pan-
demic. We know every life is precious, 
and we grieve the loss of those lives, 
the inconvenience, and also the loss of 
the ability of so many people to have 
their businesses and be able to run 
their businesses, and families who are 
not able to experience what they had 
planned for this year. 
So we know that we are going to be 
working ahead. We are going to stay 
here until we get much of this ad-
dressed and answer some of the ques-
tions that our constituents have. We do 
know we have done some work, but 
there is a lot more work to do, and we 
fully realize we can rise to this occa-
sion. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ma-
jority leader. 
PROGRAM 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, we 
continue to work on the next bill, 
which is generally referred to as phase 
3. This will be needed to respond to the 
crisis, and the Senate is going to stay 
around until we finish the bill and send 
it over to the House. 
I recommend Senators stay close. 
While we don’t know exactly how long 
it will take to get this done, everyone 
knows that we need to do it as quickly 
as possible because the situation de-
mands it. So we will keep Senators 
posted. I hope they don’t go too far 
away.

PETITIONS AND MEMORIALS 
The following petitions and memo-
rials were laid before the Senate and 
were referred or ordered to lie on the 
table as indicated: 
POM–191. A joint resolution adopted by the 
Legislature of the State of Maine respect-
fully urging and requesting the National 
Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration 
take the lives of the men and women of the 
Maine lobster industry into account in the 
agency’s decision making and understand 
that the agency’s proposed changes to the 
Atlantic Large Whale Take Reduction Plan 
will not save one right whale in Maine 
waters but will put many human lives in 
danger; to the Committee on Commerce, 
Science, and Transportation. 
SENATE PAPER 762 
We, your Memorialists, the Members of the 
One Hundred and Twenty-ninth Legislature 
of the State of Maine now assembled in the 
Second Regular Session, most respectfully 
present and petition the National Oceanic 
and Atmospheric Administration as follows: 
Whereas, the men and women who work in 
the Maine lobster industry are constantly at 
risk of injury and loss of life; and 
Whereas, the safety of these workers must 
be the primary concern of all government 
agencies that regulate the ocean; and 
Whereas, the Maine lobster industry has 
made many changes to help protect the right 
whale; and 
Whereas, no right whales have been killed 
by Maine lobster gear and deaths in 2019 
were predominantly by ship strikes in Cana-
dian waters or in one instance due to Cana-
dian fishing gear entanglements; and 
Whereas, the National Oceanic and Atmos-
pheric Administration has stated that right 
whales likely are not traveling in the waters 
in which Maine lobster fishing occurs; and 
Whereas, the proposal to modify the exist-
ing Atlantic Large Whale Take Reduction 
Plan developed by the National Oceanic and 
Atmospheric Administration will not save 
any right whales in Maine waters but will 
put the lives of workers in the Maine lobster 
industry at great risk; and 
Whereas, the lobster industry is one of 
Maine’s core traditional natural resource in-
dustries and has employed generations of 
Maine’s citizens; and 
Whereas, the lobster industry contributes 
$1.5 billion to Maine’s economy and entire 
communities depend upon the work that the 
lobster industry provides; Now, therefore, be 
it 
Resolved, That We, your Memorialists, re-
spectfully urge and request that the Na-
tional Oceanic and Atmospheric Administra-
tion take the lives of the men and women of 
the Maine lobster industry into account in 
the agency’s decision making and under-
stand that the agency’s proposed changes to 
the Atlantic Large Whale Take Reduction 
Plan will not save one right whale in Maine 
waters but will put many human lives in 
danger: and be it further 
Resolved, That suitable copies of this reso-
lution, duly authenticated by the Secretary 
of State, be transmitted to the Honorable 
Donald J. Trump, President of the United 
States, to the President of the United States 
Senate, to the Speaker of the United States 
House of Representatives, to Dr. Neil Jacobs, 
acting Under Secretary of Commerce for 
Oceans and Atmosphere, and to each Member 
of the Maine Congressional Delegation. 
POM–192. A petition from a citizen of the 
State of Texas relative to H.R. 5383 the ‘‘New 
Way Forward Act’’; to the Committee on the 
Judiciary.

S. RES. 546 
Whereas the designation of National Poi-
son Prevention Week was first authorized by 
Congress and President Kennedy in 1961 in 
Public Law 87–319 (75 Stat. 681); 
Whereas National Poison Prevention Week 
occurs during the third full week of March 
each year; 
Whereas the American Association of Poi-
son Control Centers (referred to in this pre-
amble as the ‘‘AAPCC’’) works with the 55 
poison control centers in the United States— 
(1) to track more than 1,000 commonly used 
household and workplace products; and 
(2) to track poisonings and the sources of 
those poisonings; 
Whereas 2,000,000 people call the poison 
help line annually to reach a poison control 
center; 
Whereas, as reported to the AAPCC, more 
than 90 percent of poison exposures reported 
to local poison control centers occur in the 
home; 
Whereas local poison control centers save 
the people of the United States $1,800,000,000 
in medical costs per year; 
Whereas the AAPCC and poison control 
centers partner with the Centers for Disease 
Control and Prevention, the Food and Drug 
Administration, and State and local health

ronmental, biological, and emerging threats 
in communities across the United States, in-
cluding 
food

March 18, 2020 
Whereas, in 2018— 
(1) more than 114,000 children 19 years of 
age and younger were treated in an emer-
gency room due to unintended pediatric poi-
soning; and 
(2) more than 90 percent of those incidents 
occurred in the home, most often with blood 
pressure medications, acetaminophen, laun-
dry packets, bleach, or sedatives or anti-anx-
iety medication; 
Whereas 70,237 cases of death due to drug 
overdose were reported in the United States 
in 2017, and the majority of those cases, ap-
proximately 68 percent, involved an opioid; 
Whereas the most common medications 
that adults call the poison help line about 
are 
analgesics, 
antipsychotics, 
antidepressants, and cardiovascular medica-
tions; 
Whereas pain medications— 
(1) lead the list of the most common sub-
stances implicated in adult poison exposures; 
and 
(2) are the single most frequent cause of 
pediatric fatalities reported to the AAPCC; 
Whereas poison control centers issue guid-
ance and provide support to individuals, in-
cluding individuals who experience medica-
tion and dosing errors; 
Whereas more than 60 percent of thera-
peutic errors involve individuals 20 years of 
age or older, with more than 1⁄2 of those in-
volving patients older than 50 years of age, 
and common errors include drug inter-
actions, incorrect dosing route, incorrect 
timing of doses, and double doses; 
Whereas normal, curious children younger 
than 6 years of age— 
(1) are in stages of growth and development 
in which they are constantly exploring and 
investigating the world around them; and 
(2) are often unable to read or recognize 
warning labels; 
Whereas the AAPCC— 
(1) engages in community outreach by edu-
cating the public on poison safety and poi-
soning prevention; and 
(2) provides educational resources, mate-
rials, and guidelines to educate the public on 
poisoning prevention; 
Whereas individuals can reach a poison 
control center from anywhere in the United 
States by calling the poison help line at 1- 
800-222-1222; 
Whereas, despite regulations of the Con-
sumer Product Safety Commission requiring 
that a child-resistant package be designed or 
constructed to be significantly difficult for 
children under 5 years of age to open, or ob-
tain a harmful amount of the contents, with-
in a reasonable time, children can still get 
into child-resistant packages; and 
Whereas, each year during National Poison 
Prevention Week, the Federal Government 
assesses the progress made by the Federal 
Government in saving lives and reaffirms the 
national commitment of the Federal Govern-
ment to preventing injuries and deaths from 
poisoning: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) recognizes the week of March 15

cate their communities and families about 
poison safety and poisoning prevention; and 
(B) health care providers to practice and 
promote poison safety and poisoning preven-

ER, Mr. BENNET, Ms. DUCKWORTH, Mr.

Mr. 
MENENDEZ, 
Mr. 
PETERS, Mr. CARPER, and Ms. SMITH) 
submitted the following resolution; 
which was referred to the Committee 
on Banking, Housing, and Urban Af-
fairs: 
S. RES. 547 
Whereas more than 3,800 people in the 
United States have already tested positive 
for the novel coronavirus across 49 States, 
the District of Columbia, and 3 territories, 
with experts believing the number is already 
much higher; 
Whereas the Centers for Disease Control 
and Prevention have projected that between 
160,000,000 and 214,000,000 people could be in-
fected by the novel coronavirus in the United 
States over the course of the pandemic; 
Whereas the United States health care sec-
tor is facing severe shortages of critical sup-
plies for coronavirus testing and treatment, 
including personal protective equipment for 
staff and infected patients, N95 respirators, 
sanitizing materials, ventilators, and test 
kit supplies; 
Whereas the Strategic National Stockpile 
contains only a fraction of the supplies that 
the Department of Health and Human Serv-
ices estimates will be necessary to respond 
to the coronavirus crisis, with the stockpile 
currently holding less than 0.3 percent of the 
amount of respirators estimated to be nec-
essary; 
Whereas the President has the existing au-
thority under the Defense Production Act of 
1950 (50 U.S.C. 4501 et seq.) to take immediate 
action to mobilize United States industry for 
emergency preparedness activities conducted 
pursuant to title VI of the Robert T. Stafford 
Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance 
Act (42 U.S.C. 5195 et seq.), which has been 
previously used to respond to public health 
hazards; and 
Whereas the President issued a national 
emergency declaration relating to the novel 
coronavirus under section 501(b) of the Rob-
ert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emer-
gency Assistance Act (42 U.S.C. 5191(b)) on 
March 13, 2020: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) calls on the President to use existing 
authorities under the Defense Production 
Act of 1950 (50 U.S.C. 4501 et seq.) to mas-
sively and quickly ramp up production in the 
United States of medical supplies, including 
personal protective equipment, needed to re-
spond to the ongoing public health emer-
gency driven by the spread of the novel 
coronavirus; 
(2) urges the President to prioritize the use 
of those authorities to produce and secure 
additional personal protective equipment, 
test kit supplies, respirators, ventilators, 
and sanitizing materials for use within the 
health care sector in the United States; 
(3) supports the use of authorities under 
title I of the Defense Production Act of 1950 
(50 U.S.C. 4511 et seq.) to allocate and control 
the distribution of medical materials needed 
for 
testing 
and 
treating 
the 
novel 
coronavirus, including by directing suppliers 
to prioritize and accept government con-
tracts to restock the Strategic National 
Stockpile where necessary; 
(4) supports the use of authorities under 
title III of the Defense Production Act of 1950 
(50 U.S.C. 4531 et seq.) to provide financial in-
centives to manufacturers and suppliers of 
critical medical equipment, including loans, 
loan guarantees, direct purchases, and pur-
chase commitments; and 
(5) supports the use of authorities under 
title VII of the Defense Production Act of 
1950 (50 U.S.C. 4551 et seq.) to establish vol-
untary agreements between the Federal Gov-
ernment and private industry that would 
allow for the temporary coordination of pro-
duction of necessary and scarce medical sup-
plies.

other purposes; as follows: 
Strike divisions C, E, and G. 
At the end of division D, add the following: 
SEC. ll. SENSE OF CONGRESS. 
It is the sense of Congress that— 
(1) it is the intention of Congress and the 
administration to provide immediate finan-
cial support to workers who will be idled and 
lose pay and benefits because of COVID-19; 
(2) Federally mandated sick pay and paid 
family leave will prompt some employers 
who cannot afford this mandate to preemp-
tively terminate the employment of workers 
they no longer have work for due to cir-
cumstances surrounding COVID-19; 
(3) even without that negative incentive, 
the COVID-19 will cause many Americans to 
lose their jobs, and not be eligible for Feder-
ally mandated sick pay or family and med-
ical leave, so the only income support will be 
unemployment insurance; and 
(4) it would be more efficient to administer 
this Federal financial support for workers 
using only one, rather than two or more pro-
grams. 
SEC. ll. TEMPORARY EMERGENCY FEDERAL 
CORONAVIRUS UNEMPLOYMENT IN-
SURANCE BENEFIT PROGRAM. 
(a) IN GENERAL.—In order to receive the 
credit against the Federal Unemployment 
Tax Act (26 U.S.C. 23), States shall provide

dividual who has worked for pay at any time

(3) The individual is experiencing symp-

nosis; 
(4) The individual is caring for an indi-
vidual who is subject to an order as described 
in paragraph (1) or has been advised as de-
scribed in paragraph (2); 
(5) The individual is caring for a son or 
daughter under the age of 18 years of such in-
dividual if the school or place of care of the 
son or daughter has been closed, or the child 
care provider of such son of daughter is un-
available, due to COVID-19 precautions. 
(6) The individual is subject to a temporary 
lay-off under section 604.5(a)(3) of title 20, 
Code of Federal Regulations, due to COVID- 
19.

quire any waiting period in order to receive 
benefits for those individuals described in 
subsection (a).

Federal 
coronavirus unemployment insurance bene-
fits under this section shall not be required 
to search for work. 
(f) FEDERAL REIMBURSEMENTS.—The Fed-
eral government shall— 
(1) reimburse States for the full cost of 
complying with the requirements under this 
section that are above and beyond the bene-
fits currently provided under each State’s 
current unemployment insurance law for 
benefits paid under this program; and 
(2) reimburse any employer who employs 
fewer than 500 employees and who volun-
tarily provides paid leave to an employee for 
the reasons described in subsection (a) an

used. 
(7) REINSTATEMENT.—If a covered indi-
vidual is separated from employment or 
work with an employer and is rehired or re-

public official with jurisdiction or a health 
care provider has determined, or the covered

a public health emergency, regardless of

cial with jurisdiction or a health care pro-
vider has determined that the presence in

of the person’s exposure to a communicable 
disease during a public health emergency, re-
gardless of whether the person has actually 
contracted the communicable disease. 
(6) An absence for the purpose of caring for 
a child, a parent, a spouse, a domestic part-

for diagnosis or care described in paragraph 
(1) or (2); 
(B) who is a child, if the covered individual 
is required to attend a school meeting or a

ployed by or working for an employer. 
(6) PERIODS.—A covered individual may 
take the additional sick time on the sched-
ule that meets the covered individual’s 
needs, consistent with subsection (b), includ-

single period or on any other schedule speci-
fied by the employer.

been used. 
(8) PROHIBITION.—An employer may not re-

described in subsection (b)(6), as appropriate, 
if the period of such time covers more than 
3 consecutive workdays. 
(ii) TIMELINESS.—The covered individual 
shall provide a copy of such certification to 
the employer in a timely manner, not later

commencement of the period of time on the 
basis that the employer has not yet received

quired under this title by an employer dur-
ing any public health emergency.

fits, or other compensation denied or lost by

ployment benefits, or other compensation

of wages or salary for the employee or indi-
vidual, or the specified period described in 
subsection (c)(2) or (d)(2) of section l302, or 
a combination of those hours and that pe-
riod, as the case may be; 
(II) the interest on the amount described in

propriate, including employment, reinstate-
ment, and promotion.

tion under this paragraph shall, in addition

ADMINISTRATIVE
ACTION.—The 
Sec-
retary shall receive, investigate, and at-
tempt to resolve complaints of violations of 
section l305 (including a violation relating 
to rights provided under section l302) in the 
same manner that the Secretary receives, in-
vestigates, and attempts to resolve com-
plaints of violations of sections 6 and 7 of the

206 and 207).

directly to each employee or individual af-
fected. Any such sums not paid to an em-

stituting the alleged violation for which the 
action is brought.

action brought for a willful violation of sec-
tion l305 (including a willful violation relat-
ing to rights provided under section l302),

the date of the last event constituting the 
alleged violation for which such action is

(e) REMEDIES FOR STATE EMPLOYEES.— 
(1) WAIVER
OF
SOVEREIGN

sistance for any program or activity of a 
State shall constitute a waiver of sovereign

ordered to lie on the table; as follows: 
At the appropriate place, insert the fol-
lowing: 
SEC. ll. COVERAGE FOR ALLERGY DIAGNOSTIC 
TESTING SERVICES UNDER MEDI-
CARE AND MEDICAID. 
(a) 
FINDINGS.—Congress 
finds 
the 
fol-
lowing: 
(1) Allergies, when not properly diagnosed, 
cannot be effectively treated. 
(2) Allergies to food, inhaled particles, or 
other sources can cause debilitating and, in 
some cases, fatal reactions. 
(3) Allergies can substantially compound 
other illnesses, including asthma, emphy-
sema, and adult obstructive pulmonary dis-
eases, leading to social and economic costs 
for families and our Nation’s health care sys-
tem. 
(4) According to clinical guidelines from 
the National Institutes of Health and rec-
ommendations 
from 
peer-reviewed 
lit-
erature, in vitro specific IgE tests and 
percutaneous tests are considered equivalent 
as confirmatory tests in terms of their sensi-
tivity and accuracy. 
(5) Despite these recommendations, some 
current Medicare local coverage determina-
tions and Medicaid coverage policies deny 
equal access to in vitro specific IgE tests and 
percutaneous tests. 
(6) 
In 
vitro 
specific 
IgE 
tests 
and 
percutaneous tests must be equally acces-
sible for clinicians and patients to improve 
health outcomes, reduce system costs, and 
reduce current health care disparities caused 
by the lack of equal coverage. 
(b) MEDICAID COVERAGE FOR ALLERGY DIAG-
NOSTIC TESTING SERVICES.— 
(1) IN
GENERAL.—Title XIX of the Social 
Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1396 et seq.) is 
amended— 
(A) in section 1902(a)— 
(i) in paragraph (85), by striking ‘‘and’’ at 
the end; 
(ii) in paragraph (86), by striking the pe-
riod at the end and inserting ‘‘; and’’; and 
(iii) by inserting after paragraph (86) the 
following new paragraph: 
‘‘(87) provide, with respect to the provision 
of allergy diagnostic testing services (as de-
fined in section 1905(gg)) under the State 
plan, for equality in the treatment of in 
vitro specific IgE tests and percutaneous 
tests with respect to— 
‘‘(A) any medical necessity or other cov-
erage requirements established for such in 
vitro specific IgE and percutaneous tests; 
‘‘(B) any frequency limits established for 
such tests; and 
‘‘(C) any allergen unit limits established 
for such tests.’’; and 
(B) in section 1905— 
(i) in subsection (r)— 
(I) by redesignating paragraph (5) as para-
graph (6); and 
(II) by inserting after paragraph (4) the fol-
lowing new paragraph: 
‘‘(5) Allergy diagnostic testing services (as 
defined in subsection (gg)).’’; and 
(ii) by adding at the end the following new 
subsection: 
‘‘(gg) ALLERGY DIAGNOSTIC TESTING SERV-
ICES DEFINED.—The term ‘allergy diagnostic 
testing services’ means in vitro specific IgE 
tests and percutaneous tests that— 
‘‘(1) have been cleared under section 501(k), 
classified under section 513(f)(2), or approved 
under section 515 of the Federal Food, Drug,

pose of evaluating immunologic response to 
certain antigens.’’.

(A) IN GENERAL.—Subject to subparagraph 
(B), the amendments made by this sub-
section shall apply with respect to items and 
services provided on or after January 1, 2021. 
(B) EXCEPTION FOR STATE LEGISLATION.—In 
the case of a State plan under title XIX of 
the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1396 et 
seq.) that the Secretary of Health and 
Human Services determines requires State 
legislation in order for the respective plan to 
meet any requirement imposed by amend-
ments made by this subsection, the respec-
tive plan shall not be regarded as failing to 
comply with the requirements of such title 
solely on the basis of its failure to meet such 
an additional requirement before the first 
day of the first calendar quarter beginning 
after the close of the first regular session of 
the State legislature that begins after the 
date of the enactment of this subsection. For 
purposes of the previous sentence, in the 
case of a State that has a 2-year legislative 
session, each year of the session shall be con-
sidered to be a separate regular session of 
the State legislature. 
(c) MEDICARE COVERAGE FOR ALLERGY DIAG-
NOSTIC TESTING SERVICES.— 
(1) COVERAGE.—Section 1861 of the Social 
Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1395x) is amended—

at the end; 
(ii) in subparagraph (HH), by striking the 
period at the end and inserting ‘‘; and’’; and

the purpose of evaluating immunologic re-
sponse to certain antigens, as determined ap-
propriate by the practitioner ordering such 
test. 
‘‘(2) EQUAL ACCESS TO TESTING METHODS.—

erage requirements established for such in 
vitro specific IgE and percutaneous tests;

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks
E323 
March 18, 2020 
SENATE COMMITTEE MEETINGS 
Title IV of Senate Resolution 4, 
agreed to by the Senate of February 4, 
1977, calls for establishment of a sys-
tem for a computerized schedule of all 
meetings and hearings of Senate com-
mittees, subcommittees, joint commit-
tees, and committees of conference. 
This title requires all such committees 
to notify the Office of the Senate Daily 
Digest—designated by the Rules Com-
mittee—of the time, place and purpose 
of the meetings, when scheduled and 
any cancellations or changes in the 
meetings as they occur. 
As an additional procedure along 
with the computerization of this infor-
mation, the Office of the Senate Daily 
Digest will prepare this information for 
printing in the Extensions of Remarks 
section of the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD 
on Monday and Wednesday of each 
week. 
Meetings scheduled for Thursday, 
March 19, 2020 may be found in the
