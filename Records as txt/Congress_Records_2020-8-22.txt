PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Will the 
gentleman 
from 
Pennsylvania 
(Mr. 
THOMPSON) come forward and lead the 
House in the Pledge of Allegiance. 
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania led

I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the 
United States of America, and to the Repub-
lic for which it stands, one nation under God, 
indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.

UNITED STATES POSTAL SERVICE 
(Ms. PLASKETT asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.) 
Ms. PLASKETT. Madam Speaker, 
first, I thank the Postal workers across 
this Nation who work so tirelessly to 
ensure we receive our mail in a timely 
fashion and are now doing it under tre-
mendous difficulty. Almost every busi-
ness, from the largest corporation to 
the smallest hometown operation, re-
lies on the Postal Service. 
But for those businesses, those fami-
lies—medicine, food, and goods are in 
jeopardy, not from a foreign adversary 
and not from war, but from attack 
within our borders, from those in 
charge, from the Postmaster General. 
Why? 
What is the primary purpose? 
It is to subvert an election. 
Today and Monday we will combat 
that attack. We will give the funding 
and the procedures necessary to restore 
and support the U.S. Post Office. 
We have also responded to the unani-
mous request of the Trump-appointed 
Postal Board of Governors for $25 bil-
lion in much-needed emergency oper-
ational relief. 
For over 200 years, neither snow nor 
rain nor heat nor gloom of night has 
stayed these couriers from the swift 
completion of their appointed rounds. 
Let it not be on our watch that this 
legacy ends. 
f 
THE BLUFFS RESTAURANT 
(Ms. FOXX of North Carolina asked 
and was given permission to address 
the House for 1 minute.) 
Ms. FOXX of North Carolina. Madam 
Speaker, 10 years ago, the Bluffs Res-
taurant, a wonderfully historic estab-
lishment on the Blue Ridge Parkway in 
the Fifth District, closed its doors. 
Today it is reopening thanks to over 
500 donors who contributed more than 
$1 million for repairs. 
In 1949 the Bluffs was the first res-
taurant to open on the Blue Ridge 
Parkway, and it served customers for 
more than 61 years. Generations of 
families have passed through its doors, 
and they have returned time and again. 
For them it is not just about the food, 
it is also about the countless memories 
that have been made there. 
My plan was to attend the reopening 
event today. Unfortunately, I could

f 
PROTECTING THE UNITED STATES 
POSTAL SERVICE 
(Mr. HIGGINS of New York asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute.) 
Mr. HIGGINS of New York. Madam 
Speaker, for 228 years the United 
States Postal Service has delivered for 
the American people. It is an institu-
tion built on trust, trust that the 
United States military veterans will 
receive their prescriptions each and 
every month, trust that Social Secu-
rity recipients will receive their checks 
each and every month, and trust that 
small businesses can manage and grow 
with the assistance of the United 
States Postal Service. 
Today, the trust and confidence of 
the United States Postal Service is 
under attack by the very administra-
tion 
and 
Postmaster 
General 
who 
should be protecting the time-honored 
tradition of that institution. 
Yesterday we stood outside the mail 
processing facility in Buffalo where 
five sorting machines were removed 
without explanation. 
This House will approve today the 
Delivering for America Act, an act to 
protect the United States Postal Serv-
ice from the destructive acts of the 
President and his postmaster disaster. 
f 
PAYING TRIBUTE TO GSGT DIEGO 
PONGO 
(Mr. GARCIA of California asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute.) 
Mr. GARCIA of California. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to 
a fallen warrior and a true American 
hero from the beautiful 25th District of 
California. Gunnery Sergeant Diego 
Pongo of Simi Valley was killed in ac-
tion by enemy fire in the Makhmur 
Mountains of Iraq back on March 8 of 
this year. Diego was a marine and part 
of the elite MARSOC Raiders unit 
charged with eliminating entrenched 
bastions of ISIS in Iraq.  
Because of delays as a result of the 
COVID pandemic, Gunnery Sergeant 
Pongo’s funeral and formal ceremony 
were held just 2 days ago at the hal-
lowed ground of Arlington National 
Cemetery. 
I had the unfortunate honor to at-
tend services along with his family. My 
thoughts and prayers are with Diego 
and his family, his parents, Kathryn 
and Carlos; his brothers, Andres and 
Jorge; his ex-wife, Randi; and most of 
all his beautiful 8-year-old daughter, 
Avery. 
Madam Speaker, we lost a true 
American patriot and a hero, and we, 
as a nation, are eternally indebted to 
him and his family. May we never for-
get. 
SUPPORTING THE UNITED STATES 
POSTAL SERVICE 
(Mrs. DINGELL asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mrs. 
DINGELL. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
through the Civil War, the Spanish flu, 
the Great Depression, and two world 
wars, the United States Postal Service 
has not stopped. No matter the condi-
tions—snow, rain, heat, or darkness— 
the dedicated men and women of the 
Postal Service have carried out their 
mission with pride. The Postal Service 
is one of the great pillars of our democ-
racy. It is enshrined in the Constitu-
tion, and it is an essential service for 
so many. 
The actions by the Postmaster Gen-
eral in recent weeks is a sabotage cam-
paign aimed at manipulating the mail 
service, but whatever the intent, it is 
hurting everyday Americans—seniors, 
veterans, and working men and women. 
In Michigan we have been told that 
just this month 10 mail sorting ma-
chines have been removed and de-
stroyed. This American institution is 
being deliberately dismantled. It is not 
only an attack on the Postal Service, 
it is an attack on our Constitution, our 
way of life, and, yes, our democracy. 
My message is simple: protect the 
Postal Service and our Republic.

PRESIDENT TRUMP PROMOTES 
UAE-ISRAELI PEACE TREATY 
(Mr. WILSON of South Carolina 
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend his remarks.) 
Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. 
Madam Speaker, this week’s announce-
ment of a U.S.-promoted peace treaty 
between the United Arab Emirates and 
Israel is an achievement of historic 
proportions. It is the clear result of 
President Donald Trump’s bold foreign 
policy agenda with Jared Kushner cre-
ating peace through strength. This is a 
major step towards a more stable, 
peaceful, and prosperous Middle East in 
which all people and religions can co-
exist and prosper. 
Credit is due to President Trump, 
Israeli 
Prime 
Minister 
Benjamin 
Netanyahu, and Crown Prince of Abu 
Dhabi 
Mohammed 
bin 
Zayed 
Al 
Nahyan for their commitment to peace 
and prosperity. 
The Washington Examiner editorial 
titled, ‘‘Team Trump Deserves Con-
gratulations 
on 
UAE-Israel 
Peace 
Deal’’ is right. This agreement is a sub-
stantive and significant victory for 
Israelis, Emiratis, and the Trump ad-
ministration. 
UAE is ably represented in Wash-
ington by Yousef Al Otaiba working 
with Ambassador David Friedman in 
Jerusalem. 
In conclusion, God bless our troops, 
and we will never forget September the 
11th in the global war on terrorism. 
DEGRADING THE UNITED STATES 
POSTAL SERVICE 
(Mr. CICILLINE asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. CICILLINE. Madam Speaker, I 
thank 
the 
extraordinary 
men 
and 
women who serve us in the United 
States Postal Service. 
I rise today to highlight President 
Trump’s shameless attempts to de-
grade the United States Postal Service, 
a revered American institution. These 
actions not only undermine our elec-
tions, they are gambling with people’s 
lives. 
These past several weeks I have re-
ceived thousands of emails, calls, and 
letters from constituents pleading that 
these changes be reversed. Just this 
week I heard from a constituent with 
diabetes who feared her family was at 
risk of losing their insurance after 
learning her payment had arrived 1 
month late after it was mailed. Her 
story is, sadly one of many being heard 
across the Nation. 
COVID–19 has already brought on sig-
nificant financial trouble for so many 
families. To further hurt working fami-
lies now facing late fees on rent or car 
payments through no fault of their own 
is unconscionable. 
House Democrats have promised to 
get government working for the people, 
and today’s bill is another example of 
that commitment. 
Everybody loves the Post Office. It 
has been with us since the founding of 
our country, knitting together commu-
nities, and this attempt to undermine 
and degrade services is not only under-
mining services to our constituents, it 
is threatening our democracy. 
f 
A POLITICAL CONSPIRACY 
THEORY 
(Mr. PENCE asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. PENCE. Madam Speaker, NANCY 
PELOSI is dragging the entire House of 
Representatives back here to Wash-
ington, D.C., on taxpayer dollars for an 
unnecessary political vote. 
Speaker PELOSI is choosing to vote 
on a political conspiracy theory re-
garding the United States Postal Serv-
ice. Instead, the House should be work-
ing on commonsense COVID–19 legisla-
tion to address liability protections for 
States, counties, cities, schools, non-
profits, and businesses that are trying 
to reopen. 
This bill is nothing more than an at-
tempt to utilize the courts to shut 
down the 2020 election. 
We need to stop wasting time on a 
sham political vote like H.R. 8015, be-
cause, in reality, House Democrats are 
the ones trying to scare the American 
people, blame President Trump, and, 
yes, undermine the 2020 election re-
sults. 
In these days and weeks before the 
election, Democrats are clearly des-
perate.

HONORING SALVATORE ‘‘SAL’’ 
ROTELLA 
(Mr. TAKANO asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. TAKANO. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor a visionary who be-
lieved in education for the masses, 
Salvatore ‘‘Sal’’ Rotella. He dedicated 
his life to a uniquely American form of 
education—America’s community col-
leges. 
He led the Riverside Community Col-
lege District from 1991 to 2007 while I 
was a trustee. 
Sal oversaw the expansion of RCCD 
into a system of three separately ac-
credited colleges while facing severe 
fiscal constraints. 
He healed a divided faculty and con-
tinually challenged the board of trust-
ees to do the right thing. 
One of Sal’s signature achievements 
was Passport to College which helped 
students believe that college was an at-
tainable dream for them. 
But Sal was more than just a leader. 
He was an exceptional family man and 
a mentor to me and so many others. He 
had a way of getting people to take 
their lives seriously, as if they really 
mattered. 
Now that he is gone, I take comfort 
in knowing that his life’s example will 
live on through others who have 
learned from him.

VITAMIN D SUPPLEMENTATION 
FOR COVID–19 
(Mr. GROTHMAN asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
his remarks.) 
Mr. GROTHMAN. Madam Speaker, at 
this time when the coronavirus is 
going on, I realize a lot of energy is ex-
pended as we work toward a possible 
vaccine, but I would like the Centers 
for Disease Control to bring up two 
other topics which may be helpful, 
though not quite as expensive. 
One is three universities—Trinity in 
Dublin, Harvard, and Northwestern 
University—have shown that Vitamin 
D can do a lot toward lessening the 
damage of COVID. 
Madam Speaker, 40 percent of Ameri-
cans suffer from a lack of vitamin D, 
and you can get enough vitamin D—in 
addition to going outside, if you are 
not staying inside too much—you can 
get it at your local drugstore. 
I wish the Centers for Disease Con-
trol would spend more time publicizing 
this, as 40 percent of Americans are 
short of vitamin D. 
I also wish they would spend more 
time dealing with fenofibrate, which in 
Israel they are looking at. Perhaps this 
common anticholesterol can also save 
a lot of lives as we await the vaccine. 
f 
RECOGNIZING PRISCILLA ACERO 
(Mr. CORREA asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. CORREA. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize Priscilla Arceo. 
Santa Ana High School’s valedic-
torian, Priscilla Arceo, made us proud 
when she appeared and earned the spot 
of student speaker at the national 
Graduate Together: America Honors 
the High School Student Class of 2020. 
I also thank our Santa Ana High 
School principal, Jeff Bishop, for his 
support. And, of course, I thank the de-
bate coach and teacher, Sal Tinajero, 
for bringing the debate program to 
Santa Ana High School. Mr. Tinajero 
continues to make champions out of 
these great kids at Santa Ana. 
Madam Speaker, today, Priscilla is 
headed to the University of California 
for her college degree, and I extend 
congratulations to Priscilla.

CONGRATULATING GEORGIA 
ABBEY 
(Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania 
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend his remarks.) 
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today to recog-
nize and congratulate Georgia Abbey 
on her recent retirement as executive 
director of Leadership Centre County. 
Leadership Centre County was found-
ed in 1991 and is dedicated to the devel-
opment of qualified leaders within the 
Centre County community. Over the 
years, more than 1,000 members have 
graduated from the program who then 
went on to be committee chairs, board 
members, and volunteers in Centre 
County organizations. I am proud to be 
one of those Leadership Centre County 
graduates. 
LCC has eight different values that 
all members strive to illustrate. These 
values include gratitude, mutual re-
spect, and inclusion. The organization 
believes that effective leaders improve 
the quality of life for their commu-
nities. 
For the past 21 years, Georgia Abbey 
has played a major role in achieving 
the goals of Leadership Centre County. 
Her result-oriented and high-energy 
management of LCC has contributed 
greatly to the tremendous success of 
this organization. 
Madam Speaker, I wish Georgia and 
her husband, Kevin, all the best in the 
next phase of life following retirement. 
f 
COVID–19 WORSENING CHILD 
HUNGER AND MALNUTRITION 
(Mr. MCGOVERN asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
his remarks.) 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, 
COVID–19 is having a devastating im-
pact on global hunger and food secu-
rity, especially among children. 
Even before the pandemic, malnutri-
tion and hunger rates were alarmingly 
high. Globally, 144 million children suf-
fer from stunting; wasting affects 47 
million children; and hunger has risen 
by 60 million people since 2014. The 
pandemic could push over 130 million 
people into hunger by the end of 2020. 
In July, The Lancet estimated that 
without timely action, the global prev-
alence of child wasting could rise by a 
shocking 14 percent, affecting nearly 7 
million more children and causing 
more 
than 
10,000 
additional 
child 
deaths every month. 
Madam Speaker, with such unprece-
dented need, Congress must act. We 
must help fund the global response to 
this COVID–19 pandemic. We must di-
vert this potential hunger and mal-
nutrition crisis. The children of the 
world, just like our own children, need 
us. 
f 
LACKING PREPAREDNESS FOR 
CALIFORNIA WILDFIRES 
(Mr. LAMALFA asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. LAMALFA. Madam Speaker, it is 
that time of year again in California. 
Hundreds of thousands of acres are on 
fire—in our forests, in our open lands, 
even burning into some of our cities 
and our neighborhoods. 
So, what is the deal? Once again, we 
are not prepared. Some of our Federal 
agencies were not prepared to have the 
equipment and the firefighters on 
hand, contracted, ready to go when we 
knew this was coming. 
As well, our people who procure elec-
tricity and govern that were not ready 
for the rolling blackouts that would 
come along from the high heat waves, 
as well as some of the shutdowns that 
would have to occur in burning areas. 
What is wrong with government 
agencies that do not plan to serve their 
people, to keep them safe from fire, 
and to help keep the electricity on? 
What is wrong that they can’t add up 
how many power plants that we have 
available online, how much hydropower 
we have, how much water behind the 
dams, how much we have available dur-
ing these times of heat waves to help 
keep the lights on? 
What is wrong with Federal agencies 
that cannot plan to have people, even 
during COVID, ready to go. 
Madam Speaker, we have to do better 
because we are disserving our people.

August 22, 2020 
United States Postal Service is under 
attack by the current administration. 
This is an assault on our democracy 
and our economy, and it is hurting 
Americans across the country. It is 
hurting the veteran in my district from 
Pasadena, Texas, who receives his 
medications from the VA through the 
mail and who is now worried about 
what will happen to him if his medica-
tions get delayed. 
It is hurting my neighbor from 
Lindale Park who cares for her elderly 
mother and didn’t receive her Social 
Security check in the mail on time, 
further stressing her financial situa-
tion and leaving her unable to pay her 
mother’s utilities. 
And it is hurting the small busi-
nesses in my neighborhood in the Hous-
ton region, already crippled by this 
pandemic, that depend on the Postal 
Service to mail out payments and prod-
ucts. 
Madam Speaker, we cannot stand by 
as people are hurting. The Postal Serv-
ice delivers money, medicines, mer-
chandise, and, yes, mail-in ballots. 
Madam Speaker, we must keep the 
Postal Service running. People are 
hurting.

HONORING WORK OF OFFICER 
BROOKS YANDLE 
(Mr. BISHOP of North Carolina asked 
and was given permission to address 
the House for 1 minute and to revise

Mr. 
BISHOP 
of 
North 
Carolina. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor 
the life-saving work of Officer Brooks 
Yandle of the White Lake Police De-
partment. 
Over the weekend of July 4, Officer 
Yandle responded to a call about a 43- 
year-old woman unresponsive to CPR. 
Upon arriving, Officer Yandle deter-
mined that the victim had overdosed 
on heroin, took quick action to resusci-
tate her, and saved her life. 
This is not the first time Officer 
Yandle has acted to save lives. In 2016, 
he saved a grandmother and her four 
grandchildren found unconscious and 
suffering from carbon monoxide poi-
soning. 
Officer Yandle’s courage and deci-
siveness has saved multiple lives, and 
he is a credit to the noble profession of 
law enforcement. I am proud to pay 
tribute today to him and to the entire 
White Lake Police Department.

CALLING FOR EQUALITY AND 
JUSTICE FOR ALL 
(Ms. JACKSON LEE asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
her remarks.) 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, 
this morning, today, we have arrived in 
Washington to fight for postal workers, 
the United States Postal Service, in 
H.R. 8015. But I take this moment to 
acknowledge close to almost 175,000 
dead Americans who have died from 
COVID–19. I applaud those who have 
taken a moment out of their lives to 
march for those who have passed and 
mourn for those families. 
This is not America. And I acknowl-
edge something else that comes to my 
attention that hurts my heart as a 
mother, and that is the Trump admin-
istration’s policy to separate children. 
That the United Nations has con-
demned it as torture and abuse of chil-
dren—some upwards of 5,000 children. 
Their own White House immigration 
specialists, if you will, want it to be 
25,000 children. This is not America. 
Today, we fight for those who have 
come to our doors in rain, snow, or 
shine. We must also fight for the chil-
dren and never again in America see 
any policy that snatches children away 
from their families. Immigrant or non-
immigrant, we are Americans who have 
values that stand for something— 
equality and justice. 
f 
CONTROLLING INVASIVE ASIAN 
CARP 
(Mr. BURCHETT asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. BURCHETT. Madam Speaker, 
the United States Congress needs to 
get back to work. We need to start 
working on the issues that deal with 
our constituents. 
One of those that is of great concern 
in Tennessee is invasive Asian carp. 
They are a nuisance in too many of our 
Nation’s waterways, preventing folks 
from fully enjoying our Nation’s lakes, 
rivers, and streams, and destroying our 
ecosystem. 
Many in my district, including the 
residents of Tellico Village, have ex-
pressed legitimate concerns to folks at 
TVA and others over Asian carp and 
their potential spread into our local 
waters, and I have been proud to work 
with them to tackle this issue. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
to 
control 
the 
spread of these pests, I have worked to 
secure $25 million in funding in fiscal 
year 2021. If approved by the Senate, 
these resources, combined with lan-
guage in the Water Resources Develop-
ment Act, would allow researchers to 
study the reproductive habits of Asian 
carp in the Tennessee and Cumberland 
River basins so we are better equipped 
to battle these invaders. 
I thank both the Committees on Ap-
propriations and Transportation and 
Infrastructure for working with my of-
fice on these requests. Problematic 
Asian carp harass boaters, fishermen, 
and swimmers across this country of 
ours. My constituents are passionate 
about getting the Asian carp popu-
lation under control and keeping them 
out of our waters. 
Madam Speaker, I look forward to 
working with them further on this im-
portant local issue. 
RECOGNIZING 
JOSEPH 
FABRIZIO 
AND 
HOLLAND 
MIDDLE 
SCHOOL’S EIGHTH GRADE STU-
DENTS 
(Mr. FITZPATRICK asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
his remarks.) 
Mr. FITZPATRICK. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to recognize the hard work 
and dedication of Mr. Joe Fabrizio and 
his eighth grade students at Holland 
Middle School in Bucks County, Penn-
sylvania. 
Each year, Mr. Fabrizio and his stu-
dents write letters to our office on a 
variety of topics, and each year, read-
ing these letters is something that our 
entire staff looks very much forward 
to. 
Madam Speaker, one of the most im-
portant things that one can do as a cit-
izen is to communicate with your 
elected officials by writing a letter, 
sending an email, making a call, or 
paying a visit. These students are play-
ing their part in the political process, 
and these students at Holland Middle 
School know that the decisions that 
our government makes today will im-
pact them, and eventually, it will be 
their turn to make decisions in their 
government. 
I think my colleagues in the House 
would very much benefit from being 
able to review these letters, and so I 
will include the letters in the CONGRES-
SIONAL RECORD. 
Madam Speaker, by taking the time 
to write our elected officials regarding 
issues important to them, it shows that 
these students truly care about our dis-
trict and our Nation, and it should give 
all of us faith in the future of our Na-
tion.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from Massachusetts is recog-
nized for 1 hour. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, for 
the purpose of debate only, I yield the 
customary 30 minutes to the gen-
tleman from Georgia (Mr. WOODALL), 
pending which I yield myself such time 
as I may consume. During consider-
ation of this resolution, all time yield-
ed is for the purpose of debate only. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I 
ask unanimous consent that all Mem-
bers be given 5 legislative days to re-
vise and extend their remarks. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Massachusetts? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, on 
Friday, the Rules Committee met and 
reported a rule, House Resolution 1092, 
providing for consideration of H.R. 
8015, the Delivering for America Act, 
under a closed rule. 
The rule itself executes a manager’s 
amendment from Chairwoman MALO-
NEY, provides 2 hours of general debate 
on the bill, equally divided and con-
trolled by the chair and ranking minor-
ity member of the Committee on Over-
sight and Reform, and provides one mo-
tion to recommit, with or without in-
structions. 
Madam Speaker, we are here today 
because our democracy is being eroded 
by this administration. It is under 
siege on all fronts. 
I read the report released this week 
by the Senate Intelligence Committee, 
a Republican-led committee. It was 
truly shocking. It found that some in 
the President’s campaign created ‘‘no-
table counterintelligence vulnerabili-
ties.’’ 
Make no mistake, they welcomed 
help from Russia, and they knowingly 
used intelligence from Putin’s regime. 
While this report was released, the 
President continued to attack his po-
litical enemies. He continued all of the 
lies. This week, he even floated the 
idea that America should hold a do- 
over of the upcoming election in No-
vember if he doesn’t like the outcome. 
Are you kidding me? 
On top of this, this administration 
has moved to dismantle the United 
States Postal Service. We have all seen 
the images of mailboxes uprooted. Oth-
ers have been chained shut. Sorting 
machines have disappeared. Mail serv-
ice has slowed to a crawl for some 
Americans, threatening the delivery of 
everything from medications to Social 
Security checks. 
Did you know, Madam Speaker, that 
80 percent of our veterans’ prescription 
medications are delivered by mail? 
Why would anyone want to place their 
health in harm’s way? 
Why, Madam Speaker? Because this 
administration knows that more Amer-
icans than ever are likely to vote by 
mail in November. The U.S. Postal 
Service expects 10 times the normal 
amount of election mail because of the 
coronavirus pandemic. This President 
fears that if more people vote, the less 
likely he is to win a second term. 
Now, we all recently mourned the 
passing of our dear friend, the great 
John Lewis. Not too long ago, he stood 
right here on this floor and he said: 
‘‘When you see something that is not 
right, not fair, not just, you have to 
speak up; you have to say something; 
you have to do something.’’ 
Madam Speaker, what we are seeing 
today cannot be dismissed as Donald 
being Donald or the President just con-
tinuing to be provocative. This is scary 
stuff. It is frightening, and we have to 
do something. 
In the face of extraordinary public 
pressure and action by this majority, 
the Postmaster General promised to 
halt further changes until after elec-
tion day. But I have to tell you, I 
wouldn’t trust this administration to 
tell me the correct time. Not only was 
there nothing in his statement about 
reversing the damage that has been al-
ready done, there was nothing about 
reinstalling boxes or sorting machines 
and nothing about treating election 
material as first-class mail. 
But the Postmaster General made 
clear, since, that he has no intention of 
undoing what he has done. He doesn’t 
plan on lifting a finger. He said as 
much in the Senate hearing yesterday. 
He made clear that he didn’t even 
study the impact of these changes on 
our seniors before they were imple-
mented. He didn’t study the impact on 
our veterans first. Apparently, he just 
made them, Madam Speaker, strug-
gling Americans be damned. 
This administration isn’t going to do 
a single thing about it, and this is why 
Congress must act. 
Now, my friends on the other side 
have tried to claim there is no problem 
here. They have waved around charts 
that are weeks and weeks old to try to 
pretend that everything is just fine, 
that everything is just beautiful. 
Well, I don’t need some outdated sta-
tistics to tell me what is going on 
today, Madam Speaker. I don’t need 
empty rhetoric from the occupant of 
the White House or Mr. DeJoy. My con-
stituents are my evidence. They have 
flooded my office with calls. They have 
stopped me on the street. Something is 
happening here, whether this adminis-
tration or its allies want to admit it or 
not. 
Before my friends on the other side 
try to paint this issue as some kind of 
liberal 
conspiracy, 
let 
me 
remind 
them: There is no money for hungry 
families here, although they badly need 
it; there is no funding for State and 
local governments here, though they 
are pleading with all of us for relief. We 
have already acted on all that. It is 
MITCH MCCONNELL over in the Senate 
who is determined to do absolutely 
nothing. 
All this bill does is get the Postal 
Service back to where it was at the 
start of the year and provide them with 
the resources they need, not just to 
process an influx of ballots, but to con-
tinue delivering mail, including Ameri-
cans’ Social Security checks and medi-
cations. It ensures that they are able 
to continue delivering to places in 
rural America that their competitors 
just don’t go, and it supports the Post-
al Service’s more than 630,000 hard-
working employees. And we all owe 
them a debt of gratitude for their serv-
ice, especially during this pandemic. 
Madam Speaker, if we don’t under-
mine and tear apart the Postal Service, 
then they can handle the increase in 
mail-in ballots. They handled two to 
three times the volume of mail and 
packages at Christmastime, and they 
are determined to handle the volume of 
election-related mail. But they need 
their equipment; they need to pay their 
workers; they need confidence that 
management won’t try to undercut 
them on the job; and they need support 
from this Congress, Democrats and Re-
publicans. 
That is it. This is all pretty bare 
bones, Madam Speaker. I don’t see why 
in the world that Republicans won’t 
join us on this. It shouldn’t be a radical 
concept to suggest that, in the United 
States of America, every vote should 
count, whether it is for Donald Trump, 
Joe Biden, or someone else. 
It shouldn’t be a tough call to sup-
port the United States Postal Service. 
More than 90 percent of Americans 
view this agency favorably because it 
is their lifeline in so many ways. 
Madam Speaker, this is a five-alarm 
fire on our democracy. I think our 
country is worth fighting for. I hope all 
my colleagues join together to help us 
save it. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. WOODALL. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, I thank my friend 
from Massachusetts for yielding, but 
that is probably where our agreement 
is going to end today. 
We are not here because democracy is 
under siege. We are here because the 
Democratic House leadership is under-
performing. We haven’t gotten appro-
priations bills negotiated to the White 
House. We haven’t gotten transpor-
tation bills negotiated to the White 
House. We haven’t gotten water infra-
structure bills negotiated to the White

House. I can go on and on and on. And 
we are here today with yet another bill 
that there is absolutely no effort to ne-
gotiate and send to the White House. 
Madam Speaker, you are going to 
hear more about Donald Trump today 
than you are going to hear about the 
Postal Service today, and that is be-
cause we are not here about the Postal 
Service. We are here for another round 
of attacks on President Trump. 
I get it. Folks don’t like President 
Trump on this side of the aisle. I get it. 
Folks have concerns about President 
Trump’s rhetoric on all sides of the 
aisle. 
But the Postal Service has $10 bil-
lion. I asked the question yesterday, 
Madam Speaker: For the $25 billion 
bailout package we are here about 
today, how much of that money are we 
going to spend this year? How much do 
we need to protect the election infra-
structure my friend from Massachu-
setts just described? I couldn’t get an 
answer. Folks didn’t know an answer. 
Conveniently, we are going to have 
the Postmaster General called before 
the House for a hearing for these an-
swers in about 48 hours. About 2 days 
after we have passed this bill, we are 
going to get all the answers about why 
this bill may or may not be necessary. 
What my friend from Massachusetts 
said—I have gotten pessimistic, in 
light of our 6-hour Rules Committee 
hearing yesterday. I actually agree 
with my friend from Massachusetts on 
much more. He is right that we owe a 
thank-you to our men and women of 
the Postal Service for the work that 
they are doing. 
The previous Postmaster General 
came to Congress in the spring, worried 
that mail volume was going to collapse 
and the Postal Service was going to 
enter a period of financial instability. 
The truth, Madam Speaker, is just the 
opposite. Postal office deliveries have 
exploded. Folks are doing e-commerce 
like never before. Our men and women 
of the Postal Service are working hard-
er than ever before, delivering more 
packages today than they were 6 
months ago. And we owe them a big, 
big thank-you for their work during 
these times. My friend from Massachu-
setts is right: It is a lifeline for so 
many families. 
Madam Speaker, it is an election 
year. Who believes that serving their 
constituents comes from denying vet-
erans access to prescription drugs? No-
body. If that is what this was about, we 
would have gotten together, Repub-
licans and Democrats, House and Sen-
ate, Congress and the White House, and 
we would be moving legislation in a co-
operative way. 
We heard from the ranking Repub-
lican yesterday on the committee. He 
wasn’t consulted in these conversa-
tions. He wasn’t brought in to these 
conversations. There are no Republican 
amendments here. There is no con-
versation going on with the Senate. 
This is another wasteful partisan exer-
cise in a time when—my friend from 
Massachusetts is absolutely right— 
there are real crises that need to be ad-
dressed. 
I had hoped when we were called back 
on a Saturday, Madam Speaker, it 
would have been to address one of 
those crises. But the truth is, it is just 
the punctuation mark at the end of the 
Democratic National Convention week. 
And to the leadership’s credit, they 
scheduled it so that it wouldn’t inter-
fere with the Republican National Con-
vention next week. 
How convenient that our scheduling 
was dictated by two political conven-
tions, because that is the only reason 
that we are here today, Madam Speak-
er: politics. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
I am just getting a little sick and 
tired of all of the excuses as to why my 
Republican friends don’t want to join 
us in helping the American people. 
My friend mentioned the appropria-
tions bills. Well, with all due respect, 
we passed almost all of them here in 
the House. My friend, the Republican 
leader in the Senate, hasn’t done a 
damn thing, hasn’t passed one. 
We passed the HEROES Act, which 
would have helped the Postal Service, 
which would have provided relief to 
cities and towns, which would have 
provided assistance to those in this 
country who are going hungry. The 
Senate majority leader hasn’t done a 
damn thing, not anything, hasn’t lifted 
a finger for anybody. And we have even 
agreed to meet him halfway. He still 
won’t negotiate. 
On an infrastructure bill, we passed 
an infrastructure bill here. Negotiate 
with the Senate? They haven’t passed a 
damn thing. It is malpractice. If politi-
cians could be sued for malpractice, 
then the Senate majority leader would 
be sued. This is ridiculous. 
And here we are with a crisis in the 
Postal Service. Mail has slowed down 
all across the country. Members are 
getting 
calls, 
including 
Republican 
Members. And what is the response? 
Oh, well, we will just let it go. You 
know, we will say we need to do better. 
We will deal with this another day. 
This is ridiculous, it is unconscion-
able, and I am tired of the excuses. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to 
the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. 
POCAN). 
Mr. POCAN. Madam Speaker, this 
President is on a warpath to destroy 
the Postal Service and, through that, 
our elections. 
After months of hearing this Presi-
dent, and now Republican Members of 
Congress, spread conspiracy theories 
and misinformation about voting by 
mail, he has made GOP megadonor 
Louis DeJoy his new chief of chaos in 
voter suppression. 
In an attack on the Postal Service, 
DeJoy has removed mail processing 
equipment, collection boxes, and cut 
back on overtime. Ninety Democrats, 
led 
by 
Congresswoman 
KATHERINE 
CLARK and me, already demanded his 
immediate removal. 
Because, on top of this blatant voter 
suppression, Trump and DeJoy are 
hurting millions who depend on the 
Postal Service every day: seniors and 
veterans waiting for lifesaving medica-
tions, families waiting for paychecks, 
small businesses with delayed packages 
whose very survival is already threat-
ened by COVID–19. 
On Thursday, the Progressive Caucus 
held a hearing and heard from David 
Williams, the former vice president of 
the Postal Service Board of Directors, 
who resigned in protest to Trump’s ac-
tions. What he told us, unfortunately, 
shocked no one: that the Postal Serv-
ice was fully prepared for mail voting 
until this administration manufac-
tured an intentional crisis; that DeJoy 
wasn’t selected by the firm that was 
hired to find a new Postmaster Gen-
eral, but he was the only candidate 
interviewed and was unqualified to lead 
the Postal Service; and that Steve 
Mnuchin sought intrusive control over 
core Postal Service operations and 
wanted to impose a pricing practice 
that would ruin the Postal Service. 
This chaos is not the result of a pan-
demic. This chaos was manufactured 
by the administration and is inten-
tional. 
That is why Congress is acting today. 
We are reversing Louis DeJoy’s disas-
trous actions and providing the Postal 
Service with the funding it so des-
perately needs. We won’t let anyone 
dismantle our Postal Service. The 
Postal Service belongs to the people. 
b 1045 
Mr. WOODALL. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself 1 minute. 
Ordinarily, I am concerned that I 
only have 30 minutes for Rule Com-
mittee debate, but the lunacy that we 
are hearing down here today makes me 
glad that we are going to be done with 
this in 30 minutes. 
Madam Speaker, you know when Eli-
jah Cummings chaired the committee 
and MARK MEADOWS was the ranking 
member, now President Trump’s chief 
of staff, we came together to do Postal 
Service reforms because we all know 
the Postal Service needs to be re-
formed. We all know this. We could do 
it today, if it was about Postal Service 
reform, if it was about Postal Service 
improvement, but it is not. 
What is the solution today? Throw 
more money at a problem. We don’t 
trust the Postmaster General, the 
other side says. We don’t trust the 
President, the other side says. So what 
is the solution to the manufactured 
crisis? Give $25 billion to the Post-
master General and the President of 
the United States. 
In response to my assertion that this 
House is a do-nothing Congress because 
it fails to negotiate with the Senate 
and the White House, my friend from 
Massachusetts lists half a dozen bills

that this House passed unilaterally 
with no effort to negotiate with the 
Senate or negotiate with the White 
House. 
Madam Speaker, if what we want to 
do is come and talk, we have a wonder-
ful Chamber in which to do it. If what 
we want to do is come in and get some-
thing done, it can only get done to-
gether. This is yet another example of 
the House leadership’s failure to oper-
ate in a partnership fashion. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to 
the gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr. 
COLE), one of the greatest negotiators 
in the House, a gentleman who has a 
long history of bipartisanship, and 
thus, legislative success, the ranking 
member of the Rules Committee. 
Mr. COLE. Madam Speaker, I want to 
thank my good friend for yielding and 
very much appreciate his leadership on 
our committee. 
Madam Speaker, I want to rise to op-
pose both the rule and the underlying 
legislation. 
Before I do, though, I include in the 
RECORD
four newspaper articles dis-
cussing the majority’s concern about 
the Postal Service. The first is a Wall 
Street Journal editorial; a column by 
Rich Lowry appearing in the New York 
Post; a column by Byron York, appear-
ing in the Washington Examiner; and a 
column by Ruth Goldway, a former 
commissioner of the Postal Service, 
appearing in the New York Times. 
All four articles make it clear that 
the majority’s reasons for bringing this 
legislation, frankly, are ludicrous, and 
that what they are proposing actually 
will make it more difficult to reform. 
[From the Wall Street Journal, Aug. 17, 2020] 
NANCY PELOSI GOES POLITICALLY POSTAL 
(By the Editorial Board) 
Speaker Nancy Pelosi is calling the House 
back into session this week to address fears 
that the U.S. Postal Service is being infil-
trated by alien lizard people posing as letter 
carriers. OK, it isn’t quite that bad. The ac-
tual conspiracy theory holds that President 
Trump is strangling the USPS to hack the 
November election. 
But talk about ‘‘unsubstantiated,’’ as the 
press likes to call Donald Trump’s Twitter 
emissions. Democrats should be deeply em-
barrassed that their leadership has embraced 
such claims. Two Congressmen, including 
Democratic 
Caucus 
Chairman 
Hakeem 
Jeffries, wrote to the FBI on Monday to 
urge, if you can believe it, a criminal inves-
tigation of Postmaster General Louis DeJoy. 
‘‘This conspiracy theory is the most far- 
flung thing I think I’ve ever heard,’’ says 
Stephen Kearney, who worked at the USPS 
for 33 years, including as treasurer and a sen-
ior vice president. ‘‘DeJoy was not appointed 
by President Trump,’’ but by the USPS’s bi-
partisan governors. (Who, as it happens, se-
lected him unanimously.) 
‘‘You can find valid operational reasons for 
the actions taken by the Postal Service so 
far,’’ says Mike Plunkett, another longtime 
USPS executive who now leads the Associa-
tion for Postal Commerce. ‘‘In no way do I 
detect any criminality behind them, and I’m 
at a loss as to how one would reach that con-
clusion.’’ 
The Democratic letter to the FBI cites 
news reports that the USPS is decommis-
sioning hundreds of mail-sorting machines. 
But the context is that overall mail volume 
has fallen 33% since 2006. ‘‘They’ve been tak-
ing machines out of service for years now, 
and I’ve been encouraging them to do it 
more aggressively,’’ says Hamilton Davison, 
the president of the American Catalog Mail-
ers Association. ‘‘I think that’s a good thing 
for America, because we don’t want to pay 
for stuff that we don’t need.’’ 
Mr. Kearney, who now runs the Alliance of 
Nonprofit Mailers, concurs. ‘‘It’s obvious, to 
be efficient and not waste money, you need 
to take out some of that capacity,’’ he says. 
His group has similarly been urging produc-
tivity improvements, ‘‘because if they don’t 
do that, our postage rates are going to go 
way up.’’ A leaked USPS document floating 
in the online ether is titled ‘‘Equipment Re-
duction.’’ But it’s dated May 15, and Mr. 
DeJoy took over June 15. 
Another claim is that the USPS is pulling 
blue collection bins off the street en masse. 
‘‘They’re going around literally with tractor 
trailers picking up mailboxes,’’ Joe Biden 
said last week. ‘‘I mean, it’s bizarre!’’ The 
USPS says it has nearly 142,000 boxes across 
the country, which are adjusted as volume 
and costs dictate. In August 2016, the USPS’s 
Inspector General said that ‘‘the number of 
collection boxes declined by more than 12,000 
in the past 5 years.’’ Voter suppression by 
the Obama Administration? 
Alarmed Twitter users last week posted a 
photo of mailboxes on a flatbed truck in New 
Jersey. 
Oops: 
‘‘Morristown 
Mayor 
Tim 
Dougherty said the mailboxes were being re-
placed with new anti-fishing boxes,’’ the 
local newspaper explained. On Monday the 
USPS said it would postpone this security 
upgrade for 90 days ‘‘while we evaluate our 
customers’ concerns’’—in other words, to 
keep jittery partisans on the internet from 
losing their minds before Nov. 3. 
Mr. DeJoy is being knocked for trying to 
cut overtime costs. But is it any wonder? 
The day he was sworn in, the Inspector Gen-
eral reported that in 2019 the post office 
‘‘spent $1.1 billion in mail processing over-
time and penalty overtime, $280 million in 
late and extra transportation, and $2.9 bil-
lion in delivery overtime and penalty over-
time costs.’’ For context, the USPS’s overall 
loss that year was $8.8 billion. 
Mrs. Pelosi is trying to put on a political 
show, starring Democrats as the saviors of 
the post office. She says she wants to pass a 
bill that ‘‘prohibits the Postal Service from 
implementing any changes to operations or 
level of service it had in place on January 1.’’ 
Also in the mix may be a $25 billion cash in-
fusion. Then Chuck Schumer will demand 
that the Senate come back to town for the 
same vote. By the way the letter-carriers 
union endorsed Joe Biden on the weekend. 
This is a made-for-TV phony political cri-
sis. The USPS has long-term challenges, but 
enough money to last into 2021. Mr. DeJoy 
says there’s ‘‘ample capacity to deliver all 
election mail.’’ Some states have startlingly 
lax ballot deadlines, but nobody can pretend 
with a straight face that it’s the post office’s 
fault. Democrats have also scheduled a hear-
ing for next Monday so they can yell at Mr. 
DeJoy in person. How long before Rep. Adam 
Schiff 
says 
it’s 
another 
Russia-Donald 
Trump conspiracy to steal the election? 
[Aug. 17, 2020] 
THE LEFT’S LUNATIC ‘POSTAL’ CONSPIRACY 
THEORY 
(By Rich Lowry) 
At this rate, Postmaster General Louis 
DeJoy will be lucky if he isn’t arrested and 
tried for treason before a people’s tribunal. 
DeJoy has quickly replaced Vladimir Putin 
as the man that progressive opinion will hold 
responsible if Trump wins a second term in 
November. 
According to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, 
DeJoy is a ‘‘complicit crony’’ aiding Trump’s 
effort to sabotage American democracy. She 
believes the two have hatched a plot to delay 
mail-in voting and disenfranchise countless 
Americans prior to the election. 
Protesters over the weekend showed up at 
DeJoy’s Washington apartment and North 
Carolina home. Two Democratic congress-
men have called for a criminal inquiry into 
his changes at the postal service, and he will 
testify at a House hearing next week. 
In tried and true fashion, President Trump 
has stoked suspicions by saying that he op-
poses a $25 billion postal-service bailout in 
the latest Democratic COVID-relief bill. Ac-
cording to Trump, blocking this measure— 
and $3 billion in election aid to the states— 
will prevent universal mail-in voting. 
But the bailout doesn’t have anything to 
do with mail-in voting, and given the billions 
of pieces of mail handled by the post office 
every week, it surely can handle the in-
creased volume from mail-in voting. 
It is true that Postmaster General DeJoy 
is a major Trump donor. He made his fortune 
in shipping and logistics, though, and he was 
selected by the postal service’s board of gov-
ernors. 
Little did he know when he took over the 
agency in June that he’d soon have a star-
ring role in the country’s latest psycho-
drama. Every change at the postal service is 
now seen through the prism of a belief that 
the 
agency 
is 
a 
tool 
of 
creeping 
authoritarianism. 
Letter collection boxes are being re-
moved—never mind that this has been an on-
going process for years. Underused boxes are 
decommissioned or moved to higher-traffic 
areas. In 2009, The Washington Post reported 
that 200,000 boxes had been shelved over the 
prior two decades. In 2016, the inspector gen-
eral noted that another 12,000 collection 
boxes had been cut over the previous five 
years. 
Letter collection boxes all of the sudden 
have big red locks on them—well, yeah, as an 
off-hours device to prevent the theft of mail, 
something the service has also done for 
years. 
The postal service is deactivating mail- 
sorting machines—right, and there was a 
plan for this prior to DeJoy becoming post-
master general, and it has been long dis-
cussed in response to the declining volume of 
mail. 
DeJoy is cutting back on overtime—indeed 
he is, because artificially swollen overtime is 
an enormous expense that he hopes to elimi-
nate with a more rational delivery system. 
Democrats and much of the media make it 
sound as though the post office was an effi-
cient, smooth-running agency before DeJoy 
took charge and then, at Trump’s behest, 
transformed it into place struggling to keep 
up with broadbased changes in how we com-
municate. 
In reality, the post office has lost nearly 
$80 billion since 2007, and it lost more than $2 
billion last quarter. Unless the service finds 
a way to innovate, it is headed for bank-
ruptcy. 
This is the impetus for DeJoy’s reforms, 
which should be welcomed by all the people 
now caterwauling about how essential the 
post office is to the American way of life. 
DeJoy has been adamant that the postal 
service will do its job regarding mail-in bal-
lots. The post office’s recent warnings to 
states that they should be mindful of how 
quickly ballots can be delivered were played 
up as yet another assault on mail-in bal-
loting. To the contrary, they were intended 
to avoid unrealistically late deadlines for 
mail-in voting that could create a train- 
wreck in November. 
But in their inflamed state, Democrats 
want a villain—if not a foreign potentate,

[From the Washington Examiner] 
A REALITY-BASED LOOK AT TRUMP AND THE 
POST OFFICE 
(By Byron York) 
The news is filled with reports of President 
Trump’s ‘‘assault’’ on the U.S. Postal Serv-
ice. The president, Democrats and some in 
the media say, is deliberately slowing mail 
delivery and crippling the Postal Service so 
that it cannot handle an anticipated flood of 
voting by mail in the presidential election. 
Former President Barack Obama said Trump 
is trying to ‘‘actively kneecap’’ the Postal 
Service to suppress the vote. Speaker Nancy 
Pelosi has called the House back into session 
this week and has set an ‘‘urgent hearing’’ 
for Aug. 24, demanding Postmaster General 
Louis DeJoy and the head of the Postal Serv-
ice Board of Governors testify ‘‘to address 
the sabotage of the Postal Service.’’ 
Some of the accusations have grown so 
frantic that they resemble the frenzy of a 
couple of years ago over the allegation, from 
many of the same people, that Trump had 
conspired with Russia to fix the 2016 elec-
tion. Now, it’s the Postal Service. But what 
actually is going on? Here is a brief look at 
some of the issues involved. 
142.5 BILLION PIECES OF MAIL 
The idea that the Postal Service will not 
be able to handle the volume of mail in the 
election, or not be able to handle it within 
normal Postal Service time guidelines, does 
not make much sense. According to its most 
recent annual report, last year, in fiscal year 
2019, the Postal Service handled 142.5 billion 
pieces of mail. ‘‘On a typical day, our 633,000 
employees physically process and deliver 471 
million mailpieces to nearly 160 million de-
livery points,’’ the report says. This year, 
that number is higher, given the Postal 
Service’s delivery of census forms and stim-
ulus checks. Those alone added about 450 
million additional pieces of mail. 
In 2016, about 136 million Americans voted 
in the presidential election. The number will 
probably be a bit higher this year. If officials 
sent ballots to every single American reg-
istered to vote, about 158 million people, and 
then 140 million people returned ballots, the 
roughly 298 million pieces of mail handled 
over the course of several weeks would be 
well within the Postal Service’s ability to 
handle. Of course, officials will not send a 
ballot to every American registered to vote, 
and not every voter will vote by mail. What-
ever the final number is, the ballots that are 
cast by mail will not cripple a system that 
delivers 471 million pieces of mail every day. 
There are, of course, compelling examples 
of election dysfunction, most notably the 
mess New York made of some of its congres-
sional primaries this summer. But rather 
than representing a Postal Service problem, 
that was because some states are unprepared 
for a dramatic increase of voting by mail. 
The states have to prepare the ballots, ad-
dress them, and process and count them 
when the Postal Service delivers them. That 
is the focus of the entirely legitimate fears 
of a possible vote-counting disaster this 
year. But it’s not the Postal Service. 
$25 BILLION FOR WHAT? 
Some news reports have left the impres-
sion that the Postal Service will not be able 
to handle mail-in ballots without an imme-
diate infusion of money from Congress. That 
is not the case. 
The Postal Service is not funded by a reg-
ular appropriation. It is, instead, an ‘‘inde-
pendent agency’’ and is expected to support 
itself, beyond a yearly appropriation of 
about $55 million to cover the costs of mail 
for the blind and overseas balloting in elec-
tions. 
The Postal Service has lost money for a 
very long time. In fiscal year 2019, it had op-
erating revenues of $71.1 billion and oper-
ating expenses of $79.9 billion, leaving it with 
a deficit of $8.8 billion. At the moment, Post-
al Service officials have told Congress, it has 
about $14 billion in cash on hand, putting it 
on the road to fiscal insolvency (without fur-
ther aid) in late 2021. 
In the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Eco-
nomic Security Act, or CARES Act, the $2 
trillion relief measure passed in March, Con-
gress gave the Postal Service a $10 billion 
borrowing authority. After the bill became 
law, there were negotiations between the 
Postal Service and the Treasury Department 
on the terms of the borrowing; a deal was an-
nounced in July. The ability to borrow $10 
billion, the postmaster general said, would 
‘‘delay the approaching liquidity crisis.’’ 
That was all the aid for the Postal Service 
in the CARES Act. Completely separately, 
the bill also gave $400 million to something 
called the Election Assistance Commission 
for distribution to states to ‘‘prevent, pre-
pare for, and respond to coronavirus, domes-
tically or internationally, for the 2020 federal 
election cycle.’’ 
The next mega-relief package, a $3 trillion 
bill known as the Health and Economic Re-
cover Omnibus Emergency Solutions Act, or 
HEROES Act, was passed by the House in 
May by a vote of 208 to 199. The winning 
total of 208 votes was comprised of 207 Demo-
crats and one Republican. Fourteen Demo-
crats and one independent voted against the 
measure. The bill has so far gone nowhere in 
the Republican-controlled Senate. 
The House HEROES Act would give $25 bil-
lion to the Postal Service in what is essen-
tially a bailout. The bill mentions nothing 
about helping the Postal Service handle the 
upcoming election or any other election. In-
deed, the only stipulation at all placed on 
the $25 billion is that the Postal Service, 
‘‘during the coronavirus emergency, shall 
prioritize the purchase of, and make avail-
able to all Postal Service employees and fa-
cilities, personal protective equipment, in-
cluding gloves, masks, and sanitizers, and 
shall conduct additional cleaning and sani-
tizing of Postal Service facilities and deliv-
ery vehicles.’’ If the House Democrats who 
wrote and passed the bill intended the money 
to be spent specifically for elections, they 
did not say so in the text of the legislation. 
Separate from the Postal Service provi-
sions, the bill would give $3.6 billion to the 
Election Assistance Commission for distribu-
tion to states ‘‘for contingency planning, 
preparation, and resilience of elections for 
federal office.’’ There has been some confu-
sion about that; some discussion of the cur-
rent controversy has left the impression that 
Democrats want $3.6 billion for the Postal 
Service for the election. In fact, the $3.6 bil-
lion would be for the states’ election use. In 
neither the CARES Act, which is now law, 
nor the HEROES Act, which has been passed 
by the House but not the Senate, is there 
any money given to the Postal Service spe-
cifically for the election. In any event, the 
Postal Service has the capacity to handle 
the election and does not need any addi-
tional money specifically to do the job. 
THE LATEST REFORM PROPOSAL 
Whatever its other concerns at the mo-
ment, the Postal Service does have chronic 
financial problems. This year, Trump chose 
DeJoy, who made a fortune in shipping and 
logistics and whose former company was a 
contractor of the Postal Service for many 
years, as the new postmaster general. (DeJoy 
is also a major donor to Republicans and the 
Trump campaign.) DeJoy has attempted to 
deal with some of the Postal Service’s sys-
temic problems with a pilot program to 
make deliveries more efficient while reduc-
ing the Postal Service’s crippling overtime 
costs, which added up to more than $1 billion 
in fiscal year 2018. 
In the past, postal delivery worked this 
way: A worker would arrive in the morning 
and work on various things in the office— 
sorting mail, handling holds on mail, waiting 
for incoming mail to arrive to prepare for de-
livery. That often involved waiting around 
for hours and then starting an actual deliv-
ery route later in the day. Once started, a 
route has to be finished, and that involved 
workers going into overtime as they deliv-
ered through their route as evening ap-
proached. 
DeJoy’s plan, now being implemented in a 
pilot program in about 200 cities, is called 
Expedited to Street/Afternoon Sortation, or 
ESAS. Under it, a worker would arrive in the 
morning, collect all the mail that was ready 
to go out, and head out for delivery—‘‘re-
trieve, load, and go.’’ Then, after finishing 
the delivery route, the carrier would return 
to the office and do in the afternoon the of-
fice work that used to be done in the morn-
ing. That way, when the end of his or her 
shift arrived, that would be the end of the 
workday, with no overtime incurred. Mail 
that arrived to the office in the afternoon, 
while the carrier was doing office work, 
would be delivered in the next morning’s 
route. It would be ready and waiting when 
the carrier arrived for ‘‘retrieve, load, and 
go.’’ 
The effect to customers would be that mail 
that was delivered to the office in the after-
noon would be delivered the next morning, 
instead of that evening. The effect to the 
Postal Service would be to save an enormous 
amount of money in overtime. 
In addition, there have been reports of the 
Postal Service removing collection boxes 
and sorting machines. While some Demo-
crats and journalists have portrayed that as 
another effort toward voter suppression, the 
fact is the number of letters the Postal Serv-
ice handles each year has declined for 20 
years since the arrival of email. In those last 
two 
decades, 
the 
Postal 
Service 
has 
downsized its capabilities as the number of 
letters handled has decreased. Here is how 
the Washington Post described the situation, 
specifically concerning sorting machines: 
‘‘Purchased when letters not packages made 
up a greater share of postal work, the bulky 
and aging machines can be expensive to 
maintain and take up floor space postal lead-
ers say would be better devoted to boxes. Re-
moving underused machines would make the 
overall system more efficient, postal leaders 
say. The Postal Service has cut back on 
mail-sorting equipment for years since mail 
volume began to decline in the 2000s.’’ 
Some Democrats have characterized the 
current reform efforts, much needed in an 
agency losing so much money, as part of the 
president’s master plan to steal the election. 
But together, the Expedited to Street/After-
noon Sortation program and the cutback in 
sorting capacity would seem to be reasonable 
measures of the type the Postal Service 
needs to implement, and indeed has been im-
plementing over the years. Yet this is what 
Democrats, and some of their allies in the 
press, have labeled as an ‘‘assault’’ on the 
Postal Service. 
NIGHTMARE SCENARIOS 
Many news accounts have included stories 
of Americans suffering from interruptions in 
Postal Service deliveries. For example, a 
story in the New York Times headlined 
‘‘Postal Crisis Ripples Across Nation As 
Election Looms’’ included the story of Vic-
toria Brownworth, a freelance journalist in

Philadelphia. ‘‘For Ms. Brownworth, who 
was paralyzed four years ago, the mail is her 
lifeline,’’ the New York Times said, ‘‘deliv-
ering prescriptions and checks and mail-in 
ballots to her Philadelphia home. But that 
lifeline has snapped. She said she had re-
ceived mail just twice in the past three 
weeks, and she dreaded November’s election, 
worried that her ballot would suffer the 
same fate as the oxygen tube that she or-
dered three weeks ago—and that had still 
not arrived.’’ 
Other news reports have included many 
other examples. They are largely, if not en-
tirely, anecdotal. While each is serious for 
the person involved, at the moment, it is im-
possible to tell how much of a national prob-
lem they represent. People who keep track of 
the Postal Service suspect that many of the 
stories are rooted in workforce availability 
problems related to the coronavirus pan-
demic, plus the changes in operations (for 
example, closing a facility to clean it during 
an outbreak) that have become part of life 
during the pandemic. The Postal Service 
would not be the only large organization 
that has found it impossible to operate as 
usual during the crisis. 
There is also the fact that the Postal Serv-
ice does, on occasion, fail to deliver the mail. 
In its annual reports, it includes data on 
‘‘performance outcomes.’’ For example, for 
first-class mail, which is the type of mail 
that would be most employed for election 
purposes, the goal in fiscal year 2019 was to 
deliver 96% of letters in one to three busi-
ness days. Its actual performance was 92%. 
So 8% of first-class letters were not delivered 
on time. Now, consider that the Postal Serv-
ice handled 54.9 billion pieces of first-class 
mail in fiscal year 2019. That is more than 4 
billion pieces of first-class mail that were 
not delivered on time. And that, in a fraught 
political situation, could be the basis for a 
lot of anecdotes in news articles. 
Many of those anecdotes, by the way, ap-
pear to have made it to the media with the 
help of the Postal Service unions. There are 
two major unions representing Postal Serv-
ice workers. On Friday, the largest postal 
union, the National Association of Letter 
Carriers, endorsed Democratic candidate Joe 
Biden for president. In June, another union, 
the American Postal Workers Union, en-
dorsed Biden as well. In 2016, both unions en-
dorsed Hillary Clinton. In 2008 and 2012, both 
unions endorsed Barack Obama. In 2004, they 
endorsed John Kerry. And so on. 
One more note about delivery times. A few 
days ago, the Washington Post published a 
story headlined ‘‘Postal Service warns 46 
states their voters could be disenfranchised 
by delayed mail-in ballots.’’ The paper ob-
tained letters from Postal Service leadership 
to various states informing them that some 
of their election deadlines are ‘‘incongruous 
with the Postal Service’s delivery stand-
ards.’’ The resulting ‘‘mismatch,’’ the Postal 
Service said, ‘‘creates a risk that ballots re-
quested near the deadline under state law 
will not be returned by mail in time to be 
counted under your laws as we understand 
them.’’ In other words, several states are not 
giving the Postal Service long enough to de-
liver a ballot to a voter and then deliver the 
filled-in ballot to the state election board. 
For example, if a state’s law allows a voter 
to request a ballot seven days before the gen-
eral election but also requires that votes 
must be received by election day to be count-
ed—that would be a recipe for a lot of votes 
not being counted. It was an entirely reason-
able concern on the part of the Postal Serv-
ice, and it is a problem more for the states 
than the Postal Service. Yet media discus-
sion of the story suggested it was just an-
other chapter in what one source in the 
Washington 
Post 
account 
called 
‘‘the 
weaponization of the U.S. Postal Service for 
the president’s electoral purposes.’’ 
TRUMP CONFUSES EVERYTHING 
Despite the heated rhetoric, many of the 
Postal Service’s problems are relatively 
clear, if extremely difficult to solve. In the 
context of the upcoming election, Trump has 
repeatedly added confusion to the situation, 
most recently with extended discussions in a 
television interview on Thursday and a press 
conference on Friday. 
In the press conference, Trump was asked, 
‘‘If the Democrats were to give you some of 
what you want . . . would you be willing to 
accept the $25 billion for the Postal Service, 
including the three and a half billion dollars 
to handle mail-in voting?’’ As has happened 
many times in this controversy, the question 
conflated the Democrats’ proposal for $25 bil-
lion for the Postal Service and the request 
for $3.6 billion for the Election Assistance 
Commission. In any event, Trump answered, 
‘‘Sure, if they give us what we want.’’ He 
then began to elaborate on other policy pri-
orities. 
‘‘So, if they were to give you that, you 
would sign off for the money for the Postal 
Service?’’ 
‘‘Yeah, but they’re not giving it to me,’’ 
Trump said. ‘‘They’re giving it to the Amer-
ican people.’’ 
‘‘But if they were to agree to that—‘‘ 
‘‘Yeah, I would,’’ Trump said. ‘‘I would cer-
tainly do that. Sure, I would do that. Yeah.’’ 
The next day, Friday, Trump spoke to Fox 
News’s Maria Bartiromo. ‘‘They [Democrats] 
want $3.5 billion for the mail-in votes, OK, 
universal 
mail-in 
ballots, 
$3.5 
billion,’’ 
Trump said. ‘‘They want $25 billion for the 
post office. Now, they need that money in 
order to have the post office work so it can 
take all of these millions and millions of bal-
lots. Now in the meantime, they aren’t get-
ting there. By the way, those are just two 
items. But if they don’t get those two items, 
that means you can’t have universal mail-in 
voting because they’re not equipped to have 
it.’’ 
In fact, while the $3.5 billion proposal for 
the Election Assistance Commission (it is 
actually $3.6 billion) is specifically for the 
purpose of facilitating mail-in voting, the $25 
billion for the Postal Service is basically a 
bailout. In April, the previous postmaster 
general, Megan Brennan, citing a ‘‘steep 
drop’’ in mail volume during the coronavirus 
crisis, had asked for far more—$75 billion. 
The Postal Service didn’t get anywhere near 
that much money in the first relief bill, the 
CARES Act—just $10 billion in borrowing au-
thority. So when the second relief mega-bill 
came up, Democrats threw in $25 billion for 
the Postal Service. It was not about mail-in 
voting. (On Sunday morning, White House 
chief of staff Mark Meadows, who as a con-
gressman followed postal issues closely, said 
the administration offered House Democrats 
$10 billion for the Postal Service.) 
Nevertheless, the president connected the 
two and suggested that the Postal Service 
needed the $25 billion, and the Election As-
sistance Commission needed $3.5 billion, to 
handle ballots in the election, and that he 
would not give it to them for that very rea-
son. 
‘‘How would you like to have $3.5 billion, 
billion, for mail-in voting?’’ Trump asked. 
‘‘So, if you don’t have it—do you know how 
much money that is? Nobody has any idea 
. . . Oh, $3.5 billion. They want $25 billion for 
the Post Office because the Post Office is 
going to have to go to town to get these ri-
diculous ballots in . . . Now, if we don’t 
make a deal, that means they don’t get the 
money. That means they can’t have uni-
versal mail-in voting. They just can’t have 
it.’’ 
The bottom line was that Trump made a 
mess of the issue. He didn’t make a case 
against universal mail-in voting, which does 
not exist in the United States. He didn’t 
make clear why Democrats wanted $25 bil-
lion for the post office. He suggested that 
not agreeing to the $25 billion was a way to 
stop universal mail-in voting, which it is 
not. He didn’t address the serious problems 
at the Postal Service which need attention 
and do not have anything to do with voting. 
In all, he left the issue more confused than it 
had been beforehand—and that was saying 
something. 
DEMOCRATS SMELL VICTORY 
On Friday, the Washington Post published 
a story headlined ‘‘Trump’s assault on the 
U.S. Postal Service gives Democrats a new 
campaign message.’’ Put aside the casual use 
of the word ‘‘assault.’’ The fact is, Pelosi, 
Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, and 
other top Democrats are jumping on the 
Postal Service controversy with both feet. 
‘‘Democrats are already blanketing the air-
waves, latching on to the opportunity to 
highlight support [for the Postal Service],’’ 
the paper reported. Obama has joined in, 
tweeting that seniors and veterans and small 
businesses ‘‘can’t be collateral damage for an 
administration more concerned with sup-
pressing the vote than suppressing a virus.’’ 
The Democratic commentariat cheered and 
signaled it is ready to press the issue until 
election day. ‘‘Trump donor & Postmaster 
General Louis DeJoy should be in the cross-
hairs of every relevant congressional com-
mittee, inspector general, prosecutor, inves-
tigative journalist, whistleblower, class ac-
tion lawyer, editorial board, etc. etc. etc.,’’ 
tweeted former U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara. 
No doubt that is precisely what will happen 
in the Democratic world and some major 
media outlets between now and Nov. 3. But 
shouldn’t someone, sometime take a look at 
what is actually happening? 
[From the New York Times, Aug. 18, 2020] 
I WAS A POSTAL SERVICE REGULATOR FOR 18 
YEARS. DON’T PANIC. 
(By Ruth Y. Goldway) 
President Trump has threatened to with-
hold funds from the United States Postal 
Service. The new postmaster general, Louis 
DeJoy, has embarked on cost-cutting meas-
ures to eliminate overtime and remove sort-
ing machines. These actions have created 
worries that Americans, reluctant to walk 
into voting booths because of Covid–19, will 
be unable to vote by mail this year. 
I served as a regulator of the Postal Serv-
ice for nearly 18 years under three presidents 
and I urge everyone to be calm. Don’t fall 
prey to the alarmists on both sides of this 
debate. The Postal Service is not incapaci-
tated. It is still fully capable of delivering 
the mail. The focus of our collective con-
cerns should be on how the Postal Service 
can improve the speed of delivery for elec-
tion mail. 
First, the president is wrong about the 
Postal Service’s finances. While the agency 
indeed has financial problems, as a result of 
a huge increase in packages being sent 
through the system and a credit line through 
the CARES Act, it has access to about $25 
billion in cash. Its own forecasts predict that 
it will have enough money to operate into 
2021. 
The Postal Service’s shaky financial situa-
tion has to do in large part with the drop in 
first-class mail (typically used for letters), 
about 30 percent less than a decade ago. But 
the service’s expensive, overbuilt infrastruc-
ture can absorb the addition of more mail in 
2020—including election mail that is mailed 
to and sent back by every voter in every 
state.

August 22, 2020 
The new postmaster general’s management 
team still includes many knowledgeable and 
seasoned executives. And the Postal Service 
has over 500,000 employees who are remark-
ably honest, dedicated and used to working 
through 
emergencies: 
hurricanes, 
snow 
storms, social unrest and pandemics. 
While the Postal Service has contemplated 
many different approaches to modernizing 
and improving efficiency, there has not been 
a consensus on how much the service should 
reduce costs. It is not at all surprising that 
Mr. DeJoy’s choice of particularly visible 
cuts has raised alarms. 
The Office of the Inspector General of the 
Postal Service has agreed to a review of the 
changes. And Congress has been called back 
to conduct its own review next week, restore 
trust in the institution and ensure that vot-
ing by mail proceeds smoothly. 
Given that there is enough money and per-
haps more if the president agrees to addi-
tional bailout funds; that there is plenty of 
capacity in the system; and that voting by 
mail can alleviate a health threat to the na-
tion, the Postal Service should be made to 
handle all election mail as if it were first- 
class mail. This is where the policy discus-
sions surrounding the Postal Service should 
settle. 
Most election-related mail is sent at non-
profit rates. The 1993 National Voter Reg-
istration Act requires the Postal Service to 
charge state and local election offices the 
same price for postage as nonprofit mailers. 
The Postal Service has a history of providing 
extra care and attention to election-related 
mail, on the level of first-class mail: usually 
two to four days for delivery. A special logo 
and bar code identifiers were created so that 
mail sorters were able to pull election mail 
out from the routine mail stream to be sure 
it was delivered as soon as possible. 
But a recent letter sent by Thomas J. Mar-
shall, the general counsel for the Postal 
Service, to election officials around the 
country seems to suggest that election mail 
will now be treated like regular nonprofit 
mail (typically three to 10 days for delivery) 
and may take as long as 15 days. This is not 
acceptable. 
The Postal Service has the capacity to en-
sure that ballots sent to voters arrive on 
time and that ballots dropped into the sys-
tem by voters are postmarked and delivered 
in times that accord with state and local 
guidelines. In their meeting with Congress 
next week, the leaders of the Postal Service 
should guarantee that election mail will con-
tinue to be treated as first-class mail. The 
Congress should agree that there will be no 
additional financial support for the Postal 
Service without this promise. 
But state and local election officials must 
also recognize the possibilities of delays and 
plan for earlier mailings so there will be 
more days for ballots to be returned. Voters 
must be reminded to send in requests for bal-
lots, change of address, voter registration 
forms and especially filled-out ballots as 
early as possible. 
The Postal Service does indeed need a bail-
out from Congress so that it can be counted 
on to deliver the mail, medicines and other 
vital products for years to come. It needs 
funds to rebuild its more than 30,000 post of-
fices and aging vehicle fleet to reduce its re-
liance on temporary workers and to broaden 
the range of services it provides. But these 
problems do not affect this year’s election. 
Americans must continue to support the 
Postal Service, whose existence is enshrined 
in our Constitution, by using its vote-by- 
mail services to save lives now and to pro-
tect our democracy in the future. 
Mr. COLE. Madam Speaker, I rise to 
oppose the rule for a very simple rea-
son. It is a silly rule. It actually vio-
lates the rules that my friends passed 
at the beginning of this Congress. The 
legislation before us has not gone 
through any committee, has not been 
marked up, has not been debated, has 
not been amended. 
My friend said at the beginning of 
the Congress they wouldn’t bring legis-
lation like that to the floor, they con-
veniently waived that rule yesterday. 
So here it comes with no committee 
procedure or markup. We had a number 
of amendments, Madam Speaker, that 
were presented to the committee, none 
of them were made in order. 
I offered an amendment for what is 
called an open rule, where any Member 
could come down here and put forward 
what they thought would be a better 
idea since we had no opportunity to do 
that in committee. That too was re-
jected. 
So this rule is a take-it-or-leave-it 
ultimatum from the majority, and it 
means you can pass it in the House, but 
it is not going anywhere else. 
Now, let’s turn to the bill itself. My 
friends say that—we are going to hear 
a lot of bad things about the Post-
master General in the course of the 
morning. I have never met him. I don’t 
know him. The people that do know 
him say that he is a really good guy, 
but I don’t know. We are going to hear 
a lot of terrible things about him. But 
at the end of the day my friends are 
going to vote to give him $25 billion, 
and they are going to do it in a bill 
that has no reforms in it, just says you 
can’t change anything. Now, how smart 
is that? 
You can’t change anything in an in-
stitution that is losing $8 to $9 billion 
every single year. We don’t trust the 
person who heads this, but we are going 
to give him $25 billion. Do we need that 
money? Absolutely not. The post office 
tells us they have $15 billion on hand, 
they have access to a $10 billion line of 
credit that will more than take them 
for a year from now. So we don’t need 
to be spending this money right now. It 
is a silly, silly bill. 
But I want to give my friends some 
free political advice. They want to pass 
this bill. They want to get it through 
the Senate. They want to get it to the 
President’s desk. They want to get it 
signed. I believe that. If that is true, 
make it bigger. Do exactly what my 
friend, the distinguished chairman of 
the committee said, let’s put some 
stuff in it that we agree on. 
The President of the United States 
says, I think every family in America 
that makes less than $75,000 a year 
needs help right now, they need $1,200 
per adult, $500 per kid, that would be 
$3,400, a one-time payment for a family 
of four. Attach that to this, it would 
pass the floor unanimously in a bipar-
tisan fashion and be picked up by the 
Senate. 
And 
the 
President 
said, 
through his chief of staff, I will sign 
something like that. 
You could do something a little bit 
different. We are all having our schools 
open right now all across the country. 
My friends passed $100 billion in the 
HEROES Act for it. The President said, 
actually, we think it would take about 
$105 billion. Put that on this and help 
every school district in America. But 
my friends chose not to do that, but if 
you do, it will pass here, it will pass 
the Senate, and the President would 
sign it. 
Let’s talk about unemployment. The 
President said, hey, we think the $600 
extra is a little high, but while we are 
negotiating, by the way, we will keep 
paying it. My friends on the other side 
said, no, they can do without the $600. 
And then the President said, well, we 
think $200 is the right number, but we 
can go to $400. Put that on here. Every 
unemployed person in America would 
get $400 a week. Right now, thanks to 
the Speaker and the minority leader in 
the United States Senate, they are get-
ting zero. The only help they are get-
ting is from the President who is using 
Herculean executive orders to try and 
get them some additional relief. 
So this is a joke. This is, as my 
friend the distinguished Member from 
Georgia said, a theatrical moment 
punctuating the two conventions, the 
Democratic Convention and leading 
into ours. No legislation is going to 
happen because my friends aren’t seri-
ous about legislation. 
No money is going to get to the post 
office because it can’t pass the Senate, 
and the post office doesn’t need it any-
way. So we are going to have an enter-
taining couple of hours. Fortunately, it 
is on a Saturday morning, so I don’t 
think very many Americans are going 
to waste their time listening to this. 
When my friends want to get serious, 
when they want to negotiate, when 
they want to move something to the 
floor, we will be ready. 
With that, Madam Speaker, I urge re-
jection to the rule and rejection of the 
bill. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, I would love to 
spend weeks and weeks discussing this 
in committee, but the truth is that is 
what the Trump administration wants, 
to run out the clock before the Novem-
ber elections. So trust in our democ-
racy is undermined, and they can act 
like there is some conspiracy if he 
loses. 
I have heard my friends on the other 
side of the aisle talk about process, but 
I really question their judgment here. 
They thought that dealing with cheese 
was such a national emergency last 
Congress that they used emergency 
powers to bring a bill on that topic to 
the floor during a government shut-
down no less. 
But today, as seniors can’t get life-
saving medications and our veterans 
can’t get social security checks, they 
want to hit pause. Our Postal Service 
is in chaos. Give me a break. 
You know, my friends say they don’t 
know who the Postmaster General is.

H4263 
August 22, 2020 
Let me tell you who he is. He is like 
the least qualified candidate for the 
job. He is a big, mega donor to Donald 
Trump. And my Republican friends are 
believing everything Mr. DeJoy says, 
like claiming there is no mail shut-
down. 
Well, let me remind them what the 
Postmaster General wrote in a recent 
memo that these changes have had: 
‘‘Unintended consequences that have 
impacted our overall service levels.’’ 
Those are his words, Madam Speaker. 
He is transforming the Postal Service 
all right. Transforming it from reliable 
to chaotic right before an election. So 
even if you trust Mr. DeJoy, which I do 
not, even he acknowledges that there is 
something happening here. 
Those on the other side of the aisle 
cannot have it both ways here. This ad-
ministration apparently won’t lift a 
finger to fix this problem, but this Con-
gress is acting. And I would respect-
fully urge my colleagues on the other 
side of the aisle to join us. Help the 
American people. They should be your 
priority, not the guy in the White 
House. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 11⁄2 minutes 
to the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. 
JACKSON LEE). 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, 
I rise with a sense of urgency. I rise be-
cause the Postal Service is near col-
lapse. I rise in the name of Army Ser-
geant Retired Boudreau, stage 4 can-
cer, and Katy, stage 4 breast cancer. 
These are the desperate people that are 
feeling the brunt of a collapsed Postal 
Service. The voices I listen to are the 
letter carriers who are denied the abil-
ity to deliver mail, or the postal work-
ers who have no machines to deliver 
mail. 
H.R. 8015 is an emergency SOS act, 
Delivering for America. It is crucial 
that we meet today, not because we are 
political, because we had to get here as 
fast as we could to be able to acknowl-
edge that the Postal Service is a cru-
cial lifeline for Americans. 
Madam Speaker, I submitted an 
amendment. I am glad that the Rules 
Committee moved on a closed rule. 
This is an emergency. Later on today, 
I will introduce Protecting Democracy 
by Securing the Right to Vote, that 
will allow you to request ballots on-
line, by phone, or mail, and most im-
portantly, setting a 10-business-day 
mail return time for ballots sent by 
mail and are postmarked on election 
day. 
Why? 
Because as we are working today to 
ensure that mail ballots are safe and 
secure under H.R. 8015, we have seniors 
who are listening to the scare tactics 
that are being said from the highest of-
fice in the land. They are frightened. 
Yesterday, I was at the house of a 
blind senior citizen, she can’t get out 
to vote, she will have to do a mail bal-
lot. 
So I rise enthusiastically to support 
the H.R. 8015 rule because we are in a 
collapse of the postal system. It is ur-
gent. We need $25 billion, and we need 
to do it now. I ask my colleagues to 
support it, and let it be bipartisan. 
Madam Speaker, I rise to speak on the Rule 
for H.R. 8015, the Delivering For America Act. 
I thank Chairman MCGOVERN for the work of 
the Rules Committee to bring this important 
measure to the Floor of the House for consid-
eration. 
I also thank Chairwoman MALONEY for her 
leadership in drafting H.R. 8015, which is 
being debated under the Rule. 
I offered an Amendment to improve this 
very good bill, but it was not included in the 
Rule for H.R. 8015. 
The Jackson Lee Amendment, if it had been 
included would have ensured that ballots post-
marked on or before Election Day would have 
ten business days following that date to be de-
livered by the Postal Service to local elections 
officials to have it counted for the election. 
I offered this amendment out of consider-
ation for the nearness of the election and the 
likelihood that the U.S. Postmaster will not 
change the policies that have led to the de-
commissioning of mail sorters and mailboxes, 
which is slowing down the U.S. Mail. 
The job of the United States Postal Service 
is to receive, process, and deliver the mail 
without favor or special consideration to any-
one. 
I applaud the work done in the underlying 
bill to provide relief to the Postal Service, and 
I appreciate the desire to narrowly focus the 
bill only on addressing the issues arising out 
of intentional efforts to disrupt mail service. 
I believe that we must be more aggressive 
in our approach to protect the election and 
make sure that Election Day does not become 
a victim of COVID–19. 
I will work with my colleagues to ensure that 
all available means are provided to ensure 
that every voter, no matter their party or pref-
erence has access to cast a vote that will be 
counted in the November election. 
I support the Rule for this bill because it 
provides much-needed protection to postal 
workers and relief for those who are depend-
ent on the mail service for sustaining life and 
health as well as commercial needs and busi-
ness. 
In 2019, the Postal Service: 
Delivered 142.6 billion pieces of mail to 260 
million addresses in America; 
Delivered 1.2 billion prescriptions, including 
most of the medications ordered by the VA; 
Employed 633,108 of our friends and neigh-
bors, including more than 100,000 veterans; 
Served 70 percent of businesses with fewer 
than ten employees; 
Had a 90 percent favorabilty rating, making 
it the most popular federal agency. 
The Postal Service: 
Is often the only delivery option for rural 
America where service is not profitable; 
Delivers 48 percent of the world’s mail with 
one of the world’s largest civilian vehicle 
fleets; 
Is a vital service for the more than 18 million 
seniors who do not use the Internet. 
The Postal Service has become a pharmacy 
of choice for millions of Americans who live in 
pharmacy deserts—locations where there are 
no pharmacies to serve communities. 
The Postal Service is an essential compo-
nent to Veterans’ health because they deliver 
medicines to our veterans. 
The VA has now confirmed to us that the 
United States Postal Service (USPS), which is 
responsible for delivering about 90 percent of 
all VA mail order prescriptions, has indeed 
been delayed in delivering these critical medi-
cations by an average of almost 25 percent 
over the past year, with many locations experi-
encing much more significant delays. 
Under the urgent need to fix the postal serv-
ice, we must not forget that the Postal Service 
employees are essential workers in COVID– 
19, and if they are essential it means that the 
work they do is essential. 
In addition to delivering prescriptions and 
business mail, they are also delivering democ-
racy to millions of voters who will need to cast 
their ballot by mail this election year to reduce 
their risk of contracting COVID–19. 
The U.S. mail service has provided essen-
tial mail service for absentee voting for well 
over 100 years by enabling Union troops to 
vote during the Civil War, World War I, World 
War II, Korean War, Vietnam War, Iraqi Free-
dom, and to this day. 
Since that time, absentee or not, in-person 
voting has grown in popularity across the 
United States and is now a welcomed and val-
ued component for assuring citizen participa-
tion in public elections. 
In 2016, 20.9 percent of all votes cast in 
that federal election were done so by absen-
tee ballots and this year that number is ex-
pected to be much higher due to COVID–19. 
The attack on the viability and value of ab-
sentee voting should be viewed as just one 
component of many assaults on our elections 
system that may make this a very difficult 
election year. 
This view is shaped by the decades of elec-
tions filled with disinformation and misinforma-
tion tactics designed to suppress or repress 
black, LatinX, and young voters from voting or 
having their votes counted. 
For these reasons, I urge my colleagues to 
join me in voting in support of the Rule for 
H.R. 8015. 
Mr. WOODALL. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from 
Texas (Mr. BURGESS), a member of the 
Rules Committee and the Energy and 
Commerce Committee. 
Mr. BURGESS. Madam Speaker, this 
bill, H.R. 8015, does seem to be rushed. 
And here is the biggest thing, it is not 
going to address the core problem that 
exists in the United States Postal 
Service. 
This bill appropriates a $25 billion 
bailout using emergency supplemental 
funding, removing it from the pre-
viously agreed to bipartisan budget 
agreement numbers, and prohibits the 
Postal Service from making any re-
forms until next year at the earliest. 
So if this bill is intended to improve 
efficiency or effectiveness of the Postal 
Service, I would just simply ask: How 
in the world is it supposed to do that if 
it is prohibited from making any 
changes? 
The Postal Service is in trouble, 
every Member of this Chamber, Repub-
lican or Democrat, understands this. 
We should be deeply concerned about 
the precarious position of the Postal 
Service. But despite the narratives, 
this problem has been decades in the 
making. 
The 
Postal 
Service’s 
operational 
pains have been festering literally for

decades. Since 2007 mail volumes have 
fallen year after year as American con-
sumers and businesses have chosen dig-
ital communication over letters and 
mailed advertising. Over the same pe-
riod, the number of addresses requiring 
delivery and retirement obligations for 
retired Postal Service employees have 
continued to grow. So in very simple 
terms, revenues have fallen, and costs 
have risen for over a decade. 
b 1100 
This novel coronavirus’ impact on 
the economy is only exacerbating this 
situation. The Postal Service lost $2.2 
billion in the second quarter of this 
year. H.R. 8015 kicks the can down the 
road and forces the Postal Service to 
continue to sustain financial losses. No 
reforms to modernize the Postal Serv-
ice, so we should expect its fiscal 
health to worsen. 
Now, in spite of all the heated rhet-
oric today, the Postal Service will not 
collapse tonight. The Postal Service 
has informed Congress that it has 
enough cash on hand to remain solvent 
through August 2021. That is a year 
from now if you are doing the math at 
home. And Congress has already pro-
vided an additional lifeline by raising 
the Postal Service’s loan authority by 
$10 billion. 
Instead of voting on this rushed and 
partisan bill, Members of this Chamber 
could work together to solve the prob-
lem. 
Congress 
has 
time 
to 
work 
through the proper committees, pro-
vide the proper oversight, provide the 
proper reforms, and preserve this es-
sential service. 
Let’s vote against this bill today, a 
dictatorial bill brought to us by the 
Speaker of the House, H.R. 8015, and 
work together in finding a meaningful 
and lasting fix for the United States 
Postal Service. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I 
have heard some of the Republicans 
clamor last night in the Rules Com-
mittee all about statistics. 
Well, let’s look at some. This is from 
the Postal Service’s most recent quar-
terly report. It compares on-time deliv-
ery for single-piece first-class mail this 
fiscal year so far as compared to last 
fiscal year. Do you see the red line? It 
is going in the wrong direction. Mail is 
slowing. People aren’t getting deliv-
eries that they need on time. This is 
just through the end of June. We don’t 
know what truly happened in July or 
so far in August. 
Our constituents are not lying to us. 
Their mail is delayed. Their medica-
tions are delayed. 
Yesterday, we were told: You know, 
people who are on Social Security 
don’t have to worry because they get 
all their Social Security checks elec-
tronically. We know that is not true. 
We know that close to 1 million people 
get Social Security and SSI through 
the mail. 
So, this is real. This is happening. 
And we need to do something about it. 
The fact that this is happening in the 
middle of a pandemic right before an 
election, I mean, I don’t believe in co-
incidences. This is deliberate, and it is 
shocking. As I said before, this is a 
five-alarm fire on our democracy. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 11⁄2 minutes 
to the gentlewoman from Pennsylvania 
(Ms. SCANLON), a distinguished member 
of the Rules Committee. 
Ms. SCANLON. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman for yielding. 
Madam Speaker, I include in the 
RECORD an article, ‘‘Quit Interfering 
and Save the Postal Service,’’ by the 
former chair of the Board of Governors 
of the Postal Service, David Fineman. 
[Aug. 5, 2020] 
QUIT INTERFERING AND SAVE THE POSTAL 
SERVICE 
(By S. David Fineman) 
The U.S. Postal Service is in trouble and 
needs help just like the airlines, large and 
small corporations, and consumers. There 
are ways to save it if Congress takes action 
very soon. 
Where to start with its problems? The 
USPS is losing billions because of the pan-
demic. Its leadership has said running out of 
money is a question of when, not if. Its board 
of governors temporarily lost its quorum 
this year and is now made up only of Trump 
administration appointees. The president of 
the United States called the Postal Service a 
‘‘joke.’’ And now state election officials are 
warning that reduced mail service could 
interfere with mail-in ballots in November. 
I served as a governor of the United States 
Postal Service from 1995 through 2005. I was 
nominated by President Bill Clinton, and 
served as chairman during the administra-
tion of President George W. Bush. By law, 
the USPS should have nine members on its 
board, five of one party and four of another. 
During my tenure, there was never any in-
terference by the president in the business of 
the USPS, like there is currently. 
What is happening now is unprecedented, 
and we wonder why. Let us hope it is not to 
disturb the election process and mail-in bal-
lots. 
During my first year on the board, it be-
came clear the rate-making process, which 
decides how much one pays to mail a letter 
or a package, made no sense. Not until 2004 
was there movement on any legislation in 
Congress. Eventually the chairman of the 
committee overseeing the Postal Service, 
Dan Burton (R-Ind.), and the ranking mem-
ber, Henry Waxman (D-Calif.), agreed on the 
outline of a bill. The blll, with a few changes, 
passed the House of Representatives, the 
Senate, and then was signed into law by 
Bush in 2006. 
One section of that legislation called for 
the USPS to prefund its pension obligations 
for 75 years. I remember meeting with the 
then-postmaster general, and after a thor-
ough briefing, we both concluded the USPS 
would never have the necessary funds to and 
maybe naivety, I believed congress would 
amend the law in due time to eliminate that 
burden. 
So here we are in 2020, in the middle of a 
pandemic. Congress and the administration 
cannot agree on how to fix the USPS. Every-
one in the so-called postal community, 
ihcluding its unions, agree the prefunding re-
quirement is not needed. Let us get legisla-
tion to eliminate the prefundlng require-
ment passed. 
What else can be done? First, let us stop 
the parochial mindset of Congress. The 
USPS has needed to right-size for some time, 
and not just close post offices. Because of 
population shifts, it can consolidate large 
processing plants, so they can process mail 
from various states and municipalities. 
Last week, Treasury released $10 billion al-
ready allocated to the USPS, with conditions 
that are at best questionable. It was required 
to share with Treasury details of contracts it 
negotiated with Amazon and others. Con-
gress should allocate without any condi-
tions, just like it has bailed out multi-
national corporations as a result of the pan-
demic. 
If we believe what we hear from the admin-
istration and the postmaster general they 
seem to have two solutions: First, raise the 
price of packages, although the rate-making 
process has confirmed the prices set were 
fair, and within the confines of the law. Sec-
ond, cut the pay of the unionized workforce, 
which has already suffered thousands of 
coronavirus illnesses and, at last count, at 
least 60 deaths. 
If the price of packages is raised, who 
pays? The consumer and small businesses, 
not just on packages sent by USPS, but by 
every private delivery service. That is the re-
ality of how business works, and to deny it is 
not dealing with reality. 
As USPS raises its prices, you can be as-
sured that the private delivery services will 
raise their prices. Considering the present 
composition of Congress, the provisions of 
the law regarding how union contracts are 
negotiated ls not about to change. 
With the pandemic, the USPS is needed 
more than ever before. Small businesses and 
the average American rely on delivery of 
mail six days a week. They need to get their 
checks, their letters, and packages, on time. 
The USPS needs help! There is a way to fix 
it! 
The administration must stop holding the 
USPS hostage to its own private agenda. 
Rural America and the inner city population 
would suffer more than anyone else. The so-
lutions are clear. Let us just get it done. 
Ms. SCANLON. Madam Speaker, ‘‘I’m 
writing to you today after having 
skipped a day of my high blood pres-
sure medication for the first time.’’ 
‘‘I have not seen a Postal Service car-
rier in my neighborhood for a week or 
more, not received mail for 10 days. 
The last couple pieces of mail were 30 
days late.’’ 
‘‘I am a small business owner. I am in 
a real bind. I usually ship packages to 
customers. Switching to UPS or FedEx 
would be too expensive. I would likely 
lose customers.’’ 
These are just a few of the thousands 
of messages that my office has received 
from 
constituents 
who 
have 
been 
caught in the crosshairs of this admin-
istration’s war on the U.S. Postal Serv-
ice. 
We are here today to deliver a mes-
sage to this administration: Don’t mess 
with the USPS. 
This vital public service is essential 
in our everyday lives. In a pandemic, it 
is a lifeline. 
These are the real consequences of 
this administration’s ill-conceived effi-
ciency measures, which have disrupted 
postal service across the country. 
Those consequences have made their 
way to the doorsteps of seniors, vet-
erans, people with disabilities, and 
countless families and businesses, large 
and small. 
As millions of Americans are ex-
pected to vote by mail, many for the 
first time, we need to give Americans 
the peace of mind that their mail will

proud to support the Delivering for 
America Act. 
Mr. WOODALL. Madam Speaker, I 
say to my friend from Pennsylvania, I 
want to solve every single one of those 
problems that she just laid out. Those 
are absolutely 
bipartisan concerns. 
This bill solves none of them. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to 
the gentlewoman from Arizona (Mrs. 
LESKO), another member of the Rules 
Committee. 
Mrs. LESKO. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman for yielding. 
‘‘Nancy Pelosi Goes Politically Post-
al.’’ That’s the catchy title of a recent 
op-ed written by The Wall Street Jour-
nal editorial board, and that is the rea-
son we are here today, for phony polit-
ical theater to once again bash Presi-
dent Trump just in time for the Sun-
day talk shows and the Republican Na-
tional Convention. And just like all the 
other times, the media will lap it right 
up. 
Wouldn’t it be nice if we were here 
today on a Saturday voting on a nego-
tiated COVID relief package to help 
the American people that could actu-
ally be signed into law? But sadly, in-
stead, we are here talking about a post-
al bill, one The Wall Street Journal 
editorial board called a ‘‘made-for-TV 
phony political crisis.’’ Boy, did they 
get that right. 
Let’s review the facts. 
A task force recommends that the 
U.S. Postal Service overhaul their 
business model in order to return it to 
sustainability because expenses have 
outpaced revenue for 13 straight years, 
and they lost $8.8 billion in 2019 alone. 
The 
new 
Postmaster 
General 
is 
unanimously selected by a bipartisan 
Board of Governors, not President 
Trump. The Postmaster General starts 
making some changes in an attempt to 
make the post office more sustainable, 
as recommended by the task force—you 
know, similar to the types of changes 
that were made under the Obama ad-
ministration in the past. 
The Postmaster General worries that 
some States allow voters to request 
mail-in ballots too close to the election 
day and is afraid that there is not 
enough turnaround time for those bal-
lots to get back in time, so he sends a 
courtesy letter to those States, recom-
mending they tell voters to mail in 
their ballots early so they can get 
them in time. 
Guess what? Democrats freak out, 
blame Trump, say he is trying to influ-
ence the election, even though Trump 
doesn’t have control over the Post-
master General, and run to the ever-so- 
willing media to spread a new Trump 
conspiracy theory. 
Seems insane but all too typical for 
the Trump-hating Democrats to me. 
But don’t take my word for it, let’s 
see what Stephen Kearney, a 33-year 
veteran employee, former Treasurer, 
and Senior Vice President of the U.S. 
Postal Service said: ‘‘This conspiracy 
theory is the most far-flung thing I 
think I have ever heard.’’ 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, let 
me just say again for the RECORD be-
cause we hear this on the other side: 
Wouldn’t it be nice if we were here ne-
gotiating a larger package on a whole 
range of things. Well, we actually 
passed something in the House called 
the HEROES Act. The Senate has 
passed nothing. The reason why is be-
cause Republicans are fighting with 
Republicans. They can’t agree on what 
to do, so they have done nothing. So, 
we are negotiating with an empty 
chair. 
If my friends really want to help, 
they ought to pick up the phone, and 
they ought to call MITCH MCCONNELL 
and tell him to do something, to actu-
ally do something. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to 
the gentlewoman from Connecticut 
(Ms. DELAURO). 
Ms. DELAURO. Madam Speaker, mail 
is an essential government service and 
a critical lifeline for many, especially 
during this pandemic. 
What have operational changes made 
to the postal system accomplished? 
Parts of the country are having their 
mail delayed by up to a week or more. 
This is harming veterans, seniors, and 
our rural communities. 
What has the Postmaster General al-
ready done? Curtailed overtime; re-
stricted deliveries; eliminated sorting 
machines; in Hartford, Connecticut, in 
the parking lot there is a dismantled 
machine; removed mailboxes; prohib-
iting employees from making late mail 
deliveries, directing them to leave mail 
undelivered 
at 
distribution 
centers 
overnight; warned 46 States and the 
District of Columbia that it could not 
guarantee all ballots cast by mail for 
the November election will arrive in 
time to be counted. 
Yes, this is about our democracy, as 
well. This administration is under-
mining a pillar of our democracy, vot-
ing for a partisan purpose. Obstructing 
the Postal Service for political pur-
poses is illegal. It is illegal to interfere 
with the mail. 
During this unprecedented time, we 
must be streamlining, not sabotaging, 
voting by mail. 
The administration wants to destroy 
the public’s faith and trust in the pub-
lic service. No, the American people 
are not going to let you do it. I might 
add, the Postal Service has a 90 percent 
favorability rating. It is the most pop-
ular Federal agency. Would that we 
had a 90 percent favorability rating. 
We must fight for this essential com-
ponent of our democracy and of peo-
ple’s lives. We will, through rain, shine, 
or sleet, or President Donald Trump. 
Mr. WOODALL. Madam Speaker I 
yield 1 minute to the gentleman from 
Arkansas (Mr. WOMACK), the ranking 
member of one of the committees that 
is near and dear to my heart, the rank-
ing member of the Budget Committee, 
a good friend, and a member of the 
freshman class of 2010. 
Mr. WOMACK. Madam Speaker, I 
thank my friend ROB
WOODALL
for 
yielding. 
When I was a kid, I couldn’t wait for 
Saturday morning. Saturday morning 
in our house, my brothers and sisters, 
we would get up, and we couldn’t wait 
to watch our favorite cartoons. 
Now, decades later, here I am again, 
on the floor of the House of Represent-
atives, watching a cartoon about the 
only outcome this debate is going to 
have 
today: 
one 
of 
entertainment 
value, nothing substantive. 
The chairman of the Rules Com-
mittee called this a five-alarm fire. 
Now that the Democratic Convention 
has concluded and the Republican Con-
vention is about to begin, we have a ca-
tastrophe. 
It is not going to build infrastruc-
ture. It is not going to give aid to peo-
ple suffering from the pandemic. It is 
not going to fund the government by 
October 1. It is not going to become 
law. 
Just like the previous attempts, my 
friends on the other side of the aisle 
have had to derail a duly-elected Presi-
dent. This, too, will fail. I urge a ‘‘no’’ 
vote. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I 
am sad that the gentleman thinks this 
is entertaining. We have veterans who 
are calling our offices whose medica-
tions have been delayed getting to 
them. We have some people on Social 
Security and on SSI who are worried 
that their checks are not going to get 
to them. We have small businesses that 
are calling to complain. 
This is a crisis that this administra-
tion produced all on its own. And 
whether it is designed, as some of us 
fear, to try to create more chaos 
around the election—and by the way, 
this is what Donald Trump said about 
the money that we have in this bill: 
‘‘They need that money in order to 
have the post office work so it can take 
all of these millions and millions of 
ballots.’’ 
Did anybody ever think that they 
would see a President of the United 
States who would publicly say that he 
doesn’t want every vote to count? This 
is outrageous, and I cannot believe 
that my friends on the other side of the 
aisle, who I know are getting the same 
calls we are, are totally fine with doing 
nothing. 
b 1115 
Well, maybe if some of my Repub-
lican friends would join with us, it 
might send a message to the White 
House that they have to respond, they 
have to do the right thing. 
It is the complicity; it is the indiffer-
ence that I just can’t understand given 
what is going on in this country right 
now. 
So we have been complaining about 
this for weeks—this didn’t just happen 
this week, but for weeks—but it is now 
out of control, and we have to do some-
thing. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to 
the gentlewoman from California (Ms. 
MATSUI), a distinguished member of the 
Rules Committee.

H4266 
August 22, 2020 
Ms. MATSUI. Madam Speaker, over 
the past few weeks, we have seen the 
reports of decommissioned sorting ma-
chines, removal of postboxes, and the 
cutting back of hours for the U.S. Post-
al Service employees. 
In my district of Sacramento, I have 
never seen such an outcry, an outrage 
amongst my neighbors and constitu-
ents. 
This is serious business. We are feel-
ing the effects of delayed mail delivery 
and seeing the real-life consequences of 
these operational changes: Financial 
documents are late; prescriptions are 
stuck in transit; and we worry about 
our future ballots being counted. 
That is why this administration’s at-
tacks have alarmed so many Ameri-
cans. We recognize it is about more 
than just getting letters from A to B. 
It is about the fabric of our democracy. 
The Postmaster General has made 
his political preferences and business 
interests no secret. The U.S. Postal 
Service should not be manipulated as a 
political or business tool. 
Hundreds of millions of Americans 
across this country rely on the Postal 
Service for lifesaving medications, So-
cial Security benefits, paychecks, and 
mail-in ballots. The Delivering for 
America Act will help ensure that 
those services continue as needed. 
This bill takes critical steps to halt 
the damage being done, while providing 
$25 billion to put the Postal Service 
back on track. 
While the Postmaster has recently 
claimed that he will halt operational 
changes until after the election, he has 
also stated he has no intention of re-
commissioning sorting machines and 
postboxes that have already been shut-
tered. The damage has already been 
done, and it is unacceptable. 
We must pass the Delivering for 
America Act to provide emergency 
funding and put protections in place to 
support reliable mail delivery for all 
Americans. 
As I said, this is serious business. The 
post office is important for the fabric 
of America. 
Mr. 
WOODALL. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
though this bill is going nowhere, if we 
defeat the previous question this morn-
ing, I will offer an amendment to take 
up three bills that are partnership bills 
that can go through the Senate to the 
President’s desk and make a real dif-
ference for the American people, deal-
ing 
with 
important 
issues 
like 
healthcare, like relief for folks suf-
fering from the COVID economic crisis, 
and our law enforcement reform activi-
ties. 
Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous 
consent to insert the text of my 
amendment 
in 
the 
RECORD
imme-
diately prior to the vote on the pre-
vious question. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Georgia? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. WOODALL. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from 
Texas (Mr. BURGESS) to speak on one of 
those provisions. 
Mr. BURGESS. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman for yielding. 
There is a sudden sense of urgency to 
address the financial stability of the 
Postal Service, but I would simply ask 
the body: Where was the sense of ur-
gency from our House Democratic lead-
ership at the start of the pandemic? 
Look, I recognized in January this 
deal over in China was a bad deal, a 
novel virus, biological behavior not 
known, not worked out. 
The Postal Service’s problems did 
not surface this week. They have been 
going on for years. But the Postal 
Service will not go bankrupt tomor-
row, and yet we have been called back 
here to vote on an issue that, quite 
frankly, is not going to get solved from 
today’s activities. 
But I called on the Committee on En-
ergy and Commerce last February to 
do hearings on this novel coronavirus. 
My requests were ignored and then sub-
sequently dismissed because we had 
other important work to do: horse rac-
ing, flavored tobacco, ticket stubs— 
any number of things—other than work 
on the novel coronavirus. 
But we could have provided support 
in the form of funding for vaccines and 
testing and more. We have done some 
of that in the short-term sense, but we 
could continue to support our Nation’s 
pandemic response in additional ways, 
which is why I have introduced legisla-
tion that aligns with the legislation al-
ready existing in the Senate, where we 
could come together and provide our 
country with some of the critical re-
sources necessary to fight this novel 
coronavirus. 
Unfortunately, the House Democratic 
leadership does not acknowledge or 
seem even to be curious as to whether 
or not they are up to the task. 
So this legislation provides $29 bil-
lion for the Public Health and Social 
Services Emergency Fund to develop 
additional 
medical 
countermeasures 
and vaccines. A safe and effective vac-
cine is the strongest arrow in our quiv-
er to help society return to normal. 
Importantly, the bill would provide 
$2 billion for the Strategic National 
Stockpile and $2 billion for the Bio-
medical Advanced Research and Devel-
opment Authority for use in developing 
medical countermeasures. 
But you have to ask yourself: The 
business plan as promulgated by the 
Speaker of this body, why is it anti-
thetical to that development? Could it 
be because the nominee of their party 
this week in a very important speech 
promised the American people ‘‘no mir-
acle is coming’’? Is that because you 
are going to cut off the funding for 
BARDA? for the Strategic National 
Stockpile? for research on vaccines? 
Look, there are commonsense, bipar-
tisan ways to help our Nation and help 
our Nation respond to the coronavirus, 
but House Democratic leadership has 
turned their backs on the needs of 
America. 
Madam Speaker, I urge Members to 
vote against the previous question. 
Allow us to debate and pass this meas-
ure. It is of critical urgency. Indeed, a 
miracle could be coming. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I 
insert in the RECORD a CNBC article, 
entitled, ‘‘Patients Say Post Office 
Slowdown Is Delaying Delivery of Life-
saving Medications.’’ 
PATIENTS SAY POST OFFICE SLOWDOWN IS DE-
LAYING DELIVERY OF LIFE-SAVING MEDICA-
TIONS 
(By Christina Farr) 
The U.S. Postal Service has become a po-
litical battleground, and has experienced 
delays 
after 
Postmaster 
General 
Louis 
DeJoy slashed overtime. 
Many patients are experiencing delays re-
ceiving life-saving medications and are shar-
ing their experiences online via hashtags 
like #USPSMeds. 
Experts say the situation could escalate, 
despite Postmaster General Louis DeJoy’s 
promise to suspend changes to the Postal 
Service. 
Nathan Geissel, who lives in rural Oregon, 
has been waiting more than nine days for a 
lifesaving medication to arrive in the mail. 
As far as he knows, it’s stuck in a fulfillment 
center. 
Geissel’s doctor prescribed the medicine 
two years ago to prevent blood clots. He’s 
never experienced delays before. 
The U.S. Postal Service has become a po-
litical battleground after President Trump 
said he opposes additional funding because 
he doesn’t support universal mail-in voting. 
Postmaster General Louis DeJoy, a Trump 
supporter, reportedly ordered recent cost- 
cutting measures, slashing overtime and 
curbing late delivery. It has created signifi-
cant delays in mail deliveries, according to 
mail worker advocates and others. 
Americans are sharing stories about medi-
cation delays with the hashtag #USPSMeds. 
Many are veterans who have reported weeks- 
long delays. Some are seniors who instead 
have to visit a pharmacy, putting them at 
higher risk of exposure to Covid–19. 
Geissel chose mail-order for the conven-
ience—the nearest pharmacy is 20 minutes 
away—and the affordability. His insurance 
company covers more of the cost of the 
medication when it’s delivered by the U.S. 
postal service. Geissel has to pay a $135 
copay for a months supply if he instead picks 
it up at a retail pharmacy. 
‘‘Thankfully, a local pharmacist approved 
two more weeks of medication with my 
health plan that I could pick up as an emer-
gency,’’ said Geissel. ‘‘I work in health care, 
so I know the system, but I can’t imagine 
what it must be like for an elderly patient 
who doesn’t have that same access.’’ 
‘‘I’m worried,’’ said Liz Austin by phone. 
Her mother, Barbara, is sick with cystic fi-
brosis, a progressive disease that causes lung 
infections and limits her ability to breathe. 
‘‘Covid–19 is primarily a respiratory disease, 
so my mother relies on the mail to get her 
prescriptions as safely as possible.’’ 
Her medicine was so late that her husband 
had to risk visiting a pharmacy. 
After lawsuits from more than 20 state at-
torneys general and a call to testify before 
Congress, DeJoy on Tuesday said he’s sus-
pending operational changes until after the 
November election. 
Some experts are concerned that the 
delays will snowball. 
‘‘There’s an exponential factor to this,’’ 
said John McHugh, a former congressman 
who heads up the Package Coalition, an alli-
ance that aims to preserve affordable postal 
package delivery services. Members of the

Package Coalition include Amazon, eBay, 
and Cigna’s Express Scripts. ‘‘Once you are 
behind, what happens next is you get further 
behind and then further behind.’’ 
The pandemic has strained the mail-order 
medication system as more people are opt to 
receive prescriptions at home. Those with 
pre-existing conditions are at greater risk 
for hospitalization if they get Covid–19. 
‘‘Data show an increase in prescription 
drugs dispensed through mail-service phar-
macy during the pandemic,’’ said a spokes-
person from PCMA, a national association 
representing pharmacy benefits managers, 
which negotiate prescription drug costs on 
behalf of insurers. 
Online pharmacy Honeybee Health said 
about 20% of patients who order delivery via 
first-class mail have experienced delays so 
far. 
‘‘The situation is fluid but it’s clear from 
our customer service team that an usually 
high number of patients are receiving their 
medication far later than expected—and in 
some cases, not receiving it at all. These 
delays are troubling for everyone, but for pa-
tients who rely on medication to live, it’s es-
pecially 
dangerous,’’ 
said 
Dr. 
Jessica 
Nouhavandi, co-founder and lead pharmacist 
for Honeybee Health, which delivers generic 
medications via USPS. 
Umar Afridi, founder of TruePill, a com-
pany that provides pharmacy services to 
telemedicine companies, said he ‘‘estimates 
that about 90 percent’’ of prescription drugs 
his company delivers via mail run through 
the postal service. 
‘‘We tend to use UPS and FedEx more for 
time-sensitive and expensive drugs,’’ he said. 
‘‘USPS is often the lowest cost and they 
have the biggest reach.’’ 
Afridi said he hasn’t yet heard about 
delays but knows there are service-level dis-
ruptions, including pickups not happening on 
time. 
Pharmacy benefits managers are more op-
timistic. Express Scripts, a major pharmacy 
benefit manager, said it was ‘‘not experi-
encing unusual delays.’’ OptumRX (owned by 
UnitedHealth Group) declined to discuss 
delays. It said it’s working with all major 
carriers ‘‘to help ensure timely shipments of 
home delivery prescriptions.’’ 
Some doctors are concerned for their low- 
income and elderly patients. Dr. Lakshman 
Swamy, a Boston-based pulmonologist and 
critical care doctor, says the situation could 
be disastrous for asthma patients who rely 
on Medicaid or don’t have insurance. These 
patients might not be able to negotiate an 
emergency supply. 
Swamy, who also has asthma, said it’s 
common for patients with chronic res-
piratory conditions to rely on mail-order 
medications. ‘‘You can do rescue therapies 
for a while, but the strong medications will 
wear off,’’ he said. ‘‘Once you don’t get the 
medications you need, you can quickly fall 
off the wagon and end up hospitalized.’’ 
‘‘Any additional strain will have an impact 
on patients,’’ he said. ‘‘It’s inevitable.’’ 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, I don’t know for 
certain that the Senate will take this 
bill up, but I fervently hope that they 
will, because I sure as hell know that 
we are doing the right thing here in the 
House. 
Madam Speaker, I would also like to 
just point out, because I have heard 
these questions raised about the $25 
billion in this bill for the Postal Serv-
ice: 
Why 
are 
we 
providing 
that 
amount? 
Madam Speaker, because that is 
what the USPS Board of Governors rec-
ommended, and this Board is made up 
of 100 percent of Donald Trump’s ap-
pointees. So, you know, this is not a 
number that Democrats made up. It is 
what his Republican Board of the 
USPS came up with. So that is why 
that number is there. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. WOODALL. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from 
Ohio (Mr. CHABOT), the ranking mem-
ber of the Small Business Committee 
that has made such a difference for so 
many Americans, in support of the pre-
vious question and legislation that we 
could bring to the floor that would 
make a difference to the American peo-
ple. 
Mr. CHABOT. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman for yielding. 
Madam Speaker, there is no doubt 
that the Paycheck Protection Program 
has produced impressive results. All 
across America, PPP loans have sup-
ported over 50 million jobs. That is 50 
million people who can continue to 
support themselves and their loved 
ones. In Ohio’s First Congressional Dis-
trict, for example, which I have the 
honor of representing, the program 
helped over 200,000 people to stay on 
the payroll and support their families. 
Despite this success, there are small 
businesses that still need our help. Ac-
cording to a July 27 NFIB survey, al-
most half of small business borrowers 
predict that they will need additional 
capital within the next 6 months. 
As ranking member of the House 
Small Business Committee, I have 
pushed for targeted bipartisan solu-
tions to make sure that our Nation’s 
smallest firms have a chance to sur-
vive, and this Congress has acted. Now 
it needs to do so again to help those 
small businesses and their employees. 
Unfortunately, the top leadership on 
the other side of the aisle apparently 
doesn’t feel the urgency to do so and 
allow a vote on additional help for 
those small businesses that need it so 
much. 
Let me be clear: Every day that goes 
by without action jeopardizes Amer-
ica’s 30 million small businesses and 
their employees. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to support reopening the Pay-
check Protection Program through De-
cember 31 and allow businesses that 
have suffered revenue declines to apply 
for a second loan. 
Madam Speaker, we owe it to Amer-
ica’s small businesses to work together 
for a solution. We ought to be voting 
on that today. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, it is interesting to 
hear my friend talk about the exten-
sion of PPP when he voted against that 
in the HEROES Act when it came be-
fore the full House. Luckily, it passed 
and it is over in the Senate. We are 
waiting for MITCH MCCONNELL to do 
something. 
But I love my friends on the other 
side of the aisle who come up with all 
these ideas right now. Most of them 
were in the HEROES Act. 
But if these are so important, where 
is MITCH
MCCONNELL? Where is the 
United States Senate? They went on 
vacation. They are gone. 
We are here because we have a crisis. 
We have people who can’t get their 
medications, who can’t get their ben-
efit checks. We have a crisis where we 
have a President who is trying to un-
dermine our elections. So we are here 
doing our work. 
Where is MITCH MCCONNELL? Where is 
the Senate? How about picking up the 
phone and calling them to come back 
and do something for the American 
people? 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. 
WOODALL. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
again, if we defeat the previous ques-
tion, we will bring much-needed legis-
lation to the floor. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to 
the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. 
STAUBER), a rising star here in the Re-
publican Conference, to talk about 
that. 
Mr. STAUBER. Madam Speaker, it 
has been 22 days since the last time 
this body has met, and in those 22 days 
that the Speaker has refused to work 
on real relief packages, people have 
lost their jobs, small businesses have 
closed, and Main Streets have suffered. 
The American people were left with the 
question: Where are our leaders? 
I have begged, the President has 
begged, and the Senate has begged: 
Please call the House back into session 
to work on a bill to help suffering 
Americans. 
Now we are back in Washington for 
less than 12 hours. It is embarrassing 
that, while we could be working on 
vaccine funding, saving small busi-
nesses, and justice reform, the Speaker 
will gavel us out and Americans will 
once again be wondering: Where are 
our leaders? 
I introduced legislation that will 
fund better training for police officers, 
increase the number of body cameras, 
and fund important grants to police de-
partments that help with community 
policing, which builds trust and lasting 
relationships in the communities they 
serve. 
It has been 89 days since George 
Floyd’s tragic death, and in those 89 
days, Senator TIM SCOTT and I have put 
forth legislation to fix and improve our 
policing. We have begged Democrat 
leadership to come to the table and ad-
dress this issue that Americans and our 
communities have asked for. 
Yet, what do we get? Twelve hours in 
Washington, D.C., and no action on 
vaccine funding, no action on small 
business relief, and no action on police 
reform. 
Madam Speaker, I urge defeat of the

this important bill and get Congress 
back to work, because a Congress at 
work is America at work. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself 30 seconds. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
the 
gentleman 
asked: Where are the leaders? We are 
here. We are doing our job. We are re-
sponding to a crisis. 
Where is MITCH MCCONNELL? On vaca-
tion. 
Where is the President? Tweeting 
more insults. 
But we are here doing our job to help 
deal with this postal crisis, and we also 
did our job when we passed the HE-
ROES Act. 
Where is MITCH MCCONNELL? On vaca-
tion. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. WOODALL. Madam Speaker, I 
would like to share with my friend, the 
chairman, that I have no further 
speakers remaining, and I am prepared 
to close when he is. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I 
am prepared to close. 
b 1130 
Mr. WOODALL. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself the balance of my time. 
Madam Speaker, I don’t know how 
many more times I will be on the 
House floor between now and the end of 
the year. It is a great honor I have to 
serve with the chairman of the Rules 
Committee, Mr. MCGOVERN of Massa-
chusetts. I think all the time about all 
the things we could do together; and, 
candidly, we have done a lot of great 
things together. This body, when it 
acts together, does amazing things. 
But an unfortunate thing has hap-
pened in politics these days, Madam 
Speaker. We talk more about the bills 
that we pass than the changes that we 
make. My friend from Massachusetts 
has talked time and time again about a 
unilaterally drafted bill passed by this 
House in the spring that purports to 
address families in need, but that in-
cluded no Republican input, no part-
nership, had a veto message from the 
President, and had no chance of getting 
through the Senate. 
We are here on exactly that same ex-
ercise today with this manufactured 
Postal Service bill. The Postal Service 
has the money that it needs. I will just 
tell my friends that President Trump 
won the mail-in vote in the great State 
of Georgia. That year I won the mail-in 
vote 2–1. There is absolutely no effort 
at voter suppression here. As my friend 
from Connecticut pointed out earlier, 
that is illegal. That is off the table. 
We 
are 
talking 
about, 
Is 
there 
enough money to fund the Postal Serv-
ice or not? 
My friend from Massachusetts ref-
erences a supervisor’s report from the 
spring when they thought mail deliv-
ery was going to go down in volume. In 
fact, it has gone up in volume. Reve-
nues are higher than they expected. If 
the Postal Service faces a revenue 
shortfall, I commit to my colleagues 
we will be there together arm in arm to 
make that happen. But today, when 
the Postal Service is sitting on $15 bil-
lion in cash and an unused $10 billion 
line of credit, a blank check of another 
$25 billion does not solve any of the 
challenges that you and I know exist or 
solve any of the problems that all of 
our constituents have. 
Madam Speaker, the frustration you 
hear from my colleagues on this side of 
the aisle is that we are back in an 
emergency session working on lan-
guage that is going nowhere, that will 
help no one. We can pound on our 
chests all we like about all the wonder-
ful things that we think—unilaterally 
by themselves, without any bipartisan 
input—Democrats crafted and put in 
this bill. But we all know from year 
upon year upon year of painful experi-
ence, the only things that get done in 
this town get done together. In a di-
vided government you cannot bully 
your way to success, Madam Speaker, 
you have to partner your way to suc-
cess. 
I know my friend from Massachusetts 
believes that. That is the kind of lead-
ership style he brings to the committee 
on which I have the honor of serving. I 
understand my friends have a job to do 
today. They need to pass this bill. They 
are going to do it. It is not going to go 
anywhere, but they are going to do it. 
Madam Speaker, defeat the previous 
question with me today. Let’s move 
PPP extension, let’s move vaccine 
funding, let’s move law enforcement 
reform, and let’s do the political exer-
cise that you brought us here to do. 
But let’s do these things that matter as 
well. 
Madam Speaker, I urge defeat of the 
previous question, and if not that, de-
feat of the rule. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself the balance of my time. 
Madam Speaker, I have great respect 
for my colleagues on the other side of 
the aisle which makes me especially 
sad to hear some of the comments that 
we heard here today. 
This is a crisis that we are currently 
facing. We are getting calls from vet-
erans whose medications are being de-
layed in the mail. We are getting calls 
from others whose essential benefits 
are being delayed in the mail. People 
rely on this stuff. It is important. 
Madam Speaker, you have heard the 
testimonies that have been recounted 
here on our side of the aisle. 
This is an emergency, and on top of 
that, we have a President who does not 
want every vote counted in the upcom-
ing election because he believes that if 
we do count every vote, he will lose. 
We are in the middle of a pandemic. 
More and more people are going to be 
voting by mail, and this President, 
rather than trying to make it easier 
for people to vote and to have their 
voices be counted, is trying to make it 
more difficult. 
The current Postmaster General is 
not interested in reforming the Post 
Office. He is interested in dismantling 
it. That is what he has been doing. 
The bill that is before us is about 
more than money, I would say to my 
colleague from Georgia. It is about 
undoing all the damage that the cur-
rent Postmaster has put into place 
that is resulting in all these delays, all 
this confusion, and all this chaos. 
Come on. This is serious business. 
I am going to close with this. History 
is not going to look well on those who 
just went along to get along with this 
President while he has done some 
things that would have been unthink-
able in any other administration, Dem-
ocrat or Republican. The complicity 
and the indifference are shocking to 
me. I can’t believe it sometimes when I 
hear people defend the indefensible. 
What the President is doing with the 
Postal Service is indefensible, and ev-
erybody needs to be counted on this 
issue. I ask my Democratic colleagues 
and I ask my Republican colleagues to 
support this bill. It is the right thing 
to do for your constituents. Even if the 
man in the White House doesn’t want 
it, it is the right thing to do. It is 
about time people started doing what 
is right for the people of this country. 
Madam Speaker, I urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote 
on the rule and the previous question. 
The material previously referred to 
by Mr. WOODALL is as follows: 
AMENDMENT TO HOUSE RESOLUTION 1092 
At the end of the resolution, add the 
following: 
SEC. 2. Immediately upon adoption of this 
resolution, the House shall resolve into the 
Committee of the Whole House on the state

on the date of enactment of this Act and ending 
on the last day of the COVID-19 public health 
emergency or January 31, 2021, whichever is 
later, the United States Postal Service may not 
implement or approve any change to the oper-
ations or the level of service provided by the 
Postal Service from those in effect on January 1, 
2020, that would reduce service performance or 
impede prompt, reliable, and efficient services, 
including any of the following actions: 
(1) Any change in the nature of postal serv-
ices which will generally affect service on a na-
tionwide or substantially nationwide basis.

cers or employees. 
(5) Any change that would prevent the Postal 
Service from meeting its service standards or

relative to those service standards. 
(6) Any change that would have the effect of 
delaying deferring, or curtailing mail, allowing 
for the non-delivery of mail to a delivery route, 
or increasing the volume of undelivered mail. 
(7) Treating election mail as any class of mail 
other than first-class mail, regardless of whether 
such treatment requires payment of overtime 
pay to officers or employees of the Postal Serv-
ice. 
(8) Removing, decommissioning, or any other 
stoppage of mail sorting machines, other than 
for routine maintenance. 
(9) Removing or eliminating any mail collec-
tion box that is available to the public.

(2) SAME-DAY PROCESSING.—The United States 
Postal Service shall ensure, to the maximum ex-
tent practical, that election mail is processed

fice on the same day it is received at such a fa-
cility or post office. 
(d) DEFINITIONS.—In this section—

clared by the Secretary of Health and Human 
Services on January 27, 2020, with respect to the 
2019 Novel Coronavirus; 
(2) the term ‘‘election mail’’ means mail con-
sisting of—

member of the Committee on Oversight 
and Reform. 
The gentlewoman from New York 
(Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY) and the 
gentleman from Kentucky (Mr. COMER) 
each will control 1 hour. 
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from New York. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous 
consent that all Members may have 5 
legislative days in which to revise and 
extend their remarks and insert extra-
neous material on H.R. 8015. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from New York? 
There was no objection. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 5 
minutes. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support 
of the Delivering for America Act. I 
also rise in strong support of the brave 
postal workers across this Nation who 
are continuing to deliver the mail for 
the American people in the middle of a 
global pandemic. 
The Postal Service is a critical com-
ponent of America’s infrastructure. It 
provides a lifeline of medication, sup-
plies, and mail for all Americans, ev-
erywhere they live, especially in this 
time of need. 
Earlier this year, the Postal Service 
asked Congress to help. They asked us 
for $25 billion in critical assistance to 
help navigate through this crisis, just 
like all these other industries did, busi-
nesses and entities that received Fed-
eral funds from Congress. 
This was not a Democratic request. 
It came from the Postal Service, and it 
was supported unanimously by the 
Board of Governors, all of whom were 
appointed by President Trump. 
In response to this urgent request, 
the House acted. The House said yes. 
We acted swiftly to help the Postal 
Service. We voted to include $25 billion 
in the HEROES Act, and we passed it 
on May 15. 
Unfortunately, the President would 
not agree, and the request has lan-
guished for more than 3 months. And 
now we know why, because the Presi-
dent told us why. He admitted on na-
tional television that he was blocking 
the $25 billion in order to hobble mail- 
in voting. That is what he said, and I 
would like to read it to you. 
‘‘They want $25 billion for the post 
office. Now they need that money in 
order to make the post office work, so 
it can take all of these millions and 
millions of ballots.’’ 
Regrettably, it does not end there. 
Now the new Postmaster General is 
using this lack of funding to justify 
sweeping and damaging changes to 
Postal Service operations, and we have 
seen the results: national headlines 
about delays of days and weeks in mail, 
veterans desperately waiting for their 
medications, sorting machines being 
ripped out and put in dumpsters. 
Yesterday, some of my Republican 
colleagues argued at the Rules Com-
mittee that there are ‘‘no delays.’’ 
That is right, no delays happening any-
where. They claimed repeatedly that 
there is no data that proves these 
delays are real. 
But we have eyes, and we have heard 
accounts from across this Nation, from 
our districts and every district in this 
Nation, and we have the Postmaster 
General himself who admitted yester-
day that there are, in fact, delays, that 
he feels bad about them, and that he is 
working feverishly to address them. 
In addition, this afternoon, we have 
something else. We have new informa-
tion. We have received new internal 
Postal Service documents showing na-
tionwide performance data from July 
and August, official post office data. 
These new documents show that the 
delays we have all heard about are ac-
tually far worse than previously ex-
pected and told us. And they are across 
the board. They are across this Nation.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4272 
August 22, 2020 
This afternoon, I am making these 
new documents available to all Mem-
bers of the House, and I urge you to re-
view them carefully. They will be 
available on the floor during this de-
bate. 
The bill we are considering today is 
simple. It does two things. First, it 
provides the $25 billion the Postal 
Service requested on a bipartisan basis 
to help during the coronavirus crisis. 
Second, it returns delivery standards 
to the way they were before the Post-
master General recently caused all 
those delays, which has an impact on 
the delivery and the ability of Ameri-
cans to vote by mail. 
This is not a partisan issue. It makes 
absolutely no sense to implement these 
dramatic changes in the middle of a 
pandemic less than 3 months before the 
November elections. 
The American people do not want 
anyone messing with the post office. 
They certainly do not want it to be po-
liticized. They just want their mail, 
they want their medicines, and they 
want their mail-in ballots delivered in 
a timely way. And that is exactly what 
our bill does. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. COMER. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposi-
tion to H.R. 8015, the Delivering for 
America Act. This is the result of a 
legislative process only slightly less 
absurd than the conspiracies, insinu-
ations, and fabrications that gave rise 
to the purported need for it. 
I mean, just this second, the sponsor 
of the bill says she has data now that 
we can all receive while we are voting 
on the bill. I mean, is this data from a 
whistleblower? 
We 
all 
know 
their 
record with whistleblowers. 
The process is broken. Regardless, we 
are here today debating a bill to simul-
taneously hamstring and bail out the 
Postal Service. We have had no com-
mittee hearings or markups. On Mon-
day, we will hear from the new Post-
master General, after we vote on the 
bill. It makes no sense. The result is 
deeply flawed. 
Although Dr. Fauci advised that 
there is no reason Americans cannot 
vote in person, citizens choosing to 
vote by mail must have their ballots 
delivered in a timely manner. The 
Postmaster General has pledged that is 
his mission. And on Friday, before the 
Senate, he pledged ballots would be de-
livered faster than first-class mail, 
without rate increases. 
I want to turn now and, one by one, 
debunk 
the 
Democrats’ 
conspiracy 
theories. 
First, Democrats claim DeJoy is re-
moving blue collection boxes to sabo-
tage the election. This is an absurd 
claim. This removal process is routine. 
The Postal Service has removed 35,000 
boxes over the last 10 years. Under 
President Obama, at least 12,000 mail-
boxes were removed, and no one cried 
foul then. 
Second, Democrats claim Postmaster 
DeJoy is removing mail sorters to in-
tentionally slow the mail. These sort-
ers were on track to be removed prior 
to his appointment and reflect the re-
ality that mail volume is down 33 per-
cent over the past 15 years. 
b 1345 
The third Democrat claim is that the 
Postal Service cannot manage volume 
resulting from the upcoming election. 
In 2019, the Postal Service handled an 
average of 471 million pieces of mail 
each day. Assuming all 158 million reg-
istered voters decided to vote by mail, 
the total volume of requested and 
mailed ballots would not exceed a typ-
ical day of total USPS mail volume. 
Fourth, the Democrats claim the 
Postmaster General’s pilot program 
and his efforts to reduce excessive 
overtime were intended to sabotage the 
election. The Postmaster General testi-
fied he never sought to eliminate over-
time. Instead, he sought to get postal 
operations on time so there would be 
less need to rely on overtime and re-
duce extra mail truck trips. With over-
time costs of $1.1 billion in 2018 alone, 
why wouldn’t you try to improve on 
that? 
The Fifth Democratic claim is that 
the Postal Service General Counsel 
sent letters to the Senate election 
boards to intimidate and stoke fears. 
Letters were also sent in May, well be-
fore Postmaster DeJoy took over—re-
member, the Postmaster has only been 
in office 60 days—saying what the U.S. 
Postal Service has been saying for 
years, that some State election boards 
have deadlines and requirements that 
simply do not consider the reality of 
Postal Service operations and logistics 
constraints. 
If a State allows voters to request ab-
sentee ballots 1 day before the election, 
why wouldn’t the Postal Service advise 
there might be a problem. 
Sixth. Democrats are acting like any 
mail delays are new and orchestrated 
by Postmaster General DeJoy. As I 
have said time and time again, I have 
been hearing about postal delays for 
years. Where there are delays, it makes 
sense to figure out why, and it makes 
even more sense to do something to fix 
them. 
And, finally, the false narrative that 
the Postal Service is running out of 
money and will cease operations before 
the election. Currently, the Postal 
Service has over $15 billion cash on 
hand, that’s enough to keep it solvent 
until August 2021, and enough time for 
us to do the right thing. 
Like the Russia hoax and the im-
peachment sham, the Democrats have 
manufactured another scandal for po-
litical purposes. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Mr. Speaker, first, in response, 
this is not a Democratic conspiracy 
theory. 
Republican 
officials 
from 
across this country, elected and ap-
pointed, have expressed their own con-
cerns about postal delays and the 
President’s comments. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the 
gentlewoman from the District of Co-
lumbia (Ms. NORTON). 
Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, even dur-
ing this pandemic with most agencies 
down, we had not heard complaints 
from the Postal Service until Louis 
DeJoy was appointed Postmaster Gen-
eral. On the contrary, the pandemic 
had not kept our mail from being faith-
fully delivered. 
Almost immediately after DeJoy as-
sumed office, pandemonium broke out. 
For example, in Ward 8 of my district, 
there was no mail for 2 weeks. And the 
District and 46 States have been 
warned by the Postal Service itself 
that it cannot guarantee that all mail 
ballots will arrive in time to be count-
ed. 
Mr. DeJoy did not tell the truth at 
the Senate hearing yesterday. We know 
that from a July 15 memorandum di-
recting employees explicitly to leave 
mail behind and to significantly cut 
overtime. We know that from an Au-
gust 7 Postal Service action that reas-
signed 23 top executives with decades 
of institutional knowledge of postal op-
erations in order to centralize oper-
ations. We know and will bring out be-
fore this hearing is over today that the 
Post Office continues to be sabotaged. 
Mr. COMER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentlewoman from 
North Carolina (Ms. FOXX), a member 
of the Education Committee. 
Ms. FOXX of North Carolina. Mr. 
Speaker, during my time in this Cham-
ber I have devoted myself to finding 
the truth and working toward good 
governance. That requires gathering 
the facts and exposing the lies. It is in 
this light that I rise today to oppose 
H.R. 8015, the so-called Delivering for 
America Act. 
H.R. 8015 aims to solve a made-up cri-
sis by forcing the Postal Service to 
double down on the very same activi-
ties that have caused it to lose money 
consistently each year since 2006. Then 
they give the Postal Service another 
$25 billion to lose with no strings at-
tached. 
Mr. Speaker, there is no immediate 
Postal Service crisis. Democrats manu-
factured this crisis and are using it to 
create fear and advance their agenda. 
The Postal Service currently has $14 
billion in cash on hand, which is 
enough to sustain operations through 
August of 2021. This comes on top of 
the fact that the Postal Service has 
not even touched the $10 billion loan 
that Congress extended to it in the re-
cently passed CARES act. 
The Postal Service has many long- 
term problems, but there is no short- 
term crisis. If Democrats were serious 
about ensuring the longevity of the 
Postal Service, we would finally pass 
bipartisan measures like the Postal 
Service Reform Act of 2017 that was 
championed by former Representatives 
Meadows and Cummings. This bill 
would enact meaningful reforms, keep 
mailing costs down, encourage innova-
tion, and not require additional tax-
payer bailouts.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4273 
August 22, 2020 
Our 
current 
Postmaster 
General 
DeJoy took the job despite being 
vilified in public. He was unanimously 
selected by the bipartisan U.S. Postal 
Service Board of Governors because the 
board saw tremendous value in his dec-
ades of experience managing and grow-
ing a successful nationwide logistics 
company. He certainly had the quali-
fications to work with Congress and 
take on the task of postal reform. 
Mr. Speaker, we need long-term solu-
tions to fix the long-term problems of 
the Postal Service. H.R. 8015 merely 
aims to score political points on an 
issue that does not even exist. I urge 
my colleagues to vote ‘‘no’’ on this bill. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to 
the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. CON-
NOLLY), the distinguished chairman of 
the Subcommittee on Government Op-
erations. 
Mr. CONNOLLY. Mr. Speaker, we 
just heard more of the same on the 
other side of the aisle, denial and 
disinformation. And I find it particu-
larly ironic that my friend from North 
Carolina would cite the unanimous de-
cision of the Board of Governors. 
Well, guess what? That same Board 
of 
Governors 
unanimously 
rec-
ommended the $25 billion you are de-
clining that is in this bill today. It is 
interesting how we cherry-pick facts. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support 
of the Delivering for America Act. 
There is an ongoing and concerted ef-
fort to disrupt the timeliness of mail 
delivery and to erode public confidence 
in the Postal Service, all leading, if 
successful, to the largest voter suppres-
sion in American history since Jim 
Crow. 
The effort is being directed by the 
new Postmaster General, Louis DeJoy, 
a crony and major donor of the Presi-
dent. A President who opposes mail-in 
voting for everyone apparently but 
himself and his wife. A President who 
has called the Postal Service a joke 
and a scam, and who threatened to 
veto the CARES Act with $2 trillion for 
desperately needed assistance all over 
this country simply to block this fund-
ing. 
On August 18, the Postmaster Gen-
eral announced, finally, he put a hold 
on some of the sweeping operational 
changes that were not only misguided 
amid a pandemic, but actually eroded 
public confidence in America’s favorite 
government agency, the Postal Serv-
ice. 
All in a day’s work for someone un-
qualified and unfit to begin with for 
the office he now occupies. 
By now we should all know better 
than to take the administration at its 
word. And despite the Postmaster’s re-
ported retreat, the sabotage continues. 
The Postmaster is still not advocating 
for additional funding for the Postal 
Service, despite the recommendation 
by his own Board of Governors. He is 
still not committed to using overtime 
as a tool during the pandemic to com-
pensate for 40,000 postal workers who 
have had to quarantine or gotten sick. 
The 
Postmaster’s 
announcement 
didn’t commit to reversing the cuts to 
service and capacity, especially restor-
ing sorting machines that absolutely 
are critical tools in moving large vol-
umes of mail, especially on the eve of a 
consequential national election. 
That is why this bill would restore 
the service delivery standards and op-
erations in place before Mr. DeJoy 
took office. 
The 
Postmaster’s 
announcement 
didn’t include an agenda to support 
election mail that demonstrates a com-
mitment to helping the Postal Service 
fulfill its historic role in this upcoming 
election in a pandemic. That is why 
this bill will ensure that election mail 
is prioritized for expedited delivery, as 
has been the practice in previous years. 
The Postmaster’s announcement did 
not explain to the public, whom he 
serves, how an executive could fail so 
spectacularly and still keep his job. So 
we still have work to do because the 
sabotage continues. 
We must restore public confidence in 
the Postal Service and its ability to 
support voting by mail during the 
worst pandemic in 100 years. American 
democracy demands no less. 
That is our history. That is the his-
tory Mr. DeJoy ignored, and that is the 
awesome responsibility he betrayed. 
Mr. COMER. Mr. Speaker, I want to 
add, there is no evidence of the charges 
of the gentleman from Virginia. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the 
gentleman 
from 
Kentucky 
(Mr. 
MASSIE). 
Mr. MASSIE. Mr. Speaker, in March, 
Speaker PELOSI called me a dangerous 
nuisance for insisting that at least half 
of Congress come back to vote on a $2 
trillion bailout bill. This week, she has 
called Congress into session to vote on 
a post office bill that is nothing but po-
litical posturing. 
Now, Speaker PELOSI
told us we 
would probably be back in August to 
vote on a PPP bill. What she didn’t tell 
us is that the PPP would stand for 
PELOSI’s political posturing. 
Let me read a quote from the chief 
operating officer of the U.S. Postal 
Service that might explain what is 
going on. ‘‘The decision to consolidate 
mail processing facilities recognizes 
the urgent need to reduce the size of 
the national mail processing network 
to eliminate costly underutilized infra-
structure.’’ That was the chief oper-
ating officer under Obama and Biden. 
In fact, that is from a press release in 
2012 when they announced they were 
closing nine processing facilities in the 
State of Kentucky. In fact, they didn’t 
remove the equipment, they locked the 
doors and turned out the lights and 
shut it down forever, even in Lex-
ington, Kentucky, our second biggest 
city in Kentucky. A year earlier they 
closed down a processing facility in my 
district, the Obama administration 
did—Obama/Biden. 
I include those press releases in the 
RECORD. 
[Feb. 23, 2012] 
KENTUCKY MAIL PROCESSING CLOSINGS 
ANNOUNCED 
KENTUCKIANA
DISTRICT—As a result of 
studies begun five months ago, the Postal 
Service has made the decision to move all 
mail processing processing operations from: 
Bowling Green, KY Processing and Dis-
tribution Facility (P&DF) to the Nashville, 
TN, Processing and Distribution Center 
(P&DC). 
Campton, KY, Customer Service Mail 
Processing Center (CSMPC) to the Louis-
ville, KY, P&DC. 
Elizabethtown, KY, CSMPC to the Louis-
ville P&DC. 
Hazard, KY, CSMPC to the Knoxville, TN, 
P&DC. 
Lexington, KY, P&DC to the Louisville 
P&DC and the Knoxville P&DC. 
London, KY P&DF to the Knoxville P&DC. 
Paducah, KY, P&DF to the Evansville, IN, 
P&DF. 
Somerset, KY, CSMPC to the Knoxville 
P&DC. 
Once the transfers are completed, the mail 
processing operation at the closing sites will 
cease. There will be no change to any of the 
retail units, business mail entry units or ve-
hicle maintenance facilities at these loca-
tions at this time. 
It also has been determined as a result of 
the study of the Louisville, KY, Annex, that 
there was no significant opportunity to im-
prove efficiency or service through consoli-
dation of mail processing operations, and no 
changes will be made at this time. 
The Postal Service has experienced a 25 
percent decline in First-Class Mail volume 
since 2006, and receives no tax dollars for its 
operations, relying instead on the sale of 
postage, and postal products and services. 
‘‘The decision to consolidate mail proc-
essing facilities recognizes the urgent need 
to reduce the size of the national mail proc-
essing network to eliminate costly underuti-
lized infrastructure,’’ said Chief Operating 
Officer. ‘‘Consolidating operations is nec-
essary if the Postal Service is to remain via-
ble to provide mail service to the nation.’’ 
Specific dates have not been set for the 
transition. Until a specific date has been an-
nounced, residential and business mailers 
will continue to be served through the cur-
rent facilities. 
In December 2011, the Postal Service 
agreed to impose a moratorium on closing or 
consolidating post offices and mail proc-
essing facilities prior to May 15, 2012, to give 
Congress and the Administration the oppor-
tunity to enact an alternative plan. 
This delay was designed to allow Congress 
sufficient time to enact comprehensive post-
al legislation. In the meantime, the Postal 
Service continued all necessary steps re-
quired for the review of these facilities, in-
cluding public notifications, public input 
meetings and consideration of public com-
ments. 
Implementation of this consolidation is 
contingent upon the outcome of pending 
rulemaking for a proposal to revise existing 
service standards. This announcement is pro-
vided in advance so that appropriate plan-
ning and notification can be made in accord-
ance with existing employee agreements. 
A list of mail processing studies and their 
status 
is 
available 
at 
usps.com/ 
ourfuturenetwork. 
Specific 
information 
about individual studies, including public 
meeting summaries and summary briefs, is 
posted 
on

website,

areamailprocessing, as it becomes available.

August 22, 2020 
made the decision to move mail processing 
operations from the Ashland Processing and 
Distribution Facility to the Charleston WV 
Processing and Distribution Facility. 
Kentuckiana District Manager James W. 
Kiser said, ‘‘Given the drastic 20 percent de-
cline in mail volume the Postal Service has 
experienced since 2007, we must take action 
to reduce the size of our mail processing net-
work. Consolidating operations and placing 
our people where we need them is necessary 
if the Postal Service is to remain viable to 
provide mail service to the nation.’’ 
I understand our employees’ concern over 
this move,’’ Kiser added, ‘‘but the consolida-
tion makes sense given the fiscal realities. 
The Charleston facility has the capacity to 
handle the additional workload and we can 
realize significant savings by shifting oper-
ations there.’’ 
The transition is expected to be completed 
by January 2012. Some employees may be re-
assigned to the Charleston facility or to 
other vacant positions as a result of the 
move. 
This move will not cause any changes in 
local mail delivery,’’ said Kiser. ‘‘Letters 
mailed to local addresses will be delivered 
the next day, the same as before. I am con-
fident the transition will be smooth and 
transparent to our customers and they will 
continue to receive the same excellent serv-
ice they always have.’’ 
There will be no change in service stand-
ards for 96.3 percent of mail. However, as a 
result of the consolidation, service to 403–406, 
413–414, 417–418, 430–432 and 456 will change 
from overnight to 2-day. Service to 246–248, 
250–253, 258–259 and 261–266 will improve from 
2-day to overnight. ‘‘The significant cost 
savings and productivity gains expected from 
this consolidation were deciding factors in 
making this very difficult decision,’’ said 
Kiser. 
Full retail services will still be available 
at the Ashland Post Office. 
The Ashland Business Mail Entry Unit will 
remain open for large volume business mail-
ers. Large volume business mailers will be 
able to bring their mail to the Ashland Busi-
ness Mail Entry Unit at 1140 Carter Ave. 
Mr. MASSIE. Mr. Speaker, my mail, 
if I send it to my neighbor, goes to 
Charleston, West Virginia, before it 
comes back to Kentucky. Is this part of 
some vast conspiracy? No. It’s part of a 
decade’s 
long 
realignment 
process 
where the post office is trying to 
match the needs of the consumers to 
the post office infrastructure. 
These voter suppression conspiracies, 
who knows what the Democrats will 
blame next. Last month they were 
blaming the Census, this month they 
are blaming the post office, probably 
next month they will blame Amtrak. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to 
the 
gentleman 
from 
Massachusetts 
(Mr. LYNCH), the chair of the Sub-
committee on National Security for 
the Committee on Oversight and Re-
form. 
Mr. LYNCH. Mr. Speaker, as chair-
man of the Subcommittee on National 
Security, I want to rise in strong sup-
port of H.R. 8015, the Delivering for 
America Act. 
This urgent legislation would reverse 
the ill-advised changes to mail delivery 
that the new Postmaster General has 
implemented to the injury of every 
American’s right to vote, and at a seri-
ous peril to our democracy. 
In my own district, in the city of 
Boston and city of Brockton, the Post-
al Service has removed at least six 
high-capacity mail sorting machines in 
the mail facility in South Boston, and 
two more from the postal processing 
and distribution center in the city of 
Brockton, causing a 4- to 5-day delay 
right now in the city of Brockton. 
b 1400 
Why would someone do that 10 days 
before a congressional primary in Mas-
sachusetts in the midst of a pandemic 
when people are being asked to vote by 
mail in order to keep themselves safe? 
Mr. Speaker, I was elected on 9/11, 
the day of the terrorist attacks on our 
country. As horrific as that day was, I 
feel proud that our Nation came to-
gether, as Americans do in difficult 
times. We mourned our fallen heroes. 
We tried to comfort their families. And 
we turned to face our adversary to-
gether, Democrat and Republican. 
Looking back, I believe our democ-
racy was less in danger then than it is 
today. I say that for two reasons. First, 
because we were united then, and we 
are divided today. And we know who 
divides us. Secondly, back then, the 
threat was external. But today, at this 
moment, the greatest threat to our de-
mocracy is the current administration. 
I call on my colleagues: Stand to-
gether. Stand together and defend de-
mocracy. Defend your own constitu-
ents’ right to vote. I urge my col-
leagues to vote in favor of H.R. 8015. 
Defend democracy. You will miss it 
when it is gone. 
Mr. COMER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 
minutes to the gentleman from Geor-
gia (Mr. HICE), the ranking member of 
the Subcommittee on Government Op-
erations. 
Mr. HICE of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the ranking member and my 
friend for yielding. 
I would counter by saying the great-
est threat to democracy in the country 
is the current majority in the House of 
Representatives. What we are doing 
even right here today, what we are 
doing right now, we haven’t even had a 
hearing on this. 
We are going to have a hearing on 
Monday for something we are voting on 
today. Absolute political malpractice 
is what we are watching right here. 
Why do we even debate this? Why don’t 
we have a vote and then debate it? 
That is the same issue as what we are 
doing right now. 
My Democratic friends over here are 
blaming the President as though he is 
involved in voter suppression. We want 
to talk about voter suppression. We 
want to talk about influencing the 
vote. 
Our own Speaker PELOSI just a little 
while ago had a press conference in 
which she was touting, 100 days ago, 
the HEROES Act passed. What she did 
not say was what was in the HEROES 
Act: forbidding States from having 
voter ID. 
We are going to have universal mail- 
in ballots, no voter ID. We are going to 
have ballot harvesting across the coun-
try. So, we have no purging of votes. 
We are just going to send out millions 
of ballots, among which deceased peo-
ple are there, folks who have moved, or 
ballots just being sent out all over the 
place. There will be no voter IDs re-
quired. Yet, all these ballots, somebody 
is going to vote for them and send 
them back in. Talk about political 
malpractice. 
The chairwoman herself ought to be 
the first to stand up and testify of the 
disaster of her own election that took 
over 6 weeks or thereabouts to get the 
results because these mail-in ballots 
kept coming and coming and coming, 
thousands of which were thrown out. It 
opened doors for lawsuits in your own 
election. 
It is just absolute insanity what we 
are doing here, to me. It is a represen-
tation of why people are so disgusted 
with Washington. 
We talk about the delays in the mail 
service. In April this year, we had a 
briefing—not a hearing, a briefing—to 
inform us of the delays that were going 
to be brought about in the Postal Serv-
ice due to COVID. Well, that is hap-
pening. We have thousands of postal 
workers who are not working because 
of COVID. 
We also have great delays—would 
you not agree?—in cities like Portland, 
like Chicago. Of course, there are in-
credible delays. People are scared to 
death to even deliver the mail in cities 
like this. Here we come to a place like 
this to bail out the Postal Service with 
$25 billion that the Postmaster General 
himself says they do not need, with $14 
or $15 billion cash on hand and another 
$10 billion waiting, if needed, in the 
Treasury. 
This is absolutely unneeded. Yet, this 
bill is going to give an additional $25 
billion without any reforms. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
vote against this bill. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Mr. Speaker, yesterday, in the 
Rules Committee, the other side kept 
claiming that there was no data about 
the slowdown in the mail, absolutely 
none. 
Well, this new report, this data, 
shows a 10 percent decline in service 
since July 1 after the new Postmaster 
General came into office and imple-
mented a slowdown of the mail. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the 
distinguished gentlewoman from Illi-
nois (Mrs. BUSTOS). 
Mrs. BUSTOS. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentlewoman for yielding. 
I rise in support of the Delivering for 
America Act. The post office is a life-
line to rural communities. More than 
1,000 people in the district that I serve 
have written to my office desperate to 
save the Postal Service: a disabled vet-
eran who depends on the post office to 
deliver lifesaving medication; a small 
business owner who needs the post of-
fice to deliver her products in an effi-
cient and cost-effective way, so she can 
feed her family; seniors who must self-

isolate because they are at high risk, 
who depend on the Postal Service for 
the supplies they need each and every 
day. 
The Postal Service is more than a 
service; it is part of who we are. For 
Joseph in Peoria, he was a child wait-
ing for that decoder ring to come 
through the mail. For Heather in 
Pekin, it is a care package full of old 
family photos after losing a loved one. 
For Joseph in Kewanee, it is a letter 
from his best friend serving in Afghani-
stan. 
Birth certificates, college acceptance 
letters, the mortgage paid off, the 
Postal Service delivers the American 
Dream. We cannot let it fail. 
Mr. COMER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentleman from Geor-
gia (Mr. FERGUSON), the chief deputy 
whip. 
Mr. FERGUSON. Mr. Speaker, I 
would like to wish my mother a happy 
birthday. Happy birthday, mom. I wish 
I were there to celebrate with you. But 
instead, I am in D.C., voting on a 
senseless bill that was designed strictly 
for political purposes and will put your 
beloved 
grandchildren 
further 
into 
debt. 
Now, I have watched my colleagues 
on the other side of the aisle come up 
with 
some 
intellectually 
dishonest 
stuff in the past. I have seen it happen 
more times than I care to count, but 
this effort takes the cake. Just look at 
what Postmaster General DeJoy said 
when he testified before the Senate last 
week and clearly addressed the litany 
of baseless claims. 
First of all, he stated that no reforms 
would be implemented between now 
and the election. Overtime will not be 
cut between now and November. And 
the very thing the USPS needs more 
than anything else, reform, is going to 
be delayed. 
He said the removal of the drop boxes 
will cease, something that I remember 
well because it happened when I was 
mayor of my hometown of West Point, 
Georgia, and our town was furious 
about it then. I just wish my col-
leagues on the other side of the aisle 
had found religion about this issue 
back then instead of sitting up here 
fighting over what color to paint the 
fire hydrants while Rome burned. 
This bill calls for 25 billion addi-
tional dollars. The postmaster has al-
ready testified there is over $13 billion 
cash on hand, another $10 billion in 
loans they won’t need. 
I want someone to explain to me how 
you are going to spend $25 billion be-
tween now and November. We know 
how this place works. On an unauthor-
ized appropriation, we all know that 
before you spend money here, you have 
to have a plan, and I haven’t seen one. 
Then, that plan has to be reviewed and 
then 
commented 
on 
and 
reviewed 
again. Then one more time, it probably 
has to be reviewed. Then, there is the 
whole procurement process, bid process 
on equipment, background checks on 
new employees, the lawsuits on the 
procurement process because the spe-
cial interest group said that they 
weren’t notified in time so they could 
get preferential treatment on the gov-
ernment contract. And surely, there 
will be the customary environmental 
review. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. 
CISNEROS). The time of the gentleman 
has expired. 
Mr. COMER. Mr. Speaker, I yield an 
additional 30 seconds to the gentleman 
from Georgia. 
Mr. FERGUSON. Mr. Speaker, surely 
there will be the customary environ-
mental review to understand the im-
pact on the spotted blue tail south 
Georgia armadillo being run over by all 
the new mail trucks. 
This bill is a sham. It is a shame. It 
is not needed right now. We are piling 
up money. We might as well put it on 
The National Mall, have a bonfire, in-
vite Americans to bring their lawn 
chairs and a cooler of beer to watch the 
bonfire, so they can see firsthand how 
this place wastes money. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge a ‘‘no’’ vote. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such 
time as I may consume. 
The other side of the aisle has a dou-
ble standard. Congress provided hun-
dreds of billions of dollars to all sorts 
of industries, businesses, large and 
small entities across the country to 
help them cope with the coronavirus 
crisis. We did not require them to come 
forward with detailed plans of how 
they are going to spend their money. 
But they want it for the Postal Serv-
ice. 
Now, the Postal Service made a pub-
lic request, and they requested it and 
presented it to the Board of Governors, 
who are appointed by President Trump, 
and the Board approved it unani-
mously. That is far more than all these 
other entities that we have given bil-
lions of dollars to did. And we should 
support the Postal Service now. 
On top of it, the CBO came out with 
an estimate that this money would be 
spent in the next fiscal year, and that 
they needed it. The CBO record can be 
found online. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the 
gentleman 
from 
Maryland 
(Mr. 
MFUME). 
Mr. MFUME. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentlewoman for yielding. 
I heard someone on the other side 
said something that disturbed me, so it 
has actually taken me off my remarks 
because it can’t go unaddressed. 
For the gentleman to say that Demo-
crats, the majority party here in the 
House, are the greatest threat to 
American democracy that the world 
has ever known, that means we are 
more threatening than Putin and the 
Russians, more threatening than this 
terrible pandemic around us. It is the 
sort of thing that I would admonish my 
side never to say about the other side, 
and it is the sort of thing that I think 
takes us away from why we are here. 
We are here to have debate and dis-
cussion and to reasonably disagree on 
things. At the end of the day, we are 
calling for a vote as we normally do. 
Things are voted up; things are voted 
down. That has been the process that I 
have come to know over all these 
years. 
We are here because Americans who 
are Democrats and Republicans and 
independents are not getting their mail 
on time. We are here because there has 
been a 10 percent slowdown in the last 
66 days. We are here because sorting 
machines have been dismantled at an 
accelerated rate, not the normal rate, 
an accelerated rate all across America. 
We are here because mailboxes, with-
out density studies, are being snatched. 
They have been removed over the 
years, but it has accelerated. It has ac-
celerated to such an extent that now 
people are wondering: Where is their 
medication? Where is their check? 
It is veterans. It is our small busi-
nesses that are hampered by this. It is 
senior citizens. So, we are not here 
mysteriously on a Saturday to point 
fingers and to call names. 
The other side has a right to dis-
agree, but this is a problem. I don’t 
know about your constituents, but all 
of mine are telling me that they can’t 
get their mail on time. They expect more. 
If the first Postmaster General looked back 
at this day, I am sure Ben Franklin would be 
spinning in his grave. 
We have an issue before us. We ought 
to go at it with vigorous debate. At the 
end of the day, I may lose and you may 
win, or I may win and you may lose, 
but the American public loses without 
us standing up for this issue. 
Mr. COMER. Mr. Speaker, obviously 
the last speaker, the gentleman from 
Maryland, missed the part where one of 
his 
Members 
proclaimed 
that 
the 
President was the greatest threat to 
democracy. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the 
gentleman 
from 
Wisconsin 
(Mr. 
GROTHMAN), the ranking member of the 
Committee on Oversight and Reform’s 
National Security Subcommittee. 
Mr. GROTHMAN. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman for yielding. 
This is a very interesting debate 
today. I think it would be a good de-
bate to be reviewed by every political 
science class in the country as we ana-
lyze how Congress has spent us to a $25 
trillion debt. 
We have a situation today in which 
the U.S. Postal Service is sitting on $15 
billion. They have the right to borrow 
$10 billion from a stimulus package bill 
we passed earlier. They are making 
more money this year than last year 
because deliveries of packages are up. 
But despite all these numbers, the ma-
jority party has decided to spend an ad-
ditional $25 billion. 
Now, I like the post office. I really 
do. But when you have an agency that 
can spend $25 billion that is unspent 
right now, $24 billion, and you intro-
duce a bill to say they need another $25 
billion, and if you don’t vote for that 
$25 billion bill, it means you don’t want 
children to get little toys they are

going receive in the mail, or it means 
that we don’t like the post office, that 
is outlandish. 
b 1415 
There are other things we can look at 
as well. 
They talk about getting rid of post 
offices. In the first 3 years in which 
President Trump has complete control 
of the administration, they will be get-
ting rid of less post office boxes than 
Obama from 2013 to 2016—I don’t have 
the numbers before 2013; it might be 4 
years in a row—in the greatest year in 
which President Trump got rid of mail-
boxes. 
Another thing to point out is, even if 
every single person in this country 
votes absentee, which they won’t, it 
would only increase mail that month 
by 11⁄2 percent. So we have no crisis 
here. It is something they will easily 
be able to handle. 
The idea that we are even talking 
about spending another $25 billion 
today is indicative of why this country 
is going to wind up spending itself into 
oblivion. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to 
the gentleman from New York (Mr. 
JEFFRIES), the distinguished chair of 
the Democratic Caucus. 
Mr. JEFFRIES. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the distinguished chair for yielding and 
for her tremendous leadership. 
The post office is as American as 
motherhood, baseball, and apple pie. It 
is one of the only entities actually 
mentioned in the United States Con-
stitution. It has been around for hun-
dreds of years. The first Postmaster 
General was Dr. Ben Franklin. It is 
part of the heart and soul of this coun-
try, and the attacks on the post office 
by 
the 
Trump 
administration 
are 
shameful. 
The American people deserve a Post-
al Service that delivers Social Security 
checks to senior citizens, delivers med-
icine to disabled veterans, delivers un-
employment insurance checks to dis-
placed Americans, and, yes, delivers 
ballots to those who choose to vote by 
mail in the midst of a deadly pan-
demic, because no American should 
ever have to choose between their 
health, safety, and well-being on the 
one hand and the constitutional right 
to vote on the other. 
This is why we need a fully func-
tional Postal Service. Don’t mess with 
USPS. 
Mr. COMER. Mr. Speaker, may I in-
quire as to the balance of our time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from Kentucky has 431⁄2 min-
utes remaining. 
Mr. COMER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentleman from Texas 
(Mr. CLOUD), another Oversight and Re-
form Committee ranking member. 
Mr. CLOUD. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
Mr. COMER for yielding. 
Mr. Speaker, you will never hear me 
complain about having to come to 
Washington to vote. After all, it is an 
honor to serve the people of this great 
Nation and our constitutional obliga-
tion to be here present to vote on the 
issues facing America. 
So the question today is: Are there 
issues that need to be addressed in the 
United States Postal Service? 
There certainly are. We all know 
that there are. After all, the USPS has 
been 
on 
the 
Government 
Accountability’s High Risk List since 
the beginning of the Obama-Biden ad-
ministration. 
The systemic issues are not new. 
They did not creep up all of a sudden in 
the last few weeks since the new Post-
master has been in office. They have 
been here for awhile. So, if we are real-
ly trying to address the issues, there is 
room for discussion. 
The late Chairman Elijah Cummings 
and the now White House Chief of Staff 
MARK MEADOWS have a bill that has 
some serious effort put into it. 
Tomorrow we will be having a hear-
ing with the Postmaster to discuss the 
bill we are arguing today and voting 
on. 
The White House has offered a $10 bil-
lion package, which the Speaker has 
rejected. 
So there are options if we want to ad-
dress the real issues, but today is not 
about a serious effort. Today’s effort is 
yet another smokescreen, another con-
spiracy theory forced upon the Amer-
ican people to distract us from the real 
problems facing the American people; 
to distract from the Speaker’s unwill-
ingness to work with the White House 
to protect schools, hospitals, and small 
businesses; to extend PPP to mom-and- 
pop businesses that are on the brink 
and the families connected to them; to 
address the heartbreaking violence and 
destruction in our cities and streets. 
The American people are tired of 
this, tired of lurching from one manu-
factured crisis to another, tired of lead-
ership by fear-mongering, tired of this 
House preferring to campaign on issues 
rather than to fix them. 
The bill offered today will not save 
the USPS or provide for long-term sus-
tainability. Today’s effort is another 
attempt to mask the fact that this 
House under this leadership is doing 
very little for the American people. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to 
the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. 
WASSERMAN SCHULTZ), another member 
of the Committee on Oversight and Re-
form. 
Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Mr. 
Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for 
yielding. 
I rise to support the Delivering for 
America Act, to protect a pillar of our 
democracy and fortify a lifeline so 
many Americans count on. 
This bill would provide urgently 
needed Postal Service funding and bar 
its leaders from compromising its serv-
ices during this COVID–19 crisis. 
We all know the motto: ‘‘Neither 
snow nor rain nor heat nor gloom of 
night stays these couriers from the 
swift completion of their appointed 
rounds.’’ But, of course, no one foresaw 
that any American President would 
willingly crowbar our mail system to 
sway an election. So the Delivering for 
America Act will safeguard our democ-
racy from any Presidential subversion. 
This legislation will also allow our 
mail carriers to do their job by ensur-
ing overtime and proper equipment are 
available. 
It will make sure intentional service 
delays are avoided so our seniors get 
their Social Security checks and pre-
scriptions. 
It defends our veterans, who count on 
this noble occupation for work and rely 
on the postal system to deliver their 
medicine. 
My State, Florida, just completed a 
primary where nearly 60 percent of the 
counted ballots arrived by mail. Savvy 
seniors and residents reeling from a 
summer of viral outbreaks wanted the 
safety that only mail-in balloting pro-
vided. 
This year, our country saw half a 
million primary ballots rejected, and a 
main reason they get tossed is due to 
postal delays. 
These brave frontline workers are de-
livering goods amid a pandemic, and it 
has taken its toll on their workforce. 
So in a State like Florida, known for 
its razor-thin Presidential elections, 
we can’t afford to have 59 sorting ma-
chines left on the sidelines. 
Blocking 
postal 
employees 
from 
overtime is not an option, especially 
when it may hold up hundreds of bal-
lots that decide the Presidency. 
The Delivering for America Act helps 
defend our democracy from the hypoc-
risy of a President who casts mail-in 
ballots himself one day, then tries to 
meddle in our neighbor’s mailbox the 
next. 
Don’t mess with the USPS. Pass this 
good bill. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Mem-
bers are reminded to refrain from en-
gaging in personalities toward the 
President. 
Mr. COMER. Mr. Speaker, that ship 
has sailed. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the 
gentleman from Ohio (Mr. GIBBS), an-
other great member of the Oversight 
and Reform Committee. 
Mr. GIBBS. Mr. Speaker, once again, 
my colleagues on the other side of the 
aisle are pulling the wool over the 
American people’s eyes. 
We are here today not to debate or 
conduct public policy for the benefit of 
the Nation; we are here so they can 
perform in political theater. If you 
have any doubt about that, this coming 
Monday, the Oversight and Reform 
Committee is having a hearing with 
the Postmaster General about this 
same issue. 
So we are voting first, then we are 
having hearings? I think that is you- 
know-what backwards. 
My colleagues on the left are faking 
outrage over a made-up crisis to score 
points during an election. The United

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4277 
August 22, 2020 
States Postal Service is under no 
greater stress than it was before the 
coronavirus pandemic and well before 
this election cycle. 
The facts have been laid out by ex-
perts, by independent journalists, by 
regular citizens who do the job the 
mainstream media refuses to do. Rath-
er than find out and report what is 
really going on, we have mainstream 
media parroting Speaker PELOSI’s con-
spiracy theory. 
Here are the facts: 
The post office is solvent through 
most of 2021 and will be able to operate 
for the 2020 election. They have $15 bil-
lion cash on hand. They have a $10 bil-
lion line of credit they have not used. 
If every single American voted by 
mail this cycle, it would be as low as 
one-quarter of the mail the post office 
handles daily. 
We have heard a lot about the sorting 
machines. First-class mail has really 
tapered off and the volume of packages 
has increased, so that is an efficiency 
standard that is doing better. 
During the 5-year span of the Obama 
administration, 14,000 blue collection 
boxes were removed from the streets. 
Twice during election years, the 
Obama administration proposed fund-
ing cuts to the Postal Service. Where 
was the outrage then? There was none. 
Removing and relocating collection 
boxes where they are more useful is 
common sense, not a conspiracy. 
Postmaster DeJoy testified and has 
come out publicly saying they are not 
going to do any more cost-cutting 
measures before the election, so every-
thing is frozen. 
What the other side really wants is 
universal mail voting, not absentee 
voting, which we all support. They 
want universal mail voting. We just 
mail out ballots to anybody, and who 
knows who they will be. All that is 
going to do is sow the seeds, if the elec-
tion doesn’t go their way, to create 
more chaos and more division in this 
country. 
You won’t hear any of these facts 
from the mainstream media. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentleman has expired. 
Mr. COMER. Mr. Speaker, I yield an 
additional 30 seconds to the gentleman 
from Ohio. 
Mr. GIBBS. Mr. Speaker, this bill 
provides funding that is already there. 
Creating and peddling this conspiracy 
theory is irresponsible and reckless. At 
a time when Russia and China are med-
dling in our elections, we don’t need 
help from Congress peddling fake news. 
This is one bill that needs to be la-
beled, ‘‘Return to sender.’’ 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to 
the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. DEFA-
ZIO), the distinguished chair of the 
Transportation 
and 
Infrastructure 
Committee. 
Mr. DEFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, see this 
mask? What does it say? ‘‘United 
States Postal Service.’’ Not ‘‘busi-
ness’’; ‘‘service.’’ 
For every American, no matter how 
remote they live, they can get mail. 
They can get their prescriptions. They 
can have a small business in Powers, 
Oregon, pretty remote from every-
thing, and use the Postal Service. 
Now, you can’t have it both ways, 
guys. You say the Postal Service 
doesn’t have a problem. Well, wait a 
minute. DeJoy is making these cuts be-
cause he says it has a revenue problem. 
He has prohibited overtime because 
they have a revenue problem. They 
can’t move their delivery vehicle more 
than four times on a route. Eight-mile- 
long route, you are going to walk 2 
miles each way. 
Guess what? Mail is getting delayed 
all across the country. 
The fact is, before the pandemic, 
they were breaking even or making 
money if we did away with the stupid 
prefunding of 75 years of healthcare 
that was put in in the dark of the night 
by the Bush administration in a lame-
duck Congress, and 309 people in this 
House, including 87 Republicans, voted 
for that in February, but it hasn’t hap-
pened. 
So you can’t have it both ways. 
But there is no doubt that the mail is 
being delayed. I am hearing it from ev-
erywhere. 
Ms. Lorey, she cares for a blind elder-
ly veteran: I ordered the VA refills for 
him. They were so late arriving, we had 
to ration out his most important medi-
cation from two pills a day to one pill 
a day until the prescription arrived. 
Ms. Trudy, Eugene, Oregon: My hus-
band is a Vietnam war veteran. His 
meds are delivered by mail. I love my 
husband. I want him to get the meds he 
needs to survive. 
Last year, the Postal Service deliv-
ered 125 million VA prescriptions on 
time, but somehow, with the efficiency 
measures and the cuts—which I guess 
they don’t need to make, but he is 
making because of the financial cri-
sis—they can’t deliver VA meds on 
time. They can’t deliver prescription 
drugs for seniors and many other 
Americans who are required by their 
insurance plan to get their meds 
through the mail with just-in-time de-
livery, which isn’t happening. 
You cannot deny those things. 
Why are they happening? How are 
you going to fix it? 
You are up here blathering about all 
sorts of crap. Talk about how we are 
going to restore this Postal Service in 
the United States of America to effi-
ciency. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Mem-
bers are reminded to address their re-
marks to the Chair. 
Mr. COMER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentleman from South 
Carolina (Mr. NORMAN), another great 
member of the Oversight and Reform 
Committee. 
Mr. NORMAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to apologize to the American 
taxpayers for this total sham of a proc-
ess that the Democrats and this leader-
ship are trying to spread. They con-
tinue to have Trump derangement syn-
drome. 
Here are the questions I would ask 
my Democrat colleagues: 
If the Democrats are so concerned, 
then why have we not had a hearing 
about the Postal Service issues since 
June 15 of 2019? 
If the Democrats are so concerned, 
why have we not had round-the-clock 
meetings to discuss the bill that we in-
tend to fund at $25 billion which is 
being proposed? 
We have been out of session for 17 
percent of the time since March 15. 
Why haven’t we been called back in to 
discuss this? 
If you do the math, on $25 billion, 
and we have got 70 days left, that is 
roughly $325 million per day. 
You tell the American taxpayer 
where you are spending that money. 
You tell the American taxpayer how 
we are going to come up with it. You 
tell the American taxpayer this is like 
dropping money from a helicopter. 
If the Democrats are so concerned 
about the post office, why are we hav-
ing to vote today when the Postmaster 
General is appearing at the hearing on 
Monday? This is just like determining 
the score of a football game and then 
playing the game on Monday. It makes 
no sense. 
b 1430 
The Democrats have no interest in 
hearing the testimony of Mr. DeJoy. 
The only thing they want to do is be-
rate and not give the Postmaster Gen-
eral the opportunity to answer, just 
like they did Attorney General Barr, 
which was a disgrace to this country. 
The taxpayers deserve better. 
The Democrats will have no discus-
sion on the spying of the President 
since 2016. 
The Democrats have no explanation 
of a failed Mueller Report. 
The Democrats have no explanation 
for the impeachment of the President. 
The post office will fail as well. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Mr. Speaker, I would like to cor-
rect for the RECORD
that the Com-
mittee on Oversight and Reform had a 
briefing on postal on April 9, 2020— 
right after the COVID crisis struck 
us—with the Postmaster General. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the 
gentlewoman 
from 
Illinois 
(Ms. 
KELLY), who is another great member 
of the committee. 
Ms. KELLY of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I 
stand 
with 
my 
colleagues 
today 
shocked and dismayed by the actions of 
this administration. 
For the past few years, the Oversight 
and Reform Committee has worked in a 
bipartisan fashion to modernize the 
Postal Service with former Representa-
tive 
MARK
MEADOWS
leading 
the 
charge. 
Now, like too many things over the 
past 31⁄2 years, mail has become a par-
tisan issue. The Postal Service is a pil-
lar of our democracy. It is essential for 
providing critical services such as: life-
saving prescriptions, Social Security

benefits, paychecks, tax returns, let-
ters home from military families, and 
absentee ballots to millions of Ameri-
cans. 
The VA delivers prescriptions to 80 
percent of our veterans via the mail. 
This intentional and ridiculous slow-
down means vets are skipping doses 
while checking empty mailboxes. 
While I was back home, one of my 
businesses told me they hadn’t received 
mail for 10 days. Another person told 
me they received mail every other day. 
This cannot go on, and we cannot 
trust the word of a Postmaster General 
who is unqualified and whose sweeping 
operational changes degrade the Postal 
Service, delay the mail, and threaten 
our upcoming election. We must pass 
the Delivering for America Act so we 
can return the United States post of-
fice to normal and ensure we have a 
safe election where everyone is count-
ed. 
Mr. COMER. Mr. Chair, I have to 
comment on what the chairwoman said 
about the briefings. A briefing is not a 
committee hearing. With a briefing, 
there are no notice requirements. Of-
tentimes in the beginning we weren’t 
allowed to have witnesses, and there 
are no transcripts. So there is a big dif-
ference between a briefing and a com-
mittee hearing. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the 
gentleman 
from 
Pennsylvania 
(Mr. 
KELLER), who is another member of the 
Oversight and Reform Committee. 
Mr. KELLER. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to discuss the need for meaning-
ful, long-term reform for the United 
States Postal Service. 
The USPS provides an essential serv-
ice to every community in the Nation, 
yet this agency has lost $78 billion in 
the last 13 years. In 2009 the Govern-
ment Accountability Office published a 
report placing USPS on the high-risk 
list, doubting the self-sustaining finan-
cial viability of this agency. The finan-
cial state of the USPS has progres-
sively worsened due to declining mail 
volume, liabilities, and debt. Proposals 
to give the USPS $25 billion in cash 
without serious reforms will not ad-
dress the fundamental issues that the 
agency faces. 
The proposals before us today only 
delay real reform and throw taxpayer 
dollars at a problem with no clear vi-
sion forward. Rather than politicizing 
the mail, we should be working to give 
the USPS longevity through com-
prehensive reforms. Rather than trying 
to fix a problem by simply spending 
more taxpayer money, we should be en-
acting reforms to equip our Nation’s 
outstanding postal workers with the 
tools they need and deserve to continue 
delivering the mail. This is the only 
way we will ensure that Americans 
continue to receive this vital service 
without interruption. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to 
the gentlewoman from the Virgin Is-
lands (Ms. PLASKETT), who is another 
outstanding member of the committee. 
Ms. PLASKETT. Mr. Speaker, today 
we vote on a bill that would block an 
attack on the U.S. Postal Service. By 
doing so we are blocking an attack on 
an American institution, on our Amer-
ican way of life, and on democracy. By 
responding to the unanimous requests 
of the Trump-appointed Board of Gov-
ernors of the Postal Service for a fund-
ing of $25 billion and restoring oper-
ations to January 1 levels, we will lit-
erally be saving lives. 
The necessity of this vote and the ne-
cessity of this legislation shows the 
peril to our democracy that this ad-
ministration has placed us all in, our 
elders, our veterans, our businesses, 
and our vote. 
We will go further than just voting, 
and we will have that hearing on Mon-
day on the Oversight and Reform Com-
mittee led by Chairwoman MALONEY to 
speak with the Postmaster General to 
examine some of his, shall we say, cre-
ative decisions. 
We want to examine the operational 
and organizational changes at the 
Postal Service that have resulted in de-
livery delays across the country, in-
cluding the delays of goods and serv-
ices for small businesses and families, 
as well as critical medicines. 
In my district of the Virgin Islands 
we are hostage to the U.S. Postal Serv-
ice. We cannot drive to big-box stores, 
never mind medicines for our elders or 
our veterans. 
We will review the impact of these 
changes on the rights of eligible Amer-
icans to cast their vote through the 
mail in the November elections, but we 
will also have a few closing questions 
for Mr. DeJoy. 
Is Mr. DeJoy thinking about that 
senior who won’t receive their medi-
cine on time due to his policies? 
Has he thought about the veteran 
who served our Nation and can’t get 
their prescriptions to heal? 
Has he considered rural Americans 
who have to drive 20 miles to the near-
est post office? 
Has he thought about any of these 
people? 
Or is he, like the President, only con-
cerned about his own self-interest? 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Mem-
bers are reminded to refrain from en-
gaging in personalities toward the 
President. 
Mr. COMER. That ship has sailed. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the 
gentleman from North Dakota (Mr. 
ARMSTRONG) who is another valuable 
member. 
Mr. ARMSTRONG. Mr. Speaker, if 
there is a bill that more accurately re-
flects the failure of Democratic leader-
ship for my first 2 years in Congress, I 
don’t know what it is. 
I know that because I came to Con-
gress knowing of the problems with the 
Postal Service. I am the only Repub-
lican on the Oversight and Reform 
Committee who cosponsored the Demo-
crats’ bill to remove the prefunding of 
their pensions. I have been working on 
this, been curious about it, and have 
cared about it for a very long time. 
I supported former Chairman Cum-
mings’ and MARK MEADOWS’ bipartisan 
solution for the Postal Service because 
I represent a rural State, and privatiza-
tion is bad for my constituents. 
But do you know how important this 
has been to the Oversight and Reform 
Committee? 
Our last hearing on the Postal Serv-
ice was in April of 2019. But somehow, 
we have decided that because the pre-
vious Postmaster General who was ap-
pointed in 2015 and didn’t resign until 
June and did something unique in this 
town—made sure just about everybody 
hated her. 
But now we are saying this all blew 
up last week. But it didn’t. I know it 
didn’t because you can Google postal 
problems in any jurisdiction from one 
end of this country to the other and 
you know they have existed before. 
But instead we will come to the floor, 
debate a bill offered and sponsored by 
the chair of the committee of jurisdic-
tion, we will vote on it today, and then 
we will have a hearing on Monday 
about the bill. So before we even talk 
about the fact that we are giving $25 
billion to an organization that already 
has $25 billion cash on hand, and re-
gardless of how you feel about this, $25 
billion does not deliver votes, and we 
have no ability to do this. 
We are doing this in a way that is 
completely and utterly political the-
ater because anybody who has been 
paying attention knows that the post 
office problems are chronic, they are 
not acute. They have lost $70 billion 
since 2007, and they lost $9 billion in 
2019. 
So my question is: Why haven’t we 
been having hearings on this in the 
Committee on Oversight and Reform 
for the 2 years I have been here? 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Mr. Speaker, I would like to re-
spond to the gentleman’s statement 
that the money is not needed. The 
Postal Service sought the $25 billion 
from Congress to provide this critical 
relief, and that request was supported 
unanimously by a vote by the Board of 
Governors who were all appointed by 
President Trump. 
Yesterday we received the report 
from the nonpartisan Congressional 
Budget Office, and that report esti-
mates that the vast majority of this 
funding would, in fact, be needed with-
in fiscal year 2021 to provide services to 
the American people. 
This should be a nonpartisan issue. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the 
gentlewoman 
from 
California 
(Ms. 
WATERS). My good friend is the distin-
guished chairwoman of the Committee 
on Financial Services. 
Ms. WATERS. Mr. Speaker, I ran to 
the floor when I heard that our Mem-
bers on the Republican side of the aisle 
are trying to use as an excuse we have 
not had a hearing. Oh, yes. You have 
had a hearing. You have had a hearing 
from the American people who are 
shocked that the President and DeJoy 
are out there dismantling and destroy-
ing our Postal Service.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4279 
August 22, 2020 
For 3 years I warned the American 
people and my colleagues that this 
President was a threat to our democ-
racy. Yet, here we are today voting on 
a measure to save the Postal Service 
because it is being sabotaged by a des-
perate President in order to cheat in 
the 2020 elections. 
Since our country’s founding, the 
people have relied on the Postal Serv-
ice for everything from delivery of let-
ters to our seniors wanting their medi-
cines delivered on time. Veterans want 
their disability checks on time. Social 
Security recipients want and need 
their money. 
So I want to say to the Members on 
the opposite side of the aisle: You had 
better get some courage. If you are 
afraid of the President, you had better 
step up to the plate on this. We will 
not allow the United States Postal 
Service to be destroyed by you. 
And another message to the Presi-
dent: Stop removing our blue mail-
boxes from our neighborhoods. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Mem-
bers are reminded to refrain from en-
gaging in personalities toward the 
President and to address their remarks 
to the Chair. 
Mr. 
COMER. 
Mr. 
Speaker, 
Ms. 
WATERS forgets that President Obama 
removed 12,000 of those blue boxes that 
she just asked that they quit removing. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the 
gentleman 
from 
Arkansas 
(Mr. 
WESTERMAN). 
Mr. WESTERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I 
rise today in support of frontline, es-
sential rural mail carriers and postal 
workers across my district and Amer-
ica who have continued to go to work 
and do their jobs during the pandemic. 
This is in sharp contrast to many of 
my colleagues across the aisle who 
draw a paycheck but don’t show up to 
vote or do their jobs. 
Mr. Speaker, I also stand in opposi-
tion to H.R. 8015 because it is a sham 
bill that has no future. It doesn’t be-
long on this floor. It belongs in the ar-
chives at the election hoax of the 
month club. 
How 
do 
the 
Democrats 
keep 
a 
straight face while proposing a $25 bil-
lion bailout disguised as election integ-
rity when it would equal about $200 per 
ballot if every voter voted by mail? 
That is preposterous. 
With its current over $14 billion cash 
on hand and access to $10 billion from 
the CARES Act, do we even have to 
keep explaining that the United States 
Postal Service is in a more than ade-
quate financial position to remain 
fully functional well beyond the elec-
tion? 
No. The American people are smarter 
than Democrats give us credit. I be-
lieve most see past the smoke and mir-
rors. The post office is important. It is 
not going anywhere, and this bill has 
nothing to do with a fair election. 
The ranking member and I partici-
pated in a youth organization, and at 
the beginning of each meeting the lead-
er would ask: Why are we here? 
Many of us are asking that question 
today: Why are we here? 
The answer is because this House is 
adrift. This House is a ship without a 
rudder. It lacks vision, it lacks direc-
tion, and, most importantly, it lacks 
leadership. It simply gets tossed to and 
fro by the political wind of the day. 
Mr. Speaker, it didn’t just start. It 
has been that way this whole Congress. 
At a time when America has legitimate 
needs with a pandemic and an economy 
trying to get back on track, it is really 
no surprise that this is the best the left 
can do. House Democrats offer no hope. 
We need change. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Why are we here? 
We are here because the President of 
the United States went on national tel-
evision on Thursday night and said he 
was going to defund the post office. 
That is why we are here. 
Further, he said he didn’t support 
mail-in voting when we know that mil-
lions of Americans will want to vote, 
for health reasons, by mail. That is 
why we are here. 
We are here because we wrote numer-
ous letters to the Postmaster General, 
which he ignored. That is why we are 
here. 
I applaud the Democratic leadership 
for calling us in for this emergency 
meeting to make sure that the post of-
fice is funded. It was funded before we 
even had a Constitution. It is one of 
the pillars of our democracy. It is en-
shrined in our Constitution, and it pro-
vides vital services to Americans who 
need medication, the ability to conduct 
business, and to stay in touch. It binds 
us together as a nation. Most of us do 
not like the fact that the President of 
our 
country 
would 
even 
mention 
defunding the post office. That is why 
we are here. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the 
gentlewoman 
from 
Michigan 
(Mrs. 
LAWRENCE), a very distinguished mem-
ber of the committee who brings valu-
able experience to us as a former mem-
ber of the Postal Service. 
b 1445 
Mrs. LAWRENCE. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the chairwoman for yielding me 
the time. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong 
support of H.R. 8015. This is essential 
legislation to offset the dangerous ac-
tions taken by the Postmaster General 
over the last 2 months. 
We are here today, in addition to 
that, to fund the Postal Service. For 
more than two centuries, the United 
States Postal Service has delivered 
mail to every house in America across 
this country—every single home. It is 
the only Federal organization that 
touches every American every single 
day, 6 days a week, confirming that it 
is an essential government service. 
Today, the current administration 
and the new Postmaster General seem 
to struggle to understand that the 
Postal Service is an essential govern-
ment service authorized by the Con-
stitution. It is not a business to fund 
the bottom line. 
In just the first 2 months of his ten-
ure, without having any postal experi-
ence, this Postmaster General has 
threatened and has taken actions to 
undermine decades of precedence with-
in the Postal Service. 
Today, Congress must act. As my 
chairwoman said, that is why we are 
here. We must act. The Delivering for 
America Act does just that. Along with 
providing the Postal Service with a 
desperately needed $25 billion to offset 
revenue that has been forgone due to 
COVID–19, it also—and this is some-
thing that is very important—this leg-
islation prohibits the Postmaster Gen-
eral from making any operational 
changes that will undermine the Postal 
Service’s ability to fulfill its mission. 
Its mission is to deliver the mail. 
Rain, sleet, snow, gloom of night, the 
Postal Service will deliver the mail. 
Mr. Speaker, we have a Postmaster 
General who has come inside and tried 
to rip it apart from the inside. We will 
say: Cease and desist. 
In addition to us having the goal of 
the Postal Service to deliver the mail, 
our democracy is hinging upon them 
doing that basic job. 
Mr. Speaker, I stand here today to 
say that the money was asked for by 
the Board of Governors—which, by the 
way, is appointed by the President, and 
which, by the way, are all Republicans 
who asked for that money to be appro-
priated. The Postmaster General ap-
proved and said he needed that money 
as well. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank the Speaker for 
bringing this critical legislation to the 
floor. I thank the chairwoman for in-
cluding the language that will prohibit 
the enactment of any rule or standard 
or policy with the intent to delay the 
mail from our government. 
We have a real responsibility here 
today. There is not a Member on either 
side of the aisle who has not received a 
letter from our constituents. Let’s do 
our job. 
Mr. COMER. Mr. Speaker, I have the 
most respect for my friend, the chair-
woman of the Committee on Oversight 
and 
Reform, 
but 
I 
believe 
she 
misspoke. 
She said the President wanted to 
defund the Postal Service. That is not 
what the President wants to do. The 
only time I have heard the word 
‘‘defund’’ lately was by the liberal pro-
gressive wing of the majority party 
that wants to defund the police. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the 
gentleman from Alabama (Mr. PALM-
ER). 
Mr. PALMER. Mr. Speaker, we are 
here today because my Democratic col-
leagues have created a conspiratorial 
crisis out of thin air in another at-
tempt to dupe Americans with an elec-
tion hoax. Only this time, instead of 
Russia, it is the United States Postal 
Service. 
Democrats are intentionally mis-
leading people to believe that the oper-
ational changes at the Postal Service,

August 22, 2020 
including the removal of mailboxes and 
antiquated processing equipment, just 
started. That is a lie. Nonetheless, 
Postal Service officials have confirmed 
that these operational changes, some 
of which were agreed to by Democrat 
Members, have already been halted 
until after the election. 
In regard to the delay and delivery of 
mail over the last few weeks, the na-
tional number cited may well reflect 
delays in cities that have been under 
siege by anarchists. I will direct my 
colleagues and the American people’s 
attention 
to 
these 
photos 
of 
the 
burned-out post office in Minneapolis. 
There is no way to know how many let-
ters to loved ones were lost, or birth-
day cards or gifts or family heirlooms 
or that decoder ring that that kid had 
been waiting for were destroyed and 
will never be delivered. 
I am certain because of the lawless-
ness that the Democrats are dan-
gerously silent about, the delivery of 
mail in Portland, Seattle, Chicago, 
New York, and Minneapolis, and other 
cities have been delayed. 
You want to talk defunding? Instead 
of Democrat mayors defunding the po-
lice, I would submit that we need to 
make sure that law enforcement in 
every American city is well funded so 
that they can protect not just the post 
office facilities that handle our mail, 
but also the people who deliver our 
mail so that those cards, letters, gifts, 
and election ballots can be delivered. 
Instead of pushing a conspiracy farce, 
we should be here making sure that 
law enforcement has the resources 
needed to protect the property and 
lives of American families in these cit-
ies that are under siege. That will help 
make sure the mail is delivered on 
time, and people will feel safe in get-
ting it from the mailbox or the post of-
fice. 
In that regard, the silence of the 
Democrats in this Chamber is deadly. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to 
the 
gentleman 
from 
Massachusetts 
(Mr. NEAL), the distinguished chairman 
of the Committee on Ways and Means. 
Mr. NEAL. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
Chairwoman MALONEY
for her good 
work on this very issue, and I rise to 
condemn Postmaster General DeJoy’s 
assault on the U.S. Postal Service. 
The organizational and operational 
changes he has been implementing are 
a betrayal at this moment of the Amer-
ican people. They are turning their 
backs on seniors and veterans in Pitts-
field, North Adams, Springfield, and 
Southbridge who rely upon the Postal 
Service for their medications and other 
essential services. 
The Postmaster General is disman-
tling a lifeline for people in every com-
munity across the Commonwealth, but 
his actions particularly harm those 
who live in some of the most rural 
areas in western Massachusetts. These 
mail delays and disruptions will be 
harmful at any time, but they are 
downright deadly during this pan-
demic. Families and small businesses 
are desperately trying to stay safe and 
stay afloat as the crisis rages on, and 
the Postal Service plays a critical role 
in their survival. 
Who else suffers due to the Post-
master General’s actions? The hard-
working men and women who process 
and deliver our mail, essential workers. 
He is compromising jobs for genera-
tions that have been a pathway to the 
middle 
class, 
particularly 
in 
marginalized communities. 
Our Nation’s economy and the peo-
ple’s health rely upon the Postal Serv-
ice. So, too, does American democracy. 
Millions will use this indispensable 
tool to cast their ballots this year. 
They should not be discouraged. They 
should be encouraged by the Post-
master General. The Postmaster Gen-
eral is directly attacking the funda-
mental rights and well-being of all 
Americans. 
I call upon him to step down now. His 
removal is urgently needed, as are all 
the provisions in the Delivering for 
America Act. 
Mr. Speaker, I strongly support this 
legislation and call on my colleagues 
to do the same. A reminder: His sup-
port right now is urgently needed to re-
verse what he has been doing and say-
ing. 
Mr. COMER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 
minutes to the gentleman from Ohio 
(Mr. JORDAN). 
Mr. JORDAN. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman for yielding. 
Mr. Speaker, the Democrats talked 
about a slight delay in mail delivery 
the last several weeks. Well, of course. 
Would you want to deliver mail in 
Portland today, cities that have been 
under siege for 90-some days? I bet 
there are delays in Portland, Seattle, 
Minneapolis, Chicago, and New York. I 
bet that is where the delays are. 
In fact, how do you deliver mail to a 
CHOP zone, to a CHAZ zone? How do 
you do that? They won’t let them in. I 
mean, come on. We know the facts 
here. The facts are the post office has 
more money today than they had this 
time last year. 
They got a $14 billion cash reserve. 
They got a $10 billion line of credit we 
gave them in the CARES Act. And oh, 
the Postmaster General is moving 
some sorting machines and removing 
some mail collection boxes, the same 
thing every Postmaster General has al-
ways done. In fact, between 2011 and 
2016, the Obama-Biden administration 
removed 12,000 mail collection boxes. 
Oh, my goodness. And it is happening 
again. 
We are moving some boxes, and 
somehow, that is a reason to give $25 
billion to the Postal Service and create 
all this ‘‘conspiracy theory’’—not my 
words; The Wall Street Journal called 
it—that the Democrats are doing. 
What is really going on here? If you 
really wanted to focus on some con-
cerns the post office has, we have a bi-
partisan bill that the late Chairman 
Cummings and MARK MEADOWS worked 
on. MARK MEADOWS, I don’t even think 
the Democrats—I know the chair-
woman hasn’t even talked to him 
about this, the expert on this issue on 
our side. Oh, by the way, he happens to 
have a pretty important job in this 
town, a pretty important job, and you 
guys didn’t even talk to him. 
They had a bipartisan bill. If you 
really want to work on bipartisan con-
cerns and solutions to some problems 
in the post office, that is fine, but that 
is not what this is about. This is all 
about politics. 
You don’t want to address real issues, 
too busy defunding the police, too busy 
not denouncing the mob that is run-
ning so many of our cities. This is all 
about politics. 
First, it was the Russian collusion. In 
this committee, it was the Michael 
Cohen hearing. I remember that, when 
he came, the first big hearing of this 
Congress. The first-announced witness 
of this committee came and lied to us 
seven times. Then, it was the Mueller 
report. Then, it was the Ukraine fake 
impeachment. And now, it is the White 
House is putting mailboxes in cages 
and whatever you are saying now. 
Mr. Speaker, the American people 
see this for what it is. They see this for 
what it is. If you want real solutions, 
we could have had them. You could 
have worked with Chief of Staff Mead-
ows. You didn’t want to do that. You 
wanted politics. 
This was said earlier: If anyone 
should know, it should be the chair-
woman of this committee who had to 
wait 6 weeks after election day to get 
the results of her election. 
Imagine what the Democrats want to 
do is throw live ballots out there to ev-
eryone. That was just one congres-
sional primary election. Imagine what 
they want to do—150 million live bal-
lots. That is what the Democrats want. 
Imagine what that is going to be like. 
That is where these guys want to go. 
Mr. Speaker, we should be working 
on real solutions instead of this cha-
rade that the Democrats are putting us 
through. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to 
the gentleman from California (Mr. 
GOMEZ), the vice chair and an out-
standing member of the Committee on 
Oversight and Reform. 
Mr. GOMEZ. Mr. Speaker, someone is 
lying. On one side, you have the White 
House and the Postmaster General. On 
the other side, you have the hard-
working men and women of the U.S. 
Postal Service. 
The President and the Postmaster 
General say there is nothing to see 
here. Nothing to see. They tell us that 
their operational changes are meant to 
help the Postal Service. 
The Postal Service workers, whose 
job it is to deliver the mail day in and 
day out, are saying something dif-
ferent. They are telling us that they 
are falling behind on processing pack-
ages 
because 
of 
these 
operational 
changes. As a result, they are seeing

bugs and rodents swimming around 
containers of rotten food and meat and 
animals. 
Now, my Republican colleagues say 
that this is a conspiracy theory. But I 
say to them: You can’t smell a con-
spiracy theory. There are dying ani-
mals, rotten food, rotten meat, rats, 
flies. 
You can’t see that in a conspiracy 
theory. I want them to open their eyes 
because their constituents, my con-
stituents, are suffering because of this 
deliberate attempt to sabotage the U.S. 
Postal Service. Their constituents— 
seniors and veterans who depend on 
fast delivery of their medicines, the 
small businesses that depend on the 
U.S. Postal Service to stay afloat, and 
every American who wants to partake 
in our democracy safely during this 
pandemic. 
Mr. Speaker, I can tell you which 
side I believe: the employees of the 
U.S. Postal Service. It is with them in 
mind that I strongly support the pas-
sage of H.R. 8015, the Delivering for 
America Act. 
Mr. COMER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from Cali-
fornia (Mr. MCCARTHY), the Republican 
leader. 
Mr. MCCARTHY. ‘‘I urge everyone to 
be calm. . . . The Postal Service is not 
incapacitated. It is still fully capable 
of delivering the mail.’’ 
Those are not my words I speak. 
Those aren’t even words of a Repub-
lican. They are the words of Ruth 
Goldway, a Democrat, a former Postal 
Commissioner and Clinton appointee 
who served for 18 years under three 
Presidents. 
Based on the facts, Goldway says the 
Postal Service is perfectly capable of 
handling election mail. 
b 1500 
Unfortunately, we have got bad news 
for her. This majority didn’t get the 
message. Instead of listening to the ex-
perts or following the facts, Democrats 
are wasting precious time spreading 
Speaker PELOSI’s mailbox myths. 
You had an opportunity to have bi-
partisanship. I have heard words on 
this floor today, Mr. Speaker, ‘‘essen-
tial,’’ ‘‘critical’’ that we are here. I ap-
plaud the few Democrats on the other 
side who were willing to show. 
I know if you cannot make it today, 
you have to sign paperwork that your 
health will not allow you to be here. 
And the Speaker is bringing us back on 
a Saturday because it is so critical to 
be here right now, in this moment, in 
this time, but one-third on the other 
side must think otherwise. 
Now, let’s go through some of the 
myths versus facts. 
Myth no. 1: The Postal Service is 
being sabotaged. 
The Postal Service is properly funded 
for the election and beyond. We said it 
many times here. It is funded com-
pletely through August 2021. That is 
according to the Postal Service. 
The Postal Service has long-term 
challenges, but they predate anything 
about this administration. It isn’t 
being sabotaged. 
Myth no. 2: Removing mailboxes 
from public places is uncommon and 
cause for alarm. 
This is shocking. We have got coun-
try-western stars putting this up on 
Instagram. We need to rush back here 
on Saturday. But little did we know 
that, during the Obama-Biden years, 
nearly 12,000 mailboxes were removed 
from communities. Never once did we 
rush in on a Saturday to have a bill 
that you didn’t have marked up and 
one-third of the Democrats would not 
show. 
The Postal Service is actually con-
stantly moving mailboxes from low- to 
high-volume growth areas, kind of a 
smart thing to do. In some cases, they 
replace 
them 
with 
more 
modern 
versions. I saw a picture where they ac-
tually had a lock in the front. 
If you have townhall meetings, you 
will find out a lot of mail gets stolen, 
so they were protecting the packages 
but still allowing you to put the letter 
in. This isn’t voter suppression. It is 
routine maintenance. 
Myth no. 3: The Postal Service 
doesn’t have the capacity to handle 
more absentee ballots. 
The Postal Service delivers 471 mil-
lion pieces of mail on an average day. 
Little known fact: People mail less 
every single year. With all of the ad-
vancements we put in the Postal Serv-
ice, with the technology of our own 
life, do you know what year equalled 
471 million? About exactly what we did 
in 1985. 
But we do it different than 1985. We 
have more technology. And because of 
that, the Postmaster General actually 
refuted the capacity in no uncertain 
terms to the Senate yesterday. 
The Postal Service released this: If 
all Americans vote by mail, 330 million 
ballots over the course of this election, 
it would only be 75 percent of what 
they deliver in a single day. 
Now, I don’t want to claim, Mr. 
Speaker, that all the Democrats think 
this is a myth. Maybe that is why one- 
third didn’t show today. I am not sure. 
They said their health was bad. I am 
not sure if that is the case either. 
Even The New York Times isn’t buy-
ing the House Democrats’ obvious 
untruths. As it was reported earlier 
this month: Experts agree that the 
Postal Service has the raw capacity to 
absorb the additional ballots, even if 
150 million people decided to vote by 
mail. 
Myth no. 4: The Democrats’ legisla-
tion will make the Postal Service fis-
cally sustainable. 
You are not fixing any of the fun-
damentals. You are not even taking 
the bill that you spent years on, with a 
Republican and a Democrat, with Eli-
jah Cummings and MARK
MEADOWS, 
two who would say they come from dif-
ferent walks of life, from a philosophy, 
but found common ground when it 
came to the post office, to really fix 
the core of what the problems are. But 
that is not why we are here today. 
So, as the Democrats perpetuate this 
sad 
political 
stunt, 
unfortunately, 
there is serious business that goes 
unmet. But it shows real priority. 
This week, we learned that 71 percent 
of small businesses have used their en-
tire paycheck protection loan—they 
spent it all—and 46 percent anticipate 
that they will need more financial sup-
port over the next 12 months. But that 
wasn’t critical enough to be here, be-
cause these are real people with real 
families. They don’t expect miracles 
from us, but they do expect us to at 
least care. Unfortunately, not one 
piece of legislation in this so-called 
emergency session is about the fami-
lies or their future. 
Nor are we working to protect vac-
cine research and support Operation 
Warp Speed. No, House Democrats are 
doing what they have done for the last 
2 years: They are putting politics be-
fore people. 
Last month, Speaker PELOSI said to 
us: 
We 
can’t 
go 
home 
until 
a 
coronavirus relief package is complete. 
I guess we know that is not true. I 
wonder if she wants to keep her word 
this time as well, but I guess we will go 
home this Saturday. But good news for 
one-third of the Democrats: They don’t 
have to go anywhere. They are already 
home. When she did not get her liberal 
wish list, she sent Members home. And 
I guess good news for some Americans: 
Those who stayed home and voted, 
they still got paid. 
But those small businesses that are 
running out, that we are here in this 
body right now that we could do some-
thing about, or those who are on unem-
ployment 
we 
could 
do 
something 
about—you have the majority; we 
don’t. We are not allowed to bring it to 
the floor; you can. But you picked a 
crisis of something that is already 
funded. 
They can’t spend the money you 
want to give them. Why? Because they 
have got $14 billion sitting in the bank 
and another $10 billion they could pull 
from. But the small businesses don’t. 
The families that can’t pay their rent, 
they don’t. And what about the vac-
cine? 
But you did do something this week. 
You 
extended 
the 
shadow 
voting 
scheme, granting yourselves permis-
sion to vote from home until October 2. 
Mr. Speaker, I will take a bet. I will 
make a bet on this floor right now, 
maybe even a prediction. I bet that 
gets extended again and probably goes 
a few days past the election in Novem-
ber. 
Who would like to take that bet with 
me? How much do you want to get that 
extended all the way through? 
What does that mean to the Amer-
ican people? Well, it means the major-
ity party, the Democrats, have cast 
over 2,520 votes—and counting—from 
home. That is just unconstitutional. It 
doesn’t matter that it is such a big cri-
sis that we are called back. There is 
plenty of room on the floor on the 
other side.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4282 
August 22, 2020 
It means a Democrat Member can 
dial in from his boat to vote. I am not 
making that up. That actually hap-
pened. 
It means another Democrat can play 
hooky to go watch a space shuttle 
launch that isn’t even in his own dis-
trict. 
It means Democrats collect a pay-
check while the hardworking taxpayers 
have to pay for their vacation. 
And today, it means that 68 Demo-
crats—one-third 
of 
their 
Caucus— 
didn’t even care enough to show up for 
this so-called emergency session. 
It is critical. I have heard you say it. 
We cannot wait. We cannot wait one 
day. We need to be here and now. Now, 
I believe that is true, but not about the 
post office; about those millions of 
Americans who need us to act. 
Every time we brought legislation to 
this floor dealing with the COVID situ-
ation, it seems to me the Speaker has 
been able to hold it up. I don’t know. 
Maybe you want to try to hold it up 
past the election. It seems to me that 
would be playing politics. It seems to 
me that would be a dereliction of duty. 
It is not how you empower the people’s 
voice in Washington; it is how you di-
lute it. This is leadership malpractice. 
This is shameful and this is embar-
rassing. 
Mr. Speaker, our first Postmaster 
General, whom I have heard people 
speak of, Ben Franklin, could have 
been talking about this majority when 
he said: ‘‘Lost time is never found 
again.’’ 
As a majority, Democrats have been 
more focused on distractions than solu-
tions for the American people, from the 
weakest, most partisan impeachment 
in American history to politicizing the 
pandemic and stopping relief for work-
ers and families and, now, spreading a 
debunked conspiracy theory about the 
Postal Service. 
Mr. Speaker, Democrats have failed 
the American public. They have failed 
the laid-off workers, the families, the 
students who are waiting for help; the 
small 
businesses, 
the 
doctors, 
the 
nurses, they are waiting for help; the 
researchers, the scientists who are de-
veloping a vaccine, they are waiting for 
help. But this majority said no. 
They did, however, say yes to China. 
On this floor, just a few weeks ago, 
there was a bill to sanction anyone 
who would hack into our companies, 
into our institutions that are working 
on a vaccine faster than ever before— 
that would only slow it down—to save 
lives. 
We had an opportunity to tell those 
countries: Work with us; don’t steal 
from us. But your voice was heard loud 
and clear, all the Democrats who 
showed up that day. More than two- 
thirds of you voted ‘‘no’’ on the same 
day that it was reported that two Chi-
nese were hacking into our vaccine. 
That is what you said. 
I heard the majority leader say it 
was an MTR. Yes, it was. 
Why was it an MTR? Because you 
don’t give us an amendment. 
Why was it an MTR? Because at the 
moment in time, it was essential, it 
was critical. It was reported on that 
day. You could act that day. The coun-
try needed us to act, but you said no. 
You stood up for the Chinese that day. 
I do not know what the Chinese Com-
munist Party has on the Democrats, 
Mr. Speaker, but it must be powerful. 
It must be so powerful. 
I know there are bills in the Senate 
that have passed that would hold them 
accountable, but they can’t come to 
the floor. 
I have read the reports from the FBI 
that they are playing in this campaign, 
that they do have a person they want 
to win, to put a new person in office, 
but that is not critical to you. 
It is critical that we come today to 
provide $25 billion to an organization 
that Republicans and Democrats, that 
are the commissioners, say they do not 
need. 
Why do they not need it? Because 
they looked at their own bank account 
and realized they have $14 billion. They 
do not need it because, in the CARES 
Act, we gave them another $10 billion 
to sit there. They do not need it be-
cause they said they could deliver 
every piece of mail, that it would be 
only 75 percent of what they do in a 
single day. 
Mr. Speaker, I do not want to say all 
the Democrats feel that way, because 
one-third of them didn’t show up for 
work today even though their own 
leader, the Speaker, said they needed 
to come, even though, when we passed 
on this floor something different than 
we haven’t done in more than 230 years, 
to let somebody stay home, be on a 
boat, call in, and still get paid, you 
said you could not do that. You could 
only do it if your health was at need. I 
am not quite sure a hospital is on a 
boat in a lake, but to Democrats it 
must be. 
They won’t vote on a bill that I pro-
pose 
to 
sanction 
Chinese-affiliated 
hackers who attack our vaccine re-
search. I am not sure that is partisan. 
I thought that was pure American. 
They won’t help working Americans. 
They won’t help protect our vaccines. 
But, yes, they stood that day proudly 
supporting of the Chinese Communist 
Party. 
I am sorry, Mr. Speaker. America’s 
too great for a vision so small with our 
challenges before us. 
We showed up. But you know why we 
showed up? We showed up for the small 
businesses. We showed up for those who 
are unemployed. We showed up for 
those school districts that want to find 
a way to open safely. We showed up for 
the doctors and the nurses. 
I know, when I look up on the board, 
there will be a lot of Democrat votes. I 
don’t know where those one-third are. 
Maybe they are on the boat. Maybe 
they are watching a spaceship. I am 
not sure. Maybe some are watching 
Oprah. 
But one thing I do know, it is essen-
tial that we are here. But we should be 
here for other reasons. We should be 
here for the reasons that the American 
public expect us to. 
Mr. Speaker, we can do so much bet-
ter. This country needs us. We should 
rise to the occasion, not fall for a vi-
sion so small as what I see today. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Mem-
bers are reminded to address their re-
marks to the Chair. 
b 1515 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to 
the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. 
HOYER), the distinguished majority 
leader. 
Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I had not 
necessarily intended to speak after the 
minority leader, but I cannot help but 
respond to some of what the minority 
leader had to say. 
First of all, he practices the Presi-
dent’s favorite tactic. Distract. Speak 
about that which is not relevant. All 
the Democrats are voting. They may be 
voting at that machine. They may be 
voting at that machine over there. 
They may be voting at that machine, 
or they may be voting at that machine 
back there. They may be voting by 
proxy, which you didn’t like. The mi-
nority leader sued, and the Court said 
it is up to the House to decide its own 
rules. 
Now, when we passed the HEROES 
Act 100 days ago tomorrow, what did 
the minority leader say? Let’s wait and 
see what happens. And what has hap-
pened since then? Thousands, tens of 
thousands of people have gotten sick, 
and thousands and thousands of people 
have died in those days. Let’s wait and 
see. 
And what did the majority leader, 
who can put a bill on the floor, what 
did he say? Let the States go bankrupt. 
Mr. Speaker, there has been a lot of 
talk on the floor about bring this bill 
or that bill or the other bill. The Sen-
ate is controlled by your party, I tell 
my minority friends in the House. 
They haven’t passed a single bill in 70 
days, in 100 days, not a single bill. 
Why? Because they would have to com-
promise. 
And you say we need to bring things 
to the floor. The minority leader, of 
course, had a man named Garland, 
from February to January when Obama 
was the President of the United States, 
and refused to consider it. Do you 
think there is a Founding Father who 
thought that advice and consent meant 
that they could simply ignore the 
President’s nominations? I think not. 
Some people talk about, Oh, there 
are some very, very important things 
to do. One of them, the gentlewoman 
from North Carolina—now, let me, 
84,631 deaths since HEROES passed. 
Let’s wait. We passed HEROES. No ac-
tion in the Republican-controlled and 
led United States Senate. So don’t 
whine to me about what you want on 
the floor. Don’t whine to me about we 
could have done this, we could have 
done that, we could have done the 
other.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4283 
August 22, 2020 
Mr. Speaker, I was just talking to 
the chief of staff of the White House, 
and I kidded him, I said, You know, 
when you were here in the House and 
we had Republican leadership and they 
offered 
solutions, 
you 
undermined 
them. 
Who says so? John Boehner says so. 
You had the opportunity to make a 
deal. 
Now we control the House, and very 
frankly, the majority leader cannot 
pass a bill because 20 of your Members 
in the United States Senate want to do 
nothing, and just tell the people who 
are suffering, who are on unemploy-
ment, who don’t have childcare, you 
are on your own. 
Now, I have heard all this talk about 
what we could have done. Do it. Do it. 
NANCY PELOSI and Secretary Mnuchin 
got four deals done. Most of you voted 
for them, and they passed overwhelm-
ingly in a bipartisan fashion. But you 
made a decision, nope, no more. 
Now we have it speculated that if we 
don’t take action and have a much 
more robust—and a plan for dealing 
with COVID–19, which we don’t have 
and haven’t had, because this President 
called it a hoax. You don’t have to re-
spond to hoaxes. That is what he called 
it, a hoax. And, of course, if it is a hoax 
you don’t respond, and he didn’t. 
And over 175,000—86,000 since we 
passed HEROES—175,000, and CDC says 
it may be up to 200,000 by the end of 
this year. Still, you have passed no bill 
in the United States. 
We sent a bill over there. You don’t 
like it, that is fine, pass your own. You 
control the Senate. Pass your own, and 
then we will go to conference. We will 
see which bill is better, or maybe we 
will put them together. But what has 
the Senate majority leader done? He 
has reduced the $1 trillion offer down 
to $500 billion, which the governor of 
my State says is only sufficient to help 
the States because they are hem-
orrhaging revenue, and they are on the 
front lines of responding to this crisis. 
Now, others of you have said all of 
this is a feign, this is not real. 
Mr. Speaker, I ask Madam Chair, has 
she spoken about the report from the 
Postmaster General? 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Yes, I have. 
Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, let me re-
peat it, notwithstanding that. 
It says, ‘‘The new documents being 
released by the committee today are 
part of the PMG briefing.’’ 
Now, I hope the Postmaster General, 
unlike the President of the United 
States, reads his briefings. 
The President says he doesn’t read 
his briefings, so he didn’t know about 
the Russian payments to kill American 
soldiers and has not responded to this 
date on that assertion. 
The new documents being released by 
the committee today are part of the 
PMG briefing, a presentation prepared 
directly for the Postmaster General 
last week on August 12, 10 days ago. 
They provide a detailed assessment of 
service performance trends over the 
past year. 
My friend from Ohio says, Oh, this is 
a fraud. There is no problem. Not a big 
deal. Maybe he didn’t read the PMG ad-
visory either. 
According to these documents, there 
has been a significant drop in service 
standards across the board beginning 
in July, including first-class, mar-
keting, periodicals, and priority mail. 
The Postmaster General, of course, 
has never admitted to the sweeping 
delays and reductions in service caused 
by the actions. Instead, here is what he 
said: ‘‘We all feel bad about what the 
dip in the level of service has been.’’ 
So he knows there was a dip in serv-
ice right after he made these changes. 
Now, what do we know? 
A, we know he is a big supporter of 
the President, gave a lot of money to 
the President. 
Secondly, we know he was appointed 
by the President. Essentially, yes, 
elected by the Board of Governors—all 
thanks to the membership appointed 
by President Trump—who, by the way, 
unanimously asked for the $25 billion 
we are talking about. 
We know the President of the United 
States wants to suppress the vote. 
Why? 
He says so. He says so. 
The first meeting I had with the 
President of the United States with Re-
publican leaders and Democratic lead-
ers just shortly after he was inaugu-
rated President, the first thing he said 
was, I got a majority of the votes. 
If it hadn’t been fraud, if it hadn’t 
been all those people that voted ille-
gally, I would have gotten the majority 
of votes. He only got 62 million. 70 mil-
lion voted for somebody else. And 65 
million people, the majority of the peo-
ple of the United States voting for 
President of the United States, voted 
for Hillary Clinton. 
I challenge one of you to name me 
two members of the electoral college in 
2016. You can’t do it. The American 
people voted for Hillary Clinton. 
The President of the United States 
wants to send, maybe with no name 
tags and just sort of brown suits on, 
troops to the polls of America. Never in 
my life—and I have run probably for of-
fice more times than anybody here but 
DON YOUNG—never have I seen armed 
troops there at the polls to intimidate 
people. 
My State checks for fraud. And, by 
the way, all those fraudulent votes 
that Donald Trump said had been cast, 
not a conviction. He controls the Jus-
tice Department. He controls, presum-
ably, the FBI. 
Going back to what I said about this 
crisis that was occurring that you say 
doesn’t exist in the post office. 
On January 15, 2013, we voted for a 
crisis, 50 million Americans living in 
the northeast had been savaged by 
Superstorm Sandy. About 230 of you 
Republicans were here, you were in 
charge. Only 49 of you, not Mr. MEAD-
OWS, not Ms. FOXX, 49 voted for that 
bill, and 178 of you voted no. No crisis. 
50 
million 
Americans. 
Superstorm 
Sandy. People being flooded out of 
their businesses and homes. No crisis. 
My suggestion is, wherever you are, 
you came here and that’s great, you 
are here, you can vote in person. Isn’t 
that wonderful. I think your vote 
would count just as much if you had 
voted—but your leadership has told 
you, no, don’t worry about the 86,000 
people who have died. The minority 
leader said, well, the crisis is gone. I 
don’t know where he thinks it went. It 
is certainly visiting the neighborhoods 
in my State and the neighborhoods in 
your State. 
So the report says the mail has sub-
stantially gone down since the Post-
master General—aiding and abetting, 
in my opinion, the President of the 
United States who wishes to suppress 
the vote—acted. 
Now, I don’t know how many of you 
read 18 U.S. Code 1703, but it says, 
‘‘Whoever being a Postal Service offi-
cer or employee’’—and says some other 
things about secrets, destroys, detains, 
opens, 
et 
cetera—‘‘whoever 
delays 
mail, which was intended to be con-
veyed by mail, shall be fined under this 
title or imprisoned not more than 5 
years, or both.’’ 
Now, I had a press conference with 
Senator WARNER, Senator VAN HOLLEN, 
and six other Members, including EL-
EANOR HOLMES NORTON, one of the sen-
ior members of the Chair’s committee. 
Five minutes before we held that press 
conference, the Postmaster General 
issued his statement that he was going 
to stop doing what he was doing. I 
guess it was because he thought, Well, 
what I am doing is great, everybody 
will support what I am doing. Or, did 
he think, I got my hand caught in the 
cookie jar and I better stop? Which do 
you think is the more rational deter-
mination as to why 5 minutes before he 
had that press conference he issued his 
release? That he thought it was fine? 
He could defend it? It was the right 
thing to do? 
If he thought all of those, why in 
heaven’s name did he change his mind? 
I will tell you why. He knew what he 
did was wrong. He probably read that 
briefing that service had plummeted 
since he took that action, and that he 
was putting the mail, prescription 
drugs, Social Security checks, vet-
erans’ checks, at risk. 
That seems to me to be the logical 
conclusion. And as the law says, if you 
act and you delay the mail, you com-
mit a crime, subject to 5 years in jail, 
and a substantial fine. 
b 1530 
Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentle-
woman for her leadership. 
The Postmaster General appeared to 
back down from his attempt to set the 
Postal Service up for failure just mo-
ments before a number of us, as I have 
said, from the House and Senate were 
about to speak in front of the Postal 
Service headquarters right down the 
street.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4284 
August 22, 2020 
In his testimony yesterday, the Post-
master General indicated that he and 
President Trump are simply hitting 
pause. They don’t care about the dimi-
nution of service that the Postmaster 
General’s report said, apparently. They 
just hit pause. Why? Because they are 
hoping it will go away, the wrongdoing 
that they are perpetrating, not what 
was done in the past by, yes: Should we 
make service efficient and effective? 
We should. But that is not why this 
was done. 
All you have to do is look at the 
President’s statement about wanting 
to suppress the vote, particularly of 
minorities. He said that if more Blacks 
had voted in the last election, I would 
have lost. That is what he said. 
In his statement on Tuesday, the 
Postmaster General indicated that no 
additional changes would be imple-
mented. In other words, he is not going 
to back up, even though his report says 
it is diminishing service. Why? He can 
pledge all he wants, but if you don’t 
give the post office department and its 
employees the tools with which to do 
the job, no matter what he says about 
voting—I am glad that we make sure 
that first-class mail treatment—as a 
matter of fact, there ought to be super- 
first class. 
Voting for the President of the 
United States has got to be the most 
important thing a citizen does in this 
election year, and it ought to be treat-
ed as such by the postal department. 
Even 
after 
3 
months, 
President 
Trump and Senate Republicans con-
tinue to refuse to take action on the 
HEROES Act. I talked about that. That 
is why Congress needs to take action 
now that will ensure our Postal Service 
can continue to deliver for America 
through this pandemic, just as it al-
ways has reliably delivered for our peo-
ple. That is why this legislation is nec-
essary. 
Millions depend on the Postal Serv-
ice to obtain medications, receive pay-
checks, and access vital services. For 
rural communities, in particular, the 
Postal Service—that is the irony. For 
rural communities, the Postal Service 
is probably even more important. 
This year, in particular, it will play a 
crucial role, the Postal Service, in 
helping tens of millions of Americans 
stay safe from COVID–19. 86,000 Ameri-
cans have died since we passed the HE-
ROES Act. The minority leader seems 
to think: Well, people not coming to 
Congress, not wanting to get on an air-
plane, not wanting to come to Wash-
ington and then go home and have to 
sequester themselves for 14 days, oh, 
they are just playing games. 
If you doubt the validity of their 
vote, say so. But whether I cast it far 
over there or near here, it is the same 
vote. It is my vote, and it is my peo-
ple’s voice. 
It was so angering for Americans 
across the political spectrum that 
President Trump and Postmaster Gen-
eral DeJoy openly sabotaged the Postal 
Service in order to prevent people from 
casting votes through the mail. I know 
you can discount the fact that the 
President wants to suppress the vote. 
He said so. I am not making it up. He 
said so. Oh, we have all the fraud. 
By the way, he votes by mail, of 
course. You all understand that. I don’t 
know that he sends an ID card down 
when he votes. Well, maybe we ought 
to check on that. You are so interested 
in ID cards, let’s see if the President of 
the United States sends an ID card 
down to Florida. 
They employed tactics such as elimi-
nating overtime pay, cutting routes 
short, reassigning experienced man-
agers, et cetera. 
Maybe you guys and gals don’t have 
a constituent office open. But every 
one of my Members tells me they are 
hearing from thousands of their people. 
Congress, therefore, must take action 
to prevent them from simply changing 
their minds and causing massive postal 
delays in the weeks ahead. Remember, 
he said he has just delayed his changes, 
which caused the fall in service. 
Delivering for America Act, that is 
what the postal department has done 
since 
before 
the 
Constitution 
was 
adopted. I am not going to go through 
what it will require. You know what it 
will require. But it would particularly 
require, and I am so pleased, Madam 
Chair, that you included in your bill 
first-class treatment because voting is 
first-class priority in America. 
Now, I am going to close with this 
because so many of you said: This bill 
is not going to pass. You are wasting 
your time. You shouldn’t send it over 
there. 
If we did that, we wouldn’t do any-
thing unless the President said you can 
do it. Then, we would salute and say: 
‘‘Yes, sir. We will do it. But if you 
don’t want it, sir, if you don’t want 
FISA—126 of us voted for FISA, but if 
you don’t want it, we will change our 
minds in 24 hours,’’ which is what you 
did. 
But then again, we wouldn’t have 
sent campaign finance reform over 
there because MCCONNELL hasn’t con-
sidered it. We wouldn’t have sent in-
vestment and infrastructure and jobs, 
which MCCONNELL has not put on the 
floor. We wouldn’t have sent restoring 
voting rights or ensuring LGBT equal-
ity or protecting Dreamers or ensuring 
equal pay for women because MCCON-
NELL hasn’t put equal pay for women 
on the floor. 
Requiring 
background 
checks 
for 
safer communities, only 90 percent of 
Americans are for that, so I can under-
stand why MCCONNELL
said: Look, 
there is 10 percent against it. I am not 
going to put it on the floor for consid-
eration. 
You say you haven’t gotten notice, 
and you haven’t been included in the 
committee, 
et 
cetera. 
MCCONNELL 
doesn’t allow anybody to vote, your 
leader. 
Meeting the challenge of climate 
change, well, of course, many of you 
don’t believe climate change is real. I 
understand that. 
Providing for justice in policing, did 
we send it over there? Yes. Why? Be-
cause we want a fair, more just, more 
equal, more racially conscious Nation. 
And I say racially conscious in the 
sense that we don’t judge people on the 
color of their skin. 
We strengthened and expanded the 
ACA, which in a pandemic may well 
have been very helpful. It hasn’t been 
put on the floor. 
Protecting workers’ rights to orga-
nize and receive their pensions, it 
hasn’t been put on the floor. 
So, if you tell me this can’t pass, it 
can’t pass perhaps because the Presi-
dent of the United States tells you that 
he is not for it, and so it doesn’t pass. 
In closing—and I know many of you 
have said thank God—in closing, let me 
say that you ought to vote for this bill. 
Not for Democrats. You ought to vote 
for it for your people, for the people in 
your rural neighborhoods who are 
counting on the postal department to 
bring that prescription drug, which is 
critical to maintain their health or 
save their lives. You ought to vote for 
it for the over 1 million people getting 
Social Security checks in the mail. 
That is why you ought to vote for it, 
not for us. 
You ought to vote for it because you 
want everybody to vote; you want ev-
erybody to participate in this democ-
racy; you want an election that has, 
like so many other countries, 80 per-
cent of our people participating, who 
don’t want to be the 86,001 who die be-
cause they went someplace and aggre-
gated together and got COVID–19. 
That is what this is about, making 
our people able to participate safely in 
their democracy. 
Vote for this bill. It is not a partisan 
bill. It is a bill that says Republicans 
ought to be safe in voting. Democrats 
ought to be safe in voting. Independ-
ents ought to be safe in voting, if that 
is what they choose to do. 
This is a good bill. It is a bill for 
America’s democracy. It is a bill for 
making sure that our people are con-
nected through the mail. 
I thank the chair for bringing this 
bill to the floor. Vote ‘‘yes.’’ I urge a 
‘‘yes’’ vote for all Members. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Mem-
bers are reminded to refrain from en-
gaging in personalities toward the 
President and to direct their remarks 
to the Chair. 
Mr. COMER. Mr. Speaker, may I in-
quire as to how much time is remain-

response to misinformation and con-
spiracies online. 
Since the closure of the Toledo, Ohio, 
processing plant in 2012, mail in north-
west 
Ohio 
has 
been 
sent 
to 
the 
Metroplex 
Processing 
Facility 
in 
Michigan. As my constituents can at-
test, this new arrangement has not 
worked. We have experienced countless 
delays and destroyed and lost mail for 
years, including more than 1,000 absen-
tee ballots in the 2016 general election. 
That is why I have continuously en-
gaged with the USPS to fix these prob-
lems and get our mail sorted in Ohio. 
They have committed to working with 
me and officials in Ohio to implement 
procedures for election materials. 
Unfortunately, under H.R. 8015, the 
USPS would be prohibited from mak-
ing any changes to their operation if it 
is determined that the changes would 
impede prompt, reliable, and efficient 
services. 
It doesn’t specifically say who will be 
making this determination, so it is safe 
to assume it will be the unelected bu-
reaucrats, individuals who have told 
me for years that the preferred way to 
sort 
mail 
would 
be 
through 
the 
Metroplex. Now, this bill could legally 
prohibit absentee ballots from being 
processed in Ohio-based sorting facili-
ties. 
I cannot in good conscience support 
this new Democratic political sideshow 
because it threatens the rights of my 
constituents to have their voices heard 
in November. 
Madam Speaker, I urge a ‘‘no’’ vote 
on this legislation. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Madam Speaker, I yield 3 min-
utes to the gentleman from South 
Carolina (Mr. CLYBURN), the distin-
guished majority whip. 
Mr. CLYBURN. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentlewoman for yielding. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today in sup-
port of H.R. 8015, the Delivering for 
America Act. This legislation is vital 
to protecting the United States Postal 
Service. 
I maintain that the post office is the 
thread that holds the fabric of our 
great country together. The Postal 
Service existed before our Nation’s 
Constitution as the lifeline that con-
nected 
far-flung 
communities. 
The 
Founders believed so strongly in the 
importance of the post office that they 
enshrined it in our Constitution. 
The post office provides a critical 
public service that we cannot allow to 
become a potential political pawn of a 
dysfunctional, destructive, and, I dare 
say, disastrous administration. This 
administration has demonstrated time 
and again why government should not 
be run like a business. Businesses exist 
to make profits. The post office and the 
whole of our government exist to pro-
vide services. That is why it is called a 
Postal Service, not the postal corpora-
tion. 
Today, we are acting to reinforce our 
Postal Service system, which provides 
vital services like delivering medica-
tions, Social Security benefits, income 
and tax payments, veterans benefits, 
Census forms, and absentee ballots to 
all American communities, however re-
mote they may be. 
Americans’ dependence on the Postal 
Service 
has 
dramatically 
increased 
during this pandemic as we have 
watched the on-time delivery of mail 
decrease significantly. This legislation 
provides the $25 billion in emergency 
COVID funding to the Postal Service 
that was unanimously requested by the 
bipartisan Board of Governors. 
It also prohibits and even rolls back 
changes made by the post office since 
January 1 of this year. That prohibi-
tion lasts through January 2021 or 
until the end of the pandemic, which-
ever is later. 
That means no post office can be 
closed, consolidated, or reduce hours; 
no prohibition or restriction of over-
time pay; no changes that will delay 
mail delivery or increase the volume of 
undelivered mail; and no removal of 
post office infrastructure, like sorting 
machines or mailboxes. 
This legislation protects the integ-
rity of our democracy by requiring 
that all election mail be treated as 
first class, which means ballots must 
be postmarked, processed, and cleared 
on the same day that they are received.

DEMOCRATS FUEL POST OFFICE PANIC WITH 
LIES TO WIN UPCOMING ELECTION 
(By Andy Biggs) 
There are two almost immutable laws of 
operation that form the basis of America’s 
political left. The first is that Democrats 
and leftists foment fear in order to obtain 
and maintain political power. The other is 
that they always accuse everyone else, con-
servatives and Republicans, of acts, words 
and ideas in which the left is engaged. 
If that means that the truth must be adul-
terated in order to craft a narrative that 
gins up panic and hysteria, they will shade 
the truth. Lies beget panic, panic calls for a 
solution—usually a big spending solution— 
and the Democrats try to exploit that panic 
to get more power. 
The 
Democrats 
are 
engaged 
in 
a 
disinformation campaign regarding the up-
coming election and mail-in ballots that is 
deceptive and reflective of their goal of win-
ning the election by hook or crook. 
Democrats and their left-wing publicists in 
the media claim that President Trump is 
going to dismantle the United States Postal 
Service (USPS). This absurdity typifies both 
of the Democratic strategies: It is a lie to en-
gender panic, and the stealing of the election 
is their objective, not the president’s. 
They claim that Mr. Trump is going to fis-
cally starve the behemoth USPS in order to 
prevent all mailed ballots from being count-
ed. Of course, neither claim is true. 
The president signed a bill that provided 
an additional $10 billion to the USPS just a 
few weeks ago. At the time, Treasury Sec-
retary Steve Mnuchin said, ‘‘While the USPS 
is able to fund its operating expenses with-
out additional borrowing at this time, we are 
pleased to have reached an agreement on the 
material terms and conditions of a loan, 
should the need arise.’’ 
And, White House Chief of Staff Mark 
Meadows also confirmed on CNN that the 
White House offered the additional $10 bil-
lion in funding to the Postal Service. Re-
freshing the left’s collective memory about 
the availability of massive amounts of fund-
ing to the USPS ought to have put this 
phony claim to bed. 
But House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is insist-
ing that the House of Representatives return 
to vote on additional funding for the USPS, 
which 
illustrates 
the 
Democrats’ 
over-
arching theme: Just send money; it will al-
ways solve the problem, whatever the prob-
lem is, even if there is no real problem. 
The second deception that the Democrats 
are using to try and steal the upcoming elec-
tion is by conflating the long-established 
practice of absentee balloting with the elec-
tion-fraud-producing scam that the left is 
selling of universal mail-in ballots. By con-
solidating the two, very different voting pro-
cedures, they are trying to scare Americans 
into believing that Mr. Trump is going to 
cheat in the upcoming election. 
This is consistent with Democrats’ oper-
ating strategy and the methodology that 
they will accuse you of what they are actu-
ally trying to accomplish. In this case, the 
Democrats are trying to steal the election by 
sending ballots out to every name on every 
voter roll. But they are fighting against 
cleaning up the voter rolls. 
Your uncle is dead but still on the voter 
roll? A ballot comes to his last address in his 
name. Your cat is somehow on the roll? 
Fluffy gets a ballot. 
Democrats know that their demands will 
incentivize and produce fraudulent ballots by 
sending out ballots to those who haven’t re-
quested them. They are OK with that be-
cause they think they can win the dead voter 
and pet cat demographics. 
They accuse Mr. Trump of defunding the 
USPS—when the left really wants to defund 
the police—and their accusation is a lie. 
They know that the president supports the 
long-standing practice of absentee voting, 
but claim he is against that. Another lie. 
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is so con-
cerned that she is bringing the House back 
into session to vote on legislation that 
means nothing. Oh yeah, it’s urgent alright, 
but only after the Democratic convention is 
completed. Oh, and it’s only to give Demo-
crats the opportunity to further the panic- 
driven narrative, because the Senate isn’t 
going to hear the speaker’s deceptive bill. 
Never forget that the Democrats and left 
always accuse you of what they are actually 
doing and that they will prevaricate to fur-
ther that claim. The left will try and stoke 
panic in the country, then attempt to spend 
any amount of money to quell that panic in 
order to arrogate power. 
The deception surrounding the USPS ‘‘cri-
sis’’ is just another great example of Marx-
ian-Democrat duplicity.

POSTMASTER GENERAL PROMISES TIMELY DE-
LIVERY
OF
ELECTION
MAIL, SAYS
USPS 
DOESN’T NEED BAILOUT MONEY 
(By Aaron Colen) 
Postmaster General Louis DeJoy denied 
accusations that the United States Postal 
Service wouldn’t be able to handle increased 
volumes of election mail in November, and 
told the Senate Homeland Security and Gov-
ernmental Affairs Committee on Friday that 
the USPS was ‘‘fully capable’’ of getting the 
job done, CBS News reported.

DeJoy has been a target of Democrats who 
believe the Trump donor and logistics expert 
is handicapping the Postal Service at the 
president’s urging in order to discourage or 
limit mail-in voting. 
‘‘As we head into the election season, I 
want to assure this committee, and the 
American public, that the Postal Service is 
fully capable of delivering the nation’s elec-
tion mail securely and on time,’’ DeJoy tes-
tified. 
DeJoy said even mail-in ballots sent one 
week before Election Day would be counted, 
because USPS workers will ‘‘scour every 
plant each night leading up to Election Day’’ 
to make sure no ballot is left behind. 
Rather than being opposed to mail-in vot-
ing, as President Donald Trump is, DeJoy 
told the committee ‘‘I think the American 
public should be able to vote by mail, and 
the Postal Service will support it.’’ 
DeJoy clarified that the potential issue 
with mail-in ballots is related to state dead-
lines that are too close to Election Day, 
which is why 46 states were notified of that 
issue in a letter late last month. DeJoy said 
Americans should vote early, if they can. 
The U.S. Postal Service plans to ‘‘send a 
letter to every American’’ explaining ‘‘what 
our process is’’ for mail-in voting, DeJoy 
said Friday. 
DeJoy, who has been in his role since June, 
said he has never spoken to Trump or White 
House advisers about making changes to 
service. 
The USPS has long been in bad financial 
shape, and DeJoy was hired as a logistics ex-
pert from the private sector to address issues 
of cost and efficiency. Some of the changes 
that have reportedly been made, such as the 
limiting of overtime and the removal of 
some mail sorting machines and collection 
boxes, have led to some delays in mail deliv-
ery in some areas. Those operational changes 
were suspended by DeJoy this week to avoid 
the appearance of tampering with the Nov. 3 
election. 
Some recent primary elections were dis-
rupted by issues with mail-in ballots. A New 
York congressional election was delayed by 
six weeks due to a dispute over some ballots 
that were not postmarked or that were re-
ceived after the deadline. Tens of thousands 
of votes that were mailed in weren’t counted 
for various reasons. 
Democrats are pushing for billions of dol-
lars in additional funding for the USPS, par-
tially to help with the election. On Friday, 
DeJoy told Congress the USPS did not need 
a federal bailout, but did advocate for reim-
bursement for service provided during the 
pandemic even while revenues were down. 
Mr. BIGGS. Madam Speaker, ‘‘The 
Postal Service is fully capable of deliv-
ering the Nation’s election mail se-
curely and on time.’’ That was the tes-
timony of the Postmaster General. 
But they don’t trust the Postmaster 
General. 
The post office has taken care of over 
400 million pieces of mail every day. 
But they don’t trust the Postmaster 
General. 
That is intriguing to me, because 
they are going to give the Postmaster 
General an additional $25 billion. They 
don’t trust him, yet they are going to 
give him $25 billion when he already 
has $15 billion cash on hand and a $10 
billion line of credit. We don’t trust 
this guy, but we are going to give him 
$25 billion extra. 
But moreover, this is a crisis. We 
want reforms. We want changes. We 
don’t trust the current Postmaster 
General, so what we are going to do is 
we are going to proscribe any kind of 
efforts to make the post office, Postal 
Service, work better. We are going to 
stop that. Not only are we going to 
stop that, we are going to give a new 
cause of action to trial lawyers against 
the USPS. 
That is what is going on in this bill, 
and I find that intriguing. It reminds 
me of a Eugene Ionesco play, Luigi Pi-
randello. We are talking theater of the 
absurd here. That is what we are talk-
ing about. 
Democrats call the failures of USPS 
a crisis, but they are going to prohibit 
reforms or changes. Think of the irony 
of that. 
I would suggest that this illustrates 
the Democrats’ overarching theme: If 
you just send money, it will always 
solve the problem, whatever the prob-
lem is, even if there is no real problem. 
This is not a money issue. This is not 
an acute issue. This is a long-term 
problem that has been there for mul-
tiple administrations. 
Now, to come in at the last minute— 
and here is part of the absurdity. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Ms. 
WILD). The time of the gentleman has 
expired. 
Mr. COMER. Madam Speaker, I yield 
an additional 30 seconds to the gen-
tleman from Arizona (Mr. BIGGS). 
Mr. BIGGS. Madam Speaker, the 
richest part of this irony, this absurd-
ity, is: Here we are today. We are going 
to vote on this bill today, and we are 
going to have the hearing on Monday 
in the committee. That is the richest 
part of an absurdity that is going to 
cost us $25 billion. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Madam Speaker, just as a point 
of clarification, there is no cause of ac-
tion in this bill, and it does not in any 
way hinder any efficiency that would 
speed up the mail. It merely stops any 
action that slows down the mail until 
the end of this pandemic. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to 
the gentlewoman from Massachusetts 
(Ms. PRESSLEY), an extremely valuable 
member of the committee. 
Ms. PRESSLEY. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to say: Enough. In a blatant 
attempt to suppress the vote, the occu-
pant has continued to attack the legit-
imacy of our elections, denouncing the 
very method of voting he and his fam-
ily have repeatedly used: mail-in bal-
lots. 
Hypocrisy: It should look familiar to 
my colleagues across the aisle. 
How dare you refer to this as a sham 
bill. The only sham here is the patriot-
ism that you allege to espouse while 
you stand idly by and are complicit in 
the dismantling of the United States 
Postal Service, which is impacting the 
lives of all of our constituents, dis-
rupting services. 
Patriotism: They hire more veterans 
than anyone else. Veterans rely on 
them to receive lifesaving medication. 
The only sham here is the patriotism 
which you espouse. 
Enough of the criminal and corrupt 
mismanagement 
of 
the 
Postmaster 
General. The changes he has brought to 
our Postal Service during this pan-
demic are brazen acts of sabotage in-
tended to slow down operations and to 
delay mail delivery. 
This is a hell of a way to repay 600,000 
dedicated letter carriers and postal 
workers who have put themselves in 
harm’s way in the midst of this pan-
demic, who find dignity in their work 
and are worried about the impact on 
services and fear for their very liveli-
hoods and retribution for the calls that 
they have made to all of our offices. 
How dare you. 
While the Trump administration and 
its allies continue to gaslight the 
American people, we actually listen to 
our constituents and their lived experi-
ences and how this has disrupted their 
lives, what you are referring to as 
fakes news, constituents like Cas-
sandra, a freelancer from Somerville 
who waited for 2 weeks for a check 
from a client to arrive. 
‘‘Freelancing is already unstable,’’ 
she told me, ‘‘and post office delays 
mean I have even less assurance that 
the money I have worked for will reach 
me in a timely fashion.’’ 
Or Brendan in Charlestown, who re-
quested an absentee ballot more than 3 
weeks ago so he and his pregnant wife 
could vote without risking their health 
but has yet to receive it because, in the 
Massachusetts Seventh Congressional 
District, nine mail sorting machines 
have been removed. 
There must be accountability. It is 
time to pass the Delivering for Amer-
ica Act. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Mem-
bers are reminded to address their re-
marks to the Chair. 
Mr. COMER. Madam Speaker, I yield 
2 minutes to the gentleman from Texas 
(Mr. WILLIAMS). 
Mr. WILLIAMS. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today in opposition to H.R. 8015 
and the manufactured crisis my Demo-
cratic colleagues have created regard-
ing the U.S. Postal Service. 
For the past week, the American peo-
ple have been told they cannot trust 
the Postal Service to do their job and 
that Republicans, along with President 
Trump, are trying to undermine the 
agency. 
That could not be further from the 
truth. The Postal Service has more 
than enough funding to operate for the 
next calendar year and has not even 
acted upon the $10 billion loan the 
Treasury offered back in July. 
The sad truth is that the Postal Serv-
ice has been financially unsustainable 
and without reform for over a decade, 
and the bill we are voting on today will 
do nothing, absolutely nothing, to im-
prove the shortfalls with this agency. 
We should, instead, be working to-
gether to address certain problems we 
have while being conscious of the tax-
payer dollars that have been used for 
bailouts over the years. 
Madam Speaker, I have a rural dis-
trict in Texas, District 25. We rely

upon the Postal Service to fulfill serv-
ices that my constituents would other-
wise go without. I am an advocate for 
improving this agency, and we should 
dedicate time to do just that, but there 
is an actual crisis among us that 
should demand our immediate atten-
tion. 
In the car business, you can’t charge 
the sticker price if you don’t have a ve-
hicle to deliver, and you don’t sell used 
cars that won’t start. We are not deliv-
ering results today. The immediate cri-
sis we need to address is caused by the 
COVID–19 pandemic. 
Main Street America and families 
across Texas are wanting results, but 
my colleagues on the other side of the 
aisle would rather ignore this truth 
and, instead, politicize a conspiracy 
theory. If my colleagues are serious 
about postal reform, then let’s get to 
work, but the legislation before us 
today isn’t the answer. It is, frankly, a 
waste of time. 
I should be home with my family. I 
should be home with my grandchildren. 
As we say in Texas, ‘‘This dog won’t 
hunt.’’ Well, let me tell you, this dog 
won’t hunt. 
And, P.S., let’s make the Postal 
Service run like a business. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Madam Speaker, I yield 2 min-
utes to the gentlewoman from Michi-
gan (Ms. TLAIB), another great member 
of the committee. 
Ms. TLAIB. Madam Speaker, do you 
hear that? That is our democracy 
crumbling. 
I want all of my neighbors, I want all 
of America to know why the people’s 
House is here for an emergency vote on 
Saturday while Senate Majority Lead-
er MCCONNELL went on vacation: We 
are experiencing a global pandemic, 
and now our U.S. Postal Service is 
under attack. 
Let it be clear: This administration 
is waging an authoritarian campaign 
to sabotage this election by manipu-
lating the Postal Service to suppress 
our votes, and they are threatening the 
livelihood of our postal workers, our 
seniors, our veterans, and so many 
more in the process. 
This is not a conspiracy theory. This 
is fascism. We will not stand for this 
now or ever. 
In Michigan right now, machines ca-
pable of sorting 35,000 pieces of mail 
per hour have disappeared from postal 
facilities. 
Brave workers are blowing the whis-
tle and saying that they have never 
seen anything like this, Madam Speak-
er. 
We must put an end to it. 
Madam Speaker, I say to the White 
House: Hands off the United States 
Postal Service. 
Let’s make it clear through this law 
to fund our Postal Service and undo 
these harmful attacks and restore nor-
mal operations. 
Mr. COMER. Madam Speaker, I yield 
2 minutes to the gentleman from North 
Carolina (Mr. BISHOP). 
Mr. 
BISHOP 
of 
North 
Carolina. 
Madam Speaker, I thank the gen-
tleman for yielding. 
Madam Speaker, our presence today, 
this unserious legislation, even all the 
yelling across the aisle and the stray-
ing off topic, they all underscore a con-
trast: Democrats whip up hysteria; Re-
publicans show up to work. 
They call a Saturday session, sup-
posedly because of an emergency. Re-
publicans are here, but about 70 Demo-
crats don’t show up. And that has been 
the pattern all summer: Republicans 
come to work; Democrats dial it in, 
sometimes from the fishing boat. 
They say the virus keeps them from 
congregating to work, but they encour-
age the throng outside the Postmaster 
General’s personal residence. 
Or 
consider 
Representative 
GRI-
JALVA: not at work today, but joined a 
postal union protest 4 days ago. They 
can congregate to whip up hysteria, 
just not to work. 
Now, Louis DeJoy is showing up to 
work. Testifying yesterday, he calmly 
debunked apocryphal tales about blue 
collection boxes and sorting machines. 
Monday, he testifies before the House 
Oversight and Reform Committee, but 
Democrats fan hysteria today without 
waiting for facts, even though they 
don’t show up. 
Let’s drop the hysteria. Let’s all 
show up to work. Americans need our 
help. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Madam Speaker, I yield 11⁄2 min-
utes to the gentleman from Maryland 
(Mr. SARBANES), an outstanding mem-
ber of the committee. 
Mr. SARBANES. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the chairwoman of the com-
mittee for yielding. 
I support this bill strongly. 
I want to speak a little bit to what 
the 
Postmaster 
General 
acknowl-
edged—admitted—yesterday. He called 
it a dip in service. He finally admitted 
that after being pressed extensively on 
it. 
I want to tell you what the dip looks 
like in my district. 
So, in all of 2019, our constituent 
service folks opened 11 cases to deal 
with delays and service problems with 
the mail—11 cases in 2019. So far this 
year, there have been 106. 
Now, I am not talking about people 
who are just calling in and complaining 
because the mail is late and then they 
hang up the phone and so forth. This is 
where they have got real concerns 
about what is happening and they ask 
us to open a case. There have been 106 
this year compared with 11 last year, 
and 103 of those in the last 4 weeks. 
That is not a dip in service. That is a 
collapse of service, and it tracks ex-
actly to the time that Louis DeJoy has 
been on the job. 
Here is what is so terrible: When you 
attack the Postal Service from within, 
which is what he is doing, it has the ef-
fect of trying to separate the postal 
workers from the public that trusts 
them. 
Over 90 percent of Americans have a 
favorable opinion of the Postal Service. 
We have to restore that bond. That is 
what this legislation does. 
Mr. COMER. Madam Speaker, I yield 
30 seconds to the gentleman from 
Pennsylvania (Mr. FITZPATRICK). 
Mr. FITZPATRICK. Madam Speaker, 
I thank Ranking Member COMER for 
yielding. 
Madam Speaker, I stand today with 
the hardworking letter carriers and 
postal workers of the United States 
Postal Service. 
The USPS must be fully funded so 
that my constituents and millions 
across our Nation can receive the high- 
quality and timely service that the 
post office has always provided us. 
Madam Speaker, today I will vote in 
favor of the Delivering for America 
Act. 
Republicans and Democrats, House 
and Senate, must come together and 
address the serious challenges that 
USPS has been facing for quite some 
time now. I look forward to continuing 
to work with our colleagues on bipar-
tisan solutions to move all of our he-
roes forward and support our heroes at 
the U.S. Postal Service.

Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Madam Speaker, I yield 11⁄2 min-
utes to the distinguished gentlewoman 
from Massachusetts (Ms. CLARK), who 
is the vice chair of our caucus. 
Ms. 
CLARK 
of 
Massachusetts. 
Madam Speaker, 99 days ago House 
Democrats passed the HEROES Act to 
provide much-needed relief 
to 
the 
American people suffering from this 
pandemic. 
What was the reaction from the 
GOP? 
A shrug. 
Funding for State and local govern-
ments to protect jobs of first respond-
ers and teachers? 
MITCH MCCONNELL said: Let them go 
bankrupt. 
Feeding hungry children and fami-
lies? 
They said: Let’s hit the pause button. 
Funding for testing, treatment, and 
hospitals as death tolls soared over 
175,000? 
Donald Trump said: It is what it is. 
Unemployment benefits and eviction 
protection? 
Not right now. 
In May, we also funded the post of-
fice, a critical service enshrined in our 
Constitution, a lifeline to seniors and 
veterans, like John, who called me yes-
terday from my hometown who had to 
wait an extra week to get his medica-
tion. 
It is a pillar of our democracy allow-
ing people to vote safely from home 
this fall. We are here today to defend 
this institution from slow deliveries 
and removal of critical mail infrastruc-
ture. Twelve mail sorting machines in 
my home State have been removed. 
When Mr. DeJoy was asked about 
this, he said: They are not needed.

August 22, 2020 
Donald Trump said he didn’t want 
those ridiculous ballots delivered. 
We will not stand by while the Postal 
Service is dismantled and good jobs are 
lost. We will fight so that every vote is 
counted. 
Vote ‘‘yes’’ for the Postal Service. 
Vote ‘‘yes’’ for the people. Vote ‘‘yes’’ 
for democracy. 
Mr. COMER. Madam Speaker, I yield 
21⁄2
minutes to the gentleman from 
Utah (Mr. CURTIS). 
Mr. CURTIS. Madam Speaker, like 
many of my constituents, I have fol-
lowed the allegations circling around 
the Postal Service. These are serious 
allegations. To get to the heart of the 
problem, I spoke directly to Utah’s 
postal leadership. 
As I asked questions and waded 
through the rumors, I learned four im-
portant facts: 
First, it is clear that the Postal Serv-
ice needs additional funding. How 
much and under what circumstances is 
a worthy debate. But let me be clear: 
the funding solution has no bearing on 
their ability to handle the upcoming 
mail-in ballots. The United States 
Postal Service has enough cash on 
hand to operate well into 2021. 
Second, the increased demand of 
mail-in ballots does not stretch their 
capacity. Mail-in ballots will increase 
the demand on the system by a little 
over 1.5 percent. In the words of Utah’s 
district director, not even a bump in 
volume. The day I spoke with him 
Utah’s mail delivery system was 500,000 
letters under capacity. 
Third, the accusation that they are 
removing boxes and cutting overtime 
to thwart mail-in ballots is just plain 
not true. Boxes have always been 
moved to adjust to volume. To calm 
fears, the Postal Service has put a 90- 
day moratorium on moving boxes. 
Likewise, rumors that overtime is 
being cut so mail-in ballots will be de-
layed is false. I confirmed this with 
Utah’s district director. In his words: 
Never in my career have we left mail 
undelivered because of overtime. 
Fourth, the concerns with mail-in 
balloting have everything to do with 
the State’s preparedness, not the Post-
al Service. States who have allowed 
ballots to be requested just 4 days be-
fore election are irresponsible and 
should be accountable for mail-in bal-
lot problems, not the United States 
Postal Service. Further, mail-in bal-
lots take longer to count and delays 
can be expected, but not because of the 
Postal Service. 
Madam Speaker, if you are not sure 
whom to believe, ask your mail carrier. 
Ask them if there is anything less than 
100 percent effort given by them to de-
liver mail-in ballots and all mail, and 
then make sure to thank them. I am so 
grateful for the many men and women 
who work so hard to deliver our mail 
every day. 
We need a strong and vibrant Postal 
Service, but this bill thrown together 
in the middle of the night does not de-
liver. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute 
to the gentlewoman from California 
(Ms. ESHOO), who is the distinguished 
chair of the Subcommittee on Health 
on the Energy and Commerce Com-
mittee. 
Ms. ESHOO. Madam Speaker, I am 
here today to speak on behalf of the 
Postal Service in our country. 
I am here today because I view it as 
a Democratic institution in our coun-
try. 
I am here today because the Framers 
placed it in the Constitution. 
I am here today because my constitu-
ents are not receiving their prescrip-
tion drugs, businesses are not receiving 
their mail, and people are not receiving 
their mail. 
I am here today to speak on their be-
half because they are outraged. They 
are outraged about two things that 
have happened, that the President has 
said and attacked mail-in votes. 
Guess how votes are counted? 
They are carried by the mail service. 
The Postmaster General, instead of 
building it up, is dismantling it. It is 
over the top to see pictures of postal 
boxes being unhinged. 
Vote for the Delivering for America 
Act. The people deserve it. 
Mr. COMER. Madam Speaker, I yield 
3 minutes to the gentleman from Lou-
isiana (Mr. SCALISE), who is the Repub-
lican whip. 
Mr. SCALISE. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman from Kentucky 
for yielding. 
When you think about why we are 
here on a Saturday, I would think if we 
are being brought here on a Saturday 
in the middle of a pandemic, it is to 
help those millions of families who are 
struggling, Madam Speaker. 
I would think if we are going to come 
here on a Saturday, it would be to help 
those millions of small businesses, the 
restaurants in south Louisiana and 
New Orleans that don’t even know if 
they are going to open again because of 
where we are right now. 
In this pandemic you would think 
that is what we would be here for. 
But instead, Madam Speaker, why 
are we here? 
For a fabricated crisis. 
The Wall Street Journal: ‘‘NANCY 
PELOSI Goes Politically Postal. Con-
gress ought to be embarrassed by this 
evidence-free conspiracy theory.’’ 
The New York Times: ‘‘I Was a Post-
al Service Regulator for 18 Years. 
Don’t Panic. The service is perfectly 
capable of handling election mail.’’ 
That was a Bill Clinton-era appointee. 
Then you look at, again, this fab-
ricated crisis that, oh my gosh, there 
are mailboxes being closed. 
Let’s look at the record. During the 
Obama-Biden 
years—just 
4 
years— 
11,560 mailboxes removed. 
Where were the hearings for that? 
Where were the Saturday votes to 
decry that they were closing mail-
boxes? 
It never happened because it is not a 
real crisis. 
Even the Postmaster General just 
testified yesterday: ‘‘The Postal Serv-
ice is fully capable and committed to 
delivering the Nation’s election mail 
fully and on time.’’ 
That is the Postmaster General. 
If you would have listened to him—I 
know there is a hearing Monday. 
Maybe if you would have waited to see 
what he actually said Monday in this 
committee, Madam Speaker, you would 
have known that this is a fabricated 
crisis. But you knew that before. 
Madam Speaker, they knew this was 
a fabricated crisis. 
In fact, when we talk about the 
money, oh my gosh, the post office is 
going to run out of money. Well, the 
problem is the facts decry even that. 
They have got a surplus of over $12 bil-
lion sitting in the bank today and then 
they have got—this is the Department 
of Treasury, Madam Speaker, a $10 bil-
lion line of credit that they can’t even 
access because they have too much 
money in the bank right now. 
Imagine small businesses watching 
on a Saturday because they can’t open. 
They are not even sure if they are 
going to be in business next week be-
cause they have no money in the bank, 
and they are hearing about this crisis. 
Congress is coming in on a Saturday. 
Then they find out the post office has 
over $12 billion in the bank and they 
have access to a line of credit of $10 bil-
lion from Treasury that they can’t get 
to today because they have got too 
much money in the bank. 
Right now, it is here. This is the let-
ter from Treasury. 
It is so important, Madam Speaker, 
that 68 Democrats chose not even to 
show up today. Sixty-eight are not 
even here today because this is a fake 
crisis. It is a fabricated crisis. 
It is a shame that instead of helping 
small businesses and families, they are 
trying to scare the American people 
when everybody knows there is enough 
money to carry out the mail. Barack 
Obama and Joe Biden took out over 
11,000 mailboxes, and it was never even 
a problem. 
We have got to vote against this. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Madam Speaker, I yield 11⁄2 min-
utes to the distinguished gentleman 
from Illinois (Mr. KRISHNAMOORTHI), 
who is the chair of the Subcommittee 
on Economic and Consumer Policy on 
the Oversight and Reform Committee. 
Mr. 
KRISHNAMOORTHI. 
Madam 
Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman 
from New York for her leadership. 
Madam Speaker, I rise as a proud co-
sponsor of H.R. 8015, the Delivering for 
America Act. 
Madam Speaker, the USPS is under 
attack. In the last month, Postmaster 
General DeJoy has made irreversible 
changes causing mail delivery backlogs 
as long as 3 weeks. But don’t just take 
my word for it; 1,612 constituents of 
mine have contacted us about delayed 
mail. 
Denise Winchar contacted us saying: 
I run a small business and rely on the

post office to receive payment for my 
clients. Without payment, I have no in-
come. Any delay in getting paid is a 
big hardship for me. In the past month, 
I have had to wait several weeks for 
payment. 
Take Vanesa Deben’s word for it. She 
says: My insurance forces us to get our 
prescription delivered by mail, I have 
diabetes and I need to take my meds or 
risk health problems. The USPS is a 
service that we all pay for with our 
taxes and as a paying customer we 
need to demand that we get our service 
back now. 
The Delivering for America Act in-
cludes 
three 
important 
provisions, 
Madam Speaker. 
It reverses the dangerous operational 
changes implemented by Postmaster 
DeJoy. 
It includes $25 billion in relief to the 
USPS. 
It requires the USPS to treat all offi-
cial election mail as first-class mail. 
Madam Speaker, I strongly urge my 
colleagues to support this legislation. 
Mr. COMER. Madam Speaker, I yield 
3 minutes to the gentleman from Cali-
fornia (Mr. NUNES). 
Mr. NUNES. Madam Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman for the time. 
Since 
the 
election 
of 
President 
Trump, the most absurd conspiracy 
theories have been proclaimed as gos-
pel by the entire Democratic Party and 
their media mouthpieces. 
Let’s begin with the Russian collu-
sion hoax; the theory that Trump was 
a secret Russian agent who colluded 
with Putin to steal the 2016 election 
from Hillary Clinton. The theory com-
prised many preposterous sub-conspir-
acies, including several wild tales. 
For example, secret computer servers 
communicated with Russians. 
Secret meetings with Russians oc-
curred in Prague, and secret Russian 
money laundering from the Trump 
campaign. 
Best of all, Putin had a secret stash 
of nude pictures of Trump and the now 
infamous pee tapes that the Democrats 
and their puppets in the media spent 
several years searching all over Europe 
for. 
The Russia hoax ultimately im-
ploded. But, Madam Speaker, you have 
to almost admire the Democrats’ amaz-
ing ability to jump from one debunked 
conspiracy theory to another without a 
hint of shame, embarrassment, or self- 
reflection. 
The Democrats supposedly convened 
us here today to protect Americans 
from Trump’s latest nefarious plot—his 
alleged attempt to sabotage the Postal 
Service to steal the election. In the 
grand 
scheme 
of 
Democratic 
con-
spiracy theories, this one really is 
scraping the bottom of the barrel. 
I suppose we can grant the Demo-
crats that the post office actually does 
exist, and it does deliver mail. But 
watching them vent outrage on social 
media about missing mailboxes and 
anti-mail theft devices is rather sad. 
Good conspiracy theories have rich, 
false details that tell a story, like Area 
51 for example. But the Democrats 
have grown a little lazy to develop the 
necessary back story. 
The Postal Service hoax is more akin 
to theories that the Earth is flat, 
NASA faked Moon landings, that Elvis 
is alive, and that Paul McCartney is 
dead. Even the Loch Ness Monster, Big 
Foot, and the Chupacabra at least 
yielded photographic evidence. 
In closing, I want to thank my Demo-
cratic colleagues for inviting us here 
for a Saturday afternoon matinee in 
August. I urge them next time to put 
more effort into their future con-
spiracy theories. If you no longer have 
time to properly craft your fake news 
narratives, you can also have the 
Democratic National Committee laun-
der money to hire a British spy to go 
to your Russian friends and develop an-
other set of fake dossiers. 
Madam Speaker, have a good after-
noon. I urge a ‘‘no’’ vote. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Mem-
bers are reminded to address their re-
marks to the Chair. 
b 1615 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute 
to the gentleman from Massachusetts 
(Mr. KEATING), a distinguished Member 
of Congress. 
Mr. KEATING. Madam Speaker, for 
several years, I was a letter carrier, 
working my way through college and 
grad school, working overtime as mail 
volume necessitated—and, yes, neces-
sitated. It was understood then that it 
was a necessity. 
I worked with dedicated postal work-
ers, many of whom were veterans who 
persevered through emergencies—hur-
ricane, blizzards, floods. As the motto 
says, ‘‘gloom of night.’’ 
Now, our country faces new emer-
gencies, a pandemic that threatens 
lives and encumbers our basic rights, 
like the right to vote safely and in an 
economic crisis, where 600,000 Postal 
Service workers battle back, providing 
economic stimulus and $1.6 trillion in 
sales revenues. 
The Postal Service is an economic 
and healthcare lifeline, a lifeline that 
Donald Trump is trying to sever, all to 
sabotage mail-in voting he thinks will 
dampen his chances to cling to power. 
He is the gloom of night, and it is our 
job, our duty, to throw some sunlight 
his way and to stop him. 
Mr. COMER. Madam Speaker, may I 
inquire how much time each side has 
remaining. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from Kentucky has 8 minutes 
remaining. The gentlewoman from New 
York has 10 minutes remaining. 
Mr. COMER. Madam Speaker, I yield 
1 minute to the gentleman from Michi-
gan (Mr. WALBERG). 
Mr. WALBERG. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman for yielding me 
the time. 
Madam Speaker, I was told in persua-
sion class many, many years ago that 
if you had a weak argument, you 
shouted all the more. After hearing 
some of the leadership on the other 
side of the aisle, I guess they learned 
the same approach—a weak argument 
that isn’t holding up. 
When I heard the majority leader 
talk about ‘‘this is for the people,’’ this 
is for ‘‘your people,’’ I don’t believe 
that at all because Jeanie, my rural 
mail carrier, is working today; 68 
Democrats are not working today. Yet, 
this is supposed to be something of im-
portance. 
Last week, we heard the convention 
start this postal deal going on. This is 
just a continuation of the Democrat 
convention. I want you to know that 
nothing that has been said about sup-
posedly what the President is attempt-
ing to do in defunding, in deflating, in 
stopping the vote or the mail service is 
true. My Democrat colleagues know 
that as well. I think that is why 68 
chose to stay home today as opposed to 
coming here in a planned event that 
meant nothing other than politics. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute 
to the distinguished gentleman from 
Rhode Island (Mr. LANGEVIN). 
Mr. LANGEVIN. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentlewoman for yielding. 
Madam Speaker, Postmaster General 
DeJoy’s attempts to push forward oper-
ational changes that delay the mail are 
simply unacceptable. My constituents 
depend on the U.S. Postal Service. In 
the past week alone, I received over 
1,000 
constituent 
letters 
expressing 
confusion and anger over these changes 
that he has planned and implemented. 
A senior from Coventry wrote to me, 
expressing her alarm over what might 
happen if her diabetic husband failed to 
receive his medications on time. 
A constituent from Wakefield, who 
has not missed an election since 1956, 
emailed me to ask if he should vote in 
person, despite being 85 years old with 
health concerns. 
Madam Speaker, no one should have 
to wait for lifesaving medications or 
risk their health to cast a vote. I urge 
my colleagues to support this bill. Mil-
lions of Americans are counting on us, 
and we cannot let them down. 
Mr. COMER. Madam Speaker, I yield 
1 minute to the gentleman from Texas 
(Mr. GOHMERT). 
Mr. GOHMERT. Madam Speaker, I 
thank my friend from Kentucky for 
yielding. 
Madam Speaker, look, I am pleased 
that Democrats here are upset about 
what has happened to the post office. 
My regret is, you didn’t get upset dur-
ing the Obama administration when 
they were shutting down our post of-
fices, not just getting rid of 12,000 mail-
boxes, shutting down processing cen-
ters. In my district, when they shut 
down the Overton processing center, it 
meant mail going from Tyler to Long-
view, or vice versa, went to Dallas then 
to Shreveport and back. 
The Deputy Attorney General came 
to my office—I had been demanding a 
meeting with the Postmaster General—

but, oh, no. No time for that. They had 
no decency. They tried to say 390 miles 
would be cheaper and quicker than 
going 30 miles. 
It is an outrage what the Obama ad-
ministration did, including their Post-
master General, who was in office until 
June 15 of this year. 
Wake up. Let’s complain about the 
post office during the Obama years. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute 
to the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. 
COHEN). 
Mr. COHEN. Madam Speaker, I thank 
the chairwoman for yielding. 
Madam Speaker, Mr. DeJoy was be-
fore a Senate committee on Friday. He 
was asked if he would put back in the 
sorters that he had removed, and he 
said no. 
I think that is because he had al-
ready done his dirty work. He had al-
ready slowed down the mail by taking 
the sorting machines out, and the flat 
sorters as well, which my postal people 
tell me is causing great delays and will 
cause greater delays. 
He had already done it. He refused to 
put them back in. Why? Because the 
job was done, and he didn’t want to put 
those sorters back in to see that the 
mail was delivered. He is no Karl Ma-
lone. He does not deliver. He is not the 
‘‘Mailman.’’ 
These postal sorters need to be there. 
39,000 letters an hour go through. The 
flat sorters are necessary for the mail- 
in ballots. There is no reason he 
wouldn’t put them back in. It wouldn’t 
save any money. It costs money to 
take them out. He didn’t save money 
by taking them out. He reduced effi-
ciency. He reduced the ability of the 
Post Office to deliver ballots to elect a 
person safely in America. This is a 
shame, and it is a crime. 
Madam Speaker, I support the bill, 
and everyone here should. 
Mr. COMER. Madam Speaker, I yield 
2 minutes to the gentleman from Texas 
(Mr. ARRINGTON), my good friend. 
Mr. ARRINGTON. Madam Speaker, I 
rise in strong opposition to the Demo-
crat bill entitled Delivering for Amer-
ica Act. What an irresponsible and dis-
honest title. 
Democratic leadership must take the 
American people as fools. This bill at-
tempts to deceive the American people 
by manufacturing a crisis that simply 
does not exist. 
This bill also distracts this body 
from actually doing something in this 
Chamber 
that 
matters, 
like 
con-
demning violent mobs terrorizing our 
communities, like helping hardworking 
families across this country in this un-
precedented time of need. 
Madam Speaker, here are the facts: 
The United States Postal Service is a 
Blockbuster video in a Netflix world. 
Everyone knows it is a broken business 
model. It has failed its workers; it has 
failed its retirees; and it has failed the 
American taxpayers. 
Despite the need for long-term re-
form, the Postal Service currently has 
$15 billion in cash on hand and $10 bil-
lion more from the CARES Act. 
The 
independent 
Postal 
Service 
Board and the independent Postmaster 
General have repeatedly assured the 
American people that they can handle 
the increased volume in mail-in voting. 
Let’s be clear. Today’s vote is more 
political theater. It is another scene 
from the Democrats’ one-act play ti-
tled Defeat President Trump at All 
Costs, even if it means peddling a de-
ceitful narrative that undermines the 
American people’s trust in the very in-
stitutions of our democratic Republic. 
To say the Postal Service is all of a 
sudden incapacitated, unable to pro-
vide a secure, mail-in process, is not in-
tellectually honest. It is downright 
predatory. 
Democrats who falsely call into ques-
tion the security of our elections to 
justify a $25 billion bailout is a scam 
and a political payoff to their govern-
ment union bosses. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my Democrat 
colleagues: Stand up to your leader-
ship. Stop this shameful charade. See 
the grave danger of manipulating the 
American people to score cheap, polit-
ical points. 
Madam Speaker, let’s get back to 
work. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute 
to the gentlewoman from California 
(Ms. JUDY CHU), the distinguished chair 
of the Asian Pacific American Caucus. 
Ms. JUDY CHU of California. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today in strong support 
of H.R. 8015, the Delivering for America 
Act, because I will not tolerate sabo-
tage of the U.S. Postal Service. 
This week, I went to my local post 
office to fight back against the attacks 
on mail delivery that my Republican 
colleagues now claim never happened. 
But I stand by those who know better 
than anyone, our country’s postal 
workers. 
They talked about how cuts to over-
time are forcing mail carriers to aban-
don their routes halfway through, and 
how deliberate reductions to operating 
capacity mean that they cannot meet 
their community’s needs. 
My constituents also know better. 
Every day, I have heard from seniors 
whose medications have been delayed, 
small businesses unable to get orders 
to customers, and workers waiting to 
receive a check. Pharmacies in my dis-
trict have even needed to tell cus-
tomers to pick their medicine up in 
person instead of relying on the mail. 
No one should have to risk exposure 
to COVID–19 just to pick up a prescrip-
tion, especially not so the President 
can suppress votes in November. 
Madam Speaker, vote to save the 
post office. 
Mr. COMER. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Madam Speaker, I yield 30 sec-
onds to the distinguished gentlewoman 
from Texas (Ms. JACKSON LEE). 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, 
over the last couple of hours, I have 
heard my friends on the other side of 
the aisle say this is not serious. Do you 
know why this is serious? Madam 
Speaker, 176,000 dead Americans from 
COVID–19 and the projection that there 
may be 300,000 dead by December 1. 
Madam Speaker, I left and got on a 
plane from a hotspot—14 to 20 percent 
infection. So my constituents who are 
suffering from stage IV cancer need the 
mail. 
If they want the proof, I read the 
words of General Counsel and Execu-
tive Vice President Thomas J. Mar-
shall of the U.S. Postal Service: ‘‘We 
are currently unable to balance our 
costs with available funding sources to 
fulfill both our universal service mis-
sion and other legal obligations.’’ 
The post office says they have no 
money. We need to be able to deliver 
this money to them and vote on this 
bill. 
Madam Speaker, I support the bill 
and urge my colleagues to vote for it. 
Madam Speaker, I rise to speak in strong 
support of H.R. 8015, the Delivering For 
America Act. 
I thank Chairwoman MALONEY for her lead-
ership in drafting H.R. 8015. 
As a senior member of the House Judiciary 
Committee and member of the House Budget 
Committee, I am particularly interested in why 
and how this Administration has tampered with 
the proper functioning of the U.S. Postal Serv-
ice. 
The drafters of the 1789 Constitution of the 
United States knew the vital importance of 
communication to the nation and its people, so 
they vested authority with the Congress to 
sustain and maintain a national postal service. 
Article I, Section 8, clause 7, in the Con-
stitution of the United States provides that the 
Congress has the power ‘‘To establish Post 
Offices and post Roads . . .’’ 
The Postal Clause was added to the Con-
stitution to facilitate interstate communication 
as well as to create a source of revenue for 
the early United States. 
The freedoms of the press and of speech 
are guaranteed in the First Amendment to the 
Constitution and the establishment of a na-
tional postal system, an authority vested by 
the Constitution in the Congress, are indispen-
sable features of a strong and stable democ-
racy. 
A national postal system to collect and dis-
tribute mail efficiently, affordably, reliably, and 
without regard to the sender’s or recipient’s 
race, creed, color, national origin, religion, re-
gion 
of 
residence, 
or 
political 
affiliation 
strengthens and fortifies democracy by ena-
bling all persons to communicate with any and 
all other Americans. 
A functioning and effective national postal 
system strengthens the economy by facilitating 
the efficient delivery of goods and services, 
promotes the public health by facilitating the 
timely delivery of needed medical supplies and 
prescription drugs to senior citizens and vet-
erans, and enriches civil society by facilitating 
the delivery of letters of greetings, sympathy, 
congratulations, and love, thus strengthening 
the mystic bonds of affection of Americans for 
each other and for the United States. 
Fifty years after the Constitution went into 
effect the population of the United States 
ballooned at a greater rate than it has ever 
since.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4291 
August 22, 2020 
During that period, the population grew from 
3,929,214 in 1790, the year of the first census, 
to 17,069,453 in 1840. 
For those who may think mail tampering is 
fine so long as it is an absentee ballot or ab-
sentee ballot request—they need to know that 
tampering with the U.S. mail is a federal fel-
ony. 
Mail theft carries a penalty of up to five 
years in federal prison and fines of up to 
$250,000 for each violation. 
It is also a crime to injure, deface, or de-
stroy any mail deposited in a mailbox. 
For each act of vandalism, you could be im-
prisoned for up to three years and fined up to 
$250,000. 
Communication for the purpose of com-
merce, 
linking 
and 
strengthening 
bonds 
among family, and friends as well as keeping 
citizens informed was of the utmost impor-
tance to the health and wellbeing of the young 
democracy. 
Over the centuries, the arrival of new tech-
nology that supported communication did not 
end the need for an affordable and easily ac-
cessible national postal service. 
The telegraph, telephone nor the Internet 
ended the need for the delivery of letters, 
cards, packages, and newspapers or maga-
zines. 
The American people are depending on the 
House and the Senate, just like they depend 
on the Post Office to deliver a secure and 
voter centered November Election that em-
powers them to cast ballots for the candidates 
of their choice. 
Election Day must not become a victim of 
COVID–19 through manipulation of the postal 
service or by any other means foreign or do-
mestic. 
I will work with my colleagues to ensure that 
all available means are provided to ensure 
that every voter, no matter their party or pref-
erence has access to cast a vote that will be 
counted in the November election. 
For over 200 years, the American people 
have relied upon the National Postal Service 
to be there—no matter what—they have deliv-
ered the mail during a civil war, pandemics, 
hurricanes, forest fires, and terrorist attacks. 
The Postal Service employs 633,108 of our 
friends and neighbors, including more than 
100,000 veterans. 
The Postal Service is one of the leading 
employers of minorities and women, with mi-
norities comprising 39 percent and women 
comprising 40 percent of the workforce. 
The Post Office has become a path to good 
paying jobs that lifts people out of poverty. 
Postal workers have been determined to be 
essential workers during the pandemic and 
they have delivered service without complaint 
or fail during this national crisis. 
As of July 2020, nearly 5,400 USPS em-
ployees tested positive for COVID–19 among 
its workforce of 630,000. 
A May a report stated that of the 130 Fed-
eral Employees who had died due to COVID– 
19, 60 of them were employed at the U.S. 
Postal Service. 
In June, a staggering 17,000 workers, or 3 
percent of the United States Postal Service 
workforce, had been quarantined since the 
start of the pandemic, according to a recent 
report by Government Executive magazine. 
By the beginning of July, around 70 percent 
of those quarantined have been cleared to go 
back to work. 
Earlier this summer Postal Service manage-
ment acknowledged that 2,830 workers had 
tested positive for COVID–19, out of a total 
workforce of approximately 630,000. 
However, USPS officials have not made 
publicly available the number of deaths. 
With the urgent need to fix the postal serv-
ice, we must not forget that the Postal Service 
employees are essential workers in COVID– 
19, and if they are essential it means that their 
work is essential. 
For 55 cents, anyone can send a first class 
letter anywhere in the United States and there 
is no private sector mail service that can do 
this at this low price. 
In 2019, the Postal Service: 
Delivered 142.6 billion pieces of mail to 260 
million addresses in America; 
Delivered 1.2 billion prescriptions, including 
most of the medications ordered by the VA; 
Served 70 percent of businesses with fewer 
than ten employees; and 
Had a 90 percent favorability rating, making 
it the most popular federal agency. 
The Postal Service: 
Is often the only delivery option for rural 
America where service is not profitable; 
Delivers 48 percent of the world’s mail with 
one of the world’s largest civilian vehicle 
fleets; and 
Is a vital service for the more than 18 million 
seniors who do not use the Internet. 
The Postal Service has become a pharmacy 
of choice for millions of Americans who live in 
pharmacy deserts, which are locations where 
there are no pharmacies to serve commu-
nities. 
The Postal Service is an essential compo-
nent to Veterans’ and seniors’ health because 
they deliver medicines to our veterans. 
The VA has now confirmed to us that the 
United States Postal Service (USPS), which is 
responsible for delivering about 90 percent of 
all VA mail order prescriptions, has indeed 
been delayed in delivering these critical medi-
cations by an average of almost 25 percent 
over the past year, with many locations experi-
encing much more significant delays. 
In addition to delivering prescriptions and 
business mail, they are also delivering democ-
racy to millions of voters who will need to cast 
their ballot by mail this election year to reduce 
their risk of contracting COVID–19. 
The U.S. mail service has provided essen-
tial mail service for absentee voting for well 
over 100 years by enabling Union troops to 
vote during the Civil War, World War I, World 
War II, the Korean War, the Vietnam War, 
Iraqi Freedom, and to this day. 
Since that time, absentee or not in-person 
voting has grown in popularity across the 
United States and is now a welcomed and val-
ued component for assuring citizen participa-
tion in public elections. 
In 2016, 20.9 percent of all votes cast in 
that federal election were done so by absen-
tee ballots and this year that number is ex-
pected to be much higher due to COVID–19. 
In 2018, there were 153.07 million people 
registered to vote in the United States, which 
is lower than the peak of 157.6 million reg-
istered voters in 2016. 
Montana had the highest voter turnout rate 
with 45.6 percent for the 2020 presidential pri-
mary elections. 
The voter turnout rate in Texas for the 2020 
presidential primary elections was 21 percent. 
More than 4 million Texans voted in the 
2020 presidential primary election, with turnout 
among Democratic voters at 12.81 percent 
compared to 12.39 percent of Republican vot-
ers. 
In Texas, there were 16,211,198 registered 
voters and 4,084,431 votes for the 2020 pri-
maries. In comparison, in 2016 there were 
14,238,436 registered voters and 4,272,383 
votes. 
The attack on the viability and value of ab-
sentee voting should be viewed as just one 
component of many assaults on our elections 
system that may make this a very difficult 
election year. 
Over the past several weeks, sweeping 
operational and organization changes at the 
Postal Service have resulted in delays in the 
mail across the country, including in rural com-
munities, among veterans and seniors, and in 
blue and red states alike. 
Some of those changes include curtailing 
overtime, 
restricting 
deliveries, 
eliminating 
sorting machines, and removing mailboxes. 
Concerns have been raised by both Demo-
cratic and Republican officials at the federal, 
state and local levels. 
These changes are being rushed through— 
in the midst of a global pandemic just months 
before the November elections—without ade-
quate consultation with Congress, the Postal 
Board of Governors, the Postal Regulatory 
Commission, postal employees unions, state 
election officials, business organizations, and 
other stakeholders. 
The Postmaster General also recently reas-
signed 23 postal executives in an overhaul 
that experts warn ‘‘deemphasizes decades 
worth of institutional postal knowledge’’ and 
‘‘centralizes power around DeJoy.’’ 
The restructure also proposed a hiring 
freeze, early retirements, unit realignments, 
and regional downscaling. 
On August 11, 2020, the Postal Service’s 
General Counsel sent a letter to Congress ex-
plaining that state election workers had been 
notified that paying Marketing Mail rates in-
stead of First-Class rates for election mail ‘‘will 
result in slower delivery times and will in-
crease the risk that voters will not receive their 
ballots in time to return them by mail.’’ 
This breaks from the Postal Service’s long- 
standing practice of prioritizing the delivery of 
all election mail to meet First-Class delivery 
times. 
The 2011 Canadian RoboCon suppression 
scandal is the political scandal stemming from 
events during the 2011 Canadian federal elec-
tion. 
It involved robocalls and real-person calls 
that were designed to result in voter suppres-
sion. 
Elections Canada and the Royal Canadian 
Mounted Police conducted investigations into 
the claims that calls were made to dissuade 
voters from casting ballots by falsely telling 
them that the location of their polling stations 
had changed. 
Further possible electoral law violations 
were alleged as the evidence unfolded. 
Under the Canada Elections Act, it is an of-
fense to willfully prevent or endeavor to pre-
vent an elector from voting in an election. 
On Election Day, May 2, 2011, reports of 
voter suppression, mostly centered on the 
riding of Guelph, led to the discovery that a 
computer in the Guelph Conservative cam-
paign office may have been used to make the 
calls. 
While the Elections Canada investigation ini-
tially focused on calls sent into Guelph amidst

nationwide complaints, the investigation ex-
panded to complaints in other ridings across 
the country. 
Court documents filed in mid-August 2012 
by the Commissioner of Canada Elections in-
dicated that the elections watchdog had re-
ceived complaints of fraudulent or misleading 
calls in 247 of Canada’s 308 ridings, recorded 
in all ten provinces and at least one territory. 
The deciding margin for control for the gov-
ernment was within the margin of error cre-
ated by the fraudulent robocalls, which were 
successful in misdirecting voters resulting in 
them not being able to cast votes in that na-
tional election. 
It is my strong view that we must prepare 
voters from all socioeconomic backgrounds 
and ethnic cultural experiences to be prepared 
to deal effectively with efforts to misinform 
them about their participation in the November 
Election. 
We must focus on the unsuspecting among 
the voting population who have no idea what 
is coming their way and prepare them to meet 
that challenge by linking them to the election 
protection efforts to allow them to develop the 
needed resources so they are prepared to ex-
ercise the most precious of rights and do the 
work of citizenship by casting their votes for a 
government that serves We The People and 
works to make our union more perfect. 
This view is shaped by the decades of elec-
tions filled with disinformation and misinforma-
tion tactics designed to suppress or repress 
black, LatinX, and young voters from voting or 
having their votes counted. 
For these reasons, I urge my colleagues to 
join me in voting in support of H.R. 8015. 
USPS Email from Constituent 
Ms. Jennifer 
SUBJECT: 
USPS 
concerns 
MESSAGE: 
First, thank you for having a ‘‘post office’’ 
category. Neither senator does. Second, this 
is ridiculous. The postmaster has conflicts of 
interest. He is dismantling the postal serv-
ice, which is explicitly required by the con-
stitution. I depend on the USPS as a con-
stituent. My company depends on it for cor-
respondence and service with clients, espe-
cially while we work from home due to 
Covid. My clients depend on it to get services 
and benefits. Please vote or act to hold the 
postmaster accountable and to stop these ri-
diculous changes he is making. They make 
no business sense for a ‘‘business’’, and they 
are unethical for a government-provided, 
constitutionally-mandated service. 
Mr. COMER. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute 
to the gentlewoman from North Caro-
lina (Ms. ADAMS). 
Ms. 
ADAMS. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
I 
thank Chairwoman MALONEY for her 
leadership. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today in 
strong support of H.R. 8015, the Deliv-
ering for America Act. Our courageous 
postal workers and letter carriers have 
been essential in keeping our country 
on track during this pandemic. More of 
us than ever are relying on the U.S. 
Postal Service to safely deliver medi-
cation and mail in a timely manner. 
But now, this handpicked Postmaster 
General is engineering an unconstitu-
tional assault against the Postal Serv-
ice from the inside out. 
I saw it myself just yesterday in 
Charlotte. Mail sorting machines have 
been reassembled and removed. Work-
ers are being prohibited from working 
overtime. Letters and packages are pil-
ing up. 
I was proud to help lead the charge of 
Chairwoman MALONEY, Chairman CON-
NOLLY, and Mr. DEFAZIO earlier this 
month in a letter we wrote to Speaker 
PELOSI. Now, I am proud to vote in 
favor of protecting the essential insti-
tution. The U.S. Postal Service has 
been delivering for us our entire lives. 
Now it is time that we deliver for them 
and for America. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to vote in favor of H.R. 8015. 
Mr. COMER. Madam Speaker, may I 
inquire how much time each side has 
remaining. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from Kentucky has 4 minutes 
remaining. The gentlewoman from New 
York has 51⁄2 minutes remaining. 
Mr. COMER. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute 
to the distinguished gentleman from 
Colorado (Mr. NEGUSE). 
Mr. NEGUSE. Madam Speaker, I 
thank Chairwoman MALONEY for her 
leadership. 
Madam Speaker, I am proud to speak 
in strong support of the Delivering for 
America Act. 
I have been here on the floor listen-
ing to this debate, and I have heard 
several of my Republican colleagues 
describe this as a manufactured crisis. 
Tell that to my constituents. 
Tell that to Kelsey, a small business 
owner in Loveland, Colorado, who is 
worried about her ability to get pack-
ages delivered on time to her cus-
tomers because of delays at the Postal 
Service. 
Manufactured crisis? Tell that to 
Marsha, my constituent in Boulder, 
who depends on mail-order prescrip-
tions, which this month took nearly 2 
weeks to arrive. 
This is not a manufactured crisis. 
There is a real crisis at the Postal 
Service under this Postmaster General, 
and we, here in the House, strive to fix 
it. 
That is why I am a strong supporter 
of the bill that is before the House 
today, ultimately to ensure that the 
current standards of the Postal Service 
are protected and provide $25 billion in 
emergency funding. 
Let us get this done for the American 
people. 
b 1630 
Mr. COMER. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute 
to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. 
GREEN). 
Mr. GREEN of Texas. Madam Speak-
er, it is shameful and sinful that his-
tory will record that, on the great 
issues of our time, many of them, the 
Senate failed to act. On issues con-
cerning life and death, the Senate of 
the United States of America refused 
to act. 
On the great issue of the HEROES 
Act, which has lifesaving implica-
tions—some 86,000 have died since it 
was passed—the Senate has failed to 
act. 
On the issue of delivering lifesaving 
medications by way of the Postal Serv-
ice, when the Postal Service needs our 
help, the Senate has refused to act. 
And a Senate that refuses to act puts 
the actions of the House at risk, be-
cause the truth is this: It takes an act 
of Congress to help these entities; it 
takes an act of Congress to help the 
people of the United States of America; 
and you cannot get an act of Congress 
if the Senate refuses to act. 
Mr. COMER. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute 
to the gentlewoman from Ohio (Ms. 
KAPTUR), 
the 
chair 
of 
the 
Sub-
committee on Energy and Water Devel-
opment, and Related Agencies of the 
Committee on Appropriations. 
Ms. KAPTUR. Madam Speaker, I rise 
as a former letter carrier in support of 
H.R. 8015, to prevent the dangerous 
budget and service cuts proposed by 
Postmaster General DeJoy. 
The Postmaster General claims he 
has not taken any steps to limit over-
time for postal employees. His state-
ment is hollow, because internal Postal 
Service documents show how policy 
changes prohibit ‘‘extra’’ or ‘‘late’’ 
trips, which means you finish deliv-
ering the mail in your bag that day, 
and they mandate that carriers ‘‘re-
turn on time,’’ which means they can’t 
finish the job. 
In normal times, the Postal Service 
is crucial, but during a pandemic, on- 
time and efficient mail delivery is a 
matter of life and death. 
Today’s legislation will not just pro-
tect the Postal Service, but, given that 
people’s homes are now polling places, 
the service protects the very essence of 
our democracy. 
Don’t mess with USPS. 
Mr. COMER. Mr. Speaker, I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Mr. Speaker, I yield 30 seconds 
to the gentlewoman from California 
(Ms. LEE). 
Ms. LEE of California. Mr. Speaker, 
we see across the country the disman-
tling of the Postal Service, which has 
been a lifeline in American life. 
My constituents are terrified, and 
they are angry because they are not re-
ceiving their medications on time; 
delays are hurting our small busi-
nesses; and they are outraged that 
their constitutional right to vote could 
be taken away. 
This is not only an attack on our de-
mocracy but also on our workforce he-
roes, who, in spite of the pandemic, de-
liver our mail. Forty percent of these 
heroes are people of color. My grand-
father retired as a letter carrier after 
35 years of service.

H4293 
August 22, 2020 
I urge an ‘‘aye’’ vote to support, rath-
er than to destroy, our Postal Service. 
Mr. COMER. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self the balance of my time. 
Mr. Speaker, despite the passionate 
arguments made by supporters of H.R. 
8015, the truth is simple: The new Post-
master General is not trying to sabo-
tage the election. He is doing the exact 
opposite. In fact, he is ensuring that 
States are educated on the reality of 
the Postal Service operations so that 
enough time is given for American citi-
zens to vote by mail if they choose to 
do so. 
Just yesterday, the Board of Gov-
ernors announced a bipartisan com-
mittee to focus on election mail issues. 
Voting by mail is a crucial way that 
American citizens can exercise their 
constitutional right to vote, and it is 
important that all ballots be counted. 
The Postal Service will be able to 
handle an increase in mail volume 
ahead of the election as they have al-
ready handled a larger volume of Cen-
sus forms and stimulus checks earlier 
this year. 
This increase in mail will also bring 
in revenue, strengthening the U.S. 
Postal Service’s fiscal outlook. Let’s 
not forget that the Postal Service al-
ready has approximately $15 billion in 
cash on hand, which will allow it to be 
operational through August of 2021. It 
also has a $10 billion line of credit from 
the CARES Act that it has not drawn 
down. 
The USPS clearly does not need a 
bailout for the 2020 election season. To 
provide these funds without a concrete 
business reform plan that modernizes 
the post office for long-term viability 
would be reckless. 
We all want to see an operational, ef-
ficient Postal Service that best serves 
every American. My grandmother was 
a rural mail carrier for 27 years. As 
both her grandson and as a Representa-
tive elected by rural Kentuckians, I 
know firsthand the importance of a re-
liable Postal Service in helping small 
businesses thrive, ensuring Americans 
get their medications on time, and al-
lowing folks to share greeting cards 
with loved ones. 
Americans deserve an improved Post-
al Service, but this bill potentially 
makes things worse. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Mr. Speaker, delivering the mail 
and medications and ballots, this is a 
part of our Constitution. It is impor-
tant to our democracy. 
And numbers don’t lie. This internal 
report from the Postal Service shows 
that services are down 10 percent since 
this Postmaster General took charge. 
I want to publicly thank the Speaker 
of this great body for her leadership 
and for calling this emergency meeting 
and emergency vote. And there was no 
change in service until she called the 
meeting and vote. 
I thank you for standing up to the 
American people and fighting for their 
services and their democracy and their 
vote. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the 
gentlewoman 
from 
California 
(Ms. 
PELOSI), the distinguished Speaker of 
the United States Congress, the first 
woman in history, as we celebrate the 
100th anniversary of women gaining 
the right to vote. 
We are so proud of you and your lead-
ership. 
Ms. PELOSI. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentlewoman for her kind words of 
introduction, but I most importantly 
want to thank her for being the cham-
pion, the champion in defense of the 
Postal Service. I rise to join her in sup-
port of the Delivering for America Act, 
to protect lives, livelihood, and the life 
of our American democracy during a 
critical moment for our Nation. 
I thank you, Madam Chair, again, for 
the intellectual resource you have been 
in shaping the legislation, for making 
us current in terms of the reports from 
the Postal Service, what is at stake, 
and why this legislation, Mr. Speaker, 
is so important. 
I salute House Democrats for their 
enthusiasm, energy, and insistence on 
delivering for America. Since day one 
of the postal crisis, they have conveyed 
the concerns of their communities to 
Congress, holding events, accelerating 
a drumbeat, and shining light on this 
crisis. 
I am going to talk about three 
things, Mr. Speaker and Madam Chair 
and Mr. Ranking Member. This is 
about the provenance of the postal sys-
tem and how important it has been to 
America, also what the challenges are 
in delaying service and, therefore, why 
this legislation is so necessary. 
First, let me say that, in the Con-
stitution of the United States, it says 
that Congress shall have the power to 
establish post offices and post roads, 
Article I, Section 8. So the post office 
is there in the Constitution. 
But even before that, it has been a 
pillar of American democracy. It is an 
all-American institution, which enjoys 
the overwhelming support of the Amer-
ican people for a reason. Again, en-
shrined in the Constitution, an insepa-
rable part of our national story, help-
ing transition America from colonies 
to country. 
In the early 1770s, our Founders re-
lied on the precursor of the Postal 
Service, 
the 
Committees 
of 
Cor-
respondence, to educate people about 
the abuses of the British and to build 
support for independence. 
Even before the Declaration of Inde-
pendence was signed, the Continental 
Congress had established the Postal 
Service as one of the first and most im-
portant offices that would be part of 
the new government. 
Two of our U.S. Presidents, Abraham 
Lincoln and Harry Truman, would 
proudly hold the title of postmaster. 
One of our Founders, Benjamin Frank-
lin, was the Postmaster General. Actu-
ally, he established the Postal Service. 
So this goes to the heart of our coun-
try and the connection that the Postal 
Service, throughout our history, from 
the very start, has been in tying our 
country together. 
In the early 19th century, when vis-
iting America to write his great book, 
‘‘Democracy in America,’’ Alexis de 
Tocqueville praised the Postal Service 
as being the great link between minds, 
writing that not ‘‘in the most enlight-
ened rural districts of France there is 
an intellectual movement either so 
rapid or on such a scale as’’ this, as the 
Postal Service. 
So it has been excellent from the 
start, part of the unity of America. 
As we all know, the postal motto 
states: ‘‘Neither snow nor rain nor heat 
nor gloom of night stays these couriers 
from the swift completion of their ap-
pointed rounds.’’ 
As Members of Congress, we have a 
responsibility to ensure that those cou-
rageous couriers are not stayed from 
their constitutional duty to serve the 
American people. 
I join you, Madam Chair, in saluting 
the patriotic men and women who risk 
their health and safety to serve the 
American people every day: our postal 
workers, our letter carriers, and all 
who may bring us together. 
There is a second postal motto in-
scribed above the original Washington, 
D.C., Post Office, and this is really so 
clearly what the Postal Service has 
been about: 
Messenger of Sympathy and Love 
Servant of Parted Friends 
Consoler of the Lonely 
Bond of the Scattered Family 
Enlarger of the Common Life 
Carrier of News and Knowledge 
Instrument of Trade and Industry 
Promoter of Mutual Acquaintance 
Of Peace and of Goodwill Among Men and 
Nations. 
Our Postal Service is the beautiful 
thread that connects our country, de-
livering sympathy and love, news and 
knowledge, peace and goodwill. And as 
a grandmother, I will say, we have seen 
our children and grandchildren write 
their letters to Santa; we have seen 
messages come from the tooth fairy; 
we have seen photos and drawings of 
families taking joy in each other that 
no amount of social media can convey. 
So, again, we must honor their serv-
ice with our full support and protection 
and gratitude for what they mean in 
our lives. 
Today, the Postal Service—and this 
is why this is so important that we 
have this legislation—provides critical 
services for Americans in every corner 
of the country: for our workers, deliv-
ering paychecks and tax returns; for 
our seniors, ensuring Social Security 
benefits; for small businesses, pro-
viding shipping and essential services; 
for millions of Americans, particularly 
rural Americans, delivering 1.2 billion 
prescriptions, including most of the 
medications delivered by the VA. 
In 2019, 1.2 billion prescriptions were 
delivered by the Postal Service, and 
that was before the coronavirus hit.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4294 
August 22, 2020 
And for voters: Delivering absentee 
ballots and election mail, which is es-
sential, 
especially 
during 
the 
coronavirus epidemic. No one should be 
forced to choose between his or her 
health and the right to vote. 
Across the Nation, though, the Post-
master General is pushing sweeping 
new operational changes that degrade 
service, delay the mail, and threaten to 
disenfranchise voters, particularly in 
communities of color. 
Now the Postmaster says he will 
postpone any further changes until 
after the election, that is what he says. 
But this is about more than the elec-
tion. This legislation is written in a 
timely 
fashion 
to 
be 
about 
the 
coronavirus, and these changes should 
be there until the end of January or 
the end of the raging epidemic, which-
ever is later. 
It is in that regard that I rise as 
Speaker to support the legislation. But 
as a representative of my district 
where I am not called Madam Speaker, 
I am called NANCY, this is what they 
have told me. 
Michael said, he is a veteran with 
epilepsy. He reports that prescriptions 
sent by the VA through the mail are 
taking twice as long to arrive. 
Walker says, he is a senior with de-
bilitating health conditions, is now 
struggling to send and receive his mail 
after his closest mailbox was suddenly 
removed. 
Claire, an 83-year-old with serious 
chronic illness, who does not have a car 
and is afraid to use public transport 
during the pandemic, is in a panic be-
cause she is utterly dependent on 
USPS for her medication and other 
vital deliveries, and of course, her bal-
lot. 
Another San Franciscan, Charlotte, 
warns that the Postal Service is vital 
to our country, not only when it comes 
to mail and voting, but also for funda-
mental needs of Americans. 
And as Mark, another constituent, 
puts it, not only does what Trump is 
doing put the integrity of the Novem-
ber elections at risk; people are suf-
fering every day, and they are not re-
ceiving their critical medications. 
That is what I am hearing from my 
constituents, and they are told to go to 
the drug store. Well, they really can’t 
in some cases. It endangers them to go 
to the drugstore, instead of getting it 
through the mail. Go to the drugstore. 
So, again, this is immediate in their 
lives. We are their representatives. 
That is our job title and our job de-
scription. In representing my constitu-
ents, I wanted to convey some samples 
of concern that we have heard. 
Earlier this week, in response to the 
activism of the American people, peo-
ple have risen up, I have never seen 
anything quite like it. The Postmaster 
General announced changes that are 
wholly insufficient and do not reverse 
damage already wreaked. He said to 
me, frankly—and I have to give him 
credit for his honesty—he said, I have 
no intention of replacing the sorting 
machines that were removed from the 
post offices; 
I have no intention of replacing the 
blue mailboxes that have been ripped 
from our neighborhoods; and 
He has no plans for ensuring ade-
quate overtime, which is critical, crit-
ical for the timely delivery of the mail. 
He said he has no intention of treat-
ing ballots as first-class mail. Now, 
yesterday he said something different, 
but that is what he told me a couple of 
days ago. 
And I said to him, We will have the 
provision in the bill that requires you 
treat ballots as first-class mail. And he 
said, Well, if it is in the bill, then I will 
have to do it. Hence, his change of atti-
tude. 
He has not adequately addressed 
America’s concerns about the slow-
down and the delivery of medicine to 
veterans. He just didn’t even seem to 
know about it. Really? 
Today, Chairwoman MALONEY
re-
leased new internal post office docu-
ments that expose the severity of the 
service declines and delivery delays 
caused by the Postmaster General’s 
drastic changes. 
These documents make clear that the 
Postmaster General has deliberately 
misled Congress and the American peo-
ple about the extent of the damage, 
brushing them off as a dip in service or 
as unintended consequences. These rev-
elations show that we cannot have con-
fidence that the Postmaster General is 
prioritizing the Postal Service or the 
millions who rely on it. 
Now, the House is moving forward 
with a, hopefully, bipartisan vote, and 
I think it will be, on Delivering for 
America Act, which will reverse the 
Trump damage and provided $25 billion 
to the United States Postal Service. 
Sadly, the administration has al-
ready threatened to veto this legisla-
tion, which contains the same amount 
of funding, the $25 billion, that was rec-
ommended by the United States Postal 
Service Board of Governors. They are 
bipartisan. They are 100 percent ap-
pointed by Donald Trump, and they 
unanimously recommended the $25 bil-
lion that is contained in this bill. 
So for the sake of every senior who is 
delayed in getting his or her Social Se-
curity check, every veteran who is de-
layed in getting his or her medication, 
every working family who is delayed in 
getting their paycheck, and every 
voter now facing the prospect of choos-
ing between their vote and their 
health, we need to pass this bill. 
Mr. Speaker, with that, I urge a 
strong bipartisan vote for H.R. 8015, the 
Delivery for America Act. Let’s pass 
this under the leadership of distin-
guished Chairwoman MALONEY for the 
people. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the 
balance of my time. 
Ms. LOFGREN. Mr. Speaker, I rise in sup-
port of H.R. 8015. 
This upcoming 2020 general election will be 
like no other we have witnessed. Americans 
will cast their vote to elect a new government 
amidst a dangerous pandemic that has dev-
astated countless American families. To date, 
over 170,000 Americans have died due to 
COVID–19 and over 5.6 million Americans 
have been infected. The pandemic has dis-
rupted our health, economy and our way of 
life, including our democratic traditions. Ameri-
cans are rightfully worried about how to safely 
cast their vote this November. 
Public health experts agree that voters will 
be empowered to protect themselves and their 
families by having safe voting options, which 
includes absentee voting. Having the option to 
vote by mail ensures that voters who cannot 
vote in person don’t have to choose between 
their health and their right to vote. 
The engine of voting by mail is the United 
States Postal Service. In every election, postal 
workers provide an essential service to our 
democracy by processing and delivering mil-
lions of absentee ballots for domestic, over-
seas and military voters. This November, sev-
eral million Americans will depend on the 
Postal Service to exercise their right to vote. 
But in recent months, new leadership at the 
Postal Service directed drastic operational pol-
icy changes that disrupted mail processing 
and slowed mail delivery nationwide. The im-
pact of the delays has been harmful to Ameri-
cans, especially senior citizens, veterans and 
the sick, who depend on the Postal Service to 
receive medications, retirement checks and 
other essentials. Former Postal Service execu-
tives, election administrators and voter advo-
cacy groups have warned that ongoing delays 
in mail services will likely disenfranchise vot-
ers that will cast absentee ballots this Novem-
ber. 
The Delivering for America Act will work to 
restore prompt and reliable mail delivery serv-
ices to the American people. The bill rolls 
back the recent disruptive operational changes 
at the Postal Service and prohibits the Postal 
Service 
from 
implementing 
any 
further 
changes that will delay mail and reduce deliv-
ery standards. 
The bill also works to protect access to ab-
sentee voting and prevent voter disenfran-
chisement caused by delayed mail. It does 
this by ensuring that all election mail, including 
absentee ballots, will be treated as first-class 
mail, and will receive a postmark, or other in-
dicia indicating date of receipt. In addition to 
protecting the absentee voting system, these 
changes will help maintain trust and con-
fidence in the Postal Service. 
And lastly, the bill will appropriate much 
needed funding support to the Postal Service 
in the amount of $25 billion which will help en-
sure the long-term financial stability of the 
agency, and was requested by the Board of 
Governors appointed by President Donald 
Trump. 
As November 3rd nears, and the COVID–19 
pandemic continues to threaten American life 
and health, our duty today, as representatives 
of the American people, is to safeguard the 
American people’s right to essential mail serv-
ices and the right to vote. The Delivering for 
America Act, if enacted, will put into the place 
the necessary measures to ensure we fulfill 
this duty, and so I urge my colleagues to sup-
port this critical legislation. 
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speak-
er, the Postal Service is a lifeline to rural com-
munities. While some Americans have had the 
opportunity to work from home during this

pandemic, our letter carriers and postmasters 
do not. They’re working tirelessly to ensure 
people in every comer to the country are get-
ting their mail and packages, which for our at- 
risk population, has been especially critical. 
I’ve been supportive of the $25 billion in 
emergency funding included in this legislation 
and I’m relieved that at the urging of members 
like myself and the postal workers, a dan-
gerous private right of action provision, which 
would have allowed trial lawyers to take ad-
vantage of the 2020 election, was removed. 
As someone who has worked across the 
aisle to support the Postal Service, I was dis-
appointed when it recently became a political 
weapon. 
We should not be politicizing the Postal 
Service and in tum, the thousands of hard-
working employees that serve each of our dis-
tricts. 
As Ranking Member of House Administra-
tion, I’ll tell you that, while I’m supportive of 
this bill, it is not going to solve our election ad-
ministration problems. 
Despite early warnings from the Postal 
Service, at least eighteen states still have bal-
lot request and return policies that are incom-
patible with their delivery standards, which sig-
nificantly increases the risk of disenfranchising 
voters. 
We saw hundreds of thousands of ballots 
during recent primaries across the country go 
uncounted for this very issue. NPR estimates 
nearly a half a million were rejected—dis-
proportionately disenfranchising minority and 
younger voters. 
Despite early warnings from the Postal 
Service, unrealistic ballot request and return 
policies continue to be one of the biggest im-
pediments to ensuring every vote is counted. 
A recent poll found 59 percent of Americans 
still prefer to vote in person, yet there’s noth-
ing in this bill to help states allow people to 
safely go to the polls. 
So I’m not voting for this bill because I think 
the post office is trying to sabotage our elec-
tions, I’m voting for this bill because we’re in 
the middle of a pandemic, the Postal Service 
is vital to our society, and they need our help. 
And while I’m glad we’re back here for a 
special session to help the Postal Service, I 
wish we were also voting on a deal to help our 
schools, small businesses, and the millions of 
people still out of work because of the pan-
demic. 
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong 
support of the Delivering for America Act (H.R. 
8015), which would restore normal U.S. Postal 
Service (USPS) operations and prohibit the 
Trump Administration from implementing or 
approving any changes that would impede 
service during the COVID–19 pandemic. The 
bill also provides $25 billion in emergency 
funding, matching the level requested by the 
bipartisan Board of Governors, and which the 
House passed as part of the Heroes Act in 
May. 
For over two and a half centuries, our na-
tion’s Postal Service has stood as an inde-
pendent, neutral entity focused solely on con-
necting Americans and providing essential 
services. This independence has allowed the 
Postal Service to maintain its status as the 
country’s most trusted government agency for 
decades. 
Over the past several weeks, the Trump Ad-
ministration has turned the Postal Service into 
an instrument of partisan politics by enabling 
Postmaster General DeJoy to implement 
harmful and unprecedented operational and 
service changes at the Postal Service, such 
as reducing overtime, restricting deliveries, 
and eliminating sorting machines and mail-
boxes. These actions have resulted in unac-
ceptable wait times for mail across the coun-
try, delaying timely delivery of prescription 
medication and other vital mail, and endan-
gering our upcoming election. 
Following heavy criticism, the Postmaster 
General issued a wholly insufficient and mis-
leading pause in operational changes. But it is 
now clear after his testimony before the Sen-
ate Committee on Homeland Security and 
Governmental Affairs, that he has no intention 
of taking meaningful action to reverse the 
damage that the Postmaster General’s sweep-
ing changes have inflicted. Additionally, the 
pause does nothing to ensure voters that their 
election ballots will be delivered in time if they 
mail their ballots account to their state’s dead-
lines. Finally, the pause is only temporary, and 
the damaging changes are set to return after 
the election. Two weeks ago, I called for the 
Postmaster General to resign. Today, I repeat 
that call and stand firm that he must step 
down. 
The Trump Administration’s efforts to sabo-
tage the Postal Service have endangered the 
lives and livelihoods of millions who rely on 
the USPS for essential services like delivering 
life-saving medications, medical equipment, 
Social Security benefits and paychecks. The 
Postmaster General’s decision to impose 
these dangerous changes in the middle of an 
ongoing pandemic has magnified the disrup-
tion of many of these vital services. 
The use of mail-order prescriptions, for in-
stance, has increased by 20 percent during 
the pandemic. Due to the degradation of serv-
ice, mail-order medications are reportedly tak-
ing weeks to be delivered, forcing patients to 
skip doses of life-saving medicines. Veterans 
throughout the country have reportedly faced 
wait times of three weeks or more for mail- 
order medications, which has left the Depart-
ment of Veterans Affairs scrambling to find al-
ternative delivery services. 
Stopping these changes and reversing the 
damage already done is not enough. We must 
provide the additional funding in this bill to en-
sure services continue uninterrupted through 
the election and the pandemic. But in the 
President’s own words, he opposes any emer-
gency funding because he believes that with-
out it, the Postal Service will not be able to 
handle the estimated influx of mail-in ballots in 
the upcoming general election. The President 
himself has voted by mail in the last three 
elections but continues to attack mail-in voting 
as rife with fraud. In reality, voting fraud of all 
forms is extremely rare, and that’s especially 
true with mail-in voting, whose fraud rates are 
immeasurably small. Oregon, the first state to 
expand mail-in ballots to general elections, 
has sent out more than 100 million mail-in bal-
lots since 2000, and has documented less 
than a dozen cases of fraud. 
With the number of Americans voting by 
mail for the election expected to more than 
double from the last due to the pandemic, 
Congress must protect the right of every 
American to vote. If Congress fails to act, we 
risk permanent damage to the integrity of our 
elections and our government institutions; we 
risk the livelihoods of farmers and workers 
around this country who rely on the USPS; 
and we risk the health and lives of our sen-
iors, veterans, and millions of other patients 
who rely on mail-order medications during a 
pandemic that has now claimed the lives of 
nearly 175,000 people in the U.S. Finally, we 
risk the disenfranchisement of seniors and 
other higher-risk individuals whose safest op-
tion is casting mail-in ballots. 
Protecting the integrity of the Postal Service 
should never be a partisan issue. Congress 
must pass the Delivering for America Act, and 
work quickly to reverse the substantial dam-
age inflicted by the Trump Administration. 
I urge my colleagues to vote Yay and the 
Senate to take up this bill immediately. 
Ms. JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, 
today, at a time when the United States Postal 
Service is needed more than ever before, I am 
proud to stand in support of H.R. 8015, the 
Delivering for America Act. 
Ahead of the November elections, we must 
focus all efforts and resources to ensure that 
voting is safe, fair, and accessible for all. 
That’s why I am pleased that the Delivering for 
America Act includes a requirement for elec-
tion mail to be considered first-class, a ban on 
the removal of mail sorting machines, and a 
total reversal of any policies hindering the de-
livery of mail. 
Election mail is not the only mail impacted 
by the recent changes. In my district, I have 
heard stories from my constituents about 
delays in delivery for vital medications, bills, 
and other important packages through the 
mail. At a time when seniors and those with 
preexisting conditions are unable to go out in 
public to pharmacies, or when those who lost 
their jobs see the bills piling up, timely deliv-
eries should be the least of their worries. 
This past week, I had the opportunity to 
meet with the Dallas County Postal Service 
and Union leaders to address the role of the 
federal government in protecting the proc-
esses, operations, and service standards for 
the USPS. There, I was glad to hear that ev-
erything was running up to speed thanks to 
the hardworking men and women—who risk 
their health day in and day out—to guarantee 
that our mail is delivered. 
The USPS boasts one of the most diverse 
workforces in the country. In Texas, African 
Americans and Latinos make up a significant 
percentage of employees, and more than 50 
percent are women. Because minority commu-
nities 
are 
disproportionately 
affected 
by 
COVID–19, proper PPE is necessary for their 
safety—which this bill provides funding for. It 
also prohibits a restriction on the use of over-
time pay for USPS employees and prevents 
the institution of a hiring freeze, to ensure that 
they are equitably compensated for their ef-
forts. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to sup-
port this measure and hope for its immediate 
consideration in the Senate. 
Mr. THOMPSON of California. Mr. Speaker, 
I rise in strong support of H.R. 8015, the De-
livering for America Act. This legislation will 
put a stop to Postmaster General Louis 
DeJoy’s sabotage of the U.S. Postal Service 
and help reverse the damage that has already 
been done. H.R. 8015 will prohibit operational 
or service changes during the COVID public 
health emergency and ensure the level of 
service that was in place on January 1, 2020. 
The bill also includes $25 billion to help shore 
up postal operations that have been badly im-
pacted by the pandemic.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4296 
August 22, 2020 
I have been deeply disturbed by recent 
operational and organizational changes at 
USPS designed to sabotage mail delivery 
service ahead of our 2020 presidential elec-
tion. In his brief tenure as Postmaster Gen-
eral, Mr. DeJoy—a major contributor to the 
President’s reelection campaign—has pushed 
through sweeping changes to mail delivery 
processes and procedures, dismantled vital 
mail sorting equipment, and undertaken a 
major restructuring intended to sideline career 
postal officials. This nakedly partisan attempt 
to subvert democracy and undermine con-
fidence in the integrity of our election process 
is unconscionable and unacceptable. The 
Postmaster General should be ashamed of 
himself. 
The USPS is a vital lifeline to millions of 
people across our country, especially now. 
Veterans and seniors rely on the mail to get 
prescriptions, people are staying connected 
with loved ones through mail while sheltering 
at home, and more voters will cast their ballots 
by mail this year than ever before. Fast, reli-
able postal service is critical to providing these 
essential services. Yet, my office has received 
numerous complaints of late or inconsistent 
mail service since the Postmaster General’s 
changes went into effect. One constituent, a 
senior from Napa, wrote to me afraid her nec-
essary medication would be useless by the 
time it arrived. The medication, which is tem-
perature sensitive and usually takes 2–3 days 
to deliver, hadn’t shown up in more than 10. 
Our letter carriers are dedicated to providing 
our communities the highest level of service. 
Since the founding of our Post Office, they 
have lived by the motto: ‘‘Neither snow nor 
rain nor heat nor gloom of night stays these 
couriers from the swift completion of their ap-
pointed rounds.’’ The Delivering for America 
Act will help ensure postal employees can 
keep this oath. That’s why I am proud to sup-
port and to be a coauthor of the legislation. I 
urge a yes vote. 
Mr. DANNY K. DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speak-
er, I rise in support of our Postal Service and 
in support of its mission to serve our people, 
in support of its role in our democracy, in our 
elections, in support of its role in delivering 
vital goods and services critical to the health 
and well-being of our people and our economy 
and in support of the men and women of the 
Postal Service who have added the pandemic 
to the list of barriers they cast aside each day 
in their daily rounds. 
Mr. Speaker, I note that we do not require 
that our government departments and agen-
cies show a ‘‘profit.’’ That is not their purpose. 
We do not defend our country for a ‘‘profit.’’ 
We do not educate our children for a ‘‘profit.’’ 
We do not protect our environment for a ‘‘prof-
it.’’ 
Mr. Speaker, we long ago rejected the 
Luddite movement which advocated breaking 
machines in a futile effort to turn back sci-
entific and technological progress. Breaking 
and discarding postal sorting machines is sab-
otage today, just as it was in the 1800s. 
Mr. Speaker, I am deeply troubled by the 
alarming delays in First-Class, marketing, and 
Priority Mail documented by the Postal Serv-
ice’s own briefing packet for the Postmaster 
General from last week. I have seen evidence 
of these delays in the pictures sent and the 
stories told to me by postal employees. 
Mr. Speaker, I proudly cast my vote in sup-
port of the request from the Postal Board of 
Governors for $25 billion in aid and in support 
of H.R. 8015, the Delivering for America Act. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. 
HIMES). All time for debate has expired. 
Pursuant to House Resolution 1092, 
the previous question is ordered on the 
bill, as amended. 
The question is on the engrossment 
and third reading of the bill. 
The bill was ordered to be engrossed 
and read a third time, and was read the

to any act that would be a violation of such 
paragraph taken on or after the date of en-
actment of this Act. 
In section 3, add at the end after the period 
the following: ‘‘Such funds may only be used 
for operating expenses and may not be used 
to pay any outstanding debt of the Postal 
Service: Provided further, That during the 
COVID–19 emergency, the Postal Service 
shall use a portion of such funds to prioritize 
the delivery of postal products for ballots re-
lated to Federal election mail and medical or 
pharmaceutical delivery purposes and may 
establish temporary delivery points, in such 
form and manner as the Postal Service de-
termines necessary, to protect employees of 
the Postal Service and individuals receiving 
deliveries from the Postal Service.’’ 
Mr. COMER (during the reading). Mr. 
Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that 
the Clerk dispense with the reading. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Kentucky? 
There was no objection. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from 
Kentucky is recognized for 5 minutes 
in support of his motion. 
Mr. COMER. Mr. Speaker, my col-
leagues on both sides of the aisle have 
shown immense passion today for both 
their constituents and the integrity of 
this upcoming national election. There 
is no doubt that voting by mail will be 
more relied upon than it has been in 
previous elections. 
The Postal Service will be a crucial 
link in the chain of custody between 
voters and State or local election 
boards. For the Americans who choose 
to cast their vote via mail, they need 
to be sure that their ballot, their voice, 
will be safe. We, therefore, need the 
proper measures in place to ensure that 
integrity is maintained. 
In addition, if we are going to give 
the Postal Service funding, I think my 
colleagues on both sides of the aisle 
need assurances that it will be spent 
where Americans need it more. The 
prioritization of medical deliveries and 
ballots for this election. 
My motion contains reasonable addi-
tions to H.R. 8015 that ensure that this 
funding gets to where it needs to go. 
These provisions ensure that funds 
must only be spent on operating ex-
penses to keep our postal workers paid 
and to keep them safe with personal 
protective equipment. 
These provisions will also ensure 
that a portion of these funds go to 
prioritizing pharmaceutical deliveries 
to get life-saving medicines to Ameri-
cans quicker. Lastly, these provisions 
ensure that these funds are used to 
prioritize ballots as well as establish 
penalties for postal employees who 
tamper or interfere with election mail. 
For instance, any postal employee 
will face penalties if they knowingly 
and willfully slow down the processing 
of mail or use their official authority 
to interfere with the election of a Fed-
eral candidate. This upcoming election 
will put millions, possibly hundreds of 
millions of votes, in the literal hands 
of Postal Service workers who we must 
trust to deliver ballots safely and on 
time. 
The election will put our collective 
faith in our Postal Service like we have 
never seen before, and those who break 
the trust of the Americans need to face 
the consequences. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
vote in favor of this motion to recom-
mit, and I yield back the balance of my 
time. 
Mrs. LAWRENCE. Mr. Speaker, I 
claim the time in opposition to the mo-
tion. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tlewoman from Michigan is recognized 
for 5 minutes. 
Mrs. LAWRENCE. Mr. Speaker, obvi-
ously, my colleagues on the other side 
of the aisle are not aware that fraud is 
a Federal—voter fraud is a crime. We 
have already established and funded 
the United States Postal Inspection 
Service. 
Little do they know, whenever an 
employee is in a postal facility, there 
are internal galleys in every facility 
where you are observed for 24 hours a 
day by postal inspectors. Mr. Speaker, 
I am very comfortable that we will ad-
here to those laws. We have clerks who 
have sworn duties to protect elections. 
But let me tell you, Mr. Speaker, 3 
months ago this House passed the HE-
ROES Act, and I ask my colleagues to

August 22, 2020 
open their mail because we sent them a 
letter that will protect the Postal 
Service. We sent them a letter saying 
that we need to send funding to the 
States and local governments so they 
will not defund the police departments. 
If you want to know who is defunding 
the police department, the lack of a 
movement in the Senate to send that 
necessary money to cities who must 
balance their budget. And the only way 
they can balance their budget is to cut 
because they don’t have the funding 
that has been taken away from them 
because of COVID. 
So you have the responsibility, Mr. 
Speaker, the Republicans have on their 
hands the defunding of our police de-
partment. I wanted, too, to be very 
clear that we have heard repeatedly 
that the Democrats had manufactured 
a crisis at the expense of this Presi-
dent, and that the emergency funding 
is ‘‘an unnecessary bailout plan.’’ 
We do not need to help the current 
President to create a crisis. We have 
seen every single day statements from 
the White House about what we are 
doing and what we should not do with 
the Postal Service. I want everyone 
here to know that every postal em-
ployee takes an oath that they will ad-
here to the Constitution, that they will 
serve and protect. 
The majority of the postal workers 
are veterans who have served in the 
military, who continue their service in 
the Postal Service. I want it to be very 
clear that this election that is being 
held hostage right now by the Postal 
Service’s internal decisions to tear it 
apart, where you have over 600,000 em-
ployees reporting to work who want to 
uphold their oath of office. 
I want to say today, Mr. Speaker, 
that the Postal Service motto is nei-
ther rain, snow, heat or gloom of night 
you will not deter these carriers from 
their mission. And we are standing 
here today saying, no. Return to sender 
this unnecessary MTR. That we, as 
Democrats, we are putting forth this 
bill to ensure that we are not in that 
place where we are going to try to 
deter the Postal Service from doing 
their job. 
Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to 
wake up, to understand that this is not 
a Democrat or Republican issue, be-
cause the ballots that are going to be 
moving through the Postal Service, 
some of them may even go to them, 
they better protect the Postal Service. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Without 
objection, the previous question is or-
dered on the motion to recommit. 
There was no objection. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion to recommit. 
The question was taken; and the 
Speaker pro tempore announced that 
the noes appeared to have it. 
Mr. COMER. Mr. Speaker, on that I 
demand the yeas and nays. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to section 3 of House Resolution 
965, the yeas and nays are ordered.

(H.R. 8089) to amend the Immigration 
and Nationality Act to expand pre-
mium processing for certain immigra-

and ask for its immediate consider-
ation in the House. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Maryland? 
There was no objection. 
The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 8089 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Emergency 
Stopgap USCIS Stabilization Act’’. 
SECTION 2. EXPANSION OF PREMIUM PROC-
ESSING. 
(a) IN GENERAL.—Section 286(u) of the Im-
migration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 
1356(u)) is amended to read as follows: 
‘‘(u) PREMIUM FEE FOR CERTAIN IMMIGRA-
TION BENEFIT TYPES.— 
‘‘(1) IN GENERAL.—The Secretary of Home-
land Security is authorized to establish and 
collect a premium fee for the immigration 
benefit types described in paragraph (2). 
Such fee shall be paid in addition to any 
other fees authorized by law, deposited as 
offsetting receipts in the Immigration Ex-
aminations Fee Account established under 
subsection (m), and used for the purposes de-
scribed in paragraph (4). 
‘‘(2) IMMIGRATION BENEFIT TYPES.—Subject 
to reasonable conditions or limitations, the 
Secretary shall establish a premium fee 
under paragraph (1) in connection with— 
‘‘(A) employment-based nonimmigrant pe-
titions and associated applications for de-
pendents of the beneficiaries of such peti-
tions; 
‘‘(B) employment-based immigrant peti-
tions filed by or on behalf of aliens described 
in paragraph (1), (2), or (3) of section 203(b); 
‘‘(C) applications to change or extend non-
immigrant status; 
‘‘(D) applications for employment author-
ization; and 
‘‘(E) any other immigration benefit type 
that the Secretary deems appropriate for 
premium processing. 
‘‘(3) AMOUNT OF FEE.— 
‘‘(A) IN GENERAL.—Subject to subparagraph 
(C), with respect to an immigration benefit 
type designated for premium processing by 
the Secretary on or before August 1, 2020, the 
premium fee shall be $2,500, except that the 
premium fee for a petition for classification 
of a nonimmigrant described in subpara-
graph (H)(ii)(b) or (R) of section 101(a)(15) 
shall be $1,500. 
‘‘(B) OTHER IMMIGRATION BENEFIT TYPES.— 
With respect to an immigration benefit type 
designated for premium processing but not 
described in subparagraph (A), the initial 
premium fee shall be established by regula-
tion, which shall include a detailed method-
ology supporting the proposed premium fee 
amount. 
‘‘(C) BIENNIAL ADJUSTMENT.—The Secretary 
may adjust a premium fee under subpara-
graph (A) or (B) on a biennial basis by the 
percentage (if any) by which the Consumer 
Price Index for All Urban Consumers for the 
month of June preceding the date on which 
such adjustment takes effect exceeds the 
Consumer Price Index for All Urban Con-
sumers for the same month of the second 
preceding calendar year. The provisions of 
section 553 of title 5, United States Code, 
shall not apply to an adjustment authorized 
under this subparagraph. 
‘‘(4) USE OF FEE.—Fees collected under this 
subsection may only be used by U.S. Citizen-
ship and Immigration Services to— 
‘‘(A) provide the services described in para-
graph (5) to premium processing requestors; 
‘‘(B) make infrastructure improvements in 
adjudications processes and the provision of 
information and services to immigration and 
naturalization benefit requestors; 
‘‘(C) respond to adjudication demands, in-
cluding by reducing the number of pending 
immigration and naturalization benefit re-
quests; and 
‘‘(D) otherwise offset the cost of providing 
adjudication and naturalization services. 
‘‘(5) PREMIUM
PROCESSING
SERVICES.—The 
Secretary— 
‘‘(A) may suspend the availability of pre-
mium processing for designated immigration 
benefit requests only if circumstances pre-
vent the completion of processing of a sig-
nificant number of such requests within the 
required period; and 
‘‘(B) shall ensure that premium processing 
requestors have direct and reliable access to 
current case status information as well as 
the ability to communicate with the pre-
mium processing units at each service center 
or office that provides premium processing 
services.’’. 
(b) EXPANSION TO NEW BENEFIT REQUESTS.— 
(1) IN
GENERAL.—Notwithstanding the re-
quirement to set a fee by regulation under 
section 286(u)(3)(B) of the Immigration and 
Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1356(u)(3)(B)), as 
amended by subsection (a), the Secretary of 
Homeland Security may set a fee under that 
section without regard to the provisions of 
section 553 of title 5, United States Code, if 
such fee is consistent with the following: 
(A) For a petition for classification under 
section 203(b)(1)(C) of the Immigration and 
Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1153(b)(1)(C)), or a 
petition for classification under section 
203(b)(2) involving a waiver under section 
203(b)(2)(B) of such Act, the fee is set at an 
amount not greater than $2,500 and the re-
quired processing timeframe is not greater 
than 45 days. 
(B) For an application under section 248 of 
the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 
U.S.C. 1258) to change status to a classifica-
tion described in subparagraph (F), (J), or 
(M) of section 101(a)(15) of such Act (8 U.S.C. 
1101(a)(15)), the fee is set at an amount not 
greater than $1,750 and the required proc-
essing timeframe is not greater than 30 days. 
(C) For an application under section 248 of 
the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 
U.S.C. 1258) to change status to be classified 
as a dependent of a nonimmigrant described 
in subparagraph (E), (H), (L), (O), (P), or (R) 
of section 101(a)(15) of such Act (8 U.S.C. 
1101(a)(15)), or to extend such classification, 
the fee is set at an amount not greater than 
$1,750 and the required processing timeframe 
is not greater than 30 days. 
(D) For an application for employment au-
thorization, the fee is set at an amount not 
greater than $1,500 and the required proc-
essing timeframe is not greater than 30 days. 
(2) 
CLARIFICATION.—The 
required 
proc-
essing timeframe for each of the applications 
and petitions described in paragraph (1) shall 
not commence until the date that all pre-
requisites for adjudication are received by 
the Secretary of Homeland Security. 
(c) OTHER BENEFIT REQUESTS.—In imple-
menting the amendments made by sub-
section (a), the Secretary of Homeland Secu-
rity shall develop and implement processes 
to ensure that the availability of premium 
processing, or its expansion to additional im-
migration benefit requests, does not result in 
an increase in processing times for immigra-
tion benefit requests not designated for pre-
mium processing or an increase in regular 
processing of immigration benefit requests 
so designated. 
SEC. 3. REPORTING REQUIREMENTS. 
(a) IN GENERAL.—Not later than 180 days

100TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE 19TH 
AMENDMENT 
HON. JOE WILSON 
OF SOUTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Saturday, August 22, 2020 
Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Madam 
Speaker, this past weekend we celebrated the 
100th anniversary of the 19th Amendment. I 
include in the RECORD an article from the The 
Aiken Standard that highlights women leaders 
in our community and the role that Eulalie 
Salley had in the suffragist movement: 
AIKEN’S WOMEN LEADERS REFLECT ON 19TH AMEND-
MENT’S
100TH
ANNIVERSARY, EULALIE
SALLEY’S 
ROLE 
(By Dede Biles August 15, 2020) 
Women leaders in the Aiken area reflected 
recently on this month’s 100th anniversary of 
the ratification of the U.S. Constitution’s 
19th Amendment, which guarantees that an 
American’s right to vote will not be denied 
on the basis of sex. 
They also discussed the legacy of Eulalie 
Salley, an Aiken resident who was a promi-
nent suffragist. 
Read what they had to say: 
Lessie Price, Aiken City Council member 
and Aiken Mayor Pro Tempore: ‘‘Those 
women (who fought for the right to vote) 
were very bold and brave. Can you imagine 
doing that during that period of time, what 
was said about them by their peers and the 
names they were probably called? 
‘‘Also there were pressures faced by their 
husbands because their wives were doing 
something that was not the norm. 
‘‘On both sides, there were enduring pres-
sures, but the women were so strong. Where 
would we be (as women) if those women were 
not brave enough or strong enough to take a 
stand and be a voice for us to have the free-
dom to vote? I am standing on the shoulders 
of those women and their history and them 
being trailblazers in the fight for equality. 
‘‘They fought for equality for all of us. And 
that’s the bottom line.’’ 
‘‘Eulalie Salley was quite outspoken, and 
we are fortunate to have had her as part of 
the Aiken community. 
‘‘She led an innovative campaign regarding 
suffrage.’’ 
Kay Biermann Brohl, Aiken City Council 
member: ‘‘I think it’s important that we cel-
ebrate this. It took so long for women to win 
that right to vote. 
‘‘And today we see so many women in lead-
ership positions. It brings a whole different 
perspective to the decisions that are made 
and how they are made. 
‘‘I think Eulalie Salley was a trailblazer. 
She did so many things that a lot of people 
are just finding out about, and she contrib-
uted greatly to the culture, the history and 
the fairness of how things are done here in 
Aiken.’’ 
Gail Diggs, Aiken City Council member: 
‘‘In 1920, women won the right to vote, and 
here we are in 2020 with the possibility of 
having a Black female vice president. It’s 
truly something to celebrate. I’m proud to 
know that Eulalie Salley was one of the 
women who led the way. We’ve come a long 
way, baby! 
‘‘Eulalie Salley was strong, outspoken and 
determined to make a change. For her, si-
lence was not an option. She saw something 
seriously wrong and not only said some-
thing, but actually DID something! 
‘‘She helped pave the way for women to 
have a voice. Eulalie Salley was a true 
woman of substance!’’ 
Dr. Sandra Jordan, Chancellor of USC 
Aiken: ‘‘The 19th Amendment was critical to 
the rights women enjoy today, for it finally 
guaranteed all women the right to vote dur-
ing our national, state and local elections. 
‘‘History 
teaches 
us 
that 
once 
disenfranchised groups can vote, other forms 
of equality, such as social, economic and 
educational opportunities will follow. 
‘‘While we may take this right for granted 
today, we should never lose sight of the fact 
that women gained civil rights quite late in 
the history of our nation. It would be a trav-
esty for modern-day men and women to dis-
miss the long, hard struggle that culminated 
in the passage of the 19th Amendment. 
‘‘While women have experienced many suc-
cesses since the passage of the amendment, 
women have not yet achieved full equality. I 
hope I will see in my lifetime our daughters 
and granddaughters achieve the dream of 
equal pay for equal work, freedom from har-
assment and freedom from discrimination 
based on gender. 
‘‘The dream of equality is worth the effort 
of keeping these issues on the forefront of 
our thinking, our actions and our national 
discussions. 
‘‘The university has many special ties to 
Eulalie Salley, a former Frist Lady of Aiken 
and a local suffragette, who used her per-
sonal earnings to underwrite her efforts to 
champion the cause. 
‘‘In fact, the Salley home now sits on the 
USC Aiken campus. 
‘‘Her tireless efforts to help secure this im-
portant civil right for half of the U.S. popu-
lation was recognized by the governor (of 
South Carolina) who invited her to stand be-
side him as he signed the bill into law. 
‘‘Her commitment to the 19th Amendment, 
which guaranteed all women equal rights, on 
par with men, including gaining the right to 
vote, is an inspiration for women today.’’

HONORING DR. BENJAMIN BELL 
AS IOWAN OF THE WEEK 
HON. CYNTHIA AXNE 
OF IOWA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Saturday, August 22, 2020 
Mrs. AXNE. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
ask the House of Representatives to join me 
in recognizing Dr. Benjamin C. Bell, Jr., a 
longtime pastor and community and family 
counselor in Des Moines, as our Iowan of the 
Week. 
One of the strongest traits that unites 
Iowans is our love of community. Whether it’s 
a favorite spot to fish, a connection group at 
church, or the best restaurant to grab a burg-
er, we love to share stories about the people 
and places that give our shared home char-
acter. What’s even better than Iowans’ love of 
community is their unparalleled dedication to 
investing in it. Through service of all stripes, 
Iowans strengthen their communities each 
day. 
Dr. Benjamin C. Bell, Jr. is a shining exam-
ple of an Iowan who not only loves his com-
munity, but also has gone above and beyond 
to improve it for those around him now and for 
generations to come. 
Born and raised in Des Moines, Dr. Bell’s 
life has been shaped by service to country 
and community. He learned about hard work 
and giving back by watching his father work 
the night shift and his mother cook at Drake 
University, where she’d provide extra food to 
those who didn’t have enough to eat at home. 
After graduating high school, Bell served sev-
eral years in the United States Marine Corps 
before finishing his tour and moving back 
home to Iowa to be near family and raise one 
of his own with his wife, Julie. 
Since then, Dr. Bell and Julie have put their 
community-mindedness and drive to help oth-
ers to work. For nearly three decades they co- 
pastored in church to provide community value 
and help people feel like they have some-
where to belong, especially in times of crisis. 
Dr. Bell co-founded Dads with a Purpose 
(DWP), a transformational counseling program 
for fathers and mothers to reach their potential 
as parents and to help effectively build strong 
families. Dads with a Purpose has been na-
tionally recognized for its curriculum: a series 
of expert-led classes and resources provided 
in a safe space for parents in challenging cir-
cumstances to talk about past barriers and 
how they can grow to create positive, 
generational change. DWP helps fathers and 
mothers to learn about themselves as men 
and women, as individual parents, and as part 
of a co-parenting team to create a healthier fu-
ture for themselves and their children. It helps 
hundreds of Iowans each year, including men 
and women transitioning out of correctional fa-
cilities, gain employment and improve their cir-
cumstances. 
Dr. Bell also lends his expertise to the 5th 
Judicial District to help men who have pre-
viously been domestically violent learn how to 
process anger, respect women, and resolve 
conflict. He serves as the Fatherhood Out-
reach Director at the YMCA, providing classes 
on how to communicate more effectively, deal 
with tough issues that affect fathers, and help 
successfully 
navigate 
child-support—which 
can drastically change an individual’s credit 
score and provide opportunities to move into a 
home and maintain a good job. Bell’s program 
also allows the participating fathers’ children to 
come play at the YMCA and have pizza for 
dinner while classes are taking place. 
Iowans take great pride in where we come 
from, and people are at the heart of what 
makes our home special. Dr. Bell has said: 
‘‘People may not remember your name, but 
they will remember how you made them feel.’’ 
This simple sentiment perfectly captures his 
inherently Iowan value of giving back for the 
good of others and his understanding of how 
important it is to treat people with the dignity 
human beings deserve. I am humbled and in-
spired by Dr. Bell’s lifetime of service, passion

REFLECTING ON THE LIFE OF 
BILL HALL, SR. 
HON. JOE CUNNINGHAM 
OF SOUTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Saturday, August 22, 2020 
Mr. CUNNINGHAM. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to reflect on the great life and legacy of 
Bill Hall, Sr. A remarkable businessman, dedi-
cated father, and Lowcountry icon, Bill Hall 
embodied the American dream. He built his 
legacy from the ground up. Bill started his ca-
reer bussing tables at age thirteen, moved up 
to grocery boy, and in the blink of an eye, his 
hard work left him running one of the most 
popular restaurants in the Palmetto State. 
Bill set a standard for hospitality and it start-
ed with a smile and a handshake. This is what 
you expected the minute you stepped into 
Hall’s Chophouse and Bill never failed to de-
liver. Running restaurants from coast to coast 
was a family affair. Jeanne Hall, the love of 
his life, was always by Bill’s side and his sons, 
Tommy and Billy Hall, can be found running 
operations at his establishments in the gentle-
manly fashion their father passed on to them. 
Bill loved his work, his family, and the 
Lowcountry. Our community is heartbroken by 
this loss as we mourn a phenomenal leader. 
My thoughts are with his loved ones and em-
ployees. Bill will be profoundly missed, but 
never forgotten.

AMERICAN TROOPS IN POLAND 
HON. JOE WILSON 
OF SOUTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Saturday, August 22, 2020 
Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Madam 
Speaker, this past week was a tremendous 
success for the Polish-U.S. Alliance. U.S. Sec-
retary of State Mike Pompeo sealed a defense 
cooperation agreement Saturday with Polish 
officials that will pave the way to deploy more 
American troops to Poland. President Donald 
Trump has fulfilled promises made, promises 
kept, to protect the citizens of Poland discour-
aging Putin threats. 
Pompeo signed the deal with Polish De-
fense Minister Mariusz Błaszczak that sets out 
the legal framework for the additional troops. 
The agreement would also further other as-
pects of U.S.-Polish cooperation primarily in 
investment and trade ties. 
Poland has agreed to construct multiple fa-
cilities to support more U.S. troops operating 
in that country. Some 4,500 U.S. troops are 
currently based in Poland, but about 1,000 
more are to be added. President Andrezej 
Duda of Poland has proudly cited this could 
be named Fort Trump. 
The pact signed Saturday supplements 
NATO efforts, and allows for the enhancement 
and modernization of existing capabilities and 
facilities by allowing U.S. forces to access ad-
ditional Polish military installations. It also sets 
out a formula for sharing the logistical and in-
frastructure costs of an expanded U.S. pres-
ence in the country. 
This complements additional NATO troops 
to be stationed in the Baltic Republics of Esto-
nia, Latvia, and Lithuania, These German, 
French, and British assets reinforce the vi-
brancy of NATO to deter Putin aggression with 
peace through strength. 
It is especially meaningful as we sadly re-
member the infamous Nazi and Soviet inva-
sion of Poland on September 1, 1939, which 
was schemed by the Molotov Ribbentrop Pact, 
leading to killing millions of Poles, the Holo-
caust, and the Katyn Forest massacre of 
22,000 Polish military, scholars, law enforce-
ment, and security personnel by Soviet Red 
Army troops. 
f 
IN RECOGNITION OF THE 
HONORABLE SLADE GORTON 
HON. RICK LARSEN 
OF WASHINGTON 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Saturday, August 22, 2020 
Mr. LARSEN of Washington. Madam Speak-
er, I rise to recognize the life and public serv-
ice of Senator Thomas Slade Gorton III. Sen-
ator Gorton passed away on Wednesday, Au-
gust 19, 2020. He was 92 years old. Before 
entering public office, Senator Gorton served 
his country in the United States Army and Air 
Force and later enlisted in the Air Force Re-
serves. He then served his state of Wash-
ington as State House Majority Leader, Attor-
ney General and for three terms as a United 
States Senator. 
After leaving office in 2000, Senator Gorton 
stayed active in public life. He served on the 
National Commission on Terrorist Attacks 
Upon the United States as well as the 2011 
Washington State Redistricting Commission. 
Slade Gorton will be remembered for always 
placing his state and country first. As Wash-
ington’s Attorney General, he broke with his 
party to call for the resignation of President 
Nixon. In the Senate, he again showed his 
independence by supporting the Equal Rights 
Amendment and women’s reproductive free-
dom. 
On the Armed Services Committee, he drew 
from his many years in uniform. As a diehard 
baseball fan, he worked hard to bring the 
Mariners to Seattle and ensure they stayed 
there. At every level of public service, Slade 
Gorton earned a reputation for bipartisanship, 
fairness and respectfulness. I join all Washing-
tonians in sharing my condolences and appre-
ciation with Senator Gorton’s family. 
f 
CONGRATULATING STEVE 
LOCKWOOD 
HON. STEVE COHEN 
OF TENNESSEE 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Saturday, August 22, 2020 
Mr. COHEN. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to congratulate my friend Steve Lockwood, 
who is retiring after more than 18 years as the 
executive director of the Frayser Community 
Development Corporation. In that role, Mr. 
Lockwood has seen a rebound in property val-
ues after the Great Recession and has worked 
to bring $30 million in redevelopment to 
Frayser’s MLK Zone surrounding Martin Luther 
King College Prep. Mr. Lockwood’s tenure 
with the agency is almost as old as the CDC 
itself, which was founded in January 2000. In 
what is obviously a labor of love, Mr. 
Lockwood has created an agency known for 
offering homebuyer education and financial lit-
eracy for residents of a market once defined 
by foreclosures. Mr. Lockwood’s mission- 
based focus has inspired his staff and his leg-
acy will be their continued successes. I wish 
him all the best in a well-deserved retirement. 
f 
REMEMBERING SEYMOUR PADNOS 
HON. BILL HUIZENGA 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Saturday, August 22, 2020 
Mr. HUIZENGA. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today in remembrance of Seymour Padnos of 
Holland, Michigan. The West Michigan com-
munity mourns the loss of Mr. Padnos and 
thanks him for his 60 years of serving our 
community as the CEO and then chairman of 
Padnos Iron and Metal Co. 
Mr. Padnos passed away at his longtime 
home in Holland, Ml and is remembered as a 
well-loved husband, father and grandfather 
who cared deeply about West Michigan and 
donated generously to institutions such as 
Grand Valley State University, Michigan Mari-
time Museum, Indian Trails Camps and oth-
ers. His early efforts to transform West Michi-
gan as a commercial shipping harbor has 
shown how the West Michigan spirit leads to 
community prosperity. 
Mr. Padnos’s lifetime of service to our com-
munity is truly something to celebrate, and I 
will be praying for his family during this time 
of grief. He is survived by his wife of 72 years, 
Esther (Roth), and their four children Mitchell, 
Shelley, Bill, Cindy, and grandson Louis 
Padnos. 
Madam Speaker, is because of dedicated 
community members such as Mr. Padnos that 
I am especially proud to serve Michigan’s 2nd 
Congressional District. I join with those in 
West Michigan in remembering the wonderful 
life and legacy that he has left behind.

PAKISTAN SANCTIONS TALIBAN 
HON. JOE WILSON 
OF SOUTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Saturday, August 22, 2020 
Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Madam 
Speaker, the Associated Press reports today 
that Pakistan issued sweeping financial sanc-
tions against Afghanistan’s Taliban. 
Prime Minister lmran Khan has taken bold 
action to protect the people of Pakistan. I per-
sonally still cherish my visits to Islamabad in-
cluding attending the joint U.S. Marine—Paki-
stan relief efforts at the earthquake in 
Muzaffarabad. 
President Donald Trump has successfully 
supported the Financial Action Task Force in 
Paris, which monitors money laundering and 
tracks terrorist groups. 
The orders, which were made public late on 
Friday, identified dozens of individuals, includ-
ing the Taliban’s chief peace negotiator Abdul 
Ghani Baradar and several members of the 
Haqqani family, including Sirajuddin, the cur-
rent head of the Haqqani network and deputy 
head of the Taliban. 
As well as the Taliban, the orders also tar-
get al-Qaida and the Islamic State affiliate 
which has carried out deadly attacks in both 
Pakistan and Afghanistan. 
They also take aim at outlawed Pakistani 
groups like Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP),

thousands of whom are believed by the U.N. 
to be hiding in remote regions of Afghanistan. 
The TTP has declared war on Pakistan, car-
rying out one of the worst terrorist attacks in 
the country in 2014 killing 145 children and 
their teachers at an army public school in 
northwest Pakistan. 
The orders also take aim at outlawed anti- 
Indian groups considered allied with the coun-
try’s security services. It is so mutually bene-
ficial for Pakistan and India at work together 
for peace and prosperity.

HONORING COACH STEELE 
KERRIDEN ‘‘KERRY’’ CROSWHITE 
HON. GREG STANTON 
OF ARIZONA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Saturday, August 22, 2020 
Mr. STANTON. Madam Speaker, I rise to 
honor the life and legacy of Coach Steele 
Kerriden ‘‘Kerry’’ Croswhite, who passed away 
Tuesday, July 21, 2020 due to complications 
from COVID–19 at the age of 61. For 17 years 
Coach 
Croswhite

Chandler 
High 
School as a social studies teacher, head 
coach for the school’s swim and dive team, 
and assistant coach for the softball program— 
a true pillar of excellence for the school’s aca-
demic and athletic programs, and an inspira-
tion for the thousands of students who had the 
great privilege to learn from him. A beloved 
member of the Chandler community, Coach 
Croswhite embodied a steadfast dedication to 
public education, Chandler High School, and 
service to others. 
Coach 
Croswhite’s 
impact 
resonated 
throughout the entire Chandler High commu-
nity. He was always ready with a word of en-
couragement and empathetic ear, and he 
emanated pride and joy when celebrating his 
students and his school. Not only an inspira-
tional teacher and coach, Coach Croswhite 
was known across campus for the bagpipes 
he played at school events, swim meets, foot-
ball games, and at the school’s annual Unity 
Assembly, where he donned a kilt in proud 
celebration of his ancestry. 
He was a selfless leader who devoted his 
career—without fanfare or in pursuit of rec-
ognition—to the students he taught and 
coached at Chandler High. As the head swim 
and dive coach, Coach Croswhite spent count-
less hours training and mentoring the athletes 
he worked with every day. Coach Croswhite 
always went out of his way to help others— 
even jumping into action without hesitation to 
save the life of one of his students after she 
suffered a seizure in the pool. Because of his 
leadership and example, countless students 
have learned the value of camaraderie, perse-
verance and teamwork. 
Conch Croswhite’s wife, Laurie, shared that 
at the time of his passing, he was listening to 
the song ‘‘These Are the Days’’ by Van Morri-
son. In celebration of his life and legacy, may 
we think of him each time we hear this song 
in the future. We join his family in grief and 
gratitude, thankful that we bore witness to the 
impact he had on the entire Chandler High 
community. His legacy will be remembered for 
generations of students, teachers, and faculty 
to come. 
Thank you to Coach Croswhite, and God-
speed. 
HONORING RACHAEL HAALAND AS 
IOWAN OF THE WEEK 
HON. CYNTHIA AXNE 
OF IOWA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Saturday, August 22, 2020 
Mrs. AXNE. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
ask the House of Representatives to join me 
in recognizing Ms. Rachael Haaland for her 
outstanding leadership and positivity as she 
serves families and children during this pan-
demic by naming her our Iowan of the Week. 
Rachael is an exceptional Childcare Site 
Manager at the ChildServe Childcare center in 
Johnston, Iowa. Her co-workers and col-
leagues shared that she is a fun-loving, cre-
ative, genuine, and encouraging person. She 
challenges her team every day to be their best 
and to embrace the many opportunities they 
have each day to make a positive difference 
for every child, every family, and especially to 
each other. 
With the children in her center, Rachael 
doesn’t just focus on the basic components of 
quality childcare. She goes above and beyond 
to support her teachers to provide memorable 
early learning experiences that set the stage 
for children’s future success in school and life. 
She promotes a positive work and care envi-
ronment; she encourages her staff to truly 
enjoy their jobs, and the children they care for 
to engage in activities together to promote 
learning, interpersonal connection, and fun. 
Rachael created an atmosphere where staff, 
children, and families thrive through shared re-
spect and regard for their uniqueness, but also 
their common goals and values. 
During 
this 
COVID–19 
crisis, 
Rachael 
knows that the families she serves, and her 
coworkers at ChildServe, are all feeling con-
cerned and stressed. Everyone is focused on 
making sure they are providing a safe environ-
ment where our children can still play and 
learn. She has maintained a steady level of 
communication with her community, and col-
laboration has been exceptional during a time 
that has been difficult for all. 
Rachael has ensured a safe work and care 
environment by adapting space, establishing 
new cleaning protocols, and making necessary 
changes throughout the center to minimize the 
risk to children and staff and follow CDC 
guidelines. During all of this, she still planned 
fun, theme-based activities to promote the joy 
of learning in these children and give them a 
break from the world outside. As a mom of 
two boys, I know the parents and families Ra-
chel works with are grateful for the extra 
cleaning, extra work, and extra thought Rachel 
is investing into ChildServe. 
It is my distinct honor to name Rachael 
Haaland as our Iowan of the Week and thank 
her for her commitment to early childcare and 
education. Although we do not know what the 
future holds, we know it is a bright future with 
educators and childcare providers like Rachael 
Haaland in our community. 
IN MEMORY OF DR. REBEKAH 
HORTON 
HON. CATHY McMORRIS RODGERS 
OF WASHINGTON 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Saturday, August 22, 2020 
Mrs. RODGERS of Washington. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to honor the memory of 
Dr. Rebekah ‘Beka’ Horton. She passed away 
on June 27, 2020. 
Beka co-founded Pensacola Christian Col-
lege with her husband. From day one, she led 
a Christ-centered mission for the spiritual and 
academic growth of every student. 
She led with humility and a clear vision for 
every person to reach their God-given poten-
tial. Her passion was to ensure young men 
and women received an excellent education 
and were prepared to be leaders in the world. 
During my years at Pensacola Christian Col-
lege, I played piano in a traveling ensemble. 
Beka served as our ensemble’s mentor. She 
always encouraged us to seek excellence and 
challenged us to the highest of standards. I 
cherish those memories, and I’m grateful for 
the lessons Beka instilled in me. To this day, 
I challenge my own team to seek excellence 
in everything we do. 
Beka’s legacy for excellence extends far be-
yond Pensacola Christian College’s campus. 
Through her many ministries like her children’s 
TV program and A Beka Books, she touched 
many lives and helped countless students of 
all ages flourish. She lived a full life in the 
service of God. 
My prayers for comfort and peace are with 
all those who are mourning her passing. May 
she rest in peace, and may we continue to 
honor her legacy by seeking excellence, put-
ting our trust in God, and serving others.

CELEBRATING INDIAN 
INDEPENDENCE 
HON. JOE WILSON 
OF SOUTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Saturday, August 22, 2020 
Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Madam 
Speaker, last Saturday, I was grateful to be 
Guest of Honor at the Consulate of the Re-
public of India in Atlanta for the Indian flag 
hoisting ceremony to observe the 74th Inde-
pendence Day of India. 
Consul General, Dr. Swati Kulkarni, con-
ducted the solemn occasion with profes-
sionalism joined by her dedicated staff along 
with KV Kumar, President of the Indian-Amer-
ican International Chamber of Commerce. 
With the leadership of Prime Minister 
Narendra Modi in the past year India has sur-
passed the United Kingdom and France in 
gross domestic product. Sadly, the Wuhan 
virus has disrupted these economic advances. 
India’s evolution from socialism to a free mar-
ket economy reducing poverty is a testament 
to the success of economic freedom. 
The alliance of India and America was un-
derscored last September 22nd in Houston 
when President Donald Trump welcomed 
Prime Minister Modi to America with an audi-
ence of 50,000 largely Indian-Americans being 
the largest welcome program in American his-
tory. Arm in arm, Prime Minister Modi and

RECOGNIZING THE HARD WORK OF 
THE 
STUDENTS 
OF 
HOLLAND 
MIDDLE SCHOOL 
HON. BRIAN K. FITZPATRICK 
OF PENNSYLVANIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Saturday, August 22, 2020 
Mr. FITZPATRICK. Madam Speaker, I in-
clude in the RECORD the following letter: 
Mr. JOSEPH FABRIZIO, 
Holland Middle School, 
Holland, Pennsylvania. 
DEAR MR. FABRIZIO
AND
THE 8TH GRADE 
CLASS OF HOLLAND MIDDLE SCHOOL, I appre-
ciate that you and your class took the time 
to reach out to me. One of the most impor-
tant things you can do as a citizen, other 
than vote, is communicate with your elected 
officials. By writing a letter, sending an 
email, or making a call, you ensure that I 
know what you are thinking and that I can 
better represent you. It may sound cheesy, 
but the decisions the government makes 
today will impact you, and eventually it will 
be your turn to make the decisions in gov-
ernment. My staff and I enjoyed reading the 
letters you sent about the national debt and 
the steps we can take in order to improve 
the situation. I think my colleagues in the 
House could very much benefit from being 
able to review them as well, so I will be put-
ting this letter into the Congressional 
Record. Once submitted, other Representa-
tives will know they can review what you 
have written. I wanted to make a few points 
regarding the national debt and the steps I 
have taken to address the issue. For too 
long, our government has ignored this issue 
and refused to address significant budgetary 
concerns. Two ways we can help address this 
issue is by balancing the budget and ensur-
ing that each year, Congress approves a 
budget. I have introduced legislation that fo-
cuses on both of these ideas. 
The first bill, H.J. Res 11, would amend the 
Constitution to require that federal govern-
ment spending does not exceed the amount 
of revenue that the federal government takes 
in. This is a requirement that many states, 
including Pennsylvania, already have. It 
makes sense that the federal government 
should as well. Families all across the coun-
try have to balance their household budget, 
the same standard should apply to our own 
government. 
The second bill, H.J. Res. 10, amends the 
Constitution to prevent Members of Congress 
from being paid if Congress fails to pass a 
budget. Eight hundred thousand federal em-
ployees and their families were forced to live 
without paychecks last time Congress failed 
to agree on a budget. No Member of Congress 
should accept pay during a shutdown either. 
This is an important step to restore the 
American people’s faith in Congress and hold 
public officials accountable. During the 2019 
government shutdown, I chose to lead by ex-
ample when I gave $10,008.68 of my paycheck 
back to the U.S. taxpayers. 
If you want to stay up to date on what I 
am doing to address the national debt, or 
any other issue, feel free to reach out to me. 
If you ever happen to be in our Nation’s cap-
ital, I invite you to stop by your office here 
in the House of Representatives to say hello, 
and I would be more than happy to offer you 
a tour of the Capitol. 
Sincerely, 
BRIAN FITZPATRICK

HON. XOCHITL TORRES SMALL 
OF NEW MEXICO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Saturday, August 22, 2020 
Ms. TORRES SMALL of New Mexico. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize my 
vote on July 24, 2020 in favor of H.R. 7608, 
the State-Foreign Operations, Agriculture, Inte-
rior-Environment, and Military Construction- 
Veterans Affairs agencies appropriations pack-
age for fiscal year 2021. 
Right now, it’s more important than ever that 
we work together to keep all of us, especially 
our veterans, safe and healthy. This bill pro-
vides relief to an outdated and overburdened 
VA system, invests in rural and water infra-
structure systems in need of repair and con-
tinues efforts to combat the global pandemic 
and spur economic recovery. 
As we fight to save American lives and re-
build our economy, reports indicate China may 
have exploited the pandemic for its own ad-
vantage. This is unacceptable, which is why I 
strongly support the Countering Chinese Influ-
ence Fund. While the motion to recommit pur-
ported to increase funding for the Countering 
Chinese Influence Fund, it actually defunded 
the Countering Chinese Influence Fund in a 
separate account. This type of politically moti-
vated procedure is only a distraction that pre-
vents us from moving forward real, bipartisan 
solutions that help hold China accountable. 
Moving forward, I will continue to support leg-
islative measures that hold China accountable 
for exploiting COVID–19, its combative trade 
policy, and malign initiatives that threaten our 
national security.

CONGRATULATING THE PIATT 
COUNTY MENTAL HEALTH CENTER 
HON. RODNEY DAVIS 
OF ILLINOIS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Saturday, August 22, 2020 
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Madam 
Speaker, I would like to congratulate the Piatt 
County Mental Health Center on celebrating 
50 years of excellent service to their commu-
nity. Formed in July of 1970 much has 
changed on their path to 2020, but their com-
mitment to the people they serve has not. 
The Center has excelled in their mission of 
assisting those in need to achieve recovery 
and self-sufficiency. They do so by helping cli-
ents identify, optimize, and utilize their own 
strengths and available resources. They do 
their work grounded in the principles of hope, 
personal responsibility, support, education and 
self-advocacy. 
For half a century, healthcare professionals 
at the Piatt County Mental Health Center have 
provided citizens with important services such 
as outpatient behavioral health services, ad-
diction counseling, prevention education in 
schools, and a myriad of support services for 
adults with intellectual or developmental dis-
abilities. They currently serve over 600 clients 
every year. 
Again, congratulations to the Piatt County 
Mental Health Center on their 50th anniver-
sary. I wish them and their clients successful 
outcomes in the years to come.

HONORING OFFICER O.G. 
HON. JOE WILSON 
OF SOUTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Saturday, August 22, 2020 
Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Madam 
Speaker, last week I was grateful to visit the 
famously friendly community of Pelion, South 
Carolina, where I met with Town of Pelion Po-
lice Officer Odell O.G. Glenn, a full time Police 
Officer/School 
Resource 
Officer/Children’s 
Book Author. 
I will always cherish his thoughtfulness to 
present me two autographed books: The Ad-
ventures of Officer O.G. School Cop and the 
Adventures of Officer O.G. School Cop: 
School Fire. The series of books are dedi-
cated to all the hard working School Resource 
Officers who protect children and staff. 
In an era of disrespect to law enforcement, 
Officer Odell ‘‘O.G.’’ Glenn is an extraordinary 
example of the vast majority of law enforce-
ment who are dedicated to protecting Amer-
ican families. 
The visit was enhanced by a warm welcome 
by Chief Mike Crider, Mayor Frank Shumpert, 
and enthusiastic educators with community 
leaders.

IN MEMORY OF DR. JOHN DENT 
MARSHALL, JR. 
HON. SANFORD D. BISHOP, JR. 
OF GEORGIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Saturday, August 22, 2020 
Mr. BISHOP of Georgia. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to honor a compassionate medical 
doctor, fiery civil rights activist, a tremendous 
man of faith, and great friend of longstanding, 
Dr. John Dent Marshall, Jr. Sadly, Dr. Marshall 
passed away on August 12, 2020, at the age 
of 74 after a long and courageous battle with 
COVID–19. His homegoing service will be 
held on Saturday, August 22, 2020, at the Hill-
crest Abbey West Cemetery at 1:00 p.m. in 
Savannah, Georgia. On Saturday, August 29, 
2020, a memorial service will be held at 1:00 
p.m. at the Restoration Church of Americus, 
Inc. in Americus, Georgia. His passing leaves 
a tremendous void in the lives of his family, 
friends, and the countless lives that he 
touched as a medical doctor and civil rights 
activist. 
Dr. John Dent Marshall, Jr. was born on 
June 13, 1946, in Savannah, Georgia, the eld-
est son of the late Lila S. and John D. Mar-
shall, Sr. He was educated in the Chatham 
County Public School system, where he grad-
uated from Alfred E. Beach High School with

honors in 1964. He continued his education at 
Savannah State College (now University), 
graduating with a B.S. degree in Biology in 
1968. 
He answered the solemn call to serve his 
nation during the Vietnam Conflict, proudly 
serving in the United States Air Force for four 
years where he was stationed at Fort Rucker, 
Alabama as a Weather Observer Specialist. 
Following his service in the Air Force, he 
engaged in further career and educational pur-
suits. He worked for Green Giant, Inc. in Chi-
cago, Illinois and for Pfizer Pharmaceuticals in 
Nashville, Tennessee. Dr. Marshall also grad-
uated from Meharry Medical College in 1982, 
fulfilling a lifelong dream of becoming a Med-
ical Doctor. 
He began his three-decade medical practice 
in Plains, Georgia. The highlight of his time 
there was having our 39th President, Jimmy 
Carter, as one of his patients. After leaving 
Plains he opened a practice in Leslie, Geor-
gia, but went on to make his greatest impact 
in Americus, Georgia, where he operated a 
Family Medical Practice for 24 years. 
Our late and beloved colleague, Congress-
man John Lewis, often said that ‘‘When you 
see something that is not right, not fair, not 
just, you have to speak up. You have to say 
something: you have to do something.’’ Dr. 
Marshall was a dedicated civil rights activist 
who did just that. 
He said what others were afraid to say. He 
fought battles that others were afraid to fight. 
He truly gave a voice to the voiceless and 
hope to the hopeless. Dr. Marshall was ac-
tively involved and served faithfully as the 
president of the Americus-Sumter branch of 
The NAACP for 14 years. He was also the 
owner and publisher of the Americus Sumter- 
Observer Newspaper, which he used as a 
platform to expand his civil rights advocacy by 
exposing injustice, holding those in power ac-
countable, and highlighting stories that may 
not otherwise have been told. 
Dr. Marshall loved his family and his pa-
tients. He was always pushing both groups to 
do the right thing for their physical, spiritual, 
and social well-being. He delighted in the suc-
cesses of all of those that he pushed to be 
better and reach their full potential. 
He was indeed a very spiritual man who 
loved God and was guided by God’s purpose 
for his life. He felt a calling to serve ‘‘the least 
of these’’ and gave his all in that service. 
On a personal note, Dr. Marshall was my 
friend and supporter. He always encouraged 
me, and I will miss his wise advice and sage 
counsel. He indeed spoke truth to power and 
always gave me the unvarnished truth. He 
never told me what I wanted to hear, but al-
ways told me what he felt I needed to hear. 
While we did not always agree, our mutual re-
spect and friendship created an unbreakable 
bond. Dr. Marshall did so much for so many 
for so long to improve the lives of the people 
he encountered. Truly, the world is a better 
place because Dr. Marshall passed this way. 
Madam Speaker, my wife, Vivian, and I, 
along with the more than 730,000 people of 
the Second Congressional District and count-
less others across the nation salute Dr. John 
Dent Marshall, Jr. for his outstanding service 
to his community and our nation. Moreover, I 
ask my colleagues in the House of Represent-
atives to join us in extending our deepest con-
dolences to Dr. Marshall’s family, friends, 
loved ones, and all of those who mourn his 
loss. We pray that they will be consoled and 
comforted by an abiding faith and the Holy 
Spirit in the days, weeks, and months ahead.

HONORING LUKE HARTZ AS IOWAN 
OF THE WEEK 
HON. CYNTHIA AXNE 
OF IOWA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Saturday, August 22, 2020 
Mrs. AXNE. Madam Speaker, I ask the 
House of Representatives to join me in hon-
oring an Iowan who has taken up the call to 
respond to the devastation brought by the de-
recho that hit Iowa and the Midwest last week. 
Hundreds of thousands of Iowans were left 
without power as the storm brought sustained 
winds of over 100 mph in many areas of our 
state, downing trees and crop fields, knocking 
down power lines, and damaging buildings 
and the electrical supply capacity across Iowa. 
I ask you to join me in honoring Luke Hartz, 
a senior journeyman lineman, who is one of 
the many individuals working around the clock 
to restore power and a sense of normalcy to 
affected Iowa families. 
The shockwaves of not having power during 
a global pandemic cannot be overstated. Em-
ployees were left without a way to work from 
home, students could not complete distance 
learning, businesses had to close their doors, 
and fridges and freezers had to be emptied of 
food that went bad. Families that sustained 
significant damage to their homes had to find 
shelter in hotels, motels, and with friends or 
family members that still had power. It was a 
gut punch Iowans didn’t need after everything 
we’ve been through this year. 
Luke and his fellow linemen across the 
State of Iowa have been working extra shifts 
and additional hours, leaving their families for 
days on end to help address the needs of oth-
ers. Luke was in Long Island, New York ear-
lier this month to help with the response effort 
to tropical storm Isaias. After helping New 
Yorkers, he came straight back to Iowa to as-
sist in response to the derecho. He has con-
sistently been working 14+ hour days for the 
past three weeks to help restore power to the 
hundreds of thousands of individuals impacted 
by these natural disasters, and he’s one of 
many doing that work. Linemen from around 
the Midwest have come to Iowa’s aid, and to 
them we are forever grateful. 
One thing Luke regularly tells the members 
of his crew is, ‘‘I need you every day, not just 
today’’. The scope of the damage is still being 
tabulated and these individuals are going to 
be pulling double and even triple shifts to 
serve their communities and state in this trying 
time. The repair work they’re undertaking 
would normally take months. Instead, they’re 
working to get us back on track within weeks. 
Madam Speaker, Iowans take care of each 
other. When we see someone in need, we 
step up to make them whole. Luke is helping 
hundreds of thousands of our families and 
neighbors reconnect and rebuild. We are 
grateful to have hardworking Iowans like Luke 
and linemen around this state to get us up 
and running once again. Iowa has had more 
than our fair share of difficulties over the last 
18 months, and now a storm that had rain and 
winds similar to a hurricane. But no matter 
what disaster has come our way, people like 
Luke have showed up to help us get through 
it. I couldn’t be prouder of him and his fellow 
linemen for their selfless and tireless work. 
It is my honor to ask the House to join me 
in recognizing senior journeyman lineman 
Luke Hartz as our Iowan of the Week.

BUS TOUR 2020 
HON. JOE WILSON 
OF SOUTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Saturday, August 22, 2020 
Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Madam 
Speaker, each August I am grateful with my 
wife Roxanne to participate in a bus tour of 
the district with dedicated staff to meet with 
constituents in the five counties I represent. 
This year was significantly virtual to respect 
health concerns of the pandemic. Initiatives on 
facing the Wuhan virus were presented by 
Chancellor Sandra Jordan of USC-Aiken, 
Aiken United Way President Sharon Rodgers, 
Veterans Administration Director Dr. Robin 
Jackson, Irmo Chamber President Kerry Pow-
ers, ZVerse Founder John Carrington, Farm 
Bureau President Harry Ott with Fred West of 
Amick Farms, USC President Bob Caslen, 
MEP President Chuck Spangler, and Medical 
School Dean Dr. Les Hall with Doctors 
Caughman Taylor and Stephen Shelton. 
In Barnwell we met with Master Sergeant JJ 
Cruz who founded Bronze Star, LLC, to 
produce hand sanitizer. Sergeant Cruz is also 
Potentate of the historic Omar Shrine Temple 
of Charleston and Mount Pleasant. 
Concluding the tour were live and taped 
interviews with Keven Cohen of The Point 
Broadcasting in addition to Gary David and 
Christopher Thompson of WVOC Radio, and 
Kelly Nash and Jonathan Rush of the Jona-
than & Kelly Show. 
The tour is always humbling and inspiring 
for me to visit constituents I represent. 
In conclusion, our thoughts and prayers for 
a speedy recovery for the courageous Alexi 
Navalny, in Berlin, who has been a champion 
of Democracy for the extraordinary people of 
the Russian Federation. Putin has been merci-
less in his oppression of the Russian people 
denying them basic freedoms and opportuni-
ties for success.
