nication from the Speaker: 
WASHINGTON, DC,

NANCY PELOSI, 
Speaker of the House of Representatives.

f 
UPHOLD DIGNITY OF WORK 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Pennsylvania (Mr. JOYCE) for 5 min-
utes. 
Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania. Mr. 
Speaker, right now, our Nation is fac-
ing a growing workforce crisis. 
For anyone who is paying attention, 
the most recent jobs report was incred-
ibly disappointing, but it wasn’t a sur-
prise. Nearly everywhere I go across 
my district in Pennsylvania, I see 
‘‘help wanted’’ signs. 
Every day, I hear from small busi-
nesses that are struggling to hire and 
struggling to keep staff. Despite the 
progress that we are making in our 
fight 
against 
the 
COVID–19 
virus, 
Democrats are continuing their Big 
Government, 
socialist 
plans. 
This 
alarming workforce trend is rooted in 
the Democrat’s scheme to keep paying 
people to stay at home, and it must 
end now. 
Thanks to American innovation and 
the success of Operation Warp Speed, 
our Nation is winning the fight against 
the COVID–19 pandemic. Safe vaccines 
are the key to restoring our personal 
liberties, eradicating this virus, get-
ting our kids back to school full time, 
and, yes, getting the American people 
back to work. 
Just like every previous challenge in 
our history, I know that our Nation 
has the potential to recover from this 
pandemic and to recover stronger than 
ever before. This truly is the American 
way. 
To succeed, we cannot allow Presi-
dent Biden and the Democrats to sabo-
tage our forward momentum. From day 
one in office, the President has prom-
ised Big Government interference that 
comes with higher taxes and more reg-
ulation for American businesses. 
Now, in the name of so-called infra-
structure reforms, the Biden adminis-
tration is flaunting job-killing plans 
that would crush America’s and Penn-
sylvania’s robust manufacturing and 
energy industries. 
Mr. Speaker, job-killing schemes and 
higher taxes are not the answer to the 
problem that lies in front of us. The 
dignity of work is a core tenet of our 
national fabric. This belief has moti-
vated the generations of courageous 
Americans who built and forged our 
Nation. 
Now it is once again time to get 
America safely back to work. Along-
side President Trump, I worked hard to 
advance a pro-growth agenda to sup-
port the workforce and create Amer-
ican jobs for American workers. We 
need to return to these solutions today 
to secure our success for tomorrow. 
American workers are the key to our 
recovery. They are truly essential. For 
centuries, hard work has been the key 
to uplifting families and achieving the 
American Dream. We cannot allow this 
longstanding tradition to be lost. 
For the sake of our workforce and for 
our communities, we must uphold the 
dignity of work. We must support the 
workforce, and we must get our Nation 
back on the road to recovery. 
f 
RECOGNIZING NORWEGIAN 
INDEPENDENCE DAY 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
California (Mrs. KIM) for 5 minutes. 
Mrs. KIM of California. Mr. Speaker, 
I rise today to recognize Norwegian 
Constitution Day. On May 17, 1814, Nor-
way’s 
Constitution 
was 
officially 
signed, declaring Norway as an inde-
pendent country. 
Mr. Speaker, 207 years later, we re-
member this important history and 
join Norwegians around the globe in 
celebrating its independence. 
I would like to extend our apprecia-
tion to the Norwegian-American com-
munity for all the tremendous con-
tributions they make to make America 
great. 
I would also like to recognize my 
amazing scheduler, Kristine Nichols. 
She is a proud Norwegian-American 
who recently obtained her U.S. citizen-
ship. I want Kristine to know that I ap-
preciate all that she does to keep my 
office running smoothly and, most im-
portantly, to keep me sane every day. 
f 
RECESS 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to clause 12(a) of rule I, the Chair 
declares the House in recess until 2 
p.m. today. 
Accordingly (at 12 o’clock and 5 min-
utes p.m.), the House stood in recess.

PRAYER 
The Chaplain, the Reverend Margaret 
Grun Kibben, offered the following 
prayer: 
God, 
You 
are 
our 
savior, 
our 
strength, and our song. 
Lord, even as we reflect on these 
words of the Psalmist, call to our 
minds how often throughout history, 
and in our own lives, You have been 
our salvation. 
Help us to recall how You have inter-
vened time and again in the health and 
welfare of our loved ones as well as our 
own. 
May we recollect how often You have 
set Your shield before us in the pres-
ence of our enemies, in moments of de-
spair, and in the face of harm. 
Give us reason to remember the innu-
merable times You have protected us 
from our own foolish actions and pride-
ful behavior. 
Inspire us by these memories of Your 
saving acts, large and small, that we 
would allow them to shape our present. 
Save us, we pray. We beseech You, O 
Lord, grant that all that we say today 
would reflect our gratitude for the suc-
cess You have given us. May all that 
we do today be a prosperous celebra-
tion of Your redemptive love to us and 
to those around us. 
Salvation belongs to You, O Lord. 
May Your blessings remain upon Your 
people. It is in Your merciful name we 
pray. 
Amen.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to section 11(a) of House Resolu-

PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Will the 
gentleman from Illinois (Mr. BOST) 
come forward and lead the House in the 
Pledge of Allegiance. 
Mr. BOST led the Pledge of Alle-
giance as follows: 
I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the 
United States of America, and to the Repub-
lic for which it stands, one nation under God, 
indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.

ANNOUNCEMENT BY THE SPEAKER

MENTAL HEALTH AWARENESS 
MONTH 
(Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania 
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend his remarks.) 
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize 
May 
as 
Mental 
Health 
Awareness 
Month. The focus of this campaign is 
to break down the stigma surrounding 
mental health. 
Each year, millions of Americans 
face the reality of living with a mental 
illness. By breaking the stigma and 
talking about depression, anxiety, and 
other conditions, we can help those af-
fected to seek the quality care that 
they deserve. 
After spending the past year locked 
down and secluded from society, it is 
more important than ever to check in 
on your loved ones. If you are suffering 
or feel alone, please reach out for help. 
It is important to remember that you 
are not alone. 
Mr. Speaker, by bringing attention 
to mental health, we can elevate the 
conversations 
surrounding 
mental 
health. We are focusing on prioritizing 
mental health and acknowledging it is 
okay to not be okay. 
This month, reach out to your loved 
ones and check in. By starting the con-
versation, we are one step closer to 
ending the stigma surrounding mental 
health. 
f 
RECOGNIZING JAKE WEGNER 
(Mrs. MILLER-MEEKS asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and 
extend her remarks.) 
Mrs. MILLER-MEEKS. Mr. Speaker, 
I rise today to share an uplifting story 
about a young man from my congres-
sional district. 
Jake Wegner, a senior at Central Col-
lege in Pella, Iowa, took his first at bat 
after beating cancer twice. 
Jake’s first battle with cancer began 
when he was diagnosed with neuro-
blastoma before the start of his high 
school senior baseball season. 
After recovering from surgery, Jake 
enrolled at Central College, where he 
finished his first semester, but upon re-
turning home for a checkup, he learned 
that the cancer had relapsed. 
Jake kept his faith strong and family 
close while he endured chemotherapy 
for the next 15 months, and in January 
of 2018, he was ready to begin classes 
again. 
In yesterday’s game against Simpson 
College, after 3 years of being cancer- 
free, Jake took his first at bat for sen-
ior night. 
Jake, your story of following your 
dreams and overcoming adversity is an 
inspiration to all of us, and I couldn’t 
be prouder to represent you in Con-
gress. 
f 
ANNOUNCEMENT BY THE SPEAKER 
PRO TEMPORE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to clause 8 of rule XX, the Chair 
will 
postpone 
further 
proceedings 
today on motions to suspend the rules 
on which the yeas and nays are or-
dered. 
The House will resume proceedings 
on postponed questions at a later time.

IMPROVING VA ACCOUNTABILITY

spect to reporting sexual and other harass-
ment and employment discrimination com-
plaints pursuant to subsection (a)(2) of such

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from 
California (Mr. TAKANO) and the gen-
tleman from Illinois (Mr. BOST) each 
will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from California. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days in which to 
revise and extend their remarks and to 
insert extraneous material on H.R. 
2704. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from California? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, H.R. 2704, sponsored by 
Oversight 
and 
Investigations 
Sub-
committee Chair PAPPAS, takes impor-
tant steps to address sexual harass-
ment and discrimination at the VA. 
This bipartisan legislation, the Im-
proving VA Accountability to Prevent 
Sexual Harassment and Discrimination 
Act, would prioritize VA’s tracking and 
responses to allegations. 
For example, it requires VA’s Equal 
Employment Opportunity Director to 
report directly to the Deputy Sec-
retary. It also requires that any VA 
manager who receives a report of sex-
ual or other harassment, or employ-
ment discrimination, report that com-
plaint within 2 business days. 
Among other important actions, this 
bill will also mandate additional train-
ing to identify and address sexual, and 
other types of harassment, and employ-
ment discrimination. 
This legislation is based largely on 
the work of the Government Account-
ability Office, who testified in our com-
mittee during July of last year. 
I urge my colleagues to support the 
bill, and I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. BOST. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support 
of H.R. 2704, the Improving VA Ac-
countability to Prevent Sexual Harass-
ment and Discrimination Act of 2021. 
It is a terrible reality that, according 
to a recent study, roughly 26 percent of 
female employees and 14 percent of 
male employees at VA have reported 
experiencing sexual harassment over a 
2-year period. 
Sadly, an even higher percentage of 
employees reported some type of dis-
crimination, such as reprisal or racial 
discrimination. 
Though these problems are large, I 
applaud the work of the VA Office of 
Resolution Management, Diversity and 
Inclusion and what they do. They are 
taking these issues on headfirst, but 
there is still a long way to go. 
That is why I am proud to support 
H.R. 2704, which would eliminate the 
potential conflict of interest in VA’s 
chain of command; require stricter re-
porting of allegations of sexual harass-
ment and discrimination; and require 
VA to finalize and deploy the Harass-
ment Prevention Program, along with 
increasing training and reviews. 
I am grateful to Chairman CHRIS 
PAPPAS
and Congresswoman ASHLEY 
HINSON for introducing this bill and 
leading it. The bill has my full support. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 
minutes to the gentleman from New 
Hampshire (Mr. PAPPAS), my good 
friend, the chairman of the Sub-
committee on Oversight and Investiga-
tions, and also the author of this im-
portant piece of legislation. 
Mr. PAPPAS. Mr. Speaker, I want to 
begin by thanking Chairman TAKANO 
and Ranking Member BOST for their 
work in putting together this com-
prehensive group of bills today to sup-
port our veterans, including this bill, 
and I appreciate their support for it. 
I rise in support of this legislation, 
the Improving VA Accountability to 
Prevent Sexual Harassment and Dis-
crimination Act, a bill that I intro-
duced, 
along 
with 
Representative 
HINSON. 
This bipartisan, bicameral bill will 
take critical steps to combat sexual 
harassment by updating VA’s anti-
quated policies and structure, in addi-
tion to creating stronger reporting re-
quirements. 
We know that at least 1 in 4 women 
and 1 in 10 men who have served in the 
military are survivors of sexual as-
sault, harassment, or abuse. 
At the VA, we know that at least 1 in 
4 women veterans and 1 in 4 women em-
ployees experience sexual harassment 
in healthcare settings. 
It is simply unacceptable that some-
one who has proudly served our Nation 
is subjected to sexual harassment in 
the institution whose charge it is to 
serve them. 
It is long past time for us to make 
systemic change at the VA that will 
honor the service of our veterans and 
healthcare providers and keep people 
safe. 
This is commonsense legislation that 
came out of an Oversight and Inves-
tigation Subcommittee hearing that 
we held last July. We heard from the 
GAO and the VA on this issue. While 
important steps have been made by the 
VA in the recent past, this is impor-
tant legislation that is going to con-
tinue to improve this situation and 
make the kind of long-lasting change 
that is long overdue. 
I urge my colleagues to pass this 
commonsense bill. 
Mr. BOST. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 
minutes to the gentlewoman from Iowa 
(Mrs. HINSON), the cosponsor of the bill. 
Mrs. HINSON. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today in support of H.R. 2704, the Im-
proving VA Accountability to Prevent 
Sexual Harassment and Discrimination 
Act. 
I was proud to introduce this legisla-
tion 
alongside 
Congressman 
CHRIS 
PAPPAS and Senator MAGGIE HASSAN, 
as well as my fellow Iowan, Senator 
JONI ERNST, who is a combat veteran 
and sexual assault survivor herself. 
Last year, a Government Account-
ability Office report exposed disturbing 
failures at the U.S. Department of Vet-
erans Affairs to handle sexual harass-
ment and discrimination at the agency 
properly. The report also revealed that 
between 18 and 27 percent of VA em-
ployees experienced some form of sex-
ual harassment at work between 2014 
and 2016. 
This is completely unacceptable. 
This bipartisan, bicameral bill will 
improve the way sexual harassment is

handled at the VA and will crack down 
on instances of harassment and dis-
crimination within the Department. 
Nobody should feel unsafe at work. 
The care VA employees provide for our 
veterans is absolutely critical, but 
they cannot provide that best care, the 
care our veterans deserve, if they are 
suffering in a hostile work environ-
ment. 
Not only is this an accountability 
and workplace safety issue, it is a dis-
service to our veterans who rely on the 
VA for high-quality care, and a dis-
service to taxpayers who fund the De-
partment. 
We can do better, and this legislation 
will ensure that those who serve our 
veterans feel safe at work so they can 
do their jobs effectively. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my col-
leagues to support this important bi-
partisan legislation. 
Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I have no 
further speakers, I am prepared to 
close, and I reserve the balance of my

tleman from Illinois (Mr. BOST) each

The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from California. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days in which to 
revise and extend their remarks and to 
insert extraneous material on H.R. 
2788. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from California? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to support 
Representative LAMB’s bipartisan legis-
lation, the VA Equal Employment Op-
portunity 
Counselor 
Modernization 
Act, which is cosponsored by Rep-
resentative MANN. 
This bill would help the Department 
address diversity and equity issues 
within VA’s workforce. It removes a 
portion of a 1997 law that limits the 
number of VA counselors who can ad-
vise employees on equal employment 
opportunity 
issues, 
provides 
alter-
native dispute resolution, and helps 
process formal complaints. 
VA’s workforce has roughly doubled 
in size since the 1997 law was enacted, 
and VA requested for the limit to be re-
moved to allow the Department to hire 
additional counselors to support the 
needs of a large and still growing work-
force. 
Our 
Oversight 
and 
Investigations 
Subcommittee recently held a hearing 
to examine important steps to address 
workforce diversity and inclusion at 
VA. At this hearing, the subcommittee, 
once again, learned how important 
these counselors are. This bill builds 
off that oversight and will assist VA’s 
efforts to support its workforce, which 
serves veterans every single day. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge all my colleagues 
to join me in supporting this legisla-
tion, and I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. BOST. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support 
of H.R. 2788, the VA Equal Employment 
Opportunity Counselor Modernization 
Act. 
Current law prohibits VA from hav-
ing more than 40 full-time EEO coun-
selors. With a workforce of around 
400,000, that is only one counselor for 
every 10,000 employees. 
This arbitrary cap has hamstrung 
VA, and we have heard from the De-
partment and stakeholders that the 
lack of counselors prevents VA from 
addressing complaints quickly. H.R. 
2788 would remove this cap and finally 
allow VA to rightsize its need for EEO 
counselors. 
I thank Congressman CONOR LAMB 
and Ranking Member TRACEY MANN for 
introducing and leading this common-
sense legislation. I am pleased to sup-
port it this afternoon. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 
minutes to the gentleman from Penn-
sylvania (Mr. LAMB), my good friend 
and the author of this bipartisan legis-
lation, H.R. 2788; and a member of the 
House Committee on Veterans’ Affairs. 
Mr. LAMB. Mr. Speaker, I think the 
key term that Ranking Member BOST 
used was ‘‘common sense.’’ That can 
sometimes be in short supply around 
here. 
When we found out that the VA has 
roughly the same number of EEOC 
counselors today—38—that it had in 
1997, you ask yourself the simple ques-
tion: Well, what else has happened at 
the VA since that time? 
Their workforce has nearly doubled. 
Since 1997, the VA has become one of 
the largest Federal agencies, with a 
workforce of over 400,000 people, which 
means those same 38 EEOC counselors 
are 
handling 
roughly 
double 
the 
amount of complaints of unfair and il-
legal discrimination today that they 
were in 1997. 
See, the law placed an artificial cap 
on the number of counselors, but it did 
not place a cap on the amount of un-
just discrimination in our society. 
That has continued. If anything, the 
last year has shown us how deep and 
intransigent racial discrimination, sex 
discrimination, and other illegal forms 
of discrimination remain in our society 
and how we have to take active steps 
to dismantle them wherever we find 
them. 
Unfair and illegal discrimination ex-
ists at the VA. It doesn’t make me 
proud to say it as a veteran, as a law-
maker, as a public servant, but it ex-
ists there just like it exists everywhere 
else. These folks know how to deal 
with it. They know how to listen. They 
know how to make the employees feel 
like they have a safe place to go and 
tell their side of the story. They know 
how to stick up for these employees 
who are giving their careers to helping 
our veterans. 
All we need to do is lift the cap, and 
the VA will hire EEOC counselors who 
can do their job effectively and take 
care of those who are taking care of 
our veterans every day. 
Mr. BOST. Mr. Speaker, I encourage 
my colleagues to support this bill, and 
I yield back the balance of my time. 
Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I, again, 
urge all of my colleagues to join me in

ant to the rule, the gentleman from

tleman from Illinois (Mr. BOST) each

GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days in which to 
revise and extend their remarks and to 
insert extraneous material on H.R. 
2911. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from California? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to support 
Representative BOST’s bipartisan legis-
lation, the VA Transparency & Trust 
Act, for which Representative PAPPAS, 
Representative MANN, and I are origi-
nal cosponsors. 
This bill provides additional over-
sight for the funds Congress made 
available to the VA through the Fami-
lies First Coronavirus Response Act 
and the CARES Act in 2020, as well as 
the American Rescue Plan, which we 
passed earlier this year. 
In addition to requiring the VA to re-
port biweekly on how it spends these 
supplemental funds, the bill mandates 
the VA Office of Inspector General and 
the Government Accountability Office 
to periodically report on VA’s spending 
of these funds. 
Mr. Speaker, H.R. 2911 adds to the ex-
isting oversight on VA’s spending and 
will enable greater transparency for 
Congress and the public to ensure that 
these funds are spent efficiently and ef-
fectively to support critical VA pro-
grams and services as we recover from 
the COVID–19 pandemic. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
join me in supporting this legislation, 
and I reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. BOST. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support 
of H.R. 2911, the VA Transparency & 
Trust Act of 2021. 
In the American Rescue Plan, the VA 
requested and received $17.1 billion in 
emergency funding. I demanded jus-
tification from the VA to support that 
funding, and very little came. I asked 
why the VA needed additional money 
since roughly $10 billion in CARES Act 
funding was still available, and no one 
answered. 
Ranking Member TRACEY MANN of-
fered an amendment to oversee the use 
of those funds during the committee’s 
markup of the American Rescue Plan. 
It was voted down on party lines. 
What I feared at that time I can now 
confirm. The American Rescue Plan 
has essentially become a blank check 
for the VA to the tune of $17.1 billion. 
H.R. 2911 would establish strict over-
sight and reporting requirements over 
all 
remaining 
COVID 
supplemental 
funds. It would also require the VA in-
spector general to conduct regular au-
dits of these funds. 
Lastly, it would require the GAO to 
conduct a complete review after all 
funds have been spent. 
I believe these requirements are ap-
propriate given that we are talking 
about tens of billions in taxpayer dol-
lars. We should all expect full trans-
parency on the use of these funds. 
I thank Chairman PAPPAS and Rank-
ing Member MANN for joining me in in-
troducing this bill. I encourage all my 
colleagues to support this bill. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 
minutes to the gentleman from New 
Hampshire (Mr. PAPPAS), my good 
friend and the chairman of the Sub-
committee on Oversight and Investiga-
tions. 
Mr. PAPPAS. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
my colleague, Ranking Member BOST, 
for introducing this legislation. I was 
proud to support it alongside my col-
league, TRACEY MANN, from the Over-
sight 
and 
Investigations 
Sub-
committee. It is the VA Transparency 
& Trust Act of 2021. 
Now, the COVID–19 pandemic and 
economic crisis turned our world up-
side down, and it hit our veteran com-
munity especially hard. The issues our 
veterans faced before the pandemic

have only been exacerbated by COVID– 
19, and they contend with a new host of 
health and financial hardships. 
That is why I joined with many in 
this Chamber to strongly urge for sup-
port to our veterans in COVID–19 relief 
packages, including the American Res-
cue Plan. That plan provided a much- 
needed investment in the VA, but we 
must all work together to ensure that 
this funding is used effectively to sup-
port our veterans and to increase the 
quality care that they receive. 
As chair of the Oversight and Inves-
tigations Subcommittee, eliminating 
waste, fraud, and abuse, and ensuring 
veterans get the care they have earned 
is a top priority. 
This legislation would require the VA 
to report to Congress on the emergency 
funding that it has already received. It 
will provide the enhanced oversight 
that is warranted to ensure funds are 
being used efficiently and in ways that 
are truly meeting the needs of those 
who have served us all. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge swift passage of 
this legislation. 
Mr. BOST. Mr. Speaker, I encourage 
all of my colleagues to support this 
bill, and I yield back the balance of my 
time.

States Code, to direct the Secretary of 
Labor to prioritize the provision of

GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days in which to 
revise and extend their remarks and to 
insert extraneous material on H.R. 240. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from California? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to speak 
on H.R. 240, the Homeless Veterans 
with Children Reintegration Act intro-
duced 
by 
Congresswoman 
JULIA 
BROWNLEY. 
There is increasing concern that 
shelters and homeless veteran housing 
is not created to serve families, and 
that homeless veterans with children 
may avoid seeking out services because 
they are afraid of being separated from 
their children. 
Representative BROWNLEY’s legisla-
tion seeks to start addressing the issue 
by ensuring that veterans with families 
are prioritized within the homeless vet-
erans reintegration program, or HVRP. 
HVRP seeks to address reintegrating 
homeless veterans into the workforce 
through grants to partner organiza-
tions. 
Mr. Speaker, in 2018, the Department 
of Labor identified homeless female 
veterans and veterans with families as 
one of the three priority populations 
for HVRP services. H.R. 240 would 
prioritize homeless veterans with de-
pendent children within the homeless 
veteran reintegration program to en-
sure they get the resources they need 
to return to housing without the fear 
of losing their children should they 
seek help. 
I applaud Representative BROWNLEY 
for her work on this legislation, and I 
ask my colleagues to join me in sup-
porting the Homeless Veterans with 
Children Reintegration Act. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. BOST. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 
240, the Homeless Veterans with Chil-
dren Reintegration Act. 
This legislation would direct the Sec-
retary of Labor to prioritize homeless 
veterans with dependents when admin-
istering homeless reintegration pro-
grams. 
The Department of Housing and 
Urban Development recently released 
2020’s Point-in-Time count for home-
less veterans. This count showed that 
on a single night in 2020, there were 
37,252 veterans living on the street. 
This is a slight increase of 0.4 percent 
from 2019. 
With COVID–19 impacting the econ-
omy and increasing unemployment, we 
must do everything we can to help our 
homeless veterans find work. 
By passing this bill to prioritize job 
training for homeless veterans with de-
pendents, we are ensuring this vulner-
able population is at the front of the 
line for help. 
I thank Congresswoman BROWNLEY 
for her hard work on drafting this bill, 
and I am proud to support it today. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 
minutes to the gentlewoman from Cali-
fornia (Ms. BROWNLEY), my good friend, 
the chairwoman of the Subcommittee 
on Health, and also the author of this 
important piece of legislation. 
Ms. BROWNLEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today in support of my bill, the Home-
less Veterans with Children Reintegra-
tion Act. 
On any given day, there are more 
than 550,000 people experiencing home-
lessness in our country. An estimated 
40,000 of them are veterans. This is cat-
egorically unacceptable. 
Although the Department of Housing 
and Urban Development and VA have 
made progress toward eliminating vet-
erans’ homelessness, there is still more 
that must be done to ensure that every 
veteran has a home. 
We know it is 10 times cheaper to 
provide resources to prevent homeless-
ness in the first place than it is to 
house someone once they have become 
homeless. 
We also know that so many of our 
veterans suffer from PTSD related to 
combat or, far too often, military sex-
ual trauma. These traumatic experi-
ences put veterans at increased risk of 
mental health conditions, substance 
use disorders, and homelessness.

H2365 
May 17, 2021 
We owe it to our veterans to spare no 
effort in providing the security and as-
sistance they need to transition to ci-
vilian life. One way to help our vet-
erans experiencing homelessness is to 
help them gain new employment skills 
and get stable jobs. 
The Department of Labor’s homeless 
veterans reintegration program focuses 
on securing employment opportunities 
for homeless veterans. The program 
provides grants to State and local 
agencies and nonprofit organizations 
that 
teach 
veterans 
occupational 
skills, provide on-the-job training, help 
them attain apprenticeships, and help 
with job searches and placement. 
Grantees also collaborate with public 
and private partners at all levels—Fed-
eral, State, and local—to provide sup-
portive services and access to housing. 
The program has been extremely suc-
cessful, helping place thousands of 
homeless veterans in competitive em-
ployment every year. 
Over the last several years, the De-
partment of Labor has identified cer-
tain homeless veteran populations that 
are in particular need of reintegration 
services, including female veterans and 
veterans with families. My bill would 
direct the Department of Labor to 
prioritize homeless veterans with de-
pendent children participating in its 
reintegration program. 
This subpopulation of homeless vet-
erans is particularly vulnerable, and it 
is so important to ensure they have ac-
cess to the wraparound services nec-
essary to support a parent with chil-
dren. 
Research shows that families experi-
encing homelessness often have to con-
tend with intimate partner violence, 
child separation, and other extremely 
challenging issues. That is why my bill 
would also require the Department of 
Labor to study access to shelter, safe-
ty, and other relevant services for 
homeless veterans with dependent chil-
dren. This information will help us un-
derstand the problem and identify op-
portunities to resolve issues in pro-
viding services to this vulnerable popu-
lation. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentlewoman has expired. 
Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
the gentlewoman an additional 2 min-
utes. 
Ms. BROWNLEY. Mr. Speaker, this 
legislation will also go a long way to-
ward supporting veterans who have 
sacrificed so much for our country and 
are now struggling to adjust to civilian 
life and to support families. 
This bill has received broad bipar-
tisan support in the past, and I ask 
that my colleagues, as my colleagues 
have on the committee, join me in get-
ting it across the finish line. We owe 
our veterans nothing less. 
Mr. BOST. Mr. Speaker, I encourage 
my colleagues to support this bill, and 
I yield back the balance of my time. 
Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I ask all 
of my colleagues to join me in passing 
H.R. 240 as we did unanimously in com-
mittee. I suspect that if this bill were 
brought to a vote before the entire 
body, it would pass with near-unani-
mous support. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time.

question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from California (Mr. 
TAKANO) that the House suspend the

MODIFICATION

ENHANCED 
USE 
LEASES AT THE DEPARTMENT OF 
VETERANS AFFAIRS WEST LOS AN-

Paragraph (1) of section 2(b) of the West

at the end the following new sentence: ‘‘Not-

SEC. 4. DETERMINATION OF BUDGETARY EF-

The budgetary effects of this Act, for the 
purpose of complying with the Statutory 
Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010, shall be deter-
mined by reference to the latest statement 
titled ‘‘Budgetary Effects of PAYGO Legisla-
tion’’ for this Act, submitted for printing in 
the Congressional Record by the Chairman of 
the House Budget Committee, provided that 
such statement has been submitted prior to 
the vote on passage. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from 
California (Mr. TAKANO) and the gen-
tleman from Illinois (Mr. BOST) each 
will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from California. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days in which to 
revise and extend their remarks and to 
insert extraneous material on H.R. 711, 
as amended. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from California? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, this bill, the West Los 
Angeles VA Campus Improvement Act, 
would amend a 2016 law concerning the 
West Los Angeles VA campus. 
H.R. 711, as amended, is sponsored by 
Congressman TED LIEU, and is critical 
to the Department of Veterans Affairs’ 
efforts, together with community part-
ners, to address veteran homelessness 
in the Los Angeles area. 
In addition, this legislation helps VA 
use already available funding streams 
to fund supportive housing for home-
less and at-risk veterans and their fam-
ilies; community operations that sup-
port emergency shelter and supportive 
housing; and renovations and minor 
construction projects. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my col-
leagues to support this legislation, and 
I reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. BOST. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 
711, as amended, the West Los Angeles 
VA Campus Improvement Act. 
In 2016, Congress gave the West Los 
Angeles VA campus the authority to 
carry out leases with third parties. 
These leases have the potential to cre-
ate revenue for the VA. However, the 
funds generated by these leases could 
only be used for renovation and main-
tenance. This bill would change that.

It would require that any land use 
revenues received by the VA from a 
third party be credited to the medical 
facility’s account. The funding in these 
accounts would be used to meet exist-
ing needs and new services for home-
less veterans. 
Revenues would now be available for 
the medical center to provide emer-
gency shelter and supportive housing 
services for homeless or at-risk vet-
erans and their families. These funds 
would be available without fiscal year 
limitations and further appropriations. 
It makes sense that the medical cen-
ter receives these funds and can use 
them to improve its campus and help 
homeless veterans. 
I thank Congresswoman BROWNLEY 
for her amendment at the markup 
which eliminated the mandatory score 
for this bill. 
Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to support 
H.R. 711, as amended. I thank the gen-
tleman and his staff for the hard work 
they have done on this bill to get it 
right. I appreciate it very much. 
Mr. Speaker, I encourage my col-
leagues to support this bill, and I yield 
back the balance of my time. 
Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I also 
want to express my gratitude to my 
colleague, Ranking Member BOST, and 
the Republicans on the committee for 
working with the majority. I believe 
that the issues that we worked out 
were common sense, and upon further 
examination, I think taxpayers and 
most independent, reasonable observers 
would say this is what Congress should 
be doing on behalf of our veterans. I 
can’t imagine why there would be any 
objection to this on the floor of the 
House. 
Mr. Speaker, I ask all of my col-
leagues to join me in supporting H.R. 
711, as amended, and I yield back the 
balance of my time. 
Mr. LIEU. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in sup-
port of my bill H.R. 711, the West Los Angeles 
VA Campus Improvement Act of 2021. This 
legislation is critical to the Department of Vet-
erans Affairs (VA) efforts, together with com-
munity partners, to address veteran homeless-
ness in the Los Angeles area. In addition, it 
helps VA use already available funding 
streams for certain homeless veteran pro-
grams, thus reducing the need for taxpayer 
funds. 
I represent the West LA VA, a 388-acre 
campus that serves thousands of veterans in 
Southern California and across the state, in-
cluding offering temporary housing for home-
less veterans, legal aide, training, and other 
services. The land was deeded to the federal 
government in 1888 and for decades thou-
sands of veterans lived there. Unfortunately, 
following damage from a major earthquake in 
1971, the VA began transitioning the land 
away from housing, costing Los Angeles 
County a crucial node in the battle to fight vet-
eran homelessness. On top of that, fraud and 
general neglect of the campus before my ten-
ure led to some of the campus falling into a 
state of disrepair. Finally, the VA settled in a 
suit alleging that many enhanced use leases 
on campus were not principally benefiting vet-
erans, but instead serving other purposes. 
Mr. Speaker, a year after I took office, Con-
gress passed my West Los Angeles Leasing 
Act of 2016, a law intended to clean up the 
campus and which directly led to the end of 
most non-veteran related leases. The law has 
also helped spur the redevelopment of the 
property into a true home for veterans. The 
VA is now implementing a plan to build at 
least 1,200 new subsidized apartments, which 
is composed of 23 projects that range from 
renovating existing structures to developing 
and building new units. 
This progress is encouraging. But there is a 
serious problem that was brought to my atten-
tion recently by veteran advocates. A drafting 
error in the 2016 legislation prevents the West 
LA VA from using funds from enhanced use 
leases (EULs) for the purposes of housing 
construction. The VA can only use such funds 
for ‘‘renovation and maintenance’’ of the cam-
pus which means money is lying stagnant that 
could be used to build housing but instead, 
because of a technical error, cannot go toward 
helping the VA fight homelessness. This legis-
lation fixes that error. 
Second, as a result of fraud on campus, the 
VA was supposed to get several million dollars 
in asset forfeiture funds. But instead, such 
funds go back to the general fund at the 
Treasury Department to be dispersed around 
the country, for any purpose at all. Veterans at 
the West LA VA are doubly harmed—first, by 
the initial fraud, and second, by the theft of 
funds that are supposed to make them whole. 
My legislation fixes this problem by making it 
clear funds from settlement money and asset 
forfeiture resulting from any past or future 
fraud on campus go to veterans at the facility 
that was harmed. It’s just common sense. 
Finally, my bill increases the life of en-
hanced use leases on the campus from 75 to 
99 years. Increasing the length of the leases 
would reduce the financing costs for new 
housing, further helping the VA and its part-
ners tackle homelessness. 
Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my colleagues 
on the House Veterans Affairs Committee for 
their support, including Chairman TAKANO, 
who has been a tireless champion for our na-
tion’s veterans and specifically veterans in Los 
Angeles. I am grateful to Members on both 
sides of the aisle who passed this bill out of 
Committee on May 4th by voice vote, bringing 
us one step closer to ensuring the VA has the 
legal authorities it needs help our veterans. 
Let’s not let technical errors stand in the way 
of housing our nation’s heroes. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from California (Mr. 
TAKANO) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 711, as 
amended. 
The question was taken. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the 
opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being 
in the affirmative, the ayes have it. 
Mr. ROSENDALE. Mr. Speaker, on

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to section 3(s) of House Resolution

for each of fiscal years 2021 through 2025. 
SEC. 8. DETERMINATION OF BUDGETARY EF-
FECTS. 
The budgetary effects of this Act, for the 
purpose of complying with the Statutory 
Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010, shall be deter-
mined by reference to the latest statement 
titled ‘‘Budgetary Effects of PAYGO Legisla-
tion’’ for this Act, submitted for printing in 
the Congressional Record by the Chairman of 
the House Budget Committee, provided that 
such statement has been submitted prior to 
the vote on passage. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from 
California (Mr. TAKANO) and the gen-
tleman from Illinois (Mr. BOST) each 
will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from California. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days in which to 
revise and extend their remarks and to 
insert extraneous material on H.R. 
2167, as amended. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from California? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to speak 
on H.R. 2167, as amended, the GI Bill 
National Emergency Extended Dead-
line, or GI Bill NEED Act, introduced 
by Congresswoman SHERRILL. 
The COVID–19 pandemic didn’t only 
impact veterans’ health, but it also put 
a serious strain on veterans’ access to 
educational benefits. The COVID–19 
pandemic exposed the limit on VA au-
thority to extend the time for use of its 
educational assistance program bene-
fits amid an emergency. 
Representative SHERRILL’s bill fixes 
these limits during times of emergency 
for Montgomery GI bill users and those 
participating in the Veteran Readiness 
and Employment Program. 
Mr. Speaker, this bill authorizes VA 
to pause the clock as needed when an 
institution must close temporarily, or 
permanently, due to an emergency, or 
when a student is prevented from con-
tinuing his or her program for other 
reasons. This was an authority VA 
lacked during COVID–19, and if not for 
the quick action by Congress, thou-
sands of veterans would have seen their 
benefits wasted. 
Now it is time to take the lessons 
from the pandemic and fix this problem 
once and for all. Not only that, but 
H.R. 2167, as amended, includes addi-
tional improvements to VA education 
programs used by veterans and their 
families. This legislation would require 
that VA ensure the modern informa-
tion technology (IT) service can proc-
ess claims faster and more efficiently 
through improved processing integra-
tion and accuracy, data exchange and 
reporting, customer integration, and 
simplification of the online experience. 
The legislation would also expand in- 
State tuition rates at public univer-
sities to participants in the Depend-
ents’ Educational Assistance program. 
Guaranteeing in-State tuition for 
those survivors using Dependents Edu-
cation Assistance, otherwise known as 
DEA, under Chapter 35, is a low-cost 
lift that will drastically improve edu-
cational options for surviving families 
and reduce their need for student 
loans. 
I, therefore, ask my colleagues to 
join me in supporting the GI Bill Na-
tional Emergency Extended Deadline, 
or GI Bill NEED Act. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. BOST. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 
2167, as amended, the GI Bill National 
Emergency 
Extended 
Deadlines—or 
NEED—Act. 
This bill would extend time limita-
tions for the use of entitlement for VA 
education programs due to an emer-
gency. I am supportive of the under-
lying bill. I also thank Chairman 
TAKANO, Congresswoman SHERRILL, for 
including several Republican provi-
sions in this legislation. 
This bill includes the text of two of 
Congressman MOORE’s bill, H.R. 2420, 
the Overseeing the GI Bill Act of 2021; 
and 
H.R. 
2457, 
the 
Colonel 
John 
McHugh Tuition Fairness for Survivors 
Act. 
H.R. 2420 would require VA to submit 
regular reports to Congress on the 
progress of the Digital GI Bill program. 
This is a system that the VA is pur-
chasing to overhaul the antiquated sys-
tem that processes GI bill claims. The 
failed implementation of the Forever 
GI Bill in 2018 led to thousands of vet-
erans waiting weeks for their claims to 
be processed. This provision would pro-
vide the needed oversight to ensure 
that these mistakes are not repeated. 
H.R. 2457 would require institutions 
of higher learning to provide an in- 
State tuition to participants in the 
Survivors’ and Dependents’ Education 
Assistance Program. This would bring 
the benefits in line with other GI Bill 
programs that require that veterans be 
provided in-State tuition. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank Congressman 
MOORE for his hard work on both of 
these bills. H.R. 2167, as amended, also 
includes texts from Congresswoman 
MACE’s bill, H.R. 2327. Congresswoman 
MACE’s provisions would ensure that 
benefits through the Dependents’ Edu-
cation Assistance GI Bill program will 
never expire for eligible students. This 
would bring this program in line with 
the way the post-9/11 GI bill benefits 
work for most other veterans. I com-
mend Congresswoman MACE
for her 
hard work on this bill to expand bene-
fits to dependents and survivors. 
Finally, this bill also includes the 
text of Congressman CAWTHORN’s bill, 
H.R. 2391, the Veterans Fellowship Act. 
This bill would direct the Department 
of Labor to carry out a pilot program 
to help veterans find meaningful em-
ployment through short-term fellow-
ships. The DOL would provide a stipend 
for the veterans to participate in the 
pilot program. 
Madam Speaker, I thank all of these 
Members for their hard work drafting 
these important pieces of legislation. I 
am pleased to support the bill, and I 
urge all of my colleagues to do the 
same. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. TAKANO. Madam Speaker, I 
have no further speakers, and I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. BOST. Madam Speaker, I yield 
11⁄2 minutes to the gentleman from Ala-
bama (Mr. MOORE). 
Mr. MOORE of Alabama. Madam 
Speaker, today I rise and I am proud 
that two of my bills, the Colonel John 
McHugh Tuition Fairness for Survivors 
Act, and the Overseeing the GI Act of 
2021, were included in the GI bill. 
Members of our military and their 
families have sacrificed so much in 
their service to our country. As a 
grateful Nation, we have a responsi-
bility to take care of our heroes and 
their families. My bill, the Colonel 
John McHugh Tuition Fairness for Sur-
vivors Act, secures in-State tuition 
benefits for the survivors and depend-
ents for eligible veterans under the De-
pendent Educational Assistance pro-
gram. 
This bill is named after the U.S. 
Army Colonel John McHugh, who was 
tragically killed in 2010 in Afghanistan 
by a roadside bomb. His family cur-
rently resides in my district. Like 
many 
Americans, 
Colonel 
McHugh 
dreamed of building a bigger and better 
life for his family, and we owe it to 
them, and the millions of families like 
the McHughs, to help them realize this 
dream. 
The second bill, the Overseeing the 
GI Bill Act of 2021, provides much-need-
ed oversight for the VA’s digital GI Bill 
project by requiring the VA to submit 
a series of base-level reports to ensure 
the VA is on track. 
These reports will provide Congress 
with the critical information needed to 
perform proper oversight over these IT 
upgrades and ensure that they are 
using taxpayer dollars efficiently and 
effectively. These bipartisan develop-
ments bring us closer to securing long 
overdue support for our veterans and 
their families, and I appreciate my col-
leagues on both sides of the aisle for 
lending their support to take care of 
our veterans and their families. 
Madam Speaker, I appreciate and 
thank Chairman TAKANO and Ranking 
Member BOST for their leadership. 
Mr. TAKANO. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. BOST. Madam Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentlewoman from Iowa 
(Mrs. MILLER-MEEKS).

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H2369 
May 17, 2021 
Mrs. 
MILLER-MEEKS. 
Madam 
Speaker, I thank my colleagues, Rank-
ing Member BOST and Chair TAKANO, 
for their leadership, and I thank Rep-
resentative BOST for yielding me time. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
speak in support of my bipartisan GI 
Bill 
National 
Emergency 
Extended 
Deadline Act, which I was proud to in-
troduce with a fellow veteran, Con-
gresswoman SHERRILL. 
Our legislation would protect vet-
erans’ educational benefits from expir-
ing due to institutional closures or 
other factors caused by the COVID–19 
national emergency. 
This important legislation will allow 
the Department of Veterans Affairs to 
pause the time limit currently placed 
on the use of GI bill benefits and to 
permit them to restart the clock after 
it is safe for veterans to return to 
school. 
I am pleased to see that our legisla-
tion was amended in the Committee on 
Veterans’ Affairs, to include my Vet-
erans Readiness and Employment Na-
tional Emergency Extended Deadline 
Act, which I was also proud to intro-
duce with Congresswoman SHERRILL. 
The VR&E NEED Act would ensure 
disabled veterans get the support they 
need to enter the civilian workforce 
through the VA’s VR&E program. Our 
legislation will allow the Secretary of 
Veterans Affairs to pause the 12-year 
time limit to use VR&E benefits during 
national emergencies and other crises 
when eligible, disabled veterans are 
prevented from leveraging those bene-
fits through no fault of their own. 
The VR&E program is an excellent 
path for our veterans to receive the 
education and training they need to re-
enter the workforce. By pausing the 
timer on their benefits when programs 
are closed, we preserve the opportuni-
ties veterans have earned through their 
service to our country. Our disabled 
veterans sacrificed greatly in service 
to our country, so now it is our turn to 
serve them. 
It is critical these benefits are not re-
duced due to no fault of the individual 
veteran. Over the past year, we have 
seen the COVID–19 public health emer-
gency force universities and colleges 
across the country to temporarily close 
their doors. As a 24-year Army veteran, 
I know how important being able to 
use GI benefits is to ensure that our 
veterans can find meaningful employ-
ment. In fact, I used the GI bill benefit 
throughout medical school. 
Madam Speaker, I thank Congress-
woman SHERRILL for her partnership 
on both of these commonsense bills to 
help our veterans to access the benefits 
they have earned. 
Madam Speaker, I urge all my col-
leagues to support the bipartisan GI 
NEED Act. 
Mr. TAKANO. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. BOST. Mr. Speaker, I am pre-
pared to close, and I yield myself such 
time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I encourage my col-
leagues to support this bill, and I yield 
back the balance of my time. 
Mr. TAKANO. Madam Speaker, I ask 
all my colleagues to join me in passing 
H.R. 2167, as amended, as sponsored by 
Congresswoman SHERRILL of New Jer-
sey. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Ms. 
MCCOLLUM). The question is on the mo-
tion offered by the gentleman from 
California (Mr. TAKANO) that the House 
suspend the rules and pass the bill, 
H.R. 2167, as amended. 
The question was taken. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the 
opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being 
in the affirmative, the ayes have it. 
Mr. ROSENDALE. Madam Speaker, 
on that I demand the yeas and nays. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to section 3(s) of House Resolution 
8, the yeas and nays are ordered. 
Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, fur-
ther proceedings on this motion are 
postponed.

titled ‘‘Budgetary Effects of PAYGO Legisla-
tion’’ for this Act, submitted for printing in 
the Congressional Record by the Chairman of 
the House Budget Committee, provided that 
such statement has been submitted prior to 
the vote on passage. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from 
California (Mr. TAKANO) and the gen-
tleman from Illinois (Mr. BOST) each 
will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from California. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. TAKANO. Madam Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days within 
which to revise and extend their re-
marks and to insert extraneous mate-
rial on H.R. 2878, as amended. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from California? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. TAKANO. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, I am pleased to 
speak on H.R. 2878, as amended, the Na-
tive VetSuccess at Tribal Colleges and 
Universities Pilot Program Act, intro-
duced by Congressman GALLEGO. 
Started in 2009, the VetSuccess On 
Campus Program helps student vet-
erans succeed and thrive through deliv-
ery of on-campus benefits, assistance, 
and counseling. This outreach is in-
tended to help veterans complete their 
education and prepare them for jobs. 
Since its inception, the program has 
expanded multiple times, and currently 
supports 104 schools across the country 
and is served by 87 VetSuccess coun-
selors. 
b 1500 
However, Tribal colleges and univer-
sities are not currently served by the 
VetSuccess program, creating a gap in 
access to the services and benefits our 
Native American veterans have earned. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
Native 
veterans 
serve in the Armed Forces at five times 
the national average, and have served 
with distinction in every major con-
flict for over 200 years. Native Ameri-
cans have the highest per capita in-
volvement of any population in service 
in the U.S. military, yet these same 
communities that serve disproportion-
ately in our military don’t see the 
same resources delivered back to their 
communities. 
Congressman GALLEGO’s legislation 
begins to close this gap by creating the 
Native VetSuccess at Tribal Colleges 
and Universities Pilot Program Act at 
three sites around the Nation serving 
Tribal colleges. 
But that is not all. This legislation 
also includes additional improvements 
that will deliver more benefits to all 
veterans 
using 
their 
earned 
edu-
cational benefits. 
Included in this legislation is ex-
panded housing benefits for veterans as 
they seek to finish programs of edu-
cation; additional funding for high- 
technology education courses to serve 
more veterans during our economic re-
bound from the COVID–19 pandemic; 
and an extension of VA housing part-
nerships with local communities to 
house more veterans who are experi-
encing or at risk of homelessness. 
Madam Speaker, I applaud Congress-
man GALLEGO, a veteran himself, for 
bringing this package to us, and I ask 
my colleagues to join me in supporting 
the Native VetSuccess at Tribal Col-
leges and Universities Pilot Program 
Act. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. BOST. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today in sup-
port of H.R. 2878, as amended, the Na-
tive VetSuccess at Tribal Colleges and 
Universities Pilot Program Act. 
This bill would direct the VA to 
carry out pilot programs on at least 
two Tribal colleges or university cam-
puses. 
During the pilot, a VetSuccess coun-
selor would be assigned to these cam-
puses to help eligible veterans navigate 
VA programs and benefits. 
I support the underlying bill. I am 
also pleased that the bill, as amended, 
included many Republican provisions.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H2371 
May 17, 2021 
This bill includes the revised text of 
Congresswoman 
MILLER-MEEKS’ 
bill, 
H.R. 2335, the VET TEC Enhancement 
Act of 2021. Her bill would increase 
funding for the popular VET TEC pilot 
program to ensure that funding does 
not run out before the end of the fiscal 
year. The bill also provides additional 
funding for those programs in fiscal 
year 2022 and 2023. 
Madam Speaker, I am glad we au-
thorized additional funds for this im-
portant program that is putting vet-
erans back to work with a 70 percent 
placement rate. I think we would be 
hard-pressed to find another program 
with such a high rate of success. 
This bill also includes the text of 
Congressman MANN’s bill, H.R. 2419, the 
Affordable Housing for Homeless Vet-
erans Act of 2021. Congressman MANN’s 
provision would authorize the VA to 
sell, lease, rent or donate homes to 
homeless veterans providers. 
These homes were acquired by the 
VA due to veterans defaulting on their 
VA-guaranteed 
home 
loans. 
This 
change would increase the stock of af-
fordable housing that is available to 
house homeless veterans. 
Finally, this bill would provide au-
thorization for the VA to continue the 
practice of rounding out the semester 
for GI Bill students. This practice en-
sures that the students who are fin-
ishing their education early are able to 
take an additional class to receive 
their full housing stipend. 
I am dismayed that, without this leg-
islative fix, the Biden administration 
is poised to end the decades-long prac-
tice on August 1. 
Madam Speaker, I thank Chairman 
LEVIN for working with us to ensure 
rounding out continues and students 
are not hurt by the VA’s decision. I 
also thank Congresswoman MILLER- 
MEEKS
and Congressman MANN
for 
their hard work on both of these bills. 
Madam Speaker, I am pleased to sup-
port this bill, and I urge my colleagues 
to do the same. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. TAKANO. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from 
Arizona (Mr. GALLEGO), my good friend 
and an author of this legislation, H.R. 
2878, and a member of the House Vet-
erans’ Affairs Committee. 
Mr. GALLEGO. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today in support of my bill, H.R. 
2878, the Native VetSuccess at Tribal 
Colleges and Universities Pilot Pro-
gram Act. 
I thank Chair TAKANO for bringing 
this bill to the floor. I also thank my 
co-leads on this legislation: Represent-
ative DUSTY JOHNSON, Representative 
TOM O’HALLERAN, and Representative 
TOM COLE. 
Native Americans have served our 
country in every war since the Amer-
ican Revolution. To this day, Native 
Americans volunteer to serve at higher 
rates than any other demographic 
group. I, myself, served alongside Na-
tive American Marines in Iraq. 
Indigenous peoples have a decorated 
history of service, yet Native veterans 
have less access to benefits than other 
groups of veterans. That must change. 
Today, we consider a bill that will 
give Native veterans attending Tribal 
colleges and universities access to an 
already successful student veteran pro-
gram, the VetSuccess on Campus Pro-
gram. 
The VetSuccess program helps stu-
dent veterans graduate on time, suc-
cessfully enter the workforce, and ac-
cess VA benefits at over 100 colleges 
and universities. H.R. 2878 would ex-
tend this successful program to TCUs 
in a regional model to reach as many 
Native veterans as possible. There is no 
time to waste in passing this impor-
tant legislation. 
In 
addition 
to 
expanding 
the 
VetSuccess to Native veterans, H.R. 
2878 includes emergency funds for vet-
eran technology education courses, 
known as VET TEC. The VET TEC pro-
gram was created to allow veterans to 
pursue vocational training for 21st cen-
tury careers in high-tech fields like 
software development, programming, 
coding, media, and more. 
During the pandemic, more veterans 
than ever are looking for training in 
high-skilled, 
high-tech 
careers, 
so 
much so that the VET TEC program 
has run out of money for this year al-
ready. That is why H.R. 2878 includes 
an immediate influx of funds for VET 
TEC so more veterans can receive this 
critical funding. 
H.R. 2878 also includes a provision to 
fight 
veteran 
homelessness. 
The 
COVID–19 pandemic devastated our 
economy and healthcare system in gen-
eral, disproportionately hurting vet-
erans. We don’t know yet the full im-
pact of the pandemic on veteran home-
lessness, but we know veterans need 
our help immediately. 
My bill will extend the authorization 
allowing the VA to partner with non-
profits, States, Tribes, and localities to 
help more veterans find both tem-
porary shelter and permanent housing. 
This provision will save veterans’ lives, 
period. 
Finally, H.R. 2878 includes a provi-
sion to help student veterans keep 
their housing benefits in their final se-
mester of education. Ensuring student 
veterans can remain housed for the du-
ration of their education is essential to 
ensure that veterans graduate on time 
and can successfully enter the work-
force. 
Before I close, I want to especially 
thank Representatives MILLER-MEEKS, 
LEVIN, MANN, and PAPPAS
for their 
work with me on this bipartisan bill. 
Madam Speaker, I urge all my col-
leagues to support this legislation. 
Mr. BOST. Madam Speaker, I yield 3 
minutes to the gentlewoman from Iowa 
(Mrs. MILLER-MEEKS). 
Mrs. 
MILLER-MEEKS. 
Madam 
Speaker, I thank my colleague, Rep-
resentative BOST, for yielding to me. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today in sup-
port of Congressman GALLEGO’s bipar-
tisan Native VetSuccess at Tribal Col-
leges and Universities Pilot Program 
Act. 
I am proud that this legislation was 
amended by the Veterans’ Affairs Com-
mittee to include my bipartisan VET 
TEC Enhancement Act. This legisla-
tion, which I proudly introduced with a 
fellow veteran, Congressman KAHELE, 
would increase the amount authorized 
to be appropriated for the Veteran Em-
ployment 
Through 
Technical 
Edu-
cation Courses program. 
VET TEC is a 5-year pilot program 
that allows eligible veterans to use GI 
Bill-style benefits to attend innovative 
job training programs to prepare them 
for future employment in the tech-
nology industry. 
My bill to support our veterans 
would increase current funding for the 
VET TEC program from $45 million to 
$90 million per year to allow the VA to 
enroll more veterans in this popular 
program. This program ensures that 
our veterans have the tools they need 
to gain meaningful employment. 
To date, over 1,800 veterans have 
completed the VET TEC program and 
found well-paying jobs with an average 
salary of $57,000 per year. 
I have spoken to veterans’ groups in 
my district and across the country, and 
there is overwhelming support for this 
commonsense program. 
This is another highly successful ave-
nue to assist veterans reentering the 
civilian workforce, and I am proud to 
see the House taking action to support 
our veterans. 
In closing, I would like to thank Con-
gressman KAHELE for his partnership 
on this important issue, and Congress-
man GALLEGO for his support. 
Madam Speaker, I urge all of my col-
leagues to support the bipartisan Na-
tive VetSuccess at Tribal Colleges and 
Universities Pilot Program Act. 
Mr. TAKANO. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from 
New Hampshire (Mr. PAPPAS), my good 
friend and chair of the Subcommittee 
on Oversight and Investigations. 
Mr. PAPPAS. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today on behalf of the veterans of our 
military who, following their service, 
are housing insecure. 
Although we have made significant 
strides in combating veteran homeless-
ness, the fact remains that more than 
37,000 veterans are homeless right now, 
and many more are worried about 
keeping a roof over their heads. 
That is why the Affordable Housing 
for Homeless Veterans Act is needed. I 
introduced 
this 
bill 
with 
Sub-
committee on Oversight and Investiga-
tions Ranking Member MANN, and it is 
included as part of H.R. 2878 today. 
This legislation will allow the VA to 
continue to acquire homes through 
foreclosure, and then sell or lease these 
homes to veterans in need of housing. 
This much we know: A veteran who 
has sworn to give everything for the 
United States, up to and including 
their life, should not be without a roof 
over their head and a safe place to 
sleep when their service is over.

H2372 
May 17, 2021 
As President Kennedy said of those 
who have served: ‘‘As we express our 
gratitude, we must never forget that 
the highest appreciation is not to utter 
words, but to live by them.’’ 
Let’s show our veterans our gratitude 
by addressing housing insecurity and 
passing this legislation today, as well 
as the underlying bill sponsored by 
Representative GALLEGO. 
Mr. BOST. Madam Speaker, I yield 3 
minutes to gentleman from Kansas 
(Mr. MANN), my good friend. 
Mr. MANN. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to highlight veterans bills before 
the House floor. 
I appreciate the opportunity to first 
highlight legislation that Representa-
tive PAPPAS and I introduced, aimed at 
helping veteran homelessness. 
H.R. 2878 and the Affordable Housing 
for Homeless Veterans Act of 2021 
would increase the number of afford-
able housing options to help reduce the 
recent uptick in veteran homelessness 
due to the ongoing pandemic. 
Our job on the House Veterans’ Af-
fairs Committee is to ensure that we 
are taking care of and doing right by 
our veterans. This legislation works to 
do just that. Curbing veterans’ home-
lessness and ensuring our Nation’s he-
roes are not without shelter for them-
selves and their families is a top pri-
ority for me. There are over 37,000 vet-
erans experiencing homelessness in 
America. This is not acceptable for our 
veterans, and we must be part of the 
solution. 
I was pleased to see the Department 
of VA and the Department of Housing 
and Urban Development align efforts to 
join forces to find ways to end veteran 
homelessness. One of the priorities 
mentioned by VA and HUD is increas-
ing the supply and access to affordable 
housing. 
My 
legislation 
reauthorizes 
and 
amends the program that allows the 
Secretary of VA to sell, lease, rent or 
donate a home which was acquired by 
VA because a veteran defaulted on 
their VA-guaranteed home loan to a 
public housing authority, grant and per 
diem provider, or a Supportive Services 
for Veterans Families service provider. 
The public housing authority or pro-
viders could then use these homes to 
shelter other veterans and their fami-
lies who are homeless or at risk of be-
coming homeless. 
By reauthorizing this program and 
removing some burdensome regula-
tions from the old program, the num-
ber of affordable housing options in 
higher cost areas will increase and pro-
vide relief to veterans who have lim-
ited affordable housing options. 
I was pleased this legislation re-
ceived bipartisan support from my col-
leagues on the committee, as well as 
many members not on the committee. 
This broad support shows a willingness 
by this House of Representatives to im-
plement these impactful changes for 
our veterans across the country. 
I also had the opportunity to speak 
with VA Secretary McDonough when 
he visited VA facilities in Kansas. I 
spoke to him about the Affordable 
Housing for Homeless Veterans Act, 
and he was encouraged about the work 
we were doing in the committee to help 
veterans. I look forward to my contin-
ued 
partnership 
with 
Secretary 
McDonough and the VA. 
I also want to quickly highlight an-
other piece of legislation I introduced 
along with Representative LAMB, the 
VA 
Equal 
Employment 
Counseling 
Modernization Act. 
b 1515 
This legislation removes burdensome 
regulations by simply removing the 
cap on the number of full-time employ-
ees at the Department of Veterans Af-
fairs who provide equal opportunity 
employment counseling. It is a small, 
incremental change, but changes like 
this help the VA get our veterans into 
jobs quickly and ensure we are giving 
them the best care and guidance pos-
sible. 
I thank Chairman TAKANO and Rank-
ing Member BOST for allowing me to 
speak on behalf of the Affordable Hous-
ing for Veterans Act. I look forward to 
passing these pieces of legislation and 
continuing to work with everyone to 
help veterans. 
Mr. TAKANO. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from 
the State of Hawaii (Mr. KAHELE). 
Mr. KAHELE. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman from California 
for yielding me time. 
Madam Speaker, today, I rise to 
speak in favor of H.R. 2878, the bipar-
tisan Native VetSuccess at Tribal Col-
leges and Universities Pilot Program, 
which includes a bill that I co-led with 
my esteemed colleague from Iowa’s 
Second Congressional District, Con-
gresswoman MILLER-MEEKS, the VET 
TEC Enhancement Act. 
In our Army, Navy, Air Force, Ma-
rines, and Coast Guard, our veterans 
and their families have sacrificed so 
much to protect our Nation and keep 
our country whole. We owe them our 
thanks, we owe them our respect, but 
most importantly, we owe them our 
support as they transition back into ci-
vilian life once their service is over. 
The Veteran Employment Through 
Technical Education Courses, or VET 
TEC, is a 5-year pilot program that al-
lows eligible veterans to use GI Bill- 
style benefits to attend innovative job 
training programs and prepare them 
for future employment in the tech-
nology industry. Our bill would expand 
funding of this program from $45 mil-
lion to $125 million a year, allowing 
more of our men and women in uniform 
to enroll each year. 
The VET TEC program is highly pop-
ular and has a 90 percent completion 
rate, giving our veterans the tools they 
need to gain meaningful employment 
in well-paying jobs. No servicemember 
who has taken the oath to protect and 
defend our country should be left be-
hind in today’s 21st century workforce. 
I am proud to co-lead this important 
legislation, and I look forward to its 
passage and benefit to America’s serv-
icemembers. Mahalo. 
Mr. BOST. Madam Speaker, I encour-
age my colleagues to support this bill, 
and I yield back the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. TAKANO. Madam Speaker, I 
have no further speakers. In closing, I 
ask all my colleagues to join me in 
passing this important piece of legisla-
tion, H.R. 2878, as amended, and I yield 
back the balance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from California (Mr. 
TAKANO) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 2878, as 
amended. 
The question was taken. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the 
opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being 
in the affirmative, the ayes have it. 
Mr. ROSENDALE. Madam Speaker, 
on that I demand the yeas and nays. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to section 3(s) of House Resolution 
8, the yeas and nays are ordered.

DIRECTING SECRETARY OF VET-
ERANS AFFAIRS TO SUBMIT A 
REPORT ON USE OF CAMERAS IN 
MEDICAL CENTERS OF DEPART-
MENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS 
Mr. TAKANO. Madam Speaker, I 
move to suspend the rules and pass the 
bill (H.R. 1510) to direct the Secretary 
of Veterans Affairs to submit to Con-
gress a report on the use of cameras in 
the medical centers of the Department 
of Veterans Affairs, as amended. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 1510 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. REPORT ON USE OF CAMERAS IN

Construction and Facilities Management of 
the Department, shall submit to the Com-
mittees on Veterans’ Affairs of the Senate 
and the House of Representatives a report 
analyzing the policies, use, and maintenance 
of cameras deployed by the Department for 
patient safety and law enforcement at med-
ical facilities of the Department.

(iii) an analysis of the procedures regard-
ing the positioning of cameras; 
(iv) an analysis of the extent to which 
cameras monitor locations where drugs are 
stored to ensure that drugs are accounted 
for, and an assessment of whether this is a

(A) the placement and maintenance of 
cameras; 
(B) the storage of data from such cameras;

(F) any additional actions required to pre-
serve and protect patient privacy; and 
(G) such other matters the Secretary de-
termines appropriate. 
(c) CAMERA DEFINED.—In this section, the 
term ‘‘camera’’ means any video camera 
used in a medical facility of the Department 
of Veterans Affairs for purposes of patient 
safety or law enforcement, but does not in-
clude cameras used solely by the Inspector 
General of the Department of Veterans Af-
fairs to assist in criminal investigations con-
ducted by the Inspector General. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from 
California (Mr. TAKANO) and the gen-
tleman from Illinois (Mr. BOST) each 
will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from California. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. TAKANO. Madam Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days in which to 
revise and extend their remarks and in-
sert extraneous material on H.R. 1510, 
as amended. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from California? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. TAKANO. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in support of 
H.R. 1510, the Veterans’ Camera Re-
porting Act, introduced by Representa-
tive MCKINLEY of West Virginia. 
This bill, as amended by the House 
Committee on Veterans’ Affairs, re-
quires VA to submit a report to Con-
gress analyzing the Department’s use 
and maintenance of video cameras for 
the purposes of patient safety and law 
enforcement within all of its medical 
facilities. 
Last Tuesday, a nursing assistant 
who was formerly employed at a VA 
hospital in West Virginia was sen-
tenced to seven consecutive life sen-
tences plus 20 years after she pleaded 
guilty to murdering seven veterans and 
assaulting an eighth veteran with in-
tent to commit murder. She took insu-
lin that she was not authorized to ad-
minister, and she injected it into vet-
erans who did not need it, killing all 
eight of them. 
Following the sentencing last week, 
the VA Office of the Inspector General 
issued a report identifying numerous 
deficiencies in patient care and failures 
in VA oversight at the facility where 
these murders occurred. Among other 
things, the OIG found that there were 
no cameras in the ward where these 
events occurred, nor in the medication 
room where the insulin was stored, and 
there were no locks or other mecha-
nisms for monitoring access to medica-
tion carts where insulin was also kept. 
There are no words to adequately ex-
press the horror and sorrow we feel 
about the heinous crimes committed 
against these veterans. We cannot 
imagine the pain the families have en-
dured since evidence of these murders 
came to light nearly 3 years ago. We 
can only hope that last week’s sen-
tencing will help the victims’ families 
begin to heal and to find a sense of clo-
sure. 
In Congress, we have a responsibility 
to help ensure that VA never allows 
something like this to happen again. 
Now, as an initial step, we need to bet-
ter understand how VA uses video cam-
eras for monitoring patient safety and 
physical security within its medical fa-
cilities. To that end, H.R. 1510 will re-
quire VA to submit a report summa-
rizing how cameras are used to monitor 
staff and patients, the units within 
which cameras are prioritized, and how 
cameras are used to monitor drug stor-
age. The report also must include rec-
ommendations on improving the use of 
cameras at VA, including whether the 
Department needs additional resources 
to install cameras for patient safety 
and law enforcement purposes. 
This bill will require VA’s report to 
encompass all of its medical facilities 
nationwide. Drug diversion, assaults, 
harassment, suicides, and other patient 
safety incidents can occur at any VA 
medical facility, not just hospitals. VA 
operates more than 1,000 inpatient and 
outpatient facilities across the coun-
try. Congress needs a complete picture 
of the extent to which cameras are 
used across VA so that we can better 
assist the Department in addressing 
any shortfalls. 
Madam Speaker, I urge all Members 
to join me in approving this important 
bill. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. BOST. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today in sup-
port of H.R. 1510, as amended, the Vet-
erans’ Camera Reporting, or the VCR, 
Act. The VCR Act would require VA to 
assess how cameras are used for pa-
tient safety and law enforcement pur-
poses in VA medical center facilities. 
It would also require VA to report to 
Congress about how camera use could 
be improved to make VA safer and 
more responsive to veterans’ needs. 
I was proud to introduce this bill 
with Congressman DAVID MCKINLEY of 
West Virginia and others earlier this 
year. We drafted it in response to a se-
ries of incidents across the country 
where missing or malfunctioning cam-
eras played a role in serious lapses. In 
some of those incidents, veterans’ lives 
were lost. Those tragedies have no 
place in the VA healthcare system. The 
VCR Act will help make sure they will 
never happen again. 
Most importantly, it will help ensure 
that veterans are safe seeking the care 
that they have earned. The VCR Act is 
a bipartisan bill. It is supported by the 
VA and the veterans service organiza-
tions, including The VFW and the 
Wounded Warrior Project. I am grate-
ful for that support. 
Madam Speaker, I encourage all of 
my colleagues to support this bill, and 
I yield back the balance of my time. 
Mr. TAKANO. Madam Speaker, I 
have no further speakers. In closing, I 
ask all my colleagues to join me in 
passing H.R. 1510, which cleared the 
committee unanimously. I can see no 
reason why any Member would vote 
against this bill. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.

the gentleman from California (Mr. 
TAKANO) that the House suspend the

ECO-

Mr. TAKANO. Madam Speaker, I

United States Code, to establish in the 
Department the Veterans Economic

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from 
California (Mr. TAKANO) and the gen-
tleman from Illinois (Mr. BOST) each 
will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from California. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. TAKANO. Madam Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days in which to 
revise and extend their remarks and in-
sert extraneous material on H.R. 2494. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from California? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. TAKANO. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, I am pleased to 
speak on H.R. 2494, introduced by Con-
gressman WENSTRUP, and which would 
establish a fourth administration at 
the Department of Veterans Affairs fo-
cused on economic opportunity and 
transition. 
When our servicemembers conclude 
their time with the armed services, 
they are tasked with returning to civil-
ian life. This is the sacrifice they make 
for our security, and in exchange, we 
owe them more than a thank you and 
well wishes. We owe them a commit-
ment that they will be supported in 
their transition to civilian life, and 
that they will have a VA that is re-
sponsive to their needs. 
That is why we passed the first GI 
Bill nearly 75 years ago to the day and 
why we continue today to make im-
provements in providing our Nation’s 
veterans with the benefits they have 
earned. 
Unfortunately, VA has struggled to 
track the effectiveness of programs for 
education and employment, and Con-
gress has struggled to determine the 
Department’s resource needs in these 
areas. 
Madam Speaker, one of the main rea-
sons we have identified through hear-
ings and discussion with our veterans 
service organizations is that the Vet-
erans Benefits Administration is sim-
ply asked to do too much. While man-
aging compensation claims is impor-
tant, the responsibility of managing 
transition, education, and housing ben-
efits often takes a backseat. To put it 
in perspective, the Veterans Benefits 
Administration’s structure has not sig-
nificantly changed since the Veterans 
Administration was established in 1930. 
Madam Speaker, during the last 89 
years, the services needed by veterans 
has dramatically changed, which is 
why our committee has an Economic 
Opportunity Subcommittee. It is time 
for the importance of economic oppor-
tunity to be elevated at VA as well. 
This bipartisan bill would create a 
new administration within the Depart-
ment to manage educational assist-
ance, vocational rehabilitation, and 
employment, education, career coun-
seling programs, and broadly defined 
shared transition assistance programs. 
That means a dedicated Under Sec-
retary for Veterans Economic Oppor-
tunity and Transition solely focused on 
fulfilling our promise to the veterans 
that they will get the education they 
want, the housing they need, and the 
careers they deserve. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. BOST. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today in sup-
port of H.R. 2494, which would direct 
the VA to create a new fourth adminis-
tration. This new administration would 
oversee programs that support eco-
nomic opportunity for our veterans. 
During my time in Congress, I have 
seen repeated instances of mismanage-
ment within the programs. I believe it 
is time for this new administration to 
be created so that more focus can be 
placed on economic opportunities for 
our veterans. This new focus is even 
more important today as we are trying 
to help veterans get back on the right 
economic track following the COVID–19 
pandemic. 
I 
want 
to 
thank 
Congressman 
WENSTRUP for his dedication and hard 
work on this bill. 
Madam Speaker, I want to thank my 
colleagues. I urge them to support this 
bill, and I yield back the balance of my 
time. 
b 1530 
Mr. TAKANO. Madam Speaker, I ask 
all of my colleagues to join me in pass-
ing this important piece of legislation, 
H.R. 2494, and I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from California (Mr. 
TAKANO) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 2494. 
The question was taken. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the 
opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being 
in the affirmative, the ayes have it. 
Mr. ROSENDALE. Madam Speaker, 
on that I demand the yeas and nays. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to section 3(s) of House Resolution 
8, the yeas and nays are ordered. 
Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, fur-
ther proceedings on this motion are 
postponed.

SGT. KETCHUM RURAL VETERANS 
MENTAL HEALTH ACT OF 2021 
Mr. TAKANO. Madam Speaker, I 
move to suspend the rules and pass the 
bill (H.R. 2441) to direct the Secretary 
of Veterans Affairs to expand the Rural 
Access Network for Growth Enhance-
ment Program of the Department of 
Veterans Affairs, and to direct the 
Comptroller General of the United 
States to conduct a study to assess cer-
tain mental health care resources of 
the Department of Veterans Affairs 
available to veterans who live in rural 
areas. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill.

The Chair recognizes the gentleman

GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. TAKANO. Madam Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
have 5 legislative days in which to re-
vise and extend their remarks and to 
insert extraneous material on H.R. 
2441. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from California? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. TAKANO. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, I am pleased to 
speak on H.R. 2441, the Sgt. Ketchum 
Rural Veterans Mental Health Act of 
2021, introduced by Congresswoman 
AXNE. 
This bill has not only bipartisan sup-
port, but also bicameral support with 
the recent introduction of a companion 
bill from Senate Veterans’ Affairs 
Committee 
Chairman 
TESTER
and 
Ranking Member MORAN. 
This bill is named for an Iowa vet-
eran who died by suicide after failing 
to receive intensive treatment for his 
PTSD. It is designed to honor his mem-
ory with action and to prevent a simi-
lar outcome for his fellow veterans. 
Through this legislation, VA will 
open three new RANGE programs in 
rural locations, including territories 
and insular areas. VA RANGE pro-
grams offer intensive outpatient serv-
ices and case management for rural 
veterans with mental illness, housing 
and food insecurity, financial issues, 
and problems with daily living. They 
can be absolutely lifesaving for vet-
erans who need this kind of wrap-
around care and safety nets. 
Additionally, this bill calls for a GAO 
study of how accessible VA’s con-
tinuum of superior mental healthcare 
services, from outpatient to residential 
and inpatient, really is for rural vet-
erans. 
We all know that even a well-de-
signed system may not reach every 
veteran who needs it. With this legisla-
tion, our work to close the gaps will be 
guided by data. I, therefore, ask my 
colleagues to join me in supporting the 
Sgt. Ketchum Rural Veterans Mental 
Health Act. 
Madam Speaker, I support this legis-
lation, and I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. BOST. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today in sup-
port of H.R. 2441, the Sgt. Ketchum 
Rural Veterans Mental Health Act. 
May is Mental Health Awareness 
Month. I am pleased to commemorate 
it today by passing this bill to expand 
mental healthcare to veterans in rural 
areas. 
The Sgt. Ketchum Rural Veterans 
Mental Health Act would expand VA’s 
RANGE program. The RANGE program 
provides veterans who have serious 
mental illness or who are at risk of 
homelessness with intense case man-
agement. 
Almost a quarter of our Nation’s vet-
erans reside in rural communities. I am 
one of those veterans who does. While I 
wouldn’t have it any other way, I know 
firsthand that living in a rural area 
can be a barrier to care. This bill will 
help remove that barrier for some of 
our most vulnerable veterans. It will 
help ensure that they do not fall 
through the cracks. It will help them 
heal. 
It will also require GAO to assess 
whether VA has sufficient resources to 
support mental health in rural areas. 
That will help identify any other bar-
riers to care that may exist for these 
veterans so that we can break them 
down. 
This bill is supported by the entire 
Iowa 
delegation, 
including 
by 
my 
friend, fellow veteran, and fellow com-
mittee 
member, 
Congresswoman 
MARIANNETTE MILLER-MEEKS. 
It is named after Brandon Ketchum, 
an Iowa veteran who died by suicide in 
2016. My heartfelt condolences go out 
to his family and friends. I am honored 
to support this bill today in Brandon’s 
memory. 
Madam Speaker, I urge all of my col-
leagues to join me, and I reserve the 
balance of my time. 
Mr. TAKANO. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 5 minutes to the gentlewoman 
from Iowa (Mrs. AXNE), my good friend 
and the author of H.R. 2441. 
Mrs. AXNE. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor an Iowan, a Marine, and 
a fallen hero, Brandon Ketchum. 
I am also here to make a promise to 
his mother, Bev. When I introduced 
this legislation, I told Bev that Bran-
don’s story was one that would ensure 
that other veterans get the mental 
health help that they need. Today, we 
are here to take that next step in keep-
ing that promise. 
Five years ago, retired Sergeant 
Brandon Ketchum took his own life 
when he was unable to get the mental 
healthcare 
he 
needed. 
Sergeant 
Ketchum had served two tours in Iraq 
and another in Afghanistan. In his first 
tour alone, he helped clear 92 roadside 
bombs in 7 months, service that earned 
him the Combat Action Ribbon. 
His heroic service wasn’t his only 
role, however. He was a loving father, 
son, brother, and friend. But like many 
veterans, Sergeant Ketchum struggled 
with depression, addiction, and PTSD 
related to his time in uniform. 
After his service, Brandon volun-
teered and spoke publicly to students 
about his experience with PTSD. But 
despite receiving therapy and addiction 
treatment after returning from his 
tours, Brandon had a hard time adjust-
ing to civilian life. 
When 
he 
sought 
inpatient 
hos-
pitalization in 2016 from an Iowa VA, 
the treatment rooms were full, and he 
was turned down for the care he need-
ed. Hours later, Sergeant Ketchum 
took his own life. 
We all know that veterans do not 
have enough mental health resources 
across this country. Nearly 17 veterans 
die by suicide every day, and a recent 
HHS study found that only 50 percent 
of returning vets who need mental 
health treatment will receive it. And, 
in particular, these mental health serv-
ices are even harder to find in our Na-
tion’s rural areas, areas that I and my 
Iowa colleagues represent here in Con-
gress. 
The truth is sad, but it is pretty sim-
ple. We are failing our veterans. Bran-
don asked us for help, but he was 
turned away because of a lack of re-
sources. So, we must make sure, in his 
memory and for the sake of others still 
serving, that when our soldiers return 
home, they can get the treatment that 
they need. 
My bill will increase mental health 
facilities in rural areas by establishing 
three new Rural Access Network for 
Growth 
Enhancement 
programs, 
known by their acronym RANGE. 
RANGE programs provide rural vet-
erans with more mental health re-
sources, including access to a team of 
experts who can provide intensive ad-
diction and mental health treatment, 
helping veterans reintegrate into their 
communities. 
My bill will also study how the VA is 
currently meeting the needs of rural 
veterans with mental health issues and 
what resources may be needed to im-
prove their care so that we can actu-
ally address the root causes of mental 
health issues in our rural areas and 
with our veterans. 
Not only is this an important cause, 
but it is a bipartisan one, too. As men-
tioned, all four members of our Iowa 
delegation have joined together and 
signed on to this. I would like to thank 
them all for doing that, my incredible 
cosponsors, and, of course, Chairman 
TAKANO
and 
subcommittee 
Chair-
woman BROWNLEY for their support of 
this bill, as well as their constant dedi-
cation to our veterans.

May 17, 2021 
Veterans put their lives on the line 
and serve our Nation with honor. When 
they come home, they should be able to 
receive the care that they need regard-
less of ZIP Code. 
We can’t simply accept that Bran-
don’s death is a tragedy, and that is 
just what it is. We have to use his story 
to make the changes that are long 
overdue and to ensure that no other 
veteran falls through the cracks. 
We must take action to address the 
rural health shortages and the mental 
health needs of our Nation’s veterans. I 
urge all of my colleagues to honor Ser-
geant Ketchum’s legacy with a ‘‘yes’’ 
vote on this bill. 
Mr. BOST. Madam Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentlewoman from Iowa 
(Mrs. MILLER-MEEKS), from the Second 
Congressional District. 
Mrs. 
MILLER-MEEKS. 
Madam 
Speaker, I thank my colleague from Il-
linois for yielding me time. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
speak in support of the bipartisan Sgt. 
Ketchum 
Rural 
Veterans 
Mental 
Health Act, which I was proud to intro-
duce with the Iowa House delegation. 
This legislation was named in honor 
of the memory and service of Sergeant 
Brandon Ketchum of Davenport, which 
is in my congressional district. Ser-
geant Ketchum died by suicide in 2016 
after being denied access to much- 
needed 
mental 
health 
services 
for 
PTSD at the VA facility in Iowa City. 
Our legislation would establish new 
Rural Access Network for Growth En-
hancement, 
or 
RANGE, 
programs 
throughout the VA and support addi-
tional research on rural veteran men-
tal healthcare needs. 
The case of Sergeant Ketchum is 
tragic and shows us that we must do 
more to serve our veterans. Expanding 
healthcare services in rural America 
and among our veterans are two of my 
top priorities in Congress, so I am 
proud to join the entire Iowa delega-
tion in this effort. We simply have to 
do better for our veterans. There is no 
other option. 
I would like to thank my colleagues 
in the Iowa delegation, Congresswoman 
AXNE, 
Congresswoman 
HINSON, 
and 
Congressman FEENSTRA, for their part-
nership in this simple legislation to 
help veterans. I urge all of my col-
leagues to support the bipartisan Sgt. 
Ketchum 
Rural 
Veterans 
Mental 
Health Act. 
Mr. TAKANO. Madam Speaker, I 
have no further speakers, and I am pre-
pared to close. 
But before I reserve the balance of 
my time, let me say that I am very, 
very pleased that we are addressing the 
issue of mental healthcare in our rural 
areas. As we wind down this pandemic, 
I think we are going to see not just 
veterans but Americans of all stripes 
who live in our rural areas dealing with 
the need for increased numbers of men-
tal healthcare practitioners. 
I congratulate and I thank the work 
of my colleague, Congresswoman AXNE, 
in moving the VA a step forward in 
this area. But there is far more that 
needs to be done. 
I reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. BOST. Madam Speaker, I yield 3 
minutes to the gentlewoman from Iowa 
(Mrs. HINSON), from the First Congres-
sional District. 
Mrs. 
HINSON. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
today, I rise in support of H.R. 2441, the 
Sgt. Ketchum Rural Veterans Mental 
Health Act. 
I want to start off by thanking my 
colleague, Congresswoman CINDY AXNE, 
for introducing this legislation and for 
her leadership. I was proud to join the 
gentlewoman and our entire Iowa dele-
gation, as has already been mentioned, 
to introduce this very important bipar-
tisan bill for our veterans. 
Sergeant Ketchum from Davenport 
served our country honorably overseas 
in both Iraq and Afghanistan. But let’s 
be real: Not every war wound is visible. 
Many veterans struggle when they 
come home with serious mental health 
challenges. When Sergeant Ketchum 
returned home from his tours, he bat-
tled again; this time with post-trau-
matic stress disorder. 
Sergeant Ketchum sought help at the 
Iowa City VA hospital but was turned 
away. Shortly after, he did take his 
own life. 
No veteran should be denied the help 
and the care that they need after dedi-
cating their lives to serving our coun-
try. No veteran should ever be turned 
away like Sergeant Ketchum was. 
Unfortunately, veterans who live in 
rural areas face increased challenges 
and additional barriers to accessing the 
treatment that they need. 
Our legislation, named in honor of 
Sergeant Ketchum, will improve access 
to mental health services for veterans 
in rural areas. Our veterans put their 
lives on the line every day to protect 
our freedoms, and we have a duty to 
ensure that they can receive high-qual-
ity treatment once they return home 
from service. 
We have a duty to ensure that our 
veterans know they aren’t alone and 
that we have their backs, regardless of 
where they live. 
I am proud to work alongside my col-
leagues in Iowa to improve access to 
mental health services for veterans in 
rural areas and to help ensure that no 
veteran is denied the care that they de-
serve. 
I urge all of our colleagues to support 
the Sgt. Ketchum Rural Veterans Men-
tal Health Act. Vote ‘‘yes’’ in honor of 
Sergeant Ketchum and the thousands 
of veterans like him who need and de-
serve our support. 
b 1545 
Mr. TAKANO. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. BOST. Madam Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from Iowa 
(Mr. FEENSTRA). 
Mr. FEENSTRA. Madam Speaker, 
our veterans deserve the best care and 
attention, including when it comes to 
treating unseen wounds. That is why I 
am honored to be part of this effort to 
expand mental health services to our 
veterans in rural areas. 
The Sgt. Ketchum Rural Veterans’ 
Mental Health Act is named in honor 
of Sergeant Brandon Ketchum, an 
Iowan and a Marine Corps veteran who 
served in Iraq and Afghanistan. 
After serving overseas, he suffered 
from a number of physical and mental 
conditions. 
Tragically, 
Sergeant 
Ketchum took his own life after failing 
to receive the mental healthcare he 
needed from the VA. 
It is clear, mental healthcare short-
comings for our veterans need to be ad-
dressed, and that is what this bill does. 
I thank my colleague from Iowa, 
Congresswoman AXNE, for her work on 
this important bill. I also thank my 
colleagues, 
Congresswoman 
MILLER- 
MEEKS and Congresswoman HINSON, for 
their work as well. 
God bless all those who have fought 
to protect our country. We owe them 
our help. 
Mr. TAKANO. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. BOST. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself the balance of my time for the 
purpose of closing. 
Madam Speaker, I just encourage ev-
eryone to support this piece of legisla-
tion. There should be no one that 
would vote against this. 
Like all of the pieces of legislation 
that we have worked on this afternoon, 
Madam Speaker, I do want to thank 
the chairman and his staff for the job 
of working together. This is truly a 
case where this committee has done its 
bipartisan work the way it should. 
I also want to thank our staff for the 
hard work that they have put in with 
each one of these bills, as well as each 
of the Members today who have pre-
sented these pieces of legislation. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. TAKANO. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself the balance of my time. 
Madam Speaker, I extend my thanks 
to Ranking Member BOST and the Re-
publicans on the committee and all 
staff from both sides of the aisle for 
putting together this package of 10 
bills in advance of Memorial Day. It is 
especially poignant to end today’s 
package of bills with a bill named in 
memory of Sergeant Ketchum. 
As we failed to reach Sergeant 
Ketchum in a timely and effective way 
in rural America, let’s not forget that 
the VA’s mental healthcare has im-
proved greatly over the past several 
years. We need to make sure that qual-
ity of healthcare gets out into the 
rural areas. 
We are charged as a Veterans’ Affairs 
Committee to deal with our veterans 
and their healthcare needs. Part of the 
answer to serving our veterans is to 
make sure that we have robust pro-
viders, regardless of whether they serve 
veterans or the general population. We 
need to look at how we are going to do 
that in rural America, including our 
territories and insular areas.

I will use this moment on the floor to 
plug that cause with all of my col-
leagues who may be listening from 
their offices. We must, for the sake of 
all the folks that have suffered so long 
from this pandemic, look at how we are 
going to provide a robust provider net-
work for mental healthcare. 
As we head into the Memorial Day 
weekend, I am so gratified and pleased 
with the work we have done on a bipar-
tisan basis to produce this package of 
bills and that we have preserved the 
spirit of the committee. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to pass H.R. 2441, and I yield 
back the balance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The

ant to section 3(s) of House Resolution

Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, fur-
ther proceedings on this motion are

tleman from Oklahoma (Mr. LUCAS) 
each will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from Oregon. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Ms. BONAMICI. Madam Speaker, I 
ask unanimous consent that all Mem-
bers may have 5 legislative days in 
which to revise and extend their re-
marks and include extraneous material 
on H.R. 1447, the bill now under consid-
eration. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from Oregon? 
There was no objection. 
Ms. BONAMICI. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
I rise today in support of the Coastal 
and Ocean Acidification Stressors and 
Threats, or COAST, Research Act, my 
bipartisan bill to help coastal commu-
nities adapt to the climate crisis by ex-
panding 
scientific 
research, 
moni-
toring, and adaptation of ocean and 
coastal acidification. 
I want to thank all of the staff on 
both sides of the aisle, from the com-
mittee and my personal staff, espe-
cially Maxine Sugarman, for all their 
work on this bill. 
Every person on this planet benefits 
from a healthy ocean. The ocean covers 
more than 70 percent of the planet’s 
surface. It supplies much of the oxygen 
that we breathe and regulates our cli-
mate. It is linked to the water we 
drink, and it is home to more than half 
of all life on the planet. The power of 
its waves generates clean energy. The 
ocean drives our economy, feeds, em-
ploys, and transports us. But despite 
our intrinsic connection, for too long 
the ocean has taken the heat for us. 
According to the Fourth National 
Climate Assessment, atmospheric car-
bon dioxide concentrations are now 
higher than at any time in the last 3 
million years. Approximately one-third 
of the carbon dioxide in the atmos-
phere dissolves into our ocean and es-
tuaries, causing them to become more 
acidic. 
Ocean and coastal acidification make 
it difficult for shellfish, coral, and 
other marine organisms to build their 
shells and skeletal structures. Some 
finfish, including endangered salmon in 
the Pacific Northwest, lose their sense 
of smell necessary for identifying prey, 
reproducing, and navigating their habi-
tats. Our understanding of the long- 
term consequences of ocean acidifica-
tion is still limited, but we do know 
that the changes in ocean chemistry 
are already affecting the fishers and 
shellfish farmers who depend on the 
ocean’s resources to support them-
selves and their families and the Tribes 
that have treaty rights and deep cul-
tural and historical connections to di-
minishing species. 
The most effective strategy for miti-
gating ocean acidification is reducing 
anthropogenic sources of carbon diox-
ide pollution worldwide. I have joined 
with colleagues on the Select Com-
mittee on the Climate Crisis in releas-
ing a bold, comprehensive, and science- 
based Climate Action Plan to reach 
net-zero emissions no later than mid- 
century and net-negative thereafter. 
But there are also actions that we can 
take immediately to improve condi-
tions, lessen exposure to ocean acidifi-
cation, and manage local pollution and 
conditions that can exacerbate acidifi-
cation. 
This bill, which I introduced with my 
fellow co-chair of the House Oceans 
Caucus, Representative YOUNG
from 
Alaska, and with Representatives PIN-
GREE and POSEY, would improve sci-
entific research on ocean and coastal 
acidification in the context of other 
environmental 
stressors 
and 
direct 
Federal agencies to assess adaptation 
and mitigation strategies. Funding has 
lagged behind the needs of the sci-
entific community for years, and this 
bill would provide a modest, but impor-
tant, increase for the National Oceanic 
and Atmospheric Administration and 
the National Science Foundation to 
scale up research efforts. Importantly, 
the bill also expands the definition of 
ocean acidification to include estuaries 
and recognize mechanisms that cause 
changes in coastal chemistry. 
NOAA 
is 
already 
leading 
inter-
disciplinary efforts to expand our un-
derstanding of changing ocean condi-
tions in its role as chair of the Inter-
agency Working Group on Ocean Acidi-
fication. In fact, this year marks the 
10th anniversary of the NOAA Ocean 
Acidification Program, and I hope my 
colleagues will join me in applauding 
their work to truly advance regionally 
coordinated scientific research. 
A September 2015 Government Ac-
countability Office report suggested 
that an independent national ocean 
acidification program could advance 
our understanding of changing ocean 
conditions. The COAST Research Act 
designates NOAA as the lead Federal 
agency responsible for implementing 
the Federal response to ocean and 
coastal acidification, further empow-
ering the Ocean Acidification Program 
to scale up its efforts with its first re-
authorization in more than a decade. 
Additionally, the COAST Research 
Act increases our understanding of the 
socioeconomic effects of ocean and 
coastal acidification and, importantly, 
it engages stakeholders. The bill cre-
ates an advisory board of representa-
tives of the shellfish and crab industry, 
finfish industry, seafood processors, 
recreational fishing, academia, non-
governmental 
organizations, 
State, 
local, and Tribal governments, and re-
gional coastal acidification networks. 
The regionally balanced board will ad-
vise NOAA and the Interagency Work-
ing Group on coastal and ocean acidifi-
cation research and monitoring activi-
ties. This collaborative process will 
help make sure that vulnerable and af-
fected communities, industries, and 
coastal and ocean managers have the 
tools they need to adapt and mitigate 
the effects of coastal and ocean acidifi-
cation. 
For example, at Oregon State Univer-
sity, Dr. Burke Hales developed the 
‘‘Burke-o-Lator,’’ a device the size of a 
piece of carry-on luggage, that can 
analyze when shellfish growers across 
the Pacific Northwest should grow lar-
vae based on the ocean acidity and the 
effects on calcium carbonates needed 
for shell formation. Other research at 
Oregon State has demonstrated how 
growing 
particular 
seagrasses 
and 
kelps can help counteract ocean acidi-
fication. These examples help dem-
onstrate what is possible when we in-
vest in science and research to help 
coastal communities adapt to the cli-
mate crisis. 
The COAST Research Act directs 
NOAA to maintain a system to process, 
store, archive, and provide access to 
data on ocean and coastal acidification 
from federally funded research, includ-
ing 
existing 
global 
or 
national 
datasets, and research from State and 
local agencies, Tribes, academic sci-
entists, citizen scientists, and industry 
organizations. These efforts will help 
provide for the long-term stewardship 
and standardization of ocean acidifica-
tion data and better help communities 
adapt and mitigate the worst effects. 
Madam Speaker, the health of our 
ocean reflects the health of our planet. 
Today, we have the opportunity to help 
it become more resilient by passing the 
bipartisan COAST Research Act. 
I thank Chairwoman JOHNSON
and 
Ranking Member LUCAS and my co- 
sponsors for their leadership. I urge my 
colleagues to support the bill. 
I reference letters from Earthjustice, 
Ocean Conservancy, Wild Salmon Cen-
ter, Pacific Coast Shellfish Growers As-
sociation, Integrated Ocean Observing 
System Association, Surfrider Founda-
tion, Oregon Coordinating Council on

DEAR REPRESENTATIVE BONAMICI: We write 
to offer Oregon State University’s support 
for The Coastal and Ocean Acidification 
Stressors and Threats (COAST) Research 
Act. 
As marine habitats face new and daunting 
pressures threatening their sustainability, 
the COAST Research Act identifies the grow-
ing need for strategic and robust invest-
ments in ocean acidification (OA) research, 
monitoring and stakeholder collaboration. 
Oregon State University is committed to

oceans and coast communities. OSU has a 
deep history of global leadership in oceanog-
raphy and engages in nationally ranked 
oceanographic 
monitoring 
programs 
and 
world-leading OA research. Further, the uni-
versity recognizes that Oregon’s estuaries 
and coastal regions are home to some of the 
world’s most productive ecosystems and eco-
nomically vital shellfish farms. 
The university is encouraged that the 
COAST Research Act expands the definition 
of OA to include coastal and estuarine sys-
tems, and identifies OA as being affected by 
a combination of factors, including hypoxia. 
The university believes that by expanding 
federal definitions of OA and by increasing 
funding opportunities, researchers and man-
agers will be able to best utilize resources to 
find solutions to address OA. 
The university also is encouraged that this 
legislation recognizes the need for federal 
engagement to continue important invest-
ments to understand and address ocean and 
coastal acidification. Doing so will enhance 
the integration of OA research, monitoring 
and adaptation strategies across principal 
federal research agencies, including the Na-
tional Science Foundation, National Oceano-
graphic and Atmospheric Administration, 
and the National Aeronautics and Space Ad-
ministration. 
Oregon State University understands that 
effective and collaborative partnerships and 
communication are essential for our state 
and nation to find adaptive and mitigation 
solutions to address OA. For example, the 
proposal to establish an Ocean Acidification 
Advisory Board will be essential for facili-
tating the important work still to be done. 
The world’s ocean belongs to everyone, and 
ocean health is critical to our future. In the 
coming decades, it will be essential for the 
nation and its universities to work collabo-
ratively to improve and sustain the health of 
our oceans. Doing so, we will assure human 
wellness, environmental health and eco-
nomic prosperity for future generations. 
In closing, Oregon State University be-
lieves that the COAST Research Act pro-
poses important new strategic tools to ex-
pand understanding and address the prob-
lems facing our oceans and coastal commu-
nities. 
Sincerely, 
EDWARD FESER, Ph.D.,

PACIFIC STATES MARINE 
FISHERIES COMMISSION, 
Portland, OR, February 9, 2021. 
Hon. SUZANNE BONAMICI, 
Washington, DC. 
DEAR REPRESENTATIVE BONAMICI: On behalf 
of the Pacific States Marine Fisheries Com-
mission, I am writing in support of the 
Coastal and Ocean Acidification Stressors 
and Threats (COAST) Research Act. 
The COAST Act would dedicate greater re-
sources and focus on the issue of ocean acidi-
fication. The legislation increases Federal 
research, planning, interagency coordina-
tion, data collection, stakeholder input, and 
socioeconomic study into this growing and 
vexing problem impacting our marine fish-
eries and wildlife. The Commission appre-
ciates the thoughtful and bipartisan ap-
proach you and Representatives Young, Pin-
gree and Posey have taken in developing the 
bill. 
The Commission’s membership includes 
the State fisheries and wildlife agencies of 
five West Coast states, including Alaska, 
California, Idaho, Oregon and Washington. 
Our coastal members have seen the firsthand 
impact of ocean acidification with early re-
search showing a detrimental effect on shell 
formation in our crab and shellfish species. 
Over time, these chemical changes to shell 
composition could be devastating to our val-
uable Dungeness crab fishery and inshore 
shellfish aquaculture operators. There is 
much more that needs to be learned about 
the effect of ocean acidification on these and 
other marine species so that appropriate 
public policy measures and solutions can be 
pursued at both the Federal and state levels. 
Ocean acidification is one side effect of 
other changes in ocean temperatures and 
conditions that have been harmful along the 
West Coast. Regional temperature oscilla-
tion during the El Nino/La Nina cycles has 
increased dramatically in recent years. Av-
erage sea surface temperatures have in-
creased by as much as 7 degrees in some 
years resulting to many unfortunate effects 
to fisheries and marine mammals, including 
harmful algal blooms leading to Dungeness 
crab season closures; low salmon returns due 
to reduced ocean survivability of juvenile 
fish; shifts in whale migration patterns caus-
ing greater entanglement in fishing gear and 
shipping vessel strikes; and sea lion strand-
ing and die-offs from consumption of crab 
and shellfish poisoned by domoic acid. 
Thank you for your leadership in reintro-
ducing the COAST Act. The Commission 
stands ready to assist and serve as a resource 
for you and your staff as the bill moves 
through the legislative process. 
Sincerely, 
RANDY FISHER, 
Executive Director. 
PCSGA, PACIFIC COAST SHELLFISH 
GROWERS ASSOCIATION, 
March 18, 2021. 
Hon. SUZANNE BONAMICI, 
House of Representatives, 
Washington, DC. 
DEAR REPRESENTATIVE BONAMICI: On behalf 
of the members of Pacific Coast Shellfish 
Growers Association (PCSGA), I am submit-
ting this letter of support for the Coastal 
and 
Ocean 
Acidification 
Stressors 
and 
Threats (COAST) Research Act of 2019. Shell-
fish growers were the first community to 
call attention to the problems associated 
with ocean acidification when, in 2007, they 
experienced severe oyster larvae mortality 
in two out of three major west coast shell-
fish hatcheries. Since then, PCSGA has en-
gaged in several local, state, and federal ef-
forts and initiatives to ensure a future for 
this historic industry. 
Shellfish farming on the west coast began 
in the late 1800’s, fueled the California Gold 
Rush and was the reason for the development 
of many coastal towns. Today, PCSGA, 
proudly represents 120 shellfish farms in 
Alaska, Washington, Oregon, California and 
Hawaii which farm mussels, clams, oysters 
and geoduck. Our members not only produce 
sustainable, healthy, food, but also provide 
significant ecosystem services such aquatic 
habitat and water filtration, and support 
thousands of family-wage jobs within rural 
coastal communities. 
For nearly a decade, the shellfish industry 
has benefited from NOAA’s Ocean Acidifica-
tion Program and the Integrated Ocean Ob-
serving System (IOOS), both of which relate 
to the Federal Ocean Acidification Research 
and Monitoring (FOARAM) Act of 2009. 
These programs and the directives within 
FOARAM have influenced the way shellfish 
growers operate their farms among the un-
certainty of changing ocean conditions. His-
torically, growers only consulting their tide 
charts. Now, growers rely upon a variety of 
real-time data and tools to understand the 
ocean changes and adapt methods and prac-
tices which allow them to continue farming 
in a productive and profitable manner. There 
much work ahead of us and much yet to 
learn. COAST Research Act provides an es-
sential pathway forward. 
We are excited by the intent of COAST Re-
search Act, the opportunities it provides and 
that it’s been included as part of the Climate 
Action Plan. We see how COAST will further 
investments in ocean and coastal acidifica-
tion research and monitoring, assist shellfish 
community with much needed adaptation 
strategies and coordinate work with stake-
holders. Simply put, COAST is a logical and 
necessary follow-up to FOARAM and allows 
us to continue asking questions and seek in-
novative approaches to mitigate the impacts 
related to ocean acidification. 
Thank you very much for your leadership 
on this and for your commitment to ensur-
ing the long-term health of our coastal and 
marine areas upon which shellfish growers 
depend. 
Respectfully, 
MARGARET A. PILARO, 
Executive Director. 
THE OREGON COORDINATING COUNCIL 
ON OCEAN ACIDIFICATION AND HY-
POXIA, 
February 12th, 2021. 
Re Coastal and Ocean Acidification Stressors 
and Threats (COAST) Research Act. 
Hon. SUZANNE BONAMICI, 
Washington, DC. 
As the Co-Chairs of the State legislatively 
mandated, Oregon Coordinating Council on 
Ocean Acidification and Hypoxia (or ‘‘Oregon 
OAH Council’’), we appreciate the oppor-
tunity to provide you with a letter of strong 
support for the Coastal and Ocean Acidifica-
tion Stressors and Threats (COAST) Re-
search Act. Addressing intensifying ocean 
acidification (OA) conditions here in Oregon, 
as well as across the United States, is crit-
ical to our Nation’s understanding of larger 
impacts from CO2 emissions. 
Oregon is among the first places in the 
world to observe direct impacts of ocean 
acidification and hypoxia (OAH), due to our 
unique geographic and oceanographic con-
text, putting our fragile marine ecosystem 
at risk. Our coastal economies rely on our 
vibrant marine ecosystem. Our nearshore 
waters are home to sport and commercial 
fisheries, all of the State’s mariculture oper-
ations, and contain critical nursery grounds 
for economically important species including 
rockfish, oysters, salmon, pink shrimp, and 
Dungeness crab. Oregon is not alone in expe-
riencing the impacts from OA or hypoxia. 
Through actions such as those in the COAST 
Research Act we must act together as Amer-
icans to develop solutions for our coastal 
communities, economies, and ecosystems to 
prepare for future conditions. 
In the coming years, the Oregon OAH 
Council will continue to take a collabo-
rative, science-based approach to developing 
recommendations to address OAH in our 
state and beyond. Through further invest-
ments and initiatives, Oregon and the United 
States will benefit from adaptation and miti-
gation measures and will model to the world 
how to develop actionable solutions for OA 
adaptation and mitigation. 
Oregon has identified three urgently need-
ed strategic actions, which directly align 
with objectives within the COAST Research 
Act. 
(1) Monitoring of key oceanographic and 
biological indicators of impacts from OAH. 
At the same time that OA has been im-
pacting our coasts, oxygen-depletion is on 
the rise; Oregon and much of the West coast 
has seen several seasons in a row with ex-
tended periods of hypoxia in our coastal

waters. The Oregon OAH Council is encour-
aged that the COAST Research Act identifies 
the need to strengthen investments in OA re-
search and monitoring in the context of 
other environmental stressors. Ocean acidifi-
cation 
and 
hypoxia 
are 
compounding 
stressors for a wide range of marine animals, 
and as such must continue to be studied to-
gether. Through the COAST Research Acts 
reauthorization of funding of NOAA, NSF, 
and NASA, much needed resources will be 
made available to researchers across the 
United States to continue to expand our 
knowledge of OAH. The Oregon OAH Council 
also supports the initiative of the COAST 
Research Act to create data processing, stor-
age, and archive facilities to provide for the 
long-term stewardship and standardization 
of data. By creating a central repository for 
OAH data it provides governments, sci-
entists, and industry better access to the in-
formation need to inform their mitigation 
and adaption planning. Only by maximizing 
our current data and filling our knowledge 
gaps of OAH, can we as a Nation begin to be 
able to piece together for solutions for our 
coastal communities. 
(2) Projects or programs that promote 
coastal economic and ecosystem resilience 
to OAH. 
Fisheries and aquaculture are central to 
our history, are enjoyed by Americans across 
the nation year-round, and remain key to 
many of Oregon’s coastal economies today. 
Yet, the future sustainability of these ma-
rine resources and communities’ ability to 
rely on them, are uncertain in the face of 
significant ocean changes, including OAH, 
and uncertain in the face of our current 
state of preparation to adapt to those 
changes over time. This is why the Oregon 
OAH Council supports activities and initia-
tives that promote resilience to increased 
OAH conditions, for both human commu-
nities and ecosystems. The COAST Research 
Act also stresses the importance of increas-
ing our understanding of the socioeconomic 
effects of OA by expanding federal research 
to assess adaptation and mitigation strate-
gies. There will be costs of inaction relative 
to CO2 mitigation and the United States has 
an obligation to relieve these costs wherever 
possible for our citizens. 
(3) Tools and strategies to increase aware-
ness of OAH science, impacts and solutions. 
As the impacts of OA intensify, it is going 
to be vitally important for our Nation to 
identify and advance opportunities to raise 
awareness of and communicate OAH science, 
impacts, and mitigation solutions. This is 
why the Oregon OAH Council is encouraged 
by the fact that the COAST Research Act 
recognizes the need to address the effects of 
OA on estuaries and integrate research, mon-
itoring, and adaptation strategies. By inte-
grating OA causes and effects, it better dem-
onstrates the complexity of this climate 
issue, and provides a clearer message to com-
munities. The Oregon OAH Council also sup-
ports the COAST Research Act establish-
ment of an Advisory Board to increase co-
ordination among stakeholders, including 
members of industry, to work with State and 
Federal governments to improve coordina-
tion. Recognizing the importance of a broad 
membership, our Oregon OAH Council in-
cludes members from industry, academia and 
state government agencies. For the benefit 
of our marine ecosystem and the human 
communities that rely on a healthy marine 
ecosystem, the Nation’s adaptation and miti-
gation approaches to OA should include suc-
cessful communication of new science, moni-
toring, and adaptation strategies. 
As Co-Chairs of the Oregon OAH Council, 
we appreciate the opportunity to provide you 
with a letter of strong support for the 
COAST Research Act. The strategic invest-
ment and coordination opportunities out-
lined in this act are meaningful and will 
make a difference in our understanding of 
OAH 
science, 
impacts, 
and 
solutions. 
Through passage of this Act and the subse-
quent investment in science, adaptation and 
communications, the United States will 
demonstrate meaningful action in fighting 
OA and the global challenges of climate 
change, and preparing our citizens and 
economies for the changes ahead. 
Thank you for your consideration of these 
comments.

Hon. SUZANNE BONAMICI, 
House of Representatives,

DEAR
CONGRESSWOMAN
BONAMICI: As the 
Director of the Northwest Association of 
Ocean Observing Systems (NANOOS), I write 
in support of the Coastal and Ocean Acidifi-
cation Stressors and Threats (COAST) Re-
search Act. 
NANOOS provides access to near-real time 
observations, forecasts, and other tools that 
can be used to observe water properties in 
the Salish Sea and the coastal waters off 
Washington and Oregon. NANOOS can only 
serve our stakeholders via NOAA’s Inte-
grated Ocean Observing System (IOOS), 
which links together Federal agencies with 
our collective of local universities, govern-
ment agencies, tribes, nonprofits, and indus-
try organizations who collect quality ocean-
ographic 
and 
meteorological 
data 
from 
moorings, buoys, and satellites from across 
the Pacific Northwest region. But our re-
sources are limited and this COAST Re-
search Act would help to highlight the pay-
off investments can make. 
In the Pacific Northwest, we know that 
ocean acidification is an issue already, as 
witnessed by the difference that monitoring 
water chemistry has made to shellfish grow-
ers. We know that impacts from ocean acidi-
fication may affect shellfish harvesters, fish-
ermen, resource managers, and tribal and 
other coastal communities. NANOOS’ work 
with IOOS and NOAA’s Ocean Acidification 
Program have been instrumental in aiding 
adaptation. 
The COAST Research Act will enhance 
these and other efforts to understand, mon-
itor, and manage the nation’s ability to re-
spond and adapt to ocean acidification. 
NANOOS will be better able to meet the 
needs of our stakeholders if this Act is 
passed. 
My thanks for your leadership and in-
sights. 
Sincerely, 
JAN NEWTON, 
NANOOS Executive Director. 
Ms. BONAMICI. Madam Speaker, I 
reserve the balance of my time.

The Committee on Natural Resources 
takes this action with the mutual under-
standing that, in doing so, we do not waive 
any jurisdiction over the subject matter con-
tained in this or similar legislation, and that 
the Committee will be appropriately con-
sulted and involved as the bill or similar leg-
islation moves forward so that we may ad-
dress any remaining issues within our juris-
diction. Our Committee also reserves the 
right to seek appointment of conferees to 
any House-Senate conference involving this 
or similar legislation. 
Thank you for agreeing to include our ex-
change of letters in the Congressional Record. 
I appreciate your cooperation regarding this

DEAR CHAIRMAN GRIJALVA: I am writing to 
you concerning H.R. 1447, the ‘‘Coastal and 
Ocean Acidification Stressors and Threats 
Research Act of 2021,’’ which was referred to 
the Committee on Science, Space, and Tech-

will waive further consideration of H.R. 1447 
and that this action is not a waiver of future 
jurisdictional claims by the Committee on 
Natural Resources over this subject matter. 
I will make sure to include our exchange of 
letters in the Congressional Record and will 
support the appointment of the Committee 
on Natural Resources conferees during any 
House-Senate conference. Thank you for 
your cooperation on this legislation.

Mr. LUCAS. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in support of 
H.R. 1447, the COAST Research Act of 
2021. This bipartisan legislation would 
reauthorize and modernize the Federal 
Government’s ocean acidification re-
search and monitoring programs. 
Ocean acidification is the result of a 
gradual decrease in pH in the ocean 
chemistry. Even a small shift in pH can 
have a serious effect on marine eco-
systems, including shellfish habitat, 
coral reefs, and fisheries habitat.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H2384 
May 17, 2021 
Congress recognized the need for a 
better understanding of the causes and 
effects 
of 
ocean 
acidification 
and 
passed the Federal Ocean Acidification 
Research and Monitoring Act in 2009. 
That legislation created a framework 
for science agencies such as NOAA and 
the National Science Foundation to 
dedicate resources to studying the phe-
nomenon. As a result, we made signifi-
cant advancements in understanding 
ocean acidification over the last dec-
ade. 
H.R. 1447 reauthorizes the funding for 
NOAA and NSF efforts through the fis-
cal year 2026, which lapsed in fiscal 
year 2012. It also modernizes their ac-
tivities by updating the strategic plan 
governing the Federal Government’s 
research efforts and strengthening co-
operation among scientific agencies. 
Additionally, the COAST Research 
Act designates NOAA as the lead agen-
cy for coordinating the Federal re-
sponse to ocean and coastal acidifica-
tion. This is an important step to 
streamline and organize efforts across 
the government. 
Finally, this bill ensures that the 
voices of stakeholders and industry 
from 
multiple 
regions 
are 
heard 
through a newly established advisory 
board. This input is critical to effec-
tively integrate the many research, 
monitoring, and adaptation strategies 
for coastal acidification. 
This bill is the result of years of 
work in building a consensus among 
stakeholders, 
including 
ocean 
con-
servation 
groups, 
sportsmen, 
and 
coastal communities about how best to 
address this problem moving forward. 
Coastal communities and businesses 
will greatly benefit from this legisla-
tion and how better knowledge of 
ocean acidification improves our abil-
ity to respond to its effects. 
I thank Ms. BONAMICI for introducing 
and leading this bill along with her 
House Oceans Caucus vice chair, Con-
gressman DON YOUNG, along with the 
many bipartisan cosponsors. 
I urge my colleagues to support this 
bill, and I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Ms. BONAMICI. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
such time as she may consume to the 
gentlewoman from Maine (Ms. PIN-
GREE), a cosponsor of the COAST Re-
search Act. 
Ms. PINGREE. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the chair and the ranking member, who 
have shown a true willingness to ad-
dress the impact climate change has 
had on our oceans; and to Congress-
woman 
BONAMICI
and 
Congressman 
YOUNG for their leadership on ocean 
and climate issues. 
I rise today in support of the gentle-
woman’s bill, H.R. 1447, the Coastal and 
Ocean 
Acidification 
Stressors 
and 
Threats Research Act, a bipartisan bill 
that would expand scientific research 
and monitoring to improve our under-
standing of ocean acidification. 
Our oceans absorb enormous amounts 
of carbon dioxide each year. That proc-
ess 
is 
critical 
for 
regulating 
the 
amount of greenhouse gases in our at-
mosphere, but this comes at a high 
cost for oceans and dependent marine 
life. 
Coastal communities produce about 
40 percent of our Nation’s total jobs 
and 45 percent of our gross domestic 
product. Given those significant num-
bers, the financial implications will 
ripple across all American commu-
nities if this problem continues to in-
tensify. 
We are already experiencing these 
impacts in my home State of Maine. 
The Gulf of Maine is warming faster 
than 99 percent of the world’s oceans, 
and it is particularly susceptible to the 
effects of ocean acidification. 
As you know, Mr. Speaker, my State 
is renowned for its lobster and shell-
fish, so you can imagine we take this 
threat seriously. Bill Mook, an oyster 
farmer on Maine’s Damariscotta River, 
has explained to me how he has ad-
justed his operations to mitigate for 
ocean acidification. Bill and so many 
growers are worried about how future 
oyster production will be affected when 
the problem outpaces the adaptations 
that can be made. 
I support the COAST Research Act 
because it would strengthen invest-
ments in ocean acidification research 
and monitoring, increase our under-
standing of the socioeconomic effects 
of ocean acidification, and more. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
join me in supporting H.R. 1447. It is 
critical that we act to protect our 
oceans and our coastal communities so 
they are here for future generations. 
Mr. LUCAS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
such time as he may consume to the 
gentleman from Alaska (Mr. YOUNG), 
one of the most outstanding individ-
uals in this body; the dean of the House 
Republican Conference; the dean of the 
United States House; but, most impor-
tantly, and fortunately for his con-
stituents, the dean of the Alaska con-
gressional delegation. 
Mr. YOUNG. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
my good friend Mr. LUCAS for his kind 
compliments. It is the best I have 
heard all day. 
I thank Ms. BONAMICI, the chair of 
this committee, for bringing this bill 
to the floor. 
I am excited about it because the 
oceans and our waterways are impor-
tant to our lives. More than anybody 
recognizes, water is the next big issue. 
Oceans do cover 76 percent of our globe. 
In doing so, if they get acidified, then 
we lose the oceans, not only what it 
provides to us, but livelihoods to many 
fishermen in my communities, which is 
very, very important. 
I am, very frankly, very excited 
about this legislation. We have to do 
more than legislation, though, because 
the acidification of the ocean, what 
causes it, we have to address. Some say 
it is climate change. Let’s do that. 
Let’s look at why. 
I have just been reading a very seri-
ous set of articles on e-fuels, which I 
was unaware were created by capturing 
CO2 and making it into another fuel 
which is cleaner, especially for mari-
time fleets. I am a mariner, and that 
would be very, very important because 
they are one of the more pollutant fac-
tors we have, yet they transport world 
goods. So we have to address that. 
As we pass this legislation, let’s real-
ly go forth and make sure not only 
NOAA has the authority, but make 
sure they do the job. That is oversight. 
That is your job, Madam Chairman. 
That is what we have to do to make 
sure it is done and address the problem. 
You talk about your lobster. It is 
good, but not quite as good as our 
salmon, but it is okay. We have to 
work on that to make sure that we 
have a continued sustainable yield that 
we will be working with. 
Mr. LUCAS. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self the balance of my time. 
Mr. Speaker, I again rise to support 
H.R. 1447, the COAST Research Act of 
2021. It is necessary, bipartisan legisla-
tion with support from Members rep-
resenting a diverse range of districts. 
As I previously mentioned, signifi-
cant 
progress 
toward 
our 
under-
standing the socioeconomic effects of 
ocean and coastal acidification has 
been made in the last decade. But to 
continue that progress, we need to up-
date our priorities and our strategies. 
That is what this bill does. That is 
what will keep our communities, our 
businesses, and our entire economy at 
the forefront of managing and miti-
gating the environmental challenges 
we face. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support this bill, and I yield back the 
balance of my time. 
Ms. BONAMICI. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself the balance of my time. 
The basic chemistry of our ocean is 
changing at an unprecedented rate. We 
know that even if carbon dioxide emis-
sions were halted today, many of the 
residual effects on our oceans will con-
tinue to occur over the course of the 
next few decades. 
Without intervention, ocean acidifi-
cation is projected to become more in-
tense and increasingly common, espe-
cially on the Pacific Coast. We must 
support vulnerable communities, in-
dustries, coastal and ocean managers 
by strengthening research on how they 
can best prepare for and, when possible, 
adapt to ocean and coastal acidifica-
tion. 
By passing the bipartisan COAST Re-
search Act, we are taking one impor-
tant step forward in advancing ocean 
climate action. 
I, again, thank Chairwoman JOHNSON; 
Ranking Member LUCAS; and my co- 
leads 
on 
this 
bill, 
Representative 
YOUNG, PINGREE, and POSEY for their 
support. 
I know Mr. YOUNG
from Alaska 
talked about his salmon. We would 
compete with salmon in the Pacific 
Northwest. We also have the prize dun-
geness crab, and Ms. PINGREE has her 
lobsters. It is so critical for these in-
dustries that we pass this bill and ad-
vance ocean climate action.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H2385 
May 17, 2021 
I, once again, urge my colleagues on 
both sides of the aisle to support this 
bipartisan bill. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
Mr. POSEY. Mr. Speaker, I’m proud to join 
Congresswoman BONAMICI as an original co-
sponsor. 
For those of us who live on the ‘‘coast,’’ the 
coast is that unique place where our lives, our 
environment, and our economy participate in a 
special relationship with the ocean. 
In my own State of Florida, we know that 
about 6 million people work in our coastal 
counties. They earn nearly $280 billion dollars 
in wages and produce close to $700 billion in 
gross domestic product. 
Life on the coast is rich in rewards, but also 
uncertain and often perilous. 
Those of us who live on the coast have 
known for a long time how important sustain-
ability and resilience are for our coasts. We 
have weathered the storms of the past and we 
must do so in the future. 
Science and research are our best hope for 
continuing to live in harmony with our coasts. 
Research can prepare us for assaults on 
our coasts and help us defend our wildlife and 
biodiversity from threats like acidification. 
We must take care of our precious coasts 
so that we can continue to enjoy the lifestyle 
and the economic well-being we cherish. 
That is why I’ve joined Congresswoman SU-
ZANNE BONAMICI in directing NOAA to pick up 
the role of leading research for coastal acidifi-
cation. 
I ask my colleagues to support the COAST 
Research Act. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. 
CUELLAR). The question is on the mo-
tion offered by the gentlewoman from 
Oregon (Ms. BONAMICI) that the House 
suspend the rules and pass the bill, 
H.R. 1447, as amended. 
The question was taken. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the 
opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being 
in the affirmative, the ayes have it. 
Mr. ROSENDALE. Mr. Speaker, on 
that I demand the yeas and nays. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to section 3(s) of House Resolution

to suspend the rules and pass the bill 
(H.R. 2533) to provide for a study by the 
National Academies of Sciences, Engi-
neering, and Medicine examining the 
impact of ocean acidification and other 
stressors in estuarine environments. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 2533 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘National Es-
tuaries and Acidification Research Act of 
2021’’ or the ‘‘NEAR Act of 2021’’. 
SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
Congress finds the following: 
(1) Ocean acidification impacts human 
health, natural resources, and the environ-
mental, economic, and recreational uses of 
the coastline. 
(2) The current understanding of ocean 
acidification 
impacts 
on 
estuarine 
eco-
systems is inadequate to fully prepare and 
manage for changing environmental condi-
tions in nearshore locations. 
(3) While pH can be measured with high 
precision and accuracy in open ocean envi-
ronments, more understanding of the car-
bonate system in estuarine ecosystems is 
needed for precise and accurate measure-
ments and observations. 
(4) The interaction of multiple stressors, 
including salinity, pH, temperature, sea 
level rise, and nutrient input, within estua-
rine ecosystems is inadequately understood 
for managing the health, economic, rec-
reational, and environmental impacts driven 
by these interactions. 
(5) A better understanding is needed of how 
anthropogenic influences in coastal environ-
ments affect estuarine ecosystems. 
(6) More integration and coordination is 
needed among regional, national, and global 
environmental observations in estuarine en-
vironments, supporting prior investments in 
related topics such as nutrient loading, hy-
poxia, ocean acidification, and harmful algae 
bloom research and observational systems. 
SEC. 3. STUDY EXAMINING THE IMPACT OF 
OCEAN ACIDIFICATION AND OTHER 
ENVIRONMENTAL 
STRESSORS 
ON 
ESTUARINE ENVIRONMENTS. 
(a) IN GENERAL.—Not later than 60 days 
after the date of enactment of this Act, the 
Secretary of Commerce shall make appro-
priate arrangements with the National Acad-
emies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine 
(referred to in this Act as the ‘‘National 
Academies’’) under which the National Acad-
emies shall conduct a study that— 
(1) examines the existing science of ocean 
acidification in estuarine environments; 
(2) examines the challenges to studying 
ocean acidification and ocean acidification’s 
interactions 
with 
other 
environment 
stressors in estuarine environments; 
(3) provides recommendations for improv-
ing future research with respect to ocean 
acidification in estuarine environments; and 
(4) identifies pathways for applying science 
in management and mitigation decisions re-
lating to ocean acidification in estuarine en-
vironments. 
(b) CONTENTS
OF STUDY.—The study de-
scribed under subsection (a) shall include— 
(1) the behavior of the carbonate system 
within estuarine environments; 
(2) the interactions of the carbonate sys-
tem with other biotic and abiotic character-
istics of estuarine ecosystems; 
(3) how environmental and anthropogenic 
changes or disturbances could affect abiotic 
and biotic processes within estuaries; 
(4) how estuarine biotic and abiotic proc-
esses will be affected under predicted envi-
ronmental changes; 
(5) the current state of data collection, in-
terpretation, storage, and retrieval and ob-
servational infrastructure of abiotic and bi-
otic parameters in estuarine ecosystems; 
(6) the gaps that exist in understanding the 
socio-economic and health impacts of ocean 
acidification in estuaries; 
(7) future directions for scientific research; 
and 
(8) pathways for applying science in man-
agement and mitigation decisions. 
(c) REPORT.—In entering into an arrange-
ment under subsection (a), the Secretary 
shall request that the National Academies 
transmit to Congress a report on the results 
of the study not later than 24 months after 
the date of enactment of this Act. 
(d) AUTHORIZATION
OF
APPROPRIATIONS.— 
There are authorized to be appropriated to 
carry out this section $1,000,000. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentlewoman from 
Oregon (Ms. BONAMICI) and the gen-
tleman from Oklahoma (Mr. LUCAS) 
each will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from Oregon. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Ms. BONAMICI. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days to revise 
and extend their remarks and to in-
clude extraneous material on H.R. 2533, 
the bill now under consideration. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from Oregon? 
There was no objection. 
Ms. BONAMICI. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support 
of Congressman POSEY’s National Estu-
aries and Acidification Research Act. I 
am an original cosponsor of this bipar-
tisan bill, which would direct the Na-
tional Academies of Sciences, Engi-
neering, and Medicine to conduct a 
study that examines the science of 
ocean and coastal acidification in estu-
aries and provide recommendations to 
improve future research and manage-
ment to inform mitigation decisions. 
As co-chair of both the House Oceans 
Caucus and Congressional Estuary Cau-
cus, I know that acidification is not 
only affecting the open ocean, estu-
aries and nearshore waters are also ab-
sorbing tremendous amounts of carbon 
pollution and becoming more acidic. 
Our understanding of ocean acidifica-
tion and its interactions with other en-
vironmental stressors, such as hypoxia, 
harmful algal blooms, and warming 
waters, is rapidly evolving, but is still 
limited in scope. 
Ocean and coastal acidification are 
often present in the context of other 
coastal processes, like runoff, erosion, 
and upwelled water from the oceans, 
making it difficult to measure its indi-
vidual effects on estuaries. 
Our estuaries and nearshore waters 
are also experiencing the consequences 
of our inaction to address the climate 
crisis, and research has not kept pace 
with the needs of coastal communities. 
The NEAR Act will help address sig-
nificant research gaps and the urgent 
need to improve our understanding of 
the ecological and socioeconomic ef-
fects of ocean and coastal acidification. 
I thank Congressman POSEY for his 
leadership on this bipartisan bill and 
his efforts to preserve our Nation’s es-
tuaries. I also thank Chairwoman 
JOHNSON and Ranking Member LUCAS 
for making this bill a priority. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support it, and I reserve the balance of 
my time.

Sincerely, 
RAU´ L M. GRIJALVA, 
Chair, 
House Natural Resources Committee. 
Mr. LUCAS. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 
2533, the National Estuaries and Acidi-
fication Research Act of 2021, a bipar-
tisan bill sponsored by Congressman 
BILL POSEY, my esteemed colleague on 
the Science Committee. 
This legislation directs the Secretary 
of Commerce to coordinate a study 
with 
the 
National 
Academies 
of 
Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine to 
examine the effects of ocean acidifica-
tion on estuary environments, and to 
submit that report to Congress within 2 
years. 
b 1615 
Specifically, this study will be led by 
the Ocean Studies Board of the Na-
tional Academies and provide Congress 
a better understanding of the biologi-
cal and economic impacts of ocean 
acidification on inland marine environ-
ments. 
Estuaries are economically impor-
tant water ecosystems that occur when 
inland rivers meet oceans. This mix of 
fresh and salt waters is a delicate bal-
ance of nature that possesses unique 
biological 
characteristics. 
To 
date, 
there have been few studies on the ef-
fects ocean acidification has on these 
ecosystems. 
We can’t manage and mitigate the ef-
fects of something we don’t fully un-
derstand. That is why H.R. 2533 is still 
needed today to bridge our knowledge 
gaps by utilizing the best expertise and 
resources to gain a better under-
standing of this important issue. 
While Oklahoma is a landlocked 
State without estuaries, I recognize 
the economic and environmental ef-
fects acidification has on all of our Na-
tion’s waterways and other natural 
treasures. The waters of Oklahoma’s 
rivers, streams, and tributaries feed 
into larger systems and eventually 
make it to the ocean. At the end of the 
day, being a conservationist doesn’t 
stop at geographic barriers. It is a na-
tionwide effort. 
Mr. Speaker, this important word- 
for-word bill passed the House last Con-
gress with the same bipartisan support 
it has here today. Unfortunately, it 
didn’t move further in the Senate. So, 
1 year later, we still need to improve 
our knowledge of coastal acidification 
and estuaries. 
I thank Mr. POSEY for leading this 
important legislation. I know his con-
stituents and the Indian River Lagoon 
community appreciate his efforts to 
protect their surrounding environment. 
I also thank my Science Committee 
colleague 
across 
the 
aisle, 
Ms. 
BONAMICI, for leading the effort on the 
majority side. 
Mr. Speaker, as the saying goes, 
knowledge is power. This simple bipar-
tisan bill advances our knowledge and 
gives us the power to quantify the ef-
fects estuary communities face when 
faced with coastal acidification. 
The National Academies are a tre-
mendous resource. Their studies are 
thorough, informative, and world class. 
I look forward to seeing the final prod-
uct directed by this bill. 
By preserving our Nation’s estuaries, 
we are saving businesses from closing, 
ecosystems from dying, and people 
from getting sick. I, again, thank Rep-
resentative BILL POSEY and the entire 
Congressional Estuary Caucus for lead-
ing on this important topic. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support this bill, and I yield back the 
balance of my time. 
Ms. BONAMICI. Mr. Speaker, this is 
a commonsense bill to address the ur-
gent need for research on ocean and 
coastal acidification in estuaries. 
I appreciate the partnership and lead-
ership 
from 
Chairwoman 
JOHNSON, 
Ranking Member LUCAS, and Congress-
man POSEY to protect the health of our 
oceans and estuaries. 
Mr. Speaker, I once again urge my 
colleagues on both sides of the aisle to 
support this bipartisan bill, and I yield 
back the balance of my time. 
Mr. POSEY. Mr. Speaker, I’m pleased to 
rise in support of H.R. 2533, The National Es-
tuaries and Acidification Research (NEAR) 
Act. 
I want to thank Congresswoman SUZANNE 
BONAMICI and Congressman BRIAN MAST for 
working with me to advance this important leg-
islation. 
I also want to thank the National Academies 
of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine for 
their valuable input. 
The NEAR Act is a national proposal with a 
very special personal connection. People in 
my district—the 8th district of Florida—under-
stand in a very deep way, the economic and 
environmental importance of the ocean and 
our estuary—the Indian River Lagoon. 
This bill focuses on estuaries—those won-
drous nurseries and homes for sea life. 
Unfortunately, the Indian River Lagoon, and 
other valuable estuaries throughout the coun-
try, are being threatened by ocean acidifica-
tion, along with other stressors. 
Scientists tell us that when carbon dioxide is 
released into the atmosphere, about one third 
of that carbon dioxide is absorbed by sea-
water, creating carbonic acid. 
Shellfish and other marine organisms don’t 
do well in acidic waters. We know that. 
We have over a decade of research on the 
impacts of acidification in the open ocean. Un-
fortunately, we don’t have the same kind of 
knowledge about acidification in estuaries and 
waters near our shores. 
We need to deepen our investment in re-
search in our estuaries so we can protect and 
restore our estuaries and defend our environ-
ment and coastal economy. 
The story of my district and the Indian River 
Lagoon plays out along our entire national 
coastline. More than half of the U.S. popu-
lation lives in coastal areas. 
Five years ago, Congresswoman BONAMICI 
and I cofounded the bipartisan Congressional 
Estuary Caucus to preserve and restore our 
estuaries. Coastal watershed counties provide 
an estimated 69 million U.S. jobs and con-
tribute an estimated $7.9 trillion to the GDP 
annually. 
The National Academy study authorized by 
the NEAR Act is a great step toward filling in 
the gaps in our knowledge of how acidification 
affects our estuaries—both environmentally 
and economically. 
Mr. Speaker, when we take care of our en-
vironment, we take care of ourselves, and 
therefore, I ask my colleagues to join me in 
taking this important step toward under-
standing how ocean acidification affects our 
precious estuaries and support this bill today. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentlewoman from Oregon (Ms. 
BONAMICI) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 2533.

RURAL STEM EDUCATION 
RESEARCH ACT 
Ms. BONAMICI. Mr. Speaker, I move 
to suspend the rules and pass the bill 
(H.R. 210) to coordinate Federal re-
search and development efforts focused 
on STEM education and workforce de-
velopment in rural areas, including the 
development and application of new 
technologies to support and improve 
rural STEM education, and for other 
purposes, as amended. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 210 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Rural STEM 
Education Research Act’’. 
SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
Congress finds the following: 
(1) The supply of STEM workers is not 
keeping pace with the rapidly evolving needs 
of the public and private sector, resulting in 
a deficit often referred to as a STEM skills 
shortage. 
(2) According to the Bureau of Labor Sta-
tistics, the United States will need one mil-
lion additional STEM professionals than it is 
on track to produce in the coming decade. 
(3) Many STEM occupations offer higher 
wages, more opportunities for advancement, 
and a higher degree of job security than non- 
STEM jobs. 
(4) The 60,000,000 individuals in the United 
States who live in rural settings are signifi-
cantly under-represented in STEM. 
(5) According to the National Center for 
Education Statistics, nine million students 
in the United States—nearly 20 percent of 
the total K–12 population—attend rural 
schools, and for reasons ranging from teach-
er quality to shortages of resources, these 
students often have fewer opportunities for 
high-quality STEM learning than their peers 
in the Nation’s urban and suburban schools. 
(6) Rural areas represent one of the most 
promising, yet underutilized, opportunities 
for STEM education to impact workforce de-
velopment and regional innovation, includ-
ing agriculture. 
(7) The study of agriculture, food, and nat-
ural resources involves biology, engineering, 
physics, chemistry, math, geology, computer 
science, and other scientific fields. 
(8) Employment in computer and informa-
tion technology occupations is projected to 
grow 11 percent from 2019 to 2029. To help 
meet this demand, it is important rural stu-
dents have the opportunity to acquire com-
puting skills through exposure to computer 
science learning in grades Pre-K through 12 
and in informal learning settings. 
(9) More than 293,000,000 individuals in the 
United States use high-speed broadband to 
work, learn, access healthcare, and operate 
their businesses, while 19,000,000 individuals 
in the United States still lack access to 
high-speed broadband. Rural areas are hard-
est hit, with over 26 percent of individuals in 
rural areas in the United States lacking ac-
cess to high-speed broadband compared to 1.7 
percent of individuals in urban areas in the 
United States. 
SEC. 3. NIST ENGAGEMENT WITH RURAL COMMU-
NITIES. 
(a) MEP OUTREACH.—Section 25 of the Na-
tional Institute of Standards and Technology 
Act (15 U.S.C. 278k) is amended—

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentlewoman from 
Oregon (Ms. BONAMICI) and the gen-
tleman from Oklahoma (Mr. LUCAS) 
each will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from Oregon. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Ms. BONAMICI. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days to revise 
and extend their remarks and to in-
clude extraneous material on H.R. 210, 
the bill now under consideration. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from Oregon? 
There was no objection. 
Ms. BONAMICI. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 
210, the Rural STEM Education Re-
search Act. I thank Ranking Member 
LUCAS for introducing this important 
bill. 
Every State in the country is filled 
with students who have an incredible 
curiosity for STEM and the potential 
to make important contributions in 
these fields. But too often, students are 
left behind and are unable to fulfill 
their vast potential simply because of 
where they live. 
Students in rural areas have long 
faced obstacles to receiving a high- 
quality 
STEM 
education. 
Lack 
of 
broadband access, for example, has 
long been a barrier. 
Schools in rural communities often 
struggle to access the equipment and 
facilities needed to provide students 
with hands-on STEM experiences. Re-
search shows that hands-on experiences 
help inspire scientific curiosity and a 
love of STEM in students. 
Teachers are trying their best, but 
they have limited resources and sup-
port. To make matters worse, the 
COVID–19 pandemic and the transition 
to remote learning have further exacer-
bated these inequalities. 
Students and teachers in rural com-
munities have worked hard to adapt, 
but they need help. We have an oppor-
tunity not just to recover from what 
was lost during the pandemic but to 
ensure a better STEM education future 
for rural students. 
The Rural STEM Education Act pro-
vides for research and development to 
increase access to STEM education op-
portunities in rural schools and to pro-
vide teachers with the resources they 
need to teach more effectively. 
The bill also directs NIST to develop 
a prize competition to advance re-
search and development in support of 
expanded broadband access. 
This bill further provides for assess-
ments of Federal investments in rural 
STEM education to be conducted by 
the National Academies and the Gov-
ernment Accountability Office. 
This bill is an important step toward 
improving STEM education in rural 
communities across America and will 
help build a 21st century STEM work-
force that will help the U.S. remain a 
global leader in science and tech-
nology. 
Mr. Speaker, I strongly urge my col-
leagues to support H.R. 210, and I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. LUCAS. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support 
of H.R. 210, the Rural STEM Education 
Research Act, a bill that passed this 
House with resounding bipartisan sup-
port in the 116th Congress, and I hope 
it will do so again today. 
I am pleased to be leading this impor-
tant bill, and I thank Chairwoman 
JOHNSON for her support. 
Now more than ever, America’s pros-
perity and security depend on an effec-
tive and inclusive science, technology, 
engineering, 
math, 
and 
computer 
science workforce, or STEM. 
Nationally, 80 percent of the fastest- 
growing occupations depend upon mas-
tery of STEM skills, and the number of 
STEM jobs is growing three times fast-
er than non-STEM jobs. Over the next 
decade, the STEM shortage is antici-
pated to reach 1 million positions, ac-
cording to the Bureau of Labor Statis-
tics. 
To succeed in this job market, our 
students need to be equipped with solid 
skills in science and engineering. Meet-
ing this demand starts in the class-
room. 
Over 9 million students in the United 
States, nearly 20 percent of the total 
K–12 population, attend rural schools. 
In Oklahoma, that number is even 
higher; one-third of our students at-
tend rural schools. 
These students face a number of bar-
riers to accessing high-quality STEM 
learning, 
including 
a 
shortage 
of 
trained science and math teachers, a 
lack of access to advanced STEM 
courses, and few local university and 
industry partners. 
Since the start of the coronavirus 
pandemic, we have seen further proof 
that rural students are at a disadvan-
tage, given the unreliability or non-
existent broadband access many strug-
gle with while distance learning. 
The Rural STEM Education Research 
Act supports research and development 
activities 
to 
improve 
our 
under-
standing of the challenges rural com-
munities are facing, and it takes steps 
to address those challenges in pro-
viding and sustaining quality STEM 
education programs.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H2390 
May 17, 2021 
H.R. 210 helps develop better prac-
tices for accessing and using computer- 
based and online STEM education 
courses. It will help schools combine 
online STEM education with hands-on 
training and apprenticeships to give 
students both theoretical and practical 
understanding of math and science 
skills. 
The bill will also take steps to ad-
dress one of the key obstacles to rural 
STEM education, a lack of broadband 
access. Of the 21 million Americans 
who lack access to broadband, the ma-
jority live in rural areas. With the in-
crease in online learning, we need to 
prioritize connectivity for all students. 
This bill directs the National Insti-
tute of Standards and Technology to 
establish a prize competition to stimu-
late innovations in technologies to de-
ploy broadband connectivity to under-
served rural communities. 
It also establishes a working group to 
set key research priorities for improv-
ing broadband access so rural commu-
nities can enjoy the same connected-
ness as the rest of the country. 
This bill includes a number of provi-
sions to help provide rural educators 
with the tools they need to be success-
ful, both in the classroom and online. 
It supports opportunities for rural edu-
cators to enhance their own STEM edu-
cation, such as training in computer 
science or research opportunities at 
Federal labs and universities. These ex-
periences will provide rural educators 
with high-quality STEM skills they 
can take back to the classrooms and 
pass on to their students. 
Lastly, the major focus of this bill is 
broadening the participation of rural 
students in STEM. One way we can do 
this is by emphasizing place-based 
learning, which gives students direct 
access to the STEM knowledge present 
in their communities and local envi-
ronment. 
Place-based learning connects stu-
dents to the science that is right out-
side their doors, whether it is studying 
animal science with FFA, learning 
about local ecosystems out on the prai-
ries and in forests, or developing the 
technological skills required to operate 
increasingly complex and computerized 
farm equipment. That direct experi-
ence engages students and helps them 
understand that STEM skills matter to 
everyone, not just scientists in a white 
lab coat. 
Taken together, the measures in this 
bill will make great strides to improve 
rural STEM education. I believe rural 
areas represent one of the greatest, yet 
most underutilized, opportunities for 
talented 
students 
to 
enhance 
the 
United States’ future STEM workforce. 
I am pleased that this bill has been 
endorsed by a number of stakeholder 
groups: STEM Education Coalition, 
Afterschool 
Alliance, 
Battelle 
and 
STEM-X, National Science Teaching 
Association, American Association of 
Colleges for Teacher Education, Amer-
ican Chemical Society, American Geo-
physical Union, Human Factors and 
Ergonomics Society, Association of 
American Universities, Microsoft, Girl 
Scouts of the USA, National FFA Orga-
nization, and Association of Public and 
Land-grant Universities. 
I again thank Chairwoman JOHNSON 
and her staff for working with me on 
this bill. 
Mr. Speaker, I strongly encourage 
my colleagues to vote ‘‘yes’’ to better 
STEM education for America’s rural 
students, and I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Ms. BONAMICI. Mr. Speaker, as a 
member of the Science, Space, and 
Technology Committee and the Com-
mittee on Education and Labor, I want 
to thank Mr. LUCAS for mentioning not 
only broadband but also place-based 
learning. I represent several rural 
school districts, and I appreciate this 
legislation. 
Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. LUCAS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 
minutes to the gentleman from Michi-
gan (Mr. MEIJER). 
Mr. MEIJER. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today in support of H.R. 210, the Rural 
STEM Education Research Act. 
More than 9 million students in the 
U.S., nearly 20 percent of the K–12 pop-
ulation, attend rural schools. For rea-
sons ranging from teacher quality to 
shortages of resources, these students 
often have fewer opportunities for 
high-quality STEM learning than their 
peers in urban and suburban schools. 
Rural areas, including those in the 
Third District of Michigan, represent 
one of the greatest, yet underutilized, 
chances for STEM education to impact 
the workforce. It is especially impor-
tant that we correct this in the wake 
of the coronavirus pandemic when we 
are facing serious research and devel-
opment labor market shortages. 
H.R. 210 would increase STEM edu-
cation opportunities for rural commu-
nities, ensuring the option to learn is 
not dependent on your ZIP Code. I urge 
my colleagues to join me in supporting 
this bill. 
Ms. BONAMICI. Mr. Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. LUCAS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 11⁄2 
minutes to the gentleman from Iowa 
(Mr. FEENSTRA). 
Mr. FEENSTRA. Mr. Speaker, in this 
era of scientific and technological in-
novation, it has never been more im-
portant to ensure our students have ac-
cess to quality STEM education pro-
grams, especially in rural commu-
nities. 
Implementing 
high-speed, 
reliable 
broadband goes hand in hand with this 
goal. 
This is why I urge my colleagues to 
support the Rural STEM Education Re-
search Act. Both STEM education and 
quality broadband access are critical to 
the future success and revitalization of 
rural America. 
b 1630 
I am hopeful that this legislation will 
break down barriers rural Iowans face 
in receiving STEM education that is 
both forward-thinking and long-lasting 
for our rural communities. This bill 
will also help us identify the techno-
logical and logistical challenges we 
still 
must 
overcome 
to 
provide 
broadband to every last acre of land. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman 
from 
Oklahoma, 
Ranking 
Member 
LUCAS, for this outstanding bill and 
important piece of legislation. 
Ms. BONAMICI. Madam Speaker, I 
reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. LUCAS. Mr. Speaker, I am pre-
pared to close, and I yield myself such 
time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I, once again, thank 
Chairwoman JOHNSON for her support 
of this legislation. Whether you live in 
Dallas, Texas, or Cheyenne, Oklahoma, 
every student should have the oppor-
tunity to gain STEM skills and to com-
pete for the jobs of the future. 
The Rural STEM Education Research 
Act gives teachers better tools to teach 
science and math, leverages local re-
sources to engage students in key sub-
jects, 
and 
addresses 
the 
lack 
of 
broadband access in rural commu-
nities. 
This 
important 
legislation 
passed the House with strong bipar-
tisan support last Congress. I hope it 
will do so again today. 
Mr. Speaker, I encourage my col-
leagues to support this bill today, and 
I yield back the balance of my time. 
Ms. BONAMICI. Mr. Speaker, I once 
again thank Ranking Member LUCAS 
for his work on this legislation. I 
thank Chairwoman JOHNSON for sup-
porting it, and I urge its adoption. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentlewoman from Oregon (Ms. 
BONAMICI) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 210, as 
amended. 
The question was taken. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the 
opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being 
in the affirmative, the ayes have it. 
Mr. ROSENDALE. Mr. Speaker, on 
that I demand the yeas and nays. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to section 3(s) of House Resolution 
8, the yeas and nays are ordered. 
Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, fur-
ther proceedings on this motion are 
postponed.

May 17, 2021 
SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
Congress finds the following: 
(1) The Nation’s universities and industrial 
research labs are facing unprecedented budg-
et pressure as part of the COVID–19 health 
crisis, resulting in considerably fewer open-
ings for research and teaching positions. 
(2) Emergency funding is needed to fore-
stall the loss of research talent likely to 
occur if early-career researchers are forced 
to seek employment outside of research due 
to the sharp economic decline caused by the 
COVID–19 health crisis. 
(3) The future of America’s defense will 
rely on advanced technologies to maintain 
its military superiority over its rivals, in-
cluding China. These technologies will re-
quire new levels of scientific and engineering 
aptitude and understanding. Early career re-
searchers will play a critical role in the de-
velopment of these technologies, and the loss 
of an entire generation of researchers due to 
the COVID–19 pandemic will be detrimental 
to the United States national security. 
SEC. 3. EARLY-CAREER RESEARCH FELLOWSHIP 
PROGRAM. 
(a) IN GENERAL.—The Director of the Na-
tional Science Foundation may establish a 2- 
year pilot program to award grants to highly 
qualified early-career investigators to carry 
out an independent research program at the 
qualified institution of higher education cho-
sen by such investigator, to last for a period 
not greater than 2 years. 
(b) SELECTION PROCESS.—The Director of 
the National Science Foundation shall select 
grantees under subsection (a) from among 
citizens, nationals, and lawfully admitted 
permanent resident aliens of the United 
States. 
(c) OUTREACH.—The Director shall conduct 
program outreach to recruit fellowship ap-
plicants— 
(1) from all regions of the country; 
(2) from historically underrepresented pop-
ulations in the fields of science, technology, 
engineering, and mathematics; and 
(3) who graduate from or intend to carry 
out research at a variety of types of institu-
tions of higher education, including— 
(A) Historically Black Colleges and Univer-
sities; 
(B) Hispanic-Serving Institutions; 
(C) Tribal Colleges and Universities; and 
(D) institutions of higher education that 
are not among the top 50 institutions in an-
nual Federal funding for research. 
(d) SPECIAL CONSIDERATION.—The Director 
shall give special consideration to an appli-
cation from an individual who graduated 
from or is intending to carry out research at 
an institution of the type listed in sub-
section (c)(3). 
(e) REPORT.—Not later than 90 days after 
the conclusion of the second year of the pilot 
program, the Director shall submit a report 
to Congress that includes— 
(1) statistical summary data on fellowship 
awardees disaggregated by race, ethnicity, 
gender, age, years since completion of doc-
toral degree, and institution type; 
(2) an assessment, drawing on feedback 
from the research community and other 
sources of information, of the effectiveness 
of the pilot program for mitigating the loss 
of research talent due to the pandemic; and 
(3) if determined effective, a plan for per-
manent implementation of the pilot pro-
gram. 
(f) QUALIFIED INSTITUTION OF HIGHER EDU-
CATION DEFINED.—The term ‘‘qualified insti-
tution of higher education’’ has the meaning 
given the term in section 102 of the Higher 
Education of Act of 1965, except that such 
term does not include an institution de-
scribed in subsection (a)(1)(C) of such sec-
tion. 
SEC. 4. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS. 
There is authorized to be appropriated to 
the Director of the National Science Founda-
tion $250,000,000 for each of fiscal years 2021 
through 2022 to carry out the activities in 
this Act. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentlewoman from 
Oregon (Ms. BONAMICI) and the gen-
tleman from Oklahoma (Mr. LUCAS) 
each will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from Oregon. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Ms. BONAMICI. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days to revise 
and extend their remarks and to in-
clude extraneous material on H.R. 144, 
the bill now under consideration. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from Oregon? 
There was no objection. 
Ms. BONAMICI. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 
144, the Supporting Early-Career Re-
searchers Act. I commend Committee 
on Science, Space, and Technology 
Chairwoman 
JOHNSON
and 
Ranking 
Member LUCAS
for introducing this 
bill, which I am pleased to cosponsor. 
The COVID–19 pandemic has affected 
all aspects of our lives, and the U.S. re-
search enterprise has not been spared. 
As 
research 
labs 
and 
universities 
around the country took action to 
mitigate the spread of the virus in 
their labs and on their campuses, re-
search productivity decreased dramati-
cally. We still do not know the full fi-
nancial consequences incurred by these 
institutions or their full costs in terms 
of lost science. 
Compounding these declines in re-
search productivity, women research-
ers and researchers from groups his-
torically underrepresented in STEM 
have been particularly disadvantaged 
during the crisis because of childcare 
and other factors. 
Facing unprecedented financial dif-
ficulties, many research universities 
instituted hiring freezes, and faculty 
job openings declined by nearly 70 per-
cent. This limited job market has a 
greater effect on early-career research-
ers who may have their career derailed 
before it truly begins. Already, some 
early-career researchers are having to 
choose between applying their training 
and talent to an academic career and 
supporting their families. 
Early-career researchers play a vital 
role in the U.S. research ecosystem. 
They are not only highly productive re-
searchers, they also play a significant 
role in training the next generation of 
undergraduate and graduate STEM stu-
dents. Their departure from research 
careers, if we do not stop it, will have 
a 
profound 
and 
long-lasting 
con-
sequence on U.S. innovation and com-
petitiveness in the 21st century. 
Mr. Speaker, as increasing numbers 
of Americans receive COVID–19 vac-
cines and the research enterprise con-
tinues its recovery, we must make the 
retention of early-career researchers a 
priority. The Supporting Early-Career 
Researchers Act directs the National 
Science Foundation to establish a new 
$250 million post-doctoral fellowship 
program to support early-career re-
searchers. 
This program will help prevent a sig-
nificant loss of STEM talent. More 
than 40 organizations have endorsed 
this legislation. I, again, thank Chair-
woman JOHNSON and Ranking Member 
LUCAS for their continued deliberation 
on this important issue, and I look for-
ward to working with my colleagues on 
getting this bill signed into law. 
Mr. Speaker, I strongly urge my col-
leagues to support H.R. 144, and I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. LUCAS. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support 
of H.R. 144, the Supporting Early-Ca-
reer Researchers Act, the first bipar-
tisan bill Chairwoman JOHNSON and I 
introduced in the 117th Congress. 
Over the past year, COVID–19 has 
caused substantial disruptions across 
this country, including in the U.S. re-
search enterprise. Most research and 
development work stopped or was dra-
matically limited to provide for safe 
social distancing, and it is estimated 
we lost between 20 and as much as 40 
percent of our research output. 
In addition to this loss of research, 
we are facing the loss of our research-
ers. Graduate students and post-docs 
are particularly vulnerable to research 
disruptions. With their research on 
pause, these young scientists are find-
ing it difficult to complete their degree 
requirements. Those who have finished 
their degrees are having trouble find-
ing work. 
Much of academia has implemented 
hiring freezes, and it is estimated that 
faculty openings in the sciences have 
decreased by more than 70 percent 
compared to 2019. At the same time, 
the pace of innovation is accelerating 
globally, and with it, the competition 
for scientific and technical talent. 
The Chinese Communist Party has 
repeatedly stated it is determined to 
overtake the U.S. in critical tech-
nologies like AI, quantum computing, 
and advanced manufacturing. These 
technologies will require new levels of 
scientific skills and understanding, and 
this new generation of scientists will 
play a critical role in how they are de-
veloped. 
Now more than ever, the innovation 
capacity of the U.S. and our prosperity 
and security depend on an effective and 
an innovative STEM workforce to com-
pete with our adversaries. 
If we do not provide the resources to 
support these young researchers, we 
will be limiting our ability to support 
new and innovative discoveries for 
years to come. Unfortunately, of the 
nearly $6 trillion in COVID research 
spending that Congress has passed, 
only $600 million was allocated to help-
ing the research industry recover.

May 17, 2021 
That is only 1 percent for a sector of 
our economy that drives as much as 85 
percent of the long-term growth. We 
have relied on American science and 
scientists to combat COVID and we are 
not giving them the funding they need 
to resume the work that has been 
stopped by the pandemic and keep our 
future innovators in the system. Our 
STEM pipeline and future competitors 
could be irreparably damaged if we 
don’t act quickly. 
Mr. Speaker, that is why I am so 
proud to cosponsor this legislation. It 
will establish a pilot program at the 
National Science Foundation to pro-
vide 2-year fellowships to young re-
searchers whose career paths have been 
disrupted by the pandemic. The bill 
will support 3,200 fellowships over 4 
years. These fellowships will allow tal-
ented young scientists and engineers to 
carry out independent research at an 
institution of higher education of their 
choosing. 
This bill provides targeted and tem-
porary relief to support early-career 
scientists, keeping them in the STEM 
pipeline while the research enterprise 
recovers. By supporting these young 
researchers, we are investing in Amer-
ica’s research and technology leader-
ship. 
This legislation has been endorsed by 
over 30 organizations, and has nearly 
as many cosponsors. It was favorably 
reported out of the Committee on 
Science, Space, and Technology on a 
bipartisan basis, and I strongly urge 
my colleagues to vote in favor of this 
bill. 
Mr. Speaker, I, again, thank Chair-
woman JOHNSON and her staff for work-
ing with me on this important legisla-
tion, and I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Ms. BONAMICI. Mr. Speaker, I con-
tinue to reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. LUCAS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 
minutes to the gentleman from Michi-
gan (Mr. MEIJER). 
Mr. MEIJER. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to express my strong support for 
the bill on the floor this evening that 
will make substantial improvements in 
American research and development 
during a time when it is so badly need-
ed. The COVID–19 pandemic has cre-
ated unprecedented disruptions to our 
research enterprise and Congress must 
respond before our research community 
is irreparably harmed. 
H.R. 144, the Supporting Early-Career 
Researchers Act, will address this cri-
sis by providing funding to enable re-
searchers to stay on their chosen re-
search career track. This will help pre-
vent further loss of critical talent from 
the 
U.S. 
STEM 
workforce 
and 
strengthen our Nation as we compete 
with China to invest in the future. 
Within my district in West Michigan 
and across the State are some of the 
top-tier universities and research insti-
tutions our world has to offer. This bill 
will play a vital role in helping to re-
start any research they had to delay or 
postpone during the pandemic. 
The pandemic has created these chal-
lenges, and our research and develop-
ment fields have felt them. We must 
make a serious effort to increase pro-
ductivity across STEM disciplines in 
order to remain globally competitive. 
Mr. Speaker, I am proud to support 
H.R. 144, and I encourage my col-
leagues to vote with me in support of 
this bill. 
Ms. BONAMICI. Mr. Speaker, I con-
tinue to reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. LUCAS. Mr. Speaker, I am pre-
pared to close, and I yield myself such 
time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, America’s scientific 
progress depends on a large pool of tal-
ented STEM professionals. Our early- 
career researchers are a critical link in 
the chain of developing the next gen-
eration of scientists. 
Unfortunately, in the STEM commu-
nity, these young scientists have been 
disproportionately affected by COVID- 
related lab closures, reduced funding, 
and hiring freezes. We risk losing these 
valuable scientists if we do nothing. 
Mr. Speaker, I am proud to join 
Chairwoman JOHNSON in championing 
the Supporting Early-Career Research-
ers Act to support this up-and-coming 
generation of scientists and preserve 
America’s research and technological 
leadership. 
Mr. Speaker, in closing, I thank 
Chairwoman JOHNSON and her staff for 
working in a bipartisan and collabo-
rative way on this legislation. I en-
courage my colleagues to support this 
bill, and I yield back the balance of my 
time. 
Ms. BONAMICI. Mr. Speaker, I urge 
all of my colleagues to support the bi-
partisan Supporting Early-Career Re-
searchers Act. 
I thank Mr. LUCAS and Chair JOHN-
SON, and I yield back the balance of my 
time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentlewoman from Oregon (Ms. 
BONAMICI) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 144, as 
amended. 
The question was taken. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the 
opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being 
in the affirmative, the ayes have it. 
Mr. ROSENDALE. Mr. Speaker, on 
that I demand the yeas and nays. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to section 3(s) of House Resolution 
8, the yeas and nays are ordered. 
Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, fur-
ther proceedings on this motion are 
postponed.

STEM OPPORTUNITIES ACT 
Ms. BONAMICI. Mr. Speaker, I move 
to suspend the rules and pass the bill 
(H.R. 204) to direct the Director of the 
Office of Science and Technology Pol-
icy to carry out programs and activi-
ties to ensure that Federal science 
agencies and institutions of higher edu-
cation receiving Federal research and 
development funding are fully engag-
ing their entire talent pool, and for 
other purposes, as amended. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 204 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE; TABLE OF CONTENTS; 
FINDINGS. 
(a) SHORT TITLE.—This Act may be cited as 
the ‘‘STEM Opportunities Act’’.

tents for this Act is as follows: 
Sec. 1. Short title; table of contents; find-
ings. 
Sec. 2. Purposes. 
Sec. 3. Federal science agency policies for 
caregivers. 
Sec. 4. Collection and reporting of data on

Sec. 11. Report to Congress. 
Sec. 12. Merit review. 
Sec. 13. Determination of budgetary effects. 
Sec. 14. Definitions. 
(c) FINDINGS.—The Congress finds the fol-
lowing: 
(1) Many reports over the past decade have 
found that it is critical to our Nation’s eco-
nomic leadership and global competitiveness 
that the United States educates and trains 
more scientists and engineers. 
(2) Research shows that women and mi-
norities who are interested in STEM careers 
are disproportionately lost at nearly every 
educational transition and at every career 
milestone. 
(3) The National Center for Science and 
Engineering 
Statistics 
at 
the 
National 
Science Foundation collects, compiles, ana-
lyzes, and publishes data on the demo-
graphics of STEM degrees and STEM jobs in 
the United States. 
(4) Women now earn nearly 37 percent of 
all STEM bachelor’s degrees, but major vari-
ations persist among fields. In 2017, women 
earned only 20 percent of all bachelor’s de-
grees awarded in engineering and 19 percent 
of bachelor’s degrees awarded in computer 
sciences. Based on Bureau of Labor Statis-
tics data, jobs in computing occupations are 
expected to account for nearly 60 percent of 
the projected annual growth of newly cre-
ated STEM job openings from 2016 to 2026. 
(5) In 2017, underrepresented minority 
groups comprised 39 percent of the college- 
age population of the United States, but only 
18 percent of students who earned bachelor’s 
degrees in STEM fields. The Higher Edu-
cation Research Institute at the University 
of California, Los Angeles, found that, while 
freshmen from underrepresented minority 
groups express an interest in pursuing a 
STEM undergraduate degree at the same 
rate as all other freshmen, only 22.1 percent 
of Latino students, 18.4 percent of African- 
American students, and 18.8 percent of Na-
tive American students studying in STEM 
fields complete their degree within 5 years, 
compared to approximately 33 percent of 
White students and 42 percent of Asian stu-
dents who complete their degree within 5 
years.

(6) In some STEM fields, including the 
computer sciences, women persist at about 
the same rate through doctorate degrees. In 
other STEM fields, women persist through 
doctorate degrees at a lower rate. In mathe-
matics, women earn just 26 percent of doc-
torate degrees compared with 42 percent of 
undergraduate 
degrees. 
Overall, 
women 
earned 38 percent of STEM doctorate degrees 
in 2016. The rate of minority students earn-
ing STEM doctorate degrees in physics is 9 
percent, compared with 15 percent for bach-
elor’s 
degree. 
Students 
from 
underrep-
resented minority groups accounted for only 
11.5 percent of STEM doctorate degrees 
awarded in 2016. 
(7) The representation of women in STEM 
drops significantly from the doctorate de-
gree level to the faculty level. Overall, 
women hold only 26 percent of all tenured 
and tenure-track positions and 27 percent of 
full professor positions in STEM fields in our 
Nation’s universities and 4-year colleges. 
Black and Hispanic faculty together hold 
about 6.8 percent of all tenured and tenure- 
track positions and 7.5 percent of full pro-
fessor positions. Many of the numbers in the 
American Indian or Alaskan Native and Na-
tive Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander cat-
egories for different faculty ranks were too 
small for the National Science Foundation 
to report publicly without potentially com-
promising confidential information about 
the individuals being surveyed. 
(8) The representation of women is espe-
cially low at our Nation’s top research uni-
versities. Even in the biological sciences, in 
which women now earn more than 50 percent 
of the doctorates and passed the 25 percent 
level 37 years ago, women make up only 25 
percent of the full professors at the approxi-
mately 100 most research-intensive univer-
sities in the United States. In the physical 
sciences and mathematics, women make up 
only 11 percent of full professors, in com-
puter sciences only 10 percent, and across en-
gineering fields only 7 percent. The data sug-
gest that approximately 6 percent of all ten-
ure-track STEM faculty members at the 
most 
research-intensive 
universities 
are 
from underrepresented minority groups, but 
in some fields the numbers are too small to 
report publicly. 
(9) By 2050, underrepresented minorities 
will comprise 52 percent of the college-age 
population of the United States. If the per-
centage of female students and students 
from underrepresented minority groups earn-
ing bachelor’s degrees in STEM fields does 
not significantly increase, the United States 
will face an acute shortfall in the overall 
number of students who earn degrees in 
STEM fields just as United States companies 
are increasingly seeking students with those 
skills. With this impending shortfall, the 
United States will almost certainly lose its 
competitive edge in the 21st century global 
economy. 
(10) According to a 2014 Association for 
Women in Science survey of over 4,000 sci-
entists across the globe, 70 percent of whom 
were men, STEM researchers face significant 
challenges in work-life integration. Re-
searchers in the United States were among 
the most likely to experience a conflict be-
tween work and their personal life at least 
weekly. One-third of researchers surveyed 
said that ensuring good work-life integration 
has negatively impacted their careers, and, 
of researchers intending to leave their cur-
rent job within the next year, 9 percent indi-
cated it was because they were unable to bal-
ance work and life demands. 
(11) Female students and students from 
underrepresented minority groups at institu-
tions of higher education who see few others 
‘‘like themselves’’ among faculty and stu-
dent populations often do not experience the 
social integration that is necessary for suc-
cess in all disciplines, including STEM. 
(12) One in five children in the United 
States attend school in a rural community. 
The data shows that rural students are at a 
disadvantage with respect to STEM readi-
ness. Among STEM-interested students, 17 
percent of students in rural high schools and 
18 percent of students in town-located high 
schools meet the ACT STEM Benchmark, 
compared with 33 percent of students in sub-
urban high schools and 27 percent of students 
in urban high schools. 
(13) A substantial body of evidence estab-
lishes that most people hold implicit biases. 
Decades of cognitive psychology research re-
veal that most people carry prejudices of 
which they are unaware but that nonetheless 
play a large role in evaluations of people and 
their work. Unintentional biases and out-
moded institutional structures are hindering 
the access and advancement of women, mi-
norities, and other groups historically under-
represented in STEM. 
(14) Workshops held to educate faculty 
about 
unintentional 
biases 
have 
dem-
onstrated success in raising awareness of 
such biases. 
(15) In 2012, the Office of Diversity and 
Equal Opportunity of the National Aero-
nautics and Space Administration (in this 
Act referred to as ‘‘NASA’’) completed a re-
port that— 
(A) is specifically designed to help NASA 
grant recipients identify why the dearth of 
women in STEM fields continues and to en-
sure that it is not due to discrimination; and 
(B) provides guidance that is usable by all 
institutions of higher education receiving 
significant Federal research funding on how 
to conduct meaningful self-evaluations of 
campus culture and policies. 
(16) The Federal Government provides 55 
percent of research funding at institutions of 
higher education and, through its grant- 
making policies, has had significant influ-
ence on institution of higher education poli-
cies, including policies related to institu-
tional culture and structure. 
SEC. 2. PURPOSES. 
The purposes of this Act are as follows: 
(1) To ensure that Federal science agencies 
and institutions of higher education receiv-
ing Federal research and development fund-
ing are fully engaging the entire talent pool 
of the United States. 
(2) To promote research on, and increase 
understanding of, the participation and tra-
jectories of women, minorities, and other 
groups 
historically 
underrepresented 
in 
STEM studies and careers, including persons 
with disabilities, older learners, veterans, 
and rural, poor, and tribal populations, at in-
stitutions of higher education and Federal 
science agencies, including Federal labora-
tories. 
(3) To raise awareness within Federal 
science agencies, including Federal labora-
tories, and institutions of higher education 
about cultural and institutional barriers 
limiting the recruitment, retention, pro-
motion, and other indicators of participation 
and achievement of women, minorities, and 
other groups historically underrepresented 
in academic and Government STEM research 
careers at all levels. 
(4) To identify, disseminate, and imple-
ment best practices at Federal science agen-
cies, including Federal laboratories, and at 
institutions of higher education to remove or 
reduce cultural and institutional barriers 
limiting the recruitment, retention, and suc-
cess of women, minorities, and other groups 
historically underrepresented in academic 
and Government STEM research careers. 
(5) To provide grants to institutions of 
higher education to recruit, retain, and ad-
vance STEM faculty members from under-
represented minority groups and to imple-
ment or expand reforms in undergraduate 
STEM education in order to increase the 
number of students from underrepresented 
minority groups receiving degrees in these 
fields.

GENERAL LEAVE 
Ms. BONAMICI. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days to revise 
and extend their remarks and to in-
clude extraneous material on H.R. 204, 
the bill now under consideration. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from Oregon? 
There was no objection. 
Ms. BONAMICI. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank Committee on 
Science, Space, and Technology Chair-
woman JOHNSON and Ranking Member 
LUCAS for introducing this bill, which I 
am also proud to cosponsor. 
I thank all of the Members on both 
sides of the aisle who have cosponsored 
the bill, the 25 organizations that have 
endorsed it, and the many more organi-
zations and individuals who contrib-
uted to it. 
b 1645 
The COVID–19 pandemic has shown 
us all the importance of a robust U.S. 
research enterprise. Not only has this 
been essential during the pandemic, it 
will continue to be crucial to main-
taining 
U.S. 
global 
leadership 
in 
science and technology. 
Unfortunately, this position of global 
leadership is eroding. To maintain our 
leadership position and to lead the 
world in the development of tech-
nologies that may dramatically re-
shape our lives, the U.S. needs a tal-
ented STEM workforce that is fully 
representative of our population. 
We have a lot of work to do on that 
front. Women and people of color re-
main 
severely 
underrepresented 
in 
STEM. As we have learned from nu-
merous studies, this underrepresenta-
tion results from numerous cultural 
and institutional barriers, as well as a 
lack of access to resources and ade-
quate support. It is not because of a 
lack of talent or interest in STEM. We 
have made progress on increasing the 
diversity of the STEM fields in recent 
years, but it is nowhere near enough. 
We must act now to address these in-
equities and begin building a more di-
verse STEM workforce for the 21st cen-
tury. 
The STEM Opportunities Act re-
quires comprehensive data collection 
by Federal agencies so we can better 
understand the challenge we are facing. 
It also requires the development of 
consistent Federal policies for recipi-
ents of Federal research awards who 
have caregiving responsibilities, an 
issue the pandemic has brought into 
sharper focus. 
The bill requires OSTP to develop 
consistent guidelines and best prac-
tices for grant reviewers and program 
officers, as well as universities and 
Federal laboratories. These guidelines 
and best practices will assist in reduc-
ing the effects of implicit bias and 
identifying barriers limiting the re-
cruitment, retention, and advancement 
of women and minorities in STEM. 
The bill also authorizes the National 
Science Foundation to expand research 
aimed at improving the recruitment, 
retention, and advancement of women 
and minorities in STEM. NSF is also 
directed to award grants through the 
existing Tribal Colleges and Univer-
sities Program to support computer 
science education. 
We cannot leave anybody behind in 
the STEM fields, and H.R. 204 will help. 
We give better decisions when we have 
people from all backgrounds around 
the table. 
Mr. Speaker, I look forward to work-
ing with my colleagues to ensure this 
important bill is signed into law. I 
strongly urge my colleagues to support 
the bill, and I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. LUCAS. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support 
of H.R. 204, the STEM Opportunities 
Act of 2021. As a co-sponsor of this leg-
islation with Chairwoman JOHNSON, I 
am pleased the House is taking it up 
for consideration today. 
H.R. 204 continues the Science Com-
mittee’s long history of bipartisan sup-
port for STEM education. The United 
States is in a race to remain the 
world’s leader in science and tech-
nology. The only way we will win is by 
utilizing America’s most valuable re-
source: Our people. 
That means developing a diverse 
STEM-capable workforce at every edu-
cation level and from every back-
ground. 
The U.S. invests over $1 billion a 
year in Federal STEM education pro-
grams. But we have not made enough 
progress in growing a STEM-capable 
workforce. We need to address that. 
That is why one of the key provisions 
of H.R. 204 is a requirement for more 
comprehensive 
data 
collection 
and 
analysis on the students, researchers, 
and faculty receiving Federal science 
grants. 
This data will help us identify and re-
duce the barriers that prevent under-
represented groups from entering and 
advancing in STEM. It will also help us 
measure the success of Federal STEM 
programs to better direct our invest-
ments. 
The bill also includes a provision di-
recting the NSF to support computer 
science education through the existing 
Tribal Colleges and Universities Pro-
gram. Access to computer science re-
sources and developing computer skills 
is critical in today’s economy. 
The STEM employment in the United 
States continues to grow faster than 
any other job category. Employers in 
all sectors, including agriculture, en-
ergy, healthcare, and defense are des-
perate for workers with STEM skills. 
In order to meet this demand, we 
must develop talent across all possible 
groups. Our bill takes important steps 
to ensure that we are fully engaging 
America’s entire talent pool and main-
taining our global leadership in science 
and technology. 
H.R. 204 overwhelmingly passed the 
House last Congress, and I look forward 
to getting the bill across the finish line 
this year. 
Mr. Speaker, I encourage my col-
leagues to support this bill, and I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Ms. BONAMICI. Mr. Speaker, a few 
years ago, I held an innovation round-
table in northwest Oregon, and I re-
member clearly one very successful 
tech entrepreneur answered the ques-
tion: What is the best thing we can do 
for innovation? 
He said: We need to diversify the 
STEM workforce because people from 
different backgrounds and different ex-
periences bring different perspectives 
and help identify problems that others 
may not. 
This bill will help in that effort. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. LUCAS. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, in closing, I would like 
to thank Chairwoman JOHNSON and her 
staff for working in a bipartisan fash-
ion on this legislation and for incor-
porating our feedback and ideas. I look

courage, and develop the next genera-
tion of STEM workers. 
Maintaining our global leadership in 
science and technology is critical to 
our economic and national security. 
We will not be able to lead without a 
STEM-capable workforce for the 21st 
century. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to

MSI STEM ACHIEVEMENT ACT 
Ms. BONAMICI. Mr. Speaker, I move 
to suspend the rules and pass the bill 
(H.R. 2027) to direct Federal science 
agencies and the Office of Science and 
Technology Policy to undertake activi-
ties to improve the quality of under-
graduate STEM education and enhance 
the research capacity at the Nation’s 
HBCUs, TCUs, and MSIs, and for other 
purposes. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 2027 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘MSI STEM 
Achievement Act’’. 
SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
Congress makes the following findings: 
(1) Evidence suggests that the supply of 
STEM workers is not keeping pace with the 
rapidly evolving needs of the public and pri-
vate sector, resulting in a deficit often re-
ferred to as a STEM skills shortage. 
(2) According to the Bureau of Labor Sta-
tistics, the United States will need one mil-
lion additional STEM professionals than it is 
on track to produce in the coming decade. 
(3) STEM occupations offer higher wages, 
more opportunities for advancement, and a 
higher degree of job security than non-STEM 
occupations. 
(4) The composition of the STEM work-
force does not reflect the current or pro-
jected diversity of the Nation, with His-
panics, African Americans, and other racial 
and ethnic minorities, significantly under-
represented in the STEM workforce com-
pared to their presence in the workforce 
more generally. 
(5) A stronger national commitment to in-
creasing the diversity of the STEM work-
force is needed to help address the STEM 
skills shortage. 
(6) According to a 2019 National Academies 
of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine re-
port entitled ‘‘Minority Serving Institutions: 
America’s 
Underutilized 
Resource 
for 
Strengthening the STEM Workforce’’, 2- and 
4-year minority serving institutions enroll 
nearly 30 percent of all undergraduate stu-
dents—a percentage that is expected to grow 
in the coming years—in the United States 
higher education system and play a critical 
role in providing important pathways to 
STEM-related education, training, and ca-
reers for students of color. 
(7) HBCUs, TCUs, and MSIs are highly suc-
cessful at educating underrepresented minor-
ity students in STEM fields and can serve as 
best practice models for other colleges and 
universities to further expand participation 
of underrepresented minorities in the STEM 
workforce. 
(8) Increased investment in STEM infra-
structure at HBCUs, TCUs, and MSIs has the 
potential to increase these institutions’ abil-
ity to educate even more students in the 
STEM disciplines. 
(9) With the demand for STEM skills ex-
ceeding the supply of STEM graduates, suc-
cess of HBCUs, TCUs, and MSIs in educating 
and training science and engineering leaders 
is increasingly important for United States 
economic growth and competitiveness.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentlewoman from 
Oregon (Ms. BONAMICI) and the gen-
tleman from Oklahoma (Mr. LUCAS) 
each will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from Oregon. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Ms. BONAMICI. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
have 5 legislative days in which to re-
vise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on H.R. 2027, 
the bill now under consideration. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from Oregon? 
There was no objection. 
Ms. BONAMICI. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 
2027, the MSI STEM Achievement Act. 
The COVID–19 pandemic has high-
lighted how important scientists and 
engineers are to helping us respond to 
crises and move toward a brighter fu-
ture. 
Whether it is a deadly pandemic or 
the climate crisis, we need all of our 
Nation’s talent to help us understand 
the challenges and contribute to solu-
tions. We also need all of our Nation’s 
talent to fill the high-skilled jobs of 
the future. 
Our 
Nation’s 
demographics 
are 
changing, and we are not keeping up in 
diversifying our STEM workforce. His-
panics represent 18 percent of the U.S. 
population, but only 9 percent of the 
bachelor’s degrees in mathematics and 
physics. And for Black students, STEM 
degree attainment has either stagnated 
or declined since 1996. 
The United States can rightly cele-
brate our great research universities 
and the STEM talent they cultivate in 
their laboratories. But these institu-
tions represent a small fraction of the 
hundreds of institutions across the Na-
tion 
that 
graduate 
students 
with 
STEM degrees, and an even smaller 
fraction in terms of the number of 
Black and Hispanic students. 
In 2018, the Academies released a re-
port highlighting the outsized con-
tributions made by minority-serving 
institutions, or MSIs. These institu-
tions have a remarkable record of suc-
cess in recruiting, retaining, and grad-
uating underrepresented minority stu-
dents in STEM. For example, HBCUs 
graduate 25 percent of all African-

American graduates with STEM de-
grees. Unfortunately, MSIs have rel-
atively insufficient resources and in-
frastructure. 
The MSI STEM Achievement Act 
would make sure that education and 
research opportunities are more acces-
sible to STEM students at MSIs. The 
legislation would require more trans-
parency and accountability in Federal 
science agency support for MSIs. The 
legislation 
directs 
the 
National 
Science Foundation to support re-
search on effective practices at MSIs 
for recruiting and retaining minority 
students in STEM, and offer strategies 
to build on and scale best practices. 
It further directs NSF to support re-
search and STEM education capacity 
building at MSIs. The legislation also 
directs OSTP to develop a strategic 
plan for increasing MSI participation 
and success in competitive Federal re-
search funding opportunities. 
Supporting our country’s minority- 
serving institutions through targeted 
investments and outreach is essential 
to building our STEM workforce for 
the future. 
Therefore, Mr. Speaker, I strongly 
urge my colleagues to support H.R. 
2027, and I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. LUCAS. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I am proud to co-spon-
sor this legislation led by Chairwoman 
JOHNSON and Research and Technology 
Ranking 
Member 
MICHAEL
WALTZ, 
which continues the Science Commit-
tee’s bipartisan work to support, en-
courage, and develop the next genera-
tion of America’s Science, Technology, 
Engineering, Mathematics, and Com-
puter Science workforce. 
Minority-serving institutions, such 
as historically Black colleges and uni-
versities, Hispanic-serving institutions, 
and Tribal colleges and universities 
have a long record of success in re-
cruiting, 
retaining, 
and 
graduating 
underrepresented 
students 
in 
the 
STEM fields. 
In my own district, I have seen the 
unique value of minority-serving insti-
tutions. For more than 100 years, 
Langston University, a historically 
Black college and land-grant institu-
tion, has educated students of all back-
grounds. They have influenced people’s 
lives beyond the classroom in service 
to the community in both rural and 
urban Oklahoma. This legislation will 
help schools like Langston prepare 
their students to fill the STEM jobs of 
the 21st century. 
Since 1990, employment in STEM oc-
cupations has grown by nearly 80 per-
cent. Over the next decade, with de-
mand continuing to grow and U.S. uni-
versities expecting to produce less than 
one-third of the STEM graduates need-
ed, the STEM shortage is anticipated 
to reach 1 million professionals. At the 
same time, minorities are severely 
underrepresented in STEM fields, only 
accounting for 11 percent of the STEM 
workforce. 
To meet this growing demand, talent 
from all groups is essential. This bill 
we are considering today takes up this 
call to action by providing for in-
creased transparency, accountability, 
and accessibility of Federal STEM edu-
cation and research funding. 
Without a diverse talent pool of 
Americans with strong STEM knowl-
edge and skills prepared for the jobs of 
the future, the U.S. will not be able to 
maintain the innovation that supports 
key sectors of the economy, including 
agriculture, energy, healthcare, and de-
fense. 
Mr. Speaker, I, again, thank Chair-
woman JOHNSON and Ranking Member 
WALTZ for their leadership. 
Mr. Speaker, I encourage my col-
leagues to support this legislation, and 
I reserve the balance of my time. 
Ms. BONAMICI. Mr. Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
b 1700 
Mr. LUCAS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
such time as he may consume to the 
gentleman from Florida (Mr. WALTZ), 
the ranking member on the Research 
and Technology Subcommittee, and 
one of our great activists on this sub-
ject matter. 
Mr. WALTZ. Mr. Speaker, since 1904, 
Bethune-Cookman University, a his-
torically Black college, has contrib-
uted to a rich, diverse history in my 
district in Florida. Four thousand stu-
dents 
proudly 
call 
this 
university 
home. In Florida’s Sixth Congressional 
District, we are proud of all of Be-
thune-Cookman’s accomplishments, es-
pecially in the STEM fields. I person-
ally look forward to seeing the statue 
of Dr. Mary McLeod Bethune represent 
the great State of Florida in Statuary 
Hall very soon. 
Mr. Speaker, minorities make up 30 
percent of the United States popu-
lation, but nationwide we are seeing a 
gap in minority representation in 
STEM fields. Believe it or not, minori-
ties account for only 11 percent of the 
STEM workforce, and that 11 percent 
comes after years of slow improvement 
and diversity inclusion, but does not 
factor in how the COVID pandemic has 
disproportionately affected women and 
underrepresented minorities in STEM. 
There is fear that this limited progress 
may be undone by the COVID–19 crisis. 
Simultaneously, 
the 
demand 
for 
STEM skills is at an all-time high. 
Over the next decade, the STEM short-
age is anticipated to reach 1 million 
professionals. So we have a math prob-
lem. 
If we want to maintain America’s 
edge over the Chinese Communist 
Party and over our adversaries, then 
we need to make sure our workforce re-
flects our country’s diversity and that 
the numbers for that workforce are 
there. We must commit to increasing 
participation in the STEM enterprise 
and supporting individuals and institu-
tions disproportionately impacted by 
the coronavirus pandemic. 
Minority-serving 
institutions 
like 
Bethune-Cookman University play a 
critical role in bringing members of 
underrepresented groups into STEM 
training and careers. By partnering 
with MSIs, the bill we are considering 
today would help increase the capacity 
for minority students in STEM cur-
ricula and encourage partnerships with 
industry and Federal laboratories. 
While the Chinese Communist Party 
is trying to leapfrog America in STEM, 
this bill will enhance our domestic 
workforce to compete. If America 
wants to lead militarily, economically, 
and globally, then we must lead in 
STEM. 
Mr. Speaker, I would be remiss to not 
mention the importance of women as 
well in STEM. As I have said countless 
times since I have been elected, and 
will continue to say, from my experi-
ence as a Green Beret around the globe, 
where women thrive in business, in 
civil society, and in politics, the fact is 
that extremism does not thrive. So for 
that reason, amongst others, diversity 
in STEM is a national security issue. 
In Volusia County, in my district, 
just north of Cape Canaveral, Florida, 
and the Kennedy Space Center, we are 
seeing countless businesses participate 
in workforce programs like the Space 
Coast Consortium Apprenticeship Pro-
gram. This program and others are 
making huge strides to advance STEM 
curriculum 
and 
workforce 
develop-
ment. 
As the Republican lead on the MSI 
STEM Achievement Act, I want to 
thank Chairwoman JOHNSON, as well as 
Ranking Member LUCAS, for working 
with me to improve participation in 
STEM at MSIs. For America’s contin-
ued predominance in science and tech-
nology, I urge my colleagues to support 
this important bill and for its passage. 
Ms. BONAMICI. Mr. Speaker, I con-
tinue to reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. LUCAS. Mr. Speaker, I have no 
further speakers, and I yield myself the 
balance of my time to close. 
Mr. Speaker, the United States is in 
a race to remain the world leader in 
science and technology. The only way 
we will win this is by utilizing Amer-
ica’s most valuable resource: Our peo-
ple. 
That means developing a diverse 
STEM-capable workforce at every edu-
cation level and from every back-
ground. Creating opportunities for stu-
dents to not only develop STEM knowl-
edge, but to also have hands-on experi-
ence is essential. 
Research shows that students—espe-
cially those from underrepresented mi-
nority backgrounds—are more likely to 
graduate from science and engineering 
programs if they have opportunities to 
engage in STEM course content with 
peers, participate in undergraduate re-
search, and join science clubs and orga-
nizations. 
This bill will support such STEM 
education and training activities in 
MSIs, providing these students with 
the skills necessary to compete and

COMBATING SEXUAL HARASSMENT 
IN SCIENCE ACT 
Ms. BONAMICI. Mr. Speaker, I move 
to suspend the rules and pass the bill 
(H.R. 2695) to provide for research to 
better understand the causes and con-
sequences of sexual harassment affect-
ing individuals in the scientific, tech-
nical, engineering, and mathematics 
workforce and to examine policies to 
reduce the prevalence and negative im-
pact of such harassment, and for other 
purposes. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 2695 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE; TABLE OF CONTENTS. 
(a) SHORT TITLE.—This Act may be cited as 
the 
‘‘Combating 
Sexual 
Harassment 
in 
Science Act’’. 
(b) TABLE OF CONTENTS.—The table of con-
tents for this Act is as follows: 
Sec. 1. Short title; table of contents. 
Sec. 2. Findings. 
Sec. 3. Definitions. 
Sec. 4. Research grants. 
Sec. 5. Data collection. 
Sec. 6. Responsible conduct guide. 
Sec. 7. Interagency working group. 
Sec. 8. National academies assessment. 
Sec. 9. Authorization of appropriations. 
SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
Congress makes the following findings: 
(1) According to the report issued by the 
National Academies of Sciences, Engineer-
ing, and Medicine in 2018 entitled ‘‘Sexual 
Harassment of Women: Climate, Culture, and 
Consequences in Academic Sciences, Engi-
neering, and Medicine’’— 
(A) sexual harassment is pervasive in insti-
tutions of higher education; 
(B) the most common type of sexual har-
assment is gender harassment, which in-
cludes verbal and nonverbal behaviors that 
convey insulting, hostile, and degrading atti-
tudes about members of one gender; 
(C) 58 percent of individuals in the aca-
demic workplace experience sexual harass-
ment, the second highest rate when com-
pared to the military, the private sector, and 
Federal, State, and local government; 
(D) women who are members of racial or 
ethnic minority groups are more likely to 
experience sexual harassment and to feel un-
safe at work than White women, White men, 
or men who are members of such groups; 
(E) the training for each individual who 
has a doctor of philosophy in the science, 
technology, engineering, and mathematics 
fields is estimated to cost approximately 
$500,000; and 
(F) attrition of an individual so trained re-
sults in a loss of talent and money. 
(2) Sexual harassment undermines career 
advancement for women. 
(3) According to a 2017 University of Illi-
nois study, among astronomers and plan-
etary scientists, 18 percent of women who 
are members of racial or ethnic minority 
groups and 12 percent of White women 
skipped professional events because they did 
not feel safe attending. 
(4) Many women report leaving employ-
ment at institutions of higher education due 
to sexual harassment. 
(5) Research shows the majority of individ-
uals do not formally report experiences of 
sexual harassment due to a justified fear of 
retaliation or other negative professional or 
personal consequences. 
(6) Reporting procedures with respect to 
such harassment are inconsistent among 
Federal science agencies and have varying 
degrees of accessibility. 
(7) There is not adequate communication 
among Federal science agencies and between 
such agencies and grantees regarding reports 
of sexual harassment, which has resulted in 
harassers receiving Federal funding after 
moving to a different institution.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H2403 
May 17, 2021 
Harassment in Science Act, which I am 
pleased to cosponsor. 
In 
2017, 
the 
Me 
Too 
movement 
sparked a national reckoning with the 
pervasiveness of sexual harassment. 
The academic workplace has not been 
spared. One study found that 58 percent 
of faculty and staff at universities have 
experienced sexual harassment. 
Sexual harassment is detrimental to 
individuals, often impeding career ad-
vancement and leading some to leave 
academia entirely. Sexual harassment 
also has significant consequences on 
the entire scientific enterprise, depriv-
ing our most critical STEM fields of 
skilled researchers, particularly from 
groups already underrepresented in 
STEM. 
In 2018, the National Academies of 
Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine 
released a report examining the con-
tributing factors to sexual harassment 
in academia and the effects on women 
in science, technology, and medicine. 
The Combating Sexual Harassment in 
Science Act includes key recommenda-
tions from the Academies’ report and 
takes further steps to combat sexual 
harassment in STEM. 
The National Science Foundation 
and other agencies have already taken 
significant steps to address the scourge 
of sexual harassment in STEM. Unfor-
tunately, not all agencies have taken 
this issue as seriously, and the patch-
work of policies and approaches causes 
confusion and increases administrative 
burden on grantees. This legislation 
helps make sure that we have con-
sistent, governmentwide policies. 
H.R. 2695 requires a coordinated ap-
proach to address sexual harassment at 
grant-receiving institutions and across 
our Federal agencies, including by re-
quiring OSTP to issue uniform policy 
guidance for sexual harassment report-
ing at Federal science agencies. 
The bill also authorizes NSF research 
on the contributing factors to STEM 
workplace harassment. 
Finally, the bill would require an im-
portant follow-up study by the Na-
tional Academies. 
The Combating Sexual Harassment 
in Science Act was developed following 
extensive consultation with experts on 
sexual harassment and key stake-
holders, 
including 
universities. 
At 
present, 24 organizations have endorsed 
this bill, representing a wide spectrum 
of 
scientific 
disciplines, 
student 
groups, and professions. 
I want to thank Chairwoman JOHN-
SON and Ranking Member LUCAS for in-
troducing this important bill. I also 
want to thank all of the cosponsors of 
this bipartisan effort. I urge everyone 
here to help us take action toward 
eliminating sexual harassment in the 
sciences. 
Mr. Speaker, I strongly urge my col-
leagues to support H.R. 2695, and I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. LUCAS. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 
2695, the Combating Sexual Harass-
ment in Science Act. 
I am proud to say that this bill has a 
foundation of years of investigation, 
analysis, and recommendations to the 
Science, Space, and Technology Com-
mittee. Curbing sexual misconduct in 
science is a priority that Chairwoman 
JOHNSON and I share. 
Engaging more women in STEM 
studies and careers is essential to 
American 
competitiveness. 
Women 
make up over half the workforce, but 
account for less than 25 percent of 
America’s STEM workforce. Unfortu-
nately, too many women have been 
driven out of STEM careers due to a 
culture of harassment and abuse. 
H.R. 2695 takes the first steps to ad-
dress this problem. The bill directs 
NSF to expand research efforts to bet-
ter understand the causes and con-
sequences of sexual harassment affect-
ing individuals in the scientific, tech-
nical, engineering, and mathematical 
workforces. 
Additionally, it directs NSF to exam-
ine policies to reduce the prevalence 
and negative impact of such harass-
ment. 
The bill also supports the adoption of 
uniform guidance across the Federal 
science agencies to combat sexual har-
assment involving grant personnel. 
There is an established legal process 
in place within higher education and in 
the workforce for handling claims of 
sexual harassment. I cannot stress this 
enough: this bill does not alter that 
process. 
What this bill does do is create a uni-
form policy requiring universities and 
research institutions to report to Fed-
eral science agencies when an adminis-
trative action is taken that impacts 
the ability of a researcher to carry out 
a grant. 
Pervasive sexual harassment in the 
scientific 
community 
discourages 
women from critical work and good- 
paying jobs and hurts American com-
petitiveness. It is unacceptable for tax-
payer dollars to fund researchers who 
are guilty of harassing students or col-
leagues. 
I want to thank the stakeholders, es-
pecially the university community, for 
working with committee staff to im-
prove this legislation. I believe the re-
vised bill strikes the right balance be-
tween protecting due process and pri-
vacy, while also making sure that Fed-
eral science agencies can act if a Fed-
eral research grant or the personnel 
supporting that grant is impacted. 
Mr. Speaker, in closing, H.R. 2695 
takes the first steps towards address-
ing sexual harassment in STEM fields, 
which is driving women out of STEM 
careers and damaging U.S. competi-
tiveness. 
While some progress has been made 
since the Science, Space, and Tech-
nology Committee first started inves-
tigating the issue almost 4 years ago, 
there is still much more work to be 
done. This legislation sends a strong 
message to the scientific community 
that misconduct will not be tolerated, 
and it sends a message to women who 
are in STEM studies and careers that 
we support them. 
This bill passed the House last Con-
gress, and I look forward to working 
with our colleagues in the Senate and 
stakeholders to advance this legisla-
tion into law this year. 
I again want to thank Chairwoman 
JOHNSON and her staff for working in a 
bipartisan and collaborative way on 
this legislation. 
Mr. Speaker, I encourage my col-
leagues to support this bill, and I yield 
back the balance of my time. 
Ms. BONAMICI. Mr. Speaker, in clos-
ing, I, once again, urge my colleagues 
on both sides of the aisle to support 
this important and bipartisan legisla-
tion, the Combating Sexual Harass-
ment in Science Act. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentlewoman from Oregon (Ms. 
BONAMICI) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 2695. 
The question was taken. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the 
opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being 
in the affirmative, the ayes have it. 
Mr. ROSENDALE. Mr. Speaker, on 
that I demand the yeas and nays. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to section 3(s) of House Resolution 
8, the yeas and nays are ordered. 
Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, fur-
ther proceedings on this motion are

SUPPORTING ISRAEL’S RIGHT TO 
DEFEND ITSELF 
(Ms. GARCIA of Texas asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
her remarks.) 
Ms. GARCIA of Texas. Madam Speak-
er, I rise today to express my strong 
support for Israel’s right to defend 
itself against rocket attacks from 
Hamas and other terrorist groups in 
Gaza. 
These attacks against Israel must be 
condemned. I applaud President Biden 
for actively engaging across the region 
to help bring about peace through di-
plomacy. Further conflict will cer-
tainly claim the lives of Israeli and 
Palestinian civilians, including chil-
dren, and that is unacceptable. 
As a Latina and a Catholic, it is my 
sincere prayer that Jerusalem will be a 
city of peace for all faiths, all nation-
alities, and all backgrounds. This last-
ing peace will only be possible if every-
one, Palestinians and Israelis alike, 
have the opportunity for freedom and 
security promised by a two-state solu-
tion. 
Those who plan for peace will have 
joy. Let it be so. 
f 
MARKING TAX DAY 
(Mr. MCCARTHY asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
his remarks.) 
Mr. MCCARTHY. Madam Speaker, 35 
years ago, I fulfilled my American 
Dream to own a business when I opened 
a small deli. I was only 20 years old. 
As a former small business owner, I 
understand how tough things can be, 
even in the good times. Running a 
small business taught me two impor-
tant lessons: first, you are the first to 
work, last to leave, and the last to be 
paid; second, your margins are tight, 
and high taxes too often make it im-
possible for Main Street to beat the 
odds. 
These lessons, which inspired me to 
enter public service, come to mind as 
we mark tax day. We should be on 
track for an incredible comeback. 
From jobs to vaccines, President Biden 
inherited an economy that was moving 
in the right direction because of Oper-
ation Warp Speed and the Tax Cuts and 
Jobs Act, which created the best econ-
omy in more than a generation. 
But the policies of the current ad-
ministration have squandered all that 
progress. Bidenomics has made a mess 
of the economy, transforming what 
should have been a strong comeback 
into a serious crisis in less than 6 
months. 
First, Democrats jammed through 
$1.9 trillion of the so-called rescue plan 
that continued to give taxpayer-funded 
handouts to people to stay home and 
do nothing. 
When he signed this spending pack-
age into law in March, President Biden 
promised America that help was on the 
way. But for business owners across the 
country, help wasn’t on the way; ‘‘help 
wanted’’ signs were. 
Describing his struggle to hire em-
ployees, Rod Harl, the CEO of Alene 
Candles, told his local paper last week: 
‘‘We have had more than 100 positions 
open since the start of the year, and 
just recently, we increased sign-on bo-
nuses to $1,200 for hourly positions, in 
part because we were competing with 
an entity that can print its own 
money—the Federal Government—and 
its $300 extra per week additional un-
employment benefit.’’ 
Sadly, this isn’t unique just to Mr. 
Harl. It is the same story I hear from 
businesses nationwide. 
In a matter of months, we went from 
the highest job openings on record in 
March, 8.1 million—remember, that is 
the same month that President Biden 
signed his bill, that he thought help 
was on the way—to the biggest jobs re-
port miss in more than two decades. 
Unemployment actually increased, de-
spite the record number of openings. 
For a brief moment during the pan-
demic, it made sense to encourage peo-
ple to stay home, but now in May 2021, 
it defies logic. We should not tax the 
people who are working to continue to 
pay people who choose not to. 
Another concern I hear from busi-
nesses and workers is rising inflation. 
Consumer prices in April saw their 
largest increase in a single month since 
1981, soaring by more than 1 percent. 
Inflation taxes every single American 
and especially affects those with the 
least income. 
But remember what President Biden 
promised, that he wouldn’t raise taxes 
on families making less than $400,000. 
By causing inflation to rise, President 
Biden has broken that pledge, and we 
are less than 5 months into this admin-
istration. 
Madam Speaker, any economics class 
would tell you that the worst thing to 
do is exactly what Bidenomics has done 
to this country. He inherited one of the 
strongest economies, a GDP growing, 
and he actually did the opposite. He 
paid people to stay home. He put more 
money into the economy from govern-
ment, which only drives up inflation. 
We have not seen something like this 
since Jimmy Carter took this country 
into stagnation. 
Now, Americans are paying more at 
supermarkets, hardware stores, and gas 
stations, and it has only been 5 
months. In fact, we have a serious gas 
shortage in a nation that was recently 
energy independent. 
Could you imagine, Madam Speaker, 
becoming 
President 
of 
the 
United 
States and having a country that is en-
ergy independent, that is actually 
sending natural gas to other nations, 
to waking up to no gas in the gas lines 
in 
America—not 
because 
Congress 
passed a bill but because the President 
signed an executive order? 
Madam Speaker, I remember wanting 
to see my grandmother one day. It was 
back during the Jimmy Carter years, 
and my father told me no. I asked why 
we couldn’t drive to see grandma, and 
it was because our license plate ended 
in an even number, not an odd. That is 
the only other time that you can com-
pare what is happening in America 
today. 
b 1915 
17,000 gas stations nationwide were 
completely emptied out. The average 
price of gasoline remains above $3. This 
is the highest gasoline has been since 
the last time Biden was in office. In 
California, the average was $4.12. In 
Virginia, prices were as high as nearly 
$7 a gallon. 
It didn’t have to be this way. He 
didn’t have to attack the hardworking 
Americans in the energy industry. His 
own Secretary of Energy said pipelines 
were good, even though he ended the 
Keystone XL pipeline and went after 
the ability for Americans to even drill 
on Federal land. 
So now, Russia is sending gasoline to 
America? Does that make any sense, to 
make our enemies stronger, while Rus-
sia builds up thousands of troops along 
the border of Ukraine or enters into ne-
gotiations with Iran, who supplies mis-
siles to shoot at our allies? 
Instead 
of 
priming 
the 
pump, 
Bidenomics has emptied the tank. 
From inflation to gas lines, the Amer-
ican economy today looks more like it 
did in 1979 than in 2019, when wages 
were rising, businesses were growing, 
and unemployment was at record lows. 
None of this is an accident, you see, 
Madam Speaker. It is a direct result of 
bad Federal policies that have dis-
torted incentives and prices. 
Yet President Biden, Speaker PELOSI, 
and other Democrats still want to tax 
and spend more. Even the most liberal 
economists tell you that is wrong, 
which very seldom happens. They de-
cided to propose another $5.2 trillion in 
new spending, as if there is a bottom-
less cash pit for politicians to draw on. 
They also decided to propose the 
largest tax increase in American his-
tory, including making the corporate 
tax rate the highest in the world; high-
er than France; higher than Venezuela, 
a socialist country; and higher than 
Communist China. 
Madam Speaker, why would the 
Democrats and Speaker PELOSI want to 
give China a benefit over America? I 
don’t understand why we wouldn’t look 
after American workers first. 
These proposals reflect a funda-
mental difference between Republicans 
and these new socialist Democrats. Re-
publicans believe that there is dignity 
and value in hard work and risk-tak-
ing. Democrats believe that progress 
comes by forcing people to be depend-
ent on their government. That is not

progress, to force somebody to be de-
pendent on government. 
They want to control the decisions 
you make: when you can work, when 
you can drive, whether you should 
wear a mask. It doesn’t matter what 
the science or the CDC says. If Speaker 
PELOSI has the power, she will enforce 
it on you. 
They want to control what you can 
read on the internet and what you can 
teach your children. But look at his-
tory. I don’t see a single country where 
Democrat socialist ideas worked be-
fore. They have all been failures. 
My greatest fear is the direction you 
are sending America. In 5 months, 
America goes from energy independ-
ence to having gasoline stations with-
out gas; from an economy where you 
have done nothing but grow back, to 
creating inflation we haven’t seen in 
decades; to empowering our enemies, 
who only harm our allies. You have 
more help wanted signs in America—8 
million—and you missed the jobs re-
port, the worst we have seen in dec-
ades, by the action taken on this floor. 
The hard part about it, Madam 
Speaker, is we warned you. We told you 
what would happen. We told you you 
were going to create inflation. We told 
you you were going to kill American 
jobs. You are going to reward people 
not to work. I have never been a be-
liever in participation trophies. They 
don’t work. They don’t help. Certainly, 
those small businesses that have strug-
gled to survive, you are crushing them. 
Every 
indication, 
every 
number 
shows it. To sit here on the floor and 
say you will not raise their taxes, you 
are doing it right now. You are hurting 
the most vulnerable. Gas prices are 
higher. The bread, the lumber to even 
build the house, you are pricing them 
out. 
The recent surge of bad economic 
news, in what should be a robust recov-
ery, is a warning sign that your ideas 
are not working now. The last time in-
flation was this high, Joe Biden was 
Vice President. The last time gas 
prices were this high, Joe Biden was 
Vice President. We found the common 
denominator: President Biden’s bad 
policies. 
Unfortunately, 
instead 
of 
learning from history, President Biden 
and Democrats are choosing to repeat 
it. 
That was one of the low points in 
America, when inflation was high, in-
terest rates were there, and the rest of 
the world questioned whether America 
was what they used to be. We proved 
what policies could matter: incentive 
to work, letting people keep more of 
what they earned; making America en-
ergy independent. 
What is so amazing to me, when 
President Biden was elected, he had 
Operation Warp Speed, he got a vac-
cine, and he was vaccinated before he 
was even sworn in. He had millions of 
doses of the vaccine being produced. He 
had an economy rising, coming out of 
the COVID pandemic. He had more help 
wanted signs. If he literally did noth-
ing, America would be stronger. But he 
took the wrong actions, led by the so-
cialist Democrats of this floor, Madam 
Speaker. Now America is hurting. 
The only thing I ask: study history, 
listen to those who are creating jobs, 
take the incentive away where govern-
ment is everything, and unshackle 
what holds us back. Let Americans 
have the freedom they deserve and de-
sire. Prove that the next century will 
be ours once again.

bers are reminded to address their re-
marks to the Chair.

REPEAL THE STATE AND LOCAL 
TAX SALT CAP 
(Ms. SHERRILL asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Ms. SHERRILL. Madam Speaker, I 
rise on tax day. Teachers, cops, single 
moms, seniors, veterans, middle-class 
Americans—I am here to speak for all 
of them today, to be their voice in the 
fight against a tax provision that pun-
ishes States like New Jersey for invest-
ing in its residents. 
In States like mine, our State taxes 
go toward paying for top-tier public 
schools, investing in infrastructure and 
open spaces, and supporting a pre-
vailing wage for our unions. That is 
why people move here. That is why 
families stay for generations. 
But without the ability to deduct 
State and local taxes, calling New Jer-
sey home is becoming less and less via-
ble for our middle-class residents. 
Seniors are rethinking retiring in 
New Jersey; married couples are re-
thinking starting a family in New Jer-
sey; young people are rethinking mov-
ing back to New Jersey after college. 
The bottom line is, you don’t have to 
be a millionaire to be impacted by the 
SALT cap, and New Jersey families are 
getting taxed twice. 
The time is now to bring relief to ev-
eryday middle-class New Jersey resi-
dents who are getting crushed by this 
cap. 
f 
HONORING THE LIFE OF SUTTIE 
ECONOMY 
(Mr. CLINE asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. CLINE. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize the life and legacy 
of Roanoke native and World War II 
Navy veteran Suttie Economy, who 
passed away earlier this month at the 
age of 95. 
While Economy was proud of his 
service and the time he spent on the 
USS English in the South Pacific, he 
never forgot his fellow veterans who 
didn’t make it home. Economy made it 
his life’s mission to honor soldiers, 
sailors, airmen, and Marines who gave 
their lives for the cause of American 
freedom. 
Known for his efforts to maintain the 
Roanoke War Memorial, driving around 
town in his red, white, and blue Yugo, 
and handing out Juicy Fruit gum, 
Economy made an impression when-
ever he went. 
In 2008, he said one of his proudest 
moments was having marble flower 
vases added to the Star City’s war me-
morial after years of lobbying, urging 
folks to: ‘‘Never forget those vet-
erans.’’ 
His daughter said his work was never 
about him, but rather, it was always 
about the veterans who served and 
gave their lives. 
With traffic stopped, a police officer 
standing at attention, and members of 
the Combat Veterans Motorcycle Asso-
ciation serving as pallbearers, Econ-
omy was laid to rest with the respect 
he deserved. 
Fair winds and following seas, Suttie.

STANDING FOR ISRAEL 
(Ms. SALAZAR asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.) 
Ms. SALAZAR. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to declare my community’s 
unshakable support for the State of 
Israel. 
Israel has been under constant fire 
for over a week by Hamas, which is a 
terrorist organization supported by 
Iran. Over 3,100 rockets have been fired, 
10 Israelis have been killed, and mil-
lions more would be at risk if not for 
the Iron Dome missile defense system 
protecting its citizens. 
Make no mistake, Hamas is not in-
terested in peace. Their goal is to de-
stroy the Jewish State of Israel. 
Hamas 
uses 
children 
as 
human 
shields and pays the terrorists’ families 
for life. 
Hamas launches the attacks but tries 
to paint Israel as the aggressor. At the 
same time, cynics or opportunists are 
taking advantage of this violent wave 
of terrorism to peddle anti-Semitic 
hate. 
I am proud to stand for Israel, the 
only democratic country in the Middle 
East and its right to defend itself.

ISRAEL IS AMERICA’S STRONGEST 
ALLY 
(Mr. COMER asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. COMER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to stand with the people of Israel 
and their right to defend themselves 
against the Iranian-funded terrorist 
groups, Hamas and Hezbollah. 
Last week, these terrorists began fir-
ing missiles into Israel and killing 
Israeli citizens. Since these unjustified 
attacks started, we have seen Members 
of Congress and the media rush to de-
clare a moral equivalence between 
Israel and its attackers. 
Let me be very clear: There is no 
moral equivalence between the State of 
Israel and terrorists who shield them-
selves with children, target civilian

tion and is entitled to defend itself.

Israeli citizens must end. Time and 
time again, Israel has proven itself to 
be America’s strongest ally, and we

REMEMBERING GORDON SAUSSY 
VARNEDOE 
(Mr. CARTER of Georgia asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and 
extend his remarks.) 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today with a heavy 
heart to remember and honor Gordon 
Saussy Varnedoe, who passed away on 
April 24 at the age of 82. 
Gordon was born in Savannah, Geor-
gia, and was a proud graduate of the 
University of Georgia. Returning to 
Savannah, he became the director of 
the Waterfront Association; and a 
fundraiser for Armstrong State Col-
lege, the Alzheimer’s Association, and 
the Savannah Jazz Association. 
Gordon’s accomplishments as an ath-
lete and contributor to Savannah’s 
sports community earned him an in-
duction to the Greater Savannah Ath-
letic Hall of Fame as the first recipient 
of the M.A. Spellman Special Award. 
Gordon’s remarkable athletic accom-
plishments 
and 
contributions 
span 
multiple sports and decades. He walked 
on to the University of Georgia’s foot-
ball team as a fullback, founded the 
Savannah College of Art and Design 
rugby team, and the Savannah Scot-
tish games. 
Madam Speaker, two months before 
he died, I got a postcard from ‘‘Bat-
man.’’ It said: ‘‘You have been getting 
some heat recently. Just so you know, 
I love you and always will.’’ 
I love you, too, Batman. We are going 
to miss you. 
f 
A CARBON TAX IS A BAD IDEA 
(Mr. LAMALFA asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. LAMALFA. Madam Speaker, I 
rise tonight to speak about the pro-
posal for yet another idea for a carbon 
tax. 
This will just drive inflation, which 
is already a significant problem for 
Americans, for fuel, for running their 
small businesses, for taking their kids 
to school, for just doing the things 
they do, maybe even going on a vaca-
tion. 
Costs will go up if we have to tax en-
ergy more and more and more for doing 
business, for buying groceries, for 
every aspect of our lives, yet another 
tax heaped upon the people. 
There are already proposals around 
here to raise taxes on fuel or maybe 
every mile you travel in your auto-
mobile. We have seen this in California 
already. I have watched what a carbon 
tax has done. It becomes a slush fund 
for government to spend to use on 
whatever it is they want to do, such as 
boondoggles like the high-speed rail in 
California, which is already triple over 
its original budget concept. 
So why do we want to heap more and 
more on the backs of families, of small 
businesses, of a country whose econ-
omy is trying to recover by hitting 
them once again with one more bad 
idea of a carbon tax when, by the way, 
carbon dioxide is 0.04 percent of our at-
mosphere? 
A lot of hype is being made out of 
this. No, the science is not settled by a 
long stretch, certainly by what human 
needs are compared to what human 
cause is.

THE TRAGEDY OF THE TULSA 
GREENWOOD MASSACRE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under 
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 4, 2021, the gentleman from New 
York (Mr. TORRES) is recognized for 60 
minutes as the designee of the major-
ity leader. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. TORRES of New York. Madam 
Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that 
all Members have 5 legislative days to 
revise and extend their remarks and in-
clude any extraneous material on the 
subject of this Special Order. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from New York? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. TORRES of New York. Madam 
Speaker, I am honored to share today’s 
Special Order hour on Black Wall 
Street on behalf of the Congressional 
Black Caucus, which is chaired by our 
great leader, Congressmember JOYCE 
BEATTY. 
I want to extend my condolences to 
Congressmember Beatty and her family 
for the loss of her husband. 
On May 30, 1921, a single scream in an 
elevator became the spark that ignited 
a powder keg of racial terror that set 
on fire Black Wall Street. A young 
Black man enters an elevator, and an 
elevator 
operator, 
a 
young 
White 
woman, screams, giving the impression 
that she had been assaulted. 
A local newspaper, the Tulsa Trib-
une, accuses the young Black man of 
raping the young White woman. The 
headline of the article was an incite-
ment to racial violence: ‘‘Nab the 
Negro Who Attacked the Girl in the El-
evator.’’ 
As a result of the incitement, a 
White lynch mob descended on Black 
Wall Street and set on fire the wealthi-
est Black community in the United 
States, reducing it to ashes. The ashes 
of Black Wall Street are a metaphor 
for the failure of Reconstruction. 
In the immediate aftermath of the 
Civil War, there were newly emanci-
pated African Americans who set out 
to build a better life for themselves and 
their family, only to be held back by 
racial terror and violence that ulti-
mately came to be codified in the form 
of Jim Crow. 
We, as the CBC, are not only here to 
recite the facts of the Tulsa Race Mas-
sacre, but we are also here to reflect on 
the deeper meaning. The massacre in 
Tulsa tells a larger story about false 
accusation as an incitement to vio-
lence. It tells a larger story about the 
failure of Reconstruction and the rise 
of Jim Crow. It tells a larger story 
about domestic terrorism and white su-
premacist extremism as a form of do-
mestic terror. It tells a larger story 
about the systematic denial and de-
struction of Black wealth. And, finally, 
it tells a larger story about the legacy 
of discrimination and the need for res-
titution. 
It is worth noting that here in the 
United States Congress there is no 
greater champion of reparations than 
the chair of the Special Order hour, 
Congressmember JACKSON LEE. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tlewoman from California (Ms. LEE). 
Ms. 
LEE 
of 
California. 
Madam 
Speaker, first, let me thank the gen-
tleman from New York for organizing 
this very important Special Order and 
for his tremendous leadership on so 
many issues on behalf of his district, 
the Congressional Black Caucus, and 
on behalf of all Americans. 
Let me first send my deepest condo-
lences to Chairwoman JOYCE BEATTY 
and her family on the loss of her be-
loved husband, Otto Beatty, Jr., a de-
voted partner, beloved father, grand-
father, and community leader. Our 
hearts are broken this evening as we 
think about Congresswoman BEATTY 
and her family, and just know we are 
praying for her and her community and 
her family. 
This is a Special Order tonight that I 
want to thank again Congressman 
RITCHIE TORRES and the Congressional 
Black Caucus for organizing this to 
mark 100 years since the horrific trag-
edy of the Tulsa Greenwood massacre. 
In one of the worst acts of racist vio-
lence in United States history, a White 
mob ransacked a prosperous African- 
American neighborhood in Tulsa, Okla-
homa. From May 31 to June 1, 1921, an 
estimated 300 Black men, women, and 
children were murdered. The mob de-
stroyed 35 square blocks of Greenwood 
and burned down over 1,000 Black- 
owned 
businesses, 
churches, 
and 
homes. 
During a time when lynching African 
Americans was commonplace, the al-
leged—mind you, alleged—assault of a 
White woman by a Black man was 
enough to incite a massacre of un-
imaginable 
proportions. 
A 
thriving 
Black community became the target of 
animosity and racial hatred by its 
neighbors. 
Now, a grand jury placed the blame 
for the massacre entirely on the Black

community. No White person was ever 
held accountable for these crimes. This 
is an example, mind you, of the horrors 
and the experience of living as a Black 
person in America then and now. 
In 1997, the Oklahoma Legislature es-
tablished a commission to study the 
Tulsa race riots of 1921. It was charged 
with the responsibility of developing 
an historical record of the massacre 
through 
identifying 
witnesses 
and 
gathering testimony and records. The 
commission not only corrected the 
record, but also recommended repara-
tions for the survivors and their de-
scendants. To date, they have not re-
ceived 
any—mind 
you, 
any—direct 
compensation. 
Up until recently, the silence in 
Tulsa, in Oklahoma, and in the United 
States about this massacre was an in-
tentional effort to whitewash our Na-
tion’s racialized past. But we must re-
member these stories. We must tell the 
truth about our past. 
I introduced H. Con. Res. 19 to estab-
lish a National Truth, Racial Healing, 
and Transformation Commission to 
usher in this moment of truth to begin 
to examine and lift up to the public as 
the historical record of the history and 
legacy of slavery and how it is mani-
fested today in systemic racism as it 
relates to African Americans. 
But telling the truth is not enough. 
We must pass H.R. 40, sponsored by 
Congresswoman SHEILA JACKSON LEE. 
And I am a proud cosponsor of H.R. 40, 
which is the Commission to Study and 
Develop Reparation Proposals for Afri-
can Americans to address and repair 
the material harm done by instances 
like the Tulsa Greenwood massacre. 
I am pleased to say that my home 
State of California is leading the Na-
tion in this effort, being the first State 
to pass a law to establish a task force 
to study and develop reparation pro-
posals. 
Black Tulsans have still not recov-
ered from the impact of the Tulsa 
Greenwood massacre. Decades of dis-
crimination following the massacre 
prevented the community from re-
building their economic vitality. Black 
Tulsans are still over two times more 
likely to be unemployed than their 
White counterparts, and their commu-
nities are the least likely to attract 
businesses and large employers. Poli-
cies like redlining and local ordinances 
have prevented growth. 
The legacy of the massacre continues 
to impact Black Tulsans today. We 
cannot forget and we cannot let the 
Nation forget about the Tulsa Green-
wood massacre. 
H.R. 40 is a bill that we need to move 
forward to begin to repair the damage 
of the historical facts of the legacy of 
enslaved Africans brought to this coun-
try, who, quite frankly, in spite of our 
progress, still have not achieved lib-
erty and justice for all. 
Mr. TORRES of New York. Madam 
Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from 
Georgia (Mr. JOHNSON). 
Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Madam 
Speaker, I thank Congressman TORRES 
for anchoring this very important Spe-
cial Order hour today. 
I also want to extend my deepest con-
dolences to the chair of the Congres-
sional Black Caucus and my friend, the 
Honorable JOYCE BEATTY, who lost her 
dear husband a few days ago. He passed 
away. He was a fine public servant and 
a fine civil rights champion, and he 
will be missed. We are there in prayer 
and in spirit with our dear sister. 
It has been said that sunlight is the 
best 
disinfectant, 
yet 
the 
terrible 
atrocity that took place in Tulsa, 
Oklahoma, 100 years ago, on May 31 
and June 1 of 1921, has lived in the 
shadows for far too long. It is time that 
the truth be told. We must know our 
past or we are bound to repeat it. 
In 1921, the Black community in 
Tulsa, Oklahoma, was prospering, de-
spite a racist system designed to 
marginalize and exclude it and its resi-
dents from the fruits of those citizens’ 
labor. It was a community known as 
Greenwood, and it was also known as 
the Black Wall Street. 
It was a thriving community. There 
were restaurants, grocery stores, ho-
tels, theaters, banks, insurance compa-
nies, all owned by Black people. This 
community was self-sufficient. It was 
prospering, despite the fact that seg-
regation was the norm and the lynch-
ing of Black men was as common as 
the white hoods of the KKK. 
The simple fact is this: The Black 
community was succeeding in Tulsa, so 
White people burned it down. White su-
premacy and Jim Crow were the sparks 
that lit the fire. The massacre occurred 
over a 24-hour period, from May 30 to 
June 1 of 1921. And it all began like so 
many other racially motivated events: 
A false allegation against a Black man. 
In response, a White mob of thou-
sands shot, beat, and murdered Black 
residents, and they did it with impu-
nity. 
b 1945 
They looted Black homes and busi-
nesses and set fires in their wake, this 
White mob. They were aided and abet-
ted by the National Guard and also 
deputized 
killers, 
looters, 
and 
arsonists. 
Twenty-four hours after the violence 
began, 35 city blocks lay in ruins. Not 
a single dwelling or business or build-
ing was left standing. 
Within months of the Greenwood 
massacre, the KKK’s Tulsa chapter be-
came one of the Nation’s largest, be-
cause what better recruiting tool than 
plundering and killing Blacks with im-
punity? 
No person has ever been held ac-
countable on the State, local, or Fed-
eral level, in the criminal courts, or in 
the civil courts for the atrocities com-
mitted against the Black community 
and the Black people of Greenwood in 
Tulsa, Oklahoma. 
And here we are today, 100 years 
later, still challenged by state-sanc-
tioned violence against Black people. 
Some things have changed, but some 
things remain the same. 
The events of January 6, when Con-
federate flags flew inside and out of the 
Capitol, and where a hangman’s noose 
was draped over a functional gallows 
constructed on the Capitol Grounds to 
intimidate and terrorize, that proves 
that not much has changed. 
And I stand here today to tell you 
that we have had enough. It is time to 
fix America and rid racism from its 
soil. We must fix our country, and that 
starts with examining our past and 
looking at how we can heal together as 
a Nation, and, yes, reparation. Justice 
delayed is justice denied, and Black 
Americans in this country have been 
denied justice for far too long. Enough 
is enough. 
At this time, I would like to read 
from the Tulsa Historical Society and 
Museum 
website. 
It 
is 
at 
TulsaHistory.org. I want to read the 
following information that it pub-
lishes, which comes from the 2001 Tulsa 
Race Riot Commission report. 
‘‘On the morning of May 30, 1921, a 
young Black man named Dick Rowland 
riding in the elevator at the Drexel 
Building at Third and Main with a 
White woman named Sarah Page. The 
details of what followed vary from per-
son to person. Accounts of an incident 
circulated among the city’s White com-
munity during the day and became 
more exaggerated with each telling. 
‘‘Tulsa police arrested Rowland the 
following day and began an investiga-
tion. An inflammatory report in the 
May 31 edition of the Tulsa Tribune 
spurred a confrontation between Black 
and White armed mobs around the 
courthouse where the sheriff and his 
men had barricaded the top floor to 
protect Rowland. Shots were fired, and 
the outnumbered African Americans 
began retreating to the Greenwood dis-
trict. 
‘‘In the early morning hours of June 
1, 1921, Greenwood was looted and 
burned by White rioters,’’ as they are 
called. ‘‘Governor Robertson declared 
martial law, and National Guard troops 
arrived in Tulsa. Guardsmen assisted 
firemen in putting out fires, took Afri-
can Americans out of the hands of vigi-
lantes and imprisoned,’’ locked them 
up, ‘‘all Black Tulsans not already in-
terned. Over 6,000 people were held at 
the convention hall and the fair-
grounds, some for as long as 8 days. 
‘‘Twenty-four hours after the vio-
lence erupted, it ceased. In the wake of 
the violence, 35 city blocks laid in 
charred ruins, more than 800 people 
were treated for injuries, and contem-
porary reports of deaths began at 36. 
Historians now believe as many as 300 
people may have died. 
‘‘In order to understand the Tulsa 
Race Massacre, it is important to un-
derstand the complexities of the times. 
Dick Rowland, Sarah Page, and an un-
known gunman were the sparks that 
ignited a long-smoldering fire. Jim 
Crow, jealousy, white supremacy, and 
land lust all played roles in leading up 
to the destruction and loss of life on 
May 31 and June 1, 1921. . . .

‘‘Black Tulsans had every reason to 
believe that Dick Rowland would be 
lynched after his arrest. His charges 
were later dismissed and highly suspect 
from the start. They had cause to be-
lieve that his personal safety, like the 
defense of themselves and their com-
munity, depended on them alone. As 
hostile groups gathered and their con-
frontation worsened, municipal and 
county authorities failed to take ac-
tions to calm or contain the situation. 
‘‘At the eruption of violence, civil of-
ficials selected many men, all of them 
White and some of them participants in 
that violence, and made those men 
their agents as deputies. In that capac-
ity, deputies did not stem the violence 
but added to it, often through overt 
acts that were themselves illegal. Pub-
lic officials provided firearms and am-
munition to individuals, again, all of 
them White. Units of the Oklahoma 
National Guard participated in the 
mass arrests of all or nearly all of 
Greenwood’s residents. 
‘‘They removed them to other parts 
of the city and detained them in hold-
ing centers. Entering the Greenwood 
district, people stole, damaged, or de-
stroyed personal property left behind 
in homes and businesses. People, some 
of them agents of government, also de-
liberately burned or otherwise de-
stroyed homes credibly estimated to 
have numbered 1,256, along with vir-
tually every other structure—including 
churches, schools, businesses, even a 
hospital and library—in the Greenwood 
district. Despite duties to preserve 
order and to protect property, no gov-
ernment at any level offered adequate 
resistance, if any at all, to what 
amounted to the destruction of the 
Greenwood neighborhood. Although the 
exact total can never be determined, 
credible evidence makes it probable 
that many people, likely numbering 
between 100 to 300, were killed during 
the massacre.’’ 
I am reading to you from the report 
of the Tulsa commission that was set 
up by the city of Tulsa to report on the 
events that happened in Greenwood 100 
years ago. 
‘‘Not one of these criminal acts was 
then or ever has been prosecuted or 
punished by government at any level: 
municipal, county, State, or Federal. 
Even after the restoration of order, it 
was official policy to release a Black 
detainee only upon the application of a 
White person, and then only if that 
White person agreed to accept responsi-
bility for that detainee’s subsequent 
behavior. As private citizens, many 
Whites in Tulsa and neighboring com-
munities did extend invaluable assist-
ance to the massacre’s victims,’’ to 
their credit. 
‘‘Despite being numerically at a dis-
advantage, Black Tulsans fought val-
iantly to protect their homes, their 
businesses, and their community. But 
in the end, the city’s African-American 
population was simply outnumbered by 
the White invaders. In the end, the res-
toration of Greenwood after its system-
atic destruction was left to the victims 
of that destruction. While Tulsa offi-
cials turned away some offers of out-
side aid, a number of individual White 
Tulsans provided assistance to the 
city’s now virtually homeless Black 
population. . . . 
‘‘In recent years, there has been on-
going discussion about what to call the 
event that happened in 1921. Histori-
cally, it has been called the Tulsa Race 
Riot. Some say it was given that name 
at the time for insurance purposes. 
Designating it a riot prevented insur-
ance companies from having to pay 
benefits to the people of Greenwood 
whose homes and businesses were de-
stroyed.’’ 
Now, this is not me talking. I am 
still reading from that report. 
‘‘It also was common at the time for 
any large-scale clash between different 
racial or ethnic groups to be cat-
egorized a race riot. 
‘‘What do you think?’’ the report 
asks. 
‘‘Definition of ‘riot’: a tumultuous 
disturbance of the public peace by 
three or more persons assembled to-
gether and acting with common intent. 
‘‘Definition of ‘massacre’: the act or 
an instance of killing a number of usu-
ally helpless or unresisting human 
beings under circumstances of atrocity 
or cruelty.’’ 
So, that is why I personally refer to 
it as the Tulsa Greenwood massacre, as 
opposed to a race riot. 
Mr. TORRES of New York. Mr. 
Speaker, I thank Mr. JOHNSON for his 
deep insight and kind words earlier. 
Some background on Tulsa, Okla-
homa: The district of Greenwood in its 
time was famously described by Booker 
T. Washington as ‘‘Black Wall Street.’’ 
It was so named because it was the 
most vibrant and affluent African- 
American community in the United 
States. It was an oasis of opportunity 
in a desert of du jour discrimination. 
For many African Americans in 
search of a better life, it was a prom-
ised land amid the broken promise of 
Reconstruction. It was home to 10,000 
residents. There were 30 vibrant res-
taurants, 45 vibrant grocers and meat 
markets. There was a 54-room hotel. 
There was a theater and a hospital. 
Black Wall Street was a self-con-
tained, self-sufficient community of 
Black wealth, a community of Black 
entrepreneurship and Black ownership. 
And Black Wall Street, at the hands 
of racial terrorism, at the hands of ra-
cial violence, the wealthiest Black 
community in the United States be-
came a scene of mass murder, looting, 
and arson. It became a scene of death, 
destruction, and displacement. Nothing 
was spared in the Tulsa Race Massacre. 
Churches, schools, and hospitals were 
burned down. Twelve thousand homes 
were burned down. Thirty-five blocks 
burned down. The Tulsa burning had a 
death toll of 300 and a displacement 
toll of 10,000. Ten thousand people lost 
their homes, their businesses, and their 
livelihoods. And 6,000 of those people 
were relegated to internment camps. 
Then, after the internment camps, 
Black professionals, Black business 
owners 
who 
lost 
everything, 
were 
forced to live in tents and shacks. It 
was the worst act of racial terrorism 
and one of the worst acts of domestic 
terrorism in the history of the United 
States. 
b 2000 
Now, I see a parallel between the 
Tulsa Race Massacre and January 6. 
The insurrection against the United 
States Congress on January 6 was not 
simply an attack on a physical struc-
ture, it was an expression of racial rage 
and resentment against multiracial de-
mocracy. And the same is true of the 
Tulsa Race Massacre. 
We have to recognize that the domes-
tic terrorism that we saw unfold on 
January 6 did not happen in a vacuum. 
It has a history, and that history in-
cludes the KKK; it includes Jim Crow, 
and, yes, it includes the Tulsa Race 
Massacre. And it is a scandal in Amer-
ica that most Americans have never 
heard of the Tulsa Race Massacre. 
Madam Speaker, as Congressman 
JOHNSON noted earlier, it has been re-
ferred to as a race riot, which is an at-
tempt to whitewash the white su-
premacist, domestic terrorism at the 
heart of the massacre. And so we are 
here to tell the truth about the Tulsa 
Greenwood Massacre because we see a 
proper revision of history away from 
whitewashing as part of our national 
reckoning with race in America. 
It is worth noting that in 2021, Black 
homeownership is at historic lows. The 
rate of Black homeownership is lower 
today than it was before the Fair Hous-
ing Act in the 1960s. The gap between 
Black and White homeownership has 
never been greater. According to the 
Federal Reserve, White households on 
average have eight times more wealth 
than Black households. And part of the 
reason is the Tulsa massacre, and the 
systemic racism that it represents. 
There is a racial income gap between 
White households and Black house-
holds, but there is an even greater 
wealth gap. And the wealth gap is not 
an accident, it is a product of public 
policy. It is a consequence of systemic 
racism. 
During the post-war era, we saw 
Black Americans systematically ex-
cluded from programs providing home-
ownership and higher education, which 
are the pillars of wealth-building. And 
if you have no home to own, then you 
have no home equity to build. And if 
you have no home equity to build, then 
you have no wealth to pass down from 
one generation to the next. 
And so, instead of realizing the 
dream of intergenerational wealth, too 
many 
Black 
Americans 
were 
con-
demned by public policy, condemned by 
systemic racism to the nightmare of 
intergenerational poverty. The Tulsa 
Race Massacre should be understood as 
a microcosm of what white supremacy 
has done to Black people and Black 
property, to Black business and Black

community. And the ghosts of Jim 
Crow, the ghosts of the Tulsa and 
Greenwood massacre hunts us till this 
day. 
I represent a neighborhood named 
Arthur Avenue in the Bronx, and many 
of the businesses on Arthur Avenue 
have been owned by the same family 
for more than 100 years, but those busi-
nesses—all of them are white. 
And I thought to myself, what if 
Black Wall Street had been left alone, 
had been left to survive and thrive. It 
may very well be the case that some of 
those businesses would have endured 
until 2021. We could have had busi-
nesses owned by Black families for 
more than a century had it not been 
for the racial terrorism that took hold 
in 1921. And we know that when it 
comes to business, longevity is often 
the basis for resilience. Established 
businesses which tend to be wealthier 
and whiter had greater resilience in the 
face of COVID–19; whereas, newer busi-
nesses, which tend to be Black and 
Brown, were too fragile to survive the 
cataclysm of COVID–19. 
In the first two months of the out-
break, 44 percent of Black businesses 
were wiped out, which raises the ques-
tion, what if Black Wall Street were 
left to thrive, and what if we could 
have had businesses that would have 
endured for more than a century and 
could have had the resilience, the lon-
gevity, to overcome even a cataclysmic 
event like COVID–19. 
Madam Speaker, I want to provide 
some more historic background, on 
May 31–June 1, 1921, a White mob at-
tacked America’s Black Wall Street, 
the Greenwood district of Tulsa, Okla-
homa, and what is known as the Tulsa- 
Greenwood Race Massacre. The White 
mob of thousands of people shot and 
murdered Black residents, looted their 
homes and businesses, and burned more 
than 1,000 homes, churches, schools, 
and businesses. Not only did local au-
thorities and law enforcement fail to 
maintain civil order and protect Tul-
sa’s Black residents, some government 
agents aided the White mob in carrying 
out the massacre. 
Many of the residents who fled the 
massacre were detained in internment 
camps immediately following the mas-
sacre. And local officials later made, 
and ultimately failed, an attempt to 
block the ability of the Black commu-
nity to rebuild the Greenwood commer-
cial district by enacting a restrictive 
building ordinance. 
Less than a month after the mas-
sacre, a grand jury placed the blame 
entirely on the Black community and 
indicted 85 people—mostly African- 
Americans—with massacre-related of-
fenses. No White person was ever held 
individually accountable for crimes 
committed during the massacre, and 
the vast majority of survivors and 
their descendants were never directly 
compensated for these harms. 
So not only did a White lynch mob 
set the most vibrant, Black community 
on fire, but then the United States pro-
ceeded to whitewash the history of the 
Tulsa massacre, claiming that it was a 
race riot rather than the act of domes-
tic terrorism that it was and should al-
ways be seen as. No White person was 
held to account, and no Black person 
was made whole. 
Despite the acute challenges of rac-
ism in the late 19th and early 20th cen-
tury, Black residents have been able to 
create thriving community in the 
Greenwood District of Tulsa, Okla-
homa. However, this community was 
literally burned to the ground in one of 
the worst incidents of racial violence 
in American history. And to this day, 
no one has been truly held responsible. 
And it is worth noting, even though 
Greenwood has rebuilt itself, Green-
wood does have among the highest 
rates of poverty and unemployment in 
the city of Tulsa, which demonstrates 
the legacy of systemic racism, how 
hard it can be to overcome that legacy. 
The Tulsa Massacre resulted in prop-
erty damage valued anywhere from $25 
million to $100 million when adjusted 
in today’s dollars. As the descendants 
of the white mob that looted Tulsa 
businesses have had the opportunity to 
benefit from the wealth of their ances-
tors, many Black survivors of the 
Tulsa Massacre and their descendants 
have not been able to recoup the 
wealth that had been lost or destroyed 
during the massacre. 
Despite the Oklahoma Commission to 
study the race massacre of 1921 stating, 
‘‘Reparations to the historic Green-
wood community in real and tangible 
form would be good public policy and 
do much to repair the emotional and 
physical scars of this terrible incident 
in our shared past.’’ Despite that find-
ing, neither the State of Oklahoma nor 
the city of Tulsa has provided direct 
compensation to survivors or their de-
scendants. 
Discrimination 
against 
Black 
Tulsans did not end following the mas-
sacre. Over the local decades, local or-
dinances to prevent rebuilding, red-
lining, urban renewal, and slum clear-
ance, gentrification, highway construc-
tion, tearing apart communities. 
I will offer a note of personal reflec-
tion. I represent the South Bronx, 
which has been ravaged by a racist 
highway known as the Cross Bronx Ex-
pressway. It was built by Robert Moses 
and largely funded by Federal dollars. 
And the Cross Bronx Expressway has 
left behind decades of displacement and 
environmental degradation. 
There are children who are born in 
the Bronx who live near the Cross 
Bronx Expressway, who breathe in pol-
lutants every day that cause res-
piratory disease and cardiovascular 
disease. And we saw those diseases be-
come lethal during COVID–19. 
As a son of the Bronx, I was often in 
three places. I was at home, I was at 
school, and I was in the emergency 
room, because I was repeatedly hos-
pitalized for asthma. And the asthma 
epidemic in the Bronx, again, is not an 
accident. It is a consequence of the 
Cross Bronx Expressway, which is both 
literally and metaphorically a struc-
ture of racism. The South Bronx has a 
childhood asthma hospitalization rate 
that is double to three times the na-
tional average. 
So like the South Bronx, the neigh-
borhood of Greenwood has its own rac-
ist highway. And one of the most excit-
ing features of the American Jobs Plan 
is a proposed $20 billion fund that 
would rebuild neighborhoods that have 
been divided and devastated by the 
structural racism of highways. And I 
hope neighborhoods like Greenwood 
and the South Bronx will benefit from 
our national reckoning with race. 
The impact of the massacre and the 
ongoing systemic discrimination is 
clear when you compare North Tulsa, 
where many Black residents of Tulsa 
now live, to other areas. North Tulsan 
residents are significantly poorer than 
residents in other parts of the city. 
There are fewer businesses and large- 
scale employers in North Tulsa than in 
other cities. 
According to a 2018 city study, North 
Tulsa had the fewest jobs of any region 
of Tulsa. The unemployment rate is 
2.37 percent times higher for Black 
Tulsans than for White Tulsans. The 
lowest life expectancy in Tulsa occurs 
in the poorest regions with the great-
est concentration of Black residents. 
The United States has a responsi-
bility to both acknowledge the harm 
caused by the Tulsa Massacre and to 
enact legal remedies and policy pro-
posals to compensate survivors and 
their descendants. And as many of you 
know, there is no greater champion of 
making the victims of systemic racism 
whole, no greater champion of repara-
tions than the chair of our Special 
Order hour, Congress Member JACKSON 
LEE. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tlewoman from Texas (Ms. JACKSON 
LEE). 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, 
I thank the gentleman from New York 
from illustrating, elaborating on, de-
tailing, and bringing to the 21st cen-
tury the horrors of the Tulsa race 
riots, calling it what it is and not being 
fearful of acknowledging the riotist 
and violent impact of the Tulsa race 
riots. 
Madam Speaker, it is my honor to 
now continue the discussion on behalf 
of the Congressional Black Caucus and 
my cochair of the Special Order hour, 
the Honorable Congressman TORRES of 
New York. 
Let me, first of all, thank our chair, 
Chairwoman BEATTY, for matching her 
members with this process of ensuring 
that the history, the unbiased history 
of a people in all of our variations is 
told truthfully. 
b 2015 
We, too, are Americans. The Tulsan 
residents of that time were Americans 
as well. 
I am reminded of the early stages of 
my 
education.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H2411 
May 17, 2021 
TORRES’ history was the Nina, the 
Pinta, and the Santa Maria, I could al-
most repeat that in my sleep, the three 
ships that came with Christopher Co-
lumbus. He was the founder of Amer-
ica—over and over again. 
I’m not sure during the period of our 
early childhood and those of recent 
vintage learned anything of Native 
American 
history, 
Korean-American 
history, Japanese-American, Chinese- 
American, African-American, slavery. I 
don’t know if our children in periods of 
the 20th century and now in the 21st 
century knew there was more history. 
I do know that the past President 
wanted the Smithsonian, the African- 
American culture, to stop teaching 
about African history. I know that 
there was a challenge to the U.S. De-
partment of Education by Minority 
Leader MCCONNELL, to stop teaching 
the 1619 Project. It baffles me because 
I believe that, if a country or a people 
know its history, we will not be 
doomed to repeat the past. 
When I say ‘‘a people,’’ America is 
represented by many people. If we 
knew each other’s history, if we under-
stood each other’s history, could we 
not—even if not those who are already 
past understanding, but could our chil-
dren grow up with empathy and under-
standing? 
That is why we are here on the floor 
of the House. We are not here to casti-
gate and to throw untruthful hits. We 
are here to tell the truth. 
Madam Speaker, tears come to my 
eyes as a series—and I only get to look 
at television late in the night, after all 
the day’s work is done, and there is a 
series called ‘‘The Underground Rail-
road.’’ You cannot look at that without 
shaking in your boots, shaking in the 
chair you are sitting in, tears coming 
to your eyes. 
That is the empathy that America 
can understand for all the journeys 
that so many of us have taken. We 
have taken it, and we are here in this 
place. The greatest experiment that 
the world watches. 
Can they make it? 
They were watching it from Abraham 
Lincoln’s Emancipation Proclamation, 
1863, and then General Granger in 1865. 
They watched us through the 1800s. 
We 
failed. 
Reconstruction 
did 
not 
work. Even with all the Governors and 
Congress people that had been elected 
are freed slaves. That ugly head of rac-
ism, white supremacy, lynching, the 
tearing asunder of Black communities, 
the still tearing apart of families, the 
lynching of men and women who went 
off to the grocery store—when I say 
that, the local store, whatever it was 
down the road—and never came back. 
In 1921—boy, I am just so proud of 
this picture—this is bustling Tulsa, 
Oklahoma. This is the example of the 
excitement. I am reading where it says 
the McGowan Variety Store. There are 
some McGowans in Houston. They 
might be related. These are the pranc-
ing people with their cowboy hats on. 
It looks as if students, just like we 
would see in our neighborhoods today 
or in our high schools today, dancers, 
they had a full holistic community. 
There is some cars on the street. 
Can you imagine 1921? 
Oh, I wish I could just take a trip 
back, just stand on the sidewalk, and 
just look with pride of history I did not 
know. I never imagined there were cit-
ies like Tulsa, Oklahoma, as I was 
growing up as a child. I never imagined 
we had anything, we were worth any-
thing, except for what my mother and 
father and grandparents poured into 
me. 
My big mother, which was my great- 
grandmother, owned property obvi-
ously destroyed by the highways and 
freeways that came in and took it 
away in St. Petersburg, Florida. I just 
thought that was our way of life. Just 
like I thought riding in the back of a 
train going south to visit her, sitting 
by my lonely with a bag of fried chick-
en—that is right, I am not embar-
rassed—to carry me through to visit 
my grandmother in St. Petersburg, 
Florida. Thank God, I got there safely. 
I was just about 8 or 9 or 10, and I was 
sitting in the colored car, and I wasn’t 
supposed to move except for necessary 
purposes. 
I didn’t know—I didn’t know I could 
come here and see this. And our chil-
dren don’t know it. That is why we are 
on the floor today. We are on the floor 
today because we have to begin to em-
brace each other’s story. 
So I am very delighted that I am 
leading on H. Res. 398, embraced by the 
Congressional Black Caucus. This will 
be on the floor of the House this com-
ing Wednesday. And my counterpart in 
the United States Senate is a very dear 
friend, Senator ELIZABETH
WARREN, 
who believes in this resolution, that is 
the recognizing of the forthcoming cen-
tennial, the 1921 Tulsa Race Massacre. 
And it doesn’t say ‘‘riot.’’ It says ‘‘mas-
sacre.’’ It was a massacre. 
I Thank the House leadership. I 
thank them for their understanding 
the value and importance of this as we 
lead into June and begin to move on 
H.R. 40, the Commission to Study and 
Develop Reparation Proposals. It is 
nothing harmful. There is nothing that 
will undermine anyone. It is to accept 
what happened. 
So I am so grateful we have almost 
100 cosponsors, and maybe more to 
come into the next 24 hours, for a story 
that was never told. 
Oh, yes, as a little Black girl, I could 
tell you about Columbus, tell you 
about Abraham Lincoln, tell you about 
George Washington. And most of them 
today in the 21st century, they are not 
hearing about the wide diversity of our 
history, Madam Speaker—yours and 
mine and the many people that are on 
this side of the aisle or that side of the 
aisle. 
So let me just recount very briefly 
again. A century ago, White rioters, 
local law enforcement, and self-ap-
pointed vigilantes claim to be acting 
reasonably and in self-defense against 
what they feared was an upcoming 
Black uprising. 
Same as January 6, where there are 
people who had the audacity to say it 
looked like tourists on any normal 
day, when we were laying flat on the 
floor in this building while banging and 
screams and guns drawn on this side of 
that door. We didn’t know whether we 
would live. And a lifesaving shot for 
that person who did not know what was 
happening, attempting to save lives. 
Sadly, someone lost their life. 
Members in near panic—rightly so— 
leaving these Chambers and walking 
down and seeing AK–47s in the hands of 
individuals laying flat on the ground, 
that our brave officers had under their 
watch. 
Yes, rioters. But in Greenwood, I 
want this picture to be embedded in 
your DNA, because you will see eco-
nomic prosperity, self-sufficiency. Yes, 
it was known as the Black Wall Street. 
They viewed, however, black males as 
fearsome, physical threats to their per-
sonal safety, and the rivals of White 
women. I don’t know what happened in 
an elevator, allegedly. The story, you 
know, it is always a mystery, but some 
claim of some insult that occurred. 
And all of a sudden the word went 
out enraging leaders of the White com-
munity, fine citizens, probably in some 
church over the weekend. When I say 
in their church in that time, because 
they were always using the Bible 
wrongly and incorrectly. And I will say 
that because I believe in a merciful re-
demptive Jesus, as a Christian. There 
are many other faiths, Torah and 
Koran and others. 
But I know in the redemptive faith of 
Christianity, we believe in redemption. 
We don’t go out because we know that 
we have had one to sacrifice for us on 
the cross so that we might be re-
deemed. We sing that song in our com-
munity, ‘‘Let the Redeemed Say So.’’ 
But apparently they didn’t have that 
memory. 
100,000 Black people lived in that 
area, sold luxury items. Twenty-one 
restaurants, 30 grocery stores, a hos-
pital, savings and loan, a post office, 
three hotels, jewelry and clothing, two 
movie theaters, a library, pool halls, 
bus and cab service, a nationally recog-
nized school system. A nationally rec-
ognized school system, when all of us 
are fighting for our children to be edu-
cated. 
Today, I left Houston. And guess 
what? We have a new resident of Texas: 
Curtis Jackson, known as 50 Cent. 
We were standing together because 
he was producing with Mayor Turner 
and Al Kashani and the School Super-
intendent Grenita Lathan, and all 
elected officials to announce an entre-
preneurial program. 
Can you imagine, to be able to build 
up our children? 
They had two Black newspapers, six 
private planes. And I want to say it 
again, a recognized school system. 
On May 31 of that year, 35 city blocks 
went up in flames and 300 persons were

murdered and, to my knowledge, buried 
in an unmarked grave; 800 were injured 
and 9,000 were left homeless. 
Yes, one cannot ignore this history, 
but it has been ignored, it has been 
snuffed out, it has been put under. 
I never knew about it until people 
like Dr. Crutcher, from this great city, 
and various leaders that have brought 
to our attention even more. But over 
the years, obviously, in my study of 
reparations, I have seen the insults 
that have happened when no one both-
ered to respond. 
Brutality that we are now trying to 
correct by acknowledging in H. Res. 
398, and I hope my colleagues will come 
to the floor of the House to be able to 
address it. 
Let me show you what that massacre 
generated, and you will understand. 
Madam Speaker, how much time is 
remaining? 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tlewoman has 7 minutes remaining. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, 
you saw the bustling town. You saw 
the bustling town. This is a charred 
Negro who suffered in the Tulsa riots. 
Yes, I am like Emmett Till’s mother, 
Let the world see it. This is what hap-
pened to an innocent Black person. 
By the way, the dead included chil-
dren. Tulsa Historical Society. This is 
America. And this is a story that we 
failed to tell. This is what happened. 
We have more stories to tell. We be-
lieve that a picture is worth a thou-
sands words. We can never, never over-
come that burned, charred body. 
I showed you what Tulsa looked like, 
the Black Wall Street, and the burned- 
out ruins of Greenwood. Tulsa, Okla-
homa library—they even got it in the 
library. I don’t know how many people 
have seen it. It is a wasteland, a literal 
wasteland. Smoke is coming up. Peo-
ple’s homes are gone. Wealth is gone. 
People were never to be presented with 
any relief. None. I don’t even think 
they got a thank-you—not even a 
thank-you. 
So our resolution condemns violence 
and destruction perpetrated against 
the African-American community of 
Greenwood. Our resolution has a rejec-
tion and active opposition to the false 
ideology of white supremacy and con-
demnation of all groups. Our resolution 
believes in promoting tolerance and 
unity, and taking action to ensure gov-
ernmental policies and action to pro-
mote tolerance and unity. 
Our resolution is calling for all 
Americans to celebrate the ethnic, ra-
cial, and religious diversity that has 
made the United States great. Our res-
olution encourages all persons of the 
United States to reflect upon the his-
tory of the United States as an imper-
fect but committed journey to estab-
lish a more perfect union. Our resolu-
tion is recognized as a commitment of 
Congress to acknowledge and learn 
from the history of racism and racial 
violence in the United States. 
Our resolution lays the groundwork 
for moving to H.R. 40, the Commission 
to Study and Develop Reparation Pro-
posals, because we can see it in real 
life. 
b 2030 
So this is part of the Tulsa that 
never got acknowledged. 
Madam Speaker, let me show you ad-
ditional fires so you can see the build-
ings going up in smoke. We are not 
making it up. All of these buildings— 
brick buildings—were burned to the 
ground. 
Can you imagine someone who sur-
vived the post-traumatic stress, the 
horrors of their life, the willingness 
not to live anymore, and the giving up 
of hope? 
People wonder, oh, those lazy Ne-
groes and colored people who worked 
for over 250 years in bondage. 
Finally, I am going to put the picture 
of the slaves, the individuals. So this is 
the story we tell tonight. We don’t 
even tell it with a sense of vengeance. 
We tell it with a sense of dignity, re-
spect, and honor. The courage of those 
people, and the genius of those people— 
they weren’t even freed slaves for 100 
years and look what they created. 
There is a story on CNN: ‘‘My great- 
grandmother survived the 1921 Tulsa 
massacre. We are not heeding her his-
tory.’’ For what was once the wealthi-
est Black neighborhood in America be-
came charred ash in a matter of hours. 
But we have not come to a conclusion 
to end this kind of White supremacy 
and racism. 
Madam Speaker, I include this in the 
RECORD. 
[From CNN, May 14, 2021] 
OPINION: MY GREAT-GRANDMOTHER SURVIVED 
THE
1921
TULSA
MASSACRE. WE’RE
NOT 
HEEDING HER HISTORY 
A century ago, my Black brothers and sis-
ters were decimated by one of the worst oc-
currences of racial violence in our nation’s 
history. On May 31 and June 1, 1921, White 
gangs flooded into the thriving Greenwood 
neighborhood and murdered up to 300 Black 
men, women and children. According to the 
Tulsa Historical Society, 1,500 Black homes 
were burned, along with over 600 businesses, 
and places of worship, healing, learning and 
gathering. 
My great-grandmother, Rebecca Brown 
Crutcher—a woman who was the picture of 
Black excellence—lived and worked in the 
Greenwood community. But in 1921, she fled 
in fear of her life as White Tulsans burned 
her neighborhood to the ground. 
What was once the wealthiest Black neigh-
borhood in America became charred ash in a 
matter of hours. 10,000 Black residents were 
left homeless—and an entire generation of 
Black Tulsans were robbed of their wealth 
and prosperity they had built. To this day, 
not one person has ever been held account-
able and not a single cent of reparations has 
been paid to the survivors or the victims’ de-
scendants. 
Without this necessary reckoning with the 
past, we’re already repeating it. As Okla-
homa and many around the world are pre-
paring to mark the centennial of the 1921 
Tulsa Race Massacre, last month, Oklahoma 
Governor Kevin Stitt signed a law criminal-
izing peaceful protesters and giving immu-
nity to drivers who ‘‘unintentionally’’ kill or 
injure protesters. This law is, according to 
the count kept by the International Center 
for Not-For-Profit Law, just one of 81 anti- 
protest bills introduced in 34 states during 
the 2021 legislative session alone—most of 
them framed as a response to last summer’s 
Black Lives Matter protests. But instead of 
tackling the root causes of these nationwide 
protests against police brutality, racism and 
anti-Blackness, many lawmakers are at-
tempting to intimidate, malign and crim-
inalize peaceful protesters. 
Laws like this one will undoubtedly have 
painful and long-lasting consequences in 
Oklahoma and the rest of the nation. Black, 
brown and Indigenous people will surely be 
locked up, ripped apart from their families, 
and may lose their jobs for exercising their 
First Amendment right to peacefully assem-
ble in a protest. They will surely receive 
harsher punishments for protesting police 
brutality and racial injustice than, for in-
stance, White protesters demonstrating for 
gun rights or for their desire to control a 
woman’s body. 
This isn’t the only bill introduced in Okla-
homa this session that’s followed the Tulsa 
Race Massacre’s sinister legacy of suppres-
sion and erasure of Black Oklahomans. Half 
a dozen bills have already been introduced to 
restrict absentee voting and require identi-
fication to vote, echoing the growing trend 
of voting restrictions around the country. 
Historically in our state as elsewhere, these 
tactics have been used to disenfranchise 
Black and brown, poor and older commu-
nities and people with disabilities, with the 
precedent being set in one state and spread-
ing like wildfire to the rest of the country. 
On May 7, Governor Stitt signed HB 1775 
into law, which will prohibit Oklahoma 
schools from teaching critical race theory— 
or in other words important lessons about 
systemic racism and diversity. The measure 
is meant to essentially stifle important dis-
cussions about, among other things, the 1921 
Tulsa Race Massacre, the Trail of Tears and 
the Osage murders in classrooms and beyond. 
Erasing our history, yet again, will have dev-
astating consequences. And Oklahoma isn’t 
alone—bills banning or restricting the teach-
ing of critical race theory have been drafted 
in Iowa, Louisiana, Missouri, New Hamp-
shire, Oklahoma, Rhode Island, and West 
Virginia and already passed in Utah, Arkan-
sas, Idaho and Tennessee. 
Bills like HB 1775 attempt to obscure the 
fact that heinous instances of racial vio-
lence, from slavery to Jim Crow laws to the 
1921 Tulsa Race Massacre, are not blemishes 
on our history but consequences of discrimi-
natory systems that continue to harm Black 
people today. 
Such laws are designed to prevent a full 
and honest accounting of how systemic rac-
ism works. The bill says it will prohibit the 
teaching that ‘‘an individual, by virtue of his 
or her race or sex, bears responsibility for 
actions committed in the past by other 
members of the same race or sex,’’ thereby 
upholding White supremacy and helping ab-
solve the city of Tulsa and the state of the 
moral obligation of paying reparations to 
the survivors and descendants of the Tulsa 
Race Massacre. HB 1775 also flies in the face 
of reality—as if the wealth and security 
stripped from Black Tulsans a century ago 
doesn’t have a direct relationship to the wid-
ening gaps in home ownership, education, 
life expectancy and arrest rates today. 
Each of us should learn the hard lessons of 
the 1921 Tulsa Race Massacre and the contin-
ued harm shouldered by the survivors, the 
descendants and the neighborhood of Green-
wood. We should learn that race, racism and 
discrimination have very real, concrete ef-
fects on our history, our culture, our politics 
and our current lives. But we can’t learn the 
truth or grow from it if it’s hidden from us— 
and that’s precisely what HB 1775 attempts

to do. In so doing, this measure continues 
the harm of the 1921 Tulsa Race Massacre, 
because a century later, Stitt and our elect-
ed officials are still trying to bury the les-
sons that our ancestors would want us to 
carry forward. 
As a descendant of a Tulsa Race Massacre 
survivor, it’s painful to see Oklahoma’s gov-
ernor refuse to learn from our history and 
acknowledge its continuing impact today. 
Instead, he’s chosen to saddle our teachers 
and educators with even more baggage, and 
potentially penalize them for doing what’s 
right. 
My hope is that our teachers will look this 
evil in the eye and refuse to give in or back 
down. I hope they will continue teaching the 
truth about topics like the 1921 Tulsa Race 
Massacre—including that it was borne from 
White supremacy, a mortal threat to our de-
mocracy that remains with us today. Our 
students deserve the unbridled truth, not a 
polished facade that makes us feel good 
about ourselves. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, 
I include the KJRH article in the 
RECORD. 
[From KJRH] 
GOV. STITT RESPONDS TO LETTER FROM TULSA 
RACE MASSACRE COMMISSION 
TULSA, OK, May 14, 2021.—Gov. Kevin Stitt 
has officially been removed from the 1921 
Tulsa Race Massacre Centennial Commis-
sion. 
This comes after Stitt signed a bill lim-
iting race and gender curriculums in Okla-
homa schools earlier in May. House Bill 1775 
prohibits state public schools, colleges, and 
universities from incorporating certain mes-
sages about sex and race into any course in-
struction. 
This also comes on the 100th anniversary 
of the 1921 Tulsa race massacre, where a 
white mob attacked Black residents and 
businesses in the Greenwood District of 
Tulsa, also known as Black Wall Street. 
The governor’s office released the fol-
lowing statement Friday afternoon: 
‘‘Governor Stitt’s role as a member of the 
1921 Tulsa Race Massacre Centennial Com-
mission has been purely ceremonial and he 
had not been invited to attend a meeting 
until this week. It is disappointing to see an 
organization of such importance spend so 
much effort to sow division based on false-
hoods and political rhetoric two weeks be-
fore the centennial and a month before the 
commission is scheduled to sunset. The gov-
ernor and first lady will continue to support 
the revitalization of the Greenwood District, 
honest conversations about racial reconcili-
ation and pathways of hope in Oklahoma.’’ 
The commission sent 2 News the following 
statement: 
‘‘The 1921 Tulsa Race Massacre Centennial 
Commissioners met Tuesday and agreed 
through consensus to part ways with Gov-
ernor Stitt. No elected officials, nor rep-
resentatives of elected officials, were in-
volved in this decision. While the Commis-
sion is disheartened to part ways with Gov-
ernor Stitt, we are thankful for the things 
accomplished together. The Commission re-
mains focused on lifting up the story of 
Black Wall Street and commemorating the 
Centennial. With just weeks before the Cen-
tennial of one of the worst Race massacres in 
the history of the U.S., Commissioners stand 
united in focusing time, energy and efforts 
on descendants, survivors, education, eco-
nomic development and progress this year 
and beyond. We hope to see many of you in 
person or virtually at some of our events 
that we hope will drive change for years to 
come.’’ 
The commission previously issued Stitt a 
letter after he did not join a special meeting 
Monday night to discuss the signing of HB 
1775 into law. 
Phil Armstrong, the project director of the 
1921 Tulsa Race Massacre Centennial Com-
mission, said HB 1775 ‘‘chills the ability of 
educators to teach students, of any age, and 
will only serve to intimidate educators who 
seek to reveal and process our hidden his-
tory. You know that. We delivered this mes-
sage to you before you signed the measure. 
We were joined by educators, school boards, 
universities, faith, and community leaders, 
all of whom vigorously objected to HB 1775. 
You seemingly disregarded and dismissed 
this chorus of voices aligned against HB 
1775.’’ 
The governor responded by saying, in part, 
‘‘it is disappointing that some commission 
members feel that a common-sense law pre-
venting students from being taught that one 
race or sex is superior to another is contrary 
to the mission of reconciliation and restora-
tion.’’ 
C.J. Webber-Neal, president of the Green-
wood Arts & Cultural Society, INC., also 
called for the governor’s resignation as a 
commission 
member. 
In 
a 
statement, 
Webber-Neal said he was satisfied with hav-
ing Stitt removed from the commission. 
‘‘The Greenwood Arts & Cultural Society, 
INC. is very pleased that the 1921 Tulsa Race 
Massacre Centennial Commission has with 
one concise voice taken action to remove 
Kevin Stitt, Governor of Oklahoma, from it 
body. 
Based upon the stated mission of this body, 
we stand in solidarity with their action re-
garding Governor Stitt’s role as a member of 
this Commission, based upon his signing of 
HB 1775 into law. The truth of the horrific 
story of 1921’s Race Massacre (as well as 
other history of the experiences of minori-
ties in America) must be taught honestly 
and unequivocally, so that future genera-
tions will learn of the demons of our past so 
we as a society will not be doomed to repeat 
this evil act. 
At this time, we also encourage this body 
to add in the Governor’s place survivors and 
descendants of the massacre, so that rep-
resentation of this painful period in our his-
tory can be reflected thru the experiences of 
those who were directly impacted by this 
tragic event. 
Furthermore, we encourage any available 
monetary relief be given by this organization 
to the three survivors of the 1921 Tulsa Race 
Massacre. This should be done as both a sign 
of reconciliation and the rising of the eternal 
spirit of Greenwood. This we believe is long 
overdue.’’

Starting late on the evening on May 31 and 
continuing into the day of June 1, 1921, a 
White mob attacked the Greenwood district 
of Tulsa, Oklahoma, razing it to the ground. 
The 
attackers 
looted 
and 
intentionally 
burned an estimated 1,256 homes in Green-
wood—known as America’s ‘‘Black Wall 
Street’’—along with nearly all the district’s 
churches, schools, and businesses. 
The number of persons killed in the riot 
may never be known, but a 2001 report by Af-
rican Americans during this era lived under 
the ever-present threat of mass racial vio-
lence—which often took the form of White 
mobs invading Black communities. It was 
also during this period that thousands of Af-
rican Americans accused of crimes against 
White people—but particularly Black men 
accused of sexual assaulting White women— 
were summarily executed by White lynch 
mobs. Local authorities at the time often 
condoned or even participated in these 
extrajudicial killings or otherwise did little 
to nothing to stop them. 
Yet despite this national atmosphere, Tul-
sa’s Greenwood district thrived. Black work-
ers were mostly shut out of the booming oil 
industry driving Tulsa’s meteoric turn-of- 
the-century growth, so many working-class 
residents had to find work doing menial or 
domestic labor. Greenwood’s vibrant econ-
omy instead was driven mainly by residents’ 
entrepreneurial skills previously developed 
in the many all-Black towns that dotted the 
Oklahoma landscape. The range of Black- 
owned businesses located in Greenwood in-
cluded grand hotels, restaurants, theaters, 
pharmacies, diners, barbershops, and small 
mom-and-pop shops. Greenwood was also 
home to hundreds of professionals, including 
doctors, lawyers, and real estate agents. 
Many residents lived under conditions typ-
ical of the working-class in that era and 
subsisted without running water or elec-
tricity. The district’s more prosperous resi-
dents lived in modern houses befitting their 
middle and upper-class economic status. 
Simply put, by the time of the Massacre, the 
residents of Greenwood had created a thriv-
ing, and, in many ways economically self- 
sufficient, Black enclave. 
No African American had been lynched in 
Tulsa at the time of the Massacre. The 
threat of racially motivated violence, how-
ever, cast an everpresent shadow over the 
Greenwood district. Incidents of lynching oc-
curring across the country were heavily re-
ported in the local Black press. Editorials in 
local Black-owned newspapers in Tulsa pub-
lished the year or so leading up to the Mas-
sacre decried instances of ‘‘mob law’’ and 
prominent Greenwood residents advocated 
for armed African Americans to protect 
Black prisoners from White lynch mobs. 
Most saliently, the lynching of a White man 
in Tulsa and of a young African American 
man in Oklahoma City within the same week 
in the year proceeding the Massacre con-
vinced many Black Tulsans that local au-
thorities could not be counted on to protect 
a Black person accused of a serious crime 
against a White person. 
Notably—but unsurprisingly in segregated 
Tulsa—none of these Black viewpoints on 
lynching were reflected in the local White 
press, and likely few, if any White Tulsans 
regularly read Black-owned newspapers. In-
stead, the White-owned press focused at that 
time on crime and allegations of local cor-
ruption. An oil boomtown at the beginning 
of the Prohibition Era, Tulsa’s crime rate in 
the early 1920’s appeared to residents to be 
increasing. In particular, the city had gained 
a seedy reputation for illegal liquor and 
prostitution. 
For the most part during the period lead-
ing up to the Massacre, White-owned papers 
had not blamed African Americans for the 
apparent rise in crime, and crimes in Green-
wood did not receive a disproportionate 
amount of coverage. But only 10 days prior 
to the Massacre, a story focused White 
Tulsans’ attention on the then-racially in-
flammatory subject of relations between 
Black men and White women. On May 21, 
1921, a local story regarding a police inves-
tigation into the city’s prostitution quoted a 
former local judge blaming the problem on 
the hotels and ‘‘Negro pimps,’’ and recounted 
the testimony of a local clergyman that led 
a group of White men undercover who 
claimed that African American porters rou-
tinely offered them the services of White

prostitutes, and to have witnessed carousing 
between Black men and White women at a 
roadhouse just outside the city limits. 
To be clear, as this contemporary news-
paper story implies, the racism and preju-
dices of many White Tulsans tainted their 
perceptions of the Black community and the 
later events that set off the Massacre. De-
spite the fact that racial segregation laws 
were gaining ground statewide in Oklahoma, 
many White Tulsans appeared to fear that 
the color line was blurring and grew angry at 
instances where Black Tulsans challenged or 
ignored segregationist laws and practices. 
Further contributing to some White Tulsans’ 
racial grievances was resentment of Green-
wood’s most prosperous residents, a feeling 
that appears to have been exacerbated by a 
drop in oil prices and subsequent oil field 
layoffs that preceded the Massacre. In a 
deeply segregated city where Black residents 
could not work, live near, or socialize with 
their fellow residents as equals, many White 
Tulsans filled the vacuum created by the 
lack of racial equality and understanding 
with racism and prejudice. 
This local newspaper story, and another on 
a breakout at the jail printed a few days 
later (though containing no racial overtones) 
appeared to provide White Tulsans fed up 
with crime—and inflamed by racial preju-
dice—a convenient racial scapegoat for their 
frustrations, 
and 
contributed 
to 
long-
standing local conditions that had turned 
Tulsa into a powder keg waiting for a spark 
to ignite. 
The night of May 31, 1921, the spark was 
struck as Black Tulsans’ fear of a lynching 
appeared on the cusp of realization. That day 
police took into custody nineteen-year-old 
Dick Rowland, a Black man accused of sexu-
ally assaulting Sarah Page, a seventeen- 
year-old White elevator operator. After word 
of the allegations spread through Tulsa’s 
newspapers. One White-owned Tulsa paper 
ran an article entitled ‘‘Nab Negro for At-
tacking Girl in Elevator’’ and a number of 
eyewitnesses recall seeing a newspaper edi-
torial 
entitled 
‘‘To 
Lynch 
Negro—that 
evening a large White crowd began to gather 
around the courthouse jail where Rowland 
was being held. At the same time, several 
groups of Black Tulsans—many of whom 
were World War I veterans—resolved to pro-
tect the Black prisoner threatened by the 
mob. 
As the mob jeered the handful of deputy 
sheriffs guarding the courthouse, a group of 
25 Black Tulsans approached the beleaguered 
officers to offer their assistance. The local 
authorities quickly declined their offer, but 
the sight of armed Black men insistent on 
protecting Rowland from ‘‘mob law’’ proved 
too much for the thousand-strong White 
crowd. As the Black Tulsans returned to 
Greenwood assured of Rowland’s safety for 
the moment, some members of the White 
crowd left to obtain firearms from their 
homes. 
The Massacre began after a second group of 
around 75 armed Black Tulsans returned to 
the courthouse later that evening following 
reports that the White mob continued to 
grow even larger (later estimated at 2,000 in-
dividuals) and more agitated. They again of-
fered their assistance to local authorities 
guarding Rowland and were again rebuffed. 
This time, however, as they departed, ele-
ments of the White crowd accosted a Black 
World War I veteran with a racial slur and a 
demand for his weapon. When the veteran re-
fused, a scuffle broke out over the gun and 
shots were fired. 
While these shots could have been uninten-
tional, members of the White mob—and pos-
sibly some members of law enforcement 
present 
at 
the 
courthouse—immediately 
opened fire on all the Black men present. 
The Black Tulsans returned fire. While the 
initial shooting at the courthouse lasted 
only a few seconds, several street battles 
erupted among groups of Black and White 
Tulsans. The Black Tulsans—significantly 
outnumbered by the mob and fighting now 
for their own lives—engaged in a fighting re-
treated, exchanging gunfire with their White 
pursuers as they sought to return to the rel-
ative safety of the Greenwood district. 
In the immediate aftermath of the 
events at the courthouse, some Whites 
began making brief armed forays into 
Greenwood by car or committing indis-
criminate acts of looting, murder, and 
mayhem. Around 1:00 a.m. on June 1 
there began the first reports of fires 
being set. When the fire brigade an-
swered the call, armed Whites pre-
vented them from putting out the fires. 
By 4:00 a.m. more than two dozen 
Black-owned businesses had been de-
stroyed by flames. The worst destruc-
tion, however, had yet to come. 
As many of these events were occurring si-
multaneous and across a relative wide area 
of the city, confusion reigned as the night of 
May 31 became the early morning hours of 
June 1, 1921. Some Black residents resolved 
to defend their homes and businesses, taking 
up armed positions to defend Greenwood. 
Skirmishes broke out between armed Blacks 
and Whites at various points in the district 
in the early overnight hours. Other Black 
residents, rightly fearing the worst had yet 
to occur, began to leave the city—many es-
caped but some were killed. 
Still other Black residents thought the 
worst had already happened; that as far as 
they knew Dick Rowland had not been 
lynched, and—with the most intense skir-
mishing having abated by 2:00 a.m. according 
to one Black eyewitness—some of Green-
wood’s defenders even concluded that they 
had successfully fended off the attackers. 
Whites engaged in the attack also com-
mitted numerous other atrocities. According 
to one Black eyewitness, White looters mur-
dered a Black elderly disabled man who, de-
spite having expressed a willingness to do so, 
could not comply with their order to leave 
his home. According to one White eye-
witness, prominent Black surgeon Dr. A.C. 
Jackson was gunned down on his front lawn 
with his hands up after attempting to com-
ply with the White rioters. Another Black 
eyewitness recounted how he and 30 or 40 
other men who had surrendered to the riot-
ers were lined up and forced to run with 
hands over their heads to an interment cen-
ter located at Convention Hall, all while 
some of their White captors shot at their 
heels with guns. A group of White men even 
ran a car into the group, knocking over two 
or three of their number. In another horri-
fying display of brutality, a Black disabled 
homeless man was tied by his leg to a car 
and dragged by ‘‘white thugs’’ through the 
streets of the downtown business district 
where he panhandled. 
Many Black residents—including women 
with children or elderly family members in 
tow—were shot at in the streets as they at-
tempted to flee. Despite the ferocity of the 
attackers, many Black residents continued 
their armed resistance. Eventually, however, 
these defenders were overwhelmed by the 
sheer force of numbers and firepower of the 
White invaders. 
Of course, not all Tulsans shared the rac-
ism of the White rioters. There are several 
accounts of Whites hiding Black Tulsans 
fleeing the violence at farms or homes out-
side the city or standing up to White rioters 
who threatened them for sheltering Black 
acquaintances at their workplace. According 
to one account, a recent young Mexican im-
migrant named Maria Morales Gutierrez 
saved two Black children from being strafed 
by an airplane. She then later refused White 
rioters’ demands to hand the children over to 
them. She and the children survived. 
The assault and destruction of Greenwood 
lasted roughly until midday June 1, 1921, 
when martial law was declared. Around 9:00 
a.m., a National Guard unit based in Okla-
homa City—which was entirely White—fi-
nally arrived by train after having been re-
quested hours earlier by local authorities. 
By the time these ‘‘State Troops’’—as both 
Blacks and Whites later referred to them to 
differentiate them from the local ‘‘Home 
Guard’’ unit discussed further below—arrived 
in Tulsa, the violence had been occurring for 
nearly 11 hours. Many Blacks and Whites 
were dead, and while some looting continued, 
the Greenwood district was mostly in fiery 
ruin. Most of the city’s Black residents had 
either fled or had been interned against their 
will at several locations, including at the 
Convention Hall, a fairground, and a baseball 
park. 
Local authorities later claimed that this 
was for the protection of Black lives, but 
without a doubt they were also motivated by 
lingering fear of a supposed ‘‘Negro upris-
ing.’’ 
A number of these ‘‘Special Deputies’’— 
identified by ribbons and other ‘‘badges of of-
fice’’ supplied to them—were witnessed en-
gaging in arson, likely engaged in other acts 
of violence and mayhem during the Massacre 
and aided in rounding up Black residents for 
internment. 
Immediately following the shooting near 
the courthouse, Whites had begun breaking 
into sporting good stores, pawnshops, and 
hardware stores to steal firearms with which 
to arm themselves—some later claiming that 
they were ‘‘borrowing’’ the weapons. 
One business owner—whose sporting goods 
store was literally across the street from po-
lice headquarters—later testified that a po-
lice officer helped distribute the guns that 
were taken from his store. 
The local guard unit also worked with the 
Tulsa Police Department to round up, dis-
arm, and take into custody Black residents, 
with guardsmen offering the promise that if 
they came peacefully their homes and busi-
nesses would be protected. 
This action, however, effectively left Black 
lives and property defenseless to a White 
Mob aided by local police officers and their 
‘‘Special Deputies’’, leading to further de-
struction of property and helping contribute 
to the near total internment of the Black 
population in the days immediately fol-
lowing the riot. 
In the eyes of the grand jury, a group of 
armed Black residents standing up for equal 
rights understandably provoked the White 
crowd, and therefore, the entire Black com-
munity in Greenwood essentially deserved 
what happened. Adding to this injustice, the 
grand jury indicted 85 people—the majority 
of whom were African Americans—with Mas-
sacre-related offenses. 
While most of these charges were ulti-
mately dismissed or not pursued no Whites 
were ever sent to prison for any of the mur-
ders or arson committed on May 31 and June 
1, 1921. 
Due to their decades-long efforts, the story 
of the Massacre slowly resurfaced in the na-
tional consciousness, leading to greater de-
mands for the justice long denied to aging 
survivors and their next of kin. 
At the state and local level, in 1997 the 
Oklahoma State Legislature created the 
Oklahoma Commission to Study the Race 
Riot of 1921. In 2001, the commission issued a 
final report and recommendations. In a let-
ter to officials for the State of Oklahoma

and the City of Tulsa accompanying the re-
port, the commission noted that in February 
2000, the commission had already declared: 
that reparations to the historic Greenwood 
community in real and tangible form would 
be good public policy and do much to repair 
the emotional and physical scars of this ter-
rible incident in our shared past. We listed 
several recommended courses of action in-
cluding direct payments to riot survivors 
and descendants; a scholarship fund avail-
able to students affected by the riot; estab-
lishment of an economic development enter-
prise zone in the historic Greenwood district; 
a memorial for the riot victims. 
The commission reiterated its support for 
reparations and emphasized that these rec-
ommendations were a starting point and not 
exhaustive. Twenty years later, however, 
neither the State of Oklahoma nor the City 
of Tulsa has provided direct compensation to 
survivors and their descendants. 
In recent years, the City of Tulsa has made 
some token gestures to acknowledge the 
Massacre. In 2010, the City of Tulsa dedicated 
the John Hope Franklin Reconciliation Park 
to commemorate the Massacre’s victims. In 
2018, the City of Tulsa finally announced 
that it would reexamine the potential mass 
graves noted in the 2001 commission report. 
In October 2020, archeologists discovered a 
mass grave at Oaklawn Cemetery, one of the 
possible mass grave sites identified in the 
2001 report, and the City plans to exhume the 
bodies for further identification in June 2021. 
While the City of Tulsa has, in effect, cap-
italized on its public campaign to acknowl-
edge the Massacre, pointedly, it appears to 
have made no plan to use the resources gen-
erated to directly compensate survivors and 
their descendants nor address the racial and 
economic disparities that can be traced back 
to the Massacre. In May 2020, Human Rights 
Watch issued a report recommending several 
actions to be taken at the federal, state, and 
local level to address the Massacre, includ-
ing providing compensation directly to sur-
vivors and their descendants, and repara-
tions to the Black community in Tulsa for 
racial discrimination exacerbated by the 
Massacre. According to the report, Green-
wood had begun to thrive again by the 1940s. 
Yet rather than preserve what it once al-
lowed to be destroyed, the State of Okla-
homa and the City of Tulsa took several sub-
sequent actions that disproportionately bur-
dened Black residents—including the build-
ing of several highways through Greenwood 
starting in the 1960s and through the 1970s— 
that ultimately led to Greenwood’s long 
term decline. 
These actions also forced the majority of 
residents to move out of historic Greenwood 
into North Tulsa, which to this day is sig-
nificantly poorer compared to other areas of 
the city. 
Additionally, survivors and their descend-
ants have filed legal claims against the City 
of Tulsa and the State of Oklahoma seeking 
compensation for Massacre-related harms. 
Unfortunately, time and distance from the 
events have in the past worked to thwart 
these claims. In 2004, the Tenth Circuit, up-
holding the lower court’s decision to grant 
the State and City’s motion for summary 
judgment, held that the plaintiffs’ claims 
were barred by the applicable statute of lim-
itations, and that no equitable tolling to the 
statute of limitations period applied. The 
Supreme Court denied the plaintiff’s petition 
for writ of certiorari in 2005. Despite these 
adverse legal rulings, a lawsuit for Massacre- 
related claims was filed in state court last 
year alleging that the Massacre is an ongo-
ing injustice to the residents of Greenwood 
because contemporary racial and economic 
disparities existing in Tulsa can be traced 
back to the attack. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Then I want to 
salute those who will be honoring 100 
years in the next couple of weeks. I 
want to very quickly say that remem-
ber what I said, I knew the history of 
Christopher Columbus. I didn’t know 
the history of my Native American 
brothers. I didn’t know the history of 
my own self, slavery. I know Big Moth-
er, which is what we called her. She 
owned land, and then I knew it dis-
appeared. I knew I rode in the back of 
a train to visit her as a little girl. 
Guess what, Madam Speaker? 
Governor Kevin Stitt of Oklahoma 
was on the commission on the Tulsa 
race massacre, but he signed the bill 
limiting race and gender curriculums 
in Oklahoma schools earlier in May. 
Madam Speaker, can you believe it? 
It was House bill 1775. As well, he 
goes on to not stand for what this com-
mission is all about: truth. 
So tonight we come to the floor. Re-
member what I said: I am not in any 
way throwing darts or stones at any-
one. I am here to raise up the dignity 
of this man, this person, this body, 
burned because he was Black, pros-
perous, and ready to serve America. 
No one can tell me how many in that 
1921 massacre had been in World War I, 
had worn the uniform and come home 
and made a new life. 
How many can tell us out of those 
who would have lived, would have been 
ready to go serve in World War II and 
then on, and their progeny continue to 
build this wonderful economic engine? 
Today those who remain are three 
living descendants of those who were 
there. They tell me as I will go to 
Tulsa, there is one door left. 
It is a crying shame. So I lift this 
story up, and I let you know, Madam 
Speaker, that the Congressional Black 
Caucus, yes, the conscience of this Na-
tion, has a vital purpose to be able to 
tell the story. Someone I hope is listen-
ing. Someone I hope is listening. Some-
one I hope heard Brother Torres. I hope 
they heard HANK JOHNSON and BARBARA 
LEE. I hope they have heard all of us. 
Because if we do not know our history, 
we are doomed to repeat it. We must 
take the reins, lift up the dignity, 
honor these courageous saints, and we 
must fight on. 
Pass this resolution on the centen-
nial. Pass H.R. 40 to establish a com-
mission to study reparations. Pass the 
American Jobs Plan, pass the Amer-
ican Rescue Plan, and lift all boats. 
For as we do so, God will be the witness 
for what we have done and the journey 
we have made. 
Madam Speaker, I am honored to 
have been here today. I am honored to 
be part of the Congressional Black Cau-
cus. I am honored to be part of this 
House of Representatives. I am honored 
to be an American, and I will not have 
my history denied or my children fail-
ing to know that history. That is why 
we are here today. Let us march on 
until victory is won. 
Madam Speaker, I thank the gen-
tleman for yielding. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, on 
behalf of the Congressional Black Caucus, I 
rise to anchor this most important Special 
Order remembering one of the darkest mo-
ments in American history, the Tulsa-Green-
wood Race Massacre, that occurred in the Af-
rican American Greenwood community of 
Tulsa, Oklahoma, on May 31–June 1, 1921. 
I am pleased to be joined by Congressman 
TORRES of New York, who will co-anchor this 
Special Order and my several members of the 
Congressional Black Caucus, which under the 
leadership of our Chair, Congresswoman 
BEATTY of Ohio, was unified and determined 
that the reign of racial terror, carried out under 
color of law, that was visited on the black citi-
zens of Greenwood not be forgotten and that 
the injuries they suffered be redressed. 
Madam Speaker, earlier this year, I intro-
duced a resolution (H. Res. 215 later modified 
as H. Res. 398), joined by 84 cosponsors, rec-
ognizing the centennial of the 1921 Tulsa 
Race Massacre. 
As the great southern writer William Faulk-
ner reminded us: ‘‘The past is never dead. It’s 
not even past.’’ 
Madam Speaker, as I and other Members 
will elucidate this evening, the hatreds, preju-
dices, resentments, and white supremacy that 
Black Americans witnessed and suffered in 
Greenwood a century ago are not dead; they 
are not even past. 
A century ago, White rioters, local law en-
forcement, 
and 
self-appointed 
vigilantes 
claimed to be acting reasonably and in self- 
defense against what they feared was an up-
coming Black uprising. 
They resented the economic prosperity and 
self-sufficiency of the Greenwood community, 
which was known nationally as ‘‘Black Wall 
Street.’’ 
They viewed Black males as fearsome 
physical threats to their personal safety and as 
rivals to white women. 
These baseless, irrational concerns are not 
a relic of the past, they are with us today and 
are what resulted in the deaths of George 
Floyd, Tamir Rice, Deonte Wright, Stephon 
Clark, Amidou Diallo, and hundreds of others 
too numerous to list. 
In 1921, Tulsa, Oklahoma’s Greenwood Dis-
trict, known as ‘‘Black Wall Street,’’ was one of 
the most documented prosperous African 
American communities in the United States. 
The Greenwood community with a popu-
lation of over 100,000 Black people had stores 
that sold luxury items, 21 restaurants, 30 gro-
cery stores, a hospital, a savings and loan 
bank, a post office, three hotels, jewelry and 
clothing stores, two movie theaters, a library, 
pool halls, a bus and cab service, a nationally 
recognized school system, six private air-
planes, and two black newspapers. 
On May 31st of that year, the 35 city blocks 
of Greenwood went up in flames, at least 300 
Black persons were murdered and more than 
800 were injured; it is estimated that not less 
than 9,000 were left homeless and destitute. 
These rioters reenacted the brutality of the 
mob from a hundred years ago in the hal-
lowed halls of the Citadel of Democracy. 
It should not be overlooked that the source 
of their irrational anger, hatred, and violent re-
action was that Black Americans voted in 
overwhelming numbers in Atlanta, Philadel-
phia, Milwaukee, and Detroit to oust the most 
negative, divisive, racially hostile, and incom-
petent president’s history, the 45th President,

who presided over the deaths of more than 
500,000 Americans, disproportionately Black 
and Brown. 
The legacy of white mob violence inflicted 
upon the Black community of Greenwood has 
scarred the descendants of the victims of this 
American pogrom. 
Madam Speaker, the events of January 6th 
have given us insight into what the people of 
Greenwood, Oklahoma, faced when they were 
attacked by a similar murderous mob. 
H.R. 398 is a reminder to the nation of the 
ultimate cruelty inflicted upon a people for 
dare believing that the promise of America 
was attainable by them and their achieve-
ments would be respected and protected by 
law. 
But it does more than that, it puts the House 
of Representatives on record that the United 
States can achieve a more perfect union: 
1. by condemning the violence and destruc-
tion perpetrated against the African-American 
community of Greenwood, in Tulsa, Okla-
homa, the scene of the then-largest single in-
stance of domestic terror against American 
citizens; 
2. through the rejection and active opposi-
tion to the false ideology of White supremacy 
and condemnation of all groups and organiza-
tions that ascribe to this false system of belief 
and seek to perpetuate their views through vi-
olence and unlawful conduct; 
3. by promoting tolerance and unity and tak-
ing actions to ensure that governmental poli-
cies and actions do not foster division, dishar-
mony, or intolerance; 
4. by calling upon all Americans to celebrate 
the ethnic, racial, and religious diversity that 
has made the United States the leader of the 
community of nations and the beacon of hope 
and inspiration to oppressed persons every-
where; 
5. encouraging all persons in the United 
States to reflect upon the history of the United 
States as an imperfect but committed journey 
to establish a more perfect union and to cher-
ish and exercise the rights, privileges, and re-
sponsibilities guaranteed by the Constitution; 
and 
6. recognizing the commitment of Congress 
to acknowledge and learn from the history of 
racism and racial violence in the United 
States, including the Tulsa Race Massacre, to 
reverse the legacy of White supremacy and 
fight for racial justice. 
Madam Speaker, I will now briefly recount 
the horrific events cited in H. Res. 398 that 
were experienced by the law-abiding Black 
community of Greenwood on those terrible 
days. 
In 1921, White supremacy and racist vio-
lence were common throughout the United 
States and went largely unchecked by the jus-
tice system. 
In Tulsa, Oklahoma, reports of an alleged 
and disputed incident on the morning of May 
30, 1921, between two teenagers, a Black 
man and a White woman, caused the White 
community of Tulsa, including the Tulsa Trib-
une, to call for a lynching amidst a climate of 
White racial hostility and White resentment 
over Black economic success. 
On May 31, 1921, a mob of armed White 
men descended upon Tulsa’s Greenwood Dis-
trict and launched what is now known as the 
‘‘Tulsa Race Massacre.’’ 
Tulsa municipal and county authorities failed 
to take actions to calm or contain the violence, 
and civil and law enforcement officials depu-
tized many White men who were participants 
in the violence as their agents, directly contrib-
uting to the violence through overt and often 
illegal acts. 
Over a period of 24 hours, the White mob’s 
violence led to the death of an estimated 300 
Black residents, as well as over 800 reports of 
injuries. 
The White mob looted, damaged, burned, or 
otherwise destroyed approximately 40 square 
blocks of the Greenwood district, including an 
estimated 1,256 homes of Black residents, as 
well as virtually every other structure, including 
churches, schools, businesses, a hospital, and 
a library, leaving nearly 9,000 Black residents 
of the Greenwood community homeless and 
effectively wiping out tens of millions of dollars 
in Black prosperity and wealth. 
In the wake of the Tulsa Race Massacre, 
the Governor of Oklahoma declared martial 
law, and units of the Oklahoma National 
Guard participated in the mass arrests of all or 
nearly all of Greenwood’s surviving residents, 
removing them from Greenwood to other parts 
of Tulsa and unlawfully detaining them in hold-
ing centers. 
Oklahoma local and state governments dis-
missed claims arising from the 1921 Tulsa 
Race Massacre for decades, and the event 
was effectively erased from collective memory 
and history until, in 1997, the Oklahoma State 
Legislature finally created a commission to 
study the event. 
On February 28, 2001, the commission 
issued a report that detailed, for the first time, 
the extent of the Massacre and decades-long 
efforts to suppress its recollection. 
None of the law enforcement officials nor 
any of the hundreds of other White mob mem-
bers who participated in the violence were 
ever prosecuted or held accountable for the 
hundreds of lives lost and tens of millions of 
dollars of Black wealth destroyed, despite the 
Tulsa Race Massacre Commission confirming 
their roles in the Massacre, nor was any com-
pensation ever provided to the Massacre’s vic-
tims or their descendants. 
Government and city officials not only abdi-
cated their responsibility to rebuild and repair 
the Greenwood community in the wake of the 
violence, but actively blocked efforts to do so, 
contributing to continued racial disparities in 
Tulsa akin to those that Black people still face 
today across the United States. 
Madam Speaker, the pattern of violence 
against Black people in the United States, 
often at the hands of law enforcement, shows 
that the fight to end State-sanctioned violence 
against Black people continues. 
As the American Historical Association stat-
ed, ‘‘What happened in Tulsa was extreme, 
but not unusual. It is part of our nation’s herit-
age. We must acknowledge that heritage, 
learn from it, and do whatever each of us can 
do to ensure that it is just that—heritage, rath-
er than a continuing practice.’’ 
Madam Speaker, I will include in the 
RECORD a more detailed account of the 1921 
Tulsa Race Massacre that is based on the 
‘‘Final Report of the Oklahoma Commission to 
Study The Tulsa Race Riot of 1921,’’ issued 
February 28, 2001. 
Madam Speaker, I also ask the House to 
observe a moment of silence in memory of the 
victims and survivors of the Tulsa Race Mas-
sacre, and their descendants to carry the ter-
rible memories of that horrific day and still 
grieve over the loss of so many loved ones 
and of faith in the American system of justice. 
Mr. TORRES of New York. Madam 
Speaker, I yield back the balance of 
my time. 
Ms. JOHNSON of Texas. Madam Speaker, 
the Tulsa-Greenwood Massacre was a mass 
killing targeting Black Americans in one of the 
prosperous Black communities in the country. 
As we approach its 100th anniversary, we 
must reflect on the events and beliefs that led 
to those fateful days in late May of 1921, its 
place in our nation’s history, and its lasting im-
pacts on the Black community. 
Founded and built by former slaves, freed 
by the ratification of the 13th amendment, the 
Greenwood District was a true testament to 
the American Dream. The district was defined 
by its entrepreneurial spirit and success and 
offered newly-freed men and women the 
chance to make a name for themselves and 
their families. 
But their success was being followed closely 
by those who wished otherwise—those who 
were looking for any opportunity to materialize 
their resent. And in the face of baseless alle-
gations of a crime committed by a Black man, 
that hatred resulted in what is now known as 
the Tulsa Race Massacre. The massacre re-
sulted in the deaths of over 300 Black men, 
women, and children and left around 9,000 
more without homes or a source of income— 
not to mention the immeasurable impact left 
on generations of Black Americans. 
As Members of Congress, we stand here in 
the Capitol of the United States, itself built by 
slaves who are largely forgotten, with a unique 
opportunity to take action. That is why I am 
proud to be a cosponsor of Congresswoman 
JACKSON LEE and Senator WARREN’s resolu-
tion to recognize the forthcoming centennial of 
the 1921 Tulsa Race Massacre and con-
demning past and present efforts to downplay 
its significance. It is critical that Congress take 
this step not only to honor the lives and leg-
acies of those lost but also to encourage edu-
cation about the massacre and the role white 
supremacy played in its inception. 
Madam Speaker, today we recommit our-
selves to fight the ever-present racism and un-
just violence against Black Americans. We do 
so on the shoulders of those that came, 
fought, and suffered before us in the hope that 
one day the American Dream is accessible to 
all—regardless of race.

PERSONAL EXPLANATION 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, 
I was unavoidably detained in my con-
gressional district due to COVID re-
sponsibilities, and I was not present for 
rollcall vote 144. 
I ask the RECORD to reflect that had 
I been present, I would have voted 
‘‘aye’’ on rollcall 144, the motion to 
suspend the rules and pass H.R. 2911, 
VA Transparency and Trust Act of 2021.

Vol. 167 
WASHINGTON, MONDAY, MAY 17, 2021 
No. 85 
Senate 
The Senate met at 3 p.m. and was 
called to order by the President pro 
tempore (Mr. LEAHY). 
f 
PRAYER 
The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, of-
fered the following prayer: 
f 
PRAYER 
Let us pray. 
Loving God, keep us far from the 
paths of evil. Remind us that You have 
no desire to rain on our parade. In-
stead, You want for us all to experience 
a rich and satisfying life. Give our law-
makers wisdom to avoid the traps that 
cause them to deviate from Your plan 
for their lives. 
Lord, keep them from setting an am-
bush for themselves. May they instead 
listen to Your counsel and walk se-
curely, protected by Your loving and 
prevailing providence. Provide them 
with a passion to choose reverence for 
You and obedience to Your commands 
so that You can use them as peace-
makers for our Nation and world. 
We pray in Your sovereign Name. 
Amen.

PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE 
The President pro tempore led the 
Pledge of Allegiance, as follows: 
I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the 
United States of America, and to the Repub-
lic for which it stands, one nation under God, 
indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. 
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The 
Senator from Illinois. 
Ms. DUCKWORTH. Mr. President, I 
suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to

Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER

DUCKWORTH). Without objection, it is 
so ordered. 
RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY 
LEADER 
THE PRESIDING OFFICER. The ma-
jority leader is recognized. 
f 
SENATE LEGISLATIVE AGENDA 
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, 
the Senate will consider three impor-
tant measures this week. Senators will 
vote on whether to repeal a Trump-era 
rule that made it harder for victims of 
discrimination in the workplace to pur-
sue justice. It is another example of 
the sheer malice, the nastiness of the 
Trump 
administration. 
It 
actively 
sought to make it harder—harder—for 
workers to win employment discrimi-
nation claims. The Senate should re-
verse the Trump-era rule this week. 
Second, the Senate will also vote on 
whether to discharge the nomination of 
Ms. Kristen Clarke from the Judiciary 
Committee. Ms. Clarke would be the 
first Black woman ever to serve as the 
Assistant Attorney General for the 
Civil Rights Division. She is im-
mensely qualified, and I look forward 
to putting her nomination on the floor 
after the Senate takes action this 
week. 
But first, throughout the week—this 
is the third thing, very important as 
well—the Senate will debate a very im-
portant 
piece 
of 
legislation. 
This 
evening, the Senate will vote on wheth-
er to take up the Endless Frontier Act 
on the Senate floor, a once-in-a-genera-
tion investment in American science 
and American technology. 
Last week, the Senate Commerce 
Committee voted on an overwhelm-
ingly bipartisan basis, 24 to 4, to ad-
vance the bill. The Endless Frontier 
Act will form the core of what will be 
a comprehensive bill to boost Amer-
ica’s ability to compete, innovate, and 
win the technologies of the 21st cen-
tury. 
Over the course of the next week or 
two, the Senate will debate and amend 
the legislation. I look forward to hav-
ing 
another 
open 
and 
bipartisan 
amendment process, just as we did on 
the Asian hate crimes bill and the bi-
partisan 
water 
infrastructure 
bill. 
There is no reason—no reason—the 
Senate can’t finish our work on this 
important legislation by the end of the 
month. 
Members on both sides of the aisle 
know that decades of Federal under-
investment in science and technology 
have imperiled America’s global eco-
nomic leadership. When we invest in 
science, it inevitably produces millions 
of good-paying jobs. 
So this comprehensive bill will boost 
funding for basic scientific research, 
tech development, and manufacturing. 
It will strengthen our alliances and 
partnerships abroad. It will fortify 
weak spots in our economy, like semi-
conductors, and will ensure that we 
hold the Chinese Communist Party ac-
countable for its predatory economic 
practices. It is a forward-looking, com-
prehensive plan to preserve America’s 
competitive edge. 
The benefits will be manifold. When 
we invest in scientific research, the ef-
fect is diffusive. It helps our univer-
sities, our laboratories, and our busi-
nesses. And, again, it creates new, 
good-paying jobs—millions of them— 
millions of them. So if you are looking 
for the future and our people want to 
have a brighter future and want to be 
assured that their children will have 
better paying jobs than they have, this 
is an answer—one of the most impor-
tant answers we can come up with. 
An American workforce will help 
bring American inventions to the glob-
al market, and the way we have been 
No. 1 in the economy for the last cen-
tury will continue on into this one. So 
I am excited about this legislation. 
Holding 
the 
Chinese 
Communist 
Party accountable for its years of rapa-
cious economic policies and theft of 
American ingenuity will help create a 
level 
playing 
field 
that 
American 
workers have lacked for decades.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2534 
May 17, 2021 
Investing in scientific research also 
hardens our national security. We can 
either have a world where the Chinese 
Communist Party determines the rules 
of the road for 5G, AI, and quantum 
computing or we can make sure the 
United States gets there first—few 
things that should bring this Chamber 
together faster than securing another 
century of American leadership than 
this. 
I am proud to have worked with my 
colleagues 
Senator 
YOUNG, 
Chair-
woman CANTWELL, Ranking Member 
WICKER, and others to get this bill to 
the floor of the Senate. And I greatly 
look forward to working with all of my 
colleagues during these next few weeks 
on amending, broadening, and passing 
this legislation before the month is 
out. 
f 
BIDEN ADMINISTRATION 
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, 
one final matter. Tomorrow, President 
Biden will visit an electric manufac-
turing facility in Michigan, where a 
major American auto company is set to 
unveil its new electric—electric—pick-
up truck. 
Tomorrow’s announcement is a sig-
nificant breakthrough. Because it is 
one of the bestselling cars in America, 
the success of an electric pickup could 
hasten our Nation’s transition to a 
cleaner, brighter, and stronger trans-
portation future. 
And personally, I am very happy to 
see the Biden administration put a 
spotlight on zero-emission vehicles. 
This is an issue I have been working on 
for a very long time, and something I 
am passionate about. No matter how 
you look at the data, there is no way 
that America can meet our targets for 
reducing 
greenhouse 
gas 
emissions 
without looking at how we drive. 
Transportation accounts for nearly 
one-third of America’s carbon outlook. 
And while the transition to electric ve-
hicles is already underway, it is pro-
gressing too slowly. 
That is why almost 2 years ago I de-
veloped and introduced an ambitious 
new proposal to rapidly phase out gas- 
powered vehicles and replace them 
with clean cars. All told, the object of 
the plan—called Clean Cars for Amer-
ica—is that by 2040, all vehicles on the 
road should be clean. I am delighted 
that President Biden has put this pro-
posal in his build back America infra-
structure plan. 
Through a mixture of credits and in-
vestments, it would make electric ve-
hicles affordable for all Americans, 
provide incentives to trade in older gas 
vehicles, build the necessary charging 
infrastructure, and, very importantly, 
create tens of thousands of good-paying 
union jobs in automaking, construc-
tion, and battery manufacturing. 
What distinguishes this proposal is 
its ability to unite the environmental 
movement, the labor movement, and 
the large automakers. 
Isn’t that a great thing? We used to 
have the environmental proposals and 
work and union proposals conflict—no 
more because we are taking each oth-
er’s needs into account. This bill has 
already earned the support of the Si-
erra Club, the Natural Resources De-
fense Council, the League of Conserva-
tion Voters, the UAW, and the Inter-
national 
Brotherhood 
of 
Electrical 
Workers, and car manufacturers like 
Ford and General Motors are sup-
portive as well. 
So you have the whole span. Some-
thing like this should pass with a lot of 
votes, I hope. And I was very proud to 
see President Biden put my Clean Cars 
for America proposal at the heart of 
his American jobs plan. 
In recent weeks, the virtue of such a 
plan has been made apparent to mil-
lions of drivers and not just for cli-
mate-saving 
reasons. 
The 
gasoline 
shortages along the eastern seaboard, 
though 
temporary, 
revealed, 
once 
again, that electric vehicles can be 
more reliable. For EVs, the price and 
availability of fuel does not depend on 
the ebb and flow of fossil fuel dis-
covery, the volatility of international 
markets, or panics, like the one we just 
saw. 
On every front—on jobs, American 
economic leadership, protecting the 
planet—transitioning to a clean car fu-
ture provides benefits. In the 20th cen-
tury, America led the way in auto 
manufacturing. If we fall behind on 
electric cars, we will no longer lead the 
way. But this legislation has us staying 
No. 1 and producing lots of good-paying 
jobs—hallelujah. 
So as the President prepares to go to 
Michigan for this important announce-
ment, we should also be talking about 
making a larger scale, ambitious effort 
to speed our country’s transition to 
zero-emission vehicles. Clean Cars for 
America is the way to do it. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

f 
ISRAEL 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President, 
yesterday was the deadliest day yet in 
the continued fighting between the ter-
rorist 
forces 
attacking 
Israel 
and 
Israel’s measured, precise, and defen-
sive response. 
Hamas unleashed another round of 
rocket 
barrages, 
intentionally 
tar-
geting civilian areas all across Israel. 
Israel intensified its campaign to, 
among other specific military objec-
tives, destroy the terrorist group’s un-
derground networks of weapons storage 
and command and control. 
Last week, Hamas’s rocket attacks 
took the life of a 5-year-old Israeli boy. 
And because Hamas, in stark violation 
of the laws of war, intentionally co-lo-
cates its terrorist facilities in civilian 
buildings 
in 
neighborhoods, 
Israeli 
strikes have regrettably led to civilian 
casualties in Gaza. 
No one is glad to see the fighting, but 
we are already seeing some push the 
false narrative that this conflict is a 
tragic dispute between two legitimate 
combatants where both sides share 
blame that is roughly equal—what non-
sense. This yields calls for blanket 
cease-fires and people wagging their 
fingers at both sides. This camp appar-
ently includes some of our own Senate 
colleagues. 
To say that ‘‘both sides’’ need to de-
escalate downplays the responsibility 
the terrorists have for initiating the 
conflict in the first place and suggests 
Israelis are not entitled to defend 
themselves against ongoing rocket bar-
rages. I completely reject this obscene 
moral equivalence. 
Now, the second false narrative is the 
view on the increasingly vocal far left 
that Israel is, to quote one far-left 
Member of the House, an ‘‘apartheid 
state.’’ Another says Israel has per-
petrated ‘‘an act of terrorism.’’ 
Look, this is not a conflict between 
Israel 
and 
the 
Palestinian 
people. 
Hamas has sought to hijack recent ten-
sions to advance its own narrow, vio-
lent objectives. In that sense, it is a 
conflict between Israel and a terrorist 
rump state in Gaza that uses its civil-
ian population as human shields and 
exploits their suffering for political 
gain. These terrorists set up shop in 
apartment buildings and under press 
offices. They direct rocket attacks 
from the cover of schools and markets. 
In the past, when their operatives have 
been killed, they passed them off to the 
international community as civilian 
victims of Israel. 
Few countries in history spend as 
much effort to avoid civilian casualties 
during war as Israel and the United 
States. We hold our militaries to the 
highest standard. Our Israeli friends 
take pain to defend themselves in ways 
that are responsible and spare the very 
civilians Hamas is willing to sacrifice 
for its propaganda. Israel invests heav-
ily in precision munitions. They spend 
precious time after attacks confirming 
target identification. And listen to 
this: They even provide advance warn-
ing to civilians in Gaza before specific 
buildings are targeted, even when 
doing so means the terrorists may also 
evacuate. 
It is all well and good for President 
Biden to speak with the President of 
the Palestinian Authority, but he holds 
little sway in Gaza. And twice he has 
rejected generous offers from different 
Israeli Governments aimed at estab-
lishing an enduring peace. 
But if the so-called international 
community wants to actually make a

difference—really make a difference— 
they can impose real costs on those 
who fund the terror weapons of Hamas 
and Palestinian Islamic Jihad. 
We know where their return address 
is. It is over in Tehran. 
I have been proud to stand with 
Israel for years, and I am proud to 
stand with Israel today. The United 
States needs to stand foursquare be-
hind our ally. President Biden must re-
main strong against the growing voices 
within his own party that create false 
equivalence between terrorist aggres-
sors and a responsible state defending 
itself. 
Israel deserves an opportunity to re-
store deterrence and to impose costs on 
terrorists the international community 
has been unwilling or unable to impose. 
There is a saying that has been around 
for quite a while: If Hamas laid down 
its weapons tomorrow, there would be 
no more fighting; if Israel laid down 
their weapons, there would be no more 
Israel. 
So let’s leave no doubt where Amer-
ica stands. 
f 
CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. MCCONNELL. On an entirely dif-
ferent matter, when the 117th Congress 
and President Biden were sworn in 
back in January, our Nation had al-
ready turned the corner in our battle 
with the coronavirus. New cases and 
deaths had already peaked and actually 
started to plummet. The vaccines, 
made available in record time thanks 
to Operation Warp Speed, had already 
started to roll out nationwide at a rate 
which the Biden administration inher-
ited and sustained until April. The five 
bipartisan COVID packages that Con-
gress passed in 2020 had the American 
economy packed with dry powder and 
primed for an epic comeback. 
Economists 
across 
the 
spectrum 
agreed. One of President Obama’s CEA 
chairmen said: ‘‘We have no historic 
parallel with anything like this level of 
excess saving.’’ Larry Summers, an-
other top Obama adviser and President 
Clinton’s Treasury Secretary before 
that, said the bipartisan December 
package was already enough to elevate 
a measure of household income to ‘‘ab-
normally high levels, unheard of during 
an economic downturn.’’ We were al-
ready adding back jobs. 
But instead of tailoring another bill 
to build on this momentum, they 
pushed ahead with the $2 trillion par-
tisan plan that the far left wanted. Re-
publicans predicted it would hurt our 
recovery if Washington kept taxing 
working people so the government 
could pay others a bonus to stay home. 
I stood here in February and quoted an 
expert who said: 
In an expanding economy that is putting 
the virus behind it, paying people more in 
unemployment than they could receive from 
working is an act of substantial economic 
self-harm. It would keep workers on the side-
lines, stop the unemployment rate from fall-
ing as rapidly as it otherwise would, and 
slow the overhaul recovery. 
Well, we all knew what would hap-
pen, but Democrats insisted on con-
tinuing to pay people more not to 
work. 
In April, as the President’s policies 
took effect, we only added 266,000 jobs. 
That is nearly 800,000 under estimates, 
just as jobs openings soared to more 
than 8 million, the biggest number ever 
recorded. We are literally taxing the 
American workers who are back on the 
job for the sake of slowing down our 
economic recovery. 
Instead of an agenda to reopen Amer-
ica, Democrats muscled through poli-
cies that would actually prolong parts 
of this crisis. And, of course, that is 
what happened. A record number of 
small businesses say they have open 
jobs they cannot fill. 
Governors across America are having 
to take matters into their own hands 
and turn off these extra-generous bene-
fits. In States like Arizona, Georgia, 
Montana, Ohio, and West Virginia, we 
have Governors having to clean up this 
mess, which at least one of their own 
Senators actually voted for. 
The policies that we needed in March 
of 2020 are not the policies we need in 
May of 2021. That has been obvious to 
Republicans, to economists, and to the 
American people. 
The sooner that my Democratic 
friends here in Washington can catch 
up, the better.

Technology and Innovation in the National 
Science Foundation, to establish a regional 
technology hub program, to require a strat-
egy

turing, and job creation, to establish a crit-
ical supply chain resiliency program, and for 
other purposes. 
Mr. MCCONNELL. I suggest the ab-
sence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to 
call the roll. 
Mr. COTTON. Madam President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
ISRAEL 
Mr. COTTON. Madam President, just 
4 short months ago, hopes were running 
high in the Middle East. ISIS was 
wiped off the map, the Iranian regime 
and its terrorist proxies were in re-
treat, and Israel was forging historic 
peace deals with its neighbors. All 
along the way, the United States was 
instrumental in this progress. 
But in just a few months, the Biden 
administration has dashed those hopes 
with its policy of weakness and ap-
peasement. The forces of terror are 
again on the march. Pillars of smoke 
and fire are rising from Tel Aviv and 
the holy city of Jerusalem. The assault 
on Israel by terrorist groups like 
Hamas and the Palestinian Islamic 
Jihad is the latest and most concrete 
evidence yet that the Middle East is 
spiraling toward chaos. 
But instead of standing firm with 
Israel, the Biden administration’s pol-
icy of endless accommodation is fan-
ning the flames of conflict. The Presi-
dent should show strength. Instead, he 
is broadcasting indecision and weak-
ness. Our greatest ally in the Middle 
East is under attack. Yet the Demo-
cratic Party refuses to say: We stand 
with Israel. The night sky over the 
Jewish State blazes with the starbursts 
of intercepted rockets, and the Biden 
administration only offers muted calls 
for restraint. 
Where are the righteous denuncia-
tions of the terrorists responsible for 
these 
repeated, 
premeditated, 
and 
unprovoked attacks? Where are the 
statements of solidarity with Israel? 
Please. From this administration and 
from this Democratic Party, we can’t 
even get the President’s spokeswoman 
to say that the United States would 
help resupply munitions for Iron Dome, 
Israel’s lifesaving missile defense sys-
tem. 
So this afternoon, let me provide a 
little clarity that the President and his 
party appear incapable or unwilling to 
articulate. The fault for the death and 
destruction in the streets of Tel Aviv, 
Jerusalem, Gaza, and the West Bank 
lies not with the Israeli Government, 
much less with the Israeli people. The 
belligerents in this conflict aren’t mor-
ally equivalent, the way it is often pre-
sented in supposedly enlightened cir-
cles. Put simply, there are good guys, 
and there are bad guys. Israel seeks 
peace. Terror groups seek death and de-
struction. Hamas and the Palestinian 
Islamic Jihad are not legitimate state 
actors. They don’t speak for the Pales-
tinian people and don’t truly care 
about them. 
These groups are terrorist organiza-
tions run by evil men who commit evil 
acts in pursuit of the evil dreams of an 
evil 
ideology. 
They 
purposely 
fire 
waves of unguided rockets at civilian 
targets, while they protect themselves 
from reprisal using babies, hospitals, 
schools, and dupes in the media as 
shields—what cowards, attacking inno-
cent civilians while they hide behind 
women.

S2536 
May 17, 2021 
Of course, Hamas and the Islamic 
Jihad don’t act alone. The Palestinian 
Authority supports, encourages, and 
funds terrorism in the form of so-called 
martyr payments—pensions paid to 
terrorists who attack Jews. The PA 
perpetuates cycles of violence by refus-
ing to acknowledge the existence of 
Israel, teaching anti-Semitism in its 
schools and leaving its people to wal-
low in poverty as wards of the inter-
national community. 
And we all know who funds and arms 
Palestinian terrorist organizations, the 
world’s foremost supporter of ter-
rorism, the Islamic Republic of Iran. 
For decades, Iran’s theocrats have 
staged demonstrations where their fa-
natical supporters scream: ‘‘Death to 
America’’ and ‘‘Death to Israel.’’ The 
assault on Israel today shows that 
those chants are not idle threats. 
Iran’s ayatollahs are deadly serious 
about wiping the Jewish State off the 
map. That is why Iran arms Pales-
tinian terrorists with some of its most 
lethal weapons. Hamas’s arsenal of 
10,000 rockets might as well have 
‘‘Made in Iran’’ stamped on the side. 
Those are the villains of this conflict, 
but let’s not forget the heroes. Stand-
ing courageously against this orga-
nized onslaught is the State of Israel, 
our closest ally in the region. Over the 
past week, terrorists have fired ap-
proximately 3,000 missiles and rockets 
into Israel. In response, Israel has de-
fended itself with technological mir-
acles like Iron Dome. It has carried out 
precision airstrikes against military 
targets, and, as always, Israel has gone 
to extraordinary lengths to minimize 
civilian casualties, despite the terror-
ists’ best efforts to maximize and then 
publicize any carnage. 
While Hamas and the Islamic Jihad 
fire indiscriminately from Palestinian 
schools, office buildings, and apart-
ments, Israel responds by hitting those 
launch 
sites, 
but 
only 
after—only 
after—they warn civilians, allowing 
them to evacuate first. Regrettably, 
these warnings also allow terrorists to 
escape, but Israel bears that cost be-
cause it values innocent life, unlike its 
terrorist enemies. 
You may have heard of one recent ex-
ample. Last week, Israel carried out an 
airstrike against a building used by 
Hamas intelligence personnel, a build-
ing that also housed the Associated 
Press. An hour before the airstrike, the 
Israeli military called the AP and 
other civilians in that complex and 
warned them to depart. This pre-
caution, once again, allowed Hamas 
terrorists to escape but also allowed re-
porters and other civilians to vacate 
the premises before the airstrike oc-
curred. As a result, no civilians died, 
and Hamas lost a terrorist haven. 
Now, in any other country and with 
any other military—except America’s, 
I have to add—one would hear praise 
for that military’s restraint and com-
mitment to the laws of order. But be-
cause this military is the IDF and the 
country is Israel and the people are the 
Jews, 
they 
are 
widely 
condemned 
around the world and on the left in 
America. 
If you cut through the hysterics and 
the hyperbole, you can see the truth 
clearly: One side seeks to maximize 
carnage and the other seeks to mini-
mize civilian casualties. 
Besides, I must observe, why is the 
Associated Press sharing a building 
with Hamas? Surely, these intrepid re-
porters knew who their neighbors were. 
Did they knowingly allow themselves 
to be used as human shields by a U.S.- 
designated terrorist organization? Did 
AP pull its punches and decline to re-
port for years on Hamas’s misdeeds? 
I submit that the AP has some un-
comfortable questions to answer. Yet 
the AP and its fellow journalists are in 
high dudgeon about Israel’s wholly ap-
propriate airstrike. Leave it to whiny 
reporters to make themselves the story 
and the victim when terrorists are 
shooting missiles at innocent civilians. 
In any event, the moral standing of 
the competing forces in this conflict is 
simple and clear. Our greatest ally and 
the only democracy in the region 
against an Islamist theocracy and its 
terrorist 
partners—most 
Americans 
know which side they are on. I speak 
for them when I say that we stand with 
Israel. 
Unfortunately, 
too 
many 
elected 
Democrats 
have 
taken 
a 
different 
stand. 
Members 
of 
the 
so-called 
‘‘Squad’’ in the House of Representa-
tives have called Israel an apartheid 
state and accused it of war crimes. Re-
member, these aren’t obscure back-
benchers. 
Many 
Democrats 
herald 
these Representatives as the future of 
their party. 
Meanwhile, 27 Democratic Senators 
have called for an immediate cease-fire 
to the conflict. Even the Democratic 
floor leader, who has long styled him-
self as Israel’s great defender, has 
joined this moral equivalence, calling 
for immediate cease-fire. 
Hear me clearly. The handwringing 
calls for a cease-fire are tantamount to 
Hamas propaganda. Both sides are not 
the same in this conflict, no matter 
what the Democrats naively imply. If 
Hamas puts down its weapons, there 
would be peace. If Israel puts down its 
weapons, there would be no Israel. 
Thankfully, Israel’s leadership is res-
olute, united, and committed to vic-
tory. The United States should respond 
to this terrorist onslaught with equal 
resolve. That means we should give 
Israel the time, space, and resources to 
destroy Hamas’s war machine and pro-
tect its own people. We should also en-
sure that Israel has the military hard-
ware to weather this crisis. Hamas may 
have as many as 10,000 missiles, rock-
ets, and mortars in reserve. Meanwhile, 
Hezbollah lurks to the north with 
many times that arsenal. We should, 
therefore, endeavor to ensure that 
Israel has more interceptors for Iron 
Dome than Hamas has rockets to kill 
Israelis. Moreover, we ought to cut off 
aid to the Palestinian Authority until 
we can be absolutely sure that not a 
dime of taxpayer money is being used 
to buy and build rockets or pay pen-
sions for murderous terrorists. 
And, finally, the Biden administra-
tion ought to immediately end its mis-
guided flirtation with the theocrats in 
Iran by recalling its chief negotiator 
and appeaser, Rob Malley, from nego-
tiations in Vienna. If the Biden admin-
istration reenters the failed Iran nu-
clear agreement and grants sanctions 
relief to the regime in Tehran, in very 
short order that appeasement payoff 
will be converted into rockets aimed at 
Israel, as well as at American troops 
throughout the region. 
While Israel is under attack, we have 
heard 
plenty 
of 
talk 
and 
mealy-
mouthed statements from politicians. 
But in this moment of crisis, Israel 
needs more than words. Israel needs 
and deserves our full support to defend 
itself and its people and to achieve a 
just and lasting peace. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The bill clerk proceeded to call the 
roll. 
Mr. TUBERVILLE. Madam Presi-
dent, I ask unanimous consent that the 
order for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
CHINA 
Mr. TUBERVILLE. Madam Presi-
dent, I spoke recently about how the 
President’s ‘‘skinny’’ budget is dis-
appointing, dangerous, and a disservice 
to our men and women in uniform. 
China actively seeks to outpace the 
U.S. military, and in some cases, they 
are succeeding. This isn’t a 5- or 10- 
year problem; the threat is right now, 
today. 
Unfortunately, the military is not 
the only area facing active challenges 
by China. Today, I am going to discuss 
a few at-risk areas that are critical to 
the stability of our Nation. 
It is no secret that the Chinese Com-
munist Party, or CCP, wants to replace 
the United States as the world’s top 
power. The American people need to be 
aware of how the Chinese Communist 
Party is coming after us, not just with 
missiles and military might but with 
plans to subdue the American spirit. 
The repressive CCP uses economic es-
pionage to advance its agenda to weak-
en our arsenal of democracy. A signifi-
cant part of what has made the United 
States a global powerhouse is the 
strength and resilience of our private 
sector companies. Whether it is in the 
technology, healthcare, or energy sec-
tor, American innovation is unrivaled. 
It is what has made us the greatest 
economy in the history of the world. 
China’s leaders know this, but rather 
than go head-to-head in honest com-
petition, they have settled for stealing 
our intellectual property. Chinese busi-
nesses, at the instruction of their gov-
ernment, lure American companies in. 
They offer cheap labor. They promise

May 17, 2021 
an ‘‘exchange of ideas,’’ but they really 
want to steal our valuable intellectual 
property. 
As President Trump’s Director of Na-
tional 
Intelligence, 
John 
Ratcliffe, 
said, China’s strategy is to ‘‘rob, rep-
licate and replace.’’ China robs Amer-
ican companies of their intellectual 
property, they replicate our tech-
nology, and then China replaces U.S. 
firms in the global marketplace. 
This theft isn’t exclusive to just one 
industry. They will go after whatever 
they can to get their hands on it—wind 
turbines, airplane designs, underwater 
drones, chemicals, or artificial intel-
ligence technology. According to the 
Department of Justice, between 2011 
and 2018, more than 90 percent of the 
Department’s foreign economic espio-
nage cases involved China. 
By stealing this critical knowledge, 
the Chinese have given themselves a 
leg up on other nations. They are using 
it to expand their military and eco-
nomic power. Their goal is to surpass 
the U.S. economy and gain monopoly 
control over every major industry. We 
cannot allow that to succeed. 
Even more alarming is what China is 
doing from within our own univer-
sities. The American people may not be 
familiar with Confucius Institutes, but 
they should be. Confucius Institutes 
currently operate at 55 American col-
leges and universities. While they 
claim to harmlessly promote Chinese 
language and culture, they actually 
serve as a beachhead for the Chinese 
Government within America’s research 
institutions. Often, just the presence of 
a Confucius Institute on campus will 
enable Chinese officials to stifle any 
criticism of the Chinese Government at 
that university. The institutes also 
allow the Chinese Government to har-
vest valuable data from research being 
conducted at our country’s world-class 
institutions. Who knows what else they 
could be up to. 
I was very proud to cosponsor Sen-
ator BLACKBURN’s Transparency for 
Confucius Institutes Act, which would 
provide needed transparency to these 
dangerous organizations. I was also 
glad to see Alabama A&M, a public 
land-grant and historically Black uni-
versity, make the decision to close 
their Confucius Institute just last 
month. 
Congress has made clear that Amer-
ican institutions of higher education 
that host Confucius Institutes could 
lose their Federal funding. 
I hope any remaining colleges and 
universities with these CCP satellite 
organizations follow Alabama A&M’s 
leadership. 
The United States and the entire 
Western World have given China valu-
able concessions for decades. We gave 
China a seat at the table thinking they 
would change, but they have played 
their hand ruthlessly. The hope was 
that by facilitating economic growth 
through open markets and giving them 
leadership roles in the international in-
stitutions, China’s Communist regime 
would 
finally 
embrace 
democracy, 
human rights, and free market values. 
It is past time we recognize that de-
spite all its good intentions, this strat-
egy has failed and miserably. 
The Chinese Communist Party has 
continually spied on its citizens, vio-
lently suppressed dissent, and system-
atically persecuted religious and eth-
nic minorities to the point of genocide. 
President Trump stood up to China. 
He was the first U.S. President to do so 
in decades. And he made great strides, 
but he didn’t have enough time in of-
fice to finish the job. I sincerely hope 
President Biden will continue to build 
on the Trump administration’s momen-
tum in pushing back against China’s 
aggressive rise. 
The United States must address the 
challenges posed by China. I have 
shared a lot of concerns today, but I 
am not one to offer criticism without a 
commonsense solution. Here is one 
commonsense step Congress can take 
immediately. 
The TSP, or Thrift Savings Plan, is 
the 401(k)-style investment plan that 
over 6 million Federal and government 
employees, both military and civilian, 
use for their retirement plan. The plan 
manages more than $700 billion in as-
sets. 
Back in 2017, the Board that governs 
the TSP decided to invest billions in 
companies with direct ties to the Chi-
nese Communist Party. They wanted 
to send government employee dollars— 
the retirement savings of our military 
and civilian public servants—to Chi-
nese companies, including mine and 
everybody’s here in Congress. These 
companies are tied to a government 
that 
openly 
committed 
genocide 
against its own people. Well, with me, 
that dog doesn’t hunt. 
Thankfully, President Trump put a 
stop to that plan before it was imple-
mented, but now with President Biden 
in the White House, the Board could 
decide to push through this decision. 
We need congressional action to make 
President Trump’s decision with the 
thrift savings plan permanent. I bet if 
you ask the folks who work in these 
buildings or who served the United 
States overseas if they want their re-
tirement savings going to Chinese com-
panies, you would hear a loud no. 
I will be offering a solution on this 
tomorrow to protect our national secu-
rity and safeguard the retirements of 
those who have served our country 
with honor and distinction. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Ms. 
DUCKWORTH). The clerk will call the 
roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mrs. BLACKBURN. Madam Presi-
dent, I ask unanimous consent that the 
order for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
ISRAEL 
Mrs. BLACKBURN. Madam Presi-
dent, over the past week, the Pales-
tinian terrorist organization Hamas 
has launched more than 3,000 rockets 
at civilian targets in Israel. Violent 
mobs have taken over the streets of Je-
rusalem, and even seasoned veterans of 
the Palestinian-Israeli conflict have 
expressed shock at the intensity of the 
violence. 
This isn’t normal. This isn’t the Mid-
dle East version of the Resistance. This 
is terrorism. Still, pro-Hamas activists 
have 
flooded 
the 
media 
with 
Instagram-friendly 
content 
con-
demning Israel for defending itself and 
questioning the legitimacy of Israel’s 
very existence, which is an argument 
that in any other context would bring 
all hell down on the person foolish 
enough to say it out loud. 
The level of denial and misinforma-
tion about what is happening in Israel 
and why it is happening is appalling. 
Nearly every single member of the 
United Nations Security Council em-
barrassed themselves this weekend by 
embracing a generic draft statement 
condemning the violence but refusing 
to acknowledge the hundreds of Hamas 
rockets that started it. 
The U.N. has a shameful history of 
ignoring threats and violence against 
Israel, but rarely in recent memory has 
the Security Council so blatantly re-
gurgitated 
anti-Israel 
propaganda 
while Israeli civilians cower in fear 
under persistent rocket fire. 
Thankfully, the U.S. mission blocked 
the statement’s release, but I think it 
is important—important—to inject a 
little reality into the ongoing discus-
sion. 
First, we must acknowledge that 
Israel has the absolute right to defend 
itself, no matter the state of their rela-
tions with the Palestinian Authority. 
There is a world of difference between 
a state-sponsored terrorist attack on a 
civilian population and action taken to 
stop that attack. We have a responsi-
bility to counter the dangerous argu-
ment that because Hamas currently 
lacks the weapons capability to win 
this battle, Israel must stand by and 
allow terrorists to slaughter civilians. 
Second, I would encourage all of my 
colleagues to join me in making it 
clear that the United States is and will 
remain Israel’s closest friend and ally. 
We will continue to assist with the de-
velopment and production of advanced 
missile defense systems like the Iron 
Dome. We will not step away from that 
obligation simply because celebrity 
influencers would rather witness a 
slaughter than a proportionate re-
sponse to mass terror. 
Last, it is important to acknowledge 
that this violence is a symptom of a 
much more serious disease. Hamas ter-
rorists may be the ones launching 
rockets at civilians, but it is Iran, the 
world’s leading state sponsor of terror, 
that is paying for it. That is right, 
Madam 
President—it 
is 
Iran, 
the 
world’s leading state sponsor of ter-
rorism, that is footing the bill for these 
attacks. When we provide assistance 
and support to Israel, we are not just

protecting an ally; we are containing 
the destructive influence of our most 
belligerent adversary in the Middle 
East. 
This month, the Biden administra-
tion traveled to Vienna to negotiate 
sanctions relief with Iranian officials. 
Since then, President Biden has also 
spoken to Prime Minister Netanyahu 
and reaffirmed Israel’s right to defend 
itself from these attacks. 
However, I would take this oppor-
tunity to remind my Democratic col-
leagues that the United States des-
ignated Hamas as a terrorist organiza-
tion more than 20 years ago. That is 
right. For the past two decades, we 
have recognized Hamas as a terrorist 
organization. As a rule, we do not pro-
vide them assistance of any kind. They 
are a terrorist organization. But by 
opening the door to sanctions relief for 
Iran, we cannot help but enrich a re-
gime that will not stop until it de-
stroys Israel. That is their goal. We 
know it because they have told us that 
is their goal. We must not provide 
sanctions relief to Iran or give quarter 
to any regime that allies itself with 
this evil. 
It is my hope that all Americans will 
take some time this week to just 
unplug and think about this and reflect 
and then pray—pray that reason and 
wisdom will prevail as we seek an end 
to this outbreak of violence and the de-
feat of this terrorist group that wants 
to destroy the nation of Israel. 
TENNESSEE 
Madam President, this weekend, we 
had a positive development in the sta-
tus of the I–40 bridge that connects 
West Memphis, AR, and Memphis, TN. 
Just as a reminder, last week, inspec-
tors discovered a crack in one of the 
steel beams supporting the bridge. The 
crossing was immediately closed to all 
vehicle and barge traffic. On Friday 
morning, the Coast Guard reopened the 
stretch of Mississippi River that runs 
under the bridge, but the bridge itself 
remains closed indefinitely. 
Now, a lot of armchair experts have 
decided to sound off with the argument 
that this closure won’t affect local 
economies, but with all due respect, 
those making this argument really 
should spend a little bit more time out 
in the real world. This part of Middle 
America that we are talking about is 
an incredibly important part of our Na-
tion’s domestic supply chain. We have 
a 15-mile stretch along the Mississippi 
River, and that houses 68 waterfronted 
facilities. Thirty-seven of those facili-
ties are terminal facilities moving 
products such as petroleum, tar, as-
phalt, cement, steel, coal, salt, fer-
tilizers, rock and gravel, and grains. 
Shipping companies and cross-coun-
try trucking companies depend on the 
I–40 crossing, and so do the local gro-
cery stores, industrial facilities, res-
taurants, retail outlets that purchase 
the cargo, and, of course, our Nation’s 
farmers. 
Commercial trucking constitutes 25 
percent of all traffic that crosses the I– 
40 bridge. The river traffic that flows 
beneath the bridge is just as impor-
tant. When the Coast Guard reopened 
that stretch of the Mississippi, they 
had to juggle 60 vessels hauling more 
than 1,000 barges. Yes. We had a little 
traffic jam in the Mississippi River. 
It is amazing to me how quickly a 
problem like this does turn into a bot-
tleneck. 
Tennessee 
and 
Arkansas 
transportation officials are still work-
ing out a timeline for repairs, but as of 
now, the trucking industry is preparing 
for a downward spiral. 
According to the Arkansas Trucking 
Association, this could cost operators 
and their customers more than $2 mil-
lion a day, which is an amount that the 
industry actually cannot absorb. This 
means that the delay could end up 
costing consumers an additional $2 mil-
lion a day. And depending on what they 
are buying, they could also see empty 
shelves due to a supply chain interrup-
tion. 
Meanwhile, the Biden administration 
is putting all their energy and focus 
into checking items off of a decades-old 
wish list of social programs. They put 
forward 
an 
infrastructure 
package 
worth more than $2 trillion that wastes 
about two-thirds of this total pricetag 
on projects that have nothing to do 
with infrastructure, nothing to do with 
making sure that major bridges and 
thoroughfares are safe and open or ex-
panding broadband access or making 
sure that parents in rural Tennessee 
can get their kids to school without 
worrying that a rainstorm will flood 
the road on the way to town. This is 
making the American people feel so in-
credibly unsettled and very frustrated, 
and Tennesseans are pretty nervous 
about the future. 
If I could give the President one 
piece of advice, it would be this: If you 
want to waste time peddling Green 
New Deal policies or expanding social 
safety nets, admit it—just admit it. 
Call it what it is. Don’t call it infra-
structure and then turn around and 
throw pocket change at actual infra-
structure problems that need to be ad-
dressed right now. That mislabeling 
makes it look like you are trying to 
pull a fast one over the American peo-
ple, and it makes the American people 
believe that you really don’t care. And 
that is a dangerous message to send in 
the middle of a traumatic pandemic re-
covery, 
especially 
considering 
that 
prices are already on the rise. We see it 
in utilities. We see it at the gas pump. 
We see it in the packaged snacks we 
purchase for the children’s Sunday 
school class. Even basics in the produce 
section at the grocery store are begin-
ning to get out of reach. It is affecting 
basic nutrition. 
This is the Biden surcharge. We are 
paying a premium just to live from the 
moment our feet hit the floor in the 
morning to the time we brush our 
teeth and get into bed at night. The 
barebones cost of living is going up 
thanks to these reckless spending pri-
orities. 
My Democratic colleagues need to 
understand that a government subsidy 
cannot save a family from that kind of 
hit to their monthly budget, affecting 
everything from the moment their feet 
hit the floor in the morning to the 
time they brush their teeth and go to 
bed in the evening. 
The Biden administration is creating 
a perfect storm of income insecurity, 
shortages, and the uneasiness that 
comes 
when 
Americans 
see 
more 
month at the end of their money than 
money at the end of the month. 
They know how to manage their 
budget, and they know what they have 
to do when prices creep up 25 cents, $1 
or $2 at a time. Their instinct isn’t to 
reach out to the Federal Government 
for help; their instinct and their action 
is to cut back on the extras and to pre-
pare for harder times ahead. 
The only way to avoid this even now 
is to make prudent, targeted invest-
ments in economic recovery, supply 
chain security, cyber security, and, 
yes, actual real infrastructure projects. 
The American people cannot afford 
all the extras that are on the Demo-
cratic Party’s wish list. Their income 
can’t keep up with the inflation that is 
hitting their pocketbook every single 
day of the week. And they really are 
concerned with what will happen when 
those trend lines cross and inflation 
heads north every single day. 
I would, again, ask my Democratic 
colleagues to step back from the 
money printer and recognize the effect 
all this spending is having on American 
families. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER.

The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. MURPHY. Madam President, I

for the quorum call be rescinded.

Mr. MURPHY. Madam President, I 
come to the floor this afternoon to talk 
about two issues of vital importance to 
the United States and the world. 
First, I want to say a few words 
about the current violence paralyzing 
Israel and the Palestinian territories, 
but then I want to spend the bulk of 
my remarks on the future of nuclear 
proliferation in the Middle East. 
First, here in America, our hearts are 
breaking for Israelis and Palestinians.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2539 
May 17, 2021 
The images are just bone-chilling— 
rockets 
and 
interceptors 
streaking 
across the night sky, parents huddled 
with their children as air raid sirens 
ring out, tragic images of innocent 
Israeli and Palestinian civilians, in-
cluding children, injured or killed in 
the blasts. 
For many Americans who are turning 
on the news this week, it might appear 
that the events of the last few days 
erupted almost overnight. While ten-
sions are now reaching a fevered and 
deadly pitch, this cataclysm has been 
long in the making and no party, in-
cluding the United States of America, 
has completely clean hands. 
Zero-sum politics have driven both 
the decision making of the Netanyahu 
government and Palestinian leader-
ship, to the extent that there is such a 
thing as Palestinian leadership. Those 
decisions have led us to this crisis. 
Over 
and 
over, 
Prime 
Minister 
Netanyahu has pushed Israeli settle-
ments further into territory histori-
cally considered reserved for a future 
Palestinian State. The Israeli Govern-
ment, increasingly reliant on right-
wing, zero-sum political constituencies 
for its survival, also stepped up cam-
paigns to remove Palestinians from 
areas in East Jerusalem as a means to 
undermine the Palestinian claim to 
that section of the ancient city as the 
capital of a future state. 
The spark that lit the match of the 
existing conflagration was the Israeli 
effort to remove Palestinian families 
from their homes in the East Jeru-
salem neighborhood of Sheikh Jarrah 
and replace them with Israeli settlers. 
In February, the Israeli court ordered 
Palestinian families in that neighbor-
hood to vacate their homes by May 2 or 
they would be forcibly removed. Pro-
tests began, spread to other cities in 
Israel with large Arab populations, 
while the Palestinian families awaited 
a final ruling from the Israeli Supreme 
Court. 
As these protests spread and grew in 
size, Israeli police adopted some tactics 
that we have seen on display here in 
the 
United 
States—an 
overly 
securitized approach that only esca-
lated rather than defused the tension. 
Those crackdowns led to more protests 
and more clashes and a cycle that con-
tinued and continued. 
Then Israeli security forces stormed 
Islam’s third holiest site in Jerusalem 
during Ramadan prayers. Now, the 
Israelis contend that they were re-
sponding to a rock thrown from Pal-
estinians 
inside. 
The 
Palestinians 
argue it was the other way around. But 
whatever happened, at the end of that 
night, more than 330 Palestinians and 
22 Israelis had been injured. 
The story of the Palestinians’ con-
duct over the last decade is just as im-
portant in understanding the roots of 
the existing crisis. Fatah, the main po-
litical party representing Palestinians, 
has failed the people it represents. Ripe 
with internal conflict and corruption, 
Fatah lost its mandate to govern Gaza 
in 2006, when Hamas, an internation-
ally recognized terrorist organization, 
beat Fatah in parliamentary elections 
there that year. 
Hamas refuses to recognize the right 
of Israel to exist and advocates for the 
armed rebellion of Palestinians against 
Israel. Fatah, under pressure from 
Hamas to take more extreme positions, 
spent most of the last decade refusing 
any and all chance to negotiate with 
the Israelis, preferring to sit on the 
sidelines and nurture grievances. They 
were unable to deliver any real eco-
nomic benefit to the people under their 
charge in the West Bank, and the re-
sulting desperation of Palestinians fed 
this grievance culture even more. 
In response to those events I men-
tioned at Al Aqsa, Hamas and its allies 
in Gaza started firing rockets into 
southern and central Israel. Since that 
day, thousands of rockets have landed 
inside Israel. These rocket attacks 
were then responded to by an Israeli 
Government that has begun its own as-
sault inside Gaza, and as we sit here 
today, hundreds of Palestinians inside 
Gaza, including children, have been 
killed. Although there have not been as 
many casualties in Israel because of 
the defense-security relationship with 
the United States, Israelis have been 
killed as well. 
The Israelis were wrong to pursue 
settlements and evictions as a delib-
erate means to undermine a future Pal-
estinian state. These policies might 
have helped hold together Netanyahu’s 
political coalition, but they helped to 
feed a sense of hopelessness amongst 
Palestinians and their future. 
The 
Palestinian 
leadership 
was 
wrong to perpetuate an anti-Israeli, 
anti-Semitic narrative as a foundation 
of their hold on power. They were 
wrong to choose grievance over diplo-
macy. 
But the United States, over the last 4 
years, played a role too. President 
Trump rejected America’s historic role 
as a broker for peace and reconcili-
ation between Israelis and Palestin-
ians. He chose a side unconditionally, 
and his alliance with Netanyahu and 
his rejection of a Palestinian state 
drove the two parties further apart and 
turned the temperature up. Trump pur-
sued a path to intentionally create di-
vision rather than healing. Those 4 
years of America’s absence from its 
traditional post of mediator is also a 
big reason we are here today. 
There is going to be time to talk 
about the big picture—to talk about 
what went wrong and how American 
policy needs to change toward Israel 
and the West Bank and Gaza—but right 
now, our focus needs to be laser-like on 
deescalation, on a cease-fire. Hamas 
must stop its rocket attacks. They are 
war crimes. They are indiscriminate. 
They do nothing to help the Palestin-
ians in East Jerusalem or anywhere 
else. Israel needs to stand down its 
military campaign as well. They have 
to take off the table a ground invasion 
of Gaza. Israel possesses a dispropor-
tionate military power. That is why, 
during the 2014 invasion of Gaza, 2,000 
Palestinians died compared with fewer 
than 100 Israelis. But when children die 
in Gaza, it does nothing to secure 
Israel. In fact, it does the opposite. It 
just provides further fuel to this fur-
nace of grievances. 
So I am glad that the administration 
is sending Deputy Assistant Secretary 
Amr to the region, that he is there. It 
is critical that we also get a formal 
U.S. Ambassador to Israel in place as 
quickly as possible. But the United 
States needs to be pressing for a cease- 
fire. The United States can’t afford to 
simply allow for this escalation to con-
tinue. That is not in Israel’s best inter-
est, and that is not in America’s best 
interest. My hope is, in the conversa-
tions that are happening today be-
tween the Biden administration and 
the Netanyahu government, that they 
are talking about the terms to bring 
this violence to an end. 
Now, as to the second topic, I re-
cently spent 5 days in the Middle East 
last week. I came back just before this 
recent spate of violence began in Gaza 
and Israel. During the 5 days I was in 
the Middle East, I crossed paths with a 
bunch of Biden officials who were mak-
ing stops throughout the region, and I 
can report that, in setting aside the 
conflict in Israel—something that is 
pretty hard to do right now—there is 
some real positive news to bring back 
from the Gulf. 
The 4-year-long rift between Qatar 
and its Gulf neighbors is healing. There 
is now a new diplomatic energy behind 
cease-fire talks in Yemen, and the 
Saudis and the Iranians are in direct 
talks for the first time in years. All of 
this—I was repeatedly told by leaders 
in the Middle East—is happening be-
cause President Biden has made clear 
that deescalation is going to be re-
warded and supported by the United 
States—a stark departure from the 
Trump administration. 
Now, this is good news, but the bad 
news quickly follows, and it is this: If 
the United States does not reenter the 
Iran nuclear agreement, all of this nas-
cent progress is going to be at risk. 
Joe Biden ran on a promise to reen-
ter the Iran nuclear agreement. He 
made this commitment because he 
knew that this agreement was critical 
to American security. With Iran’s nu-
clear program curtailed and inspectors 
allowed to comb every inch of the 
country to look for signs of a secret en-
richment program, the world could 
breathe a sigh of relief in knowing 
that, for all of Iran’s other malevolent 
behaviors and policies, at least we 
knew that they were not developing a 
nuclear weapon. 
The achievement of the deal also 
brought together a set of really un-
likely bedfellows—the United States 
and Europe but also Russia and China. 
On Iran policy, with this coalition of 
regular adversaries, it was intact at 
the end of the Obama administration. 
It was ready to be picked up by Presi-
dent Trump to confront Iran’s ballistic

missile program or their support for re-
gional proxy forces like Hezbollah, but 
Trump went in a different direction. 
Instead of building on the Iran deal, he 
decided to put to test the theory of its 
opponents. That theory is this: that if 
the United States imposed unilateral, 
crippling sanctions on Iran, leaders in 
Tehran would limp to the negotiating 
table, cowed and willing to put all of 
the issues—nuclear enrichment, mis-
siles, human rights, proxy support—up 
for discussion. That is what Obama’s 
critics said he should have done, and 
those critics cheered when Trump took 
their advice. 
What happened, of course, was a pol-
icy cataclysm. Trump imposed the 
sanctions, and our partners, instead of 
following America’s lead, effectively 
took the Iranian side, even helping 
Iran work around our sanctions. Mak-
ing matters worse, when Trump sent 
word to the Iranians of our 12 demands, 
they refused to talk. Instead, they did 
the opposite. They ratcheted up their 
bad behavior. They sent more support 
to the Houthis in Yemen. They re-
started dormant parts of their nuclear 
program, reducing their breakout time 
to a weapon from just over a year to 
just under 3 months, and they resumed 
attacks on American forces in the re-
gion, both directly and through prox-
ies. 
Here is a pretty simple way to take a 
look at the success of the maximum 
pressure campaign. One element of the 
Iran nuclear deal was a commitment 
by Iran to reduce their enriched ura-
nium stockpile. You can see, in the 
years leading up to the deal, there is a 
dramatic escalation in the amount of 
enriched uranium the Iranians are 
holding. Then immediately upon the 
deal’s being reached, it plummets. Yet 
here is the bad news: As soon as the 
maximum pressure campaign is un-
veiled by President Trump, those num-
bers start to creep back up again. 
One chart explains to you the effect 
of Trump’s maximum pressure cam-
paign. It was a spectacular failure and 
definitive proof that the alternative 
approach, cheered by the Iran deal’s 
opponents—keep the sanctions in place 
until Iran totally capitulates—was a 
fantasy. Instead, the situation has em-
powered the more hardline wing of an 
already hardline regime who is pre-
pared to perpetually operate a resist-
ance economy and blame the United 
States for the nation’s suffering. 
Yet now those same critics of the nu-
clear agreement are back, and incred-
ibly, despite the writing inked on the 
wall during the past 4 years, their ar-
gument hasn’t changed a bit. Just keep 
doing what Trump did, and this time it 
will work, they say. They suggest that 
getting back into the nuclear deal, as 
Biden pledged during the campaign, 
isn’t enough. They want a new deal 
that includes a resolution to all of 
Iran’s bad acts, but unless we are pre-
pared to invade Iran and demand un-
conditional surrender—news flash: We 
are 
not—then 
that 
comprehensive, 
soup-to-nuts deal is a neoconservative 
fantasy. It doesn’t exist in real life. 
In real life, the achievable result is a 
restart of the nuclear agreement. The 
good news is that this result in 2021 
might have an even greater peace divi-
dend than when it was executed the 
first time in 2015. 
This brings me back to my trip to 
the region. I heard this story, while I 
was there, of how quickly talks on 
healing the Gulf Cooperation Council 
rift matured as soon as Biden won the 
election. Countries that were at one 
another’s 
throats 
throughout 
the 
Trump administration were suddenly 
coming to terms with one another. 
While conflict and bullying and score- 
settling—Trump’s calling cards—were 
rewarded during his term, countries 
quickly realized that diplomacy and 
deescalation would most quickly win 
favor with President Biden. 
In Oman, I heard how the Saudis 
were suddenly much more willing to 
make additional concessions in Yemen 
and how the Houthis were now more 
likely to trust the United States as an 
interlocutor. 
In 
Jordan, 
the 
King 
talked to us about how an Iraqi Gov-
ernment was now more welcoming than 
ever of help from places other than 
Iran, and he spoke of Jordan’s new 
overtures to a Baghdad Government in 
its looking for a more diverse set of al-
lies. And everyone in the region, at 
every stop, buzzed about these talks, 
these dialogues, between the Saudis 
and the Iranians. Reports suggest that 
these two countries wanted to talk 
during the Trump administration but 
were discouraged from doing so. 
This momentum toward peace is en-
couraging, but it is so fragile, and one 
major setback, one major, unexpected 
diplomatic hiccup, could turn all of 
this progress around. I worry that this 
hiccup could be the failure of America 
and Iran to get back into the nuclear 
agreement. If the talks fail and the 
Biden administration is forced to im-
plement Trump’s Iran policy for the 
next 4 years, complete with these uni-
lateral crippling sanctions, it is easy to 
see how all of this progress in the Gulf 
could disintegrate. The so-called Ira-
nian moderates would head back to 
Tehran with no deal and be defeated in 
the upcoming national elections. A 
harder line government, much less 
prone to diplomacy, would choose to 
scuttle peace talks in Yemen, end the 
outreach to the Saudis, and work like 
mad to make sure that their proxies in 
Iraq take power in the upcoming par-
liamentary elections. This could con-
vince the Saudis to double down mili-
tarily in Yemen and open up new fis-
sures in the Gulf. 
Listen, maybe I am wrong. Maybe 
this is an overly apocalyptic vision of 
what would occur if the nuclear nego-
tiations go south, but I fear that it is 
more accurate than fantastical that 
the stakes might be that high, which 
brings me, finally, to our negotiations 
in Vienna. If the consequences of suc-
cess are so promising and if the rami-
fications of failure are so dire, then 
what has to happen to guarantee a 
good outcome? And I will end here. 
First, the structure of the talks is 
deeply problematic, and that is the Ira-
nians’ fault. They are insisting on this 
shuttle diplomacy when we should be 
talking directly to them. 
Second, countries in Iran’s neighbor-
hood that were hostile or neutral to 
the talks in 2015 suddenly have their 
eyes wide open to the benefits of get-
ting back into the deal, so we should 
make sure that our partners in the 
Middle East who have the ear of the 
Iranian Government or the Supreme 
Leader are applying the appropriate 
pressure and letting Iran know that 
their relationships in the region are at 
risk if Iran fails to get back into the 
deal. 
On our side of the ledger, we need to 
be willing to be creative. Now, of 
course, any restart of the nuclear 
agreement is going to require the 
United States to drop the sanctions 
Trump applied to Iran’s economy—that 
had the same impact as the Obama-era 
nuclear sanctions. 
Yet here is the point I want to make: 
What about the other sanctions that 
Trump layered on top of the economic 
sanctions? For example, it should be 
expected that the Iranians would want 
us to lift Trump’s designation of its 
primary military force, the IRGC, as a 
terrorist 
organization. 
This 
wasn’t 
strictly a nuclear sanction, but it was 
certainly a key part of Trump’s max-
imum pressure campaign, and it was 
specifically designed to try to bring 
Iran back to the negotiating table on a 
nuclear program. 
In evaluating the wisdom of peeling 
back these noneconomic sanctions, it 
is important to remember that they 
were all completely feckless. These 
sanctions had no impact. In fact, their 
only impact was to worsen Iran’s be-
havior, so lifting them would have no 
practical negative impact. 
Just as importantly, lifting this par-
ticular designation, the one example I 
am posing to you today, is a rather 
technical exercise under the U.S. stat-
ute, and it actually doesn’t prevent us 
from sanctioning the truly bad actors 
in the Iranian military. For example, 
our sanctions on some of their most 
brutal interrogators—the IRGC’s inter-
rogators—would all stay in place even 
if we lifted that blanket IRGC designa-
tion. 
This is just one example of a Trump- 
era sanction whose erasure would have 
little to no practical impact. There are 
many more, but I use this example to 
show how weighing the equities, the 
benefits, of getting into the deal are 
going to be far greater than the imagi-
nary benefits of keeping many of 
Trump’s noneconomic sanctions. 
Now, let me be clear. If the sanctions 
like this are removed, opponents of the 
deal are going to cry bloody murder in 
that they are going to accuse Biden of 
giving more than Obama gave, but this 
is the exact trap that Trump was try-
ing to set for his successor. He applied

sanctions on Iran in connection with 
the pullout of the nuclear deal, but he 
called them nonnuclear sanctions, hop-
ing the next President would be caught 
in this sticky web. President Biden 
shouldn’t be bound by Trump’s tor-
tured sanctions logic. 
But, just as importantly, let me as-
sure you that no matter the particulars 
or the details of the agreement to re-
start the nuclear deal, the deal critics 
are going to oppose it, no matter what. 
They opposed it in 2015. They are going 
to oppose it again. 
What we should really be worried 
about is Trump’s Iran policy becoming, 
by accident, permanent, and this is 
what is likely to occur if the Vienna 
talks fail. Iran will continue to speed 
up its nuclear research program, the 
maximum pressure will continue, and a 
chill will be delivered to the deescala-
tion momentum in the region. 
But on the other hand, reentering the 
deal, while effectively already priced 
into a Biden electoral victory, will be 
seen as a diplomatic victory, at a per-
fect time to score a win for diplomacy, 
and the Middle East countries who 
have found new affection for a U.S.- 
Iran agreement will exhale. 
Now, I am not naive. I understand 
the Middle East has still dozens of in-
tractable crises, and the events of the 
last few days in Israel and Gaza are a 
reminder of the grave challenges that 
are still there. But the overall mood of 
deescalation in and around the Gulf is 
real, and it is much better than the old 
incentive structure for escalation. 
So I see these roots of positive 
change slowly, quietly growing, and, 
right now, the best way for the United 
States to nurture those grass shoots is 
to restart the Iran nuclear agreement. 
I yield the floor.

EL SALVADOR 
Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I want to 
call attention to recent events in El 
Salvador which have caused inter-
national concern, including in the U.S. 
Congress. 
I was a Senator in the 1980s, when so-
cial injustices and authoritarian re-
gimes in El Salvador led to a brutal 
civil war that lasted 12 years. I trav-
eled there during that period when the 
United States was supporting the Sal-
vador Armed Forces, despite their his-
tory of corruption and collusion with 
death squads that carried out political 
assassinations with impunity. 
Finally, in 1992, after tens of thou-
sands of lives lost and atrocities in-
cluding the assassination of Arch-
bishop Oscar Romero and six Jesuit 
priests and their housekeeper and her 
daughter by the Salvadoran Army, the 
two sides signed the Peace Accords 
that ended the war. Those Accords 
failed to solve the country’s historical 
problems, and the leaders of the Arena 
and FMLN parties failed to put imple-
mentation of the Accords above their 
own corrupt, political ambitions, for 
which they ultimately lost the support 
of the Salvadoran people. But the Ac-
cords did establish the foundation for 
democracy, including a clear separa-
tion of powers with checks and bal-
ances as well as a limited constitu-
tional role for the armed forces and the 
newly formed civilian police to avoid 
ever again being used for political pur-
poses or repression. 
I mention this history and the price 
in human suffering that was paid for 
the chance to build a peaceful, demo-
cratic society in El Salvador, at a time 
when key elements of the Peace Ac-
cords are under assault from within the 
government itself and President Nayib 
Bukele. 
In February 2020, in a show of force 
designed to intimidate the Salvadoran 
Congress, which at that time his party 
did not control, President Bukele, ac-
companied by heavily armed soldiers, 
occupied the legislative chamber to de-
mand passage of a law to pay for new 
equipment. Fifteen months later, after 
winning a supermajority in the Con-
gress, he turned his attention to the ju-
dicial branch. 
Under the Peace Accords, the Office 
of the Attorney General, formerly an 
appendage of the Executive that was 
used for repression and persecution of 
political opponents, became an inde-
pendent institution, acting as a fourth 
branch of government and appointed by 
a majority of Congress to a 3-year 
term. Since the Congress is also elect-
ed for 3-year terms, every Congress 
gets to appoint an Attorney General. 
The President has no say in the mat-
ter. 
The Attorney General can be re-
moved by a majority of Congress for 
just cause and in accordance with due 
process. 
Attorney 
General 
Raul 
Melara’s term was to end on January 6, 
2022, just 7 months from now, and the 
newly elected Congress could have se-
lected someone to replace him after

that date. However, on May 1, Presi-
dent Bukele’s supermajority in Con-
gress summarily removed Mr. Melara 
without cause and appointed a political 
loyalist as Melara’s replacement, con-
trary to the requirements of the Con-
stitution and raising serious doubts 
about the continued independence of 
the office. 
It is notable that prior to his dis-
missal, the ousted Attorney General, 
with U.S. support, was investigating a 
number of cases of corruption against 
top government officials, including a 
multibillion-dollar money laundering 
case. Then last week, in what can only 
be interpreted as a flagrant attempt to 
shield themselves from accountability, 
the Congress passed a law to provide 
retroactive immunity to all govern-
ment officials implicated in corruption 
involving 
spending 
linked 
to 
the 
COVID–19 pandemic. Also last week, 
the Assistant Attorney General in 
charge of the anti-corruption unit sud-
denly resigned, for reasons that have 
not been explained, and was also re-
placed by a Bukele loyalist. 
Those actions were just the begin-
ning. El Salvador’s Supreme Court has 
15 justices elected for 9-year terms and 
distributed among different chambers. 
Every 3 years, Congress can appoint 5 
justices from a list of 30 candidates 
submitted by the National Council of 
the Judiciary. The President has no 
say in the matter. 
Justices can be assigned to and 
transferred from any chamber, except 
justices in the Constitutional Chamber 
who are appointed by the Congress 
strictly for that chamber and cannot 
be transferred. The chief justice of the 
Supreme Court is also selected by Con-
gress from among the five members of 
the Constitutional Chamber. 
The newly elected Congress would 
have elected five justices from dif-
ferent chambers of the Supreme Court 
in June from the already submitted list 
of candidates. However, on May 1, the 
Congress removed all five justices from 
the Constitutional Chamber and their 
substitutes, without cause or due proc-
ess, arguing that their rulings were bi-
ased and contrary to the government’s 
policies. Out of those justices only one 
would have completed his term in 
June. The other four from the Con-
stitutional 
Chamber 
were 
serving 
terms until 2029. Apparently, the role 
of the judiciary as a separate branch of 
government that serves as an inde-
pendent check on Executive power in a 
democracy is unacceptable to Presi-
dent Bukele and his congressional al-
lies. 
The Congress appointed new justices 
but not from a list of candidates sub-
mitted by the National Council of the 
Judiciary. So not only was the sudden 
removal of justices unconstitutional; 
so was the appointment of new jus-
tices. 
The 
Constitutional 
Chamber 
had 
played an essential, historical role as a 
check on the Executive’s abuse of au-
thority, which is plainly why its jus-
tices were targeted for removal. The 
chamber often rebuked the Executive 
for overreaching in its actions, includ-
ing the Bukele-ordered military occu-
pation of the Congress in February 
2020. Thus, by removing the Attorney 
General and the Supreme Court jus-
tices, the Congress gave President 
Bukele control of all branches of gov-
ernment, creating a situation in which 
corruption can flourish with impunity. 
I have recounted these events be-
cause they have created a crisis that 
could have profound consequences for 
El Salvador, and for U.S.-Salvadoran 
relations. My concern is not only what 
it means for democracy in that country 
but what it could also mean for its 
economy and the livelihoods of its peo-
ple. The stifling of democracy ulti-
mately deprives already desperate peo-
ple—suffering from the COVID pan-
demic, two hurricanes in 2020, and gang 
violence—of any hope their lives will 
get better, and this desperation is a 
major driver of migration to the U.S. 
border. 
The United States has always been El 
Salvador’s largest trading partner and 
its largest donor. CAFTA—the Central 
America Free Trade Agreement—estab-
lished not only trade preferences but 
labor, 
health, 
and 
environmental 
standards. The results have been sig-
nificant. 
Forty-five percent of El Salvador’s 
exports go to the United States under 
CAFTA, which amounts to $2.6 billion 
a year. 
Thirty-five percent of its imports 
come from the United States, totaling 
$3.5 billion a year. 
There are nearly 3 million Salva-
dorans living in the United States, of 
whom 200,000 have temporary protected 
status. Collectively, they send $6 bil-
lion each year in remittances to their 
relatives 
in 
El 
Salvador, 
which 
amounts to 25 percent of the country’s 
GDP. 
On top of that, the United States has 
provided El Salvador with more than 
$700 million in aid through USAID, the 
Millennium Challenge Corporation, and 
other agencies in the last 5 years alone. 
Much of the progress made with those 
funds is now at risk of being washed 
away. 
The largest exporters in El Salvador 
are U.S. corporations, which are also 
the largest employers in El Salvador. 
President Bukele knows that his dic-
tatorial actions are a direct challenge 
to the United States and to the Biden 
administration’s emphasis on democ-
racy, human rights, and combating 
corruption in the region. Faced with 
criticism from the White House and the 
U.S. Congress, he may point to China 
as an alternative to the United States, 
as if a knight in shining armor from 
Beijing can gallop in and solve El Sal-
vador’s problems. 
But the people of El Salvador have no 
connection with China, and they are 
not about to cast aside their long-
standing relationship with the United 
States. Trade with China has always 
been one-way and characterized by 
dumping practices that have destroyed 
local industries in El Salvador. There 
are no major exports from El Salvador 
to China except occasional shipments 
of coffee and sugar. Chinese infrastruc-
ture projects do nothing to help unem-
ployed Salvadorians, when China sends 
the steel, concrete, and even the Chi-
nese workers to build them. 
The Salvadoran private sector knows 
that China isn’t the answer. They know 
the country cannot prosper without 
democratic institutions and the rule of 
law. 
El Salvador is a sovereign country, 
and President Bukele was democrat-
ically elected. He makes his own deci-
sions. But the choices he and his allies 
in the Salvadoran Congress make, that 
are eviscerating El Salvador’s demo-
cratic civilian institutions and empow-
ering the armed forces, have con-
sequences for U.S.-Salvadoran rela-
tions. They have consequences for our 
aid programs and for our support for fi-
nancing for El Salvador from the IMF, 
the 
Inter-American 
Development 
Bank, and the World Bank and for our 
trade relations, and for visas. 
This isn’t about national sovereignty 
and foreign interference, as President 
Bukele has falsely suggested. His ac-
tions directly affect the United States, 
U.S. companies, our commercial rela-
tions, and the welfare of millions of 
Salvadorans in the United States, as 
well as the Salvadoran population. 
I join others here and in El Salvador 
in urging President Bukele and the 
Salvadoran 
Congress 
to 
reconsider 
their unconstitutional actions and to 
restore the separation of powers and 
the rule of law. Don’t destroy the 
Peace Accords’ greatest achievement. 
End the attacks on the rule of law, re-
spect the tenure of other justices and 
the Human Rights Procurator, and ap-
point justices to the Constitutional 
Chamber and an Attorney General fol-
lowing the established procedures and 
ensuring that they are people with the 
necessary professional qualifications, 
integrity, and independence.

TRIBUTE TO BRIAN RIENDEAU 
Mr. 
MCCONNELL. 
Mr. 
President, 
throughout a year full of new and dif-
ficult challenges, the greater Louis-
ville region has been fortunate to have 
my friend Brian Riendeau helping lead 
the response. As the executive director 
of Dare to Care food bank, Brian has 
been instrumental in delivering tens of 
millions of quality and nutritious 
meals each year around this commu-
nity. His vision and talent support 
families when they need it most, and 
we owe him a major debt of gratitude. 
This summer, Brian will bring to a 
close his 12 years of remarkable leader-
ship at Dare to Care. I would like to 
take a moment today to recognize his 
accomplishments and thank him for 
his vast contributions to Kentucky. 
This last year wasn’t the first time 
I’ve watched Brian deliver for Ken-
tucky. Before we worked together in

his current role, I had the privilege of 
having Brian on my Senate staff. For 5 
years, he was an important adviser on 
legislation and Kentucky-focused pri-
orities. While I was sorry to see him 
leave my office, I was pleased to know 
he was headed to the Bluegrass. He 
spent more than a decade in corporate 
leadership at one of Louisville’s big-
gest employers before dedicating him-
self full-time to combating food insecu-
rity. 
In 2009, Brian joined Dare to Care 
with a plan. He wanted to expand the 
food bank’s physical footprint and its 
reach. Founded in Louisville more than 
50 years ago to address a troubling rise 
of malnutrition, Dare to Care partners 
with nearly 300 local organizations to 
promote healthy and active lifestyles 
across the community. Brian grew the 
staff to 60-strong and developed a strat-
egy to further invest in Louisville and 
the surrounding region. In the last few 
years, he completed a $7 million-plus 
capital campaign to build a new com-
munity kitchen to serve even more 
Kentuckians. 
I had the opportunity to see Brian’s 
operation firsthand last July. In the 
first months of the pandemic, demand 
for Dare to Care’s help jumped around 
35 percent. Brian and his team over-
came supply-chain disruptions, imple-
mented social distancing and other 
medical precautions, and continued 
serving those in need. In fact, once 
Brian’s team stocked its shelves, Dare 
to Care was even able to help other 
food banks in Kentucky fill their own. 
Brian’s forward-thinking and commit-
ment to service helped countless Ken-
tucky families during the hardest days 
of this pandemic. I am so grateful to 
him and his team for working around 
the clock to feed Kentucky. 
Dare to Care is well-positioned to 
continue fulfilling its mission for years 
to come, and Brian’s outstanding lead-
ership helped get it there. Whatever 
comes next for Brian and his wife Judy, 
I know I speak for his many admirers 
in wishing him all the best. I would 
like to express my personal gratitude 
for his years of dedication to Ken-
tucky, and I encourage my Senate col-
leagues to join me in congratulating 
Brian for his many successes.

ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS 
TRIBUTE TO WILLIAM ‘‘BILL’’ 
ALLEN, JR. 
∑ Mr. COONS. Mr. President, today it 
is my pleasure to honor William ‘‘Bill’’ 
Allen, Jr., local business leader, com-
munity activist, author, and friend, for 
his tremendous contributions to Dela-
ware and the growth and success of our 
communities. 
If you have ever met Bill Allen, you 
will know he has a wonderful smile 
that will grab your attention when you 
walk in the room and will get you smil-
ing as well. Bill is also serious about 
continuing to make important strides 
in inspiring and bettering our State. 
Throughout his extensive career in the 
collections solutions industry, Bill was 
often the first or most senior African 
American in his organizations. Bill 
consistently reached new levels and set 
important precedents, led change, and 
inspired young African Americans. The 
knowledge and experience Bill gained 
throughout his career in the collec-
tions solutions industry led him to 
start his own company, ALW Sourcing 
LLC, a collections and customer con-
tact solutions business that he leads 
with a wealth of knowledge, entrepre-
neurship, and industry experience. 
In 2000, Bill and his wife, Dr. Kim 
Allen, founded A Friend of the Family, 
Inc., AFOF, a Delaware-based incu-
bator for alternative learning pro-
grams. AFOF provides students with 
learning differences and behavioral 
challenges the tools and lessons nec-
essary to overcome personal, environ-
mental, and socioeconomic challenges. 
Under their leadership, the organiza-
tion strengthens and empowers our 
community. The success of AFOF led 
Bill to be featured in Business Week, 
the Baltimore Business Journal, and 
JET Magazine. 
He and Dr. Allen also teamed up to 
coauthor a book, ‘‘It Flows Through 
Us,’’ which describes how working hard 
and giving back can generate success 
and happiness. When writing the book, 
Bill focused on making it accessible to 
all people so that it could be used in 
the minority- and women-owned busi-
ness enterprise revolution. He also par-
ticipates in this revolution through the 
multiple seminars he conducts yearly 
to increase individuals’ understanding 
of business, diversity, leadership, moti-
vation, and success. Bill’s knowledge 
initiatives empower and inspire people 
to make positive changes that will im-
prove lives across communities. 
Bill served as the board chair of the 
African American Empowerment Fund, 
AAEFD, 
at 
Delaware 
Community 
Foundation and as a board member for 
the 
nonprofit 
charity 
Friends 
of 
Hockessin Colored School #107, FOHCS. 
During his time as chair, he led the 
fund 
to 
provide 
$100,000 
to 
the 
Hockessin Colored School #107, a his-
toric school that played a role in a 
groundbreaking court case that became 
part of the landmark Supreme Court 
decision, Brown v. Board of Education. 
A student at the school was a plaintiff 
in the 1952 Delaware Court of Chancery 
case Belton (Bulah) v. Gebhart, which 
was appealed to the U.S. Supreme 
Court jointly with Brown v. Board. 
Thanks to the funding that Bill helped 
secure, the historic school is now being 
transformed into a center for diversity 
training, inclusion, and social equity. 
Its legacy will continue and its purpose 
has been reignited. 
In my remarks at the reintroduction 
ceremony for this school, I stated that 
in order to change our future, we must 
confront our past. It is my firm belief 
that Mr. Allen’s commitments to our 
community and the revitalization of 
the Hockessin Colored School have 
played an important role in this mis-
sion and the growth and inclusivity of 
our State. 
In both business and community in-
volvement, all of Bill’s accomplish-
ments led to his induction into the 
Delaware Business Leaders Hall of 
Fame in 2020 as one of the first Afri-
can-American inductees. This honor 
was awarded to him by the Leadership 
Council of Junior Achievement of Dela-
ware, which recognized his influence as 
a business role model to the students 
whom the organization serves. I believe 
that this is a fitting testament to the 
great work Bill has done for our State. 
Mr. President, Bill has made invalu-
able contributions to Delawareans. He 
has used his knowledge and experience 
to invest in a wide array of commu-
nities and inspire hundreds of citizens. 
He is well respected for such contribu-
tions and this recognition is well de-
served. 
Bill Allen, on behalf of all you have 
supported 
and 
inspired 
throughout 
your career, please accept our sincere 
gratitude. Thank you for your unwav-
ering commitment to the Delaware 
community and for your dedication to 
your work that has brought about 
change, set important firsts, and in-
spired others. Thank you.∑

SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS 
SENATE RESOLUTION 217—DESIG-
NATING THE WEEK OF MAY 16 
THROUGH MAY 22, 2021, AS ‘‘NA-
TIONAL PUBLIC WORKS WEEK’’ 
Mr. 
INHOFE 
(for 
himself, 
Mr. 
CARDIN, Mr. CARPER, and Mrs. CAPITO) 
submitted the following resolution; 
which was considered and agreed to: 
S. RES. 217 
Whereas public works infrastructure, fa-
cilities, and services are of vital importance 
to the health, safety, and well-being of the 
people of the United States; 
Whereas public works infrastructure, fa-
cilities, and services could not be provided 
without the dedicated efforts of public works 
professionals, including engineers and ad-
ministrators, who represent State and local 
governments throughout the United States; 
Whereas public works professionals design, 
build, operate, and maintain the transpor-
tation systems, water infrastructure, sewage 
and refuse disposal systems, public buildings, 
sanitation and waste management systems, 
and other structures and facilities that are 
vital to the people and communities of the 
United States; 
Whereas public works professionals have 
played, and will continue to play, a key role 
in helping the United States recover from 
the COVID–19 pandemic; and 
Whereas understanding the role that public 
infrastructure plays in protecting the envi-
ronment, improving public health and safe-
ty, contributing to economic vitality, and 
enhancing the quality of life of every com-
munity of the United States is in the inter-
est of the people of the United States: Now, 
therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) designates the week of May 16 through 
May 22, 2021, as ‘‘National Public Works 
Week’’; 
(2) recognizes and celebrates the important 
contributions that public works profes-
sionals make every day to improve— 
(A) the public infrastructure of the United 
States; and 
(B) the communities that public works pro-
fessionals serve; and 
(3) urges individuals and communities 
throughout the United States to join with 
representatives of the Federal Government 
and the American Public Works Association 
in activities and ceremonies that are de-
signed— 
(A) to pay tribute to the public works pro-
fessionals of the United States; and 
(B) to recognize the substantial contribu-
tions that public works professionals make 
to the United States.

SENATE RESOLUTION 218—RECOG-
NIZING NATIONAL FOSTER CARE 
MONTH AS AN OPPORTUNITY TO 
RAISE AWARENESS ABOUT THE 
CHALLENGES OF CHILDREN IN 
THE FOSTER CARE SYSTEM, AND 
ENCOURAGING CONGRESS TO IM-
PLEMENT POLICIES TO IMPROVE 
THE LIVES OF CHILDREN IN THE 
FOSTER CARE SYSTEM 
Mr. GRASSLEY (for himself, Ms. 
STABENOW, Mr. KAINE, Mr. VAN HOL-
LEN, Mr. WARNOCK, Ms. ERNST, Ms. 
ROSEN, Ms. HASSAN, Mr. WYDEN, Mrs. 
CAPITO, Ms. KLOBUCHAR, Mr. CASEY, 
Mr. BROWN, Mr. SCOTT of South Caro-
lina, Mr. MARSHALL, Mr. BLUNT, Mrs. 
BLACKBURN, Mr. BARRASSO, Mr. COONS, 
and Mr. YOUNG) submitted the fol-
lowing resolution; which was consid-
ered and agreed to: 
S. RES. 218 
Whereas National Foster Care Month was 
established more than 30 years ago— 
(1) to bring foster care issues to the fore-
front of the national focus; 
(2) to highlight the importance of perma-
nency for every child; and 
(3) to recognize the essential role that fos-
ter parents, social workers, and advocates 
have in the lives of children in foster care 
throughout the United States; 
Whereas all children deserve a safe, loving, 
and permanent home; 
Whereas the primary goal of the foster 
care system is to ensure the safety and well- 
being of children while working to provide a 
safe, loving, and permanent home for each 
child; 
Whereas there are approximately 424,000 
children living in foster care; 
Whereas there were approximately 251,000 
youth that entered the foster care system in 
2019, while more than 122,000 youth were 
awaiting adoption at the end of 2019; 
Whereas more than 86,000 children entered 
foster care in 2019 due to parental drug 
abuse; 
Whereas children of color are more likely 
to stay in the foster care system for longer 
periods of time and are less likely to be re-
united with their biological families; 
Whereas foster parents— 
(1) are the front-line caregivers for chil-
dren who cannot safely remain with their bi-
ological parents;

(2) provide physical care, emotional sup-
port, and education advocacy; and 
(3) are the largest single source of families 
providing permanent homes for children 
leaving foster care to adoption; 
Whereas, compared to children in foster 
care who are placed with nonrelatives, chil-
dren in foster care who are placed with rel-
atives have more stability, including fewer 
changes in placements, have more positive 
perceptions of their placements, are more 
likely to be placed with their siblings, and 
demonstrate fewer behavioral problems; 
Whereas some relative caregivers receive 
less financial assistance and fewer support 
services than do foster caregivers; 
Whereas an increased emphasis on preven-
tion and reunification services is necessary 
to reduce the number of children that enter 
or re-enter the foster care system; 
Whereas 
the 
coronavirus 
disease 
2019 
(COVID–19) pandemic has created additional 
challenges for youth and families in the 
child welfare system, including delays in 
permanency, economic hardship, and disrup-
tions in education; 
Whereas over 20,000 youth ‘‘aged out’’ of 
foster care in 2019 without a legal permanent 
connection to an adult or family; 
Whereas children who age out of foster 
care lack the security or support of a bio-
logical or adoptive family and frequently 
struggle to secure affordable housing, obtain 
health insurance, pursue higher education, 
and acquire adequate employment; 
Whereas foster care is intended to be a 
temporary placement, but children remain 
in the foster care system for an average of 19 
months; 
Whereas, according to the Annie E. Casey 
Foundation, 35 percent of children in foster 
care experience more than 2 placements 
while in foster care, which often leads to dis-
ruption of routines and the need to change 
schools and move away from siblings, ex-
tended families, and familiar surroundings; 
Whereas youth in foster care are much 
more likely to face educational instability, 
with 1 study showing that 75 percent of fos-
ter youth experienced an unscheduled school 
change during a school year, compared to 21 
percent of youth not in foster care; 
Whereas children entering foster care often 
confront the widespread misperception that 
children in foster care are disruptive, unruly, 
and dangerous, even though placement in 
foster care is based on the actions of a par-
ent or guardian, not the child; 
Whereas 30 percent of children in foster 
care are taking at least 1 anti-psychotic 
medication, and 34 percent of those children 
are not receiving adequate treatment plan-
ning or medication monitoring; 
Whereas, according to a 2018 study, due to 
heavy caseloads and limited resources, the 
average annual turnover rate for child wel-
fare workers is between 14 percent and 22 
percent; 
Whereas States, localities, and commu-
nities should be encouraged to invest re-
sources in preventative and reunification 
services and postpermanency programs to 
ensure that more children in foster care are 
provided with safe, loving, and permanent 
placements; 
Whereas, in 2018, Congress passed the Fam-
ily First Prevention Services Act (Public 
Law 115–123; 132 Stat. 232), which provided 
new investments in prevention and family 
reunification services to help more families 
stay together and ensure that more children 
are in safe, loving, and permanent homes; 
Whereas Federal legislation over the 3 dec-
ades preceding the date of adoption of this 
resolution, including the Adoption Assist-
ance and Child Welfare Act of 1980 (Public 
Law 96–272; 94 Stat. 500), the Adoption and 
Safe Families Act of 1997 (Public Law 105–89; 
111 Stat. 2115), the Fostering Connections to 
Success and Increasing Adoptions Act of 2008 
(Public Law 110–351; 122 Stat. 3949), the Child 
and Family Services Improvement and Inno-
vation Act (Public Law 112–34; 125 Stat. 369), 
and the Preventing Sex Trafficking and 
Strengthening Families Act (Public Law 113– 
183; 128 Stat. 1919), provided new investments 
and services to improve the outcomes of 
children in the foster care system; 
Whereas May 2021 is an appropriate month 
to designate as National Foster Care Month 
to provide an opportunity to acknowledge 
the accomplishments of the child welfare 
workforce, foster parents, the advocacy com-
munity, and mentors for their dedication 
and accomplishments and the positive im-
pact they have on the lives of children; and 
Whereas much remains to be done to en-
sure that all children have a safe, loving, 
nurturing, and permanent family, regardless 
of age or special needs: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) supports the designation of May 2021 as 
National Foster Care Month; 
(2) recognizes National Foster Care Month 
as an opportunity to raise awareness about 
the challenges that children face in the fos-
ter care system; 
(3) encourages Congress to implement poli-
cies to improve the lives of children in the 
foster care system; 
(4) acknowledges the unique needs of chil-
dren in the foster care system; 
(5) recognizes foster youth throughout the 
United States for their ongoing tenacity, 
courage, and resilience while facing life chal-
lenges; 
(6) acknowledges the exceptional alumni of 
the foster care system who serve as advo-
cates and role models for youth who remain 
in foster care; 
(7) honors the commitment and dedication 
of the individuals who work tirelessly to pro-
vide assistance and services to children in 
the foster care system; 
(8) supports the designation of May 31, 2021, 
as National Foster Parent Appreciation Day; 
(9) recognizes National Foster Parent Ap-
preciation Day as an opportunity— 
(A) to recognize the efforts of foster par-
ents to provide safe and loving care for chil-
dren in need; and 
(B) to raise awareness about the increasing 
need for foster parents to serve in their com-
munities; and 
(10) reaffirms the need to continue working 
to improve the outcomes of all children in 
the foster care system through parts B and E 
of title IV of the Social Security Act (42 
U.S.C. 601 et seq.) and other programs de-
signed— 
(A) to support vulnerable families; 
(B) to invest in prevention and reunifica-
tion services; 
(C) to promote adoption in cases where re-
unification is not in the best interests of the 
child; 
(D) to adequately serve children brought 
into the foster care system; and 
(E) to facilitate the successful transition 
into adulthood for children that ‘‘age out’’ of 
the foster care system.

LENDING 
PRACTICES 
IN 
LATIN 
AMERICA AND THE CARIBBEAN. 
(a) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of 
Congress that— 
(1) since 2005, the Government of the Peo-
ple’s Republic of China has expanded sov-
ereign lending to governments in Latin 
America and the Caribbean, including gov-
ernments with a history of corruption and 
mismanagement, with loans that are repaid 
or collateralized with natural resources or 
commodities; 
(2) several countries in Latin American 
and the Caribbean that have received a sig-
nificant amount of sovereign lending from 
the Government of the People’s Republic of 
China face challenges in repaying such loans; 
(3) the Government of the People’s Repub-
lic of China’s predatory economic practices 
and sovereign lending practices in Latin 
America and the Caribbean negatively influ-
ence United States national interests in the 
Western Hemisphere; 
(4) the Inter-American Development Bank, 
the premier multilateral development bank 
dedicated to the Western Hemisphere, can 
play a significant role supporting the coun-
tries of Latin America and the Caribbean in 
achieving sustainable and serviceable debt 
structures; and 
(5) a tenth general capital increase for the 
Inter-American Development Bank could en-
hance the Bank’s ability to help the coun-
tries of Latin America and the Caribbean 
achieve sustainable and serviceable debt 
structures. 
(b) SUPPORT
FOR
A GENERAL CAPITAL IN-
CREASE.—The President should consider sup-
porting a tenth general capital increase for 
the Inter-American Development Bank if 
countries holding a majority of the shares in 
the Bank publicly endorse such a capital in-
crease.

trol Reform Act of 2018 (50 U.S.C. 4811 et seq.) 
is amended by inserting after section 1758 
the following: 
‘‘SEC. 1758A. REQUIREMENT TO CONTROL THE 
EXPORT 
OF 
CERTAIN 
PERSONAL 
DATA OF UNITED STATES NATION-
ALS 
AND 
INDIVIDUALS 
IN 
THE 
UNITED STATES. 
‘‘(a) IDENTIFICATION OF CATEGORIES OF PER-
SONAL DATA.— 
‘‘(1) IN GENERAL.—The President shall es-
tablish and, in coordination with the Sec-
retary and the heads of the appropriate Fed-
eral agencies, lead a regular, ongoing inter-
agency process to identify categories of per-
sonal 
data 
of 
covered 
individuals 
that 
could— 
‘‘(A) be exploited by foreign governments; 
and 
‘‘(B) if exported in a quantity that exceeds 
the threshold established under paragraph 
(3), harm the national security of the United 
States. 
‘‘(2) LIST REQUIRED.—The interagency proc-
ess established under paragraph (1)— 
‘‘(A) shall identify an initial list of cat-
egories of personal data under paragraph (1) 
not later than one year after the date of the 
enactment of the Protecting Americans’ 
Data From Foreign Surveillance Act of 2021; 
and 
‘‘(B) may, as appropriate thereafter, add 
categories to, remove categories from, or 
modify categories on, that list. 
‘‘(3) ESTABLISHMENT OF THRESHOLD.— 
‘‘(A) IN GENERAL.—Not later than one year 
after the date of the enactment of the Pro-
tecting Americans’ Data From Foreign Sur-
veillance Act of 2021, the interagency process 
established under paragraph (1) shall estab-
lish a threshold for the quantity of personal 
data of covered individuals the export, reex-
port, or in-country transfer (in the aggre-
gate) of which by one person to or in a re-
stricted country could harm the national se-
curity of the United States. 
‘‘(B) PARAMETERS.—The threshold estab-
lished under subparagraph (A) shall be the 
export, reexport, or in-country transfer (in 
the aggregate) by one person to or in a re-
stricted country during a calendar year of 
the personal data of not less than 10,000 cov-
ered individuals and not more than 1,000,000 
covered individuals. 
‘‘(C) CATEGORY
THRESHOLDS.—The inter-
agency process may establish a threshold 
under subparagraph (A) for each category of 
personal data identified under paragraph (1). 
‘‘(D) TREATMENT OF ENTITIES UNDER COM-
MON OWNERSHIP AS ONE ENTITY.—For purposes 
of determining whether a threshold estab-
lished under subparagraph (A) has been 
met— 
‘‘(i) personal data shall be considered to be 
exported, reexported, or in-country trans-
ferred by one person if the personal data is 
exported, reexported, or in-country trans-
ferred by entities under common ownership 
or control; and 
‘‘(ii) the parent entity of such entities 
shall be liable for export, reexport, or in- 
country transfer in violation of this section. 
‘‘(E) CONSIDERATIONS.—In establishing a 
threshold under subparagraph (A), the inter-
agency process shall seek to balance the 
need to protect personal data from exploi-
tation by foreign governments against the 
likelihood of— 
‘‘(i) impacting legitimate business activi-
ties and other activities that do not harm 
the national security of the United States; 
or 
‘‘(ii) chilling speech protected by the First 
Amendment to the Constitution of the 
United States. 
‘‘(4) DETERMINATION OF PERIOD FOR PROTEC-
TION.—The interagency process established 
under paragraph (1) shall determine, for each 
category of personal data identified under 
that paragraph, the period of time for which 
encryption technology described in sub-
section (b)(4)(C) is required to be able to pro-
tect that category of data from decryption 
to prevent the exploitation of the data by a 
foreign government from harming the na-
tional security of the United States. 
‘‘(5) PROCESS.—The interagency process es-
tablished under paragraph (1) shall— 
‘‘(A) be informed by multiple sources of in-
formation, including— 
‘‘(i) publicly available information; 
‘‘(ii) classified information, including rel-
evant information provided by the Director 
of National Intelligence; 
‘‘(iii) information relating to reviews and 
investigations of transactions by the Com-
mittee on Foreign Investment in the United 
States under section 721 of the Defense Pro-
duction Act of 1950 (50 U.S.C. 4565); 
‘‘(iv) the categories of sensitive personal 
data described in paragraphs (1)(ii) and (2) of 
section 800.241(a) of title 31, Code of Federal 
Regulations, as in effect on the day before 
the date of the enactment of the Protecting 
Americans’ Data From Foreign Surveillance 
Act of 2021, and any categories of sensitive 
personal data added to such section after 
such date of enactment; 
‘‘(v) information provided by the advisory 
committee established pursuant to para-
graph (7); and 
‘‘(vi) the recommendations (which the 
President shall request) of— 
‘‘(I) privacy experts identified by the Na-
tional Academy of Sciences; and 
‘‘(II) experts on the First Amendment to 
the Constitution of the United States identi-
fied by the American Bar Association; and 
‘‘(B) take into account the significant 
quantity of personal data of covered individ-
uals that has already been stolen or acquired 
by foreign governments, the harm to United 
States national security caused by the theft 
of that personal data, and the potential for 
further harm to United States national secu-
rity if that personal data were combined 
with additional sources of personal data. 
‘‘(6) NOTICE
AND
COMMENT
PERIOD.—The 
President shall provide for a public notice 
and comment period after the publication in 
the Federal Register of a proposed rule, and 
before the publication of a final rule— 
‘‘(A) identifying the initial list of cat-
egories of personal data under subparagraph 
(A) of paragraph (2);

egories from, or modifying categories on, 
that list under subparagraph (B) of that 
paragraph; 
‘‘(C) establishing the threshold under para-
graph (3); or 
‘‘(D) setting forth the period of time for 
which encryption technology described in 
subsection (b)(4)(C) is required under para-
graph (4) to be able to protect such a cat-
egory of data from decryption. 
‘‘(7) ADVISORY COMMITTEE.— 
‘‘(A) IN GENERAL.—The Secretary shall es-
tablish an advisory committee to advise the 
Secretary with respect to privacy and sen-
sitive personal data. 
‘‘(B) APPLICABILITY OF FEDERAL ADVISORY 
COMMITTEE
ACT.—Subsections (a)(1), (a)(3), 
and (b) of section 10 and sections 11, 13, and 
14 of the Federal Advisory Committee Act (5

protection, surveillance, and export control 
laws in the foreign country to which the cov-
ered personal data would be exported or reex-
ported, or in which the covered personal data 
would be transferred, in order to determine

EXTENDING WIFIA LOAN TERMS 
HON. JOHN GARAMENDI 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, May 17, 2021 
Mr. GARAMENDI. Madam Speaker, recently 
I introduced a necessary amendment to the 
Water Infrastructure Finance and Innovation 
Act of 2014 (WIFIA). This provision was in-
cluded in my ‘‘WIFIA Improvement Act of 
2020’’ (H.R. 8217) from last Congress. I thank 
my colleague Congressman NEWHOUSE (R– 
WA) for his support as the original cosponsor 
this year. 
Our bipartisan bill would allow local commu-
nities seeking to build water infrastructure 
projects to secure federally guaranteed financ-
ing under the U.S. Environmental Protection 
Agency’s WIFIA loan program with a 55-year 
repayment schedule rather than the current 
35-year loan term. This change would unlock 
low-interest WIFIA financing for projects with 
longer lifecycles like the off-stream Sites Res-
ervoir Project in my Congressional district and 
similar water storage projects. 
For fiscal year 2021, Congress made more 
than $11.5 billion in federal WIFIA loans avail-
able. By making WIFIA loan terms more work-
able for projects with longer lifecycles, at no 
risk to the taxpayer, this bill will allow Cali-
fornia and other western states to modernize 
water infrastructure and better meet future 
water supply needs. 
Madam Speaker, I urge all members to co-
sponsor this bipartisan bill to unlock the fed-
eral financing necessary to construct the water 
infrastructure of the future. I plan to make this 
bipartisan bill a major priority in my work as a 
member of the House Committee on Trans-

HONORING MR. ROBERT KANE 
HON. STEVEN M. PALAZZO 
OF MISSISSIPPI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, May 17, 2021 
Mr. PALAZZO. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to honor the outstanding work of Mr. Robert 
Kane. 
Robert was born in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, 
and currently resides in Bay St. Louis, Mis-
sissippi. He is the proud father to two sons, 
John Regan and Sanders Burke. Along with 
his two daughters in law, he has been blessed 
with four beautiful grandchildren Anne Pierson, 
Waring, Kate, and Grace. 
Robert graduated from Louisiana State Uni-
versity in 1969 with a bachelor’s degree in Po-
litical Science. Following his graduation in 
1974, he obtained his real estate license in 
the State of Mississippi. Robert began his ca-
reer in real estate in the hopes that, one day, 
he could open his own real estate business. 
As the owner of the Robert Kane Management 
Company and part-owner of Greater Gulfport 
Properties, Incorporated, I believe he has suc-
ceeded. 
Not only is Robert an astute business 
owner, he is also known for his tireless public 
service. In fact, in 2017, the Hancock County 
Port and Harbor Commission found it only fit-
ting to dedicate their new 8,000 square foot 
administrative building in honor of his 23 years 
of leadership as President of the Commission. 
For decades, Robert has volunteered with 
multiple civic, business, and social organiza-
tions. He is a lifelong member of the Hancock 
County Republican Executive Committee and 
for the past twenty years, produced one of the 
best barbeque fundraisers in Hancock County. 
Today, we recognize Mr. Robert Kane for 
his outstanding service to the Republican 
Party, the State of Mississippi, and to Hancock 
County.

RECOGNIZING THE VA NORTHERN 
INDIANA 
WOMEN’S 
VETERAN 
HEALTH CLINIC 
HON. JIM BANKS 
OF INDIANA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, May 17, 2021 
Mr. BANKS. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
recognize the VA Northern Indiana Women’s 
Veteran Health Clinic for their service to 
women veterans in our community. 
The VA Northern Indiana Health Care Sys-
tem is committed to providing high-quality 
services in a sensitive and safe environment. 
In the clinic, each woman veteran is assigned 
a Women’s Health Primary Care Provider; 
each provider is trained to deliver comprehen-
sive primary care in any number of programs. 
With 3,383 women veterans currently en-
rolled in the VA Northern Indiana Health Care 
System, the clinic provides maternity care pro-
grams, general health and wellness programs, 
baby shower preparation, sexual trauma serv-
ices and more. 
As a veteran myself and member of the 
House Veterans’ Affairs Committee in Con-
gress, I am honored to have served in uniform 
and to serve the people of northeast Indiana 
in Congress. One of my top priorities has 
been, and always will be, ensuring those who 
served the United States receive the honor, 
opportunity and care they deserve. 
This is a testament to the honor and sac-
rifice of those heroes who have served our 
country, and to those who serve them.

RECOGNITION 
OF 
THE 
6TH 
UNITED NATIONS GLOBAL ROAD 
SAFETY WEEK 
HON. RICHARD HUDSON 
OF NORTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, May 17, 2021 
Mr. HUDSON. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
as co-chair of the Global Road Safety Caucus 
to mark the 6th United Nations Global Road 
Safety Week, which begins today. 
In September 2020, the United Nations 
passed a resolution declaring the years 2021 
through 2030 a new Decade of Action for 
Road Safety. Additionally, the United Nations 
Sustainable Development Goal 3.6 includes a 
call to address the personal, medical, and fi-
nancial burdens associated with road traffic 
deaths and injuries. 
The number of deaths on the world’s roads 
remains unacceptably high, with an estimated 
1.35 million people dying each year. But this 
is not just an issue in other countries. The Na-
tional Safety Council (NSC) says deaths from 
motor vehicles rose 8 percent last year in the 
United States, with as many as 42,060 Ameri-
cans dying in vehicle crashes. Also according 
to the State Department, road crash deaths 
are the single greatest cause of death for 
Americans traveling abroad. 
As the Congress and the Biden administra-
tion consider investing in infrastructure, we 
must ensure these investments promote safety 
practices through a safe-systems approach 
and improve our roads and other infrastructure 
in ways that protect people and families. And 
as Americans begin traveling domestically and 
internationally again as we emerge from the 
Covid–19 pandemic, we should be cognizant 
of the many risk factors, including increased 
speed, that significantly increase the prob-
ability of death or injury. 
By recognizing Global Road Safety Week 
and the 2nd Decade of Action for Road Safe-
ty, together we can make a difference in stem-
ming the tide of the road crash epidemic in the 
United States and around the world. Ulti-
mately, we should do everything in our power 
to protect the lives of all road users, and I 
hope to work with my colleagues on both 
sides of the aisle to do that.

many years Brent has been involved with 
scouting, he has not only earned 29 merit 
badges, but also the respect of his family, 
peers, and community. Most notably, Brent 
has shown his leadership skills by maintaining 
the role of Patrol Leader, Den Chief and Troop 
Guide. Brent also holds the rank of Tom Tom 
Beater in the Tribe of Mic-O-Say and is an Or-
deal member of the Order of the Arrow. Brent 
has also contributed to his community through 
his Eagle Scout project where he and his fel-
low Scouts and Scouters poured a concrete 
sidewalk to extend it to provide wheelchair ac-
cess to the play area, firepit and picnic table. 
Madam Speaker, I proudly ask you to join 
me in commending Brent Stark for his accom-
plishments with the Boy Scouts of America 
and for his efforts put forth in achieving the 
highest distinction of Eagle Scout.

HONORING MICHAEL CARPENTER 
FOR THE DISTINGUISHED REC-
OGNITION AS CLINTON COMMU-

COLLEGE’S 
FIRST 
EDU-
CATION CHAMPION 
HON. ELISE M. STEFANIK 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, May 17, 2021 
Ms. STEFANIK. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor Mr. Michael Carpenter, named 
as the inaugural Education Champion by Clin-
ton Community College. 
Michael has been the president and CEO of 
The Northeast Group since 2008. Throughout 
his time with the company, his leadership and 
foresight have expanded The Northeast Group 
from a small print shop to four regional facili-
ties providing an array of printing, publishing, 
and logistics services. However, Michael’s in-
fluence and impact extends far beyond his 
business prowess. While Michael has had 
great success in the business world, he has 
also been an extremely impactful community 
leader. He currently serves on the Substance 
Abuse Prevention and Recovery of Clinton 
County Steering Committee, the Plattsburgh 
Chamber of Commerce Board of Directors, 
and the Clinton County Community Service 
Board. He has also previously served on the 
Workforce Investment Board, Strand Center 
for the Arts Board, the Literacy Volunteers, 
and Vision2Action Task Force as Chairman. 
For more than 30 years, Michael has relent-
lessly dedicated himself to helping individuals 
recover from addiction, ensuring they have 
sound and necessary support systems in 
place. In conjunction with Clinton Community 
College, Michael launched the MHAB Life 
Skills Campus, a revolutionary program to 
offer transitional housing and a community 
space for those in recovery. In an effort sup-
ported by local nonprofit agencies, this pro-
gram converted vacant dormitories into a cam-
pus where individuals can live, complete job 
training, literacy, and budgeting classes, and 
receive counseling services and drug treat-
ment. Michael’s work on this program has had 
an immeasurably positive impact on his com-
munity. He was also integral in bringing Club 
12 to Plattsburgh, offering a welcoming space 
to host and encourage those working towards 
recovery through a 12-step program. 
Michael has been an incredible advocate for 
the recovery community in the North Country. 
He has shared his personal testimony of over-
coming addiction and constantly works to sup-
port others in that same journey. On behalf of 
New York’s 21st District, I would like to thank 
Michael for his contributions to the Plattsburgh 
community and congratulate him on his inno-
vative solution turning the unused dormitories 
into a thriving community gathering space.

HONORING MRS. NELL FRISBIE 
HON. STEVEN M. PALAZZO 
OF MISSISSIPPI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, May 17, 2021 
Mr. PALAZZO. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to honor the outstanding work and dedication 
of Mrs. Nell Frisbie. 
Mrs. Janet Gynell (‘‘Nell’’) Frisbie was born 
and raised in Meridian, Mississippi. She grad-
uated from Meridian High School and attended 
the University of Southern Mississippi where 
she was a member of the Kappa Delta sorority 
and a Varsity cheerleader. 
After attending Southern Miss, Nell moved 
to New Orleans where she was employed as 
a secretary for Continental Casualty Company. 
There she met and married the late William 
(‘‘Bill’’) Frisbie, an attorney, on June 10, 1961. 
In October 1962, Nell and Bill were blessed 
with a daughter, Joellyn. 
Nell is a longtime Republican activist at the 
local, state, and national levels. She has re-
cruited and campaigned for hundreds of Re-
publican candidates at all levels of govern-
ment, including supporting her husband, Bill, 
in his candidacy for City Council and Justice 
Court Judge. 
Nell’s passion for good government started 
at a young age. As a preschooler, she at-
tended political rallies with her father. By the 
time she was a teenager, Nell was actively in-
volved in local campaigns. 
Nell has gone on to serve the Republican 
Party in almost too many ways to name. She 
was Chairman of the Hancock County Execu-
tive Committee for two terms and served two 
terms as President of the Hancock County Re-
publican Women’s Club. She has attended 
seven Republican National Conventions as a 
delegate and was on the Rules Committee at 
the 2016 Convention. 
Nell was appointed to the Mississippi Re-
publican Party Executive Committee and 
served as State President and 4th District Di-
rector for the Mississippi Federation of Repub-
lican Women. She has been invited to speak 
at Republican Women events in many states 
ranging from Georgia to California. Nell has 
had the honor of meeting former Presidents: 
Ronald Reagan, George H.W. Bush, George 
W. Bush, and former Vice President Mike 
Pence. She has worked to elect four Mis-
sissippi governors as well as many U.S. Sen-
ators and Congressmen and several state and 
local officials. 
She has a gift for grassroots activism and 
organization, using her network and leadership 
skills to organize campaign headquarters and 
orchestrate volunteer activities. If you want to 
hear a funny story, ask Nell about ‘‘delivering 
a message to Congress’’. Today we recognize 
Mrs. Nell Frisbie for her outstanding service to 
the Republican Party, the State of Mississippi 
and Hancock County. 
IN HONOR OF THE 67TH ANNIVER-
SARY OF BROWN V. BOARD OF 
EDUCATION 
HON. TERRI A. SEWELL 
OF ALABAMA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, May 17, 2021 
Ms. SEWELL. Madam Speaker, on the 67th 
anniversary of the Supreme Court’s Brown v. 
Board of Education ruling, I rise to pay tribute 
to the three living students who desegregated 
universities within Alabama’s 7th Congres-
sional District, as well as Attorney Fred Gray 
who assisted and led the litigation for each of 
these students. 
Over 60 years ago today, the United States 
Supreme Court declared that the doctrine es-
tablished by Plessy v. Ferguson of ‘‘separate 
but equal’’ no longer reflected this country’s 
moral and legal principles. Officially declaring 
racial segregation in schools as unconstitu-
tional, this case established and upheld the 
American principles of racial equality and jus-
tice for all. While Brown v. Board of Education 
was a landmark decision towards a more just 
and equal America, Dr. King said, ‘‘the arc of 
the moral universe is long.’’ While this case 
blazed trails for the progression of our society, 
the legacy of Jim Crow has deep roots, mak-
ing it our responsibility to continue to fight 
against injustice. 
This year, as we honor the living, breathing 
legacy of the Brown decision, it is critically im-
portant that we pay tribute to the sacrifices 
made by the three living students who took on 
the charge of desegregating institutions of 
higher education in Alabama: Autherine Lucy 
(age 91), Wendall Gunn (age 79), and Harold 
Franklin (age 88). 
On September 4, 1952, Autherine Lucy sub-
mitted her application to the then segregated 
University of Alabama. Despite being accepted 
to the university, once the administration real-
ized that Autherine was African American, her 
acceptance was withdrawn. Autherine was al-
lowed to attend the university after receiving 
support from the community, two civil rights at-
torneys, and the Brown decision. As the first 
institution of higher education to be tested by 
the Brown decision, many believed that 
Autherine’s sacrifices set the precedent for in-
tegrating institutions of higher education, yet 
many minority students after her continued to 
fight against institutionalized segregation. 
In July 1963, 7 years after Autherine was 
admitted to the University of Alabama, Wen-
dell Gunn attempted to enroll in Florence Col-
lege, now known as the University of North 
Alabama. After being sent to the university 
president’s office, Wendell was told that he 
could not be admitted without a federal court 
order. Once again, attorney Fred Gray took on 
the case upholding his simple declaration to 
‘‘destroy everything segregated.’’ 
In January of the following year, Harold 
Franklin walked onto the campus of Auburn 
University as the school’s first African Amer-
ican student. Similarly, Harold’s enrollment to 
the university was met with strong opposition 
from those dedicated to preserving segrega-
tion within public schools despite the Brown 
decision. As a result, after ‘‘completing’’ every 
requirement to obtain his master’s degree, he 
was not able to defend his master’s thesis and 
graduate until February of 2020. 
As a proud product of Selma High School 
and its first Black valedictorian, I stand on the

shoulders of so many who were denied ac-
cess to great public schools in the name of in-
stitutionalized segregation. Understanding this, 
we know that 67 years later the fight to ensure 
that all people are afforded access to a quality 
education continues throughout this Nation. 
Today as we reflect on the Brown v. Board of 
Education decision, may we be renewed by 
the tenacity and bravery of Autherine Lucy, 
Wendall Gunn, and Harold Franklin and the 
perseverance of Attorney Fred Gray. 
On behalf of Alabama’s 7th Congressional 
District, I ask my colleagues to join me in pay-
ing tribute to these three students and Attor-
ney Gray for their contributions to reshaping 
education in Alabama and across our Nation.

CONGRATULATING 
THE 
OZARK 
HIGH SCHOOL ARMY JROTC PRO-
GRAM 
HON. BILLY LONG 
OF MISSOURI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, May 17, 2021 
Mr. LONG. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
congratulate the Ozark High School Army Jun-
ior Reserve Officer Training Corps (AJROTC), 
for receiving National Championships in four 
separate disciplines, Raider Competition, Air 
Rifle Three Position Competition, Armed Drill 
Competition, and Unarmed Drill Competition. 
This is the first time in the history of AJROTC 
that one school has accomplished such a feat. 
First created in 1916, AJROTC programs 
have expanded to over 1,700 schools nation-
wide. The goal of these programs is to de-
velop Cadets into young men and women of 
impeccable character. A major part of the pro-
gram is the development of leadership skills. 
As the Cadets progress, they are given the 
opportunity to lead younger Cadets. The 
teaching of the skills molds these men and 
women into the leaders of tomorrow. 
The AJROTC program would not succeed 
without the hard work of dedicated instructors. 
There are currently nearly 4,000 instructors 
nationwide. They come from a variety of back-
grounds and are all retired from either active 
duty, reserve duty, or the National Guard. 
Among these dedicated individuals are 3 in-
structors from Ozark High School. Major 
Danny Cazier, Chief Warrant Officer 3 Jason 
Allen, and 1st Sergeant William Crawford have 
more than 60 years of Army and Training ex-
perience. They have worked tirelessly to instill 
in their Cadets the values of citizenship, com-
munity and national service, personal respon-
sibility, and a sense of accomplishment. It is 
thanks to their hard work that Ozark High 
School AJROTC accomplished so much this 
year. 
The Cadets of Ozark High School AJROTC 
are incredibly hard-working individuals. They 
begin their practices at 5:00 am, and they fre-
quently sacrifice their Saturdays to the com-
petitions. Their Drill Team also provides Cere-
monial Color Guard for a variety of community 
events. All of this is in addition to their school-
work. 
Madam Speaker, it is clear that our nation 
needs more young men and women who dem-
onstrate a strong devotion to their community 
and country. The cadets of Ozark High School 
AJROTC live these values every day. I com-
mend Major Cazier, Chief Warrant Officer 3 
Allen, and 1st Sergeant Crawford, and all the 
Cadets of Ozark High School for their historic 
achievements this past year and wish them 
well in their future competitions.

HONORING JACQUE HOWELL AS 
IOWAN OF THE WEEK 
HON. CYNTHIA AXNE 
OF IOWA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, May 17, 2021 
Mrs. AXNE. Madam Speaker, in honor of 
Child Care Provider Appreciation Day, I would 
like to recognize Jacque Howell, director of 
Red Oak Child Development Center. Jacque 
has led the way in expanding childcare op-
tions in her rural community of Red Oak, Iowa. 
Childcare is an especially scarce resource 
in Iowa. In 2018, 41 percent of our cities had 
children but no known childcare and 48 per-
cent have some childcare but fewer slots than 
there are children. As you might imagine, this 
has a significant impact on our workforce and 
economy as many families struggle to balance 
parenthood and employment. In Montgomery 
County where Jacque and her family live, 
there were 1,183 children under the age of 9 
but only 435 available spaces in existing li-
censed childcare facilities. 
In 2019, Jacque attended a meeting with 
the Iowa Women’s Foundation and was faced 
with many of these same statistics and was 
blown away by the lack of available quality 
care in Iowa. That’s when she sprang into ac-
tion and gathered others to start the Red Oak 
Child Development Center. Jacque was hired 
as director of the center in January 2020 and 
raised an impressive $1.2 million in funds to 
bring this dream to reality. 
Red Oak Child Development Center is a 
special organization as they partner with their 
local school district to make the care more ac-
cessible. They have also opted to offer infant 
care, a service that isn’t provided by other 
care facilities in their community. The center is 
currently working on expanding its location to 
house two additional infant care rooms. Cur-
rently, they have 100 children enrolled in their 
care and they see an average of 70 to 75 of 
those children daily. They were baffled by how 
quickly they were able to fill their spots and 
continue to receive enrollment applications 
daily. Red Oak Child Development Center 
aims to provide quality, affordable childcare to 
their community. They accept childcare assist-
ance with just over a quarter of their children 
receiving that support. It’s clear that they are 
filling a significant need as some families drive 
up to 30 minutes one-way just to take their 
children to care. 
Jacque says that educating the next genera-
tion of lowan’s is something that has been a 
lifelong passion of hers. She understands that 
children are truly our future and she endeav-
ors to provide children with support, love, and 
encouragement. As the director of the Red 
Oak Child Development Center, she’s been 
able to help build an organization that believes 
in quality over quantity, supports the social, 
emotional, and cognitive development of all 
children. Jacque also recognizes the impor-
tance of her amazing staff members and their 
ever-supportive community as they work to-
gether to continue to build what is already an 
incredible child development center. 
Jacque’s dedication to the children in her 
community is not only vital to the development 
of the children but also empowers families to 
reengage in their local economy as they are 
able to get back to work and rest easy know-
ing their kids are in good care. Because of 
that, it is my honor to recognize Jacque How-
ell as our Iowan of the Week.

IN SUPPORT OF H.R. 1447—COAST 
RESEARCH ACT OF 2021 AND H.R. 
2533—NEAR ACT OF 2021 
HON. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, May 17, 2021 
Ms. JOHNSON of Texas. Madam Speaker, 
I rise in support of H.R. 1447, the Coastal and 
Ocean Acidification Stressors and Threats, or 
COAST, Research Act of 2021. I also rise in 
support of H.R. 2533, the National Estuaries 
and Acidification Resarch, or NEAR, Act of 
2021. 
These two bipartisan bills supporting ocean 
acidification research passed the House under 
suspension last Congress. The oceans have 
absorbed excess carbon dioxide in the atmos-
phere from the burning of fossil fuels. The re-
sulting rise in ocean acidity levels has been 
shown to cause harm to marine life. Orga-
nisms like oysters, clams, and corals have dif-
ficulty building their shells and skeletons in 
more acidic environments. Higher acidity also 
alters the behavior of some fish. Ocean acidifi-
cation threatens the vitality of our coastal 
economies. We need to get ahead of the 
problem of ocean acidification before it causes 
even greater economic harm. 
Congresswoman BONAMICI’s COAST Re-
search Act reauthorizes and updates the Fed-
eral Ocean Acidification Research and Moni-
toring Act. The bill supports the ocean acidifi-
cation program at the National Oceanic and 
Atmospheric Administration, or NOAA. The bill 
has several updates to improve the text from 
last Congress, with bipartisan agreement. 
This year marks 10 years of ocean acidifica-
tion research at NOAA. This next decade will 
be crucial for further understanding the im-
pacts of ocean acidification on marine eco-
systems and coastal communities. We must 
pass this crucial legislation to help support 
federal efforts to inform mitigation and adapta-
tion strategies. 
Congressman POSEY’s NEAR Act would re-
quire a study by the National Academies of 
Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine. This 
study would examine the impact of ocean 
acidification and other stressors in estuarine 
environments. 
I thank Congresswoman BONAMICI for her 
leadership on this issue and Congressman 
POSEY for his bill. I thank Ranking Member 
LUCAS and our staffs for working together to 
prepare these bills for Floor passage. Finally, 
I thank the numerous experts who helped in-
form the development of both bills. 
I urge my colleagues to swiftly pass these 
two bipartisan bills through the House. I look 
forward to working with the Senate to pass 
strong ocean acidification legislation into law. 
I also want to include in the RECORD several 
letters of support we have received for H.R. 
1447 from outside groups.

OCEAN CONSERVANCY, 
Washington, DC, May 17, 2021. 
Hon. SUZANNE BONAMICI, 
House of Representatives, 
Washington, DC. 
DEAR REPRESENTATIVE BONAMICI: On behalf 
of Ocean Conservancy, I am writing to ex-
press our strong support for H.R. 1447, the 
Coastal and Ocean Acidification Stressors 
and Threats (COAST) Research Act of 2021, 
and to urge your colleagues to vote to pass 
the legislation when it is considered on the 
House Floor. Americans depend on a healthy 
ocean, and ocean acidification threatens mil-
lions of jobs and livelihoods, cultures, and 
ways of life, from the Pacific Northwest’s 
shellfish industry to Florida’s coral reef 
tourism. The COAST Research Act will 
strengthen 
our 
nation’s 
investments 
in 
ocean and coastal acidification, and we en-
courage Members of Congress to stand with 
coastal communities, businesses, and our 
marine environment by passing this impor-
tant legislation. 
From coast to coast, ocean acidification is 
having a broad range of impacts on the 
health of our ocean and coastal commu-
nities. Economically and ecologically impor-
tant regional species are suffering. Ocean 
acidification has attributed to dissolving the 
shells of young Dungeness crab, an economi-
cally valuable fishery in the Pacific North-
west, with additional research suggesting 
that acidification also impacts the crab’s 
ability to navigate their environment. Cor-
als, such as the corals off the coast of Flor-
ida, grow more slowly under acidification 
and are less likely to recover from breakage 
or loss. However, ocean acidification is not 
the only stressor facing our ocean, and the 
combination of impacts can be more detri-
mental to our marine environment. Ocean 
acidification, when combined with increased 
ocean temperatures for example, have shown 
the ability to impact the reproductive suc-
cess of Pacific herring, more than either 
change alone. 
Since the first detrimental impacts of 
ocean acidification in the Pacific Northwest 
in the mid-2000s, when acidification caused 
widespread larval shellfish death in the re-
gion, researchers and coastal industries have 
faced the reality of an increasingly acidic 
ocean head-on. Oregon State University re-
searchers studying Netarts Bay, the initial 
hotspot for documented ocean acidification 
impacts on the Pacific oyster, have uncov-
ered the complex interactions among local 
circulation and biological activity, which is 
now informing local shellfish farmers of 
when to begin particular activities. From 
the Atlantic to the Pacific, ocean and coast-
al acidification has had extensive biological 
and socioeconomic impacts and research is 
accelerating to find ways to offset those 
harms. 
In 2009, Congress recognized the urgent 
need for federal investments in ocean acidifi-
cation research and monitoring, and subse-
quently passed the Federal Ocean Acidifica-
tion Research and Monitoring (FOARAM) 
Act of 2009. FOARAM established the federal 
government’s work on ocean acidification by 
creating the NOAA Ocean Acidification Pro-
gram and an interagency working group on 
ocean acidification. Much of our knowledge 
and understanding of ocean acidification 
that has emerged in the last decade can be 
credited to the federal funding authorized by 
FOARAM. The law’s authorization, however, 
expired in 2012, and there are changes that 
can be made to further improve our ability 
to understand acidification in the open ocean 
as well as in the coastal zone. 
As the ocean continues to absorb carbon 
dioxide and the ocean continues to acidify, 
we must take action to protect our commu-
nities and wildlife from the impacts of acidi-
fication. The COAST Research Act will help 
our nation and coastal communities better 
prepare for the effects from ocean and coast-
al acidification, strengthen investments in 
research and monitoring, increase our under-
standing of the impacts acidification has on 
our communities and bring together ocean 
stakeholders to guide research and moni-
toring. Thank you for your leadership on 
this issue, and we look forward to working 
with you to craft solutions for our changing 
ocean environment.

CONSORTIUM FOR OCEAN LEADERSHIP, 
Washington, DC, May 17, 2021. 
Hon. SUZANNE BONAMICI, 
Washington, DC. 
DEAR CONGRESSWOMAN BONAMICI: On behalf 
of the Consortium for Ocean Leadership 
(COL), which represents our nation’s leading 
ocean science, research, and technology or-
ganizations from academia, industry, and 
the larger nonprofit sector (to include aquar-
iums, philanthropy, and associations), I am 
writing to express support for the Coastal 
and 
Ocean 
Acidification 
Stressors 
and 
Threats (COAST) Research Act of 2021 (H.R. 
1447). COL applauds the COAST Research Act 
in its mission to strengthen existing ocean 
acidification initiatives and to introduce 
new strategies to better understand and 
manage this environmental stressor. 
Ocean acidification, which occurs as the 
ocean absorbs higher concentrations of at-
mospheric carbon dioxide, threatens the 
health of the entire ocean. As corals, shell-
fish, and many types of plankton struggle to 
create 
and 
maintain 
their 
shells 
or 
exoskeletons in more acidic waters, ocean 
food webs are disrupted. This, in turn, 
threatens the crucial balance in many eco-
systems, as well as our own security and 
prosperity, jeopardizing the stability of 
those whose livelihoods depend on a healthy 
ocean. Like many environmental challenges 
of our time, vulnerable communities who 
rely on shellfish and healthy coastal eco-
systems for food, employment, and com-
merce with few alternatives will feel the 
negative impacts of ocean acidification most 
acutely. Combatting the causes and miti-
gating the effects of ocean acidification re-
quires sustained congressional support and 
interagency collaboration, as well as engage-
ment by stakeholders in the private sector, 
academia, 
philanthropy, 
and 
beyond. 
I 
strongly commend the COAST Research 
Act’s commitment to advancing ocean acidi-
fication research and monitoring efforts, as 
well as promoting cooperation among stake-
holder groups. 
I offer my sincere thanks to you, Congress-
woman Bonamici, for your efforts to help us 
better understand this urgent threat and to 
improve overall ocean health by strength-
ening federal investments in the research 
and increasing monitoring of changing ocean 
conditions. Our lives and our future may 
well depend on it.

Re Earthjustice supports the H.R. 1447, the 
Coastal 
and 
Ocean 
Acidification 
Stressors and Threats Research Act of 
2021. 
Hon. SUZANNE BONAMICI, 
House of Representatives, 
Washington, DC. 
DEAR
CONGRESSWOMAN
BONAMICI: Thank 
you for your leadership in addressing one of 
the greatest threats facing our oceans. 
Earthjustice strongly supports the Coastal 
and 
Ocean 
Acidification 
Stressors 
and 
Threats (COAST) Act of 2021 (H.R. 1447). 
Ocean acidification is a growing global phe-
nomenon harming our coastal communities, 
ecosystems, and economies, and this pro-
posed legislation would strengthen our abil-
ity to combat this threat with the urgency 
and resources needed. 
Ocean acidification erodes the very founda-
tions of our ocean ecosystems, as acidic 
waters imperil everything from cod larvae 
and lobsters to plankton and corals. The 
ocean absorbs 30% of the carbon dioxide that 
we release into the atmosphere, and acidifi-
cation from excess carbon sets of a destruc-
tive chain reaction whereby the loss of tiny 
snails imperils species of all sizes that prey 
on them, such as killer whales. We have also 
seen the damage that acidification can 
wreak on coastal economies, such as our Pa-
cific Northwest shellfish farms, We need im-
mediate action to halt plunging pH levels 
and promote resilience in the face of chang-
ing temperatures. 
The 
COAST 
Research 
Act 
jumpstarts 
ocean recovery by updating the Federal 
Ocean Acidification Research and Moni-
toring Act (FOARAM) to address the full 
scope of acidification’s effects. Increasing 
funding for FOARAM and expanding the defi-
nition of ocean acidification ensures our ef-
forts are informed by the best available 
science we have. Incorporating data on the 
socioeconomic and regional impacts of acidi-
fication ensures that our response to the 
problem is both comprehensive and prac-
tical. Establishing an advisory board that 
represents and coordinates the diverse stake-
holders impacted by acidification ensures 
that 
interests 
at 
every 
level—industry, 
recreation, and conservation—are considered 
in federal actions against ocean acidifica-
tion. 
Bipartisan support for the COAST Re-
search Act speaks to the seriousness of the 
problem and the efficiency of this bill’s pro-
posed solutions. Neither Democrats nor Re-
publicans are willing to watch our blue econ-
omy dissolve in increasingly acidic waters. 
Both parties support action to stabilize and 
strengthen our ocean ecosystems. This bill 
provides the funding and the strategy to do 
just that. 
We greatly appreciate your leadership on 
this important issue and implore Congress to 
timely pass it. 
Sincerely, 
DANNY FOLDS, 
Associate Legislative Counsel, Earthjustice.

DEAR
REPRESENTATIVE
BONAMICI: From 
coast to coast, ocean acidification is having 
a broad range of impacts on the health of our 
ocean and coastal communities. Coastal in-
dustries are continuing to face the reality of 
an increasingly acidic ocean. In 2017, re-
searchers at Oregon State University re-
corded some of the highest levels of ocean 
acidification in the world off the coast of the

Pacific Northwest. Additionally, 63% of test 
sites on the west coast experienced levels of 
acidification known to cause commercial 
oyster production failures. 
Our Pacific Northwest economies, our rec-
reational and commercial fishing, and shell-
fish industry as well as our great northwest 
tourism economy—all depend on a healthy 
ocean. And because we are already seeing the 
effects of ocean acidification, we support 
your efforts and we support H.R. 1237, the 
Coastal and Ocean Acidification Stressors 
and Threats (COAST) Research Act. 
Much of our knowledge and understanding 
of ocean acidification that has emerged in 
the last decade can be credited to the federal 
funding authorized by Federal Ocean Acidifi-
cation Research and Monitoring (FOARAM) 
Act of 2009. FOARAM established the federal 
government’s work on ocean acidification by 
creating the NOAA Ocean Acidification Pro-
gram and an interagency working group on 
ocean acidification. FOARAM’s authoriza-
tion expired in 2012. The COAST Research 
Act amends FOARAM to further improve our 
ability to understand acidification in the 
open ocean as well as in the coastal zone. 
We support the COAST Research Act and 
believe it will help our coastal communities 
better prepare for the effects from ocean and 
coastal acidification. Thank you for your 
leadership to strengthen the nation’s focus 
and investment in oceans and coastal acidifi-
cation.

IOOS ASSOCIATION, 
May 17, 2021. 
Hon. SUZANNE BONAMICI, 
House of Representatives, 
Washington, DC. 
DEAR CONGRESSWOMAN BONAMICI: On behalf 
of the Integrated Ocean Observing System 
(IOOS) Association and its national network 
of eleven coastal observing systems, I write 
to support the Coastal and Ocean Acidifica-
tion Stressors and Threats (COAST) Re-
search Act. 
NOAA’s Integrated Ocean Observing Sys-
tem (IOOS) links together Federal agencies 
and eleven Regional Associations (RAs) to 
design and to operate regional observing sys-
tems to provide timely and reliable data and 
information on our oceans, coasts, and Great 
Lakes. Coastal acidification is becoming an 
even more pressing concern for many of our 
stakeholders and users, such as shellfish 
growers, shellfish harvesters, fishermen, re-
source managers, and coastal communities. 
The impacts of coastal acidification vary, 
and each system must be tailored to the 
unique situation of the region. The IOOS 
RAs work closely with NOAA’s Ocean Acidi-
fication Program to understand the regional 
context, to deploy and operate sensors, sup-
port the data that can detect and monitor 
acidification to support and improve warn-
ings and alerts and to provide for the sharing 
and integration of data. 
The COAST Research Act will enhance 
these and other efforts to understand, moni-
toring and manage the nation’s ability to re-
spond and adapt to ocean acidification. The 
Act does this be expanding the Advisory 
Board to include representatives of the vari-
ety of industries and stakeholder impacted 
by ocean acidification, expanding the stra-
tegic plan for research and monitoring, and 
expanding the role of the Federal agencies 
for addressing ocean acidification. 
Sincerely, 
ELLA (JOSIE) QUINTRELL, 
Director.

IN HONOR OF THE LIFE AND EX-
EMPLARY SERVICE OF PASTOR 
E. BAXTER MORRIS 
HON. TERRI A. SEWELL 
OF ALABAMA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, May 17, 2021 
Ms. SEWELL. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to honor the life and exemplary service of 
Pastor Edgar Baxter Morris, the beloved sen-
ior pastor of the historic First Baptist Church 
on North Ripley Street in Montgomery, Ala-
bama who passed away on Sunday, May 2, 
2021 surrounded by family. Pastor E. Baxter 
Morris was a devoted community leader and 
former Montgomery Police Department chap-
lain. He served for 50 years as the pastor of 
the iconic First Baptist Church, which was 
once pastored by Rev. Ralph Abernathy, a 
key strategist and architect of the Civil Rights 
Movement and Montgomery Bus Boycott. 
Pastor Morris was born the second of two 
children to Mr. and Mrs. Willie and Ella Bea-
trice Morris in Anniston, Alabama. He studied 
at Jacksonville State University, Selma Univer-
sity, and Alabama State University. He contin-
ued his education at the National Baptist Con-
gress of Christian Education and Samford Uni-
versity Extension Division. Later, Pastor Morris 
returned to the National Baptist Congress of 
Christian Education and the State Congress to 
serve as both an instructor and lecturer. 
Pastor 
Morris 
was 
called 
to 
ministry 
on’August 20, 1972. As a faithful public serv-
ant to his community, Pastor Morris served as 
Chaplain for Montgomery Police Department 
for over 20 years and as a mentor for Mont-
gomery police officers and their families. As 
the senior pastor of First Baptist Church in 
Montgomery, Alabama for almost 50 years, 
Pastor Morris worked tirelessly to uphold the 
legacy of this historic church by promoting so-
cial justice and equity. Pastor Morris held nu-
merous leadership positions within religious 
and community organizations. He is the past 
moderator of the Montgomery-Antioch of 
Christian Education, lecturer of the State Con-
gress of Christian Education, missionary for 
the Alabama Baptist Southeast District State 
Convention, and lecturer of the Alabama 
Southeast District State Convention Women’s 
Department. 
Known as an active community leader, Pas-
tor Morris dedicated his life to the police offi-
cers of Montgomery and to their families. He 
offered mentorship and support to police offi-
cers and emergency first-responders through-
out his career. He served on various boards in 
Montgomery and the surrounding community 
including the Montgomery Area Mental Health 
Authority. Pastor Morris was also a member of 
the Fraternal Order and Masonic, Phi Beta 
Kappa, Phi Beta Sigma Fraternity, Inc., and 
the Inspector General 33° United Supreme 
Council A.A.S.R. of Freemasonry, S.J., Inc. 
Prince Hall. 
Pastor Morris is survived by his loving and 
faithful wife, Rebie Morris, four children, twelve 
grandchildren, one great-grandniece, three 
nephews, one godson, and a host of other rel-
atives and friends including his First Baptist 
Church Family, Ministerial Circle, Sigma Broth-
ers, Zeta Sisters, and Masonic Family. 
On a personal note, I am eternally grateful 
for the tremendous community contributions 
made by Pastor Morris and the dedicated con-
gregation of First Baptist Church. Under the 
leadership of Pastor Morris, First Baptist 
Church opens its doors to thousands of trav-
elers from across the world who want to learn 
more about the role this church played during 
the Civil Rights Movement. Pastor Morris re-
mained committed to preserving and furthering 
the legacy of activism at First Baptist Church 
fostered by his predecessor Rev. Ralph Aber-
nathy. I am especially appreciative of the 
warm and generous hospitality shown by Pas-
tor Morris and the entire congregation of the 
First Baptist Church. They have served as the 
hosts for Members of Congress during the an-
nual Faith and Politics Civil Rights Pilgrimage 
since 1998. Year after year, the highlight of 
the pilgrimage for many of my colleagues was 
the ‘‘five-star’’ Saturday Brunch hosted by 
Pastor Morris and his congregation. We will 
surely miss his warm smile, congenial person-
ality, infinite wisdom, compassionate heart, 
and generous spirit. May we be comforted in 
knowing that the legacy of service and unwav-
ering faith of Pastor Morris will live on in the 
hearts and actions of those he impacted.

HONORING RUSSELL EUGENE 
GWALTNEY 
HON. H. MORGAN GRIFFITH 
OF VIRGINIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, May 17, 2021 
Mr. GRIFFITH. Madam Speaker, I rise in 
honor of Russell Eugene Gwaltney, who died 
on March 12, 2021 at the age of 81. Russ was 
a local legend in his youth who later served 
his hometown as a career law enforcement of-
ficer who honorably fulfilled his professional 
duties. 
Russ was born in Roanoke, Virginia on Au-
gust 21, 1939, to Charles Wesley Gwaltney 
and Florence Gay Gwaltney Boggess. His fa-
ther passed away before he was born, and his 
mother, a cashier, raised him in Salem. 
His first calling in life was as a marbles 
champion. The game was popular in his 
neighborhood, and his older brother Charlie 
taught him to play at the age of four or five. 
He grew in skill, amassing a collection of mar-
bles he won from other players. Russ lost to 
Charlie in the semifinals of a 1948 tournament 
sponsored by the Salem Recreation Depart-
ment. As he recalled to the Roanoke Times in 
1993, ‘‘When he beat me, he made me want 
to get better.’’ Russ did, winning the town 
championship in 1949 and then the 1952 Na-
tional Championship held in Asbury Park, New 
Jersey. Salem showered its national marbles 
champion with laurels upon his return. Al-
though interest in marbles declined, he stayed 
involved in the game as an adult and helped 
with the national tournament. 
In the following years, Russ graduated from 
Andrew Lewis High School and served in the 
United States Navy. After starting his policing 
career in Newport News, he moved back to 
Salem and began his 34 years with the Salem 
Police Department, which he served as a uni-
formed officer, detective, and member of the 
SWAT Team, rising to the rank of captain. He 
concluded his career as chief of police in Dub-
lin, Virginia. 
Russ is survived by his wife, Rita Woodyard 
Gwaltney; son and daughter-in-law, Rusty and 
Katy 
Gwaltney; 
daughter 
and 
grandson, 
Renee’ Moore and Phoenix Moore; and broth-
ers Charles Thomas Gwaltney and Douglas 
MacArthur Hawkins. I offer them my condo-
lences on the loss of this good man, who 
earned a unique fame in Salem as a boy and 
then returned it with a career of faithful service 
in law enforcement.
