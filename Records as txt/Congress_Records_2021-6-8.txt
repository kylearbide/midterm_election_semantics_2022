Holy God, we live our days because 
You have willed them into being. On 
this new day, open our eyes that we 
would see the gracious gift You have 
laid before us. And as we make our way 
through every day of our lives—from 
the daily routine to the unexpected de-
tours, from the disturbing events to 
the unspeakably joyful ones—do not 
hide Yourself from us. 
May we see Your magnificence in the 
mundane. May we know of Your guid-
ance in our grief. May Your peace give 
us patience when we have none left, 
and may Your love call us to live whol-
ly into the hope of every opportunity 
You set before us. 
Spare us from the circumstances that 
would cause us harm and remind us to 
delight in Your direction. 
We pray this in the certainty of Your 
saving name. 
Amen.

RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY LEADER 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The majority leader is recog-
nized. 
JUDICIAL NOMINATIONS 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, the 
Senate, today, will achieve an impor-
tant milestone for the session. We will 
confirm the first of President Biden’s 
judicial nominees—the first but, cer-
tainly, not the last, not even close. We 
will soon confirm Julien Neals to be a 
judge for the District of New Jersey. 
Afterward, we will turn to the nomina-
tion of Regina Rodriguez to be a judge 
for the District of Colorado. I greatly 
look forward to confirming what will 
be the first of many judicial appoint-
ments during the Biden administra-
tion. 
ENDLESS FRONTIER ACT 
Mr. President, later today, the Sen-
ate will take a final vote on the U.S. 
Innovation and Competition Act, pav-
ing the way for the largest investment 
in science and technology for genera-
tions. 
After 3 months of bipartisan negotia-
tions, after the hard labor of 6 Senate 
committees, and after considering over 
20 amendments from both sides of the 
floor, we should—and we will—pass this 
historic bill today. When all is said and 
done, the bill will go down as one of the 
most important things this Chamber 
has done in a very long time—a state-
ment of faith in America’s ability to 
seize the opportunities of the 21st cen-
tury. 
The ambitions of this legislation are 
large, but the premise is simple: If we 
want American workers and American 
companies to keep leading the world, 
the Federal Government must invest in 
science, basic research, and innovation, 
just as we did in the decades after the 
Second World War. 
Technology firms currently make up 
a quarter—a quarter—of the global 
stock market. Whoever wins the race 
to the technologies of the future is 
going to be the global economic leader, 
with profound consequences for foreign 
policy and national security as well. 
Whoever harnesses the technologies, 
like AI, quantum computing, and inno-
vations yet unseen, will shape the 
world in its image. 
Do we want that image to be a demo-
cratic image, with a small ‘‘d,’’ or do 
we want it to be an authoritarian 
image like President Xi would like to 
impose on the world? 
Either we can cede the mantle of 
global leadership to our adversaries or 
we can pave the way for another gen-
eration of American leadership. That is 
what this bill is all about, and I look

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S3968 
June 8, 2021 
forward to joining my colleagues in fi-
nally passing this bill later today. 
JANUARY 6 
Now, Mr. President, on January 6, 
this morning, the Senate’s Homeland 
Security and Governmental Affairs 
Committee, in partnership with the 
Rules Committee, released a joint re-
port related to the aspects of the trag-
edy of January 6. 
I particularly salute Chairs PETERS 
and KLOBUCHAR for the good work they 
have done with their ranking members. 
The report drew a few notable con-
clusions, especially with respect to the 
failures in intelligence gathering and 
communication that took place on and 
before January 6, but just as glaring as 
what the report didn’t consider is, in-
deed, what it was not allowed to con-
sider. The report did not investigate, 
report on, or hardly make any ref-
erence to the actual cause, the actual 
impetus, for the attack on January 6. 
With the exception of a brief ref-
erence to former President Trump’s re-
marks at the Ellipse, Senate Repub-
licans insisted that the report exclude 
anything having to do with the cause 
of the insurrection. 
If anything, the joint report by the 
Homeland Security and Rules Commit-
tees has strengthened the argument for 
an independent commission on January 
6. 
We had a perfect opportunity to es-
tablish such a Commission at the end 
of 
last 
session 
before 
Republicans 
mounted a partisan filibuster against 
it, despite the fact that the Democrats 
worked with Republicans for weeks in 
the House and Senate to construct a 
Commission that was bipartisan, fo-
cused, straight down the middle; de-
spite the fact that Speaker PELOSI ac-
ceded to every major request made by 
House Republicans about the structure 
of the commission; and despite the fact 
that, here in the Senate, I supported 
the changes proposed by my colleague 
Senator COLLINS. 
As the Big Lie continues to spread, 
as faith in our elections continues to 
decline, it is crucial—crucial—we es-
tablish a trusted, independent record of 
what transpired on January 6 and what 
caused it. 
So I reserve the right to bring legis-
lation for an independent, bipartisan 
Commission to the Senate floor for an-
other vote. 
PAYCHECK FAIRNESS 
Mr. President, now, on paycheck fair-
ness, finally, this week the Senate will 
vote on whether to take up legislation 
that would provide equal pay for 
women in America. 
We have been talking about the wage 
gap for years now, with no action 
taken by the Senate. 
Women with the same jobs, the same 
degrees, sometimes even better degrees 
than their male colleagues, are making 
less money. For women of color, the 
gap between them and their male coun-
terparts is even wider. 
This is a fundamental issue of fair-
ness, and we have a very simple, com-
monsense legislative proposal to ad-
dress the issue. But yesterday, the Re-
publican leader said Democrats’ at-
tempts to bring this issue up for a de-
bate was ‘‘transparently designed to 
fail.’’ He went on to say that issues 
like gun safety and pay equity were 
merely 
‘‘demands 
of 
[our] 
radical 
base.’’ 
Look, the only way that a bill to pro-
vide equal pay for women is designed to 
fail is if Senate Republicans block it. 
And if the Republican leader wants to 
talk about ‘‘radical’’ positions, I would 
say that opposing legislation to pro-
vide equal pay for women, supported by 
a solid majority of voters, is a radical 
position. Does he believe that? 
You know what is radical? Opposing 
legislation 
to 
expand 
background 
checks to prevent felons and the men-
tally ill from getting a gun. More than 
90 percent—90 percent—of Americans 
support that policy. But Republicans 
have, in the past, opposed it. That is 
truly a radical position. 
You know what else is radical? Op-
posing a bipartisan, independent Com-
mission to report on a violent mob that 
attacked this Capitol. Spreading doubt 
about the veracity of our elections. 
That is radical and, in my opinion, des-
picable. It gnaws at the very roots of 
this grand democracy. And we hear ei-
ther encouragement or acquiescence 
from the other side when President 
Trump and his minions do this. 
You know what else is radical? Pass-
ing laws that specifically make it hard-
er for younger, poorer, and non-White 
Americans to vote. That is truly rad-
ical and dangerous. It is against the 
whole grain of progress we have made 
in America. Remembering that when 
the Constitution was passed, the vast 
majority of us in this Chamber, not the 
vast majority but probably the major-
ity—I haven’t counted—would have to 
be White, male, Protestant property 
owners to vote, we have made progress. 
They want to take a giant step back 
for pure electoral gain. Radical. That is 
radical. 
So we are going to have a vote on 
paycheck fairness this week. The first 
vote is not even a vote on the bill; it is 
just a vote on whether to take it up for 
debate. We will see if our Republican 
colleagues take the radical step of 
blocking the Senate from even debat-
ing equal pay for women. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. Without objection, it is so or-
dered. 
RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The Republican leader is recog-
nized. 
ENDLESS FRONTIER ACT 
Mr. 
MCCONNELL. 
Mr. 
President, 
today the Senate will wrap up consid-
eration of a broad bipartisan effort to 
update our approach to competition 
with China. This bill has accelerated 
an important conversation on a topic 
we all know deserves our full atten-
tion. From critical supply chains to in-
tellectual 
property, 
to 
counter-
espionage, it touches on key issues 
that will help determine our strategic 
footing for decades. 
That is why an overwhelming major-
ity of us, myself included, voted to pro-
ceed to the measure here on the floor, 
not because the bill was already per-
fect. In fact, as the ranking member of 
the Commerce Committee noted when 
it was reported out, the legislation was 
‘‘not ready for prime time.’’ 
Rather, we took it up precisely be-
cause it deserved robust debate and 
amendment. So I was glad that several 
of our colleagues were allowed to offer 
substantial revisions here on the floor. 
In particular, I am glad the Democratic 
leader 
thought 
better 
of 
blocking 
Chairman WYDEN and Ranking Member 
CRAPO from including their bipartisan 
provision on combating illicit trade 
practices. 
But I was disappointed that he pro-
ceeded with an effort to end this impor-
tant debate without allowing the Sen-
ate to consider a number of other out-
standing Republican amendments. 
There is no practical reason our con-
sideration of this important issue 
should have to compete for sufficient 
space on the Democrats’ dance card. 
We are talking about making Amer-
ica more competitive with its biggest 
and fastest growing rival. If any issue 
demands thorough, exhaustive debate, 
it is this one. 
Unfortunately, the final bill we will 
be voting on today will remain incom-
plete. It includes several smart, tar-
geted measures but leaves many more 
on the table. And so it will advance as 
an imperfect approach to an extremely 
consequential challenge. 
One thing this legislation did dem-
onstrate extremely well, however, was 
that the rules of the Senate don’t stand 
in the way of bipartisan legislating. 
Needless to say, final passage of this 
legislation cannot be the Senate’s final 
word—final word on our competition 
with China. It certainly won’t be mine. 
As I have warned repeatedly, soft 
power is only as strong as the hard 
power underpinning it. 
The 
Chinese 
Communist 
Party 
doesn’t hesitate in investing the pro-
ceeds of its predatory trade practices 
and influence campaigns directly into 
modernizing its hard power arsenal. 
Over the past two decades, defense 
spending in Beijing has increased as-
tronomically. Meanwhile, the Biden 
administration’s proposal for defense 
spending puts forward such a meager— 
meager—year-on-year increase, it fails 
to keep pace with inflation, let alone 
with our rivals. 
The White House request would de-
grade our ability to project power

quickly out in the Western Pacific. It 
would cannibalize Pacific Deterrence 
Initiative funds intended to build infra-
structure and enhance interoperability 
with our partners in the region just to 
cover shortfalls elsewhere in the budg-
et. And it would cut procurement of 
critical munitions that are already in 
short supply. 
The administration is playing a dan-
gerous shell game, and the political 
consequences aren’t lost on either side 
of the Pacific. 
The 
perception 
that 
the 
United 
States might be any less than fully 
committed to prevailing in great power 
competition has left China emboldened 
and our friends in the region quite wor-
ried. 
Here at home, the Chairman of the 
Joint Chiefs sounded the alarm, warn-
ing that great power peace was ‘‘fray-
ing at the edge.’’ 
Preserving that peace will require 
more than the action we will take 
today. It will require this administra-
tion to get serious about funding our 
national defense. It will require major 
investment in the sorts of cutting-edge 
capabilities that deter those who in-
tend harm on America and our allies. 
So in the coming weeks, we will see 
whether Democrats’ talk about re-
building alliances has any substance to 
it. In the annual Defense authorization 
and the appropriations process, the 
Senate will embrace this essential de-
bate about restoring America’s hard 
power head-on. This is a pivotal mo-
ment, not a time for half measures on 
America’s national security. 
JANUARY 6 
Mr. President, now on another mat-
ter, today, the Homeland Security and 
Rules Committees released the conclu-
sions of their monthslong investigation 
into the circumstances of the unprece-
dented breach of security here at the 
Capitol on January 6. 
I am grateful to our colleagues on 
both committees whose hard work 
made this invaluable report possible. 
My assessment of the terrible events 
of the 6th has been consistent from the 
beginning. I have condemned the per-
petrators, as well as those who enabled 
and encouraged them, and I have given 
full-throated support to our colleagues’ 
bipartisan inquiry, along with the 
work of Federal investigators and pros-
ecutors, to ensure that every criminal 
participant faces justice. 
The Rules and Homeland Security re-
port identifies a number of serious 
shortcomings in Capitol security that 
were exposed and exploited on the 6th. 
It directs our attention to the most 
glaring gaps that could leave the com-
plex vulnerable to future incidents. 
Through the efforts of the Capitol 
Police, the Senate Sergeant At Arms, 
and other institutional partners, the 
Senate’s work to close these gaps is al-
ready well underway. The committee’s 
inquiry into January 6 is ongoing, and 
the nationwide search for a new Chief 
of 
the 
Capitol 
Police 
is 
making 
progress. Our colleagues’ latest find-
ings should guide the entire institu-
tion’s ongoing security reviews. 
Today’s report is one of the many 
reasons I am confident in the ability of 
existing investigations to uncover all 
actionable facts about the events of 
January 6. I will continue to support 
these efforts over any that seek to po-
liticize the process, and I would urge 
my colleagues to do the same. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. Without objection, it is so or-
dered. 
The majority whip is recognized. 
JUDICIAL NOMINATIONS 
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, one of 
the major responsibilities of the Sen-
ate Judiciary Committee, which I 
chair, is the selection of judges to serve 
our Nation. It is important not only 
because it is a question of measuring 
their standards of integrity, honesty, 
and judgment but also because these 
are lifetime appointments. Literally, 
the women and men who are chosen for 
these slots will have an impact on the 
future of America in their courts which 
could last for many years and decades. 
That is why we are careful with the 
Biden administration to not only bring 
good nominees before the Committee 
but to make certain they bring the 
necessary qualities. 
This week, the Senate will consider 
several of President Biden’s judicial 
nominees. I believe they understand 
the role of a judge in our system. They 
will bring much needed experiential 
and demographic diversity to our Na-
tion’s courts. 
I have tried throughout my career, 
and many others like me have tried, to 
choose men and women for the bench 
who will reflect the diversity of Amer-
ica. The face of justice is often as im-
portant as the fact of justice, and if 
people appearing before our courts feel 
that there is at least a chance for suc-
cess based on the background and expe-
rience of a judge, I think it is a posi-
tive thing. 
Given the background of these judges 
in trying cases, arguing appeals, and 
issuing rulings from the bench, I be-
lieve, and the committee agreed, that 
these judicial nominees are ready for 
service. 
Today, I would like to speak in sup-
port of two of them: Julien Neals, nom-
inated to the District Court of New 
Jersey, and Regina Rodriguez, nomi-
nated to the District Court of Colo-
rado. 
New Jersey is really in desperate 
need of Federal judges. They are facing 
a judicial emergency. In each of the 
States’ six judicial vacancies, they 
have been designated as a judicial 
emergency status by the Administra-
tive Office of the U.S. Courts. 
Today, we can begin to address this 
judicial emergency by finally con-
firming Julien Neals to the U.S. Dis-
trict Court for the District of New Jer-
sey. He is an extraordinary public serv-
ant. He has served the people of the 
State of New Jersey for decades. As an 
expert in municipal law, he handled 
several legal disputes that were tried 
to verdict, judgment, or final decision, 
including 
multiple—multiple—jury 
trials. He was the chief judge of the 
Newark Municipal Court. He presided 
over 6,000 cases in that capacity. 
He received a unanimous rating of 
‘‘well qualified’’ from the American 
Bar Association. He has the strong sup-
port of his home State Senators, Sen-
ators CORY BOOKER and BOB MENENDEZ. 
He has received broad bipartisan sup-
port in the Judiciary Committee, with 
five Republicans joining all the Demo-
crats in supporting his nomination. 
I urge my colleagues to support him. 
This week, the Senate will also con-
sider the nomination of Regina Rodri-
guez to be a judge in the District Court 
of Colorado. What a life story she 
brings. Ms. Rodriguez is the daughter 
of a Japanese-American mother, whose 
family was interned during World War 
II, and a Mexican-American father who 
was one of the first Hispanic coaches in 
the National Football League. Her fa-
ther’s job as a coach took the family 
across the country. 
Although Ms. Rodriguez was born in 
Colorado, she spent several of her form-
ative years in my home State of Illi-
nois. When she was 17 years old, Ms. 
Rodriguez thought she might want to 
be a lawyer, so she put on her best suit, 
as she says, and knocked on doors in 
Macomb, IL, until she found a lawyer 
who said: ‘‘Come on in. I’ll show you 
the ropes.’’ 
Lucky for us, Ms. Rodriguez held on 
to that passion that first developed 
when she was a teenager. Over the past 
30 years, she has served as a talented 
litigator who has tried 35 cases to ver-
dict. 
She has a range of experience in gov-
ernment and the private sector. In the 
public sector, she served as an assist-
ant U.S. attorney and rose to become 
the first Latina Chief of the Civil Divi-
sion of the U.S. Attorney’s Office for 
the District of Colorado. In private 
practice, she represented a broad array 
of clients, from individuals to Fortune 
500 firms. During her tenure as a liti-
gator, Ms. Rodriguez has demonstrated 
that she understands the importance of 
applying the law to the facts in a fair 
manner. She has represented plaintiffs, 
defendants, government, and those who 
have sued the government. As a woman 
of color, she has risen as a partner in 
several leading law firms—no mean 
feat. 
Ms. Rodriguez has taken out time 
from her demanding schedule to men-
tor young attorneys, just as that law-
yer in Macomb, IL, did for her. 
She has received a unanimous ‘‘well 
qualified’’ rating from the American 
Bar Association, as well as positive

blue slips from both Senators BENNET 
and HICKENLOOPER. Her nomination is 
also supported by the National Asian 
Pacific American Bar Association, the 
Latinas First Foundation, and the Col-
orado Lawyers Committee. 
She has earned support across the 
aisle. On May 20, Ms. Rodriguez was 
voted out of the committee by a vote of 
17 to 5, with the support of six of my 
Republican colleagues. 
When confirmed, she will be the first 
Asian-American judge to serve not 
only in the District of Colorado but in 
the entire Tenth Circuit. Her historic, 
well-deserved confirmation will bring 
our Federal judiciary closer to reflect-
ing the lives and experiences of all 
Americans. I urge my colleagues to 
join me in voting for Ms. Rodriguez’s 
nomination. 
The judicial nominees we are voting 
on this week illustrate something that 
is substantial and profound. They illus-
trate that President Joe Biden is dedi-
cated to appointing legal experts with 
outstanding credentials and a wealth of 
experience. 
During his first several months in of-
fice, President Biden has nominated 
public servants who will bring to the 
bench a variety of professional perspec-
tives and personal experiences. Too 
often, those things have been missing 
in previous nominees. By confirming 
judges who reflect the experience of all 
Americans and who demonstrate fealty 
to the rule of law, we can continue 
building a justice system that works 
for everyone. 
Over the last 4 years, we have seen a 
concerted effort on the Republican side 
to fill vacancies. They broke records, 
in some respects, in the number of 
nominees that they brought before the 
Senate for approval. Some of the 
records are not ones to be proud of, 
from my perspective, and 10 of the 
nominees who were submitted for con-
sideration during the last 4 years be-
fore the Senate Judiciary Committee 
were found unqualified by the Amer-
ican Bar Association. Nevertheless, 
most of them made it to the bench in 
lifetime appointments. 
Many nominees came before us, of 
the Trump administration, who were 
seeking lifetime appointments to be-
come a trial judge and had no personal 
experience in a courtroom. It is hard to 
imagine that anyone would be thrust 
into that situation and expected to per-
form as a professional. Imagine, if you 
will, the parties to those lawsuits, 
many of whom stake their lives and 
reputations on the outcome, to find a 
judge who couldn’t find their way 
through the Code of Civil Procedure if 
they were forced to. That, unfortu-
nately, was the standard that was used. 
As long as these nominees in the past 
had the blessing of the so-called Fed-
eralist Society, that was good enough 
for many of my Republican colleagues. 
Joe Biden is really responding to 
that by suggesting nominees who meet 
much higher standards. I want to work 
with the Biden administration to con-
tinue in that tradition, so at the end of 
the day we can fill the vacancies with 
women and men who are not only com-
petent and honest but have the integ-
rity and experience, both legal and oth-
erwise, to serve our Nation for the rest 
of their lives, should they choose, in 
these judicial capacities. 
I commend these two nominees who 
passed out of our committee with a 
strong bipartisan votes. To my col-
leagues on the floor today, I hope they 
will join me in supporting them. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I ask

Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, let me 
begin by saying that I am grateful to 
Senators KLOBUCHAR, BLUNT, PETERS, 
and PORTMAN and the two Senate com-
mittees that they lead for their bipar-
tisan investigation into the events of 
January 6, and for producing a detailed 
report in a short amount of time. The 
report makes clear that there is more 
work ahead for the committees. More 
importantly, it also highlights the im-
mense bravery of the men and women 
of the U.S. Capitol Police who defended 
the Capitol Complex on January 6. 
In the coming days, after a thorough 
review of the 100-page report, I will dis-
cuss its recommendations with my col-
leagues and work to institute reforms 
that will make a meaningful change to 
better protect the U.S. Capitol. 
BIDEN ADMINISTRATION 
Mr. President, on a different topic, in 
his 1996 State of the Union address, 
then-President Bill Clinton famously 
declared: ‘‘The era of big government is 
over.’’ 
Well, after taking a look at the Biden 
budget, it is clear that the era of Big 
Government is back, and it is bringing 
Big Government’s usual companions: 
big taxation, big spending, big deficits, 
and, it seems likely, big inflation. 
The Biden budget, which the admin-
istration quietly slipped out the door 
before the holiday weekend, would 
raise taxes by $3.6 trillion over 10 
years—3.6 trillion. All told, the Biden 
budget proposes at least 30 separate tax 
increases, ranging from a hike in the 
capital gains tax to a hike in the top 
income tax rate, to a new death tax. 
And it would raise taxes on middle- 
class families by allowing the tax relief 
the Republicans passed in 2017 to ex-
pire. 
Under the Biden budget, in just a few 
short years, working Americans could 
be facing thousands of dollars in higher 
taxes. All these tax hikes, of course, 
are an attempt to pay for the Biden ad-
ministration’s new spending. 
Under the Biden budget, government 
spending would exceed $6 trillion every 
year. To put that in perspective, the 
total—total—Federal budget in 2019 
was $4.4 trillion. An increase to $6 tril-
lion plus per year—$8.2 trillion by 
2031—is a massive, massive hike in Fed-
eral spending. 
Over the course of the Biden budget, 
government 
spending 
would 
equal 
around 25 percent of our gross domestic 
product—far exceeding the average of 
the past five decades for spending, as a 
percentage of our total economic out-
look. 
So what would the consequences of 
all this spending look like? Well, I have 
already mentioned the $3.6 trillion in 
new tax hikes. Another would be the 
deficits, which would exceed $1.3 tril-
lion every year for the next 10 years. 
By 2031, the end of the Biden budget 
window, our debt would be—get ready 
for this—$39 trillion. Our debt would 
equal 117 percent of the U.S. economy— 
again, the highest level in our Nation’s 
history, debt to GDP. 
The interest payments on the debt 
would triple over the next 10 years to 
$914 billion. That is right. By 2031, we 
would be paying nearly $1 trillion a 
year just in interest on the debt. That 
is more money than our Nation will 
spend on Medicare this year. 
So let’s review. The Biden budget 
equals taxes, spending, and debt. And 
here is the real kicker: The Biden 
budget hikes taxes, hikes spending, and 
drives up the debt for pretty much 
nothing. That is right. After an initial 
good year or two, the Biden budget 
projects permanently weak economic 
growth. For a majority of the next 10 
years, economic growth wouldn’t even 
hit 2 percent. 
All that government spending and 
debt isn’t going to result in prosperity. 
It is going to result in permanent eco-
nomic stagnation, and that means per-
manently diminished opportunities for 
American families, fewer jobs, lower 
wages, and weaker career prospects. 
Democrats like to talk as if govern-
ment can provide security and salva-
tion. But the truth is, government is 
not an engine of prosperity. Govern-
ment might serve as a safety net in dif-
ficult circumstances, but government 
will never make you prosperous. It is a 
robust economy, not a robust govern-
ment, that would produce prosperity, 
that would produce the good jobs and 
good salaries and good benefits and 
good careers. 
That is why one of the most impor-
tant jobs of government is creating the 
conditions that will allow the economy 
to flourish. That is what Republicans 
worked to do with the tax relief that 
we passed in 2017. And, as we saw before 
the pandemic hit, it was working. 
The Biden budget, on the other hand, 
focuses on creating a flourishing gov-
ernment, and the economy would pay 
the price. And working Americans 
would face a future of diminished earn-
ings and reduced opportunity. 
There is a lot more that could be said 
about the Biden budget. I haven’t even 
mentioned the diminished investment

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S3971 
June 8, 2021 
in our national defense, which could 
have very serious consequences for our 
national security. 
Less than 3 years ago, the bipartisan 
National Defense Strategy Commission 
released a report warning—warning— 
that our readiness had eroded to the 
point where we might struggle to win 
the war against a major power like 
Russia or China. And while we have 
made some real progress since then, we 
still have a lot of work to do to ensure 
that our military is prepared to defend 
our Nation and meet the threats of the 
21st century. The Biden budget would 
send us right back to the situation that 
we faced 3 years ago. 
I guess it is not surprising that a 
budget that fails to be serious about 
fiscal realities would fail to be serious 
about national security realities, but it 
is deeply concerning that the President 
doesn’t seem to understand the impor-
tance of investing in our national de-
fense. 
President Biden has made the prior-
ities of liberal interest groups the top 
priorities 
for 
his 
administration— 
whether that is canceling the Keystone 
XL’s good-paying jobs and economic 
growth to please the environmental 
left or overturning the Mexico City 
policy so that taxpayer dollars can go 
to fund abortions overseas. 
On the question of abortion, Presi-
dent Biden’s budget abandons decades 
of bipartisan compromise and elimi-
nates the Hyde amendment, which pro-
tects taxpayers from having their tax 
dollars used to fund abortions here at 
home. You would think that if we can’t 
agree that the human rights of unborn 
children should be protected, we should 
at 
least 
agree 
that 
a 
taxpayer 
shouldn’t be forced to pay for the kill-
ing of unborn children. 
Almost 60 percent of Americans op-
pose using taxpayer dollars to pay for 
abortions, but President Biden has 
made it clear that his allegiance to the 
radical abortion left trumps the opin-
ions of the American people. So his 
budget eliminates the Hyde amend-
ment and imposes a number of other 
pro-abortion measures, like additional 
government funding access for the Na-
tion’s 
largest 
abortion 
provider, 
Planned Parenthood. 
The Biden budget might be good news 
for liberal interest groups, but it is bad 
news for the American people and bad 
news for our country. I hope that my 
Democratic colleagues will think twice 
before forcing this massive government 
expansion onto the American people. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. BENNET. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
PADILLA). Without objection, it is so 
ordered. 
Mr. BENNET. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent to complete my re-
marks. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
Also 
without objection, it is so ordered. 
NOMINATION OF REGINA M. RODRIGUEZ 
Mr. BENNET. Mr. President, I want-
ed to come to the floor today to share 
a few words about Regina Rodriguez, 
President Biden’s nominee for the U.S. 
District Court for the District of Colo-
rado. Gina’s nomination comes to this 
floor with broad, well-earned support 
across the State of Colorado. My office 
has received a flood of letters on her 
behalf. All of them testify to her char-
acter, her hard work, and her commit-
ment to service, justice, and the rule of 
law. 
She learned all of it from her family. 
Her mom’s family knew injustice first-
hand. During the Second World War, 
they were relocated from California to 
the Heart Mountain internment site in 
Wyoming, joining over 10,000 people 
whose loyalty was questioned by the 
U.S. Government based solely on their 
Japanese ancestry. 
Her mother Linda went on to become 
a teacher and administrator in the 
Denver public schools, my old school 
district. Her father Peter was a Mexi-
can American who went from living in 
a railroad boxcar on the South Side of 
Chicago to earning a nomination for 
the NFL Hall of Fame. 
Education and hard work trans-
formed her parents’ lives, and Regina 
has always sought to live up to their 
example. Gina grew up in Gunnison, 
CO, but her family moved around the 
country because her dad coached foot-
ball. She graduated with honors from 
the University of Iowa, which I know is 
not the only reason Chairman GRASS-
LEY
supported her nomination but 
probably was an important one, and 
then returned home to earn a J.D. from 
the University of Colorado Law School. 
After starting at a private firm in 
Denver, Gina joined the U.S. Attor-
ney’s Office. The Department of Jus-
tice noticed her talent, and she went to 
work for the Attorney General on al-
ternative dispute resolution—a new ap-
proach at the time meant to avoid 
lengthy trials through arbitration and 
mediation. She helped to mainstream 
the approach for all U.S. attorneys, 
saving the government countless hours 
and taxpayers’ countless dollars over 
the years. 
Gina’s 
leadership 
in 
Washington 
earned her a promotion back in Den-
ver, where she rose to become Chief of 
the Civil Division in the U.S. Attor-
ney’s Office. She was the first Latina 
to hold that position and quickly de-
veloped a stellar reputation among col-
leagues and judges. 
Today, she is one of the most re-
spected trial lawyers in Colorado and 
has received reward after reward for 
her work. 
Her commitment to the community 
has been just as impressive. She is a 
founding board member of Colorado 
Youth at Risk, a nonprofit that helps 
kids stay on the right track. She 
served as one of Colorado’s higher edu-
cation commissioners and still serves 
on the board of Denver’s highest per-
forming charter school, the School of 
Science and Technology in my old dis-
trict. Somehow, she finds time to men-
tor young lawyers from underrep-
resented communities. 
The evidence is overwhelming: Re-
gina Rodriguez is an exceptional nomi-
nee with a distinguished career and 
commitment to service. She has blazed 
trails in Colorado and in Colorado law 
through the sheer force of her intellect, 
hard work, and character. Regina and 
her family are what we mean when we 
come to this floor and talk about the 
American dream. 
She has my full and enthusiastic sup-
port, and I want to thank my col-
leagues on the Judiciary Committee 
for advancing her nomination with 
overwhelming, 
bipartisan 
support. 
They 
saw 
what 
Colorado 
already 
knows, which is what an exceptional 
judge Gina would make, and I whole-
heartedly agree. I urge my colleagues 
to come together and confirm this out-
standing nominee in a big bipartisan 
vote. 
With that, I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to 
call the roll. 
Ms. SMITH. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
Under the previous order, the ques-
tion is, Will the Senate advise and con-
sent to the Neals nomination? 
Mr. CRAPO. I ask for the yeas and 
nays. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a 
sufficient second? 
There appears to be a sufficient sec-
ond.

HELPING AMERICAN VICTIMS AFFLICTED BY 
NEUROLOGICAL ATTACKS ACT 
Ms. COLLINS. Madam President, I 
rise today to applaud the swift, unani-
mous Senate passage last night of the 
Helping American Victims Afflicted by 
Neurological Attacks Act, or the HA-
VANA Act. This bill will provide much 
needed assistance to the employees of 
the Intelligence Community, the State 
Department, and other Federal Agen-
cies who have suffered from often de-
bilitating brain injuries at the hands of 
our foreign adversaries. Too often, 
these injured public servants have had 
to battle the bureaucracy to receive 
the medical care they desperately re-
quire. 
I am very pleased today to be joined 
on the Senate floor by the Chairman of 
the Senate Intelligence Committee, 
Senator WARNER. He has been relent-
less in his pursuit of care for these in-
jured public servants who risk their 
lives for us, who serve in difficult and 
dangerous environments. Senator WAR-
NER and the vice chairman of the Sen-
ate Intelligence Committee, Senator 
RUBIO, and Senator SHAHEEN of New 
Hampshire worked with me to draft the 
bill 
that 
the 
Senate 
unanimously 
cleared last night. 
We are very pleased that the fol-
lowing Senators cosponsored our legis-
lation: 
Senators 
CORNYN, 
BENNET, 
BURR, GILLIBRAND, BLUNT, HEINRICH, 
SASSE, FEINSTEIN, COTTON, KING, RISCH, 
DURBIN, 
SCOTT, 
MENENDEZ, 
BLUMENTHAL, and HASSAN. I mentioned 
those cosponsors to show the breadth 
of concern in the Senate about these 
injured employees. 
For several years, American per-
sonnel serving our country in Cuba, 
China, and elsewhere have experienced 
unexplained, serious medical harm, in-
cluding, in some cases, permanent 
brain injuries. Their conditions are be-
lieved to be the consequence of a mys-
terious, directed energy weapon used 
by an adversary. 
As we investigate the source of pre-
vious attacks and seek to prevent fu-
ture ones, the bill that passed the Sen-
ate last night would provide additional 
medical care and financial compensa-
tion to Americans who continue to ex-
perience debilitating symptoms as a re-
sult of these heinous attacks. 
The injuries that many of these vic-
tims have endured are significant and 
life-altering. I have talked with many 
of these victims. They have described 
debilitating headaches, a loss of vision, 
a decreased ability to hear, dizziness, 
and many other symptoms as well, in-
cluding a decline in their cognitive 
abilities. In some cases, they have been 
forced to medically retire. In other 
cases, they somehow continue on while 
coping with these symptoms. 
I have spoken several times to CIA 
Director Burns and the Director of Na-
tional Intelligence, Haines, about these 
attacks, and I am heartened by the 
commitments that they have made to 
me and to other members of the Senate 
Intelligence Committee to care for the 
victims and to identify the perpetra-
tors and the weapon used in these at-
tacks. 
We can speculate. We have our sus-
picions. But the fact is, we do not know 
exactly what the weapon is nor who is 
wielding it. We need a whole-of-govern-
ment approach to identify the adver-
sary who is targeting our American 
personnel, and I am grateful to the 
chairman and vice chair of the Senate 
Intelligence Committee, who I know 
are committed to getting to the bot-
tom of these attacks. 
I hope, when President Biden meets 
with President Putin, that he will ask 
President Putin about these attacks, 
that he will grill him about them to 
see if the Russians are responsible. At 
this point, we don’t know. 
The public servants who work in our 
embassies 
and 
consulates 
overseas 
make many personal sacrifices to rep-
resent America’s interests. They de-
serve our unwavering support when 
they are harmed in the line of duty, 
just as we care for soldiers who are in-
jured on the battlefield. Last night, we 
took an important step in that direc-
tion. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Virginia. 
Mr. WARNER. Madam President, I 
rise today to echo what my good friend

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S3973 
June 8, 2021 
and colleague, Senator COLLINS, has al-
ready said. Let me be clear. She point-
ed out the virtual unanimous support 
this legislation has from members of 
the 
Intelligence 
Committee—both 
sides. Let there be no mistake in terms 
of who was the relentless driver—some 
might even say ‘‘persistent-beyond-be-
lief driver’’ of this issue. It was SUSAN 
COLLINS, and, once again, her service 
shows that she is standing up for Amer-
ica’s diplomats and the intel commu-
nity serving our country around the 
world who, as Senator COLLINS already 
indicated, have been involved in dan-
gerous incidents resulting in brain 
trauma and other unexplained ill-
nesses. We have called it the Havana 
syndrome. 
The remarkable thing is that for 
nearly 5 years, we have been aware of 
these reports, and we have seen, as the 
Senator mentioned, attacks on U.S. 
personnel in Cuba, in China, and 
around the world. We have these re-
ports here in this country, and rather 
than disappearing or going down in 
number, they actually appear to be in-
creasing. 
Five years after the start of this ef-
fort, we don’t know what happened, we 
don’t know who did it, and we don’t 
know what kind of device was used. 
This is wrong. Particularly, I want to 
point out—this is an area where, again, 
we were in bipartisan agreement—that 
under the last administration, we just 
didn’t treat these victims from the 
intel community, the State Depart-
ment, and DOD with the seriousness 
they deserved. 
As chairman of the Senate Intel-
ligence Committee, I know the hard-
ships, sacrifices, and risks our intel-
ligence officers, diplomats, and other 
personnel serving overseas endure— 
often anonymously, often without rec-
ognition. 
The fact that some of these brave 
women and men have been subjected to 
these serious health issues by unknown 
attackers is unacceptable. That their 
own government did not believe them 
when they were injured or denied them 
proper medical attention and care is 
beyond the pale. These are folks who 
were injured while serving our govern-
ment and, in some cases, facing life-
long health consequences, and, for a 
while, we just got blown off. It is inex-
cusable that they were treated this 
way, and it is outrageous that we still 
don’t know who did it or what tool was 
used in these attacks. 
Their country, after their service, 
needs to have their backs. With Sen-
ator COLLINS’s legislation—now that it 
has passed the Senate, and our hope is 
that it will soon pass the House—we 
will show that the country will have 
their backs. 
I also want to give credit to the new 
CIA Director, Ambassador Burns, for 
making this a top priority. On the Sen-
ate Intelligence Committee, there is 
complete bipartisan unanimity on this 
issue. We are going to ensure that the 
United States gets to the bottom of 
this, identifies those responsible for 
those attacks on American personnel, 
holds them accountable, and ensures 
that these attacks on American per-
sonnel stop once and for all. 
Let me echo what Senator COLLINS 
said. This should be one in an ever 
growing list of topics that President 
Biden ought to raise with President 
Putin. 
We must protect our people around 
the globe. At the same time, it is more 
important than ever that the United 
States also provides those affected by 
these attacks with the medical and fi-
nancial support they deserve. Again, 
that is why Senator COLLINS’ legisla-
tion, the HAVANA Act, is so impor-
tant. 
Let me echo again what Senator COL-
LINS said. My partner in this, as well, 
has been Vice Chairman RUBIO, and our 
good friend Senator SHAHEEN. The fact 
that this passed this quickly, unani-
mously, is extraordinarily important, 
but it is just the first step in having 
the backs of our diplomats, our intel 
personnel, our DOD, and, for that mat-
ter, anyone who has been a victim of 
this kind of activity. Again, I want to 
thank Senator COLLINS for her leader-
ship on this issue. I can assure you, as 
Senator COLLINS
said and Senator 
RUBIO and I have repeated a number of 
number of times, the Intelligence Com-
mittee of the Senate is going to get to 
the bottom of this. We are going to 
make sure—and we have taken a giant 
step on this by passing this legisla-
tion—that the personnel will get the 
medical and, if necessary, financial as-
sistance they need; that we are going 
to find out who did it, we are going to 
find out what type of device, and we 
are going to hold them accountable. 
With that, I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-

SEMICONDUCTORS 
Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, as 
we all know, in recent years, China has 
emerged as one of the greatest com-
petitors to the world order. Unfortu-
nately, they don’t play by the same 
rules that the rest of the international 
community plays by. The Chinese Com-
munist Party is increasingly aggres-
sive and well-resourced and has made 
no secret of its intent to gain more in-
fluence and power. 
For everything from national secu-
rity to economic policy, there is a clear 
and urgent need to reorient the way 
our country views and responds to the 
challenge from China. I am glad the 
Senate is taking up an important step 
today through the U.S. Innovation and 
Competition Act. The cornerstone of 
this legislation, of course, is funding to 
bolster domestic semiconductor manu-
facturing so the United States can 
compete with China and secure some of 
our most critical supply chains. 
Nearly 90 percent of the semiconduc-
tors made in the world are made by 
countries in Asia, with Taiwan domi-
nating the market with about 63 per-
cent of that total of 90 percent. In fact, 
one company, Taiwan Semiconductor 
Manufacturing Company, accounted for 
more than half of the total foundry 
revenues last year. As I said, compa-
nies in Taiwan control 63 percent of the 
advanced semiconductor markets. 
If for any reason that supply chain 
was cut off, it would lead to very seri-
ous consequences across our entire 
economy. To address this, Senator 
WARNER, the senior Senator from Vir-
ginia, and I introduced the CHIPS for 
America Act last year to shore up do-
mestic semiconductor manufacturing 
and reduce our alliance on other coun-
tries for one of our most critical prod-
ucts. Semiconductors go into every-
thing with an off and on switch. 
The United States is not the only 
country that spotted this blinking red 
light, this danger signal. Other coun-
tries have recognized the immense 
risks that exist, and they are also 
pouring billions of dollars into new 
foundries. The European Union, for ex-
ample, is investing up to $35 billion, 
South Korea is investing $65 billion, 
and China is investing a whopping $150 
billion 
in 
semiconductor 
manufac-
turing. Our competitors are pouring 
tens of billions of dollars into boosting 
their own supplies of these essential 
semiconductors, and the United States 
needs to keep up and compete. 
The vast majority of our colleagues 
agree that this was an important and 
critical task. It was carefully crafted 
in monthslong, bipartisan, bicameral 
negotiations, and, in fact, this legisla-
tion was adopted as an amendment to 
last year’s Defense Authorization Act 
by a vote of 96 to 4. Now, though, it 
falls to us to fund what we authorized 
in the Defense authorization bill, and 
there is just one issue standing in the 
way. 
During committee consideration of 
the Endless Frontier Act, an amend-
ment was adopted that would apply 
controversial 
and 
unnecessary 
pre-
vailing wage language to the CHIPS for 
America Act. The prevailing wage pro-
vision creates an obstacle to our fund-
ing the CHIPS for America Act, and it 
confers zero benefit on anybody be-
cause 
the 
manufacturing 
of 
semi-
conductors is a very sophisticated, 
well-paying business. 
Considering the current wages of U.S. 
semiconductor manufacturing compa-
nies, there is zero impact on workers’ 
wages by requiring companies to pay 
an elevated, so-called prevailing wage. 
So it is really a nonissue. However, 
these Davis-Bacon provisions also rep-
resent an unprecedented expansion of a 
partisan labor policy, and applying 
them to private construction projects, 
as I said, sets a troublesome precedent. 
Leaving this language in the bill has 
the potential to dramatically weaken 
support for this essential broader legis-
lation, and I hope we can all agree that 
the stakes are simply too high to let 
that happen. I have introduced an 
amendment to strike this unnecessary 
and divisive provision and to maintain 
the strong bipartisan support that the

CHIPS for America Act has earned so 
far. This partisan provision has no im-
pact on workers’ wages, and it should 
hardly be a reason to forfeit the strong 
bipartisan support the CHIPS Program 
has previously received. 
It is important that we send a clear 
and distinct and unequivocal message 
to our competitors and rivals in China. 
Republicans 
and 
Democrats 
have 
worked together to bolster domestic 
semiconductor manufacturing and to 
confront one of our biggest looming 
threats from China. Now is not the 
time to sacrifice the progress we made. 
I encourage our colleagues on both 
sides of the aisle to support this 
amendment so we can maintain the 
strong bipartisan support for this es-
sential program. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Iowa. 
CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, 
in January of 2020, when reports began 
to circulate about the coronavirus, I 
instructed my oversight and investiga-
tions staff to get a classified briefing 
from the Department of Health and 
Human Services’ Office of National Se-
curity. Around that same time, I pub-
licly said that there were signs that 
the virus could develop into a world-
wide threat. I also noted at that time 
my concern that China may not be ac-
curately reflecting the scale or scope of 
the problem and that China was failing 
to 
share 
information 
with 
global 
health organizations. Unfortunately, 
my concerns proved to be true. 
From the beginning, my goal has 
been to ensure a robust Federal re-
sponse to the threat and to better un-
derstand the origins of the virus. 
Today, as we emerge from the pan-
demic, the focus has rightly shifted to 
understanding how the virus origi-
nated. We lost over 500,000 of our fellow 
Americans, and this body has spent 
trillions of dollars to support the U.S. 
economy during the pandemic. 
We the people have an absolute right 
to know everything that the U.S. Gov-
ernment knows about the origins of the 
coronavirus. On March 8, 2021, I wrote 
to the Director of National Intelligence 
and 
the 
Secretary 
of 
Health 
and 
Human Services requesting all intel-
ligence, among other requests, relating 
to what the government knows about 
the origin of the coronavirus. I re-
ceived some intelligence product, and 
that product causes very serious con-
cern and further supports my belief 
that the ongoing review of its origin 
can’t leave any stone unturned. The ef-
fort must be a whole-of-government ap-
proach. 
In response to my letter, the Na-
tional Institutes of Health, an Agency 
within the Department of Health and 
Human Services, stated that it hasn’t 
funded gain-of-function research on the 
coronavirus. Recent reports have cast 
doubts on that position. 
Dr. Fauci’s unit provided $3.4 million 
in taxpayer grants to a research orga-
nization called EcoHealth Alliance. 
That group then issued subgrants to 
the Wuhan Institute of Virology. It has 
been reported that from this $3.4 mil-
lion, somewhere between $600,000 and 
$826,000 was sent to the Wuhan Insti-
tute of Virology. That money, by the 
way, is U.S. taxpayer money. It was 
spent on researching bat coronaviruses. 
As the Wall Street Journal noted last 
week, it is likely that the Wuhan Insti-
tute of Virology was doing gain-of- 
function research. If true, that re-
search could have strengthened the 
virus to the version that caused the 
global pandemic. 
Dr. Fauci has said that Chinese sci-
entists are trustworthy, that ‘‘we gen-
erally always trust the grantee to do 
what they say,’’ and that ‘‘I can’t guar-
antee that a grantee hasn’t lied to us 
because you never know.’’ He also said, 
‘‘I can’t guarantee everything that is 
going on in the Wuhan lab, we can’t do 
that.’’ What complete nonsense and a 
mess that it is. 
Well, Dr. Fauci, why can’t you know 
what is going on inside the Wuhan 
plant if you are going to send tax-
payers’ money to do it? For crying out 
loud, be aggressive and be accountable. 
We know the Chinese Government 
can’t be trusted. We know the Chinese 
Government is involved in risky and 
deadly viral research. We know that 
sending money to any entity affiliated 
with the Chinese Government is a 
risky proposition, which is why any 
sign of any taxpayer money sent to the 
Chinese Government should be subject 
to the most rigorous and comprehen-
sive oversight. 
If Dr. Fauci and his team know that 
taxpayer money is going to the Chinese 
Government, what steps did he and 
they take to oversee how that money 
was used? Well, that question is ex-
actly what I asked in my March 8, 2021, 
letter to the Department of Health and 
Human Services. HHS failed to answer 
what, if any, oversight was done. 
In my followup letter to the Depart-
ment of Health and Human Services on 
May 26 of this year, I stated the fol-
lowing: 
Your letter failed to describe the steps the 
Department of Health and Human Services 
took to oversee the research done at the 
Wuhan Institute of Virology in light of it 
being funded by the taxpayer. 
The taxpayers expect the Federal 
Government to, at a minimum, know 
what their money is buying. 
Congress expects the Federal Govern-
ment to perform aggressive oversight, 
especially when the funded research in-
volves highly infectious and deadly vi-
ruses. Furthermore, if no oversight 
were performed, then that would call 
into question the government’s con-
fidence that no gain-of-function re-
search was supported by taxpayers’ 
dollars, because that is what I was told 
by the HHS. 
The people have a right to know 
what the government knows about the 
origins of the coronavirus. The people 
have a right to know if Dr. Fauci and 
other government officials were dere-
lict in their duty to conduct oversight 
of the money that they knew would 
end up with the Communist Chinese 
Government. 
Dr. Fauci is constantly going on tele-
vision to talk about anything that he 
wants to talk about. He should start 
talking about what, if any, oversight 
he did with respect to the taxpayers’ 
money that he knew was going to the 
Communist Chinese Government. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The

OFFICER. 
The

The senior assistant legislative clerk

ENDLESS FRONTIER ACT 
Ms. CANTWELL. Madam President, I 
come to the floor, hopefully today will 
be the day we wrap up debate on the 
America 
Competes-Endless 
Frontier 
legislation now known as the USICA, 
United States Innovation and Competi-
tion Act of 2021. We come to talk about 
this now, primarily because we know 
that the research dollars invested 
today are going to decide the jobs of 
the future. And we know that we all be-
lieve a significant increase in the in-
vestment in research and development 
dollars will help us spur innovation, 
continue to help us compete, and con-
tinue to be competitive in key sectors 
of our economy that are so important 
to us. 
We know that we have been having 
this debate literally now for more than 
a 
decade, 
starting 
with 
President 
Bush’s 2006 report saying America 
needed to invest more in the National 
Science Foundation. And at the time, I 
am pretty sure we thought we were in 
a track meet where our competitor was 
maybe half a lap behind us. 
I am pretty sure now, as the decade 
has moved on, we are looking over our 
shoulder and realizing that the com-
petition is gaining. So we need to make 
this investment in research and devel-
opment to stay competitive, to grow 
jobs for tomorrow, and solve some of 
our most pressing problems, whether 
that is climate change, national secu-
rity on cyber issues, or the advent and 
usage of artificial intelligence and 
what that will mean both for our op-
portunities and for our challenges. 
So we are making a renewed commit-
ment to the National Science Founda-
tion. I thank my colleagues again, Sen-
ator SCHUMER and Senator YOUNG, for

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S3975 
June 8, 2021 
their innovative legislation. They are 
telling us a couple of things. They are 
saying, one, invest more money in re-
search and development, so this bill 
not only increases the NSF budget, it 
increases DOE’s budget and increases 
the Defense Advanced Research Pro-
gram Agency’s funding as well by $17.5 
billion. 
So it is saying, yes, basic research is 
still very important. But it is also say-
ing, for the first time, we need to get 
more out of the research that we do, 
and we need to have more translational 
science, that is, taking the basic re-
search and applied research and actu-
ally using the applications of that in a 
more robust way so that we can trans-
late more of that into actual science 
and manufacturing. 
Why is this so important? Because we 
know that our competitiveness as a na-
tion is suffering from the fact that peo-
ple are looking at our own research and 
development. They are looking at our 
teachings and our publishing at univer-
sities and actually going and imple-
menting this. So we need to do better 
on tech transfer. 
This underlying legislation not only 
helps us do that by helping to help uni-
versities who are our No. 1 research 
partner with Federal dollars, it allows 
those universities to help us with more 
tech transfer in innovative ways, that 
universities not just do the research, 
but help commercialize it. It also 
makes investments and helping them 
protect the patenting of that critical 
information, so no longer having that 
patentable information used in other 
places around the globe, but actually 
capitalizing on the jobs here in the 
United States. 
It also makes a huge investment in 
STEM, the science, technology, engi-
neering, and math jobs that we need 
for the future. And clearly, you can’t 
make a major investment in research 
and development if you don’t have the 
workforce to carry it out. And we need 
a workforce to carry it out. So this un-
derlying legislation helps us not only 
diversify our workforce by a major in-
vestment in STEM, going from an an-
nual budget of about $1 billion in the 
year 2020 to about $4 billion a year by 
2026. So we are going to get a more di-
versified STEM workforce with women 
and minorities participating. 
And we are also trying to distribute 
more of our engineering and science ca-
pacity around the United States. Our 
colleagues, 
Senators 
SCHUMER
and 
YOUNG, were adamant that we also 
look at innovation infrastructure hap-
pening in more regional places in the 
United States, where they may not 
currently have the R&D capability of 
some of our major institutions. 
So this legislation promises 20 per-
cent of the research and investment 
dollars go to those EPSCoR states, Es-
tablished Program to Stimulate Com-
petitive Research, an already identified 
landmark in how we distribute re-
search dollars, that tries to grow the 
regional 
research 
infrastructure 
in 
more places in the United States. 
Again, I thank my colleagues Senator 
WICKER for leading the charge on that 
and helping us make that investment. 
And it also triples the Manufacturing 
Extension Partnership Program, so 
that we get more out of manufacturing 
workforce training and resiliency of 
our supply chain for the future. 
As I mentioned before we left, it also 
includes an authorization for NASA 
and the Artemis mission and making 
sure that we are staying competitive. 
As Senator Nelson said in a House 
hearing on our mission and challenges, 
as China has made it clear, they are 
going to Mars, we are going back to the 
Moon to ready ourselves to go to Mars, 
and we think that it, too, deserves the 
funding and support to make us com-
petitive. 
I think the bottom line here is that 
we know that American innovation 
drives the economy of the future. In a 
lot of ways, in passing this legislation 
today—and 
just 
so 
our 
colleagues 
know, we will have a couple of votes 
here before we get to a final passage— 
we really are doing our part. 
People hopefully will support this 
legislation enthusiastically, well past 
the majority of Members, because you 
believe in the history of the United 
States research and development that 
we have achieved innovation goals— 
whether that was what we did with the 
internet, whether that was what we 
have done on biosciences, even on some 
of our issues as it relates to energy. We 
have achieved big breakthroughs. 
So today’s vote is about investing in 
that innovation economy of the future. 
I am pretty confident because I have 
met some of these innovators across 
the United States. I don’t know if ev-
erything that we have done so far will 
be absorbed by universities, our re-
searchers, and our labs, but literally, 
we are trying to dust off R&D skills 
and make them more competitive for 
today. 
I guarantee you, though, these dol-
lars 
that 
reach 
American 
entre-
preneurs, 
who 
reach 
American 
innovators, they are ready and willing 
to take up this challenge. Give them 
those collaborative research resources 
through innovation at universities, 
through tech hubs, through more col-
laboration 
on 
workforce 
training, 
through investments in semiconduc-
tors, and I guarantee you these entre-
preneurs in America will innovate our 
economy and create the economies of 
the future. 
And what is at stake? If my col-
leagues have a better idea, I am willing 
to hear it. But I know this: Americans 
want us to lead on their regional 
economies, on the U.S. economies, and 
on global economies. They do not want 
to get left behind. They look at this 
time and era as a challenge to the lead-
ership we have provided in the past. 
So settling for Federal investment 
being near their lowest point as a per-
centage of GDP in 60 years won’t cut it. 
What cuts it is making an investment 
in R&D and empowering those entre-
preneurs so they will create those fu-
ture economies. 
I yield the floor.

Cornyn-Cotton amendment No. 1858 (to 
amendment No. 1502), to modify the semicon-
ductor incentives program of the Depart-
ment of Commerce. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under 
the previous order, there will now be 3 
minutes of debate, equally divided, 
prior to a vote in relation to amend-
ment No. 1858 offered by the Senator 
from Texas, Mr. CORNYN. 
Mr. CORNYN. Madam President. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Texas. 
AMENDMENT NO. 1858 
Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, dur-
ing the committee markup on this bill 
in the Commerce Committee, there was 
an amendment offered that was accept-
ed that added Davis-Bacon prevailing 
wage protection to the underlying bill, 
which is now in the bill before us. 
This is purely a gratuitous addition 
to this bill because the fact is, in con-
structing these major semiconductor 
fabs, they pay far greater than the pre-
vailing wage. But perhaps the most 
dangerous part of this is the fact that 
this now is being applied to private 
construction. 
Davis-Bacon historically and statu-
torily has been applied only to public 
workers. But this is an unnecessary ex-
pansion and, frankly, jeopardizes some 
of the support we are getting for the 
underlying bill, which we cannot afford 
to lose any of that support in our com-
petition against China, particularly 
when it comes to manufacturing semi-
conductors here onshore and shoring 
up the vulnerable supply chain. 
I would ask colleagues to vote for the 
amendment. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Washington. 
Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, 
construction is hard, dangerous work, 
and too often, when it comes to wages 
for workers, we see a race to the bot-
tom, where workers and communities 
lose. 
Prevailing wage requirements, such 
as we have in this bill, help make sure 
that construction jobs created by the 
Federal Government come with a fair 
wage that supports our local commu-
nity. 
Prevailing wage requirements have 
long had bipartisan support, including 
in this bill. This amendment would 
strip those protections for construction 
workers at the same time we need to 
help rebuild our country’s infrastruc-
ture. 
The workers and the communities 
that build our bridges and our high-
ways and other critical infrastructure 
deserve the protections and benefits 
prevailing wage provides. 
I urge my colleagues to oppose 
amendment No. 1858.

The amendment (No. 1858) was re-
jected. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. MUR-
PHY). The Senator from Florida. 
POINT OF ORDER 
Mr. SCOTT of Florida. Mr. President, 
there is clearly an urgent need for the 
United States to address the growing 
threat posed by Communist China. In 
so doing, we can’t forget the commit-
ment we all made to American tax-
payers to be responsible stewards of 
their tax dollars. 
America is in a nearly $30 trillion 
debt crisis. We can’t afford to spend 
more than $250 billion on a bill that 
doesn’t pay for itself. Worse, it would 
add to our national yearly deficit in 
dramatic fashion, which is what trig-
gers the point of order I am raising 
today. 
In 2018, we agreed not to pass spend-
ing bills without a way to pay for 
them, but there is no plan to pay for 
this. We are completely ignoring our 
own rules to advance this spending. 
Spending beyond our means has con-
sequences. There will be a day of reck-
oning. The pending measure, Senate 
amendment No. 1502 to S. 1260, would 
violate the Senate pay-go rule by in-
creasing the on-budget deficit. There-
fore, I raise a point of order against 
this measure pursuant to section 4106 
of H. Con. Res. 71 to the concurrent res-
olution on the budget for fiscal year 
2018. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Washington. 
MOTION TO WAIVE 
Ms. CANTWELL. Pursuant to section 
904 of the Congressional Budget Act of 
1974, the waiver provisions of applica-
ble budget resolutions, and section 
4(g)3 of the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go 
Act of 2010, I move to waive all applica-
ble sections of those acts and applica-
ble budget resolutions for the purposes 
of the pending measure, and I ask for 
the yeas and nays. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a 
sufficient second? 
There appears to be a sufficient sec-
ond. 
The yeas and nays are ordered. 
The Senator from Washington. 
Ms. CANTWELL. If I could explain to 
my colleagues about this vote because 
it goes far beyond the simplicity of just 
the debate regarding the semicon-
ductor chips and emergency appropria-
tions. 
The way this point of order is draft-
ed, basically, it would gut the bill. Ba-
sically, it not only guts the provisions 
related to the chips emergency appro-
priations, but it strikes the Foreign 
Relations Committee’s work, it strikes 
the Homeland Security Committee’s 
work, it strikes the Banking Commit-
tee’s work, it effectively strikes the 
HELP Committee’s work and the Judi-
ciary’s, and most importantly, the Fi-
nance Committee’s work, which it was 
the entire Finance Committee’s insist-
ence that the GSP, the System of Pref-
erences, be included in the bill. 
So all of those things that everybody 
wishes would be in the bill would no 
longer be in the bill, including the De-
partment of Energy funding, the in-
crease in STEM funding, and many 
other provisions. 
I ask my colleagues to waive the 
budget point of order. Vote yes, and let 
us move this legislation forward. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER.

question is on agreeing to the motion 
to waive.

1905, 2081, AND 1782 AS MODIFIED 
Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, we 
have been working for almost a month 
to review and vet hundreds of amend-
ments filed by my colleagues on both 
sides. You maybe followed the floor de-
bate here, where we agreed to numer-
ous amendments and had discussions 
on many more—I think 20, to be exact. 
We had been working on a managers’ 
package that was previously objected 
to before we left for the recess. Since 
then, we have been working diligently 
with our colleague Senator WICKER, on 
the Commerce Committee, to put forth 
a bipartisan package of amendments to 
improve the legislation. Many of these 
provisions have been great bipartisan 
efforts: Senators ERNST and HASSAN’s 
bipartisan 
amendment 
to 
improve 
transparency of the National Science 
Foundation 
grant 
funding; 
Senator 
COLLINS’ amendment to require an up-
date on implementation of the Energy 
Implementation Act; Senator BLACK-
BURN had a technical fix on studying 
the possible threats to our communica-
tions network and fiber optic trans-
mission; Senator WARNOCK’s amend-
ment to clarify the definition of minor-
ity-serving 
institutions 
on 
STEM 
grants; Senator CORTEZ MASTO worked 
on several bipartisan pieces of legisla-
tion to resolve issues on amendments 
dealing with critical minerals and re-
cycling, something very important to 
us as a nation. 
So, in total, we have 42 amend-
ments—23 led by Republicans, 19 led by 
Democrats—many of which, as I said, 
are 
bipartisan. 
These 
amendments 
would seek to improve the bill and ac-
complish Member priorities. And this 
is what happens when you negotiate on 
the Senate floor in regular order. You 
vote on amendments; you have some 
voice vote amendments; and you have a 
managers’ package. 
So I hope our colleagues will consider 
giving our colleagues a chance to have 
their amendments that have been 
agreed to accepted into this package. 
So I ask unanimous consent that the 
following amendments be agreed to en 
bloc: Collins 1583; Fischer 1637; Johnson 
1701; Shaheen 1758; Rubio 1777; Thune 
1851; Wicker 1943; Hagerty 1958; Cotton

The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
The Senator from Kentucky. 
Mr. PAUL. This bill adds over $250 
billion to our debt. The additional debt 
will make us weaker, not stronger. As 
we speak, the massive Federal spending 
of the last 2 years is already causing 
inflation throughout the supply chain 
and eventually will lead to economic 
stagnation. 
There is nothing conservative about 
this bill. The bill is nothing more than 
a Big Government response that will 
make our country weaker, not strong-
er. I object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ob-
jection is heard. 
Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I do 
believe our colleagues have worked 
hard to have their legislation consid-
ered. I want them to know I am going 
to continue to promulgate these ideas 
about competitiveness. 
You know, I had a chance to fly 
home, and for me it is a long way. It is 
51⁄2 hours so you get a lot of reading 
done. And I read Chris Wallace’s new 
book about 1945 and the number of days 
that our Nation had to respond to the 
threat of war, what it took them to go 
out 
and 
develop 
the 
Manhattan 
Project, to get them to go and not only 
in my State, develop the Hanford site— 
Los Alamos developed that—and not 
only that, developed what happened at 
Oak Ridge and a scientific response to 
make our Nation more secure. All we 
are asking for here is a little R&D dol-
lars. So I can tell you that I wish we 
would find a Leslie Groves of today be-
cause those are the people who re-
sponded to our Nation when we needed 
to respond in a competitive fashion. 
I am so sorry that our colleagues’ 
amendments are not going to be con-
sidered, but if my colleague’s under-
lying premise is that you don’t want to 
respond to the competitive threats to 
our Nation, you have a right to vote 
no. But holding up our colleagues’ good 
work, I think, is a mistake. 
I will commit to our colleagues that 
these important things on critical min-
erals, on transparency, and on moving 
forward on science, we will continue to 
work with you. 
I thank the Presiding Officer, and I 
think now we have a vote on the sub-
stitute amendment.

The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under

Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, last 
week, China announced that it would 
now allow families to have three chil-
dren—a profound shift from their pre-
vious one- and two-child policies. 
Why the change? China looked to the 
future and realized that its population 
policies 
would 
hamper 
economic 
growth. Now, the U.S. Government will 
never tell families how many children 
to have. That choice is profoundly per-
sonal. Yet we must ask ourselves the 
same questions China is asking: What 
kind of changes will lead or deter the 
United States from a future of eco-
nomic growth and prosperity? How can 
we enhance America’s competitive-
ness? And more than just compete, how 
can we make sure America comes in 
first?

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S3978 
June 8, 2021 
The answer is obvious: Invest in 
American creativity. China is investing 
heavily in electric vehicles, critical 
minerals, energy production, computer 
chips—the list goes on. In all of these 
areas, China is beginning to pull ahead 
of the pack. They are aiming for first. 
And what underscores all of their ef-
forts? Research. Every breakthrough, 
every new technology, every scientific 
step forward opens new markets and 
drives their economy into the future at 
high speed. 
Unfortunately, it is a different story 
in America. For decades, in both the 
public and private sectors, we have 
downsized our discovery and innova-
tion investments. Since the days of the 
space race, we have stepped away from 
the great challenge of discovery. If we 
were to commit the same percentage of 
our national budget to research today 
as we did in the Apollo era, we would 
invest $900 billion over 5 years. That 
kind of an investment puts people on 
the Moon. That kind of investment 
puts us in first. 
So how do we get there? The U.S. In-
novation and Competition Act would 
set us back on track and at a fraction 
of the cost of Apollo-era spending. As 
we debate and hopefully pass this bill, 
we must keep asking: What are we will-
ing to do to be No. 1? 
One important way we can compete 
with countries like China is by increas-
ing support for domestic manufac-
turing and strengthening our domestic 
supply chains. The legislation before us 
does exactly that. It provides $52 bil-
lion in emergency funding to boost our 
domestic 
semiconductor 
manufac-
turing capabilities. In 1990, the United 
States produced 37 percent of the 
world’s semiconductors, but today, just 
12 percent of semiconductors are manu-
factured in the United States. Now, we 
are 
facing 
a 
global 
shortage 
of 
microchips, which is impacting jobs in 
my State and many others. 
I am proud that Illinois has long been 
a leader in auto manufacturing, thanks 
to dedicated workers like those at a 
Stellantis plant in Belvidere, IL, who 
assemble 
Jeep 
Cherokees. 
Unfortu-
nately, that plant was forced to shut 
down in March due to the global short-
age of semiconductors. And last month, 
Stellantis announced that as many as 
1,640 employees at the plant could be 
laid off in July—again, because it does 
not have enough microchips. After 
briefly resuming operations last week, 
the plant already has had to shut down 
again for 2 weeks because of this short-
age. Last week, I spoke to representa-
tives from Stellantis who shared that 
the U.S. Innovation and Competition 
Act could make a real difference in 
terms of boosting supply of these chips. 
This funding is not just important 
for the assembly plant in Belvidere. 
Sadly, we are seeing similar impacts of 
the semiconductor shortage at Ford’s 
Chicago Assembly Plant, which sup-
ports 5,800 jobs. That plant was idled 
through April, with shutdowns ex-
tended into May. 
We urgently need to act to address 
this global microchip shortage to pro-
vide certainty to the workers whose 
livelihoods depend on a stable supply of 
semiconductors. The legislation before 
us will not only address our immediate 
market needs but it will also help pre-
vent these shortages again the future. 
This investment supports jobs across 
the entire supply chain, from construc-
tion of new facilities, to manufacturing 
and development of chips, to workers 
in the auto industry who depend on a 
reliable supply of semiconductors, to 
American consumers. 
The U.S. Innovation and Competition 
Act is the result of weeks of negotia-
tion and bipartisan work. I was puzzled 
by some of my Republican colleagues’ 
arguments for voting against cloture 
on this bill. If you don’t want China’s 
products and values to dominate the 
global marketplace, why would you 
cede that marketplace to China—or 
anyone else, for that matter? If you be-
lieve in America’s products, values, 
and most of all, its people, then do the 
smart thing: Invest in them. Although 
some of my colleagues seem to believe 
otherwise, invective isn’t going to win 
this global competition. We need in-
vestment to remain No. 1. 
No one bill will secure America’s eco-
nomic prosperity or national security 
or resolve all of the outstanding issues 
in our relationship with China, but 
strengthening America’s role as a glob-
al leader in science and technology is 
an essential piece of our effort to pre-
serving American leadership in this 
world. So I put it to my fellow Sen-
ators: Let’s take a step forward today. 
Let’s invest in the research, the jobs, 
and the future that all Americans de-
serve. I plan to vote in favor of the U.S. 
Innovation and Competition Act, and I 
urge my colleagues to do the same. 
Let’s not settle for second best. Let’s 
put America in the lead. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Washington. 
Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that myself, Sen-
ator CANTWELL, Senator WICKER, Sen-
ator YOUNG, and Senator SCHUMER be 
allowed to speak before the vote. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
an objection? 
Without objection, it is so ordered. 
Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I 
just wanted to take a moment to 
thank, obviously, my colleagues, Sen-
ator SCHUMER and Senator YOUNG, for 
their hard work on this legislation and 
thank 
my 
counterpart, 
Senator 
WICKER, for his tremendous effort in 
moving this bill. 
We have now been on this bill, and we 
reported it out May 12. I think it came 
on the calendar May 13, and, literally, 
we have been working on it since. So 
this is a very hard effort to produce 
something very important to today’s 
economy. So I want to thank Senator 
SCHUMER’s staff, Mike Lynch, Meghan 
Taira, Gerry Petrella; and John Keast, 
Crystal Tully, Steven Wall, James 
Mazol, 
Cheri 
Pascoe 
of 
Senator 
WICKER’s office. 
On my team, David Strickland, Me-
lissa Porter, and Mary Guenther. But, 
specifically, I want to thank Richard- 
Duane Chambers, who came to the Sen-
ate from the Defense Advanced Re-
search Projects Agency, I think, maybe 
like a week before we started working 
on this bill. So, literally, since he 
joined the Senate Commerce Com-
mittee, he has been just knee-deep in 
the conversation of dusting off our 
R&D for the Nation, making a new in-
vestment, making more translational 
science. So I really appreciate Richard- 
Duane’s effort. 
I also want to thank Gigi Slais, 
Shawn Bone, John Branscome, Ronce 
Almond, 
Alex 
Simpson, 
Jared 
Bomberg, 
Shannon 
Smith, 
John 
Beezer, Noam Kantor, Tiffany George, 
Jordan Blue, Kara Fischer, Nikky 
Teutschel, Matthew Bobbink, Caitlin 
Warner, Alex Kiles, George Greenwell, 
Elle Wibisono, Alexis Gutierrez, Eric 
Vryheid, Brian McDermott, Lucy Koch, 
Hunter Blackburn, and Alex Hall. So 
all of these people. 
I think my colleagues know that 
these bills don’t come about easily. 
They come through a lot of hard work. 
And we thank everybody for partici-
pating in a regular order process out 
here on the Senate floor to produce a 
bipartisan result for something so im-
portant to our Nation’s competitive-
ness. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Mississippi. 
Mr. WICKER. Mr. President, I cer-
tainly rise in support of this legislation 
and urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote. This is an op-
portunity for the United States to 
strike a blow on behalf of answering 
the unfair competition that we are see-
ing from Communist China, and it is an 
opportunity to have a game changer in 
terms of geographic diversity in our re-
search effort. 
This morning, the Armed Services 
Committee heard extensive testimony 
about the need to compete with China 
at the military level. This is an oppor-
tunity to compete with China at the 
research level. This bill will strengthen 
our country’s innovation in key tech-
nology fields of the future—in areas 
such as artificial intelligence, robotics, 
quantum computing, and communica-
tions. 
And this bill also is a game changer 
in terms of giving universities all over 
the United States an opportunity to 
participate in game-changing research, 
which will help us compete. Univer-
sities, largely in smaller States such as 
mine, have been left behind in the past. 
They will finally, under this legisla-
tion, have an opportunity to partici-
pate in research at a meaningful 
level—so two good reasons to vote yes. 
The distinguished chair of the com-
mittee has been gracious in thanking 
all of our staffs on the majority and 
the minority side. I appreciate her 
doing that, as well as Senator CANT-
WELL’s admirable job of managing this 
bill through the committee. 
I congratulate the two authors of 
this bill, Senator SCHUMER and Senator

YOUNG, who sponsored this legislation. 
This bill is headed toward passage with 
a fine bipartisan vote, and I am pleased

The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-

Mr. YOUNG. Mr. President, I want to 
begin by thanking my colleagues: Sen-

Nancy Martinez, on my ledge staff. 
They went above and beyond. 
So this piece of legislation, yes, it, 
indeed, is related to countering the 
threat that the Chinese Communist 
Party presents to this country. But it 
also is a piece of legislation that we are 
considering at a time when so many of 
our citizens feel overlooked, when the 
intimate communities that they call 
home feel hollowed out, when trust in 
our civic institutions is eroding, and 
when allegiance seems increasingly to 
our political tribes and not to one an-
other on behalf of the common good. 
So let’s not kid ourselves. The Chi-
nese Communist Party aims to exploit 
all of these divisions. They aim to ex-
ploit the insecurities of the global age. 
They aim to ensure that their power 
and their capabilities continue to grow. 
And they are, indeed, locked in a global 
competition with the United States of 
America and with our partners and al-
lies. 
So let’s do what we have always done 
as Americans in times like this. Let’s 
come together, and let’s use this as an 
opportunity to become a better version 
of ourselves. 
I will end with this. When generation 
after generation of immigrants have 
come into the New York Harbor, they 
have seen that beautiful Statue of Lib-
erty. And at the base of the Statue of 
Liberty is a sonnet, and everyone here 
in this Chamber and so many across 
America are familiar with the words of 
that sonnet: ‘‘Give me your tired, your 
poor, your huddled masses . . . ’’ 
There is also a line in there that I 
particularly love about ‘‘imprisoned 
lightning’’—‘‘imprisoned lightning.’’ I 
am not sure what Emma Lazarus 
meant by the phrase ‘‘imprisoned light-
ning,’’ but to me that ‘‘imprisoned 
lightning’’ refers to the untapped po-
tential, the God-given potential of 
every human being. And this legisla-
tion, the Endless Frontier Act, aims to 
tap into that ‘‘imprisoned lightning’’ of 
people across the heartland to ensure 
that they can stay part of the eco-
nomic game in the 21st century and 
that 
they 
help 
us 
outcompete, 
outinnovate, and outgrow the Chinese 
Communist Party. We will win. We are 
going to get a great vote today, and I 
thank all of my colleagues for their in-
tention to support this legislation. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ma-
jority leader. 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, first, 
I, too, would like to thank Senators 
CANTWELL and WICKER for an amazing, 
bipartisan job; and Senators MENENDEZ 
and RISCH, another great bipartisan 
contribution. All the Members—just 
about every Member has contributed to 
this bill. 
I do want to single out two of my 
staff members who just slaved over this 
bill relentlessly, and that is Mike 
Kuiken and Jon Cardinal. Mike is 
there. I don’t know if Jon is here. But 
they deserve tremendous kudos for 
what they did. Without them I don’t 
think we would have had a bill, to be 
honest with you—and everybody else, 
all the other staffs who worked so 
hard. 
Now, this is a quote from Dr. 
Vannevar Bush: ‘‘Without scientific 
progress, no amount of achievement in 
other directions can insure our health, 
prosperity, and security in the modern 
world.’’ 
That was Dr. Vannevar Bush, the 
head of the U.S. Office of Scientific Re-
search, writing in 1945. His report to 
President 
Truman 
was 
titled: 
‘‘Science—The Endless Frontier’’—an 
inspiration to the legislation we con-
sidered today. 
In the wake of Dr. Bush’s report, we 
created the National Science Founda-
tion. We funded the National Labora-
tories. We split the atom. We spliced 
the gene. We landed a man on the 
Moon. We unleashed the internet. We 
generated 75 years of American pros-
perity and fostered an innate sense of 
optimism in the American spirit. 
We face a challenge now—in this cen-
tury—to replicate the success of the 
previous one. But the Federal Govern-
ment’s commitment to science, unfor-
tunately, has waned. As a percentage 
of GDP, we spend less than half as 
much as the Chinese Communist Party 
on basic research. 
We rely on foreign nations to supply 
critical technologies that we invented, 
like 
semiconductors. 
That 
sunny 
American optimism has flickered as 
well. 
The world is more competitive now 
than at any time since the end of the 
Second World War. If we do nothing, 
our days as the dominant superpower 
may be ending. 
We don’t mean to let those days end 
on our watch. We don’t mean to see 
America become a middling nation in 
this century. We mean for America to 
lead it. Passing this bill—now called 
the U.S. Innovation and Competition 
Act—is the moment when the Senate 
lays the foundation for another cen-
tury of American leadership. 
Let me say that again. This bill 
could be the turning point for Amer-
ican leadership in the 21st century, and 
for that reason, this legislation will go 
down as one of the most significant bi-
partisan achievements of the U.S. Sen-
ate in recent history. 
Around the globe, authoritarian gov-
ernments believe that squabbling de-
mocracies like ours can’t unite around 
national priorities. They believe that 
democracy itself is a relic of the past 
and that by beating us to emerging 
technologies, 
they—many 
of 
the 
meritocracies—will be able to reshape 
the world in their own image. 
Well, let me tell you something. I be-
lieve they are wrong. I believe that this 
legislation 
will 
enable 
the 
United 
States to outinnovate, outproduce, and 
outcompete the world in the industries 
of the future. I believe that the strong-
ly bipartisan work on this bill has re-
vealed that in this Chamber, we all be-
lieve that another American century 
lies on the horizon. I urge my col-
leagues to vote yes. 
I yield the floor.

The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without

f 
PAYCHECK FAIRNESS ACT 
Mr. 
DURBIN. 
Madam 
President, 
there are still millions of women 
across this country today who are 
doing the same jobs as their male col-
leagues and are being paid less. It is 
more clear than ever that we must 
take steps to close loopholes that allow 
for pay discrimination and empower 
women to hold their employers ac-
countable when pay discrimination oc-
curs. Nearly 60 years after passage of 
the Equal Pay Act and 12 years after 
passage of the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay 
Act, women still only earn 82 cents for 
every dollar paid to men on average. 
For women of color, the wage gap is 
even worse. Black women make only 63 
cents for every dollar paid to White 
men, and Latina women make only 55 
cents. Mothers make just 75 cents for 
every dollar paid to fathers. 
Throughout the pandemic, too many 
families have wondered how they will 
feed their families, keep their homes, 
and care for their children amid an un-
precedented public health and eco-
nomic crisis. For working mothers, it 
has been especially challenging. The 
labor force participation rate among 
women has dropped to 57.4 percent, the 
lowest it has been since 1988. A survey 
last fall found that almost 40 percent of 
working mothers in Illinois lost their 
jobs or were working reduced hours. 
Nearly half of working mothers of 
color reported the same. 
Why has this economic crisis been so 
economically devastating for so many 
women? The reasons are clear. Women 
tend to be overrepresented in the in-
dustries that were hit hardest by the 
pandemic, such as restaurants, retail, 
and leisure and hospitality. And many 
women are the primary caretakers for 
their 
families. 
With 
schools 
and 
childcare programs closed, what choice 
did mothers have other than to step 
back from work? 
The economic hardship women have 
faced during the pandemic has only 
been made worse by the wage gap. 
From wage discrimination to the un-
availability of childcare, women are 
not getting a fair deal. That means 
working families are not getting a fair 
deal, and it must change. 
This week, we have the opportunity 
to pass legislation that would close the 
loopholes that allow paycheck dis-
crimination to continue. The Lilly 
Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, which pro-
hibits gender-based pay discrimination, 
was the first bill signed into law by 
President Obama back in 2009. Unfortu-
nately, it is hard to enforce because 
employers still maintain policies that 
punish 
employees 
who 
voluntarily 
share salary information with their co-
workers. Women can’t demand equal 
pay if they don’t know they are being 
underpaid. 
The Paycheck Fairness Act would en-
sure workers cannot be retaliated 
against if they disclose their wages. It 
also would prohibit employers from 
asking prospective employees about 
their salary history. And it would re-
quire employers to prove that pay dis-
parities exist for legitimate, job-re-
lated reasons—not just because they 
believe ‘‘women’s work’’ is worth less. 
I am happy to join Senator MURRAY 
and my Democratic colleagues in sup-
porting this important legislation. 
Women have carried America’s fami-
lies through this pandemic, but it may 
take years for women to recover from 
the economic and career setbacks they 
have suffered. By passing the Paycheck 
Fairness Act, we can take an impor-
tant step toward helping women and 
their families fully recover from this 
pandemic and economic crisis. 
I am disappointed that Republican 
opposition has previously prevented 
the Senate from passing this bill. I 
hope that my colleagues on the other 
side of the aisle can agree it is time to 
pass this commonsense measure that 
will help put more money in the pock-
ets of women and their families across 
the country. 
Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, you 
know, it has been more than half a cen-
tury since the Equal Pay Act became 
law, and 12 years since President 
Obama signed the Lilly Ledbetter Fair 
Pay Act, but women in the United 
States still, on average, earn only 82 
cents on the dollar compared to their 
male counterparts, and the wage gap is 
far greater for women of color because, 
even though the Equal Pay Act and the 
Lilly Ledbetter Act were critical steps 
forward, there is clearly a lot more we 
have got to do. 
Right now, an employer can brush 
aside reports of pay discrimination by 
saying things like, ‘‘Well, he was a bet-
ter negotiator’’ or ‘‘They work in dif-
ferent buildings.’’ I mean, what does 
that have to do with it? 
And too often, a woman’s history of 
being paid less means she gets paid less 
in the future because her past salary 
can be used to determine her future 
salary, regardless of what her counter-
parts are making or her new respon-
sibilities, 
and 
that 
has 
real 
con-
sequences for women and their fami-
lies. 
Today, 4 out of 10 mothers with chil-
dren under the age of 18 are their fam-
ily’s primary or sole breadwinners. As 
families rely more on women’s wages 
to make ends meet, the gender pay gap 
has an even greater impact on children. 
For example, over the course of just 
1 year, the wage gap for Latino women 
averages almost $30,000 less compared 
to what a White man earns. We are 
talking about women losing out on 
hundreds of thousands of dollars over 
the course of their working lives, and 
that is money that could go to pay the 
bills, put food on the table, buy a 
house, start a business, save for retire-
ment, get an education, and so much 
more. 
Instead, women struggle with life-
long financial effects, including higher 
poverty rates as compared to men. 
Women are being shortchanged, plain 
and simple. 
And this pandemic, by the way, has 
made things worse. Millions of women 
now, as we know, have left the labor 
force, and many have fallen behind just 
as caregiving responsibilities have dis-
proportionately fallen on them. 
According to one study, a woman 
who was earning about $47,000 a year 
before the pandemic, could lose nearly 
a quarter of a million dollars over her 
lifetime, assuming she is able to return 
to work this year. 
The pandemic has set women—and in 
particular, women of color—back even 
further and made clear just how urgent 
it is for us to act because, you know 
what, if women don’t recover from this 
crisis, our economy will not either, 
which is why we desperately need to 
close the wage gap. 
We have got a responsibility to fi-
nally make sure women are paid fairly 
for their work so women can build fi-
nancial security for themselves, for 
their families, for their communities, 
and so our economy—so much of which 
is driven by women, by the way—can 
fully recover from this crisis. 
We have been fighting for the Pay-
check Fairness Act for quite some 
time, but for those who need a re-
minder, here is what it would do sim-
ply, very straightforward: It will close 
the loopholes that allow pay discrimi-
nation to continue and protect workers 
from retaliation for discussing their 
pay; it will limit the use of prior wage 
history in the hiring process so pay dis-
crimination 
cannot 
follow 
workers 
from job to job; and it will increase 
transparency and accountability so 
workers know whether they are being 
treated fairly and so they have the evi-
dence to hold their employers account-
able if they are not. 
These are commonsense steps, and 
that is why this bill already passed the 
House with bipartisan support, and it is 
up to the Senate now to get this done 
because the reality is each and every 
Senator represents a State where half 
of the population earns less than they 
deserve, and that is ridiculous. 
It is past time we end this injustice. 
I urge my colleagues to join me in vot-
ing to finally put money women have 
earned fair and square in their pockets 
where it belongs and take an essential 
step toward ensuring our economy can 
build back stronger and fairer from 
COVID–19. 
There is absolutely nothing con-
troversial about making sure every 
worker gets paid fairly for their work. 
Women have been waiting long enough. 
They need the Paycheck Fairness Act 
now more than ever. Let’s get this 
done.

jority leader.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S3981 
June 8, 2021 
on this bill but on this issue for pretty 
close to a decade, and it is long over-
due. 
You know, we have been working in a 
very bipartisan way on numerous sub-
jects, including the competition bill 
that just passed, but it appears there 
are real limits to bipartisanship here in 
the Senate. 
We are about to vote just to start de-
bate—just to start debate on a bill that 
is very simple—provide equal pay for 
women. It is a modest proposal to ad-
dress a real problem in our economy. 
Women with the same jobs and same 
qualifications as their male colleagues 
often make less money. It is too hard 
for too many women to overcome that 
pay discrimination. This makes it easi-
er for women to achieve pay parity, 
and like the previous bill, will help un-
leash strong economic forces to help 
America go forward because when 
women are not getting the pay they de-
serve, it impedes our whole economy 
and all of the human resources that we 
need. 
Every Senate Democrat is ready to 
start debate on the Paycheck Fairness 
Act, but Senate Republicans seem to be 
mounting another partisan filibuster 
against this bill. 
It is ridiculous that Senate Repub-
licans will not even allow the Senate to 
debate a straightforward piece of legis-
lation to help provide equal pay for 
working women in America, just like it 
was ridiculous for the Republican mi-
nority to filibuster bipartisan legisla-
tion to create an independent Commis-
sion on January 6. 
Americans expect their government 
to make progress to improve our coun-
try, but Senate Republicans once again 
seem to be choosing obstruction. 
I yield the floor.

f 
CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, for 
over a year now, people worldwide have 
experienced immeasurable pain, suf-
fering, and loss. This pandemic has 
tested each and every one of us in ways 
that we didn’t know possible. 
But perhaps no one has been more 
tested than our Nation’s frontline, es-
sential healthcare workers. They, like 
so many other frontline workers, did 
not have the option to telework, to so-
cially distance, to remain in their 
homes, with their families, while the 
coronavirus 
ravaged 
our 
commu-
nities—no, just the opposite. They 
showed up more than ever before. 
Not only did our Nation’s doctors, 
nurses, and other medical professionals 
put their own health concerns aside to 
treat COVID patients, they continued 
to see all their other patients who 
couldn’t afford to delay treatment, the 
heart attack and stroke victims, the 
chemotherapy and dialysis patients, 
the pregnant moms and new babies, 
people who had been involved in car ac-
cidents or were victims of gun vio-
lence. 
When the rest of the world was being 
encouraged to stay home and avoid 
interactions with people, our medical 
providers continued to report to hos-
pitals, community health centers, doc-
tor’s offices. They did so even when 
they weren’t provided the proper per-
sonal protective equipment. They did 
so even when it meant that they had to 
quarantine from their own families. 
They did so even when it meant extra 
shifts on little to no sleep. They did so 
even when it meant spending each day 
watching dying patients say their final 
goodbyes to loved ones over Zoom. And 
they did so even when, in the midst of 
all of this, they were subjected to rac-
ism, sexism, and hate. 
An essay that appeared in the New 
York Times last month detailed one 
doctor’s 
experience. 
Dr. 
Chaya 
Bhuvaneswar—a female, Asian-Amer-
ican, Boston-area physician—recalled 
an incident last April, when a patient 
spit on her and said she ‘‘brought the 
sickness.’’ 
Anti-Asian bigotry is, sadly, nothing 
new in this country, and the rise of it 
during COVID was certainly fueled by 
our former President, who seemed to 
delight in coining hateful, racist termi-
nology to describe the coronavirus. 
Like so many others, our healthcare 
providers, whether they are Asian 
American or African American, or 
members of other minority groups, are 
subjected to racism, simply in the 
course of doing their jobs. 
Racism is inexcusable always, but 
imagine how much worse it must have 
felt this past year, risking your life 
every single day to help a nation in the 
midst of a deadly pandemic, only to be 
subjected to racial slurs, offensive 
stereotypes, and vile actions. If this 
past year has taught us anything, it is 
that our Nation still has a long way to 
go on issues of race and immigration. 
Consider this: One in six healthcare 
and social service workers are immi-
grants. Yet our broken immigration 
laws prevent many immigrants from 
contributing more fully to the battle 
against the pandemic.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S3982 
June 8, 2021 
As long as I am a U.S. Senator, I will 
continue to come to fight for all immi-
grants. We must ensure that the hun-
dreds of thousands of immigrant work-
ers in our essential workforce are not 
forced to stop contributing when the 
need for their service has never been 
greater, and we must give them the 
chance they deserve to become Amer-
ican citizens. They have waited long 
enough. 
I hope that, even in these divided 
times, we can come together in Con-
gress to quickly aid our immigrant 
healthcare heroes and other essential 
workers. Whether we are witnessing 
horrific, racially motivated acts of po-
lice brutality on the nightly news or 
reading about bigoted verbal and phys-
ical assaults in our hospitals, it is clear 
that the epidemic of racism, which 
long predated this pandemic, has not 
gone anywhere. 
It is my hope that, someday soon, we 
can look at one another and see how 
much more unites us than divides us, 
but for now, let me just offer another 
word 
of 
thanks 
to 
our 
Nation’s 
healthcare workforce: You have all 
given so much and endured so much. 
We are eternally thankful for all you 
have done and all you will continue to 
do.

TRIBUTE TO EULA HALL 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President, 
Southeastern Kentucky lost Eula Hall 
this May, a humanitarian titan who 
blessed 
her 
community 
with 
gen-
erosity, tenacity, and dedication. Eula 
was a self-described ‘‘hillbilly activist’’ 
whose efforts to improve healthcare in 
Kentucky enhanced the lives of her 
neighbors and friends. As the founder 
of the Mud Creek Clinic, now known as 
the Eula Hall Health Center, Eula was 
driven by her selfless spirit to deliver 
quality care to thousands of Kentuck-
ians. Today, I recognize Eula Hall as a 
lifelong champion of Floyd County and 
the entire Southeastern Kentucky re-
gion. 
Eula founded the Mud Creek Clinic in 
1973 with a $1,400 donation and a calling 
to improve healthcare in her disadvan-
taged community. She served every-
one, regardless of their ability to pay, 
through a primary care clinic, mental 
health counselor, pharmacy, and food 
and clothing pantry. Even after her 
clinic burned down in 1982, Eula did not 
miss a day of service, delivering help 
directly from her own home. She rede-
fined healthcare in Southeastern Ken-
tucky from the ground up, leaving an 
indelible impact on the region. 
Eula was born into extreme poverty, 
growing up without plumbing or elec-
tricity and only receiving an eighth- 
grade education. In spite of these ob-
stacles, she was driven by a higher call-
ing to serve her community. When 
Eula founded the Mud Creek Clinic, she 
did so based on a conviction that all 
Kentuckians, regardless of income, de-
served to be cared for by their neigh-
bors. Her work quickly caught the at-
tention of local leaders and physicians, 
bringing much needed resources to her 
distressed region. 
She was a local activist from a young 
age, driven by the struggles and suf-
fering she saw during her childhood. 
Motivated by a desire to assist the vul-
nerable, Eula gave help to the needy 
and a voice to the voiceless through an 
ever-expanding series of projects. With 
an unflappable work ethic, Eula would 
go on to run the Mud Creek Water Dis-
trict, piping drinking water to 800 
homes, and served as the president of 
the Kentucky Black Lung Association. 
Her tireless, grassroots efforts have 
left an enduring legacy of community- 
based activism in Southeastern Ken-
tucky. 
Eula’s 
industriousness 
permeated 
every aspect of her life, even as she en-
tered old age. Just last year, she was 
working on a proposal to found a nurs-
ing home in her area as a response to 
the COVID–19 pandemic. In recognition 
of her determination and tenacity, 
Eula received a number of awards, in-
cluding 
honorary 
doctorates 
from 
Berea, Midway, and Pikeville colleges 
in Kentucky and Trinity College in 
Connecticut. She was also the subject 
of a landmark book on healthcare in 
Eastern Kentucky, ‘‘Mud Creek Medi-
cine,’’ by Kiran Bhatraju. She led a vi-
brant family, and is survived by 4 chil-
dren, 8 grandchildren, 14 great-grand-
children, 
and 
5 
great-great-grand-
children. 
I had the opportunity to speak with 
Eula just a few weeks before she passed 
and expressed my deep appreciation for 
her decades of hard work. During our 
numerous conversations and visits, I 
was always struck by her ceaseless de-
votion to Southeastern Kentuckians. 
Eula was honored with tributes from 
around the country, including from the 
U.S. Senate, but she never sought the 
spotlight. She preferred to dedicate her 
entire focus to the needy in her com-
munity. 
After her passing, Eula was recog-
nized by both the Wall Street Journal 
and 
the 
New 
York 
Times, 
dem-
onstrating the nationwide impact of 
her work. She was one of the toughest 
women I ever met, and it was an abso-
lute pleasure to work with her over the 
years to deliver much needed help to 
Kentucky communities. I would like to 
express my personal gratitude for Eula 
Hall’s decades of service to the Com-
monwealth and encourage my Senate 
colleagues to join me in sharing condo-
lences with her family, colleagues, and 
neighbors, whose lives were uplifted by 
this one-of-a-kind Kentuckian. 
f 
TRIBUTE TO ERIC KING 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President, 
during a year of unprecedented chal-
lenges, students, staff, and faculty at 
the University of Kentucky have been 
fortunate to have Eric King as their 
tireless advocate and supporter. As 
UK’s executive director of federal rela-
tions, Eric has made lasting contribu-
tions to Kentucky’s students, profes-
sors, and administrators. In recogni-
tion of that hard work, Eric was hon-
ored last month by the Association of 
Public and Land-Grant Universities 
with the Jennifer Poulakidas Out-
standing Achievement Award. Today, I, 
too, would like to recognize Eric for his 
strong advocacy on behalf of the Uni-
versity of Kentucky community and 
our State as a whole. 
Eric has been making contributions 
to Kentucky higher education since he 
was an undergrad, serving as the stu-
dent body president of Murray State 
University. Since then, he has dedi-
cated his career to helping Kentuck-
ians. Fresh out of college, Eric served 
as a legislative correspondent in my of-
fice and was later promoted to a legis-
lative assistant focused on energy, ag-
riculture, and environmental policy. 
He contributed to the passage of the 
Agricultural Act of 2014, which deliv-
ered major wins for Kentucky farmers 
and their families. 
Eric also served as the director of 
government and community affairs at 
the Kentucky Association of Electric 
Cooperatives, KAEC. There, he advo-
cated for a statewide association of 24 
consumer-owned electric distribution 
utilities that collectively serve nearly 
2 million Kentuckians. I know that 
Eric’s work at that organization had a 
real and lasting impact on Kentucky 
families. 
Now, Eric has taken his advocacy 
skills to the University of Kentucky, 
working closely with President Eli 
Capilouto to promote the well-being of 
more than 30,000 students, 12,000 staff, 
and 2,000 faculty. When the coronavirus 
pandemic threatened to shut down col-
leges and universities across the coun-
try, Eric stepped up and fought to in-
clude vital funding for higher edu-
cation in the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, 
and Economic Security, CARES, Act. 
Because of advocacy like Eric’s, the 
CARES Act included the Higher Edu-
cation Emergency Relief Fund, pro-
viding millions of dollars to colleges 
and universities to overcome the chal-
lenges imposed by the pandemic. Thou-
sands of Kentucky students and grad-
uates benefited from Eric’s leadership. 
Eric has been described by his col-
leagues as a man with ‘‘unmatched in-
tegrity’’ and a ‘‘can-do attitude’’ who 
has made ‘‘incredible contributions’’ to 
our Nation’s system of public and land- 
grant universities. As Eric’s former 
boss, I can confirm that these super-
latives are correct. His hard work dur-
ing the coronavirus pandemic provided 
vital protection to our colleges and 
universities, both in Kentucky and na-
tionwide. 
Kentuckians—and 
especially 
Wild-
cats—are grateful for Eric’s tireless 
dedication to our State’s public univer-
sity system. On behalf of the Senate, I 
would like to express my congratula-
tions to Eric for receiving this award 
and my thanks for his service and lead-
ership amid a time of incredible hard-
ship.

U.S. INNOVATION AND 
COMPETITION ACT 
Mr. 
WICKER. 
Madam 
President, 
today, the Senate passed the U.S. Inno-
vation and Competition Act—USICA— 
legislation which would establish a new 
Technology and Innovation Directorate 
at the National Science Foundation. 
Section 2005 of USICA would define 10 
initial key technology focus areas to 
direct research at the new Directorate 
and the Department of Energy. One of 
these areas is advanced energy tech-
nology. I want to put in the record that 
Congress has previously enacted legis-
lation defining advanced energy tech-
nology in 42 USC 18632, and that defini-
tion should apply here.

HONORING TROOPER JOHN 
MARTIN HARRIS 
Mrs. HYDE-SMITH. Madam Presi-
dent, I rise to pay tribute to Mis-
sissippi Highway Patrol Trooper John 
Martin Harris, who was killed in the 
line of duty on May 28, 2021. Harris was 
conducting a routine traffic stop on 
Highway 16 in Madison County when a 
vehicle struck and killed him. I honor 
Trooper Harris’ service, extend my 
deepest condolences to his family, and 
reiterate my unwavering support for 
our law enforcement personnel. 
A Clarksdale native, Harris knew 
from a young age he wanted to serve 
his community as a law enforcement 
officer. Trooper Harris began his law 
enforcement career in 1997 in Webb, 
MS. He earned his first Law Enforce-
ment Purple Heart while serving on the 
police force in Friars Point and earned 
a second Purple Heart while serving at 
the Madison County Sheriff’s Office. 
Harris then continued his career at the 
Richland Police Department. In 2018, 
Harris achieved his lifelong dream of 
becoming a Mississippi Highway Pa-
trolman and graduated from Trooper 
School as part of Cadet Class No. 62. In 
addition to the Purple Heart medals, 
Harris received dozens of awards, too 
numerous to mention here, for valor 
and bravery. Several were commenda-
tions for his work on narcotics teams 
and with K–9 units. 
Trooper Harris is survived by his wife 
Katie Parker Harris of Madison, his 
two children Parker and Cooper, and 
his parents Jean and Jimmy Harris of 
Clarksdale. I send my deepest sym-
pathies to his family and to all who 
knew him. May God grant them com-
fort, grace, and peace in these unspeak-
ably difficult times. 
Law enforcement officers across our 
Nation face many challenges in their 
mission to protect and serve. Trooper 
Harris’s death shows us that our law 
enforcement officers face tremendous 
danger to ensure public safety, and I 
greatly 
admire 
those 
who 
remain 
steadfast amiss the dangers of their 
noble profession. Let us commemorate 
Trooper Harris’s life by redoubling our 
commitment to support and advocate 
for those in law enforcement. I will 
continue to honor the legacy of Troop-
er Harris and all of those officers who 
have lost their life in the line of duty 
by doing all I can to support our law 
enforcement officers.

50TH 
ANNIVERSARY 
OF 
THE 
NATRONA 
COUNTY 
MEALS 
ON 
WHEELS 
Mr. BARRASSO. Madam President, I 
rise today to recognize a significant 
anniversary for the Natrona County 
Meals on Wheels Program. On Satur-
day, June 19, 2021, this wonderful orga-
nization will celebrate its 50th anniver-
sary. 
Meals on Wheels is dedicated to pro-
viding healthy meals, a friendly smile, 
and a watchful eye to seniors across 
the Nation. As a doctor, I understand 
the importance of balanced nutrition 
but also companionship and care. The 
hard-working employees and volun-
teers deliver all three by offering tai-
lored meals and home visits. 
In 1971 Casper resident Mabel Marvel 
founded the Casper branch of Meals on 
Wheels. Mabel was on a trip to Colo-
rado to visit family when she ran 
across a similar service. The volunteers 
for the Colorado organization were de-
livering hot meals to elderly residents 
from a church kitchen. Mrs. Marvel re-
alized that Casper did not have such a 
program. Soon after, she formed an of-
fice in a Salvation Army coat closet 
and requested that the Natrona County 
Memorial Hospital, now Wyoming Med-
ical Center, aid in providing meals. 
This was the beginning of the Natrona 
County Meals on Wheels Program. 
When 
Natrona 
County 
Meals 
on 
Wheels began initial operations, they 
were preparing 20 meals a day. By 2001, 
the number of meals delivered in-
creased to over 500 per day. When the 
coronavirus pandemic hit, the need for 
home-delivered meals exploded. This 
Casper-based organization rose to the 
challenge and served clients who were 
forced to quarantine and unable to 
leave their homes. In Natrona County, 
they delivered over 650 meals each 
Monday through Thursday and an aver-
age of 1,550 meals on Fridays to cover 
the weekends. Their hard work re-
sulted in senior citizens in Natrona 
County receiving nearly 207,000 meals 
in 2020. 
Serving so many people at once is 
challenging, especially when many of 
these meals are prepared with special 
dietary needs in mind. Meals on Wheels 
prepares healthy food for community 
members requiring specific diets in-
cluding diabetic, celiac, and vege-
tarian. The volunteers with Meals on 
Wheels also make home visits to check 
in with members of the community 
who may not have enough social inter-
action or are not as mobile. The giving 
nature of this organization presents its 
members with a balanced meal and 
quality time spent with others. Ensur-
ing the needs of community members 
allows seniors to preserve their inde-
pendence at home. 
Meals on Wheels continues to find 
new ways to enrich our community. 
Jamie Loveall has been leading the 
charge as the Executive Director of 
Natrona County Meals on Wheels for 
more than 17 years. She has written 
grants, planned community events, and 
helped prepare meals in order to keep 
clients fed, staff members engaged, and 
the community aware. A favorite com-
munity event is their Bubbles, Baubles 
’n Beans fundraiser. It is a chili and 
soup tasting experience to raise money 
for annual operating costs. 
The strength of an organization is de-
termined by the dedication of its lead-
ership, staff, and volunteers. The full- 
time staff are responsible for preparing 
the meals, managing the financial as-
pects, and writing the delivery routes. 
In 
addition 
to 
Executive 
Director 
Jamie 
Loveall, 
staff 
members 
are 
Katrina Lorenzen, Foundation Devel-
opment Director, Andrea Trout, Route 
Coordinator/Administrative Assistant, 
Debbie Cardinal, Receptionist/Volun-
teer Coordinator, Ashley Woodward, 
Client Services Coordinator, Mariah 
Bokhari, 
Bookkeeper, 
and 
Shelley 
Blake, Kitchen Manager. 
Current board members are Jim 
Browlee, President, Joe Moss, Vice 
President, Vickie Ujvary, Treasurer, 
Don Smith, Secretary, and members 
Wendy 
Elmer, 
Bob 
Thunselle, 
Ed 
Chase, Jennifer Deurloo, Peggy Porter, 
Kelli Carmichael, Paul Rhodes, CJ 
Lovato, Dane Grace, and Stacia Hill. 
The volunteers deliver the meals, 
partake in home visits, and spend qual-
ity time with clients. Eighty-five per-
cent 
of 
the 
volunteers 
with 
the 
Natrona County service are seniors 
themselves, using their time to help 
friends and neighbors. About the volun-
teers, Jamie Loveall says, ‘‘Without 
these individuals, our program would 
not exist.’’ 
It is my great honor to celebrate the 
incredible work of this organization. 
Every day, the staff and volunteers of 
Natrona County Meals on Wheels work 
to make our community a better place

TRIBUTE TO COLONEL NATHAN E. 
COOK II 
Mr. 
INHOFE. 
Madam 
President, 
today I honor a superb leader, liaison, 
and soldier for his tireless commitment 
to the U.S. Army, which includes 2 
years of service with the Army Office 
of the Legislative Liaison, as the chief 
of the Army’s Senate Liaison Division. 
As COL Nathan E. Cook II prepares to 
retire after 28 years of dedicated and 
distinguished service to our Nation, I 
believe it is fitting to recognize his ex-
ceptional service and relationship with 
this Chamber. 
Colonel Cook’s congressional liaison 
assignment is only the capstone to 
what has been an outstanding career of 
service to the Army and our Nation. 
Colonel Cook is a 1993 graduate of The 
United States Military Academy at 
West Point. He was commissioned into 
the Army as a field artillery officer and 
has served in command and staff posi-
tions from the tactical to the strategic 
level in the 2d Armored Division, 4th 
Infantry Division, 8th Army, 3d Infan-
try Division, 1st Cavalry Division, 
Headquarters Resolute Support, and 
Headquarters Department of the Army. 
He has led our Nation’s soldiers during 
multiple combat tours in Iraq and Af-
ghanistan during OPERATION IRAQI 
FREEDOM, OPERATION NEW DAWN, 
and OPERATION RESOLUTE SUP-
PORT. Likewise, he commanded our 
soldiers in combat as the commander 
of the 3d Battalion, 82d Field Artillery 
Regiment from Fort Hood, TX, and the 
75th Field Artillery Brigade from Fort 
Sill, OK. Prior to his assignment as the 
chief of the Army’s Senate Liaison Di-
vision, he served as the senior advisor 
to the Afghan Minister of Defense, 
where he provided timely and critical 
advice across the Ministry of Defense 
and the NATO coalition. The Army has 
continuously relied upon Colonel Cook 
for his exceptional leadership and un-
paralleled work ethic throughout his 
career. 
Over the course of the last few years, 
Colonel Cook’s tireless efforts proved 
invaluable in broadening the under-
standing of Members and staff on Army 
priorities, policies, and initiatives that 
ultimately provided resources and au-
thorities for the Army and enhanced 
trust and confidence across the Senate. 
He managed all of this while leading 
and managing numerous congressional 
delegations to various locations around 
the world. Colonel Cook has become a 
trusted adviser and friend to many of 
us, distinguishing himself by continu-
ously going above and beyond the call 
of duty to serve the needs of Congress. 
This 
Chamber 
will 
feel 
Colonel 
Cook’s absence. I join many past and 
present Members of Congress in my 
gratitude and appreciation to Colonel 
Cook for his outstanding leadership 
and unwavering support. There is no 
doubt that the strength of our soldiers 
comes from their families. Colonel 
Cook’s strength comes from his wife 
Traci and his two sons, Nathan and 
Joshua. This Nation is grateful for 
their commitment and personal sac-
rifices made throughout Colonel Cook’s 
career. 
On behalf of the U.S. Senate and the 
United States of America, I commend 
Colonel Cook for his tireless efforts in 
the support of our Army, our military, 
and our Nation. As Nate and his family 
transition from the military, I con-
gratulate him on completing an ex-
tremely successful military career and 
wish all of them the best in all their fu-
ture endeavors.

TRIBUTE TO ZACHARY ZAMPELLA 
Mr. RUBIO. Madam President, I rec-
ognize Zachary Daniel Zampella, who, 
after 12 years of serving the people of 
Florida in the U.S. Senate, has moved 
on to new opportunities. I thank him 
for his years of hard work with my of-
fice. 
Zach began his time with my office 
as a caseworker specializing in mili-
tary 
and 
veterans 
administration 
issues before becoming my regional di-
rector for Southwest Florida in 2012. 
He returned to my Orlando office in 
2015, serving as deputy director of con-
stituent services. 
During his time with my office, Zach 
mentored several of my staffers, played 
a key role in my Constituent Services 
Department and disaster relief efforts, 
and drafted office correspondence. He 
also assisted veterans with their issues 
pertaining to the Department of Vet-
eran Affairs and worked with other 
various Federal, State, and local gov-
ernment agencies. 
In 2017, he assisted residents affected 
by Hurricane Irma, working our Recov-
ery Assistance Center events held in 
the hardest hit cities across Florida. In 
2018 and 2019, he made several trips to 
the panhandle region after Hurricane 
Michael’s devastation. He walked door- 
to-door to assist constituents and pro-
vided valuable assistance in the region. 
Zach grew up in Orlando, FL, grad-
uating with his bachelor’s degree in 
history and master’s degree in business 
administration from Southeastern Uni-
versity in Lakeland, FL. After gradua-
tion, he interned for Senator Mel Mar-
tinez, later joining his staff in 2008. He 
also 
worked 
for 
Senator 
George 
LeMieux before joining my staff in 
2011. 
Zach’s work for my constituents for 
my office made a real difference over 
the years. I am grateful for his dedi-
cated service to the people of Florida 
and extend my best wishes to Zach on 
his future endeavors.

ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS 
RECOGNIZING RUPE’S BURGERS 
∑ Mr. RISCH. Madam President, as a 
senior member and former chairman of 
the Senate Committee on Small Busi-
ness and Entrepreneurship, each month 
I recognize and celebrate the American 
entrepreneurial spirit by highlighting 
the success of a small business in my 
home State of Idaho. Today I am 
pleased to honor Rupe’s Burgers in 
Blackfoot, which will celebrate its 34th 
anniversary this month, as the Idaho 
Small Business of the Month for June 
2021. 
Rupe’s Burgers is an American-style 
diner and drive-in known for its qual-
ity food and strong community founda-
tion. In 1962, former owner Vaughn 
Rupe opened an A&W Restaurant and 
after years of success made the deci-
sion to sell the restaurant in 1978. In 
1987, Vaughn’s son Kevin purchased the 
property and renamed the restaurant 
‘‘Rupe’s Burgers.’’ 
Rupe’s Burgers prides itself on its 
dedication to community service. The 
Rupe family donates and volunteers for 
local philanthropic missions, such as 
the Santa’s Helpers Program, a holiday 
drive organized by Bingham County 
emergency responders to provide gifts 
to economically disadvantaged chil-
dren. The restaurant has also donated 
to local organizations that promote the 
success and leadership of women, such 
as 
Blackfoot 
Distinguished 
Young 
Women and Soroptimists. In addition 
to its philanthropic efforts, the Rupe 
family puts a premium on serving and 
celebrating the Blackfoot community, 
featuring 
memorabilia 
from 
local 
school sports teams and providing 
nearly 50 jobs to the local community. 
Congratulations to Kevin and all of 
the employees of Rupe’s Burgers on 
being selected as the Idaho Small Busi-
ness of the Month for June 2021, and 
congratulations on 34 years in busi-
ness. You make our great State proud, 
and I look forward to your continued 
growth and success.∑

STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED 
BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS 
By Mr. PADILLA (for himself, 
Mrs. GILLIBRAND, Mr. VAN HOL-
LEN, 
Ms. 
WARREN, 
Mr. 
MERKLEY, Mr. BOOKER, Mrs. 
FEINSTEIN, Mr. MARKEY, Mr. 
SCHUMER, Ms. STABENOW, Mr. 
SANDERS, 
Mr. 
DURBIN, 
Mrs. 
SHAHEEN, Mr. PETERS, and Ms. 
HASSAN): 
S. 1970. A bill to require the Sec-
retary of Defense to conduct testing for 
and remediation of perfluoroalkyl sub-
stances and polyfluoroalkyl substances 
at or surrounding installations of the 
Department of Defense located in the 
United States, formerly used defense 
sites, and State-owned facilities of the 
National Guard, and for other pur-
poses; to the Committee on Armed 
Services. 
Mr. PADILLA. Mr. President, I rise 
to introduce the ‘‘Clean Water For 
Military Families Act.’’ This legisla-
tion would provide $10 billion for the 
Department of Defense to conduct in-
vestigations and remediate PFAS con-
tamination at and surrounding DOD in-
stallations in the U.S. and state-owned 
National Guard facilities. 
Dating back to the 1960s, the U.S. 
Navy began using a firefighting foam 
called 
aqueous 
film-forming 
foam 
(AFFF) that contains toxic PFAS 
chemicals. The military used AFFF 
firefighting foam for emergencies, fire 
training exercises, and equipment test-
ing, resulting in large discharges of 
PFAS contamination in groundwater 
and other environments. 
For decades, DOD continued using 
AFFF firefighting foam despite mount-
ing evidence of detrimental health con-
cerns, and even after leading manufac-
turers voluntarily phased out produc-
tion of PFOS and PFOA, the two most 
widespread and studied PFAS com-
pounds. 
In recent years, Congress has passed 
legislation requiring DOD to phase out 
the use of AFFF firefighting foams. 
While this is a vital step toward ensur-
ing DOD adopts PFAS-free alternatives 
going forward, it does not address 
DOD’s legacy pollution. 
To clean up the legacy pollution at 
contaminated military sites across the 
country, this legislation authorizes a 
one-time, $10 billion investment for 
PFAS investigations and cleanup. We 
owe it to military communities to en-
sure that they can drink clean water 
and live pollution-free. 
There are hundreds of contaminated 
military sites across the country that 
jeopardize the health, safety, and well- 
being of military communities who 
have suffered from exposure to PFAS 
pollution and toxic drinking water. 
In California alone, there are 62 mili-
tary facilities with a known or sus-
pected PFAS release. 
Since the discovery of PFAS at these 
installations, there has been little to 
no progress on the bases with the high-
est PFAS detections. A $10 billion in-
vestment would accelerate DOD’s ex-
isting cleanup efforts and cover all 
types of PFAS chemicals. Absent this 
legislation, it could take decades for 
DOD to clean up toxic PFAS. We must 
act now to move beyond studying the 
problem and toward a comprehensive 
cleanup effort to protect service-mem-
bers, veterans, and military commu-
nities. 
I thank my co-lead, Senator GILLI-
BRAND for her tireless leadership fight-
ing PFAS contamination at DOD sites. 
I also thank the bill’s cosponsors for 
championing this effort with me in the 
Senate. 
I look forward to working with my 
colleagues to enact the ‘‘Clean Water 
for Military Families Act’’ as quickly 
as possible. 
Thank you, Mr. President, I yield the 
floor. 
SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS 
SENATE RESOLUTION 259—REMEM-
BERING THE VICTIMS OF THE 
1989 TIANANMEN SQUARE MAS-
SACRE AND CONDEMNING THE 
CONTINUED AND INTENSIFYING 
CRACKDOWN ON HUMAN RIGHTS 
AND BASIC FREEDOMS WITHIN 
THE 
PEOPLE’S 
REPUBLIC 
OF 
CHINA, 
INCLUDING 
THE 
HONG 
KONG SPECIAL ADMINISTRATIVE 
REGION, BY THE CHINESE COM-
MUNITY 
PARTY, 
AND 
FOR 
OTHER PURPOSES 
Mr. MARKEY (for himself and Mr. 
ROMNEY) submitted the following reso-
lution; which was referred to the Com-
mittee on Foreign Relations: 
S. RES. 259 
Whereas, on April 15, 1989, peaceful dem-
onstrators gathered in Tiananmen Square in 
central Beijing to mourn the death of former 
General Secretary of the Chinese Communist 
Party (CCP) Hu Yaobang, who was compelled 
to resign in 1987 for expressing support of 
students demanding political reform; 
Whereas, throughout April and May 1989, 
peaceful 
demonstrations 
continued 
in 
Tiananmen Square and in an estimated 400 
cities across China; 
Whereas, by May 17, 1989, an estimated 
1,000,000 Chinese citizens from all walks of 
life, including students, government employ-
ees, journalists, workers, police officers, and 
members of the armed forces, gathered 
peacefully in Tiananmen Square to call for 
democratic reforms; 
Whereas the peaceful demonstrators of 1989 
called upon the Government of the People’s 
Republic of China (PRC) to eliminate corrup-
tion, accelerate economic and political re-
form, and protect human rights, particularly 
the freedoms of expression and assembly; 
Whereas, on May 20, 1989, the Government 
of the PRC declared martial law; 
Whereas, during the late afternoon and 
early evening hours of June 3, 1989, the CCP 
leadership sent armed People’s Liberation 
Army (PLA) troops and tanks into Beijing 
and surrounding streets; 
Whereas, on the night of June 3, 1989, and 
continuing into the morning of June 4, 1989, 
PLA soldiers, at the direction of CCP leader-
ship, fired indiscriminately into crowds of 
peaceful protestors, killing and injuring 
thousands of demonstrators and other un-
armed civilians; 
Whereas the Government of the PRC con-
tinues to censor any mention of the crack-
down centered on Tiananmen Square, pre-
vent 
the 
victims 
from 
being 
publicly 
mourned and remembered, and harass, de-
tain, and arrest those who call for a full, 
public, and independent accounting of the 
wounded, dead, and those imprisoned for par-
ticipating in the spring 1989 demonstrations; 
Whereas the sovereignty of Hong Kong 
transferred from the United Kingdom to the 
PRC in 1997 under the terms of the Joint 
Declaration of the Government of the United 
Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ire-
land and the Government of the People’s Re-
public of China on the Question of Hong 
Kong (in this resolution referred to as the 
‘‘Joint Declaration’’), which guaranteed that 
the Hong Kong Special Administrative Re-
gion (HKSAR) will ‘‘enjoy a high degree of 
autonomy’’ and committed the PRC to keep 
the ‘‘social and economic systems in Hong 
Kong’’ unchanged through 2047; 
Whereas the Joint Declaration states that

the person, of speech, of the press, of assem-
bly, of association, of travel, of movement, 
of correspondence, of strike, of choice of oc-
cupation, of academic research and of reli-
gious belief will be ensured by law in the 
Hong Kong Special Administrative Region’’ 
and that those rights are reiterated in chap-
ter III of the Basic Law of the Hong Kong 
Special Administrative Region of the Peo-
ple’s Republic of China; 
Whereas the people of Hong Kong have held 
an annual Tiananmen Square vigil since 1990, 
which has been the only such mass gathering 
on Chinese territory because commemora-
tions are banned in mainland China; 
Whereas, on June 4, 2020, thousands of peo-
ple in Hong Kong defied a ban by the Hong 
Kong Police Force and gathered at the city’s 
annual June 4 vigil to memorialize the 31st 
anniversary of the Tiananmen Square mas-
sacre; 
Whereas, on June 30, 2020, China’s National 
People’s Congress Standing Committee fla-
grantly undermined the high degree of au-
tonomy guaranteed to Hong Kong in the 
Joint Declaration and Basic Law by passing 
and imposing upon Hong Kong the oppressive 
and intentionally vague Law of the People’s 
Republic of China on Safeguarding National 
Security in the Hong Kong Special Adminis-
trative Region (the ‘‘national security law’’); 
Whereas the central Government of PRC 
and the Hong Kong Special Administrative 
Region (HKSAR) government have since used 
the national security law to suppress demo-
cratic voices in Hong Kong, including by bar-
ring candidates from standing for election 
and by arresting pro-democracy activists and 
opposition leaders; 
Whereas, on March 11, 2021, China’s Na-
tional People’s Congress adopted the ‘‘Deci-
sion of the National People’s Congress on 
Improving the Electoral System of the Hong 
Kong Special Administrative Region’’, there-
by further restricting Hong Kong’s electoral 
freedom and democratic representation; 
Whereas, on May 6, 2021, a Hong Kong 
judge sentenced several Hong Kong pro-de-
mocracy activists to between 4 and 10 
months in jail for participating in the unau-
thorized Tiananmen Square vigil in June 
2020; 
Whereas, on May 27, 2021, the Hong Kong 
Police Force officially banned the June 4 
vigil for the second consecutive year, citing 
a ban on large gatherings in light of the 
Coronavirus Disease 2019 pandemic; 
Whereas, on May 27, 2021, the Hong Kong 
Legislative 
Council 
passed 
legislation 
amending local election laws to bring them 
in line with the China’s National People’s 
Congress’ March 11, 2021, ‘‘Decision of the 
National People’s Congress on Improving the 
Electoral System of the Hong Kong Special 
Administrative Region’’; 
Whereas June 4, 2021, marks the 32nd anni-
versary of the Tiananmen Square massacre; 
Whereas the Government of the PRC has 
committed genocide and crimes against hu-
manity against the predominantly Muslim 
Uyghurs and other ethnic and religious mi-
nority groups in Xinjiang; and 
Whereas the Government of the PRC con-
tinues to violate the human rights of pro-de-
mocracy activists, members of ethnic mi-
norities, including individuals in the Tibetan 
regions, religious believers, human rights 
lawyers, citizen journalists, and labor union 
leaders, among many others seeking to ex-
press their political or religious views or eth-

BERING THE 32ND ANNIVERSARY 
OF THE VIOLENT REPRESSION 
OF PEACEFUL PROTESTS CEN-

SQUARE AND EXPRESSING THE 
SENSE 
OF 
THE

OF 
CHINA’S 
ONGOING 
DENIAL 
OF 
BASIC 
RIGHTS 
AND 
FUNDA-
MENTAL FREEDOMS 
Mr. RUBIO (for himself and Mr. 
MERKLEY) submitted the following res-
olution; which was referred to the 
Committee on Foreign Relations: 
S. RES. 260 
Whereas, during the spring of 1989, an esti-
mated 1,000,000 people engaged in Tiananmen 
Square protests and staged similar protests 
in over 400 Chinese cities, including among 
many others, students, workers, academics, 
journalists and government employees; 
Whereas the peaceful demonstrations of 
1989 called upon the Government of the Peo-
ple’s Republic of China (‘‘China’’) to elimi-
nate corruption, accelerate economic and po-
litical reform, and protect human rights, 
particularly the freedoms of expression and 
assembly, issues that have become more 
acute in United States-China relations 32 
years later; 
Whereas, on June 4, 1989, troops of the Peo-
ple’s Liberation Army, at the behest of Chi-
nese Communist Party leadership, attacked 
Tiananmen Square to repress demonstrators, 
crushing defenseless protestors with tanks 
and firing on them indiscriminately, killing 
hundreds or possibly thousands of individ-
uals; 
Whereas, since June 4, 1989, the Govern-
ment of China censors any mention of the 
Tiananmen Square Massacre, even the date 
it occurred, and imprisons and harasses its 
own citizens who attempt to discuss or 
peacefully commemorate Tiananmen Square 
protests and their violent suppression; 
Whereas the Tiananmen Mothers—a group 
in China composed of parents and family 
members of individuals killed on or around 
June 4, 1989—have annually called upon the 
Government of China to reveal the full truth 
of what transpired, and some members of 
this group have passed away without obtain-
ing justice and accountability for their fam-
ily members who were killed in 1989; 
Whereas people of mainland China and 
Macau are again barred this year from com-
memorating the lives lost and the legacy of 
the 1989 massacre, and the Government of 
the Hong Kong Special Administrative Re-
gion of the People’s Republic of China 
(‘‘Hong Kong’’) is using pandemic restric-
tions as a pretext for denying the vigil orga-
nizers a permit to gather; 
Whereas the Government of China con-
tinues 
to 
view 
the 
demands 
of 
the 
Tiananmen protesters, including democracy, 
transparency, rights protections, and free-
dom of speech, as threats to the legitimacy 
of the Chinese Communist Party’s hold on 
political power; 
Whereas the 32nd anniversary of the 
Tiananmen Square massacre is a poignant 
milestone, particularly as the autonomy of 
Hong Kong and freedoms guaranteed to the 
people of Hong Kong have been crushed by 
the Government of China’s imposition of the 
Law of the People’s Republic of China on 
Safeguarding National Security in the Hong 
Kong Special Administrative Region on June 
30, 2020; 
Whereas the people of Hong Kong have 
peacefully commemorated the Tiananmen 
massacre each year faithfully in large num-
bers; 
Whereas, starting in 2020, the Hong Kong 
Police Force has blocked the annual candle-
light vigil to commemorate Tiananmen; 
Whereas Hong Kong’s autonomy and free-
doms have been blatantly denied by the ac-
tions of the Government of Hong Kong and 
the Government of China, particularly over 
the past several years, with disqualifications 
of elected members of Hong Kong’s Legisla-
tive Council, blocking citizens from running 
for office, failing to address the petitions of 
the Hong Kong people, banning a political 
party advocating Hong Kong independence, 
failing to address excessive use of force by 
police, and criminalizing peaceful political 
activities 
through 
the 
use 
of 
spurious 
charges of ‘‘subversion,’’ ‘‘collusion with a

foreign country or with external elements,’’ 
and ‘‘secession’’; 
Whereas reforms to Hong Kong’s legisla-
tive council ended any semblance of elec-
toral democracy in Hong Kong by requiring 
the nomination of candidates by the Election 
Committee, which previously only elected 
the Chief Executive, reducing the number of 
directly elected seats from 35 to 20, and re-
quires vetting by a screening committee of 
the ‘‘patriotism’’ of any candidate, defined 
as allegiance to the Government of Hong 
Kong and the Government of China and often 
interpreted as support for the Chinese Com-
munist Party; 
Whereas the political turmoil in Hong 
Kong is the result of actions of the Govern-
ment of Hong Kong and the Government of 
China, including the arbitrary arrests and 
sentencing of peaceful protesters, including 
well-known democracy advocates such as 
Joshua Wong, Martin Lee, Jimmy Lai, Lee 
Cheuk Yan, Margaret Ng, Albert Ho, Leung 
Kwok-hung, Au Nok-hin, Figo Chan, and oth-
ers; 
Whereas, on May 6, 2021, four Hong Kong 
pro-democracy activists — Joshua Wong, 
Lester Shum, Tiffany Yuen, and Jannelle 
Leung — were sentenced to lengthy prison 
terms 
for 
participating 
in 
last 
year’s 
Tiananmen Square vigil; 
Whereas the arbitrary arrests of Hong 
Kong residents for participating in peaceful 
rallies and vigils, which is a violation of the 
rights guaranteed to the residents of Hong 
Kong by the International Covenant on Civil 
and Political Rights and the Joint Declara-
tion of the Government of the United King-
dom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland 
and the Government of the People’s Republic 
of China on the Question of Hong Kong, done 
at Beijing on December 19, 1984 (the ‘‘Sino- 
British Declaration’’), should be considered 
by the international community to be the 
arbitrary detention of political prisoners for 
the purposes of applying sanctions under the 
Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy 
Act of 2019 (Public Law 116–76) and the Hong 
Kong Autonomy Act (Public Law 116–149); 
Whereas China’s National People’s Con-
gress has imposed national security legisla-
tion with respect to Hong Kong in con-
travention of the procedures outlined in the 
Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special Admin-
istrative Region of the People’s Republic of 
China (the ‘‘Basic Law’’); 
Whereas that legislation has nullified the 
independence of Hong Kong’s judiciary and 
its tradition of rule of law by suspending due 
process and trial by jury for cases deemed 
issues of national security; 
Whereas the implementation of that legis-
lation has effectively destroyed Hong Kong’s 
autonomy in direct violation of the Sino- 
British Declaration; 
Whereas the National Security Law is in 
direct conflict with the rights guaranteed to 
the people of Hong Kong by virtue of the 
International Covenant on Civil and Polit-
ical Rights, to which Hong Kong is made 
subject by way of the Basic Law; 
Whereas the United States Department of 
State, pursuant to the United States-Hong 
Kong Policy Act of 1992 (Public Law 102–383) 
and the Hong Kong Human Rights and De-
mocracy Act of 2019 (Public Law 116–76), de-
termined that Hong Kong no longer mani-
fests a ‘‘high degree of autonomy’’ distinct 
from mainland China; 
Whereas vague national security laws are 
used widely in mainland China to imprison 
or arbitrarily detain dissidents, rights de-
fenders, civil society advocates, religious 
leaders and adherents, former party mem-
bers, and persons from ethnic groups whose 
religious freedom, linguistic rights, and po-
litical expression are heavily restricted by 
Chinese authorities; 
Whereas human rights, democracy, and re-
ligious freedom advocates continue to be im-
prisoned, arbitrarily detained, disappeared 
and held incommunicado in undisclosed loca-
tions, and abducted across international bor-
ders under vague national security laws and 
other criminal charges in mainland China, 
including Gao Zhisheng, Gui Minhai, Xing 
Wangli, 
Jiang 
Tianyong, 
Wu 
Gan, 
Qin 
Yongmin, Zhou Shifeng, Yu Wensheng, Wang 
Yi, and Nobel laureate Liu Xiaobo, who died 
in state custody nearly four years ago; 
Whereas the Chinese Communist Party and 
the Government of China used the tools of 
state power to silence whistleblowers at the 
onset of the COVID–19 pandemic, including 
doctors such as the late Li Wenliang, jour-
nalists, lawyers, scientists, and concerned 
citizens, and has subsequently imprisoned 
some of these individuals, including Zhang 
Zhan, who was sentenced to four years in 
prison on account of her whistleblowing ac-
tivity, and Chen Zhaozhi, who has been de-
tained for over a year on account of COVID– 
19 related social media posts; 
Whereas the United States Congress, par-
ticularly in recent years, has passed numer-
ous measures articulating the longstanding 
and bipartisan commitment to human rights 
in China, including— 
(A) the Global Magnitsky Human Rights 
Accountability Act (subtitle F of title XII 
of Public Law 114–328; 22 U.S.C. 2656 note); 
(B) the North Korean Human Rights Re-
authorization Act of 2017 (Public Law 115– 
198); 
(C) the Reciprocal Access to Tibet Act of 
2018 (Public Law 115–330); 
(D) the Hong Kong Human Rights and 
Democracy Act of 2019 (Public Law 116–76); 
(E) the Hong Kong Autonomy Act of 2019 
(Public 116–149); 
(F) the Uyghur Human Rights Policy Act 
(Public 116–145); and 
(G) the Tibetan Policy and Support Act 
of 2020 (Public Law 116–260); 
Whereas, on this day, we stand in soli-
darity with Chinese human rights lawyers, 
labor and free speech advocates, Christians 
and other religious groups, and those dis-
tinct ethnic groups who face persecution, 
such as Tibetans, who continue to face se-
vere restrictions and a concerted state effort 
to erase Tibetan Buddhism, the Tibetan lan-
guage, and Tibetan traditional culture; 
Whereas, on this day, we condemn the on-
going campaign of genocide and crimes 
against humanity committed by the Chinese 
Communist Party and the Government of 
China against Uyghurs as well as other Mus-
lim ethnic groups who live in the Xinjiang 
Uyghur Autonomous Region, more than 
1,000,000 of whom have been forced into mass 
internment camps, suffering a range of 
human rights abuses including being tor-
tured, sexually assaulted, forced to renounce 
their religion and pledge allegiance to the 
Government of China, coerced into state-run 
programs of forced labor, separated from 
their families, and forced to undergo abor-
tion and sterilization procedures; and 
Whereas, on this day, we remember the 
words of the late Nobel Laureate Liu Xiaobo, 
who said there is ‘‘no force that can put an 
end to the human quest for freedom, and 
China will in the end become a nation ruled 
by law, where human rights reign supreme’’: 
Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) commemorates the Tiananmen protests 
and their violent suppression until such time 
as citizens of China are able to do so freely 
and publicly everywhere across their coun-
try; 
(2) expresses sympathy to the families of 
those killed, tortured, imprisoned, or exiled 
for their participation in the pro-democracy 
demonstrations during the spring of 1989; 
(3) calls on the Government of China to 
allow those Tiananmen demonstration par-
ticipants currently living in exile in the 
United States and other countries to return 
to China without risk of repercussions or 
retribution to themselves, their families, or 
their allies; 
(4) condemns the use of violence, torture, 
harassment, and arbitrary detention as a 
means to repress the legitimate aspirations 
of the people of China to speak and associate 
freely, including to petition the government 
and challenge the policies and ideology of 
the Chinese Communist Party; 
(5) calls on the Government of China to re-
lease all prisoners of conscience, including 
prisoners detained because of their participa-
tion in Tiananmen Square commemorations 
or actions calling for the type of political re-
forms and rights protections pursued by 
those who gathered in Tiananmen Square in 
1989 and including over one million Uyghurs 
and other predominantly Muslim ethnic mi-
norities in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous 
Region; 
(6) condemns the forced imposition of na-
tional security legislation with respect to 
Hong Kong; 
(7) calls upon the President to continue to 
use existing authorities to hold accountable 
Hong Kong officials, including Hong Kong 
Chief Executive Carrie Lam, and Govern-
ment of China officials for crushing Hong 
Kong’s autonomy and guaranteed rights; and 
(8) calls upon the President to build an 
international coalition to demand that the 
Government of China adhere to its inter-
national agreements and human rights obli-
gations.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S3992 
June 8, 2021 
Whereas the coronavirus disease 2019 (re-
ferred to in this preamble as ‘‘COVID–19’’) 
pandemic compounds the systemic inequal-
ity that LGBTQ individuals face in the 
healthcare, employment, and housing sys-
tems in the United States, leading to a dis-
parate impact on LGBTQ individuals; 
Whereas the persistent failure of Federal 
and State officials to collect full and accu-
rate data on sexual orientation and gender 
identity, particularly in the current COVID– 
19 pandemic, causes tremendous harm to 
LGBTQ individuals in the United States, 
who remain largely invisible to the govern-
ment entities entrusted with ensuring their 
health, safety, and well-being; 
Whereas LGBTQ individuals in the United 
States serve on the front lines during the 
COVID–19 pandemic as doctors, nurses, med-
ical professionals, law enforcement officers, 
firefighters, and first responders in all States 
and the District of Columbia; 
Whereas LGBTQ individuals in the United 
States serve, and have served, the United 
States Army, Coast Guard, Navy, Air Force, 
and Marines honorably and with distinction 
and bravery; 
Whereas a decades-long Federal policy, 
known as the ‘‘Lavender Scare’’, threatened 
and intimidated Federal public servants 
from employment due to their sexual ori-
entation, alleging LGBTQ individuals posed 
a threat to national security, preventing 
many more from entering the workforce; 
Whereas an estimated number of more 
than 100,000 brave service members were dis-
charged from the Armed Forces of the 
United States between the beginning of 
World War II and 2011 because of their sexual 
orientation, including the discharge of more 
than 13,000 service members under the 
‘‘Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell’’ policy in place be-
tween 1994 and 2011; 
Whereas LGBTQ individuals in the United 
States serve, and have served, in positions in 
the Federal Government and State and local 
governments, including as members of Con-
gress, Cabinet Secretaries, Governors, may-
ors, and city council members; 
Whereas the demonstrators who protested 
on June 28, 1969, following a law enforcement 
raid of the Stonewall Inn, an LGBTQ club in 
New York City, are pioneers of the LGBTQ 
movement for equality; 
Whereas, throughout much of the history 
of the United States, same-sex relationships 
were criminalized in many States, and many 
LGBTQ individuals in the United States 
were forced to hide their LGBTQ identities 
while living in secrecy and fear; 
Whereas, on June 26, 2015, the Supreme 
Court 
of 
the 
United 
States 
ruled 
in 
Obergefell v. Hodges, 135 S. Ct. 2584, that 
same-sex couples have a constitutional right 
to marry and acknowledged that ‘‘[n]o union 
is more profound than marriage, for it em-
bodies the highest ideals of love, fidelity, de-
votion, sacrifice, and family’’; 
Whereas Acquired Immunodeficiency Syn-
drome (referred to in this preamble as 
‘‘AIDS’’) has disproportionately impacted 
LGBTQ individuals in the United States, due 
in part to a lack of funding and research de-
voted to finding effective treatment for 
AIDS and the Human Immunodeficiency 
Virus (referred to in this preamble as ‘‘HIV’’) 
during the early stages of the HIV and AIDS 
epidemic; 
Whereas 
gay 
and 
bisexual 
men 
and 
transgender women of color have a higher 
risk of contracting HIV; 
Whereas the LGBTQ community has main-
tained its unwavering commitment to ending 
the HIV and AIDS epidemic; 
Whereas LGBTQ individuals in the United 
States 
face 
disparities 
in 
employment, 
healthcare, education, housing, and many 
other areas central to the pursuit of happi-
ness in the United States; 
Whereas 28 States have no explicit ban on 
discrimination based on sexual orientation 
and gender identity in the workplace, hous-
ing, or public accommodations, and 34 States 
have no explicit ban on discrimination 
against LGBTQ individuals in education; 
Whereas LGBTQ youth are at increased 
risk of— 
(1) suicide; 
(2) homelessness; 
(3) becoming victims of bullying, violence, 
or human trafficking; and 
(4) developing mental health illnesses, in-
cluding anxiety and depression; 
Whereas only 13 States and the District of 
Columbia have explicit policies in place to 
protect foster youth from discrimination 
based on both sexual orientation and gender 
identity; 
Whereas LGBTQ youth of color are over-
represented in child welfare and juvenile jus-
tice systems; 
Whereas the LGBTQ community has faced 
discrimination, 
inequality, 
and 
violence 
throughout the history of the United States; 
Whereas State legislatures across the 
country have introduced and passed harmful 
legislation directly targeting LGBTQ youth, 
particularly transgender youth, and their 
ability to participate in athletic activities 
and obtain access to healthcare; 
Whereas LGBTQ individuals in the United 
States, in particular transgender individuals, 
face a disproportionately high risk of becom-
ing victims of violent hate crimes; 
Whereas members of the LGBTQ commu-
nity have been targeted in acts of mass vio-
lence, including— 
(1) the Pulse nightclub shooting in Or-
lando, Florida, on June 12, 2016, where 49 peo-
ple were killed; and 
(2) the arson attack at the UpStairs 
Lounge in New Orleans, Louisiana, on June 
24, 1973, where 32 people died; 
Whereas LGBTQ individuals in the United 
States face persecution, violence, and death 
in many parts of the world, including State- 
sponsored violence; 
Whereas in the several years preceding 
2019, hundreds of LGBTQ individuals around 
the world were arrested and, in some cases, 
tortured or even executed because of their 
actual or perceived sexual orientation or 
gender identity in countries and territories 
such as Chechnya, Egypt, Indonesia, and 
Tanzania; 
Whereas, in May 2019, Taiwan became the 
first place in Asia to extend marriage rights 
to same-sex couples; 
Whereas, since June 2019, Ecuador, North-
ern Ireland, and Costa Rica have extended 
marriage rights to same-sex couples, the 
most recent country-wide extensions of 
those rights in the world; 
Whereas the LGBTQ community holds 
Pride festivals and marches in some of the 
most dangerous places in the world, despite 
threats of violence and arrest; 
Whereas, in 2009, President Barack Obama 
signed the Matthew Shepard and James 
Byrd, Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act (divi-
sion E of Public Law 111–84; 123 Stat. 2835) 
into law to protect all individuals in the 
United States from crimes motivated by 
their actual or perceived sexual orientation 
or gender identity; 
Whereas LGBTQ individuals in the United 
States have fought for equal treatment, dig-
nity, and respect; 
Whereas LGBTQ individuals in the United 
States have achieved significant milestones, 
ensuring that future generations of LGBTQ 
individuals in the United States will enjoy a 
more equal and just society; 
Whereas, 
despite 
being 
marginalized 
throughout the history of the United States, 
LGBTQ individuals in the United States con-
tinue to celebrate their identities, love, and 
contributions to the United States in various 
expressions of Pride; 
Whereas Pride is a celebration of visibility 
in spite of marginalization, and the LGBTQ 
community will continue to observe this sig-
nificant cultural practice even though phys-
ical Pride celebrations may be compromised 
in June 2021 due to the health and safety 
needs of all individuals involved; 
Whereas, in June 2020, the Supreme Court 
of the United States affirmed that existing 
civil rights laws prohibit employment dis-
crimination on the basis of sexual orienta-
tion and gender identity, a landmark victory 
for the LGBTQ community; and 
Whereas LGBTQ individuals in the United 
States remain determined to pursue full 
equality, respect, and inclusion for all indi-
viduals regardless of sexual orientation or 
gender identity: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) supports the rights, freedoms, and equal 
treatment 
of 
lesbian, 
gay, 
bisexual, 
transgender, and queer (referred to in this 
resolution as ‘‘LGBTQ’’) individuals in the 
United States and around the world; 
(2) acknowledges that LGBTQ rights are 
human rights that are to be protected by the 
laws of the United States and numerous 
international treaties and conventions; 
(3) supports efforts to ensure the equal 
treatment of all individuals in the United 
States, regardless of sexual orientation and 
gender identity; 
(4) supports efforts to ensure that the 
United States remains a beacon of hope for 
the equal treatment of individuals around 
the world, including LGBTQ individuals; and 
(5) encourages the celebration of June as 
‘‘LGBTQ Pride Month’’ in order to provide a 
lasting opportunity for all individuals in the 
United States— 
(A) to learn about the discrimination and 
inequality that the LGBTQ community en-
dured, and continues to endure; and 
(B) to celebrate the contributions of the 
LGBTQ community throughout the history 
of the United States.

f 
U.S. SUPREME COURT 
Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Madam Presi-
dent, in my opening speech about the 
rightwing scheme to capture the Court, 
the Supreme Court, I described the se-
cret strategy memo that Lewis Powell 
wrote on the eve of his appointment to 
the Court about how to deploy cor-
porate political power. 
As a Justice of the Supreme Court, 
Powell had the chance to prove to the 
corporate world his secret memo’s the-
ory of what could be achieved by ‘‘ex-
ploiting judicial action’’—his phrase— 
particularly with, as he called it, ‘‘an 
activist-minded Supreme Court.’’ 
Second, Powell had the chance on the 
Court to start laying the legal ground-
work for precisely the sort of corporate 
political activity that his secret memo 
had recommended to the U.S. Chamber 
of Commerce, and Powell did both. 
The first case that allowed Powell to 
implement recommendations from his 
secret report came in 1976, in a case 
about the Federal Election Campaign 
Act. The case was Buckley v. Valeo, 
and the decision was a beast—138 
pages, with another 83 pages of dissent 
and concurrence cobbled together by 
the Court with what one observer 
called ‘‘extraordinary speed.’’ Five Jus-
tices in that case, including Powell, 
were described as First Amendment 
hawks who were wary of any portion of 
the Federal Election Campaign Act 
that could inhibit free speech and asso-
ciation. 
Now, you have to understand that 
free speech and association were buzz 
words for corporate political activity 
precisely of the sort championed in 
Powell’s secret chamber memo. Free 
speech meant corporate America hav-
ing the right to be heard, even to, as 
the secret report said, ‘‘equal time.’’ 
Freedom of association provided cor-
porations the ‘‘organization,’’ ‘‘careful 
long-range planning and implementa-
tion,’’ and well-financed ‘‘joint ef-
fort’’—all those quotes—that Powell 
had recommended be done in his report 
‘‘through united action and national 
organizations.’’ 
The Court’s decision in Valeo did two 
noncontroversial things. It accepted 
that campaign contributions could be 
limited because unlimited campaign 
contributions could give rise to corrup-
tion or at least the appearance of cor-
ruption. Unlimited donations to can-
didates would even ‘‘undermine rep-
resentative 
democracy,’’ 
the 
Court 
said. No big deal. The Court also de-
cided that candidates may spend as 
much of their own money as they want 
on their own campaigns. It considered 
unlimited spending on one’s own cam-
paign protected by the First Amend-
ment, as there was little danger of cor-
ruption from spending one’s own cam-
paign money on oneself. 
So 
both 
of 
those 
holdings 
are 
unremarkable. What was remarkable 
was where Powell and his hawks took 
the Court when other interests, like 
corporate interests, wanted to spend 
money on a candidate. Corporate polit-
ical spending per se was not at issue in 
the case, but spending by special inter-
ests is precisely the kind of political 
influence 
which 
Powell 
had 
rec-
ommended in his secret report to the 
chamber. 
Powell and his hawks said special in-
terest political spending, so long as it 
was not in the form of a campaign con-
tribution, was protected by the same 
principle that protected a candidate 
spending his own money on his own 
campaign. 
Powell asserted that limiting these 
supposedly ‘‘independent’’ special in-
terest expenditures ‘‘‘perpetrates (the) 
grossest infringement’ on First Amend-
ment rights.’’ He did acknowledge the 
interest in ‘‘‘purity’ of elections,’’ but 
he used skeptical quotation marks 
around the word ‘‘purity,’’ just like he 
had used skeptical quotation marks in 
his report around the word ‘‘environ-
ment.’’ But Powell dismissed those pu-
rity concerns as likely ‘‘illusory,’’ to 
use his word. 
Powell’s Bench memo for the case 
critiqued the election law’s ‘‘attempt 
to lower barriers to political competi-
tion to increase the range of voter 
choice.’’ It read: ‘‘[T]he attempt to 
open access for the many necessarily 
involves limiting the power of the few 
to exercise rights of speech and asso-
ciation protected by the Constitution.’’ 
This 
interest 
in 
protecting 
the 
‘‘power of the few’’ aligns exactly with 
Powell’s secret chamber memo about 
corporate power and aligns with Pow-
ell’s own notes, which have more of his 
disparaging 
quotation 
marks 
ques-
tioning some of the briefs filed in the 
Valeo case that ‘‘identify one of the 
‘evils’ as the power of ‘the wealthy few’ 
(undefined 
but 
obviously 
unworthy 
people) to influence elections unduly.’’ 
In tone and import, that comes right 
out of Powell’s secret chamber report, 
which counted on the power of the cor-
porate few. 
Powell’s Richmond history, his cor-
porate law practice, his social position, 
his boardroom experience, and his anx-
iety about upheaval all align with a 
corporate worldview that society’s de-
cisions should be made by the sort of 
people in corporate boardrooms, so the 
power of those ‘‘few’’ had to be pro-
tected, to battle against what his re-
port called the ‘‘broad attack’’ both on 
the ‘‘American free enterprise system’’ 
and the ‘‘American political system of 
democracy under the rule of law.’’ Par-
ticularly important it was to protect 
that power when, as he had written to 
the chamber, the trouble is ‘‘deep’’ and 
the ‘‘hour is late.’’ 
To accommodate that corporate per-
spective, the Court had to reach judg-
ments about politics. It showed itself 
helpless. The amateurish political out-
look of the Court in Valeo stood out in 
the late-added footnote 52, which, in 
the interest of drawing clear lines— 
‘‘vagueness’’ being a stated concern of 
the Justices—exempted from disclosure 
political advertisements that did not 
expressly advocate for the election or 
defeat of a candidate using magic 
words like ‘‘vote for,’’ ‘‘vote against,’’ 
‘‘elect,’’ or ‘‘defeat.’’ 
In the Court’s amateur opinion, a 
hostile bombardment of TV advertising 
challenging a candidate’s morals, de-
cency, or integrity, or attacking the 
candidate’s alignment with the com-
munity’s values, and dropped on the 
candidate in the heat of election season 
with the intention of defeating the can-
didate, was not deemed advocacy in the 
election—unless it used those magic 
words. The idiocy of that premise is ob-
vious to anyone in politics. 
The Court’s amateurish folly about 
political spending extended to pre-
suming that spending by a powerful in-
terest for a candidate would create no 
risk of corruption; that the spending 
and the resulting influence could be 
kept separate and independent. That is 
idiotic in real life. 
When a powerful political interest 
starts signaling that it will spend enor-
mous sums to support candidates, 
guess what—candidates will find a way 
to take advantage, perhaps by attract-
ing the spending to their own side by 
the positions they take or perhaps by 
avoiding taking positions that would 
send the spending to their opponent’s 
side. The Court presumed that some et-
iquette would separate interest from 
candidate, but that was folly. It is 
blindingly naive to think that politics 
would produce no workarounds, that no 
coordination or signaling or inter-
mediaries would violate whatever eti-
quette of independence the Court had 
in mind. 
As we know, information travels fast 
in politics, never mind the etiquette. 
Drop a rock in a stream, and the 
stream flows around it. Put eager can-
didates and enormous interested spend-
ers together, and trouble will follow, as 
it has. Look no further than the cor-
ruption of American politics on cli-
mate change by the fossil fuel indus-
try. Again, this was idiocy from ama-
teurs. 
But the Valeo folly accomplished one 
thing: It opened the lane for unlimited 
special interest spending to come into 
elections to support or oppose can-
didates, just as Powell’s secret memo 
had recommended. 
The next opportunity for Powell 
came 2 years later, and this, time it in-
volved not just the type of political ac-
tivity corporations would likely under-
take but corporations directly. 
Massachusetts had banned corporate 
campaign contributions from statewide 
political referenda. A Massachusetts 
bank, the First National Bank of Bos-
ton, objected and sued. Frank Bellotti 
was then the Commonwealth’s attor-
ney general and defendant. 
First National Bank of Boston v. 
Bellotti wound its way up to the Su-
preme Court. Here, the question was 
the very right of corporations to influ-
ence popular elections—in this case, a

June 8, 2021 
referendum election. In a 5-to-4 deci-
sion, Powell wrote for the Republican- 
appointed majority that corporations 
had a constitutional right to engage in 
that political activity. 
This outcome can’t be found in the 
Constitution, which provides no polit-
ical role whatsoever to corporations, 
but this outcome aligned precisely 
with the recommendations of Powell’s 
secret report to the chamber. Indeed, it 
was the heart of his pitch to the cham-
ber. His entire secret plan for corporate 
political power would fall apart if 
States could bar corporate influence 
from elections, even referendum elec-
tions. Powell had urged in his secret 
report that corporate interests not 
have ‘‘the slightest hesitation to press 
vigorously in all political arenas’’ and 
that corporations should show no ‘‘re-
luctance to penalize politically those 
who 
oppose 
[them].’’ 
Corporations 
could never ‘‘press vigorously’’ or ‘‘pe-
nalize politically’’ if they could be kept 
out of elections, and so Bellotti was de-
cided. 
Paired with Valeo, the Bellotti case 
established that corporations had a 
constitutional right to engage in elec-
tions—at least referendum elections— 
with as much money as they wanted, or 
at least as much money as they could 
raise, so long as the election spending 
was not in the form of campaign con-
tributions. 
Ultimately, this laid the framework 
for the infamous Citizens United deci-
sion, another bare, 5-to-4 Republican 
majority that gave in this case cor-
porate interests a full constitutional 
right to unlimited political spending 
and, as a practical matter, to unlim-
ited anonymous political spending. 
How, in Bellotti, did they get around 
a Constitution that provides corpora-
tions no political rights? The trick 
used was to focus on the message, not 
the messenger—completely overlook 
that it was a corporation, not a person. 
The Court said that corporate political 
spending was actually speech, that in-
fluencing a popular referendum was the 
‘‘type of speech’’ at the heart of rep-
resentative democracy, and that the 
public had a right to hear it. The fact 
that corporations are not people and, 
indeed, that they have advantages over 
real people in electioneering and, in-
deed, that they might even come to 
dominate popular democracy because 
of those advantages was overlooked by 
directing attention to the speech, not 
the speaker. 
If the type of speech was relevant to 
the public debate, Powell said, it 
doesn’t matter whether a corporation 
or a person says it—except every piece 
of this is wrong. Money is not speech. 
Corporations are not people. And look-
ing at the message, not the messenger, 
would allow any entity’s message into 
our politics, even foreign ones. Then 
add in anonymity, and the problem 
goes toxic, as we now see in our coun-
try today. ‘‘We the People’’ becomes 
‘‘We 
the 
Hidden 
Anything 
With 
Money.’’ 
The last case for Powell was Federal 
Election Commission v. Massachusetts 
Citizens for Life in 1986. Here, the ques-
tion was whether an advocacy group of 
precisely the kind Powell had in mind 
in the chamber memo was forbidden to 
spend its corporate treasury funds in a 
Federal election. 
Now, the situation was that Congress 
had blocked corporations from using 
their treasury funds in Federal elec-
tions. They had to raise money from 
voluntary donations; hence the cor-
porate PACs that we have seen that 
had to raise and spend their own 
money. The Court accepted that cor-
porate treasuries might give corporate 
voices ‘‘an unfair advantage in the po-
litical marketplace’’ given their vast 
corporate wealth and resources. But in 
the case before it, the Court decided 
that nonprofits were different. They 
were designed for advocacy, and they 
didn’t have the same sort of treasury 
funds as business corporations. 
Again, remember the Powell memo. 
Powell didn’t recommend that corpora-
tions undertake their political work di-
rectly. He had pressed for ‘‘organiza-
tion,’’ for ‘‘joint effort.’’ He had urged 
corporate America to pursue ‘‘the po-
litical power available only through 
united action and national organiza-
tions.’’ And guess what. The U.S. 
Chamber of Commerce, the national or-
ganization to which Powell had deliv-
ered his secret recommendations, was a 
nonprofit corporation. 
In his years on the Court, Lewis Pow-
ell made good on the secret rec-
ommendations that he had made to the 
U.S. Chamber of Commerce 5 months 
before joining the Court. He showed 
that 
‘‘an 
activist-minded 
Supreme 
Court’’—his words—could be that ‘‘im-
portant instrument for social, eco-
nomic 
and 
political 
change’’—his 
words—that 
he 
had 
proposed. 
He 
opened a lane for unlimited money into 
politics, enabling what his secret re-
port had called ‘‘the scale of financing 
available only through joint effort.’’ He 
bulldozed 
aside 
bars 
on 
corporate 
spending and politics so corporations 
could deploy, just as his report had 
urged, ‘‘whatever degree of pressure— 
publicly and privately—may be nec-
essary.’’ And he allowed advocacy orga-
nizations to spend their treasuries in 
politics, opening the way for the ‘‘orga-
nization,’’ ‘‘joint effort,’’ and ‘‘united 
action’’ he had called for in his report 
through ‘‘national organizations.’’ 
All the key pieces were in place to 
unleash the corporate influence ma-
chine that he had recommended to the 
chamber, 
influence 
that 
dominates 
much of American politics today, influ-
ence that controls much of what we do 
in the Senate Chamber today, and in 
which, of all things, the chamber, 
which was his client for the secret re-
port, is today the apex predator of cor-
porate influence, red in tooth and claw. 
Everything was aligned for what 
Powell had recommended: corporate 
‘‘political power,’’ ‘‘assiduously cul-
tivated,’’ ‘‘used aggressively and with 
determination,’’ with ‘‘no hesitation to 
attack,’’ ‘‘not the slightest hesitation 
to press vigorously in all political are-
nas,’’ and no ‘‘reluctance to penalize 
politically those who oppose.’’ 
It is a dark achievement, but it is 
quite an achievement. And, interest-
ingly, 
Powell’s 
official 
biography 
frames out his judicial career without 
mentioning his role as the early or-
chestrator of corporate political influ-
ence in American politics. It is actu-
ally likely his most significant and 
lasting legacy.

June 8, 2021 
HONORING THE LIFE OF DR. 
ALBERT DOTSON, SR. 
HON. MARIA ELVIRA SALAZAR 
OF FLORIDA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, June 8, 2021 
Ms. SALAZAR. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor Dr. Albert Dotson, Sr., a be-
loved constituent in our community who 
served as a pioneer, activist, husband, and 
loving father throughout his lifetime. On May 
29, 2021, Mr. Dotson passed away at the age 
of 83. 
I would like to recognize Dr. Albert Dotson, 
Sr.’s steadfast leadership, his embrace of the 
communities he has lived and served in, and 
his many achievements. 
Born in Memphis, Tennessee in 1938, Al-
bert was raised by a single mother who 
worked as a housekeeper. His mother, Al-
berta, taught him the value of hard work and 
respect at an early age. 
Later on in life, Albert met his wife, Earlene, 
while at church. The couple married in 1959 
and continued to attend church together 
throughout the next six decades. Together, 
they had five children and 13 grandchildren. 
Throughout his life, Albert never forgot the 
value of hard work that his mother instilled in 
him. After dropping out of college to take an 
entry-level job at Sears Roebuck and Com-
pany, he eventually worked his way up as the 
corporation’s first African American store man-
ager. In 1976, he relocated to Miami, where 
he eventually decided to launch several of his 
own businesses with his wife. 
Education was always very important to Al-
bert and Earlene. After watching all five of 
their children graduate from college, they de-
cided to go back to school themselves and 
complete their undergraduate degrees. Albert 
eventually went on to complete his PhD in 
Philosophy in 2004. 
Albert continuously remained active in the 
higher education community, serving on Flor-
ida International University’s (FIU) Foundation 
Board of Directors for nearly two decades to 
secure research funding for architecture and 
medical students. He eventually went on to 
chair the FIU Board of Trustees from 2009 to 
2011. 
Albert cared deeply for the Miami commu-
nity, being involved with community groups 
like the Miami-Dade Chamber of Commerce 
and the Miami-Dade School Board. In 1989, 
he joined the Orange Bowl Committee, cre-
ated in 1935 to promote tourism to the Miami 
metropolitan area. Less than a decade later, 
Albert broke records when he became the first 
African American President of the Committee. 
Albert’s life is a great example of service- 
leadership and working hard towards the 
American Dream. Miami-Dade will always be 
grateful for his contributions to our community. 
Dr. Dotson Sr. is survived by his wife 
Earlene; his sons Albert Jr. and Jonathan; his 
daughters Dr. Toya Greene, LeTessa Hall, 
Christa Dean; and his 13 grandchildren. 
STEM EDUCATOR AWARDS EQUITY 
ACT 
HON. GREGORIO KILILI CAMACHO 
SABLAN 
OF THE NORTHERN MARIANA ISLANDS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, June 8, 2021 
Mr. SABLAN. Madam Speaker, today, I in-
troduce the STEM Educator Awards Equity 
Act to ensure educators from the Northern 
Mariana Islands, Virgin Islands, Guam, and 
American Samoa are represented in the an-
nual Presidential Awards for Excellence in 
Math and Science Teaching. 
Established by Congress in 1983, the Presi-
dential Award is the highest recognition that 
an elementary or secondary school mathe-
matics or science teacher may receive in the 
United States. Over 4,800 teachers have been 
recognized for their contributions in the class-
room and to their profession. 
Unlike the fifty States, the District of Colum-
bia, Puerto Rico and Department of Defense 
schools, each of which may recognize a 
STEM educator, no more than two awards in 
total can go to teachers from the four insular 
areas: the Northern Mariana Islands, the Vir-
gin Islands, Guam, and American Samoa. This 
limitation has resulted in many years in which 
no teacher from one of those four areas is se-
lected. No teacher from the Marianas, for in-
stance, was selected this year. And this lack 
of recognition defeats the purpose of the pro-
gram, which is to inspire excellence within 
each area and provide a role model for other 
local STEM educators to emulate. These stat-
utory limits, also, unfairly deny deserving edu-
cators in the insular areas the national rec-
ognition and professional development oppor-
tunities we provide to STEM educators else-
where in our Nation. 
My bill provides a more equitable process 
by requiring awards to at least one teacher 
from each of the four areas. By ensuring 
teachers from all parts of America are rep-
resented, more students and schools will ben-
efit from the expert-led training programs and 
collaboration opportunities available to award-
ees during their visit to our Nation’s Capital. 
The gentlewoman from American Samoa, 
Mrs. RADEWAGEN and the gentleman from 
Guam, Mr. SAN NICOLAS, are original cospon-
sors of the bill. 
I urge my colleagues to support this bipar-
tisan legislation.

HONORING ROBERT EIKLEBERRY 
AS IOWAN OF THE WEEK 
HON. CYNTHIA AXNE 
OF IOWA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, June 8, 2021 
Mrs. AXNE. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
honor Robert ‘‘Mongo’’ Eikleberry, as a long-
time LGBTQ advocate, business owner, com-
munity leader during this Pride Month. 
Robert served in the Vietnam War as a 
young man, where he was given the nickname 
‘‘Mongo’’, When he returned home in 1972, he 
began working as a senior electrician as well 
as working at bars. Here, Robert saw that 
while gay bars were some of the only places 
LGBT individuals could openly be themselves, 
many establishments weren’t uplifting the 
causes of the LGBT community. Robert real-
ized he should open a business in Des 
Moines that would provide philanthropic sup-
port to multiple causes impacting his commu-
nity. 
Robert opened the Blazing Saddles in Des 
Moines in 1983, 38 years ago, which is now 
the oldest gay bar in the Midwest. Robert’s 
work has allowed him to create charities, such 
as the All Iowa AIDs Benefits to support 
Iowans suffering from HIV/AIDS during the 
height of the epidemic, as well as helping 
fundraise to support the needs of LGBT 
Iowans. Robert founded the Imperial Court of 
Iowa which funds educational scholarships for 
high school students and adult education 
seekers. He’s known to pitch in for causes like 
voter education and advocacy, equal rights, 
and much more. Robert has always made 
sure his employees at the Blazing Saddles 
were paid competitive wages and had job pro-
tection to be themselves, protection that would 
not be given to most LGBT workers until 2020. 
In his over 40 years of activism, Robert has 
come face-to-face with hate and discrimination 
right here in Iowa. His bar had their windows 
smashed, flags burned, received threatening 
letters, and various other acts of vandalism 
over the years. ‘‘You can’t make fear a part of 
your life’’, he said, reflecting on that fact that 
the fight for LGBT equality has historically 
been met with violence and intimidation. ‘‘But 
they can’t scare us back into closet’’ he said 
with a chuckle. Although LGBT equality has 
made strides recently, Robert has said there is 
still more work to do. ‘‘Everyone needs a 
place to be themselves’’ he said. 
His bar was named after the 1974 movie, 
Blazing Saddles, where a plucky group of im-
migrants, railroad workers, white townsfolk, 
and a black Sheriff who pull together to save 
their town for those who wish them harm and 
in turn, live safely together. A fitting name in-
deed. Please join me in honoring Robert 
‘‘Mongo’’ Eikleberry as our Iowan of the Week 
as we celebrate Pride this month.

community. His retirement concludes a vibrant 
career of advocacy, public engagement, and 
scholarly work. I am proud to call Dr. Cotrell 
a fellow San Antonian and friend. Please join 
me in commemorating the career of an ex-
traordinary educator and equal rights advo-
cate. 
Dr. Charles L. Cotrell began his studies at 
St. Mary’s University in 1958, graduating in 
1962. In 1965, after receiving his Ph.D. in Po-
litical Science and Government from the Uni-
versity of Arizona, Dr. Cotrell went on to teach 
at Texas A&M University—Kingsville (formerly 
Texas A&I) until returning to teach at his alma 
mater in 1966. Dr. Cotrell was an active partic-
ipant in many civil rights causes like the La 
Casita Farms strike. He was professor to 
many Chicano activists of the late 1960s at 
both Texas A&M—Kingsville and St. Mary’s. 
He mentored youth in the Mexican American 
Youth Organization (MAYO) and is a founding 
board member of the Mexican American Unity 
Council in San Antonio. In 2000, Dr. Cotrell 
was named President of St. Mary’s University 
where he spearheaded several education ini-
tiatives focusing on underrepresented groups. 
Madam Speaker, I am honored to recognize 
Dr. Cotrell and his many contributions to our 
beautiful city. I thank Dr. Cotrell for all that he 
has done. May he enjoy his well-earned retire-
ment.

IN RECOGNITION OF FRAYDUN 
MANOCHERIAN 
HON. CAROLYN B. MALONEY 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, June 8, 2021 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New York. 
Madam Speaker, I rise to recognize Fraydun 
Manocherian on the 75-year anniversary of his 
immigration to the United States from Tehran, 
Iran and for his steadfast dedication to and 
impactful advocacy for automobile safety. Mr. 
Manocherian is also a successful entrepreneur 
embodying the American Dream with his wife 
Jennifer, their five children, and 13 grand-
children. 
In 1932, Fraydun Manocherian emigrated to 
the United States at the age of 14 with his 
mother and brother. He soon became an en-
trepreneur pursing the American Dream, start-
ing his first business venture in high school by 
buying and selling used cars. Then, while at-
tending New York University, he turned his 
sights to New York’s skyline—embarking on 
his career in real estate development. 
He acquired three adjacent five-story walk 
up buildings in Manhattan for $15,000 a piece 
which he then redeveloped. During the 1960’s 
and 1970’s, Mr. Manocherian was one of the 
most prolific developers in Manhattan. In the 
1980’s he expanded his ventures nationwide 
through real estate investments and high-rise 
developments, among a multitude of other en-
terprises. He was the originator of the mega- 
health-club concept, opening the first New 
York Health & Racquet Club in 1973, followed 
by ten additional Manhattan locations. He also 
developed The Kimberly Suite Hotel in mid-
town Manhattan in 1985, and has since ac-
quired other hotels which he still personally 
oversees. 
However, among all this success, Mr. 
Manocherian is, at his core a public servant 
and philanthropist. And it is for his accomplish-
ments in automobile safety that I, his family, 
and all Americans are most proud. 
In 1951, two of Mr. Manocherian’s high 
school friends were killed by a drunk driver. At 
the age of nineteen, he turned his grief into 
activism and became an advocate for federal 
funding of public education in traffic safety. 
After learning that automobile accidents were 
the number one killer of all young adults aged 
16–25 years old, and the number one cause 
of physical disabilities—causing agonizing 
tragedy and grief for countless families, a 19- 
year-old Mr. Manocherian sent a telegram to 
President Eisenhower. The President arranged 
a meeting with Senator Irving Ives. 
He continued meeting with congressional 
leaders in Washington, D.C. to urge President 
Eisenhower’s Committee on Traffic Safety to 
begin a national mass media educational pro-
gram. While his determined efforts and count-
less contributions were impressive, he was not 
satisfied with the speed of progress. In 1962, 
he founded the National Road Safety Founda-
tion with the purpose of reducing the 55,000 
auto related fatalities every year. In 1970, he 
wrote Flesh, Metal, and Glass, a book on auto 
safety. Over the past 50 years, more than two 
million copies of Mr. Manocherian’s book have 
been distributed free to thousands of high 
schools and drivers’ education programs 
across the country. The publication has been 
updated several times and is now available 
online. The National Road Safety Foundation 
has also produced dozens of educational vid-
eos and public service announcements. The 
book and videos, along with other educational 
materials, are still used as important tools in 
driver’s education programs throughout the 
country. 
Over the last half century, The National 
Road Safety Foundation has educated millions 
on how to become better and safer drivers 
through collaborating with educators, private 
groups, legislators, and government agencies 
to effect national standards in driving com-
petence. The National Road Safety Founda-
tion has also played an important role in seat 
belt laws, drunken driving policy, safer car reg-
ulations, and helmet and tum signal legislation 
for motorcycles. Mr. Manocherian has been a 
persuasive and influential force in Congress 
as this body enacted policies and legislation 
focused on driver safety. 
Mr. Manocherian’s voice was among the 
first to rally the nation against drunk driving 
and his advocacy for federal funding of public 
education in traffic safety contributed toward 
passage of The Highway Safety Act of 1970, 
which established the National Highway Traffic 
Safety Administration. He is currently working 
to secure increased funding from the Federal 
Highway Trust Fund for a sustained National 
Traffic Safety Education media program. 
These efforts, among countless others, have 
helped reduce fatalities from 55,000 a year to 
38,000 a year. This 30 percent reduction in fa-
talities is astonishing considering that in that 
same time, the number of drivers and mile 
driven have grown exponentially. 
For his dedication and accomplishments in 
the field of auto safety, Mr. Manocherian has 
received the ‘‘Man of the Year’’ award from 
the New York Council for Civic Affairs, the 
‘‘Man of the Year’’ award from the Greater 
New York Automobile Dealers Association, an 
Honorary Doctorate in Humane Letters from 
St. John’s University, a Master of Arts degree 
from the International University of Commu-
nications in Washington, D.C., the 1997 Distin-
guished Service to Safety Award from the Na-
tional Safety Council, and the 2005 Public 
Service Award, one of the highest awards 
given by the National Highway Traffic Safety 
Administration. He has met with almost every 
President since President Eisenhower, is a 
founder of the Carter Center, and was ap-
pointed by President H. W. Bush to serve on 
the National Driver Register Advisory Com-
mittee. 
At 89 years young, Fraydun Manocherian is 
not only a nationally recognized powerful pub-
lic service advocate, but also a rated jet pilot, 
and, more importantly, a greater husband, fa-
ther, and grandfather than businessman, en-
trepreneur, or philanthropist. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my distinguished col-
leagues to join me in recognizing Fraydun 
Manocherian for his public service and incred-
ible contributions to society and a lifetime of 
dedication to automobile and driver safety.

Mr. GRAVES of Missouri. Madam Speaker, 
I proudly pause to recognize Sheila Tracy.

With the help of Sheila’s leadership, the 
Northland Regional Chamber has continued to

trict. Sheila has spent countless hours working 
to move projects forward that would benefit 
my constituents, most recently the Buck O’Neil 
Bridge.

INTRODUCTION OF THE DISTRICT 
OF 
COLUMBIA 
LOCAL 
JUROR 
NON-DISCRIMINATION 
ACT 
OF 
2021 
HON. ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON 
OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, June 8, 2021 
Ms. NORTON. Madam Speaker, today, I in-
troduce the District of Columbia Local Juror 
Non-Discrimination Act of 2021. This bill would 
clarify that D.C. residents may not be ex-
cluded or disqualified from jury service in the 
D.C. Superior Court based on sexual orienta-
tion or gender identity. Specifically, my bill 
would clarify that ‘‘sex,’’ which is a protected 
class under the non-discrimination law that ap-
plies to jurors in the D.C. Superior Court, in-
cludes sexual orientation and gender identity. 
Under the Home Rule Act, Congress has ex-
clusive jurisdiction over title 11 of the D.C. 
Code (relating to organization and jurisdiction 
of the local D.C. courts). 
The District has one of the strongest non- 
discrimination laws in the country, including 
protecting individuals based on sexual orienta-
tion and gender identity. However, under the 
Home Rule Act, the District does not have the 
authority to make this non-discrimination law 
applicable to jurors in the D.C. Superior Court. 
Therefore, until the District is given complete 
control over the organization and jurisdiction of 
its local courts, an act of Congress is required 
to make this important change to protect the 
rights of all D.C. residents. This bill is nec-
essary to protect jurors in the D.C. Superior 
Court from discrimination. 
My bill is similar to the Juror Non-Discrimi-
nation Act of 2021 (H.R. 1140), which would 
provide the same protections for jurors in fed-
eral court. I am a proud cosponsor of that bill. 
I urge my colleagues to support this impor-
tant bill.

CELEBRATING 80 YEARS OF THE 
DOWNRIVER FAMILY YMCA 
HON. DEBBIE DINGELL 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, June 8, 2021 
Mrs. DINGELL. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to celebrate the anniversary of the 
Downriver Family YMCA located in Southgate, 
Michigan. Their 80 years of service to our 
community and its families is worthy of com-
mendation. 
In Metro Detroit, the YMCA has been serv-
ing families for over 168 years. The YMCA is 
an organization of men, women, and children 
with a shared commitment to nurturing the po-
tential of kids, promoting healthy living, and 
fostering a sense of social responsibility. 
With simple beginnings as an organization 
established in 1941 by W.F. Newell at a house 
on Biddle Avenue in Wyandotte, Michigan, the 
Downriver Family YMCA has grown to be an 
exceptional center of wellness, community, 
and education. In 1943, The YMCA outgrew 
their small house and moved to a property at 
Chestnut and Biddle. This new Downriver 
YMCA represented the first ‘‘family’’ YMCA 
branch including boys and girls as well as 
men and women. Sixteen years later, they 
made the big move to their new home in 
Southgate 
at 
Fort 
Street 
and 
Eureka, 
partnering with the YWCA. Together they built 
two new pools and improved their offerings 
constantly to continue to serve the bustling 
area of Downriver. On May 11, 2003, to meet 
the growing needs of the community the 
YMCA and the City of Southgate held the 
grand opening for their brand-new building, 
The Southgate Fun and Fitness Center. 
Serving 
over 
15,000 
members, 
the 
Downriver Family YMCA is the largest branch 
in Metro Detroit. This organization has sup-
ported generations of Downriver families from 
childhood well into their senior years. Pro-
viding after-school programs, summer camps, 
food drives, active living classes, and activities 
for seniors, the Downriver Family YMCA’s 
commitment to the promotion of health and 
wellness has impacted the lives of thousands 
of Michiganders of all ages as they enter their 
eighth decade of service to the people of 
Downriver. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in celebrating the Downriver Family 
YMCA’s 80 years of service to our community. 
The Downriver Family YMCA has been a con-
stant in the lives of the Downriver area’s chil-
dren and families for decades. I extend my 
gratitude to the entire Downriver Family YMCA 
team and wish them continued success in 
service and healthy living for years to come.

GENERAL OF THE U.S. HOUSE OF 
REPRESENTATIVES, 
IN 
CELE-
BRATION OF HIS RETIREMENT 
HON. RODNEY DAVIS 
OF ILLINOIS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, June 8, 2021 
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to acknowledge the ca-
reer of a true public servant, House Inspector 
General Michael Ptasienski, who has dedi-
cated nearly 15 years of his professional ca-
reer to ensuring the People’s House operates 
with integrity and accountability. Appointed as 
Inspector General in February of 2018, Mike is 
only the fifth individual to hold this position 
and as House IG, exemplified the excellence, 
attention to detail, determination and character 
necessary for success. 
But of course, the role of the Inspector Gen-
eral was not a surprise to Mike. Prior to being 
appointed, he had served as Deputy Inspector 
General of Advisory and Administrative Serv-
ices, and as Director of Management Advisory 
Services. This month, his tenure in the House 
IG shop came to its end when he entered re-
tirement on June 4, 2021. Mike will be 
missed—not only for his dedication and com-
mitment to the IG mission, but for his positive 
attitude and approachable nature. 
Part of the mission of the House IG is to 
‘‘serve as a constructive critic, helpful advisor, 
and positive change agent.’’ In fulfilling this 
mission, Mike has gone above and beyond, 
and the House is a more accountable, effi-
cient, and safe institution due to the many rec-
ommendations and advisories his team pro-
duced under his leadership. 
I wish to once again express my and my 
team’s gratitude for Mike’s partnership, col-
laboration, and kindness throughout the years, 
and wish him all the best in his retirement.

HONORING REVEREND DR. JOHN E. 
ROBERTS 
HON. MARCY KAPTUR 
OF OHIO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, June 8, 2021 
Ms. KAPTUR. Madam Speaker, I am 
pleased to recognize the Reverend Dr. John 
Roberts, Pastor of Indiana Avenue Missionary 
Baptist Church in Toledo, for his 56 years of 
service in Jesus Christ. Our community joined 
his congregation in celebration of this heralded 
event on June 6, 2021. 
I chronicled Pastor Roberts’ life in an Exten-
sion of Remarks in April 2005 upon the very 
special occasion of his fortieth anniversary. 
This 56th year, Pastor Roberts will be ele-
vated to the honorable status of Pastor Emer-
itus. 
Born in Bryant, Mississippi in 1927 to 
George and Melvina Roberts, John E. Roberts 
came to Toledo, Ohio in 1944. A founding 
member of Indiana Avenue Missionary Baptist 
Church, he has been part of the church since 
it was organized in 1946. As noted in his biog-
raphy, ‘‘He has served and walked in the foot-
steps of most positions in the church, from 
custodian to Pastor’’ and was called to pastor 
the church on the 3rd Sunday of January l965. 
Even while Pastor, he pursued his Bachelor of 
Arts and Bachelor of Religious Education de-
grees in 1975, his Master of Theology in 1984, 
and his Doctorate in Biblical Theology in 1985. 
His biography highlights his many roles in 
his capacity as pastor: teacher, preacher, 
counsellor, and builder. The biography notes 
he is ‘‘Christ-like in devotion: strong in faith 
and mighty in prayer. His life, with its results, 
is a never-failing inspiration and challenges 
people of all ages and races, creating strong 
men around him.’’ 
Though Pastor Roberts has been the guid-
ing light of his congregation and family for 
decades, standing beside him always has 
been his wife, First Lady Mother Bernice Rob-
erts. Pastor and First Lady Mother Roberts are 
partners in all ways and ‘‘jointly through the 
Grace of God they have mastered certain 
techniques that involve the ability to com-
promise, understand, cooperate, give and 
take, adjusting for better, not worse, knowing 
that all things work together for the good of 
those who love the Lord.’’ Pastor and Mother 
Roberts were blessed to celebrate their 71st 
anniversary this year, on April 6. Together

their family includes children, grandchildren, 
and great-grandchildren. 
Pastor Roberts’ service to the membership 
of Indiana Avenue Missionary Baptist Church 
blazed a path of leadership as he grew the 
church over many decades. His congregation 
blossomed from dozens to thousands as he 
shared the Word of the Lord, his devotion and 
wisdom, and his unique gifts. 
In addition to his leadership in the church, 
Pastor Roberts’ imprimatur in our community 
is writ large. A highly respected community 
leader, he has served on many Toledo area 
organizations, lending his expertise and coun-
sel well beyond the doors of his church. 
Reverend Dr. John E. Roberts came to re-
tirement at age 93 in March of 2021. He was 
the oldest serving Baptist pastor in Toledo, 
Lucas County, Ohio, and the Nation. As Pas-
tor Emeritus, I am certain he will continue 
Christ’s Message of Love and follow Psalms 
78:72, ‘‘So he shepherded them according to 
the integrity of his heart. And guided them by 
the skillfulness of his hands.’’ 
We are grateful for Pastor Roberts’ unique 
and precious gifts including an irrepressible, 
wry sense of humor, brilliant smile, twinkling 
eyes, and a master of biblical text. A man of 
the Word, he kept his word. His life inspired 
others from all walks of life to follow his steady 
lead. The Indiana Avenue Missionary Baptist 
Church building he led his congregation to 
construct, and then expand several times, 
serves as a foundation stone for the revitaliza-
tion of the near west neighborhood that hugs 
Toledo’s downtown. 
When Pastor Roberts set a course, he al-
ways arrived at the destination.

Colonel Littlestone was born on September 
23, 1923 in Evanston, Illinois and moved with 
his family to California at a young age. He at-
tended and graduated from Los Angeles High 
School and was drafted into the Army a cou-
ple years later. While there, he was chosen to 
go to the United States Military Academy at 
West Point where he graduated in 1947. 
Colonel Littlestone married his wife Doris in 
1948. They moved to the Pacific Palisades 
neighborhood of Los Angeles in 1972 and 
raised three children, Richard, Nanette and 
Mark. They resided in the Palisades for 49 
years. Doris and Dick were married for almost 
73 years. 
Colonel Littlestone was a veteran of World 
War II, the Korean War, and the Vietnam War. 
He served in the United States Army for 33 
years and received the Legion of Merit, the 
Bronze Star, and more than a dozen other 
honors. 
Through the G.I. Bill, he earned several ad-
vanced degrees and said that as a result, he 
had a wonderful career in the Army. 
After his time in the service, Colonel 
Littlestone taught at West Point for several 
years and later served as Chair and Professor 
of the Department of Military Science and As-
sociate Director of the Computers and Infor-
mation Systems Research Program at the Uni-
versity of California, Los Angeles. 
Colonel Littlestone believed deeply in duty, 
honor, and country, but went beyond that to 
serve his community and when he retired, this 
became his passion. Colonel Littlestone dedi-
cated his time towards advocating for local 
veterans and fighting for improvements in his 
community. He said it was his service in three 
wars, and all the Army provided him, that 
drove his continued involvement and advo-
cacy. 
Colonel Dick Littlestone was the driving 
force behind the creation of the Los Angeles 
National Cemetery’s new and expanded col-
umbarium, a 4.4-acre project on the West Los 
Angeles VA Campus that would go on to 
house the remains of over 90,000 veterans 
and their family members. For 22 years he 
championed this cause to ensure more vet-
erans in the region could be laid to rest closer 
to their families and homes. The process was 
a labor of love and he prodded and cajoled 
several Secretaries of Veterans Affairs for 
years, knocking down one hurdle after an-
other. His final achievement was to see the 
completion and dedication of the columbarium 
at the Los Angeles National Cemetery, which 
took place in October 2019. 
Colonel Littlestone was honored in 2015 
with the first-ever Los Angeles County Board 
of Supervisors’ Veterans Lifetime Achievement 
Award. He was more recently recognized for 
his service to the country when named Los 
Angeles Veteran of the Year in 2020 by Los 
Angeles City Councilmember Mike Bonin. 
Bonin said, ‘‘Throughout his decades of serv-
ice to both his country and his community, 
Colonel Littlestone has consistently combined 
his passion for the military with education.’’ 
Bonin added, ‘‘Colonel Dick Littlestone is an 
extraordinary example of patriotic duty and 
service—to his country and to the City of Los 
Angeles.’’ 
Colonel Dick Littlestone believed deeply in 
duty, honor, and country. His dedication to 
veterans and his service to his country and 
community is a shining example for all of us 
to follow. May his memory be a blessing.

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, June 8, 2021 
Ms. KUSTER. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to recognize John Manning on the occasion of 
his retirement as Chief Executive Officer of 
Southwestern Community Services . 
For more than 30 years, John Manning has 
provided much needed support to our commu-

munity Services (SCS). SCS runs numerous 
critical programs designed to empower low-in-
come individuals and families, such as the

ance funds to thousands of households 
throughout the COVID–19 pandemic. 
I commend John Manning on his retirement 
after more than three decades of public serv-
ice and dedication to the Granite State. John 
also serves as the Fire Chief for the Town of 
Marlborough, a testament to his commitment 
to the well-being and safety of Granite Staters. 
On behalf of New Hampshire’s Second Con-
gressional District, I thank John Manning for 
his service and wish him the best of luck in his 
new chapter.

IN RECOGNITION OF THE 150TH AN-
NIVERSARY OF GLC MINERALS, 
LLC 
HON. MIKE GALLAGHER 
OF WISCONSIN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, June 8, 2021 
Mr. GALLAGHER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor GLC Minerals, LLC as the 
company celebrates its 150th anniversary. 
GLC Minerals is a Green Bay based, cus-
tom manufacturer of minerals and applications 
in its fifth generation of ownership and oper-
ation by the Hurlbut family. GLC Minerals 
serves many of Wisconsin’s key industries, in-
cluding dairy, poultry, glass, paper, construc-
tion, and agronomy. 
The company came from humble beginnings 
when entrepreneur, Fred Hurlbut, Sr., realized 
the strategic location of Green Bay and the 
economic opportunity of Great Lakes shipping 
following the Civil War and, in 1871, Fred’s 
foresight came to fruition as the Hurlbut Cal-
cium and Chemical Company. 
In 1913, second-generation owner, Fred 
Hurlbut, Jr., grew the company to include 
major coal and bulk distribution throughout 
Northeast Wisconsin. In 1940, the now named 
F. Hurlbut Company relocated to the shores of 
the Fox River where it still resides today, 81 
years later. Throughout the mid-1900s, the 
company expanded its equipment and product 
lines. 
Under third-generation owners, Wesley H. 
Garner I, Charles Bennet and Frederick J. 
Lenfesty, the company diversified into the cal-
cium and concrete products business. In 1965, 
Wesley H. Garner I’s son, Frederick L. Garner, 
joined the company and, after serving in var-
ious capacities within the company for more

than twenty years, he purchased Hurlbut Cal-
cium and Chemical from the family. Frederick 
focused on reinvesting in the plant and equip-
ment to produce a diverse and high-quality 
product line, and changed the name of the 
firm to Great Lakes Calcium Corporation. 
In 1996, Wesley Hurlbut Garner ll, became 
the fifth-generation family member to continue 
the entrepreneurial spirit by further expanding 
product lines. In 2015, Wes changed the com-
pany’s name to GLC Minerals, LLC and 
launched GLC Integrated Services, LLC, a 
trans-load company serving Wisconsin’s dairy 
industry with cost-effective movement of prod-
uct from rail to truck to farm. GLC Minerals 
continues to grow and support our local busi-
ness community and the broader Green Bay 
community, as it did in the early days when it 
helped to establish and support the Greater 
Green Bay Chamber. 
Madam Speaker, I urge all Members of this 
body to join me in applauding GLC Minerals 
and the Hurlbut family legacy for their 150 
years of success.

NORTHERN 
MARIANA 
ISLANDS 
ASIAN AND PACIFIC ISLANDER 
HERITAGE MONTH ESSAY CON-
TEST WINNERS 
HON. GREGORIO KILILI CAMACHO 
SABLAN 
OF THE NORTHERN MARIANA ISLANDS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, June 8, 2021 
Mr. SABLAN. Madam Speaker, this year, I 
hosted the first-ever Asian and Pacific Islander 
Heritage Month Essay Contest for Northern 
Mariana Islands middle school and high 
school students. This contest gives students in 
my district the opportunity to showcase their 
writing skills and reflect on their unique experi-
ences living in the Northern Mariana Islands. 
This year’s essay prompt encouraged students 
to share how the Asian and Pacific Islander 
community has impacted them, and what the 
Marianas community can do to best celebrate 
and respect the diversity in our islands. 
I would like to congratulate the 44 students 
who participated. A volunteer panel of judges 
reviewed the essays and chose Jia Ross 
Nicdao and Camille Torres Hocog as this 
year’s winners of the middle school and high 
school division, respectively. Jia, an 8th grade 
student at Admiral Herbert G. Hopwood Mid-
dle School, wrote about her experience as a 
young Asian American in the Northern Mar-
iana Islands. Camille, a sophomore at Mari-
anas High School, wrote about diversity and 
unity. 
I am proud to include in the RECORD the es-
says submitted by Jia and Camille: 
MIDDLE SCHOOL WINNER, JIA ROSS NICDAO, AD-
MIRAL HERBERT G. HOPWOOD MIDDLE SCHOOL, 
8TH GRADE 
Even though it is a small area, the North-
ern Marianas Islands are undeniably full of 
different cultures and traditions. Many eth-
nic groups, specifically Asian citizens and 
Pacific Islanders, proudly call the CNMI 
their home; they comprise more than 80 per-
cent of Saipan’s population. Whether you 
were born or migrated from a different coun-
try, we still thrive as a community to em-
power one another. 
My parents immigrated to the CNMI for 
work and started a family here. My identity 
as Asian American has been a little con-
fusing. In the beginning, I felt as if I did not 
deserve to be a member of the Filipino com-
munity. I felt like my opinions and thoughts 
were invalid when discussing Filipino topics 
because I was raised away from the area of 
action and lived abroad. My different living 
situation made me feel as if I do not deserve 
the recognition Filipinos got. I struggled to 
find a label that I connected to, so I decided 
to research Filipino culture. At that moment 
was when I found out about the ethnic group 
that I was unknowingly part of, known as 
Asian Americans, who are Americans with 
Asian ancestry and/or children of immi-
grated parents. This community was some-
thing I finally related to. On the island, I 
never felt indifferent because of my eth-
nicity, which was opposite to my other feel-
ings. I was surrounded by other Asians, so 
whenever I was around them, I felt like I be-
longed with them. I liked that I could relate 
with other Asian Americans through shared 
experiences; it gave me comfort. Most of the 
representation here in the CNMI has been 
positive. When I see members from this com-
munity succeed, it not only impacts the view 
and generalization for our community, but it 
also empowers me personally to strive for 
that success. It pushes me to fulfill the 
achievements that others succeeded in. It 
motivates me to become involved in that 
success and also positively represent the 
community. I am one of those community 
members, and I am proud to represent the 
Asian American Community. 
I believe one of the best ways to respect 
and celebrate diversity in this community is 
by educating ourselves on each other’s cul-
tures. We can set an example for other com-
munities to participate in Asian American 
and Pacific Islander appreciation month by 
first doing it within the community. Sharing 
about our experiences; getting to know each 
others’ viewpoints is an expressive way to 
understand each others’ lifestyles. Also, re-
searching appropriate behaviors and man-
nerism is critical to be aware of when talk-
ing to other people from different countries; 
we should never offend anyone and be dis-
respectful. If we remove the negative energy 
between nationalities in the community, we 
can work together as one and spread love 
with other communities. Overall, being part 
of the Asian American and Pacific Islander 
community comes with many responsibil-
ities, so being one with each other will help 
us all accomplish many goals. 
HIGH SCHOOL WINNER, CAMILLE TORRES HOCOG, 
MARIANAS HIGH SCHOOL, SOPHOMORE 
The Northern Mariana Islands; an archi-
pelago of islands in the middle of the Pacific 
Ocean. Despite our small and rather remote 
location, an abundance of cultures within 
the Asian and Pacific Islander community 
reside here. Descendants from all around the 
Asian-Pacific region call our islands home. 
As a young Chamorro woman who is indig-
enous to these islands, this place means a 
significant amount to me. I take great pride 
in my roots and where I come from, for it is 
a source of my values, confidence, goals, and 
morals. But there’s one thing about my 
Chamorro identity that has always stuck out 
to me; I am a result of the perseverance of 
my people. Among the Pacific Islands, the 
Marianas has the longest history of colo-
nialism. To this day, we are still experi-
encing its lasting effects. As I grow and learn 
even more about my heritage, the more I 
have an understanding of who I am in this 
world. Each moment of understanding re-
minds me that because of my ancestor’s re-
silience, I want to live my life in fulfilling 
ways that would make them and my islands 
proud today. 
Being from the islands also means con-
necting and building friendships with people 
of different cultures, majority of them being 
from within the API community. Reflecting 
on these friendships made me realize how 
truly broad the term ‘‘API’’ is, almost like 
it’s a bigger picture. Despite all of us being 
boxed into this term, looking a bit closer and 
seeing the great amount of cultural diversity 
within this group makes you realize how 
beautifully inclusive it is. Without a doubt, 
there is a wealth of culture within the Asian- 
Pacific region, and it’s absolutely evident 
here in the Marianas. Being able to share our 
cultural stories, arts, and experiences with 
each other is, in my opinion, the best way to 
celebrate our similarities and differences 
this month. 
One unforgettable experience in regards to 
the sharing of my culture would be in 2016, 
where I went on a student exchange trip to 
Japan. I was in 6th grade at the time. For a 
couple of days, I stayed with a host family of 
four; one mom, one dad, one daughter, and 
one younger son. The mom was the only one 
who spoke English. I remember they’d take 
me to different places around their home-
town, such as restaurants, the park, and dif-
ferent Japanese sites. With them, I was able 
to experience firsthand what it was like to 
live in a Japanese household. 
One morning before the daughter had to go 
to school, she asked me to teach her some 
Chamorro words so that she could show them 
to her friends. I taught her a few simple 
phrases such as ‘‘Hafa Adai’’ and ‘‘Buenas 
Dias’’. Her mom translated for us, and she 
was able to write down these words on a 
notepad and take it with her to school. 
Having that experience at such a young 
age shaped the way I see culture today. It 
showed me that simply sharing our parts of 
the world and understanding each other’s 
background is, again, the best way to cele-
brate our cultural diversities. 
As we all know, May is a special month for 
us Asian and Pacific Islanders. It’s a month 
for us to celebrate our achievements, con-
tributions, and our heritage. It’s an occasion 
where many within the community open up 
about their experiences being Asian and/or 
Pacific Islander. Whether it be about the 
struggles or moments of contentment, it 
would be the time to listen to and grasp onto 
our words. Despite this month being named 
API Heritage Month, we shall continue to 
listen to and uplift each other’s voices even 
after May ends. All throughout time, we will 
celebrate diversity and unity. Thank you for 
reading.

THANKING PHILIP L. PARKER FOR 
HIS SERVICE TO THE GREATER 
DAYTON, OHIO REGION 
HON. MICHAEL R. TURNER 
OF OHIO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, June 8, 2021 
Mr. TURNER. Madam Speaker, I am hon-
ored to pay tribute to a respected community 
leader and trusted friend from my congres-
sional district, Philip L. Parker, for his out-
standing leadership and service to the busi-
ness community and the Greater Dayton, Ohio 
region. 
Phil Parker became president and CEO of 
the Dayton Area Chamber of Commerce on 
April 29, 1994 and retired on July 31, 2020. 
Before joining the Chamber, Phil was Execu-
tive Director of the Home Builders Association 
of Dayton and the Miami Valley. 
For nearly a half-century, Phil has worked to 
make the Miami Valley a better place to live, 
work, and raise a family. When I served as 
mayor of the city of Dayton, and throughout 
my time in Congress, Phil and I worked to-
gether on many issues and community 
projects to advance our shared goals of pro-
moting economic and job growth throughout 
Southwest Ohio. 
During his 26-year tenure as president and 
CEO of the Dayton Area Chamber of Com-
merce, Phil directed one of the 25 largest 
Chambers of Commerce in the nation. He 
oversaw the implementation of numerous 
transportation initiatives, such as the develop-
ment of Austin Boulevard and much-needed 
improvements of U.S. Route 35 and I–70. 
Under his leadership, the Dayton Area Cham-
ber was consistently recognized as one of the 
very best in the nation. In 1998, the Dayton 
Chamber was named Chamber of the Year by 
the Association of Chamber of Commerce Ex-
ecutives. 
Phil has been actively involved as a local, 
regional, state, and national volunteer, serving 
more than 500 volunteer hours a year over 
nearly 46 years. The generous amounts of 
time and energy he has contributed to a vari-
ety of volunteer and civic organizations, in-
cluding the Greater Dayton Jaycees, the 
United Way, and the American Red Cross, 
have benefited our entire community. 
Phil has served on more than 50 boards 
over the years and currently sits on a dozen 
local boards including Greene Memorial Hos-
pital, Soin Medical Center, Kettering College, 
and is a member of the Dayton Rotary Club. 
Madam Speaker, I appreciate this oppor-
tunity to extend my heartfelt congratulations to 
Phil Parker as he celebrates his retirement. I 
ask my colleagues to join me in thanking a 
truly outstanding citizen for his lifetime of serv-
ice to the people of Southwest Ohio. 
INTRODUCTION OF THE DISTRICT 
OF 
COLUMBIA 
FEDERAL 
OFFI-
CIALS RESIDENCY REQUIREMENT 
EQUALITY ACT 
HON. ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON 
OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, June 8, 2021 
Ms. NORTON. Madam Speaker, today, I in-
troduce the District of Columbia Federal Offi-
cials Residency Requirement Equality Act, 
which would require certain federal officials 
who serve the District of Columbia to live with-
in its boundaries. In nearly every other juris-
diction in the United States, federal district 
court judges, federal circuit court judges, U.S. 
Attorneys, U.S. Marshals and federal court 
clerks are required by federal law to reside 
within the jurisdictions where they have been 
appointed—but these same officials appointed 
to serve only the people of the District are not 
bound by this same requirement. Even in the 
territories, such officials are required to live in 
those jurisdictions, other than the U.S. Attor-
ney and U.S. Marshal appointed for the North-
ern Mariana Islands who at the same time are 
serving in the same capacity in another juris-
diction. The only other exceptions exist for 
such officials appointed to the Southern Dis-
trict of New York and the Eastern District of 
New York, which are the only districts that 
serve different parts of the same city. My bill 
would put the District on equal footing with al-
most every other jurisdiction by ensuring that 
our federal judges, U.S. Marshals, U.S. Attor-
ney and federal clerk live among the residents 
they have been appointed to serve, in keeping 
with the federal law that applies elsewhere in 
the United States. 
The requirement that these federal officials 
live in the jurisdictions they serve is signifi-
cantly related to knowledge of the effect of 
their decisions, an important reason the resi-
dency requirement is enshrined in federal law. 
As stated in the official commentary to the 
Code of Conduct for United States Judges, ‘‘a 
judge should not become isolated from the so-
ciety in which the judge lives.’’ The same 
holds true for other federal officials. My bill 
recognizes that the District deserves federal 
officials with the same understanding and links 
to the community as Congress has seen fit to 
require for federal officials in other jurisdic-
tions. 
I urge my colleagues to support this bill.

Mr. NEAL. Madam Speaker, I would like to 
take this opportunity to congratulate the Pope 
Francis Preparatory School Boys Ice Hockey 
Team on winning the 2021 U.S.A. Hockey 
High School Division I National Championship. 
This milestone achievement deserves the 
highest praise for the hard work and dedica-
tion of these exemplary athletes and coaches. 
Despite the countless challenges posed by 
this unprecedented season, the perseverance 
and commitment to success demonstrated 
throughout the year led their team to victory 
on the biggest stage in high school hockey. 
The 2021 U.S.A. Hockey High School Divi-
sion I Tournament brought twelve of the most 
elite high school hockey teams from across 
the country to compete for this year’s National 
Championship. Members of the Pope Francis 
Boys Ice Hockey Team not only performed 
with exceptional mental and physical fortitude, 
but also displayed remarkable sportsmanship 
and character on their path to victory. They 
represented the First District of Massachusetts 
with great honor and distinction, and I am con-
fident that the lessons learned during this 
once-in-a-lifetime opportunity will serve these 
young men well in their future endeavors. 
The Pope Francis Boys Ice Hockey Team 
was led by their Head Coach, Brian Foley, 
who has provided crucial guidance and instru-
mental mentorship to his young athletes both 
on and off the ice over the past eighteen sea-
sons. Coach Foley was assisted by Assistant 
Coaches Steve Ashe, Tim Keeney, and Dan 
Fenton, and the victorious student athletes are 
Matt

Zach

School Boys Ice Hockey Team for their superb 
achievement. I am proud of this group and I 
wish them much continued success.

HONORING SAM HOUSTON STATE 
UNIVERSITY’S ACHIEVEMENT OF 
ITS 1ST FCS CHAMPIONSHIP 
HON. KEVIN BRADY 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, June 8, 2021 
Mr. BRADY. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
recognize the Sam Houston State Bearkats 
and their first NCAA FCS title in program his-
tory. 
Throughout the season, the team faced 
countless unprecedented challenges. Due to 
the COVID-19 pandemic, the FCS football 
season was moved to Spring 2021. Addition-
ally, following the February Winter Freeze, 
players and coaches used feed shovels to 
clear snow off the field for practice. Mean-
while, due to renovations to the football facili-
ties, the Sam Houston St. players were with-
out locker room and shower facilities. 
Despite the season’s difficulties, Sam Hous-
ton State’s resilience made the year one that 
will not be soon forgotten. The Bearkats fin-
ished their regular season undefeated with a 
10–0 record. The team clinched its eighth 
Southland Conference championship. Addi-
tionally, coach K.C. Keeler won the Southland 
Conference Coach of the Year. With such a 
successful regular season, the Bearkats en-
tered the postseason with momentum and with 
the No. 2 seed in the FCS playoffs. 
After defeating Monmouth, South Dakota 
St., and James Madison, the Bearkats se-
cured their place in the FCS title game. The

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks
E619 
June 8, 2021 
Frisco, TX between the Sam Houston State 
Bearkats and the No. 1 seed South Dakota 
State Jackrabbits, was an instant classic. After 
a back and forth game, the Bearkats’ resil-
ience proved to be the difference. With only 
16 seconds left in the game, Eric Schmic 
found Ife Adeyi for a 10-yard touchdown to 
take the lead. With a 23–21 victory, Sam 
Houston St secured its first FCS Champion-
ship in program history. 
This was not only a first for Sam Houston 
State and Texas, but it was also a first for 
Coach K.C. Keeler, who became the first 
coach to win an FCS Championship at two dif-
ferent schools: first at the University of Dela-
ware and now at Sam Houston State. Coach 
Keeler also became the all-time winningest 
coach in FCS playoff history with 24 wins. The 
Bearkats’ Jequez Ezzard was also named the 
FCS Championship Game’s Most Outstanding 
Player. The team’s achievement will be long 
remembered. As Coach Keeler said to his 
team after the game: ‘‘It’s immortality for the 
rest of our lives and beyond that . . . Sam 
Houston State is the national champion.’’ 
I join the rest of the state of Texas in hon-
oring Sam Houston State and the Bearkats for 
their historic victory. They truly represent the 
best of Texas and its fighting spirit of strength 
and determination.
