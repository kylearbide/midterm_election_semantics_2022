REMEMBERING AMARI PRESIDENT 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
South Carolina (Mr. CUNNINGHAM) for 5 
minutes. 
Mr. CUNNINGHAM. Mr. Speaker, I 
rise today to honor the life of Amari 
President. 
Amari was only 16 years young when 
he passed, but his wisdom was already 
far beyond his years. Despite being too 
young to vote, he knew the importance 
of his civic duty to hold public officials 
accountable and to be involved in his 
local community. 
That involvement brought Amari 
into my life when he attended one of 
my very first townhalls and left me 
with a question. In my subsequent con-
versations with Amari, it was clear 
that his leadership and vibrancy were 
going to take him to big and wonderful 
places in life. 
Anyone who was lucky enough to 
know Amari knew his dreams were big 
but achievable for someone as bright 
and determined as him. You just knew 
Amari would find a way to achieve 
every single one of them, especially 
living up to his name and becoming a 
U.S. President one day. And he would 
have my vote. 
Beyond his ambition, his family 
knew Amari as compassionate, empa-
thetic, and driven to serve others. 
Amari wanted to spread kindness and 
joy wherever he went. He went the 
extra mile to be a beacon of light and 
knew how to brighten your day by 
sharing his warmth through a big grin. 
His 16 years have left an incredible 
imprint on the Lowcountry, and his 
legacy will be found in every heart that 
Amari touched, including mine. 
I mourn this tragic loss with his fam-
ily, his classmates, and the massive 
community that was blessed to know 
Amari and his greatness.

NATIONAL SMALL BUSINESS 
WEEK 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Pennsylvania (Mr. JOYCE) for 5 min-
utes. 
Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania. Mr. 
Speaker, during National Small Busi-
ness Week, I join with my fellow Amer-
icans 
in 
honoring 
workers, 
entre-
preneurs, and the small business com-
munity. 
From farms and factories to shops 
and cafes, small businesses employ 
hardworking Americans and provide 
important goods and services to their 
neighbors. In Pennsylvania and around 
the country, small businesses are not 
only the backbone of our economy, 
they are the heart our communities. 
This year, they have faced extraor-
dinary 
challenges. 
During 
the 
coronavirus crisis, many small busi-
nesses, following Federal, State, and 
local mandates, have been forced to 
radically change the way they do busi-
ness or even temporarily close their 
doors. 
As jobs were put into jeopardy, Con-
gress quickly acted to provide targeted 
relief to American families, workers, 
and 
small 
businesses. 
Under 
the 
CARES Act, the Paycheck Protection 
Program was enacted in record time. 
This unprecedented program served as 
a vital lifeline to millions of small 
businesses. Already, the Paycheck Pro-
tection Program has saved more than 
50 million jobs across our country. For 
those workers and their families, this 
policy is personal. 
Just last weekend, I stopped by 
Boyer Orchards in Bedford County. As I 
was waiting to buy their famous ap-
ples, I had the opportunity to speak to 
my fellow Penn Staters Matt and Ellen 
Boyer and their sons and all who work 
for them tirelessly to keep this family 
business running. 
Like many farms and orchards, they 
had tough choices when they lost busi-
ness during the coronavirus shutdown, 
through no fault of their own; but, 
thankfully, they had the support to 
make ends meet and, most impor-
tantly, to keep their hardworking team 
on the payroll. 
The Boyer family attributes the Pay-
check Protection Program with help-
ing them weather the storm, and they 
even called this program a godsend. 
Today, I am happy to report that the 
orchard is open and business is boom-
ing and the apples are plentiful. I can 
confirm that they were well worth the 
wait. 
As we celebrate the success of the 
Boyer family, I also recognize that

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4888 
September 24, 2020 
there are small businesses that are still 
struggling under the burdensome State 
and local mandates. 
The deadline to apply for Paycheck 
Protection Program support has, un-
fortunately, passed, and yet too many 
businesses remain closed or restricted. 
Some small business leaders are won-
dering how long they can survive. And, 
frankly, if we do not act, we risk losing 
them permanently. 
Most of our small businesses have 
been built by hardworking families 
over generations. Will Congress let this 
be their end? Will we allow families on 
Main Street to be used as bargaining 
chips in Washington? 
Mr. Speaker, we cannot permit small 
businesses to be wiped out by a virus. 
This is a time for choosing, and we in 
Congress must put politics aside and 
extend a lifeline to the American small 
businesses. 
Congressman STEVE CHABOT, the top 
Republican on the House Small Busi-
ness Committee, has introduced com-
monsense legislation that would reopen 
the Paycheck Protection Program, free 
up over $137 billion of unspent funds, 
and extend this program until the end 
of this year. This plan makes sense, 
and I encourage every Member of Con-
gress to support it. 
If 2020 has taught us anything, it is 
to plan for the unexpected. While many 
circumstances beyond our control re-
main uncertain, Congress has an oppor-
tunity now to offer small businesses se-
curity, and, most important, we have 
the chance to offer hope to these hard-
working Americans. 
As my friend Congressman CHABOT 
said earlier this week, our economy is 
depending upon America’s small busi-
nesses, and American small businesses 
are depending on us. 
This Small Business Week, there are 
livelihoods that are on the line. Amer-
ican families are counting on us. Amer-
ican workers are counting on us. It is 
time that we deliver for them. 
f 
REPUBLICANS ARE FAILING THE 
PEOPLE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Maryland (Mr. HOYER) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I am going 
to make some comments, but I want to 
just briefly remark about the gen-
tleman from Pennsylvania’s remarks 
about the PPP. 
That program was, of course, a bipar-
tisan program that was negotiated be-
tween Mr. CARDIN, Mr. RUBIO, and 
NYDIA
VELA´ ZQUEZ, the chair of the 
Small Business Committee here, who 
played a role. 
We passed the HEROES Act. We are 4 
months-plus from passing the HEROES 
Act, and the Senate has taken no ac-
tion. 
Now, one could say, well, the Senate 
hasn’t taken action because they can’t 
get the votes of the Democrats for a 
bill that we believe is woefully inad-
equate. I didn’t hear the gentleman 
talking about those people in food lines 
or the families who need that payment 
of $1,200 and dollars for children. I 
didn’t hear him say anything about the 
testing capability so we can stop this 
virus. 
I do not criticize him for mentioning 
the Chabot bill. I will tell my friends 
on the Republican side, I am hopeful 
that they are going to get the oppor-
tunity to vote either for an agreement 
between Secretary Mnuchin and Speak-
er PELOSI and Senator SCHUMER and 
others who choose to participate in the 
negotiations. 
I am very hopeful that we will have 
either an agreement or a bill that we 
can pass that I hope everybody on this 
floor votes for, which will deal with the 
problems I mentioned, with the chal-
lenges the gentleman from Pennsyl-
vania mentioned. But, of course, the 
response to HEROES was, from the Re-
publican leader in the Senate: Let the 
States go bankrupt. 
I don’t know whether anybody has 
any thoughts on, if the States go bank-
rupt, the impact that that will have on 
the fight against COVID–19. I think it 
would be substantial, including cities 
and localities and counties. 
So we have some time to go before we 
are leaving here, and we have time to 
address not only the challenge that Mr. 
JOYCE brings up, but the challenges of 
families and children, of people who 
are sick. 
All of us ought to be motivated by 
the fact that 200,000 of our fellow citi-
zens have died as a result of COVID–19. 
I am going to speak to that now. 
Mr. Speaker, this week, Democrats 
are coming to the floor to highlight the 
work we have been doing over the past 
2 years governing for the people, in 
sharp contrast with the way President 
Trump and Republicans have failed the 
people. 
First and foremost, they have failed 
our 
country 
by 
responding 
inad-
equately to the COVID–19 pandemic. 
Now, we started out with bipartisan 
action, 
and 
that 
was 
good, 
over-
whelming bipartisan action, Repub-
licans and Democrats responding to a 
crisis that was killing our people; and 
then, unfortunately, that bipartisan 
process fell apart. 
First and foremost, our Republican 
colleagues have failed our country by 
responding inadequately to the COVID– 
19 pandemic by not having the Senate 
respond to our bill and come to a con-
ference and try to get an agreement. In 
addition, when we tried to have nego-
tiations, as we had successfully had 
four times, they refused to come to the 
table. 
In February, President Trump told 
the American people that the virus, 
like a miracle, would disappear. He 
called criticism of his response to the 
virus a hoax. More than 200,000 Ameri-
cans have now died from that hoax. 
There has been no miracle. Criticism 
of that failure is no hoax. Other na-
tions’ governments have figured out 
how to slow the spread of the virus, yet 
this administration keeps failing and 
keeps contradicting our health pro-
viders and our experts. 
Based on our population, Mr. Speak-
er, if we had the same fatality rate for 
COVID–19 
as 
Australia—listen, 
my 
friends, to this figure. If we had the 
same fatality rate for COVID–19 as 
Australia, fewer than 11,000 Americans 
would have died, if we had had the 
same success rate. And if we had had 
the same rate as Japan, fewer than 
5,000 Americans would have lost their 
lives. 
Yet our President says we have han-
dled it the best of anybody in the 
world. The facts, of course, do not 
interfere with his conclusions. 
The Democratic-led House passed the 
HEROES Act in May—May 15, to be 
exact—more than 4 months ago. More 
than 110,000 Americans have died of 
COVID–19 during the 4 months that 
President Trump and the Republicans 
blocked the HEROES Act from helping 
us defeat this pandemic. 
In 
that 
same 
period, 
President 
Trump, who in 2011 criticized President 
Obama for playing golf, in that same 
period, President Trump left the White 
House to play golf as many as 30 
times—fiddling while Rome burned. 
That is eight times per month on aver-
age. 
What did President Trump say when 
asked in August about the rising fatali-
ties? ‘‘It is what it is.’’ 
How recklessly irresponsible, how 
callous and dismissive of people’s pain, 
and how indicative of a lack of decency 
and leadership. 
At the same time, President Trump 
and congressional Republicans have 
been working hard to eliminate access 
to affordable healthcare for millions of 
Americans and remove protections for 
more than 133 million people with pre-
existing conditions. And they say, of 
course: Oh, no. We are for preexisting 
conditions. We are just trying to get 
rid of the law that gives protection for 
preexisting conditions. 
Their lawsuit to overturn the Afford-
able Care Act comes amid a deadly 
pandemic worsened by their own fail-
ures. 
For 4 years, President Trump and Re-
publicans 
have 
been 
promising 
to 
unveil a secret plan that they say cov-
ers everybody. The President says: I 
am going to cover everybody—lower 
cost, higher quality. 
We have seen no such plan in 3 years 
and 8 months of this Presidency. That 
is because there is no Republican 
healthcare plan. They tried one early 
on. It failed. It failed because they 
couldn’t get a Republican vote—John 
McCain, who thought it wasn’t a real 
bill. 
As a matter of fact, the President, 
who hailed the bill at the White House 
as the most wonderful thing in the 
world, 2 weeks later, said: It was a 
mean bill.

September 24, 2020 
tell tens of millions of Americans: You 
are on your own. Sixty-five-some-odd 
votes to repeal the Affordable Care 
Act, no alternative have the Repub-
licans, even when they were in charge, 
adopted. 
As a result of President Trump and 
Republicans hitting pause, the minor-
ity leader of this House said: Let’s wait 
and see what happens. We have seen 
what happens, 110,000 additional people 
have died. 
As a result of President Trump and 
Republicans hitting pause on respond-
ing to the pandemic, tens of millions 
are out of work, critical support in the 
form of expanded unemployment insur-
ance was allowed to expire in July, and 
the unemployment rate has jumped 
from 4.7 to 8.4 percent. 
The Federal deficit has also sky-
rocketed as a result of these failures. 
During President Obama’s last full 
year in office it was $585 billion. Too 
high? Yes. But what is it now? $3.3 tril-
lion. It was the pandemic. Yes, cer-
tainly that is the case. 
It was the $1.5 trillion tax cut for the 
wealthiest in America. It was the pan-
demic. 
But it was the failure to respond in 
an effective way to what the President, 
in January, knew was a critically im-
portant health risk, and told the Amer-
ican people: Don’t worry, it is going to 
go away in just a few days. 
Our health and our economy are not 
the only things that are under threat 
from President Trump and his allies in 
Congress, 
our 
democracy 
is 
under 
threat as well. Even before he was 
sworn into office, the President had 
shattered the democratic norms that 
have made America strong and stable. 
As a candidate, he solicited campaign 
help from Russia. Send me those 
emails, Russia. Send it, in public, bra-
zenly. Help me Russia. 
And while in office, of course, he was 
impeached for soliciting help from 
Ukraine to help his reelection. 
Numerous Trump administration ap-
pointees and campaign officials have 
been convicted of crimes relating to 
Russia’s interference in the 2016 elec-
tion and lying to law enforcement. I 
guess we rationalize that if you are an 
ally of Trump, lying to law enforce-
ment is no problem. Paul Manafort. 
Michael Flynn. 
The President has refused to divest 
himself of his businesses and created 
massive conflicts of interest. Since 
2015, more than $16 million of taxpayer 
funds have been spent at President 
Trump’s own properties. 
This is a President for whom the law 
appears to mean little, for whom demo-
cratic norms appear to be nothing, and 
for whom personal power and enrich-
ment appear always to come first. 
Not America first, as he likes to say. 
Not for the people. 
Trump first. Himself above others 
and above the law. 
And Republicans in Congress, unfor-
tunately, and sadly, have been unwill-
ing to stand up and say the emperor 
has no clothes. 
Mr. Speaker, we have been working 
every day. We passed hundreds of bills. 
Minimum wage. You are on your own. 
Violence against women. You are on 
your own. Equality for all Americans. 
You are on your own. Voting rights for 
Americans. You are on your own. Sit-
ting 
unattended, 
unconsidered 
on 
MITCH MCCONNELL’s desk. 
Mr. Speaker, America is struggling, 
and what we ought to be doing is work-
ing together. And I am hopeful, as I 
said, in the next 5 to 6 days we get ei-
ther an agreement or a bill passed in 
this House that the Senate will pass. I 
am for either one of those options, but 
we must take one of them.

CELEBRATING THE BIRTHDAY OF 
ROSE BAYUK 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Minnesota (Mr. STAUBER) for 5 min-
utes. 
Mr. STAUBER. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to wish happy birthday to Rose 
Bayuk, who turns 105 on November 2. 
Rose served as a nurse during World 
War II and dedicated much of her life 
to caring for others. 
She grew up in Buhl, Minnesota. In 
1938, 
Rose 
graduated 
from 
Khaler 
School of Nursing in Rochester, Min-
nesota. Her diploma was signed and 
presented to her by the famous Mayo 
brothers themselves. 
Upon graduating, she moved to Cali-
fornia to begin her career. Shortly 
after moving, Pearl Harbor was at-
tacked, and Rose decided to serve her 
country by enlisting in the Army 
Nurse Corps. 
During the war, Rose made several 
crossings across the Atlantic on an 
English ocean liner, bringing home 
wounded from Italy, France, and North 
Africa. 
After her service, Rose continued a 
life of service by becoming a school 
nurse, and eventually the head of a 
nursing home. 
Rose now lives in White Bear Lake, 
Minnesota, where she stays active by 
going to the gym and playing bridge. 
Rose, thank you for your incredible 
service to our country, and I wish you 
the happiest of birthdays. 
CELEBRATING LIFESTONE HEALTH CARE 
Mr. STAUBER. Mr. Speaker, during 
National Small Business Week, I rise 
to honor Dr. Chiamaka Enemuoh, the 
owner of Lifestone Health Care, a busi-
ness located in Proctor, Minnesota, 
that is dedicated to providing compas-
sionate and reliable medical care for 
clients in a home-like setting. 
Lifestone opened in 2014 as a 2,000- 
foot house with five employees. Thanks 
to the strong leadership of its owner, 
Dr. Enemuoh, Lifestone staff and ca-
pacity doubled by 2016, allowing them 
to serve more in the community. In ad-
dition to her work at Lifestone, Dr. 
Enemuoh enjoys serving as a mentor to 
young African-American women in the 
community and volunteers much of her 
time at organizations like the Duluth 
Area Chamber of Commerce and Afri-
can Women’s Group. 
Due to the valuable services this 
business provides to the Northland and 
the dedication of Dr. Enemuoh, the 
Small Business Association recently 
named Lifestone Health Care as the 
2020 Minnesota Minority-Owned Small 
Business of the Year. 
Thank you to Dr. Enemuoh and the 
entire staff at Lifestone Health Care 
for providing excellent healthcare to 
the residents of Minnesota’s Eighth 
Congressional District. Your commit-
ment to our community serves as an 
inspiration to all. 
Mr. Speaker, entrepreneurs like Dr. 
Enemuoh are absolutely invaluable to 
our society. And as we continue to cel-
ebrate Small Business Week, we must 
also reinforce our commitment to em-
powering 
entrepreneurs 
like 
Dr. 
Enemuoh who create jobs, provide val-
uable services, and help drive our econ-
omy.

A MESSAGE ON THE PASSING OF 
RUTH BADER GINSBURG 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Michigan (Mr. LEVIN) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. LEVIN of Michigan. Mr. Speaker, 
I rise with a message on the passing of 
Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg that I 
shared with my beloved synagogue, 
Congregation T’chiyah, on Zoom dur-
ing Saturday’s Rosh Hashanah service 
just before we said the Mourner’s Kad-
dish. 
We have to resist what may be our 
first impulse over the loss of Justice 
Ginsburg, the horror of it. When people 
die, it is hard to step back from their 
circumstances, the circumstances of 
their death, in order to imbibe the les-
son of their life, isn’t it? Especially in 
circumstances like this. 
Instead, let us consider this woman. 
A tiny person. A modest person. A 
young wife who helped her husband 
with his schoolwork, only turning to 
her own in the middle of the night. A 
woman who, nevertheless, finished at 
the top of her law school class. A bril-
liant lawyer no law firm would hire be-
cause she had ovaries, and heaven for-
fend, was a mother. 
A person then pushed into teaching 
and given the space for advocacy. The 
system, by discriminating against her, 
set up a mighty campaign to fell dis-
crimination. 
The very architect of the assault 
against legal discrimination against 
women who, following in the footsteps 
of Thurgood Marshall, the lawyer, not 
the Justice, carefully disassembled the 
wall excluding women from all manner 
of rights, brick by carefully chosen 
brick. 
The appeals court judge who was not 
President Clinton’s first choice to join 
the Supreme Court, but who blew him 
away with her charismatic anti-cha-
risma, her directness, lack of artifice, 
and legal brilliance so plain that it 
shone Sun-like.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4890 
September 24, 2020 
For nearly three decades, a Supreme 
Court Justice who hammered out brave 
decisions and dissents that shone a 
light toward the future of dignity and 
justice for all, for which we all long, 
and on these High Holy Days we reaf-
firm faithfully is a possible and, in-
deed, necessary future. 
A teacher-Justice, who crafted these 
decisions in a manner not only meant 
to make law in the moment, but to 
teach future Justices, lawyers, and the 
general public how law and power func-
tion in the real world. 
In the end, the Justice-turned-icon, 
Notorious RBG, the most unlikely rock 
star, whose seeming diminutive frailty 
was the falsest thing about her, hiding 
a will of steel, that galloping mind, and 
a glint in her eye that told every girl: 
I am with you; and indeed: You are me; 
we are one. 
Why must we breathe in the full 
measure of this person before we turn 
to the tragedy of her death at this in-
credible low point in the history of our 
Nation? Why can’t we just turn with 
anxiety and determination to the next 
fight, the fight over RBG’s replace-
ment? Because in pausing to appreciate 
Ruth Bader Ginsburg fully, we see the 
importance of brilliant strategy and 
steely determination and good humor. 
Reflecting on her astounding accom-
plishments, we realize that justice can 
win in the end. Amidst our tears, we re-
alize we have no choice but to listen to 
her, and to John Lewis, and others we 
have lost in a moment of turmoil when 
we need them most, to study their 
ways, pick up their tools, and march on 
towards justice. 
You want a Rosh Hashanah that tests 
your faith? Try losing RBG to start 
things off. You want to make 5781 a 
year of hope and joy? Try taking im-
mense pride in the outsize accomplish-
ments of this tiny Jew and vowing to 
make her proud of us. Only then, after 
we immerse ourselves in prayer, reflec-
tion, and intention-setting, will we be 
fully ready to meet the coming mo-
ment. 
f 
IMF IN THE PANDEMIC 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Arkansas (Mr. HILL) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. HILL of Arkansas. Mr. Speaker, I 
rise today to raise awareness about an 
ongoing issue that is happening at the 
International Monetary Fund as it 
combats COVID–19. 
As the lead Republican on the Sub-
committee 
for 
National 
Security, 
International Development, and Mone-
tary Policy for the House Financial 
Services Committee, I invite your at-
tention to a bad policy proposal. 
During this time of crisis, the IMF 
provides financial assistance and debt 
service relief to its 189 member coun-
tries. As a part of the COVID relief, 
some 
IMF 
members, 
particularly 
China, have been lobbying for billions 
in extra relief through a new allocation 
of Special Drawing Rights, or SDRs. 
SDRs are an international reserve 
asset used to provide liquidity and sup-
plement countries’ official reserves. 
And unlike a typical IMF loan, Mr. 
Speaker, SDRs do not require repay-
ment. Now, this idea has gained trac-
tion 
among 
certain 
congressional 
Democrats, notably Senator DURBIN 
and Representatives WATERS and GAR-
CIA, who have proposed allocating no 
fewer than two trillion SDRs—equiva-
lent to $2.8 trillion—to the IMF’s mem-
ber countries. 
What the Democrats might not fully 
understand is that if the IMF were to 
allocate this additional two trillion 
SDRs, the allocation would be made in 
line with IMF shareholding weights, 
not financial need. 
This means that the bulk of SDRs 
would not go to the poorest countries 
with hundreds of billions of dollars in-
stead going to the richest nations in 
the world. 
b 0930 
Even worse, Mr. Speaker, $170 billion 
would go to China, $20 billion to Iran, 
$75 billion to Russia, $17 billion to 
Assad’s Syria, and $20 billion to the 
failed state in Venezuela. 
These billions would represent no- 
strings-attached 
liquidity 
for 
the 
world’s 
most 
brutal 
dictatorships. 
However, there is an alternate way to 
ensure the IMF is able to provide as-
sistance to countries that truly need 
it. 
The IMF has two trust funds that can 
lend or provide grants to the poorest 
and most vulnerable countries during 
emergencies, as we have with the pan-
demic. This is the proposal of House 
Republicans and of the Trump adminis-
tration. 
Preventing blanket SDR allocations 
demonstrates that the United States is 
a leader to help the poorest nations in 
the midst of this pandemic, but also a 
leader in accountability in our multi-
lateral institutions. A financial wind-
fall for terrorists and authoritarians is 
the wrong approach. 
HISTORIC BREAKTHROUGH FOR MIDDLE EAST 
PEACE 
Mr. HILL of Arkansas. Mr. Speaker, I 
was honored to attend the signing of 
the historic Abraham Accords at the 
White House, which represents a his-
toric breakthrough for peace in the 
Middle East. Bahrain and the UAE are 
the first Arab countries to normalize 
relations with Israel in two decades. 
I applaud President Trump, Prime 
Minister Netanyahu, Sheikh Moham-
med bin Zayed, and King Hamad Al 
Khalifa for coming together to achieve 
this critical milestone and step for-
ward. 
This achievement proves the success 
of President Trump’s undeniable sup-
port for the State of Israel and dedica-
tion to U.S. leadership in the region. 
I look forward to continuing to work 
with the administration and our allies 
around the world to build upon these 
agreements, develop deeper diplomatic 
ties, and strengthen our relationships. 
RECOGNIZING CANDACE FRANKS 
Mr. HILL of Arkansas. Mr. Speaker, I 
rise today to recognize the career of 
Candace Franks, who is retiring as the 
commissioner of the Arkansas State 
Bank Commission after 13 years in that 
top position and more than 40 years 
with the Arkansas State Bank Depart-
ment. I am proud to have known and 
worked alongside Candace for over a 
quarter century. 
Candace Franks has been a trail-
blazer in many regards. Candace is the 
first woman to serve as the Arkansas 
bank commissioner in its 107-year his-
tory, the first professional bank regu-
lator to serve in the position, and the 
longest serving commissioner as well. 
During Candace’s many years of serv-
ice, she has been a good steward for Ar-
kansas’ funds. In 1980, when she began 
her career, the institutions under the 
Arkansas State Bank Department held 
$7 billion in assets. Today, they hold 
more than $123 billion. 
In addition to her work as Arkansas 
bank commissioner, she serves as the 
chairman of the Conference of State 
Bank Supervisors, a member of the 
State Board of Finance, and a member 
of the Board of the Arkansas Teacher 
Retirement System. 
I thank Candace for her devotion.

HONORING LIFE OF FORMER NA-
TIONAL 
SECURITY 
ADVISOR 
BRENT SCOWCROFT 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
Florida (Mrs. MURPHY) for 5 minutes. 
Mrs. MURPHY of Florida. Mr. Speak-
er, I rise to honor an American patriot, 
a great and good man, and a hero of 
mine, Brent Scowcroft, who passed 
away recently. 
From humble roots, Brent rose to be-
come an Air Force general, the Na-
tional Security Advisor to two Presi-
dents, and a statesman whose counsel 
was sought by policymakers of all po-
litical stripes. 
After his passing, Brent’s family and 
friends held a ceremony to celebrate 
his life. They described Brent as an ex-
ceptional public servant who left an in-
delible stamp on U.S. foreign policy 
and on the National Security Council 
as an institution. 
Brent’s contributions as National Se-
curity Advisor may be his primary leg-
acy, but what I find most striking 
about the tributes to Brent are not 
what they say about him as a profes-
sional, but what they say about him as 
a person. 
As Stephen Hadley put it: ‘‘There are 
few people in Washington who were as 
respected and revered as Brent Scow-
croft. It was not just because of what 
he did. . . . It was because of who he 
was. A true gentleman . . . much loved 
by all who had the privilege of working 
with him.’’ 
Bob Gates noted that Brent was 
‘‘tough as nails on matters he cared 
about,’’ but also ‘‘the most decent, 
kindest, and humble person I have ever 
known.’’

September 24, 2020 
These words resonate with me be-
cause I was one of the many people who 
had the honor to call Brent a role 
model and a friend. Brent served as a 
mentor to multiple generations of men 
and women who valued his wisdom and 
sought to emulate his example. 
I met Brent between my sophomore 
and junior year of college when I in-
terned at The Scowcroft Group, a firm 
Brent founded after leaving govern-
ment. 
I was assigned to write a piece on the 
prospect of Russia selling missiles to 
Cyprus. I remember gingerly asking 
Brent for guidance in the way a young 
nobody 
approaches 
a 
distinguished 
somebody, expecting to be brushed off. 
He couldn’t have been kinder, patiently 
walking me through the intricacies of 
the issue, telling me stories about his 
experience negotiating with the Sovi-
ets, and making me feel at ease. 
It was these small acts of grace, re-
peated so many times, for so many peo-
ple, when nobody else was watching, 
that made Brent so special. 
Our first meeting was the start of a 
lifelong friendship that I cherished. 
Brent took more joy in the success of 
others than in his own success, and he 
genuinely cared about me, my family, 
and my career. 
I know how happy he was when his 
former intern became the first Viet-
namese-American woman ever elected 
to Congress. It made me proud to make 
him proud. 
In fact, it was Brent Scowcroft who 
is partially responsible for my decision 
to enter public service. As luck would 
have it, Brent gave the commencement 
speech at my college graduation. His 
message was about the importance of a 
strong but humble American leadership 
around the world. It was also about the 
value of public service, especially gov-
ernment service. 
Brent’s words stirred something in 
me. I was a refugee from Vietnam 
whose family’s life had been saved by 
the U.S. Navy. Brent’s speech made me 
realize that public service might be the 
best way for me to chisel away at the 
debt of gratitude I owed this country. 
I recalled that speech after 9/11, when 
I left my private-sector job, went to 
grad school, and on to work at the De-
partment of Defense. I also recalled 
that speech a decade later when I made 
what some might call a foolhardy deci-
sion to run for Congress. 
After Brent’s passing, I tracked down 
that speech. It wasn’t easy because 
Brent often wrote things by himself 
and then tended to throw them away, 
which was consistent with his unpre-
tentious character. 
Reading it again made me emotional, 
and it made me miss Brent. It still in-
spires me all these years later. In the 
speech, Brent asked me and my young 
classmates, our futures before us, to re-
flect on what we would like our epitaph 
to say after we drew our last breath. 
Then he offered this gentle advice: ‘‘I 
would hope that many of you would 
consider turning to public service. 
There is something enormously ful-
filling about being engaged in some-
thing bigger than you yourself. It im-
parts a satisfying sense of purpose 
which, in my experience, is not at-
tained in any other way. And there is a 
desperate need in this country for good 
people to man our government struc-
tures. I know it is getting more and 
more difficult to be a public servant. 
We have driven many of our best people 
away. But I ask you to consider public 
service, not because it is easy, but be-
cause it is hard, rewarding, and oh-so- 
necessary. How well the wonderful 
things this great Nation stands for will 
be preserved and projected will depend 
on the quality of people whose hands 
are on the helm of state.’’ 
This Nation was blessed to have 
Brent’s steady hands on the helm of 
state. 
Ginny Mulberger, one of Brent’s clos-
est friends and colleagues, said the 
word that best described Brent was 
‘‘devotion.’’ He was devoted to his 
country, his family, and his friends. 
His legacy will be carried forward by 
men and women he taught, mentored, 
and inspired to pursue public service. 
What better epitaph could there be? 
Rest in peace, General.

PROMISE OF OPERATION WARP 
SPEED 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
North Carolina (Ms. FOXX) for 5 min-
utes. 
Ms. FOXX of North Carolina. Mr. 
Speaker, Operation Warp Speed moves 
us closer to a cure for COVID–19. 
Thanks to President Trump, the ad-
ministration, and the private sector, a 
viable vaccine is now within reach. 
Operation Warp Speed has proceeded 
at an unprecedented pace, and it re-
flects a profound level of urgency. It is 
a 
direct 
reflection 
of 
President 
Trump’s commitment to protecting the 
American people. 
Taxpayers at the Federal level have 
committed over $10 billion to support 
the development of a vaccine, and the 
private sector has stepped up to meet 
this challenge head-on. 
Keep in mind that many vaccines and 
their subsequent clinical trials can 
take many years to complete. Without 
a doubt, we are closer to eradicating 
COVID–19 thanks to Operation Warp 
Speed. 
PROGROWTH POLICIES BENEFIT AMERICANS 
Ms. FOXX of North Carolina. Mr. 
Speaker, in a recent report released by 
the U.S. Census, it was revealed that 
the median household income in the 
United States rose by 6.8 percent in 
2019. I want to repeat that. The median 
household income in the United States 
rose by 6.8 percent in 2019. 
This was the highest annual increase 
on record, and it is all thanks to the 
commonsense, progrowth policies that 
are being led by President Trump and 
congressional Republicans. 
Not surprisingly, household incomes 
also grew 50 percent faster last year 
than the entire 8 years of the Obama 
administration. 
The good news doesn’t stop there. 
New small business applications in-
creased twice as much in President 
Trump’s first 2 years in office versus 
President Obama’s last 2. 
Mr. Speaker, it is quite evident that 
progrowth policies are the difference 
between inflating government bureauc-
racy and empowering American fami-
lies. It is just that simple. 
Mr. Speaker, on September 23, there 
was an article in The Washington 
Times titled ‘‘Trump creates jobs. 
Biden destroys them. It’s not com-
plicated,’’ and I include in the RECORD 
the article. 
TRUMP CREATES JOBS. BIDEN DESTROYS THEM. 
IT’S NOT COMPLICATED. 
Trump’s record proves that he knows how 
to create a strong economy. 
Donald Trump has proven that he knows 
what it takes to create jobs on a massive 
scale and ensure that prosperity is shared by 
all Americans. Democrat presidential nomi-
nee Joe Biden doesn’t even know how many 
letters are in the word ‘‘jobs.’’ 
President Trump’s record proves that he 
knows how to create a strong and growing 
economy that generates enormous oppor-
tunity for all Americans to succeed. Prior to 
the artificial contraction caused by the 
coronavirus pandemic, the national unem-
ployment rate had been consistently hov-
ering at a 50–year low, and joblessness had 
reached the lowest level ever recorded for 
both black and Hispanic workers. 
The president’s pro-growth economic poli-
cies played a major role in creating the 
strongest economy in history, which was a 
particularly impressive feat after eight years 
of stagnation under the Obama-Biden admin-
istration. The 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, 
for example, cut taxes for every income 
bracket, particularly benefitting middle-in-
come Americans. The tax bill also created 
Opportunity Zones, driving tens of billions of 
dollars in new investment to historically un-
derdeveloped communities in every state, 
providing jobs, housing, and infrastructure 
necessary to revive those communities. 
Mr. Trump’s emphasis on targeted deregu-
lation has also made it easier and more effi-
cient to create jobs and start new business 
ventures in this country.In 2012, halfway 
through the Obama-Biden era, federal regu-
lations were placing a massive burden on the 
small businesses that account for almost 
half of all jobs in this country, costing an av-
erage of $11,724 each year in regulatory com-
pliance costs for each new employee they 
hired. The Trump administration slashed 
tens of billions of dollars worth of harmful, 
job-killing 
regulations, 
saving 
American 
households over $3,000 per year on average. 
Mr. Biden, however, is vowing to undo these 
effective policies and replace them with even 
more crippling taxes and regulations than 
before, particularly on middle-income Amer-
icans. His proposals to eliminate entire in-
dustries such as fracking and increase the 
federal minimum wage to $15 per hour would 
be a blow to small- and medium-sized busi-
nesses that are only just getting back on 
their feet after months of pandemic-related 
lockdowns. 
We don’t have to take him at his word, 
though. Mr. Biden, a career politician who 
has spent nearly half a century in Wash-
ington, has a long history of supporting job- 
killing policies such as the North American 
Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), which cost 
Americans over a million jobs. Mr. Biden 
also supported normalizing trade relations

with China, paving the way for the repres-
sive communist country to secure member-
ship in the World Trade Organization (WTO), 
leading to the loss of over 60,000 American 
factories and millions more blue collar jobs. 
The former vice president clearly has no 
idea how to manage an economy, and his ex-
tensive record of bungling the job as both a 
senator and vice president proves it. Under 
the Obama-Biden administration’s job-kill-
ing policies, the American middle class expe-
rienced a double-whammy in the aftermath 
of the Great Recession, contributing to this 
country’s slowest economic recovery since 
World War II. 
While Mr. Biden was still struggling to pin-
point just how many letters are in the word 
‘‘jobs,’’ former President Obama entrusted 
him to manage the administration’s eco-
nomic recovery agenda—and it turned out to 
be a miserable failure. President Trump 
turned things around in a hurry once he took 
office, and he’s already working the same 
magic as he orchestrates a ‘‘V-shaped’’ re-
covery from the artificial coronavirus down-
turn. Results matter, and Donald Trump is 
the only candidate with a proven track 
record of delivering the sort of results the 
American people need.

CELEBRATING 78TH ANNIVERSARY 
OF CAMP PENDLETON 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
California (Mr. LEVIN) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. LEVIN of California. Mr. Speak-
er, I rise today to celebrate Camp Pen-
dleton’s 78th anniversary. 
In 1942, the Marine Corps began con-
struction on a new base north of Camp 
Elliott in San Diego. When it was 
ready, 
the 
9th 
Marine 
Regiment 
marched north from Camp Elliott to 
the new base at the former Rancho 
Santa Margarita. 
On September 25, 1942, President 
Franklin Roosevelt named the base 
Camp Pendleton in honor of World War 
I Major General Joseph H. Pendleton. 
As a key amphibious training base, 
Camp Pendleton is crucial to the Ma-
rine Corps in advancing and sustaining 
the readiness of operations forces. 
Since World War II, Camp Pendleton 
has served as a major training base 
used by Marine forces before deploying 
into combat, and I am proud of the role 
that they have played in defending our 
country. 
After the horrific attacks on Sep-
tember 11, Camp Pendleton provided 
crucial training to the Army, Army 
National Guard units, and allied forces, 
who deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan. 
Camp Pendleton isn’t just a military 
base; it is a vital part of our commu-
nity throughout the 49th District. The 
military families and veterans who live 
on and around the base make our dis-
trict a special place, and I am proud to 
serve them in Congress. 
Those families are also just one of 
the reasons why serving on the House 
Veterans’ Affairs Committee is so im-
portant to me. 
I have made the well-being of our 
veterans and servicemembers one of 
my top priorities in Congress. They 
have sacrificed for our freedom, and it 
is our responsibility to honor that sac-
rifice by supporting them in civilian 
life. 
Once again, I am honored to rep-
resent Camp Pendleton and the fami-
lies who call it home. 
Happy birthday, Camp Pendleton. 
f 
HONORING DON CORAM 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Colorado (Mr. TIPTON) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. TIPTON. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today 
to 
honor 
Don 
Coram 
of 
Montrose, Colorado. 
Don was born in Montrose and raised 
in a farming and ranching family. He 
has been married to his wife, Dianna, 
for 53 years. Together, they have a son, 
Dee. 
Don’s agricultural background pro-
vided him with a thorough under-
standing of the unique needs of the 
communities on the Western Slope 
that led him to be a successful busi-
nessman and a well-respected elected 
official. 
Don began his career in public serv-
ice first as a county commissioner, 
later serving in the Colorado State 
House and, most recently, as a Colo-
rado State senator. 
At the Colorado Capitol, he has ex-
tensive influence in crafting legislation 
to preserve and to protect water rights, 
bringing resources to local agencies to 
more effectively prevent and combat 
wildfires 
and 
revitalize 
investment 
into Main Streets across the State. 
Don consistently works with his col-
leagues across the aisle on common-
sense policies, which has earned him 
high remarks from legislators from all 
four corners of the State. 
b 0945 
Don’s 
leadership, 
experience, 
and 
knowledge of rural interests and needs 
have helped him to advance legislation 
that have no doubt improved the lives 
of thousands of families and businesses 
and communities throughout western 
Colorado. 
While he would never admit it, Don is 
a role model for others. For decades, he 
has selflessly supported local causes by 
serving on the school board, the Delta- 
Montrose Vocational Center, volun-
teering for nonprofits, and actively 
participating with several other local 
organizations. 
Don’s efforts to serve his community 
reach all the way to Washington. He 
has been a trusted adviser to me on nu-
merous pieces of legislation and always 
puts thoughtful consideration in any 
time I ask for his input. Don has been 
a great leader for the Third District 
during my tenure in Congress, and he 
is personally a good and loyal friend. 
Mr. Speaker, I would like to give my 
utmost praise to Don for his compas-
sionate service to our great State and 
the Nation over the years, and I wish 
him and his wife, Dianna, the best as 
they continue their work to be able to 
improve the quality of life in commu-
nities throughout the West Slope. 
HONORING DIANNA CORAM 
Mr. TIPTON. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to honor Dianna Coram of 
Montrose, Colorado, for her lifelong 
service to her community and to the 
State of Colorado. 
Born during the middle of a blizzard 
on her grandfather’s farm, Dianna is a 
third-generation Coloradan who truly 
embodies the unique spirit of western 
Colorado. 
Dianna has been a loving wife for 
over 53 years to her husband, Don, with 
whom they have one son, Dee. Her hus-
band, Don, noted to me that, of those 
53 years, 35 of those years have been 
happy. 
Dianna spent most of her adult life 
building a reputation as a respected 
figure in Delta and Montrose, where 
she spends much of her time strength-
ening and improving her community 
through her dedicated volunteer work 
with nonprofits, the local school, coun-
ty fairs, and organizations such as the 
Dolphin House, the Boys & Girls Club, 
Downtown Improvement Group, the 
San Juan Cancer Center, and currently 
serves as the Third Congressional Dis-
trict representative on the Colorado 
State Fair Board. 
Dianna’s reputation reaches far be-
yond the West Slope. If you visit the 
Colorado State Capitol and mention 
the name Dianna Coram, legislators 
and staff from both sides of the aisle 
will give a smile and be quick to share 
a story of her. 
Dianna is always front and center in 
the political arena within the Third 
District, where she has been active 
since the young age of 14. It was then 
she could very well have been the only 
person of her age to be found walking 
the streets of Montrose with a ‘‘Barry 
Goldwater for President’’ sign. 
A few years back, when the Montrose 
Chapter of Republican Women’s future 
was at stake, Dianna stepped forward 
as soon as their president resigned. 
Since then, her work has paid divi-
dends, where, just this past year, it was 
the only chapter in Colorado to receive 
the Gold Achievement Award. 
Mr. Speaker, it is truly an honor to 
recognize Dianna for her hard work for 
her community. Like so many others 
who have had the privilege to be able 
to know her, I will always be grateful 
for her friendship to my wife, Jean, and 
me. 
Her service to the State of Colorado 
and the Third Congressional District is 
truly appreciated by so many who have 
gotten to know her over the years. I 
stand with the residents of Montrose in 
congratulating Dianna for her achieve-
ments, and I look forward to her con-
tinued success as a community leader.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4893 
September 24, 2020 
Ms. KUSTER of New Hampshire. Mr. 
Speaker, today I rise to speak in sup-
port of legislation we considered ear-
lier this week, the Scarlett’s Sunshine 
on Sudden Unexpected Death Act. 
More importantly, today I rise in the 
memory of my great-niece, Lia, who 
died from SIDS just 2 years ago. As her 
mother and grandmother, my sister, 
said: Our family will never be the 
same. 
Lia is with me in my heart and in the 
work we do in Congress every day. She 
turned out to be a formidable advocate 
at just 6 months of life. 
Each year, roughly 3,500 infants trag-
ically die from sudden unexpected 
death in the United States, impacting 
families across this country in un-
imaginable ways. 
While the incidence of SIDS has de-
clined by more than 50 percent since 
the 1990s, we still have so much work 
to do to better understand the cause of 
sudden unexpected death syndrome and 
advance research that can develop pre-
vention strategies and further reduce 
infant mortality in America. 
The bipartisan legislation that the 
House passed this week, the Scarlett’s 
Sunshine on Unexpected Death Act, is 
a comprehensive approach to improv-
ing national guidelines and data con-
sistency for sudden infant death and 
sudden unexpected death for children. 
It also offers support for the families 
grieving their loss and supports evi-
dence-based approaches for outreach to 
decrease risk factors. 
I am a proud sponsor of this bill for 
my great-niece Lia, and I am pleased to 
see the House advance this important 
legislation this week. 
HONORING SUPREME COURT JUSTICE RUTH 
BADER GINSBURG 
Ms. KUSTER of New Hampshire. Mr. 
Speaker, today I rise to honor and 
commemorate the life of Ruth Bader 
Ginsburg, the ‘‘Notorious RBG.’’ 
As Americans across the country 
mourn this tremendous loss, we look 
back on an amazing life and an ex-
traordinary career that so clearly 
shaped the world we live in today. 
Ruth Bader Ginsburg was a trail-
blazer for gender equality, a brilliant 
jurist who wrote some of our country’s 
most important legal opinions, and a 
fierce defender of women’s rights. Her 
presence, her grace, indeed, her cour-
age on the Court will be missed by all 
who cherished her advocacy. 
As only the second woman to serve 
on the highest court in the land, Jus-
tice Ginsburg inspired a generation of 
women—my generation—to join her ef-
forts in creating a more perfect union 
and combating injustice that lurked in 
every corner of our country. 
From authoring the Court’s opinion 
in landmark cases that struck down 
laws discriminating against women to 
issuing blistering dissent in cases like 
Ledbetter v. Goodyear, where she be-
lieved the Court was failing to address 
pay discrimination in the workplace, 
Justice Ginsburg’s voice on the Su-
preme Court represented the life expe-
riences of so many American women. 
Justice Ginsburg led a full and mean-
ingful life, and her chapter in Amer-
ican history will be earmarked for gen-
erations to come. It is now up to all of 
us to complete the work unfulfilled 
and, in her words: ‘‘Fight for the things 
you care about, but do it in a way that 
will lead others to join you.’’ 
Justice Ginsburg has passed the 
torch, and now it is up to us. 
f 
RESTORE, REBUILD, RENEW 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Pennsylvania (Mr. THOMPSON) for 5 
minutes. 
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. 
Mr. 
Speaker, 
our 
country 
has 
undoubtably 
been 
rocked 
by 
coronavirus. The pandemic has put a 
strain on our physical, mental, and fi-
nancial health. 
As time has passed, it has been easy 
to focus on the negative; however, I am 
encouraged by the work I have seen 
from my House Republican colleagues. 
Instead of playing partisan politics, I 
have seen a commitment to America. I 
have seen a concerted effort to renew 
the American Dream, restore our way 
of life, and rebuild the greatest econ-
omy ever. 
America is worth fighting for, and 
while the pandemic is currently at the 
forefront of our minds, there is a bright 
future ahead of us all. We will rise from 
this crisis thanks to the resiliency, the 
grit, and the determination of the 
American people. 
Renewing the American Dream can 
mean a lot of different things. To me, 
it starts with two things: broadband 
connectivity and a capable, trained 
workforce. 
In 21st century America, reliable 
connectivity is something many of us 
take for granted. Just like flipping the 
switch to turn on your lights, we have 
come to expect reliable, fast, uninter-
rupted access to the internet. 
Still, many communities across the 
country don’t have reliable broadband 
connectivity, 
particularly 
in 
rural 
America. 
In time, the coronavirus will be a 
thing of the past, but our national need 
for reliable broadband connectivity is 
not going anywhere. Connectivity im-
pacts every aspect of our lives: com-
merce, education, healthcare, precision 
agriculture, and more. We can and 
must invest in this critical infrastruc-
ture. 
We must also invest in career and 
technical education opportunities. 
Just prior to the pandemic, there 
were nearly 7 million job openings 
across the country. Contrasting that 
figure with the potential of our Na-
tion’s learners, whether they are enter-
ing the workforce for the first time, 
learning a new skill, or reentering the 
workforce after some time away, there 
is an obvious disconnect. This is often 
referred to as the ‘‘skills gap,’’ and 
CTE is a proven way to bridge this di-
vide. 
A one-size-fits-all approach to edu-
cation is not an effective way to pre-
pare students for the workforce, and 
CTE should not be viewed as plan B. It 
is a valuable educational option that 
empowers learners of all ages to take 
control of their personal and their pro-
fessional futures. 
Restoring our way of life includes de-
feating this virus and keeping America 
healthy. Thanks to President Trump’s 
leadership, Operation Warp Speed has 
placed us light-years ahead in research-
ing, developing, and, soon, admin-
istering a coronavirus vaccine. The 
President has unleashed the power of 
the private sector to partner with the 
Department of Health and Human 
Services, as well as the Department of 
Defense, to help eradicate the virus. 
Prior to the pandemic, we had built 
the greatest economy this country has 
ever seen, and we will rebuild it. We 
have done it once, and we can do it 
again with America-first trade policies 
and 
by 
strengthening 
our 
supply 
chain—that means a strong manufac-
turing sector that helps America stay 
competitive—and supporting legisla-
tion that strengthens the supply chain 
and bolsters our Nation’s potential for 
a prosperous future by keeping good- 
paying, family-sustaining jobs right 
here at home. 
Now I am confident that we can and 
will defeat this virus and renew the 
American Dream, restore our way of 
life, and rebuild our economy.

JUSTICE FOR BREONNA TAYLOR 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Texas (Mr. GREEN) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, 
and still I rise. 
Mr. Speaker, and still I rise in the 
name of justice for Breonna Taylor. 
Mr. Speaker, it has been widely re-
ported that the death of Breonna Tay-
lor is a tragedy. Her death is being re-
ported as a tragedy: a tragedy because 
she was innocent, she committed no 
crime; a tragedy because it happened in 
her home in the midnight hour; a trag-
edy because she was unarmed. It has 
been reported that her death was a 
tragedy. 
But there is a question, Mr. Speaker, 
about her death that we have to ask 
that few want to hear, because few 
want to consider the answer. But this 
is the preeminent question as it relates 
to her death, a question that will haunt 
us because of the history that we have 
with race relations in this country. 
We have to ask the question. It is a 
question that the status quo doesn’t 
want to hear, because the status quo is 
concerned about the answer. It is a 
question that deals with systemic dis-
crimination. 
Today I ask the question: If Breonna 
Taylor were a 26-year-old innocent 
White woman—innocent White woman, 
innocent White woman—who was killed 
in the middle of the night when Black 
police officers intruded into her home,

HONORING THE LIFE OF SANDEEP 
DHALIWAL 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Florida (Mr. YOHO) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. YOHO. Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
to honor the life and legacy of Sheriff 
Sandeep Dhaliwal who was tragically 
and senselessly killed in the line of 
duty last year, September 27, 2019. 
Deputy Dhaliwal was the first ob-
servant Sikh to serve in Harris County 
Sheriff’s Office and was the first Sikh 
American in Texas to receive a policy 
accommodation to wear articles of 
faith, including his turban and beard, 
while serving. 
His story is an American story. Born 
in India, he moved to Houston, Texas, 
at an early age with his parents. He 
started a successful business but felt 
called to serve and build better rela-
tions and understanding between the 
Sikh and all greater-Houston commu-
nities. 
He was a beloved husband, father, 
and son who selflessly served others 
and was a role model to all who knew 
him. Like many of the brave men and 
women in law enforcement who put on 
the uniform to protect and serve com-
munities across our great Nation, Dep-
uty Sandeep Dhaliwal is a hero. 
HONORING THE LIFE OF SERGEANT ERIC 
TWISDALE 
Mr. YOHO. Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
to honor the life of Clay County Sheriff 
Sergeant Eric Twisdale who passed 
away 
due 
to 
complications 
from 
COVID–19. 
Anyone who knew Sergeant Twisdale 
said he was committed to serving the 
community. Throughout his 28 years of 
active service, he showed that commit-
ment and was rewarded, receiving sev-
eral awards, including the Lifesaving 
Award in 2014 for saving a person from 
drowning. 
He was honored as the 2015 Deputy of 
the Year for displaying exceptional 
valor while helping stop two murder 
suspects during a high-speed chase 
through several counties. 
There is a common thread that runs 
through our Nation’s law enforcement 
community: courage, and selfless serv-
ice to others. 
Sergeant Twisdale most certainly 
possessed both in abundance. He is sur-
vived by his children, many grand-
children, and family members. 
I thank Sergeant Twisdale for his 
service and for keeping our community 
safe. He will be missed. 
CELEBRATING THE OPENING OF MIDDLEBURG VA 
CLINIC 
Mr. YOHO. Mr. Speaker, I rise to rec-
ognize the critical work being done by 
our VA health centers in Florida’s 
Third Congressional District, and spe-
cifically to congratulate the opening of 
the new Middleburg VA Clinic. 
On September 15, the Middleburg VA 
Clinic opened to patients. The clinic is 
vital for the health and well-being of so 
many veterans who call Clay County 
home. 
Before the state-of-the-art facility 
opened, I introduced a bill with the en-
tire Florida delegation that would 
name this clinic after Naval Chief 
Petty Officer Andrew Baker, a former 
Clay County resident and American 
hero who lost his life while serving our 
country. 
During these turbulent times, we 
must never forget to honor those who 
serve and protect our fellow citizens 
and the Constitution from enemies 
both foreign and domestic. 
CONGRATULATING UNIVERSITY OF FLORIDA ON 
NUMBER 6 RANKING FOR PUBLIC UNIVERSITIES 
Mr. YOHO. Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
as a proud Florida Gator. In the last 
‘‘Best Colleges’’ edition of the U.S. 
News & World Report, the University 
of Florida was named the number 6 
public university in the country. That 
ranking marks the fourth—I want to 
repeat that, that ranking marks the 
fourth—consecutive year the Univer-
sity 
of 
Florida 
has 
risen 
in 
the 
rankings for public universities, jump-
ing from number 14 in 2017 to number 6 
today. 
UF is one of the finest research uni-
versities in the United States, attract-
ing the best and brightest from around 
the great State of Florida, America, 
and the world. 
I want to congratulate President 
Kent Fuchs, his staff, the faculty, stu-
dent body, and the board of trustees for 
their collective efforts in continuing to 
elevate the University of Florida to 
higher and higher rankings. 
And I can’t end without saying: Go 
Gators. 
SUPPORTING FIRST RESPONDERS AND LAW 
ENFORCEMENT 
Mr. YOHO. Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
to recognize and show my support for 
our Nation’s first responders and law 
enforcement officials. 
On September 14, we witnessed the 
assassination attempt of two Los Ange-
les County sheriff deputies in Compton, 
California. 
Just yesterday, we saw two more at-
tacked in Louisville. As I speak on this 
floor, the 31-year-old female and 24- 
year-old male deputies who were bru-
tally ambushed, thankfully, have been 
released from the hospital. 
The 
officers 
attacked 
yesterday, 
hopefully, will survive also. The sup-
port from across the country for these 
heroes is inspiring, even as the leftwing 
radicals shouted obscenities outside 
the hospital and yelled they hoped the 
officers would die. 
While the President pursues noble ac-
tion through peace accords in the Mid-
dle East, the Democratic Party cannot 
find its voice in admonishing domestic 
terrorists targeting our brave law en-
forcement officers across the country. 
I stand with the President, with our 
law enforcement, and with the founda-
tion of this country—respect for life, 
defense of liberty, and the protection of 
property. 
f 
SUPPORT PUBLIC SCHOOLS 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. 
HORSFORD). The Chair recognizes the 
gentlewoman from New York (Ms. 
VELA´ ZQUEZ) for 5 minutes. 
Ms. VELA´ ZQUEZ. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
to express support for our Nation’s pub-
lic school systems, particularly, our K– 
12 institutions that are grappling with 
a frightening reality. 
Unfortunately, the coronavirus pan-
demic has posed an unprecedented 
threat to our schools and without addi-
tional further assistance, they cannot 
afford to take necessary safety meas-
ures to reopen. 
For example, according to a recent 
Government Accountability Office re-
port, 4 of 10 districts need to update or 
replace HVAC systems in at least half 
of their school buildings. The Centers 
for Disease Control and Prevention has 
identified proper ventilation as a key 
consideration for schools seeking to re-
open safely. 
Today, it has been 6 months since 
New York City Public Schools and 
many others across the Nation were 
shuttered. The decision to close our 
schools was necessary and slowed the 
disease’s spread, saving lives. 
However, I understand this was a dif-
ficult decision for many families be-
cause of the vital support services that 
schools provide. 
Not only is the school system where 
young people learn, but they also serve 
as a vital community anchor, providing 
nutritional 
assistance, 
special 
edu-
cation, teacher support, and childcare. 
We all want schools to reopen for our 
students, but it must be done safely, 
and that requires additional Federal 
resources. 
In 
March, 
the 
Families 
First 
Coronavirus Response Act and the 
Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic 
Security, or CARES Act, were signed 
into law. Both measures help address 
the urgent challenges facing every part 
of our education system. These funds 
help educators adjust to long-term 
school closures, fund purchases for on-
line learning materials, and provide a 
lifeline for public schools. 
While the relief bills enacted so far 
took steps in the right direction, the 
magnitude of this pandemic demands 
more. Four months ago, the House 
passed the HEROES Act which will go 
even further. Without the HEROES 
Act, budget shortfalls are projected to 
reach nearly $500 billion for State gov-
ernments alone. 
The Senate’s inaction has resulted in 
no relief for State and local govern-
ments, which are now being forced to 
make deep cuts to public education. 
Without significant Federal funding, 
our schools cannot upgrade buildings, 
provide PPE, continue virtual or blend-
ed learning, and, ultimately, safely re-
open. 
As the public health crisis has wors-
ened since the passage of the HEROES

Act, the amount of funding needed to 
repair and modernize school facilities 
for the safe reopening has grown. My 
colleagues and I are now fighting for 
$300 billion to safely reopen our schools 
and maintain services for students. 
Today, I am calling on the Senate to 
act immediately and pass a comprehen-
sive relief package that provides sig-
nificant resources to safely reopen our 
schools and protect students, staff, and 
families. 
We must guarantee the academic 
achievement and basic development 
needs of our youth. However, we must 
also care for the safety and the mental 
and physical health of our students, 
educators, staff, and families. 
At every level of government, we 
must do more for our teachers, our 
school administrators, and the families 
who depend on critical services pro-
vided by our public school system. 
That is why the Senate needs to stop 
obstructing and pass meaningful legis-
lation for our Nation’s families. 
f 
PROMOTING FARM AND 
AGRICULTURAL WORKER SAFETY 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Minnesota (Mr. HAGEDORN) for 5 min-
utes. 
Mr. HAGEDORN. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today in support of bipartisan legisla-
tion, the Farm and Agricultural Work-
er Safety Education Act, which I am 
proud to introduce with my friend from 
Texas (Mr. CUELLAR). 
The coronavirus pandemic has high-
lighted the need to ensure that we have 
a safe and reliable workforce to main-
tain our food supply. In order to win 
the battle with COVID–19, we must 
guarantee that the most up-to-date and 
science-based information is readily 
available and accessible for community 
leaders, educators, and rural busi-
nesses. 
Our legislation will help guarantee 
that timely, relevant health and safety 
guidelines are reaching our rural work-
force and communities by allowing 
higher learning institutions to apply 
for grants to distribute best practices 
and safety guidance to help farms, ag 
workers, and others who conduct busi-
ness during this pandemic. 
When we think about best practices 
and safety in the rural areas, we often 
think about tractor accidents and how 
to stop the farmers from being hurt in 
grain bin incidents and things of that 
nature. 
We haven’t really delved into this 
idea that we have to look at the health 
of our employees, the workers who are 
in the packing plants, the folks driving 
the trucks, the people at the distribu-
tion plants, and the people on the 
farms. 
b 1015 
We have learned during this pan-
demic that when our health workers 
and when our workers on the farms and 
everything are in trouble, we are in 
trouble. We had shortages in our gro-
cery stores of meat products, and that 
was not due to any problems having a 
supply of hogs, for instance. We had ex-
cess supply. But the folks who did the 
work at the packing plants were down, 
and we had disruptions, which led to 
those types of shortages. 
So to make sure that we ensure our 
food supply and that we have everyone 
in as safe a condition as possible, we 
want to have these grants and best 
practices moving forward. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues on 
both sides of the aisle to join me in 
supporting this important initiative 
that will help ensure the safety of our 
farmers in rural communities as we 
work to keep rebuilding our economy.

RECOGNIZING OFFICER BLAKE 
CRULL 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Indiana (Mr. PENCE) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. PENCE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
to recognize Sixth District hero Green-
field Police Officer Blake Crull. 
Officer Crull was on a routine patrol 
when he saw a flipped car on fire. He 
sprang into action and ran toward the 
danger. With no regard for his personal 
safety, Officer Crull saved a woman 
from the burning car, which exploded 
mere moments later. 
Brave acts such as Officer Crull’s are 
the very reason I will always back the 
blue and never defund the police. I 
thank Officer Crull for his courageous 
and brave service to our community. 
FIGHTING FOR CONSERVATIVE PRINCIPLES 
Mr. PENCE. Mr. Speaker, as Indi-
ana’s Sixth District Representative, it 
is my duty to fight for the conservative 
Hoosier principles on which my con-
stituents sent me to Washington. 
My Republican colleagues and I are 
committed to the American people. We 
will renew the American Dream. We 
achieve this by making sure students 
can attend a great school, no matter 
their ZIP Code, by honoring the service 
of our veterans with good healthcare 
and job opportunities, and by sup-
porting technical education. 
We will restore our way of life. We 
achieve this by defeating COVID–19, by 
defending our police and not defunding 
them, and by upholding our constitu-
tional rights. 
We will rebuild the greatest economy 
our Nation has ever seen. We achieve 
this by getting Americans back to 
work, by ending our dependence on 
China, and by upgrading America’s in-
frastructure. 
Mr. Speaker, America is worth fight-
ing for. This is our commitment to 
America. 
AMERICAN SOYBEAN ASSOCIATION CENTENNIAL 
Mr. PENCE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
to recognize the American Soybean As-
sociation centennial celebration. 
One hundred years ago, the American 
Soybean Association was started in my 
home State of Indiana at Soyland 
Farms in Camden. Today, the associa-
tion advocates for our great soybean 
farmers while promoting the growth of 
the U.S. soybean industry, a thriving 
Hoosier asset and industry. 
Congratulations to the association 
on its 100th year. As a supporter of the 
ag industry, I wish them the best of 
luck in the next 100 years. 
RECOGNIZING FUTURE OF WORK 
Mr. PENCE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
to recognize the Future of Work initia-
tive in Muncie, Indiana, for its leader-
ship in the 21st century workforce de-
velopment. 
The Future of Work organization in-
cludes Innovation Connector, Ivy Tech 
Community College, Ball State Univer-
sity, Purdue Polytechnic, Muncie-Dela-
ware County Economic Development, 
Muncie Community Schools, Eastern 
Indiana Works, Ball Brothers Founda-
tion, and East Central Indiana Re-
gional Partnership. 
It is paving the way for students and 
jobseekers to prepare for careers in 
technology, engineering, and manufac-
turing. I thank Future of Work for 
helping 
young 
Americans 
develop 
skills to join the 21st century work-
force. 
SUPPORTING SECOND AMENDMENT 
Mr. PENCE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
to give my proud support of the Second 
Amendment. 
The Constitution affords the right of 
the people to keep and bear arms, and 
that shall not be infringed. 
As a lifetime member of the NRA, I 
understand what it is like to have your 
constitutional 
rights 
attacked. 
We 
take a look at the riots, looting, and 
danger right here on our own front 
doorsteps, and we see that the ability 
to protect our families and ourselves 
has never been more important. 
As the Representative from Indiana’s 
Sixth District, I promise to uphold the 
Constitution. 
APPLAUDING TRUMP ADMINISTRATION’S 
SUPPORT OF FARMERS 
Mr. PENCE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
to applaud the Trump administration’s 
commitment to our great American 
farmers. 
This week, the USDA announced $14 
billion for agricultural producers who 
continue to face market disruptions 
and associated costs due to COVID–19. 
President Trump made a promise to 
put American farmers first, and he is 
doing just that. This commitment to 
farmers has helped the hardworking 
Sixth District Hoosier farmers who 
have been impacted by this pandemic. 
Our ag community feeds this Nation, 
and I applaud the Trump administra-
tion’s unwavering support.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4896 
September 24, 2020 
CARES Act, which was passed by this 
body, undoubtedly one of the most suc-
cessful was the PPP, the Paycheck 
Protection Program, which literally 
helped thousands of small businesses 
and over 50 million jobs be saved dur-
ing the COVID pandemic. 
The PPP was also successful because 
it partnered with the private sector, 
utilizing local banks to disburse the 
PPP loans. Often these banks already 
had existing relationships with the 
small businesses in their communities. 
These existing relationships between 
banks and small businesses were in-
valuable in getting these funds out 
onto the street in record speed—again, 
saving thousands of businesses and mil-
lions of jobs. In my district alone, PPP 
saved over 50,000 jobs. 
It is due to the success of the PPP 
and the significant need for additional 
PPP funds for small businesses around 
the Nation that I rise in support of 
H.R. 8265, sponsored by Representative 
CHABOT. 
This is a very commonsense piece of 
legislation. You see, Mr. Speaker, there 
are 
approximately 
$130 
billion 
in 
unspent PPP funds. This bill simply 
enables the Small Business Adminis-
tration to do another round of PPP 
awards. There is still incredible de-
mand and need for this program. So 
this is not an allocation of additional 
money. 
As both sides debate a much larger 
and more complicated new stimulus 
package, I think this bill is a great 
first step. It is a program that has 
shown itself to be incredibly effective 
in saving jobs and small businesses. 
There is most definitely more demand 
for PPP funds for the small businesses 
and local nonprofits. The model of 
awarding the funds has shown itself to 
be excellent. Finally, it doesn’t require 
an additional appropriation. 
Mr. Speaker, our small businesses are 
fighting for their survival, and millions 
of jobs hang in the balance. We can do 
this. This money is there, and the pro-
gram works. 
f 
UPDATING AMERICA’S ENERGY 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Arizona (Mr. O’HALLERAN) for 5 min-
utes. 
Mr. O’HALLERAN. Mr. Speaker, I 
rise today to speak in support of H.R. 
4447, the Clean Economy Jobs and In-
novation Act. I am proud that that bill 
was used as a shell for this legislation. 
This legislative package is the work 
of over 40 critical pieces of energy and 
environment 
legislation 
from 
the 
House. Many of the bills included in 
this package are bipartisan, and I 
would like to thank our leadership, 
committee chairs, and Members on 
both sides of the aisle for contributing 
to this effort. 
This bill will take meaningful steps 
to update our energy infrastructure, 
create new jobs, and take important 
steps to address climate change in our 
country. 
The last major Federal effort to ad-
dress our changing energy landscape 
occurred in 2007. The urgency of the 
climate crisis and energy infrastruc-
ture crisis cannot be overstated. 
As the proud Representative of Arizo-
na’s First Congressional District, and 
as seen throughout the Western United 
States and our Nation, communities 
are facing the effects of climate change 
every day. From larger, deadlier forest 
fires to crippling droughts, Arizonans 
know the real-life implications of our 
changing planet. 
This is why today’s bill is so impor-
tant. It addresses the growing climate 
crisis and revitalizes our sagging en-
ergy economy. It creates much-needed 
job growth across our Nation. It is a 
win-win-win. 
As Members of Congress, we must 
work in a bipartisan manner to iden-
tify commonsense policy solutions to 
these critical issues and help hard-
working families find a just transition 
as our energy economy continues to 
evolve. 
The legislative package we are vot-
ing on today does more than just up-
date our Nation’s energy infrastruc-
ture. It creates tens of thousands of 
new, good-paying energy jobs that sup-
port a family and will be created 
through the new programs, initiatives, 
and Federal projects created within 
this bill to accelerate the deployment 
of clean energy technologies. 
We make meaningful investments in 
research and development programs to 
unlock the energy technologies of to-
morrow, limit our carbon footprint, 
and preserve the environment for fu-
ture generations to enjoy and prosper. 
We need to continue to identify legisla-
tive initiatives like the Clean Economy 
Jobs and Innovation Act that will work 
on a large scale to create new jobs in 
growing industries. 
I am humbled to see two bills I intro-
duced, the Expanding Access to Sus-
tainable Energy Act, and the Tribal 
Power Act, be included in today’s crit-
ical legislative package. And I am 
proud to stand today in favor of the 
Clean Economy Jobs and Innovation 
Act. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
join me in voting to pass this impor-
tant legislation.

HONORING 
MY 
WIFE, 
SHANNON, 
AND 
THE 
GREAT 
AMERICAN 
MEDICAL SYSTEM 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Illinois (Mr. RODNEY DAVIS) for 5 min-
utes. 
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. 
Speaker, I rise today to honor my wife, 
Shannon, because this is the 21st anni-
versary of her last chemotherapy treat-
ment after being diagnosed and treated 
for colon cancer in 1999. 
This is a day that we will all remem-
ber. It is the day of success, much dif-
ferent from the day of her diagnosis 
just a little over 6 months before that. 
We were a young couple with a 2- 
year-old daughter and didn’t know 
what the future held. But because of 
the great American medical system 
and the research that was done out 
here at places like the NIH for years 
before my wife was diagnosed, she was 
able to get the surgery and the treat-
ment she needed to now celebrate this 
anniversary. 
On that last day, when that poi-
sonous chemotherapy stopped having 
to enter her veins, little did we know 
we would be blessed with two more 
children, twin boys, just a short time 
later. They were born less than a year 
from then. 
While our daughter is now 23 and our 
sons are 20, this is an opportunity to 
talk about the greatness of America’s 
healthcare system and the greatness of 
the ingenuity within our healthcare 
system in this country. 
What is frustrating to me, Mr. 
Speaker, is that sometimes I hear my 
colleagues on the other side of the aisle 
talk about how we on this side of the 
aisle want to get rid of preexisting con-
ditions coverage. Every time I hear 
that, it hurts because I have seen what 
my wife went through. I live, she lives, 
and our family lives with her pre-
existing coverage every day. 
Let’s 
stop 
playing 
politics 
with 
healthcare. Let’s celebrate what Amer-
ica is all about and how we help heal 
the world. Let’s do it today, the day 
that I get to honor the love of my life, 
my wife, Shannon. 
Shannon, I can’t thank you enough 
for who you are. I can’t thank you 
enough for your courage. And I am so 
blessed to be able to call you my wife.

PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Will the 
gentlewoman

California 
(Ms.

House in the Pledge of Allegiance. 
Ms. ESHOO led the Pledge of Alle-
giance as follows:

United States of America, and to the Repub-
lic for which it stands, one nation under God, 
indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.

ANNOUNCEMENT BY THE SPEAKER 
PRO TEMPORE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair will entertain up to 15 requests

HONORING JUSTICE RUTH BADER 
GINSBURG 
(Ms. ESHOO asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.) 
Ms. ESHOO. Mr. Speaker, I come to 
the floor this morning on behalf of the 
people of California’s 18th Congres-
sional District to pay tribute to the 
late Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. 
Inscribed on the front of the building 
of the Supreme Court are the words: 
‘‘Equal justice under the law.’’ And 
that is what Justice Ginsburg did. She 
brought equality relative to voting 
rights, to gender equity, to civil rights. 
That was her work. She took it seri-
ously using her extraordinary intel-
ligence, her faith, her belief in a more 
perfect union. 
We pay tribute to her in a unique 
way. In history, there are very few in-
dividuals that are known by their ini-
tials: FDR, LBJ, JFK, and now RBG. 
As the poet wrote: And so she passed 
and all the trumpets sounded on the 
other side. 
Thank you, Justice Ginsburg, may 
you rest in peace. 
f 
TRIBUTE TO TOM WICKHAM, 
HOUSE PARLIAMENTARIAN 
(Mr. MCCARTHY asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Mr. MCCARTHY. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to say thank you and pay tribute 
to our friend and this Chamber’s Par-
liamentarian, Tom Wickham. 
Since the creation of the position in 
1927, Tom is just the sixth Parliamen-
tarian in the history of this body. 
While Representatives come and go, 
and majorities change from session to 
session, one constant is the Parliamen-
tarian’s office and their commitment 
to uphold the rules and traditions of 
this very Chamber. 
The 
Parliamentarian 
advises 
not 
only the Speaker, but serves with an 
open door to all Members, majority and 
minority, so our voices and our con-
stituents’ voices can be heard in this 
legislative process. 
I speak for all Republicans when I 
commend Tom for his professionalism, 
sound judgment, and steady demeanor 
in carrying out his duties. 
You see, Mr. Speaker, America was 
founded on an idea. Our Founders de-
termined that a deliberative body gov-
erned of, by, and for the people would 
best serve the interest of this Nation. 
Our Congress, a literal coming to-
gether of people and ideas from every 
corner of the Nation, is tasked with de-
bating the issues of the day. And it is 
up to Tom and his staff to make sure 
that we do so in a way that is con-
sistent with the enduring rules and 
precedents of this institution. 
Looking out for the institution is not 
exactly a glamorous job. Most of the 
Parliamentarian’s work goes on behind 
the scenes and without public recogni-
tion. But it is essential to our democ-
racy and it embodies the very best of 
civil service. 
Tom has served this body and this 
country for 25 years. Some of my staff-
ers refer to Tom as Dumbledore from 
Harry Potter—he knows all the an-
swers, you just have to ask the right 
questions. 
I know Members will continue to 
seek out Tom for advice, and I encour-
age all of them to extend the same 
courtesy to his successor, Jason Smith. 
Now, let’s not be confused, it is not 
Representative JASON SMITH from Mis-
souri, it is a different Jason Smith. 
I want to especially thank Tom’s 
wife, Heather, and his children, Brady 
and Elizabeth, for sharing Tom with us 
for all those years and all those late 
nights, through too many late-night 
voting sessions and last-minute nego-
tiations to count. 
Tom, you have served well. We wish 
you the best in retirement, and hope 
you get to watch lots of Iowa football 
now that the Big Ten has resumed 
play. 
But on behalf of a very grateful Na-
tion, I want to say thank you. I know 
times get heated. I know people are 
passionate about their ideas. I know 
your decisions cannot be made based 
upon who is in the majority or who is 
in the minority. 
I have watched you make some of the 
most difficult decisions, but they are 
always the right one. This country 
could only imagine being a Parliamen-
tarian when a decision is being made 
whether a Speaker has broken the 
rules or not. It would be easy to fold to 
the pressure of the majority, and I am 
proud to say Tom always held with the 
people of this Nation. That is what we 
look for in a Parliamentarian. That is 
what we ask for, and that is exactly 
what you gave us. 
Thank you for your service, and we 
appreciate all that you have done for 
this Nation.

HONORING OUR BRAVE LAW 
ENFORCEMENT OFFICIALS 
(Mrs. MILLER asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mrs. MILLER. Mr. Speaker, I rise to 
honor our Nation’s brave law enforce-
ment officials who protect our commu-
nities from violent crime. 
Just weeks ago, in West Virginia, a 
Fayette 
County 
deputy, 
Levi 
Garretson, was attacked during a traf-
fic stop. Thankfully, volunteer fire-
fighter, Calvin Endicott, was nearby to 
help fight off the attacker. 
Because of Mr. Endicott’s actions, 
Deputy Garretson was able to go home 
that night. Sadly, this is not the case 
for many officers in our country. This 
growing hatred is appalling. Incredibly, 
some of my colleagues across the aisle 
call to defund the police. 
Our country was founded on ideals 
that promote civility and security for 
all Americans. We need to unify around 
a shared goal of law and order, to stop 
the rioters and anarchists who burn 
our cities and threaten our law en-
forcement. 
I will always stand with our brothers 
and sisters in uniform. 
f 
RECOGNIZING DR. CHRISTAL 
ALBRECHT 
(Mr. OLSON asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. OLSON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
with sadness and joy; sadness because 
our leader at Alvin Community Col-
lege, ACC, Dr. Christal Albrecht, an-
nounced she will retire as our incred-
ible president on August 31 of next 
year; joyful because of the 7 amazing 
years she gave us as our president. 
She arrived as our sixth president in 
May of 2014. She came aboard with a 
great school; she leaves an even greater 
school. 
She was able to corral groups like 
faculty, students, donors, who some-
times have a break with the herd men-
tality. She put through a 5-year stra-
tegic plan with these groups. All those 
goals will be finished when she leaves. 
Her trademark is listening; asking 
students, What do you want to do with 
your life, or asking industry, What do 
you 
need 
from 
your 
employees? 
Christal met every challenge head-on. 
And I will close with one final chal-
lenge. Alvin’s mascot is a dolphin 
named Blue. Our challenge, on behalf 
of the students, faculty, and lovers of 
ACC, is Christal, wear this uniform, 
this mascot’s uniform, for a game or a 
day on campus before you leave. Thank 
you. God bless you.

HONORING THE LIFE OF LOUIS 
ANTONELLI 
(Mr. ROSE of New York asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute.) 
Mr. ROSE of New York. Mr. Speaker, 
I rise today to honor the life and serv-
ice of Mr. Louis Antonelli, an amazing 
husband, 
father, 
grandfather, 
and 
someone who served his community 
and his church with love and with com-
passion. 
Louis loved to serve, and he took 
pride in his work as a member of the 
New York City FOP and in his service 
on the board of the South Beach Civic 
Association. 
And although he was no stranger to 
tragedy with the loss of his beloved 
son, he never lost his joy or his passion 
for others. He loved to entertain 
guests, and when they would come and 
visit, you would never find him with-
out a smile, a piece of candy, or some 
kind words to share. 
He will be missed, but he will never 
be forgotten. My heart goes out to An-
gela, his adoring wife of over 60 years, 
his two daughters, and his five grand-
children. Mr. Antonelli, we will never 
forget your memory. 
f 
REMEMBERING DR. SAM E. 
SCOLARO 
(Mr. SPANO asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. SPANO. Mr. Speaker, today I 
rise to highlight in memoriam the leg-
acy of Dr. Sam Scolaro, a respected pil-
lar in Florida 15th District’s medical 
community, and a devoted husband and 
loving father who kept his promise to 
God to serve his patients until the day 
that he died, a promise fulfilled when 
COVID–19 took his life in August. 
Dr. Scolaro graduated from Jefferson 
High School in 1963, earned his under-
graduate degree from USF in 1967 and, 
after earning his medical degree, start-
ed his medical practice in 1972 in Bran-
don-Valrico. 
For 48 years, he served in many com-
munity roles while caring for patients, 
including as president of both the 
Brandon Chamber of Commerce and the 
Missing Children’s Help Center, and as 
a Brandon Hospital founding member. 
His mark on our community will not 
be forgotten. 
Dr. Scolaro extended his passion for 
medicine and helping others by men-
toring generations of medical students. 
To his beloved wife of 53 years, Janie, 
and his two daughters, Stephanie and 
Jennifer, our district and community 
mourn the loss of Sam. May his mem-
ory and sacrifice be a reminder of his 
love for family and community. Our 
thoughts and prayers are with you.

RECOGNIZING 
USDA 
FOREST 
SERVICE 
OFFICIAL 
CHARLES 
MORTON 
(Mr. LAMALFA asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. LAMALFA. Mr. Speaker, it is 
with deep regret that I rise today to 
recognize the lost life of USDA Forest 
Service official Charles Morton who 
died while fighting the El Dorado fire 
in the San Bernardino National Forest 
last Thursday in southern California. 
Charlie began his career as a corps-
man with the California Conservation 
Corps at the Butte Fire Center in 
Magalia, California, up in my area, 
where the Camp fire was known to 
have raged through there in 2018. No 
doubt some of the work that he and his 
colleagues did in the area of Magalia 
then saved a portion of Magalia in 
what they did. 
During 
the 
2006 
fire 
season, 
he 
worked with Firestorm Wildland Fire 
Suppression in Chico, California. His 
14-year forest service culminated as a 
Big Bear, California, Interagency Hot 
Shot Squad Boss in San Bernardino Na-
tional Forest. 
Charlie’s untimely passing is a risk 
that is, unfortunately, part of what our 
valiant firefighters and forest service 
workers deal with on the front lines 
every day. I pray that his family will 
find peace. 
I also pray for the firefighters across 
the West right now risking it all to 
save our public lands, property, fami-
lies, and wildlife from wildfire season.

REINSTATE REGIONAL AIRPORTS 
TO BOOST LOCAL ECONOMIES 
(Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania 
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend his remarks.) 
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to express my 
support of the Restoring Essential 
Service to Small Airports Act, a bill 
introduced by Congressman TRONE, 
which I am proud to cosponsor. 
This bipartisan bill would reinstate 
several regional airports back into the 
Essential Air Service program, which 
provides rural and underserved commu-
nities access to the national air trans-
portation system. 
The States that will benefit include 
my home State of Pennsylvania, as 
well as Kansas, New York, South Da-
kota, Maryland, and Wyoming. 
Many rural communities in these 
States were struggling prior to COVID– 
19, and it is important that access to 
affordable commercial flights to in-de-
mand locations continue. 
Without this lifeline, commercial 
service will cease to exist, presenting a 
new set of challenges when it comes to 
economic development and the long- 
term growth and sustainability of 
these communities. 
As a result of the reinstatement of 
these airports into the EAS program, a 
long-overdue boost to local economies 
will occur.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4909 
September 24, 2020 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to House Resolution 1129, the gen-
tlewoman from Michigan (Ms. STE-
VENS) and the gentleman from Okla-
homa (Mr. LUCAS) each will control 10 
minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from Michigan. 
Ms. STEVENS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself 1 minute. 
I rise today to urge my colleagues to 
support my amendment to increase ve-
hicle technology R&D as we consider 
this significant investment in a clean 
energy future for battery technology, 
cybersecurity, the connected car, our 
sustainability future, and countless 
jobs. 
Michigan has been a global leader in 
vehicle technology since we created 
the industry over a century ago. Our 
autoworkers are the best in the world. 
Our manufacturers are the best in the 
world. But we need to make sure that 
we continue to have a level playing 
field to compete. 
The U.S. must continue to lead by 
making the investments just as other 
nations are doing. Now is not the time 
to cede our leadership. Now is the time 
to claim it. 
Advances 
in 
electrification 
and 
connectivity will make vehicles safer, 
more efficient, and more affordable for 
consumers and their families. We owe 
it to our American workers to make 
sure that this next generation of vehi-
cles is made right here in the United 
States of America. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. LUCAS. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. 
I rise in opposition to this bloc of 
amendments and to express my pro-
found disappointment with this proc-
ess. 
As I said yesterday, climate change 
is a generational challenge, one where 
our work today will have an impact for 
decades to come. I believe our work on 
something of this importance deserves 
thoughtful consideration, careful anal-
ysis, and substantial debate. After all, 
what is at stake here is no small mat-
ter. 
The policy decisions we make on this 
issue will not only impact our green-
house gas emissions; they will also 
have a direct effect on what Americans 
pay to cool and heat their homes. They 
will determine whether we hamstring 
our energy sectors or give them a glob-
al advantage. 
Congress has an established process 
to make smart policy decisions on im-
portant issues like this. We consider 
issues in hearings, debate and vote in 
committees, and then bring legislation 
to the House floor. 
That is not what happened here. In-
stead of following regular order on in-
dividual policy proposals, we were 
given 1 week to review 900 pages of leg-
islation. 
In an effort to have a voice in this 
process, Members offered 176 amend-
ments to this bill. Only 99 were made 
in order. 
And now, Mr. Speaker, we don’t even 
have the chance to debate and vote on 
those amendments individually. In-
stead, we are expected to vote to pass 
or reject 26 amendments en bloc right 
now. With only one exception, this is 
how we will vote on all 99 amendments 
made in order. 
That is a problem because it forces us 
either to vote in favor of policies we 
don’t support or to vote against the 
ones we do. That is where I find myself 
right now. 
Not surprisingly, I strongly support 
my own amendment in this bloc. It ex-
presses the sense of Congress that in 
order to reduce emissions, the Sec-
retary of Energy must prioritize fund-
ing for fundamental research infra-
structure and for basic research and de-
velopment 
activities 
carried 
out 
through the Office of Science. 
Office of Science programs have long 
served as the cornerstone of U.S. en-
ergy innovation. Our clean energy fu-
ture will be built on next-generation 
technology areas like grid-scale energy 
storage, advanced grid security, and in-
tegrated carbon management strate-
gies. These technologies are dependent 
on Federal support for basic research 
programs and infrastructure. 
The Office of Science at DOE is be-
hind some of the most groundbreaking 
scientific discoveries and technology 
developments in recent history. With-
out the innovation that has come from 
DOE basic research, we wouldn’t have 
successfully reduced emissions through 
clean, affordable natural gas. 
That is why a clean energy legisla-
tive package that fails to include com-
prehensive Office of Science provisions 
is not a serious proposal even if it is 900 
pages long. 
I would urge my colleagues to re-
member that Americans need afford-
able and reliable energy, and that has 
to be a central goal in our policy to ad-
dress climate change. 
We can reduce emissions, keep en-
ergy prices competitive, and ensure 
that the U.S. remains a world leader in 
science and energy technology by com-
mitting to prioritize basic research and 
critical infrastructure supported by the 
Office of Science. 
I believe my amendment would im-
prove H.R. 4447 by establishing that 
Congress is fundamentally committed 
to research and development of break-
through clean energy technologies. Un-
fortunately, I can’t support my amend-
ment because it has been lumped in 
with so many others that actually 
worsen the underlying legislation by 
increasing our support of well-funded 
applied research programs that are du-
plicating the work that private indus-
try can and should be doing on its own. 
But that is what happens when you 
force through a massive, partisan mes-
saging bill instead of allowing for indi-
vidual policy consideration. This shows 
a lack of good faith from the House 
Democrats and is no way to pass legis-
lation for the public good. 
I urge my colleagues to oppose this 
bloc, and I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Ms. STEVENS. Mr. Speaker, surely, 
when we pass this legislation, we will 
be sending a host of new directives over 
to the Secretary of Energy to continue 
to win and advance our future. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the 
gentleman 
from 
Pennsylvania 
(Mr. 
LAMB). 
Mr. LAMB. Mr. Speaker, if I would 
have come before this House in 2005 and 
said to my colleagues, ‘‘I have a policy 
proposal. It will create hundreds of 
thousands of jobs in parts of the coun-
try that have lost them. It will help 
free us from wars in the Middle East. It 
will save middle-class families hun-
dreds if not thousands of dollars a year 
on their energy bills. And the best part 
is, it will allow us to reduce carbon 
emissions for the first time in the his-
tory of the United States,’’ that would 
sound like a Democratic policy—more 
jobs, less war, lower bills, less carbon. 
That policy was the shale revolution, 
and it was, in truth, a partnership be-
tween government research and entre-
preneurs in Pennsylvania and Texas 
and other places that figured out new 
techniques to get natural gas out of 
the ground. 
Some have opposed the continuation 
of natural gas drilling simply because 
it is a fossil fuel, and I ask them: Who 
gets credit for the reduced carbon 
emissions over the last 15 years? Nat-
ural gas has made a bigger difference 
than anything. But we still have a duty 
to continue trying to improve that 
process. 
A lot of people don’t realize that the 
National Energy Technology Labora-
tory, NETL, that exists in western 
Pennsylvania, has never given up on 
trying to clean up these processes. 
They have made great gains, particu-
larly in the area of produced water and 
taking the water that is used to get the 
gas out of the ground and removing the 
contaminants so that the water can be 
recycled and used over and over again. 
We have already seen that in the short 
life of shale drilling in western Penn-
sylvania. The NETL has improved re-
cycling of water immensely. 
My amendment would give additional 
money to the Secretary of Energy to 
double down on this research and, most 
importantly, establish a demonstration 
project for the first time ever to better 
recycle and dispose of this water right 
onsite, eliminating the loud and noisy 
trucks that drive through people’s 
neighborhoods and the risk of contami-
nating our water table. 
This has been a tremendous tech-
nology for western Pennsylvania and 
the United States, and we can continue 
making it better. 
Mr. LUCAS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 
minutes to the gentleman from Lou-
isiana (Mr. GRAVES). 
Mr. 
GRAVES 
of 
Louisiana. 
Mr. 
Speaker, I thank the gentleman from 
Oklahoma for yielding. 
Mr. Speaker, let’s look at this proc-
ess. Here we have a bill that was a bi-
partisan bill, H.R. 4447, that passed out

of the committee on a bipartisan vote, 
and it was eight pages. It was eight 
pages. 
Today, this bill is nearly 900 pages. 
Miraculously, from committee to the 
floor, it just exploded and became near-
ly 900 pages of text. This bill is now 
scored to cost the American taxpayers 
$135 billion. 
This is an issue that we agree that we 
need to be discussing. We need to be 
discussing America’s energy future. We 
need to be discussing the fact that 
Saudi Arabia, Russia, China, and other 
countries are trying to decimate the 
American energy industry. They are 
trying to force our dependence upon 
them. 
Unfortunately, while there are some 
good components of this bill, much of 
it plays into the hands of those very 
countries by forcing the use or pushing 
the use of technologies by manipu-
lating markets, by distorting costs, 
that forces us to play into the hands of 
those countries and become subject or 
dependent upon them for different re-
sources. 
b 1130 
Mr. Speaker, the United States, as I 
have heard people talk about emis-
sions, we are the leader in the world in 
terms 
of 
reducing 
emissions. 
The 
United States has reduced emissions 
more than every other country. 
People talk about emissions reduc-
tion. Under President Obama, there 
was the Clean Power Plan. We have ac-
tually hit the Clean Power Plan target 
established by President Obama, but 
we have done it 10 years early. 
We haven’t done it by distorting mar-
kets. We haven’t done it by forcing the 
use of technologies. We have done it by 
letting the market do what it does, by 
letting innovators innovate, like they 
do. 
So to my friends on the other side of 
the aisle, I will say it again: We abso-
lutely would love to engage with you 
on America’s energy future, on how we 
ensure the use of clean energy tech-
nologies moving forward, but also on 
building upon the success of the United 
States and how we are the global lead-
er in reducing emissions. 
We don’t have to have a Democrat 
bill. We have got all these amend-
ments. They have been thrown to-
gether en bloc, where maybe we have a 
great amendment, but it is paired to-
gether with nine others that are awful. 
This distorts the process, and it really 
makes us unable to even represent our 
constituents at home. 
So I want to urge: Let’s sit down and 
engage in this bill in a bipartisan way. 
Let’s not take a bill that was 8 pages 
and add over 800 pages to it in the dark 
of night. Let’s have a transparent proc-
ess. Let’s let us vote on amendments 
that make sense, that ensure Amer-
ica’s energy future is based upon our 
resources, not those of Russia, not 
those of China, as this bill does. 
This is a fatally flawed process. It is 
not in the interests of America. It is 
not in the interests of our children’s 
and our grandchildren’s future, and it 
ignores the fact that America is the 
leading reducer in emissions. 
Ms. STEVENS. Mr. Speaker, I remain 
somewhat baffled and surprised by the 
remarks of my colleague, particularly 
as, just in the last decade, China has 
spent nearly $60 billion to create a 
thriving electric vehicle industry, and 
that is, in part, what we are commit-
ting to do here today. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the 
gentleman 
from 
New 
Mexico 
(Mr. 
LUJA´ N). 
Mr. LUJA´ N. Mr. Speaker, I include in 
the RECORD the CBO score on this leg-
islation.

YOU-GO EFFECTS OF RULES COMMITTEE PRINT 
116–63, H.R. 4447, THE
CLEAN
ECONOMY
JOBS 
AND INNOVATION ACT, INCLUDING MANAGER’S 
AMENDMENT (PALLONE 170), AS REPORTED BY 
THE COMMITTEE ON RULES ON SEPTEMBER 21, 
2020 
The Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010 
establishes budget-reporting and enforce-
ment procedures for legislation affecting di-
rect spending or revenues. The net changes 
in outlays and revenues that are subject to 
those procedures are shown here. 
H.R. 4447 would modify existing laws and 
policies governing the energy sector. CBO es-
timates that the provisions noted below 
would have an insignificant effect on net di-
rect spending, revenues, and the deficit over 
the 2020–2030 period. 
Subtitle C of Title I would require federal 
agencies and data centers to implement 
strategies to acquire, use, and maintain in-
formation technologies expected to increase 
energy efficiency. Those provisions could af-
fect direct spending if agencies procure en-
ergy-efficient technologies using longterm 
contracts known as energy savings perform-
ance contracts. 
Subtitle F of Title II would allow operators 
with certain federal leases to noncompeti-
tively acquire the rights to coproduce geo-
thermal resources under that lease and to 
noncompetitively lease land adjoining that 
lease. CBO expects that few leases would be 
affected by this provision. 
Subtitle C of Title IV would reduce reve-
nues by extending quotas for imports of ura-
nium from Russia until 2040, which under 
current law are set to expire in 2020. 
Title XI would allow aggrieved persons to 
sue entities, such as local governments, for 
discrimination that occurs in the context of 
implementing environmental projects or reg-
ulations promulgated by federal agencies. 
CBO expects that provision would increase 
the number of suits filed in federal court. 
Those changes would increase both revenues 
(from court filing fees) and spending of those 
fees. 
H.R. 4447 also would authorize the appro-
priation of more than $125 billion over the 
2021–2025 period for various programs related 
to clean energy. Any spending would be sub-
ject to the availability of appropriations for 
those programs. 
H.R. 4447 contains intergovernmental and 
private-sector mandates as defined in the 
Unfunded Mandates Reform Act (UMRA). 
CBO estimates that the costs of mandates on 
private entities would exceed the private- 
sector threshold established in UMRA, and 
the costs of mandates on state, local, and 
tribal governments would fall below the 
threshold for intergovernmental mandates 
(those thresholds are $168 million and $84 
million in 2020, respectively, adjusted annu-
ally for inflation). 
Mr. LUJA´ N. Mr. Speaker, I would 
also be happy to share this with my 
colleague and my friend from Lou-
isiana. The CBO score on this is zero. 
So I will make sure I hand this over to 
him, as well, to take a look. 
Mr. Speaker, at home in New Mexico, 
we are very proud of our national labs, 
three national labs, two at the Depart-
ment of Energy. New Mexico has seen 
the value that the United States De-
partment of Energy brings to the fight 
against COVID–19. 
Through our national labs, the De-
partment has provided support to the 
National Institutes of Health and other 
government agencies, leveraged its sci-
entific resources, but did a lot of work 
to improve the epidemiological models 
and much more. 
The Department of Energy has an-
other important role to play by helping 
to restart America’s innovation econ-
omy, creating jobs, and moving us to-
ward economic recovery. 
My amendment with Representatives 
WILSON, TORRES SMALL, and CASTEN, 
and based on the IMPACT for Energy 
Act, 
would 
help 
the 
Department 
achieve these goals by establishing the 
Department of Energy-affiliated non-
profit foundation to raise private-sec-
tor funds and leverage expertise that 
supports the research, development, 
and commercial application of tech-
nologies that address our Nation’s en-
ergy challenges and combat climate 
change. 
This model works. The National In-
stitutes of Health, CDC, and USDA 
foundations have already demonstrated 
that they can raise billions of private- 
sector dollars to support research and 
innovation. And innovation, in turn, 
drives economic growth. 
To enhance these efforts as part of 
the clean energy economy, we have the 
Clean Economy Jobs and Innovation 
Act. 
We will also be advancing my legisla-
tion to improve innovators’ access to 
national lab facilities and to develop 
the next generation of tech leaders 
through partnership between national 
labs and institutions of higher edu-
cation. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support this en bloc amendment and 
the underlying bill. 
Mr. LUCAS. Mr. Speaker, I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Ms. STEVENS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from Texas 
(Mr. DOGGETT). 
Mr. DOGGETT. Mr. Speaker, even 
during these challenging times, most 
Americans recognize that when they 
get home, they find a habitable place 
and the lights come on with the flip of 
a switch. But preserving future Amer-
ican energy independence and energy 
efficiency is a greater challenge. 
The climate crisis that we confront 
today is not just about endangered 
polar bears and Antarctic ice sheets 
that are melting and will submerge our 
coastal areas; it is here and now with 
our erratic weather, with our soaring

temperatures, 
and 
with 
blazing 
wildfires across the country. Energy-ef-
ficient technology shouldn’t be the ‘‘al-
ternative,’’ it should be the regular 
standard. 
Now, while my home State of Texas 
is the national leader in greenhouse 
gas pollution and in climate deniers, it 
is also the home to really significant 
growth in wind power, the leading 
State in the country, and a growing 
source of solar power. 
Investments in clean energy protect 
taxpayer 
investments 
and 
promote 
public health and safety. These invest-
ments ensure America is leading on the 
road to clean energy, not being run 
over by it. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentleman has expired. 
Ms. STEVENS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
an additional 1 minute to the gen-
tleman. 
Mr. DOGGETT. Mr. Speaker, as Con-
gress considers new investments in re-
search and development, let’s direct 
our efforts where we can achieve the 
greatest savings and the greatest effi-
ciency. 
While carbon capture and storage, 
the process of capturing carbon dioxide 
formed in power generation and some 
industrial 
processes, 
has 
potential, 
many substantial questions remain 
about its cost-effectiveness compared 
to other low-emission technologies, 
particularly since hundreds of millions 
of dollars in current tax subsidies are 
directed, often improperly, to those 
promoting fossil fuels. 
Accordingly, the amendment I have 
offered that is included in this en bloc 
amendment gets the facts for tax-
payers by asking the National Acad-
emy of Sciences to evaluate the effi-
cacy of carbon capture technology and 
evaluate industries regarding its poten-
tial. 
Enough of the fossilized thinking 
about fossil fuels. Let’s explore all 
available tools and technologies, while 
ensuring that taxpayer dollars are uti-
lized to achieve maximum savings, be-
cause energy savings could mean the 
difference between the Earth’s saving 
and its destruction. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of the 
amendment. 
Mr. LUCAS. Mr. Speaker, I would 
note to my colleague that I have no ad-
ditional speakers, and I am prepared to 
close whenever she has concluded with 
her speakers. 
Ms. STEVENS. Mr. Speaker, I have 
no additional speakers. I am prepared 
to close. 
Mr. LUCAS. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self as much time as I may consume. 
As the Chamber of Commerce noted 
in a letter to Congress, there is a grow-
ing consensus that the research, devel-
opment, and commercialization of new 
technologies is an important factor 
that will determine how quickly and at 
what cost greenhouse gas emissions 
will be reduced. The Chamber has re-
cently taken issue with this package 
because of the inclusion of a number of 
provisions that diverge from its core 
focus area, threatening to undermine 
the otherwise favorable bill. 
I am sorry to say it again, but too 
many provisions of this bill have un-
dermined areas where we could have 
found bipartisan consensus. The same 
is true of the bloc of amendments. I, 
therefore, must urge my colleagues to 
oppose this bloc. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
Ms. STEVENS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself as much time as I may con-
sume. 
Mr. Speaker, I recognize the bipar-
tisan nature of the original bill that 
passed through the House Science, 
Space, 
and 
Technology 
Committee 
with the leadership of our great chair-
woman, EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON, and 
our ranking member, Mr. LUCAS. 
I also recognize today that we are 
taking a vote for our future. We are 
taking a vote for our innovation agen-
da. We are talking about the research 
and development efforts of this Nation. 
We are talking about a clean economy. 
Today, as we engaged in debate, we 
got a glimpse of where this vote might 
come down. 
Mr. Speaker, let it be reminded to all 
that this House majority is the major-
ity that is working for the people and 
their future and their jobs, for a clean 
economy. We are taking the necessary 
steps to get it done. 
So, Mr. Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues on both sides of the aisle to re-
member and to be reminded about 
where it will come down today with 
this vote. I urge them to vote ‘‘yes.’’ I 
urge them to vote for our future. I urge 
them to vote for our innovation capa-
bilities from the United States of 
America. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
Mrs. TRAHAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise to offer 
my strong support for the amendment offered 
by the gentleman from Pennsylvania, Mr. 
LAMB. 
The world desperately needs a new source 
of energy that has zero-carbon emissions. 
Such a technological breakthrough is abso-
lutely vital to combating climate change and 
meeting our growing energy demands. 
One such promising technology is fusion en-
ergy. 
When commercialized, fusion will accelerate 
the transformation of America’s energy sys-
tem, providing the foundation for our zero-car-
bon energy economy of the future. 
My colleague’s amendment, which I’m 
pleased to co-sponsor, would provide the 
basis for the United States to maximize its re-
sources, both public and private, to dem-
onstrate and commercialize fusion energy. 
His amendment would support public-private 
partnerships to make fusion energy a reality 
by building full-scale demonstration facilities— 
and creating new companies and more jobs 
here at home. 
This is a race against time—not only to pre-
vent the worst catastrophes that we’re begin-
ning to see due to climate change, but also 
ensuring adequate funds so that the United 
States is the global leader in fusion. 
As Professor Dennis Whyte of MIT wrote 
last year in The Washington Post, ‘‘This is a 
critical moment for such funding decisions. 
Other governments are investing billions in fu-
sion.’’ 
The pending amendment’s milestone-based 
funding program will support the development 
of a U.S.-based fusion power industry by pro-
viding funds to stimulate R&D and eventual 
commercialization of this new energy source. 
Each private sector participant will need to 
meet milestones agreed-upon in partnership 
with the Department of Energy in order to re-
ceive the public funds. 
Federal assistance would be made only 
upon completion of agreed-upon milestones. 
I urge support for the amendment as well as 
the underlying bill. 
Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Speaker, I rise in 
support of my amendment to the ‘‘Clean Econ-
omy Jobs and Innovation Act’’, H.R. 4447. 
I thank my colleague from California, Con-
gressman LOWENTHAL—the chairman of the 
Natural Resources Subcommittee on Energy 
and Mineral Resources—for his support as the 
amendment’s cosponsor. 
I also want to commend Congressman PAL-
LONE—the chairman of the Energy and Com-
merce Committee—for his leadership with the 
omnibus clean energy bill before the House 
today. 
The Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act sub-
jects offshore mineral or energy development 
to U.S. jurisdiction, including the Constitution 
and applicable federal laws. 
Specifically, this 1953 law applies the civil 
and political jurisdiction of the United States to 
installations on the Outer Continental Shelf in 
the United States’ Exclusive Economic Zone 
(EEZ) at sea. 
Under the Outer Continental Shelf Lands 
Act, the U.S. Department of the lnterior—act-
ing through the Bureau of Ocean Energy Man-
agement—conducts lease sales for offshore 
development of mineral and energy resources, 
indulging wind lease sales. 
The Energy Policy Act of 2005 established 
the Secretary of the Interior’s exclusive off-
shore wind leasing and permitting authority 
under the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act. 
Our amendment simply clarifies that lease 
sales for energy development on the Outer 
Continental Shelf from non-minerals—sources 
other than oil and natural gas such as wind, 
hydrokinetic, or ocean thermal energy conver-
sion—are indeed subject to U.S. jurisdiction, 
including federal laws affording labor and envi-
ronmental protections. 
Congress clearly intended U.S. law to apply 
to any form of exploration, development, pro-
duction, transportation, and transmission of 
energy resources under the Outer Continental 
Shelf Lands Act. 
Again, all our amendment does is clarify 
that all forms of offshore energy development 
are indeed subject to the same U.S. laws that 
currently apply to the offshore oil and gas in-
dustry. 
In the 112th Congress, the House of Rep-
resentatives passed our amendment lan-
guage, nearly verbatim, by voice vote as the 
‘‘POWER Act’’ (H.R. 2360). 
According to an April 2018 study by the 
Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, off-
shore wind along the Eastern Seaboard of the 
United States has the potential to eclipse all 
current land-based wind development. 
Demand for offshore wind projects in federal 
waters is strong, as the Bureau of Ocean En-
ergy Management sets record lease sales in

the Atlantic, to the benefit of American tax-
payers. 
In short order, we may see similar demand 
for federal lease sales for offshore wind else-
where in the country, including off the West 
Coast or the U.S. territories. 
Offshore wind development will play a cen-
tral part in our nation’s transition to a clean 
energy economy powered by renewables. 
As we welcome this burgeoning industry, 
Congress must act decisively to clarify that 
any offshore wind development on the Outer 
Continental Shelf—including exploration, pro-
duction, transportation, and transmission—is 
indeed subject to the same federal laws that 
already apply to offshore oil and gas develop-
ment or underwater mining. 
This is the clear and obvious intent of Con-
gress, and my amendment simply updates the 
underlying federal law to reflect this reality. 
As the former Deputy Secretary of the Inte-
rior during the Clinton Administration, I am a 
long-time proponent of all forms of renewable 
energy to help meet the global challenge of 
man-made climate change, including offshore 
wind development. 
I urge my colleagues to support this critical 
amendment, simply updating the Outer Conti-
nental Shelf Lands Act to reflect clear Con-
gressional intent and provide legal certainty for 
offshore wind projects to proceed in accord-
ance with federal law. 
Lastly, adopting our amendment to the 
‘‘Clean Economy Jobs and Innovation Act’’ 
(H.R. 4447) will set the House on strong foot-
ing for any Energy Bill conference next Con-
gress, with the Murkowski-Manchin bill ex-
pected to be passed by the Senate. 
I hope this amendment will pass by voice 
vote as it did on December 7, 2011, during the 
112th Congress. 
Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today in support of two amendments to H.R. 
4447, the Clean Energy Jobs and Innovation 
Act. I am honored to represent Virginia’s 3rd 
Congressional District, which is on the front 
lines of sea-level rise. Recognizing the urgent 
action needed to mitigate the worst of the cli-
mate crisis, I am pleased that this bill includes 
support for climate-informed building codes to 
improve energy efficiency as well as resil-
ience, issues on which Norfolk, Virginia is 
leading the way. My district is also home to 
the Port of Virginia and other facilities—as well 
as workers—that played a critical role in in-
stalling the first offshore wind turbines in fed-
eral waters this summer. On and offshore, 
wind energy presents an incredible opportunity 
to generate clean, renewable energy, and to 
create good, green, family-sustaining jobs in 
Hampton Roads and across the country. 
I was pleased to submit an amendment en-
couraging the use of modeling and simulation 
technologies in wind energy, along with Rep-
resentative STEPHANIE MURPHY. As co-chairs 
of the Congressional Modeling and Simulation 
Caucus, we submitted this amendment to sup-
port the development and deployment of mod-
eling and simulation tools to aid in rapidly 
transitioning our economy away from fossil 
fuels. Modeling and simulation have been very 
thoughtfully incorporated into many aspects of 
this bill—ensuring technologies are effectively 
deployed, risks to our electric grid are under-
stood, and community resilience is enhanced. 
Modeling and simulation technologies also 
have incredible potential to contribute to every 
step of wind energy generation: the design 
and siting of turbines, wind power forecasting, 
construction of turbines, and even projecting 
the need for turbine maintenance and repair. 
I urge my colleagues to support this amend-
ment to increase our understanding of each of 
these areas. 
I also rise in support of my amendment 
which would support research into rethinking, 
reducing, and reusing critical materials in wind 
energy. The widespread deployment of current 
wind energy technology requires aluminum 
and rare-earth elements. The increasing de-
mand for these elements and issues within 
their supply chains is a concern for all of us 
concerned about the environment, human 
rights, and our clean energy future to action. 
For years, the Department of Energy has ac-
knowledged that ‘‘supply challenges’’ for cer-
tain rare earth metals could negatively affect 
clean energy technology development. The 
United States is currently largely dependent 
on other nations, especially China, for rare 
earth minerals. These minerals may not be 
quite as finite as their name implies; however, 
they are generally difficult to mine and require 
extensive processing. In some places, the in-
dustry lacks protections for workers and the 
environment, jeopardizing communities’ drink-
ing water and soil. We can alleviate these 
concerns by investing in research to rethink 
turbine design, reduce the use of such mate-
rials, and reuse products which are no longer 
need. 
Wind energy prices have fallen significantly 
fallen in the past decade. The levelized cost, 
which does not account for federal tax credits, 
decreased from about $90 per megawatt-hour 
to $30 per megawatt-hour last year. This is an 
exciting and encouraging trend for consumers, 
our climate, and communities, like Hampton 
Roads, that are both threatened by climate 
change and poised to create good green wind 
energy jobs. This amendment would facilitate 
research on the reuse of such materials and 
the design of turbines that require less of 
these materials, ensuring that this trend to-
wards more affordable wind energy continues. 
In addition to creating jobs here in the United 
States, supporting the future of wind energy 
ensures that Americans will have increasing 
access to energy that is clean, renewable, reli-
able, and affordable. 
I urge my colleagues to support these 
amendments.

CLIMATE
ACTION

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to House Resolution 1129, the gen-
tlewoman 
from 
Colorado 
(Ms. 
DEGETTE) and the gentleman from Or-
egon (Mr. WALDEN) each will control 10 
minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from Colorado. 
Ms. DEGETTE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, this en bloc amendment 
contains 
a 
number 
of 
important 
amendments from within the jurisdic-
tion of the Energy and Commerce Com-
mittee that will improve the under-
lying bill. I know some of the sponsors 
will be here to talk about their amend-
ments in particular. I rise today in sup-
port of my amendments to H.R. 4447. 
Mr. Speaker, as Members of Con-
gress, we have a responsibility to en-
sure that every man, woman, and child 
in this country has access to clean air 
to breathe and safe water to drink. We 
also have a responsibility to help lead 
this Nation in doing its part to stave 
off the worst impacts of the climate 
crisis. 
For far too long now, we as a body 
have failed at those responsibilities, 
and, as a result, millions of Americans 
are living in areas that are suffering 
from large amounts of pollution, and 
the threat that we face from climate 
change is growing day by day. 
Right in my district, I have commu-
nities 
like 
Swansea, 
Elyria, 
and 
Globeville, where residents have been 
suffering for years from large amounts 
of pollution that are produced by near-
by plants. These communities, at-risk 
communities, 
environmental 
justice 
communities, are bearing the brunt of 
our failures. 
b 1145 
And so the amendments that I am in-
troducing today seek to address this 
injustice.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4933 
September 24, 2020 
The first amendment would require 
the EPA to identify 100 communities 
across this country most affected by 
nearby sources of pollution and work 
to clean them up. 
The second amendment that I have 
included in the bill would limit the 
amount of methane gas that oil drillers 
are allowed to release into our atmos-
phere from public lands. When we, as a 
nation, fail to enact measures like 
these, it is often the poorest among us 
who suffer the most. 
Therefore, I urge my colleagues to do 
the right thing, to help address these 
crises by supporting my amendments 
and all of the rest of the amendments 
included in this en bloc amendment. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
I rise in opposition to the amend-
ment. 
Many of these amendments reflect, 
frankly, the costly Green New Deal 
policies of the Progressive left. We 
think they mandate dramatic and, 
frankly, unrealistic changes to our en-
ergy and transportation systems with 
little to no consideration for afford-
ability, or especially the reliability of 
energy for Americans, or our growing 
dependence on China for critical min-
erals. 
That China supply chain is some-
thing I think we could find common 
ground on at some point, and we must, 
as a country. 
The bill ignores hardworking blue- 
collar workers and rewards so-called 
green-collar workers instead. 
Provisions that we thought we had 
reached common ground on in the En-
ergy and Commerce Committee were 
stripped out. 
These amendments will provide bil-
lions of dollars of additional grants and 
assistance to cities in urban areas, but 
at the expense of rural America. We are 
one country, and we should be united 
in assisting our people, regardless of 
where they live. 
The amendments expand rebate pro-
grams and create a patchwork of new 
energy-efficiency 
standards, 
raising 
costs for consumers. 
If there is one thing I hear most, it is 
people are concerned about how costs 
are going up, especially during this pe-
riod. 
They provide even more green give-
aways, things like appliances and vehi-
cles, at a time when most Americans 
are struggling with the economic fall-
out from this pandemic. 
Clearly, Democrats want to spend the 
taxpayers’ dollars on their Green New 
Deal wish list, following the lead of 
California, who has had its own set of 
problems with reliability on its energy 
grid. 
None of these issues raised by these 
amendments have gotten a hearing or 
debate in committee. One of them, 
dealing with the Klamath River Dams 
around my district, would short circuit 
the public licensing process at the Fed-
eral Energy Regulatory Commission. It 
steps all over this public process that 
is enshrined in law. 
It is a blatant attempt to legislate 
the removal of these dams, and wher-
ever you are on that issue—for or 
against removing the dams—we think 
this sets a dangerous precedent by roll-
ing back the longstanding protections 
and due process afforded through the 
well-established Federal licensing proc-
ess. So both sides should be concerned 
about that amendment in this bill. 
Republicans offered amendments to 
lower the cost of energy. We offered 
amendments to develop innovative new 
technologies, and we offered amend-
ments to reduce permitting delays. 
Unfortunately, Democrats refuse to 
let those amendments be debated on 
this House floor or voted on this House 
floor. 
The Democratic amendments we are 
all debating today will not result in 
meaningful reforms to the permitting 
and licensing process so we can rebuild 
our economy and recover from the 
COVID pandemic. 
So I have to urge my colleagues to 
join me in opposing these amendments 
and the underlying bill. 
I reserve the balance of my time. 
Ms. DEGETTE. Mr. Speaker, I am 
now pleased to yield 2 minutes to the 
gentlewoman from Pennsylvania (Ms. 
WILD). 
Ms. WILD. Mr. Speaker, I support 
H.R. 4447 which, in broad strokes, 
would reform U.S. energy policy by 
making investments in energies that 
will reduce our carbon footprint. 
My amendment is offered, not as a 
critique of the underlying bill, but to 
fulfill a promise made to constituents 
in my community that we can simulta-
neously invest in cleaner energy and in 
our workforce. 
My amendment creates opportunities 
for workers at risk of being displaced 
so that they can begin or continue a 
career in construction. 
For those in coal or other related in-
dustries, this amendment offers cost- 
shared grants to pay for pre-appren-
ticeship training in cleaner energy ca-
reer paths. My amendment prioritizes 
grants to entities that have a success-
ful history of placing pre-apprentice 
graduates into full apprenticeship pro-
grams or into gainful employment, and 
it supports local businesses by creating 
a sliding scale of Federal cost sharing, 
devoting a greater percentage of re-
sources to small, local businesses rath-
er than to larger businesses that al-
ready have the financial wherewithal 
to transition workers. 
I urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote. 
Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, I have 
one more speaker who wanted to speak, 
but he is not here. 
I apparently have the right to close, 
so if the gentlewoman would like to go 
ahead while we wait for our other 
Member, I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Ms. DEGETTE. Mr. Speaker, I would 
just say that the debate has been brief, 
but the substance of this en bloc 
amendment is large—many amend-
ments designed in totality to deal with 
climate change to help our environ-
ment and to help make sure that we 
support disadvantaged communities in 
this country and communities affected 
by environmental justice issues. 
So I would just urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote on 
this en bloc amendment, and I yield 
back the balance of my time. 
Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
In closing, and I, again, I think I out-
lined pretty clearly some of our con-
cerns with this measure. I think there 
is a lot we could find common ground 
on in the energy picture, certainly for 
working 
Americans 
and 
especially 
those dealing with the pandemic. But 
raising costs and increasing delays is 
not part of what we can support. 
I urge opposition, and I yield back 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. THOMPSON of California. Mr. Speaker, 
I rise today in strong support of my amend-
ment to H.R. 4447, the Clean Economy Jobs 
and Innovation Act. 
This commonsense amendment clarifies 
that energy saved through the use of geo-
thermal pumps qualifies as renewable energy 
produced for the purposes of this bill. 
Battling climate change and reducing green-
house gas emissions will require an innova-
tive, multi-pronged approach. 
And geothermal pump technology must be a 
tool available for us to use. 
Geothermal pumps work to reduce energy 
consumption by transferring and concentrating 
heat energy absorbed from the earth. 
These installations can reduce energy use 
in buildings by over 40 percent. 
My amendment clarifies that these energy 
savings count as renewable energy produced, 
recognizing that geothermal pumps remain a 
critical part of our effort to reduce emissions 
and defeat climate change. 
I urge my colleagues to support this amend-
ment. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to House Resolution 1129, the pre-
vious 
question

to.

It is the sense of Congress that in order to 
reduce global emissions and meet 100 percent 
of the power demand in the United States 
through clean, renewable, or zero emission 
energy sources while maintaining U.S. com-
petitiveness in science and technology, the 
United States must prioritize investment in 
domestic energy sources and supply chains, 
as well as investment in the research and de-
velopment of exportable next-generation en-
ergy technologies.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to House Resolution 1129, the gen-
tleman from New Jersey (Mr. PALLONE) 
and the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. 
WALDEN) each will control 10 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from New Jersey. 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I in-
tend to speak in opposition to the 
amendment, so I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. WALDEN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in support of 
these amendments which are focused 
on ways to improve options and reduce 
the cost of energy for American con-
sumers. Our amendments put con-
sumers first. 
These amendments also address im-
portant issues such as grid reliability— 
that means when you flip the light 
switch, the lights come on consist-
ently; streamlining research at the De-
partment of Energy to promote innova-
tion and technological development 
and nuclear research for advanced nu-
clear power. 
There are also much-needed efforts to 
reduce our reliance on critical min-
erals, especially from China. Repub-
licans have been sounding the alarm 
about our growing reliance on critical 
minerals and their use in all sorts of 
energy technologies. This is how we 
make batteries, windmills, and solar 
panels and we have become too depend-
ent on foreign countries for those crit-
ical minerals. 
We are also very concerned that the 
underlying bill, which is based on the 
Green New Deal, will trade away our 
energy independence and make us more 
reliant on countries like China and 
their abysmal record on human rights, 
environment, and trade. 
So, Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to join me in supporting these 
commonsense 
amendments 
to 
H.R. 
4447, and I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
b 1200 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. I will be speaking in opposition 
to this bloc of amendments. 
My colleagues on the other side of 
the aisle have argued that this legisla-
tion picks winners and losers, and that 
amendments such as these might help 
level the playing field. But I don’t 
think that is the case. 
The Clean Economy Jobs and Innova-
tion Act authorizes investments in a 
broad range of programs to unleash 
American energy innovation and re-
form outdated policies that govern how 
we produce, distribute, and consume 
energy. Rather than picking winners 
and losers, this bill takes a portfolio 
approach to supporting the transition 
to a clean energy economy—a transi-
tion that is already underway, but not 
at the pace needed to avoid the worst 
and most costly consequences of cli-
mate change. 
For years, rapidly declining costs for 
solar, wind, storage, and other tech-
nologies have made them cost-competi-
tive with and, in many cases, more 
cost-effective than conventional tech-
nologies. 
The Clean Economy Jobs and Innova-
tion Act doubles down on these market 
trends, providing the tools, invest-
ments, and policy reforms needed for 
the United States to lead the world in 
transitioning to a cleaner future. 
At the same time, the legislation in-
vests in research, development, and de-
ployment of technologies to reduce 
emissions from traditional sources of 
pollution. Importantly, it invests in 
carbon capture, utilization, and stor-
age to help reduce emissions from ex-
isting facilities that are particularly 
challenging to decarbonize, especially 
in the industrial sector. 
So rather than picking winners and 
losers, the Clean Economy Jobs and In-
novation Act includes a broad array of 
tools to modernize our energy system. 
Taken together, these tools will help 
make our energy system cleaner, more 
efficient, more resilient, and more reli-
able. 
That is why many pieces of this leg-
islation have enjoyed such strong bi-
partisan support, because they are 
commonsense investments that will 
create jobs, protect consumers, and re-
duce pollution. 
But these proposed amendments are 
not good faith efforts to build on this 
bipartisan foundation. They are an at-
tempt to water down this legislation 
and slow the transition to a clean econ-
omy. 
When we look across the globe, we 
see that this transition is already un-
derway, but that the United States is 
falling behind. The real question is 
whether we want to regain our com-
petitive edge and global leadership in 
technology and innovation or whether 
we cede to the competition. 
I urge my colleagues not to be dis-
tracted by talking points about picking 
winners and losers and focus on who 
actually wins when we invest in inno-
vation. Consumers win, workers win, 
and our environment wins. 
For these reasons, Madam Speaker, I 
oppose the en bloc amendments, and I 
reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. WALDEN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from 
Oklahoma (Mr. LUCAS), who is the top 
Republican on the Science, Space, and 
Technology Committee and the former 
chairman of the Agriculture Com-
mittee. 
Mr. LUCAS. Madam Speaker, my 
amendment contained within this en 
bloc emphasizes a critical priority for 
House Republicans. It expresses the 
sense of Congress that the United 
States must prioritize investment in 
domestic energy sources and supply 
chains, as well as in research and de-
velopment of exportable next-genera-
tion energy technologies. 
This is absolutely necessary if we are 
going to maintain U.S. competitiveness 
in science and technology while reduc-
ing emissions. These priorities should 
play a key role in any realistic and re-
sponsible global clean energy strategy. 
With the current public health crisis, 
the need for sustainable domestic en-
ergy chains has never been more im-
portant. Whether it is medical supplies 
or energy sources, we need to be able to 
depend on our own resources if foreign 
supply is voluntarily or involuntarily 
cut off. That requires us to invest in 
basic research, which drives break-
through technologies. 
For example, due in part to Federal 
investment in R&D that has led to new

horizontal drilling and hydraulic frac-
turing technology, the American shale 
revolution has led the U.S. to be a net 
exporter of natural gas since 2018. This 
is how basic research results in energy 
independence, an achievement our Na-
tion must prioritize for long-term suc-
cess. 
Basic research is also instrumental 
in the fight against climate change. 
For emissions reduction technologies 
like carbon capture, storage, and utili-
zation to be effective, they must be 
used globally. 
Over the past 20 years, Asia has ac-
counted for 90 percent of all coal-fired 
capacity built worldwide, and these 
plants have potentially long oper-
ational lifetimes ahead of them. We 
can’t force them to change their en-
ergy profile and amount of emissions, 
but we can make cleaner energy tech-
nology appealing by making it effi-
cient, inexpensive, and commercially 
marketable. 
If fundamental clean energy research 
is conducted here in the United States 
and developed into deployable tech-
nology, we can export the resulting 
knowledge, tools, and energy itself, as 
I mentioned with natural gas. By in-
vesting in this way, we can grow U.S. 
industry, reduce our reliance on for-
eign countries for innovation, and, 
most importantly, make a significant 
impact on mitigating the effects of 
global climate change. 
If we want to innovate, and we want 
to export our technologies, we have to 
focus on breakthrough science, not on 
propping 
up 
mature 
energy 
tech-
nologies and slowing the development 
of new ones. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to support this position, my 
amendment, and this en bloc. 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, I include in the 
RECORD letters that we received in sup-
port of the legislation from U.S. PIRG 
and the League of Conservation Voters. 
DEAR KATIE: On behalf of the U.S. Public 
Interest 
Research 
Group, 
Environment 
America and our tens of thousands of mem-
bers, we urge you to support the Clean Econ-
omy Jobs and Innovation Act (H.R. 4447). 
U.S. PIRG and Environment America will 
consider scoring final passage and certain 
amendments on our annual scorecard. 
The American West is on fire, East Coast 
and Midwest communities are facing major 
flooding, and southern states are being bat-
tered with hurricanes. The climate crisis is 
here and if we want to have any chance of 
avoiding its worst impacts, it is imperative 
that we take swift action. The ‘‘Clean Econ-
omy Jobs and Innovation Act’’ marks sig-
nificant progress in the transition to a clean 
energy future and in the reduction of green-
house gas emissions. 
Among the most impactful pieces, the leg-
islation includes provisions that: 
Phase out the use of hydrofluorocarbons 
(HFCs), which are extraordinarily potent cli-
mate pollutants, with hundreds to thousands 
of times the heat-trapping power of CO2; 
Reauthorize the Energy Efficiency Con-
servation and Block Grant (EECBG) pro-
gram, which provides $17.5 billion in funding 
for schools, homes, government buildings, 
and manufacturing facilities to improve effi-
ciency and deploy energy-efficient tech-
nologies; 
Invest over $36 billion for transportation 
electrification, including grants and rebates 
to deploy electric vehicles and related charg-
ing infrastructure; 
Direct DOE to establish new model build-
ing codes for states to improve energy effi-
ciency; 
Preserve a policy that will eliminate all 
fossil fuel-generated energy from federal 
buildings by the year 2030. 
In addition to supporting the overarching 
bill, U.S. PIRG and Environment America 
urge the following votes on amendments: 
Yes on Amendment 32. This amendment, 
sponsored by Reps. Haaland, Tlaib and 
Ocasio-Cortez increases authorizations for 
renewable energy R&D accounts by 50% and 
adds an authorization for total funding for 
research, development, demonstration and 
commercialization activities for energy effi-
ciency and renewable energy R&D. 
Yes on En Bloc 1, Yes on En Bloc 2, No on 
En Bloc 3, YES on En Bloc 4. 
Sincerely, 
KATIE MURTHA, 
Vice President of Gov-
ernment 
Affairs, 
U.S. PIRG and Envi-
ronment America. 
LCV, 
WASHINGTON, DC, SEPTEMBER 24, 2020. 
Re Support H.R. 4447 and its pro-environ-
ment amendments. 
DEAR REPRESENTATIVE: The League of Con-
servation Voters (LCV) works to turn envi-
ronmental values into national priorities. 
Each year, LCV publishes the National Envi-
ronmental Scorecard, which details the vot-
ing records of members of Congress on envi-
ronmental legislation. The Scorecard is dis-
tributed to LCV members, concerned voters 
nationwide, and the media. 
As the House debates H.R. 4447, the Clean 
Economy Jobs and Innovation Act, LCV 
urges you to support the pro-environment 
amendments and reject weakening or anti- 
environment amendments, as listed below, 
and vote YES on final passage. This bill in-
cludes many great provisions to develop and 
deploy renewable and distributed energy re-
sources; improve the efficiency of our homes, 
schools, and businesses; electrify our trans-
portation sector; modernize the grid and en-
hance its resiliency; prioritize the needs of 
environmental justice communities; reduce 
climate pollution from industrial and tradi-
tional 
sources, 
and 
from 
ambient 
air. 
Though we do not support increased funding 
for projects that could extend the life of fos-
sil fuel-burning power plants or aging nu-
clear 
power 
infrastructure 
or 
prop 
up 
undemonstrated new nuclear projects, many 
of the amendments would improve those 
areas and build upon the significant positive 
environmental aspects of the bill. We urge 
support for amendments listed below offered 
singly or en bloc that will make the bill even 
stronger by protecting our communities and 
environment while investing in clean energy 
research, development, and deployment. And 
we urge you to reject anti-environment 
amendments listed below offered singly or en 
bloc.

amendments 
listed 
above, and oppose anti-environment amend-
ments. We will strongly consider including 
votes on this legislation in the 2020 Score-
card. If you need more information, please 
call my office at (202) 785–8683 and ask to 
speak with a member of our government re-
lations team. 
Sincerely, 
GENE KARPINSKI, 
President. 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
wanted to reference some parts of this. 
With regard to the League of Con-
servation Voters, they specifically say 
that, with regard to H.R. 4447, they 
urge support for the legislation in gen-
eral and specifically ask that we reject 
weakening 
the 
antienvironmental 
amendments as listed below, and that 
includes this amendment en bloc No. 3. 
They say that we should vote ‘‘no’’ be-
cause the amendment would require 
the Department of Energy to evaluate 
potential sites in the DOE footprint for 
advanced nuclear research and dem-
onstration programs. 
In addition to that, in the letter from 
U.S. PIRG, it says: ‘‘On behalf of the 
U.S. Public Interest Research Group, 
Environmental America, and our tens 
of thousands of members, we urge you 
to support the Clean Economy Jobs 
and Innovation Act.’’ 
It talks about how the West is on fire 
and the hurricanes. ‘‘The climate crisis 
is here, and if we want to have any 
chance of avoiding its worst impacts, it 
is imperative that we take swift ac-
tion. The Clean Economy Jobs and In-
novation 
Act 
marks 
significant 
progress in the transition to a clean 
energy future and in the reduction of 
greenhouse gas emissions.’’ 
It goes on to talk about the various 
provisions and how they are helpful 
during the climate crisis. Then, it also 
specifically asks and urges a ‘‘no’’ vote 
on this en bloc amendment No. 3 be-
cause they do not consider that useful 
in terms of addressing the climate cri-
sis, and it is actually counter to envi-
ronmental concerns. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. WALDEN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, I just want to say in 
response to my friend and the words 
that he read, the groups he has identi-
fied, the notion that they would have 
these statements about wildfires in the 
West when, for 20 years, I have battled 
them to try to get more active forest 
management in our Western forests, 
and they oppose nearly everything we 
have tried to do to get our forests back 
into balance with nature. It is just a 
bit absurd today, as someone who has 
seen the devastation, and then seeing 
their politics and the fundraising they 
do off this and the scare tactics they 
level, and then the destruction that oc-
curs to habitats, wildlife, forests, and 
forested communities. And they stand 
in the way of it all. So the gentleman 
can have them. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to 
the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. JOHN-
SON). 
Mr. 
JOHNSON 
of 
Ohio. 
Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to speak about a 
missed opportunity, a missed oppor-
tunity to deliver for the American peo-
ple an energy strategy that advances 
America’s 
exceptionalism. 
Instead, 
while this energy package isn’t quite 
the radical left’s Green New Deal, it is 
certainly inspired by it. 
Madam Speaker, you have heard 
about the dozens of other amendments 
Republicans offered to show our vision 
for America’s energy future, including 
two of mine that would break down 
regulatory barriers to export more 
American LNG and advance America’s 
nuclear power technology. But those 
amendments were ruled out of order by 
the majority. 
What we are left with is unserious 
legislation that picks winners and los-
ers, throws billions of taxpayer dollars 
at green pet projects, and lacks the 
needed regulatory reforms to bring 
America’s energy economy into the 
21st century. 
Energy dominance is key for America 
to remain at the head of the global 
leadership table. Unfortunately, today 
was a missed opportunity to strength-
en America’s position, an exercise in 
futility since the Senate will not con-
sider this bill, nor should it. 
Madam Speaker, while I support this 
Republican en bloc of amendments, I 
urge my colleagues to oppose the un-
derlying bill. 
Mr. WALDEN. Madam Speaker, may 
I ask how much time each side has re-
maining. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from New Jersey has 6 minutes 
remaining. The gentleman from Oregon 
has 41⁄2 minutes remaining. 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, first of all, I wanted 
to rebut what was just said by my col-
league on our committee from the 
other side. The reality is that this bill 
is designed with the hope that we can 
come to a consensus on an energy 
package with the Senate on a bipar-
tisan basis. 
In fact, Senator LISA MURKOWSKI and 
Senator JOE MANCHIN are putting to-
gether an emergency package, which is 
not exactly the same as this, but the 
idea would be that we would have some 
kind of informal conference and actu-
ally adopt a bill that we have a con-
sensus on before the end of this session. 
I will point out that we actually 
worked very hard to try to do that 2 
years ago and came very close to ac-
complishing it. 
So I don’t want anyone here to think 
that this is a message vehicle. This is 
a vehicle that is exactly designed to 
try to reach an agreement on an en-
ergy package, albeit not a big one, that 
we could actually get signed into law 
by the end of the year. 
Madam Speaker, I also want to rebut 
the idea—somehow there is always this 
suggestion that when you do anything 
on our side of the aisle that it is not 
helping create more jobs. The reality is 
this bill is designed to do exactly that, 
to create more jobs. The bill supports 
the energy industry by providing re-
sources for projects, jobs, and tech-
nology interests, which are looking for-
ward and necessary for the energy 
transition. 
Clean energy, renewables, and energy 
efficiency sectors employ millions of 
Americans. As demand for these tech-
nologies increases and as prices de-
crease, these sectors will continue to 
grow. However, COVID–19 has harmed 
energy jobs across the board. Delayed 
or canceled projects, as well as social 
distancing, have particularly affected 
clean energy jobs and energy efficiency 
jobs. So this bill supports the nec-
essary sectors by investing in tech-
nologies and jobs that are future-look-
ing and can meet the challenge of cli-
mate change. 
My colleagues on the other side keep 
thinking of the energy sector as some-
thing that is totally oriented toward 
fossil fuels. The reality is that other 
countries, and us, we have to move to-
ward a clean energy economy that cre-
ates jobs. This bill includes workforce 
provisions that help provide training 
and transition resources for the energy 
sector. 
The bill includes Chairman RUSH’s 
Blue Collar to Green Collar Jobs Devel-
opment Act that establishes a nation-
wide program at the Department of En-
ergy to improve education and energy-

related industries. It trains under-
served groups, including women, mi-
norities, veterans, and unemployed en-
ergy workers, for energy careers. It 
supports the industries and jobs we 
need to navigate the energy transition. 
Again, I am not someone who says 
that we are only going to have certain 
energy sectors. We are going to need 
everything. But the bottom line is, we 
do have to think that, in the future, 
there is going to be a lot more in the 
clean energy sector than solar and 
wind. If we don’t start investing in and 
promoting the technologies, we are 
going to be left behind, and we are 
going to lose jobs. This helps us gain 
those jobs. 
I reserve the balance of my time, 
Madam Speaker. 
Mr. WALDEN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, I appreciate the 
comments of my friend from New Jer-
sey, the chairman of our committee. 
Unfortunately, however, the fact of the 
matter on the blue collar to green col-
lar jobs program is that the workforce 
training program would open the door 
for grants to help Americans get the 
education resources they need to be 
able to work in these areas. We had 
agreed that both those who worked in 
coal jobs and those who worked in nu-
clear jobs would be eligible for those 
grants as well. 
The underlying proposal that came 
out of our committee provided for 
workforce training for those men and 
women who work in coal-related jobs 
as well as in nuclear, but that got 
stripped out. 
So, Madam Speaker, if you are work-
ing in the nuclear energy industry or 
you are somehow connected to the coal 
industry, you have just been taken out 
of the mix to get additional grants for 
workforce training. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to 
the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. 
GRAVES). 
b 1215 
Mr. GRAVES of Louisiana. Madam 
Speaker, I thank my friend from Or-
egon for yielding. 
Madam Speaker, first of all, I re-
spond to comments earlier from my 
friend from New Mexico (Mr. LUJA´ N), 
who 
noted 
that the Congressional 
Budget Office’s score on this bill was 
zero. 
Madam Speaker, as we all know, this 
bill authorizes $135 billion in new pro-
grams. And so if my friend from New 
Mexico is suggesting that this whole 
thing is a charade and that my friends 
across the aisle do not anticipate actu-
ally seeking appropriations for this 
legislation, then it would be very inter-
esting to hear those comments, but I 
think to suggest that the bill does not 
implicate appropriations is simply mis-
leading, and I would urge that we have 
more transparency in this process. 
Madam Speaker, we have two amend-
ments that are in this en bloc, and 
what they do is, they focus on the crit-
ical minerals, the rare Earth minerals 
that are important components of re-
newable energy. It is what is used in 
solar panels. It is what is used in en-
ergy storage technology. You can’t 
suddenly say, Hey, we are going to use 
renewables, and not address this com-
ponent. 
What happens is the United States 
has become energy independent, and we 
have done that because of the policies 
that have been enacted over the last 
few years. What this bill does is, by not 
addressing the critical minerals, we be-
come energy dependent again. We be-
come dependent upon China, dependent 
upon Africa, and other nations where 
China controls the resources. Why 
would we do that to ourselves? 
So we have an amendment in this en 
bloc that helps to address that because 
we have those minerals right here in 
the United States. Why in the world 
would we go mine them in other coun-
tries that have lower environmental 
standards to where you have a net ad-
verse impact on the global environ-
ment? 
Madam Speaker, this is trying to na-
tionalize California policy—the 8th 
worst emissions in the United States is 
in California, twice the electricity 
costs of my home State of Louisiana. 
Why would we want to do that to 
Americans, disproportionately impact-
ing the poor? 
So we set up this farce process where 
this amendment goes down to where we 
miss the opportunity to ensure that we 
truly advance an America-first inde-
pendent energy policy. 
Madam Speaker, I urge opposition to 
this underlying legislation. 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, what I get from the 
other side of the aisle is that somehow 
they think we are going to live in 
splendid isolation here. I mean, that 
might have been nice in the 19th cen-
tury or the 18th century, or whenever, 
but that is not the reality of today. 
The reality is we are in constant com-
petition around the world. 
And while other countries move to-
wards a clean economy—whether it is 
Europe, Japan, whatever it is—they are 
then investing—not just them, China, 
India—they are then investing in these 
new technologies. And if I could use 
solar energy as an example: If we had 
taken the initiative a few years ago to 
actually invest in solar panels and 
wind turbines and the technologies 
that were coming about, we would have 
been able to sell a lot more of those 
panels and those turbines around the 
world and also use them for our own 
clean economy or clean initiatives. 
Instead, we didn’t, and now most of 
the solar panels are built in China, ex-
ported to the United States. 
You cannot fall behind. If you fall be-
hind in these technologies, then you 
are not going to be competitive, and 
you are going to lose out on this race, 
and you are going to have fewer jobs. 
You can’t just put your head in the 
sand, like some kind of ostrich, and say 
to the rest of the world, We don’t care, 
it doesn’t matter. It does matter. 
And all we are saying in this bill— 
and this is not the type of overall 
major climate bill that we would have 
to do eventually—this is a down pay-
ment. And the idea is to look at cer-
tain things that we can do now to in-
vest in technology, to look at innova-
tion so that we don’t fall behind, and 
we create the clean jobs of the future. 
In addition to that, the bill deals 
with energy efficiency, which is some-
thing that my colleagues on the other 
side of the aisle have never opposed— 
more resiliency. These are things that 
are important to deal with the climate 
changes that have occurred, to deal 
with the wildfires, to deal with the 
hurricanes, so that our grid and every-
thing is more resilient and we can deal 
with the impact of the climate crisis. 
Madam Speaker, I know that I am 
not going to be able to convince most 
Republicans to support this. I am hop-
ing that some will, and I am hoping 
that when we get this passed and we 
have conversations with the Senate, 
that we can actually do some kind of 
down payment in terms of creating the 
clean jobs of the future. And then in 
the next session of Congress, we will do 
a much larger initiative dealing with 
climate change. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. WALDEN. Madam Speaker, may 
I inquire how much each side has re-
maining. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from Oregon has 11⁄2 minutes re-
maining. The gentleman from New Jer-
sey has 30 seconds remaining. 
Mr. WALDEN. Madam Speaker, I am 
prepared to close, and I yield myself 
such time as I may consume. 
Madam Speaker, the chairman and I 
have had a wonderful working relation-
ship during our time on the Committee 
on Energy and Commerce. 
I understand where he is headed with 
this. I just wish some of the things had 
been agreed to in a bipartisan way and 
the committee would have held firm as 
we moved forward with energy legisla-
tion. Everybody has got to do it their 
own way. 
I always figured that if I could come 
out of the House with a 300- or 400-vote 
margin and a big bipartisan push, we 
would have a lot more leverage with 
our friends in the Senate, regardless of 
who controlled the Senate. But a dif-
ferent path has been chosen here. 
Part of what we are concerned about 
on the Republican side is this supply 
chain vulnerability. And what we are 
arguing here is that we have witnessed 
what happens when we have a supply 
chain vulnerability during this pan-
demic. In fact, the very face mask that 
we are wearing—this one, actually, my 
wife made—we couldn’t get because 
China locked it down. 
We have seen that play out. Heck, 
you couldn’t even get toilet paper and

paper towels. Now that wasn’t nec-
essarily a China problem, but supply 
chains matter. Reliability on supply 
chains matters. 
And we have, as a country, locked up 
access to many of our areas on mining 
where you would get critical minerals. 
And we have relied on other countries 
and now, principally, China for our 
critical mineral supply chain. And you 
have to have that for our mobile 
phones, you have to have it for bat-
teries. And a lot of things, frankly, we 
all agree on, is the future for tech-
nology requires critical minerals. 
And 
meanwhile, China has gone 
around the world and locked up these 
resources in Africa and elsewhere, and 
as a result, they are really dominant in 
this space. And I don’t want us to be 
reliant on any other country, if we can 
avoid it. I realize we are global and 
there are things we don’t have here 
that we need to acquire elsewhere. 
Madam Speaker, we offered up these 
amendments and we look forward to 
further debate. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, I am certainly sym-
pathetic to this idea that we have to do 
more manufacturing here and not rely 
on overseas, but I believe very strongly 
that is what this bill is all about. It ac-
complishes the goal of moving forward 
with clean energy innovation and tech-
nology and bringing more manufac-
turing here. And I believe the amend-
ment, this en bloc amendment, will not 
help in that regard and, in fact, makes 
this a bill less prone to accomplish the 
goal of clean energy and job creation. 
Madam Speaker, I would urge opposi-
tion to the en bloc amendment, and I 
yield back the balance of my time.

ant to House Resolution 1129, the pre-
vious

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to House Resolution 1129, the gen-
tlewoman 
from 
New 
Mexico 
(Ms. 
HAALAND) and a Member opposed each 
will control 5 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from New Mexico. 
Ms. HAALAND. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to offer this amendment 
with my cosponsors, Representatives 
TLAIB and OCASIO-CORTEZ, in order to 
speed us along the path to a renewable 
energy future. 
Our amendment increases the au-
thorization levels for solar, wind, geo-
thermal and water-based energy re-
search and development programs by 50 
percent over the levels currently in the 
bill for each of the 5 years the bill cov-
ers. 
The amendment also adds an overall 
authorization level for research, devel-
opment, deployment, and commercial 
application activities within DOE’s Of-
fice of Energy Efficiency and Renew-
able Energy. For each of the 5 years in 
the bill, those authorization levels are 
110 percent of the funding levels for the 
carbon pollution reduction R&D activi-
ties in the bill. 
Technological innovation has long 
been seen as an important part of our 
efforts to take on climate change, in-
crease access to energy, and reduce air 
pollution. Increasing the efficiency of 
solar cells of wind turbines, developing 
new marine hydrokinetic generation 
technologies and lighter electric mo-
tors, and improving the storage capac-
ity and lifetime of batteries are just 
some of the innovations that will help 
us get to a 100 percent clean energy 
system. 
But according to the International 
Energy Agency’s Global Status of 
Clean Energy Innovation Report for 
2020, research and development spend-
ing on clean energy by its member 
countries has been relatively flat since 
2012, after a doubling spurt between 
2000 and 2012. Despite that doubling, 
IEA member country public spending 
on R&D remains below the levels it was 
in the 1980s. 
Private sector spending has fluc-
tuated with economic cycles—while 
there have been some growth years, the 
2007–2008 financial crisis and the 2014 
oil price crash led to slowdowns in cor-
porate clean energy R&D, and the 
share of global early stage venture cap-
ital investment going into clean energy 
has halved since 2012. 
And now, the COVID–19 pandemic has 
had a dramatic negative impact on pri-
vate sector funding for clean energy in-
novation, which is likely to cause set-
backs in the timeline for developing 
and 
improving 
clean 
energy 
tech-
nologies. 
The pandemic will also hurt dem-
onstration projects and early adoption 
of technologies that provide essential 
opportunities for us to ‘‘learn by 
doing’’ and figure out how to overcome 
practical obstacles to widespread de-
ployment of new technologies. 
The timing is extremely unfortunate 
because, as the IEA report makes clear, 
we need to be accelerating clean en-
ergy innovation to give the world the 
best chance to achieve our climate 
goals, and without strong sustained in-
vestment, our chances of success are 
dwindling. 
Madam Speaker, that is why our 
amendment is so important. With cli-
mate change accelerating, we can’t af-
ford to wait. We need to develop and 
deploy renewable energy widely soon, 
and to do that, the Federal Govern-
ment needs to invest in R&D and in de-
ployment and the technology matura-
tion needed to enable widespread adop-
tion of renewables and their integra-
tion into our energy system. 
This clean energy investment will be 
good for our planet and good for tax-
payers. Public renewable energy R&D 
in the United States has delivered a 27 
percent return on investment since 
1975, with the benefit-to-cost ratio of 
33–1. By making these investments, we 
are sending the message that renew-
able energy is our future, and we are 
committing to making that a reality.

Madam Speaker, I urge my col-

I reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. WALDEN. Madam Speaker, I

Mr. WALDEN. Madam Speaker, I

Mr. WEBER of Texas. Madam Speak-

Madam Speaker, I rise in opposition 
to this amendment. 
We have heard the same sensible 
logic from our side of the aisle count-
less times over the past 24 hours as we 
have debated this bill and these amend-
ments. The package is over-funded, in-
correctly prioritized, and a partisan 
process nightmare. 
So in a way, I guess it is fitting that 
this is the only standalone amendment 
we will consider today. It is one that is 
seeking even more funding for one of 
this bill’s most misguided priorities.

merce said it best when they penned 
that this bill needed to avoid ‘‘conten-
tious and extraneous issues’’ for this 
bill to be supported. 
Let me tell you, the Democrats’ 
unyielding focus on massive increases 
to applied energy and, in particular, for 
the DOE’s already well-funded Office of 
Energy Efficiency and Renewable En-
ergy is the most contentious issue 
here. 
By now, I am sure you can all say it 
along with me, but I cannot stress it 
enough: It is basic research, not ap-
plied energy, that will put us in the 
best global position to develop the 
long-term clean energy solutions to ad-
dress our changing climate and, yes, 
lay the foundation for our clean and af-
fordable energy future for generations 
to come. 
The Office of Energy Efficiency and 
Renewable Energy has grown consider-
ably, starting with what was supposed 
to be a temporary recovery in the 
American Recovery and Reinvestment 
Act of 2009. Remember that? Tem-
porary. 
What was it President Reagan said? 
There is nothing more permanent on 
Earth than a temporary government 
program. Here is a great example. 
Today it is funded at $2.8 billion, with 
a B, which is more than DOE’s research 
in fossil energy, nuclear energy, elec-
tricity, and cybersecurity combined. 
And let me just say, there is no clean 
energy future without nuclear energy. 
H.R. 4447, just the base text, would 
spend more than $3.7 billion on the 
EERE programs. Really? This amend-
ment, which seeks to increase author-
izations by an additional 50 percent, 
can only be labeled as irresponsible. 
This is a contentious and extraneous 
issue. The country doesn’t have unlim-
ited Federal research funds. It just 
doesn’t. I am sorry to disappoint y’all. 
It doesn’t. 
Look, it is difficult, but we must set 
priorities 
and 
invest 
strategically. 
That is our job, folks. That is our job. 
This amendment does exactly the oppo-
site. 
As the ranking member of the Sub-
committee on Energy of the House 
Science Committee, I support an all-of- 
the-above energy strategy, and, yes, 
that includes renewable energy. Texas 
is number one in wind energy. But sup-
porting 
an 
all-of-the-above 
energy 
strategy does not mean increasing Fed-
eral investment for every R&D pro-
gram in perpetuity. 
What did Reagan say? Closest thing 
to eternity. 
I would like to ask my friends on the 
other side of the aisle, when—w-h-e-n— 
do we let the mature technologies of 
wind—w-i-n-d—and solar stand up on 
their own in the market without con-
tinued funding to ‘‘reduce market bar-
riers’’? Market barriers? The only bar-
rier is commonsense thinking that we 
don’t need to increase that funding. 
That is the barrier we are struggling 
against here. 
When do we acknowledge that the 
solar industry has an average annual 
growth rate of—check this out—49 per-
cent? And wind power has tripled over 
the past decades, Texas being the lead-
er. These industries don’t need our sup-
port for deployment. They are already 
in the market and growing, for Pete’s 
sake. 
This kind of duplicative and short-
sighted strategy, while it may result in 
politically expedient talking points—I 
give y’all that. 
Madam Speaker, I hope that we will 
vote against this. I hope you will help 
us, Madam Speaker. 
Ms. HAALAND. Madam Speaker, in 
closing, I would just like to say it 
again: Technological innovation has 
long been seen as an important part of 
our efforts to take on climate change 
and increase access to energy, and my 
amendment will strengthen our invest-
ment in innovation. 
I urge my colleagues to support this 
amendment, and I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to House Resolution 1129, the pre-
vious 
question 
is 
ordered 
on 
the 
amendment offered by the gentle-
woman 
from 
New 
Mexico

PARLIAMENTARY INQUIRY 
Mr. WALDEN. Madam Speaker, point 
of parliamentary inquiry. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman will state his parliamentary in-
quiry. 
Mr. WALDEN. Madam Speaker, I 
thought we had gotten past where we 
couldn’t reconsider, that was part of 
the motion, and so a recorded vote was 
not in order. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
yeas and nays were ordered on the 
amendment, and further proceedings 
were postponed pursuant to clause 8 of 
rule XX.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to House Resolution 1129, the gen-
tleman from California (Mr. LEVIN) and 
the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. WAL-
DEN) each will control 10 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from California. 
Mr. LEVIN of California. Madam 
Speaker, all we have to do is look at 
the last few weeks in my great State of 
California and see record wildfires, 3.6 
million acres and counting. And we 
have seen this all throughout the West-
ern 
United 
States, 
truly 
unprece-
dented. 
And we also have seen smoke. All I 
had to do a few weeks ago is just open 
the window, even though I am miles 
away from the center of any of the 
wildfires, and we could see the thick, 
dark smoke, gray and orange. We saw 
the pictures in the city of San Fran-
cisco. It is truly unprecedented in our 
great State of California. 
The amendment that we are offering 
will hopefully uncover the true cost of 
this smoke. We must figure out exactly 
what type of health impacts wildfire 
smoke is having, not just in California, 
but everywhere where this has im-
pacted our communities throughout 
the Western United States. 
So we are also going to need to de-
velop better smoke forecasts. This 
amendment would do that. And it di-
rects the EPA to collect data and co-
ordinate research on the impacts of 
acute 
air 
pollution 
exposure 
from 
wildfires. It is $100 million that I think 
is well spent. 
An article published just a few days 
ago, September 19, in the Los Angeles 
Times, is titled, ‘‘How Bad Is All That 
Wildfire Smoke to Our Long-Term 
Health? ‘Frankly, We Don’t Really 
Know.’ ’’ We don’t really know, and 
that is why we need this research, this 
funding. 
A good friend of mine from Stanford 
University, my alma mater, an econo-
mist named Marshall Burke, has done 
great work on the cost of climate 
change and the cost of inaction. He has 
estimated that between 1,000 and 3,000 
excess deaths—think of that number, 
1,000 and 3,000 excess deaths—will be 
caused 
by 
the 
smoke 
from 
these 
wildfires. Five thousand extra visits to 
the emergency room in California will 
be caused by these wildfires. 
And we know from other research at 
Harvard University and elsewhere that 
short-term changes in particulate mat-
ter of 2.5, and other criteria air pollut-
ants, dramatically increase mortality. 
It is very clear: Wildfire smoke is a 
dominant source of air pollution in the 
United States in some years. Health 
costs associated with wildfire exposure 
are greater than we thought, pre-
viously. 
The more we learn about this, the 
more we recognize just what a signifi-
cant toll this is taking on our health, 
on our ability to deal with the eco-
nomic impacts that this causes. And 
we have seen, in California, some of the 
studies on things like preterm birth, 
this has had an impact even on preterm 
birth. 
And, of course, as is so often the 
case, when we talk about environ-
mental issues, environmental justice is 
key here. We know that the poor and 
communities of color have been im-
pacted most by this as well. 
In my district, we have got the Uni-
versity of California at San Diego, 
Scripps Institution of Oceanography, 
and I am very proud of all of the work 
they are doing. 
One of the researchers there recently 
made the link between air pollution 
and increased risk of COVID–19 and, 
specifically, the severity of symptoms 
that one would get if they were to have 
COVID–19 and if they were to be im-
pacted by wildfire smoke. It could ex-
acerbate the degree to which COVID–19 
causes more serious conditions. 
As that researcher said: ‘‘I really 
hope I am wrong, but what we may ex-
pect to see in the next few weeks is an 
increase in the fatality rate from 
COVID–19.’’ 
So we know that wildfire smoke is 
here. This is not theoretical. Often-
times, when we talk about climate 
change, we think of something in the 
future; we think of something theo-
retical. 
One of the things that I so appreciate 
about this legislation, and specifically 
about this amendment and the series of 
amendments from Mr. SCHRADER and 
my 
friends 
from 
California—JOSH 
HARDER, AMI BERA, MIKE THOMPSON, 
and JIMMY
PANETTA—is that all of 
these amendments are things that im-
pact us in the here and now. 
Wildfire smoke is not some far-off, 
theoretical thing that may or may not

happen in the future. We know that it 
is happening, and happening right now. 
So, as I mentioned, in addition to our 
amendment, which establishes a pro-
gram to improve wildfire smoke emis-
sions modeling and to develop smoke 
forecasts and directs EPA to collect 
data and coordinate research on the 
impacts of acute air pollution exposure 
from wildfires, Mr. SCHRADER of Oregon 
has an amendment that would estab-
lish the home wildfire risk reduction 
rebate program to provide rebates to 
homeowners to defray the cost of retro-
fitting an existing home to be wildfire 
resistant. 
Of course, we are thinking of all of 
our friends throughout the Pacific 
Northwest. We have family in Oregon 
and Washington that have been so dra-
matically impacted by all of this. 
As I mentioned, my friends JOSH 
HARDER, AMI BERA, and MIKE THOMP-
SON, all fantastic Representatives from 
northern California—and they have 
really borne the brunt of the wildfires 
throughout 
California—have 
offered 
amendments that, among other things, 
create a geospatial map that depicts 
wildfire risk around utilities to allow 
for better planning, for grid hardening, 
vegetation 
management, 
emergency 
access points, and more. 
Their amendments also establish an 
electricity reliability standard regard-
ing extreme weather events and direct 
the Department of Energy to help 
States and local utilities on ways to 
improve the resiliency of their elec-
trical grids. It is so important that we 
study these wildfires and we under-
stand the impact on our electricity 
grid. 
My friend Representative PANETTA 
offers several amendments, including 
one that expands weatherization assist-
ance for low-income families and en-
hancement in innovation to cover the 
use of materials that are resistant to 
high heat and fire in dwellings occu-
pied by low-income persons in areas at 
risk from drought and wildfires. 
I think it is important to just men-
tion we are not talking about wildfires 
in a vacuum. We have seen record 
drought and record temperatures, and 
those conditions create the environ-
ment that we now have seen that cre-
ates these wildfire risks. 
Finally, my friend Representative 
BERA has an amendment that directs 
the Secretary of Energy to support 
R&D on tools and technologies for im-
proving the electric grid and the en-
ergy sector for safety and resilience 
during concurrent or colocated severe 
weather events. 
b 1245 
I am extremely proud at the support 
that we have been able to achieve for 
these amendments, and for the package 
for H.R. 4447. It is a comprehensive bill 
that we really do need to move forward 
on. 
It has been a dozen years, a dozen 
years, since we have been able to up-
date the structure and the authoriza-
tions of critical clean energy research 
and demonstration programs at the De-
partment of Energy, and we have 
learned so much about our environ-
ment, about climate change. 
I graduated from law school in 2005, 
and I became an environmental attor-
ney and a clean energy advocate work-
ing in a variety of clean energy organi-
zations, businesses, and now as a legis-
lator. And what I can tell you is that 
between the time I graduated from law 
school in 2005 and today, we know sig-
nificantly more, and much different in-
formation about climate change than 
we did back then. Yet, we have not up-
dated the research and development 
now for 12 years, it is simply unaccept-
able. 
So our amendment and the other 
amendments that I discussed will go a 
long way, and I hope we can achieve bi-
partisan consensus in this, and in the 
months and years ahead to actually 
tackle these problems as they face 
Californians. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. WALDEN. Madam Speaker, I ap-
preciate my friend from California’s 
comments, especially about the smoke 
and his sympathy for the folks all 
across the West, and especially in the 
Pacific Northwest. I am a native Ore-
gonian and, tragically, we have been 
choking on smoke for a very long time, 
for decades and decades, as these forest 
fires have burned unnaturally because 
fuel concentrations are unnatural. 
You know, we did a great job as 
Americans with Smokey the Bear and 
putting out fires. For 100 years we have 
fought fire. The problem is that in the 
last 50 years there have been court de-
cisions, lots of litigation, lawsuits to 
stop active forest management. We lost 
tens of thousands of jobs that used to 
take place in our rural forested com-
munities of people that would go out 
and tend to our forests. When they 
would harvest, they would replant. If 
there was a fire, they were on the scene 
to help put it out. All that went away 
through litigation and lawsuits. 
In the early 2000s, I worked with 
then-President 
Bush 
to 
pass 
the 
Healthy Forests Restoration Act, to 
allow us to get in, at least in the 
wildland-urban interface, and thin out 
these unnatural stands, get them back 
in balance with nature. The Forest 
Service tells us today 63 million acres 
of our national forests, America’s peo-
ple’s forests, are at high risk of fire. It 
is out of balance. We have 7 million of 
those acres in my home State of Or-
egon. 7 million acres. We treat some-
thing like 2 million a year. 
Under President Trump and his ad-
ministration, they have taken this se-
riously and they have increased the 
amount of thinning that is going on 
out there to reduce the fuel load by 20 
to 25 percent over what it was when he 
took office. 
Timber harvest is up, too, but you 
can’t catch up at that rate because for-
ests are very dynamic, they continue 
to grow, they continue to die. I have 
forest scientists who will tell me in 
some parts of my State there are lit-
erally 1,000 trees on an acre, where in 
historic times there might have been 10 
or 12. 
See, 
fire 
naturally 
would 
come 
through and thin out on a regular 
basis, and then humans interceded, and 
said, Well, we are going to stop fire. 
And for a long time, they weed-man-
aged it and thinned the forest, and now 
all that kind of went by the wayside as 
well. And, tragically, now the U.S. For-
est Service budget, more than half of it 
goes to fight fire. We have had to set 
up enormous funds to fight fire. It 
didn’t used to be that way, and now our 
citizens suffer from the smoke. 
In my home State of Oregon, the 10 
worst air quality cities in the world 
were in Oregon. Oregon. The smoke 
was so bad when I drove from southern 
Oregon, where tragically, one of these 
fires—it was not a forest fire, it was a 
grass and brush fire that got away with 
an unusually strong wind, and it just 
became a blowtorch, and most likely 
was started by arson. That fire de-
stroyed more than 2,600 housing units 
and deeply, sadly, most of these were 
mobile homes, mobile home parks, and 
low-income housing. The poorest of the 
poor got hit the hardest. 
This was not forest, this was between 
a freeway and a highway, and it just 
took off. It was dry, because, you 
know, in the West we dry out in the 
summer, unlike back here where they 
get rain with a thunderstorm. But this 
wasn’t even lightning-caused. 
Meanwhile, in the canyons off the 
great Cascade Mountains, fire started 
up there, we don’t know how and, in 
some cases, again, this high wind may 
have triggered it with power lines or 
something of that nature. People lost 
their homes, habitat destroyed, com-
munities that had been there forever, 
wiped out, lives lost. 
So, indeed, we have this situation 
where, with climate change, drought, 
disease, bug infestation, and a ne-
glected forest, conditions are ripe for 
destruction. They are ripe for fires like 
this. But if you care about—and I think 
we all do—about the planet and about 
the climate and about reducing emis-
sions, then it is a failure of this Con-
gress, under Democrat rule, to not 
move forward with the legislation our 
colleague, a Yale forestry graduate, 
BRUCE WESTERMAN, has put forward, to 
go in and more actively treat these for-
ests to get them back in balance with 
nature. 
And, more importantly, when 70 per-
cent of the carbon emissions from a 
fire occur afterwards from the dead and 
decaying material that is left behind, 
we should be going in like Tribal gov-
ernments do, county and State govern-
ments do, they go in and manage their 
forests by removing the burned, dead 
debris, where it makes sense, and while 
it still has value, and they replant a 
new, healthy forest. I think we can all 
agree, new green trees sequester carbon 
better than dead, dying ones.

September 24, 2020 
Science is on our side in this matter, 
but the politics have not been on our 
side in the West. So we have not been 
able to make progress on changing 
Federal law that would actually make 
our forests and forest communities 
healthier and safer, more economically 
dynamic, and reduce emissions and fire 
and smoke. 
I have choked on that smoke the last 
10 days, as have my constituents and, 
sadly, we sent that smoke all the way 
to Europe and around the globe, and 
none of us wants to repeat that. 
So, hopefully, we can put old battles 
behind us. We can do something to 
treat American’s great forests and get 
them back in balance. We can go in and 
remove burned debris while it has 
value, creating jobs in our most impov-
erished counties, and plant new, green, 
healthy forests for the next generation. 
Indeed, that is our obligation and our 
duty, and we should do more. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. LEVIN of California. Madam 
Speaker, it is my honor to yield 1 
minute to the gentlewoman from Cali-
fornia (Ms. PELOSI), the distinguished 
Speaker of the House of Representa-
tives. 
Ms. 
PELOSI. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
I 
thank the gentleman for his leadership 
on 
this 
important 
issue. 
He 
has 
brought his experience in the private 
sector, and the nonprofit sector to Con-
gress to effectively address the climate 
crisis that we are facing. 
Madam Speaker, I join the distin-
guished ranking member of the com-
mittee in supporting this en bloc, and 
remind him that in 2018 we did have 
the fire budget act that readjusted—en-
abling us to spend money for fire pre-
vention, and that was bipartisan. 
I welcome your support for the en 
blocs and work to address this. The de-
scription that you make of the fire im-
pacts on the communities is a very, 
very serious one. We see it in Cali-
fornia, but we have seen it a few years 
ago and before. Unless you have seen 
it, you cannot really realize how de-
structive it is. It just obliterates the 
area. 
And then the smoke from those fires, 
as we say, the smoke from those fires 
is not stronger than the love that we 
have for each other to come back from 
all of this. But this legislation and 
these amendments will be helpful, and 
I thank the gentleman for his strong 
leadership on this. 
The threat of wildfires in our com-
munities and the ability to create 
clean energy jobs and innovation is an 
opportunity that we have here today. 
Across the country, extreme weather 
and climate events are being unleashed 
on our communities leaving tragedy 
and devastation in their wake. From 
wildfires in the West—which the distin-
guished ranking member referenced 
and that we have experienced—that are 
described as apocalyptic, which have 
killed at least 35 people, blanketed the 
entire country in haze, and burned an 
historic 3.7 million acres, more than 20 
times the amount last year. 
Horrific hurricanes in the Gulf Coast, 
some of the most severe to hit the 
southern States. I spoke to the Gov-
ernor of Louisiana, he told me that the 
hurricane that hit Louisiana was the 
most severe in the history of Lou-
isiana. I said, Even more so than 
Katrina? He said, Yes. Katrina’s dam-
age sprang from the hurricane, but also 
the levees collapsing. This is about the 
severity of the hurricane. And then fre-
quency, they have had more hurricanes 
since then. They are running out of 
names to label them. They said they 
may have to go to the Greek alphabet. 
Heat waves across America, with this 
summer being the hottest ever summer 
recorded in the northern hemisphere, 
and the second hottest summer around 
the planet. Scientists tell us that 2020, 
a year filled with climate disasters, 
will be among the two hottest years 
ever recorded. 
Madam Speaker, Mother Nature is 
sending us a message, a clear sign that 
the climate crisis is real, it is deadly, 
and it is accelerating. 
The American people elected a Demo-
cratic 
House 
majority 
that 
would 
honor the science and honor our obliga-
tion to build a more resilient, green, 
and sustainable economy, not only for 
future generations tomorrow, but for 
our children today. 
I am proud of the work that Demo-
crats have taken since day one to com-
bat the climate crisis in a way that 
creates jobs and advances environ-
mental justice. This has been an all- 
caucus effort reflecting the energy of 
our freshmen, the expertise of our 
chairs, and the will of the American 
people, including: The Climate Action 
Now Act, keeping us in the Paris ac-
cords; the Moving Forward Act, mak-
ing a strong downpayment in a clean 
energy future; the Great American 
Outdoors Act, the most significant con-
servation bill in a generation, strongly 
bipartisan; Solving the Climate Crisis, 
our congressional action plan led by 
Chairwoman KATHY CASTOR, the most 
detailed, sweeping climate plan in 
American history, which endorses a na-
tional goal with net-zero pollution as 
soon as possible, 2050 at the latest. This 
plan protects American workers, safe-
guards vulnerable communities, grows 
the economy, and advances our pre-
eminence in green technologies. 
Now, today, we are taking the next 
step with the Clean Economy Jobs and 
Innovation Act. And, Madam Speaker, 
I say the next step. This is not exhaus-
tive of our solutions, and we have a lot 
of ideas in our caucus to debate and to 
prioritize, but this is an important 
next step. 
I salute all the committees of juris-
diction and chairs for their strategic, 
science-based leadership on the bills in 
this package. Energy and Commerce 
Chairman FRANK
PALLONE; Science, 
Space, and Technology Chairwoman, 
EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON; Natural Re-
sources 
Chairman 
RAU´ L
GRIJALVA, 
along with Congressmen MCEACHIN and 
RUIZ, for their collaborative efforts to 
include 
a 
transformative 
environ-
mental justice title; Select Committee 
on the Climate Crisis, KATHY CASTOR; 
Congresswoman ANNA
ESHOO, chair-
woman on the Subcommittee of Health 
in Energy and Commerce, leading the 
legislation to study the direct connec-
tion of wildfire smoke on public health, 
as you suggested. And also, Members 
from the West for offering amend-
ments, including the ones under con-
sideration now, to improve wildfire re-
search, resilience, and protect homes, 
communities, and public health. 
Again, I salute Congressman MIKE 
LEVIN for his leadership in this very 
important area. His election to Con-
gress took us way down the path in 
this fight to preserve the planet. 
Thank you, Mr. LEVIN. 
The 
legislation 
advances 
public 
health, financial, and national secu-
rity, and environmental justice. It 
takes actions that scientists, research-
ers, and experts tell us is needed: 
By launching the research and devel-
opment needed to unleash a clean en-
ergy revolution and reduce pollution in 
our communities; making a bold down-
payment for future climate action by 
modernizing America’s energy innova-
tion infrastructure; phasing down dan-
gerous HFCs, known as super pollut-
ants, which many experts believe is the 
single biggest action that the world 
can take to reduce global warming; 
putting our country on the path to net- 
zero pollution no later than 2050; and, 
critically protecting local communities 
by requiring Federal agencies to better 
understand the impact of new projects 
on public health and the environment, 
and to provide meaningful participa-
tion for indigenous and environmental 
communities. This is so absolutely im-
portant to have our Indian Country in-
volved in these decisions. 
b 1300 
As the League of Conservation Vot-
ers wrote today: ‘‘This bill includes 
many great provisions to develop and 
deploy renewable and distributed en-
ergy resources; improve the efficiency 
of our homes, schools, and businesses; 
electrify our transportation sector; 
modernize the grid and enhance its re-
silience; prioritize the needs of envi-
ronmental justice in communities; re-
duce climate pollution from industrial 
and traditional sources, and from am-
bient air.’’ 
Then they go on to say: ‘‘Though we 
do not support increased funding for 
projects that could extend the life of 
fossil fuel-burning power plants or 
aging nuclear power infrastructure or 
prop up undemonstrated new nuclear 
projects, many of the amendments 
would improve those areas and build 
upon the significant positive environ-
mental aspects of the bill.’’ This is 
very important, ‘‘build upon the sig-
nificant positive environmental as-
pects of the bill.’’ 
‘‘We urge support for the amend-
ments . . . that will make the bill even

stronger by protecting our commu-
nities and environment while investing 
in clean energy research, development, 
and deployment.’’ 
This important legislation is an im-
portant step—I keep saying it is not 
everything; it is a step—to advance cli-
mate action. But much more is needed. 
Unfortunately, many in our govern-
ment continue to deny the science and 
refuse to act. As seen earlier this 
month, when I hosted the G7 Speakers’ 
Meeting on ‘‘Addressing the Climate 
Crisis With Economic and Environ-
mental Justice for All,’’ no other coun-
try in that mix of the G7 and the Presi-
dent of the European Union, who was 
also participating, no other country is 
in denial about the climate crisis and 
the impact that human activity has on 
it. 
Sadly, only in America is there con-
tempt for science, public health, and 
the role of government. 
Madam Speaker, when I first became 
Speaker in 2007, the first bill we put on 
the floor was to establish a Select 
Committee on Climate and Energy. We 
passed that bill working with President 
Bush. It was the biggest energy bill in 
the history of our country. It was the 
equivalent of taking millions of cars 
off the road. We came to terms with an 
agreement, and he was delighted to 
have a signing ceremony for this bill. 
Since then, there has been denial 
about the climate crisis. After becom-
ing Speaker again in this Congress, I 
established a Select Committee on the 
Climate Crisis, which KATHY CASTOR 
chairs. 
So this has been a very high priority. 
It is a high priority for public health, 
clean air, clean water, ending the pol-
lutants, diminishing the pollutants. 
Secondly, it is a jobs issue. Jobs, 
jobs, jobs, clean energy jobs making us 
preeminent in the world. 
It is a national security issue. Our se-
curity experts tell us that drought and 
famine, so much is caused by the cli-
mate crisis. Increased competition for 
habitat, resources, and the rest cause 
mass migrations. It is a national secu-
rity issue. 
It is a moral issue. If you believe, as 
I do, that this planet is God’s creation, 
we have a moral responsibility to be 
good stewards of it. This is believed by 
many in the evangelical community. 
But even if you don’t share this belief 
from a religious standpoint, from a 
moral standpoint, we have a responsi-
bility to pass the planet on to future 
generations as best we can. 
Again, the American people, includ-
ing young people, scientists, faith lead-
ers, grassroots environmental justice 
advocates, are demanding climate ac-
tion now to protect their lives and pro-
tect their livelihoods. 
I urge Members, including the Repub-
licans whose bills are included in this 
package, to listen to the public and 
pass this commonsense and science- 
based legislation and redouble our ef-
forts to combat the climate crisis. 
Heed the message that Mother Earth 
is sending us. Lives are at stake. We 
have no time to waste. I urge an ‘‘aye’’ 
vote on these en bloc amendments and 
on final passage of the legislation. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentleman from California 
has expired. 
Mr. WALDEN. Madam Speaker, may 
I inquire as to how much time is re-
maining. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from Oregon has 41⁄2 minutes re-
maining. 
Mr. WALDEN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from 
California (Mr. LAMALFA), my friend 
and colleague, a real leader on natural 
resource issues. 
Mr. LAMALFA. Madam Speaker, I 
thank my colleague from Oregon for 
yielding and for his leadership on this 
bill today. I appreciate the work in this 
current bloc on forestry as Oregon, 
California, and so much of the West is 
experiencing yet another year of such 
devastating fire. 
I want to hearken back to a previous 
bloc here while I have the opportunity. 
It has to do with the Klamath dams 
that are owned by PacifiCorp in north-
ern California and Oregon. 
Now, there is the need to continue 
those dams’ ability to operate. Unfor-
tunately, my California colleague on 
the other side of the aisle is insisting 
on an amendment that would make it 
impossible to continue that operation 
even during a time of uncertainty as to 
the efficacy of dam removal or what-
ever the disposal of those will be. It is 
up in the air. The science is not clear. 
The amendment that is being pro-
posed might be the worst attempt at a 
veiled threat that I have seen in a long 
time on threatening a company in the 
operation of current dams. Rather than 
work with PacifiCorp, the hope seems 
to be that the House of Representatives 
can be used in this en bloc for a per-
sonal vendetta in defying the will of 
the people in the area. 
The owner of these dams has signed 
on to both agreements that con-
templated removal under the right con-
ditions. Congress didn’t bring an agree-
ment up for consideration. Local voters 
overwhelmingly rejected the dam re-
moval. The corporation that my col-
league is attempting to attack has 
been supportive for nearly 15 years. 
Under the guise of what my colleague 
would call ‘‘more stringent reporting 
requirements,’’ this amendment would 
directly increase power costs on tens of 
thousands of rural Americans across 
the West, requiring six new studies, re-
ports, and disclosures every year at the 
cost of PacifiCorp. Complying with all 
of this will not be free. Regular fami-
lies will see their power costs go up at 
a time when our power grid in Cali-
fornia especially is in big trouble. This 
is wrong-headed. 
Mr. WALDEN. Madam Speaker, I 
thank my colleague from California for 
his remarks. 
Madam Speaker, I yield myself the 
balance of my time. 
I want to go back to the issue under-
lying this, which is wildfires and 
smoke. When I chaired the Energy and 
Commerce Committee, I held hearings 
each year, which have been continued 
under Chairman PALLONE, looking at 
the health impacts of wildfire smoke 
on our citizens in America as relates to 
the Clean Air Act. 
I remember we had a gentleman from 
southern Oregon who had sent me a 
photo of his CPAP, his air-breathing 
filter, that had turned dark within a 
day or two. We had county commis-
sioners tell me that when they opened 
their windows at night, the smoke 
alarm went off in their house. It was 
that bad. 
We continue to have that, and it has 
been going on for a very long time. It 
is sad we had to get to this point for 
many to recognize who don’t have to 
live with that as we all have to. 
There is so much more we can and 
should do, and I appreciate Speaker 
PELOSI’s comments about fixing the 
fire borrowing problem. We did that 
jointly and in a bipartisan, bicameral 
way. It was long overdue. 
But I am just going to close by say-
ing you still have 60, 70 million acres of 
lands out there that we have responsi-
bility for. They are the public’s lands 
that are completely out of balance. Na-
ture tells us that. Scientists reinforce 
that. And we need to do something 
about that. 
Hopefully—I am leaving Congress at 
the end of this year—future Congresses 
will figure a way through this thicket 
because if we don’t act, you won’t have 
forests left, and a whole generation 
will never know what we have had the 
great joy to see, big healthy tree 
stands and habitat, freshwater and fish, 
and all of that that is the Northwest. It 
is going away in large measure every 
summer, and it will be a generation be-
fore you can drive over the Cascade 
Mountains on these routes and see 
what we got to see for our generation 
as it burns up and goes away. 
We need to take out the burned, dead 
material while it has value. We need to 
plant green, new trees. We need to fully 
understand the impacts of smoke and 
then do everything in our power to 
minimize these fires and their dev-
astating, tragic, and deadly effects. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. The pre-
vious question is ordered on the bill, as 
amended. 
The question is on the engrossment 
and third reading of the bill. 
The bill was ordered to be engrossed 
and read a third time, and was read the 
third time. 
MOTION TO RECOMMIT 
Mr. LUCAS. Mr. Speaker, I have a 
motion to recommit at the desk. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is the 
gentleman opposed to the bill? 
Mr. LUCAS. Mr. Speaker, I am op-
posed in its current form. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Clerk will report the motion to recom-
mit. 
The Clerk read as follows: 
Mr. Lucas moves to recommit the bill H.R. 
4447 to the Committee on Energy and Com-
merce with instructions to report the same 
back to the House forthwith, with the fol-
lowing amendment: 
At the end of the bill, insert the following: 
Subtitle G—Prohibition on the Transfer of 
Intellectual Property 
SEC. 12701. STATE-OWNED ENTERPRISES PROHI-
BITION. 
(a) INNOVATE
IN
AMERICA.—None of the 
funds authorized or made available by this 
Act, or the amendments made by this Act, 
may be used in awarding a grant, loan, or 
demonstration project to an entity that fails 
to certify that resulting intellectual prop-
erty, technologies, and data, for the purpose 
authorized, will not be transferred to any 
other entity that— 
(1) is determined to be of risk by the Sec-
retary of Energy in consultation with the 
Under Secretary for Science; the Under Sec-
retary of Energy; the Under Secretary for 
Nuclear Security; and the Department of En-
ergy’s Office of Intelligence and Counter-
intelligence; 
(2) is identified as a nonmarket economy 
country (in accordance with section 771(18) of 
the Tariff Act of 1930 (19 U.S.C. 1677(18))) as 
of the date of enactment of this Act; or 
(3) was identified by the United States 
Trade Representative in the most recent re-
port submitted under section 182 of the 
Trade Act of 1974 (19 U.S.C. 2242) as a priority 
foreign country under subsection (a)(2) of 
such section. 
(b) INTERNATIONAL AGREEMENTS.—This sec-
tion shall be applied in a manner consistent 
with the obligations of the United States 
under international agreements. 
Page 9, in the table of contents, after the 
matter relating to section 12606, insert the 
following: 
Subtitle G—Prohibition on the Transfer of 
Intellectual Property 
Sec. 12701. State-owned enterprises prohibi-
tion. 
Mr. LUCAS (during the reading). Mr. 
Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to 
dispense with the reading. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Oklahoma? 
There was no objection. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from 
Oklahoma is recognized for 5 minutes 
in support of his motion. 
Mr. LUCAS. Mr. Speaker, my motion 
will ensure that none of the $135 billion 
in taxpayer funds authorized in H.R. 
4447 will be used to build up foreign 
countries’ intellectual property and 
technology at the expense of our own. 
Specifically, in order to receive Fed-
eral grants, loans, or demonstration 
money through H.R. 4447, organizations 
must certify that the results of that 
funding, whether technology, intellec-
tual property, or data, will not become 
the property of a foreign state-owned 
enterprise. 
Mr. Speaker, China has made it an 
explicit goal to surpass the United 
States as the global frontrunner in 
science and technology. The Chinese 
Communist Party’s Made in 2025 initia-
tive outlines a clear strategy to get 
ahead of us in critical technologies and 
industries of the future. 
Part of the CCP strategy is acquiring 
U.S. technology and intellectual prop-
erty, whether through investment, co-
ercion, or theft. 
Let me repeat that: through invest-
ment, coercion, or, yes, even theft. 
This isn’t a hypothetical situation. 
Already, China has recruited U.S.-fund-
ed researchers for things like the Thou-
sand Talents program. 
This is much more than a single re-
cruitment program or an exchange of 
knowledge. Researchers joining the 
Thousand Talents program sign legally 
binding contracts that require them to 
transfer information and property to 
China. 
We have seen a consistent pattern 
where China expresses interest in a 
specific technology and then the U.S. 
experiences intellectual property theft 
in that same technology. 
The full scope of the CCP’s influence 
and presence in the U.S. is not entirely 
known to the public, but FBI Director 
Christopher Wray has said that the Bu-
reau is opening a new China-related 
counterintelligence case about every 10 
hours. 
Simply put, we are spending the 
time, the money, and the effort to 
plant the seeds of new technologies, 
but China is the one harvesting the 
crop. We cannot afford to spend $135 
billion in taxpayers’ funds on tech-
nologies that China will then steal and 
use to compete against us. We must 
protect our Nation’s research and in-
tellectual property. 
The Trump administration has taken 
good steps towards protecting Amer-
ican IP from Chinese aggression, but 
we must do more to work together to 
protect sensitive American research 
while maintaining the spirit of open 
science that has fueled, literally, gen-
erations of discoveries. 
Mr. Speaker, this motion provides 
commonsense, practical protections for 
taxpayer-funded research and the in-
calculable innovations it creates. I 
urge my colleagues to support this mo-
tion and ensure that we are not spend-
ing billions of dollars on research that 
China will then use to outcompete us. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
Ms DeGETTE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in 
opposition to the motion to recommit.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4948 
September 24, 2020 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tlewoman from Colorado is recognized 
for 5 minutes. 
Ms. DEGETTE. Mr. Speaker, I have 
reviewed the motion to recommit, and 
I must say to the gentleman, I cer-
tainly agree with the concept that the 
gentleman from Oklahoma says is in 
this motion to recommit, but, trag-
ically, a reading of the motion shows 
that that is just not true. 
The gentleman says that he is trying 
to stop foreign powers from getting 
control over our intellectual property, 
but if you look at this amendment, it 
basically gives ultimate power to the 
administration to decide who is at risk 
and who shall not be or shall be al-
lowed to be certified. 
Section A(1) here says these tech-
nologies will not be transferred if it is 
determined to be at risk to the Sec-
retary of Energy in consultation with 
others. 
At risk for what? At risk to whom? 
We simply don’t know by reading this. 
And what it could do is it could exempt 
entities that, for example, have invest-
ments by U.S. Government officials or 
relatives of U.S. Government officials. 
We just don’t know. And what it is is 
just a power grab by the administra-
tion. 
We agree with the concept. We 
shouldn’t be allowing intellectual prop-
erty to be transferred to foreign gov-
ernments, but that is not what this 
motion to recommit does. That is why 
we should all oppose the motion to re-
commit, and we should, of course, all 
vote ‘‘yes’’ on the Clean Economy Jobs 
and Innovation Act. 
What this bill does is it makes long- 
overdue reforms to U.S. energy policy, 
and it authorizes major investments in 
the transition to a low-carbon future, 
which we so desperately need. 
We saw from all of the amendments 
that we passed, Democratic and Repub-
lican 
amendments 
that 
we 
passed 
today, how this bill, together, can real-
ly usher in a new era for American in-
novation, serve as a down payment on 
comprehensive climate action, and can 
also create jobs and stimulate our 
economy. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge all of our Mem-
bers to take a close look at this motion 
to recommit and see what the real 
damage it could do will be. 
Vote ‘‘no’’ on the motion to recom-
mit, and vote ‘‘yes’’ for clean energy 
jobs and innovation. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Without 
objection, the previous question is or-
dered on the motion to recommit. 
There was no objection. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion to recommit. 
The question was taken; and the 
Speaker pro tempore announced that 
the noes appeared to have it. 
Mr. LUCAS. Mr. Speaker, on that I 
demand the yeas and nays. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to section 3 of House Resolution 
965, the yeas and nays are ordered. 
The vote was taken by electronic de-
vice, and there were—yeas 193, nays 
214, not voting 23, as follows:

late honorable Ruth Bader Ginsburg, 
Associate Justice of the United States 
Supreme Court, and ask for its imme-
diate consideration in the House. 
The Clerk read the title of the con-
current resolution. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from Washington? 
There was no objection. 
The text of the concurrent resolution 
is as follows: 
S. CON. RES. 45 
Resolved by the Senate (the House of Rep-
resentatives concurring), That the Architect of 
the Capitol is authorized and directed to 
transfer to the custody of the Supreme Court 
of the United States the catafalque which is 
situated in the crypt beneath the Rotunda of 
the Capitol so that such catafalque may be 
used in the Supreme Court Building in con-
nection with services to be conducted there 
for the late honorable Ruth Bader Ginsburg, 
Associate Justice of the United States Su-
preme Court. The custody of the catafalque 
shall then be returned to the Architect of 
the Capitol to be used in connection with 
such services to be conducted in National 
Statuary Hall. 
The concurrent resolution was con-
curred in. 
A motion to reconsider was laid on 
the table. 
f 
HELPING AMERICA’S SMALL 
BUSINESSES 
(Mr. SCALISE asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. SCALISE. Mr. Speaker, nor-
mally, we would do the colloquy with 
the majority leader. He and I will not 
be doing that this week, but I know we 
do still have real concerns about those 
families and businesses that are strug-
gling today through these difficult 
times. Many of those businesses were 
able to get relief through the Paycheck 
Protection Program, a program that 
we all came together to get agreement 
on, to help millions of small busi-
nesses. Over 50 million jobs were saved 
by that program. 
We also know there is about $138 bil-
lion still remaining in that fund, but 
the fund has expired. So I want to 
bring attention to things we can do to-
gether to alleviate that, to help those 
small businesses with that remaining 
money, and to talk about that more. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentle-
woman from Washington (Ms. HERRERA 
BEUTLER). 
REQUEST TO DISCHARGE COMMITTEE FROM 
FURTHER CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 8265 
Ms. 
HERRERA 
BEUTLER. 
Mr. 
Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that 
the Committee on Small Business be 
discharged from further consideration 
of the bill (H.R. 8265) to extend the 
Paycheck Protection Program access 
for small businesses, to extend the life-
line that southwest Washington busi-
nesses—over 9,500 have taken advan-
tage of, and have saved 92,000 jobs in 
southwest Washington and across this 
country, and ask for its immediate 
consideration in the House. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under 
guidelines consistently issued by suc-
cessive Speakers, as recorded in sec-
tion 956 of the House Rules and the 
Manual, the Chair is constrained not to 
entertain the request unless it has been 
cleared by the bipartisan floor and 
committee leaderships. 
Mr. SCALISE. Mr. Speaker, we will 
still push the majority to put that bill 
on the suspension calendar. We have no 
doubt it would pass overwhelmingly. 
We will continue to fight for those 
small businesses. 
f 
NATIONAL MUSEUM OF THE 
SURFACE NAVY 
(Ms. BARRAGA´ N asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
her remarks.) 
Ms. BARRAGA´ N. Mr. Speaker, com-
missioned in 1943, the USS Iowa was 
the most powerful American warship of 
her time. The ship saw action in World 
War II, and even transported President 
Franklin D. Roosevelt. 
Since 2012, the battleship has been 
berthed in my district in San Pedro, 
California. 
Today, Senator FEINSTEIN and I in-
troduced a resolution to formally name 
the Battleship USS Iowa Museum the 
‘‘National Museum of the Surface 
Navy.’’ This resolution honors the men 
and women who have served and con-
tinue to serve in the surface forces of 
our Nation by designating this museum 
as a monument to their sacrifice. 
In decades past, the USS Iowa de-
fended our Nation. Today, it educates 
the next generation as a museum and 
promotes the causes of veterans. 
Given the challenges of operating the 
museum in the COVID–19 era, I say 
thank you to the dedicated people who 
have kept this museum afloat—lit-
erally. 
f 
NATIONAL NATURAL DISASTER 
PREPAREDNESS MONTH 
(Mr. PALAZZO asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. PALAZZO. Mr. Speaker, I rise in 
support of my neighbors in Alabama 
and Florida who bore the brunt of de-
struction from Hurricane Sally when it 
made landfall on September 16. We 
keep all those who were affected in our 
prayers as they rebuild. 
Mississippi was lucky to be spared 
this time, but tragedy comes with an 
important lesson. We must be prepared. 
I will be the first to say that even I 
could have been better prepared for 
this storm after seeing the devastation 
throughout lower Alabama and the 
panhandle. 
September is National Natural Dis-
aster Preparedness Month, and hurri-
cane season is still well underway. I en-
courage everyone who calls the Gulf 
and Atlantic Coast home to review the 
FEMA 
hurricane 
guidelines. 
From 
knowing your evacuation route to hav-
ing all the essentials to leave, if nec-
essary, when a storm is headed our 
way, we will be better prepared to 
weather it together. 
Natural disasters are inevitable, and 
it is our responsibility as elected offi-
cials and as individuals, to prepare for 
them and recover responsibly. For 
those impacted by Hurricane Sally, I 
wish you a swift recovery. 
Don’t just build back, build forward. 
f 
RECOGNIZING DR. JOE CASTRO— 
FRESNO STATE UNIVERSITY 
(Mr. COSTA asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. COSTA. Mr. Speaker in honor of 
Hispanic Heritage Month, I recognize a 
Latino leader who has been an inspira-
tion and a role model to thousands of 
students in my home of Fresno, the 
San Joaquin Valley, and that is Dr. Joe 
Castro, president of Fresno State Uni-
versity, home of the Bulldogs. 
Yesterday, Dr. Castro was named the 
newest chancellor of California State 
University system after spending 8 
years at my alma mater at Fresno 
State with great success. He is the first 
native of California and the first per-
son of color to head the California Uni-
versity system, the largest in the en-
tire Nation. 
Raised in an immigrant household in 
Hanford, California, he is the first in 
his family, like so many, to graduate 
from college. His story is the story of 
the American immigrant. 
He serves as a mentor and an inspira-
tion to thousands of first-generation 
college students who have followed in 
his footsteps, folks like members of my 
family. His leadership led to many ac-
colades for Fresno State in recent 
years as the university continues to be 
one of the best colleges in the country. 
A passionate and fierce advocate for 
students, his selection to lead the larg-
est public university system in the 
country is a testament to his leader-
ship and the respect he has throughout 
the Nation as one of the leaders in 
higher education. He will leave behind 
a legacy that was best expressed when 
he first came to Fresno State and he 
told the student body: ‘‘Be bold.’’ ‘‘Be 
bold.’’ 
Congratulations, Joe and Mary, a 
real team, a Bulldog team, and always 
Bulldog proud.

BEUTLER. 
Mr. 
Speaker, I rise today to urge my col-
leagues to stand up for small busi-
nesses and workers across the country

petition in the House to temporarily 
seize control from the House Demo-
cratic leadership and revive the vital 
job-saving Paycheck Protection Pro-
gram. 
Every one of us has heard from res-
taurants and stores on the brink of clo-
sure. They are not crying wolf. Many 
will not make it through October with-
out more PPP funds. 
I know the majority leadership is 
feeling tremendous pressure. How? Be-
cause they canceled votes tomorrow 
morning. I guess allowing my more- 
seasoned Democratic colleagues to be 
on the floor while we file this petition 
jeopardizes leadership’s political pos-
ture. 
Well, enough posturing, and enough 
treating the fate of small business like 
a chess game. 
Mr. Speaker, I strongly urge my col-
leagues to sign my discharge petition 
in the morning and rescue small busi-
nesses. Be brave. Now is the time to 
act.

b 1745 
JUSTICE FOR BREONNA TAYLOR 
(Ms. LEE of California asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Ms. LEE of California. Mr. Speaker, 
yesterday a Kentucky grand jury in-
dicted one—just one—of the three offi-
cers involved in the tragic shooting of 
Breonna Taylor. 
Rather than being held accountable 
for this murder of an unarmed young 
Black woman, the indicted officer, in-
stead, received a slap on the fist while 
the others responsible remain free. 
Mr. Speaker, this shows, again, how 
our broken, racist criminal justice sys-
tem cares more about damaged prop-
erty than Black lives. If this court 
were concerned about endangering oth-
ers, how can they ignore the life that 
was taken in plain sight? 
401 years of white supremacy and op-
pression have rotted our criminal jus-
tice system. If there is any doubt that 
systemic racism exists, look to this de-
cision. 
The Senate must take up the George 
Floyd Justice in Policing Act, which 
would finally put an end to no-knock 
warrants. 
Breonna Taylor deserves better than 
this. Her family deserves better than 
this. We cannot give up until there is 
true justice. We deserve a justice sys-
tem that recognizes that Black lives 
matter. 
Say her name. 
f 
HONORING SWEET BRIAR COLLEGE 
(Mr. CLINE asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. CLINE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
to recognize Sweet Briar College for 
being named one of the most innova-
tive schools in the country by U.S. 
News & World Report. This is the sec-
ond time in 3 years that Sweet Briar 
has earned this distinction in recogni-
tion of its academic and institutional 
innovations. 
Located in Amherst County, Vir-
ginia, the college is committed to in-
stilling in its students the knowledge 
and skills necessary to address the 
challenges facing our communities. 
Sweet Briar utilizes its sprawling 
2,800-acre campus, including its lakes, 
vineyards, apiary, and 26,000-square- 
foot greenhouse, as a natural canvas 
and laboratory to offer students an ex-
perience unlike any other in the coun-
try. 
Further, not only is Sweet Briar 
home to one of our country’s oldest 
award-winning riding programs, but it 
is also one of two women’s colleges in 
the United States with an ABET-ac-
credited engineering program. Thus, it 
came as no surprise to hear that they 
were once again honored for their inno-
vation. 
President Meredith Woo and the 
school faculty have created a truly 
shining example of the incredible aca-
demic opportunities the Sixth District 
offers students from across the Nation. 
f 
REMEMBERING ROBERTO 
CLEMENTE 
(Mr. VAN DREW asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. VAN DREW. Mr. Speaker, I 
would 
like 
to 
recognize 
the 
out-
standing career, life, and accomplish-
ments of Roberto Clemente. 
Born in Carolina, Puerto Rico, Ro-
berto was a talented athlete from a 
young age and an Olympic hopeful in 
track and field. Roberto excelled in 
baseball from a young age and worked 
his way into the Hall of Fame. He had 
a wonderful professional career, includ-
ing 12 Gold Glove Awards, among his 
many other achievements. 
His 
off-the-field 
accomplishments 
were also something to be in awe of, 
spending much of his free time on char-
ity work or serving with the United 
States Marine Corps. 
His number, 21, was retired by the 
Pittsburgh Pirates after his untimely 
death. His accomplishments on the 
field and off the field deserve to have 
his number retired by Major League 
Baseball. 
Rest in peace, Mr. Clemente. May 
God bless you, and we all consider you 
our hero. 
f 
NOTICE OF INTENTION TO OFFER 
RESOLUTION RAISING A QUES-
TION OF THE PRIVILEGES OF 
THE HOUSE 
Mr. GOHMERT. Mr. Speaker, I seek 
to provide a privileged resolution here 
in the House. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman will give notice of his resolu-
tion. 
Mr. GOHMERT. H. Res. 1148, raising 
a question of the privileges of the 
House. 
Whereas, on July 22, 2020, H.R. 7573 
was brought to the House floor for a 
vote, with the purpose of eliminating 
four specific statues or busts from the 
United States Capitol along with all 
others that include individuals who 
‘‘served as an officer or voluntarily 
with the Confederate States of America 
or of the military forces or government 
of a State while the State was in rebel-
lion against the United States’’ yet 
failed to address the most ever-present 
historical stigma in the United States 
Capitol; that is the source that so fer-
vently supported, condoned and fought 
for slavery was left untouched, without 
whom, the evil of slavery could never 
have continued as it did, to such ex-
treme that it is necessary to address 
here in order for the U.S. House of Rep-
resentatives to avoid degradation of 
historical fact and blatant hypocrisy 
for generations to come. 
Whereas, The Democratic Party Plat-
form of 1840, 1844, 1848, 1852, and 1856 
states ‘‘That Congress has no power 
under the Constitution, to interfere 
with or control the domestic institu-
tions of the several States, and that 
such States are the sole and proper 
judges of everything appertaining to 
their own affairs, not prohibited by the 
Constitution; that all efforts of the 
abolitionists, or others, made to induce 
Congress to interfere with questions of 
slavery . . . are calculated to lead to 
the most alarming and dangerous con-
sequences; and that all such efforts 
have an inevitable tendency to dimin-
ish the happiness of the people and en-
danger the stability and permanency of 
the Union, and ought not to be coun-
tenanced by any friend of our political 
institutions.’’ 
Whereas, The Democratic Party Plat-
form of 1856 further declares that ‘‘new 
states’’ to the Union should be admit-
ted ‘‘with or without domestic slavery, 
as [the state] may elect.’’ 
Whereas, The Democratic Party Plat-
form of 1856 also resolves that ‘‘we rec-
ognize the right of the people of all of 
the Territories . . . to form a Constitu-
tion, with or without domestic slav-
ery.’’ 
Whereas, The Fugitive Slave Law of 
1850 penalized officials who did not ar-
rest an alleged runaway slave and 
made them liable for a fine of $1,000 
(about $28,000 in present-day value); 
Law-enforcement officials everywhere 
were required to arrest people sus-
pected of being a runaway slave on as 
little as a claimant’s sworn testimony 
of ownership; the Democratic Party 
Platform of 1860 directly, in seeking to 
uphold the Fugitive Slave Act, states 
that, ‘‘the enactments of the State 
Legislatures to defeat the faithful exe-
cution of the Fugitive Slave Law are 
hostile in character, subversive of the 
Constitution, 
and

passed in 1868 with 94 percent Repub-
lican support, 0 percent Democrat sup-
port in Congress; the 15th Amendment, 
giving freed slaves the right to vote, 
passed in 1870 with 100 percent Repub-
lican support and 0 percent Democrat 
support in Congress. 
Whereas, Democrats systematically 
suppressed African-Americans’ rights 
to vote, and by specific example in the 
1902 Constitution of the State of Vir-
ginia, actually disenfranchised about 90 
percent of the black men who still 
voted at the beginning of the twentieth 
century and nearly half of the white 
men, thereby suppressing Republican 
voters; the number of eligible African- 
American voters were thereby forcibly 
reduced from about 147,000 in 1901 to 
about 10,000 by 1905; that measure was 
supported almost exclusively by Vir-
ginia Democrats. 
Whereas, Virginia’s 1902 Constitution 
was engineered by Carter Glass, future 
Democratic Party U.S. Representative, 
Senator, and even Secretary of the 
Treasury under Democrat President 
Woodrow Wilson, who proclaimed the 
goal of the constitutional convention 
as follows: This Democrat exclaimed, 
‘‘Discrimination! Why, that is precisely 
what we propose. That, exactly, is what 
this Convention was elected for—to dis-
criminate to the very extremity of per-
missible action under the limits of the 
federal Constitution, with a view to the 
elimination of every Negro voter who 
can be gotten rid of legally.’’ 
Whereas, In 1912, Democratic Presi-
dent Woodrow Wilson’s administration 
began a racial segregation policy for 
U.S. government employees and, by 
1914, the Wilson administration’s Civil 
Service 
instituted 
the 
requirement 
that a photograph be submitted with 
each employment application. 
Whereas, The 1924 Democratic Na-
tional Convention convened in New 
York City at Madison Square Garden; 
the convention commonly known as 
the ‘‘Klan-Bake’’ due to the over-
whelming influence of the Ku Klux 
Klan in the Democratic Party. 
Whereas, Democrat President Frank-
lin Delano Roosevelt continued Wood-
row Wilson’s policy of segregating 
White House staff and maintained sepa-
rate dining rooms for white and black 
staffers. He also continued the White 
House 
Correspondents 
Association’s 
ban on credentialing black journalists 
for White House duties until outside 
pressure from black publications fi-
nally forced a change in policy in 1944, 
the last year of his presidency. Accord-
ing to the American Journal of Public 
Health, prior to his presidency, Roo-
sevelt not only banned blacks from re-
ceiving treatment at his polio facility 
in Warm Springs, Georgia, but black 
staff were forced to live in the base-
ment of the facility or in a segregated 
dormitory while white staff lived in the 
hotel or in surrounding cottages. 
Whereas, 
Democrat 
Congressman 
Howard Smith, former chairman of the 
House Rules Committee introduced the 
‘‘Declaration of Constitutional Prin-
ciples’’ in a speech on the House floor 
where he attacked the Supreme Court’s 
1954 decision on Brown v. Board of Edu-
cation of Topeka (KS) which deter-
mined that segregated public schools 
were unconstitutional. Smith’s dec-
laration urged people to utilize all 
‘‘lawful means’’ to avoid the ‘‘chaos 
and confusion’’ which would occur if 
they 
desegregated 
schools. 
His-
tory.House.Gov states that, ‘‘Under 
Smith, the Rules Committee became a 
graveyard for numerous civil rights 
initiatives in the 1950s.’’ 
Whereas, In 1964 the Democratic 
Party led a 75-calendar-day filibuster 
against the 1964 Civil Rights Act. 
Whereas, Leading the Democrats in 
their opposition to civil rights for Afri-
can-Americans was a fellow member of 
the Democratic Party, Senator Robert 
Byrd from West Virginia—a known re-
cruiter for the Ku Klux Klan. 
Whereas, Democrats enacted and en-
forced Jim Crow laws and civil codes 
that forced segregation and restricted 
freedoms of black Americans in the 
United States; and 
Whereas, On June 18, 2020, House 
Speaker NANCY PELOSI ordered the re-
moval from the Capitol portraits of 
four previous Speakers of the House 
who served in the Confederacy saying 
that the portraits, ‘‘set back our na-
tion’s work to confront and combat 
bigotry;’’ the men depicted in the por-
traits were Democrat Robert M.T. Hun-
ter, Democrat Howell Cobb, Democrat 
James L. Orr and Democrat Charles F. 
Crisp: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, 
That the Speaker of the House of 
Representatives shall remove any item 
that names, symbolizes or mentions 
any political organization or party 
that has ever held a public position 
that supported slavery or the Confed-
eracy, from any area within the House 
wing of the Capitol or any House office 
building, and shall donate any such 
item or symbol to the Library of Con-
gress. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under 
rule IX, a resolution offered from the 
floor by a Member other than the ma-
jority leader or the minority leader as 
a question of privileges of the House 
has immediate precedence only at a 
time designated by the Chair within 2 
legislative days after the resolution is 
properly noticed. 
Pending that designation, the form of 
the resolution noticed by the gen-
tleman from Texas will appear in the 
RECORD at this point. 
The Chair will not at this point de-
termine whether the resolution con-
stitutes a question of privilege. That 
determination will be made at the time 
designated for consideration of the res-
olution.

COLOR OF CRIME 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under 
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 3, 2019, the gentleman from Texas 
(Mr. GREEN) is recognized for 60 min-
utes as the designee of the majority 
leader. 
Mr. GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, 
and still I rise. And still I rise in the 
name of liberty and justice for all. And 
still I rise in the name of justice for 
Breonna Taylor. 
Mr. Speaker, there are many ques-
tions to be answered, critical questions 
to be answered. In this case there has 
been no indictment, nor arrest. There 
are unanswered questions. Who killed 
Breonna Taylor? Was the warrant prop-
erly executed? But there are some 
more questions that are quite critical. 
Is the system of justice in this Na-
tion broken, or is it doing what it was 
designed to do? Was Breonna Taylor’s 
death a tragedy, as has been announced 
and published far and wide? Or was her 
death a tragedy that was, in fact, a 
crime? 
And still I rise to address the issues 
associated 
with 
Breonna 
Taylor’s 
death. 
First, 
let 
me 
simply 
say 
this: 
Breonna Taylor was a young woman. 
She was loved by many, especially 
those who were very close, such as her 
mom, who thought she was easy to 
love. She was a person who finished 
high school and attended college. 
We have heard none of the things 
that one might hear in cases such as 
these, because it is usually imme-
diately published, the things about the 
person that are newsworthy with ref-
erence to their character. Her char-
acter has not been displayed in a nega-
tive way. 
So I rise today because Breonna Tay-
lor was a 26-year-old African-American 
woman. Breonna Taylor was an inno-
cent person in her home at the mid-
night hour. She was unarmed. She 
committed no crime. Breonna Taylor 
was doing what most people in this 
country do at the midnight hour. Yet, 
Breonna Taylor is no longer with us. 
And the question that I posed earlier 
and I pose now is this, Breonna Taylor 
was a Black woman, but the question 
is: If Breonna Taylor were a 26-year-old 
innocent, unarmed White woman who 
was killed in the middle of the night 
when Black police officers intruded 
into her home, would her death be a 
simple tragedy or would it be a crime 
to be prosecuted? 
To answer this question, I think we 
have to examine the color of crime. 
The color of crime dates back to the 
arrival of Africans in the Americas. At 
one time when Africans were first 
brought to this country, they were 
slaves, and as slaves the White masters 
had the right to hold them in bondage. 
But the slave committed a crime if the 
slave sought freedom. To seek freedom, 
to seek the liberty and the justice that 
we hold so near and dear, was a crime 
for the slave. The slave was Black. 
That crime was relegated to the Black 
slaves. Slavery was a crime that had 
color associated with it. 
Let us move forward. After slavery 
was abolished with the 13th Amend-
ment—the Emancipation Proclamation

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4953 
September 24, 2020 
was a great document, but it was the 
13th Amendment that freed the slaves. 
And after the 13th Amendment was 
passed, the slaves were left to priva-
tion. They were left without the neces-
sities of life. They were dependent on 
the very people that enslaved them. 
And as such, being dependent on the 
very people that enslaved them, they 
had few choices when it came to em-
ployment. 
But employing them was not enough 
for the slave masters, they used the 
color of crime to keep them in bond-
age. They employed the use of Black 
codes. They made it a crime to be a va-
grant. To have no job was a crime. The 
people who enslaved them were the 
people who denied them jobs, and the 
people who inculcated, passed laws, 
that made it possible for them to be ar-
rested for not having a job. 
This was a Black code. The color of 
crime was Black. The Black codes also 
saw something else come into being, 
something that Texas has had some 
dealings with as of late. Convict leas-
ing. A person who was caught and ac-
cused of a minor crime, they had some-
thing called Pig Laws. Steal a pig, 
some minor crime, they would be pun-
ished, found guilty and punished, and 
required to be leased to another person. 
Just another form of bondage. Just an-
other form of slavery. 
In Houston, we had 95 such persons 
found near a school in Sugar Land, 
Texas. The Sugar Land 95. They were 
persons who were slaves by another 
name. They were leased. There was a 
color associated with crime. 
And we move forward, if we may, to 
today. We find that we have this ques-
tion before us. If Breonna Taylor were 
a White woman, would she be alive 
today, or would the persons who per-
petrated this crime against her be pun-
ished? Would they have to be held ac-
countable? 
And I ask you, if, in your mind, you 
conclude that a White woman under 
the same circumstances, with three 
Black officers associated with her de-
mise, would there be more than a trag-
edy? Would it be a crime? And, if, in 
your mind you say, yes, then you un-
derstand now some of what the color of 
crime is all about, because we are look-
ing at two people, same facts, one with 
a darker hue than the other. And as a 
result, there are a good many people, 
and I am among them, who believe that 
her color had much to do with her de-
mise and the lack of accountability. 
Her color was something that does 
not receive the same level of respect 
that persons of a lighter hue receive. 
She had no gun. She didn’t fire on the 
officers. She was in her home. Yet, the 
officers fired and the bullets hit her 
multiple times. 
In this society, the lack of the same 
respect for people of color as is given 
people who are of a lighter hue is evi-
dent. It is evident in the financial serv-
ices industry. It is evident in banking. 
Persons who are of African ancestry, 
who are more qualified than persons 
who are what we refer to as White in 
this country, of European ancestry, 
they can apply for loans. Black people, 
more qualified, will get less in a loan, 
or have a higher interest rate. It has 
been documented. 
There is a color associated with lend-
ing in this country. And this color al-
lows people to steal the future of Black 
people. Their futures are dependent 
upon what we call bootstraps. Boot-
straps are loans. People buy homes 
with loans. People go into businesses 
with loans. Black people are being de-
nied loans to a greater extent than 
some White people who are less quali-
fied for the loans that they eventually 
get. So the color of crime is in the fi-
nancial services industry. 
But the color of crime is also in po-
licing. Not all police officers are bad. I 
absolutely deplore what happened to 
the police officers in Kentucky re-
cently who were shot. The people who 
committed these crimes, if there were 
multiple people, they should be ar-
rested, they should be prosecuted. And 
there is a good likelihood that they 
will be arrested and prosecuted. And 
there is a good likelihood that their ar-
rest will take place rather quickly, and 
the prosecution will proceed with de-
liberate speed. There is a good likeli-
hood that if you hurt a police officer, 
you are going to receive swift justice. 
But in policing, the color of one’s 
skin has consistently demonstrated 
that there is a different standard of be-
havior that emanates from some police 
officers, not all. But because some do 
it, and not all are involved in this, we 
cannot allow ourselves to say that all 
police officers are bad. I don’t agree 
with this. 
But I also think that we cannot be 
put in a position such that we can’t 
talk about the police officers who are 
bad, because somehow people will con-
clude you are talking about those who 
are good. I’m not. I want to talk about 
the officers who do dastardly deeds 
under the color of the law. And these 
officers understand, many of them that 
do these things, without having been 
told in the academy, without having to 
discuss it among themselves, they un-
derstand that Black people in this soci-
ety do not get the same level of respect 
as White people. 
And as a result of not getting the 
same level of respect, as a result of not 
having the same consequences ac-
corded people who hurt Black people as 
those who would hurt a White person, 
it is understood within the psyche that 
White officers, Black officers, regard-
less of their color, they can do things 
to Black people and escape the level of 
punishment that they would get if they 
performed these same insidious acts on 
White people. 
If officers were properly punished, 
George Floyd would still be alive. If of-
ficers were properly punished, I believe 
that Breonna Taylor would be alive. 
And if, by chance, she had lost her life, 
as she has, if they were properly pun-
ished, there would be something more 
to be accorded in this case other than 
a simple indication that it was a trag-
edy. 
It was a tragedy because she was 
Black. It was a tragedy because she 
was born of a different hue, a darker 
hue. If she had been born a White 
woman in this society, the rules would 
be different. Not the rules that had 
been codified, but the rules that have 
been inculcated into the psyche, into 
the minds of people who happen to 
wear a badge and carry a gun. 
b 1815 
Let’s just talk about whether the 
system is broken or whether it is func-
tioning as created. The system employs 
the grand jury. It is said that the pros-
ecutor can indict a ham sandwich. But 
what is not said is this: That same 
prosecutor can exonerate a ham sand-
wich. 
The prosecutor can present a case 
without 
any 
defense 
lawyer 
being 
present, present a case and decide 
which witnesses will be called, gen-
erally speaking. In so doing, the pros-
ecutor frames the case, and the pros-
ecutor leads the grand jury. 
When the prosecutor wants an indict-
ment and believes that an indictment 
should be had, an indictment is gen-
erally had in the case. The prosecutor 
has the ability to lead a grand jury. 
This system, while it has great bene-
fits, also has its flaws because the pros-
ecutors will tell you what happens 
within the grand jury room cannot be 
discussed. You can’t talk about it. It is 
secreted. That is a means by which the 
truth doesn’t always get out. 
So, the prosecutor can use the grand 
jury as a means of allowing a guilty 
person to go free by contending that 
the grand jury decided that the person 
should not be indicted. It is the pros-
ecutor who can indict the ham sand-
wich, and it is the prosecutor who can 
exonerate the ham sandwich. 
I believe that we have a challenge in 
this country, the challenge probably of 
our time for these seminal moments in 
time. The challenge has to do with 
whether we are going to do something 
about this color of crime and this sys-
temic racism that exists. 
Are we going to simply talk about it 
and decry it when each case arises, silo 
the case, and then move on to the 
next? Or are we going to commit our-
selves to eliminating invidious dis-
crimination in all of its forms as it re-
lates to anti-Semitism, as it relates to 
racism, as it relates to xenophobia and 
Islamophobia, 
as 
it 
relates 
to 
transphobia, all the invidious phobias? 
Are we going to commit ourselves? 
The way to commit ourselves, to 
have the public know we are com-
mitted, and to move us forward so that 
the color of one’s skin will not deter-
mine your worth when it comes to the 
behavior of some people in this society 
as they interact with you, if we are 
going to do this, then we have to have 
a reconciliation. 
We have not reconciled in this coun-
try. We have not reconciled. We have

not settled the differences that were 
created as a result of people being held 
in human bondage. We haven’t rec-
onciled. We haven’t made it such that 
those persons who were enslaved can 
now have equal opportunities within 
this society. 
Equal opportunity is something I 
strive for, but it doesn’t exist for peo-
ple of color. It doesn’t exist for some 
other people as well, not just people of 
color. 
One of the things that we learned at 
my committee was that LGBTQ per-
sons, if they go in for a loan, they, too, 
are discriminated against. Two gay 
people, a man who is married to an-
other man, they are discriminated 
against. 
Discrimination of this type has to be 
eliminated. The way to commit our-
selves to the elimination of all forms of 
invidious discrimination is with a de-
partment, a department of reconcili-
ation, a department with a secretary of 
reconciliation, a secretary of reconcili-
ation who reports directly to the Presi-
dent of the United States of America. 
We can do this. The question is, do we 
have the will to do it, a department of 
reconciliation with a budget, a budget 
that will allow persons to become a 
part of this department as under secre-
taries? 
This department can take up the 
issue of reparations. This department 
can take up the issue of a truth com-
mission so as to gather all the nec-
essary truths and facts about what has 
happened to African Americans in the 
United States of America. We need a 
department of reconciliation. 
This challenge is something that is 
applicable to you, regardless of your 
party. It doesn’t matter whether you 
are a Democrat or a Republican. What 
matters is, will we move forward with 
a department of reconciliation? 
It doesn’t matter which President we 
are talking about or which candidate 
we are talking about. Every candidate 
ought to be held responsible for an-
swering the question: Will you agree to 
a department of reconciliation? 
Every candidate, it doesn’t matter 
whether you are liberal or conserv-
ative, the question is: Will you agree to 
a department of reconciliation? 
I say to you, the candidate who says 
this is going to find that there are 
many people who are going to have 
favor bestowed upon this candidate 
such that the candidate will benefit 
greatly in November. 
But there must be reconciliation, and 
the best way is through a department 
of reconciliation. 
Now, to the family of Ms. Taylor, I 
have never met you, but I assure you 
that I will not let her death go unno-
ticed. This House of Representatives is 
going to have it called to their atten-
tion on multiple occasions. We cannot 
tolerate this kind of behavior. If we 
tolerate it, we perpetuate it. 
I plan to go to Kentucky. I want to 
see what happened in this place where 
she resided. I want to see the facility. 
This is important. We cannot allow her 
name to be a momentary announce-
ment and then go on to the next thing 
that causes a good deal of shame. We 
can’t do it. 
To these officers who were shot and 
their families, I want you to know that 
I stand against people who shoot police 
officers simply because of who they 
are, who commit crimes against police 
officers. Innocent peace officers, police 
officers, deserve the same level of re-
spect that other citizens who are inno-
cent deserve. 
Officers ought not be assaulted sim-
ply because they are members of a po-
lice force. I absolutely oppose it, and I 
absolutely support peaceful protest, 
not these protesters who believe that 
they have to destroy things. I believe 
you can be disruptive without being de-
structive. 
Peaceful protest is about being dis-
ruptive, yes. Sometimes, people go to 
jail. Dr. King went to jail for peaceful 
protest. John Lewis went to jail for 
peaceful protest. I have been to jail 
many times for peaceful protest, being 
disruptive without being destructive. 
I want the families of the officers to 
know that I stand with you. I want you 
to know that I want justice for those 
who have hurt these officers. 
Officers, I want you to know this, as 
well. My uncle was a deputy sheriff. I 
understand a lot about law enforce-
ment. I was a judge of a justice court. 
I am a lawyer. So, I appreciate law en-
forcement. 
What I don’t appreciate is what hap-
pened to Breonna Taylor. I don’t appre-
ciate a system that allows a prosecutor 
to lay the blame for lack of justice at 
the feet, at the hands, of a grand jury. 
The grand jury system has to be re-
evaluated. This notion that it is se-
creted and that we will never know 
what happened before the grand jury— 
there are ways to find out, I am sure. 
In fact, I know that there are, but in 
most cases, you can’t or you don’t. 
The system has to be reevaluated be-
cause the lack of transparency causes 
people to believe that this system is 
hiding something that is a part of cov-
ering up the wrongs that are being per-
petrated against Black people and oth-
ers, as well. 
We have to examine the system. That 
doesn’t mean that we have to eliminate 
the police departments. I don’t want to 
eliminate police departments. I would 
never agree to eliminating the police 
departments. I believe you have to 
have policing in your community, so I 
am for policing. But I am for people 
being treated with dignity and respect 
at all times, even when you are per-
forming the act of policing. 
Tonight, I believe that on March 13, 
2020, when Ms. Taylor lost her life, a 26- 
year-old Black woman, I believe that if 
she had been a 26-year-old White 
woman with the same circumstances, 
my belief is that she would probably 
not have lost her life. 
But let’s assume that she would have. 
Then, I believe that there would be ac-
countability because I believe there is 
color associated with crime and that 
people who enforce the laws don’t give 
the same level of attention to a Black 
person who is the victim of a crime as 
they do to White people. Not all the 
time, by the way. Not all the time. But 
in critical circumstances, it happens 
far too often, and we have to do some-
thing about it. 
I am committed to bringing about 
this level of change. I don’t know 
whether it will happen on my watch, 
but I do know this: On my watch, I will 
not be silent. On my watch, I will stand 
even if I have to stand alone because it 
is better to stand alone than not stand 
at all. 
We have some difficult days ahead. 
Dr. King reminded us of this. But we 
are seeing the difficulties manifest 
themselves before us on a daily basis— 
difficult days ahead. 
I spoke about the color of crime. 
Let’s talk about it just one more time 
as it relates to voting. It is intuitively 
obvious to even the most casual ob-
server that there are efforts to sup-
press the vote, and these efforts to sup-
press the vote have a greater impact on 
Black people than they do a good many 
others. 
Black people and brown people, mi-
norities, this effort to suppress their 
vote is evident, self-evident. I believe 
that we who hold public trust must do 
something to prevent what is about to 
happen, to the extent that we can. 
I don’t know that we can do what 
really should be done because of the 
tug of war between the parties, but I do 
know that we have to try. We have to 
make every person’s vote count in this 
country and give every person the op-
portunity to get registered to vote. 
There are people who are doing their 
very best to circumvent the registra-
tion and participation of minorities in 
this system of voting. This system of 
voting is something that we cherish 
and that we have to exercise. As my 
dear friend John Lewis put it, it is 
something that you must use, and, he 
intimated, if not, you may lose this 
precious right to vote. 
b 1830 
So we have to exercise this right, but 
let us be realistic and acknowledge 
that there are people who are doing 
their best to suppress the rights of mi-
norities when it comes to voting. 
Remember, this is a country that had 
to pass the 13th Amendment to free 
people who were held in bondage. This 
is a country that had to pass a con-
stitutional amendment to accord peo-
ple who were held in bondage this right 
of citizenship and then the right to 
vote. The 13th, 14th, and 15th Amend-
ments are important to people of color. 
So I say to everyone, there is color 
associated with criminality in the 
sense that people who are charged with 
enforcing the laws don’t provide equal 
protection under the laws to all of the 
people in this country. 
Mr. Speaker, I want to say to my 
friends who are charged with the re-

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4955 
September 24, 2020 
Houston, Texas, I want to say to them, 
in Houston, Texas, there was a case 
that is still pending. 
This is the case of Joshua Johnson. 
Joshua Johnson lost his life under 
questionable circumstances. The case 
is still being investigated, and the lack 
of transparency is something that con-
cerns me as it relates to Joshua John-
son. 
Joshua Johnson lived in the Ninth 
Congressional District. I happen to rep-
resent the Ninth Congressional Dis-
trict. 
Joshua Johnson: killed under ques-
tionable circumstances. 
We have the same system in place 
where there is a grand jury and a pros-
ecutor, that I have great respect for, 
but we still have this same system. But 
Texas has a solution that is different 
from any other State in the country. 
There is no other State that has the so-
lution that we have in Texas for these 
kinds of questionable killings. 
In Texas, we have the opportunity to 
take such a case and move it through a 
justice system that has a court in-
volved in it, as opposed to the grand 
jury, in the initial aspects of it, or it 
can be after the grand jury has given a 
ruling. 
In Texas, we have the opportunity to 
go to a district court judge and present 
probable cause, and if that judge con-
cludes that there is probable cause, 
that judge goes to an administrative 
judge, and the administrative judge 
can then appoint a judge to have a 
court of review to review what hap-
pened in this case. 
It is time for us to look at something 
similar to this on the national level for 
our Nation. 
I believe that a court of inquiry— 
which is what it is called in Texas. It 
reviews evidence. But a court of in-
quiry can make a difference on the na-
tional level, and, as a result, I plan to 
introduce legislation for us to have 
courts of inquiry at the national level 
so that we don’t have to depend on 
prosecutors and grand juries. 
A court of inquiry in Texas allows 
any citizen who knows that a crime 
has been committed to present this evi-
dence to a district court judge. 
I believe a similar circumstance— 
maybe not the same—ought to exist for 
people when it comes to Federal 
crimes. So I will introduce legislation 
calling for courts of inquiry across the 
length and breadth of this country so 
that we may have transparency in this 
process. 
I will not seek to eliminate the grand 
juries, but I will seek to give an alter-
native for citizens who are concerned 
about transparency when there are 
questionable circumstances, when you 
don’t have body cameras, when you 
have persons who are committing no 
crimes yet find themselves losing their 
lives at the hands of the constabulary. 
I hope to have this legislation ready 
for this Congress, but if not, it will 
definitely be introduced for the next 
Congress. We need courts of inquiry or 
something similar to what we have in 
Texas. 
I love my country. It means some-
thing to me to say that I am a part of 
this great country. I love it, and I do 
everything out of love for country and 
a belief that there should be liberty 
and justice for all, regardless of who 
you happen to be, regardless of your 
race, creed, color, or national origin. 
Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the time. I 
thank the leadership for giving me the 
opportunity to have this time on the 
floor. 
I promise that I am going to do as 
much as I can to eliminate invidious 
discrimination in all of its forms. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
f 
GOOD NEWS/BAD NEWS 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under 
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 3, 2019, the gentleman from Wis-
consin (Mr. GROTHMAN) is recognized 
for 60 minutes as the designee of the 
minority leader. 
Mr. GROTHMAN. Mr. Speaker, I will 
remove my mask here for the speech 
since we are all alone. 
Today I would like to address the 
Chamber with regard to something I 
consider good news, because there is 
not enough good news that we talk 
about here. We always talk about the 
problems. But then I am going to ad-
dress one potential problem brought to 
my attention by one of my constitu-
ents, and I am going to ask the Com-
mittee on Education and Labor to take 
up that problem. 
The first issue in which I received 
good news is with regard to immigra-
tion. Only 15 months ago, about 90,000 
people were let in this country, largely 
because they asked to come here on 
asylum and, pending an asylum hear-
ing, were let into the country. 
Obviously, it would be preferable for 
our country if every person who was al-
lowed in the country is appropriately 
vetted and we know will become a pro-
ductive citizen. When we allow people 
in the country for other reasons, we get 
people here who will not necessarily be 
an asset to America and will ulti-
mately, perhaps, ruin America. 
This has been done by three things. 
First of all, we have reached an 
agreement with Mexico, whereby the 
Mexican Government is holding people 
who in the past were allowed into the 
United States and told to show up for a 
court hearing at some future date, 
maybe years down the road. Obviously, 
when you let somebody in the United 
States and tell them to show up for a 
court date years down the road, you 
are not maintaining control of our bor-
ders. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank the Trump ad-
ministration and the Mexican Govern-
ment for agreeing to hold a consider-
able number of people south of the bor-
der. 
The second thing that was done was 
President Trump reached agreements 
with countries such as Guatemala, 
Honduras, and El Salvador to stop the 
spigot of more people coming into our 
country even south of Mexico. And, of 
course, these people came not only 
from other Central American coun-
tries, but South America and Africa as 
well. 
Four times I toured the border, and I 
found people were coming across not 
only from Mexico, but from Central 
America. And, actually, people were 
coming from Asia and Africa to Brazil, 
to Central America to work their way 
north. 
So I thank President Trump and I 
thank the Governments of Guatemala, 
Honduras, and El Salvador for not al-
lowing people through their country 
who are clearly planning on coming to 
the United States other than through 
the legal mechanisms that we have 
available. 
Finally, President Trump allowed 
our Border Patrol to turn people 
around to deal with the COVID epi-
demic. I know a lot of people wouldn’t 
have liked to do that, but President 
Trump put the United States first and 
now allows our Border Patrol to imme-
diately turn people around. 
The 
combination 
of 
these 
three 
things means we have gone from over 
90,000 people a month coming into this 
country who we really haven’t vetted 
and are now, among people who are 
touched by the Border Patrol, under 
2,000 people a month. As a matter of 
fact, I am told it is under 1,000 people 
a month, but that is almost too good to 
believe. 
But that is good news for the Amer-
ican people, particularly when you con-
sider all the people who come here are 
not appropriately vetted, wind up be-
coming a public charge perhaps, wind 
up involved in drug dealing perhaps. So 
that is your first good news of the 
night for America. 
The second good news: I know when 
President Trump ran for this office, he 
talked about reducing the number of 
troops abroad and keeping them out of 
harm’s way. 
However, this week, showing up on a 
subcommittee of Government Over-
sight and Reform, to my surprise— 
again, these are statistics I almost 
can’t believe, they are so good—in the 
last 7 months since a preliminary 
agreement was reached between the 
Taliban and the Afghan Government 
and the United States, there have been 
no military-connected casualties in Af-
ghanistan. We have gone 7 months 
without a combat casualty of our 
troops in Afghanistan despite the fact 
that we have 8,000 or 9,000 troops there. 
If you would have told me that was 
possible 4 or 5 months ago, I wouldn’t 
have believed it. No military casualties 
during a 7-month period. 
I was not aware of it until this week, 
and I, therefore, assume the vast num-
ber of Americans were not aware of it, 
but we should all be grateful that we 
have now gone 7 months in a row with-
out a military casualty in Afghanistan.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4956 
September 24, 2020 
The third thing I would like to ad-
dress tonight is dealing with possible 
medical advancements that can help us 
deal with the COVID pandemic. 
I sometimes feel, as I address the 
COVID pandemic, that our government 
agencies are focused solely on a vac-
cine and are not thinking outside the 
box. 
Today I talked to a couple of re-
searchers from Israel who continue to 
be optimistic on using fenofibrate, 
which is a drug which has traditionally 
been used to fight cholesterol. 
Well, they don’t like to be nailed 
down because nobody knows how many 
lives would be saved if we gave people, 
in the beginning stages of the pan-
demic, fenofibrate. It is possible that 
we could reduce the number of fatali-
ties by 30 or 40 percent. 
Again, fenofibrate is an easily avail-
able, in generic form, drug used to 
treat cholesterol. There are, right now, 
over time, better drugs. It is not as 
used as it once was. But, nevertheless, 
their preliminary studies are very posi-
tive. 
I wish our own CDC or NIH would get 
on the ball and help these researchers a 
little bit, because they feel they can 
have a definitive answer by winter. 
They feel that 3 months from now, we 
may have something that will be a cure 
for something like 30 to 40 percent— 
maybe 20 percent, maybe 30 percent—of 
the people who have this virus who now 
die. 
Can you imagine if we could reduce 
the number of fatalities by 30 percent 
by a simple expedient, not of devel-
oping an expensive vaccine, but if we 
could save all these lives with an easily 
available generic drug used for choles-
terol today? 
Mr. Speaker, I again ask CDC and 
NIH to think outside the box and help 
these researchers and find out if their 
preliminary work is accurate, and then 
we can save so many lives even if a 
vaccine is not developed. 
So there is the good news, kind of 
good news and bad news in that one. 
The good news is we are on the cusp of 
a cure; the bad news is we have got to 
get the American bureaucracy to think 
outside the box. 
The final thing I am going to address 
is some unfortunate news. 
The prior speaker talked about peo-
ple being treated differently, depending 
on who they are. 
It was brought to my attention 2 
weeks ago of something I normally run 
on, or I ran on originally, by a woman 
who had two children who went to col-
lege. 
b 1845 
She and her husband were hard-
working, middle-class Americans. And 
like most hardworking, middle-class 
Americans, when their children went 
to college, they had to take out loans 
and both of their children had loans in 
the $30,000 to $50,000 category. 
Because she did a good job of raising 
her children, they were hardworking, 
and working their way to paying off 
those loans, which is a good thing. 
But she has talked to other people 
and she found out other people, who 
perhaps weren’t married, weren’t work-
ing as hard, that their children re-
ceived grants from the government. 
So in other words, if you get married 
and work hard, we treat your children 
different than people who don’t get 
married. And, of course, there are won-
derful parents in all sorts of families. 
But just particularly, after we just 
got done with a speech pointing out 
that we should treat everybody the 
same, I would like to ask the Com-
mittee on Education and Labor to hold 
a hearing and find out if it is really 
true. 
Are we penalizing children of married 
couples because of their parents’ mar-
ital status? Are they stuck repaying 
$30,000, $40,000, $50,000 worth of student 
loans just because their parents are 
married, and they wouldn’t have had to 
take them out if their parents hadn’t 
been married? 
So I am going to ask my good friend, 
the chairman of the Committee on 
Education and Labor, to look into this. 
Recently, it has been in the paper 
that there are some powerful groups at 
work in the United States who are op-
posed to the nuclear family. So wheth-
er this is something that happened by 
accident, or whether it happened inten-
tionally 
because 
of 
longstanding 
groups that are opposed to the old- 
fashioned, nuclear family, I would like 
to know. 
And I think, given all of the hearings 
we have had around here on discrimi-
nation, it would be great if we could 
get to the bottom of this and find out 
whether my constituent is right and 
her children were both penalized $30,000 
to $50,000 each just because their par-
ents were married. 
So I ask my good buddy from Vir-
ginia to hold that hearing, and I appre-
ciate the time on the floor tonight. 
Mr. Speaker, I ask that we adjourn, 
and I yield back the balance of my 
time.

S5843 
Vol. 166 
WASHINGTON, THURSDAY, SEPTEMBER 24, 2020 
No. 166 
Senate 
The Senate met at 10 a.m. and was 
called to order by the President pro 
tempore (Mr. GRASSLEY). 
f 
PRAYER 
The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, of-
fered the following prayer: 
Let us pray. 
Almighty God, help us. Turn us back 
to the paths of integrity and faith. Be 
for our lawmakers a protecting rock of 
safety, rescuing them from the powers 
of evil. Help them to fix their hearts on 
You, trusting Your guidance and wis-
dom. May love for You be reflected in 
the ordering of their priorities as they 
seek to give You first place in every 
important decision. Lord, make them 
servants of Your purposes as they seek 
to increase the treasures of Your King-
dom. Satisfy the deepest longings of 
their hearts. 
And, Lord, in these toxic and ca-
cophonous times, bless America. 
We pray in Your loving Name. Amen. 
f 
PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE 
The President pro tempore led the 
Pledge of Allegiance, as follows: 
I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the 
United States of America, and to the Repub-
lic for which it stands, one nation under God, 
indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mrs. 
HYDE-SMITH). The Senator from Iowa. 
f 
NATIONAL SMALL BUSINESS 
WEEK 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, 
small businesses are a very important 
part of the U.S. economy, so we want 
to recognize this week, marking the 
57th anniversary of what we call Na-
tional Small Business Week—proper 
recognition for a big part of the econ-
omy. 
According to the most up-to-date 
government statistics, Iowa had 270,484 
small businesses and 651,635 employees. 
They account for 99–3/10th percent of 
businesses and 48–1/10th percent of the 
private workforce. Small businesses 
create jobs and export products around 
the world. Small businesses are the 
backbone of our communities, and I 
know this pandemic has really hit 
small businesses very, very hard. 
I honor these hard-working Iowa en-
trepreneurs and, of course, their em-
ployees in celebrating the week of Sep-
tember 20th as National Small Busi-
ness Week. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President, 
I ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
f 
RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY 
LEADER 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ma-
jority leader is recognized. 
f 
PROTESTS 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President, 
I have spoken repeatedly in recent 
months about the tragic killing of 
Breonna Taylor in my hometown of 
Louisville, the need for justice, and the 
healing work ahead for our commu-
nity. 
Kentucky’s attorney general, Daniel 
Cameron, conducted exactly the kind 
of thorough and impartial investiga-
tion that justice demands. Yesterday, 
that chapter concluded, and the grand 
jury conducted the handoff to criminal 
prosecution. I have full confidence in 
the attorney general’s painstaking pur-
suit of facts and justice. 
Many Kentuckians have channeled 
their continuing grief and anger in a 
peaceful exercise of their First Amend-
ment rights. But in Louisville last 
night, we saw more of the lawlessness, 
riots, and violence that have plagued 
American cities too often this year. 
Citizens’ businesses were vandalized, 
fires were set in the streets, and two 
officers of the Metro Police Depart-
ment were shot and wounded while pro-
tecting public safety downtown. As of 
last night, one officer was still under-
going surgery, but both were in stable 
condition. We are praying that both 
will make full recoveries. One suspect 
is in custody. 
Peaceful protests honor the memory 
of Breonna Taylor. Peaceful protests 
move us toward justice. Smashing win-
dows does not. Setting fires does not. 
Rioting in the streets does not. Trying 
to gun down law enforcement officers 
who were bravely serving their commu-
nity is the kind of despicable cowardice 
that must be met with the full force of 
the law. 
I sincerely thank all the Kentucky 
peace officers who continue to put 
their lives on the line every single day. 
I hope and expect that our Governor 
and mayor will take every necessary 
step to secure the justice, peace, law, 
and order that every Kentuckian de-
serves. 
f 
SUPREME COURT NOMINATIONS 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President, 
now on an entirely different matter, 
President Trump has stated he will an-
nounce his nominee to the Supreme 
Court the day after tomorrow. We do 
not yet know which legal all-star from 
his list he will nominate, but strangely 
enough, we already do know exactly 
what the far left will start shouting 
the instant—the instant—she or he is 
introduced. 
Isn’t that a little curious, when you 
stop to think about it? A confirmation 
process is ostensibly about the quali-
fications and credentials of the nomi-
nee, so why is it that practically any 
citizen could sit down at their kitchen

S5844 
September 24, 2020 
table right now, days—days—before the 
nomination, and write down in advance 
the list of ludicrous accusations the far 
left has guaranteed to be screaming by 
Saturday night? It is because year 
after year, decade after decade, the far 
left’s playbook stays exactly the same. 
To them, a nominee makes no dif-
ference. Every time in 45 years—45 
years—that a Republican President has 
nominated someone to the Supreme 
Court, the exact same set of cliched 
horror stories are wheeled out of stor-
age, dusted off, and paraded past the 
American people. 
In 1975, President Gerald Ford put 
forward a nominee whom the left blast-
ed for his ‘‘consistent opposition to 
women’s rights’’ and ‘‘an extraordinary 
lack of sensitivity to the problems 
women face.’’ Who was this far-right 
ideologue who was going to turn back 
the clock? Why, it was the late Justice 
John Paul Stevens, who went on to 
lead the Court’s liberal wing for dec-
ades. 
In 1987, it was time for an encore per-
formance. A nominee from President 
Reagan was absolutely savaged by lib-
eral groups. The president of one left-
wing group insisted he was a ‘‘sexist’’ 
and ‘‘a disaster for women’’—that 
would be Anthony Kennedy. 
Once again, the sky did not fall. In 
fact, when Justice Kennedy retired in 
2018, the new head of the exact same 
liberal organization stated they were 
‘‘saddened and alarmed by his retire-
ment.’’ The exact same liberal outfit 
said the sky was falling in the 1980s be-
cause Justice Kennedy had been nomi-
nated and that the sky was falling in 
2018 because he was retiring. 
In 1990, they got the band back to-
gether yet again. This time the sky 
was falling for sure. President Bush 
had picked someone whose record was 
‘‘very troubling,’’ whose juris prudence 
would surely ‘‘threaten to undo the ad-
vances made by women, minorities, 
dissenters, and other disadvantaged 
groups,’’ whose confirmation would 
mean ‘‘ending freedom for women in 
this country.’’ 
Talk about wearing out the volume 
knob. Oh, that was future Justice 
David Souter, by the way. One slogan 
simply 
said—listen 
to 
this: 
‘‘Stop 
Souter or Women Will Die.’’ ‘‘Stop 
Souter or Women Will Die.’’ He, too, 
would go on to become a favorite Jus-
tice of many of the very same groups. 
But it has still never occurred to 
them to get their crystal balls checked. 
The same unhinged attacks pour out 
every time, the same absurd scare tac-
tics every single time. 
These people are the far-left version 
of that broadcaster who spent 20 years 
predicting different dates for the end of 
the world, raising money, and just in-
venting a new date every time he was 
wrong. 
Justice Scalia was unfit. Justice 
Thomas hated the rule of law. Justice 
Alito was ‘‘hostile to the rights of 
women.’’ It is all one big scam directed 
at the American people. 
In 2005, one leftwing outfit cut a tele-
vision ad that tried to link our now- 
Chief Justice of the United States with 
a violent bombing of an abortion clin-
ic. Just how despicable can you get? 
Before this disgusting ad was pulled off 
the air, it said a future Justice John 
Roberts would ‘‘excuse violence against 
other Americans.’’ Chief Justice Rob-
erts. 
Every single time—no matter how 
upstanding, no matter how qualified, 
no matter their views, no matter their 
record—every nominee gets the same 
insane treatment, so long as the Presi-
dent who nominated them is not a 
Democrat—so long as the President 
who nominated them is not a Demo-
crat. 
Oh, but when Democrats nominate 
people, none of this happens. When we 
confirmed 
Justices 
Ginsburg 
and 
Breyer, I don’t recall any angry mobs 
stalking Senators. When we confirmed 
Justice 
Sotomayor, 
I 
don’t 
recall 
weeks of character assassination. When 
we confirmed Justice Kagan, I don’t re-
call the mainstream media declaring 
the death of democracy. 
For half a century we have seen this 
double standard. When a Democratic 
President makes a nomination, it is a 
nonevent by comparison. The coastal 
political class and their friends in the 
media allow our national life to go on 
like normal. But whenever a Repub-
lican dares to nominate someone, the 
same people declare it a state of emer-
gency. 
So, sadly, we already know what re-
action we will see on Saturday: fill-in- 
the-blank opposition. Remember, in 
2017, we saw literal fill-in-the-blank op-
position. Demonstrators wanted to as-
semble outside the Court before they 
even knew who President Trump would 
name, so they literally brought stacks 
of signs that said: ‘‘Oppose (blank)!’’ 
And they brought markers so they 
could scribble in the name during the 
President’s remarks before the TV 
cameras got to them. 
In 2018, moments after the President 
announced 
now-Justice 
Kavanaugh, 
one leftwing group published a typi-
cally 
absurd 
statement 
declaring 
‘‘Trump’s announcement today is a 
death sentence’’—‘‘a death sentence’’— 
and ‘‘white patriarchal supremacists 
now have free reign.’’ 
The actual nominee was so irrelevant 
to their scam that they literally forgot 
to fill in the blank. The very first line 
of their press release condemned ‘‘Don-
ald Trump’s nomination of XX to the 
Supreme Court.’’ 
So it is safe to say the American peo-
ple can start writing their bingo cards 
right now. We already know every out-
landish claim and unhinged attack we 
are going to hear. 
In fact, former Vice President Biden 
has already cut to the front of the line. 
Just yesterday, he offered the fol-
lowing assessment prior to learning 
whom he was assessing: ‘‘Women’s 
rights as it relates to everything from 
medical health care is going to be 
gone.’’ This is former Vice President 
Biden 
yesterday. 
Good 
luck 
deci-
phering what he is trying to say. It 
sounds like more of the same old junk. 
Perhaps the Nation will soon watch 
this man in his late seventies con-
descend to explain women’s healthcare 
to one of the brilliant women whom 
President Trump indicates he is consid-
ering. 
Fortunately, the far-left scam artists 
do not get a vote. The special interest 
groups’ fundraising appeals do not get 
a vote. The fate of this nomination will 
be determined by the U.S. Senators 
whom the American people elected to 
do this job: a fair hearing, a fair proc-
ess, and a fair vote on the actual nomi-
nee. Forget about fill-in-the-blank. 
f 
ORDER OF BUSINESS 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President, 
for the information of my colleagues, 
the vote on the confirmation of the 
Young nomination will occur at 11:30

The senior assistant legislative clerk

Mr. MCCONNELL. I suggest the ab-

Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, I

for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER 
The Democratic leader is recognized. 
ELECTION SECURITY 
Mr. SCHUMER. Our adversaries sow 
disinformation in our society and seek 
to influence our elections. Vladimir 
Putin will stop at nothing to diminish 
Western 
democracies. 
A 
resurgent 
China wants to take America’s place 
on the world stage. But the gravest 
threat to our democracy right now 
does not come from any foreign cap-
ital; it comes from our own. The 
gravest threat to democracy in Amer-
ica is President Donald Trump. 
Yesterday, at a news conference, 
President Trump refused to commit to 
the peaceful transfer of power should 
he lose the election in 41 days. Let me 
repeat that. Yesterday, at a news con-
ference, President Trump refused to 
commit to a peaceful transfer of power 
should he lose the election in 41 days. 
‘‘Well, we’re going to have to see what 
happens,’’ he said. ‘‘I’ve been com-
plaining very strongly about the bal-
lots, and the ballots are a disaster.’’

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S5845 
September 24, 2020 
Pressed further, the President said: 
‘‘Get rid of the ballots . . . there won’t 
be a transfer, frankly. There will be a 
continuation.’’ 
‘‘Get rid of the ballots . . . there 
won’t be a transfer, frankly. There will 
be a continuation.’’ 
Those are all his words: Get rid of 
voting; get rid of the ballots. Just let 
him stay in power whatever illicit way 
he chooses to do so. That is what he is 
saying. 
Now, everyone from school children 
to the most senior among us knows 
that the peaceful transfer of power is 
one of democracy’s core attributes. 
There is no democracy without it. Like 
the rule of law, the separation of pow-
ers, checks and balances, everything 
we have learned that is great and noble 
about 
our 
system 
in 
government, 
President Trump has sullied, dimin-
ished, and now he threatens to actually 
dismantle. 
The 
greatest 
threat 
to 
American democracy right now is Don-
ald Trump. 
The President issued similar threats 
in the runup to the 2016 election, and 
he is doing it again now. If I win, the 
election 
is 
legitimate, 
argues 
the 
President, but if I lose, it is rigged. 
That is what he is saying now—again: 
If I win, the election is legitimate, but 
if I lose, it is rigged. By the way, I may 
just stay in office and not count the 
ballots. 
Unbelievable. 
The gravest threat to American de-
mocracy right now is President Trump. 
Save for a few, the Republican major-
ity here in the Senate practically 
brushes by it: They don’t know the full 
context. Oh, the President says crazy 
things. Maybe he was joking. 
They are willing to continue ram-
ming through a Supreme Court Justice 
whom the President said is needed ‘‘be-
fore the election . . . because [the elec-
tion] will be before the United States 
Supreme Court.’’ 
Where are our Republican colleagues? 
This is not a partisan issue. Democracy 
is at stake. Every constituent from 
every corner of the land, regardless of 
party or ideology, should be asking the 
Republican Senators to speak out and 
demand that Donald Trump not be al-
lowed to do what he says he is going to 
do and say they will join all of America 
in standing in the way if he tries. 
The most innocent interpretation of 
the President’s comments is that he is 
just trying to get people not to vote: 
Mail-in voting is ‘‘rigged.’’ I am going 
to stay anyway, he cries. ‘‘Twelve more 
years,’’ they chant at his rallies—all to 
erode American faith in the election 
and discourage Americans from voting. 
It doesn’t matter how false, it doesn’t 
matter how undemocratic, it doesn’t 
matter how corrosive it is to our de-
mocracy, the President doesn’t care. It 
is his own ego and nothing else. The 
President says it if he thinks it will 
help him win. That is the most inno-
cent interpretation. 
If you take the President at his word, 
he wants to throw out ballots, refuse 
the peaceful transfer of power, and 
rush through a Supreme Court Justice 
to ensure that they could rule in his 
favor if the election is contested. That 
is him at his word. 
According to a new article in The At-
lantic magazine, some Republicans are 
actually considering a scheme to over-
ride the will of the voters in certain 
States. Under this nefarious scheme, if 
the President loses a State controlled 
by Republicans, they would ignore the 
result; they would ignore what the vot-
ers ask for and send a rival slate of 
electors to Washington instead, delib-
erately provoking a constitutional cri-
sis. 
Every American should read this ar-
ticle. 
Mr. President, I refer my colleagues 
to this link for the article: https:// 
www.theatlantic.com/magazine/ar-
chive/2020/11/what-if-trump-refuses-con-
cede/616424/. 
If you read these facts in a story 
about Belarus or Hungary, you might 
not bat an eye, but this is America. 
This is America. And here in America, 
our 
elections 
are 
sacrosanct. 
The 
peaceful transfer of power is our life-
blood. The rule of law is the very foun-
dation of our society. These currents 
run deep in our veins and are far 
stronger 
than 
the 
flimsy 
authoritarianism of President Trump. 
President Trump, you are not a dic-
tator, and America will not permit you 
to be one. We will not permit you to be 
one. 
This November, we will have an elec-
tion. The votes will be counted. It may 
take a little longer than usual because 
so many people will vote by mail be-
cause of COVID, but the votes will be 
counted. There are numerous lawsuits 
making sure it happens, and those law-
suits are succeeding. The results of the 
election must be accepted. The peace-
ful transfer of power must follow. Oth-
erwise, we will lose our democracy. 
At this perilous moment, every Re-
publican in this Chamber should stand 
up and say that a President who isn’t 
entirely sure if he will commit to a 
peaceful transfer of power isn’t a Presi-
dent at all. Stand up and say he is 
wrong and that you don’t want to live 
in a country where he is right. Pledge 
to uphold the pillars of our country. If 
Republicans stand up and say this is 
wrong, that may—may—be able to 
sway this President or his followers 
from repeating these attacks. 
And there is something every citizen 
can do, particularly those who are 
alarmed or discouraged by what Presi-
dent Trump said this week: Vote. The 
President cannot deny your right to 
vote. The answer to these naked 
threats to our democracy is more de-
mocracy: Vote. 
Don’t let Trump intimidate or dis-
courage you. Vote. Vote like our de-
mocracy is on the line because it is. 
Vote, vote, vote. 
SUPREME COURT NOMINATIONS 
Madam President, in 2016, Leader 
MCCONNELL
and Senate Republicans 
held a Supreme Court vacancy open for 
nearly a year on the supposed principle 
that ‘‘the American people should have 
a voice in [selecting] their next Su-
preme Court Justice.’’ 
Now, 41 days before a national elec-
tion in which we might have a new 
President, Leader MCCONNELL cannot 
even mention his supposed principle. In 
another speech on the floor today, he 
never mentioned it—never mentioned 
it. All the sophistry and diversionary 
arguments that are getting more and 
more like Trump don’t undo the fact he 
totally reversed himself, and the Amer-
ican people know it, and the over-
whelming majority of Americans want 
us to wait until a new President is 
elected before we choose a Supreme 
Court Justice. 
Yesterday, the Presiding Officer con-
firmed that the Senate has never— 
never—confirmed 
a 
Supreme 
Court 
nominee this close to the election. 
Again, all the history, all the obfusca-
tion, all the relevant facts don’t deny 
it. Yesterday, the Presiding Officer of 
the Senate—a neutral figure who hap-
pened to be a Republican—confirmed 
that the Senate has never confirmed a 
Supreme Court nominee this close to 
the election. We hear a lot of talking 
points from the other side, some twist-
ed readings of precedent. But facing a 
simple question—Has there been a Sen-
ate precedent confirming a Justice this 
close to an election between July and 
election day?—the Presiding Officer 
confirmed that ‘‘no such precedent ex-
ists.’’ 
Leader MCCONNELL and the Repub-
lican majority are not following their 
supposed principle, and they are not 
following precedent. This is nothing 
more than an exercise in brute force. 
It may very well destroy the already 
waning 
sense 
of 
comity 
and 
collegiality in the Senate, once hall-
marks of this great Chamber. It may 
have done an end to it, unfortunately 
and sadly. And for what? Why do we go 
to such great lengths to ram through a 
Justice mere weeks before an election, 
making a complete mockery of their 
previous position? Because this is the 
only way for Republicans to achieve 
their radical rightwing agenda, which 
the public will abhor. Unable to get 
their legislative agenda passed through 
Congress, they have to rely on the 
courts to erode, bit by bit, the rights 
the American people now enjoy. 
Republicans would say: That is not 
true. They are hysterical. They are 
just speculating, trying to scare voters. 
But this is what the President has 
said. He wants to nominate a Justice 
who will ‘‘terminate’’ the Affordable 
Care Act. His administration is suing 
in court, right now, to invalidate the 
law—a case that will be heard 1 week 
after the election, a case that could rip 
away healthcare from tens of millions 
of Americans in the middle of a pan-
demic, and Leader MCCONNELL
says 
this is ‘‘hysterical.’’ Go tell a mother 
or father whose son or daughter has

cancer and they can’t get insurance be-
cause they no longer have the protec-
tion that it is hysterical. Shame. 
This is real stuff, and this is not 
speculation. There is a suit before the 
Supreme Court right now on this issue. 
Speculation? Was it not President 
Trump who said that women should be 
punished for having an abortion? Was 
it not the Republican majority who 
confirmed the majority of judges to the 
Federal bench with disturbing views on 
a woman’s right to choose? Was it not 
the Republican leader who has admit-
ted that he hopes to ‘‘pick away’’ at 
women’s rights through the courts? 
What about workers’ rights? What 
about voting rights? The Supreme 
Court, even with Justice Ginsburg, 
slowly eroded workers’ rights in the 
Janus case and voter rights in the 
Shelby County case, opening the door 
for a flood of voter suppression efforts. 
Imagine—just 
imagine, 
America— 
what another rightwing Justice, a solid 
6-to-3 majority would mean for a Court 
that has already eroded your rights? 
This is not speculation. Oh, no. This 
is about every right and freedom that 
Americans hold dear. It is no wonder 
that President Trump and Senate Re-
publicans are afraid to test this in an 
election and are so eager to rush this 
nomination through. 
BREONNA TAYLOR 
Madam President, yesterday, a grand 
jury in Kentucky declined to charge 
three 
officers 
in 
the 
shooting 
of 
Breonna Taylor. One was indicted on 
minor 
charges 
of 
wanton 
endangerment. The other two will face 
no charges at all. 
Today, I and millions and millions of 
Americans grieve for the family of 
Breonna Taylor, knowing that justice 
will not be served in the murder of 
their daughter. The fact that an Afri-
can-American woman can have her life 
taken while she sleeps in her own bed 
and those responsible are not held ac-
countable is a harrowing reminder that 
something is very, very broken in our 
system. It is another reminder that we 
are in desperate need of comprehensive 
policing reform. 
A few months ago, in the aftermath 
of George Floyd’s death, Senate Demo-
crats introduced the Justice in Polic-
ing Act. It would ban no-knock war-
rants in Federal drug cases. It was the 
no-knock 
warrants that hurt—that 
killed—Breonna Taylor. It would ban 
choke holds, and it would make it easi-
er for Americans to hold police depart-
ments accountable when they violate 
their civil and constitutional rights. 
The House passed this important bill in 
June. 
Here in the Senate, Leader MCCON-
NELL, typically, refused to take it up at 
all. But we will not stop fighting until 
we finally bring that lasting change 
that our Nation needs, change that pro-
testers, civil rights organizations, and 
the families of George Floyd, Ahmaud 
Arbery, and Breonna Taylor are still, 
tragically, waiting for. 
I yield the floor.

ator from Indiana. 
f 
EXPRESSING SUPPORT FOR THE 
PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE 
Mr. BRAUN. Madam President, in 
2002, 
18 
years 
ago, 
Senator 
Tom 
Daschle raised a similar resolution—a 
resolution on the importance of the 
Pledge of Allegiance. With unanimous 
support in the U.S. Senate, it passed on 
the floor uneventfully and without 
amendment. This body can choose to 
do the same today—to reaffirm our 
support for the Pledge of Allegiance. 
I also rise to honor a Hoosier who un-
derstood the innate value of the Pledge 
of Allegiance to civic education. 
In 1969, Red Skelton, an American co-
median and entertainer who was well 
known for his program on CBS, ‘‘The 
Red Skelton Hour,’’ wrote a speech on 
the importance of the pledge. In re-
flecting on his time in Vincennes, IN, 
he wanted to talk about how important 
the value instilled by it is still applica-
ble today. After the performance of his 
speech, CBS received 200,000 requests 
for copies. His speech would go on to be 
sold as a single by Columbia Records 
and performed at the White House. I 
think it would be an honor to repeat 
this, and I will do so after yielding the 
floor to my colleague, Senator SCOTT 
from Florida. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mrs. 
FISCHER). The Senator from Florida. 
Mr. SCOTT of Florida. First of all, I 
thank my colleague, my friend from In-
diana, for his absolute commitment of 
trying to make an impact on what is 
going on in Washington. We both came 
up here at the same time, and I have 
enjoyed working with him every day. 
I had the opportunity to pursue the 
American dream. I got involved in poli-
tics because I saw that dream slipping 
away for far too many. All Americans 
should have their shots at living their 
versions of the American dream. 
For me, I grew up poor. I never met 
my biological father. My adopted fa-
ther was a busdriver, with only a sixth 
grade education, who did all four com-
bat jumps with the 82nd Airborne in 
World War II. We lived in public hous-
ing. Even though my mom had no 
money, she was optimistic and hopeful. 
She told us we were blessed because 
God and our Founders created the 
greatest country ever, where anything 
was possible. 
Unfortunately, the left has worked 
hard over the last 50 years to discredit 
the values of the America I was raised 
with and the values of the America I 
want my grandchildren to grow up 
with. Central to those values is faith 
and family. The Pledge of Allegiance 
explicitly acknowledges that our Cre-
ator is central to this American experi-
ment. Unfortunately, the left is trying 
to undo the foundational principles of 
this country. 
The left railed against our soldiers 
during the Vietnam war and is calling 
to defund our law enforcement. The 
left discredits those who believe in a 
supreme being or the commitment of 
marriage, and it doesn’t place value in 
family. The left doesn’t care about our 
enormous debt and pushes for social-
ism. The left thinks it is OK that our 
schools don’t teach about the Founding 
Fathers or free markets and wants you 
to think America was never great. 
We all acknowledge that Americans, 
our country, and our institutions have 
flaws, but the left has worked to dis-
credit our Founders, our institutions, 
our churches, our law enforcement, our 
morals, and almost everything my 
mom taught me. Yet we join today to 
honor the Pledge of Allegiance, the 
very spirit of our Nation—‘‘one Nation 
under God, indivisible, with liberty and 
justice for all.’’ That is the America I, 
along with my colleagues here, are 
fighting for. 
The values that I grew up with—the 
ones my ‘‘tough love’’ mom taught 
me—are becoming a way of the past, 
but I believe these values, these vir-
tues, can and should be part of our 
country’s future. 
I love it when my grandchildren pray 
before eating, recite the Pledge of Alle-
giance, ask to visit military museums, 
thank police officers and soldiers for 
their service, and place their hands 
over their hearts when they hear the 
national anthem. I hope they memorize 
the Declaration of Independence and 
the 23rd Psalm. 
We will not give up on the American 
dream and a nation where anything is 
possible. We will not let the radical left 
take away our freedom and oppor-
tunity. 
Again, I thank Senator BRAUN for 
leading this effort today. Freedom is 
fleeting and worth fighting for, and we 
will not stop fighting for the country I 
was raised in because that is the coun-
try our children and our grandchildren 
deserve. 
I yield to Senator BRAUN. 
Mr. BRAUN. Madam President, I 
thank Senator SCOTT. The emphasis on 
faith, family, community, freedom, lib-
erty, and equal opportunity is what 
makes this country great. We can 
never forget it, for it is embedded in 
the Pledge of Allegiance. 
I return now to reading the point of 
view from Red Skelton. This is in 
terms of his recollection when he was a 
kid back in Vincennes, IN. 
He begins: 
I heard, I think, one of the most out-
standing speeches I have ever heard in my 
life. I think it compares with the ‘‘Sermon 
on the Mount,’’ Lincoln’s ‘‘Gettysburg Ad-
dress,’’ and Socrates’ speech to the students. 
We had just finished reciting the Pledge of 
Allegiance, and he [Mr. Laswell, the prin-
cipal of Vincennes High School] called us all 
together, and he says, ‘‘Uh, boys and girls, I 
have been listening to you recite the Pledge 
of Allegiance all semester, and it seems that 
it has become monotonous to you. Or, could 
it be, you do not understand the meaning of 
each word? If I may, I would like to recite 
the pledge, and give you a definition for each 
word.’’ 
I saw this many years ago myself, 
and when I looked at the video again, I

thought it would behoove everyone to 
listen to his own words back when he 
did it on CBS. 
I—Me; an individual, a committee of one. 
Pledge—Dedicate all of my worldly goods 
to give without self-pity. 
Allegiance—My love and my devotion. 
To the Flag—Our standard. ‘‘Old Glory’’; a 
symbol of courage. And wherever she waves, 
there is respect, because your loyalty has 
given her a dignity that shouts ‘‘Freedom is 
everybody’s job.’’ 
of the United—That means we have all 
come together. 
States—Individual communities that have 
united into 48 great states; 48 individual 
communities with pride and dignity and pur-
pose; all divided by imaginary boundaries, 
yet united to a common cause, and that’s 
love of country— 
Of America. 
And to the Republic—A Republic: A sov-
ereign state in which power is invested into 
the representatives chosen by the people to 
govern; and the government is the people, 
and it’s from the people to the leaders, not 
from the leaders to the people. 
For which it stands. 
One Nation—Meaning ‘‘so blessed by God.’’ 
[Under God] 
Indivisible—Incapable of being divided. 
With liberty—Which is freedom; the right 
of power for one to live his [or her] own life 
without fears, threats, or any sort of retalia-
tion. 
And Justice—The principle and qualities of 
dealing fairly with others. 
For All—That means, boys and girls, it’s as 
much your country as it is mine. 
Afterward, Mr. Laswell asked his stu-
dents to recite the Pledge of Allegiance 
together, with a newfound appreciation 
and reinvigoration for the words: ‘‘I 
pledge allegiance to the flag of the 
United States of America, and to the 
Republic for which it stands, one na-
tion, indivisible, with liberty and jus-
tice for all.’’ 
Mr. Skelton concluded his speech by 
saying: 
Since I was a small boy, two States have 
been added to our country, and two words 
have been added to the Pledge of Allegiance: 
‘‘Under God.’’ Wouldn’t it be a pity if some-
one said, ‘‘That is a prayer’’—and that be 
eliminated from our schools, too? 
Just as those students that day, Mr. 
Red Skelton included, recommitted to 
the meaning of the words of the Pledge 
of Allegiance, I call upon the U.S. Sen-
ate to recommit to the meaning of 
these words. 
There are times today that the words 
of the pledge are tossed around without 
too much care. Other times, they are 
altered 
to 
remove 
what 
today 
is 
deemed offensive or antiquated, but 
Americans should not misuse or abuse 
the Pledge of Allegiance. The Pledge is 
meant to remind Americans of our 
guiding principles and inspire adher-
ence to those ideas which make our 
country great: equality under the law 
and recognized rights to life, liberty, 
and the pursuit of happiness. 
Madam President, as if in legislative 
session, I ask unanimous consent that 
the Senate proceed to the consider-
ation of S. Res. 715, submitted earlier 
today. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will report the resolution by 
title. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
read as follows: 
A resolution (S. Res. 715) expressing sup-
port for the Pledge of Allegiance. 
There being no objection, the Senate 
proceeded to consider the resolution. 
Mr. BRAUN. I ask unanimous con-
sent that the resolution be agreed to, 
the preamble be agreed to, and the mo-
tions to reconsider be considered made 
and laid upon the table with no inter-
vening action or debate. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
Without objection, it is so ordered. 
The resolution (S. Res. 715) was 
agreed to. 
The preamble was agreed to. 
(The resolution, with its preamble, is 
printed in today’s RECORD under ‘‘Sub-
mitted Resolutions.’’) 
Mr. BRAUN. I yield the floor.

EXECUTIVE CALENDAR—Continued 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Texas. 
Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, I 
just want to say how much I appreciate 
the resolution of the Senator from In-
diana. It reminds me of discussions I 
know all of us have had about the 
teaching of American history and 
civics in our schools and, frankly, a 
collective concern that our children 
are being raised and educated without 
learning both about our founding prin-
ciples and how unique we are as a na-
tion. I think, as modest a step as this 
may seem, it is an important one, and 
I congratulate our friend from Indiana 
for taking it. 
SUPREME COURT NOMINATIONS 
Madam President, in a letter to our 
Democratic 
colleagues 
earlier 
this 
week, my friend, the chairman of the 
Committee on the Judiciary, pointed 
out the vastly different treatment of 
Supreme Court nominees by the respec-
tive political parties. 
He wrote: ‘‘Compare the treatment of 
Robert Bork, Clarence Thomas, Samuel 
Alito, and Brett Kavanaugh to that of 
Ruth 
Bader 
Ginsburg, 
Sonia 
Sotomayor, and Elena Kagan, and it’s 
clear that there already is one set of 
rules for a Republican president and 
another set of rules for a Democrat 
president.’’ 
This double standard is not just fic-
tion or our imagination at play. Two 
years ago, we saw the outrageous 
smear campaign that our Democratic 
colleagues waged against Justice Brett 
Kavanaugh and his family. I have 
noted that it is not just enough to de-
feat a nomination; they actually were 
out to destroy his reputation. 
While I hope it is something no nomi-
nee will have to endure again, I worry 
that history will repeat itself. The 
President has yet to even announce his 
nominee for the Supreme Court for the 
vacancy created by the death of Jus-
tice Ginsburg, but our Democratic col-
leagues are already reflexively taking 
potshots at potential nominees. 
One of those potential nominees is 
Judge Amy Coney Barrett, who is a 
well-respected Federal judge with an 
impressive background as a legal schol-
ar. While serving on the Seventh Cir-
cuit, Judge Barrett has shown that she 
will faithfully and impartially apply 
the law to cases and controversies be-
fore her, but in the eyes of our col-
leagues on the other side of the aisle, 
her stellar resume has one glaring 
flaw—her strong Catholic faith. 
During Judge Barrett’s confirmation 
hearing for her current position on the 
circuit court, the ranking member of 
the Committee on the Judiciary asked 
Judge Barrett if she could separate her 
religious beliefs from her legal duties, 
saying: ‘‘The dogma lives loudly within 
you, and that’s a concern.’’ 
During my time in the Senate, I 
don’t recall any similar application of 
a religious test to a nominee or such 
intrusive questions about how their 
faith might impact their abilities to 
carry out the duty of a Justice. But, 
apparently, some on the other side of 
the aisle believe that a Christian 
woman is unable to separate her reli-
gious beliefs from her role on the 
bench. Yet, again, there is a different 
standard for nominees of a Republican 
President. But the Constitution pro-
vides that ‘‘no religious Test shall ever 
be required as a Qualification to any 
Office or public Trust under the United 
States.’’ In other words, it is unconsti-
tutional to impose a religious test on a 
nominee or on any person who holds 
public office. 
Unfortunately, our Democratic col-
leagues’ efforts to destroy conservative 
nominees are getting more and more 
outrageous—false 
accusations, 
reli-
gious tests, and threats to upend insti-
tutions, like packing the Court. It is 
terrifying to imagine what might come 
next. 
In 2016, the American people elected 
President Trump knowing the type of 
nominees he would send us because he 
advertised and released a list of poten-
tial nominees to the Supreme Court 
were he elected. 
At the same time, the American peo-
ple also reelected a Senate majority 
committed to supporting the Presi-
dent’s nominees to the Federal bench. 
On both counts, we delivered, first, 
with 
the 
confirmation 
of 
Justice 
Gorsuch and, then, with the confirma-
tion of Justice Kavanaugh. 
We are once again prepared to deliver 
on our promise to the American people 
and to consider another highly quali-
fied jurist to the Supreme Court. We 
will not rush this process. My col-
leagues and I on the Judiciary Com-
mittee will do our job and thoroughly 
examine the nominee, just as we would 
any other nominee to the Court. 
Then, every single Member of the 
Senate will have the chance to debate 
and vote for or against that nominee 
right here on the Senate floor. This 
confirmation will be as thorough as it 
always has been, but my hope is that 
this time it will also be civil, and that

today. 
HISPANIC HERITAGE MONTH 
Madam President, on another mat-
ter, I have the great honor of rep-
resenting nearly 29 million Texans, 
roughly 40 percent of whom are His-
panic. I consider myself fortunate to 
have experienced the tremendous influ-
ence of the Hispanic community on our 
country and on our culture. Much of 
that culture, of course, dates back to a 
time long before the Lone Star flag or 
the American flag flew over Texas. 
The first sovereign flag planted on 
Texas soil was Spanish, and that 
sprawling Spanish colony extended all 
the way to modern-day Chile. When 
Mexico won independence from Spain 
in 1821, it won all of Texas as well, and 
when Texas fought for its independ-
ence, soldiers of Mexican and European 
descent stood together on the Texas 
side in support of an independent re-
public. 
It is unfair to say that Hispanic cul-
ture has influenced Texas because, in 
reality, Hispanic culture is as much a 
part of our State’s foundation as the 
ground that our cities are built on. 
Today, Texas is home to more than 
11.5 million Hispanic Americans, some 
who have lived there for generations 
and others who have contributed to the 
recent rapid growth of the population 
of the Lone Star State. Since 2010, the 
Hispanic population has grown by more 
than 2 million people in my State, and 
the positive impact of Latinos across 
our State continues to grow. 
Every year, during this month in par-
ticular, I am proud to join millions of 
my fellow Texans in celebrating the 
heritage that is uniquely woven into 
the fabric of our State and our Nation. 
During 
Hispanic 
Heritage 
Month, 
which officially commenced last week, 
we honor and celebrate Hispanic and 
Latino Americans and the traditions 
and 
contributions 
these 
men 
and 
women and those who came before 
them have made to our country. 
For the past 12 years, I have joined 
our colleague Senator MENENDEZ from 
New Jersey and a number of other bi-
partisan cosponsors in introducing a 
resolution to formally recognize Sep-
tember 15 through October 15 as His-
panic Heritage Month. It is a time we 
take to honor Latinos who, for genera-
tions, have served in our military, held 
elected office, grown small businesses, 
and fought in big and small ways to 
make our country better. 
Today, Texas is proud to have incred-
ible Hispanic-American leaders who are 
shaping our States’ and our Nation’s 
futures and inspiring the next genera-
tion. At the highest levels of public 
service in my State, we have incredible 
leaders like Ruth Hughs, our secretary 
of State, and Justice Eva Guzman, the 
first Hispanic woman to serve on the 
Texas Supreme Court. 
Our communities are learning from 
inspiring women like Sister Norma 
Pimentel, who is executive director of 
Catholic Charities of the Rio Grande 
Valley and led the creation of the res-
pite center in McAllen to help care for 
migrants coming across our border. 
They are seeing the incredible work 
of organizations like Buckner Inter-
national, led by Dr. Albert Reyes, 
which has set up hope centers around 
the world that help families become 
self-sufficient. 
Entrepreneurs are looking to busi-
ness leaders like my friend Ramiro 
Cavazos, who is president and CEO of 
the U.S. Hispanic Chamber of Com-
merce. For more than 40 years, the 
U.S. Hispanic Chamber has been an in-
credible resource for Hispanic business 
owners across the State, and their ad-
vocacy has been invaluable, particu-
larly during the COVID–19 crisis. Ear-
lier this summer, I was able to vir-
tually connect with U.S. Hispanic 
Chamber members across Texas to dis-
cuss the relief provided by Congress in 
four major pieces of legislation, as well 
as to learn more about the challenges 
that they were facing and what more 
we might be able to do. 
I have also been able to speak with 
Hispanic healthcare leaders, who are 
instrumental in Texas’s fight against 
this virus. 
Over the summer, we saw a dramatic 
increase in positive cases and fatalities 
in the Rio Grande Valley, which is pre-
dominantly Hispanic. Last month I vis-
ited the valley for conversations with 
local officials and healthcare leaders 
about 
the 
impact 
of 
the 
Federal 
CARES Act funding that we passed in 
four separate pieces of legislation, as 
well as the hurdles they continue to 
have and are fighting to overcome. 
During our discussion, I heard from 
Hispanic leaders in the healthcare in-
dustry, like Manny Vela, who is the 
CEO of Valley Baptist Health System, 
and Cris Rivera, who is CEO of the Rio 
Grande Regional Hospital. 
Strong leadership at the local level 
has never been more important, and I 
am grateful for those who are con-
tinuing 
to 
help 
our 
communities 
through this crisis. 
For nearly a century, our State has 
also benefited from the work of the 
League of United Latin American Citi-
zens, otherwise known as LULAC, 
which is led by Domingo Garcia, and 
for years has benefited from the leader-
ship of Laredo native Roger Rocha. 
LULAC fights to improve opportunities 
for Hispanic Americans, particularly 
when it comes to education, and it is 
an avid supporter of Hispanic-serving 
institutions. 
Last week the Senate passed a reso-
lution Senator MENENDEZ and I intro-
duced to honor these institutions, 
which are helping Hispanic students 
achieve their dreams through a quality 
education. Despite the fact that these 
colleges and universities only rep-
resent 17 percent of nonprofits colleges 
and universities, they enroll two-thirds 
of all Latino students, totaling more 
than 2.5 million students nationwide. 
Texas is home to 100 Hispanic-serving 
institutions, more or less, and these 
colleagues and universities are helping 
to prepare the next generation of lead-
ers for our future. This month is the 
perfect opportunity to celebrate their 
incredible work and acknowledge the 
important role these institutions play 
in my State and in our country, and I 
am glad this resolution passed with 
unanimous support. 
I hope we can also pass legislation I 
introduced to honor the contributions 
of Hispanic Americans for generations 
to come. 
When Americans of all ages visit 
Washington, they are able to learn the 
stories of great Americans through the 
Smithsonian 
museums, 
which 
wel-
comed more than 22 million visitors 
last year. These museums house price-
less pieces of American history, from 
the Star-Spangled Banner, which in-
spired the national anthem, to the hat 
that President Lincoln wore on the 
night he was assassinated. 
Unfortunately, these museums don’t 
represent the diversity of the American 
story, but that is slowly changing. In 
recent decades, the Smithsonian Insti-
tution family has grown to include the 
National Museum of the American In-
dian and the National Museum of Afri-
can American History and Culture. 
But it is time for another addition. 
More than a decade ago, in 2008, Presi-
dent Bush signed into law the National 
Museum of the American Latino Com-
mission Act to study how to establish a 
new museum. The results of that study 
found that the Latino representation 
within the Smithsonian Institution is 
far from what it should be and chal-
lenged us to provide their story and to 
make sure it is represented there. 
I am thinking of the U.S. Latino 
community as a whole, which numbers 
some 60 million people, but I am also 
thinking 
of 
individual 
men 
and 
women—people like Juan Seguin, who, 
in some ways, was a predecessor of 
mine. He came from Mexican descent 
and helped lead the Texas Revolution. 
Then he was a Texas senator before 
Texas even joined the Union. So in 
many ways, he was one of the fore-
fathers of my State, and his contribu-
tions, like so many others, are an im-
portant part of our multifaceted Amer-
ican story. 
We need to ensure that every Amer-
ican has the opportunity to learn about 
people like Juan Seguin and the count-
less other Latinos who have played piv-
otal roles in our history. Last year, 
Senator MENENDEZ and I reintroduced 
a bill with a bipartisan group of Sen-
ators 
which 
would 
authorize 
the 
Smithsonian Institution to create a 
museum honoring American Latinos 
here in Washington. This has been a 
work in progress since 2003, and this 
legislation will finally put that into 
motion. 
The bill passed the House unani-
mously this summer, and between the 
House and Senate, we have more than 
340 bipartisan cosponsors. 
The time has come to turn the dream 
of this museum into reality. There is

no better time than Hispanic Heritage 
Month for that to happen. 
Texas and our entire Nation are 
stronger, smarter, and more inclusive 
because of the contributions of His-
panics over the generations. 
I am glad to spend this month re-
flecting on our complex and ever-evolv-
ing American story, and celebrating 
the contributions of Hispanic Ameri-
cans who have helped shape our Na-
tion’s history. 
I hope the Senate will honor Hispanic 
Heritage Month by passing this impor-
tant legislation to finally give Latino 
history a brick-and-mortar home here 
in Washington, DC. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Oregon. 
Mr. MERKLEY. Madam President, I 
ask unanimous consent to complete my 
remarks prior to the vote. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
TRIBUTE TO AMY AMRHEIN 
Mr. MERKLEY. Madam President, 
Senators come to this floor with great-
ly diverse life experiences and political 
theories and representing enormously 
different States. But we all share this 
in common: a vast appreciation of our 
team members, our staff, who enable us 
to do our work as U.S. Senators on be-
half of our own States, but also on be-
half of the Nation. 
These team members are not just 
staff. They are family. We share in mo-
ments of joy—marriage, the birth of a 
child. We grieve with them in those life 
moments that are so difficult. And 
when the team members choose to 
move on, it is a bittersweet moment. 
I come to the floor today to recognize 
and pay tribute to a beloved member of 
my team, Amy Amrhein, who in just a 
few short days will be leaving us to a 
well-deserved retirement. Even after 
knowing for months that this day was 
coming, it is still hard for me not to be 
saddened by her departure. She has 
been on my team from the very begin-
ning of my time as a Senator, serving 
as my field representative in Southern 
Oregon and staffing our Medford office. 
That is now a dozen years. 
She took on the task of learning 
complicated natural resource issues 
and learning them with determination 
and insight, working to internalize the 
issues and challenges of every commu-
nity in the region, from the smallest 
port to the biggest county. 
She mastered the art of putting on a 
townhall, as I do one in every county 
every year, and I think at last count 
that is about 80 townhalls she has con-
ducted over the years. 
She has worked to bring the commu-
nity together to discuss visions for the 
future. One of those was the potential 
expansion 
of 
the 
Cascade-Siskiyou 
Monument. She organized a gathering 
that gave public testimony, which 
helped share insights from all the 
stakeholders. Local leaders and re-
gional Tribes and all members of the 
public shared their insights and per-
spectives. 
It is no exaggeration to say that 
there are few people in the world with 
a better grasp of the complicated water 
issues in the Klamath Basin. We have a 
saying in the West that ‘‘whiskey, 
that’s for drinking; water, that’s for 
fighting’’ because it is so essential to 
so many aspects of our economy and 
our natural system. 
For 12 years, Amy engaged in shuttle 
diplomacy over long-term solutions to 
water shortages. She found ways to 
help farmers and ranchers save their 
livelihoods 
through 
shattering 
droughts, truly making herself an in-
dispensable facilitator to stakeholders 
across the board and an indispensable 
facilitator as I tried to work out agree-
ments. That really came in handy with 
the Klamath Basin Restoration Agree-
ment, developing that effort to have 
the stakeholders share a common vi-
sion for the future. It really came in 
handy when we worked to get funds to 
address the devastating droughts in 
2010 and 2013—funds that would help 
the farmers who depended on irrigation 
but had no water to be able to tempo-
rarily, for a season, retire their water 
rights and therefore have some income 
for their ranch or their farm or be able 
to have money to pump groundwater to 
compensate for the lack of irrigation 
water during those drought years. 
One of the issues has been the water 
quality in the Klamath Basin and the 
competing environmental rules regard-
ing the river and the lake, and a piece 
of that is the survival of two endan-
gered species. So she helped to put all 
the details together to hold the Sucker 
Science Summit, which brought to-
gether again the farmers, ranchers, 
Tribes, scientists, local government of-
ficials, and Federal officials to devise a 
plan for the long-term survival of the 
C’waam and Koptu suckerfish in the 
Klamath Basin. 
There is no doubt that Southern Or-
egon could not have asked for a better 
advocate over these past 12 years. I 
have appreciated her diligence, her 
humor, her positive attitude, and her 
candor about our smart political tac-
tics or policy tactics and our mistakes. 
I could share some of those stories, but 
perhaps they are better shared through 
the eyes of our fellow team members, 
so I will read some of their comments. 
The first goes as follows: 
Amy is the definition of dedication. No one 
can out work her. She is committed and she 
will keep asking questions and pushing but-
tons until she makes progress on an issue. 
She is fearless. She has been such a great 
leader and mentor for not only the field 
team, but the entire state staff. I’m so grate-
ful for the opportunity to learn from her. Or-
egon is a better place to live because of her 
service and she will be dearly missed. 
A second team member expressed 
this: 
When I think of Amy I think about her 
fearlessness. A distant field rep’s job is real-
ly challenging—[the rep] is the face and the 
voice of the Senator and you are all alone, 
far from DC, even far from Portland. Despite 
all our communications breakthroughs you 
are still all by yourself, driving remote high-
ways, walking into rooms full of strangers, 
never knowing what is going to be thrown at 
you. They want a Senator, and instead they 
get you. Amy was open about her questions 
and concerns, but once she was out there and 
on her own, we always had confidence she 
would do and say the right thing. 
A third team member said this: 
No surprise that she is leaving behind big 
shoes. She makes covering some of the larg-
est counties and most difficult issues in the 
state look easy. Her knowledge of the issues 
run deep and her contacts in counties is im-
pressive. When you ask about a county, 
she’ll give you the breakdown of all her con-
tacts: who would give me straight answers 
and who has the juicy county political/social 
gossip. She has also been a great mentor to 
those in the field. I am pretty sure she has 
walked every one of us through our first 
town halls, roundtables and site visits. She 
was someone you could rely on to give you 
feedback and let you know if you were on the 
right path. 
The final comment from a team 
member: 
I would just say that every time I have 
ever come into contact with a community 
leader or elected official that has worked 
with Amy, no matter the political party, 
they absolutely love her. She has done so 
much for the Southern Oregon communities. 
Just a beautiful human who has worked in-
credibly hard over the last decade-plus to 
help rural Oregonians. She is funny, kind, 
and blunt—always tells you like it is. I can-
not reiterate enough how imperative her 
mentorship has been. She is a wealth of 
knowledge and experience that can’t be re-
placed. 
I certainly could not have said it bet-
ter, so I appreciate the team members 
who contributed those thoughts. 
On behalf of myself and the entire 
team, thank you, Amy Amrhein, for all 
you have done for our team, for all you 
have done for the State, and for all you 
have done for so many constituents, 
working on so many complex and dif-
ficult issues. You are going to be deep-
ly missed by the entire team but by me 
most of all. It is the wish of the entire 
team that you will have a joyous, 
healthy retirement.

The legislative clerk read as follows: 
Motion to proceed to Calendar No. 552, 
H.R. 8337, a bill making continuing appro-
priations for fiscal year 2021, and for other 
purposes. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Maine. 
CORONAVIRUS 
Ms. 
COLLINS. 
Madam 
President, 
with the COVID–19 pandemic con-
tinuing to devastate our public health 
and our economy, it is far past time 
that we reach agreement on another 
relief package that is so desperately 
needed. It will require good-faith nego-
tiations on both sides of the aisle, not 
just saying no and turning the tragedy 
of 200,000 COVID deaths into a partisan 
political issue. 
For my part, I believe there should 
be nine elements in the bill. First, 
there should be an extension of the 
Paycheck Protection Program, known 
as PPP. This is a program that I craft-
ed with Senators MARCO RUBIO, JEANNE 
SHAHEEN, and BEN CARDIN to provide 
forgivable loans to our small busi-
nesses so that they could pay their em-
ployees. 
I am pleased to report that, in my 
State, 28,000 small businesses—that is 
nearly three out of four of our small 
businesses—have taken advantage of 
$2.3 billion in forgivable loans, sus-
taining 250,000 jobs. It has truly made a 
difference. Now we need to do a second 
round of PPP for the hardest hit busi-
nesses, those for whom the first PPP 
loan was the lifeline but they need ad-
ditional help. 
So we have set a revenue test such 
that, if your revenue is 35 percent 
below what it was in an equivalent 
quarter last year, you would qualify for 
another PPP loan. In addition, those 
who have never received a first PPP 
loan could apply under the initial 
rules. This would make a difference in 
keeping our small businesses afloat, 
particularly those in the tourism in-
dustry that have been so hard hit, and 
ensuring that their employees will still 
have jobs. 
Second, we need to provide aid to our 
schools. I have talked to superintend-
ents all over the State of Maine, and I 
have visited schools in Hollis and 
Houlton. I have seen firsthand the 
enormous investments they have had 
to make in order to reopen the schools 
safely or adapt to a hybrid model, de-
pending on where the location is and 
the incidence of COVID–19. 
In one school that I visited, they 
have replaced all of the round tables 
around which the elementary school-
children would usually be working with 
desks lined up. It reminds me of when 
I went to elementary school because 
that was the style of teaching back 
then. 
They are sanitizing and deep-clean-
ing the schools. They are trying to fig-
ure out what to do with the little toys 
that are used to teach children how to 
count: How do they sanitize them? Or 
do they get each child his or her own 
set of toys to place in individual bins? 
They are cutting new doors into the 
nurse’s office so that no longer will ill 
children or staffers have to go through 
the front office. They are putting up 
plexiglass shields. They are adding ad-
ditional bus routes in order to safely 
separate the children. 
These changes cost a lot of money, 
and it is one reason why, in addition to 
providing direct aid to our schools, we 
need to provide assistance to our 
States, our counties, and our commu-
nities. 
I have talked to city and town man-
agers all over the State of Maine. They 
did not receive much from the initial 
allocation of funding that went to 
State governments, and they need help 
now. 
Let me give you an example. The city 
of Auburn has had to freeze six vacant 
positions because of expected revenue 
losses. That is two firefighters, a police 
officer, and three public works employ-
ees. These cuts come as the city of Au-
burn has spent $200,000 in new expenses 
responding to the virus. 
I have yet to talk to a city or a town 
manager who is not experiencing the 
need due to similar cuts and who expe-
rienced delayed or canceled public 
works projects, like paving local roads. 
That has a trickle-down effect. It af-
fects the contractor and his or her em-
ployees, who will no longer have that 
work. It affects their suppliers from 
whom the concrete or the tar is no 
longer going to be purchased. 
This is why I feel strongly that the 
bipartisan SMART Act, which I worked 
on with colleagues on both sides of the 
aisle, led by Senator CASSIDY and Sen-
ator MENENDEZ, needs to be passed. We 
can negotiate exactly how much money 
and exactly to whom it should go, but 
it is essential that aid go to the com-
munity level. 
Fourth, we need to help our airlines. 
Otherwise, come October 1—just right 
around the corner—we are going to see 
massive layoffs. We are talking about 
between 80,000 and 100,000 layoffs of air-
line employees and also related jobs in 
airports, such as concessionaires. It 
will also lead to canceled service, if 
there are no longer crews for airplanes 
and ground crews. We are going to lose 
airline service to communities all over 
this country. 
We need not to forget the motor 
coach industry, which few people are 
talking about. They have been hurt by 
the cancelation of everything from 
school sports to tours. We need to help 
them survive this period of economic 
struggle. Senator JACK REED and I have 
introduced a bill with more than 40 co-
sponsors on both sides of the aisle that 
would provide that assistance. 
No. 6, we need to continue investing 
in testing. That is key to reopening our 
economy and safely housing people in 
nursing homes and other long-term 
care facilities. 
I am excited by the new Abbott Labs 
test, which will cost only $5 and give a 
result in 15 minutes. I take particular 
pride because Abbott Labs has a large 
facility in my State, and they are ex-
panding 
from 
Scarborough 
to 
Westbrook in order to produce these 
tests more rapidly. 
No. 7, we need to provide limited but 
important liability protections to our 
frontline hospital workers, 
to 
our 
small businesses, and to our schools 
and colleges. 
One restaurant owner put it this way 
to me. He said: Susan, what if I get 
sued despite taking every precaution, 
following the CDC guidelines, but a 
customer comes in, later develops the 
coronavirus, and sues me, saying, I 
think I got it in that restaurant. Well, 
I am pretty sure that he didn’t, but I 
still have to pay to defend that law-
suit? 
Clearly we should not protect anyone 
who is guilty of gross negligence, but

September 24, 2020 
that is not what we are talking about 
here. 
No. 8, we need to provide a reason-
able Federal unemployment insurance 
supplement to help struggling families 
during this difficult time when so 
many people have lost jobs through no 
fault of their own, but we need to make 
sure that we are not creating a dis-
incentive to return to work when jobs 
reopen. That is why I like the approach 
of either having an 80-percent replace-
ment of the pre-job-loss wage or fig-
uring out a formula that would ap-
proach 80 percent. That is far higher 
than the normal wage replacement 
under our State systems, but these are 
extraordinary times. 
No. 9, we need an emergency appro-
priation for the U.S. Postal Service. 
Otherwise, I am worried that the Post-
al Service will not be able to meet its 
payroll starting the second quarter of 
next year. Think of the costs the Post-
al Service has incurred. It has had to 
retrofit every post office, every proc-
essing center in this country, as well as 
provide protective gear to its postal 
employees who are both essential and 
frontline workers. 
Those are the elements that I believe 
should be in the next coronavirus pack-
age. While there are disagreements on 
perhaps three of the nine elements that 
I have suggested, by and large, there is 
agreement on seven of the elements. 
There may be disputes about exactly 
how much money should be appro-
priated, but we can work those dis-
putes out, just as we do in the appro-
priations process. 
We simply cannot wait and do noth-
ing and just hope for the best. Hope is 
not an effective strategy when it comes 
to dealing with this persistent pan-
demic. The American people have dem-
onstrated resilience, courage, and com-
passion during this crisis, but they 
need our additional help. 
I hope that next week we will put 
aside the partisan bickering, the ‘‘just 
say no’’ approach that we have seen, 
unfortunately, from the Democratic 
leader, and that we will come together 
for the good of the American people; 
that we will come together not as 
Democrats and Republicans and Inde-
pendents but as Americans to do what 
our country needs done right now. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
SCOTT of Florida). The clerk will call 
the roll. 
The assistant senior legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mrs. GILLIBRAND. Mr. President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
REMEMBERING JUSTICE RUTH BADER GINSBURG 
Mrs. GILLIBRAND. Mr. President, I 
rise today to remember a daughter of 
New York and an American giant. Jus-
tice Ruth Bader Ginsburg was an icon, 
a legend, and a role model for so many 
people, myself included. We may never 
see a jurist with her kind of courage 
again in our lifetimes. 
The daughter of an immigrant furrier 
and Garment District bookkeeper, born 
and raised in Brooklyn, she pushed 
back against every expectation and 
limitation that society had for her and 
rose to the bench of the highest Court 
in the land. She was a brilliant legal 
mind, an unparalleled jurist, an opera 
fan, fearless dissenter, and the ‘‘Noto-
rious RBG.’’ 
Justice Ginsburg spent her whole life 
fighting against injustices, those she 
faced personally and those she could 
not abide in society. 
When Ruth Bader Ginsburg went to 
law school, she was one of just 9 women 
in her class of 500. She graduated at the 
top of her class but was rejected by law 
firm after law firm because she was a 
woman and because she was a mother. 
Undaunted, she found a different path 
to success. 
She educated generations of law stu-
dents at Rutgers and Columbia and 
spent her time outside the classroom 
at the ACLU, becoming an architect of 
the plan to eradicate gender discrimi-
nation. One strategically chosen case 
at a time, she proved to a male-domi-
nated legal system that discrimination 
on the basis of sex is real. She was a 
trailblazer. She took herself to places 
that few women had ever been, and she 
took the law to places it had never 
been. 
She stood for all of us. She stood 
against discrimination in all its forms. 
She was someone who fundamentally 
understood the gifts that people have 
to give to this country regardless of 
one’s sex, one’s gender orientation, 
one’s race, or one’s background. 
She knew that the words etched in 
stone above the entrance of the Su-
preme Court—‘‘Equal Justice Under 
Law’’—were still a goal, not a given, 
and she fought to make them a reality 
every day of her life. 
As has been noted, in the Jewish tra-
dition, only those of great righteous-
ness die on Rosh Hashanah—because 
God determined that they were needed 
until the end. Justice Ginsburg was 
truly someone of great righteousness, 
and at the very end, she left us with 
one final message: ‘‘My most fervent 
wish is that I not be replaced until a 
new president is installed.’’ 
She asked us to respect the right of 
the American people to be heard, but 
within just hours of her passing, that 
wish was denied by Members of this 
body. 
The hypocrisy of my colleagues is 
breathtaking. The same Members rush-
ing this process are the very same ones 
who denied Merrick Garland hearings 
because his nomination was supposedly 
too close to an election. He was nomi-
nated in March. It is nearly October. 
This election is not just close. It is al-
ready happening. People across the 
country are already casting their bal-
lots. Yet this is about more than rank 
hypocrisy. Let’s look at what is really 
at stake. 
The first case that will be argued in 
November will decide if 129 million 
Americans with preexisting conditions 
will continue to have access to afford-
able healthcare. Think about that. My 
Republican 
colleagues 
are 
rushing 
through the confirmation of a judge in 
order to nearly guarantee that 129 mil-
lion Americans with preexisting condi-
tions will see their premiums go up or 
have their healthcare ripped away en-
tirely. That would be inhumane at any 
time, but in the middle of a pandemic, 
it is truly unthinkable. 
They are rushing to vote on a Justice 
who will decide the fate of more than 
640,000 
DACA 
recipients 
who 
have 
known no other home, no other coun-
try, but this one. 
They seek to confirm a judge who 
will revoke the rights of 50 percent of 
the population to make decisions about 
their own bodies and their reproductive 
healthcare. 
This new judge could very well over-
turn recently decided cases that have 
finally granted same-sex couples the 
fundamental right to marry the per-
sons whom they love. 
This new judge will likely decide on 
the Nation’s ability to conduct a fair 
and accurate census and the right of 
every person in this country to have 
equal representation under the law. 
It is clear to me why our colleagues 
are rushing this. They fear that the 
American people simply don’t agree 
with their views. They fear that this is 
their last chance to impose an ultra-
conservative view on our country, in 
which women’s rights, LGBTQ rights, 
and immigrants’ rights take a back 
seat to corporate interests and dis-
crimination. That is not what the 
American people want. They should get 
the chance to have their say. Their 
ability to access healthcare, to marry, 
to live in this country, and to be rep-
resented fairly and fully by this gov-
ernment is on the line. Their rights 
hang in the balance. 
The actions of my colleagues deny 
the people a voice. What does that say 
about this Chamber? What does it say 
about our democracy? 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

the Senate proceed to its immediate 
consideration. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will report the bill by title. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
read as follows: 
A bill (H.R. 4779) to extend the Under-
taking Spam, Spyware, And Fraud Enforce-
ment With Enforcers beyond Borders Act of 
2006, and for other purposes. 
There being no objection, the com-
mittee was discharged, and the Senate 
proceeded to consider the bill. 
Mr. BLUMENTHAL. I ask unanimous 
consent that the bill be considered read 
a third time. 
The bill was ordered to a third read-
ing and was read the third time. 
Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, 
this bill, H.R. 4779, ‘‘To extend the Un-
dertaking Spam, Spyware, And Fraud 
Enforcement With Enforcers beyond 
Borders Act of 2006,’’ would reauthorize 
the U.S. SAFE WEB Act, which is an 
important tool for the Federal Trade 
Commission to investigate and take 
action against the scams, robocalls, 
and fraud that may span international 
borders. It would save consumers the 
hardship 
and 
heartbreak, 
financial 
pain, and emotional travail of fraud, 
scams, and robocalls that may have 
international 
implications 
and 
im-
pacts. 
The SAFE WEB Act has been reau-
thorized on a bipartisan basis over 
many years. I am pleased to cooperate 
and collaborate with Senator MORAN of 
Kansas, who is a great partner in con-
sumer protection and this effort and is 
the chairman of the subcommittee on 
which I am the ranking member. 
We all know that fraud spawned by 
foreign criminal organizations, as well 
as domestic ones, has caused signifi-
cant harm to consumers here. There-
fore, this measure will provide the 
tools that are essential to the FTC in 
protecting consumers and in enforcing 
the law. 
I know of no further debate on the 
bill. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
further debate? 
If not, the bill having been read the 
third time, the question is, Shall the 
bill pass? 
The bill (H.R. 4779) was passed. 
Mr. BLUMENTHAL. I ask unanimous 
consent that the motion to reconsider 
be considered made and laid upon the 
table. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, I 
yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to 
call the roll. 
Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
GOVERNMENT FUNDING 
Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, in a few 
moments we are going to vote on the 
motion to proceed to H.R. 8337, the 
Continuing Appropriations Act of 2021 
and Other Extensions Act of 2020. 
I will speak a little bit about what is 
in there, but I will urge all Members to 
vote aye. 
The bill provides funding for the gov-
ernment through December 11 at fiscal 
year 2020 funding levels. It will be 
under the same terms and conditions 
contained in the fiscal year 2020 appro-
priations laws. These were the laws 
that Chairman SHELBY and I brought 
to the floor and have been voted on. 
It 
includes 
several 
authorization 
matters to extend programs that other-
wise would expire, including some im-
portant health and veteran programs. 
So as vice chairman of the Appro-
priations Committee, I support the bill, 
but I am disappointed that it is needed 
at all. 
As I have said many times, we had 
ample—ample time in the Senate to 
complete our work on the 12 appropria-
tions bills, but we didn’t mark up a sin-
gle one. In June, July, we could have 
passed all 12 of them, but the majority 
leader wouldn’t even bring up a single 
one of them. 
Apparently, he is more interested in 
confirming extreme rightwing judges 
than moving legislation to address the 
needs of the American people, includ-
ing appropriations bills or critical leg-
islation to combat the COVID virus 
and its impact on families and the 
economy. 
I chuckle, too, in a way ruefully be-
cause, of course, my friends on the 
other side—especially if there is a 
Democratic administration—say they 
must follow the Thurman rule, named 
after their revered former President 
pro tempore from the Republican side, 
that you cannot have any confirma-
tions after the first of July. But, of 
course, they have forgotten their own 
Republican rule when they have a Re-
publican President. We all know the 
facts on that, but I think what the 
American people have to understand is 
that because of the time we spent on 
that, because of the refusal to even 
allow 1—even 1—of the 12 appropria-
tions bills to come up for a vote and 
allow everybody to either vote for it or 
against it—and with Republicans hav-
ing a majority, if they didn’t like any-
thing in it, they could vote it down. 
But saying that, no, we want to talk 
about it, but we are kind of afraid to 
actually have to vote on it—I don’t 
know why we are afraid to vote. That 
is what we get elected to do. 
I have cast over 16,000 votes in this 
body. Actually, I was told today that is 
more than all but 1 of the nearly 2,000 
Senators who have served here. 
But what we have done is we have 
conceded we can’t do our most basic 
job of completing appropriations bills 
on time, and in doing that, we have 
failed to address an unprecedented 
health and economic crisis for months. 
Last week more than 870,000 Ameri-
cans filed for unemployment benefits 
for the first time. It is not 870,000 
Americans who have filed in the past; 
this is 870,000 Americans filing for un-
employment benefits for the first time. 
That is because of this pandemic. 
Kitchen cabinets across the country 
are bare as families struggle without 
enough to eat. Schools do not have 
enough resources to teach our children 
at home or protect them inside the 
classroom. 
This is infuriating. I think Senator 
SHELBY and I could have gotten those 
12 bills. On some parts of them, some 
would vote for it; some would vote 
against it. But we were ready to vote 
back in June and July. In the mean-
time, we now have 200,000 Americans 
who have died, and we have yet to vote. 
I am afraid that what the President 
wants to do—and my friends on the Re-
publican side—is cast aside the des-
perate needs of the American people in 
favor of government on autopilot. 
Apparently, right now, they are more 
concerned 
with 
securing 
a 
hyperpartisan Supreme Court than the 
health and safety of the American peo-
ple and are doing the most basic job of 
Congress. It is that simple. 
I will have more to say about the 
continuing resolution in the coming 
days as we move forward toward final 
passage. But the last thing our country 
needs is a government shutdown in the 
middle of a global pandemic and an un-
precedented economic crisis. 
I regret that leadership would not 
allow us to vote on these appropria-
tions bills because I am convinced we 
would have had enough Republicans 
and Democrats who would have come 
together and passed all 12 of them if we 
had been allowed to vote, even though 
it means that some would have to cast 
difficult votes, but that is what we are 
here for. 
For this one, while it is far from per-
fect, I will urge all Members to vote 
aye on the motion to proceed. 
Mr. President, I see my distinguished 
colleague on the floor is ready to 
speak, so I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Missouri. 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST—S. 3983 
Mr. HAWLEY. Mr. President, we are 
40 days today from a general election— 
40 days—40 days until the American 
people make their choice, or at least 
that is the idea. 
But there are a group of people who 
seem intent on influencing the people’s 
choice, on manipulating it, on shaping 
it according to their own preferences. I 
am not talking about China or Russia 
or Iran; I am talking about a group of 
corporations—the most powerful cor-
porations in the history of this Nation, 
the most powerful corporations in the 
history of the world. I am talking 
about being Big Tech. 
We know who they are. They run the 
giant digital platforms, the places 
where Americans communicate and 
share their opinions. But those plat-
forms are more than that. They are 
more than places to talk or buy things.

September 24, 2020 
Instagram and YouTube—these are the 
platforms that control more and more 
of our daily lives. 
And, yes, I said ‘‘control.’’ These 
platforms control our social commu-
nication, the way that we talk to each 
other, when and how, where, and on 
what terms. They control what news 
we read or even what news we see. 
They control more and more jour-
nalism in America, right down to what 
is in news articles and how the head-
lines are written. 
They control how elected officials 
communicate with their constituents, 
when they can run advertisements, 
what their messages can say and can’t. 
And they want to control us. Big 
Tech platforms relentlessly spy on 
their customers—you and me. They 
track us around the web. They monitor 
our every move online and even when 
we are offline. 
They track our location and whether 
we are in a car or riding a bike or on 
the street. They track the websites 
that we visit and when. They track the 
things that we buy. They track the vid-
eos that we watch. They track what 
our children are doing. They track ev-
erything—all with the purpose of get-
ting enough information on each one of 
us to influence us, to shape our pref-
erences and opinions and viewpoints. 
This is enormous power—unheard of 
power—and the Big Tech platforms are 
intent on using it. They are intent on 
using it in this election. 
Let’s just cut to the chase: The Big 
Tech platforms are owned and operated 
by woke capitalists. They are leftists. 
They are liberals. They are not con-
servatives. They are no friend to con-
servatives. They fervently opposed the 
election of Donald Trump and other 
conservatives in 2016. They fervently 
oppose it this year. 
Now they are trying to use their 
power to shape the outcome of an elec-
tion. For months, the tech platforms 
have been engaging in escalating acts 
of 
censorship—political 
censorship— 
aimed at conservatives. 
They have censored the President of 
the United States. They have banned 
pro-life groups from their sites. They 
have tried to silence independent con-
servative journalists like the Fed-
eralist. 
Now, the censorship is never against 
liberals, notice. No, Joe Biden isn’t 
censored. Pro-choice groups aren’t dis-
criminated against. Liberal news sites, 
they don’t get threatened and bullied 
and shut out. 
No, Big Tech targets conservatives 
for censorship for a simple reason: 
They don’t like conservatives. They 
don’t agree with conservatives. They 
don’t want to see conservatives get 
elected. 
Here is the thing: If they are allowed 
to use their power in this way, if they 
are permitted to leverage their control 
over news and information and data to 
silence the voices of conservatives, 
then we will be turning control of our 
government over to them. 
Big Tech targets conservatives for 
censorship for a simple reason: They 
don’t like conservatives. They don’t 
agree with conservatives. 
We will be turning control of our 
elections over to them, control of the 
Nation over to them. Let’s just be 
clear. No corporation should run Amer-
ica. No set of corporate overlords 
should substitute their judgment for 
the judgment of ‘‘we the people.’’ No 
woke capitalists should be able to 
shape the outcome of an election by si-
lencing speech. That is why we have to 
act, and act today. 
There is a simple, straightforward so-
lution to the censorship power of these 
digital platforms: Let those who have 
been censored claim their rights. Let 
them sue. Let them go to court. Let 
them challenge the decisions of the 
tech platforms and have their day be-
fore the bar of the law. Right now, Fed-
eral law prohibits this. It prevents 
Americans from challenging the tech 
platforms and their censorship. It pre-
vents Americans from challenging just 
about anything that the tech compa-
nies do. 
That should change. That is why 
today I urge this body to adopt my leg-
islation, which I have proudly intro-
duced, along with Senators RUBIO, COT-
TON, BRAUN, and LOEFFLER, to give 
every 
American 
who 
is 
unfairly 
censored the right to have his or her 
day in court, the right to stand and be 
heard, the right to fairness and due 
process of law. This is a stand we must 
take in defense of free speech, in de-
fense of our elections, but more impor-
tantly, above all, in defense of our de-
mocracy and the rule of ‘‘we the peo-
ple.’’ 
So I ask unanimous consent that the 
Committee on Commerce be discharged 
from further consideration of S. 3983 
and the Senate proceed to its imme-
diate consideration. I ask unanimous 
consent that the bill be considered read 
a third time and passed and that the 
motion to reconsider be considered 
made and laid upon the table. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
Mr. WYDEN. Reserving the right to 
object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Oregon. 
Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I just 
want to say in the Senate, in my time 
in this body, this is one of the most 
stunning abuses of power I have seen in 
my time of public service. 
I think my colleague knows that I 
was sitting until 5 minutes ago in the 
Ways and Means Committee, where I 
was invited to testify about Social Se-
curity, and I was given a message that 
the Senator from Missouri was going to 
stand up and basically try to throw in 
the garbage can a bipartisan law that I 
and a conservative Republican, former 
Congressman Chris Cox—well known to 
conservatives—wrote because as we 
thought about the formulation of tech-
nology policy, our big concern was for 
the little guy, for the person who 
didn’t have power, the person who 
didn’t have clout. 
We were picking up accounts that if 
they were just trying to come out with 
their invention—might be something 
they put up on a website or a blog— 
they could be held personally liable for 
something that was posted on their 
sites that they had no idea about. 
So we said: We can’t do that to the 
little guy. We can’t strip them of their 
voice. 
By the way, my concern about the 
little guy that led to the passage of 
this law is something I continue to 
focus on today. 
This law is hugely important to 
movements like Me Too and Black 
Lives Matter because it gives Ameri-
cans the opportunity to see the mes-
sages they want to get out. We all see 
the 
videos. 
Frankly, 
establishment 
media wouldn’t even run a lot of it be-
cause they would be sued. 
So the original interest in this was 
making sure that the little guy had a 
chance to be heard. That is the interest 
today. That is what the Senator from 
Missouri wants to throw in the trash 
can. That is No. 1. 
No. 2, the effect of what the Senator 
from Missouri wants to do—and for col-
leagues who have just come in, I just 
learned about this 5 minutes before the 
Senator from Missouri came to the 
floor. The net effect of this is that Don-
ald Trump can force social media—and 
he is already working the refs—to print 
his lies. 
The thing that concerned me right at 
the outset was the lies about vote-by- 
mail. He wanted to force Twitter to 
print his lies about vote-by-mail. That, 
too, is something that we sought to 
constrain in the bipartisan law. And 
many people think the 26 words really 
began a policy of empowering the little 
guy to be heard. 
Now, I am going to wrap up with just 
one point. Colleagues, the Senator 
from Missouri talks about how he 
wants to take on Big Tech. That is his 
concern. Let’s take on Big Tech. 
If you want to take on Big Tech, you 
can go on my privacy bill. It is called 
the Mind Your Own Business Act. It is 
the toughest bill on the table with re-
spect to Big Tech. It says that if an ex-
ecutive, a CEO, of one of the big com-
panies, lies and lies repeatedly, they 
could be held personally liable, includ-
ing the prospect of prison time. 
So if the Senator from Missouri is se-
rious about taking on Big Tech, I have 
a bill to do it. That is not what the in-
terest is here. This is all about Donald 
Trump wanting to force social media to 
carry his political water and to print 
his lies. 
For that reason—and I would have 
more to say had I been given some sem-
blance of a courtesy to be able to pre-
pare remarks on this, I would speak in 
more detail, but for those reasons, at 
least those three, I object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard. 
The Senator from Missouri.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S5854 
September 24, 2020 
Mr. HAWLEY. Mr. President, I will 
just say to my friend, the Democratic 
Senator describes a world that just 
doesn’t exist. He says Section 230 pro-
tects the little guy? Section 230 pro-
tects the most powerful corporations in 
the history of the world. Google and 
Facebook 
aren’t 
the 
little 
guy. 
Instagram and Twitter aren’t the little 
guy. 
Do you know who is left vulnerable 
by those mega corporations? The peo-
ple who don’t have a voice. The people 
who, when they get deplatformed, don’t 
have an option. If you are silenced by 
Google or Facebook or Twitter, what is 
your option? None. Nothing. You can’t 
be heard. You can’t go to court. You 
can’t do anything. 
Every American should have the 
right, if they are unfairly discrimi-
nated against because of their political 
views, to at least be heard in court. 
Section 230, as it exists today and as 
it is currently being applied, protects 
the most powerful corporations. It pro-
tects and has protected human traf-
fickers. It protects some of the worst 
abuses of free speech in our society. 
That is why I will continue to fight to 
have it reformed and continue to fight 
to give the American people a voice. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Oregon. 
Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I am told 
the Senator from Arkansas is up, and I 
will be very brief. I appreciate his cour-
tesy. 
Once again, the Senator from Mis-
souri is getting it all wrong. He talks 
again about how this law—this bipar-
tisan law—is basically not for the little 
guy, but he is taking on the big guys. 
Well, the reason that is factually 
wrong is that on this floor, a previous 
effort was made to deal with sex traf-
ficking. It was called SESTA and 
FOSTA, and the desire was—we are all 
against this horrible smut online. We 
are all against it. The desire was to 
block it. 
As the debate went forward, I and 
others said: You are not going to be 
able to block it. You are going to be 
able to block Backpage, like what 
eventually happened under existing 
law, which I supported—not under this 
new thing. 
Well, 
guess 
who 
supported 
this 
SESTA-FOSTA deal that is pretty 
much like the Senator from Missouri— 
it was Facebook. Facebook supported 
the last effort. Last time I looked, they 
are a pretty big company. So the Sen-
ator from Missouri is just getting it all 
wrong here. 
I come back to the proposition—I see 
my friend from Vermont, who has been 
really the tech expert here—that what 
we have always been about is the little 
guy, and you see it every day with Me 
Too, Black Lives Matter, and so many 
voices from the community that, be-
cause of this law, can be heard. 
I do not—not just on this, because I 
have objected, so it can’t go forward— 
I do not accept this idea that this 
somehow is the path to solving prob-
lems 
in 
communications, 
because 
under SESTA-FOSTA, which is really 
the kind of model the Senator from 
Missouri is talking about, the only 
thing that happened was the horren-
dous people involved in sex trafficking 
went to the dark web, and so now we 
have an even bigger problem. 
Mr. President, I don’t expect this will 
be the last time we talk about it, but I 
would like to repeat to the Senator 
from Missouri that if the roles were re-
versed here and I had an idea that I 
wanted to advance, I would extend a 
courtesy to give him an opportunity to 
prepare remarks. 
Thank you, Mr. President. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Arkansas. 
Mr. COTTON. Mr. President, mer-
cifully, I know of no further debate on 
the motion. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
further debate? 
If not, the question is on agreeing to 
the motion to proceed. 
Mr. COTTON. I ask for the yeas and 
nays. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a 
sufficient second?

REAFFIRMING 
THE 
SENATE’S 
COMMITMENT TO THE ORDERLY 
AND PEACEFUL TRANSFER OF 
POWER 
Mr. MANCHIN. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the Senate 
proceed to the consideration of S. Res. 
718, submitted earlier today. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will report the resolution by 
title. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
read as follows: 
A resolution (S. Res. 718) reaffirming the 
Senate’s commitment to the orderly and 
peaceful transfer of power called for in the 
Constitution of the United States, and for 
other purposes. 
There being no objection, the Senate 
proceeded to consider the resolution. 
Mr. MANCHIN. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the resolution 
be agreed to, the preamble be agreed 
to, and the motions to reconsider be 
considered made and laid upon the 
table with no intervening action or de-
bate. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
The resolution (S. Res. 718) was 
agreed to. 
The preamble was agreed to. 
(The resolution, with its preamble, is 
printed in today’s RECORD under ‘‘Sub-
mitted Resolutions.’’) 
Mr. 
MANCHIN. 
Mr. 
President, 
I 
would like to speak to the resolution. 
It is a shame that we have to come 
and reaffirm our commitment to our 
country, to our Constitution, and who 
we are as a people and how we became 
the greatest country on Earth and the 
freedoms we all take for granted many, 
many times. 
Sometimes we hear things that chal-
lenge that. We heard that yesterday, 
and we were very concerned about 
that. 
As of today, my friend and colleague 
from Indiana, Senator BRAUN, basically 
wanted to reaffirm our commitment to 
the Pledge of Allegiance, which is 
something we should do every day—our 
Pledge of Allegiance to our flag and to 
our great country. 
What we are doing with this resolu-
tion is basically saying that the bed-
rock of democracy is the orderly and 
peaceful transfer of power when a 
President transitions out. This should 
not be a question. There should not 
ever be one iota of interruption what-
soever at that peaceful demonstration. 
I remember 1960. At that time, it was 
the race between Senator John Ken-
nedy 
and 
Vice 
President 
Richard 
Nixon. It was very, very close. Every-
one was on pins and needles, but there 
was an orderly transfer. Richard Nixon 
conceded, and to take this out further, 
he did a peaceful and orderly transfer, 
and away he went. 
Then you had Al Gore—Senator Al 
Gore at that time, former Vice Presi-
dent Al Gore—and George W. Bush in 
2000. We know how that turned out 
with the chads and all the hanging 
chads and the consternation of not 
knowing for so long. Then, basically, 
for the sake of our country, he did the 
right thing. Again, we expect that to 
be done. 
We are in the most difficult times 
right now, and for the President to 
even address the subject of maybe not 
knowing if he would accept or not is 
beyond all of our comprehension that 
could ever happen in America, that it 
could ever happen in the discourse and 
the will of the voters, the verification 
of the votes and being able to protect 
the ballot box. We have come too long 
in our country, and we continue to be 
challenged. 
I believe that to have the leader of 
the free world talk as if we are an au-
tocracy—authoritarian versus a democ-
racy—is something that alarmed me, 
along with colleagues on both sides of 
the aisle. Even as quiet as some may 
be, I know they are alarmed with that. 
What we did is affirm who we are in 
the Senate and what we believe in. The 
resolution is very clear. All it says is 
that we affirm as the Senate our ‘‘com-
mitment to the orderly and peaceful 
transfer of power called for in the Con-
stitution of the United States’’ and in-
tend that there should be no disrup-
tions by the President or any person in 
power to overturn the will of the peo-
ple of the United States. It is really 
who we are. 
Mr. President, it is what you de-
fended, what you fought for, why you 
entered the service. I am so proud of all 
the people who have served. Thank you 
for your service, Mr. President. 
Thank you to all the people in West 
Virginia, the most patriotic people in 
the world. I have said this many times. 
I am so proud of my State. We have 
more veterans per capita than most 
any State; shed more blood, lost more 
lives for the cause of freedom than 
most any State. We never failed to an-
swer the call. We have done the heavy 
lifting. Our people worked hard, includ-
ing my grandfather and all my rel-
atives. We mined the coal that made 
the steel that built the guns and ships 
and the factories and defended our 
country and our great Nation. We are 
very proud of all that. 
This is not who we are. This is not 
who we are, and we must speak loudly. 
This is not politics. This is not Repub-
lican or Democrat—make no mistake. 
This is basically saying that if you be-
lieve—for the sake of the Good Lord 
and all we believe in and our country, 
this is about maintaining this democ-
racy. That is all this is about—main-
taining. We will defend that. 
Today, we have just reaffirmed our 
commitment to the orderly transition 
of power by the President of the United 
States, whoever that should be, when-
ever that might happen; that they 
must have an orderly transfer that we 
all will defend and uphold. That is 
what we affirmed today. 
Thank you for giving me the oppor-
tunity, and I thank all my colleagues 
on both sides of the aisle. Thank you 
for standing true for who we are and 
what we believe in and what we have 
committed ourselves to. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. KAINE. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
REMEMBERING JUSTICE RUTH BADER GINSBURG 
Mr. KAINE. Mr. President, I want to 
rise just briefly to pay tribute to Ruth 
Bader Ginsburg. 
I saw a statement about her in the 
aftermath of her passing that said she 
will probably go down in history as one 
of the greatest women lawyers in the 
history of the United States. I don’t 
think that does her justice. I want to 
take the floor to say that Ruth Bader 
Ginsburg, in my view, will probably go 
down in history as one of the top three 
judges and lawyers ever in the history 
of the United States, male or female. I 
want to describe why. Before I do, I 
just want to notice the outpouring of 
support for her. 
In the 4 days after she passed, from 
Friday night until Tuesday night, my 
office received 37,000 pieces of cor-
respondence about Justice Ginsburg, 
praising her, lifting her up as a role 
model, expressing concern about what 
the Court would be without her. In my 
8 years in the Senate, I have never seen 
an outpouring of support for an indi-
vidual like that. That is just an exam-
ple of how highly we hold her in regard. 
Justice Ginsburg is well known and 
particularly well known in Virginia. 
One of the opinions she authored that 
is one of her real pivotal opinions was 
an opinion that ruled that a public uni-
versity—the Virginia Military Insti-
tute—could not deny access to women

students. That was a very controver-
sial case in Virginia. Justice Gins-
burg’s opinion was courteous and rec-
ognized the great virtue of VMI as an 
institution but held up its many vir-
tues and values and said women stu-
dents at this public university should 
be able to have the same access. 
Justice Ginsburg as a Justice has left 
her mark on our society in such an 
amazing way. 
I want to talk about Ruth Bader 
Ginsburg the lawyer because I assert 
that if Ruth Bader Ginsburg had never 
been on the Supreme Court, she still 
would have earned her way into one of 
the greatest American lawyers or ju-
rists of all time. Ruth Bader Ginsburg. 
It was a Virginian who wrote into the 
Declaration of Independence the words 
that are maybe among some of the 
most known words in the English lan-
guage: ‘‘We hold these truths to be self- 
evident, that all men are created 
equal.’’ Those words are so powerful. 
They set out a powerful North Star for 
our country in equality and principle 
but had ambiguity wrapped up in them. 
Jefferson, although he believed in 
equality, knew and was deeply troubled 
by the fact that slaves and other even 
freed African Americans at the time 
were not treated equally. Jefferson 
wasn’t particularly troubled by the 
fact that women were not treated 
equally at that time. He had an ability 
to see what the principle should be but 
not necessarily to apply it to his own 
life, which is, frankly, a weakness that 
I think we all have suffered from dur-
ing our life at times, but at least he set 
out the right principle and said that it 
applied to men. 
I think you can look at the history of 
our country as a North Star was set for 
us in 1776, and over time, we sort of 
progressively realized, wow, that is 
what equality means. We have to ori-
ent closer to the star. A sailor can 
steer by a star without ever reaching 
it, and maybe, because we are imper-
fect people, we can orient by the star of 
equality and never get fully there be-
cause we are imperfect. When we orient 
by it, we do pretty well. 
In the aftermath of the Civil War, the 
Constitution was dramatically rewrit-
ten with the addition of the 13th 
Amendment, banning slavery; the 14th 
Amendment, creating due process and 
equal protection of the laws; and the 
15th Amendment, blocking limitations 
of voting based on race. 
I want to talk for a minute the 14th 
Amendment. 
The 
14th 
Amendment 
might be the longest amendment in the 
Constitution. It is power-packed. 
Every citizen is entitled to the privi-
leges and immunities of citizenship. No 
one can be ‘‘deprived of life, liberty or 
property without due process of law,’’ 
but especially—that echoing of what 
Jefferson said—all persons are entitled 
to the ‘‘equal protection of the laws.’’ 
The 14th Amendment is interesting 
because in other parts of the amend-
ment, it talks about what you get if 
you are a citizen, but on the equal pro-
tection side, you don’t have to be a cit-
izen. All persons are entitled to ‘‘equal 
protection of the laws.’’ 
When that was passed by Congress 
and ratified by States in 1870, the Con-
stitution fundamentally changed. One 
of the fascinating things is, as soon as 
the Constitution had this 14th Amend-
ment with this particular clause in it 
guaranteeing equal protection of the 
laws—let me tell you about one of the 
first cases that came to the Supreme 
Court. 
A woman by the name of Myra 
Bradwell, living in Illinois, wanted to 
be licensed to practice law. She wanted 
to be a lawyer, just like Ruth Bader 
Ginsburg. Illinois would not allow her 
to practice law because she was a 
woman. She said: Wait a minute. We 
have a 14th Amendment, and it guaran-
tees me the privileges and immunities 
of being a U.S. citizen, guarantees me 
equal protection of the laws. 
She took her case all the way up to 
the U.S. Supreme Court after Illinois 
denied her a law license. In 1871, 1 year 
after the Constitution had been amend-
ed to guarantee the equality of every 
person, by an 8-to-1 decision, the Su-
preme Court ruled that Myra Bradwell 
could not practice law and Illinois 
could limit law practice to men if that 
is what they chose. 
Let me read from that opinion. Jus-
tice Bradley wrote an opinion then on 
the Court. Here is what he said: 
The natural and proper timidity and deli-
cacy which belongs to the female sex evi-
dently unfits it for many of the oc-cupations 
of civil life. . . . The paramount destiny and 
mission of women are to fulfill the noble and 
benign offices of wife and mother. This is the 
law of the Creator. 
By an 8-to-1 decision, the U.S. Su-
preme Court, on which Ruth Bader 
Ginsburg would later sit after a distin-
guished career as an attorney, said 
that Illinois could deprive women of 
the ability to practice the profession of 
lawyer. 
When did the Supreme Court change 
that ruling? It is still kind of shocking 
to me that it was not until 1971—100 
years later, in a case called Reed v. 
Reed, a case that came out of the State 
court system in Idaho—that Chief Jus-
tice Warren Burger, for a unanimous 
Court, said: Wait a minute. The 14th 
Amendment says all persons are enti-
tled to the equal protection of the 
laws. Guess what. That applies to 
women. 
How the Court in 1871 could have read 
those words and said it didn’t apply to 
women is kind of hard to imagine, but 
it should make us humble because it 
should suggest that even educated, 
smart people could get things wrong. 
Yet, 100 years later, in 1971, there was 
Reed v. Reed, which was a technical, 
quirky case about Idaho law that pre-
ferred men over women to be executors 
of estates so that, if there were two 
with equal claims in terms of being a 
relation of somebody who died intes-
tate, they would prefer a man over a 
woman. That was a quirky, technical 
case that came to the Supreme Court. 
After 101 years, following the passage 
of the 14th Amendment, the Supreme 
Court said: Wait a minute. Women are 
citizens. Women are people. Women are 
entitled to equality. 
Who wrote the brief in that case? 
The brief in that case was written by 
a talented, young lawyer who had been 
one of nine in her class at Harvard Law 
School, who had often been told she 
couldn’t do this or she couldn’t do 
that, and who hadn’t often been offered 
jobs along the way. The brief in that 
case was written by Ruth Bader Gins-
burg. In very, very characteristic hu-
mility, she was the brains behind the 
case, but she allowed the case to be ar-
gued in the Supreme Court by the 
Idaho attorney who was very close to 
Mrs. Reed, who was pursuing the ap-
peal in the Supreme Court. 
When Reed v. Reed was decided, it 
was an earthquake. After 100 years, to 
finally say that, of course, women are 
equal, and, of course, women can make 
claims under the 14th Amendment, it 
was an earthquake, and it affected all 
aspects of American law. 
Immediately after Reed v. Reed, Con-
gress went through the entire United 
States Code. There were dozens—pos-
sibly hundreds—of distinctions in the 
code that gave preference to men over 
women or made some distinction be-
tween men and women. Yet, after Reed 
v. Reed, Congress scrubbed the laws of 
this country to eliminate second-class 
status for women, at least in law. We 
haven’t completely gotten there but 
maybe in practice. 
The State legislatures of all 50 States 
also did the same. There were all kinds 
of quirky and archaic rules that held 
women back in property and in civil 
matters—laws that, for example, said 
that a married woman, because of 
being married, couldn’t prosecute a 
rape charge against her husband or 
that it was a defense to rape if the man 
married the woman—that this could be 
a complete defense and could wipe out 
criminal offenses. 
All of these weird distinctions in law 
that had been allowed since the begin-
ning of our country, even with a Con-
stitution 
that 
guaranteed 
women’s 
equality, were suddenly under the mi-
croscope with a new way of looking at 
our society, and it changed because of 
this tiny giant, Ruth Bader Ginsburg. 
That is the only point that I really 
want to make today on the floor. As a 
Justice, Ruth Bader Ginsburg changed 
our country and had a big impact in 
Virginia in the decision about the Vir-
ginia Military Institute. That decision 
was about one institution, but it be-
came a decision that applied to all in-
stitutions—that public educational in-
stitutions cannot deprive women of 
equal access to the educational experi-
ence. 
I will just conclude where I started. 
If Ruth Bader Ginsburg had never 
been a Supreme Court Justice, the 
work that she had done as an architect 
of helping the American legal system

September 24, 2020 
but also the American citizens under-
stand that equal protection of the laws 
applies to women just like they apply 
to men would have entitled her to have 
been viewed as one of the most 
impactful lawyers of all time. 
I would put her up with John Mar-
shall, the first great Chief Justice of 
the Court, who really had to form so 
many of the doctrines that we now sort 
of take for granted about our American 
jurisprudence, and Thurgood Marshall, 
who, in many ways, carried the same 
fight for equality to make us realize 
that it applied to people regardless of 
the color of their skin and then served 
on the Supreme Court. They are the 
two lawyers of whom I think when I 
think of Ruth Bader Ginsburg, and I 
am not sure that anyone else is in the 
same class with her other than those 
two. 
It is a sad time when someone of such 
magnitude passes, but I can tell from 
the 37,000 pieces of correspondence that 
my office received in the first 4 days 
after she left that, if you measure a life 
not by the day that it ends but by the 
influence that it has and the example 
that it sets, it is also a time in which 
we can just admire, be in awe of, and 
celebrate the accomplishments of a 
wonderful American. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
BRAUN). The clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. UDALL. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
Mr. UDALL. Mr. President, last Fri-
day, as the Jewish New Year began, 
Rosh Hashanah, our Nation lost a titan 
of justice and an unmatched force for 
good—Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. 
According to Jewish tradition, a per-
son who dies on Rosh Hashanah is a 
tzaddik—a person of great righteous-
ness. Justice Ginsburg, who was only 
the seventh Jewish Supreme Court Jus-
tice and the first female Jewish Jus-
tice, was, indeed, righteous. 
I and Jill, my wife, were proud to call 
Ruth a friend, and like all Santa 
Feans, we are proud that Ruth graced 
our city at the Santa Fe Opera every 
summer. She loved New Mexico, and 
New Mexico loved her. Our hearts are 
with Justice Ginsburg’s family. 
You shared a great national treasure 
with all of us, and we are eternally 
grateful. 
Ruth Bader Ginsburg was 1 of only 12 
women who graduated from Columbia 
Law School in 1959. With a young child 
in tow, she tied for first in her class. 
Talk about a trailblazer. Indeed, RBG, 
as she is so affectionately called, 
blazed so many trails—too many to 
list. She was the first woman to serve 
on two major law reviews and one of 
the first female law professors in the 
Nation. She cofounded the first law 
journal on women’s rights, and coau-
thored the first casebook on gender dis-
crimination. 
Ruth Bader Ginsburg had to push 
open those doors because no one opened 
them for her. She was no stranger to 
gender discrimination. She was de-
moted at work when she became preg-
nant with her first child. She was re-
fused a U.S. Supreme Court clerkship 
because she was a woman. She was also 
paid less than her male counterparts as 
a law professor. 
Always driven toward justice, RBG 
became the leading legal mind behind 
incrementally dismantling gender dis-
crimination laws in the United States. 
She spearheaded the strategy to apply 
the 14th Amendment—requiring equal 
protection under the law—to women, 
and she won in the Supreme Court five 
times. Her victories helped to take 
down the mass of legal structures rel-
egating women to second-class status. 
She accomplished what was nearly im-
possible and expanded who is included 
in ‘‘We the People,’’ and her quest for 
justice never ended. 
As 
a 
jurist, 
she 
authored 
groundbreaking 
opinions—striking 
down strict requirements on abortion 
clinics that were designed to put them 
out of business, establishing the right 
of persons with mental illness to be 
treated in the community instead of in 
institutions, and opening up the Vir-
ginia Military Institute to female ca-
dets, which, I think, Senator KAINE 
talked about a little bit earlier. 
She was also as well known for her 
forceful dissents. ‘‘I dissent’’ has be-
come a rallying cry against an activist 
conservative Court. 
In 2013, when the Court struck down 
the preclearance provisions of the Vot-
ing Rights Act, Justice Ginsburg de-
clared: ‘‘’Hubris’ is a fit word for to-
day’s demolition of the VRA.’’ She ob-
served that striking down voting pro-
tections because they worked too well 
was like ‘‘throwing away your um-
brella in a rainstorm because you are 
not getting wet.’’ 
Justice Ginsburg was brilliant, deter-
mined, and courageous. 
Now, as her long and well-lived life 
has come to an end and as the Nation 
mourns, it is only fitting that she con-
tinue 
making 
firsts—as 
the 
first 
woman to lie in state in the Capitol. 
All of us—women and men alike—owe a 
debt of gratitude to Justice Ginsburg 
and to her righteous and unwavering 
commitment to justice and equality 
under the law. 
As you have now heard many times, 
Justice Ginsburg’s last words to the 
American public were ‘‘My most fer-
vent wish is that I will not be replaced 
until a new president is installed.’’ 
Yet, mere hours after the Supreme 
Court announced Justice Ginsburg’s 
passing, while the Nation was in 
mourning, 
Leader 
MCCONNELL
an-
nounced he would replace her before 
the current Presidency ends. 
Let me say this: While my heart is 
broken, my soul is on fire. 
Not only are Senate Republicans dis-
regarding Justice Ginsburg’s last re-
quest, they are turning their back on 
the principle that they claimed was 
pure just 4 years ago. 
In February 2016, Justice Scalia 
passed away a full 9 months before a 
Presidential election. At that time, the 
majority leader refused to hold hear-
ings 
on 
President 
Obama’s 
highly 
qualified nominee, proclaiming: 
The American people should have a voice 
in the selection of their next Supreme Court 
Justice. Therefore, this vacancy should not 
be filled until we have a new president. 
Those words meant nothing. They 
were deceitful tricks in pursuit of raw 
power, and they have brought shame 
upon this body. 
Election day is only 40 days away, 
but it is more accurate to say that the 
election ends in 40 days, because the 
election is actually underway today. 
Voters are already voting in 29 States. 
More than half of the States are vot-
ing. Tens of millions of Americans will 
cast their votes before election day. 
The leader’s vow to vote to replace 
Justice Ginsburg is a slap in the face to 
these voters and runs roughshod over 
the Constitution. 
Senator MCCONNELL
is moving at 
lightning speed to steal the second Su-
preme Court seat because he knows 
this President faces an uncertain elec-
toral future. He is scared to let the 
American people, as he put it, ‘‘have a 
voice in the selection of their next Su-
preme Court Justice.’’ 
This hypocrisy is only outmatched 
by the utter disdain for American vot-
ers—disdain for their intelligence, dis-
dain for their will. 
But the real scandal will be what this 
means to the American people. On No-
vember 10, 7 days after election day, 
the Supreme Court will hear argument 
on the legality of the Affordable Care 
Act, or what many call the ACA. After 
failing to repeal the ACA in Congress, 
now the Republicans are trying to de-
stroy it in the courts, and they are 
rushing to fill this vacancy with a 
judge who will do that work for them. 
The Trump administration is stand-
ing with 20 Republican Governors and 
attorneys general who are asking the 
Supreme Court to strike down the 
ACA. Republicans are trying to take 
away Americans’ healthcare in the 
middle of the worst pandemic in a cen-
tury. It is unforgivable. 
By 
overwhelming 
numbers, 
the 
American people support the ACA. Be-
fore the ACA, insurance companies 
could deny healthcare insurance to 
people with preexisting conditions. Up 
to 129 million Americans under age 65 
have preexisting conditions. The mil-
lions of people who have been infected 
by COVID–19 now have a preexisting 
condition for the rest of their lives. In 
my home State of New Mexico, more 
than 840,000 people live with a pre-
existing condition. Because of the ACA, 
23 
million 
more 
Americans 
have 
healthcare 
insurance, 
and 
millions 
more have Medicaid expansion. This in-
cludes hundreds of thousands of New 
Mexicans.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S5858 
September 24, 2020 
When the ACA was challenged years 
ago, the Supreme Court upheld it by a 
5-to-4 vote. We are one vote away from 
the decimation of our healthcare rights 
at a time when nearly 7 million Ameri-
cans have contracted COVID–19. 
The threat is not only to the ACA 
but 
also 
to 
women’s 
reproductive 
healthcare, our environmental protec-
tions, and what is left of our campaign 
finance limits. So we know why they 
are moving at a record pace to fill this 
seat. 
But while the President and the ma-
jority leader want to rush through a 
lifetime Justice in just a few weeks, 
COVID relief has languished on Sen-
ator MCCONNELL’s desk for months. 
Millions of Americans are out of work. 
Small businesses are closing their 
doors. Schools can’t reopen safely. Par-
ents are burning the candle at both 
ends, working and caring for kids at 
home. State, local, and Tribal govern-
ments can’t meet budgets for essential 
services. 
The American people desperately 
need another relief package, but the 
Senate Republicans and the President 
don’t think there is any urgency. Lead-
er MCCONNELL said that himself. 
According to the President, COVID– 
19 ‘‘affects virtually nobody.’’ The 
President said that—‘‘affects virtually 
nobody.’’ 
This virus that ‘‘affects virtually no-
body’’ is the third leading cause of 
death in the United States, has taken 
more lives in 8 short months than the 
Vietnam and Middle East wars com-
bined, and has sent our economy into a 
nosedive not seen since the Great De-
pression. 
We talk a lot about priorities here in 
the Senate. Right now you are seeing 
Senate Republican priorities in stark 
relief. They will rush a lifetime Su-
preme Court pick in weeks—violating 
every principle they established them-
selves—to please their far-right donors. 
But they will neglect relief for you—for 
struggling families, for people out of 
work, for people sick and dying—for 
months. 
Finally, we cannot ignore the fact 
that the President has explicitly said 
he wants to fill this vacancy to help de-
cide the 2020 election in his favor. He 
has repeatedly lied that absentee bal-
lots, votes from Democratic areas, or 
votes that are tabulated after election 
day are somehow fraudulent. 
And like an authoritarian, he does 
not even try to correct himself when 
his lies are debunked. Instead, he open-
ly admits he wants the Supreme Court 
to decide the election by disqualifying 
votes he does not like and even refuses 
to commit to a peaceful transfer of 
power. 
The Senate should not become an ac-
complice to this corrupt scheme that 
threatens the future of our democracy, 
and every Senate Republican should 
condemn the President’s refusal to 
commit to give up power peacefully. 
I would note that several of my Re-
publican friends have stood up and 
have said that there should be a peace-
ful transition of power, and I applaud 
them for that. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER.

The bill clerk proceeded to call the

for the quorum call be rescinded.

RECOGNIZING GOLD SHAW FARM 
Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, agri-
culture has always been at the heart of 
Vermont’s economy. For generations, 
families across Vermont have made a 
living through agriculture, tilling our 
rocky soil and raising livestock on our 
hillsides. Farming in Vermont has al-
ways been a challenging yet very re-
warding way of life. Now more than 
ever, it is clear to see the obstacles 
faced by farmers. I would like to take 
a moment to recognize Gold Shaw 
Farm, a farm founded by a husband and 
wife team in northeastern Vermont. 
Morgan and Allison Gold, the owners of 
Gold Shaw Farm, have found a very in-
teresting way to meet these challenges, 
supplement their agricultural income, 
adapt their practices, and share their 
work with the world. 
Morgan and Allison Gold moved to 
Peacham, VT, and established their 
farm in 2016. On their 150-acre plot, the 
Golds raise chickens, geese, ducks, and 
sheep and cultivate a variety of vegeta-
bles and berries. Soon after they start-
ed farming, the Golds began filming 
their daily activities and posting them 
on YouTube. The farm may be small, 
but over the years, Gold Shaw Farm 
has amassed a very large and loyal fan 
base that tune in regularly to watch as 
Morgan and Allison collect eggs, chase 
ducks, and play with their dog, Toby. 
Some of the farm’s fans have even driv-
en all the way to Peacham to buy eggs 
and visit the farm. With the help of 
their growing audience, the Golds hope 
to expand their farm into a larger sus-
tainable operation. Starting and main-
taining a farm is challenging work, but 
in the Golds’ model, we see innovative 
and creative ways to not only docu-
ment farming experiences, but share 
those experiences with the world and 
hopefully inspire a new generation of 
farmers. I look forward to tuning in to 
watch their progress. 
Earlier this year, the Golds were 
profiled in The New York Times, and I 
ask unanimous consent that the arti-
cle, ‘‘In a Wistful Age, Farmers Find a 
New Angle: Chores’’ be printed in the 
RECORD. 
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the 
RECORD, as follows: 
[From the New York Times, Aug. 7, 2020] 
IN A WISTFUL AGE, FARMERS FIND A NEW 
ANGLE: CHORES 
(By Ellen Barry) 
PEACHAM, VT.—The sweet smell of hay rose 
off the earth on a recent evening, as Morgan 
Gold strode across his farmyard in heavy 
boots. He crossed the paddock, scanning for 
new eggs, water levels, infected peck wounds, 
rips in the fence line. 
But mainly—let’s be honest—he was look-
ing for content. 
Though Mr. Gold sells poultry and eggs 
from his duck farm in Vermont’s northeast 
corner, most of what he produces as a farmer 
is, well, entertainment. 
Mr. Gold, who is short and stocky, with the 
good-natured ease of a standup comedian, 
does his chores while carrying a digital cam-
era in one hand and murmuring into a micro-
phone. 
Then, twice a week, like clockwork, he 
posts a short video on YouTube about his ex-
ploits as a neophyte farmer, often high-
lighting failures or pratfalls. Keeping a close 
eye on analytics, he has boosted his YouTube 
audiences high enough to provide a steady 
advertising revenue of around $2,500 to $4,000 
a month, about eight times what he earns 
from selling farm products. 
This part of New England is rocky, hilly 
and isolated, and generations of small farm-
ers have cast about for new ways to scrape 
out a living: the sleigh rides, the alpacas, the 
therapy ponies, the pick-your-own hemp. It 
is a new thing, though, to make farm life 
into reality TV. 
Mr. Gold, 40, has learned the hard way—he 
tried to take a month off last winter—that 
any gap in his YouTube publication schedule 
results in a steep drop-off in audience. So he 
keeps a running list of themes that could be 
fodder for future videos. It reads, in part: 
Should I Feed My Dog Eggs? 
Don’t Trust This Duck 
My Homestead Is a Dumpster Fire 
What Does My Guard Dog Do All Day? 
He has learned, through trial and error, 
what works with an audience. The sheepdog- 
mounted GoPro didn’t work. (‘‘People were 
like, 10 seconds and I was puking,’’ said his 
wife, Allison Ebrahimi Gold.) Slow, sump-
tuous drone footage of his sun-dappled 150 
acres, land porn for wistful cubicle dwell-
ers—that definitely works. 
Character development works, as dem-
onstrated by Mr. Gold’s most popular video, 
‘‘Our Freakishly Huge Duck (This Is Not 
NORMAL),’’ which, as he would put it, blew 
the doors off. Slow-motion footage of wag-
gling goose butts, set to a bouncy, whimsical 
orchestral soundtrack, works.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S5859 
September 24, 2020 
But few things compel audiences, he came 
to realize, more than a real-life setback. He 
came to this realization last summer when a 
mink broke into his duck hutch, leaving its 
interior spattered with eggs and blood and 
feathers. 
‘‘It was one of the most depressing days of 
my life,’’ he said, adding, ‘‘but at the same 
time, I’m thinking, ‘How is the audience 
going to react to this sort of thing?’ ’’ 
The next videos, which featured freaky 
night-vision footage of the offending mink, 
helped boost Mr. Gold’s YouTube audience 
toward the 100,000-viewer threshold. And it 
helped him understand his own place in the 
universe of farmer-influencers, which tilts 
heavily toward the how-to genre. 
‘‘The storytelling part is what I’m good 
at,’’ he said. ‘‘I’m not that good at the farm-
ing part.’’ It is a paradox that the less finan-
cially viable small farming becomes, the 
more that Americans want to experience it 
firsthand. 
This idea is as old as the dude ranch; video 
streaming of farm life is only the most re-
cent iteration. Amy Fewell, the founder of 
Homesteaders of America, said the number 
of farmers who earn substantial income off 
YouTube channels is steadily climbing, and 
now stands at around 50. Some of them earn 
money through product endorsement deals, 
like Al Lumnah, who posts videos five days 
a week from his farm in Littleton, N.H. 
It’s a lot of work: Mr. Lumnah wakes up at 
3:30 a.m. so he can edit the previous day’s 
footage in time to post new video at 6 a.m., 
which his 210,000 regular viewers, who are 
scattered as far as Cambodia and India, have 
come to expect. ‘‘People will say, it’s lunch-
time here in Ukraine,’’ Mr. Lumnah said. 
Others, like Justin Rhodes, a farmer in 
North Carolina, have parlayed a giant 
YouTube audience into a dues-paying mem-
bership enterprise—he has 2,000 fans who pay 
annual fees of up to $249 for private instruc-
tion and direct communication, via text 
message. ‘‘We don’t sell a single farm prod-
uct,’’ Mr. Rhodes said. ‘‘Our farm product is 
education and entertainment.’’ 
Mr. Gold, who moved to Vermont and 
started his YouTube channel four years ago, 
has not reached that point. He still has a 
full-time job, as a marketing executive for 
an insurance company, and so far has refused 
the endorsement deals. He has built up his 
flocks of chicken, geese and ducks to 100, and 
is hoping to add cows next spring. 
He’s certainly captured the interest of the 
farmers who surround him in Peacham, said 
Tom Galinat, a neighbor whose family farms 
550 acres. 
Farmers here struggle to eke out a living 
from a rocky, uneven soil and hostile cli-
mate, and they are astounded—in some cases 
a little jealous—to discover that Mr. Gold is 
internet famous, he said. 
‘‘He’s found a way to way to monetize 
farming with less physical labor,’’ Mr. 
Galinat said. ‘‘Some guys are like, this is 
silly, since he’s farming 20 ducks. But at the 
same time, he’s making more than other 
farmers who have 500 acres of land.’’ 
But Mr. Galinat, who is also Peacham’s 
town clerk, counts himself among a younger 
generation of farmers who are learning from 
Mr. Gold. 
‘‘He has taught me I am no longer selling 
hay, I am selling a lifestyle,’’ he said. ‘‘He’s 
really selling himself—his emotions, his 
opinions, his downfalls, his successes. Boom! 
That’s it, that’s the way forward.’’ 
As Mr. Gold’s audience has grown, he has 
at times been taken aback by the enthu-
siasm. 
Several dozen viewers have driven all the 
way to Peacham and knocked on his door, 
hoping to buy eggs or talk about ducks, 
something his wife described as ‘‘really dis-
tressing.’’ ‘‘Morgan is so vulnerable on film,’’ 
she said, ‘‘that people assume they know us 
as people.’’ 
Most of it is nice, though. Viewers send 
handcrafted accessories for his outbuildings, 
like a plaque that says, in elaborate let-
tering, ‘‘Ye Olde Quack House.’’ When one of 
the Golds’ barn cats was hit by a car re-
cently, at least 50 viewers offered cash to 
cover her medical bills. 
Samier Elrasoul, a nursing student in How-
ell, Mich., is so devoted to Mr. Gold’s videos 
that he got a vanity license plate reading 
QUACKN, in honor of the catchphrase—‘‘Re-
lease the Quacken!’’—that Mr. Gold exclaims 
when he frees his ducks from their hutch in 
the morning. 
Mr. Elrasoul, 34, says the videos inspire 
him because he, too, has a dead-end job—he 
works as a supervisor at Starbucks—and he, 
too, harbors a dream of changing his life. 
‘‘Seeing some guy just like me, just drop-
ping everything and doing what he’s pas-
sionate about, was very encouraging to see,’’ 
he said. ‘‘I’m like, wow, he’s living his 
dream.’’ 
For others, Mr. Gold’s farm has provided a 
haven in a difficult time. Charlotte Schmoll, 
who is 6 and lives in Portland, Ore., spent 
days at the beginning of lockdown watching 
Mr. Gold’s videos over and over. She an-
nounced last month that she, too, plans to 
raise ducks in Vermont. 
‘‘One of the questions that comes up when 
we watch shows is, ‘Is this real? Did this hap-
pen?’ ’’ said her mother, Julie Schmoll. 
‘‘That’s one of the things she liked about Mr. 
Rogers, and maybe she likes about the duck 
farmer, that he is also quote-unquote true, 
or real.’’ 
Mr. Gold does wonder, sometimes, about 
what it means, in the long term, to make his 
life into a story. When the cat was hit by a 
car, he found himself reflexively converting 
the event into a script, and stopped to ask 
himself who he was becoming. 
‘‘It’s like, how much is the experience and 
how much is the packaging of the experi-
ence, and how do you distinguish between 
the two,’’ he said. ‘‘Because you almost go, ‘I 
had a duck die, let me think about the first 
act here, and the second act.’ ’’ 
And still, the show goes on. Late on a re-
cent evening, Mr. Gold was putting finishing 
touches on a video about his dog, Toby, who 
has never quite grown into his intended role 
as a duck herder. 
Early drafts of the video had focused on 
how much the dog had improved. 
But there was something dishonest about 
that, Mr. Gold realized that evening, as he 
and Ms. Gold flung themselves around the 
paddock, trying to catch birds with string 
nets, while the dog looked on placidly, 
thumping his tail. 
Now, in the gathering dark, Mr. Gold was 
rewriting the ending to one that emphasized 
his acceptance of the dog’s true nature. 
It’s always difficult to bring closure to a 
video, Ms. Gold said. It was almost 9 o’clock, 
and she was hoping to go inside. 
‘‘You have to create an end,’’ she said. ‘‘Be-
cause the truth is, we do this every day, so 
there’s not really an end.’’ 
But Mr. Gold, for his part, was pleased. 
‘‘I love it when a story has a good moral,’’ 
he said. 
BUDGET ENFORCEMENT LEVELS 
FOR FISCAL YEAR 2021 
Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, section 251 
of the Balanced Budget and Emergency 
Deficit Control Act of 1985, BBEDCA, 
establishes statutory limits on discre-
tionary spending and allows for various 
adjustments to those limits. In addi-
tion, sections 302 and 314(a) of the Con-
gressional Budget Act of 1974 allow the 
Chairman of the Budget Committee to 
establish and make revisions to alloca-
tions, aggregates, and levels consistent 
with those adjustments. 
The Senate will soon consider H.R. 
8337, the Continuing Appropriations 
Act, 2021 and Other Extensions Act. 
This measure includes two provisions, 
found in sections 126 and 163, that are 
designated as being for emergency pur-
poses pursuant to section 251(b)(2)(A)(i) 
of BBEDCA. The Congressional Budget 
Office estimates that these provisions 
will have no net effect on budget au-
thority but would result in $92 million 
in outlays in fiscal year 2021. 
As a result of the emergency designa-
tions, I am revising the outlay alloca-
tion to the Committee on Appropria-
tions by $92 million in fiscal year 2021. 
Further, I am increasing the budgetary 
outlay aggregate for fiscal year 2021 by 
equivalent amounts. 
I ask unanimous consent that the ac-
companying tables, which provide de-
tails about the adjustment, be printed 
in the RECORD. 
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the 
RECORD, as follows:

NATIONAL DEFENSE 
AUTHORIZATION ACT 
Ms. CORTEZ MASTO. Mr. President, 
I rise to enter into a colloquy with the 
junior Senator from Nevada, regarding 
sections 2861 and 2862 of title XXVIII of 
the National Defense Authorization 
Act that was recently considered by 
the Senate. These two sections of the 
bill include complex, intertwined his-
tory of public lands, Nevada’s cultures 
and economy, Native American Tribes, 
and the Silver State’s proud role in 
hosting and training our men and 
women in uniform. 
Ms. ROSEN. Mr. President, I thank 
the senior Senator from Nevada for 
joining me today for this colloquy. The 
Senator correctly notes that these two 
sections of the National Defense Au-
thorization Act raise profound histor-
ical public policy questions about how 
to protect our public lands, recognize 
the voices and issues raised by Native 
American Tribes, local governments 
and concerned citizens, and maintain 
Nevada’s proud role in support of our 
Nation’s Armed Forces and our na-
tional security. These public policy 
questions are amongst the most con-
sequential natural resource issues fac-
ing the Silver State and have prompted 
Nevadans from every corner of our 
State to engage on the best path for-
ward. 
Ms. CORTEZ MASTO. Mr. President, 
I thank the junior Senator from Ne-
vada for her partnership on these im-
portant questions. This year’s annual 
defense authorization bill is more than 
1,000 pages long, but sections 2861 and 
2862 together take up less than one 
page. As the Senator knows, while the 
legislative text seems quite simple, sig-
nificant and historical public policy 
questions underpin these two sections 
of the bill. 
Section 2861 provides for a 20-year ex-
tension of the public land withdrawals 
specific to Fallon Range Training Com-
plex which is utilized by the U.S. Navy. 
Section 2862 provides for a similar 20- 
year extension of the public land with-
drawals specific to the Nevada Test and 
Training Range, otherwise known as 
NTTR, which is utilized by the U.S. Air 
Force. The reality of what this legisla-
tion means to our constituents in Ne-
vada, our Nation’s public lands, and its 
potential impact for current and future 
generations is far more complex. Given 
the importance of the public lands, Na-
tive American Tribes, Nevada’s culture 
and economy, and our Nation’s mili-
tary, can the junior Senator from Ne-
vada provide more detail on that his-
tory with respect to NTTR? 
Ms. ROSEN. Mr. President, to best 
answer the Senator’s question, it is im-
portant to start with the history of the 
Desert National Wildlife Refuge. The 
establishment of the Desert National 
Wildlife Refuge predates the Nevada 
Test and Training Range and was cre-
ated by President Franklin Roosevelt 
on May 20, 1936, via Executive Order 
7373. 
FDR created the Desert Game Range, 
as it was known then, to provide habi-
tat and protection for desert bighorn 
sheep, Nevada’s State animal. Origi-
nally the Range totaled more than 2.25 
million acres, including lands both 
north and south of U.S. Highway 95. 
We know even more today about the 
value of this area. The Desert National 
Wildlife Refuge contains six mountain 
ranges and seven distinct life zones, 
with elevations ranging from 2,200 feet 
to nearly 10,000 feet. The variations in 
elevation and rainfall have created di-
verse habitats, necessary for its hun-
dreds of species of native flora and 
fauna to live and flourish. There are 
currently two species listed as endan-
gered 
or 
threatened: 
notably 
the 
Pahrump Poolfish and the Desert Tor-
toise. This area was under the joint ad-
ministration of the Bureau of Fish-
eries, the predecessor to the Fish and 
Wildlife Service—USFWS—which was 
not created until 1940, and the Bureau 
of Land Management—BLM. 
Today, the Desert National Wildlife 
Refuge is the largest wildlife refuge 
outside Alaska. The Refuge has gone 
through various legislative boundary 
adjustments 
and 
currently 
encom-
passes 1.615 million acres of the Mojave 
Desert. Public Land Order 4079, issued 
on August 26, 1966, and corrected on 
September 23, 1966, revoked EO 7373. 
This PLO changed the name to the 
Desert National Wildlife Range, re-
duced its size to 1.588 million acres, and 
transferred sole administration to the 
USFWS. Lands withdrawn in PLO 4079 
were set aside specifically for the pro-
tection, 
enhancement, 
and 
mainte-
nance of wildlife resources, including 
bighorn sheep. Then, in 1974, as part of 
a Wilderness review required by the 
Wilderness Act of 1964, 1.3 million acres 
of the Desert National Wildlife Refuge 
were 
proposed 
as 
Wilderness 
by 
USFWS. This history is important, but 
these lands also remain central to Na-
tive American Tribes in Nevada. 
Could the senior Senator from Ne-
vada expand upon their importance? 
Ms. CORTEZ MASTO. Mr. President, 
I thank the junior Senator for her 
question and would begin by noting 
that the mountains of southern Nevada 
are sacred lands, where Native Ameri-
cans carved their stories onto its 
mountains and cliffs and left artifacts 
which 
detail 
how 
they 
lived 
and 
thrived. The bighorn sheep which are 
central to this area are sacred to Ne-
vada’s Native American Tribes, includ-
ing the Moapa Band of Paiutes, who 
are among the most acutely impacted 
by these public policy questions raised 
by Senator ROSEN. The creation story 
told by the Moapa Band of Paiutes in-
clude references to bighorn sheep, and 
the Las Vegas Paiutes also regard the 
Desert National Wildlife Refuge as cul-
turally significant. With the history of 
the Refuge properly established, can 
my colleague, a former member of the 
House Armed Services Committee, help 
provide history on NTTR? 
Ms. ROSEN. Mr. President, the his-
tory of NTTR begins in the 1940s when 
it was known as the Las Vegas Bomb-
ing and Gunnery Range, later changed 
to the Nellis Air Force Range in Octo-
ber 1987, and finally to NTTR in August 
2003. 
The NTTR is a military training area 
consisting of approximately 2.9 million 
acres of Federal land used by the U.S. 
Air Force Warfare Center at Nellis Air 
Force Base in southern Nevada. The 
NTTR includes a ‘‘simulated Inte-
grated Air Defense System’’ and sev-
eral individual ranges with 12,000 tar-
gets. The NTTR area has been used for 
aerial gunnery and bombing, nuclear 
tests, as a proving ground and flight 
test area, and for aircraft control and 
warning exercises. 
These 2.9 million acres have been 
withdrawn from public use and re-
served for military use, including the 
approximately 842,254 acres of the 
Desert National Wildlife Refuge land 
that overlaps with the NTTR. The leg-
islative history surrounding this his-
tory begins in 1940, with Executive 
Order 8578 giving the military joint ad-
ministration with USFWS of the west-
ern half of the Desert National Wildlife 
Refuge, for war purposes and restrict-
ing public access. The NTTR land with-
drawals were extended in 1962, with the 
issuance of PLO 2613, and in 1986, the 
withdrawals were extended for another 
15 years with P.L. 99–606. Most re-
cently, the withdrawals, were again ex-
tended through 2021, with P.L. 106–65 
signed in 1999. 
This law in 1999, included as part of 
the National Defense Authorization 
Act for Fiscal Year 2000—P.L. 106–65— 
transferred 
primary 
jurisdiction 
of 
110,000 acres of bombing impact areas 
on the Desert National Wildlife Refuge 
from the USFWS to the Department of 
Defense. These lands were reserved for 
use by the Secretary of the Air Force 
as an armament and high hazard test-
ing area; for training for aerial gun-
nery, rocketry, electronic warfare, and 
tactical maneuvering and air support; 
and for equipment and tactics develop-
ment and testing. 
More recently, in 2014, the House of 
Representatives considered legislation, 
H.R. 4253, which proposed repealing the 
existing withdrawals found in section

3015 in P.L. 106–65. Furthermore, the 
legislation would have permanently 
transferred administrative jurisdiction 
of the withdrawn lands in Nevada and 
put them under control of the Air 
Force. This same provision was again 
included in the 2015 NDAA, H.R. 1735, 
which was ultimately vetoed by Presi-
dent Obama. In 2018, the House of Rep-
resentatives included provisions which 
would have again attempted to repeal 
the existing withdrawals found in Sec-
tion 3015 in P.L. 106–65 and perma-
nently transferred administrative ju-
risdiction of the withdrawn lands to 
the Air Force. 
With that history established, can 
Senator Cortez Masto provide the his-
tory behind the legislation that is still 
under consideration by the Congress? 
Ms. CORTEZ MASTO. Mr. President, 
I appreciate that question, because the 
process by which we find ourselves con-
sidering this legislation began on Au-
gust 25, 2016, when the Air Force pub-
lished a notice in the Federal Register 
to notify the public that it would begin 
preparing a legislative environmental 
impact statement related to the NTTR. 
This process, pursuant to the National 
Environmental Policy Act, kicked off 
public, Native American, and govern-
ment agency engagement on any po-
tential expansion of the NTTR. 
The outreach and scoping process on 
the proposed update to the legislative 
environmental impact statement was 
flawed from the beginning. For in-
stance, in a letter dated March 8, 2018, 
Nevada’s 
former 
Governor 
Brian 
Sandoval, a Republican, wrote to the 
Air Force that ‘‘during the preparation 
of the legislative environmental im-
pact statement, there was little inter-
action with our state agencies’’ and 
that ‘‘better coordination with the Ne-
vada Department of Wildlife would 
have led to a more complete analysis 
and an opportunity to develop a com-
promise alternative that would both 
enhance training opportunities for the 
Air Force and continue to provide es-
sential protections for Nevada’s wild-
life and outdoor recreational experi-
ences.’’ Unfortunately, the process for 
incorporating concerns expressed with 
the Air Force’s plans for the NTTR 
have not improved over time. All told, 
more than 30,000 comments were sub-
mitted to the Air Force during their 
consideration of the legislative envi-
ronmental impact statement, but these 
concerns were largely ignored by the 
Air Force and left unaddressed in the 
final documents released by the Air 
Force in October 2018. 
The issue was considered by the 80th 
session 
of 
the 
Nevada 
Legislature 
which, on a nearly unanimous basis, 
passed Assembly Joint Resolution 2— 
AJR 2. AJR2 strongly urged Congress 
to ‘‘reject any proposal by the United 
States Air Force to expand its use of 
land or exercise of jurisdiction within 
the Desert National Wildlife Refuge be-
yond that which it currently possesses 
and to limit any proposal to extend the 
Air Force’s authority over the Nevada 
Test and Training Range to not more 
than 20 years.’’ The legislature further 
urged 
Congress 
‘‘to 
work 
collabo-
ratively with all interested parties to 
develop a compromise alternative that 
would both enhance training opportu-
nities for the United States Air Force 
and continue to provide essential pro-
tections for Nevada’s wildlife and out-
door recreational experiences for Ne-
vadans and visitors.’’ 
The inability for the legislative envi-
ronmental impact statement to yield a 
consensus, compromise proposal was a 
major factor in my decision to begin 
developing my own legislation on this 
subject with my colleagues in the Ne-
vada congressional delegation. My goal 
was to find a solution that would allow 
the Air Force to modernize its training 
while also respecting and preserving 
one of the country’s largest wildlife 
refuges. This process included exten-
sive discussions and engagement with 
Nevada stakeholders including Tribal 
communities, conservationists, sports-
men and hunters, private landowners, 
the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, and 
the United States Air Force. 
Among other items, our legislation, 
S. 3145, firmly establishes public access 
to the Desert National Wildlife Refuge, 
provides that the U.S. Fish and Wild-
life Service maintain primary jurisdic-
tion over the entirety of the Refuge, 
preserves Fish and Wildlife Service ju-
risdiction on Refuge lands east of the 
historic Alamo/Old Corn Creek Road, 
creates several Wilderness areas, and 
establishes an interagency committee 
for resolving management conflicts be-
tween the U.S. Air Force and U.S. Fish 
and Wildlife Service. It also allows for 
the Air Force, in consultation with the 
Department of the Interior, to place up 
to 15 threat emitters to maximize and 
enhance realistic pilot training, pro-
vides a buffer zone west of the historic 
Alamo/Old Corn Creed Road, and pro-
vides a modest expansion of the NTTR 
to facilitate increased training activity 
on an additional 86,000 acres. 
Ms. ROSEN. Mr. President, I thank 
the senior Senator for her comprehen-
sive answer. As I have previously stat-
ed, I am hopeful this bipartisan com-
promise legislation will help resolve 
land management conflicts, preserve 
public access to the Desert National 
Wildlife Refuge, and serve to strength-
en our national security. I have met 
with environmental advocates, Tribal 
leaders, and Air Force senior leader-
ship on this issue. I will continue work-
ing with our local stakeholders—in-
cluding 
military 
leaders, 
environ-
mental and wildlife advocates, and 
members of Nevada’s Tribal commu-
nities—to make sure all voices are 
heard. 
Ms. CORTEZ MASTO. Mr. President, 
I appreciate the Senator’s partnership 
on this matter and share the Senator’s 
commitment to ensuring an effective 
answer to the previously noted public 
policy questions. While the National 
Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal 
Year 2021 that was approved by the 
Senate on July 23, 2020, does not ad-
dress the breadth of issues covered in 
our legislation, I hope it will provide 
an impetus for continued engagement 
so that we can build momentum within 
Congress, the Department of Defense, 
the Department of the Interior, and in 
Nevada for our bill. I will, and I am 
sure I speak for my colleagues in the 
Nevada delegation on this matter, com-
mit to work with any and all reason-
able parties on this matter. I hope that 
we can solve this matter with an eye 
towards its history in Nevada, our 
commitment 
to 
Native 
American 
Tribes, our precious public lands, our 
men and women in uniform, and our 
national security. 
In addition, I would like to recognize 
Congressman HORSFORD and the other 
members of the Nevada congressional 
delegation for their efforts in the 
House to ensure that impacted Ne-
vadan stakeholders will be properly en-
gaged and have a voice in the manage-
ment and of the Federal lands on which 
the Air Force operates in southern Ne-
vada. His efforts will help guarantee 
improved decision making and collabo-
ration amongst the U.S. Fish and Wild-
life Service and the U.S. Air Force as it 
pertains to the joint use of the Nevada 
Test and Training Range and Desert 
National Wildlife Refuge. I welcome his 
contributions in a final product ap-
proved by the full Congress. 
Would the junior Senator also care to 
comment on section 2861? 
Ms. ROSEN. Mr. President, I thank 
the Senator. As previously noted, sec-
tion 2861 provides for a 20-year exten-
sion of the public land withdrawals spe-
cific to the Fallon Range Training 
Complex which is utilized by the U.S. 
Navy. Just like with section 2862, while 
this provision of the bill before us 
seems relatively simple, the underlying 
issues presented by the Fallon Range 
Training Complex present a range of 
complicated issues centered upon pub-
lic lands, sovereign Tribal governments 
in Nevada and environmental justice, 
public access and recreation, energy 
and transportation infrastructure, and 
the ability for future economic devel-
opment. 
Could the senior Senator from Ne-
vada provide more detail on some of 
this underlying history which helps 
make section 2861 so important to our 
constituents? 
Ms. CORTEZ MASTO. Mr. President, 
I thank the junior Senator for the 
question. To begin, as before, it is im-
portant to understand the larger his-
tory in this area of Nevada before one 
can reasonably understand the mag-
nitude of historical issues at play. 
The military’s history in Fallon 
dates back to 1942 when the Civil Avia-
tion Administration and Army Corps of 
Aviation began construction of an air-
field as part of the Western Defense 
Program. The Navy assumed control in 
1943, and the following year, Naval 
Auxiliary Air Station Fallon was com-
missioned. In the early 1950s, addi-
tional training ranges were established

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S5862 
September 24, 2020 
under Public Land Order 898 which 
withdrew 56,011 acres of public land for 
military use. In 1986—P.L. 99–606—and 
1999—P.L. 106–65—Congress enacted leg-
islation on this general subject by 
withdrawing additional public lands for 
military activities. The law passed in 
1999 was especially noteworthy. This 
law represented a major change to the 
local customs, culture, and economy 
because it withdrew approximately 
201,933 acres of land for military use for 
20 years. The Fallon Range Training 
Complex now encompasses more than 
230,000 acres of public land because of 
numerous map revisions and land sur-
veys by the BLM since 1999. These land 
withdrawals, which took effect on No-
vember 6, 2001, expire on November 5, 
2021, absent congressional reauthoriza-
tion. 
While this history is important, it is 
also important to understand that the 
history in this area did not begin when 
the military became an integral part of 
the community. One such example is 
the Walker River Paiute Tribe, a feder-
ally recognized sovereign nation. One 
range, Bravo 19, of the larger Fallon 
Range Training Complex, is located di-
rectly adjacent to WRPT reservation 
land and the Navy, as far back as 1942, 
has conducted military testing and 
training on lands adjacent to the 
WRPT reservation. The National Con-
gress of American Indians—NCAI—go 
into more detail on the close physical 
proximity between these entities in 
Resolution No. ECWS–19004. The NCAI 
notes that the Walker River Paiute 
reservation land is ‘‘south and adjacent 
to Bravo 19, which is one of the train-
ing areas for Naval Air Station (NAS) 
Fallon’’ and that the ‘‘Navy has en-
cumbered tribal land (est. 6,000 acres), 
which has been contaminated with live 
ordinance, caused historical damage to 
range wells and facilities and has left 
such land useless as this land cannot be 
totally cleaned up of ordinance and 
bombs.’’ 
The Fallon Paiute-Shoshone Tribe 
has an equally important mark on the 
history of this unique area in northern 
Nevada. As detailed by the Inter-Tribal 
Council of Nevada in Resolution 06– 
ITCN–19, the Fallon Paiute-Shoshone 
Tribe is federally recognized and have 
lived, hunted, and prayed on their an-
cestral lands which encompass many 
significant areas in this region of the 
Silver State. This has resulted in a 
range of issues for the Fallon Paiute- 
Shoshone Tribe, including, but not lim-
ited to, access to traditional lands, in-
cluding spiritual and cultural sites. 
These impacts are not trivial to the 
Fallon Paiute-Shoshone Tribe, but it 
should be noted that the current Chair-
man of the Fallon Paiute-Shoshone 
Tribe, Len George, published a piece in 
their March 2020 Tribal newsletter ex-
pressing his support for reauthoriza-
tion of the existing withdrawn lands, 
but not for the expansion as proposed 
by the Navy 
The 
broader 
community 
in 
and 
around NAS Fallon also has a long his-
tory with this military base. Churchill 
County and the city of Fallon are the 
proud home of NAS Fallon, and both 
want to remain the proud home of NAS 
Fallon. That being said, this military 
base and training range is only one 
part of a larger community which each 
have to work together to balance its 
activities on public land against a 
range of other interrelated activities 
such as agriculture, clean energy devel-
opment, hunting, outdoor recreation, 
and mining. 
Given these factors, it is easy to un-
derstand the amount of attention the 
Department of Navy received in August 
of 2016 when it published its notice in 
the Federal Register that it was initi-
ating its process under the National 
Environmental Policy Act to ‘‘assess 
the 
potential 
environmental 
con-
sequences of maintaining and modern-
izing the Fallon Range Training Com-
plex (FRTC) in Nevada, which would 
include land range expansion through 
additional land withdrawal and land 
acquisition, 
airspace 
modifications, 
and public land withdrawal renewal.’’ 
Scoping meetings drew hundreds of 
attendees, and the Navy’s Draft Envi-
ronmental Impact Statement resulted 
in the submission of nearly 1,500 unique 
comments. Unfortunately, the robust 
scoping meetings and good-faith efforts 
to work together ultimately has not 
fully resolved some of the fundamental 
issues with the Navy’s proposal. The 
shortcomings of this process have been 
apparent and was captured in 2018 by 
our former and our current Governor in 
letters sent to the Navy in December 
2018 and November 2019. Since then, the 
Navy has undertaken a serious effort 
to understand local concerns through a 
series 
of 
ongoing 
discussions 
and 
pledged commitments. 
The National Environmental Policy 
Act process was subsequently com-
pleted in March of 2020 with a signed 
Record of Decision from the Navy. The 
Navy’s ROD proposes an expansion that 
includes approximately 600,000 acres of 
public land and approximately 66,000 
acres of private land located primarily 
in Churchill County, but affecting a 
total of five counties. When consid-
ering 
associated 
airspace 
modifica-
tions, the Navy’s proposal will affect 
over half of all Nevada counties. While 
affected counties, Tribes, and State 
agencies worked with the Navy to iden-
tify key assurances in the ROD, which 
reflected the Navy’s serious engage-
ment, the ROD could not and did not 
alleviate all concerns. 
Shortly before the Navy made their 
decision in March of 2020, Senator 
ROSEN, Congressman HORSFORD, and I 
wrote a letter to the Senate and House 
Armed Services Committees where we 
noted that the lack of consensus left us 
with ‘‘no choice other than to initiate 
our own process to gather input from 
as many of our constituents as pos-
sible.’’ 
With regards to both sections of the 
National Defense Authorization Act, 
we continue to seek that consensus, 
and I would note in particular that 
Governor Sisolak and his administra-
tion have been helpful with this effort, 
especially in working with affected 
counties and the Nevada Association of 
Counties to bring State agencies, local 
governments, and Tribes together. I 
would also like to acknowledge the ef-
forts of Churchill County which also 
worked with the State and the afore-
mentioned stakeholders to collabo-
ratively compile a list of outstanding 
concerns and suggested means of ad-
dressing 
those 
concerns 
with 
the 
Navy’s proposal. The combined efforts 
from stakeholders in our State has 
been an invaluable resource. 
In the meantime, I appreciate that 
this bill does not attempt to force a so-
lution upon the Silver State which has 
virtually no support from my constitu-
ents. Rather, by authorizing new 20- 
year extensions of the public land with-
drawals, it removes uncertainty by re-
inforcing the critical mission of the 
U.S. military in Nevada and its efforts 
to modernize while enabling Federal, 
State, local, and Tribal stakeholders to 
continue their dialogue to find the 
right way forward. 
Ms. ROSEN. Mr. President, I thank 
the Senator for her leadership on this 
matter and share her commitment to 
working together with our constitu-
ents in Nevada to reach a consensus 
proposal. While critical concerns re-
main, Nevada’s congressional delega-
tion has a long history of finding prag-
matic solutions to public land chal-
lenges, and I look forward to working 
with Senator CORTEZ MASTO, Congress-
man AMODEI, and the rest of the dele-
gation to continue this tradition. 
Ms. CORTEZ MASTO. Mr. President, 
I thank the Senator for her partner-
ship.

STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED 
BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTION 
By Mrs. FEINSTEIN: 
S. 4683. A bill to designate the Battle-
ship IOWA Museum, located in Los An-
geles, California, as the National Mu-
seum of the Surface Navy, and for 
other purposes; to the Committee on 
Energy and Natural Resources. 
Ms.FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise 
to speak in support of the ‘‘Battleship 
Iowa National Museum of the Surface 
Navy Act of 2020,’’ which I introduced 
today. 
This simple bill would designate the 
Battleship USS Iowa Museum located 
in Los Angeles, California as the ‘‘Na-
tional Museum of the Surface Navy.’’ 
The Battleship USS Iowa Museum 
would be the official museum to honor 
the millions of Americans who have 
proudly served and continue to serve in 
the United States Surface Navy since 
the founding of the Navy on October 13, 
1775. 
The Battleship USS Iowa is an iconic 
ship that served as a home to hundreds 
of thousands of sailors from all 50 
States. Commissioned in 1943, the Bat-
tleship Iowa has received accolades as 
the ‘‘World’s Greatest Navy Ship’’ and 
had several namesakes including the 
‘‘Mighty I’’ and the ‘‘Big Stick,’’ which 
referred to President Teddy Roosevelt’s 
famous adage: ‘‘Speak softly and carry 
a big stick.’’ 
The USS Iowa was also known as the 
‘‘Battleship of Presidents.’’ In 1943, 
President Franklin D. Roosevelt used 
the ship for meetings with British 
Prime Minister Winston Churchill and 
Soviet Premier Joseph Stalin. Presi-
dent George H.W. Bush re-commis-
sioned the USS Iowa in 1984 while serv-
ing as Vice President of the United 
States. Prior to the USS Iowa’s decom-
missioning in 1990, President Ronald 
Reagan used the ship for our Nation’s 
Celebration of Liberty in New York 
City on July 4, 1986. 
The USS Iowa earned nine battle 
stars for service in World War II and 
two for service during the Korean War. 
The ship was also awarded the Navy 
Meritorious Unit Commendation, the 
Navy Occupation Service Medal, the 
Armed Forces Expeditionary Medal, 
and the Navy ‘‘E’’ Ribbon—four times. 
In 2012, the Navy donated the Battle-
ship Iowa to the Pacific Battleship 
Center, which established the Battle-
ship USS Iowa Museum at the Port of 
Los Angeles. Since its opening, the Mu-
seum has welcomed millions of visi-
tors. 
The Museum also hosts numerous 
military activities including enlist-
ments, 
re-enlistments, 
commissionings, promotions, and com-
munity service days. The museum also 
provides on-site training for Federal, 
State, and local law enforcement per-
sonnel. 
Due to the coronavirus pandemic, the 
museum has closed all of its indoor ex-
hibits and has struggled to attract visi-
tors. As a non-profit organization the 
museum is supported solely by admis-
sions, donations, event space rentals, 
and the gift shops. 
How the bill would help: Our bill 
would designate the USS Battleship 
Iowa Museum as the ‘‘National Mu-
seum of the Surface Navy’’ to raise 
awareness and educate the public on 
the important role of the United States 
Surface Navy. 
The ‘‘National Museum of the Sur-
face Navy’’ would build on the success 
of the Battleship USS Iowa Museum by 
introducing new exhibits and programs 
with a focus on education, veterans, 
and community. 
Conclusion: It is imperative that we 
preserve the legacy of those who have 
served on the Battleship USS Iowa and 
all Surface Navy ships. I hope my col-
leagues will join me in support of this 
bill. Thank you Mr. President. I yield 
the floor. 
By Mr. ENZI (for himself and Mr. 
BARRASSO): 
S. 4684. A bill to designate the facil-
ity of the United States Postal Service 
located at 440 Arapahoe Street in 
Thermopolis, Wyoming, as the ‘‘Robert 
L. Brown Post Office’’; to the Com-
mittee on Homeland Security and Gov-
ernmental Affairs. 
Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I come to 
the floor today to be introduce a bill to 
honor the late Robert L. Brown of 
Thermopolis, WY. 
Robert Brown was a lifelong resident 
of Thermopolis, WY, and he exempli-
fied Wyoming’s values and a commit-
ment to public service. 
After graduating from Thermopolis 
High School, Bob was inducted into the 
Army in 1944, and he served in both the 
Europe and Pacific theaters. Later, in 
1950, when he was part of the National 
Guard, Bob deployed to Korea, where 
he was a member of the 300th Armored 
Field Artillery Battalion. 
He served in World War II, in both 
theaters, and then in Korea. The 
United States was poorly prepared for 
Korea, downsizing the military after 
the Second World War. The National 
Guard responded with little or no 
training or equipment. 
Bob Brown went to another war. He 
earned a Unit Citation. He received the 
Combat Infantry Badge and the Purple 
Heart. 
Upon returning to Thermopolis, Bob 
began a career with the U.S. Postal 
Service. That career spanned 44 years, 
including many years as postmaster. I 
hope John will tell more of the postal 
love affair and how Bob Brown met and 
courted the person who picked up the 
mail. That lady later became my first 
Sunday school teacher. 
Bob passed away earlier this month. 
At 94 years of age, he did have some 
health issues, but he had a devoted 
daughter, Bobbi Brown Barrasso, wife 
of Senator BARRASSO, who had been 
Senator Thomas’ State director. She 
was her dad’s caregiver. She took care 
of 
him 
in 
Casper 
as 
well 
as 
Thermopolis. She drove him back and 
forth wherever he wanted or needed to 
go, which meant especially back and 
forth to needed clinics with doctors in 
Thermopolis 
and 
in 
Casper. 
When 
COVID happened, she stayed with him 
and protected him. 
Bob Brown will be sorely missed in 
his community, and I can think of no

better way to honor someone with such 
a long and storied career with the U.S. 
Postal Service, as well as with the peo-
ple of Thermopolis, than to introduce 
this bill to name the Thermopolis post 
office after him. 
That historic building holds the 
memories of a veteran who came home 
to work and spent his entire career in 
that building, winding up as post-
master. 
The lead Democratic cosponsor of 
this bipartisan bill is Senator TOM 
CARPER, who is the strongest advocate 
I know of for the U.S. Postal Service. 
Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I want 
to thank my colleague Senator ENZI 
for allowing me to be his wingman on 
this particular postal naming bill. 
I never met Robert Brown. I cer-
tainly know his daughter Bobbi, and I 
certainly know his son-in-law, JOHN 
BARRASSO, my colleague. 
Just listening to what Senator ENZI 
has said—service in World War II, serv-
ice in the Korean war, service in the 
U.S. Postal Service—that is a lifetime 
of service. That is a lifetime of service. 
In my own family, my dad and my 
uncles all served in World War II, a 
number in Korea as well, and a cousin 
in the U.S. Postal Service for many 
years. I like to say—I know this isn’t 
original to me—that service to others 
is the rent we pay for the space we 
take up on this Earth. Think about 
that. Service to others is the rent we 
pay for the space we take up on this 
Earth. 
I would say to Robert L. Brown, if 
you are listening—I think you probably 
are—thank you for your extraordinary 
service, and thank you for Bobbi. And 
we ought to thank Bobbi, your daugh-
ter, Mr. BROWN, for sharing your hus-
band with us. He is a good man. It is a 
good package, and we are grateful for 
that. 
None of us can live forever. Senator 
BARRASSO
was telling me—gosh—not 
even a month ago about driving his fa-
ther-in-law I think it was 400 miles or 
something from Wyoming up to maybe 
Montana for medical care, medical at-
tention. I thought: What an extraor-
dinary act of love and kindness. I don’t 
think his death was imminent at the 
time, but it was a great opportunity, I 
bet, for the two of them to just renew 
and bond one more time. 
It is sad to say good-bye. None of us 
can live forever, though, and for those 
who lived lives of service like Bobbi’s 
dad, we just say this, especially in 
Navy talk—I am a retired Navy cap-
tain, Vietnam veteran. In the Navy, we 
like to say of folks in the Army: Dif-
ferent uniform, same team. 
When folks do extraordinary things 
in service to our country, whether it is 
in uniform of the Army or whether it is 
in uniform of the Navy or the Postal 
Service, we say Bravo Zulu. Bravo 
Zulu. 
Thank you for allowing me to join 
you. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Wyoming. 
Mr. BARRASSO. First, Mr. Presi-
dent, I would like to express my deep 
appreciation, admiration, and respect 
to both Senator ENZI and Senator CAR-
PER for introducing this legislation to 
honor Bob Brown. There he is. This is 
actually a picture of us. I am next to 
him. 
When you look at that smile, that is 
a smile that is as beautiful as the sun-
rise, as welcoming as a rainbow. What 
a wonderful man. 
He 
was 
known 
by 
many 
in 
Thermopolis as Bob Brown, the nicest 
guy in town. It was his hometown, and 
it stayed with him from high school— 
1943. 
This Greatest Generation, Mike and 
Tom, as veterans—having worn the 
uniform, borne the battle—know that 
we are losing the Greatest Generation 
so rapidly. What a generation—World 
War II, the European theater, the Pa-
cific theater, returning home, working 
in the post office. 
As Senator ENZI said, he was a postal 
clerk. There was a young lady, Jeralyn, 
who worked at the local bank, and she 
would come every day to pick up the 
mail. She caught his eye, he caught her 
eye, and they lived and married and 
were together for 70 years—70 years. 
They had two wonderful children— 
Mike Brown and my wife, Bobbi—and a 
granddaughter, who really was the 
apple of their eye, Hadley. 
But this group—World War II and 
Korea, as the Senators both men-
tioned—in the Korean war, Bob was 
part of the 300th, the Cowboy Cannon-
eers, an incredible unit—Unit Bravery 
Citation. He was awarded the Purple 
Heart. He never talked about it. He was 
very humble. 
He returned to Thermopolis, just 
took care of people in the community, 
to the point of serving as postmaster 
for many of his 44 years at the post of-
fice. People knew him, loved him, and 
admired him. 
I know that Mike had a chance to 
talk to the postmaster in Thermopolis 
yesterday about what we were going to 
do. She had actually known Bob, as 
anyone in town had, and was very 
grateful for having known him. 
Last year Bob and Jerry celebrated 
their 70th wedding anniversary. We lost 
Jerry this spring, and on 9/11 we lost 
Bob. He passed away at the age of 94. 
He was surrounded by his loving fam-
ily. And his daughter Bobbi truly is, as 
Senator ENZI said, the caregiver. I say 
she is a saint. People who know her 
know that to be true. 
As we talk about this Greatest Gen-
eration, of which Bob was a very sig-
nificant part, we can think back to the 
history of this country. 
Mr. President, in the Chair, you are a 
marine, and you know this. It reminds 
me of the speech that Abraham Lincoln 
gave during his first year as President 
in the White House. On the Fourth of 
July, there was a flag-raising cere-
mony, and he gave a very short speech. 
The speech that Lincoln gave that day 
was: It is my job to raise the flag. And 
then to everyone else there, he said: 
And it is your job to keep it up. 
Like you, Mr. President; you, Sen-
ator ENZI; you, Senator CARPER—Bob 
Brown was one to keep it up. 
Since we have bipartisan cosponsors 
and sponsors of this legislation, let me 
then talk about JOHN KENNEDY, who at 
his inaugural talked about this Nation 
being willing to pay any price, bear 
any burden, meet any hardship, sup-
port any friend, and oppose any foe. 
That is Bob Brown, all-American. 
Ronald Reagan talked about the fact 
that freedom is never more than one 
generation away from extinction. It is 
not something that we inherited in the 
bloodstream. It is something that has 
to be fought for, protected, defended, 
and then handed down to the next gen-
eration to do the same. And that is Bob 
Brown. 
This year is Wyoming’s 130th birth-
day, turned 130 this summer. So, 30 
years ago, we celebrated the 100th an-
niversary of Wyoming, and George Her-
bert Walker Bush, then-President of 
the United States, came to Wyoming to 
talk about Wyoming and its history. 
He said: Wyoming is a very special and 
sacred place. And he said: The values 
and divisions of Wyoming continue to 
inspire America. 
Bob Brown’s values and his vision 
continue to inspire everyone who was 
ever privileged to know him. May he 
rest in peace. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Delaware. 
Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I want 
to add one thought. I was about to run 
and jump in my minivan and head to 
Delaware. The thought occurred to me, 
your father-in-law served all those 
years in uniform with the Army and 
then many more years in uniform with 
the Postal Service. 
I want to say to the men and women 
who serve in the Postal Service today, 
around the country and, literally, 
around the world—to the men and 
women who are serving in uniform, the 
Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, 
Coast Guard—I just want to say to the 
Postal Service, thank you for enabling 
our men and women in service, in uni-
form, who are serving around the 
world, to actually vote this year. 
When I was a naval flight officer in 
Southeast Asia during my first and 
third tour, I was in a P–3 squadron, and 
we did service surveillance for engineer 
aircraft—land base, South China Sea, 
the Gulf of Thailand, and off the coast 
of Vietnam. I was asked by my com-
manding officer to be the voting offi-
cer—and not once but in 1970 and again 
in 1972. We had 300 men. We had no 
women in our squadron then. But my 
job was to get 300 men signed up, reg-
istered to vote in their States—and 
they are from all over the country— 
and I did the same thing again in 1972. 
It was a source of great joy to me to 
know that we were able to exercise our 
right to vote on the other side of the 
world and made possible by the Postal 
Service.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S5869 
September 24, 2020 
That thought occurred because your 
dad has been both on the sending and 
receiving side as a member of the Army 
and at the Postal Service. 
May he rest in peace. God bless. 
By Mrs. FEINSTEIN: 
S. 4703. A bill to amend the West Los 
Angeles Leasing Act of 2016 to author-
ize the use of certain funds received 
pursuant to leases entered into under 
such Act, and for other purposes; to the 
Committee on Veterans’ Affairs. 
Mr. President, I rise to speak in sup-
port of the ‘‘West Los Angeles VA Cam-
pus Improvement Act,’’ which I intro-
duced today. Representative TED LIEU 
(D–CA) has introduced similar legisla-
tion in the House. 
In 1888, the 388-acre parcel that is 
now home to the West Los Angeles VA 
Medical Center was deeded to the Fed-
eral government by Arcadia Bandini de 
Stearns Baker and Senator John P. 
Jones, to establish a home for disabled 
Veterans (civil war Veterans, at the 
time). 
For nearly a century, the land served 
primarily to house Veterans, and the 
campus long represented the largest 
Veteran housing development in the 
nation. In the early 1970s, 2,800 Vet-
erans living on the West LA VA cam-
pus were displaced when the Sylmar 
Earthquake caused major damage on 
campus. Rather than repair the hous-
ing units, the VA eventually leased 
portions of the property to non-VA ten-
ants. 
In 2011, homeless Veterans and advo-
cates sued the VA for illegally leasing 
facilities on campus and failing to use 
the property to support Veterans, as 
required by the original deed. 
A U.S. District Court subsequently 
ruled that many leases on campus were 
illegal under the terms of the original 
deed, and in 2015, the VA agreed to fa-
cilitate the development of 1,200 hous-
ing units for homeless Veterans on 
campus. 
In 2016, Congress enacted the ‘‘West 
Los Angeles Leasing Act of 2016’’ to set 
up an oversight framework for the 
housing development and to ensure 
that 
lease 
revenues 
from 
ongoing 
leases stayed on campus. 
In 2018, the VA selected a ‘‘Principal 
Developer’’ to complete housing ren-
ovation and construction projects on 
campus, allowing for a more stream-
lined and efficient building process. 
However, the VA has determined that 
current law restricts it from contrib-
uting to housing construction, mainte-
nance, or services. The VA has deter-
mined that clarifying language is need-
ed to ensure that funds generated on 
campus can be used for these purposes. 
Giving VA the flexibility to use lo-
cally-generated revenue in this way 
could significantly reduce the time it 
takes to get homeless Veterans into 
housing. 
The West LA VA Campus Improve-
ment Act authorizes the VA to use any 
funds collected pursuant to leases, 
easements or other use-agreements at 
the West LA VA for the development of 
supportive housing and services on 
campus. 
The bill would also increase the time 
period for enhanced use leases on the 
campus from 75 to 99 years. Increasing 
the length of the leases would align 
with other leasing terms the VA has, 
and help reduce the financing costs for 
new housing. 
This year, the regional homelessness 
count reported that more than 3,900 
Veterans are experiencing homeless-
ness in Los Angeles. It is long past 
time for this land to be returned to its 
intended purpose: to serve as a home 
where Veterans can receive the care 
and treatment they deserve. This bill 
will help move us closer to that re-
ality. 
I hope my colleagues will join me in 
support of this bill. Thank you, Mr. 
President, and I yield the floor.

(C) EFFECTIVE

(18) DEADLINES WITH RESPECT TO NOTICES.— 
Notwithstanding section 518 of the Employee 
Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (29 
U.S.C. 1148) and section 7508A of the Internal 
Revenue Code of 1986, the Secretary of Labor 
and the Secretary of the Treasury, respec-
tively, may not waive or extend any deadline 
with respect to the provision of notices de-
scribed in paragraphs (7), (8), and (9). 
(b) RULE OF CONSTRUCTION.—In all matters 
of interpretation, rules, and operational pro-
cedures, the language of this section shall be 
interpreted broadly for the benefit of work-
ers and their families. 
By Mrs. FEINSTEIN (for herself 
and Mr. MENENDEZ): 
S. 4718. A bill to amend title 18, 
United States Code, to make fraudu-
lent dealings in firearms and ammuni-
tion unlawful, and for other purposes; 
to the Committee on the Judiciary. 
Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I 
rise today to introduce legislation to 
stop the fraudulent sales of guns on-
line. While some technology companies 
have banned selling of firearms and 
ammunition on their websites, the 
problem persists. 
For example, Facebook banned sell-
ing firearms. Nonetheless, between last 
April and June, it reportedly still had 
to remove 1.3 million pieces of content 
from 
its 
website 
that 
violated 
Facebook’s terms of service related to 
gun sales. 
In order to circumvent the terms of 
service, sellers are using new tactics, 
like misrepresenting guns as ‘‘stick-
ers,’’ to get around these restrictions. 
An August 24, Wall Street Journal ar-
ticle explored how gun sellers are spe-
cifically using this new tactic on 
Facebook’s Marketplace. 
According to the article, sellers are 
using ‘‘a new tactic [that] involves 
posts purporting to sell stickers, along-
side images of gun makers’ logos.’’ 
However, when contacted, these sell-
ers admitted that they’re actually sell-
ing guns. 
Even more troubling, the article said 
the recent ‘‘boom’’ in Americans buy-
ing guns ‘‘has been attributed to the 
new coronavirus pandemic, civil unrest 
related to the killing of George Floyd 
and efforts in some cities to defund the 
police.’’ 
As a result, there has been a recent 
spike in failed background checks. 
Politico reported in July that: ‘‘The 
number of people trying to buy guns 
who can’t legally own them has sky-
rocketed.’’ 
For example, in February, the back-
ground check system blocked 9,700 
sales. 
In March, the system blocked 23,692 
gun sales—more than double the pre-
vious month and the previous March. 
The bill I’m introducing today ad-
dresses this problem by making it ille-
gal for gun sellers to circumvent 
websites’ terms of service as yet an-
other way to avoid a background 
check. 
It would make it a Federal crime to 
sell guns on websites like Facebook 
‘‘by means of false or fraudulent pre-
tenses, representations of promises.’’ 
Doing so would be a felony with a max-
imum of five years in prison and a 
$250,000 fine. 
I also want to thank Senator MENEN-
DEZ for joining with me to introduce 
this legislation. 
His efforts to keep technology com-
panies accountable for the prolifera-
tion of firearms on their platforms has 
been vital in addressing the problem. 
Our bill today is part of a larger ef-
fort that needs to be taken to stop the 
plague of gun violence hurting this 
country. 
But I hope others will join us in this 
commonsense effort. 
Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the 
floor. 
By Ms. HIRONO (for herself, Mr. 
BOOKER, Mr. BLUMENTHAL, Ms. 
KLOBUCHAR, Ms. WARREN, and 
Mr. REED): 
S. 4732. A bill to conduct a study on 
the 
spread 
of 
COVID–19-related 
disinformation and misinformation on 
the internet and social media plat-
forms, and for other purposes; to the 
Committee 
on 
Health, 
Education, 
Labor, and Pensions. 
Ms. HIRONO. Mr. President, I rise 
today 
to 
introduce 
the 
COVID–19 
Disinformation Research and Report-
ing Act. I thank Representative JEN-
NIFER WEXTON for working with me on 
this important piece of legislation, 
which will help shine a light on the 
ways social media and other online 
platforms amplify and spread misin-
formation and disinformation about 
the coronavirus pandemic to the det-
riment of public health. 
Representative WEXTON was able to 
get the substance of this bill included 
in the HEROES Act, a bill passed four 
months ago by the House of Represent-
atives to provide much needed relief to 
those suffering from the coronavirus 
pandemic and accompanying economic 
downturn. Because the Senate failed in 
its duty to pass the HEROES Act, I am 
introducing 
the 
COVID–19 
Disinformation Research and Report-
ing Act with my colleagues—Senators 
BOOKER, 
BLUMENTHAL, 
KLOBUCHAR, 
WARREN, and REED. 
As I stand here today nearly 7 mil-
lion Americans have been diagnosed 
with COVID–19 and over 200,000 have 
died from the virus. 
The numbers alone are staggering. 
But when you hear and read the per-
sonal stories of individuals and fami-
lies who are suffering, it is truly trag-
ic. It makes you mournful that for 
many of the individuals who died, they 
died alone in the absence of their loved 
ones. 
While many things contributed to 
this massive loss of life, I am here to 
talk about one in particular: the insid-
ious spread of coronavirus-related mis-
information and disinformation online. 
This ‘‘infodemic’’ has undercut the ef-
forts of public health officials at every 
turn, and threatens to prolong the 
virus’s impact on the health of our peo-
ple and economy long after a safe and 
effective vaccine is available. 
The online spread of misinformation 
about public health is nothing new. 
Claims that the 2014 Ebola epidemic 
was a form of population control 
spread across social media. Anti-vac-
cination groups have long used Face 
book and YouTube to share junk 
science and recruit new members. 
However, social media platforms’ re-
sponse to coronavirus was supposed to 
be different. Early in the pandemic, the 
major 
social 
media 
platforms 
an-
nounced new measures to combat mis-
information while making sure users 
had access to accurate, authoritative 
information about the virus. Facebook 
added a COVID–19 Information Center 
to the tops of users’ News Feeds and 
announced it would remove misin-
formation that could contribute to im-
minent physical harm. Twitter verified 
accounts that provided credible up-
dates on the pandemic and committed 
to removing false or misleading con-
tent 
that 
contradicted 
information 
from 
health 
authorities. 
YouTube 
began directing users who searched for 
COVID-related information to the WHO 
or other health authorities and banned 
false information contradicting health 
authorities on treatment, prevention, 
diagnosis, or transmission of COVID– 
19. 
Unfortunately, 
these 
measures 
proved lacking and insufficient. The 
conspiracy film Plandemic was viewed 
more than 8 million times across social 
media platforms, and the sequel was 
viewed over 100,000 times on YouTube 
during its first week alone. A study by 
advocacy group Avaaz found that mis-
information about vaccines and other 
health topics had been viewed an esti-
mated 3.8 billion times on Facebook in 
the past year—four times more than 
factual, authoritative content from in-
stitutions like the WHO and CDC. The 
study also found that only 16% of pre-
viously 
fact-checked 
health 
misin-
formation on Facebook carried a warn-
ing label. 
Spend even a small amount of time 
on the internet or social media and you 
will find rampant misinformation and 
conspiracy theories about COVID–19. 
Some examples of these falsehoods in-
clude: Bill Gates created the virus to 
use a vaccine as cover to implant 
microchips into Americans. No, actu-
ally, Dr. Fauci created the coronavirus

to seize political power. You shouldn’t 
wear a mask to protect against the 
coronavirus, because wearing a mask 
actually weakens your immune sys-
tem. And do not worry if you catch the 
corona virus—you can treat it by 
drinking bleach. 
These claims might seem ridiculous, 
but they have real word consequences. 
A study published in the American 
Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hy-
giene found that 5,800 people had been 
hospitalized and at least 800 people died 
in the first three months of this year 
alone as a direct result of coronavirus- 
related misinformation. As recently as 
August, the Georgia Department of 
Health and the Texas Poison Control 
Center had to warn people not to drink 
bleach to treat COVID. While more 
Americans regularly wear masks in 
public, a recent poll found that 15% 
still do not. And, perhaps must trou-
bling, polls suggest that between 35% 
and 50% of the U.S. population will not 
get a COVID vaccine when it is ap-
proved. 
If 
we 
hope 
to 
get 
past 
the 
coronavirus and avoid similar public 
health crises in the future, we must un-
derstand where misinformation origi-
nates, how it spreads, and strategies to 
stop it. 
This is exactly what the COVID–19 
Disinformation Research and Report-
ing Act will do. It directs the National 
Science Foundation to partner with 
the National Academies of Sciences, 
Engineering, and Medicine to conduct a 
study on the spread of COVID–19-re-
lated disinformation and misinforma-
tion on the internet and social media 
platforms. This study will provide crit-
ical 
information 
on 
the 
roles 
disinformation 
and 
misinformation 
have played in the public response to 
COVID–19; the sources of COVID–19–re-
lated disinformation and misinforma-
tion and the ways it has influenced the 
public debate; the role social media 
plays in the disseminating and pro-
moting this disinformation and misin-
formation; and potential strategies for 
combatting 
misinformation 
and 
disinformation in the future. 
This information will not stop the 
next pandemic from coming. And, it 
will not force the next Administration 
to take it seriously and follow the ad-
vice of doctors and scientists. But it 
can give us the knowledge and tools 
necessary to avoid another infodemic 
and ensure the American public re-
ceives accurate and authoritative in-
formation when it is most needed. 
I therefore encourage my colleagues 
to 
support 
the 
COVID–19 
Disinformation Research and Report-
ing Act.

mitted the following resolution; which 
was considered and agreed to: 
S. RES. 715 
Whereas the United States was founded on 
principles of religious freedom by the Found-
ers, many of whom were deeply religious; 
Whereas the First Amendment to the Con-
stitution of the United States embodies prin-
ciples intended to guarantee freedom of reli-
gion both through the free exercise thereof 
and by prohibiting the Government from es-
tablishing a religion; 
Whereas the Pledge of Allegiance was writ-
ten by Francis Bellamy, a Baptist Minister, 
and first published in the September 8, 1892, 
issue of the Youth’s Companion; 
Whereas, in 1954, Congress added the words 
‘‘under God’’ to the Pledge of Allegiance; 
Whereas, for over 60 years, the Pledge of 
Allegiance has included references to the 
United States flag, to the country having 
been established as a union ‘‘under God’’, 
and to the country being dedicated to secur-
ing ‘‘liberty and justice for all’’; 
Whereas, in 1954, Congress believed it was 
acting constitutionally when it revised the 
Pledge of Allegiance; 
Whereas the Senate of the 116th Congress 
believes that the Pledge of Allegiance is a 
constitutional expression of patriotism; 
Whereas patriotic songs, engravings on 
United States legal tender, and engravings 
on Federal buildings also contain general 
references to ‘‘God’’; 
Whereas the Supreme Court overturned 
Newdow v. United States Congress, 328 F.3d 
466 (9th Cir. 2003), a case in which the United 
States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit 
held that the recitation of the Pledge of Al-
legiance by a student’s public school teacher 
violated the Establishment Clause of the 
First Amendment to the Constitution of the 
United States; and 
Whereas the United States Court of Ap-
peals for the Ninth Circuit later concluded 
that its previous opinion in Newdow was no 
longer binding precedent, that case law from 
the Supreme Court of the United States con-
cerning the Establishment Clause of the 
First Amendment to the Constitution of the 
United States had subsequently changed, and 
that Congress, when passing the new version 
of the Pledge of Allegiance, established a 
secular purpose for the use of the terms 
‘‘under God’’ and, thus, the United States 
Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit 
upheld the recitation of the Pledge of Alle-
giance by public school teachers: Now, there-
fore, be it 
Resolved, That— 
(1) the Pledge of Allegiance has been a val-
uable part of life for the people of the United 
States for generations; and 
(2) the Senate strongly defends the con-
stitutionality of the Pledge of Allegiance.

tion; which was referred to the Com-
mittee on the Judiciary: 
S. RES. 716 
Whereas malnutrition is the condition that 
occurs when a person does not get enough 
protein, calories, or nutrients; 
Whereas the 2020 Coronavirus Disease 2019 
(COVID–19) pandemic (referred to in this pre-
amble as the ‘‘2020 coronavirus pandemic’’)— 
(1) has resulted in a significant increase in 
food insecurity, which is linked to malnutri-
tion; and 
(2) has nearly doubled food insufficiency 
rates since 2019; 
Whereas the 2020 coronavirus pandemic has 
had a disproportionate impact on children, 
as 13,900,000 children live in a household 
characterized by child food insufficiency, 
and the rate of households with food insuffi-
cient children in 2020 was more than 5 times 
the rate of households with food insufficient 
children in 2019; 
Whereas the impact of the 2020 coronavirus 
pandemic on the chronically ill has forced 
the examination of chronic disease preven-
tion, especially through nutrient consump-
tion and absorption, which is examined in 
the 2020–2030 Strategic Plan for NIH Nutri-
tion Research published by the National In-
stitutes of Health; 
Whereas malnutrition is a significant prob-
lem in the United States and around the 
world, crossing all age, racial, class, gender, 
and geographic lines; 
Whereas infants, older adults, people with 
chronic diseases, and other vulnerable popu-
lations are particularly at risk for malnutri-
tion; 
Whereas the American Academy of Pediat-
rics has found that failure to provide key nu-
trients during early childhood may result in 
lifelong deficits in brain function; 
Whereas disease-associated malnutrition 
affects between 30 and 50 percent of patients 
admitted to hospitals, and the medical costs 
of hospitalized patients with malnutrition 
can be 300 percent more than the medical 
costs of properly nourished patients; 
Whereas, according to the National Blue-
print: Achieving Quality Malnutrition Care 
for Older Adults, 2020 Update, as many as 1⁄2 
of older adults living in the community are 
malnourished or at risk for malnutrition; 
Whereas disease-associated malnutrition 
in older adults alone costs the United States 
more than $51,300,000,000 each year; and 
Whereas the American Society for Paren-
teral and Enteral Nutrition established Mal-
nutrition Awareness Week to raise aware-
ness and promote prevention of malnutrition 
across the lifespan: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) designates the week of October 5 
through October 9, 2020, as ‘‘Malnutrition 
Awareness Week’’; 
(2) recognizes registered dietitian nutri-
tionists and other nutrition professionals, 
health care providers, social workers, advo-
cates, caregivers, and other professionals and 
agencies for their efforts to advance aware-
ness, treatment, and prevention of malnutri-
tion; 
(3)(A) recognizes the importance of exist-
ing Federal nutrition programs for their role 
in combating malnutrition; and 
(B) supports emergency funding for those 
critical Federal nutrition programs for the 
duration of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 
(COVID–19) pandemic; 
(4) recognizes—

Ms. WARREN (for herself and Mrs. 
HYDE-SMITH) submitted the following 
resolution; which was referred to the 
Committee 
on 
Health, 
Education, 
Labor, and Pensions: 
S. RES. 717 
Whereas ataxia is a clinical manifestation 
indicating degeneration or dysfunction of 
the brain that negatively affects the coordi-
nation, precision, and accurate timing of 
physical movements; 
Whereas ataxia can strike individuals of 
all ages, including children; 
Whereas the term ‘‘ataxia’’ is used to clas-
sify 
a 
group 
of 
rare, 
inherited 
neurodegenerative diseases including— 
(1) ataxia telangiectasia; 
(2) episodic ataxia; 
(3) Friedreich’s ataxia; and 
(4) spinocerebellar ataxia; 
Whereas there are many known types of 
genetic ataxia, but the genetic basis for 
ataxia in some patients is still unknown; 
Whereas all inherited ataxias affect fewer 
than 200,000 individuals and, therefore, are 
recognized as rare diseases under the Orphan 
Drug Act (Public Law 97–414; 96 Stat. 2049); 
Whereas some genetic ataxias are inher-
ited in an autosomal dominant manner, 
while others are inherited in an autosomal 
recessive manner; 
Whereas ataxia symptoms can also be 
caused by noninherited health conditions 
and other factors, including stroke, tumor, 
cerebral palsy, head trauma, multiple scle-
rosis, alcohol abuse, and certain medica-
tions; 
Whereas ataxia can present physical, psy-
chological, and financial challenges for pa-
tients and their families; 
Whereas symptoms and outcomes of ataxia 
progress at different rates and include— 
(1) lack of coordination; 
(2) slurred speech; 
(3) cardiomyopathy; 
(4) scoliosis; 
(5) eye movement abnormalities; 
(6) difficulty walking; 
(7) tremors; 
(8) trouble eating and swallowing; 
(9) difficulties with other activities that 
require fine motor skills; and 
(10) death; 
Whereas most patients with ataxia require 
the use of assistive devices, such as wheel-
chairs and walkers, to aid in their mobility, 
and many individuals may need physical and 
occupational therapy; 
Whereas there is no treatment or cure ap-
proved by the Food and Drug Administration 
for ataxia; and 
Whereas clinical research to develop safe 
and effective treatments for ataxia is ongo-
ing: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) recognizes the need for greater public 
awareness of ataxia; 
(2) expresses support for the designation of 
September 25, 2020, as ‘‘National Ataxia 
Awareness Day’’; 
(3) supports the goals of National Ataxia 
Awareness Day, which are— 
(A) to raise awareness of the causes and 
symptoms of ataxia among the general pub-
lic and health care professionals; 
(B) to improve diagnosis of ataxia and ac-
cess to care for patients affected by ataxia; 
and 
(C) to accelerate ataxia research, including 
on safe and effective treatment options and, 
ultimately, a cure; 
(4) acknowledges the challenges facing in-
dividuals in the United States who have 
ataxia and the families of those individuals; 
and 
(5) encourages States, territories, and lo-
calities to support the goals of National 
Ataxia Awareness Day.

Whereas our domestic tranquility, national 
security, general welfare, and civil liberties

NATING THE WEEK BEGINNING 
OCTOBER 18, 2020, AS ‘‘NATIONAL 
CHARACTER COUNTS WEEK’’ 
Mr. GRASSLEY (for himself, Ms. 
STABENOW, Mr. ALEXANDER, Mr. ENZI, 
Mr. LANKFORD, Mr. BRAUN, Mrs. BLACK-
BURN, and Mrs. CAPITO) submitted the 
following resolution; which was consid-
ered and agreed to: 
S. RES. 721 
Whereas the well-being of the United 
States requires that the young people of the 
United States become an involved, caring 
citizenry of good character; 
Whereas the character education of chil-
dren has become more urgent, as violence by 
and against youth increasingly threatens the 
physical and psychological well-being of the 
people of the United States; 
Whereas, more than ever, children need 
strong and constructive guidance from their 
families and their communities, including 
from schools, youth organizations, religious 
institutions, and civic groups; 
Whereas the character of a nation is only 
as strong as the character of its individual 
citizens; 
Whereas the public good is advanced when 
young individuals are taught the importance 
of good character and the positive effects 
that good character can have in personal re-
lationships, in school, and in the workplace; 
Whereas scholars and educators agree that 
individuals do not automatically develop 
good character and that, therefore, institu-
tions and individuals that influence youth 
must make conscientious efforts to help 
young individuals develop the essential 
traits and characteristics that comprise good 
character; 
Whereas, although character development 
is, first and foremost, an obligation of fami-
lies, 
the 
efforts 
of 
faith 
communities, 
schools, and youth, civic, and human service 
organizations also play an important role in 
fostering and promoting good character; 
Whereas Congress encourages students, 
teachers, parents, youth, and community 
leaders to recognize the importance of char-
acter education in preparing young individ-
uals to play a role in determining the future 
of the United States; 
Whereas effective character education is 
based on core ethical values, which form the 
foundation of a democratic society; 
Whereas examples of character are trust-
worthiness, respect, responsibility, fairness, 
caring, citizenship, and honesty; 
Whereas elements of character transcend 
cultural, religious, and socioeconomic dif-
ferences; 
Whereas the character and conduct of 
youth reflect the character and conduct of 
society, and, therefore, every adult has the 
responsibility to teach and model ethical 
values and every social institution has the 
responsibility to promote the development of 
good character; 
Whereas Congress encourages individuals 
and organizations, especially those that have 
an interest in the education and training of 
the young individuals in the United States, 
to adopt the elements of character as intrin-
sic to the well-being of individuals, commu-
nities, and society; 
Whereas many schools in the United States 
recognize the need, and have taken steps, to 
integrate the values of their communities 
into teaching activities; and 
Whereas the establishment of ‘‘National 
Character Counts Week’’, during which indi-
viduals, families, schools, youth organiza-
tions, religious institutions, civic groups, 
and other organizations focus on character 
education, is of great benefit to the United 
States: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) designates the week beginning October 
18, 2020, as ‘‘National Character Counts 
Week’’; and 
(2) calls upon the people of the United 
States and interested groups— 
(A) to embrace the elements of character 
identified by local schools and communities, 
such as trustworthiness, respect, responsi-
bility, fairness, caring, and citizenship; and 
(B) to observe National Character Counts 
Week with appropriate ceremonies, pro-
grams, and activities.

eration of innocent individuals falsely ac-
cused of crimes in the United States; 
Whereas forensic science service providers 
address critical questions in civil and crimi-
nal investigations and trials in the United 
States, including by providing scientific con-
clusions relating to forensic evidence; 
Whereas forensic science service providers 
partner with— 
(1) Federal agencies to build and maintain 
criminal databases relating to latent prints, 
DNA, and other information relevant to 
criminal cases; and 
(2) Federal, State, and local agencies to en-
sure public safety; 
Whereas forensic science service providers 
serve a vital role in the criminal justice sys-
tem by providing scientific information to 
investigators and officers of the court; and

September 24, 2020 
IN MEMORY OF ROSLYN (LYNNE) 
HOTLZMAN NIERENBERG 
HON. JAIME HERRERA BEUTLER 
OF WASHINGTON 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, September 24, 2020 
Ms. HERRERA BEUTLER. Madam Speak-
er, Roslyn (Lynne) Holtzman Nierenberg died 
on August 25, 2020 after a long decline. She 
and her identical twin sister Sara (Sue) were 
born at home 2 months early on November 
18, 1928. Dr. Richardson, who delivered them, 
visited daily for months until he was sure they 
would survive. Their father, Aaron Holtzman, 
came to America from Belarus in 1920. Their 
mother, Gertrude Lemonik Holtzman, was 
born on the lower East side. Her parents were 
from Ukraine. Lynne and Sue’s parents initially 
had a general store in Norwood, NJ. They 
later had a men’s shop in Bergenfield, NJ. 
Lynne and Sue went to the public schools in 
Bergenfield, NJ. They have two surviving 
younger sisters, Myra (Mikey) and Carol Ann 
(Candy), and one sister Cynthia, who died in 
infancy. Lynne and Sue graduated from New 
Jersey College for Women (NJC) at Rutgers 
University in New Brunswick, NJ in 1950. 
(NJC later became Douglass College.) 
Lynne met Theodore (Ted) Nierenberg in 
the summer of 1947 when they were coun-
selors at Lakeside Pines, a girls’ sleep away 
camp. This was after he served as an officer 
in the Navy in the South Pacific in World War 
II. They married in 1950 after Lynne graduated 
from college. They lived in Queens, NY ini-
tially, while Lynne did editorial work and Ted 
worked in the insurance industry. They bought 
their first house in Teaneck, NJ shortly before 
their first child, David, was born in 1953. They 
moved to a second house in Teaneck in 1960 
before their fourth child was born. Lynne spent 
many busy years raising four children, being a 
member of Temple Emeth, being an active 
member of many PTA’s, and doing volunteer 
work at Englewood Hospital. She was a won-
derful mother. She encouraged her children to 
read, study music, get involved in extra-
curricular activities, and do volunteer work. 
Lynne had always wanted to be a nurse. In 
1968, the first year that Englewood Hospital 
admitted older students, Lynne started nursing 
school. She graduated two years later, first in 
her class. Lynne initially worked as a psy-
chiatric nurse in the inpatient psychiatric unit 
at Englewood Hospital. She then worked at an 
outpatient mental health center in Dumont, 
now called Vantage Mental Health Care. She 
then taught psychiatric nursing at Holy Name 
School of Nursing. While at Holy Name, she 
earned a masters degree in counseling. She 
then became the psychiatric nursing super-
visor at Englewood Hospital. (The job also en-
tailed doing psychiatric continuing education 
for the nursing staff and serving as a liaison 
when patients with psychiatric problems need-
ed to be hospitalized on the medical or sur-
gical floors.) Lynne briefly worked in psy-
chiatric medication research at Montefiore 
Hospital in the Bronx, NY. Lynne then worked 
at the outpatient mental health center at 
Miseracordia Hospital (now Our Lady of 
Mercy), in the Bronx, NY. She functioned 
there like a psychiatric nurse-practitioner. This 
was her most challenging and satisfying job 
because it pulled together all of her skills. She 
retired in 1993. 
Lynne also did volunteer work. For about 13 
years, she ran a support group through the 
American Cancer Society’s Cancer Adjustment 
Program. She later ran the Survivors after Sui-
cide support group for about 13 years at Van-
tage Mental Health Care. She also ran a sup-
port group for women who had premature ba-
bies. 
She was the devoted mother of David 
Nierenberg (married to Patricia) of Camas, 
Washington; Susan Nierenberg (married to 
Peter Goldman) of Teaneck; Amy Knitzer 
(married to Jonathan Perlstein) of Montclair, 
NJ; and Ellen Nierenberg, currently living in 
Tromso, Norway. She LOVED being a grand-
mother to: David and Patricia’s children: 
Elodie, Jacob, and Albanie; Susan and Peter’s 
daughter Emily; Amy and Jonathan’s sons 
Dan and Zack; and Ellen and Jens’ children: 
Johanne, Solveig, and Daniel. 
Unfortunately, Lynne developed Alzheimer’s 
Disease. After Ted had a stroke in 2009, 
Lynne and Ted moved in 2010 into Van Dyk 
Park Place, an assisted living facility in Haw-
thorne, NJ. Ted died in 2011. 
Lynne is survived and missed by: her sisters 
Mikey and Candy, her children David, Susan, 
Amy, and Ellen, her 9 grandchildren, and 14 
nieces and nephews.

HONORING THE LIFE OF PATRICK 
BEAUREGARD 
HON. JAMIE RASKIN 
OF MARYLAND 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, September 24, 2020 
Mr. RASKIN. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to honor the extraordinary life of Patrick Beau-
regard, who passed away on September 6, 
2020 at the age of 29 after battling stage IV 
young-onset colorectal cancer. Patrick will be 
remembered as a compassionate, loyal and 
thoughtful man, and I had the good fortune of 
spending time with him during his grueling bat-
tle against the disease. 
Patrick was raised in Massachusetts and 
went to college in Rhode Island. Following his 
college graduation, he fulfilled his lifelong 
dream of serving in the military. He enlisted in 
the United States Marine Corps in April 2013 
and served as an Intelligence Analyst until he 
was honorably discharged in July 2019. 
Throughout his service, Patrick received com-
mendations for his exceptional leadership, ini-
tiative, loyalty and dedication to duty. 
During his grueling 40 rounds of treatment— 
something his Marine training helped him en-
dure—I had the honor of meeting with Patrick 
to discuss how Congress can contribute to the 
fight against colorectal cancer. He was pas-
sionate about advocating for greater research 
funds and generating national awareness 
about young-onset colorectal cancer. Although 
Patrick eventually lost his years long struggle 
with the disease, his advocacy work will con-
tinue to benefit and give hope to countless 
colorectal cancer patients and their families for 
years to come. 
Throughout his 3-year battle, Patrick re-
mained remarkably positive. Prior to his pass-
ing, Patrick was able to accomplish his final 
goal of meeting his son, Noah Patrick, born on 
July 10, 2020. Patrick is survived by his wife, 
Amanda, and by Noah. I ask my colleagues to 
join me in honoring the precious and irreplace-
able life of Patrick Beauregard. He will be 
missed dearly.

IN RECOGNITION OF THE 
CENTENNIAL OF PITNEY BOWES 
HON. ROBERT J. WITTMAN 
OF VIRGINIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, September 24, 2020 
Mr. WITTMAN. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today in recognition of the Centennial of 
Pitney Bowes. In 1920, Arthur Pitney and Wal-
ter Bowes put their ideas together to create a 
business, Pitney Bowes. 
Arthur being the inventor and Walter being 
the promoter, together they created the Pitney 
Bowes Postage Meter and it was officially ap-
proved on September 1st by Congress to be 
used by the United States Postal Service. 
Twenty years later during World War II, a 
Pitney Bowes plant in Connecticut was almost 
entirely ran by women. 
Following the war, nearly half of the men 
employed were World War II veterans. As the 
years passed, the company went on to further 
create inventions, boost productivity, drive pre-
cision, and decrease cost of mailing. Pitney 
Bowes is a living legacy of always innovating, 
adapting, and striving together to do better. 
Since day one, they founded Pitney Bowes 
on innovation and powering commerce, seek-
ing to do the right thing, the right way for cus-
tomers, their people, and the world around us. 
Today, one hundred years later, they still 
abide by the same values that they began on. 
Technology is ever changing and evolving, it 
is remarkable to see the Pitney Bowes com-
pany flourish within this industry. 
Therefore, Madam Speaker, I ask you to 
rise with me in celebration of the Centennial of 
Pitney Bowes. One hundred years is a monu-
mental milestone. I want to thank Pitney 
Bowes for their dedication, commitment, and 
services to the people of Virginia’s First Dis-
trict and to Americans across the nation.

HONORING 
CAPTAIN 
SCOTT 
T. 
FARR’S 
TWENTY-EIGHT 
YEARS 
OF SERVICE TO HIS COUNTRY IN 
THE UNITED STATES NAVY 
HON. JOE COURTNEY 
OF CONNECTICUT 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, September 24, 2020 
Mr. COURTNEY. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize and congratulate Navy 
Captain Scott ‘‘Topper’’ Farr for his twenty- 
eight years of faithful service to our country. 
In May of 1992, CAPT Farr was commis-
sioned as an Ensign and proceeded to Pensa-
cola, FL for flight training. After earning his 
gold wings, he flew both the EA–6B Prowler 
and EA–18G Growler jets operationally, prac-
ticing his specialty of electronic warfare. His 
responsibility was protecting U.S. and coalition 
aircraft from the threat of surface to air mis-
siles, as well as soldiers, Sailors, airmen and 
Marines on the ground from improvised explo-
sive devices. His dedicated service through 
eight deployments, 3,409 flight hours and 669 
carrier landings on eight different aircraft car-
riers was responsible for countless American 
and Allies’ lives saved during Operations 
Southern Watch, Allied Force, Enduring Free-
dom, Iraqi Freedom and Unified Protector. 
In addition to commanding Electronic Attack 
Squadron 140 and the Electronic Attack Wing, 
U.S. Pacific Fleet, his ultimate assignment 
was as the Director of the Navy’s House Liai-
son Office. In this job, he both represented the 
Navy to most House members and oversaw 
the numerous congressional and staff delega-
tion trips that we annually execute across the 
globe. These crucial trips are beneficial for 
members and staff to achieve a deeper under-
standing of the issues facing our Navy and its 
Sailors, as well as strategic issues facing our 
nation. It was on these CODELs that I came 
to know Topper for the good-natured and stal-
wart professional that he is. 
Two events that highlight Topper’s work 
ethic and professionalism immediately come to 
my mind. The first was an extremely success-
ful bi-partisan CODEL across Australia from 
Perth to Alice Springs to Sydney. Topper han-
dled all of the logistical and diplomatic tasks 
flawlessly in what the Australian embassy 
noted was the largest group of House and 
Senate members to visit Australia since World 
War II. Second was an anti-submarine fo-
cused CODEL of NATO countries. During both 
of these CODELs, it wasn’t CAPT Farr’s su-
perb planning or execution skills that most im-
pressed me and my colleagues. It was his 
ability to substantively answer questions from 
members on a wide range of military issues. 
This knowledge was no doubt based on his 
impressive record of service and simply stat-
ed, the U.S. House of Representatives and 
the Navy are better off due to his service. 
As CAPT Farr embarks on a new chapter in 
life, it is my hope that he may recall, with a 
deep sense of pride and accomplishment, the 
outstanding contributions he has made to the 
United States Navy while attached to the Of-
fice of Legislative Affairs. I would like to send 
him, his wife Melanie, daughter Kathleen and 
one of a kind dog Gracie, my very best wishes 
for continued success in his future. 
ONGOING 
TRANSATLANTIC 
EN-
GAGEMENT THROUGH THE OSCE 
PARLIAMENTARY ASSEMBLY 
HON. RICHARD HUDSON 
OF NORTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, September 24, 2020 
Mr. HUDSON. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to highlight my recent efforts to engage with 
our allies across Europe to address the cur-
rent political turmoil in Belarus and seek a way 
forward. 
On September 23, I joined a video call of 
the leadership of the Parliamentary Assembly 
of the Organization for Security and Coopera-
tion in Europe (OSCE PA), where I serve as 
Chairman the Committee on Political Affairs 
and Security. Joining us for the discussion 
were the Head of the Belarusian delegation to 
the OSCE PA, Mr. Andrei Savinykh, and the 
leader of the Belarusian opposition and former 
presidential 
candidate, 
Ms. 
Svetlana 
Tikhanovskaya. 
Ms. Tikhanovskaya shared with us the long 
struggle of the people of Belarus for their 
rights 
under 
President 
Alexander 
Lukashenko’s 26-year authoritarian rule. The 
fraudulent presidential election on August 9, in 
which Lukashenko claimed he ‘‘won’’ with over 
80 percent of the vote, led thousands of 
Belarusians across the country to come out 
into the streets. They risk physical harm and 
imprisonment to demand free and fair elec-
tions and the release of political prisoners. Un-
fortunately, these individuals have been met 
with brute force from the authoritarian regime. 
They continue to injure and detain protestors, 
journalists, and even bystanders on a massive 
scale. Instances of torture in detention have 
been reported, and some have been killed. 
Lukashenko is clearly afraid for his political fu-
ture. In another desperate move, he recently 
held an illegal, early ‘‘inauguration’’ in an at-
tempt to consolidate his illegitimate power. 
I strongly condemned Lukashenko’s violent 
repression of Belarusians and express soli-
darity for their desire to choose their own lead-
ership in a democratic and transparent man-
ner and to exercise their fundamental free-
doms without fear of violent repercussions or 
harassment. During our meeting, I noted two 
particular cases that we in the United States 
are watching closely. U.S. citizen Vitali 
Shkliarov, who was in Belarus visiting family, 
was unjustly detained in July and languishes 
in a Belarusian prison since the end of July. 
We are concerned for his welfare and I called 
for his release. 
I also mentioned that the Roman Catholic 
Archbishop 
of 
Minsk-Mogilev, 
Tadeusz 
Kondrusiewicz, has been denied re-entry to 
Belarus after a visit abroad, even though he is 
a citizen. He has openly criticized the govern-
ment’s use of violence against peaceful peo-
ple, including the detention of priests and cler-
gy, and we fear that this too is a political act 
on the part of Lukashenko and an infringe-
ment on religious freedom. 
The future of Belarus belongs to its people, 
and, as Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has 
emphasized, this path should be ‘‘free from 
external intervention.’’ Indeed, my colleagues 
in the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly under-
stand that it is not our place to choose the 
leadership of Belarus, but to use the unique 
role of the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly as 
a representative body to foster authentic dia-
logue, prevent and resolve conflict, and hold 
each other accountable. As an OSCE partici-
pating State, Belarus has an obligation to 
abide by the provisions of the Helsinki Final 
Act, including those on human rights and fun-
damental freedoms. I am pleased that 17 par-
ticipating States of the OSCE, including the 
United States, have invoked the Moscow 
Mechanism, which will establish a mission of 
independent experts to look into the particu-
larly serious threats to the fulfillment of human 
rights commitments in Belarus. The report that 
the mission issues will hopefully offer us great-
er insight into the situation in Belarus and rec-
ommendations for future actions. 
It is a privilege, through the U.S. Helsinki 
Commission, to represent the United States 
Congress in the Parliamentary Assembly of 
the OSCE. The Parliamentary Assembly pro-
vides Members of Congress with a unique, bi-
partisan opportunity to work with our friends 
and allies to help resolve pressing global 
issues while promoting our shared values. Be-
cause the Parliamentary Assembly includes 
representatives of Belarus and our European 
allies, it is uniquely suited to address the 
human rights and security implications of the 
moment in Belarus. 
Madam Speaker, please join me today in 
calling for an end to violence and mass deten-
tions in Belarus and recognizing the impor-
tance of continued Congressional engagement 
with the Parliamentary Assembly of the OSCE.

RECOGNIZING THE RETIREMENT 
OF BILL VERNER 
HON. AUSTIN SCOTT 
OF GEORGIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, September 24, 2020 
Mr. AUSTIN SCOTT of Georgia. Madam 
Speaker, today I rise in recognition of Bill 
Verner, Executive Vice President of the Geor-
gia EMC. After decades of dedicated service, 
Bill is retiring from his position at the Georgia 
EMC on the 40th anniversary of beginning his 
career in the electric cooperative industry. 
Bill began his career with Carroll EMC while 
working his way through college. He joined the 
Georgia EMC in 1984, began working in gov-
ernment relations in 1986, and was appointed 
to lead Georgia EMC’s efforts in the state leg-
islature and regulatory arena in 1996. 
His strong beliefs in the cooperative’s prin-
ciples are evident in his years of dedicated 
service representing EMC’s interests in the 
Georgia General Assembly, Congress, and 
state and federal agencies. Having worked 
with Bill personally, l have seen firsthand the 
level of expertise and commitment that has 
made him an invaluable asset to the coopera-
tive. His hard work, leadership, and deep un-
derstanding of America’s most successful pub-
lic-private partnership, the electric cooperative 
business model, has benefitted EMC members 
throughout Georgia. 
Bill’s career is marked by his many contribu-
tions to Georgia EMC and the 41 EMCs 
across the state. His tenure over the past four 
decades with Georgia EMC makes him one of 
the longest-serving employees in the associa-
tion’s eighty-year history. In today’s age, it is 
a rarity to find the combination of character, 
ability, and commitment that Bill exemplifies.

HONORING THE CAREER OF CAROL 
BRICK-TURIN 
HON. DEBBIE WASSERMAN SCHULTZ 
OF FLORIDA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, September 24, 2020 
Ms. 
WASSERMAN 
SCHULTZ. 
Madam 
Speaker, it is with great pleasure that I rise to 
recognize the remarkable career of Carol 
Brick-Turin. After 12 years, Ms. Brick-Turin is 
retiring as the Executive Director of the Great-
er Miami Jewish Federation’s Jewish Commu-
nity Relations Council. 
Carol originally moved to Washington, D.C. 
to join the U.S. Department of Agriculture, 
where she worked on public policy issues for 
more than a decade. A graduate of Cornell 
University with a Bachelor of Science degree 
in agricultural economics, she was recruited to 
join the Foreign Agricultural Service (FAS), 
and served as a diplomat in Brussels, Belgium 
in the U.S. Mission to the European Commu-
nity. She was the first married female to serve 
as an Agricultural Attache´ in the history of 
FAS. 
Carol attended the Foreign Service Institute, 
completed a study program taught by faculty 
of the Jewish Theological Seminary and at-
tended the University of Tel-Aviv in 1973— 
both before and after the Yom Kippur War. 
Having raised her children as Zionists, she 
now has three grandchildren who were born in 
Jerusalem, in addition to her two grand-
daughters in Miami. 
As the JCRC’s Executive Director Carol has 
adroitly mobilized and engaged Miami’s Jew-
ish community on many levels. She has led 
our citizen activists in building relationships 
with Members of Congress on both sides of 
the aisle, key to the success of the pro-Israel 
movement and the national agenda supported 
by the Jewish Council for Public Affairs. We 
have worked together to address a multitude 
of issues facing our community—from the 
scourge of anti-Semitism and senseless gun 
violence plaguing our schools and places of 
worship to ensuring we maintain our strong 
U.S.-Israel relationship. 
Carol’s commitment to Miami’s Jewish com-
munity and the state of Israel is exemplary, 
and I am proud to call her my very good 
friend. I will miss her guidance and wisdom, 
but our loss is her husband Alan and her fam-
ily’s gain. I wish her a hearty Mazel Tov on 
her retirement and am grateful for her invalu-
able work.

HONORING THE CITY OF FALLS 
CHURCH VIRGINIA 
HON. DONALD S. BEYER, JR. 
OF VIRGINIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, September 24, 2020 
Mr. BEYER. Madam Speaker, I rise today in 
honor of the City of Falls Church, Virginia. The 
City of Falls Church has recently been ranked 
the 3rd healthiest community in the United 
States in 2020 according to the U.S. News 
Healthiest Communities Report. 
Falls Church received nearly a perfect score 
for measurements including population health, 
education, and a perfect score for local econ-
omy—the highest score for economic health in 
the nation. 
Settled more than 300 years ago and situ-
ated less than 10 miles from the Capitol, Falls 
Church has had a front row seat to many of 
the nation’s most historic moments. Tradition 
holds that a copy of the Declaration of Inde-
pendence was read from the steps of The 
Falls Church, the city’s namesake, in 1776. 
Please join me in honoring the City of Falls 
Church for achieving such a monumental ac-
complishment.

MR. NAT O’DAY BIRTHDAY 
RECOGNITION 
HON. KAY GRANGER 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, September 24, 2020 
Ms. GRANGER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize Mr. Nat O’Day, a North 
Texan and military veteran, as he celebrates 
his 90th birthday on September 27, 2020. 
Nat spent 20 years of his life serving in the 
U.S. Army achieving the rank of Lieutenant 
Colonel. He served overseas in South Viet-
nam, Korea, Japan, and Germany. Nat played 
a pivotal role in the modernization of our na-
tion’s military as he operated a communica-
tions system at over 52 sites across the world 
and tested flight equipment that is now used 
as today’s standard. During his military serv-
ice, Nat married the love of his life, Lynn, and 
they enjoyed over 60 years of marriage to-
gether. They raised three wonderful children, 
Robin O’Day Dettmer, Steve Ray O’Day, and 
Tim James O’Day. 
Nat has dedicated his life to our nation and 
his community in Fort Worth, Texas. Following 
his retirement from the Army, Nat worked for 
the City of Fort Worth for over 25 years. He 
was a devoted volunteer, spending over 20 
years and thousands of hours volunteering at 
the Fort Worth Symphony, the Van Cliburn 
Foundation, and Bass Performance Hall, 
where he and Lynn shared their love of music. 
He also volunteered every Tuesday for 20 
years at the Dallas Fort Worth International 
Airport helping travelers navigate the airport. 
Nat also dedicated his time to the Cook Chil-
dren’s Hospital, where he was rightfully named 
Volunteer of the Year. Nat is committed to 
helping the people of 12th District of Texas, 
and his business cards that read ‘‘Volunteer 
Extraordinaire’’ sum up his dedication and de-
votion to North Texas. 
I had the great honor and pleasure of hav-
ing Nat as an advisor on military affairs and as 
the Chairman of my military academy nomina-
tion board. I could not have done it without 
Nat’s commitment and enthusiasm. I am 
grateful to know and celebrate Nat O’Day. Our 
Nation and my district wouldn’t be the same 
without his decades of selflessness and dedi-
cation. 
On behalf of the 12th District of Texas, I 
offer my congratulations and best wishes to 
Nat on his very special birthday. 
HONORING BARBARA TURK 
HON. H. MORGAN GRIFFITH 
OF VIRGINIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, September 24, 2020 
Mr. GRIFFITH. Madam Speaker, I rise in 
honor of Barbara Duncan Turk of Radford, Vir-
ginia, who passed away on September 16, 
2020 at the age of 87. She was a faithful serv-
ant of her community who worked to improve 
it in a variety of volunteer roles. 
Barbara was a native of Reading, Pennsyl-
vania, and a graduate of Southern Seminary 
in Buena Vista, Virginia. She was married to 
her late husband, James Turk, a Virginia state 
senator and U.S. District Court Judge, for 59 
years until his death in 2014. 
Improving Radford and helping the people 
who lived there was her life’s work. Among the 
organizations she devoted her time and atten-
tion to were the Radford Women’s Club, 
Radford Community Hospital/Carilion New 
River Valley (NRV) Medical Center Volunteer 
Program, Radford Rotary Club, and the NRV 
Community Chorus. Radford University bene-
fited from her activity on the Board of Visitors, 
Foundation Board of Directors, Arts Society, 
and Athletic Association, just a few of the nu-
merous ways she supported the university’s 
mission. As a devout member of First Baptist 
Church, she sang in the choir and frequented 
Sunday services and Wednesday dinners. 
Barbara also served on her alma mater’s 
Board of Directors and on the Board of Direc-
tors for Saint Alban’s Foundation and Carilion 
Hospital. 
Barbara’s activities did not detract from her 
commitment to her family, including her chil-
dren Ramona Gravley, James Turk, Jr. and 
wife Allison, Judge Robert ‘‘Bobby’’ Turk and 
wife Laura, Mary T. Prince, and D. Michael 
‘‘Mick’’ Turk and wife Barbara; fifteen grand-
children; and five great-grandchildren. I would 
like to extend them my condolences on the 
loss of this generous and service-minded 
woman.

IN RECOGNITION OF THE CENTEN-
NIAL OF THE DISABLED AMER-
ICAN VETERANS (DAV) 
HON. ROBERT J. WITTMAN 
OF VIRGINIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, September 24, 2020 
Mr. WITTMAN. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today in recognition of the Centennial of Dis-
abled American Veterans (DAV) on Sep-
tember 25, 2020. I want to celebrate and com-
mend DAV for reaching a momentous mile-
stone: 100 years of virtuous and important 
work. 
The honorable undertakings of DAV do not 
go unrecognized. DAV Founder Robert Marx 
saw a gaping hole in society that veterans 
continued to fall through: underfunded medical 
care and services. This led him to create the 
non-profit, empowering veterans to live with 
respect, dignity, and with access to the sup-
port they deserve. 
Now, with over 1,000 chapters, DAV con-
tinues to make strides for veterans and their 
families. DAV has supported numerous vet-
erans from giving them rides to medical ap-
pointments to assisting with benefit claims to

Therefore, Madam Speaker, I ask you to

HONORING DR. PATRICK WELCH 
HON. BRIAN HIGGINS 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, September 24, 2020 
Mr. HIGGINS of New York. Madam Speak-
er, I rise today to honor Dr. Patrick Welch, a 
Vietnam War veteran who made it his mission 
in life to ensure that veterans receive the ben-
efits they deserve. 
Dr. Welch enlisted into the United States 
Marine Corps at the young age of 17 and 
served in combat as an Infantry Squad Leader 
with the 3rd Division during the Vietnam War. 
He was severely injured on the battlefield and 
immobilized for two years. For his service, Dr. 
Welch was awarded the Purple Heart, the 
Combat Action Ribbon, the Good Conduct 
Medal, the National Service Defense Medal, 
the Vietnam Campaign Medal, Vietnam Serv-
ice Medals, and the New York State Con-
spicuous Service Cross. 
Like many veterans, when Dr. Welch re-
turned to Buffalo, New York from the war he 
was struggling with post-traumatic stress dis-
order (PTSD). He quickly realized that many 
of his fellow comrades were facing the same 
challenges he was. It was at that point that he 
decided to dedicate his life to raising aware-
ness about veterans’ mental health and he 
worked to provide avenues in which they 
could seek treatment. In doing so he substan-
tially altered the conversation about the mental 
health of veterans in Western New York. He 
promoted the idea that mental health isn’t a 
taboo subject but rather a reality for a number 
of veterans returning home. He often says 
‘‘War doesn’t break us, war changes us.’’ 
Those who know Dr. Welch can attest to the 
fact that he is a great leader, educator, and a 
speaker who uses his skills to advocate for 
veterans. Dr. Welch is an active member of 
the Vietnam Veterans of America, was the Di-
rector of Erie County Veterans Services, and 
the Director of the Center for Veterans and 
Veteran Family Services at Daemen College. 
His most treasured role was helping individual 
veterans as a Senior Mentor in the Buffalo 
Veterans Treatment Court. Dr. Welch currently 
serves as the Chair of the Community Vet-
erans Engagement Board of Western New 
York. He always works closely with our office 
to advocate for policies and services that ben-
efit veterans. Dr. Welch recently joined our 
Service Academy Advisory Committee to as-
sist those following in his footsteps to serve 
our nation. He has built relationships with 
many veterans in Western New York behind 
the scenes. In doing so he has set a solid 
precedent for how each one of us should treat 
veterans returning home after defending our 
freedom. 
Dr. Welch’s extensive work has laid solid 
groundwork for the next generation of leaders 
and advocates. His openness about his per-
sonal struggles has fostered an atmosphere 
within our community where veterans feel like 
they have a safe place to be supported and 
heal. I have closely worked with Dr. Patrick 
Welch for many years so it is my privilege 
today to personally thank him for his service 
and friendship.

IN HONOR OF REP. EDWARD 
BUTLER 
HON. CHRIS PAPPAS 
OF NEW HAMPSHIRE 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, September 24, 2020 
Mr. PAPPAS. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to honor State Representative Ed Butler, who 
is retiring after twelve years of service to the 
citizens of New Hampshire. Rep. Butler served 
Carroll County District 7 for six terms in the 
New Hampshire House of Representatives. 
Rep. Butler, a fierce leader, has dedicated 
his career to championing progressive and in-
clusive legislation including defending LG 
BTQ+ rights, advocating for accessible health 
coverage, and supporting local small busi-
nesses. After years of faithful service and an 
unyielding commitment to furthering the cause 
of equality and justice for all Granite Staters, 
Rep. Butler made the difficult decision to fore-
go re-election in order to dedicate his time to 
helping his husband with the operation of their 
small business, the Notchland Inn, which has 
been impacted by the COVID–19 pandemic. 
Rep. Butler is known amongst colleagues as 
a hard worker who goes the extra mile to ad-
vocate for the betterment of his district. He 
has served as an example to many of what it 
means to be an effective and compassionate 
lawmaker. He approaches his work with good-
will, grace, and fervor. His embodiment of 
these values serves as a model to other rep-
resentatives and will continue to be a guiding 
principle in the General Court for decades to 
come. 
On behalf of my constituents in New Hamp-
shire’s First Congressional District, I want to 
thank Rep. Butler and his family for their years 
of dedication to our state. I congratulate him 
on his accomplished law-making career, and I 
wish him all the best in his future endeavors.

HONORING THE LIFE OF GIANA 
HUTTON 
HON. JAMIE RASKIN 
OF MARYLAND 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, September 24, 2020 
Mr. RASKIN. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to honor the life of my constituent from Silver 
Spring, Giana Hutton, who passed away unex-
pectedly on September 15, 2020. Originally 
from the south suburbs of Chicago, Giana 
graduated from Williams College with a Bach-
elor of Arts in History. She will be sharply 
missed. 
Giana was deeply committed to empowering 
young people and fighting for the rights of stu-
dents. While in her junior and senior years at 
Williams, Giana interned with Senator Ronald 
Burris as an Education & Judiciary Intern. Fol-
lowing graduation, she was selected as a Jun-
ior Associate Fellow in the Urban Education 
Leadership Program, where she worked with 
the District of Columbia Public Schools in the 
Office of Special Education to find potential 
community stakeholders to support inde-
pendent work habits for students with emo-
tional and learning disabilities. 
Giana later returned to school to receive her 
Master of Science in Public Policy and Man-
agement. During her second year, Giana in-
terned with Reading is FUNdamental Pitts-
burg, serving as its Outreach and Develop-
ment Intern. During her time with RIF Pitts-
burg, Giana was able to further work on her 
goal of reducing the achievement gap across 
socio-economic classes by raising money for 
literacy programs which provided students with 
greater 
access 
to 
books, 
activity-based 
projects to focus on the joys of reading and 
materials aimed at developing reading and 
comprehension skills. 
In 2013, Giana was selected as a recipient 
of the Public Service Career Opportunities 
Program Award. Through this prestigious 
award, Giana got a job as a Program Analyst 
working on federal grants to support low-in-
come students in the local charter and D.C. 
Public Schools. Through her job, Giana sup-
ported schools in providing students with sup-
plemental learning opportunities. 
Giana was a beloved sister of Alpha Kappa 
Alpha Sorority, Inc, an organization she joined 
because of its commitment to education. 
Through her involvement in Alpha Kappa 
Alpha, Giana was proud to be a part of a com-
munity in which she felt empowered and could 
inspire others. 
Giana will be remembered for her commit-
ment to empowering others and her dedication 
to providing educational opportunities for 
young people. I ask my colleagues to join me 
today in honoring the remarkable life of my 
constituent, Giana Hutton.

COMMEMORATING THE SMITH 
CREEK WATERSHED PARTNERSHIP 
HON. BEN CLINE 
OF VIRGINIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, September 24, 2020 
Mr. CLINE. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
discuss a unique public-private partnership 
that has yielded big conservation dividends for 
my home state of Virginia. 
Ten years ago, a dedicated group of land-
owners and partners gathered in a small 
Shenandoah Valley community to launch a 
unique initiative designed to improve local 
water quality through the power of Conserva-
tion, Collaboration and Community. Smith 
Creek was one of three ‘‘showcase water-
sheds’’ established by USDA’s Natural Re-
sources Conservation Service as part of a

new strategy to address bacteria, nitrogen, 
phosphorus and sediment contamination in 
Smith Creek. 
These ‘‘showcases’’ were established to 
demonstrate what can be accomplished when 
communities come together to solve natural 
resource problems in a targeted area. Smith 
Creek joined Maryland’s Upper Chester River 
and Conewago Creek in Pennsylvania to test 
this focused approach to stewardship on a wa-
tershed level. 
The Smith Creek Watershed presents some 
unique conservation challenges. Karst topog-
raphy dominates the Shenandoah Valley with 
hundreds of known sinkholes and over 35 
caves that complicate the conservation effort. 
It is also home to 75 percent of Virginia’s poul-
try operations and approximately 46 percent of 
its dairies. 
Local groups and organizations partnered to 
conduct extensive outreach over the past 10 
years, personally contacting area producers 
and landowners to increase awareness of as-
sistance available to implement water quality 
practices on local farms. As dedicated stew-
ards of the land, local farmers and landowners 
worked diligently to improve water quality 
while continuing to ensure our agricultural 
economy in the Shenandoah Valley thrived. 
Smith Creek agricultural producers have now 
treated more than 8,115 acres through Farm 
Bill programs like CSP, EQIP and the associ-
ated National Water Quality Initiative—over 
640 total acres in the last two years alone. 
Today, we recognize and salute the dedi-
cated conservationists and stewards of the 
land who have so successfully collaborated to 
preserve the farming heritage, water quality 
and scenic beauty of Virginia’s Shenandoah 
Valley and the Chesapeake Bay.

MOUNTAIN NEWS CELEBRATES 
100TH ANNIVERSARY 
HON. PAUL COOK 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, September 24, 2020 
Mr. COOK. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
honor and recognize the 100th anniversary of 
the founding of the Mountain News, a local 
newspaper in Lake Arrowhead, California. 
The Mountain News will celebrate its anni-
versary in October of 2020, having been 
founded in October 1920. Over the last cen-
tury, it has served as a voice for mountain 
residents in Lake Arrowhead and across the 
San Bernardino Mountains. From public inter-
est stories, to local crime and public safety 
news, to emergency preparedness tips during 
wildfire season, the Mountain News has been 
committed to providing quality news for its 
readers. The hard work and unrivaled dedica-
tion of its staff are the bedrock for the success 
the Mountain News has enjoyed. Its mission of 
providing quality journalism to the local com-
munity has been incredibly successful, and I 
am confident that we will see that success 
continue for another century. 
I offer my sincere congratulations to the 
staff, both past and present, of the Mountain 
News. This is a momentous occasion, and 
their hard work has informed and improved 
the lives of their fellow Lake Arrowhead resi-
dents. I hope that the next century is just as 
successful for the Mountain News as the pre-
vious one. 
RECOGNIZING NATIONAL CHILD 
PASSENGER SAFETY WEEK 
HON. DINA TITUS 
OF NEVADA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, September 24, 2020 
Ms. TITUS. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
during National Child Passenger Safety Week 
(September 20–26, 2020) to recognize the 
great strides we have made protecting our 
most vulnerable passengers: our children. We 
have moved from a high in the 1970’s of over 
6,000 deaths annually of children under 14 to 
fewer than 1,300 such deaths in 2018. While 
one death is too many, this is a monumental 
shift. Much of our progress is the result of 
child passenger safety (CPS) efforts to secure 
children correctly in car seats that meet fed-
eral motor vehicle safety standards (FMVSS) 
and are installed correctly in vehicles during 
every ride. 
Today, motor vehicle crashes remain a 
leading cause of childhood injuries and fatali-
ties and there is more we can do to protect 
children. The more than 43,000 nationally cer-
tified 
child 
passenger 
safety 
technicians 
(CPSTs) are a great resource for new parents 
and caregivers who need help with the proper 
installation and use of car seats. Their exper-
tise in choosing and installing car seats has 
saved lives, and there is a new platform to 
help them do this important job even better. 
Over the past several years, the National 
Digital Car Seat Check Form (NDCF) was cre-
ated through a partnership of the National 
Highway 
Traffic 
Safety 
Administration 
(NHTSA), AAA Northern California, Nevada, 
and Utah, the National Child Passenger Safety 
Board (NCPSB), Tennessee Tech University’s 
iCube, and Westat. The NDCF, managed by 
the National Safety Council, is the first na-
tional electronic car seat check data collection 
tool that is available to all nationally certified 
child passenger safety technicians in the 
United States. 
In addition to streamlining the collection of 
national data, this information can assist state 
child passenger safety coordinators in consid-
ering where services may need to be ex-
panded to meet the needs of all families, in-
cluding those in rural and underserved com-
munities. In fact, this data can help support 
the provisions I authored in H.R. 2, the Moving 
Forward Act, to support expansion of CPST 
training for underserved populations. 
Highway Safety Offices can tailor state mar-
keting campaigns that address child pas-
senger safety and include information about 
the highest forms of car seat misuse in their 
state. Further, available data will lend insight 
into trends and patterns regarding misuse of 
car seats and vehicle compatibility. This infor-
mation has the potential to influence engineer-
ing and design of car seats and vehicles and 
subsequently increase safety for vehicle occu-
pants. 
The NDCF has been in development for al-
most four years through an iterative process 
involving diverse representation from the field 
of child passenger safety. As of September 
20, 2020, 2,743 CPSTs have created NDCF 
user accounts and more than 31,000 car seat 
check forms have been submitted to the sys-
tem. Every state in the United States has reg-
istered CPSTs and has submitted data to this 
NDCF. The NDCF is also in use in the terri-
tories and regions covered by the Indian 
Health Services. 
The hope is to have the opportunity for the 
NDCF to improve the safety of our children. 
Data that can identify areas of need, recurring 
fault mechanisms, lack of understanding on in-
stallation, and other problems lead to reforms 
for everyone using car seats. These improve-
ments will save children’s lives. 
It is fitting that during Child Passenger Safe-
ty week I recognize this major step forward in 
improving national CPS. I encourage my col-
leagues to recognize the hard work of CPSTs 
in their communities who give their time and 
talent for their labor of love—keeping children 
safe.

TRIBUTE TO BARBARA BAILEY 
HON. HAROLD ROGERS 
OF KENTUCKY 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, September 24, 2020 
Mr. ROGERS of Kentucky. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to pay tribute to Barbara Bailey, 
Kentucky’s longest-serving television news an-
chor and a member of the Kentucky Jour-
nalism Hall of Fame, as she retires from 
WKYT-TV after more than four decades of 
dedication to broadcast journalism. 
As a native of Harlan, Kentucky, Barbara 
has been an inspiration to women and men 
from the mountains of southern and eastern 
Kentucky for many years. She has always 
worn her Appalachian heritage with great 
pride, first as a reporter for the Harlan Daily 
Enterprise, and continuing to display her pas-
sion for people in the mountains throughout 
her broadcast career at WKYT. Barbara gave 
a voice to individuals who may have never 
been heard otherwise, and shared stories that 
we, as Kentuckians, needed to be informed 
about. Thanks to her insight on issues in Ken-
tucky’s Appalachian region, WKYT has been a 
news source for families and individuals be-
yond the Lexington metro area, extending into 
the living rooms of families across southern 
and eastern Kentucky. It is Barbara’s south-
eastern Kentucky charm that won over the 
hearts of countless viewers, and likewise, her 
mountain moxie that influenced her journalistic 
integrity and earned the respect and trust of 
the people of this Commonwealth. 
Given a platform that few others are ever 
granted, Barbara has always been a generous 
steward of her talents and her personal time, 
volunteering for charity fundraisers throughout 
the state and serving on the board of various 
civic groups and organizations. Most recently, 
we joined together for the benefit of the 
Cawood Ledford Boys and Girls Club in Har-
lan County to expand their reach to more stu-
dents and expand their facilities. 
I was elected to my first term in office the 
same year that Barbara anchored her first

newscast in 1980. Our paths have crossed 
many times over the years, sharing informa-
tion about the challenges and triumphs in Ken-
tucky’s Appalachian region. Though small in 
stature, it is clear that Barbara carries tremen-
dous love and compassion for the people of 
Kentucky, with a special place in her heart for 
southern and eastern Kentuckians. 
As she begins a new chapter of life, I wish 
Barbara many wonderful years of retirement 
with her family and grandchildren. The people 
of southern and eastern Kentucky are proud to 
call Barbara Bailey one of our most distin-
guished daughters of the mountains.

the lives of those around him.

for the construction professionals of central Illi-
nois, Clint’s role could be best described as

successes are what is best for the folks he 
represents, but more importantly, what makes 
our community a better place to work and 
raise a family. Clint and his wife, Sarah, are 
advocates of children with hearing loss, fund-
raising, and creating policy changes for 
healthcare plans to include hearing aids and

tions him to secure projects for local, union

on the job with higher wages, benefits, and 
safe working conditions, The men and women 
of Central Illinois in the construction industry 
have benefited because of Clint’s relentless 
efforts to put them to work and keep them 
working.

ment to his community and the promotion of 
American youth. His work has had a profound 
impact on our community, Congratulations 
Clint, the honor is well deserved!

SPRINGFIELD RACE RIOT STUDY 
ACT 
SPEECH OF 
HON. RODNEY DAVIS 
OF ILLINOIS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, September 21, 2020 
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speak-
er, I rise today in support of my bill H.R. 139, 
the Springfield Race Riot National Historic 
Monument Act, to designate the site of the 
1908 Springfield Race Riots as a National His-
toric Monument to preserve and recognize it 
as an important part of our nation’s history. I 
am proud of the support this bill has received, 
and that the House Natural Resources Com-
mittee came together in a bipartisan way to 
amend this bill to pass it as the Springfield 
Race Riot Study Act, the next step in desig-
nating it as part of the National Park System 
(NPS). 
This site represents one of the three worst 
race riots in our nation’s history, where terrible 
and appalling events of racially motivated 
mass violence were committed against African 
Americans for merely existing in their own 
community, destroying an entire neighborhood 
as a result. The site and artifacts were un-
earthed during construction of the Carpenter 
Street segment of the Springfield Rail Im-
provements Project and consists of the re-
mains of five homes that were burned during 
the 1908 Springfield Race Riot. This event, 
and others like it in Illinois demonstrated that 
racial injustice was not an isolated issue only 
in the South, but one that must be addressed 
across the country. 
Ultimately the riots that occurred at the site 
played an integral role in the formation of the 
National Association for the Advancement of 
Colored People (NAACP) when Ida B. Wells- 
Barnett, a key leader in the African American 
civil rights movement, launched an anti-lynch-
ing campaign to end violence against African 
Americans as a result of the horrific events 
that occurred in Springfield. In 1909, just a 
year later, the NAACP was established, work-
ing tirelessly to improve race relations and to 
ensure that the events that happened just over 
a hundred years ago would never happen 
again. 
Just last month, we were successful in add-
ing the Springfield Race Riot site to the Afri-
can American Civil Rights Network in order to 
give it proper recognition immediately while we 
continue our work to designate the site as part 
of the NPS. The Site is now among several 
other important places that serve to com-
memorate and interpret the history of the Afri-
can American Civil Rights movement. Also in-
cluded in the Network is the Pullman National 
Monument in Chicago, which recognizes the 
first major labor agreement between a com-
pany and the Brotherhood of Sleeping Car 
Porters, the first African American led labor 
union; the Selma to Montgomery National His-
toric Trail, which traces the route of the 1965 
Voting Rights March in Alabama; and the A.P. 
Tureaud House in Louisiana, which was the 
home of the prominent civil rights attorney and 
legal counsel for the NAACP for more than 
three decades; along with many others. 
I thank the bipartisan group of my col-
leagues who supported this bill, Rep. DARIN 
LAHOOD, Rep. ALBIO SIRES, Rep. JOHN H. 
RUTHERFORD, Rep. ROBIN L. KELLY, Rep. BOB 
GIBBS, Rep. ANDRE´
CARSON, Rep. DON 
BACON, Rep. BENNIE G. THOMPSON, Rep. MIKE 
BOST, Rep. MIKE QUIGLEY, Rep. VAL BUTLER 
DEMINGS, Rep. SHEILA JACKSON LEE, Rep. 
ALMA S. ADAMS, Rep. RAJA KRISHNAMOORTHI, 
Rep. ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON, Rep. MARCIA 
L. FUDGE, Rep. STEVE COHEN, and Rep. SEAN 
CASTEN. 
I also thank Rep. WM. LACY CLAY, who co- 
sponsored my bill and led the African Amer-
ican Civil Rights Network Act of 2017, which 
was signed into law in January 2018. This Act 
established this important Network that I am 
proud the Springfield Race Riot Site is now 
part of. Thank you to House Natural Re-
sources Chairman RAU´ L GRIJALVA and Rank-
ing Member ROB BISHOP for their support and 
moving this bill through their Committee. 
Thank you to the Springfield Branch of the 
NAACP, the Illinois NAACP, the Central Illinois 
African American Museum, and the Library of 
Congress, for their efforts to preserve the arti-
facts, and raise awareness regarding the im-
portance of this site. 
We must continue this work to preserve and 
protect this site for present and future genera-
tions. It is imperative that we never forget the 
work that’s been done or the innocent lives 
that were lost, and the work we must continue 
to do.

OPPOSITION TO H.R. 4447 
HON. MICHAEL C. BURGESS 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, September 24, 2020 
Mr. BURGESS. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today disappointed in the Majority for pushing 
forward H.R. 4447, the Clean Economy Jobs 
and Innovation Act. Despite the bill’s stated 
objectives, this legislation would hurt our econ-
omy and hamper technological progress. 
This legislation authorizes over $135 billion 
in new taxpayer spending, and creates new 
mandates and prohibitions, all of which would 
only hurt Americans’ finances and consumer 
choice. The Majority failed to include the most 
important policies that would enable the rapid 
investment and development of new energy 
technologies: regulatory and permitting re-
forms. 
While I was pleased that five of my amend-
ments were considered and that three passed, 
I cannot in good faith support this partisan leg-
islation that will hurt our Nation’s economic re-
covery and reduce the speed of innovation in 
the marketplace. 
Due to the partisan nature of H.R. 4447, I 
would have not only voted no, but strongly en-
couraged my fellow members to do so.
